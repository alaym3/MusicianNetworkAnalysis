'''Roxy Music''' <!-- please note before changing -->were <!-- _not_ "was"! Article is not written in American English. See WP:ENGVAR for clarification. --> an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1970 by [[Bryan Ferry]]—who became the band's lead singer and main songwriter—and bass guitarist [[Graham Simpson (musician)|Graham Simpson]]. The other longtime members were [[Phil Manzanera]] (guitar), [[Andy Mackay]] (saxophone and [[oboe]]), and [[Paul Thompson (musician)|Paul Thompson]] (drums and percussion). Other members included [[Brian Eno]] (synthesizer and 'treatments'), [[Eddie Jobson]] (synthesizer and violin), and [[John Gustafson (musician)|John Gustafson]] (bass). Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and toured together intermittently over the next few years. Ferry frequently enlisted band members as session musicians for his solo releases.

Roxy Music became a successful act in Europe and Australia during the 1970s.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1970–1971)===
In November 1970, Bryan Ferry, who had just lost his job teaching ceramics at a girls' school for holding impromptu record-listening sessions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/history/chronology/1970s/index.shtml#1970 |title=Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music Chronology |publisher=RoxyRama |access-date=24 May 2010}}</ref> advertised for a keyboard-player to collaborate with him and [[Graham Simpson (musician)|Graham Simpson]], a bass-player he knew from his Newcastle art-college band, the Gas Board, and with whom he collaborated on his first songs. In early 1970 Ferry had auditioned as lead singer for [[King Crimson]], who were seeking a replacement for [[Greg Lake]]. While [[Robert Fripp]] and [[Pete Sinfield]] decided Ferry's voice was unsuitable for King Crimson's material, they were impressed with his talent and helped the fledgling Roxy Music to obtain a contract with [[E.G. Records]].

[[Andy Mackay]] replied to Ferry's advertisement, not as a keyboard-player but a saxophonist and oboist, though he did have a [[VCS3]] synthesizer. Mackay had already met [[Brian Eno]] during university days, as both were interested in avant-garde and electronic music. Although Eno was a non-musician, he could operate a synthesizer and owned a [[Revox]] reel-to-reel tape machine, so Mackay convinced him to join the band as a technical adviser. Before long Eno was an official member of the group.  Rounding out the original sextet were guitarist Roger Bunn (who had issued the well-regarded solo album ''Piece Of Mind'' earlier in 1970)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/roger-bunn-mn0001614978/biography|title=Roger Bunn - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> and drummer Dexter Lloyd, a classically trained [[timpani]]st.  The group's name was derived from Ferry and Mackay making a list of old cinemas, and Ferry picking Roxy because it had a "resonance", some "faded glamour", and "didn't really mean anything".<ref name="rob-chapman.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.rob-chapman.com/pages/journalism.html|title=Rob Chapman, author, journalist and musician, Roxy Music: They Came From Planet Bacofoil|website=Rob-chapman.com|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> After learning of an [[Bob Segarini|American band with the name Roxy]], Ferry changed the name to Roxy Music.<ref name="rob-chapman.com"/>

Roxy played live through 1971, and recorded a demo tape of some early compositions.  In the spring of '71, Lloyd left the band, and an advertisement was placed in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' saying "wonder drummer wanted for an avant rock group".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/biographies/paulthompson.shtml |title=Paul Thompson Biography |publisher=Roxyrama.com |access-date=20 July 2011 |archive-date=6 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106143825/http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/biographies/paulthompson.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Paul Thompson (musician)|Paul Thompson]] responded to the advertisement and joined the band in June 1971.

Bunn left the group at the end of the summer of 1971, and in October, Roxy advertised in ''Melody Maker'' seeking the "Perfect Guitarist".  The successful applicant was [[David O'List]], former guitarist with [[The Nice]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/25/rocks-backpages-roxy-music|title=Roxy Music: 'Being big is the only way in rock' – a classic interview from the vaults|first=Jonh|last=Ingham|date=25 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref>  [[Phil Manzanera]]—soon to become a group member—was one of about twenty other players who also auditioned.  Although he did not initially make the band as a guitarist, the group were impressed enough with Manzanera that he was invited to become Roxy Music's roadie, an offer which he accepted.

The band's fortunes were greatly increased by the support of broadcaster [[John Peel]] and ''Melody Maker'' journalist [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]]. Williams became an enthusiastic fan after meeting Ferry and being given a demonstration tape during mid-1971, and wrote the first major article on the band, featured on ''Melody Maker'''s "Horizons" page in the edition of 7 August 1971. This line-up of Roxy Music (Ferry/Mackay/Eno/Simpson/Thompson/O'List) recorded a BBC session shortly thereafter.

===First two albums (1972–1973)===
In early February 1972, guitarist O'List quit the group abruptly after an altercation with Paul Thompson, which took place at their audition for David Enthoven of [[E.G. Records|EG Management]]. When O'List didn't show up for the next rehearsal, Manzanera was asked to come along, on the pretext of becoming the band's sound mixer. When he arrived he was invited to play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, Manzanera had learned their entire repertoire and as a result, he was immediately hired as O'List's permanent replacement, joining on 14 February 1972. Manzanera, the son of an English father and a Colombian mother, had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child, and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry, Mackay and Eno, he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band, with an interest in a wide variety of music. Manzanera also knew other well-known musicians, such as [[David Gilmour]], who was a friend of his older brother, and [[Soft Machine]]'s [[Robert Wyatt]].

Two weeks after Manzanera joined the band, Roxy Music signed with EG Management.<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) pp.376–77</ref>

Left to right: Jobson, Manzanera (back), Ferry (front), Thompson, Maida, Mackay]]  With this team, EG Management financed the recording of the tracks for their first album, ''[[Roxy Music (album)|Roxy Music]]'', recorded in March–April 1972 and produced by King Crimson lyricist [[Peter Sinfield]].<ref name="rob-chapman.com"/> Both the album and its famous cover artwork by photographer Karl Stoecker were apparently completed before the group signed with Island Records. A&R staffer Tim Clark records that although he argued strongly that Island should contract them, company boss [[Chris Blackwell]] at first seemed unimpressed and Clark assumed he was not interested. A few days later however, Clark and Enthoven were standing in the hallway of the Island offices examining cover images for the album when Blackwell walked past, glanced at the artwork and said "Looks great! Have we got them signed yet?"<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) p.385–86</ref> The band signed with [[Island Records]] a few days later. The LP was released in June to good reviews and became a major success, reaching No.&nbsp;10 on the UK album chart in September 1972.<ref name="Prendergast">{{cite book |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance: The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |last=Prendergast |first=Mark |year=2001 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=[https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/119 119] |isbn=1-58234-134-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/119 }}</ref>

During the first half of 1972, bassist Graham Simpson became increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative, which led to his leaving the band almost immediately after the recording of the debut album. He was replaced by Rik Kenton.<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''Roxy: The band that invented an era'' (Faber & Faber, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-571-22986-4}}) p.376</ref>

To bring more attention to their album, Roxy Music decided to record and release a single. Their debut single was "[[Virginia Plain]]", which scored No.&nbsp;4 in the British charts. The band's eclectic visual image, captured in their debut performance on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', became a cornerstone for the glam trend in the UK. The single caused a renewed interest in the album. Soon after "Virginia Plain", Rik Kenton departed the band, which would never again have a permanent bass player.<!--Do not add note stating that Kenton was not officially replaced in the band unless the later references to Gustafson, Spenner, and Tibbs as official members of the band during their stints are changed to demonstrate that they were not.-->

The next album, ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'', was released in March 1973. It marked the beginning of the band's long, successful collaboration with producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]], who worked on all of the group's classic albums and singles in the 1970s. The album was promoted with the non-album single "Pyjamarama"; no album track was released as a single. At the time Ferry was dating French model [[Amanda Lear]]; she was photographed with a black jaguar for the front cover of the album, while Ferry appears on the back cover as a dapper chauffeur standing in front of a [[limousine]]. [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]] (credited as a guest) played bass on the record, while Sal Maida played bass for subsequent live shows.<ref>Stump, Paul – Unknown Pleasures: A Cultural biography of Roxy Music, Thunder's Mouth Press, New York, 1998, p. 72</ref>

===''Stranded'', ''Country Life'', ''Siren'', and solo projects (1973–1977)===
Soon after the tour to promote ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'' ended, Brian Eno left Roxy Music amidst increasing differences with Ferry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/phonr74a.html |title=Phonograph Record: Eno Music: The Roxy Rebellion |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |date=1 June 1974 |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/eno%20left%20roxy%20music%20to%20do%20his%20laundry |title=Eno Left Roxy Music to do His Laundry |magazine=Contactmusic.com |access-date=22 July 2010}}</ref> The other members of the band are reported to have shared some of Eno's concerns about Ferry's dominance, but they elected to remain. Also, [[John Gustafson (musician)|John Gustafson]] became the band's bass player for the next three studio albums, but not always for live shows; though he toured with Roxy on certain dates in 1973 and 1975, other live Roxy bassists of this period (1973–1976) included Sal Maida, [[John Wetton]] and [[Rick Wills]].<ref>Stump, Paul – Unknown Pleasures: A Cultural biography of Roxy Music, Thunder's Mouth Press, New York, 1998, pps. 72, 154</ref>

[[File:Roxy_Music_band.jpg|thumb|left|Roxy Music, 1974]]

Eno, meanwhile, was replaced by 18-year-old multi-instrumentalist [[Eddie Jobson]], formerly of [[progressive rock]]ers [[Curved Air]], who played keyboards and electric violin. Although some fans lamented the loss of the experimental attitude and camp aesthetic that Eno had brought to the band, the classically trained Jobson was an accomplished musician.  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to the albums ''[[Stranded (album)|Stranded]]'' (1973) and ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'' (1974) as marking "the zenith of contemporary British art rock".<ref name="rollingstone"/> The songs on these albums also cemented Ferry's persona as the epitome of the suave, jaded Euro-sophisticate. Although this persona undoubtedly began as a deliberately ironic device, during the mid-1970s it seemed to merge with Ferry's real life, as the working-class miner's son from the north of England became an international rock star and an icon of male style.

On the first two Roxy albums, all songs were written solely by Bryan Ferry. Beginning with ''Stranded'', Mackay and Manzanera began to co-write some material. Gradually, their songwriting and musicianship became more integrated into the band's sound, although Ferry remained the dominant songwriter; throughout their career, all but one of Roxy's singles were written either wholly or jointly by Ferry (Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson did individually write a few of the band's B-sides). ''Stranded'' was released in November 1973, and produced the top-10 single "[[Street Life (Roxy Music song)|Street Life]]".

The fourth album, ''Country Life'', was released in 1974, and was the first Roxy Music album to enter the US Top 40, albeit at No.&nbsp;37. ''Country Life'' was met with widespread critical acclaim, with ''Rolling Stone'' referring to it "as if Ferry ran a cabaret for psychotics, featuring chanteurs in a state of shock".<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite news|title=Albums Reviews: Roxy Music -Country Life|work=Rolling Stone|first=Jim|last=Miller|date=27 February 1975|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/123934/review/5943949/country_life|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415212253/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/123934/review/5943949/country_life|archive-date=15 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their fifth album, ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'', contained their only US top 40 hit, "[[Love Is the Drug]]". (Ferry said the song came to him while kicking the leaves during a walk through [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].){{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

After the concert tours in support of ''Siren'' in 1976, Roxy Music disbanded. Their live album ''Viva!'' was released in August 1976. During this time Ferry released two solo records on which Manzanera and Thompson performed, and Manzanera reunited with Eno on the critically acclaimed one-off ''[[801 Live]]'' album.

===Final albums and hiatus (1978–1983)===
Roxy Music reunited during 1978 to record a new album, ''[[Manifesto (Roxy Music album)|Manifesto]]'', but with a reshuffled cast. Jobson was reportedly not contacted for the reunion; at the time, Jobson was touring and recording with his own band, [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]] The sleeve of ''Manifesto'' indicated that the revived Roxy Music line-up consisted of Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson, along with [[Paul Carrack]] (ex-[[Ace (band)|Ace]], keyboards), [[Alan Spenner]] (ex-[[The Grease Band]], bass), and [[Gary Tibbs]] (ex-Vibrators, bass); despite this all other media pointed to Roxy Music being a quartet (and a trio following the 1980 departure of Thompson), with the latter three musicians being regular collaborators of the band.

Three singles were issued from ''Manifesto'', including the major UK hits "[[Angel Eyes (Roxy Music song)|Angel Eyes]]" (UK No.&nbsp;4), and "[[Dance Away]]" (UK No.&nbsp;2). Both these tracks are significantly different from the album versions, as "Dance Away" was remixed for single release, and "Angel Eyes" was entirely re-recorded.

After the tour and before the recording of the next album, ''[[Flesh and Blood (Roxy Music album)|Flesh + Blood]]'' (1980), Thompson broke his thumb in a motorcycle mishap and took a leave from the band. Soon afterward he left permanently, due to musical differences with Ferry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/interview-roxy-musics-paul-thompson-1449252|title=Interview: Roxy Music's Paul Thompson|date=6 February 2009|work=nechronicle}}</ref>

At this point, Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera became the only permanent members of Roxy Music, and were supplemented by a variety of session players over the next few years including Tibbs, Spenner, Carrack, drummer [[Andy Newmark]] and guitarist [[Neil Hubbard]]. The trio's 1980 album ''Flesh + Blood'' became a huge commercial success in their homeland, as the album went to No.&nbsp;1 on the UK charts, and spun off three UK hits: "Oh Yeah" (UK No.&nbsp;5), "Over You" (UK No.&nbsp;5), and "Same Old Scene" (UK No.&nbsp;12).

However, the changed cast reflected a distinct change in Roxy's musical style. Gone were the unpredictable elements of the group's sound, giving way to smoother musical arrangements. ''Rolling Stone'' panned ''Manifesto'' ("Roxy Music has not gone disco. Roxy Music has not particularly gone anywhere else either.")<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/141100/review/5942773/manifesto|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224094932/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/141100/review/5942773/manifesto|url-status=dead|title=Roxy Music: Manifesto : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-date=24 December 2008}}</ref> as well as ''Flesh + Blood'' ("such a shockingly bad Roxy Music record that it provokes a certain fascination"),<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/283455/review/5942618/flesh__blood|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224093710/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxymusic/albums/album/283455/review/5942618/flesh__blood|url-status=dead|title=Roxy Music: Flesh & Blood : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-date=24 December 2008}}</ref> while other sources praised the reunion. ''[[Melody Maker]]'' said, of ''Manifesto,'' "...reservations aside, this may be the first such return bout ever attempted with any degree of genuine success: a technical knockout against the odds."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/articles/reviews/albums/1979_03_00_manifesto_melodymaker.shtml |title=Manifesto Album Review – Melody Maker – circa March 1979 |publisher=Roxyrama.com |date=25 May 2011 |access-date=20 July 2011 |archive-date=26 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726112118/http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/articles/reviews/albums/1979_03_00_manifesto_melodymaker.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1981, Roxy Music recorded the non-album single "[[Jealous Guy]]". A cover of a song written and originally recorded by [[John Lennon]], Roxy Music recorded "Jealous Guy" as a tribute to Lennon after his 1980 death. The song topped the UK charts for two weeks in March 1981, becoming the band's only No.&nbsp;1 single.

Later, with more sombre and carefully sculpted soundscapes, the band's eighth—and final—studio album, ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' (1982), recorded at [[Chris Blackwell]]'s [[Compass Point Studios]], was a major commercial success and restored the group's critical reputation<ref>(''Rolling Stone'': "''Avalon'' takes a long time to kick in, but it finally does, and it's a good one.")</ref> and contained the successful single "[[More Than This (Roxy Music song)|More Than This]]". The album also included several Roxy Music classics, such as "Avalon", "The Main Thing", "The Space Between", "True to Life", and "To Turn You On". The trio (augmented by session players) toured extensively until 1983, when Bryan Ferry dissolved the band, and band members devoted themselves full-time to solo careers.

===Reunions and final dissolution (2001–2011, 2019)===
Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay, and Thompson re-formed in 2001 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band, and toured extensively. A festival performance in Portugal and a short tour of the United States followed in 2003. Absent was Brian Eno, who criticised the motives of the band's reunion, saying, "I just don't like the idea. It leaves a bad taste".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1185763.stm Eno attacks Roxy reunion], BBC News</ref> Later Eno remarked that his comment had been taken out of context. Manzanera and Thompson recorded and toured with Ferry on his 2002 album ''[[Frantic (album)|Frantic]]''. Eno also contributed to ''Frantic'' on the track "I Thought".

During 2002, Image Entertainment, Inc., released the concert DVD ''Roxy Music Live at the Apollo'' featuring performances of 20 songs plus interviews and rehearsal footage.

In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked the group No.&nbsp;98 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]].<ref name=":0" />

Roxy Music gave a live performance at the 2005 [[Isle of Wight Festival 2005|Isle of Wight Festival]] on 11 June 2005, their first UK concert since the 2001–2002 world tour. On 2 July 2005, the band played "[[Jealous Guy]]", "Do the Strand", and "Love is the Drug" at the Berlin contribution to [[Live8]]; "Do the Strand" is available on the 4-disc DVD collection, and "Love Is the Drug" can be found on the Live 8 Berlin DVD.

In March 2005, it was announced on Phil Manzanera's official site<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.manzanera.com| title=Phil Manzanera, Expression Records and the Roxy Music Archive| access-date=11 March 2006}}</ref> that the band, including Brian Eno, had decided to record an album of new material. The project would mark the first time Eno worked with Roxy Music since 1973's ''For Your Pleasure''. After a number of denials that he would be involved with any Roxy Music reunion, on 19 May 2006 Eno revealed that he had contributed two songs to the new album as well as playing keyboards on other tracks. He did, however, rule out touring with the band.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2006_355.shtml| title=Viva Roxy Music| access-date=30 May 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060621075845/http://www.vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2006_355.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 21 June 2006}}</ref> Had the record been released as a Roxy Music album, it would have been the first album since ''Manifesto'' on which original drummer Paul Thompson performed.

During early 2006 a classic Roxy track, "The Main Thing", was remixed by Malcolm Green and used as the soundtrack to a pan-European television commercial for the [[Opel Vectra]] featuring celebrated football referee [[Pierluigi Collina]]. In July that year, the band toured Europe. They concentrated mostly on places they had never visited before, such as Serbia and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. Roxy Music's second drummer, Andy Newmark, performed during the tour, as Thompson withdrew due to health issues, and [[Oliver Thompson]] (guitar) made his first appearance with the band.

In a March 2007 interview with the ''Western Daily Press'', Ferry confirmed that the next Roxy album was definitely being made, but would not be vended for another "year and a half", as he had just released and toured behind his twelfth studio album, ''[[Dylanesque (album)|Dylanesque]]'', consisting of [[Bob Dylan]] covers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/cgi-bin/2007/cginews.cgi?record=22 |title=Roxy Rama |publisher=Roxy Rama |date=15 March 2007 |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> In June 2007, the band hired a Liverpool-based design agency to develop a website supporting their new album. Early in the year, Manzanera revealed that the band were planning to sign a record contract. In an October 2007 interview, Ferry said the album would include a collaboration with [[Scissor Sisters]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Elio |last=Iannacci |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/ferry-tails/article696296/ |title=Style |publisher=globeandmail.com |access-date=20 July 2011 }}</ref>

Over the summer of 2010, Roxy Music headlined various festivals across the world, including Lovebox at London's Victoria Park, Electric Picnic in Stradbally, Co. Laois, Ireland, and Bestival on the Isle of Wight. Owing to illness, Thompson was replaced on three dates of the tour by Andy Newmark, but returned for the Bestival set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/cgi-bin/2010/cginews.cgi?record=50 |title=TGPT Bounces Back For Bestival – 11 Sep 2010 – Bryan Ferry & Roxy Music News |publisher=Roxyrama.com |date=11 September 2010 |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref>

Roxy performed seven dates around the UK in January and February 2011, in a tour billed 'For Your Pleasure', to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary. They toured Australia and New Zealand between February and March for a further eight shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/tour/index.shtml |title=Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music Tour Dates – Live Concerts and Gigs |publisher=Roxyrama.com |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> These are the final Roxy Music live performances to date.

In 2012, Virgin released a box-set entitled ''Roxy Music: The Complete Studio Recordings 1972–1982'', celebrating 40 years since the release of the band's debut in 1972.<ref>[http://www.vivaroxymusic.com/articles_455.php Press Release: The Complete Studio Recordings 1972–1982], 25 January 2012. Retrieved 17 April 2012.</ref>

In a ''Rolling Stone Magazine'' interview on 3 November 2014, Manzanera stated that Roxy had been inactive since 2011 and were unlikely to perform together again.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/roxy-music-break-up-20141103 |title=Roxy Music Break Up|author=Greene, Andy|date=3 November 2014 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=3 November 2014}}</ref> Of a new album, he told ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'', "We all listened to it and thought, 'We can't do this. It's not going to be any good. Let's just bin it.' And so it's just sitting there on our personal computers. Maybe one day it'll get finished. But there's no point in putting it out if it's not great."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Nick|last=Hasted|title=Welcome back: Phil Manzanera|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #209|date=May 2015|page=22}}</ref>

On 29 March 2019, Roxy Music were inducted to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]; Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay and Jobson performed a six-song set at the induction ceremony at the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kreps |first1=Daniel |last2=Grow |first2=Kory |title=See Roxy Music Reunite for Rock Hall Induction Ceremony Performance |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/roxy-music-reunion-rock-hall-performance-815255/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=1 April 2019 |date=30 March 2019}}</ref>

==Style==
The early style and presentation of Roxy Music was influenced by the [[art school]] backgrounds of its principal members. Ferry, Mackay and Eno all had studied at prominent UK art colleges during the mid-to-late 1960s, when these institutions were introducing courses that avoided traditional art teaching practice, with its emphasis on painting, and instead focused on more recent developments, most notably [[pop art]], and explored new concepts such as [[cybernetics]]. As writer Michael Bracewell notes in his book ''Roxy: the band that invented an era'', Roxy Music was created expressly by Ferry, Mackay and Eno as a means of combining their mutual interests in music, modern art and fashion.

Ferry studied at [[Newcastle University]] in the Sixties under renowned [[pop art]]ist and educator [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], and many of Ferry's university friends, classmates and tutors – e.g. [[Rita Donagh]] and [[Tim Head]] – became well-known artists in their own right. Eno studied at [[Winchester School of Art]] and although his iconoclastic style became apparent early and caused some conflict with the college establishment, it also resulted in him meeting important artists and musicians including [[Cornelius Cardew]] and [[Gavin Bryars]]. His interest in electronic music also resulted in his first meetings with Andy Mackay, who was studying at Reading University and who had likewise developed a strong interest in avant garde and electronic music.

The three eventually joined forces in London during 1970–71 after meeting through mutual friends and decided to form a rock band.

Roxy Music was initially influenced by other contemporary artists at the time including [[The Beatles]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[David Bowie]], [[Elton John]], [[The Animals]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[King Crimson]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[The Who]], as well as American rock'n'roll acts and genres such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Motown]]. Ferry stated that Roxy Music's unique sound came as a result of the diverse and eclectic musical backgrounds of the band's members; "I had lots of musical influences, [[Phil Manzanera]] had this Latin heritage, being born in South America. Saxophone and oboe player [[Andy Mackay]] was classically trained. Eno with his deep interest in experimental music. They were specialists in their field. Paul Thompson brought a lot, with his very powerful, earthy drumming."<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/01/bryan-ferry-roxy-music-invented-new-pop-game-for-anything |title=Bryan Ferry on how Roxy Music invented art pop: 'We were game for anything' |work=The Guardian |date=1 February 2018|access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/02/roxy-music-40-years |title=Roxy Music: the band that broke the sound barrier |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2012|access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>

Roxy Music was one of the first rock music groups to create and maintain a carefully crafted look and style that included their stage presentation, music videos, album and single cover designs, and promotional materials such as posters, handbills, cards and badges.
They were assisted in this by a group of friends and associates who helped to sculpt the classic Roxy Music 'look', notably fashion designer [[Antony Price]], hair stylist Keith Mainwaring, photographer Karl Stoecker, the group's "PR consultant" Simon Puxley (a former university friend of Mackay's) and Ferry's art school classmate Nicholas De Ville. Well-known critic [[Lester Bangs]] went so far as to say that Roxy represented "the triumph of artifice".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/roxy-music/2774 |title=Roxy Music – The Early Years – Album Reviews |work=Nme |date=2 September 2000 |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> Ferry later attributed the band's look to his interest in American music and popular culture icons including [[Marilyn Monroe]], Motown and [[Stax Records]] artists. He also stated he wanted to create an alternative image to publicity shots of pop and rock groups at the time which would feature artists "in a dreary street, looking rather sullen. Which was the norm."<ref name="auto"/>

The band's self-titled debut album, produced by [[King Crimson]]'s [[Pete Sinfield]], was the first in a series of albums with increasingly sophisticated covers, with art direction by Ferry in collaboration with his friend Nick De Ville. The album artwork imitated the visual style of classic "[[girlie magazine|girlie]]" and [[fashion magazine]]s, featuring high-fashion shots of scantily clad models [[Amanda Lear]], [[Marilyn Cole]] and [[Jerry Hall]], each of whom had romances with Ferry during the time of their contributions, as well as model Kari-Ann Muller who appears on the cover of the first Roxy album but who was not otherwise involved with anyone in the band, and who later married [[Mick Jagger]]'s brother Chris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.librario.com/1123|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809141847/http://www.librario.com/1123|url-status=dead|title=These Vintage Years! – Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music – Kari-Ann|archive-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> The title of the fourth Roxy album, ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'', was intended as a parody of the well-known British rural magazine of the same name, and the visually punning front cover photo featured two models (two German fans, Constanze Karoli—sister of [[Can (band)|Can]]'s [[Michael Karoli]]—and Eveline Grunwald)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/ac26countrylife.html |title=Seventies' Greatest Album Covers: Country Life |publisher=Superseventies.com |access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> clad only in semi-transparent lingerie standing against an evergreen hedge. As a result, in many areas of the United States the album was sold in an opaque plastic wrapper because retailers refused to display the cover. Later, an alternative cover, featuring just a picture of the forest, was used.

==Legacy and influence==
In 2005, [[Tim de Lisle]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' argued that Roxy Music are the second most influential British band after [[the Beatles]]. He wrote, "Somehow, in a landscape dominated by [[Led Zeppelin]] at one end and [[the Osmonds]] at the other, they managed to reach the Top 10 with a heady mixture of futurism, retro rock'n'roll, camp, funny noises, silly outfits, art techniques, film references and oboe solos. And although their popularity has ebbed and flowed, their influence has been strikingly consistent."<ref name="de Lisle"/> In 2019, ''[[The Economist]]'' also described them as "the best British art-rock band since the Beatles", arguing that "among English rock acts of that time, their spirit of adventure and their impact" was "surpassed only" by [[David Bowie]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/03/19/how-roxy-music-helped-define-generations-of-pop| title=How Roxy Music helped define generations of pop|work=The Economist|date=19 March 2019|access-date=17 August 2020}}</ref> Bowie himself cited Roxy Music as one of his favourite British groups and in a 1975 television interview described Bryan Ferry as "spearheading some of the best music to come out of England."<ref>{{YouTube|id=aS4jBB-KMdE|title=David Bowie about Bryan Ferry - Rare - 1975.mov}}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
Roxy Music's work has been featured in a number of soundtracks for both film and television. Multiple Roxy Music songs were featured in the soundtrack to the 2006 BBC fantasy-police drama series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' set in 1970s [[Manchester]].  "[[Same Old Scene]]" plays over the closing credits of the 2008 pilot episode for ''Life on Mars''' sequel series ''[[Ashes to Ashes (British TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]'', during both the opening and end credits of the 1980 film ''[[Times Square (1980 film)|Times Square]]'', and is featured in a party scene in the 2018 film ''[[Can You Ever Forgive Me?]]'' The track ''[[Love Is the Drug]]'' is featured in 1995 Martin Scorsese film [[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]. The track ''[[If There Is Something]]'' plays a symbolic role in the 2008 drama/coming of age movie ''[[Flashbacks of a Fool]]'' directed by [[Baillie Walsh]] and starring [[Daniel Craig]]. In the film, the younger version of Craig's character is also shown dressing up as Bryan Ferry during a flashback scene set in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/flashbacks-of-a-fool-baillie-walsh-interview|title=IndieLondon: Flashbacks Of A Fool - Baillie Walsh interview - Your London Reviews|website=Indielondon.co.uk|access-date=3 October 2020}}</ref> [[Sofia Coppola]]'s 2003 film ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' features [[Bill Murray]]'s character Bob Harris singing an off-key version of "[[More Than This (Roxy Music song)|More Than This]]" in a karaoke club. It was also used on a Nissan TV advertisement in 1999. ''More Than This'' also is danced to by [[Toni Collette]]'s character in the 2019 mystery film ''[[Knives Out]]'' and was featured in the Cold War set television show ''[[The Americans]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpwIbqm-umk|title=More Than This - Lost In Translation (Bill Murray & Scarlett Johansson).avi|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=3 October 2020}}</ref> The title song ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music song)|Avalon]]'' of the 1982 album of the same name was featured in the 2005 [[Nick Love]] film ''[[The Business (film)|The Business]]''.

A remixed and instrumental of "The Main Thing" was used in a 2006 advertisement campaign for the [[Vauxhall Vectra]] featuring [[Pierluigi Collina]].

An antagonist character in the video game ''[[Final Fight]]'' named Roxy (a female acrobatic fighter) is named after the band, as are other enemy characters in the game that pay homage to someone or something related to music, like her identical partner [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]].<ref name="AkiraN">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |page=52 |issue=37 |date=March 2007 |title=The Making of Final Fight }}</ref>

Roxy Music's iconic 24 August 1972 television appearance on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', performing their single "[[Virginia Plain]]", was affectionately parodied on two occasions on different British TV comedy programs. The first parody was performed by the cast of the sketch comedy series ''[[Big Train]]'' (Series 1, Episode 6) in 1998; in the show's closing sketch, a dying [[Chairman Mao]] (played by [[Kevin Eldon]]) appears to expire, but then rises from his deathbed to perform "Virginia Plain" in the style of Bryan Ferry, accompanied by the rest of the  cast members (plus series co-writer [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]]) dressed as the members of Roxy Music. The second parody was performed by the cast of the comedy quiz show ''[[Shooting Stars (British TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'' in 2002 (Series 5, Episode 7), with [[Vic Reeves]] as Bryan Ferry, [[Bob Mortimer]] as Phil Manzanera, [[Johnny Vegas]] as Eno, and [[Matt Lucas]] as Paul Thompson.

In the HBO series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']]'s episode "[[The Riddle of the Sphinx]]", an experimental robotic copy of James Delos dances to the Roxy Music song ''[[Do the Strand]]''.

In early April 2021, an image of a purported 1971 letter addressed to "Mr B. Ferry" circulated widely on social media. The document appeared to be a rejection note, sent to Ferry by one "Hugh C. Smith", an Artists & Repertoire manager at [[Polydor Records]], in which "Smith"  patronisingly critiqued a demo tape that the group had submitted to the label. According to a 4 April 2021 item in the [https://www.treblezine.com/the-roxy-music-rejection-april-fools-joke-explained/ Treble e-zine], the letter was in fact an [[April Fool's Day]] prank which apparently originated from the Twitter account of former [[Talking Heads]]/[[Tom Tom Club]] drummer [[Chris Frantz]]. In May 2021, [[Tony Barrell (journalist)|Tony Barrell]], a British writer and Roxy Music fan, announced that he was the author of the letter.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tony Barrell |url=https://www.tonybarrell.com/dont-believe-a-word/ |title= Don't Believe A Word |date=30 May 2021 |accessdate=19 July 2021}}</ref>
