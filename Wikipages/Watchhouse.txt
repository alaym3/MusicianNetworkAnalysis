They signed to [[Yep Roc Records]] in 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indyweek.com/music/archives/2013/05/09/mandolin-oranges-third-album-this-side-of-jordan-out-on-aug-6-via-yep-roc-records|title=Mandolin Orange's third album, This Side of Jordan, out on Aug. 6 via Yep Roc Records|last=Lawrence|first=Jordan|access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> and have produced four albums under their umbrella, ''This Side Of Jordan,'' ''Such Jubilee'', ''Blindfaller'' and ''Tides of a Teardrop''.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Marlin recorded two instrumental albums without Frantz, ''Witching Hour'' and ''Fable & Fire''.<ref name="songwriter"/> In April 2021, the band announced that moving forward, they would change the group's name from Mandolin Orange to Watchhouse. Of the change, Marlin said "''Mandolin Orange'' was born out of my 21-year-old mind. The name isn't what I strive for when I write" and that ''Watchhouse'' is a name that reflects their "true intentions" as a band.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Watchhouse on Spotify|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/2WqEbbet6L2ndAbvhRVb2S|access-date=2021-04-21|website=Spotify|language=en}}</ref>
