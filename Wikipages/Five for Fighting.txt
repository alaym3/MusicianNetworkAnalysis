'''Vladimir John Ondrasik III'''<ref>[http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/39461?c=search&first=&last=Ondrasik "California Births, 1905–1995"]. Family Tree Legends Records Collection (Online Database). Pearl Street Software. Retrieved July 5, 2010.</ref> (born January 7, 1965), known by his stage name '''Five for Fighting''', is an American singer-songwriter, pianist, record producer, and philanthropist. He is best known for his piano-based [[soft rock]] ballads,<ref name="Ondrasik Cincinnati" /> such as the top 40 hits "[[Superman (It's Not Easy)]]" (2001), "[[100 Years (song)|100 Years]]" (2003) and "[[The Riddle (Five for Fighting song)|The Riddle]]" (2006). He also had a string of moderate hits on the [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] charts in the late 2000s and into the 2010s, including "[[World (Five for Fighting song)|World]]" (2006), "[[Chances (Five for Fighting song)|Chances]]" (2009), "What If" (2013) and "Christmas Where You Are" (2017).

Ondrasik has recorded six full-length studio albums, one EP, and several live albums as Five for Fighting. Ondrasik's song "Superman" [[44th Annual Grammy Awards|was nominated for a Grammy]] in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/five-fighting|title=Five For Fighting|date=June 4, 2019|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>

==Early years==
Ondrasik was born in Los Angeles, California, a child of a musical family. In his early years, he learned the piano; in his teens, he learned to play the guitar and started to write music. While he also learned to sing opera briefly, he soon decided that he would like to be a singer and songwriter.

While in college, Ondrasik continued to pursue music in his spare time. He graduated from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] with a degree in [[applied science]] and [[Applied mathematics|mathematics]].

==Career==
=== Early musical career (1988–1995) ===
After graduating from UCLA in 1988, Ondrasik became associated with the [[glam metal]] scene. He befriended [[Whitesnake]] bassist [[Rudy Sarzo]]<ref>{{Citation|title=#68: JOHN ONDRASIK, Five for Fighting, Multi-Platinum Artist: On Persistance|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2UD4zsregI|language=en|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref> and later formed a hair metal band with [[Scott St. Clair Sheets]], best known for his work with [[Pat Benatar]], called John Scott. Ondrasik later described the band's genre as "pop metal", comparing their sound to [[Bon Jovi]]. John Scott signed a management deal in the early 1990s, but any hopes of mainstream success were shattered with the rise of [[grunge]] and the decline of the [[hair metal]] genre.

Although John Scott did not release a studio album at the time, three songs co-written by Sheets and Ondrasik later appeared on a 1997 [[arena rock]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/St-Clair-St-Clair/release/6266471|title=St. Clair – St. Clair|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref> album from Sheets' band, St. Clair, which also featured Sarzo. Ondrasik did not perform on the album, but received writing credits for "After the Fire", "Shadow of Myself", and "Turn the Wheel".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://labibledelawestcoast.blogspot.com/2019/12/st-clair-st-clair-1997-aor.html|title=La Bible de la Westcoast Music – Cool Night -: St. Clair "St. Clair" (1997) -AOR-|last=Night|first=Cool|date=September 12, 2019|website=La Bible de la Westcoast Music – Cool Night -|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref> Sheets and Ondrasik would collaborate again much later, in 2008, when Ondrasik provided vocals for Sheets' song "Fly Me Away".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gcnews.com/articles/former-resident-in-songwriter-finals/|title=Former Resident In Songwriter Finals|last1=April 18|first1=Staff {{!}} on|last2=2008|date=April 18, 2008|website=Garden City News|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref>

After John Scott parted ways, Ondrasik says he then "went back to the piano, where I belonged."<ref>{{Citation|title=#68: JOHN ONDRASIK, Five for Fighting, Multi-Platinum Artist: On Persistance|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2UD4zsregI|language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>

Ondrasik spent the early 1990s playing singer-songwriter gigs around Los Angeles. He signed with a music publisher, Carla Berkowitz, who discovered him in a bar on Melrose and Vine. Ondrasik and Berkowitz later married.

=== Becoming "Five for Fighting" and first album (1995–1999) ===
In 1995, Ondrasik signed with EMI Records. He adopted Five for Fighting as a "band name" that same year<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/five-for-fighting-mn0000796281/credits|title=Five for Fighting {{!}} Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Interview and 100 Years Live on SportsCenter|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltbv7kqZqjU|language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref> at the request of EMI executives, who found Ondrasik's name difficult to pronounce.<ref name="Heuston">{{Cite web|url=https://mailtribune.com/news/happening-now/the-transformation-of-piano-man-john-ondrasik|title=The transformation of piano man John Ondrasik|last=Heuston|first=Laurie|date=January 19, 2018|website=Mail Tribune|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref> "Five for Fighting" is an ice hockey term that means a five-minute major penalty for participating in a fight. Ondrasik is a lifelong fan of the National Hockey League's [[Los Angeles Kings]].

Five for Fighting's first album, ''[[Message for Albert]]'', was released by EMI in March 1997. However, EMI Records' American division closed that June.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/21/business/emi-shutting-2-new-york-based-record-labels.html|title=Emi Shutting 2 New York-Based Record Labels|last=News|first=Bloomberg|date=June 21, 1997|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 11, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Although the album itself had already been released, there were no singles from ''Message''. "Bella's Birthday Cake" was intended as the lead single, judging by the existence of radio promos and demos featuring the song. The song "Ocean" appears alongside "Bella's Birthday Cake" on some promotional cassettes, suggesting it was viewed as a potential second single.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Five-For-Fighting-Bellas-Birthday-Cake-Ocean/release/1012569|title=Five For Fighting – Bella's Birthday Cake / Ocean|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>

[[AllMusic]] called ''Message for Albert'' "intelligent and well-crafted", concluding that it was "a promising debut that sadly lost its shot when EMI spontaneously combusted after the record's release."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/message-for-albert-mw0000095038|title=Message for Albert – Five for Fighting {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref>

Five for Fighting left EMI in the aftermath and recorded demos of "[[Easy Tonight]]" and "Jainy",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Aware-Seven-The-Compilation/release/8605726|title=Various – Aware Seven: The Compilation|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> both of which were re-recorded for 2000's ''[[America Town]]'' album. [[Capitol Records]] later re-released ''Message'' after the success of ''[[America Town]]''.

=== Breakthrough and peak commercial success (2000–2006) ===
Aware Records' Mark Cunningham made initial contact with Ondrasik.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_SSmith.html |title=Interview with Steve Smith |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=October 29, 2003 |access-date=October 7, 2011}}</ref> Cunningham then passed Ondrasik's demos to the label's new A&R Steve Smith.<ref name="hitquarters" /> After a discussion with Aware head [[Gregg Latterman]], Smith met with Ondrasik and set up a deal in partnership with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="hitquarters" />

His second album, ''[[America Town]]'', was released on September 26, 2000. In addition to 10 all-new songs, ''America Town'' included two re-recorded songs from the ill-fated ''Message for Albert'' album ("The Last Great American" and "Love Song"). "Easy Tonight" became the album's lead single in 2000. It received moderate airplay and peaked at 26 on the Adult Top 40.

The second single, "[[Superman (It's Not Easy)]]", was a commercial success, reaching number 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and number 1 on the Adult Top 40. The song became an anthem after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] and Ondrasik performed the song at [[The Concert for New York City]] on October 20, 2001. "Superman" was nominated for a [[44th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy in 2002]].

After the success of "Superman", two more songs were released as singles – the title track "America Town" and "Something About You" in 2002 and 2003, respectively – but neither song charted. While ''America Town'' did not reach the top 50 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, the album eventually was certified Platinum.

His third album, ''[[The Battle for Everything]]'', debuted at number 20 on ''Billboard'' 200 chart in February 2004. Some versions of the album were paired with a bonus CD, a five-song EP called ''2 + 2 Makes 5''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Five-For-Fighting-The-Battle-For-Everything/release/479949|title=Five For Fighting – The Battle For Everything|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> ''Battle'' included the single "[[100 Years (song)|100 Years]]", which reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart and stayed at number one for 12 non-consecutive weeks.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2002-08-31/adult-contemporary Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart info] ''Billboard''. Retrieved August 29, 2010.</ref> "Devil in the Wishing Well" was the album's second single, reaching number 23 on the Adult Top 40. A third single, a cover of "Silent Night" from the ''2 + 2 Makes 5'' EP, reached number 2 on the US Adult Contemporary charts.

''The Battle for Everything'' was certified Platinum by the RIAA, making it Five for Fighting's second straight Platinum-selling album. It received mixed reviews from critics, with [[AllMusic]] praising the record's "nice craftsmanship" and noting that it was "one of the more interesting, detailed" records in its genre. However, AllMusic was critical of the "pompous narcissism" of the lyrics, calling Ondrasik "deadly serious".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-battle-for-everything-mw0000326540|title=The Battle for Everything – Five for Fighting {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> Todd Goldstein of [[PopMatters]] also criticized the album's "pomposity", but enjoyed "Angels and Girlfriends" for its "unexpected chord changes" and "uncharacteristically quirky" lyrics. He singled out "The Taste" for its surprising energy, writing that during "the only pure guitar-rocking song among the twelve midtempo ballads, John Ondrasik ''screams''. It's a raucous, Howlin' [[Pelle Almqvist]] moment of sheer unselfconscious exuberance."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/fiveforfighting-battle-2495904096.html|title=Five for Fighting: The Battle for Everything|date=June 23, 2004|website=PopMatters|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> Another writer said Ondrasik seemed like a "contradictory figure" for his blend of romanticism and irreverence on ''The Battle for Everything'': "There's '100 Years,' the first single, a meditation on the poetry of time passing. But then there's 'The Taste,' whose delicate opening gets pulverized by slashing electric guitar and a raw, screaming vocal." According to Ondrasik, when recording ''Battle'', he and producer [[Bill Bottrell]] "were ambitious to the point of absurdity. If we wanted drama, we'd get a thirty-piece orchestra. If we wanted a rock edge, we went after it with reckless abandonment."<ref>{{Cite web|title=John Ondrasik {{!}} Yamaha Artists|url=https://www.yamaha.com/artists/johnondrasik.html|access-date=September 28, 2020|website=www.yamaha.com}}</ref>

=== Continued mainstream success (2006–2009) ===
Two years later, the album ''[[Two Lights (album)|Two Lights]]'' was released; this became his first career top 10 album, debuting at number eight on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart in August 2006. Its first single, "[[The Riddle (Five for Fighting song)|The Riddle]]", became Ondrasik's third career top 40 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 40. It reached number three on AC charts and number seven on Hot AC charts. The second single, "[[World (Five for Fighting song)|World]]", reached number 14 on Hot AC charts and the music video has been used to raise funds for various charities and as a theme for NASA's International Space Station (see [[#Philanthropy|Philanthropy]] below).

Five for Fighting released three live albums in 2007: ''Rhapsody Originals'' in January, ''iTunes Exclusive'' in June, and ''[[Back Country]]'' in October.

His fifth studio album, titled Slice, was released on October 13, 2009, and appeared on the iTunes top 10 albums on the first day. The album was produced by Gregg Wattenberg ("Superman", "100 Years"). Academy Award-winning composer [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], who penned the songs for musicals such as [[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]], [[Godspell]] and [[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]], co-wrote the title track, as well as the track "Above the Timberline".

On September 13, 2021, Ondrasik recorded "Blood On My Hands", a song critical of the [[Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)|withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan]]. Ondrasik wrote of the song:

<blockquote>
On the day 13 of our soldiers and over 60 Afghans were killed by a suicide bomber I sat down to write this song. After our last soldier left Afghanistan, I received a call from a friend organizing rescue evacs of "AM-CITS" and SIV holders. It was a highly emotional call and moment of clarity. Private citizens now had the burden of risking their lives to rescue Americans and Afghan allies that our government left behind. America has broken her promise, but these brave Americans have not.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New Song: Blood On My Hands|url=https://fiveforfighting.com/2021/09/13/new-song-blood-on-my-hands/|access-date=September 28, 2021|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Musical style and influences ===
Ondrasik has been variously compared to other piano singer-songwriters like [[Elton John]], [[Billy Joel]], and [[Ben Folds]], albeit "while still maintaining a harder rock edge exclusive to Five For Fighting."<ref name="themaneater.com">{{Cite web|title=Maneater {{!}} Five for Fighting finds inspiration in Americana|url=https://www.themaneater.com/stories/arts/five-fighting-finds-inspiration-americana|access-date=September 28, 2020|website=www.themaneater.com}}</ref> His more [[heartland rock]]-oriented tracks have been compared to those of [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Tom Petty]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicplayers.com/2006/09/john-ondrasik-riddles-justice-five-fighting/|title=John Ondrasik: Riddles, Justice, and Five for Fighting|date=September 1, 2006|website=MusicPlayers.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref> Ondrasik lists [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (and [[Freddie Mercury]] in particular<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fiveforfighting.com/bio/|title=Bio – Five For Fighting|language=en-US|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>), [[Steve Perry]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Elton John]], [[Billy Joel]], and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] among his musical influences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Musician-Band/fiveforfighting/about/|title=Five For Fighting|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>

Ondrasik makes heavy use of falsetto vocals in his music, with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' describing this as "a pleasant two-tone voice -- a tenor for setting up a situation and a higher register for driving a point home".<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Gallo|first1=Phil|date=March 1, 2004|title=Five for Fighting|url=https://variety.com/2004/music/markets-festivals/five-for-fighting-1200534762/|access-date=September 28, 2020|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref> In addition to piano, Ondrasik plays the harmonica and acoustic guitar.

[[Grunge]] influences can also be heard in earlier albums, such as in "Wise Man" on ''Message for Albert'', "Michael Jordan" on ''America Town'', and a non-album song called "Big Cities". Accordingly, Ondrasik has acknowledged [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] as one of his influences.<ref name="encyclopedia.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/five-fighting|title=Five for Fighting {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

On his style at the turn of the millennium, when "Superman" became his first mainstream hit, Ondrasik said, "I kind of fancy myself as a rocker and a rock guy and here was this ballad." Even though the song was softer than his style at the time, Ondrasik is "so grateful that I had that chance to be heard with that song. It will always be my first born."<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 1, 2020|title=John Ondrasik Goes Behind the Song On Five for Fighting Smash, "Superman"|url=https://americansongwriter.com/superman-by-five-for-fighting-behind-the-song-interview/|access-date=September 2, 2020|website=American Songwriter|language=en-US}}</ref>

Five for Fighting's live performances take a variety of forms: sometimes Ondrasik appears alone, switching between acoustic guitar and piano. Five for Fighting sometimes appears with touring musicians on bass, electric guitar, and drums. Five for Fighting also began playing orchestral shows in the early 2010s, often accompanied by a string quartet; Ondrasik has also appeared with the backing of full symphony orchestras for these shows. He often covers songs like "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]", "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]", "[[Message in a Bottle (The Police song)|Message in a Bottle]]",<ref>{{Citation|title=081719 Five For Fighting in Concert at Lake Mission Viejo Pt 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utPHwPumq_g|language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref> and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idsnews.com/article/2018/09/entfivefighting092318|title=Five for Fighting finishes tour at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater|website=Indiana Daily Student|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref> at the end of live performances.

===Professional speaking===
In 2012, Ondrasik became active on the public speaking circuit.

Ondrasik, under the auspices of the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO), performed for service members on a USO/Armed Forces Entertainment tour of [[Guantánamo Bay]] and other bases in Cuba in February and March 2007. He followed up with another USO tour in November 2007 of Japan, Guam and Hawaii. "I am struck by the sacrifices the troops and their families make for our way of life and I felt it was important to show my support", says Ondrasik.

In November 2007, Ondrasik coordinated the release of 13 free songs for US military members called ''CD for the Troops''. There have been five CDs for the troops and over one million copies given away. The songs donated included tracks from [[Billy Joel]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] and [[Sarah McLachlan]]. Subsequent volumes became available in 2008 (including songs by [[Gretchen Wilson]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Trace Adkins]]), 2009 (an album of comedy tracks with material from comedians such as [[Chris Rock]], [[Ray Romano]] and [[Adam Sandler]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shopmyexchange.com|title=Military Discounts On Top Brands, Women's Clothing, Fitness, Electronics – Shop Army & Air Force Exchange Service|publisher=shopmyexchange.com}}</ref> 2010 (featuring songs by [[Matchbox 20]], [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Ingrid Michaelson]], and [[Gavin DeGraw]]), and 2011 (artists including [[Sara Bareilles]], [[Mayday Parade]] and [[REO Speedwagon]]).

Ondrasik has also performed on the annual ''[[The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon|Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon]]'' and has done various events for the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] and Augie's Quest, raising awareness and funds for [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] (Lou Gehrig's disease).

In 2008, he got involved in the musical movement of spreading awareness about current slavery and [[human trafficking]] by performing a live version of "World" for the [[rockumentary]], ''[[Call + Response]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.callandresponse.com|title=Made In a Free World|publisher=callandresponse.com|access-date=December 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223190730/http://www.callandresponse.com/|archive-date=February 23, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

He still owns the car and wrote a song about it called "65 Mustang", which appears on the [[Two Lights (album)|''Two Lights'']] album.<ref>"65 Mustang", ''Two Lights'' by Five for Fighting, Columbia/Aware, 2006.</ref> The car also appears in the music video for "[[The Riddle (Five for Fighting song)|The Riddle]]" and on the cover art for "[[Chances (Five for Fighting song)|Chances]]".
