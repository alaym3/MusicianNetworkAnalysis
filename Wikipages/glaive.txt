A '''glaive''' (or '''glave''') is a European [[Pole weapon|polearm]], consisting of a single-edged blade on the end of a pole. It is similar to the Japanese [[naginata]], the Chinese [[guandao]], the Korean [[woldo]], and the Russian [[sovnya]].

==Overview==
Typically, the blade is around {{convert|45|cm|0}} long, on the end of a pole {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} long, and the blade is affixed in a socket-shaft configuration similar to an axe head, rather than having a [[tang (tools)|tang]] like a sword or [[naginata]]. Occasionally, glaive blades were forged with a small hook on the reverse side to better catch riders. Such blades are called '''glaive-[[guisarme]]s'''.

According to the 1599 treatise ''Paradoxes of Defence'' by the English gentleman [[George Silver]], the glaive is used in the same general manner as the [[quarterstaff]], [[half pike]], [[bill (weapon)|bill]], [[halberd]], [[voulge]], or [[partisan (weapon)|partisan]]. Silver rated this class of polearms above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons.

The [[Maciejowski Bible]] (Morgan Bible) depicts an example of a two-handed glaive used on horseback.

The contemporary term for this weapon may have been ''[[faussart]]'', which was used for a variety of single-edged weapons seen as related to the [[scythe]] (along with terms such as ''[[falchion]]'', ''[[falcata]], or [[fauchard]]'' derived from ''[[falx]]'', the Latin term for "scythe").

{{quote|It has been argued that the glaive had its origin in Wales, and that it remained a national weapon until the end of the XVth Century. Grose mentions a warrant (Harleian MS., No. 433) issued to Nicholas Spicer, dated the first year of Richard III's reign, 1483 for enrolling of smiths for "the making of two hundred Welsh glaives" – twenty shillings and sixpence being the charge for thirty glaives with their staves, made at Abergavenny and Llanllowel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/recordofeuropean03lakiuoft#page/104/mode/2up|title=A record of European armour and arms through seven centuries|website=archive.org|access-date=2017-06-29}}</ref>}}

==Other uses of the word==
The word "glaive" has historically been given to several very different types of weapons.
* The word "glaive" originated from French. Almost all etymologists derive it from either the Latin (''gladius'') or Celtic (''*cladivos'', cf. [[claymore]]) word for sword. Nevertheless, all the earliest attestations in both French and English refer to [[spear]]s.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] s.v. '''Glaive''':  "Hatz-Darm. regard OF. glaive as an adapted form of L. ''gladius'' (through the stages ''gladie'', ''glaie'', ''glavie''). Ascoli supposes it to represent a Celtic ''*cladivo-'' (OIr. ''claideb'' sword, Gael. ''claidheamh''). Neither view, however, accounts for the earliest meaning of the word in OF., which is also that of MHG. ''glavîe'', ''glævîn'', MDu. ''glavie'', ''glaye'', Sw. ''glaven''."</ref> It is attested in this meaning in English roughly from the 14th century to the 16th century.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] s.v., section 1, lists examples in this meaning from 1297–1592.</ref>
* In the 15th century, it acquired the meaning described above.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] s.v., section 2, lists examples in this meaning from ca. 1450–1678.</ref>
* Around the same time it also began being used as a poetic word for sword.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] s.v., section 3, lists examples in this meaning from ca. 1470–1887.</ref>
* In Modern French "glaive" refers to short swords, especially the Roman {{ill|gladius|fr|glaive|display=yes}}.
* The term "glaive" is used in the science fiction/fantasy film ''[[Krull (film)|Krull]]'' to refer to a thrown weapon, similar to the [[chakram]] or [[Hunga Munga|hunga munga]], which can return to the thrower, much like a [[boomerang]]. "Glaive" has been used to describe this fictional type of weapon in films, video games and other fantasy media since.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}
