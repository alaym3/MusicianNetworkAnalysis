'''Linda Viera Caballero''' (born March 9, 1969), better known as '''La India''', is a [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] [[singer]] and [[songwriter]] of [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[House music|house]] music and [[Latin pop]].

== Early life ==
Caballero was born in [[Río Piedras, Puerto Rico]]. Both her parents moved to New York City soon after her birth, settling in the [[Bronx|South Bronx]] area of the city. Initially, they lived with Caballero's grandmother, a woman who served as an important influence on Caballero's life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/india-mn0000099730/biography|title=India {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Caballero began singing as a young girl, even taking opera training for a brief time.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/latinmusicusa/legends/la-india-and-marc-anthony/|title=La India and Marc Anthony {{!}} The Legends {{!}} Latin Music USA|website=La India and Marc Anthony {{!}} The Legends {{!}} Latin Music USA|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> Her stage name, La India, was given to her by her grandmother because of her dark features and long, straight, black hair.<ref name="gale" />

== Career ==
===1985: Early career===
In 1985, when Caballero was 16 years old, she joined the [[Latin freestyle]] group [[TKA]], a fact not widely known. Credited as "Linda," she appeared in the group photo on the back cover of TKA's second single, "[[Come Get My Love]]." She left shortly thereafter.<ref name="MA">{{cite web|url=http://delafont.com/music_acts/E/india.htm |title=pf – La India – Latin Music Artists – Corporate Event Booking Agent |publisher=Delafont.com |access-date=2015-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321221150/http://delafont.com/music_acts/E/india.htm|archive-date=2016-03-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Caballero signed a record contract with [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]/[[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]], who planned to market her as the Latin version of [[Madonna]] (who recorded for sister label Sire Records).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latinalista.com/culture-2/la-india-supreme-princess-of-salsa|title=La India – Supreme Princess of Salsa|date=2012-06-07|website=Latina Lista: News from the Latinx perspective|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> India's debut album was titled ''[https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Night-India/dp/B000008GTM Breaking Night]''.  Three singles were released (Dancing On The Fire, Right From The Start, Lover Who Rocks You All Night) and they all became big hits in the dance clubs.  She also added her vocals to the Jellybean produced single, "Mirage".  After recording the album ''Breaking Night'', Caballero decided that she didn't want to take that route in her career.<ref name="gale">{{cite web|url=http://www.galegroup.com/free_resources/chh/bio/laindia.htm |title=Cengage Learning – Education – Engaged with you |publisher=Galegroup.com |access-date=2015-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724121520/http://www.galegroup.com/free_resources/chh/bio/laindia.htm|archive-date=2008-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="MA" /> She decided to switch to [[Salsa music|salsa]] because she believed that she needed to "cross over to [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|[her] people]]."<ref name=":0" />

=== 1992–1994: First salsa album ===
An important event took place when she accompanied her husband [["Little" Louie Vega]] to a studio session. Salsa bandleader [[Eddie Palmieri]] happened to visit the studio, and was impressed with Caballero when he heard her singing. In 1992, Palmieri produced Caballero's first Spanish-language salsa album ''Llego La India via Eddie Palmieri'' (The India has Arrived via [[Eddie Palmieri]]),<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-1002093294|title=La India|last=Aparicio|first=Frances R.|date=26 November 2013|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.A2093294|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> which was acclaimed as one of the best salsa albums of the year. From then on, Caballero became known to all as La India.<ref name="MA" /> India received a [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1993|Lo Nuestro Award]] nomination in 1993 for Best Female Performer, Tropical/Salsa.<ref name="billboardmag">{{cite journal

In 1994 La India, together with Louie Vega, recorded the house-music single "Love and Happiness" (Yemaya y Ochún), which paid tribute to [[Santería]] (a syncretic [[religion]] based in the Caribbean). This up-beat track was played heavily in dance clubs internationally. La India's involvement with Santería drew much criticism. [[Sergio George]] produced La India's 1994 album ''Dicen Que Soy'', a 2x gold-certified ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hit that added to her legend in the Latin-American music realm.<ref name=":0" />  The album also included the song "Vivir Lo Nuestro," a duet with [[Marc Anthony]]. Later this same year, ''Combinación Perfecta'' was released.<ref name="gale" />

===1996–present: La India, the Princess of Salsa ===

}}
In 1996, La India worked with [[Tito Puente]] on ''Jazzin'', an [[English language|English-language]] album of [[Swing music|swing]] classics with a Latin twist, on [[RMM Records]]. That same year she contributed the song "Banderas" to the album titled ''[[Voces Unidas]]'' (United Voices), a multi-artist tribute to the 1996 Summer Olympics. She also released ''India: Mega Mix'' that same year before divorcing Vega. La India sang a duet titled "La Voz de la Experiencia" (The Voice of Experience) with [[Celia Cruz]], the late Queen of Salsa.<ref name=":0" /> It was then that Cruz gave Caballero her longer name: La India, the Princess of Salsa. In 1997, La India recorded "Sobre el Fuego" (Over the Fire) with Puerto Rican salsa singer [[Kevin Ceballo]] as backup vocalist. The song was nominated for Best Latin Tropical Performance [[Grammy Award]]. In 1998, she won an ACE Award.<ref name="MA" />

On May 31, 1998, La India performed two sold-out concerts at the [[Luis A. Ferre]] Performing Arts Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She returned to the United States, and television network [[UPN]] aired one of her shows. India also held concerts in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] and in El Festival de la Calle Ocho in [[Miami, Florida]]. In September 1999, La India released her album ''Sola'', which earned positive reviews for the single ''Sola'' and for covers of two hits by the late Cuban sensation [[La Lupe]], ''Que Te Pedi'' and ''Si Vuelves Tu''.<ref name="gale" />

On February 5, 2000, a full-page ad in [[Billboard Magazine]] congratulated La India for her second [[Grammy Award]] nomination. In March 2000, she was featured in [[Vibe Magazine]]. On November 26, 2003, La India released ''Latin Songbird: Mi Alma y Corazón''.<ref name=":0" /> The album's lead single "Sedúceme" became a hit on the Latin charts, and topped the U.S. Billboard [[Hot Latin Tracks]] for several weeks. This romantic salsa hit single was La India's first number-one song. It brought her a new fan base with many awards and nominations, including two [[Latin Grammy]] nominations for Best Salsa Album and Best Tropical Song in 2003, and her third [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Salsa Album in 2004.<ref name="PRH">{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2002/vol6n21/LaIndia-en.html |title=La India's About More Than Just Salsa |publisher=Puerto Rico Herald |access-date=2015-10-11}}</ref>

In 2005, La India participated in the musical presentation ''[[Selena ¡VIVE!]]'', a tribute to the late Tejano sensation [[Selena]] Quintanilla-Perez. In 2006, La India released the album ''[[Soy Diferente]]'', which contained two songs that became award-winning hits. The 2007 Annual Latin ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Awards honored La India with Best Tropical Album of the Year Female for "Soy Diferente" (I Am Different), and Latin Dance Club Play Track of the Year for "Solamente Una Noche" (Just for One Night). In 2007, La India collaborated with Latin sensation [[Gloria Estefan]] in a duet titled "[[90 Millas]]."<ref name="PRH" />

On June 11, 2006, La India was honored by [[Union City, New Jersey]] with a star on the Walk of Fame at Union City's [[Celia Cruz]] Park.<ref name=CeliaCruzStar>Rosero, Jessica.

"Viva la comunidad Cubano North Hudson celebrates at the annual Cuban Day Parade"] ''[[Hudson Reporter]]'' June 18, 2006</ref>

La India released her ninth studio album in 2010. La India mentioned to the [[Associated Press]], "I am reinventing myself ... changing my physical image. La India will return to become a [[Barbie doll|Barbie]]. But more than that, I feel like a new woman because I have been blessed with many beautiful things. After many years, I have my family with me, and I am not separated from my mother, in which I suffered greatly. I have her in my life, and that brings inner peace that I haven't had in a long time."

On February 23, 2010, La India's hit single "Estupida" was released on iTunes. The single was a cover of the 2009 [[Italian language|Italian]] version "Stupida" by [[Alessandra Amoroso]]. La India's ninth studio album, ''[[Unica(Studio Album)|Unica]]'', was released June 1, 2010.

In 2011, La India continued to release new music. She performed a duet with [[Issac Delgado]] titled "Que No Se Te Olvide." In 2011, La India released a new house track titled "Tacalacateo," on which she worked with Italian DJ [[Peppe Citarella]]. "Tacalacateo" peaked at #13 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s dance music chart.

In 2012, La India performed as part of [[Unity: The Latin Tribute to Michael Jackson|UNITY]] : The Latin Tribute to Michael Jackson, along with other Latin artists such as Tito Nieves and Kevin Ceballo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/arts/collections/pbs-arts-festival/2015/unity-latin-tribute-michael-jackson/|title=Unity – The Latin Tribute to Michael Jackson {{!}} 2015 PBS Arts Fall Festival {{!}} PBS Arts|website=Unity – The Latin Tribute to Michael Jackson {{!}} 2015 PBS Arts Fall Festival {{!}} PBS Arts|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>

In 2014, La India once again signed with the record label [[Top Stop Music]], also joining the Salsa Giants project with [[Sergio George]]. La India released her tenth studio salsa album "Intensamente Con Canciones de [[Juan Gabriel]]" on [[Top Stop Music]] in 2015. It includes duets and solo pieces by both artists. This album was number one on Billboard's tropical chart for a consecutive four weeks. One song in particular, ''"Ahora Que Te Vas"'' quickly rose to number one on Billboard's tropical chart. With this song, La India became the Latino woman with the most-ever number ones, a record previously held by Gloria Estefan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/6633632/india-passes-gloria-estefan-tropical-songs-record|title=India Passes Gloria Estefan for Most Tropical Song Charts No. 1s Among Women|last=Mendizabal|first=Amaya|date=15 July 2015}}</ref>
