'''Fear Factory''' is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Los Angeles]], California in 1989. Throughout the band's career, they have released ten full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of sounds, all in their main style of industrial metal. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen changes in its lineup, with lead vocalist [[Burton C. Bell]] being the only consistent member for 31 years until his departure in 2020. Other than guitarist [[Dino Cazares]], there are no original members left in its current lineup. The band went on hold in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but resumed activity a year later without founding member Cazares. Previous bassist [[Christian Olde Wolbers]] replaced him as the new guitarist, and bassist [[Byron Stroud]] joined the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=1962 |title=UPDATE: The Official Roadrunner Records Statement On FEAR FACTORY Split!! – Mar. 7, 2002 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=April 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040928072450/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=1962 |archive-date=September 28, 2004 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In April 2009, a new lineup was announced. Cazares returned as guitarist, and [[Gene Hoglan]] as drummer. Bell and Stroud reprised their respective roles, and this lineup recorded the band's seventh studio album titled ''[[Mechanize]]'' (2010). Former members Wolbers and [[Raymond Herrera]]—both of whom were playing in [[Arkaea]]—disputed the legitimacy of the new lineup, and a legal battle from both parties had begun. Despite this, Fear Factory has since released three more albums: ''[[The Industrialist]]'' (2012), ''[[Genexus (album)|Genexus]]'' (2015) and ''[[Aggression Continuum]]'' (2021).

The band has performed at four [[Ozzfest]]s and the inaugural [[Gigantour]]. Their singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200, and they have sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.burtoncbell.com/fear-factory/|title=Fear Factory|website=Burton C.

==History==

===Early years (1989–1990)===
Fear Factory was formed in 1989 under the name '''Ulceration''', which the band agreed would "just be a cool name".<ref name="FFF" /> In 1990, the name "Fear the Factory" was adopted. The name was inspired by a factory that the band supposedly saw near their rehearsal space which was guarded by men carrying rifles. Later, they shortened the name to just "Fear Factory".

The band's origins can be traced to an outfit formed by guitarist [[Dino Cazares]]—formerly of ''The Douche Lords''—and drummer [[Raymond Herrera]] in Los Angeles, California.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |author= Huey, Steve |url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p23420/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title= Fear Factory Biography |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= Allmusic}}</ref> Their first lineup was completed with the addition of bassist Dave Gibney and vocalist [[Burton C. Bell]] (ex-''Hate Face''<ref name="AMG" />), who was allegedly recruited by an impressed Cazares, who overheard him singing "[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]" by [[U2]].<ref name="FFF">{{cite web |author1=Hook, James |author2=Maske, Douglas A. |author3=Rhoney, Stephen |url= http://www.fearfactoryfans.com/bio.php |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050205232828/http://www.fearfactoryfans.com/bio.php |archive-date= February 5, 2005 |title= Who is Fear Factory? |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= FearFactoryFans.com}}</ref><ref name="MVT" /> Cazares played bass on the first three Fear Factory albums ''Concrete'', ''Soul of a New Machine'' and ''Demanufacture'', on which Cazares changed many of the riffs during the recording. It took Cazares two weeks to get the appropriate guitar tone.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Cazares created, wrote and recorded all the music on the album. Wolbers joined the band two weeks before they were scheduled to go on tour to promote the album and, although he contributed musical changes to a couple of songs on the album he stated that these were not significant.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Fear Factory's earliest demo recordings are strongly reminiscent of the early works of [[Napalm Death]] and [[Godflesh]], an acknowledged influence of the band in the grindcore-driven approach of the former and the mechanical brutality, bleakness, and vocal stylings of the latter.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} According to Brian Russ of The BNR Metal Pages, the demos are remarkable for integrating these influences into the band's death metal sound and for Burton C. Bell's pioneering fusion of extreme [[death growl]]s and clean vocals in the same song, which was to become a significant and influential element of the band's sound throughout their career.{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}<ref name="BNR">{{cite web |author= Russ, Brian |url= http://www.bnrmetal.com/v3/band/band/FeFa |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120308113455/http://www.bnrmetal.com/v3/band/band/FeFa |url-status= dead |archive-date= March 8, 2012 |title= Fear Factory |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= BNR Productions }}</ref> The use of grunts and "throat singing" combined with clean vocals later defined the [[nu metal]] and other emerging subgenres of metal. Many vocalists in today's metal scene use two or more methods of singing and vocalizing lyrics. The band contributed two songs to the ''L.A. Death Metal Compilation'' in 1990.<ref name="AMG" /> The band played its first show on October 31, 1990.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===''Concrete'' (1991)===
{{Main|Concrete (Fear Factory album)}}

In 1991, Fear Factory recorded a series of cuts for their debut album with the then-little-known producer [[Ross Robinson]] in [[Blackie Lawless]]' studio. The band's members were unhappy with the terms of their recording contract and caused a delay with the album's release. The band retained the rights to the songs, many of which they re-recorded in 1992 with a different producer, Colin Richardson, for inclusion on their debut release ''[[Soul of a New Machine]]''. Meanwhile, Ross Robinson obtained the rights to the recording, which he used to promote himself as a producer. The album was officially released in 2002 by [[Roadrunner Records]] under the title ''Concrete'' after the band's breakup. The release was controversial because the album was issued because of the band's outstanding contractual obligation and without the approval of every band member.<ref name="MVT">{{cite web |author= Purdie, Iain |url= http://www.moshville.co.uk/interview/2015/12/interview-burton-c-bell-of-fear-factory/ |title= Interview: Burton C Bell of Fear Factory |access-date= December 24, 2015 |publisher= Moshville Times}}</ref>

Fan opinion has been divided as to whether Ross Robinson's production properly captured the intricacies of the band's sound. The released album favored a straight-up approach and Robinson's distinct drum sound. ''Concrete'' has become an important album for fans of the early Fear Factory sound; it can be seen as a bridge between the band's sound on their demo recordings and their debut release, ''Soul of a New Machine'', and a blueprint for later songs and [[B-side]]s.<ref name="MVT" />

Based on the ''Concrete'' recording, [[Max Cavalera]] recommended Fear Factory to the then-death-metal-focused Roadrunner Records label, which offered the band a recording contract.<ref name="FFF" /> While the band signed the contract, it has since become controversial because of Roadrunner's treatment of the band during the events surrounding its 2002 breakup.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} This was reflected in the first album ''Archetype'' (2004), which was released following the band's re-formation. The opening song with lyrics by Burton C. Bell, "Slave Labor", was direct about the band's feelings on the matter. After working with numerous bassists, [[Andrew Shives]] was hired as a live bassist prior to the release of ''Soul of a New Machine''.

===''Soul of a New Machine'' (1992–1994)===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
{{Main|Soul of a New Machine}}

''Soul of a New Machine'' (1992), which was recorded with producer Colin Richardson, gave the band greater exposure in the music scene. It is characterized by an industrial [[death metal]] sound that combined Bell's harsh and melodic vocals, Herrera's machine-like drums, the integrated industrial samples and textures and the sharp, down-tuned, rhythmic, death metal riffs of Dino Cazares. Cazares and Herrera wrote all the music. Because the band had no bass player, Cazares played both guitar and bass on the recording.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic called the album "groundbreaking" and said that "it ushered in the '90s alternative metal era".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/soul-of-a-new-machine-mw0000112438|title=Soul of a New Machine – Fear Factory {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=October 21, 2019}}</ref>

Due to the extreme nature of the music, the album never reached the level of popularity attained by their later, more accessible works, and remains a cult favorite.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} ''Soul of a New Machine'' is considered by many{{Who|date=July 2017}} as Fear Factory's final work death metal album because with each album, the band's style shifted away from the death metal subgenre.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

To promote the album, Fear Factory embarked on extensive U.S. tours with [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], [[Sepultura]], and [[Sick Of It All]]. During this period, sampler-keyboardist [[Reynor Diego]] joined the group. An album tour of Europe with [[Brutal Truth]], then [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], and [[Sleep (band)|Sleep]], followed. The following year, they hired [[Front Line Assembly]] member [[Rhys Fulber]] to remix some songs from the album, demonstrating the band's willingness to experiment with their music. The results took on a predominantly [[industrial music|industrial]] guise, and were released as the ''[[Fear Is the Mindkiller]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] (1993). ''Soul of a New Machine'' and ''Fear is the Mindkiller'' were released (2004) as a package in a new re-mastered reissue by Roadrunner Records.

In 1994, Andrew Shives was forced to leave the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fear-factory-mn0000167320/biography|title=Fear Factory {{!}} Biography & History|last=Huey|first=Steve|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=October 21, 2019}}</ref> Cazares recorded both the guitar and bass for the entire album. In November the same year, the band met Belgian Christian Olde Wolbers through [[Evan Seinfeld]] of Biohazard. Wolbers auditioned for Fear Factory's permanent bassist.<ref name="FFF" /> Wolbers joined the band immediately since the band's tour was starting in two weeks.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===''Demanufacture'' (1995–1997)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{Main|Demanufacture (album)}}
In June 1995, the band participated at the [[Dynamo Open Air]] festival in Netherlands.

Fear Factory's second album, ''Demanufacture'', was released on June 12. Generally considered to be the band's defining work, features, in comparison to the overly brutal approach favored in the early recordings, a more industrial metal sound characterized by a mix of rapid fire thrash metal/industrial metal guitar riffs and tight, pulse driven drum beats, roaring (rather than growled, but still aggressive) vocals that made way for melodic singing and powerful bass lines.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The album's production is more refined and the integration of atmospheric keyboard parts and industrial textures upon Cazares' and Herrera's precise musicianship made the songs sound clinical, cold and machine-like and gave the band's music a futuristic feel than the band's previous works. Many fans consider Rhys Fulber's involvement with the band integral to this dimension of their sound. There were extensive contributions from Reynor Diego as well; adding key samples, loops and electronic flourishes to the group dynamics.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

''Demanufacture'' was awarded the maximum five-star rating in the UK's ''[[Kerrang!]]'' rock magazine.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} It went on to become a fairly successful album; whereas ''Soul of a New Machine'' failed to chart anywhere, ''Demanufacture'' made the Top 10 of the Billboard Heatseekers charts and a video was produced for the song "Replica"{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. The video was featured in the ''[[Test Drive 5]]'' video game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The song "Zero Signal" was featured on the ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' film soundtrack (1995). Instrumental versions of ''Demanufacture'' songs were later used in [[Personal computer|PC]] video games ''[[Carmageddon]]'' and ''[[Messiah (video game)|Messiah]]''{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

Fear Factory spent the next few years touring with such bands [[Black Sabbath]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Iron Maiden]], and opened for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] in North America and Europe during late 1995. They went on their first headlining European tour in mid-1996, with [[Manhole]] and [[Drain S.T.H.]] playing in clubs and music festivals, such as [[With Full Force]], Wâldrock or [[Graspop Metal Meeting]]. They also appeared at the [[Ozzfest]] in 1996 and 1997. In early 1997, they participated at the [[Big Day Out]] festival in Australia and New Zealand. In May 1997, the band released a new album composed of ''Demanufacture'' remixes by artists such as [[Rhys Fulber]], DJ Dano or [[Junkie XL]] called ''[[Remanufacture - Cloning Technology]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This was the band's first appearance on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] ;it also appeared on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Roadrunner Records re-released, in a 10th Anniversary single package, ''Demanufacture'' and ''Remanufacture'' in 2005, which is similar to that of ''Soul of a New Machine'' (2004). This edition also includes bonus tracks from the [[digipak]] version of ''Demanufacture'' (1995).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===''Obsolete'' (1998–2000)===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
{{Main|Obsolete (album)}}
Fear Factory's third studio album, ''Obsolete'' (July 1998), was reportedly completed earlier than planned by canceling an appearance at the [[Dynamo Open Air Festival]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

''Obsolete'' was similar in sound to ''Demanufacture'', and introduced the [[progressive metal]] and [[alternative metal]] elements to the band's output.<ref name="Obsrev">{{cite web |author= Prato, Greg |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r366131|pure_url=yes}}
 |title= Obsolete Review |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= Allmusic}}</ref> For the first time, the album featured Christian Olde Wolbers writing and recording full-time with the band. It also featured Cazares' debut use of 7-string Ibanez guitars tuned to A tuning (A, D, G, C, F, A, D), and paved the way for a lower-tuned sound than previously. The album is also notable for Rhys Fulber's increased involvement with the band.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

While Fear Factory had explored the theme of "Man versus Machine" in their earlier work, ''Obsolete'' was their first [[concept album]] that dealt specifically with a literal interpretation of this subject.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} It tells a story called ''Conception 5'', which was written by Bell, that takes place in a future world where mankind is rendered "obsolete" by machines. Its characters include the "[[Edgecrusher]]", "Smasher/Devourer", and the "Securitron" monitoring system. The story is presented in the lyrics booklet in a screenplay format between the individual songs. The printed story parts link the lyrics of the songs together thematically.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

''Obsolete'' was released during the alternative metal boom of the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} It was supported by tours with [[Slayer]] and later, [[Rammstein]], and a headlining spot on the second stage at Ozzfest in 1999 as last-minute replacements for [[Judas Priest]]. They also toured in Europe in December 1998 with [[Spineshank]] and [[Kilgore (band)|Kilgore]], and went on their first headlining tour in North America with [[Static-X]] the next year, though the first leg was interrupted due to the band's tour bus and material being stolen. They also played in Japan for the first time. ''Obsolete'' became the band's highest selling album, marking the band's first entry into the Top 100 on the Billboard charts. The album also spawned singles "[[Descent (song)|Descent]]" and a [[digipak]] bonus track, "[[Cars (song)|Cars]]", a cover of the [[Gary Numan]] song featuring a guest appearance by Numan on the song.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The single made the Mainstream Rock Top 40 in 1999 and was also featured in the video game, [[Test Drive 6]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Numan also performed a spoken-word sample on the album's title track.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A video was filmed for the song "[[Resurrection (Fear Factory song)|Resurrection]]". To date, ''Obsolete'' remains the only Fear Factory album to have achieved gold sales in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===''Digimortal'' and demise (2001–2002)===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
{{Main|Digimortal (album)}}

In early 2001, Fear Factory was asked to headline [[SnoCore Tour|SnoCore Rock]]. The success of ''Obsolete'' and "Cars" was a turning point for the band; Roadrunner Records was now keen on capitalizing on the band's sales potential and pressured the band to record more accessible material for the follow-up album, titled ''Digimortal'', which was released on April 23, 2001.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Few weeks before its release, they were touring in Europe with [[One Minute Silence]].

They went on a long headlining North American tour during 2001, then played in much larger European festivals like [[Bizarre Festival]], [[Pukkelpop]], [[Lowlands Festival]] and [[Leeds & Reading Festival]]. They then went on the first Roadrunner Roadrage tour in North America, toured Europe with [[Devin Townsend]] and [[Godflesh]] and played in Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

''Digimortal'' made the Top 40 on the Billboard album charts, the Top 20 in Canada and the Top 10 of the Australian album charts. The track "[[Linchpin (song)|Linchpin]]" reached the Mainstream Rock Top 40.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A remix of "Invisible Wounds" was included on the ''[[Resident Evil (2002 film)|Resident Evil]]'' film soundtrack, and an instrumental digipak bonus track called "Full Metal Contact" was originally written for the video game, ''[[Demolition Racer]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A VHS/DVD release called ''[[Digital Connectivity]]'', which documents each of the four album periods of the band via interviews, live clips, music videos and tour/studio footage, was released in January 2002.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Although ''Digimortal'' had a successful start, the sales did not reach the levels of ''Obsolete'' and the band received little tour support. The direction of the album coupled with strong personal differences between some of the band members created a rift that escalated to the point where Bell announced his exit in March 2002. The band disbanded immediately thereafter; its publicists said this was "largely because vocalist Burton C. Bell is tired of playing angry, aggressive music and wants to form a band that's more indie-rock-oriented".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In a final collaboration, the group recorded two songs for the video game ''[[The Terminator: Dawn of Fate]]'' that month.<ref name="shuttingdown">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452793/fear-factory-shutting-down.jhtml |title=Fear Factory Shutting Down |publisher=MTV |access-date=September 26, 2015}}</ref> Fear Factory's contractual obligations remained unfulfilled, however, and Roadrunner did not release them without controversially issuing the ''Concrete'' album in 2002 and the [[B-side]]s and rarities compilation, ''[[Hatefiles]]'', in 2003.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} During his time away from Fear Factory, Bell with [[John Bechdel]] started a side project called [[Ascension of the Watchers]], which released its first EP, ''Iconoclast'', independently via their online store in 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Over time, tensions within the band developed between Dino Cazares and the other members, particularly Burton C. Bell and Raymond Herrera. When asked about the breakup in May 2002, Cazares made claims and allegations against Bell and the other members, stating that Fear Factory could continue without Christian Olde Wolbers and that he and Raymond Herrera were primarily motivated by money.<ref name="Blab1">{{cite web |author= Krgin, Borivoj |url= http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=3437 |title= EXCLUSIVE: DINO CAZARES Speaks Out On FEAR FACTORY Split – May 13, 2002 |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> Herrera responded to these allegations on behalf of the other band members, saying that Cazares was motivated by money and emphasizing Olde Wolbers' influence on the band's sound.<ref name="Blab2">{{cite web |author= Krgin, Borivoj |url= http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=359 |title= Ex-FEAR FACTORY Drummer RAYMOND HERRERA: "DINO CAZARES Is Just A Bitter, Bitter, Fat Man" – May 20, 2002 |date = December 24, 2001|access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= [[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> According to Herrera, the other band members would often come up with new ideas they wanted to incorporate into Fear Factory's sound, but their suggestions were dismissed or openly ridiculed by Cazares, causing a rift between him and the other members that ultimately led to the band's breakup.  In the same interview, Herrera also revealed that Cazares had attempted to control the direction of the band by manipulating their business management and record company, and had openly lied to the other members about his actions.<ref>{{cite web|title=FEAR FACTORY's HERRERA: We're Better Off Without DINO CAZARES|date = May 2, 2003|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=11702|publisher=BlabberMouth}}</ref>

Herrera and Olde Wolbers reunited later in 2002 and laid the foundations for the return of Fear Factory.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Cazares was then permanently out of the band. Bell was approached with their demo recordings and was impressed enough to rejoin the band and Fear Factory was re-formed.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Olde Wolbers switched to guitar and [[Byron Stroud]] of [[Strapping Young Lad]] was approached to join the band as a bassist.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} He was a member from 2003 until 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Cazares continued recording and performing with his side project called [[Asesino]], a Mexican [[deathgrind]] band. In 2007, he also started a new group called [[Divine Heresy]].

Fear Factory made its live return as the mystery band at the Australian [[Big Day Out]] festival in January 2004, followed by its first American shows since re-forming on the spring [[Jägermeister]] tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Chimaira]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The new lineup's first album ''[[Archetype (Fear Factory album)|Archetype]]'' was released on April 20, 2004, through new record label [[Liquid 8 Records]] based in [[Minnesota]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} With ''Archetype'', Fear Factory returned to an alternative, industrial, metal sound; the album is generally considered{{By whom|date=July 2017}} to be a strong 'return-to-form' record, if not a particularly innovative effort, with most of the trademark elements of the band firmly in place.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Videos were shot for the songs "[[Cyberwaste]]", "[[Archetype (Fear Factory song)|Archetype]]", and "Bite the Hand That Bleeds"; the latter featured on the [[Saw (soundtrack)|''Saw'' film soundtrack]]. The band performed on further tours with [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] in the US and with [[Mnemic]] in Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The new Fear Factory has largely abandoned the direct "Man versus Machine" theme prevalent on earlier releases in favor of subjects such as religion, war, and [[corporatism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

{{Main|Transgression (album)}}
Fear Factory announced plans to record and release its next full-length album over a very short period of time with mainstream rock producer [[Toby Wright]], who had worked with [[Korn]] and [[Alice in Chains]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This was allegedly due to pressure from Fear Factory's new label [[Calvin Records]], which preponed the album's release date from four months away to just a month and a half so the band would have a new album to support on the inaugural [[Gigantour]], which they had been invited to participate on by [[Dave Mustaine]].<ref name="Utopia">{{cite web |author= Yates, Rod |url= http://www.utopia.com.au/pages/interviews/interview-fearfactory.php |title= Fear Factory |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= Utopia Records, Australia |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062533/http://www.utopia.com.au/pages/interviews/interview-fearfactory.php |archive-date= September 28, 2011 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

The resulting album, ''Transgression'', was released on August 22, 2005, in the United Kingdom, and on the following day in North America, almost a year after ''Archetype''. The album garnered highly polarized reviews; some critics hailed the album as diverse and progressive, and other reviewers did not receive the record very well.<ref name="MF">{{cite web |author= Milburn, Simon |url=  http://www.themetalforge.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=596 |title= FEAR FACTORY: Undercurrent |access-date= March 15, 2007 |publisher= The Metal Forge}}</ref> Although the album starts off as a Fear Factory record, subsequent songs include mellow/alt-rock numbers "Echo of My Scream" (featuring [[Faith No More]]'s [[Billy Gould]] on bass) and "New Promise", a [[pop-rock]] song "Supernova", and a faithful cover of U2's rock song "[[I Will Follow]]".<ref name="Decibel">{{cite web |author= Terry, Nick |url= http://decibelmagazine.com/features/oct2005/fear_factory.aspx |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20051129013525/http://decibelmagazine.com/features/oct2005/fear_factory.aspx |archive-date= November 29, 2005 |title= Fear Factory |access-date= March 14, 2007 |publisher= [[Decibel magazine]]}}</ref>

In 2013, Wolbers posted more details about writing and recording of Transgression and Archetype on his Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=490163041030854&id=281907298680&comment_id=5372926&offset=0&total_comments=58 |title=Damn i havent heard this album in 7... – Christian Olde Wolbers |publisher=Facebook |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> He said he was disappointed with ''Transgression'', calling it half-finished, and blamed the label for the severe time constraints imposed during the recording sessions and for the inclusion of the U2 cover.<ref name="Utopia" /> However, Burton C.

During 2005 and 2006, Fear Factory promoted the album on the "Fifteen Years of Fear" world tour in celebration of their fifteenth anniversary.

===Hiatus and other projects (2006–2008)===

Rather than begin work on a new studio album, the band members briefly parted and began working with other projects. Bell contributed vocals to the songs "End of Days, Pt.1", "End of Days, Pt. 2", and "Die in a Crash" on [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]'s 2007 album ''[[The Last Sucker]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/burton_c_bell_talks_about_involvement_with_ministry.html|title=Burton C Bell Talks About Involvement With Ministry|publisher=UltimateGuitar}}</ref> and later toured with Ministry in support of the album.

On April 8, 2009, Bell and Cazares announced the reconciliation of their friendship, and the formation of a new project with Byron Stroud on bass and drummer [[Gene Hoglan]] of [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Strapping Young Lad]], [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], and [[Dethklok]].

In June 2009, Wolbers and Herrera spoke about the issue on the radio program ''Speed Freaks''. Herrera said he and Wolbers were still in the band. "[Christian and I] are actually still in Fear Factory&nbsp;...&nbsp;[Burton and Dino] decided to start a new band, and furthermore, they decided to call it Fear Factory.

Bell and Cazares later spoke about their reasons for excluding Herrera and Wolbers. Cazares said Bell wanted to reunite the classic Fear Factory lineup of himself, Cazares, Herrera, and Wolbers, but that Herrera and Wolbers refused to be part of any reunion with Cazares.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/dino_cazares_what_we_are_doing_now_is_traditional_fear_factory_sound.html |title=Dino Cazares: 'What We Are Doing Now Is Traditional Fear Factory Sound' &#124; Interviews @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |access-date=August 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801170315/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/dino_cazares_what_we_are_doing_now_is_traditional_fear_factory_sound.html |archive-date=August 1, 2010 }}</ref> Bell also said he wanted to fire the band's manager Christy Priske, who was also Wolbers' wife, and Herrera and Wolbers refused.

During an interview on June 23, 2009, Cazares said he could never have a working relationship with Raymond and Wolbers again, saying they were too money-driven and criticized the music they recorded on ''Archetype'' for being too similar to the band's earlier output. Despite ongoing issues between the two parties, the new Fear Factory went ahead with the recording process. In late July 2009, a short video shot with a cell telephone showed Cazares recording drum tracks with longtime contributor Rhys Fulber.

===Hiatus and lawsuits (2016–2019)===

{{ods|date=March 2021}}


In a November 2016 interview with ''[[Loudwire]]'', guitarist [[Dino Cazares]] revealed that Fear Factory had planned to release their tenth studio album in mid-to-late 2017. He stated, "Right now we're going to be home and doing a new record. We're writing already and in the process of doing a new record, but it probably won't be out until late summer of next year or maybe even October. I'm not exactly sure."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/dino-cazares-fear-factory-eye-late-summer-2017-new-album/ |title=Dino Cazares: Fear Factory Eye Late Summer 2017 for New Album |publisher=[[Loudwire]] |date=November 30, 2016 |access-date=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

In a December 2016 interview with The Ex-Man, despite an ongoing "huge legal battle" with Bell and Cazares, former bassist-guitarist [[Christian Olde Wolbers]] stated that he was "trying to reach out and try to get this reunion thing happening." He added, "There would be nothing better for this band [than] to reconcile our differences, fucking write a killer record, which I know we can, and fucking we would be doing really big tours. My passion for playing and what we have invested in this band is very big, and I know it's really big for Dino as well, 'cause he started it with [[Raymond Herrera|Raymond]] back in the day."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ex-fear-factory-bassist-christian-olde-wolbers-says-he-has-been-trying-to-reunite-bands-classic-lineup/ |title=Ex-Fear Factory Bassist Christian Olde Wolbers Says He Has Been Trying To Reunite Band's Classic Lineup |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=December 23, 2016 |access-date=December 31, 2016}}</ref> More fuel to the possibility of a reunion with the "classic" lineup of Bell, Cazares, Herrera and Wolbers was added later that month, when Wolbers posted an image on his [[Instagram]] account, suggesting Fear Factory's official website was "under construction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2016/12/29/news/fear-factory-classic-lineup-reunion-may-works/ |title=Fear Factory 'Classic' Lineup Reunion May Be in the Works |publisher=theprp.com |date=December 29, 2016 |access-date=December 31, 2016}}</ref>

On May 7, 2017, Wolbers posted a blank picture on his Instagram (which was later deleted), claiming that Fear Factory had broken up. Later that day, Cazares was asked via Twitter if they were still together, and his response was, "Not sure why your asking that and rant by who?".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2017/05/08/news/ex-bassist-claims-fear-factory-broken/ |title=Ex-Bassist Claims Fear Factory Have Broken Up |publisher=theprp.com |date=May 8, 2017 |access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/community_feed/fear_factorys_former_bassist_claims_that_the_band_has_broken_up.html |title=Fear Factory's Former Bassist Claims That The Band Has Broken Up |publisher=ultimate-guitar.com |date=May 8, 2017 |access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref>

In an interview with Kilpop in May 2017, Burton C. Bell said that the new songs were "even stronger than ''Genexus'', 'cause it just seems even more tight.

=== Split with Burton C. Bell, ''Aggression Continuum'' and new vocalist (2020–present) ===
On September 2, 2020, Dino Cazares announced he would be releasing new Fear Factory music in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Kennelty|url=https://metalinjection.net/upcoming-releases/fear-factory-to-release-new-music-in-2021|title=FEAR FACTORY to Release New Music in 2021|publisher=Metal Injection|access-date=September 3, 2020|date=September 3, 2020}}</ref> Less than a month later, Burton C. Bell announced he quit Fear Factory citing "consistent series of dishonest representations and unfounded accusations from past and present band members", leaving no original members left in the band besides Cazares. However, Bell's contributions to their upcoming album will remain, as he recorded his vocals in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/burton-c-bell-officially-quits-fear-factory-i-cannot-align-myself-with-someone-whom-i-do-not-trust-nor-respect/|title=BURTON C.

In an interview with [[Robb Flynn]] on September 28, 2020, which took place within hours after Bell announced his departure from Fear Factory, Cazares claimed that he was not aware of the split until he "found out [about it] via social media." He also claimed that one of the reasons behind Bell's departure was not only due to the lawsuit that prevented the release of the band's new album, but because the latter's portion of the Fear Factory "trademark ownership became available", which left Cazares as the sole owner of the band name. Cazares reiterated that Bell's vocals will appear on the new album, which was being mixed by [[Andy Sneap]] for a March 2021 release, and hoped the pair would continue to work together in order to support it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dino-cazares-found-out-via-social-media-that-burton-c-bell-was-leaving-fear-factory/|title=DINO CAZARES 'Found Out Via Social Media' That BURTON C.

In terms of influences on the group's work, Dino Cazares has cited the band members' interests in fantasy and science fiction alternative universes such as the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' mythos]] as well as the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' mythos]]. As a specific example, their debut album, ''[[Soul of a New Machine]]'', picked up its name directly from a line in a movie critic review of the ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' film (discussing the [[T-1000]] [[villain]]). Cazares has also cited recurring influences on Fear Factory coming from conventional [[popular music]], outside of the genres of hard rock and heavy metal, for instance looking to singer-songwriter [[Paul McCartney]]'s sounds in both [[The Beatles]] and [[Wings (band)|Wings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/dino_cazares_of_fear_factory/|title=Dino Cazares of Fear Factory : Songwriter Interviews|website=www.songfacts.com|access-date=July 18, 2017}}</ref> Over the years the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' has become a recurring theme as the band often makes lyrical reference to the plot, as well as directly quote and sample lines from the film.

Fear Factory's innovative approach towards and hybridization of the genres industrial metal, death metal, and alternative metal has had a lasting impact on other artists coming later, the band putting a stamp on metal music ever since the release of their first album in 1992. Fear Factory is noteworthy among contemporaries for its lyrical focus on science fiction, with much of the band's music telling a single story spanning several concept albums. The band has been called a "stepping stone",<ref name="UGO">{{cite web |url= http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=fearfactory&cat=metal |title= Why we like 'em |access-date= March 15, 2007 |publisher= UGO.com |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012133805/http://ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=fearfactory&cat=metal |archive-date= October 12, 2007 }}</ref> leading mainstream listeners to venture into less-known, more extreme bands, and are consistently appreciated.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Bell's vocals and Machine Head have been wrongly credited for the vocal style.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Mark Hunter said Chimaira's drumming was heavily influenced by Raymond Herrera. [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Killswitch Engage]], [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], [[Static-X]], and [[Coal Chamber]] have also mentioned Fear Factory in their liner notes.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
