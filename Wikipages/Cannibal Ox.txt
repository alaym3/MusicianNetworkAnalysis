'''Cannibal Ox''' is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo from [[Harlem]], [[New York City|New York]], United States. It consists of [[Vast Aire]] and [[Vordul Mega]], often accompanied by DJ Cip-One.

==History==
In 2001, Cannibal Ox released their first album ''[[The Cold Vein]]'' on [[Definitive Jux]], which was the label's first full-length studio album. ''The Cold Vein'' received positive reviews from critics and put the duo in the underground hip hop spotlight, and has since been described as one of the best rap albums of the 2000s.<ref>[http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1430 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113165219/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1430 |date=November 13, 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://blog.rhapsody.com/2009/10/hiphopdecade.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924071122/http://blog.rhapsody.com/2009/10/hiphopdecade.html |date=September 24, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2003, the group was rumored to have disbanded. However, fellow Definitive Jux rapper [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]] said "Can Ox is not broken up, it's just a rumor" between tracks on fellow Definitive Jux rapper [[Aesop Rock]]'s album ''[[Bazooka Tooth]]''.

November 2005 brought the release of the live album ''[[Return of the Ox: Live at CMJ]]'' with a statement in the liner notes hinting at a Cannibal Ox LP to be released summer of 2006. Supposedly, [[RZA]], [[Pete Rock]] and [[El-P]] were set to contribute. However, the alleged album was never released.

In March 2007, El-P answered "I really doubt it" when asked if a new Cannibal Ox album was coming out anytime in the near future.<ref name=rwd2>[http://www.canibringmygat.com/2007/03/14/an-interview-with-el-p/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930181901/http://www.canibringmygat.com/2007/03/14/an-interview-with-el-p/ |date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref>
That same year, Vast Aire confirmed that he was no longer working with Definitive Jux, that he left [[The Weathermen (hip hop group)|The Weathermen]], and that plans for a new Cannibal Ox LP were scrapped. He cited creative and financial differences with El-P and Definitive Jux as well as Vordul's alleged clinical depression.<ref name=rewd-dewd>{{cite web|url=http://www.twincitieshiphop.com/viewtopic.php?p=662&sid=892f287c051f70b5407957bf2ec355f3 |accessdate=April 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201063003/http://www.twincitieshiphop.com/viewtopic.php?p=662&sid=892f287c051f70b5407957bf2ec355f3 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 }}</ref>

In January 2008, Vast Aire plugged a project entitled Mighty Joseph with rapper Karniege and spoke about future projects in the works. When asked about his relationship with Vordul, he confirmed Vordul as a feature on his upcoming solo LP ''Deuces Wild''. Vast Aire was later featured on Vordul's album ''Megagraphitti''.<ref name=rwd>[http://www.basementflavor.com/interview/interview-with-the-one-and-only-vast-aire/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021085104/http://www.basementflavor.com/interview/interview-with-the-one-and-only-vast-aire/ |date=October 21, 2009 }}</ref>

After many requests for him to produce a second Can Ox album, El-P stated on May 28, 2011 via his Facebook page that "there wont ever be a can ox album produced by me again and thats a fact."<ref>{{cite web|title=El-P Facebook|url=http://www.facebook.com/THEREALELP/posts/205466752822864|publisher=Facebook.com|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref>

On May 31, 2011 Vast Aire released a solo record titled ''Ox 2010: A Street Odyssey''.
