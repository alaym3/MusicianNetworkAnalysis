'''Patricia Smyth''' (born June 26, 1957) is an American [[singing|singer]] and [[songwriter]]. She first came into national attention with the rock band [[Scandal (American band)|Scandal]] and went on to record and perform as a solo artist. Her distinctive voice and [[New wave music|new wave]] image gained broad exposure through video recordings aired on cable music video channels such as [[MTV]]. Her debut solo album ''[[Never Enough (Patty Smyth album)|Never Enough]]'' was well received, and generated a pair of [[Billboard Hot 100|Top 100]] hits. In the early 1990s she reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|Top 10]] with the hit single "[[Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough]]," a duet with [[Don Henley]] of [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. She performed and co-wrote with [[James Ingram]] the song "Look What Love Has Done" for the 1994 motion picture ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]''. The work earned her a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]], as well as an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. Smyth married retired tennis player [[John McEnroe]] in 1997.

==Musical career==
===With Scandal===
{{main article|Scandal (American band)}}
After growing up in the [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood of [[Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn|Gerritsen Beach]], Smyth joined Scandal as [[lead vocalist]] in 1981. The band released a  [[Scandal (EP)|self-titled debut EP]] the next year. Featuring the song "[[Goodbye to You (Scandal song)|Goodbye to You]]," it went on to become [[Columbia Records]]' biggest selling [[Extended play|EP]]. In 1984, they put out their follow-up, ''[[Warrior (Scandal album)|Warrior]]''. Buoyed by [[MTV]] airplay, the album peaked at No. 17 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, and the first song off the release, also titled "[[The Warrior (song)|The Warrior]]," was a Top 10 hit. However, despite their success, internal strife within the band led to their break-up soon afterwards.

===Solo career===
Following the end of Scandal, Smyth was invited by her friend [[Eddie Van Halen]] to join the band [[Van Halen]] to replace [[David Lee Roth]] as lead singer. However, she declined the offer, because she was eight months pregnant and "It was just not the right time for me," she says now. "I was a New Yorker, I didn't want to live in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] ... and those guys were drunk and fighting all the time." She guest-appeared on [[the Hooters]] 1985 album ''[[Nervous Night (album)|Nervous Night]]'' on the song "Where Do the Children Go" as an accompanying vocalist.

Smyth released her first solo album, ''[[Never Enough (Patty Smyth album)|Never Enough]],'' in 1987. It contained her version of the [[Tom Waits]] song "[[Downtown Train]]," which [[Rod Stewart]] would make a hit three years later, and the title track "Never Enough," which was co-written with members of the Hooters and based on a song of the same title that Hooters members [[Eric Bazilian]] and [[Rob Hyman]] had written for their earlier band, Baby Grand. She put out another solo effort in 1992, the eponymous ''[[Patty Smyth (album)|Patty Smyth]].'' Off of that effort, she secured a hit [[gramophone record|record]] via a [[duet (music)|duet]] with [[Don Henley]] of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], titled "[[Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough]]." This peaked at No. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]] for sales of 500,000. The album, also certified gold, featured an additional US [[Top 40]] hit with "No Mistakes" and also spawned the minor hit "I Should Be Laughing." Smyth had previously recorded with Henley as a backing singer on several songs on his albums ''[[Building the Perfect Beast]]'' and ''[[The End of the Innocence (album)|The End of the Innocence]].''

Smyth subsequently co-wrote the 1994 song "Look What Love Has Done," nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and an [[Academy Award]] after its inclusion in the soundtrack to the feature film ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]].'' Further soundtrack commissions resulted in her writing and composing the [[theme tune]], "Wish I Were You," to the 1998 feature film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]].'' (Her husband, John McEnroe, claimed in his autobiography<ref>McEnroe, J., & Kaplan, J. (2003). ''You Cannot Be Serious,'' Berkley Trade, {{ISBN|978-0-425-19008-1}}</ref> that she was inspired to write the song by his own attempt at a musical career; she was struck by his excitement at playing music, when her own feelings about the music industry were much more ambivalent.)

In 2015, to promote the release of her [[Christmas]] album called ''Come On December,'' she crowd-funded a campaign to support the ''Headstrong Project'' with all the money raised on the pre-orders of her album going to the non-profit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/pattysmyth |title=Patty Smyth Come On December on PledgeMusic |work=Pledge Music |access-date=2016-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802131108/http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/pattysmyth |archive-date=2017-08-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album featured the single "Broken," and the music video for the single was released just before [[Veterans Day]], and was filmed on the grounds of a [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] chapter. The album was released on November 20, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/patty-smyth-new-video-broken-veterans-day |title=Patty Smyth Releases 'Broken,' New Song, for Veteran's Day |work=People.com |access-date=2016-01-08}}</ref>

===Reunion with Scandal===
In 2004, [[VH1]] recruited Smyth and the surviving members of Scandal for a ''[[Bands Reunited]]'' episode, resulting in a small reunion tour of concerts on the [[East Coast of the United States]] in 2005. The next year, Columbia/Legacy released a new Scandal [[compilation album|compilation]] CD as part of the ''We Are the '80s'' series. The compilation contained three unreleased tracks from the 1982 recording sessions ("Grow So Wise", "If You Love Me", "I'm Here Tonight") as well as "All My Life," previously available on the [[A-side and B-side|flip side]] of "Goodbye to You". In July 2008, ''Billboard'' reported the upcoming release of new music by the band<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044833/patty-smyth-scandal-to-reunite-record |title=Patty Smyth, Scandal to Reunite, Record |work=Billboard  |access-date=2012-04-25}}</ref> (featuring original members Keith Mack and Benjy King). They debuted their first single as a band ("Hard for You to Love Me," also referred to as "Make It Hard") in over 24 years on January 17, 2009 in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].

==Personal life==
Smyth has a daughter, Ruby, with her first husband [[Richard Hell]]. She met [[John McEnroe]] in 1993; their daughter Anna was born in 1995, and the couple married in 1997. They have since had another daughter, Ava.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/patty-smyth-and-john-mcenroe-still-rockin-vol-71-no-11/ | title=Patty Smyth and John McEnroe Still Rockin' | work=People | access-date=2017-05-07}}</ref>
