'''Donald Henry''' "'''Pee Wee'''" '''Gaskins Jr.''' (born '''Donald Henry Parrott Jr.'''; March 13, 1933 – September 6, 1991) was an American [[serial killer]] and [[rapist]] from [[South Carolina]] who stabbed, shot, drowned and poisoned more than a dozen people.

==Early life==
Donald Henry Gaskins was born in [[Florence County, South Carolina|Florence County]], [[South Carolina]], to Eulea Parrott,{{sfn|Query|2014|p=3}} the last in a string of [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate children]]. Gaskins was small for his age and immediately gained the nickname "Pee Wee." As an adult, he was between {{cvt|5|ft|4|in}} and {{cvt|5|ft|5|in}} and weighed approximately {{cvt|130|lb}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/my-brother-the-killerwhats-it-like-to-have-a-mass-murderer-in-your-family-6411678|title=My Brother the Killer: What's it Like to Have a Mass Murderer in Your Family?|newspaper=[[Phoenix New Times]]|date=September 25, 1991|author=Paul Rubin|access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestate.com/news/special-reports/state-125/article44056854.html|title=South Carolina's infamous serial killer, "Pee Wee" Gaskins|newspaper=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|date=December 16, 2015|author=Clif LeBlanc}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://the-line-up.com/donald-henry-gaskins|title=Donald Henry Gaskins: The "Pee Wee" Killer|website=The Line Up|date=April 17, 2019|access-date=August 12, 2020|language=en}}</ref>

Gaskins' early life was characterized by a great deal of [[Child neglect|neglect]] from his mother and [[child abuse|abuse]] by a male relative. His mother apparently took so little interest in him that the first time he learned his given name—Donald—was when it was read out in his first court appearance.{{sfn|Greig|2005|p=130}} Gaskins was often described as a great manipulator and [[con artist]] who was "street smart", and with "a keen sense of humor and a friendly, entertaining personality."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Beaty|first=James|date=July 8, 1991|title=Gaskins, 'Boss Hog' of death row, a complex man|work=The Times and Democrat (Orangeburg, South Carolina)|url=https://www.newspapers.com|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref> 

When he was one year old, Gaskins reportedly drank a bottle of [[kerosene]] which caused him to have convulsions until he was aged 3. In adolescence, Gaskins engaged in a violent crime spree with a group of fellow delinquents which included [[burglaries]], [[assault (crime)|assault]]s, and a [[gang rape]]. At age 13, Gaskins was convicted for assaulting a young woman by hitting her in the head with an ax when she caught him breaking into her family home. He was sentenced to five years in a [[reform school]], the [https://www.state.sc.us/djj/history.php South Carolina Industrial School for White Boys] in [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]], where he was regularly [[rape]]d by his fellow inmates.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Allen|first=Ken|date=April 20, 1978|title=Mass Killer A 'Polite' Fellow Who Drove Hearse|work=The Charlotte Observer Piedmont Edition Section D|url=https://www.newspapers.com|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref>  

After escaping from the reform school, getting married and voluntarily returning to complete his sentence, Gaskins was released in 1951 at the age of 18. He briefly worked on a [[Plantation economy|tobacco plantation]] until he was arrested in 1953 for attacking a teenage girl with a hammer over an alleged insult. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment at the [[Central Correctional Institution|South Carolina Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|p=45}} There, Gaskins earned his fellow inmates' respect by killing the most feared man in the prison, Hazel Brazell, in what Gaskins claimed was [[self-defense]]. As a result, Gaskins received an extra three years in prison for [[Manslaughter (United States law)|involuntary manslaughter]], but from that point on he became the aggressor instead of the victim. He escaped from prison in 1955 by hiding in the back of a garbage truck and fled to [[Florida]], where he took employment with a traveling carnival.{{sfn|Lane|1995|pp=168-169}} He was re-arrested, [[remand (detention)|remand]]ed to custody, and [[parole]]d in August 1961.  

Following his release from prison, Gaskins reverted to committing burglaries and [[fence (criminal)|fencing]] stolen property. Two years after his parole, he was arrested for the rape of a twelve-year-old girl, but absconded while awaiting sentence.{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|p=76}} Gaskins was rearrested in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. He was paroled again in November 1968.{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|p=86}} Upon his release, Gaskins moved to the town of [[Sumter, South Carolina]], and began work with a roofing company.

==Murders==
Gaskins would claim his first non-prison-related murder victim was a blonde female [[hitchhiker]] whom he tortured and murdered in September 1969, before sinking her body in a swamp. In his [[memoir]]s, he claimed: "All I could think about is how I could do anything I wanted to her."{{sfn|Greig|2005|p=130}} This hitchhiker was to be the first of many he claimed to have picked up and killed while driving around the coastal highways of the [[American South]]. Gaskins classified these victims as "coastal kills": people, both male and female, whom he killed purely for pleasure, on average approximately once every six weeks, when he went hunting to quell his feelings of "bothersome-ness".{{sfn|Lane|1995|pp=168-169}} He would claim to have tortured and mutilated his victims while attempting to keep them alive for as long as possible. He confessed to killing these victims using a variety of methods including stabbing, [[Asphyxia|suffocation]], [[mutilation]], and even claimed to have [[Human cannibalism|cannibalized]] some of them.{{sfn|Lane|1995|pp=168-169}}

Gaskins later confessed to killing "eighty to ninety" such victims,{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|p=121}} although his claims to have committed any "coastal kills" have never been [[Corroborating evidence|corroborated]]. In his memoirs, Gaskins claims to have committed coastal kills every six weeks, yet contradicts this claim later in the book by stating he felt the overpowering need to seek out and commit a coastal kill by the tenth date of each calendar month.{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|pp=100 & 131}} He also specifically named three further individuals whom he classified among his "serious murders": an [[African-American]] couple he named as "Eddie and Bertie Brown" (aged 24 and 20 respectively) whom he claimed to have murdered in 1972 and buried "behind the Tenant House" (a location Gaskins failed to precisely pinpoint in his autobiography beyond once claiming was a "shortcut to go around Columbia"),{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|p=124}} and a man named Horace Jones (40), whom he claimed to have murdered in 1974.{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|pp=149-151}}

There is no evidence to support any of the claims made by Gaskins that he had committed any murders other than that of Hazel Brazell and the fourteen victims listed below, whose bodies have been found and identified, and whose law enforcement records and Gaskins' sworn testimony substantiate.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Fowler|first=Peggy C.|title=Pee Wee: Serial Killer or Homicidal Maniac Volume II|publisher=AuthorHouse|others=Reprinted Transcripts of sworn testimony confirming a complete and truthful disclosure of all SC murders, by Ms. Peggy C.

===1970===
In November 1970, Gaskins committed the first of a series of confirmed murders, primarily people whom he knew and killed for personal reasons. His first confirmed victims were his own niece, Janice Kirby (aged 15), and her friend, Patricia Ann Alsbrook (aged 17), both of whom he beat to death. He claimed he was enraged at their drug abuse, while others say he was attempting to [[sexual assault|sexually assault]] them in Sumter.'''{{sfn|Lane|1995|pp=168-169}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Adams|first=Jerry|date=November 11, 1976|title=Patty Alsbrook Buried Today, But Reason She Died Remains Mystery|work=The Item (Sumter, South Carolina)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/669839177/?terms=%22The%20Sumter%20Daily%22%20Alsbrook&match=1|access-date=May 15, 2021}}</ref>'''

===1973=== 
Pee Wee Gaskins was an overt racist and he drowned '''Doreen Hope Dempsey''', aged 22, and her two-year old daughter, '''Robin Michelle Dempsey''' in June 1973. Gaskins had befriended Doreen Dempsey several years prior and was angry upon hearing she had become pregnant a second time with an African American man. She had been living with Gaskins' friend Johnny Sellers and his brother Carl Sellers in North Charleston, SC. They brought her to Gaskins' home in Prospect, and left her there to speak with Gaskins about staying with him for a short time while she was pregnant. Upset that Doreen was having a second biracial child, Gaskins responded by walking her to his backyard pond where he drowned both the mother and her toddler.<ref name=":0" />

===1974===
In June 1974, Gaskins shot his friend and criminal associate '''Johnny Sellers''', aged 36 in the back of the head, and stabbed to death Gaskins' ex-girlfriend '''Jessie Ruth Judy''', aged 22, after Sellers asked for money he was owed from the sale of a stolen boat. Gaskins feared Sellers would reveal Pee Wee Gaskins was also involved in an auto theft ring. Jessie Judy was murdered at the same time because she could have told police about Gaskins' criminal activities, including murdering her boyfriend, Johnny Sellers.<ref name=":0" />

===1975===
'''Silas Barnwell Yates''', age 45, was murdered in February 1975, by either a karate chop to his neck or a slit throat in a murder-for-hire scheme. The forensics alleged it was by knife, but Gaskins disputed the claim. Yates was in a dispute with his ex-girlfriend, Suzanne Kipper Owens, and she and her husband John Owens paid Gaskins $1,500 to murder Yates.<ref name=":0" />

'''Diane Bellamy Neeley''', age 25, was separated from her husband Walter Neeley, who was one of Pee Wee Gaskins closest friends and criminal co-conspirator. On April 10, 1975, Gaskins stabbed to death Dianne Bellamy and shot dead her boyfriend '''Avery Leroy Howard''', aged 34. Among other reasons, Gaskins murdered Dianne Bellamy because she had threatened to report to police that Gaskins was allowing underage teenagers to have sex in his home.  Avery Howard was murdered because he asked for money to pay attorneys and cover legal expenses following his arrest for fraud and auto theft. Gaskins worried Avery Howard would tell police about Gaskins' criminal activities.<ref name=":0" /> 

'''Kim Ghelkins''', age 13, was stabbed to death to keep her from telling police Gaskins had moved her from North Charleston without permission, and to keep her from telling police she was being sexually abused by several adult men, including Gaskins.<ref name=":0" />

'''Dennis Bellamy''', aged 27 and '''John Henry Knight''', age 15, were half-brothers, and Dianne Bellamy was their sister. Within minutes of each other, Gaskins shot the two brothers in the back of the head on October 10, 1975.  Pee Wee Gaskins had promised to pay Dennis Bellamy for some stolen guns. When confronted by Bellamy at Gaskin's trailer home in Prospect, SC, he responded by offering to return the guns from the woods behind his home. He took Bellamy into the woods to retrieve the guns, but murdered him instead. John Henry Knight was directed to the same area, allegedly to meet his brother, but was also murdered to ensure he could never speak of the crimes.<ref name=":0" />

==Final arrest==
[[File:Gaskins.jpg|thumb|Gaskins identifies a burial site in the Prospect Community to investigators with the Florence County Sheriff's Office and State Law Enforcement Division.]]
Gaskins was arrested on November 14, 1975, when a criminal associate named Walter Neeley confessed to police that he had knowledge of Gaskins killing Dennis Bellamy, aged 28, and Johnny Knight, aged 15.{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|p=181}} Neeley confessed to police that Gaskins had confided in him to having killed several people who had been listed as [[missing person]]s during the previous five years, and had indicated to him where they were buried. On December 4, 1975, Neeley led police to land near Gaskins home in [[Prospect, South Carolina|Prospect]], where police discovered the bodies of eight of his victims.<ref>{{cite news|first=Margaret|last=O'Shea|title=Letter denies most killings|date=Sep 7, 1991|url=http://thedonaldhpeeweegaskinspage.com/Newspaper3.html|newspaper=The State|access-date=Sep 27, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007065940/http://thedonaldhpeeweegaskinspage.com/Newspaper3.html|archive-date=Oct 7, 2008}}</ref>

==Imprisonment and execution==
Gaskins was tried on one charge of murder on May 24, 1976,{{sfn|Lane|1995|pp=168-169}} found guilty on May 28 and [[sentenced to death]], which was later [[Pardon|commuted]] to [[life in prison]] when the [[South Carolina General Assembly]]'s 1974 ruling on capital punishment was changed to conform to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] guidelines for the death penalty in other states.<ref name=Shuler>Shuler, Rita. 2006. Carolina Crimes: Case Files of a Forensic Photographer. The History Press: Charleston, SC.</ref>

On September 2, 1982, Gaskins committed another murder, for which he earned the title of the "Meanest Man in America". While incarcerated in the high security block at the [[South Carolina Penitentiary|South Carolina Correctional Institution]], Gaskins killed a [[death row]] inmate named Rudolph Tyner, who had received his sentence for killing an elderly couple during a bungled armed [[robbery]] of their store in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina.<ref name=":1" /> Gaskins was [[Contract killing|hired]] to commit this murder by Tony Cimo, the son of Tyner's victims.{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|p=204}}

Gaskins initially made several unsuccessful attempts to kill Tyner by lacing his food and drink with poison before he opted to use explosives to kill him. To accomplish this, Gaskins rigged a device similar to a [[portable radio]] in Tyner's cell and told Tyner this would allow them to "communicate between cells".{{sfn|Gaskins|1993|p=204}} When Tyner followed Gaskins' instructions to hold a speaker (laden with [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4 plastic explosive]], unbeknownst to him) to his ear at an agreed time, Gaskins detonated the explosives from his cell and killed Tyner.<ref name=Shuler/> He later said, "The last thing he [Tyner] heard was me laughing." Gaskins was tried for Tyner's murder and sentenced to death. It was the first time in the history of South Carolina that a white man was sentenced to death for the murder of a black man.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/us/columbia-journal-prison-lures-them-in-as-tourists.html|title=Columbia Journal; Prison Lures Them In (as Tourists)|newspaper=The New York Times|date=Feb 22, 1994|access-date=Dec 15, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

While on death row, Gaskins claimed to having committed between 100 and 110 murders,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crime.about.com/od/serial/p/gaskins3.htm|title=Donald "Pee Wee" Gaskins - Part 3|website=[[Dotdash|About.com]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222041713/http://crime.about.com/od/serial/p/gaskins3.htm|archive-date=Feb 22, 2017}}</ref> including that of Margaret "Peg" Cuttino, the 13-year-old daughter of then South Carolina State Senator James Cuttino Jr. of Sumter. These murders have been widely disputed and there has been no evidence to support Gaskins' claims. 

Of the 14 confirmed murders, he received nine life sentences for murdering nine people: Doreen Hope Dempsey, Robin Michelle Dempsey, Johnny Sellers, Jessie Ruth Judy, Barnwell Yates, Diane Bellamy Neeley, Avery Leroy Howard, Jr., Dennis Bellamy and John Henry Knight. 

He received two death sentences: one for killing Dennis Bellamy that was overturned by the state Supreme Court and the other for killing Rudolph Tyner. 

Gaskins led police to the bodies of four victims he admitted to killing. He was never tried for their murders after police recovered the bodies of Janice Kirby, Patricia Ann Allsbrook, Martha Ann Dicks (Clyde), and Kim Ghelkins.

Gaskins was executed on September 6, 1991, at 1:10&nbsp;a.m. in the [[electric chair]],<ref name=Shuler/> hours after he tried to kill himself by slitting his wrists. His last words were: "I'll let my lawyers talk for me. I'm ready to go."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prolifickillers.wordpress.com/2010/06/20/profile-of-an-american-serial-killer-pee-wee-gaskins-2/|title=Profile of an American Serial Killer: Pee Wee Gaskins|date=Jun 20, 2010}}</ref>
