==History==

=== Background and formation ===
All members of SuperM came from existing boy groups under [[SM Entertainment]]. [[Lee Tae-min|Taemin]] had been an active artist since the age of 14 when he debuted as a member of [[Shinee]] in May 2008.<ref name="time"/> [[Baekhyun]] and [[Kai (entertainer, born 1994)|Kai]] debuted as members of [[Exo (group)|Exo]] in April 2012. For Exo's sub-unit activities, both Baekhyun and Kai were members of the Korean sub-unit Exo-K in April 2012. Baekhyun also became a member of the R&B-oriented sub-unit trio [[Exo-CBX]] in October 2016. [[Lee Tae-yong|Taeyong]], [[Ten (singer)|Ten]], and [[Mark Lee (singer)|Mark]] debuted as members of [[NCT (band)|NCT]] in April 2016. [[Lucas Wong|Lucas]] debuted in January 2018 as a new member of NCT. For NCT sub-unit activities, Taeyong and Mark were added to NCT's Seoul-based sub-unit, [[NCT 127]], in July 2016. Mark also debuted as a member of NCT's former teen-aged sub-unit [[NCT Dream]] in August 2016. Ten and Lucas were added to NCT's China-based sub-unit, [[WayV]], in January 2019.

In 2019, before the official announcement of SuperM's debut, there had been rumors that [[SM Entertainment]] was planning to debut a "[[K-pop]] Super Boy Band".<ref name="members">{{cite web|last=정|first=지원|script-title=ko: [단독]엑소+샤이니+NCT 합쳤다…SM, 초특급 보이그룹 론칭|url=http://www.joynews24.com/view/1198843|date=August 2, 2019|website=JoyNews24|language=ko|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref> On August 7, 2019, Capitol Music Group chairman Steve Barnett and SM Entertainment founder [[Lee Soo-man]] officially announced the group as SuperM at Capitol Congress 2019.<ref name="background">{{cite web|last=Min|first=Kyung-won|script-title=ko:K-pop hops the pond to meet audiences abroad: As the local market floods with acts, groups aim to build success in the West|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3066835|date=August 17, 2019|publisher=KOREA JOONGANG DAILY|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref><ref name="background2">{{cite web|last=박|first=동선|script-title=ko:SM 'SuperM', 글로벌 관심 잇따라…美 포브스·빌보드&英 메트로 집중조명|url=http://www.etnews.com/20190809000320|date=August 9, 2019|website=ET News|language=ko|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref><ref name="background3">{{cite web |last=Herman|first=Tamar|script-title=ko:EXO, NCT 127, SHINee & WayV Members Unite for SuperM Supergroup Via Capitol Records & SM Entertainment|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8526798/exo-nct-127-shinee-wayv-superm-supergroup-capitol-congress|date=August 8, 2019|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref><ref name="background4">{{cite web|last=SHIN|first=Y|script-title=ko:NCT 127 Meets Katy Perry, HRVY, And More International Celebrities At Capitol Congress 2019|url=https://www.soompi.com/article/1344148wpp/nct-127-meets-katy-perry-hrvy-and-more-international-celebrities-at-capitol-congress-2019|date=August 8, 2019|website=Soompi|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref><ref name="background5">{{cite web|last=박|first=종서|script-title=ko:프로듀서 이수만의 초국적 프로젝트 ‘SuperM’...멤버들 능통 언어만 6개|url=http://www.newspim.com/news/view/20190816000864|date=August 17, 2019|website=Newspim|language=ko|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref> The "M" in SuperM stands for both Matrix and Master, with each member already an established star in their own bands.<ref name="meaning">{{cite web|last=Yim|first=Hyun-su|script-title=ko:'Avengers of K-pop': SHINee, Exo, NCT members team up in new SM supergroup|url=http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201908081442203830170_2|date=August 8, 2019|publisher=KPop Herald|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref><ref name="meaning2">{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hanna|script-title=ko:"The Avengers of K-pop" to debut in America|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/08/732_273608.html|date=August 8, 2019|work=[[The Korea Times]]|language=ko|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref> The teaser revealed the members of the group, with each having performance, vocal, and rap abilities.<ref name="member2">{{cite web|last=Benjamin|first=Jeff|script-title=ko:Super M, 'The Avengers Of K-Pop,' Unveiled By SM Entertainment And Capitol Music Group|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbenjamin/2019/08/07/super-m-the-avengers-of-k-pop-unveiled-by-sm-entertainment-and-capitol-music-group/#479be8bc6138|date=August 7, 2019|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref><ref name="member3">{{cite web|last=안|first=진용|script-title=ko:SM, 美 캐피톨 뮤직 그룹과 글로벌 프로젝트 ‘SuperM’ 론칭어|url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=20190808MW145905909355|date=August 8, 2019|website=Munhwa|language=ko|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref> Described as "the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] of K-pop," the group is focused more on performance-based music.<ref name="background3" /><ref name="latimes">{{cite web|access-date=May 1, 2020|title=Sold-out arenas, manic fandom: Will K-pop supergroup SuperM be the next BTS?|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-02-07/super-m-k-pop|date=February 7, 2020|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> SM A&R executive and director Chris Lee stated that the group was in the works for around a year, and felt the analogy to the Avengers was apt because according to him, "Each Avenger has their own group and [[Iron Man]] has his own movie and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] has his own, but together, they have an even greater synergy, so like that the members will pursue their own careers and own groups but also join together with synergy - a positive one."<ref name="background3" />

Audiences and followers had mixed opinions on the project at first, with some fans enthusiastic for the band's debut following the release of the first teaser at Capitol Congress 2019,<ref name=" video">{{cite web|last=송|first=오정|script-title=ko:슈퍼엠(SUPER M), 티저 영상 공개…뭘 좋아할지 몰라서 다 모아봤어|url=http://www.topstarnews.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=656133|date=August 8, 2019|website=Topstarnews|language=ko|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref> while others were concerned about SM Entertainment prioritizing their established groups, Exo members establishing solo careers before their [[conscription in South Korea|mandatory military service]], and the group debuting in the United States rather than starting with Korean promotions.<ref name="SplitSuperM">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3134610/k-pop-supergroup-superm-reactons-mixed/ |title=Why Are Fans Split Over K-Pop Supergroup SuperM? |last=Kelley |first=Caitlin |date=August 13, 2019 |website=[[MTV News]] |access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref><ref name="SuperMStans">{{cite web |url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2019/8/22/20827347/superm-kpop-sm-bts-exo-nct127-mtv-video-music-awards-blackpink |title=SuperM and the Futility of Trying to Win Over K-Pop Stans |last=Halliwell |first=Kate |date=August 22, 2019 |website=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] |access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref> Writing for [[MTV News]], Caitlin Kelley opines that "the biggest takeaway from the backlash is that it's not that easy to combine the powers of multiple fandoms," and felt that the group's structure might be complicated for American audiences, although she noted that "the fact that SuperM trended worldwide for several hours shows potential. That level of engagement means that there is widespread interest in the group — now it's just a matter of turning public opinion around."<ref name="SplitSuperM" /> Kate Halliwell of ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' wrote, "plenty of people support several groups within the K-pop genre at large, and it makes sense to target them whenever possible...but the toxic side of fandom is difficult to escape." She adds that the formation of the group "once again [proves] how online backlash is inevitable, and often overwhelming when it comes to navigating multiple K-pop fandoms at once," although she felt that the formation of the group "[signifies] a rising tide in Western K-pop demand."<ref name="SuperMStans" />
