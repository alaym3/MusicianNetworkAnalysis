==Music career==

===2013–2014: Career beginnings===
Circa late 2012 or early 2013,<ref name="noisey1"/> she began collaborating with producer [[Elliot Jacobson]],<ref name="noisey2"/> after Jacobson reached out to her on [[Twitter]].<ref name="noisey1"/> Vérité in turn started writing and recording music under the name Vérité, which translates in French to "truth".<ref name="noisey2"/> She eventually left her job in the food industry to work on her music full-time, after ten years waitressing, the last three of which were at [[Applebee's]] restaurant in [[Times Square]].<ref name="verg"/>

She started promoting her first single "Strange Enough" in July 2014.<ref name="vere"/> It also reached number one on [[Hype Machine]],<ref name="noisey1"/> with Vérité at the time keeping her real name hidden.<ref name="noisey2"/> The song was generally well received by critics,<ref name="vere"/> with ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' calling it a "scorching breakup anthem...  whose scathing chorus could burn any bad relationship with a vengeance."<ref name="verh"/> Casey Lewis of [[Noisey]] called it a "haunting, euphoric piece of [[electro-pop]]."<ref name="noisey2"/> 
 
Her second track "Weekend" was a "Pick of the Day" for the CDS Music Chart on August 26, 2014.<ref name="vere"/> She described "Weekend" as "written to be a snapshot of a moment. It's caught between the nostalgia of everything that was exhilarating and the reality of how temporary that elation can be."<ref name="veri"/> ''[[Interview Magazine]]'' called the track a "beautiful pop gem", where her vocals were "layered gorgeously into something that could perhaps be described as musical fairy dust.'"<ref name="veri"/>

===2014–2016: ''Echo'', ''Sentiment'' and ''Living''===
Her first live show as Vérité was at the New York [[Neon Gold Records|Neon Gold Popshop]].<ref name="noisey1"/> She went on to play a number of gigs promoted by [[Neon Gold Records]], including their showcase in March 2014 at [[South by Southwest]].<ref name="verg"/> In September 2014 the song "Echo", the title track from her then-upcoming debut EP, was released exclusively through ''Billboard''{{'}}s website. ''Billboard'' wrote the song "positions the singer as an artist capable of delivering a sweeping hook while emphasizing the subtler details of her arrangements."<ref name="verb"/>

On October 20, 2014 she self-released her ''Echo EP'',<ref name="veriteitunes"/> which includes four tracks: "Strange Enough", "Weekend", "Echo", and "Heartbeat."<ref name="veriteitunes"/>  Liza Darwin of [[Noisey]] wrote that "the EP is packed with crisp, delicate vocals, soaring melodies, and glistening production..."<ref name="noisey1"/> After the release she performed a number of late October shows in Brooklyn, including an October 21 show at the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI Showcase]] at [[The Knitting Factory]], and shows afterwards at [[Brooklyn Bowl]], Santos Party, and [[Glasslands Gallery|Glasslands]] with [[Kate Boy]].<ref name="verb"/> She self-released ''Echo EP (The Remixes)'' on December 15, 2014, which included five remixes by artists such as [[Penguin Prison]].<ref name="veriteitunes"/>

|style="text-align: left;"|"The songs [on the ''Sentiment'' EP] are complex electronic arrangements, layered with Byrne's rich and ethereal vocals. The runs in the chorus of 'Colors' require a vocal control and stamina she calls 'a beast' to perform live. 'Wasteland' is at once meditative and pulsing, her voice alternately sweet and booming."

She released her single "Wasteland" on February 25, 2015.<ref name="veriteitunes"/> ChartShaker.com described it as "exquisitely meshing Vérité's ethereal vocals with pounding, uptempo electro beats."<ref name="verd"/> Sean Moller of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine described "Wasteland" as having a "[[Lana Del Rey]] vibe that goes a long way."<ref name="pastemagazines"/>

Her previous singles "Wasteland" and "Colors" were included, as were the new tracks "Rearrange" and "Sentiment",<ref name="veriteitunes"/> About the overall lyrics, she stated "there's definitely a few brief themes that run through it: mainly, nostalgia, apathy and the exploration of how to connect."<ref name="verh"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine praised the release, calling her vocals "rich and ethereal."<ref name="verk"/>

She has performed internationally<ref name="verk"/> and opened for notable bands such as [[Stars (Canadian band)|Stars]], whom she performed with at [[Webster Hall]] in New York City.<ref name="verg"/> Early in the summer of 2015 she performed at the Westway with Gallant,<ref name="noisey2"/> the [[Firefly Music Festival|Firefly Festival]]<ref name="verc"/> in June 2015,<ref name="verh"/> and [[Lollapalooza]]'s<ref name="verh"/> [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] stage.<ref name="verj"/> On March 3, 2016 she released "Underdressed" to serve as the lead single from her ''Living'' EP.

I was just like, 'OK, I guess it's pop.'"<ref name="verg"/> About her songwriting process, she states "when it comes to production and the overall sound I don't really have a lot of intentions with it. I start off with melody and a lyrical idea, and then build off of that story."<ref name="verg"/> About themes, she states that "people can really ascribe their own meaning, which I kind of encourage."<ref name="verk"/> Eliza Berman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' opines that Vérité "writes songs about the human condition: what it's like to be here, to inhabit your own mind, to try to connect with others. If that sounds incredibly broad, that's because it is."<ref name="verk"/>
