== History ==
=== Early years (1991–1999) ===
Puddle of Mudd was formed on September 13, 1991, in Kansas City by [[Wes Scantlin]] (lead vocals/rhythm guitar), [[Jimmy Allen (musician)|Jimmy Allen]] (lead guitar), Sean Sammon (bass), and Kenny Burkitt (drums).<ref group="Note">The last name of the original drummer, Kenny Burkitt, is misspelled as "Burkett" in various sources. A 2005 legal document regarding use and rights to the name "Puddle of Mudd" has the spelling of his last name with an I not an E. – ''Burkitt vs. Flawless Records''.</ref> According to Scantlin, the band name was inspired by practicing next to the Missouri river levee, which always inundated the band's practice space, but never ruined their equipment since they were on the second floor. In order to get to their practice space, the band "had to walk through a pile of shit."<ref>{{cite web|title=Puddle Of Mudd Wes Scantlin Interview |url=http://spinitloud.com/?p=162 |website=Spinitloud.com |access-date=September 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927095844/http://spinitloud.com/?p=162 |archive-date=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> The group's first release, ''[[Stuck (EP)|Stuck]]'', was an EP released in 1994 on V&R Records. It was produced by the band and E.J. Rose, and was recorded at Red House Studio in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], Kansas. It spawned two radio singles (the first was "You Don't Know", the second "Drift and Die").<ref>{{cite web |title=Rock Artist Info {{!}} New Information, Facts, and Bios About Rock Music Recording Artists ... |url=https://www.allaccess.com/rock/artist-info/q/id/2340/puddle-of-mudd |website=All Access |access-date=January 25, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Minus [[Jimmy Allen (musician)|Jimmy Allen]], the group released their debut album, ''[[Abrasive (album)|Abrasive]]'', in 1997 on Hardknocks Records. It had eleven tracks, all written by the band, three of which would eventually make it on to Puddle of Mudd's first major-label release. Differences of opinion and other factors led to the break-up of the original Puddle of Mudd by early 1999, leaving Scantlin as the only original member.<ref>{{cite web |title=Puddle of Mudd Albums Ranked |url=https://returnofrock.com/puddle-of-mudd-albums-ranked/ |website=Return of Rock |access-date=January 25, 2021 |date=June 5, 2020}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

=== ''Come Clean'' (2000–2002) ===
Scantlin's big break in the music business came after a copy of his demo tape was delivered to [[Fred Durst]]. Durst contacted Scantlin, and after hearing that his band had broken up, decided to bring him to California to attempt to put a new band together.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

One of the first people Scantlin met upon arriving in California was [[Doug Ardito]], an intern at [[Interscope Records]]. When Scantlin found out about Ardito's bass playing, they decided to work together. They were still in need of a guitarist and drummer. Fred Durst decided to contact a guitarist he knew from his hometown of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, [[Paul Phillips (guitarist)|Paul Phillips]], who had formerly played in a local band there called Happy Hour. After getting the call from Durst, Paul decided to try out for Puddle of Mudd and was accepted, choosing to leave college in order to join. The band held auditions for a new drummer and selected [[Greg Upchurch]], who was an ex-member of [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]] and had also toured with [[Chris Cornell]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Puddle of Mudd entered the studio in 2000 and released its major-label debut album ''[[Come Clean (Puddle of Mudd album)|Come Clean]]'' on August 28, 2001. The lead single from the album, "[[Control (Puddle of Mudd song)|Control]]" was successful. It was also the theme song for WWE's ''[[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series 2001]],'' which was critically acclaimed. The second single off the album, "[[Blurry]]", co-written with Jimmy Allen and Doug Ardito, turned out to be Puddle of Mudd's most successful single, reaching No. 5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 8 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and also winning an [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] song of the year award for Ardito, Allen and Scantlin. The song was also used in the game ''[[Ace Combat 5]]'', published by Namco. "[[Drift & Die (Puddle of Mudd song)|Drift & Die]]" co-written by Jimmy Allen was also released as a single spending six weeks at the No.&nbsp;1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The fourth single, "[[She Hates Me]]" co-written by Jimmy Allen was released in late 2002, and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks chart]], as well as No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Allen and Scantlin won the ASCAP award for most played rock song of the year.<ref name="Billboard.com">{{cite magazine|title=Music News, Reviews, Articles, Information, News Online & Free Music|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=puddle of mudd|chart=all}}|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=November 23, 2010}}</ref>

The group then embarked on a European and American tour as the opening act for [[Godsmack]] and [[Deftones]], and were also a part of the [[Family Values Tour|Family Values 2001 tour]], alongside [[Linkin Park]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], and [[Staind]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The album was certified triple [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the U.S. by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on January 31, 2003, and as of late 2006, total sales worldwide were in excess of five million copies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

=== ''Life on Display'' (2003–2005) ===
Puddle of Mudd's follow up, ''[[Life on Display (album)|Life on Display]]'', spawned three singles "Away From Me", "Heel Over Head", and "Spin You Around". The album sold below expectations. Although shortly after its release, the record was certified gold and to date, has sold over 706,000 copies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Some suggested this was the primary cause of drummer [[Greg Upchurch]]'s leaving the band to join [[3 Doors Down]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1085937|pure_url=yes}} |title=Famous – Puddle of Mudd |website=AllMusic |date=October 9, 2007 |access-date=November 23, 2010}}</ref> [[Marisa Miller]] appeared in the music video for "Spin You Around". "Away From Me" was featured in ''[[The O.C.]]'' in 2004. The song "Nothing Left to Lose" was the official theme song of [[WWE]]'s [[2004 Royal Rumble]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

=== ''Famous'' (2006–2008) ===
[[File:Wes_Scantlin.jpg|thumb|Scantlin performing in 2008]]
On October 9, 2007, the band released their third major label record, ''[[Famous (Puddle of Mudd album)|Famous]]''. The first single, "Famous", was leaked through the band's Myspace page and radio in July before the CD was released.  It was a #1 single. Another track, "Merry Go Round", was released through [[iTunes]] before the official release. The following single, "[[Psycho (Puddle of Mudd song)|Psycho]]", topped both the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] charts for nine weeks. "Livin' on Borrowed Time" and "We Don't Have To Look Back Now" were the final singles released.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In the spring of 2007, the band went on tour supporting [[Hinder]] and [[Papa Roach]] on the Door to Dorm tour.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Their song "Famous" was the [[WWE One Night Stand]] 2007 official theme song and was also featured in the video game ''[[WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2008]]'', as well as ''[[UFC 2009 Undisputed]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

=== ''Vol.4 Songs in the Key of Love and Hate'' (2009–2010) ===
In 2009, former guitarist [[Paul Phillips (guitarist)|Paul Phillips]] rejoined the band after replacement Christian Stone was let go on good terms. Around this time the band recruited ''Famous'' producer [[Brian Howes]] to begin recording a new record in Vancouver. Prior to the new album's release, band members said the album's name would be called 'Jacket on the Rack'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tunelab.com/2009/09/03/puddle-of-mudd-title-new-album-jacket-on-the-rack/ |title=Puddle Of Mudd Title New Album "Jacket On The Rack" &#124; TuneLab Music – Everything Rock |website=Tunelab.com |date=September 3, 2009 |access-date=November 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109104609/http://tunelab.com/2009/09/03/puddle-of-mudd-title-new-album-jacket-on-the-rack/ |archive-date=January 9, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, it was changed to ''[[Volume 4: Songs in the Key of Love & Hate]].''

== Lip syncing and other controversies ==
Since 2012, Scantlin has been accused on numerous occasions of [[lip sync]]ing during live performances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kzoz.com/jeff-and-jeremy/2012/07/did-puddle-of-mudd-lip-synch-their-performance-at-the-california-mid-state-fair/ |title=Did Puddle of Mudd lip synch their performance at the California Mid State Fair |website=Kzoz.com |date=July 19, 2012 |access-date=July 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722043123/http://www.kzoz.com/jeff-and-jeremy/2012/07/did-puddle-of-mudd-lip-synch-their-performance-at-the-california-mid-state-fair/ |archive-date=July 22, 2015  }}</ref>

On April 16, 2014, Scantlin had an on-stage meltdown during a show at [[Trees Dallas]], in which he threw a microphone and beer into the audience, as well as appearing to threaten and attempt to physically attack members of the audience. He also received criticism as he appeared to be lip-syncing during the performance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kegl.com/articles/s-you-should-see-330053/puddle-of-mudd-singer-in-dallas-12265018/ |title=Puddle of Mudd singer in Dallas concert meltdown |website=Kegl.com |access-date=May 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424042705/http://www.kegl.com/articles/s-you-should-see-330053/puddle-of-mudd-singer-in-dallas-12265018/ |archive-date=April 24, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On June 20, 2015, the band was booed off stage at a show in [[Versailles, Ohio]], after Scantlin was spotted lip-syncing to the songs. In response to the social media backlash, the band subsequently deleted their Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/drama/puddle-of-mudd-deletes-facebook-page-after-being-booed-off-stage |title=Puddle of Mudd deletes Facebook page after being booed off stage|date=June 26, 2015|access-date=July 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinsider.net/social-networking/puddle-of-mudd-delete-facebook-page|title=Puddle of Mudd delete Facebook page|work=Metal Insider|date=June 26, 2015}}</ref> With the Facebook page available, the Austin, Texas-based rock band Black Heart Saints gained access as an opportunity to promote their music using the page title "Check This Band Out Instead",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2015/06/29/puddle-of-mudd-booed-off-stage-delete-facebook-page/|title=Puddle of Mudd Booed Off Stage, Delete Facebook Page|work=MetalSucks|date=June 29, 2015}}</ref> although later Puddle of Mudd decided to use the page again.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

On August 18, 2017, [[Thetford Mines]]' Festival de la Relève had to cancel a performance by the band, who were the festival's headliners, after neither Scantlin nor the rest of the band appeared at [[Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport]], where volunteers were to pick them up to drive them to the festival. No reason was given for the band's absence.<ref>[http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/arts/sur-scene/201708/18/01-5125806-puddle-of-mudd-pose-un-lapin-au-festival-de-la-releve-de-thetford-mines.php]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

== Connection with Fred Durst ==
Due to the notoriety surrounding how the band was signed with Durst, the band is often asked regarding their relationship with him. Scantlin criticized Durst in an interview in 2004 with Canada's ''[[ChartAttack|Chart]]'' magazine: <blockquote>"He doesn't write our songs, he doesn't produce our songs, he doesn't do anything for us. He doesn't do our videos anymore. He doesn't do anything for this band. I don't know what he's doing, I don't know what the guy's like. All I know is that he's like Mr Hollywood guy, Mr Celebrity. Like, 'I don't hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities'. Every single fucking interview I've ever fucking done, I get asked about that fucking guy... And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual... People think he writes music with me or something. He does not do that. I just don't get it. We have nothing in common. He doesn't even call us, he has his assistant call us to congratulate us on our record. Yeah, that's how pathetic he is."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=7614 |title=Wes Scantlin of Puddle Of Mudd Slams Fred Durst – in Metal News |website=Metalunderground.com |access-date=2010-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=19253 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910075918/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=19253 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-10 |title=Blabbermouth.Net – Puddle Of Mudd'S Scantlin Unleashes On 'Pathetic' Fred Durst |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2010-11-23 }}</ref></blockquote>

On April 22, 2008, in an interview with Artisan News Service, Wes Scantlin took back his previous criticism of Fred Durst: <blockquote>"[Fred] got our foot in the door and helped us out tremendously. I think nowadays he's doing a lot of directing and we don't really speak to him too much but we appreciate everything he's ever done for our careers."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://artisannews.com/puddle-of-mudd-give-props-to-bizkit-vox-durst/ | title=Puddle of Mudd Give Props to Bizkit Vox Durst | work=Artisan News Service | date=April 22, 2008 | access-date=November 22, 2021 }}</ref></blockquote>

Limp Bizkit and Puddle of Mudd played together on Epicenter 2011, along with another one of Durst's former proteges, [[Staind]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Hartmann |first=Graham | title=Limp Bizkit, Staind, Papa Roach + More Tear Up Epicenter Festival | url=https://loudwire.com/limp-bizkit-staind-papa-roach-epicenter-festival | work=[[Loudwire!]] | date=September 27, 2011 | access-date=November 22, 2021 }}</ref>

Scantlin later stated that he wanted to make a movie regarding his life and music career, and that he wanted to involve Durst, who had directed several films himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bell |first=Kaelen | url=https://exclaim.ca/film/article/puddle_of_mudd_frontman_wes_scantlin_wants_to_make_a_movie_about_his_life_with_fred_durst | title=Scantlin Wants to Make a Movie About His Life with Fred Durst | work=[[Exclaim!]] | date=September 3, 2021 | access-date=November 22, 2021 }}</ref>
