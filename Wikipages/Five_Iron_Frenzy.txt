'''Five Iron Frenzy''' is an American band formed in [[Denver, Colorado]], in 1995. Best known for playing [[ska punk]] music characterized by an offbeat sense of humor and prominent [[Christianity|Christian]] themes, Five Iron was one of the pioneering figures of the [[Christian ska]] movement which emerged with ska's mainstream revival in the 1990s. Since 2000, the band's music has shifted away from straight ska to include and embrace stronger [[alternative rock]] and [[pop punk]] influences, though it continues to create ska music and feature Christian overtones despite several members' changes in religious beliefs.<ref name="Huckabee, Tyler">{{cite web |url=http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/music/revenge-five-iron-frenzy |title=The Revenge of Five Iron Frenzy |author=Huckabee, Tyler |date=Jan 2013 |publisher=[[Relevant (magazine)|Relevant]] |access-date=August 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222211501/http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/music/revenge-five-iron-frenzy |archive-date=December 22, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Five Iron experienced their greatest commercial success during the late 1990s as part of the American ska revival, touring prolifically within both Christian and secular markets, where the band gained a [[cult following]] for their energetic live shows typified by humorous stage antics which often drew attention to various social causes and [[Charitable organization|charities]].<ref name="RMN_05_96">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Mehle |title=CHRISTIAN SKA BAND LETS MUSIC BE MESSAGE |newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |page=18 D |date=May 10, 1996}}</ref><ref name="CCM_24_2_">{{cite journal |last=Bartenhagen |first=Marcia  |date=August 2001 |title=Falling Forward |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=24 |issue=2 |page=11 }}</ref> By the early 2000s, Five Iron had independently sold a total of almost one million albums, though a number of factors eventually contributed to their break-up in 2003.<ref name="HM_09_136">{{cite journal |last=Newton |first=Adam |title=Brave Saint Saturn |date=March–April 2009 |journal=[[HM Magazine]] |issn=1066-6923 |issue=136 |page=19 }}</ref> After an eight-year hiatus, the band reunited in 2011 to resume intermittent touring, launching a coincident [[Kickstarter]] campaign to finance a new album which raised a then record-breaking $207,980.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://northernstar.info/dekalb_scene/columns/five-iron-frenzy-comes-out-of-retirement-breaks-kickstarter-record/article_47049b28-722d-11e1-9c87-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Five Iron Frenzy comes out of retirement, breaks Kickstarter record |publisher=[[Northern Star (Northern Illinois University)|Northern Star]] |date=March 19, 2012 |author=Devitt, Shelby}}</ref> The resultant album, ''[[Engine of a Million Plots]]'', was released in November 2013.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1993–1996)===
The origins of Five Iron Frenzy began with the band Exhumator, a Denver-based Christian [[Industrial metal#Industrial thrash and death metal|industrial thrash metal]] project which featured future Five Iron vocalist [[Reese Roper]], guitarists Micah Ortega and Scott Kerr, bassist [[Keith Hoerig]] and drummer Andrew Verdecchio.<ref name="TT_FiF">Todd, Darleen.

Five Iron Frenzy's first show, hosted at a church coffeehouse in April 1995, was as an opening act for Exhumator. According to Reese Roper's recollection of the event, the audience responded to Five Iron's music better than they had ever responded to Exhumator's, and realizing that everyone had more fun playing ska punk than metal, made the decision to dissolve Exhumator in favor of Five Iron that very night.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> Over their next few shows, the band gradually recruited a [[horn section]] consisting of trumpeter Nathaniel "Brad" Dunham, trombonist Dennis Culp and Micah Ortega's cousin, saxophonist Leanor Ortega.<ref name="meeting_detailed">A more detailed explanation is available at the Five Iron FAQ from FiveIronFrenzy.com (dated Feb. 1999) under "How did you meet?".

Almost instantly, Five Iron became a prominent presence in the Denver music scene. The band opened for [[Tooth & Nail Records]] artists [[MxPx]] for their third show and played over sixty shows during their first eight months, soon becoming a staple of every major ska show in the Denver area, opening for such nationally successful touring bands as [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]] and [[Less Than Jake]].<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /><ref name="CT_Bio"/><ref name="RMN_11_97"/> Although Five Iron's initial intent was to stay local and help develop their own scene, in June 1995, the band traveled to the [[Cornerstone Festival]] in [[Bushnell, Illinois]], to play an impromptu set before several prominent Christian alternative bands and record labels, including [[Ghoti Hook]], [[Crashdog]] and Alex Parker of [[Flying Tart]] Records.<ref name="Hendricks_Stuff">{{cite web|url=http://www.realmagazine.com/new/articles/fif_keithmicah.html|title=Keith & Micah on Stuff|last=Hendricks|first=Kevin D.|year=2004|publisher=Real Magazine|access-date=February 14, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626020042/http://www.realmagazine.com/new/articles/fif_keithmicah.html|archive-date=June 26, 2006}}</ref><ref name="CSTONE_32_124">{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=John J. |author-link=John J.

=== ''Upbeats and Beatdowns'', national recognition and ''Our Newest Album Ever!'' (1997–1999) ===
In April 1997, ''Upbeats and Beatdowns'' was given a national re-release on 5 Minute Walk's newly founded sub-label SaraBellum Records, which was in distribution partnership with the [[Warner Music Group]]. Released during the peak of ska punk's mainstream reign, ''Upbeats and Beatdowns'' proved to be a modest but significant success for the band, selling over 50,000 units in 1997 and peaking at number 39 on ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top Contemporary Christian chart, while a music video for the single "A Flowery Song" earned a [[GMA Dove Award|Dove Award]] nomination for Short Form Music Video of the Year.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web | title = allmusic ((( Five Iron Frenzy > Charts & Awards  > Billboard Albums ))) | publisher = allmusic.com | year = 2006 | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p203274/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} | format = Web | access-date =December 21, 2006}}</ref><ref name="RMN_11_97"/><ref name="BB_110_11">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=March 14, 1998 |title=ForeFront signs deal with indie |journal=[[Billboard Magazine]] |volume=110 |issue=11 |page=134 }}</ref> Five Iron retrospectively described their initial success as completely unexpected, though the band ultimately credited their sudden surge of independent fame less to the quality of their music and more to the effect of ska punk's mainstream popularity and the "niche market" of Christian music.

Following the success of ''Upbeats and Beatdowns'', the members of Five Iron were able to quit their day jobs and devote themselves to the band full-time.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> The group spent the remainder of 1997 touring nationally, playing over 150 shows across the country.<ref name="CM_Vol_26">{{cite book |last=Alfonso |first=Barry |editor=Brennan Luann |title=Contemporary Musicians |series=Volume 26 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Gale Group]] |location=[[Farmington Hills]], [[Michigan]] |isbn=0-7876-3251-1 |chapter=Five Iron Frenzy |pages=[https://archive.org/details/contemporarymusi00luan_0/page/49 49–50] |issn=1044-2197 |url=https://archive.org/details/contemporarymusi00luan_0/page/49 }}</ref> Many of these shows and tours were held in promotion of various social causes and charities; during the band's "Rock Your Socks Off Tour" in October 1997, fans were asked to bring clean socks for donation.<ref name="BB_109_42">{{cite journal |last=Bessman |first=Jim |date=October 18, 1997 |title=5 Minute's Five Iron Frenzy takes a mainstream swing |journal=[[Billboard Magazine]] |volume=109 |issue=42 |pages=14–15 }}</ref> Many of these charitable endeavors were supported or organized by 5 Minute Walk.

Five Iron's second album, ''[[Our Newest Album Ever!]]'', was released in November 1997 and experienced a similarly modest commercial success like that of ''Upbeats and Beatdowns'', debuting at number 8 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers]] and peaking at number 176 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In wake of the album's release, Five Iron participated in two high-profile national tours. In Spring 1998, the band performed on the [[Ska Against Racism]] tour, a ska punk tour orchestrated by [[Mike Park]] of [[Asian Man Records]], which raised money for [[anti-racism]] organizations.<ref name="IMWT_SAR">{{cite web|url=http://www.inmusicwetrust.com/articles/07f04.html|title=Ska Against Racism|last=Steininger|first=Alex|date=April 1998|publisher=In Music We Trust|access-date=February 17, 2007}}</ref> As the only openly Christian band on the tour, Ska Against Racism helped further strengthen Five Iron's reputation among secular audiences: Reese Roper recalled the band making many new fans from attendees who were initially worried the band would attempt to "shove religion down their throats", as well as forming lasting friendships with most of the secular bands on the roster.<ref name="CM_Vol_26"/><ref name="CT_43_06">{{cite journal |last=Steinken |first=Ken |date=May 24, 1999 |title=Where No Ministry Has Gone Before |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=74–75 }}</ref><ref name="Musique">{{cite web |url=http://www.bandoppler.com/reeseint.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010228173907/http://www.bandoppler.com/reeseint.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 28, 2001 |title=Five Iron Frenzy - Reese Roper |publisher=Bandoppler.com |date=1999}}</ref> Following the end of Ska Against Racism, Five Iron quickly wrote and recorded a new album in preparation for their next national tour, resulting in the 40-minute 17-track "[[extended play|EP]]" ''[[Quantity Is Job 1]]'', which was reportedly written in only two weeks.<ref name="Musique" />

In late 1998, Five Iron took part in SkaMania, a national tour which paired them with the other two most commercially successful bands in the [[Christian ska]] market, [[The O.C. Supertones]] and [[The Insyderz]].<ref name="CT_43_06" /> The tour was a resounding success within the Christian alternative scene, drawing around 3,000 attendees a night and helping boost sales of ''Quantity Is Job 1'' into the top fifteen of both ''Billboard''{{'}}s Contemporary Christian chart and Top Heatseekers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.crosswalk.com/culture/music/supertones-chase-the-sun-tour-540580.html |title=Supertones Chase The Sun Tour |date=September 7, 1999 |publisher=[[Crosswalk.com]]}}</ref> At this time, Scott Kerr announced his decision to depart Five Iron Frenzy following the end of the SkaMania tour. Kerr cited several reasons for choosing to leave the band, including wanting to spend more time with his wife and desiring to explore other musical projects away from ska and punk, though would later explain that his primary reason was having gradually lost his faith in Christianity.<ref name="Musique" /><ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> Upon leaving Five Iron, Kerr would form the Denver-based [[power pop]] band [[Yellow Second]], in which he served as lead singer, songwriter and guitarist. Sonnie Johnson, former guitarist for California ska punk band [[Jeffries Fan Club]], replaced Kerr in Five Iron's line-up.

Five Iron released their first live album, ''[[Proof That the Youth Are Revolting]]'', in November 1999, containing recordings of several live shows across 1998 and 1999, including the 1999 [[Cornerstone Festival]].<ref name="dec_brad">Bastian, Tom.

=== ''All the Hype That Money Can Buy'' and ''Five Iron Frenzy 2: Electric Boogaloo'' (2000–2001) ===
In April 2000, Five Iron Frenzy released their third album ''[[All the Hype That Money Can Buy]]''. By this time, public and media interest in ska music had waned significantly, and, motivated by the desire to not "put out the same record twice", ''All the Hype That Money Can Buy'' found Five Iron diversifying their sound far beyond ska, incorporating stronger rock and punk influences as well as elements of [[Latin music]], [[salsa music|salsa]], [[calypso music|calypso]] and [[reggae]].<ref name="HM_00_83"/><ref name="HM_01_92"/> The album included the song "A New Hope", which was written about the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]] in [[Columbine, Colorado]], where guitarist Micah Ortega's sister was a student at the time of the shooting.<ref name="HM_99_80">{{cite journal |last=McGovern |first=Brian Vincent |title=Five Iron Frenzy: Still Nuts After All These Years |date=July–August 1999 |journal=[[HM Magazine]] |issue=80 |page=36 }}</ref> Although the mainstream decline of ska music worked against the album in promotion and airplay, ''All the Hype That Money Can Buy'' became Five Iron's then highest-charting release, reaching number 6 on the Contemporary Christian charts and number 146 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="CT_Bio">{{cite magazine | title = Five Iron Frenzy - Music | magazine = [[Christianity Today]] | date = January 1, 2005 | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/artists/fiveiron.html | access-date =December 21, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061213225311/http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/artists/fiveiron.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = December 13, 2006}}</ref>

Five Iron toured internationally throughout the turn of the century, expanding their touring reach across both the European and [[Oceania|Oceanic]] continents.<ref name="7b_34">{{cite journal |title=News / Modern Rock |page=16 |date=January–February 2001 |issue=34 |journal=[[7ball]] |issn=1082-3980}}</ref> In June 2000, Five Iron played five shows in South Africa, one of which was a free concert held in an auditorium in the township of [[Phuthaditjhaba]], where the group spent the majority of the day playing with children from the local orphanage.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> The members of Five Iron noted that nobody in the township had heard of their band and many had never seen an American or even heard rock music before.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> In a 2010 interview, Reese Roper stated that everybody cared less about the music "as they just did that we were there". He elaborated on the personal impact of this show, noting that "all of the trappings, all of the barriers I had experienced from being in a band and trying to share the love of Jesus Christ had disappeared", describing it as "the best day that I ever remember being in Five Iron Frenzy".<ref name="TRAFOFIF">Roper, Reese.

By 2001, Five Iron were playing upwards of 250 shows a year. Several members, some of whom had just recently married, began to feel burnt out by the band's full-time touring commitments.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> This burnout was exacerbated by several personal tragedies, including the deaths of Leanor Ortega's brother in October 2000 and Andrew Verdecchio's father in August 2001, over which both Ortega and Verdecchio spent time questioning their religious faith.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /><ref name="TRAFOFIF" /> Nevertheless, Five Iron was scheduled to headline the 49-date "Electric Youth Tour" in late 2001, supported by Christian artists [[Relient K]], [[John Reuben]] and [[Ace Troubleshooter]].<ref name="CCM_24_7_CR">{{cite journal |last=Bartenhagen |first=Marcia  |date=January 2002 |title=Five Iron Frenzy, Relient K, John Reuben, Ace Troubleshooter, 328 Performance Hall, Nashville, TN |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=24 |issue=7 |page=49 }}</ref> Three days before the tour was set to begin in [[Fishkill, New York]], the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] were carried out in nearby Manhattan. Although the band initially questioned whether it was appropriate to tour in wake of the events, they chose to proceed with the tour as planned, a decision which was warmly received by audiences, whose numbers averaged around 1,200 a night.<ref name="CCM_24_7_SP"/> As on previous tours, Five Iron again asked fans to bring clean socks for donation to local shelters, though on this occasion also used said socks for audience participation games involving [[sock puppet]]s, as the band felt a need to bring people together under light-hearted circumstances.<ref name="GRP10-11-2001">{{cite journal |last=DeBoer |first=Terry |date=October 11, 2001 |title=Zany group mixes ska, sock puppets; Ska, sock puppets highlight a Five Iron Frenzy show |journal=[[Grand Rapids Press]] |page=21}}</ref>

Five Iron's fourth album, ''[[Five Iron Frenzy 2: Electric Boogaloo]]'', was released in November 2001 and marked a drastic stylistic shift from the band's previous albums. Though the group retained their prominent horn section, ''Electric Boogaloo'' featured none of the ska influences which dominated the band's first three albums, instead focusing exclusively on alternative rock and pop punk.<ref name="Hendricks_Last"/> Bassist Keith Hoerig described the album as simply "a rock record with horns", likening the band's use of brass to that of such horn-driven rock bands as [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]].<ref name="GRP10-11-2001"/> ''Electric Boogaloo'' also marked the end of Five Iron's record contract with 5 Minute Walk; though the band again considered the possibility of signing to a major label — according to Micah Ortega, an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive from [[Atlantic Records]] visited Five Iron during the recording of ''Electric Boogaloo''<ref name="Hendricks_Last"/> — they ultimately chose to remain with 5 Minute Walk, citing the label's commitment to ministry.<ref name="HM_01_92">{{cite journal |last=Strole |first=L.

=== Break-up and ''The End is Near'' (2002-2003) ===
Five Iron significantly scaled back their touring for most of 2002, headlining only one tour among several festival appearances and fifteen dates on the [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]].<ref name="FIFTourDates">{{cite web |url=https://www.fiveironfrenzy.com/past-shows/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207140311/https://www.fiveironfrenzy.com/past-shows/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 7, 2013 |title=Past Shows Five Iron Frenzy |publisher=www.fiveironfrenzy.com}}</ref> As had been band tradition, Five Iron met with their pastor for a [[Retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] at the end of the year to discuss their forthcoming career plans; Micah Ortega recalled this meeting being the first time where opinions were sharply divided between members, primarily over whether to continue Five Iron Frenzy full-time or part-time.<ref name="Hendricks_Last"/><ref name="TRAFOFIF" /> In light of several other contributing factors — not the least of which included Andrew Verdecchio's decision to leave the Christian faith and therefore the band — Five Iron unanimously agreed to disband at the end of 2003, allowing themselves enough time to record a final album and embark on a "[[farewell tour]]" for the sake of their fans.<ref name="TRAFOFIF" /><ref name="GRP10-01-2003"/> The group officially announced their break-up in an open letter posted to their website on February 14, 2003, extensively thanking their fanbase and detailing their plans for their shows and releases up until what would be their final concert in November.<ref name="FIF_Letter">{{cite web |url=http://fiveironfrenzy.com/ |title=An open letter to all supporters of Five Iron Frenzy from the band |access-date=February 14, 2007 |author=Five Iron Frenzy |year=2003 |publisher=[[Five Minute Walk]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030217060528/http://fiveironfrenzy.com/ |archive-date=February 17, 2003 }}</ref>

While recording what was intended to be their last studio album, Five Iron released ''[[Cheeses...(of Nazareth)]]'', a 33-track compilation consisting of various unreleased songs, b-sides, demos, live recordings and improvised joke tracks. Despite being described as merely a parting gift to their fanbase, the album received national distribution through [[EMI]] and reached number 17 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top Heatseekers and number 22 on the Contemporary Christian charts.<ref name="Hendricks_Last"/><ref name="FIF_Letter" /> In June, the first pressing of Five Iron's fifth and final album, ''[[The End Is Near (Five Iron Frenzy album)|The End is Near]]'', was released independently and sold exclusively at the band's live shows.<ref name="JFH2003">{{cite web |url=https://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/news/September03.asp |title=Music News: September 2003 |publisher=Jesusfreakhideout}}</ref>

Five Iron spent the summer of 2003 performing at various high-profile Christian music festivals across the United States and Canada, including the [[Agape Music Festival]] in Illinois, the [[Alive Festival]] in Ohio, [[Lifest]] in Wisconsin, [[Spirit West Coast]] in California and the Florida and Illinois [[Cornerstone Festival]].<ref name="FIFTourDates" /> When the band finished their final set at the Illinois Cornerstone, the audience chanted "thank you" in unison as they left the stage.<ref name="Hendricks_Last"/> Five Iron's final national tour, cheekily titled the "Winners Never Quit Tour", began in mid-September, spanning 58 shows across 31 states, supported by Christian artists [[Bleach (American band)|Bleach]], Holland and Cameron Jaymes.<ref name="FIFTourDates" /> Prior to the tour's commencement, Five Iron partnered with Rohi ministries in Kenya to open a children's rescue center and asked anyone attending their final tour to contribute at least one dollar to the fund.<ref name="JFH2003" /> By the tour's end, the band had raised over $48,000 for what was unofficially called "The Five Iron Frenzy Rescue Center"; in a 2012 interview, Leanor Ortega-Till revealed the fund had ultimately raised over $60,000 from fan donations alone, which had helped open an additional center.<ref>Tate, Frank.

Five Iron played their final show at the [[Fillmore Denver|Fillmore Auditorium]] in Denver on November 22, 2003, supported by Relient K, Bleach and Cameron Jaymes, drawing a sold-out crowd of over 3,900 people.<ref name="Hendricks_Last">{{cite web |url=http://www.realmagazine.com/new/articles/fif.html |title=Five Iron Frenzy Our Last Article Ever |access-date=February 14, 2007 |last=Hendricks |first=Kevin D. |year=2004 |publisher=Real Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208202749/http://www.realmagazine.com/new/articles/fif.html |archive-date=February 8, 2007  }}</ref><ref name="Argyrakis_Ivew">{{cite journal |last=Argyrakis |first=Andy |date=November 2003 |title=The End Is Here |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2003/fiveironfrenzy-1103.html |access-date=February 14, 2007 }}</ref> This show was professionally recorded to be released as the band's second live album titled ''The End is Here'', which was packaged as a double-disc set with ''The End is Near'' for mainstream retail distribution. This version of the album, stylized as ''The End is <s>Near</s> Here'', was released in April 2004 and met with modest commercial success, reaching number 10 on the ''Billboard'' Christian charts.

=== Hiatus and side projects (2004–2010) ===
Following the dissolution of Five Iron Frenzy, most of the band members parted ways to focus on their personal lives and pursue other musical endeavors, remaining active in numerous local bands. 

Several members of Five Iron continued to collaborate with each other beyond the band's initial break-up. Reese Roper, Dennis Culp, Keith Hoerig, Andrew Verdecchio and Scott Kerr were founding members of the conceptual Christian rock [[side project]] [[Brave Saint Saturn]] in 1999, and released ''[[So Far from Home]]'' on 5 Minute Walk in 2000. Roper, Culp, Hoerig and Verdecchio continued their work with Brave Saint Saturn after Five Iron, releasing ''[[The Light of Things Hoped For]]'' in 2003 on [[Tooth & Nail Records]] and the self-released ''Anti-Meridian'' in 2008 before falling into an indefinite hiatus shortly after.<ref name="GRP10-01-2003"/> Roper was also involved with the prospective pop punk [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] Guerilla Rodeo, featuring [[Ethan Luck]], [[John Warne]], Josh Abbott of [[Ace Troubleshooter]] and Five Iron's Sonnie Johnston. The band recorded a three-song EP in 2004 but the project never came to fruition and was instead gradually restructured into the solo project [[Roper (band)|Roper]], retaining only Roper as frontman and singer-songwriter. Roper released one album ''[[Brace Yourself for the Mediocre]]'' in late 2004 before disbanding the following year, upon which Roper retired to focus on a full-time career in nursing, though would occasionally contribute guest vocals to albums by bands including [[Showbread (band)|Showbread]] and [[The Insyderz]].<ref name="GRP10-01-2003"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/681485-Reese-Roper?page=1 |title=Reese Roper - Discography |publisher=[[Discogs]]}}</ref>

Culp, having released his own solo album ''[[Ascents (album)|Ascents]]'' under the name Dennis Bayne in 2000 (on which Verdecchio also performed), founded the music and sound design studio Singing Serpent in 2005, composing music for television advertising as well as appearing as a guest musician on albums by bands including [[Rafter (band)|Rafter]] and [[Becoming the Archetype]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ceros.com/originals/selling-sound-surprising-art-behind-tv-ad-music/ |title=Selling Through Sound: The Surprising Art Behind TV Ad Music |publisher=[[Ceros]] |date=December 6, 2016 |author=Milano, Dan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/681480-Dennis-Culp |title=Dennis Culp - Discography |publisher=[[Discogs]]}}</ref> Scott Kerr continued his work with [[Yellow Second]], releasing three studio albums before disbanding in 2005; their final album, 2005's ''[[Altitude (Yellow Second album)|Altitude]]'' released on [[Floodgate Records]], also featured Verdecchio as a member. Keith Hoerig and his wife Eryn formed the Denver-based [[alternative country]] band The Hollyfelds in 2006, independently recording and releasing two studio albums and two EPs before their disbandment in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.westword.com/music/the-hollyfelds-keep-it-familiar-5097820 |title=The Hollyfelds Keep It Familiar |date=February 28, 2008 |publisher=[[Westword]] |author=Eyl, Eryc}}</ref><ref name="DP_07-06-08">{{cite news |first=John |last=Wenzel |title=Couples make sweet music together |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |pages=FF–01 |date=June 8, 2007 }}</ref> In the mid-to-late-2000s, Leanor Ortega-Till played alongside her husband Stephen Till in the nine-piece pop ensemble Hearts of Palm.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theknow.denverpost.com/2011/01/21/the-mile-high-makeout-the-return-of-nathan-stephen-sort-of/26590/ |title=The Mile High Makeout: The return of Nathan & Stephen |publisher=[[Denver Post]] |author=Eyl, Eryc |date=January 21, 2011}}</ref>

Roper and Leanor Ortega-Till also self-published books of their own [[poetry]], Roper having published ''Spires to Babel'' in 2003 and ''More Than Paper Thin'' in 2004, and Ortega-Till having published ''It Must Look Pretty Appealing'' in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tollbooth.org/index.php/past-issues/past-book-reviews/326-scum-churchfive-iron-frenzys-leanor-ortega-till |title=Scum Church/Five Iron Frenzy's Leanor Ortega Till |publisher=The Phantom Tollbooth |date=November 23, 2011 |author=Todd, Jason}}</ref> In January 2004, Roper and Ortega-Till embarked on a brief [[spoken word]] tour with [[Mark Salomon]] of [[Stavesacre]] and [[Pigeon John]] of [[LA Symphony]] reading their own writings and poetry.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/news/Jan04.asp |title=Music News: January 2004 |publisher=Jesusfreakhideout}}</ref> Verdecchio has also since released books of his own writing, including the 2017 poetry collection ''October'' and the 2018 storybook ''Little''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17073046.Andrew_Verdecchio |title=Andrew Verdecchio |publisher=[[Goodreads]]}}</ref>

In April 2010, [[Asian Man Records]] released the DVD ''The Rise and Fall of Five Iron Frenzy'', a three hour documentary on the band edited and narrated by Roper featuring new interviews with band members and unreleased archival footage, as well as a bonus disc containing all of the band's music videos and clips of various live performances throughout their career.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648166/ |title=The Rise and Fall of Five Iron Frenzy (Video 2010) |publisher=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> Though the DVD received mixed reviews from Christian music publications - ranging from a perfect five-star rating by ''Jesus Freak Hideout'' praising its abundance of content to a two-star rating from ''Indie Vision Music'' criticizing its excessive runtime — Five Iron Frenzy nonetheless experienced a minor resurgence of renewed media interest, and members began giving numerous interviews together about the band's lasting legacy, including an extensive [[oral history]] published by the Denver ''[[Westword]]'' from Roper, Kerr, Verdecchio and Leanor Ortega-Till.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/TheRiseandFallofFiveIronFrenzyDVD.asp |title=Five Iron Frenzy, The Rise and Fall of Five Iron Frenzy DVD Review |publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout |date=April 22, 2010 |author=Fryberger, Scott}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indievisionmusic.com/reviews/five-iron-frenzy-the-rise-and-fall-of-five-iron-frenzy-dvd/ |title=Album Review: Five Iron Frenzy - The Rise and Fall of Five Iron Frenzy DVD |publisher=Indie Vision Music |date=January 5, 2011 |author=Pettersson, Eric}}</ref><ref name="OralHistoryFIF" />

=== Reunion, ''Engine of a Million Plots'', and ''Until This Shakes Apart'' (2011–present) ===
The prospect of a Five Iron reunion was first discussed between band members during the filming of ''The Rise and Fall of Five Iron Frenzy'' in 2009.<ref name="RELEVANT2011">{{cite web |author=Stephen Cohen |url=http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/music/features/27455-qaa-with-five-iron-frenzy |title=Q&A with Five Iron Frenzy |publisher=RELEVANT Magazine |date=November 22, 2003 |access-date=December 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203210408/http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/music/features/27455-qaa-with-five-iron-frenzy |archive-date=December 3, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to Roper, Scott Kerr was the first to express an interest in musically reconnecting with his former bandmates, though doubted the likelihood of a proper Five Iron reunion and less so his role in such a reunion, having relinquished his original position in the band to Sonnie Johnston.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> After Keith Hoerig declined to participate in any type of Five Iron reunion, Roper suggested that Kerr potentially return to the band as bassist, upon which Kerr began writing new material. Roper and Kerr discussed the logistics of reforming and writing new music for six months until a series of various life events including the birth of Roper's daughter and the relocation of several band members eventually prompted them to eventually abandon the idea.<ref name="RELEVANT2011"/>

In late 2011, Five Iron's website was suddenly replaced by an unexplained [[countdown|countdown clock]] counting down to November 22, the eighth anniversary of the band's final show. Since 2006, the website had been operated as a [[fansite]] by fan Joel Gratcyk, who had at that time renewed the domain name and planned to surprise fans by launching a new site on November 22, though the vague countdown inadvertently fueled mass speculation among fans that Five Iron themselves were going to announce a reunion on that date. Gratcyk contacted the band asking them to draft a formal apology to clarify the misunderstanding and dispel rumors of a reunion, though as Roper was in the process of doing so, instead decided to officially reform Five Iron Frenzy.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /><ref name="RELEVANT2011"/> The band chose to keep the news a secret and honor the November 22 reveal date, granting them enough time to write and record a new song and create a [[crowdfunding]] campaign for a new album on [[Kickstarter]], both of which would be unveiled in conjunction with the announcement of their reunion.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /><ref>Mouser, John (December 30, 2011).

Five Iron formally announced their reunion on November 22, 2011, releasing their first new song in eight years, "It Was a Dark and Stormy Night", as a free digital download alongside a two-month Kickstarter campaign to help cover the costs of production for a new studio album set to be released in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westword.com/music/five-iron-frenzy-reunion-fif-posts-new-song-announces-plans-for-new-album-due-in-2013-5694800 |title=Five Iron Frenzy reunion: FIF posts new song, announces plans for new album due in 2013! |date=November 22, 2011 |publisher=[[Westword]] |author=Navarro, Dave}}</ref> To the band's admitted shock and surprise, the campaign's initial financial goal of $30,000 was successfully met within 55 minutes and went on to ultimately raise $207,980 by 3,755 backers, breaking records as Kickstarter's then most funded musical project and attracting considerable media attention from news publications documenting the website's growing notoriety.<ref>{{cite web|title=Five Iron Frenzy Kickstarter Account|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fiveironfrenzy/new-five-iron-frenzy-album|work=New Five Iron Frenzy Album!!!!|publisher=Kickstarter|access-date=December 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://northernstar.info/dekalb_scene/columns/five-iron-frenzy-comes-out-of-retirement-breaks-kickstarter-record/article_47049b28-722d-11e1-9c87-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Five Iron Frenzy comes out of retirement, breaks Kickstarter record |publisher=[[Northern Star (Northern Illinois University)|Northern Star]] |date=March 19, 2012 |author=Devitt, Shelby}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_19423475 |title=Kickstarter site kicks off fundraising frenzy for bands, artists  |publisher=[[Denver Post]] |author=Moore, John |date=November 28, 2011}}</ref>

The next two years were spent working on the new album and playing select live dates.

== Religious affiliations and changes in faith ==
As a predominantly Christian band, most members of Five Iron Frenzy are involved in Christian ministry to varying degrees. Roper is a licensed [[pastor]] for the Alliance of Renewal Churches and the co-founder of Denver's [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational]] [[Scum of the Earth Church]], of which saxophonist Leanor Ortega-Till formerly served as the Women and Arts pastor. In a 2016 interview, Ortega-Till listed the rest of the current lineup's denominational make up as including [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[United Church of Christ|Church of Christ]] and [[Assemblies of God]].<ref name="RAFOFIF">{{citation |title=The Rise and Fall of Five Iron Frenzy (2010), DVD}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.godspropertyradio.com/episodes/hollerlujah-005-saxophone-scum-of-the-earth-skallelujah-w-leanor-ortega/ |title=HOLLERLUJAH-005 SAXOPHONE, SCUM OF THE EARTH & SKALLELUJAH! W/ LEANOR ORTEGA |date=July 1, 2016 |publisher=God's Prosperity Radio}}</ref>

In 1998, Scott Kerr chose to leave Five Iron Frenzy after renouncing his Christian faith. According to Kerr, he had begun experiencing doubts in high school which eventually came to a head during his time touring with Five Iron. In an attempt to reconcile his faith, Kerr fervently studied [[Christian apologetics]] — which he ultimately found "not persuasive and, at worst, intellectually disingenuous" — as well as works by [[David Hume]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] before deciding to leave Christianity.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> Though Kerr recalls the band accepting his revelation and decision to leave, Roper remorsefully recalled souring the relationship between them by him "pushing Jesus on [Kerr] when he needed me to just be his friend", which later served as the lyrical basis for Five Iron's song "To Start a Fire".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fiveironfrenzy.com/song-explanation-to-start-a-fire/ |title=Song Explanation: "To Start a Fire" |publisher=fiveironfrenzy.com |author=Roper, Reese |date=September 4, 2014}}</ref> Kerr continues to identify as "not a Christian", and upon re-joining Five Iron in 2011, wrote an explanation for his reunion with the band which partly read:

{{cquote|If you asked each of us what Five Iron’s mission is you might get 8 different answers, but from my perspective this band has no agenda other than to be authentic. It’s about honesty. I am interested in a pure, artistic expression, regardless of whether or not I’m of the same opinion as the artist. Reese is a gifted lyricist, and I enjoy his words even though we have very different notions about the world. He talks about struggles with faith in a way that I can relate to, and though we came out of our respective struggles with different ideas I am still moved by the music we all make together.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ten |first=Top |url=http://www.fiveironfrenzy.com/for-the-record/|title=For the record... |publisher=Five Iron Frenzy |date=December 9, 2011 |access-date=December 21, 2016}}</ref>}}

Andrew Verdecchio experienced a similar loss of faith during the early 2000s, following the death of his father and the events of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Verdecchio largely recalls the comments of conservative commentators [[Pat Robertson]] and [[Jerry Falwell]] blaming the cause of the attacks on homosexuals for driving a wedge between himself and Christianity, leading him to seriously question his beliefs and role within a Christian band.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> Like Kerr, Verdecchio attempted to study apologetics "because I didn't want to not believe it", though said "the more I read these books and tried to convince myself, the less convinced I was".<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> Upon renouncing his faith, Verdecchio requested to carry out one more tour with the band before quitting, upon which they decided to disband afterwards as Five Iron did not wish to replace him.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /> Verdecchio still identifies as an [[atheism|atheist]], though continues to fulfill his role as Five Iron's only official drummer.

Leanor Ortega-Till has also spoken about having struggled with severe doubts for a two-year period which caused her to try to avoid fans, though was ultimately able to "bounce back through her faith" and remains a practicing Christian.<ref name="OralHistoryFIF" /><ref>{{cite web |author=Broken FM |url=http://broken.fm/interview/ |title=Christian Rock Radio &#124; Christian Alternative Music &#124; KORB |publisher=Broken FM |access-date=December 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413123541/http://broken.fm/interview/ |archive-date=April 13, 2014  }}</ref>
