==History==

===Formation and first releases (2000–2004)===
After leaving the band [[Society's Finest]], in which he played guitar, vocalist [[Tim Lambesis]] formed As I Lay Dying in 2000.<ref name="clint" /> Starting out as a duet with drummer [[Jordan Mancino]], they first met as a band in February 2001. They both were in the [[hardcore punk]] band [[Point of Recognition]].<ref name="Urban Achiever"/> The band's name came from the [[As I Lay Dying|novel of the same name]] by [[William Faulkner]] that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=12929 |title=Interview With Tim Lambesis From As I Lay Dying – in Interviews |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=December 3, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110102152405/http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=12929| archive-date= January 2, 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="fourteeng">{{cite web

Shortly after the band's formation, [[Pluto Records]] offered As I Lay Dying a recording contract and, after accepting the offer, the band entered the studio one month later to record their first album ''[[Beneath the Encasing of Ashes]]'', released in June 2001. The band then recorded five songs for a [[split album]], again through Pluto Records, with San Diego [[post-hardcore]] band [[American Tragedy (band)|American Tragedy]].

[[File:As I Lay Dying-8191-Phil Sgrosso.jpg|thumb|left|[[Phil Sgrosso]] became the band's rhythm guitarist in late 2003.]]
As I Lay Dying realized it needed to expand to a five-piece band to include another guitarist and a bass guitarist. Mancino commented "we started going on tour and we needed obviously more people than that."<ref name="punktv"/> As Lambesis and Mancino were the only permanent members, the band recruited friends to perform with them and subsequently underwent several lineup changes: bass guitarist Noah Chase departed in 2001, while Brandon Hays, and his subsequent replacement Aaron Kennedy, departed in 2003.<ref name="punktv">{{cite web

After extensive touring and an increase in popularity, As I Lay Dying was offered a record deal with [[Metal Blade Records]] in March 2003.<ref name="metalblade">{{cite web

In July 2003, the band's second studio album ''[[Frail Words Collapse]]'' was released. Produced by Lambesis, the album peaked at No.&nbsp;30 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Independent Albums]] chart and No.&nbsp;41 on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart.<ref name="chart-history"/> William York of Allmusic thought the band "doesn't really add anything new to the mix from a musical standpoint" with the release, while also praising it for being "solid enough and well executed" with "adequate" production.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web

Music videos for the songs "94 Hours" and "Forever" received rotation on networks such as [[Fuse TV|Fuse]] and [[MTV2]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.

=== Success (2005–2009) ===
As I Lay Dying entered Big Fish recording studio in [[Encinitas, California]], US in January 2005 to record their third studio album. ''[[Shadows Are Security]]'' was released in June of the same year and debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Independent Albums chart. It was also the band's first release to enter the ''Billboard'' 200—at No.&nbsp;35<ref name="chart-history"/>—and sold about 275,000 copies. Wade Kergan of AllMusic called it "one of the strongest releases of 2005," and commented that new guitarists [[Phil Sgrosso]] and [[Nick Hipa]] make the band "stronger."<ref name="Shadows Are Security AMG">{{cite web

Norris left the band on good terms in November 2006 with a desire to focus on his marriage. The band auditioned ten bass guitarists, but none proved successful. Lambesis received demo tapes from a band called This Endearing, of which bass guitarists [[Josh Gilbert (musician)|Josh Gilbert]] was a member; however, Lambesis chose to "sit on it" and waited for the band to record more material. This Endearing subsequently disbanded and Gilbert was recruited as As I Lay Dying's new bass guitarist.<ref name="clint">{{cite web

===Lambesis' release, reunion and new music (2016–2018)===
Lambesis was released from prison on probation in December 2016.

Sgrosso explained in a reunion-related discussion video posted by the band on June 16, 2018 that he initially replied to all of Lambesis' emails with explicit expressions of having no desire to speak with him. Sgrosso explained that his disdain with Lambesis started well before his arrest and took relief in not having to be in a band with him anymore upon Lambesis' arrest. His relationship with Hipa deteriorated due to what both described as not being able to deal with the weight of the aftermath properly. Hipa explained that while he initially felt empathy towards Lambesis after his tearful courtroom apology—it was short lived following Lambesis' interview with ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' which Hipa claimed read like "one long excuse". After Lambesis made his public apology, Sgrosso finally agreed to meet with Lambesis and claimed Lambesis evolved into a different person than he was for the years leading up to his arrest which inspired him to reach out to Hipa to rekindle their friendship. Hipa was the last to speak with Lambesis due to what Hipa described as not being able to escape the shadow of Lambesis' arrest and the mental and physical effects it took on him. After reconnecting with Sgrosso and reading Lambesis' apology—he agreed to meet with Lambesis as a means to "let go of his hatred" and claimed that Lambesis owned up and took responsibility for every one of his actions he was called on.<ref name="blabbermouth.net"/><ref name="auto"/><ref name="theprp.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2018/06/16/news/as-i-lay-dying-members-release-video-discussion-on-their-decision-to-return/|title=As I Lay Dying Members Release Video Discussion on Their Decision To Return|date=June 16, 2018|access-date=June 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618003004/https://www.theprp.com/2018/06/16/news/as-i-lay-dying-members-release-video-discussion-on-their-decision-to-return/|archive-date=June 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/tim-lambesis-apology/|title=As I Lay Dying's Tim Lambesis Offers Apology to Family|website=Loudwire|access-date=June 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618002620/http://loudwire.com/tim-lambesis-apology/|archive-date=June 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Over the course of the tail end of Lambesis' incarceration and release, the band's public opinion towards Lambesis softened. Mancino did an interview primarily discussing Wovenwar, but also spoke about As I Lay Dying on [[MetalSucks]]' podcast.

==Christianity==
Although As I Lay Dying has stated on numerous occasions that all of the members of the group are practicing [[Christians]], the band is usually described by media as being in the [[metalcore]] genre, not [[Christian metal]]. The band's lyrics do not focus on Christian themes the way many [[praise music]] bands do, nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private [[Christian worship]] or [[proselytizing]] efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like [[existential angst]] or the struggle between [[reason]] and [[spirituality]].

Lyricist and lead singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed commentary on the subject: asked in 2008 if the members were "a [[Christian metal|Christian band]]" or "Christians ''in'' a band", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, "I'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, if you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian."<ref name="faq">{{cite web  |url=http://www.asilaydying.com/faqs.html  |title=As I Lay Dying FAQ  |publisher=asilaydying.com  |access-date=June 20, 2008  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602232514/http://www.asilaydying.com/faqs.html  |archive-date=June 2, 2008  |url-status=dead}}</ref> Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://podcast.fullarmorradio.com/2010/08/13/as-i-lay-dying.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207165451/http://podcast.fullarmorradio.com/2010/08/13/as-i-lay-dying.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 7, 2011 |title=As I Lay Dying radio interview |work=The Full Armor of God Broadcast |access-date=August 14, 2010 }}</ref>

However, in later years, Lambesis showed an increasing [[philosophical skepticism]] towards Christianity and religion in general. Court documents stated Lambesis emailed his wife Meggan in August 2012, while on tour with As I Lay Dying, asking for a divorce and stating he "no longer believed in God".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/as-i-lay-dying-frontman-tim-lambesis-denies-plotting-his-wifes-murder-8611211.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828104038/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/as-i-lay-dying-frontman-tim-lambesis-denies-plotting-his-wifes-murder-8611211.html|url-status=dead|title=As I Lay Dying frontman Tim Lambesis denies plotting his wife's murder|date=May 10, 2013|archive-date=August 28, 2013|website=The Independent}}</ref> In explaining some of the lyrics from ''Awakened'', Lambesis stated on his personal [[Tumblr]] account that his studies of [[theology]] had led him to the conclusion that "tradition and truth are often at odds with each other", and while he "didn't hate all religious belief", he was finding it "very difficult for [him] to outline exactly who it is that's worth siding with."<ref name="tumblr" /> He also quoted the book ''Pagan Christianity'' by [[George Barna]] and [[Frank Viola (author)|Frank Viola]], claiming that both "[[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] denominations have poisonous roots".<ref name="tumblr">{{cite web |url=http://timlambesis.tumblr.com/post/32380385279/clarification-on-a-greater-foundation |title=Clarification on 'A Greater Foundation' |publisher=tumblr.com |access-date=May 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508105143/http://timlambesis.tumblr.com/post/32380385279/clarification-on-a-greater-foundation |archive-date= May 8, 2013}}</ref> While on house arrest in July 2013, after being charged with soliciting his wife's murder, Lambesis published a blog post in which he obliquely confirmed his previous loss of faith in Christianity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/tim_lambesis_as_i_lay_dying_posts_blog_update_details_time_in_house_arrest |title=Tim Lambesis (As I Lay Dying) posts blog update; details time in house arrest awaiting murder trial |work=Alternative Press |date=July 7, 2013 |access-date=August 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018055154/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/tim_lambesis_as_i_lay_dying_posts_blog_update_details_time_in_house_arrest |archive-date=October 18, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In 2014, Lambesis said that although they were marketed as a Christian band, the members privately considered themselves atheists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/as-i-lay-dying-singer-tim-lambesis-said-he-became-atheist-but-kept-claiming-to-be-christian-to-keep-selling-music-to-faithful-121712/ |title=As I Lay Dying Singer Tim Lambesis Said He Became Atheist But Kept Claiming to Be Christian to Keep Selling Music to Faithful |work=The Christian Post |date=June 17, 2014 |access-date=August 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714122133/http://www.christianpost.com/news/as-i-lay-dying-singer-tim-lambesis-said-he-became-atheist-but-kept-claiming-to-be-christian-to-keep-selling-music-to-faithful-121712/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Following this statement, guitarist Nick Hipa responded by calling these claims slanderous and defamatory.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/tim-lambesis-trial/former-as-i-lay-dying-guitarist-nick-hipa-responds-to-tim-lambesis-slanderous-accusations|title = Former AS I LAY DYING Guitarist Nick Hipa Responds To Tim Lambesis' Slanderous Accusations|date = May 19, 2014|access-date = June 20, 2014|website = Metal Injection|last = Pasbani|first = Robert|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140704110242/http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/tim-lambesis-trial/former-as-i-lay-dying-guitarist-nick-hipa-responds-to-tim-lambesis-slanderous-accusations|archive-date = July 4, 2014|url-status=live|df = mdy-all|quote=...the verbalized assessment of his relationship with myself and former bandmates is absolute slander [...] the intent of his defamation is to create an air of sympathy and support under the false pretense of a forthcoming tell-all.}}</ref> However, since his arrest it has been reported that Lambesis, in an April 2014 statement by the band, "[...] has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much brokenness and repentance he sees things differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God, or whatever you want to call it. That's for him to talk about when he's comfortable and only time will tell if he is sincere."<ref name="theprp1"/>
