'''Louis Vincent Albano'''<ref name=slamobit>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2009/10/08/11349916.html|title=Captain Lou Albano passes away at 76|author=Van der Griend, Blaine|work=Slam! Wrestling|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]]|access-date=October 14, 2009|date=October 14, 2009}}</ref> (July 29, 1933 – October 14, 2009) was an Italian-American professional wrestler, manager and actor, who performed under the ring/stage name, "Capt." Lou Albano. He was active as a professional wrestler from 1953 until 1969 before becoming a manager until 1995.

Over the course of his 42-year career, Albano guided 15 different tag teams and three singles competitors to championship gold.<ref name=slamobit/> Albano was one of the "Triumvirate of Terror", a threesome of nefarious WWF managers which included [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard of Wrestling]] and [[Freddie Blassie]]. The trio was a fixture in the company for a decade until The Grand Wizard's death in 1983.

A unique showman, with an elongated beard, rubber band facial piercings, and loud outfits, Albano was the forefather of the 1980s [[1980s professional wrestling boom#Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection|Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]. Collaborating with [[Cyndi Lauper]], Albano helped usher in wrestling's crossover success with a mainstream audience. Capitalizing on his success, he later ventured into Hollywood with various television, film, and music projects. He became well known to a younger generation of fans as the actor and voice of [[Mario]] in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]''

==Early life==
Albano's parents, Carmen Louis Albano and Eleanor Albano ''née'' Morrone, were of Italian heritage but both born in the United States. Eleanor was a classical concert pianist who had performed at [[Carnegie Hall]] and later became a registered nurse. Her brother, a physician, introduced her to Carmen in the 1930s, who was training to be an obstetrician. After marrying, they temporarily relocated to Italy while Carmen pursued his [[medical degree]] at the [[University of Bari]]. He later co-patented a forceps instrument to assist in [[breech birth]] deliveries. Louis Albano was born in Italy when his father had three months remaining at the university. He was [[Baptism|baptized]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], and his parents shortly thereafter returned to the [[New York City]] area aboard the [[RMS Majestic (1914)|RMS ''Majestic'']].<ref name=autobiography>{{cite book|title=Often Imitated, Never Duplicated: Captain Lou Albano|last=Albano|first=Lou|pages=9|publisher=GEAN Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0-615-18998-7}}</ref> Lou was one of nine children, of whom five lived to adulthood. The family settled in the [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]] area. Lou attended [[Archbishop Stepinac High School]] in [[White Plains, New York]], where he competed in [[track and field]], and finally rose to the position of captain of the [[American football|football]] team. It was this rank that later inspired his wrestling moniker, "Captain" Lou Albano.<ref>Albano, 2008, p. 64</ref> His skills were such that he received 32 offers of full scholarship from universities around the country, and he chose the [[University of Tennessee]] on the strength of their football team. Here, Albano was teammates with the likes of [[Darris McCord]], [[Doug Atkins]], and his roommate, [[Sam Rutigliano]]. Albano had conflicts with the dean due to poor behavior and was expelled after attempting to cheat on a final exam. He then joined the [[United States Army]], but due to a childhood injury exacerbated by his football days, Albano was honorably discharged after only eight months.<ref>Albano, 2008, pp. 10-13</ref>

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1953&ndash;1967)===
Although Albano's father, retired from medicine, wanted to open an insurance agency with his son, Lou instead began training as a [[boxer]]. A distant cousin and family friend, [[Lou Duva]], introduced Albano to Willie Gilzenberg, a boxing promoter who later became the first titular president of the WWWF. Gilzenberg, noting Albano's relatively short stature, instead encouraged him to enter wrestling. Albano's father had himself been an amateur wrestler, and Albano himself had been introduced to professional wrestling at an event held at [[Fort Dix]] during his tenure in the Army, where he had seen the likes of [[Gorgeous George]], [[Arnold Skaaland]], Soldier Barry, and [[Lenny Montana]]—all of whom Albano later worked with. Gilzenberg asked Soldier Barry to help train Albano, and in 1952, the two began doing house shows in the New York area.<ref>Albano, 2008, pp. 11&ndash;15</ref> Albano was originally seen as a "pretty boy," and wrestled as the [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] "Leaping Lou Albano". After a non-wrestling injury caused a gash on his forehead, he purposefully did not allow the scar to heal, and the minor disfigurement allowed him to turn [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]. Now billed as the "Mount Vernon Mauler," and occasionally a pirate, he began establishing himself in the New York professional wrestling community. At this point, Gilzenberg introduced Albano to [[Vince McMahon Sr.]], promoter of the new Capitol Wrestling Corporation in [[Washington, D.C.]]—the first predecessor to what is today WWE. Albano worked for Capitol Wrestling and its successors, under Vince McMahon and his son, for most of the rest of his career.<ref>Albano, 2008, pp. 14-15</ref> Albano made little impact as a solo wrestler, working prelims in various circuits, but he achieved moderate success as a tag team performer with partner [[Tony Altomare]].<ref name=god166/> Dubbed The Sicilians, Altomare and Albano competed as a stereotypical Italian [[gangster]] combo in the mode of the then-popular television series ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]''.<ref name=slamobit/> The pair won the Midwest tag team championship on the undercard of June 30, 1961 [[Comiskey Park]] event starring [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]] and [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] that set the all-time record gate in the United States to that point. Their realistic depiction of gangster characters caught the attention of actual [[Sicilian Mafia|mafiosi]] in 1961. In Chicago, [[Tony Accardo]] and two associates "requested" that Albano and Altomare cease using the word "mafia". During their run as Midwest tag team champions, personal differences with bookers and other wrestlers resulted in the pair abandoning the territory quickly enough that they did not lose the title before leaving.<ref>Albano, 2008, pp. 23&ndash;25</ref>

===WWWF/WWF (1964, 1967&ndash;1986)===
In 1964, Albano wrestled for the [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]] as a singles competitor.

====The Sicilians and breakup (1967&ndash;1969)====
Albano returned in 1967 and again partnered with [[Tony Altomare]] as "The Sicilians". In July, they won the [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship]] from [[Arnold Skaaland]] and [[Spiros Arion]].<ref name=slamobit/><ref name=god166>Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 166–167.</ref>  Albano and Altomare only held the championship for two weeks, a title change which was not even acknowledged on WWWF television outside the [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] market. But several photographs of the pair with their title belts were taken, which elevated Albano's reputation in the wrestling magazines of the time, and provided good publicity fodder later in his career. By 1969 The Sicilians disbanded and went their separate ways. Albano went as a singles competitor.

====Becoming a manager (1970)====
In 1970, fellow wrestler [[Bruno Sammartino]] mentioned to McMahon that Albano, a mediocre wrestler who was nonetheless an entertaining speaker, might be better utilized as a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. In professional wrestling, a manager might be tasked with behind-the-scenes efforts to help push forward a charge's career or handle his booking, but plays an equal or even greater role in the ring, speaking for his charge and helping rile up the crowd for or against him. Sammartino recalled: "One day I said to Vince Sr., this guy [Albano] isn't the best wrestler, as a team, they [Albano & Altomare] can only go so far. But he'd be a great mouthpiece for some guy. Lou has such a gift of gab that he can help out some people. As a wrestler, he just seemed limited. He was always the same. He was never looked upon by promoters as someone who could be anyone special. But as a manager, he shined. That was his calling."<ref name=slamobit/> Albano, realizing that wrestlers had only a limited lifespan in the ring, and still dealing with his old football injury, agreed. Although it was his decision to split up his ten-year tag team partnership with Altomare, the two remained very close until the latter's death in 2003.

At this time, managers were relatively rare in the pro wrestling world—WWWF had only two others. However, a promising new wrestler, Oscar "Crusher" Verdu, had just recently emigrated from Spain. His in-ring capabilities were hampered by a limited command of English, and Albano was assigned to be his mouthpiece. Albano emphasized Verdu's physique and insisted that he had never been taken off his feet during a match. To rile up audiences, he also engaged in ethnic slurs, which were then a more common part of WWWF banter; Albano promised that Verdu would stomp on "that Italian" (Sammartino); the fact that Albano was known to be Italian himself only heightened the audience's reaction. Sammartino later said, "They wanted to see me beat the hell out of Verdu to make Albano a liar. He could get the kind of [[heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] that nobody else could." The result was a [[Madison Square Garden]] sellout when Verdu faced Sammartino in June 1970, the first for the company in five years and a then-record gate for a wrestling event in that arena. The record lasted only a month, when a rematch brought in over $85,000 in ticket receipts.  After losing that match, Verdu cycled out of the WWWF rotation, but Albano remained as the top heel manager for the next 15 years. 

Thus began his transition into the brash, bombastic manager "Captain" Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#P|promos]] and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as he attempted to dethrone [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) superstar and Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: "I just remember the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. Somehow, in the middle, I said the two or three sentences that sold tickets. Mostly, I just tried to make people want to see me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heymanhustle.craveonline.com/articles/news/22266-rip-captain-lou |title=RIP CAPTAIN LOU - Heyman Hustle |publisher=Heymanhustle.craveonline.com |date=October 14, 2009 |access-date=March 19, 2012}}</ref> Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.

====Career as a manager (1971&ndash;1984)====
In January 1971, Albano was the manager when [[Ivan Koloff]] ended Sammartino's seven-year reign as champion.<ref name=slamobit/> Koloff's title reign was a transitional one, lasting just three weeks. Koloff had a typical heel run against Sammartino in 1969, but Albano spent months claiming that his previous manager had trained him incorrectly, and that Koloff would beat Sammartino under Albano's expert tutelage. The shock of Koloff's victory was such that the crowd fell totally silent, and Sammartino momentarily feared that he'd lost his hearing. Koloff and Albano were quickly rushed out of the ring by security without the championship belt as the crowd began to riot. Albano, his wife, and a family friend, who were both in attendance, escaped to a taxi outside the Garden. The mob surrounded the cab and began breaking windows, so the trio ran to a nearby bar, followed by the crowd who were pelting them with mud and objects. The mob was beginning to destroy the bar as the police finally arrived. Vince McMahon received a bill for damages totaling $27,000 ($182,378 in 2021 dollars), cementing Albano's unparalleled ability to "draw heat" (arouse anger in the audience).<ref>Albano, 2008, p. 38.</ref>

Another protege of Albano was "Iron" [[Mike McCord]]. A memorable match in 1974 featured [[Chief Jay Strongbow]] applying his famous sleeper hold on [[Mike McCord]]. But Lou Albano interfered in the match by smashing an arm cast over Strongbow's forehead, causing him to bleed badly. It was previously alleged by Albano that Strongbow had since jumped him in the locker room, breaking Lou's arm in the process. But during the match McCord was disqualified because of "Outside Interference". Strongbow was cut wide open by Albano's bloody blows. Later Strongbow settled the score by challenging Albano to put on the wrestling tights once again. And the stage was set in front of a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden, where he defeated Captain Lou Albano quite convincingly.

Albano then resumed his role as the mastermind trying to lead his latest bad guy protege to the gold. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Albano's cadre of loyal henchmen were unable to re-secure the heavyweight championship, held by either Sammartino, [[Pedro Morales]], [[Bob Backlund]] or [[Hulk Hogan]].<ref name=slamobit/> However, Albano guided singles wrestlers [[Don Muraco]] and [[Greg Valentine]] to the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name=slamobit/> Furthermore, Albano guided thirteen teams to the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championships]], including The Valiant Brothers, [[The Wild Samoans]], The Yukon Lumberjacks, The Blackjacks, The Moondogs, The Masked Executioners, and after becoming a face (short for babyface, a wrestling term for a good guy/heroic character), the [[U.S. Express]] and the British Bulldogs.<ref name=slamobit/><ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/lou_albano/biography.php Lou Albano – Rotten Tomatoes Celebrity Profile], retrieved on October 15, 2009.</ref> It was during his stewardship of the Valiant Brothers that Albano picked up his "Captain" nickname, as the act was promoted as "Captain Lou and the Valiants too." By the end of his career, Albano had managed over 50 different wrestlers who won two dozen championships.

Albano could also help elevate wrestlers by splitting from them. In 1982, despite being managed by the villainous Albano, [[Jimmy Snuka]] was unexpectedly becoming a fan favorite due to his high-flying ring style. An interview segment revealed that Snuka had no legal contract with Albano, and thus was able to leave his manager.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/snukastevensreview.htm Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka vs. Ray "The Crippler" Stevens], Madison Square Garden, New York, NY, December 28, 1982, retrieved on October 15, 2009.</ref> Shortly thereafter, a bloody beatdown by Albano, [[Freddie Blassie]] and [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]], helped transform Snuka into a sympathetic figure, and triggered the most successful period of his career.<ref>[http://www.mediaman.com.au/profiles/snuka.html Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka – Wrestling Legends – WWE Hall of Fame legend – Media Man Australia], retrieved on October 15, 2009.</ref> Albano had previously helped turn the villainous Intercontinental Champion [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] into a fan favorite, by "purchasing" Patterson's contract against his will. He also managed the U.S. Express at [[WrestleMania I|WrestleMania]].

====Final storylines (1984&ndash;1986)====
In 1984, Albano met pop singer [[Cyndi Lauper]] on a plane flight from [[Puerto Rico]]. Her manager, David Wolff, suggested that the two collaborate on a project at some point in the future. In 1984, the opportunity came when Lauper's video for "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]" needed an actor to play the singer's father, and Albano was suggested. Initially reluctant, he was convinced by his wife to agree, and Lauper and Albano thereafter formed a lifelong friendship. He appeared in several of her music videos and she appeared on [[Roddy Piper]]'s "Piper's Pit" program to discuss the collaboration. Albano, in character, began denigrating Lauper and women in general and claimed to have written all her songs and been the only reason for her success. Lauper, in turn, assaulted Albano with her purse, and the two agreed to settle their differences in the ring. Albano and Lauper agreed to compete by proxy, each choosing a female wrestler to contend. Lauper chose [[Wendi Richter]], while Albano chose [[The Fabulous Moolah]]. The match, scheduled for July 23, 1984, was dubbed ''[[The Brawl to End it All]]'', and was broadcast live on [[MTV]].<ref name=raging87>Shields, Brian. ''Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s'', p.87.</ref> During the match, Lauper interfered on Richter's behalf by hitting Moolah in the head with her purse, dubbed "The Loaded Purse of Doom". At the conclusion of the match, Richter had defeated Moolah for the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWF Women's Championship]], which the WWF had promoted Moolah as having held for the previous 28 years.<ref name=god171>Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p.171–173.</ref> For a time in the 1980s, Albano also managed the rock group [[NRBQ]]. The group recorded a 1986 album, "Lou and the Q," which contained a song titled "Captain Lou"—on which Albano himself sings and rants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://badcatrecords.com/BadCat/NRBQ.htm|title=B|website=badcatrecords.com|access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

In the meantime, Albano had become involved in several [[Charitable organization|charities]]. His brother's brother-in-law had recently died of [[multiple sclerosis]], and the experience led Albano to lend his time to raising awareness and funds to combat the disease, occasionally alongside Lauper. His increasingly public benevolence clashed with his in-ring persona, which violated the principles of ''[[kayfabe]]''—maintaining the appearance of reality within professional wrestling—which were still strictly adhered to at the time. In 1984, Albano decided it was time, after 32 years as a heel, to turn face. He therefore arranged for Lauper to receive an in-ring award for her contributions to both wrestling and the fight against MS, for which he also came out and congratulated her. In the course of the ceremony, Roddy Piper and [[Bob Orton Jr.|"Cowboy" Bob Orton]] came into the ring to sarcastically praise Albano before breaking Lauper's award, a gold record plaque, over his head. Lauper and her boyfriend-manager David Wolff were also attacked by Piper and Orton. The melee was broken up by Hulk Hogan, but the altercation allowed Albano to now wrestle and manage as a crowd favorite. His last two (heel) singles protégés, Valentine and [[Ken Patera]], were paired with [[Jimmy Hart]] and [[Bobby Heenan]], respectively, after Albano's face turn. Although he continued his overblown, rambling interviews—one of the lead announcers for the WWF, [[Gorilla Monsoon]], continued to refer to Albano as "The Fountain of Misinformation"—Albano was now leading fan favorites such as [[The U.S. Express]], [[George Steele]], [[The British Bulldogs]], [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[André the Giant]] into battle. The U.S. Express and British Bulldogs became the first tag teams to win the WWF Tag Team Championships with Albano as a "face" manager.

===Superstars of Wrestling and UWF (1986&ndash;1991)===
Albano left the WWF in late 1986 with one final match on an episode of ''[[Wrestling Challenge]]'' that aired on November 16, 1986, teaming with The British Bulldogs to defeat The Dream Team and Luscious Johnny Vailant. Albano would then make a one-time appearance on a "Piper's Pit" on an episode of ''Superstars of Wrestling'' in February 1987 to ask [[André the Giant]] to reconsider his recent alignment with [[Bobby Heenan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/superstars87.htm |title=WWF Superstars (1986-97) |work=The History of WWE |access-date=March 19, 2012}}</ref> Albano briefly worked in Herb Abrams' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|UWF]] promotion in 1991, where he hosted an interview segment.

===Return to WWF and retirement (1994&ndash;1995)===
[[File:Lou Albano with Paul Billets.jpg|thumb|right|Albano with a fan]]
Albano returned to the WWF in 1994 to manage the newly face-turned [[The Headshrinkers|Headshrinkers]], helping lead them to the WWF Tag Team Championship. He left in early 1995, making sporadic appearances as a guest from then-on, but never again as a manager.<ref name=digitaljournal/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/captain-lou-albano-dies-90040|title='Captain' Lou Albano dies|date=October 14, 2009}}</ref>

===Legacy in the WWE===
The events leading up to Albano's face turn proved to be pivotal in the history of the WWF. Hogan, Piper, and Orton began a feud at Lauper's award ceremony that culminated in [[The War to Settle the Score]] (which also featured the culmination of Lauper and Moolah's continuing feud). The outcome of the War—Hogan winning by disqualification—was the impetus for the primary match at the first [[WrestleMania]], in which Albano also participated, as a face manager. More importantly, the involvement of Lauper, a celebrity completely unrelated to wrestling, in the pro wrestling world was unprecedented. MTV's decision to broadcast the Brawl to End it All tremendously increased the WWF's public profile, especially in the coveted young adult demographic. This led directly to the [[1980s professional wrestling boom]]. [[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|''Wrestling Observer'']]{{'}}s [[Dave Meltzer]] wrote, "Without Albano, wrestling history would have been monumentally different because if you take Lauper's involvement out of the equation, the early losses on expanding nationally and buying so much television time were on the verge of putting the company under... Without her, there would have been no MTV special, no national media publicity, and it's highly unlikely without it that the first WrestleMania would have been a success. If you take Albano's participation out of the equation, there is a good chance the McMahon expansion would have hit an iceberg and died in early 1985... the attention garnered by the Rock & Wrestling Connection, stemming from that chance meeting on an airplane between Lauper and Albano less than two years earlier, led [[NBC]] to make the decision to air ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' several times per year in the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' time slot."

==Television and film==
Albano appeared in the 1986 film ''[[Wise Guys (1986 film)|Wise Guys]]'',<ref name="Encyclopedia223">{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/223 223]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|title-link=WWE Encyclopedia}}</ref> starring [[Danny DeVito]]. He played the role of [[Mario]], [[Nintendo]]'s [[mascot]], in both the live-action and animated segments of ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', a TV series based on the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' game series. He also had roles in the TV series ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'', ''[[Hey Dude]]'',  and ''[[Miami Vice]]'', the 1992 film ''[[Stay Tuned (film)|Stay Tuned]]'', and was a recurring guest on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''. Albano played a villainous caricature of himself named "Captain Lou Morano" in the 1987 movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]'', starring [[Dirk Benedict]] and [[Roddy Piper]]. The film also featured cameo appearances by wrestlers [[Ric Flair]], [[Freddie Blassie]], and [[Bruno Sammartino]]. Albano played the role of the father in [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s music videos for "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]", "[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]"  and "[[She Bop]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://episodeguides.freeiz.com/actors.html |title=Actors, Actresses, Athletes, Celebrities & Famous People in Music Videos Database |publisher=Episodeguides.freeiz.com |access-date=March 19, 2012}}</ref> as well as a cook in the video for her song "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]".

==Personal life==
In 1953, Albano married his high school sweetheart, Geraldine Tango. The marriage lasted 56 years, until his death.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{cite news |title='Captain' Lou Albano dies |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/captain-lou-albano-dies-90040 |access-date=March 11, 2021 |work=Hollywood Reporter |date=October 14, 2009 |language=en}}</ref> Albano has been noted by several others for his faithfulness to his wife, a rare characteristic in the on-the-road world of 1970s and 1980s professional wrestling.<ref>Sammarino, Bruno.

Albano Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714215938/http://www.nyjnews.com/obits/Obit1.php?fulldate=April |date=July 14, 2011 }}, retrieved on October 15, 2009.</ref> Carl's students have noted that he used his brother Lou as an example of the difference between crazy and unique. George served as the principal of Lincoln Elementary School in [[Mount Vernon, New York]] and often brought Lou in to delight the school's students during their lunch hour. Vincent was an art teacher and lived part-time in a lake house in [[Connecticut]]. Eleanor was a music teacher for preschool students in [[Connecticut]] and impacts the lives of countless students through music.

Albano's son, Carl Albano, has been a member of the [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]] Legislature since 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Putnam County Legislature|url=http://www.putnamcountyny.com/legi/legislators/|website=Putnam County Online|publisher=Putnam County Online|access-date=January 1, 2018}}</ref> During the 1990s, Albano shed 150 pounds (70&nbsp;kg) following a health scare. In May 2005, Albano suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], but later recovered. Albano was sent home from the hospital and again began watching his health. The song "Captain Lou" by [[Kimya Dawson]] is dedicated to him. In 1983 the band [[NRBQ]] wrote a song about Albano called "Captain Lou". Albano was featured as a singer on that song as well on another called "Boardin' House Pie". Both of these songs appear on NRBQ's ''Tap Dancin' Bats'' compilation, their ''Lou and Q'' spoken-word comedy record, as well as their out-of-print, hard-to-find single which Albano used to sell at his wrestling matches.

==Death==
Albano died on October 14, 2009, in [[Westchester County, New York]], of a [[heart attack]] while residing in [[Hospice|hospice care]].<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/174674/pro-wrestler-music-video-icon-albano-dies-at-76 Pro wrestler, music video icon Albano dies at 76] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019113744/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/174674/pro-wrestler-music-video-icon-albano-dies-at-76 |date=October 19, 2009}}, retrieved on October 15, 2009.</ref> He was 76 years old.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter"/>
