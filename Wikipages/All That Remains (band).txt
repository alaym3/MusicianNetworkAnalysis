'''All That Remains''' is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], formed in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songresource.com/all-that-remains/|title=All That Remains – discography, line-up, biography, interviews, photos|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714164916/http://www.songresource.com/all-that-remains/|archive-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> They have released nine studio albums, a [[All That Remains: Live|live CD and DVD]], and have sold over a million records worldwide. The group currently consists of vocalist [[Philip Labonte]], rhythm guitarist Mike Martin, former [[Diecast (band)|Diecast]] drummer [[Jason Costa]], and lead guitarist [[Jason Richardson (musician)|Jason Richardson]], with Labonte being the last remaining original member. In spite of this, the band's line-up had remained consistent from the release of 2008's ''[[Overcome (All That Remains album)|Overcome]]'' until 2015's ''[[The Order of Things (album)|The Order of Things]]'', spanning four albums. This line-up changed, however, in September 2015, when long-time bassist [[Jeanne Sagan]] left the band, with Patrick taking her place and then again on February 5, 2019, when the band confirmed that Jason Richardson would be joining the band to replace the deceased lead guitarist and original member, [[Oli Herbert]]. In 2021, Aaron Patrick parted ways with All That Remains to focus on his other band, [[Bury Your Dead]].

Phil Labonte's lyrics focus on themes such as relationships, personal struggles, society, and hope.

All That Remains has been considered a notable act within the [[new wave of American heavy metal]].<ref name="Blabbermouth">{{cite web|title='New Wave of American Heavy Metal' Book Documents Over 600 Bands |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=44955 |website=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=April 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521104002/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=44955 |archive-date=May 21, 2008  }} "The book features over 600 bands, including: 3 Inches of Blood, A Life Once Lost, Alkaline Trio, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, Between the Buried and Me, Biohazard, Black Label Society, Bleeding Through, Bury the Dead, Byzantine, Cannae, Candiria, Cave In, Chimaira, Cky, Coalesce, Converge, Crisis, Damageplan, Darkest Hour, Devildriver, Diecast, Down, Drowning Pool, Eighteen Visions, Every Time I Die, From a Second Story Window, Glassjaw, God Forbid, Hatebreed, High on Fire, If Hope Dies, Ion Dissonance, Killswitch Engage, Kittie, Lamb of God, Machine Head, Martyr A.D., Mastodon, Misery Signals, Most Precious Blood, Neurosis, Norma Jean, Otep, Overcast, Pantera, Poison the Well, Premonitions of War, Pro-Pain, Rise Against, Remembering Never, Shadows Fall, Slipknot, Society 1, Still Remains, Strapping Young Lad, Stuck Mojo, Superjoint Ritual, Terror, The Acacia Strain, The Blamed, The Black Dahlia Murder, The Dillinger Escape Plan, The Red Chord, Throwdown, Trivium, Unearth, Winter Solstice, Zao and many, many more."</ref>

In response to the metalcore label, which the band has often been classified as, [[Phil Labonte]] said: {{cquote|We are a modern metal band, is really the best way to say it, you know. Because we've got [[guitar solo|solos]], we've got [[harmony|harmonies]], we've got some of the kind of breakdown-y. But, I mean, if you look at us as a metalcore band and then you look at, say, you know, [[Hatebreed]] as a metalcore band, which a lot of people say Hatebreed is a metalcore band because they've got some sort of metal-y riffs. But it's like we sound nothing alike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=12887 |title=Interview With Phil Labonte of All That Remains |publisher=Metal Underground |date=31 March 2005}}</ref>}}

However, the band's guitarist Mike Martin has rejected the metalcore label saying: {{cquote|Yeah, we're not [[Christianity|Christian]] and we're not metalcore, so tell the people on the message board to stop calling us that."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mishmashmagazine.com/tabid/106/itemid/647/All-That-Remains.aspx |title=All That Remains : Interview |publisher=Mishmash Magazine |date=20 July 2009}}</ref>}}

In an interview with Crypticrock, Mike Martin stated about their musical style: {{cquote|We've always wanted to have a lot of different kind of metal songs whether it was a [[ballad]], fast song, or [[death metal]] song. We've always been capable of doing every kind of song. We've always just done it no matter what the repercussions were because you know you are always going to get backlash. If you are going to write a record that is really heavy, and on the next record you have a ballad, people are going to get pissed. We never really look too much into it, we just wanted to do it, and so we pretty much did it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crypticrock.com/interview-mike-martin-of-all-that-remains/|title=» Interview – Mike Martin of All That Remains Cryptic Rock|website=Crypticrock.com|access-date=31 December 2015}}</ref>}}

In an interview with [[Blabbermouth.net]], Labonte stated: {{cquote|It's well documented that we like cheesy pop music. There's pictures of me wearing [[Fall Out Boy]] shirts! I listen to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and everyone knows that Mike and I love [[Nickelback]], and everyone is always listening to [[Dr. Dre]], or [[Snoop Dogg]], or [[Eminem]], or [[Jay-Z]], or just pop music! That song [[Fergalicious|Fergilicious]] is the new "hit" for All That Remains, it's the song we want to hear. Just a lot of garbage pop. It's kind of a joke because it's the stuff we like, and it's the stuff we want to hear, but we play it for everybody. So, it probably does come through, and it's something that we're aware of, and we're cool with it. If we can make songs that make sense as metal songs, and All That Remains songs, so why not let your influences come into it, just so long as it doesn't get hokey, or it doesn't hurt the song. You don't want to make a song "do something," you kind of want to let it go its own way. If it fits and works, then it fits and works, and if it doesn't work, you can't make it work or force it to work. We just go with what we think sounds good, and what feels right to us."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/all-that-remains-singer-it-s-well-documented-that-we-like-cheesy-pop-music/|title=All That Remains Singer: 'It's Well Documented That We Like Cheesy Pop Music' - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=31 December 2015}}</ref>}}
