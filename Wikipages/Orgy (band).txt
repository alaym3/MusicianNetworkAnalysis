'''Orgy''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1994, from Los Angeles, California.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book | first= Martin C. | last= Strong | year= 2000 | title= The Great Rock Discography | edition= 5th | publisher= Mojo Books | location= Edinburgh | page= 721 | isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> They have described their [[industrial rock]] music as "death pop".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punkstatikparanoia.com/2004/biog.php |title=Orgy // Punk Statik Paranoia |publisher=Punkstatikparanoia.com |access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> The band is best known for their [[cover version]] of the [[New Order (band)|New Order]] song "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]", and the song "[[Stitches (Orgy song)|Stitches]]", both from their 1998 album ''[[Candyass]]''.

==History==
===Early years (1994–1997)===
Orgy was formed in 1994 by vocalist [[Jay Gordon]] and guitarists [[Amir Derakh]] and [[Ryan Shuck]]. Bassist [[Paige Haley]] and drummer Bobby Hewitt soon completed the line-up. Derakh had previously gained some fame in the 1980s [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Rough Cutt]], and Hewitt was a former member of [[Electric Love Hogs]]. Gordon and Derakh were also experienced [[record producer|producers]], having produced [[Coal Chamber]]'s [[Coal Chamber (album)|self-titled album]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Within six months, [[Jonathan Davis]], who performed with Shuck in [[Sexart]], signed Orgy to [[Korn]]'s label [[Elementree Records]].

===''Candyass'' and ''Vapor Transmission'' (1998–2001)===
In 1998, Orgy released their debut album, ''[[Candyass]]'', the name inspired by a [[drag queen]] they had met. The album sold almost two million copies<ref name="yamaha">{{cite web|url=http://www.yamaha.com/Artists/ArtistDetail.html?CNTID=29312#|title=Amir Derakh – Bio|access-date=January 3, 2010|work=Yamaha}}</ref> and produced two singles: a cover of the [[New Order (band)|New Order]] song "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]", and "Stitches". Both charted on ''[[Total Request Live]]''. The song "Revival" featured Jonathan Davis.

Orgy made their live debut at EdgeFest, an annual radio show in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1998. They also appeared on the [[Family Values Tour]] with [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], and [[Rammstein]]. They were featured on the live compilation album of the tour, released in 1999.  Other tours with [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]] and [[Sugar Ray]] followed.

Their second album, the [[science fiction]]-themed ''[[Vapor Transmission]]'', was released in 2000, with "Fiction (Dreams in Digital)" and "Opticon" as singles.

===Side work and ''Punk Statik Paranoia'' (2001–2005)===
In 2001, Orgy released the song "Faces" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Zoolander]]''.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 3, 2010|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005O6HP|title=Zoolander [SOUNDTRACK] Various Artists}}</ref> The band was a musical guest in the television series ''[[Charmed]]'', performing "Opticon" in the episode "Sin Francisco".<ref name="yamaha" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewiccabox.co.uk/charmed/charmed_music.htm|access-date=January 3, 2009|title=Musical Guest Spots|publisher=The Wicca Box}}</ref>

In late 2003, guitarists Shuck and Derakh formed a side project, [[Julien-K]], as an outlet for electronic material they had come up with during the writing process for Orgy.<ref name="yamaha" /> Jay Gordon also remixed the [[Linkin Park]] track "Points of Authority" for their album ''[[Reanimation (Linkin Park album)|Reanimation]]'', where it was renamed "[[Pts.of.Athrty]]".

After the release of ''Vapor Transmission'', Orgy left [[Reprise Records]] and had already severed ties with Elementree. Gordon started his own independent record label, D1 Music, releasing the band's third album, ''[[Punk Statik Paranoia]]'', in 2004.

===Hiatus and return with new lineup (2005–present)===
When asked for an Orgy update in late July 2008, Shuck informed fans that Orgy's return is still underway but their priority is getting the much delayed [[Julien-K]] album released. During a video interview at the annual Californian [[NAMM]] 2009 convention, Derakh mentioned a 2010 Orgy reunion.

Shuck and Derakh released their first album as Julien-K, titled ''Death to Analog'', in March 2009. In the same year, they also released an album with [[Chester Bennington]] of [[Linkin Park]] under the name [[Dead by Sunrise]].

On October 25, 2010, Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh stated on the Julien-K blog: "As of Oct. 26th we will no longer be part of Orgy. Jay will continue making music without the original members."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.julien-k.com/forum/showthread.php?30240-Orgy-news&p=242340#post242340 |title=Orgy news |publisher=Julien-k.com |date=October 25, 2010 |access-date=July 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713125032/http://www.julien-k.com/forum/showthread.php?30240-Orgy-news&p=242340#post242340 |archive-date=July 13, 2011 }}</ref>

On October 30, 2010, Jay Gordon released a statement via his official [[Facebook]] profile stating that he still owns the Orgy name and wants to continue forth creating new material for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/jaygordonmusic |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref> Gordon wrote that all previous members of the band were too busy with numerous side projects to continue with the original band. "Everyone has been so busy with their different projects I figured this was the only way for me to continue on with the name. I started this band, and I don't want to let it fall to the wayside completely."

On November 7, 2011, [[Blabbermouth.net]] published a news story detailing the bitter feud between Gordon and guitarists Shuck and Derakh, that had spiraled out of control after Gordon revealed his plans to assemble a band of musicians and begin touring under the name Orgy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=165775 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120911005144/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=165775 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 11, 2012 |title=Former ORGY Members Slam JAY GORDON For Pulling An 'Axle Rose' |work=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=November 8, 2011 }}</ref>

On February 3, 2012, it was announced that Orgy would embark on a five-week run titled the ''Bad Blood Tour''. Gordon was the only original member of Orgy appearing on this tour.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=169160 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120911085042/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=169160 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 11, 2012 |title=New ORGY Lineup Preparing To Hit The Road |work=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=February 3, 2012 }}</ref>

On August 4, 2012, Orgy linked to a 30-second demo of a new song, "Grime of the Century", via their [[Twitter]] and Facebook page. The song "Grime of the Century" was later made available on [[iTunes]] and the new Orgy website.

In 2013, Orgy embarked on the ''Wide Awake and Dead Tour'' with [[Vampires Everywhere!]] and [[Davey Suicide]].

Orgy launched a [[crowdfunding]] campaign in August 2013 via [[Indiegogo|Indiegogo.com]] with a $100,000 goal. Two months later, at the conclusion of the campaign, the band had only raised $8,739, falling short of their goal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/orgy-music#/|title=Orgy Music|website=Indiegogo.com|language=en-US|access-date=February 12, 2018}}</ref>

On February 23, 2014, the band announced through their official website that the new single "Wide Awake and Dead" will be available through iTunes and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] on March 18, 2014. The "Wide Awake and Dead" video was filmed on April 22.<ref>{{cite web|title= Jay Gordon posted: Shooting Wide Awake & Dead video Tues in Hollywood|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=498416186926329&id=177885225646095&notif_t=notify_me|website=Facebook.com|date=April 20, 2014|access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, they released their first collection of new music in 11 years, an EP titled ''Talk Sick''. Originally, it was to be followed with another EP titled ''Entropy'',<ref>{{cite web|title= Orgy To Release Talk Sick EP|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/orgy-to-release-talk-sick-ep-embark-on-u-s-tour/|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=August 5, 2015}}</ref> but Gordon later told ''Westward Magazine'' the band would instead release it as a full-length album,<ref name="Westward">{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/new-and-improved-orgy-comes-to-denver-7516940|title=New and Improved Orgy Comes To Denver|first=Brett|last=Callwood|date=January 18, 2016|website=Westword.com}}</ref> that has yet to materialize.
