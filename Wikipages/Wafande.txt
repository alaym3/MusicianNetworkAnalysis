==Life==
Wafande, born to an African father, a musician, and a Danish-French mother has roots in Denmark, France, Tanzania, Congo, Malawi and Oman. He was born with music in his blood. "My father was a musician, he was a blues singer. I grew up with a lot of Ray Charles, and Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Big Mama Thornton. My dad used to play everything. He had a huge record collection. I remember I had a lot of fun with that record player."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ventsmagazine.com/2016/08/14/black-dylan-release-new-music-video|title=Black Dylan release a new music video|website=Ventsmagazine.com|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>

For some years, Wafande's studies and his basketball skills took the upper hand, but at the point when real choices had to be made, Wafande chose his music career over the one as an elite basketball player.

The music choice paid off; Wafande's track record of so far is three platinum and two gold singles and two top ten solo albums of which one gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berlingske.dk/aok/wafande-jeg-er-et-gadekryds|title=Wafande jeg er et gadekryds|website=Berlinske.dk|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref>
