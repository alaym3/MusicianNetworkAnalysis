===1990s return===
Beenie Man continued performing and honed his craft beside the then dominant dancehall figures including [[Ninjaman]], [[Admiral Bailey]] and [[Shabba Ranks]]. He found his artistic home at the Shocking Vibes studio where he continued to record singles with only moderate success in the early 1990s. His career gained momentum after a performance at the [[Reggae Sunsplash]] festival in 1992, and a rivalry with [[Bounty Killer]] began the following year after Beenie Man was accused of stealing Bounty Killer's style and catch phrases.<ref name="Thompson" /> The rivalry was captured on the 1994 album ''Guns Out'', with the two artists settling the feud with a soundclash.<ref name="Thompson" /> Beenie Man had his first number one single in Jamaica in 1993 with "Matie" (Produced by Ephraim Barrett, Donovan and Dave Mills on the Shelly Power Records label) and he won the DJ of the Year Award the same year, the first of eight consecutive awards.<ref name="Jackson" />

===International stardom===
Partially as a result of prodding from his producers, [[Sly and Robbie]], with whom he recorded [[cover version]]s of [[Bob Marley]]'s "Crazy Baldhead" and "No Woman No Cry" in 1994, the latter a Jamaican chart-topper, Beenie Man converted to the [[Rastafari movement]], as did several of his contemporaries at the time, although in 2005 he stated "I have not converted. I was baptised an [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and at the age of 10 I became a Judah Coptic."<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Roper" /> In 1994, he was signed by [[Island Records]] and released the critically acclaimed album ''[[Blessed (Beenie Man album)|Blessed]]'', which established his reputation internationally.<ref name="Thompson" /> In 1995 he toured the UK and joined up again with Barrington Levy to record an updated [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] version of Levy's "Under Mi Sensi".<ref name="Thompson" />

In 1995, Beenie Man collaborated with [[Dennis Brown]] and [[Triston Palma]] to release ''Three Against War'' and [[Mad Cobra]] and [[Lieutenant Stitchie]] on ''Mad Cobra Meets Lt. Stitchie & Beenie Man''. He also collaborated with [[Lady Saw]] on "Healing", [[Sanchez (singer)|Sanchez]] on "Refugee", and [[Michael Prophet]] on "Gun 'n' Bass", further establishing his reputation.<ref name="Thompson" /> He took another step up the ladder in 1996, releasing the seminal ''Maestro'', produced by Patrick Roberts and shot him to UK fame. During the period from the mid to late 1990s, Beenie Man dominated the Jamaican charts to the extent that he perhaps had a good claim to the crown of "Dancehall King", a title only bestowed previously on [[Yellowman]] in the early 1980s.
Beenie Man's first real break into the United States came in 1997. He heard an instrumental rhythm by an unknown producer named Jeremy Harding, and demanded to add his voice to the rhythm. So this was the birth of his first international hit; he recorded "[[Who Am I (Beenie Man song)|Who Am I]]" and the single quickly went Gold. It opened the doors for the world to see a new reggae star in the pages of Newsweek and other major media outlets. The same year, Beenie Man topped the Jamaican singles chart with seven different singles.<ref name="Thompson" />

Beenie Man appeared as himself in the 1997 film ''[[Dancehall Queen]]''.

In 1998, Beenie Man headlined Reggae Sunsplash and signed to [[Virgin Records]] to release albums in the United States. His first American offering was ''The Doctor'' (1998). During the late 1990s, Beenie Man began his conquest of America with the hits, "Romie", "Who Am I", and "[[Girls Dem Sugar]]", which featured American [[R&B]] singer, [[Mýa]].  During this time he received an impressive number of international music awards including a [[MOBO Awards|MOBO Award]] for Best International Reggae Act in 1998,<ref name="Rodgers">Rodgers, Jennifer (1998) [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/music-toasting-the-many-moods-of-beenie-man-1143114.html "Music: Toasting the many moods of Beenie Man"], ''[[The Independent]], 6 February 1998</ref> while remaining at the top of the local charts. In 2000, Beenie Man released ''Art & Life'', which featured [[Arturo Sandoval]] and [[Wyclef Jean]] ([[The Fugees]]), for which received a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Reggae Album.<ref name="Thompson" /> In the same year he co-produced (with [[Wyclef Jean]]) the debut album by actor [[Steven Seagal]].<ref name="Thompson" /> Beenie Man, like many dancehall artists, is outspoken on a number of social issues, as exemplified by songs such as "Steve Biko" and "Murderer".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458078/20021011/beenie_man.jhtml|title='Dr. Beenie Man' Heals NY Crowd With Dancehall, Prayer, Pelvic Gyrations|work=MTV News|access-date=12 July 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.yardflex.com/archives/001742.html "Beenie Man blames government for problems"]. 31 October 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.caribbeanworldnews.com/stories_one.php?sid=875 "Beenie Man Apologies To JLP Government"], ''Hardbeatnews''.

In 2002, he had a sizeable hit with a duet with [[Janet Jackson]] called "[[Feel It Boy]]", but his biggest break in America came in early 2004 with the release of a remix of "[[Dude (Beenie Man song)|Dude]]", featuring guest vocals by fellow Jamaican Ms. Thing as well as rhymes by [[Shawnna]]. He thus cemented his fan base on both sides of the Atlantic.

He had hits in the UK in 1998 with "Who am I" (#10), in 2003 with "Street Life" (#13) and "[[Feel It Boy]]" (UK #9), a duet with [[Janet Jackson]], and in 2004 with "Dude" (#7) and "King of the Dancehall" (#14).<ref>[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ Beenie Man], Official Charts</ref> Also in 2004, The Associated Press observed that Beenie Man had "become a name-brand artist worldwide" and called him "king of the dancehall reggae scene".<ref>{{cite web|date=19 July 2004|title=Beenie Man makes music to dance to|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/beenie-man-makes-music-dance-wbna5462753|access-date=8 October 2020|website=Today|publisher=Associated Press}}</ref>

He was also a judge for the 6th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2007.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005194007/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2007.asp|url-status=dead|title=Independent Music Awards – 6th Annual Judges|archive-date=5 October 2009}}</ref>

In April 2008, it was announced that Beenie Man was to co-write and star in the film ''Kingston''.<ref name="Peru">Peru, Yasmine (2008) [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/lifestyle/html/20080425T000000-0500_134921_OBS_BEENIE_MAN_TO_CO_WRITE__STAR_IN_MOVIE.asp "Beenie Man to co-write, star in movie"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024095839/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/lifestyle/html/20080425T000000-0500_134921_OBS_BEENIE_MAN_TO_CO_WRITE__STAR_IN_MOVIE.asp |date=24 October 2009 }}, ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 25 April 2008</ref>
In October 2010, Beenie Man came out with the EP ''I'm Drinking Rum and Red Bull'', which included four songs, "Im drinking Rum and Red Bull", "I'm Okay", and two versions of "Stack and Pile". He later released the full album on 28 February 2011. "Im Drinking Rum and Red Bull" features Future Fambo.
In September 2008, Beenie Man was cleared of charges of tax evasion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN2331887120071023?feedType=RSS&feedName=entertainmentNews | title=Reggae artist Beenie Man faces arrest in tax case | date=23 October 2007 | work=Reuters}}</ref><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7645654.stm "Beenie Man cleared of tax evasion"], [[BBC]], 1 October 2008</ref>

In April 2009, Beenie Man signed with Brookland Entertainment, a new record label formed by [[Eric Nicks]] and The Trackmasters, in preparation to release his new album ''The Legend Returns'', the music video for the release of his new single "Gimme Gimme" being shot in Canada on 18 April 2009. The song "Let's Go" was released on the ''Overproof Riddim'' compilation album in 2011.

In 2014, Beenie Man and long-term rival Bounty Killer put aside their differences and recorded a single together, "Legendary".<ref>Morgan, Simone (2014) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/enterta" inment/LEGENDARY-COLLAB_17863284 Legendary Collab]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 4 November 2014.

===Yellowman feud===
In 2006, veteran deejay [[Yellowman]] publicly chastised Beenie Man for his hit "[[King of the Dancehall (song)|King of the Dancehall]]". Known as "King Yellowman" since the 1980s, the deejay took exception to Beenie Man proclaiming himself "king", as well as comments Beenie made regarding his appearance. Regarding the title of "king", Yellowman stated: "Him trying to make people feel like him was here before me, but him never deh here before me, because dem planning to do dem official crowning them claim say is an official crowning but dem a use some a di media as some of them organisation ...".<ref>{{cite news|last=Anglin-Christie|first=Kavelle|title=Long live the 'King'....
