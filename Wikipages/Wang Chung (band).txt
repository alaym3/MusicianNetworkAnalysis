'''Wang Chung''' are an English [[New wave music|new wave]] band, formed in [[London]] in 1980 by [[Nick Feldman]], [[Jack Hues]] and Darren Costin. The name Wang Chung means "yellow bell" in Chinese ({{lang|zh|黃鐘}}, {{zh|p=huáng zhōng|w=huang chung}}), and is the first note in the [[shí-èr-lǜ|Chinese classical music scale]]. The band found their greatest success in the US, with five Top 40 hits there, all charting between 1983 and 1987, including "[[Dance Hall Days]]" (No.&nbsp;16 in 1984), "[[Everybody Have Fun Tonight]]" (No.&nbsp;2 in 1986) and "[[Let's Go! (Wang Chung song)|Let's Go!]]" (No.&nbsp;9 in 1987).

==Career==
===1977–1979: Early years===
Jeremy Ryder, known professionally as [[Jack Hues]] ([[singing|vocalist]]/[[guitarist]]), and [[Nick Feldman]] (guitar) would eventually form the core of Wang Chung. They first met when Hues answered Feldman's advertisement for musicians in the classifieds section of the weekly British music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1977.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1975-1979.shtml|title=Biography 1975 - 1979|date=13 November 2019|website=WangChung|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113144552/http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1975-1979.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-13|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref> They were joined by Bud Merrick on bass and [[Paul Hammond (musician)|Paul Hammond]] (ex-[[Atomic Rooster]]) on drums, forming the Intellektuals.<ref name=":0" />

In less than a year, that band split up. Hues and Feldman then joined up with future Wang Chung drummer Darren Costin, bassist [[Leigh Gorman]], keyboardist Simon Campbell and vocalist [[Glenn Gregory]], to form 57 Men. This band lasted for about eighteen months before breaking up.<ref name="discussion"/> Gorman would go on to play bass in [[Adam and the Ants]], Gregory went on to become the vocalist for [[Heaven 17]], and Gorman later played in [[Bow Wow Wow]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name="discussion"/>

Hues, Feldman and Costin stayed together and renamed themselves Huang Chung.<ref name="discussion"/> According to Feldman, he came across the term "Huang Chung," meaning "yellow bell" in Mandarin, in a book he was reading, and used it as the name for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kearth101.cbslocal.com/2013/08/09/wang-chung-explains-the-meaning-of-everybody-wang-chung-tonight|title=Wang Chung Explains The Meaning Of "Everybody Wang Chung Tonight"|date=9 August 2013|first=Britt|last=Bickel|work=K-EARTH 101}}</ref>

===1980–1982: Huang Chung years===
At the beginning of Huang Chung's career, all the members performed under pseudonyms. Jeremy Ryder was "Jack Hues" (a play on [[Emile Zola]]'s 1898 French open letter ''[[J'Accuse…!]]''), Nick Feldman was "Nick DeSpig", and Darren Costin was "Darren Darwin" (and later, just "Darwin").<ref name="discussion">{{cite web|url=http://www.discussionsmagazine.com/2013/08/an-exclusive-interview-with-wang-chungs.html|title=An EXCLUSIVE Interview With WANG CHUNG's Jack Hues!|date=1 August 2013|author=Stephen SPAZ Schnee|work=Discussion Magazine.com}}</ref> The band then signed to a label called 101 Records. The first Huang Chung release, "Baby I'm Hu-man", appeared on a 101 compilation album in 1980. Three live tracks were subsequently released on another 101 Records compilation in 1981.

Later in 1980, the independent record company Rewind Records signed the band for a two-single deal. Huang Chung's debut single for Rewind Records was "Isn't It About Time We Were on TV", followed by "Stand Still".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wangchung.com/archive/hc/singles/index.shtml|title=Archive - Huang Chung Singles|date=13 November 2006|website=WangChung|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113150741/http://www.wangchung.com/archive/hc/singles/index.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-13|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1980-1984.shtml|title=Biography 1980 - 1984|date=13 November 2006|website=WangChung|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113144416/http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1980-1984.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-13|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref> Neither single charted, but the group had begun to attract the attention of [[Arista Records]], who signed them on a two-album deal in early 1981. Around the same time, the group expanded to a quartet, with the addition of sax player Dave Burnand. In keeping with the all-pseudonymous nature of the band, Burnand was known as "Hogg Robinson" for the first Arista single, and later, simply as "Hogg".<ref name=":1" />

Under the direction of producer [[Rhett Davies]], Huang Chung issued two singles on Arista in 1981, neither of which charted. A third single, produced by [[Roger Bechirian]], appeared in early 1982; it too failed to chart. The band's [[Huang Chung (album)|first album]] was issued in 1982. Self-titled, it compiled the three non-charting Arista A-sides, one of the Arista B-sides, and six other new tracks. Like the associated singles, the ''Huang Chung'' album failed to chart.

At the time the band's self-titled album was issued, Hues, DeSpig and Burnand also contributed to the lone LP by the mysterious pseudonymous group [[Blanket of Secrecy]].<ref name=":1" /> Hues and DeSpig wrote the song "Lovers" for the album, and Hues scored the strings for that song, while Burnand played sax on the album. Despite some speculation at the time, no member of Huang Chung was actually a member of Blanket of Secrecy — that band consisted of [[Roger Bechirian]], Andrew Howell and Pete Marsh, operating under the pseudonyms Tinker, Soldier, and Tailor.

In late 1982, Huang Chung returned to the studio to start work on their second album for Arista Records. A new single, "Dance Hall Days", was produced by [[Tim Friese-Greene]] and appeared as both a 7" and 12" single in October, but did not chart. The band were still a quartet at this point, with Feldman dropping the assumed "De Spig" surname and billing himself simply as "Nick".

After the failure of "Dance Hall Days", the group's manager, [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]], convinced Arista to close their contract with Huang Chung, and instead placed the band with American label [[Geffen Records]],<ref name=":1" /> making the group the second UK-based act to be signed to Geffen worldwide after [[Asia (band)|Asia]] (not counting then-New York-based John Lennon in 1980). Burnand left the group around this time, citing "musical differences".<ref name=":1" />

===1983–1985: Name change and initial success===
[[File:Wang Chung.jpg|thumb|Nick Feldman and Jack Hues, 1986]]
In 1983 they were still billed under the band name "Huang Chung" at [[BBC 2]] music show ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]''.

At this juncture, according to Hues, the band changed the spelling of their name to ''Wang Chung'', at Geffen's suggestion, to make the pronunciation easier for English-speakers.<ref name="discussion"/>

At the same time, Nick Feldman and Darren Costin opted to be billed under their real full names; only Jack Hues kept his pseudonym. The band spent most of 1983 recording their second album, ''[[Points on the Curve]]''. Released in January 1984, the album yielded two moderately successful hits, "Don't Let Go" (No.&nbsp;38 US) and a re-recorded version of "[[Dance Hall Days]]" (No.&nbsp;16 US, No.&nbsp;21 UK). The popularity of the latter song gave Wang Chung the ability to spend two months touring the [[United States]] on their own and with [[the Romantics]] and [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]].<ref name=":1" /> In 1984 they would be the opening act for [[the Cars]] on their "[[Heartbeat City]]" tour; Costin would leave the band following this tour,<ref name=":1" /> and went on to form his own group, Heroes, which released the album ''Here We Are'' on [[RCA Records]] in 1987.<ref>[https://trouserpress.com/reviews/huang-chung/ Huang Chung]. ''[[Trouser Press]]''.</ref>

In late 1983, Hues and Feldman collaborated in a one-off project with vocalist [[David Van Day]]. A demo of the track "Ringing the Bell" was submitted to David by their publisher as one of many songs for consideration by David as a possible follow up to his hit "Young Americans Talking". It was recorded in November 1983 but remained unreleased for some time before eventually surfacing under the band name ''Music Academy'' in 1985. Wang Chung followed up the release of ''Points on the Curve'' with a spate of soundtrack work. Director [[William Friedkin]] specifically sought out Wang Chung to score his 1985 film ''[[To Live and Die in L.A. (film)|To Live and Die in L.A]]''.

The resulting [[To Live and Die in L.A. (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] became the group's third album, and is recognizable as one of their more mainstream works. It went top ten on the US Billboard chart for soundtracks. The band recorded "Fire in the Twilight" for the 1985 [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] film ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' and contributed "There is a Nation" for the soundtrack to ''First Born''.<ref name=":1" /> With Costin gone, Hues and Feldman continued to record new material, employing producer Peter Wolf as their new drummer (although he never became an official member of the band).

===1986–1989: US commercial peak===
Wang Chung released their fourth album, ''[[Mosaic (Wang Chung album)|Mosaic]]'', in 1986. This album spun off their biggest hits: "[[Everybody Have Fun Tonight]]" (No.&nbsp;2 US) and "[[Let's Go! (Wang Chung song)|Let's Go!]]" (No.&nbsp;9 US). "Everybody Have Fun Tonight" features the lyric "Everybody Wang Chung tonight", and also has a [[music video]] (directed by [[Godley & Creme]]) where virtually every frame featured a [[jump cut]]. During some US dates in the Summer 1987, they were the opening act for Tina Turner during her ''Break Every Rule'' world tour.

Their final US Top 40 single, "[[Hypnotize Me (Wang Chung song)|Hypnotize Me]]" (No.&nbsp;36), was also from the same album, and also was featured on the soundtrack of the 1987 film ''[[Innerspace]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1985-1989.shtml|title=Biography 1985 - 1989|date=13 November 2006|website=WangChung|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113144416/http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1985-1989.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-13|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref> Wang Chung released their fifth album, ''[[The Warmer Side of Cool]]'', in 1989. The album featured "[[Praying to a New God]]" (No.&nbsp;63 US), which charted but was not a hit. The album was considered a commercial disappointment. Hues and Feldman then went on to other projects and the band effectively disbanded in 1990.

===1990–1997: Hiatus===
During the 1990s, Feldman joined up with Jon Moss of [[Culture Club]] to form the band Promised Land, and subsequently released their self-titled debut album, ''Promised Land'', in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wangchung.com/archive/nf/pl/promised.shtml|title=Archive - Nick Feldman Promised Land|date=13 November 2006|website=WangChung|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113145131/http://www.wangchung.com/archive/nf/pl/promised.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-13|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref> Also in the 1990s, Hues worked on various film soundtracks, including 1990's ''[[The Guardian (1990 film)|The Guardian]]''. He was signed to a solo deal by [[Sony Records]] in the early 1990s, but his intended debut solo album, ''The Anatomy Lesson'', was shelved by the label and remains unreleased.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1990-1994.shtml|title=Biography 1990 - 1994|date=13 November 2006|website=WangChung|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113144437/http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1990-1994.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-13|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref> Hues later teamed up with [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] to form the one-off group ''[[Strictly Inc]]'', which released a self-titled album in 1995.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/strictly-inc-mn0000307910|title=Strictly Inc.|last=McMullen|first=Steve|website=AllMusic|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref>

===1997–2016: Reformation===
1997 saw the return of Wang Chung, still consisting of Hues and Feldman, with a greatest hits collection entitled ''[[Everybody Wang Chung Tonight: Wang Chung's Greatest Hits]].'' Included on this CD was a new single, "Space Junk". The group also toured North America around this time to promote the new compilation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1995-1999.shtml|title=Biography 1995 - 1999|date=13 November 2006|website=WangChung|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113144609/http://www.wangchung.com/bio/1995-1999.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-13|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref> A 2000 edition of Wang Chung played several dates in the United States, both headlining their own tour and also a part of the Club 80s Flashback Tour with [[A Flock of Seagulls]], [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]], and [[Gene Loves Jezebel]] with [[Michael Aston]]. Hues was the only original member of this iteration of the band, as Feldman bowed out due to other commitments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wangchung.com/bio/2000-2004.shtml|title=Biography 2000 - 2004|date=13 November 2006|website=WangChung|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113144455/http://www.wangchung.com/bio/2000-2004.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-13|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref>

In March 2005, Wang Chung (once again consisting of Hues and Feldman) contributed "Akasha", a previously unreleased song, to the ''[[Of Hands and Hearts]]'' compilation, in response to the 2004 Southeast Asia tsunami crisis. In June 2005, Wang Chung appeared on the reality [[TV series]] ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me Baby One More Time]]'', performing "Everybody Have Fun Tonight" and a cover of "[[Hot in Herre]]" by [[Nelly]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wangchung.com/bio/2005-2010/hitmebaby.shtml|title=Biography 2005 - 2010 Hit Me Baby One More Time|date=13 November 2006|website=WangChung|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113150243/http://www.wangchung.com/bio/2005-2010/hitmebaby.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-13|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref>
