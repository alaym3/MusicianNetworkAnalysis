'''The Zutons''' are an English [[indie rock]] band, formed in 2001 in [[Liverpool]]. They released their debut album, ''[[Who Killed...... The Zutons?]]'' in May 2004 and achieved chart success with "[[Why Won't You Give Me Your Love?]]" and "[[Valerie (The Zutons song)|Valerie]]", both taken from their second studio album ''[[Tired of Hanging Around]]'' in 2006. Both singles reached number 9 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

The band quietly disbanded in 2009, several months after they released the third studio album, ''[[You Can Do Anything]]'' in June 2008, with no official announcement. They ultimately reunited in September 2016 for a one-off show billed as "probably [the] last ever" in celebration of their friend, actor and former [[Tramp Attack]] frontman Kristian Ealey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolconfidential.co.uk/entertainment/zutons-reunited-for-last-ever-show|title=Zutons Reunited for 'last ever show' |website=Liverpoolconfidential.co.uk}}</ref>  The band remained in contact and in November 2018 announced a spring 2019 tour to commemorate and perform their debut album.<ref name=reunion>{{cite tweet|user=ZutonsThe|number=1067051597824319489|title==Hi everyone!

==History==
===Formation===
The Zutons formed in [[Liverpool]] in 2001, taking their name from [[Captain Beefheart]]'s Magic Band guitarist [[Zoot Horn Rollo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/TRAVEL/10/17/liverpool.qa/|work=cnn.com|title=Q&A: The Zutons|date=23 October 2006}}</ref> [[Dave McCabe]] had previously been in the band Tramp Attack. Both Pritchard and Payne were members of [[Edgar Jones (musician)|Edgar Jones]]' post [[The Stairs|Stairs]] band The Big Kids (with Sean's brother [[Howie Payne]] of [[The Stands]]). The band was originally a four-piece, before Payne's girlfriend Abi Harding began joining The Zutons on stage for a couple of songs mid-set, playing simple [[saxophone]] lines. The other band members liked the way her saxophone enhanced their sound and Harding became a full member, contributing vocals and sax.

Deltasonic head Alan Wills was initially dubious about the musical talents of McCabe: "I'd heard other bands Dave had played in and I thought they were all rubbish".<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> [[The Coral]]'s [[James Skelly]] was persistent in trying to convince Wills of his friend's potential and the breakthrough finally came when the bedroom demos of the newly formed Zutons persuaded the Deltasonic head into working with them.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

At first, the band had to battle comparisons to [[The Coral]]. Both bands were [[Merseyside]] bands prominent members of the [[Liverpool music scene]], on the same record label, shared the same producer, [[Ian Broudie]], and were good friends, with McCabe having previously written songs with [[James Skelly]].<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AlanWills_int.html |title=Interview with Alan Wills |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=24 May 2004 |access-date=25 November 2010}}</ref> The band's music has proved difficult to categorize, being described as "psychedelic cartoon punk".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brits.co.uk/artists/The_Zutons/ |title=The BRIT Awards 2012 |website=Brits.co.uk |access-date=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419025823/http://www.brits.co.uk/artists/The_Zutons/ |archive-date=19 April 2012}}</ref> McCabe, who is also the lead songwriter, includes amongst his influences [[Talking Heads]], [[Devo]], [[Sly & the Family Stone]], [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and [[Madness (band)|Madness]].

===Early singles and ''Who Killed...... The Zutons?'' (2002–2005)===
The first record the band put out was the 3-track CD ''[[Devil's Deal]]'', released in September 2002. The following spring they released ''Creepin' and a Crawlin','' and then the download-only single "Haunts Me" in November 2003. The band's "Z" logo was changed early in 2004 to avoid confusion with the [[Zenith Electronics Corporation|Zenith]] logo.

The Zutons' debut [[album]], ''[[Who Killed...... The Zutons?]]'' was released in April 2004, and initially reached No.&nbsp;13 in the UK album chart. However, after nearly a year later, it managed to move up to No.&nbsp;9 in early 2005. The LP had a specially printed [[Anaglyph image|3-D]] cover and came with Zutons [[Anaglyph glasses#Viewing|3-D viewing glasses]], which many fans then wore to their concerts. Early copies of the album also included a bonus 4-track CD of alternative versions of their songs. The album was critically acclaimed and was a nominee for the 2004 [[Mercury Music Prize]]. The band themselves were nominated for the British Breakthrough Act award at the 2005 [[BRIT Awards]]. The album was later re-issued following the single "[[Don't Ever Think (Too Much)]]", with that song being added as track 13. The track "[[Confusion (The Zutons song)|Confusion]]" was used in a [[Peugeot 307]] car advert in the UK during 2004-2005. In the United States, the song "[[Pressure Point (song)|Pressure Point]]" was featured in a commercial for Levi's. This song was also featured in the video game [[MVP Baseball 2005]]. The album went on to sell 581,081 copies by July 2006.

===''Tired of Hanging Around'' (2006–2007)===
The new album ''[[Tired of Hanging Around]]'' was released on 17 April 2006 and reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK album charts. The first single from the album "[[Why Won't You Give Me Your Love?]]" and the second single "[[Valerie (The Zutons song)|Valerie]]" both peaked at 9 in the charts, a fair achievement considering their highest place previously had been with the single "Don't Ever Think (Too Much)" at 15. The band toured the UK in May 2006 following the release of this album. They played at the [[Jersey Live]] Festival on 2 September 2006 before their second UK tour which began in November 2006. In October 2006, they performed at [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (2006)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]]. On [[New Year's Eve]] 2006, the Zutons appeared on [[Jools Holland]]'s annual [[Hootenanny (UK TV series)|''Hootenanny'']] on [[BBC]] television on which they performed their songs "Valerie", "Why Don't You Give Me Your Love?" and "It's The Little Things We Do."

As the November tour began, the band gave an interview to [[STV (TV network)|STV]] discussing songwriting, making videos and their American dates with [[The Killers]]. In a separate interview, Payne complained about the tendency of music writers and magazines to generalise a particular city as the breeding ground of new 'movements', "A lot of bands get lumped in when they're in the same neck of the woods and journalists–especially in England–like to make a big deal out of that and make it into a scene, as if the individual bands aren't good enough to write about."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukula.com/TorontoArticle.aspx?SectionID=2&ObjectID=1251&CityID=3 |title=The Zutons at Ukula Magazine|website=Ukula.com|access-date=12 December 2012}}</ref>

The band announced on 13 July 2007 that guitarist Boyan Chowdhury had left The Zutons, citing "musical differences".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-zutons/29685|title=Zutons guitarist quits band|access-date=13 July 2007|date=13 July 2007|website=Nme.com}}</ref> Although the band claimed Chowdhury's departure was a mutual decision, bassist Russell Pritchard remarked that "it was like splitting up with someone". In late 2007, Paul Molloy formerly of The Skylarks and [[The Stands]] joined the band.

===''You Can Do Anything'' and split (2008–2009)===
The band released their third studio album titled ''[[You Can Do Anything]]'' on 2 June 2008. It was the band's first album to feature Molloy on lead guitar. The first single was "[[Always Right Behind You]]" which was released on 26 May 2008. The album was recorded earlier in the year in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]]. On 17 May 2008 The Zutons appeared on [[Soccer AM]] as guest stars. They performed "Always Right Behind You" at the end to celebrate the last show of the season. In the summer of 2008, The Zutons had their first UK tour in 2 years. They were scheduled to play seven gigs in forest settings as part of The [[Forestry Commission]]'s [[Forest Tour]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-7BUKUQ|title=The Zutons Live Music Tour 2008|access-date=23 June 2008|publisher=Forestry Commission|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705024759/http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-7BUKUQ|archive-date=5 July 2008}}</ref>

On 26 July 2008, The Zutons performed at Japan's [[Fuji Rock Festival]] for a third time. On 30 August 2008, the band appeared at the Indie Festival, [[Jersey Live]], headlining the festival along with [[The Prodigy]].<ref>[http://www.smash-uk.com/frf08/lineup.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602230713/http://www.smash-uk.com/frf08/lineup.html |date=2 June 2008 }}</ref> Over the 2008 Christmas holidays, the Zutons were dropped from Sony/BMG.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nme.com/news/the-zutons/42061|title = The Zutons dropped by record label|date = 14 January 2009|website = NME}}</ref>

Following a run of 2009 festival performances including Summer Sundae in Leicester and Wickerman Festival, the band quietly disbanded.

===Post split and reunions===
Pritchard joined [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]], Molloy collaborated with Sean's sister, [[Candie Payne]], before forming Serpent Power with Ian Skelly and joining [[The Coral]] and Sean Payne recorded with [[Miles Kane]].

With two of them it's personal issues and Russ plays with Noel Gallagher." He also revealed that the band almost reformed in 2014 to mark the tenth anniversary of the band's debut album but that, "if The Zutons were ever to reform properly, I don't think it would be the original line-up".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmovemagazine.com/the-zutons-reunion-dave-mccabe-liverpool-tribute-gig/19730|title=The Zutons reunion: Dave McCabe gears up for Liverpool tribute gig|date=2 September 2016|website=Youmovemagazine.com|language=en-US|access-date=29 September 2016}}</ref>
