'''Neon Trees''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Provo, Utah]]. The band received nationwide exposure in late 2008 when they opened several North American tour dates for the band [[The Killers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/537956|title=Neon Trees Generate Killer Buzz|publisher=Bmi.com|date=2009-02-18|access-date=2011-09-28}}</ref> Not long after, the band was signed by [[Mercury Records]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dionne|first=Jared|url=http://theithacan.org/271|title=Adolescence-inspired lyrics and vocals set tone on CD|work=The Ithacan|date=2010-04-01|access-date=2012-09-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226115539/http://theithacan.org/271|archive-date=2010-12-26}}</ref> Their first single, "[[Animal (Neon Trees song)|Animal]]", climbed to No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Alternative Songs]] chart.

Since their formation, Neon Trees has released four studio albums: ''[[Habits (album)|Habits]]'' (2010), ''[[Picture Show (album)|Picture Show]]'' (2012), ''[[Pop Psychology (album)|Pop Psychology]]'' (2014), and ''[[I Can Feel You Forgetting Me]]'' (2020). The band has also released three EPs and eighteen singles.

==History==
Formed initially by childhood friends [[Tyler Glenn]] ([[lead vocals|vocals]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]) and Chris Allen ([[guitar]], [[backing vocals|vocals]]) who both grew up in [[Murrieta, California]], the band made its first home in Provo after Glenn and Allen moved there from Southern California, eventually adding Branden Campbell ([[bass guitar]], vocals) and [[Elaine Bradley]] ([[drumkit|drums]], [[percussion]], vocals) to the lineup.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rose|first=Bella|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-neon-trees-tyler-glenn-slam-mormon-church-in-new-solo-video-20160429|title=Artist Interview: Tyler Glenn of the Neon Trees|publisher=Hotzoneonline.com|date=March 1, 2010|access-date=2011-09-28}}</ref> David Charles also plays with the band as touring guitarist.<ref>[http://www.fameisdead.com/mediaplayer.aspx?meid=3069]</ref>

They first started playing under the name Neon Trees in late 2005 with five original members, Tyler Glenn and Chris Allen from California, and three veterans of the Utah music scene, bass player Mike Liechty, drummer Jason Gibbons and keyboardist Nathan Evans. The band's name originates from the lighted trees on the [[In-N-Out Burger]] signs, which inspired Tyler Glenn. In a strange coincidence, it was later learned that Branden Campbell's father, Steve Campbell, installed the exact Neon Trees in the In-N-Out that inspired Glenn while working for a sign company out of Las Vegas.

They released an EP, ''Becoming Different People'', in 2006 during the time of their first tour through California. The EP featured promising songs like "Phones", "Sister Stereo", "Up Against the Glass". They also recorded other unreleased tracks during the "Treehouse Sessions" in 2006.

The band's lineup soon narrowed down to four members with Branden Campbell and Elaine Bradley joining the group on bass and drums, respectively. Shortly thereafter, [[The Killers]]' drummer, [[Ronnie Vannucci Jr.]], went to watch the band play at a small club in Las Vegas as he had been in a Ska band called "Attaboy Skip" with Neon Trees bassist Branden Campbell prior to joining The Killers. Ronnie was impressed, and as a result they were chosen to open for The Killers for a string of dates on their 2008 North American tour. Vannucci later helped the band sign to major label [[Mercury Records]], which was announced in late 2008. Additionally, the group was voted Band of the Year in 2009 by ''[[City Weekly]]'', a popular Salt Lake City publication.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smart|first=Christopher|url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/article-6799-2009-city-weekly-music-awards.html|title=2009 City Weekly Music Awards|publisher=Cityweekly.net|date=2007-06-11|access-date=2011-09-28}}</ref>
