==History==

===Formation===
In August 2007 ''[[NME]]'' magazine reported that [[Arctic Monkeys]] lead singer [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] and lead singer of then newly formed [[The Rascals (English band)|the Rascals]], [[Miles Kane]] would be recording an album with [[Simian Mobile Disco]] member and former [[Simian (band)|Simian]] drummer [[James Ford (musician)|James Ford]] producing and playing drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/30076|title=Arctic Monkeys frontman to record surprise album this month |work=[[NME]] }}</ref> Turner and Kane had become friends when Kane's previous band [[the Little Flames]] played support for Arctic Monkeys on their 2005 UK tour. The Little Flames also supported Arctic Monkeys on their April 2007 UK tour, when Turner and Kane wrote songs together for a collaborative project.<ref>Arctic Monkeys interviewed by Tom Doyle, Mojo, May 2007, p. 96</ref> Their collaboration extended into Arctic Monkeys material, with Kane playing guitar on  "505", the closing track of second Arctic Monkeys album ''[[Favourite Worst Nightmare]]'' and on "[[Fluorescent Adolescent]]" B-sides "The Bakery" and "Plastic Tramp."  Kane also guested on "505" and "Plastic Tramp" at several Arctic Monkeys gigs in 2007, including the summer mini-festivals at [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] and Arctic Monkeys' 2007 & 2013 appearances at Glastonbury.

The initial recording of the songs that would eventually form their debut album took place in France in late August 2007 with additional material added between August and December of that year. In December [[Owen Pallett]] was appointed to arrange the strings, brass and percussion for the album with the 22-piece [[London Metropolitan Orchestra]]. During the recording of the album Turner and Kane hired a documentary film-making team, [[Luke Seomore]] and Joseph Bull, to capture the story of the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a87744/monkeys-star-making-film-about-new-album.html|title=Monkeys star making film about new album|work=Digital Spy}}</ref>

===Stage personas===
When asked about the way the band presents itself on stage Kane commented: "...We’re just sort of having fun in those characters but we’re very much serious, its not like we’re taking the piss, its just like why not be a bit flamboyant if you’ve got it in you, you know? The bands are so boring now days, you know, if someone wants to be a bit extravagant then I don’t see why not. The bands I love were more extravagant and extreme than we are. If everyone wants to stay square then they can stay square."<ref>{{cite web|title= Our Interview with The Last Shadow Puppets |work=Northern Transmissions|first=Matt |last=Poole|date=3 August 2016 |access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref>
