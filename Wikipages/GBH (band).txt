'''GBH'''  (originally known as '''Charged GBH''') are an English [[punk rock]] band which was formed in 1978 by vocalist Colin Abrahall, guitarist Colin "Jock" Blyth, bassist Sean McCarthy (replaced by Ross Lomas after two years)<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcrqAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA54 | title=Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980–1984| isbn=978-1-60486-989-7| last1=Glasper| first1=Ian| date=May 2014}}</ref> and drummer Andy "Wilf" Williams.<ref name="LarkinHM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=142}}</ref>

== Background ==
GBH were early pioneers of English [[street punk]], often nicknamed "[[UK82]]", along with [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Broken Bones (band)|Broken Bones]], [[The Exploited]], and [[The Varukers]]. GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians, but their influence has been especially far-reaching in metal, including the early [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] albums,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deathmetal.org/interview/quorthon-bathory/|title=Interview: Quorthon (Bathory)|website=Deathmetal.org|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref> [[Hellhammer]]/[[Celtic Frost]]<ref name="rollingstone">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tom-g-warrior-celtic-frost-hellhammer-interview-848041/|title=The Triumph of Tom G.

[[Metallica]] frontman [[James Hetfield]] has repeatedly expressed his enthusiasm for GBH and said such bands were the beginning of [[thrash metal|thrash]] to him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/metallicas-james-hetfield-reveals-his-favorite-non-big-four-thrash-bands/|title=METALLICA's JAMES HETFIELD Reveals His Favorite Non-'Big Four' Thrash Bands|date=15 May 2017|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=3 September 2021}}</ref> [[Sascha Konietzko]] of [[KMFDM]] has said he listened to second-wave punk bands before starting his own band, mentioning GBH as an example.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1995-10-20/features/9510200261_1_kmfdm-sascha-konietzko-en-esch|title=German-born Industrial Rock Group Kmfdm Has 'No Pity For The Majority'|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626174735/http://articles.dailypress.com/1995-10-20/features/9510200261_1_kmfdm-sascha-konietzko-en-esch|access-date=25 October 2021|archive-date=26 June 2015}}</ref>

The band's name was originally Charged GBH, then was shortened to GBH. It is widely understood that the name came from then-bassist Sean McCarthy being charged with [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gbh-mn0000202235/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|title=G.B.H. Biography|author=Mark Deming}}</ref> though vocalist Colin Abrahall denied this in 2018, claiming it was just a name like UK Subs; and, when pushed, said the initials stood for "Girls, Booze, and Hash".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLBKARG3qRU|title=4:39-5:20 : Interview with Erin Micklow from June 13, 2018 on YouTube titled, " GBH interview LATEST ALBUM: MOMENTUM, GETTING MARRIED IN VEGAS, HOW COLIN DOES HIS HAIR"|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Though the core line up of Colin, Ross, and Jock has stayed the same throughout their history, the drum stool has been occupied by a number of incumbents following Wilf's departure after the ''[[Midnight Madness and Beyond]]'' album and ''Oh No It's GBH Again'' 12" EP.  1989 saw the arrival of German drummer Kai Reder who played on three albums (''No Need to Panic'', ''A Fridge Too Far'', and ''From Here to Reality''), as well as the ''Wot a Bargain'' 12".<ref name="LarkinHM" />  Kai was replaced by American Joe "Fish" Montanero for one album (''Church of the Truly Warped''); this was the band's last release for the Rough Justice label.  The drum stool was then occupied from around 1994 by former Bomb Disneyland/Bomb Everything drummer Scott Preece, who has remained to this day and played on all releases since.

Throughout their recording history, the band has often included a cover version on many of their albums. "Boston Babies" originally recorded by [[Slaughter & the Dogs]] (on ''City Baby Attacked By Rats''), "I Feel Alright" from [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] and [[The Stooges]] (on ''City Baby's Revenge''), "[[Avenues and Alleyways]]" by [[Tony Christie]] (on ''No Need To Panic''), "Needle In A Haystack" originally by [[The Velvelettes]] (appeared on ''A Fridge Too Far''), "Destroy" by [[The Vibrators]] (on ''From Here To Reality''), "I Need Energy" by [[Zero Boys]] (on ''Church of the Truly Warped'').{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

== History==
[[File:GBH on Warped Tour.jpg|thumb|GBH performing on the Warped Tour]]
GBH embarked on several English and mainland US tours during the early 1980s, including several [[gig (music)|gigs]] at the [[100 Club]]. 1982 saw the release of GBH's first LP, ''[[City Baby Attacked by Rats]]'', which reached No. 17 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], as well as No. 2 in the [[UK Indie Chart]]. The band's singles had also reached the UK Indie Chart, leading to an  appearance on the UK TV programme ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'', where they performed "Give Me Fire" (UK Indie Chart No. 2). Lyrically, the album dealt with criticism of British and European culture, [[violence]], [[morbidity]] (especially in reference to the song "Passenger on the Menu", which describes in graphic detail the experiences of the passengers on the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]]), [[atheism]], [[nihilism]] and humour. Musically, the album was loud and fast, with few songs exceeding three minutes. The success of the first album was repeated with their second LP, ''[[City Babys Revenge]]'', in 1983 and saw more extensive touring in America and Europe and higher profile UK shows, including the Carlisle Punk Festival. With the Carlisle Punk Festival the band co-headlined with fellow UK82 stalwarts [[The Exploited]], and shared the bill with the likes of [[Toy Dolls]], [[Chelsea (band)|Chelsea]], and [[The Destructors (band)|The Destructors]]. In 1984, the band dropped the "Charged" from their name and became just GBH ([[grievous bodily harm]]).<ref name="LarkinHM" /><ref>{{cite web |title=GBH – As Charged .. |url=http://www.njhindl1.demon.co.uk/gbh/charged/index.htm |website=Njhindl1.demon.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508095516/http://www.njhindl1.demon.co.uk/gbh/charged/index.htm |archive-date=8 May 2009}}</ref>

They and many of their UK82 peers such as [[The Exploited]], [[Picture Frame Seduction]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], and [[The Varukers]] have all enjoyed success among punks in the United States. Although many of their contemporaries have evolved towards other styles over the years, GBH have remained fairly faithful to their original UK82 sound in subsequent releases. However, the band have experimented to some degree with a more [[speed metal]]-inflected sound, notably with their 1992 release ''Church of the Truly Warped'',<ref name="LarkinHM" /> although they have since returned to a more [[wikt:purist|purist]] punk sound. They have enjoyed a mixed reception from the music press, with 1993's album, ''From Here To Reality'', being described by the ''[[NME]]'' as "having no redeeming features whatsoever".<ref name="LarkinHM" />

The band is still active and touring and maintain a strong following both in the UK and the rest of Europe, as well as in the United States and Japan. The band released their twelfth studio album, ''Momentum'', on Hellcat Records in 2017.
