==Musical career==
===Early career and musical upbringing===
In the earliest known record of his musical career, David Marley performed as part of a singing group called The Seven Do Bees, made up of him and his classmates, and wherein he was given the stage name "Freddie Dic". The name never stuck, however, and instead, David went on to become known as "Ziggy", a nickname often reported to have been given to him by his father Bob Marley, meaning "little spliff". However, Ziggy stated the following to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine in 1988: "Me name David but me big [[David Bowie|Bowie]] fan. So at the time of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' album, me call meself Ziggy and now everyone do."<ref>{{cite book|title=Bob Marley|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|date=1997|page=[https://archive.org/details/bobmarley00benn/page/76 76] |isbn= 9780312179373| first= Scotty | last= Bennett| url= https://archive.org/details/bobmarley00benn/page/76}}</ref>

During the late 1970s, Ziggy could also be seen alongside his brother [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen]] at some of their father's larger concerts around Jamaica and abroad. In 1978, the duo appeared on stage at the One Love Peace Concert in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tattoopinners.com/bob-marley-ziggy-one-love-peace-concert/31.media.tumblr.com*tumblr_mdokqjnGLN1qmd8t4o1_500.jpg/|title=Bob Marley Ziggy One Love Peace Concert Pictures| website=Tattoospinners.com}}</ref> and the following year at [[Reggae Sunsplash]] II in [[Montego Bay]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Family Business, Jamaica, 1979|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/9421433/Bob-Marley-a-reggae-legend-in-pictures.html?frame=2285515|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>
