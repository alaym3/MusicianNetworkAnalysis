'''David Jon Gilmour''' {{postnom|country=GBR|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|'|g|ɪ|l|m|ɔː|r}} {{respell|GHIL|mor}}; born 6 March 1946) is an English songwriter, guitarist, and singer who was a member of rock band [[Pink Floyd]]. He joined as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1967, shortly before the departure of founder member [[Syd Barrett]].{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=47}} Pink Floyd achieved international success with the [[concept album]]s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979). By the early 1980s, they had become one of the highest-selling and most acclaimed acts in music history; by 2012, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75&nbsp;million in the United States.<ref>For 250 million records sold see: {{cite web|title=Pink Floyd Reunion Tops Fans' Wish List in Music Choice Survey|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aOmothQgn6l4&refer=muse|publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]]|date=26 September 2007|access-date=2 August 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812212513/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aOmothQgn6l4&refer=muse|archive-date=12 August 2013}}; For 74.5 million RIAA certified units sold see: {{cite web|title=Top Selling Artists|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists|access-date=2 August 2012}}</ref> Following the departure of [[Roger Waters]] in 1985, Pink Floyd continued under Gilmour's leadership and released three more studio albums.

Gilmour has produced a variety of artists, such as the [[The Dream Academy|Dream Academy]], and has released four solo studio albums: ''[[David Gilmour (album)|David Gilmour]]'', ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]'', ''[[On an Island]]'', and ''[[Rattle That Lock]]''. He is also credited for bringing singer-songwriter [[Kate Bush]] to public attention. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996, and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005. In 2003, Gilmour was made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE). He was awarded with the Outstanding Contribution title at the 2008 [[Q Awards]].<ref name="qawards">{{cite web|url=http://www2.qawards.co.uk/2008/2008/10/outstanding_contribution_title.html |title=Gilmour dedicates his award to late colleague |publisher=Q Awards |access-date=20 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810050010/http://www2.qawards.co.uk/2008/2008/10/outstanding_contribution_title.html |archive-date=10 August 2011}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him number 14 in their list of the greatest guitarists of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/david-gilmour-20111122|title=David Gilmour – 100 Greatest Guitarists – Rolling Stone|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> He was also voted number 36 in the greatest voices in rock by [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]] listeners in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Plant voted rock's greatest voice|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/robert-plant-voted-rocks-greatest-voice-190343|date=4 January 2009|work=[[MusicRadar]]|access-date=27 September 2015}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
David Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946 in [[Cambridge]], England.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=115}} His father, Douglas Gilmour, was a senior lecturer in [[zoology]] at the University of Cambridge, and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), trained as a teacher and later worked as a film editor for the [[BBC]].<ref name="WH">{{Cite episode |series=BBC Two |title=David Gilmour: Wider Horizons |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06pyrbs |access-date=14 November 2015 |network=[[BBC]] |date=14 November 2015 }}</ref> At the time of Gilmour's birth they lived in [[Trumpington]], [[Cambridgeshire]], but in 1956, after several relocations, the family moved to nearby [[Grantchester Meadows]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=14}}: the house in Trumpington; {{harvnb|Manning|2006|pp=10–11}}.</ref>{{refn|group=n|Gilmour has three siblings: Peter, Mark and Catharine.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=14}}}}

Gilmour's parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]]'s "[[Rock Around the Clock]]".{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp=10–11}} His enthusiasm was stirred the following year by [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", and later "[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]]" by [[the Everly Brothers]] piqued his interest in the guitar. He borrowed a guitar from a neighbour, but never gave it back. Soon afterward, Gilmour started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by [[Pete Seeger]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=18–19}} At age 11, Gilmour began attending [[the Perse School|Perse School]] on [[Hills Road, Cambridge]], which he did not enjoy.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}} There he met future [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[Syd Barrett]] and bassist [[Roger Waters]], who attended [[Cambridgeshire High School for Boys]], also situated on Hills Road.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=15–17}}

In 1962, Gilmour began studying A-Level modern languages at the [[Anglia Ruskin University|Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology]].{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}} Despite not finishing the course, he eventually learnt to speak fluent French.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}} Barrett was also a student at the college, and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with Gilmour.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}} In late 1962, Gilmour joined the [[blues rock]] band [[Jokers Wild (band)|Jokers Wild]]. The band recorded a one-sided album and a single at Regent Sound Studio, in [[Denmark Street]], west London, but only 50 copies of each were made.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=11}}

In August 1965, Gilmour [[Street performance|busked]] around Spain and France with Barrett and some other friends, performing songs by [[the Beatles]]. They were arrested on one occasion and destitute, which resulted in Gilmour requiring treatment in a hospital for [[malnutrition]].<ref>{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=18}}: arrested for busking; {{cite web|url=http://www.megapinkfloyd.com/band_members_david_gilmour.asp |title=PINK FLOYD&nbsp;– David Gilmour Photos, Biography, Apparel |publisher=Megapinkfloyd.com |access-date=9 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714065947/http://www.megapinkfloyd.com/band_members_david_gilmour.asp |archive-date=14 July 2011}}: malnutrition.</ref> He and Barrett later trekked to Paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the [[Louvre]].{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=18}} During that time Gilmour worked in various places, most notably as the driver and assistant for fashion designer [[Ossie Clark]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Pattie|last= Boyd|title= Wonderful Tonight|date= 2007|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CNhh0TMLmmwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=wonderful+tonight&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z3VTVb2eN4LUgwTQgoGoCA&ved=0CCgQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&q=gilmour&f=false 53]}}</ref>

Gilmour travelled to France in mid-1967 with [[Rick Wills]] and [[Willie Wilson (drummer)|Willie Wilson]], formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the name Flowers, then Bullitt, but were not commercially successful. After hearing their covers of chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=44}} While in France, Gilmour contributed lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Two Weeks in September]]'', starring [[Brigitte Bardot]].<ref name="WH" /> In May, Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new equipment. During his stay, he watched Pink Floyd record "[[See Emily Play]]" and was shocked to find that Barrett, who was beginning to suffer mental health problems, did not seem to recognise him.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=38}} When Bullitt returned to England later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry onto the landing.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=44}}

==Pink Floyd==
{{Main|Pink Floyd}}[[File:David Gilmour and stratocaster.jpg|thumb|Gilmour performing with [[Pink Floyd]] in the mid-1970s]]In December 1967, Pink Floyd drummer [[Nick Mason]] invited Gilmour to join the band to cover for the increasingly erratic Barrett. Gilmour accepted; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non-performing songwriter.<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=109–111}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=47}}: (secondary source).</ref> One of the band's business partners, [[Peter Jenner]], said: "The idea was that Dave would&nbsp;... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved."{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=107}} By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult and he agreed to leave the band.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=112}}

Gilmour took up lead vocal roles with keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]]. After the successes of ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973) and ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), Roger Waters took greater control of the band, writing and singing lead on most of ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979). Wright was fired during the ''Wall'' sessions; the relationship between Gilmour and Waters deteriorated during the making of the [[Pink Floyd – The Wall|''Wall'' film]] and the album ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]''. The final Pink Floyd performance of ''The Wall'' took place on 17 June 1981, at Earl's Court, London,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/pink-floyd-final-concert-roger-waters/|title=The Day Pink Floyd Played Their Final Concert With Roger Waters|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref> which became Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters for almost 25 years.{{sfn|Povey|Russell|1997|p=185}}

The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of ''The Wall'' album and film, compounded by ''The Final Cut''{{'}}s virtually being a Waters solo album, led Gilmour to produce his second solo album, ''About Face'', in 1984.<ref name="Mabbett-1">{{cite book| edition = Updated| publisher=Omnibus| isbn = 0-7119-4109-2| last = Miles| first = Barry|author2=Andy Mabbett| title = Pink Floyd the visual documentary| location = London| year = 1994}}</ref> He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of [[John Lennon]]<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> to his relationship with Waters. Gilmour toured Europe and the US along with support act the [[Television Personalities]], who were dropped from the line-up after Dan Treacy revealed [[Syd Barrett]]'s address on stage.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p=123}} Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=304}} When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists, and also produced [[the Dream Academy]], who had a US top ten hit with "[[Life in a Northern Town]]" in 1986.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=312}}

=== 1985: Gilmour becomes leader ===

In 1985, Waters declared that Pink Floyd were "a spent force creatively" and left the band.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=240–241, 246}} Gilmour and Mason responded with a press release stating that they intended to continue without him.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=240}} Gilmour assumed control of the group and produced the Pink Floyd album ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' in 1987, with contributions from Mason and Richard Wright.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> He felt Pink Floyd albums had become too driven by lyrics under Waters' leadership, and attempted to "restore the balance" of music and lyrics on ''Momentary Lapse.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=274}}</ref>'' It was followed by ''[[The Division Bell]]'' in 1994.<ref name="Mabbett-12">{{cite book|title=Pink Floyd the visual documentary|last=Miles|first=Barry|author2=Andy Mabbett|publisher=Omnibus|year=1994|isbn=0-7119-4109-2|edition=Updated|location=London}}</ref>

In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat ''[[Astoria (recording studio)|Astoria]]'', moored it on the [[River Thames]] near Hampton Court and transformed it into a recording studio.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=318}} The majority of the two Pink Floyd albums released about this time, as well as Gilmour's 2006 solo album ''On an Island'', were recorded there.<ref name="Mabbett-2">{{harvnb|Mabbett|2010|p={{page needed|date=May 2021}}}}</ref>
[[File:David Gilmour - 1984, Abou Face tour.jpg|thumb|upright|Gilmour in 1984]]

On 2 July 2005, Waters temporarily reunited with Gilmour to perform at [[Live 8]]. The performance caused a sales increase of Pink Floyd's album ''[[Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd]]''.<ref name=giveback>{{cite web|title=Pink Floyd gives back|url=http://www.soulshine.ca/news/newsarticle.php?nid=2241|access-date=2 December 2007}}</ref> Gilmour donated his profits to charities that reflect the goals of Live 8, saying: "Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the [[G8]] leaders, I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives."<ref name=giveback /> He called upon all Live 8 artists to donate their extra revenue to Live 8 fundraising. After the concert, Pink Floyd turned down an offer to tour the US for £150&nbsp;million.<ref name=askmen>{{cite web|title=Pink Floyd offered millions to tour|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/pink/pink-floyd-offered-millions-to-tour.html|access-date=2 December 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219091320/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/pink/pink-floyd-offered-millions-to-tour.html|archive-date=19 December 2008}}</ref>

In 2006, Gilmour said that Pink Floyd would likely never tour or write material again. He said: "I think enough is enough. I am 60 years old. I don't have the will to work as much any more. Pink Floyd was an important part in my life, I have had a wonderful time, but it's over. For me it's much less complicated to work alone."<ref name=repubblica>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/b/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/gilmo/gilmo/gilmo.html |title=Il requiem di David Gilmour "I Pink Floyd?

Since their Live 8 appearance in 2005, Gilmour has repeatedly said that there will be no Pink Floyd reunion. With the death of Wright in September 2008, another reunion of the core group members became impossible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Booth|first=Robert|title=Pink Floyd's Richard Wright dies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/16/pinkfloyd.popandrock |date= 16 September 2008 |access-date=16 October 2013|work=The Guardian}}</ref> <span class="">On 7 November 2014, Pink Floyd released ''[[The Endless River]].''</span><ref name="amazon-gb">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00NPZI1ZS|title=The Endless River: Amazon.co.uk: Music|website=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]]|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref> Gilmour stated that it would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: "I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ...

== Roy Harper ==

Gilmour has a long-standing association with [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]], who was for a time managed by Pink Floyd's former managers [[Blackhill Enterprises]], recorded for the same label, [[Harvest Records]], and who appeared on the same bill as Pink Floyd at 1968's [[Midsummer High Weekend]] free concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> Harper sang "[[Have a Cigar]]" on Pink Floyd's 1975 ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' album, and sang the song with them at that year's [[Knebworth Festival]].<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> Gilmour played on Harper's albums ''[[HQ (album)|HQ]]'' (1975), ''[[The Unknown Soldier (album)|The Unknown Soldier]]'' (1980) and ''[[Once (Roy Harper album)|Once]]'' (1990).<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> Five of the ten songs on the first of these were co-compositions, one of which, "Short and Sweet", was first recorded for Gilmour's first solo album.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> Another, "You", also features Kate Bush, as does the title track on ''Once''.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> In April 1984, Harper made surprise guest appearance at Gilmour's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] gig to sing "Short and Sweet".<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> This was included in Gilmour's ''Live 1984'' concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmour's ''About Face'' album.<ref name="Mabbett-1" />

While writing for ''About Face'', Gilmour had a tune, and asked [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] to supply lyrics. This Townshend did, but Gilmour rejected them (Townshend would use both tune and lyrics, as "White City Fighting", on his 1985 ''[[White City: A Novel]]'' album, which features Gilmour on that track, and on ''[[Give Blood (song)|Give Blood]]''). Gilmour then asked Harper for lyrics, but rejected those also, deciding not to use the tune on the album after all. Eventually Harper used his version, "Hope", which has a markedly slower tempo, on his 1985 album with [[Jimmy Page]], called ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]''.<ref name="Mabbett-1" />

== Kate Bush ==
{{Main|Kate Bush}}
In the 1970s, Gilmour received a copy of songwriter [[Kate Bush|Kate Bush's]] demo tape from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of both families.

Gilmour is credited as executive producer on two tracks on Bush's debut album ''[[The Kick Inside]]'', including her second single "[[The Man with the Child in His Eyes]]".<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> He performed backing vocals on "Pull Out the Pin" on her fourth album ''[[The Dreaming (album)|The Dreaming]]'',<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> and played guitar on "[[Love and Anger (song)|Love and Anger]]" and "Rocket's Tail" on her sixth, ''[[The Sensual World]]''.<ref name="Mabbett-1" />

In March 1987, Bush, known for rarely performing live, sang "[[Running Up That Hill]]" at [[The Secret Policeman's Balls|The Secret Policeman's Third Ball]] with Gilmour on guitar.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> A three DVD set of [[The Secret Policeman's Balls]] benefit concerts, including their performance, was released in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homemediamagazine.com/tv-dvd/unveiling-britains-secret-14017 |title=Unveiling Britain's 'Secret' |publisher=[[Home Media Magazine]] |date=5 December 2008 |author=John Latchem |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075344/http://homemediamagazine.com/tv-dvd/unveiling-britains-secret-14017 |archive-date=9 December 2008  }}</ref> In 2002, she performed "Comfortably Numb", singing the part of the doctor, at Gilmour's concert at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/flashback-david-gilmour-and-kate-bush-sing-comfortably-numb-53422/|title=Flashback: David Gilmour & Kate Bush Duet|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=21 March 2013|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=16 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Solo work==
[[File:David gilmour brussels 1984.jpg|thumb|Gilmour performing live in [[Brussels]], Belgium on his ''About Face'' tour, 1984]]By the late 1970s, Gilmour had begun to think that his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd. In 1978 he channelled his ideas into his first solo album, ''[[David Gilmour (album)|David Gilmour]]'', which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting. Music written during the finishing stages of the album, but too late to be used, was incorporated into a song by Waters, which became "[[Comfortably Numb]]", included on ''The Wall''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp=221–222}}

Gilmour has recorded four solo studio albums, all four of which have charted in the US Top 40: his first peaked at No. 29 in 1978, ''About Face'' peaked at No. 32 in 1984, ''On an Island'' peaked at No. 6 in 2006, and ''Rattle That Lock'' peaked at No. 5 in 2015. His live albums ''Live in Gdansk'' (2008) and ''Live at Pompeii'' (2017) peaked at number 26 and number 45, respectively.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/david-gilmour/chart-history/tlp/ |title=David Gilmour Chart History |magazine=Billboard |access-date=3 January 2018}}</ref>

In 1985, Gilmour played on [[Bryan Ferry]]'s sixth album ''[[Boys and Girls (album)|Boys and Girls]]'', as well as the song "Is Your Love Strong Enough" for the US release of the [[Ridley Scott]]–[[Tom Cruise]] film ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]''. A music video for the latter was created, incorporating Ferry and Gilmour into footage from the film<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> (released as a bonus on the 2002 "Ultimate Edition" DVD release). Later that year, Gilmour played with Ferry at the [[Live Aid#London Wembley Stadium|Live Aid]] concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London;<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> his first collaboration with Ferry's keyboardist [[Jon Carin]], later to tour with Pink Floyd.

It has the serial number 0001; however, [[prototype]]s had been constructed before this one.

Gilmour used a pair of Jedson [[steel guitar]]s and a Fender 1000 pedal steel frequently in the early 1970s. Originally purchased from a pawn shop while Gilmour was in [[Seattle]] in 1970, the Jedson was used during recording of "[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]" from ''Meddle'' and "[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe]]" and "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]" from ''Dark Side of the Moon''.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=424}} Gilmour also owns a [[Fender Deluxe Reverb|Fender Deluxe]] [[lap steel guitar|lap steel]], which he used during ''The Division Bell'' tour in 1994.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|p=434}} Gilmour also owns a Champ lap steel model.
