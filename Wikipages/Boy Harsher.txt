'''Boy Harsher''' is an American [[electronic music]] group, formed in 2013 in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Currently based in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], the band consists of vocalist Jae Matthews and producer Augustus Muller. Muller temporarily resided in Matthews' attic<ref>{{cite web |last1=Novello |first1=Lena |title=Boy Harsher - Darkness From Within |url=https://www.metalmagazine.eu/en/post/interview/boy-harsher-darkness-from-within |website=METAL}}</ref> in the beginning of their relationship. The band has amassed a [[cult following]] since their formation,<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> and their song "Pain" has become an [[underground music|underground]] [[Hit song|hit]].<ref name="dazed-heartbreak"/><ref name="skinny-careful"/> Matthews and Muller own and run the label Nude Club, which is exclusively devoted to Boy Harsher and related artists.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

==History==
Knowing each other from [[film school]] in Savannah,<ref name="vice-interview"/> Muller and Matthews started the project Teen Dreamz in 2013, which acted as a precursor to Boy Harsher. The project consisted of Matthews performing her [[spoken word]] pieces and Muller providing a musical backing. Throughout the year, Teen Dreamz's sound became more danceable, as Matthews's vocals developed into a more expressive singing style. The band renamed their project as Boy Harsher in 2014.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

Boy Harsher released its [[Home recording|home-recorded]] debut EP, ''Lesser Man'' in the same year. Following their relocation to Massachusetts, the band recorded and released its debut album, ''Yr Body Is Nothing'' in 2016 on DKA Records. After the release of 2017's ''Country Girl'' EP, the band formed their Nude Club imprint in 2018, re-issuing their catalog. One of the first releases on Nude Club, "Pain II", is a reissue of their 2014 single with a remix by [[The Soft Moon]].<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> Their sophomore studio album, 2019's ''[[Careful (Boy Harsher album)|Careful]]'',<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> was backed by an extended reissue of ''Country Girl'' as ''Country Girl Uncut''.<ref name="fact-uncut"/> In that year, a [[remix album]] of ''Careful'', titled ''Careful Remixes, etc.'' was also released; it featured remixes from [[techno]] producers such as [[Marcel Dettmann]] and [[Silent Servant]].<ref name="dazed-heartbreak"/>

On April 10, 2020, Muller released his debut [[soundtrack album]], ''Machine Learning Experiments (Original Soundtrack)'', which featured original [[film score|score]]s composed for two short adult films, ''Orgone Theory'' and ''Hydra''. The album was issued on Nude Club.<ref name="ra-machine-learning"/> In 2021, the band remixed the [[Perfume Genius]] song "Your Body Changes Everything." The remix was featured in the album, ''[[Set My Heart on Fire Immediately#Remix album|Immediately Remixes]]''.<ref name="perfume-remix"/>

==Musical style, imagery and influences==
[[File:DAF 0016 small.jpg|thumb|250px|German [[electropunk|synthpunk]] band [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]] <small>''(pictured in 1981)''</small> was reportedly an early influence.<ref name="vice-interview"/>]]
Boy Harsher is often labeled as a [[dark wave]] group,<ref name="dazed-heartbreak"/><ref name="npr"/> with influences ranging from early forms of [[industrial music|industrial]] to [[electronic body music]].<ref name="popmatters"/> Paul Simpson of [[AllMusic]] referred to the band's music as "dark, danceable [[electro pop]]" that references [[synth pop]] and EBM. He has characterized Boy Harsher's music by its minimal beats and [[synthesizer|synth]] textures, as well as by Matthews's dynamic vocals that depict "desire, fantasy, and loneliness."<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> On his review for ''Careful'', Kevin Lozano of [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] listed the band as one of the acts that spearhead the [[minimal synth]] scene along with [[Essaie pas]], noting the "brisk [[drum machine]] [[Loop (music)|loops]], [[Electronic oscillator|oscillating]] synths, and Matthews’ haunting incantations" that permeate the album's sound.<ref name="p4k-careful"/> Lozano has previously described the band as "making [[cold wave (music)|coldwave]] that could turn any space in that quiet town into a seedy nightclub."<ref name="p4k-motion"/> Michael Lawson of ''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]'' thought that the band "straddled the middle ground between melancholic cold wave and regimented synth workouts."<ref name="skinny-careful"/>

Boy Harsher draws heavily from [[Cinematography|cinema]], theatrics and graphic design to tailor the band's visual imagery;<ref name="dazed-heartbreak"/><ref name="popmatters"/><ref name="volt"/> Matthews and Muller both have a background in [[filmmaking]].<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> They have likened the band to the movies ''[[Body Heat]]'' and ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'',<ref name="metalmagazine"/> latter of which was directed by [[David Lynch]], a professed influence on the band.<ref name="volt"/> Matthews has expressed appreciation for various female vocalists, including [[Nico]], Circuit des Yeux, Alison Lewis of [[Linea Aspera (band)|Linea Aspera]], [[Chelsea Wolfe]] and [[Zola Jesus]], whereas Muller named [[Sleep Chamber]], [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]] and [[Yello]] as early musical influences on Boy Harsher.<ref name="vice-interview"/> Gearwise, Muller mostly employs synthesizers and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], stating that he "tries and borrows as much <nowiki>[instruments]</nowiki> as he can for recording."<ref name="vice-interview"/> On the band's [[Minimal music|minimal]] instrumentation, he said: "I’m obsessed with how successful the minimalism is with [[1980s in music|80s music]]. It’s really a masterclass of what can be done with a drum machine and a couple of synths."<ref name="volt"/> A "half-functioning" [[Roland Juno-106]] was used extensively on ''Lesser Man'' EP; their live set features synth lines sampled into an [[Akai MPC]], as well as [[backing track]]s.<ref name="vice-interview"/>
