'''''Key & Peele''''' (abbreviated to '''''K&P''''') is an American [[sketch comedy]] television series created by [[Keegan-Michael Key]] and [[Jordan Peele]] that aired on [[Comedy Central]]. Both Key and Peele previously worked on ''[[Mad TV]].''<ref>{{cite web |last=Owen |first=Rob |url=http://communityvoices.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in-journal/31544-press-tour-key-a-peele-is-sketch-comedy-done-right |title=PRESS TOUR: 'Key & Peele' is sketch comedy done right |publisher=Communityvoices.sites.post-gazette.com |date=January 14, 2012 |access-date=February 24, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124015628/http://communityvoices.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in-journal/31544-press-tour-key-a-peele-is-sketch-comedy-done-right |archive-date=January 24, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Each episode of the show consists mainly of several pre-taped skits starring the two actors. The sketches cover a variety of societal topics, often with a focus on American [[popular culture]], [[ethnic stereotype]]s, [[social awkwardness]] and [[race relations]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1fYaBwAAQBAJ&q=key+%26+peele&pg=PA246|author1=Maus, Derek C.|author2=Donahue, James J.|title=Post-Soul Satire: Black Identity After Civil Rights|year=2014|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|isbn=978-1-61-703997-3|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071359/https://books.google.hr/books?id=1fYaBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA246&lpg=PA246#v=snippet&q=key%20%26%20peele|archive-date=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''Key & Peele'' premiered on January 31, 2012<ref>{{cite web|author=Gorman, Bill|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/04/keegan-michael-key-and-jordan-peele-come-to-comedy-central-with-new-series-key-peele/115317/|title=Keegan-Michael Key And Jordan Peele Come To Comedy Central With New Series 'Key & Peele'|publisher=[[TV By the Numbers]]|date=January 4, 2012|access-date=February 24, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114171353/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/04/keegan-michael-key-and-jordan-peele-come-to-comedy-central-with-new-series-key-peele/115317/|archive-date=January 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and ended on September 9, 2015, with a total of 53 episodes, over the course of five seasons. A [[Television special|special]] titled "Key & Peele's Super Bowl Special" aired on January 30, 2015.

''Key & Peele'' won a [[Peabody Award]] and two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] and has been nominated for various other awards, including [[Writers Guild of America Award|Writers Guild Award]], [[NAACP Image Award]] and 16 additional Primetime Emmy Awards in various categories.

Comedy Central also maintains an official YouTube channel for the series, which currently has over 3.18 million subscribers and 1.4 billion views, as of June 2021.

==Format==
In the first three seasons, an episode would consist of a [[cold opening]], with a short [[sketch comedy|sketch]]. After the [[Introduction (music)|intro]] plays, the two hosts would introduce themselves to a studio audience and explain a possible situation, with the following sketch having a similar situation. The show then follows this pattern, with a number of sketches, each varying in time. Not all the segments are introduced by a studio segment.

In the last two seasons, the show eschewed a studio audience in favor of a pre-shot narrative, featuring the duo discussing a concept during a car ride, as the introduction to their sketches.

==Production==
The series was first announced in June 2011 by [[Comedy Central]].<ref name=autogenerated4 /> In anticipation of the show, Key and Peele launched a [[web series]] in support of the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/key-peele-launch-obama-anger-translator |title=Key & Peele Launch Obama Anger Translator |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=January 12, 2012 |access-date=February 24, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118185544/http://www.movieweb.com/news/key-peele-launch-obama-anger-translator |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The series premiered in January 2012 on Comedy Central in the U.S. and on [[The Comedy Network]] in Canada.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/key-and-peele/index.jhtml|title=Key & Peele|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|access-date=February 24, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226081102/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/key-and-peele/index.jhtml|archive-date=February 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecomedynetwork.ca/Shows/KeyPeele|title=The Comedy Network Shows – Watch Full Episodes &#124;

[[File:Barack Obama and Keegan-Michael Key at White House Correspondents' Association Dinner 2015.jpg|thumb|Key performing as Luther, President Obama's "anger translator", at the 2015 White House Correspondents Dinner.]]
* {{anchor|Barack Obama}}'''[[Barack Obama]] and {{visible anchor|Luther}}''' – The 44th [[President of the United States]], played by Peele, often has difficulty expressing his true feelings, and President Obama's "anger translator" Luther, played by Key, works to interpret the President's low-key statements into raging tirades. One sketch reveals that Obama's wife and daughters each have their own anger translators as well, whom they request help from to speak with each other. Key appeared briefly in-character as Luther at the Annual White House Correspondents Dinner as an anger translator for the real Barack Obama in early 2015. On January 5, 2017, Key debuted an "Obama-Luther" sketch on ''[[The Daily Show]] with Trevor Noah''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-daily-show-key-peele-obama-anger-20170106-htmlstory.html|title=Key & Peele bring back Obama's anger translator, roast Trump on 'The Daily Show'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2017-01-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124225906/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-daily-show-key-peele-obama-anger-20170106-htmlstory.html|archive-date=January 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
* '''Wendell Sanders''' – Played by Peele, Wendell is a nerdy, extremely overweight, friendless man who loves sci-fi and fantasy. He often comes up with elaborate stories to convince others (especially over the phone) that he is not a stereotypical nerd, and that he is calling on the behalf of people other than himself. This includes a very attractive woman named "Claire", with whom he claims to have a relationship, and the 15-year-old son named "Stimpy" they have. (He was put on the spot when questioned about his nonexistent son, and he was close to a plush doll of the character from ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''.) Though his stories are obvious lies, they are elaborate enough that he usually manages to convince the person on the other end of the phone line (usually a gullible man played by Key) that the people in his stories exist. When asked to speak with his fabricated friends and family, Wendell makes up an abrupt event on the spot (usually involving the fabricated person in question being killed) to prevent the person he is talking to from piecing together that his stories are lies, and to end the conversation.
* '''Mr. Garvey''' – Played by Key, Mr. Garvey is an angry and intimidating substitute teacher and 20-year veteran of urban education. He distrusts (he refuses to allow students to leave for club photos, as he believes that it is a made-up excuse to leave class, even after a schoolwide announcement over the intercom, which he also believes to be fake) and has trouble pronouncing the common names of his mild-mannered and generally white suburban students, though he vehemently believes his pronunciations are correct, such as pronouncing the name Jacqueline as "Jay-kwellin" or Blake as "Balakay" or Denise as "Dee-Nice" and his most known Aaron as "A. A. Ron". Any corrections from the students are seen as highly disrespectful lies meant to make him look foolish. Mr. Garvey forces his students to acknowledge themselves by his incorrect pronunciations, often at the very real threat of being sent to Principal O'Shaughnessy (pronounced "O-Shag-[[Hennessy]]" by Garvey) for disrespect. The only student Mr. Garvey seems to trust is an African American boy at the back of the class named Timothy (accent on the "o") (played by Peele), who is implied to be from the inner city and claims to have a daughter. In March 2015, it was announced that Key will reprise the role of Mr. Garvey in a feature-length film ''Substitute Teacher'' with Jordan portraying a rival teacher.<ref name="GarveyFilm"/>
* '''{{visible anchor|Meegan}}''' – Played by Peele, Meegan is a young woman angry at her boyfriend, André, who always pursues her from a club, but she won't let him near enough to make up. The distance they cover in their pursuit becomes extreme. Meegan is shown to be extremely selfish and unintelligent, and does not seem to acknowledge social norms. She herself rarely ever receives any sort of comeuppance for the flagrant disrespect she shows to others. When not with André, Meegan is often seen with another woman who acts exactly like her (played by Key), and they often gossip between one other about being shocked by people doing normal acts, and calling them "crazy". They also take many [[selfie]]s of themselves, but delete the majority of them because they don't like how they look in them, including a picture that had already just been classified as evidence in a crime that they witnessed.
*'''{{visible anchor|André}}''' – Played by Key, André is Meegan's equally loud, but far more intelligent and polite boyfriend who tends to take the fall for the conflicts she starts with others.
* '''DeVon''' – Played by Key, DeVon is the shady and weird landlord who's often suspicious of what goes on in his tenants' apartments.
* '''Rafi Benitez''' – Played by Peele, Rafi is a baseball player who makes all his teammates uncomfortable in the locker room, because of his "slap-ass" addiction.
* '''Brock Favors''' – Played by Key, Brock Favors is a news reporter who's always ill-prepared for his assignments such as helicopter traffic reports and reporting on police dog training. He always responds to unexpected and sudden events with loud, excited swearing.
* '''Col. Hans Muller''' – A [[Nazi]] [[colonel]] who is ignorant to the truth. He uses "very scientific" methods to find black people (offering them [[beets]], measuring their heads, jingling cat toys). He is played by recurring guest star [[Ty Burrell]].
* '''Levi and Cedric''' – Two inner-city friends who often get in rifts because of Levi (Peele) constantly joining new trends such as going [[steam-punk]] or getting his own ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''. Most sketches end with Cedric (Key) getting fed up with Levi and calling off their friendship.
* '''Carlito''' – Played by Peele, Carlito is a Mexican gangster who believes that very normal or minor acts (including sitting in chairs) are "for pussies", and believes himself to be above doing such acts. He believes himself to be "the crazy one" of the gang, which he will go to embarrassing lengths to prove.
* '''The Valets''' – Two valets from the Berkshire Restaurant (who always use unnecessary plurals in names of people, places, or things) who love discussing their favorite movie stars and characters – despite mangling their names and films – such as "[[Liam Neeson]]s" from ''[[Taken (film)|Tooken]]'', "[[Peter Dinklage|Peter Dinkels]]" (who plays "[[Tyrion Lannister|Taiwan Lannister]]"), "[[Bruce Willis|Bruce Willies]]," "[[Michelle Pfeiffer|Michelle Pa-feiffer]]s," "[[Timothy Olyphant|Timothy Elephants]]" and "[[Mel Gibson|Racist-Ass Melly Gibsons]]". They end the sketch by saying that something related to the star in question is "MY SHIT!", then disappearing, by ways such as flying into the air like a rocket or exploding. In February 2014, a sponsored sketch with the valets titled "What About ''Non-Stop''?" – in which "Liam Neesons" himself shows up to collect his car – was used to promote the film ''[[Non-Stop (film)|Non-Stop]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Castillo|first1=Michelle|title=Key & Peele Look Back on What Made Their 'Liam Neesons' Spot a Promoted Clip Worth Watching|url=http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/key-peele-still-pumped-about-liam-neesons-ad-159161/|access-date=May 4, 2017|work=[[Adweek]]|date=July 28, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628232625/http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/key-peele-still-pumped-about-liam-neesons-ad-159161/|archive-date=June 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The 7 Most Essential Key & Peele Sketches|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/key-peele-best-sketches/|access-date=May 4, 2017|work=TVGuide.com|date=February 10, 2015|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316043337/http://www.tvguide.com/news/key-peele-best-sketches/|archive-date=March 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Key and Peele also appeared in a parody of "The Valets" in one of the teaser trailers for ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://news.avclub.com/key-and-peele-reprise-one-of-their-best-bits-in-this-ne-1830410355 | title = Key and Peele reprise one of their best bits in this new Toy Story 4 clip | first= Dan | last = Neilan | date = November 13, 2018 | access-date = November 13, 2018 | work = [[The A.V.

* '''Karim and Jahar''' – Two lecherous Middle Eastern men on the lookout for beautiful women. Though they claim to dislike gay people, they often act in a flamboyantly feminine manner.
* '''LaShawn and Samuel''' – A gay couple with very differing personalities and views on marriage. Samuel (Key) is very intelligent and well-mannered and exercises restraint when making important decisions. LaShawn (Peele) is very loud and extremely flamboyant and is constantly thinking up often nonsensical and impossible ideas for their future.
* '''East/West Bowl Football Players''' – A series of [[college football]] players (most of them played by Key and Peele) whose names become increasingly ridiculous as the list progresses, such as "Donkey Teeth", "Hingle McCringleberry", "Huka'lakanaka Hakanakaheekalucka'hukahakafaka" and "Squeeeeeeeps". The West Team also features players from non-university organizations (such as "Nevada State &ndash; Penitentiary" and "Army &ndash; Navy Surplus Store"); the last player for the West Team is always a white player not played by Key nor Peele. In the third edition of this sketch, the fictional athletes were joined by actual players with unusual names (such as [[Ha Ha Clinton-Dix]] and [[Ishmaa'ily Kitchen]]); the last player for the West team was played by [[Aaron Rodgers|"A.A. Ron Rodgers"]], in reference to the Mr. Garvey sketches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/laces-out/super-bowl-2015-patriots-seahawks-key-and-peele-east-west-bowl-012815 |work=[[FOX Sports]] |date=January 28, 2015 |access-date=July 25, 2015 |title='Key and Peele' gives us 'East/West Bowl' sketch with NFL players |last=Saraf |first=Sid |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525035652/http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/laces-out/super-bowl-2015-patriots-seahawks-key-and-peele-east-west-bowl-012815 |archive-date=May 25, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
* '''Metta World News''' – NBA player [[Metta World Peace]] delivers the "news," which usually takes the form of presenting bizarre hypothetical scenarios to the audience and his imagined approach to them. This is the only recurring sketch that stars neither Key nor Peele.
* '''The Black Republicans''' – A group of outside-of-the-box thinking black men (one member is played by recurring guest star [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]]) who try to convert other black voters to join the Republican party. They are all shown to be similarly dressed in outdated fashion styles such as leather jackets, braided belts, [[mom jeans|dad jeans]], and wire-rimmed glasses. Their catchphrase is "I am pissed, ROYALLY pissed!"
*'''Joseph''' – Played by Key, Joseph is a crude con man who fabricates facetious hardships so he can deceive others into helping him out.
*'''Dr. Rajeev Gupta''' – Played by Key, Dr. Gupta is an Indian-American doctor who works at a large hospital.
*'''The Continental''' – Played by Peele, a strange, eccentric man who opulently and hedonistically indulges in his hotel's free continental breakfast as well as flying first-class.
*'''Rhinos''' - The name of sports teams of varying sport, often bearing unusually odd-acting team members. Rafi is a member of the [[baseball]] team Rhinos.
*'''Power Falcons''' - Often portrayed as a rival to the Rhinos. The Power Falcons is also the name of a fictional team of superheroes in an implied reference to [[Power Rangers]], two members of which are played by Key and Peele.
