'''''Phineas and Ferb''''' is an American [[animated series|animated]] [[Musical film|musical]]-[[comedy]] [[television series]] created by [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] for [[Disney Channel]] and [[Disney XD]]. Produced by [[Disney Television Animation]], the series was originally broadcast as a [[Rollercoaster (Phineas and Ferb)|one-episode preview]] on August 17, 2007, and [[Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror|again previewed]] on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008, on [[Disney Channel]], running until June 12, 2015.

The program follows [[Phineas Flynn]] and his stepbrother [[Ferb Fletcher]],<ref name="AM1">{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/1 |title=From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", PFage 1. |author=Strike, Joe |work=Animation World Magazine |access-date=2009-08-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722044630/http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/1 |archive-date=2010-07-22 }}</ref> who are between eight and ten years old,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=NewsBank&t=pubname%3AWSJO-EEDT%21Winston-Salem%2BJournal%2B%2528NC%2529/year%3A2021%212021/mody%3A0327%21March%2B27&action=browse&format=image&docref=image%2Fv2%3A16D226D1E8D3CC28%40NewsBank-1817BA22855B7964%402459301-1817BA32CE08C050%4031&origin=image%2Fv2%3A16D226D1E8D3CC28%40NewsBank-1817BA22855B7964%402459301-1817BA31C422030A%400|title=Hollywood Q & A|last=Thomlison|first=Adam|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|via=TV Media|page=TV Week 8|date=2021-03-27}}</ref> on [[summer vacation]]. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project. These are usually unrealistic given the protagonists' ages (and are sometimes downright physically impossible), which annoys their controlling older sister [[Candace Flynn|Candace]], who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and Phineas' mother, [[Linda Flynn-Fletcher]], and less frequently to Ferb's father, [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Lawrence Fletcher|Lawrence Fletcher]]. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur in every episode, and the [[b-plot|subplot]] almost always features Phineas and Ferb's pet [[platypus]] [[Perry the Platypus]] working as a spy named "Agent P" for OWCA (the Organization Without a Cool Acronym) to defeat the latest scheme of [[Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz]], a [[mad scientist]] driven largely by a need to assert his evilness (although he is not especially evil and has a good heart in some situations). The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother, which usually leaves Candace very frustrated.

Povenmire and Marsh had previously worked together on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox's]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. The creators also voice two of the main B-plot characters, Dr. Doofenshmirtz and Major Monogram. ''Phineas and Ferb'' was conceived after Povenmire sketched a triangular boy&nbsp;– the prototype for Phineas&nbsp;– in a restaurant. Povenmire and Marsh developed the series concept together and pitched it to networks for 16 years before securing a run on Disney Channel.<ref name="AM1" />

==Premise==
[[File:Downtown Mobile 2008 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.14|Povenmire drew inspiration for the show from his boyhood in [[Mobile, Alabama]].<ref name="OSP"/>]]
The show follows the adventures of stepbrothers [[Phineas Flynn]] and [[Ferb Fletcher]], who live in the fictional city of Danville in an unspecified [[tri-state area]], as they seek ways to occupy their time during their [[summer vacation]]. Often these adventures involve elaborate, life-sized and ostensibly dangerous construction projects. Phineas' older sister [[Candace Flynn]] has two obsessions: exposing Phineas and Ferb's schemes and ideas, and winning the attention of a boy named Jeremy.<ref name="AM2">{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/swampy-dan-emerges-phineas-and-ferb|title=From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", Page 2.|author=Strike, Joe.|date=2008-02-01|work=Animation World Magazine|access-date=2009-08-26}}</ref> Meanwhile, the boys' pet [[platypus]] [[Perry the Platypus|Perry]], acts as a secret agent for an all-animal government organization<ref name="TCC">{{cite episode|title=Traffic Cam Caper|series=Phineas and Ferb|season= 1|credits=Writers: Kim Roberson, Marc Ceccarelli|date= 2008-07-12|network=Disney Channel}}</ref><ref name="OL">{{cite episode|title=Out to Launch|series=Phineas and Ferb|season= 1|credits=Writers: Kim Roberson, Piero Piluso, Ken Osborne|date=2008-12-05|network=Disney Channel}}</ref> called the O.W.C.A.

Much of the series' humor relies on [[running gag]]s used in almost every episode, with slight variation.<ref name="wired">{{cite magazine|url=http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2008/07/phineas-and-fer/|title=Phineas and Ferb: Kid Inventors and a Secret Agent Platypus|magazine=Wired|date=2008-07-09|author=Blum, Matt}}</ref> Most episodes follow a pattern:
*Some incident gives Phineas an idea for a project, and he announces, "Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
*Meanwhile, Perry slips away, using one of many hidden tunnels, to a secret underground base. Phineas (or occasionally another character) remarks, "Hey, where's Perry?"
*Major Monogram briefs Agent P on his mission; this sometimes amounts to nothing more than "Doctor Doofenshmirtz is up to something; find out what it is, and put a stop to it!"
*Candace sees what the boys are doing, and resolves to "bust" them (i.e., expose the project to her mother to get the boys in trouble).
*Perry breaks into the skyscraper office of Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. (complete with its own musical jingle, and sometimes variations depending on location and time). Doofenshmirtz traps Perry and explains his current evil plan. Perry escapes the trap and they battle.
*Phineas and Ferb complete their project.
*Mom gets home and Candace thinks that, at last, Mom will see what the boys have been up to and believe her, but just as Mom is about to step into the back yard, all evidence vanishes, usually as a side effect of Doofenshmirtz's device.<ref name="ex"/><ref name="wired"/>
*Doofenshmirtz, foiled again, cries out, "Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"

Other running gags:
*An adult asks Phineas if he is rather young to be performing some complex activities; he usually responds, "Yes, yes, I am," although the adult never tries to stop the boys from their fun, and Phineas usually has all legal clearance for his ideas to be executed, including [[Planning permission|building permits]].
*Doofenshmirtz's names for his contraptions all have the same suffix of "-inator," as in Shrinkinator, Giant Dog Biscuit-inator, Eradicate Rodney's-inator, etc.<ref name="AM1"/> Eventually he starts calling them "inators" as a generic term.
*Ferb rarely speaks more than once in an episode.
*Isabella, who has a crush on Phineas, comes into the backyard and asks, "Whatcha doin'?" in a distinctive singsong tone. She dislikes when other characters (besides Phineas) say the line. For example, in "Suddenly Suzy", after both Suzy and Candace speak the line, Isabella grumbles "Uh, hello!?" and "Do I even need to be here?" in response.

Certain aspects of the show's humor are aimed at adults,<ref name="411 news"/> including its frequent pop-culture references.<ref name="NYT"/> Co-creator Dan Povenmire, who had previously worked on ''[[Family Guy]]'', sought to create a less raunchy show that would make similar use of comic timing, [[Meta-joke|metahumor]], humorous blank stares, [[wordplay]] and breaking the [[fourth wall]].<ref name="AM3"/> Povenmire describes the show as a combination of ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/phineas-and-ferb/family-guy-helped-inspire-phin-16407.aspx|title='Family Guy' Helped Inspire 'Phineas and Ferb'|date=2008-02-08|author=Santiago, Rosario|work=[[BuddyTV]]|access-date=2009-08-26|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6A1ghTSC6?url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/phineas-and-ferb/family-guy-helped-inspire-phin-16407.aspx|archive-date=2012-08-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> Co-creator Jeff "Swampy" Marsh has said that the show was not created exclusively for children; he simply did not exclude them as an audience.<ref name="411 news"/>

The series' main characters live in a [[blended family]], a premise that the creators considered underused in children's programming and that reflected Marsh's own upbringing. Marsh considers explaining the family background "not important to the kids' lives.

Marsh called the characters "cool, edgy and clever without ... being mean-spirited." Animation director Rob Hughes is said to have noted that "in all the other shows every character is either stupid or a jerk, but there are no stupid characters or jerks in this one."<ref name="AM2"/>

==Music==
The series is known for some of its memorable songs that appear in almost every episode since the first-season "[[Flop Starz]]". Disney's executives particularly enjoyed the episode's song "Gitchee, Gitchee Goo" and requested that a song appear in each subsequent episode.<ref name="AM2" /> The music earned the series a total of four [[Emmy]] nominations: in 2008 for the main title theme and for the song "I Ain't Got Rhythm" from the episode "[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]],"<ref name="EmmySearch">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=&program=&start_year=2008&end_year=2008&network=180&web_category=All&winner=All|title=Emmy Awards website|work=Results for Disney nominations in 2008|access-date=2010-03-04}}</ref> and in 2010 for the song "Come Home Perry" from the episode "Oh, There You Are, Perry," as well as one for its score.{{Quote box

''Phineas and Ferb'' follows structural conventions that Povenmire and Marsh developed while writing ''Rocko's Modern Life'', whereby each episode features "a song or a musical number, plus a big action/chase scene."<ref name="AM2"/> Both creators had musical backgrounds, as Povenmire performed [[rock and roll]] in his college years<ref name="USC"/> and Marsh's grandfather was the bandleader [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]].<ref name="411 news"/>

The title sequence music, originally named "Today Is Gonna Be a Great Day" and performed by the American group [[Bowling for Soup]],<ref name="ex" /> was nominated for an [[Emmy]] award in 2008.<ref name="EmmySearch" /> The creators originally wrote a slower number more in keeping with a "classic Disney song," but the network felt that changes were needed to especially appeal to children and commissioned the rock version that made the final cut.<ref name="OSP" />

A Season 2 [[clip show]] broadcast in October 2009 focused on the show's music, featuring a viewer-voted list of the top ten songs from the series; the end result was the "Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/316427-Disney_Preps_Phineas_And_Ferb_Fall_Event.php |title=Disney Preps 'Phineas And Ferb' Fall Event |date=2009-07-26 |publisher=Multichannel News |access-date=2009-09-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114223304/http://www.multichannel.com/article/316427-Disney_Preps_Phineas_And_Ferb_Fall_Event.php |archive-date=January 14, 2010 }}</ref>

This clip show spawned a sequel called the "Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown Hosted by [[Kelly Osbourne]]," which aired on June 28, 2013.

==Origins==
[[File:Dan Povenmire and Swampy Marsh (2009).jpg|thumb|''Phineas and Ferb'' co-creators [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]] in 2009.]]

===Early inspirations===
Dan Povenmire attributes the show's genesis to his childhood in [[Mobile, Alabama]], where his mother told him to never waste a day of summer. To occupy himself, Povenmire undertook projects such as hole-digging and home movie-making. Povenmire recalled, "My mom let me drape black material all the way across one end of our living room to use as a space field. I would hang little models of spaceships for these little movies I made with a [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] camera."<ref name="AM1"/><ref name="OSP">{{cite video|title=Original Pitch By Dan Povenmire|medium=DVD|people=Dan Povenmire, Jeff "Swampy" Marsh|publisher=[[Disney DVD]]|date=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://blog.al.com/entertainment-press-register/2008/05/disney_animator_sees_summers_i.html#more|title= Disney animator sees summers in Mobile as inspiration|author=Brantley, Mark|work= Alabama press|date= 13 May 2008|access-date=2009-07-03}}</ref> He was an artistic [[child prodigy|prodigy]] and displayed his very detailed drawings at art shows.<ref name="USC"/>

Marsh was raised in a large, blended family.<ref name="411 news" /> As with Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in various activities to have fun.<ref name="AM2" />

===Conception===
[[File:Phineas original sketch.jpg|thumb|left|Drawn on [[butcher paper]], this first drawing of Phineas began a rapid growth of characters and the outline of the artistic style.<ref name="AM2"/>]]
While attending the [[University of Southern California]], Povenmire started a daily comic strip called ''Life Is a Fish'', and received money from the sale of its related merchandise. He eventually dropped out and started drawing people on street corners to make a living, until he was finally called by [[Tommy Chong]] to work on a short bit of animation in the film ''[[Far Out Man]].'' Povenmire began to take up animation professionally, working on shows such as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.<ref name="USC">{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2008/05/01/Lifestyle/Usc-Dropout.Makes.It.Big.In.Animation-3360022.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080822094907/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2008/05/01/Lifestyle/Usc-Dropout.Makes.It.Big.In.Animation-3360022.shtml |title=USC dropout makes it big in animation |date=2008-05-01 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-08-22 |author=Perez, Lauren |work=[[Daily Trojan]] |access-date=2017-03-05 }}</ref> Marsh had become a vice president of sales and marketing for a computer company until he "freaked out" and decided to quit. His friend helped him put together a portfolio and enter the animation business.<ref name="411 news"/>

Povenmire and Marsh started working across from each other as [[layout artist]]s on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. The two bonded over mutual tastes in humor and music, becoming fast friends. They continued their working relationship as a writing team on the [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'',<ref name="AM1"/> where they conceived the idea for their own series.<ref name="AM1"/> While eating dinner at a Wild Thyme restaurant in [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]], Povenmire drew a quick sketch of a "triangle kid" on [[butcher paper]].<ref name="AM3">{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/3 |title=From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", Page 3. |author=Strike, Joe |work=Animation World Magazine |date=2008-02-01 |access-date=2009-08-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901104357/http://www.awn.com/articles/production/swampy-dan-emerges-iphineas-and-ferbi/page/3 |archive-date=2010-09-01 }}</ref> He tore it out and called Marsh that night to report, "Hey, I think we have our show."<ref name="QA"/>

The triangle [[doodle]] sparked rapid development of characters and designs.<ref name="AM3"/> Povenmire decided that his sketch "looked like a Phineas," and named Ferb after a friend who "owns more tools than anyone in the world."<ref name="CC"/> The creators based their character designs on angular shapes in homage to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[Warner Bros.]] animator/director [[Tex Avery]], adding geometric shapes to the backgrounds for continuity.<ref name="AM3"/>

===Pitching and pickup===
[[File:Disney Channel HQ.jpg|thumb|upright=.764|right|[[Disney Channel]] was the first network to give the series a chance, though initially declined when [[Dan Povenmire]] originally pitched it to them.]]
The writing duo's early attempts to pitch the show failed and, though they remained committed to the concept, Povenmire and Marsh began to drift apart after their work on ''Rocko's''. Marsh moved to London and worked on shows including ''[[Postman Pat]]'' and ''[[Bounty Hamster]].'' Povenmire began working on the primetime [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Family Guy]]''<ref name="AM1"/> and the [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', always carrying a ''Phineas and Ferb'' portfolio<ref name="QA"/> for convenient pitching to networks such as [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Fox Kids]]. The networks passed on the show, believing the series' premise was too complex to succeed.<ref name="AM1"/>

Povenmire persisted and again pitched the series to Nickelodeon, where it was considered by high-level executives but rejected once more as overly complicated.<ref name="AM1"/> Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney. The network did not immediately accept the show, but told Povenmire that it would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed that this had meant an end to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually "means they throw it in the trash later." Disney then surprised him by accepting.<ref name="USC"/> Said Povenmire, "Disney was the first to say, 'Let's see if you can do it in 11 minutes.'

Povenmire was initially worried that his work on ''[[Family Guy]]'' (an adult show known for its lowbrow humor) would concern Disney, which markets its fare primarily to families. However, Disney Channel senior vice president of original series Adam Bonnett was a ''Family Guy'' fan who appreciated Povenmire's connection to the show and received his pitch well.<ref name="AM2"/> ''Family Guy'' would eventually become a Disney property following [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|their 2019 acquisition of 21st Century Fox]].

In 2006, after the Disney Channel had accepted the show, Povenmire and Marsh turned their attention to the company's overseas executives. Instead of penning a normal script, the two drew out storyboards and played them in a reel. Povenmire voiced over the reel with his dialogue and added sound effects. This novel approach secured the executives' support.<ref name="OSP"/>

==Production==

===Writing style===
The show uses four main writers to devise story ideas according to "strict guidelines", such as that the boys' schemes never appear to be "magical." Stories are reviewed at weekly sessions on a Monday, then simultaneously scripted and storyboarded. A very rough design is built before the storyboard, featuring little more than suggested scenes and dialogue, is drafted; the writers then gather for a "play-by-play" walkthrough of the storyboard in front of the whole crew, whose reactions to the jokes are assessed before rewrites are made.<ref name="Rocko">{{cite web|url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=134287|title='Rocko' writers return to TV with 'Phineas and Ferb'|work=Reading Eagle|date=2009-04-18|access-date=2009-08-26|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69vVr0Jvq?url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=134287|archive-date=2012-08-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> The writers also include running gags in every episode, which are generally lines spoken by characters.<ref name="AM1"/><ref name="trails">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.creativeloafing.com/culturesurfing/2009/05/14/phineas-ferb-trails-after-the-boys-of-summer/ |title="Phineas and Ferb" trails after the boys of summer |work=Creating Loafing |date=2009-05-14 |author=Holman, Curt |access-date=2009-08-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922043431/http://blogs.creativeloafing.com/culturesurfing/2009/05/14/phineas-ferb-trails-after-the-boys-of-summer/ |archive-date=September 22, 2009 }}</ref> Almost every episode is split into two 11-minute segments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/10314|title=''Phineas and Ferb'' Creators Talk About Emmy Nom!|author=Zahed, Ramin|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|date=2009-07-16|access-date=2009-08-18}}</ref>

===Visual aspects and animation===
[[File:PhineasFerbPaint designs.jpg|thumb|right|The stages of development for a scene during the opening theme, from the original draft (top) to the final design (bottom). The top appears briefly in the Season 1 theme.]]
[[Rough Draft Studios]] in South Korea, [[Wang Film Productions]] in Taiwan, Morning Sun Animation and Synergy Animation in Shanghai and [[Hong Ying Animation]] and [[Wang Film Productions|Hong Guang Animation]] in [[Suzhou]] animate the series in [[2D Animation]] using the software package [[Toon Boom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justpressplay.net/movie-reviews/929-dvd-reviews/4835-Phineas-and-Ferb-The-Daze-of-Summer.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907094637/http://www.justpressplay.net/movie-reviews/929-dvd-reviews/4835-Phineas-and-Ferb-The-Daze-of-Summer.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-07 |title=Phineas and Ferb: The Daze of Summer |work=Just Press Play |author=Walker, Lex |date=2009-02-14 |access-date=2009-08-26 }}</ref> Povenmire undertakes the bulk of production direction, along with [[Zac Moncrief]] and Robert Hughes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/phineas-ferb/cast/289680|title=Phineas and Ferb: Cast & Details|work=TV Guide|access-date=2009-07-12}}</ref> The series adopts artistic features from animator Tex Avery, such as geometric shapes integrated into characters, objects, and backgrounds. Povenmire says of this inclusion, "There's a little bit of Tex Avery in there-he had that very graphic style [in his later cartoons]."<ref name="AM3"/> Triangles are featured as an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in the background of every episode, sometimes in trees or buildings.<ref name="411 news"/>

Bright colors are also a prominent element of the animation. Marsh elaborates, "The idea at the end of the day was candy. One of the things that I think works so well is that the characters are so bright and candy-colored and our backgrounds are a much more realistic depiction of the world: the soft green of the grass, the natural woods for the fence. In order for all the stuff that they do to work, their world needs to be grounded in reality." The designers sought to keep their characters visually simple, so that kids "would easily be able to draw [them] themselves." Characters were also crafted to be recognizable from a distance, a technique that the creators say is based on [[Matt Groening]]'s goal of making characters recognizable by silhouette.<ref name="411 news">{{cite web|url=http://www.resource411.com/411Update/Issue/Articles/Story.cfm?StoryID=1020 |title=Phineas and Ferb: Music, Mischief, And The Endless Summer Vacation |work=411 News |author=Galas, Marjorie |access-date=2009-07-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607043445/http://www.resource411.com/411Update/Issue/Articles/Story.cfm?StoryID=1020 |archive-date=June 7, 2009 }}</ref>

The show's casting organization is responsible for selecting most of the voice actors and actresses, choosing actors such as Martella and Musso for major roles based on perceived popularity with target demographics. Povenmire and Marsh select guest stars, casting people that they "really want to work with."

==Reception and achievements==

===Reviews===
The show has received generally positive reviews. The ''[[New York Times]]'' commented favorably, describing the show as "''[[Family Guy]]'' with an espionage subplot and a big dose of [[magical realism]]." It considered the pop-culture references ubiquitous "but [placed] with such skill that it seems smart, not cheap."<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/arts/television/01phin.html?_r=2&ref=television&oref=slogin|title= Bored Stepbrothers, Intrepid Platypus |date=2008-02-01|author=Stewart, Susan|access-date=2009-07-03|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> [[Whitney Matheson]] wrote in her ''[[USA Today]]'' blog ''Pop Candy'' that the series was an achievement in children's programming, applauding the writing and calling the show "an animated version of ''[[Parker Lewis Can't Lose]].''"<ref name="TV Taste">{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2009/06/67862021/1|title=TV Taste Test: I sample 'Phineas,' 'That Metal Show' and more|author=Matheson, Whitney|date=2009-06-06|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=2009-08-26}}</ref> Emily Ashby of [[Common Sense Media]] praised the show's humor and plot, giving it four out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/phineas-and-ferb/details|title= Phineas and Ferb television review|author=Ashby, Emily|work=Common Sense Media|date= 30 January 2008|access-date=2009-08-26}}</ref> ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that the story of the show was "valiant" and that the main characters are "young heroes."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Disney summer, oil, Globetrotters, TV Lookout|publisher=The Seattle Times|location=[[Seattle]], Washington|date=2008-01-27}}</ref>

Among the negative reviews is one that charges the series with a lack of originality. Maxie Zeus of ''Toon Zone'' argues that the show is "derivative, but obviously so, and shorn of even the best features of what has been stolen." Zeus takes issue with the writing, feeling that certain jokes and conventions were "ripped-off" from other shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/articles/21300/phineas-and-ferb-spawn-of-frankenstein |title="Phineas and Ferb": Spawn of Frankenstein |work=Toon Zone |author=Zeus, Maxie |date=2008-02-01 |access-date=2009-08-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822024814/http://news.toonzone.net/articles/21300/phineas-and-ferb-spawn-of-frankenstein |archive-date=2009-08-22 }}</ref> Kevin McDonough of ''Sun Coast Today'' criticized the show for its plot complexity, constant action and "characters [that] can do just about anything."

[[Alan Sepinwall]] and [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] gave a positive assessment in their 2016 book ''[[TV (The Book)]]'', stating that "In television, formula often seems to come from a lack of imagination. ... ''Phineas and Ferb'' though, managed at the same time to be wildly imaginative and slavishly formulaic, using its repetitive structure not as a crutch, but as a sturdy framework on which it could hang all kinds of fantastic new ideas." They further added that "the characters' awareness of that formula, and any deviations from it, quickly became one of the show's most fertile sources of humor."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sepinwall|first1=Alan|last2=Seitz|first2=Matt Zoller|title=TV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time|date=6 September 2016|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|isbn=978-1455588190}}</ref>

In 2009, Disney licensed a [[Nintendo DS]] game titled ''[[Phineas and Ferb (video game)|Phineas and Ferb]]''. The game's story follows the title characters as they try to build a [[roller coaster]]. The player controls Phineas, Ferb and occasionally Agent P (Perry the Platypus). Phineas scavenges for spare parts for the roller coaster while Ferb fixes various objects around town, gaining access to new areas as a result. Ferb can also construct new parts of the coaster and its vehicle-themed carts. Each activity features a short mini-game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/16586-phineas-and-ferb-ds-game-review |title=Phineas and Ferb :: DS Game Review |publisher=Kidzworld |access-date=2009-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/phineas-and-ferb|title=Phineas and Ferb—Nintendo DS|work=GameSpy|access-date=2009-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/game/phineas-and-ferb/11032|title=Phineas and Ferb Video Game|work=Game Trailers|access-date=2009-06-23}}</ref> The game was well-received and garners a 76.67% on [[GameRankings]].<ref name="GR">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/DS/955460-phineas-and-ferb/index.html|title=Phineas and Ferb for the DS|work=Game Rankings|access-date=2009-09-21}}</ref> A sequel entitled ''Phineas and Ferb: Ride Again'' was released on September 14, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/09/phineas-and-ferb-interview/ |title=''Phineas and Ferb:'' A Sci-Fi Episode, a Soundtrack Album, and an Interview! |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2009-09-18 |access-date=2009-09-20 |author=Blum, Matt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923000858/http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/09/phineas-and-ferb-interview |archive-date=September 23, 2009 }}</ref> Another game, ''Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension'', was released for the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 3]] platforms in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highimpactgames.com/news.html |title=High Impact Games – News|publisher=[[High Impact Games]] |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref>

===Homages===
The U.K. Disney Channel has aired a series entitled ''Oscar and Michael's Phineas and Ferb Fan Club Show'' in homage to the original series. The show features two boys who attempt to emulate Phineas and Ferb by taking part in adventures to alleviate boredom.<ref name="UK 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/lewes-district-news/Seaford-boy-stars-in-Disney.5159599.jp|title=Seaford boy stars in Disney show|work=Mid Sussex Times|date=2008-04-09|access-date=2009-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822023554/http://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/lewes-district-news/Seaford-boy-stars-in-Disney.5159599.jp|archive-date=2009-08-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> The series aims to educating children and promote activity and creativity.<ref name="UK 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/seaford/Schoolboy-back-for-Disney-fun.5153557.jp|title=Schoolboy back for Disney fun|work=Eastbourne Today|date=2009-04-08|access-date=2009-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620040700/http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/seaford/Schoolboy-back-for-Disney-fun.5153557.jp|archive-date=2009-06-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> It entered its second season on April 10, 2009.<ref name="UK 1"/> The television series ''[[Psych]]'' has made references to ''Phineas and Ferb'' in its sixth season. In the episode "Shawn Rescues Darth Vader," main character Shawn Spencer (portrayed by [[James Roday]]) states that he learned his British accent from the granddad on ''Phineas and Ferb'' (he tells this to guest star [[Malcolm McDowell]], the voice of the granddad). In "The Amazing Psych Man & Tap-Man, Issue #2," Shawn mentions the series, stating: "I'm missing a ''Phineas and Ferb'' marathon. Perry the Platypus. He's a real platypus."

==''Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever''==
''Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever'' was a touring two-act adaptation of the TV show. A projection system played video in the same style as the TV show on the rear of the stage; the characters were first introduced there in their cartoon forms, but then used a backyard slide that continued into a physical slide, out of which the live cast members emerged into the real world. The performers wore [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetics]] to make their characters resemble their cartoon counterparts—mostly head pieces, but a full body suit in the cases of Buford and Perry.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thisweeknews.com/content/stories/2011/11/02/disney-live.html|title='Phineas and Ferb: The Best Live Tour Ever!' coming to Columbus|access-date=2012-07-15}}</ref> The 2011–2012 season of the tour began on August 21, 2011, in [[Lakeland, Florida]] and ended on April 22, 2012, in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneylive/phineas-and-ferb-on-tour/ |title=Welcome to Disney's Phineas and Ferb LIVE! |publisher=Disney.go.com |access-date=2012-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219045141/http://disney.go.com/disneylive/phineas-and-ferb-on-tour/ |archive-date=February 19, 2012 }}</ref> The 2012–2013 season began on August 23, 2012, in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] and ran until February 18, 2013, in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].

{{main|Take Two with Phineas and Ferb}}
Disney produced a live-action talk show in which the two characters (as cartoons) interview celebrities, similarly to ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', which began airing in December 2010 as a two-minute talk-show format featuring real-life celebrities such as [[Tony Hawk]], [[Randy Jackson]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Tom Bergeron]], [[Emma Roberts]], [[Jack Black]], [[Regis Philbin]], [[Howie Mandel]], [[David Beckham]] and [[Guy Fieri]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118026910 | work=Variety | first=Michael | last=Schneider | title=Disney XD orders 'Tron: Legacy' toon | date=2010-11-04}}</ref> The show ended on November 25, 2011.
