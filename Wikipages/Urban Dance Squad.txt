'''Urban Dance Squad''' was a Dutch [[rap rock]] band formed after what was originally intended as a one-time jam-session at a festival in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] on December 20, 1986.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.uds.nl/biography.htm| title=Urban Dance Squad | date=November 17, 2008}}</ref>  The band consisted of a guitarist, bassist, drummer, rapper, and DJ.  Urban Dance Squad was one of the most successful Dutch bands of the nineties, releasing five studio albums.

== Career ==

Urban Dance Squad first got together in 1986, at a jam session in De Vrije Vloer, a club in Utrecht, a jam which resulted in the first Dutch rock band with a rapper (they borrowed the name from [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]'s ''[[Urban Dancefloor Guerillas]]''); a song, "Struggle for Jive"; and the blending of white and black music in the Netherlands, at the same time that [[Fishbone]], [[Living Colour]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Faith No More]], and the [[Beastie Boys]] were doing the same in the United States.<ref name=fris>{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2676/Cultuur/article/detail/764904/2006/07/25/Zo-goed-zo-nieuw-zo-fris.dhtml|title=Zo goed zo nieuw zo fris|last=Baartman|first=Nicoline|date=25 July 2006|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|access-date=24 February 2012}}</ref> The band recorded its first album, ''[[Mental Floss for the Globe]]'', in Brussels in 1989 (produced by [[Jean-Marie Aerts]], of [[TC Matic]]), and came to instant success. It won an [[Edison Award]], and the single "[[Deeper Shade of Soul]]" was a hit in Europe, and in the United States, where it charted at number 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Two more singles were released from the album, and Urban Dance Squad toured the US in 1991, opening for Living Colour--''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'' described their music as "refried [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]] riffs and neo-[[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] guitar solos complete with sound effects and old soul records to produce an exceedingly loud, densely packed, dissonant garage-rock stew."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZoFhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=32MEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4396,4358857&dq=mental-floss-for-the-globe&hl=en|title=UDS, Living Colour bring new hues to rock|last=King|first=Peter B.|date=24 January 1991|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|page=D7|access-date=24 February 2012}}</ref> The UDS had always been a volatile unit with the band members frequently arguing, and this came to a head while touring as the opening act for [[U2]], after the release of ''[[Life 'n Perspectives of a Genuine Crossover]]'', when DJ DNA quit abruptly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://lflmagazine.nl/blog/bang-voor-het-buitenland|title=Bang voor het buitenland|last=Haagsma|first=Robert|date=30 May 2014|work=Lust for life|language=nl|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref>

In the middle of the band's career, to capitalize on the success of [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]], Urban Dance Squad released ''[[Persona Non Grata (Urban Dance Squad album)|Persona Non Grata]]'' in January 1994. All of the tracks feature heavy use of distortion and guitar. The singles "No Honestly" and "Candy Strip Exp." were released, the latter single being released as a radio edit that cuts most of the pre-song noise.

''[[Artantica]]'' saw release in 1999, and was a return to the band's hip-hop roots, and received critical acclaim. Urban Dance Squad disbanded the following year, though they did perform together again as late as 2006.<ref name=fris/>
