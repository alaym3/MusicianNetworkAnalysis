==The Dreamville Foundation==
In October 2011, Cole established The Dreamville Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The Foundation says that it was "created to 'bridge the gap' between the worlds of opportunity and the urban youth" of Cole's hometown of [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]]. With volunteers, the Foundation conducts philanthropic activities, such as an annual "Back To School Supply Giveaway" to provide supplies to school children.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://0-search.ebscohost.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nfh&AN=2W62412357094&site=eds-live&scope=site |title=J.

It sponsors an annual weekend of Fayetteville community events called the "Dreamville Weekend" that features a discussion with the Young Men's Book Club and Appreciation Dinner and a Career Day panel of African-American professionals in a variety of fields.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Dreamville Foundation {{!}} Bridging the gap between the world of opportunity and the urban youth. |url=http://www.thedreamvillefoundation.org/ |website=www.thedreamvillefoundation.org |access-date=October 22, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, Cole purchased his childhood home in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for $120,000 through the Dreamville Foundation. The home had been repossessed from his mother years earlier, while Jermaine was attending college in New York. His plan is to turn the house into a homestead for single mothers and their children to live rent-free. In 2017 [[NFL]] player [[Colin Kaepernick]] donated $32,000 to the foundation. The money will fund multiple projects for the organization.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Jeremy|title=Colin Kaepernick Donates $34,000 to J.

So you can create it and take it everywhere. To bring that into the festival—where you can just create a place and make it Dreamville and be able to bring people there—was always this cool goal. And that's what makes it unique. It's not based in an actual city. It's just based in our minds."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Setaro |first1=Shawn |title=How Dreamville's First Festival Came to Life |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/04/how-dreamville-fest-came-to-life |website=Complex |access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref>
