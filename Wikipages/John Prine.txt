'''John Edward Prine'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/nashville-tn/john-prine-9116778|title = John Prine Obituary - Nashville, TN}}</ref> (October 10, 1946&nbsp;– April 7, 2020) was an American [[country folk]] singer-songwriter. He was active as a composer, recording artist, live performer, and occasional actor from the early 1970s until his death. He was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.

Born and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |access-date=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the [[U.S. Army]], he returned to Chicago in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs first as a hobby, and then becoming a club performer.

A member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], Prine credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]] and singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]] with discovering him, resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|eponymous debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed with [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1981, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums.

Widely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect sometimes melancholy tales from his life.  According to [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] songwriter [[Bob Dylan]], "Prine's stuff is pure [[Marcel Proust|Proustian]] [[existentialism]]. [[Midwestern]] mindtrips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs. . . . All that stuff about 'Sam Stone', the soldier junkie daddy, and 'Donald and Lydia', where people make love from ten miles away. Nobody but Prine could write like that."<ref name="huff_post_dylan">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/15/bob-dylan-exclusive-inter_n_187216.html|title=Bob Dylan Exclusive Interview: Reveals His Favorite Songwriters, Thoughts On His Own Cult Figure Status|last=Flanagan|first=Bill|date=April 15, 2009|work=[[HuffPost|Huffington Post]]|access-date=July 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722235252/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/15/bob-dylan-exclusive-inter_n_187216.html|archive-date=July 22, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>  In 2020, Prine received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

==Early life==
Prine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both originally from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]]. He was born and raised in the Chicago suburb of Maywood.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Barry|first=Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/arts/music/john-prine-endures-with-a-half-smile-and-a-song.html|title=John Prine Endures, With a Half-Smile and a Song|date=April 6, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 30, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330175317/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/arts/music/john-prine-endures-with-a-half-smile-and-a-song.html|archive-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcAvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA76 |title=John Prine: In Spite of Himself|first=Eddie|last=Huffman|date=March 15, 2015|page=76|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=9780292748224|via=Google Books}}</ref> In summers, they would go back to visit family near [[Paradise, Kentucky]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/programs/john-prine-discusses-his-life-and-his-formation-music-0 |title=John Prine discusses his life and his formation in music |date=1975 |work=Studs Terkel Radio Archive |access-date=April 11, 2020 |publisher=WFMT and Chicago History Museum |language=en}}</ref> Prine started playing guitar at age 14, taught by his brother, David.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrout.co.uk/jpbackpage.html |title=John Prine Information |website=Shrout.co.uk |date=October 10, 1946 |access-date=March 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006062927/http://www.shrout.co.uk/jpbackpage.html |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/98957222421345075 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |access-date=April 26, 2018}}</ref> and graduated from [[Proviso East High School]] in [[Maywood, Illinois]].

==Chicago folk scene==
In the late 1960s, while Prine was delivering mail, he began to sing his songs (often first written in his head on the mail route) at [[open mic|open-microphone]] evenings at the Fifth Peg on Armitage Avenue in Chicago.  The bar was a gathering spot for nearby Old Town School of Folk Music teachers and students. Prine was initially a spectator, reluctant to perform, but eventually did so in response to a "You think you can do better?" comment made to him by another performer.<ref name=Kot>{{Cite news |last=Kot |first=Greg |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2010-02-28-ct-ae-0228-john-prine-20100228-story.html |title=John Prine recalls his Chicago folk roots |date=February 28, 2010 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=April 8, 2020 |language=en-US}}</ref> After his first open mic, he was offered paying gigs.

In 1971, Prine was playing regularly at the Earl of Old Town. Steve Goodman, who was performing with Kris Kristofferson at another Chicago club, persuaded Kristofferson to go see Prine late one night.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8515459/john-prine-songwriters-hall-of-fame-interview|title=John Prine Shares the Remarkable 'Cinderella Story' of How His Career Got Started|date=June 11, 2019|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref> Kristofferson later recalled, "By the end of the first line we knew we were hearing something else.

==Recording career==
=== 1970s ===
Prine's [[John Prine (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in 1971. Kristofferson (who once remarked that Prine wrote songs so good that "we'll have to break his thumbs"<ref name="Chilton, Martin 2013">{{cite news|last=Chilton|first=Martin|title=John Prine: I Find the Human Condition Funny|work=Daily Telegraph|date=February 8, 2013|access-date=April 12, 2020|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9853440/John-Prine-I-find-the-human-condition-funny.html}}</ref>), invited Prine and Goodman to open for him at [[The Bitter End]] in New York City. In the audience was [[Jerry Wexler]], who signed Prine to [[Atlantic Records]] the next day.<ref name="Betts"/> The album included Prine's signature songs "Illegal Smile" and  "[[Sam Stone (song)|Sam Stone]]", and songs that became folk and country standards, "[[Angel from Montgomery]]" and "[[Paradise (John Prine song)|Paradise]]." The album also featured "Hello in There", a song about aging that was later covered by numerous artists, and "Far From Me", a lonely [[waltz]] about lost love for a waitress, which Prine later said was his favorite of all his songs. The album received many positive reviews, and some hailed Prine as "the next Dylan." Bob Dylan himself appeared unannounced at one of Prine's first New York City club appearances, anonymously backing him on harmonica.<ref name="Huffman">{{cite book |last1=Huffman |first1=Eddie |title=John Prine: In Spite of Himself |date=2015 |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |isbn=9780292748224 |pages=69–70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcAvBgAAQBAJ |access-date=April 7, 2020 |quote=''Rolling Stone'' caught up with Prine in New York shortly before the album's release [referring to ''Diamonds in the Rough'']. The opening paragraph of Ed McCormack's story described Prine on stage at the Bitter End, halfway through a six-night stand, calling out for a special guest: 'Whar's that harmonica player?' The 'nervously nondescript figure' who joined him was none other than Bob Dylan.}}</ref>

Prine's second album, ''[[Diamonds in the Rough (album)|Diamonds in the Rough]]'' (1972), was a surprise for many after the critical success of his first LP; it was an uncommercial, stripped-down affair that reflected Prine's fondness for [[bluegrass music]] and features songs reminiscent of [[Hank Williams]]. Highlights of the compilation include the allegorical "[[The Great Compromise (song)|The Great Compromise]]", which includes a recitation and addresses the [[Vietnam War]], and the ballad "Souvenirs", which Prine later recorded with Goodman.<ref>{{cite web |title=Looking Back on John Prine Buddy Steve Goodman |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/looking-back-on-john-prine-buddy-steve-goodman-860284/ |website=www.rollingstone.com |date=July 19, 2019 |publisher=Rollingstone |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>

His subsequent albums from the nineteen seventies include ''[[Sweet Revenge (John Prine album)|Sweet Revenge]]'' (1973), containing such fan favorites as "Dear Abby", "Grandpa Was a Carpenter", and "Christmas in Prison", and [[Common Sense (John Prine album)|''Common Sense'']] (1975), with "Come Back to Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard." The latter album was Prine's first to chart on the U.S
Top 100 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and reflected his growing commercial success. It was produced by Steve Cropper. ''[[Bruised Orange]]'' from 1978 is a Steve Goodman-produced album that gave listeners songs such as "That's The Way That The World Goes 'Round", "Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone", "Fish and Whistle", and the title track.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cocks |first1=Jay |title=Bruised Orange |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bruised-orange-190100/ |website=www.rollingstone.com |date=September 7, 1978 |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>

In 1974, singer [[David Allan Coe]] achieved considerable success on the country charts with "[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]", co-written by Prine and Goodman. The song good-naturedly spoofs stereotypical country music lyrics to create what it self-describes as "the perfect country and western song." Prine refused to take a songwriter's credit (stating he was too drunk when the song was written to remember what he had contributed) and Goodman received sole credit. Goodman bought Prine a [[jukebox]] as a gift from his publishing royalties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMiLqHTvbKE|title=John Prine – You Never Even Call Me by My Name (1987)|publisher=YouTube|access-date=October 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228063135/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMiLqHTvbKE&gl=US&hl=en&has_verified=1&bpctr=9999999999|archive-date=February 28, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1975, Prine toured the U.S. and Canada with a full band featuring guitarist [[Arlen Roth]].<ref>{{cite web |title=About Arlen Roth |url=https://www.arlenroth.com/about |website=www.arlenroth.com |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>

The 1979 album ''[[Pink Cadillac (album)|Pink Cadillac]]'' features two songs produced by [[Sun Records]] founder [[Sam Phillips]], who by this time rarely did any studio work. The song "Saigon" is about a [[Vietnam veteran]] traumatized by the war ("The static in my attic's gettin' ready to blow"). During the recording, one of the [[guitar amplifiers]] blew up (which is evident on the album).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ramsey |first1=Jan |title=John Prine |url=http://www.offbeat.com/articles/john-prine/ |website=offbeat.com |publisher=Offbeat Magazine |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> The other song Phillips produced is "How Lucky", about Prine's hometown.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Betts |first1=Stephen |title=Hear John Prine Update His 'Song of Personal Confrontation' 'How Lucky' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/john-prine-how-lucky-amazon-music-723667/ |website=www.rollingstone.com |date=September 14, 2018 |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>

=== 1980s ===
In 1981, rejecting the established model of the recording industry, which Prine felt exploited singers and songwriters, he co-founded the independent record label [[Oh Boy Records]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. His fans, supporting the project, sent him enough money to cover the costs, in advance, of his next album.<ref name=":0"/> Prine continued writing and recording albums throughout the 1980s. His songs continued to be covered by other artists; the country supergroup [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] recorded "The 20th Century Is Almost Over", which had been written by Prine and Goodman. Steve Goodman died of [[leukemia]] in 1984 and Prine contributed four tracks to ''A Tribute to Steve Goodman'', including a cover version of Goodman's "My Old Man."<ref>{{cite news|last=Oermann|first=Robert K.|title=Sade's 'Promise' broken; Grace's is the 'Greatest'|newspaper=The Tennessean|date=January 12, 1986}}</ref>

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Prine released the [[Grammy Award]]-winning ''The Missing Years'', his first collaboration with producer and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|Heartbreakers]] bassist [[Howie Epstein]]. The title song records Prine's humorous take on what Jesus did in the unrecorded years between his childhood and [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]].<ref name="Rolling Stone Milward">{{cite news |last1=Milward |first1=John |title=The Missing Years |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-missing-years-92682/ |access-date=April 7, 2020 |work=Rolling Stone |date=January 23, 1992 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408035952/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-missing-years-92682/ |archive-date=April 8, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="LA Times Davis">{{cite news |last1=Davis |first1=Noel |title=Finding Success in 'Missing Years' : Pop music: John Prine, who will perform at the Coach House, says the popularity of his latest album caught him by surprise. |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-07-07-ca-1761-story.html |access-date=April 7, 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 7, 1992 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408035952/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-07-07-ca-1761-story.html |archive-date=April 8, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Elsewhere Reid">{{cite web |last1=Reid |first1=Graham |title=John Prine: The Missing Years (1991) |url=https://www.elsewhere.co.nz/essentialelsewhere/2043/john-prine-the-missing-years-1991/ |website=Elsewhere |access-date=April 7, 2020 |date=March 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408040505/https://www.elsewhere.co.nz/essentialelsewhere/2043/john-prine-the-missing-years-1991/ |archive-date=April 8, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1995, ''[[Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings]]'' was released, another collaboration with Epstein.<ref name="Rolling Stone Manning">{{cite news |last1=Manning |first1=Kara |title=John Prine: 'It's Hard to Write a Happy Love Song' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/john-prine-lost-dogs-mixed-blessings-album-interview-1995-191626/ |access-date=April 7, 2020 |work=Rolling Stone |date=September 21, 1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408041204/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/john-prine-lost-dogs-mixed-blessings-album-interview-1995-191626/ |archive-date=April 8, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> On this album is the long track, ''Lake Marie'', a partly spoken word song interweaving tales over decades centered on themes of 'goodbye'.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Coyle |first=Jake |url=https://oklahoman.com/article/5659790/essential-tracks-from-john-prine-folk-musics-mark-twain/ |title=Essential tracks from John Prine, folk music's Mark Twain |date=April 10, 2020 |work=The Oklahoman |access-date=April 11, 2020 |agency=Associated Press |language=en-US}}</ref> Bob Dylan later cited it as perhaps his favorite Prine song.<ref name=Doyal2017/> Prine followed it up in 1999 with ''[[In Spite of Ourselves]]'', which was unusual for him in that it contained only one original song (the title track); the rest were covers of classic country songs.

Prine recorded a version of [[Stephen Foster]]'s "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]" in 2004 for the compilation album ''[[Beautiful Dreamer (album)|Beautiful Dreamer]]'', which won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title=47th Annual GRAMMY Awards (2004) |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/47th-annual-grammy-awards-2004 |website=www.grammy.com |date=November 28, 2017 |publisher=Grammy.com |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>

In 2005, Prine released his first all-new offering since ''Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings'', the album ''[[Fair & Square]]'', which tended toward a more laid-back, acoustic approach. The album contains songs such as "Safety Joe", about a man who has never taken any risks in his life, and also "Some Humans Ain't Human", Prine's protest piece on the album, which talks about the ugly side of [[human nature]] and includes a quick shot at President [[George W. Bush]]. ''Fair & Square'' won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. The album contains original songs plus two covers: [[A.P.

Six months later, he was touring again.<ref name="auto"/>
