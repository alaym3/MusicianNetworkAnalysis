'''Zola Blood''' is an English four-piece [[indie pop]] band from [[London]], England. They released their debut album, ''Infinite Games'', in 2017.

==History==
Originating in different areas of the country, the four met in East London's [[Hackney Wick]] in 2013.

Zola Blood continued rehearsing and some of their first recordings emerged in 2014. Their debut single "Grace" garnered interest from blogs worldwide and was soon followed by another track, "Meridian". Both songs reached the top of the [[Hype Machine]] chart. "Meridian" was remixed by [[Berlin]] producer Applescal, and thus introduced the band to new audiences. The band released their first EP, ''Meridian'', in October 2014.

In 2015, the band teamed up with jazz musician [[Richard Formby]] ([[The Jazz Butcher]]) and released the single "Play Out/Pieces of the Day". On this track, they experimented with modular synths and outboard gear in a lengthy studio session spanning south London and [[Leeds]]. The single earned them a late-night slot at the [[Secret Garden Party]] music festival in the summer of the same year. In 2016, they began work on their debut LP ''Infinite Games''. They collaborated with various other musicians including Oli Bayston ([[Boxed In]]) and Duncan Tootill. The album's first single, "Heartbeat", was released in July 2016 and blended pop and techno influences. "Islands" followed on New Year's Eve and featured on a number of major [[Spotify]] playlists, including the US New Music Friday playlist.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/new-music-to-listen-to-this-week-zola-blood-a7488866.html |title=New music to listen to this week: Zola Blood |publisher=independent.co.uk |author=O'Connor, Roisin |date=December 21, 2016 |access-date=May 26, 2019}}</ref> The album was released in May 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://therevue.ca/2017/05/31/zola-blood-infinite-games-album-review/ |title=Zola Blood "Infinite Games" album review |publisher=therevue.ca |author=Yung, Ben |date=May 31, 2017 |access-date=May 26, 2019}}</ref>
