===Nerdcore===
[[File:MC Chris.jpg|thumb|mc chris performing in February 2008]]

Ward originally performed with [[Dirt Bike Annie|The Lee Majors]]. While he is one of the artists most closely associated with the genre of [[nerdcore]], he had been hesitant to accept the nerdcore label and described his music as "a genre in and of itself".<ref name="SW-062507">{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Bonnie |title=mc chris: Napping with Artoo |url=https://www.starwars.com/community/news/rocks/news20070625.html |work=Fans |publisher=[[Starwars.com]] |date=June 25, 2007 |access-date=September 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326062522/http://www.starwars.com/community/news/rocks/news20070625.html |archive-date=March 26, 2010 }}</ref> as well as expressing concern over limiting himself to such a narrow audience and subject matter.<ref name="NYT-080507">{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Alex |title= Dungeons, Dragons and Dope Beats  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/fashion/05nerdcore.html |work=Fashion & Style |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=August 5, 2007 |access-date=May 20, 2009}}</ref><ref name="BOSTON-110407">{{cite web |last=Miranda |first=Jeff |title=Refrain of the nerds |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/11/04/refrain_of_the_nerds/?page=3 |work=[[Boston Globe]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=November 4, 2007 |access-date=May 20, 2009}}</ref> He has appeared in news stories dealing with nerd culture and nerdcore.<ref name=60minutes>[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=3028498&blogId=426314281 myspace.com/mcchris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |date=February 7, 2009 }} MC Chris blog. August 22, 2008</ref> Of his nerdcore background, he said, "It's nice that a lot of folks consider me part of it. It's actually embarrassing how I used to think I was the only one playing with ''Star Wars'' toys and making music, and it just wasn't true. I have absolutely no problem with the label now."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=47300|title=All The Sucker MCs Can Call Me Sire: An Interview with mc chris - Comic Book Resources|work=comicbookresources.com}}</ref> He self-releases with no record label.

In 2012, Ward told security guards to eject a fan from the audience at his show in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], for posting a critical comment on [[Twitter]] about Ward's opening act, [[Richie Branson]]. After receiving criticism from fans for the incident, Ward apologized in an online video. The fan received a refund, but complained on [[Reddit]] that he was humiliated by the experience.<ref>Eakin, Marah (July 19, 2012).
