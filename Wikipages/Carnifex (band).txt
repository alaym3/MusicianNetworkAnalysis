'''Carnifex''' is an American [[deathcore]] band from [[San Diego County]], [[California]]. Formed in 2005, they are currently signed to [[Nuclear Blast]] after having been signed to [[Victory Records]]. They have released eight full-length albums and three EPs. Since 2007, the band has consisted of founding members Scott Ian Lewis (lead vocals) and Shawn Cameron (drums, keyboards), along with Cory Arford (guitars, backing vocals) and Fred Calderon (bass).

==History==
===Formation and early recordings (2005–2006)===
Carnifex was founded in December 2005 in [[Fallbrook, California]]. They debuted their career with a self-titled EP, which was released on May 18, 2006. It features five tracks and was distributed through Enclave Records. In September 2006, Rick James and Kevin Vargas left the band. Shortly thereafter, Steve McMahon joined on bass and Travis Whiting joined on guitars.

Carnifex recorded an EP before the end of 2006 titled ''[[Love Lies in Ashes]]'', which was released through Acropolisrpm Records on March 13, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8190097&style=music|title=Carnifex MP3 Music Download|website=Cduniverse.com|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> It was sold exclusively at shows as well as online stores such as [[iTunes]] before the group began work on their full-length debut album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carnifex - EP by Carnifex |date=March 13, 2007 |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/carnifex-ep/id251062761 |publisher=[[iTunes]] |access-date=23 July 2011 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122182428/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/carnifex-ep/id251062761 |archive-date=22 January 2014 }}</ref>

===''Dead in My Arms'' (2007–2008)===
After their release of ''[[Love Lies in Ashes]]'', Carnifex was signed to underground label This City Is Burning Records in March 2007, and they recorded their debut full length ''[[Dead in My Arms]]'', with yet another member change. The band, though, was still a four-piece outfit, with current guitarist Cory Arford replacing Travis Whiting in March 2007. The line-up during the recording of ''Dead in My Arms'' was Scott Lewis (vocals), Shawn Cameron (drums), Steve McMahon (bass) and Cory Arford (guitars).

''Dead in My Arms'' was released on July 12, 2007. Carnifex began touring full-time with the record's release. Touring guitarist Jake Anderson was recruited as a lead guitarist from July to November 2007. During this time, the band toured with groups such as [[Emmure]], [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]], and [[MyChildren MyBride]], [[For Today]], [[12:08]], among others. The reasonable success of ''Dead in My Arms'', and the prevalence of the [[deathcore]] genre as a whole, attracted the attention of [[Victory Records]]. In November 2007, after the departure of Steve McMahon and Jake Anderson, Carnifex signed a deal with Victory with now current members Fred Calderon (bass) and Ryan Gudmunds (lead guitar).

===''The Diseased and the Poisoned'' (2008–2009)===
Carnifex's second album, ''[[The Diseased and the Poisoned]]'', was released on June 24, 2008, and reached No.&nbsp;19 on the [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']] Top Heatseekers Chart.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p973194/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard], [[allmusic]].

Their third album ''[[Hell Chose Me]]'' features a sound relating more to [[death metal]] along with some [[black metal]] influences, as well as some aspects that the band did not visit before, such as including choruses and [[guitar solo]]s into their songs.<ref name="Noisecreep">{{cite web |url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2010/03/16/carnifex-deathcore-tag/ |title=Carnifex Vocalist Doesn't Fear the Deathcore Tag |publisher=[[Noisecreep]] |date=March 16, 2010}}</ref> However, the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Until I Feel Nothing]]'', features much more eccentric influences, even into the realm of [[black metal]] with its themes and atmospheric elements.<ref name="smn">{{cite web |title=Carnifex - Until I Feel Nothing |url=http://www.smnnews.com/2011/11/02/carnifex-until-i-feel-nothing/ |publisher=SMNnews.com |date=November 2, 2011 |access-date=2013-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103446/http://www.smnnews.com/2011/11/02/carnifex-until-i-feel-nothing/ |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teethofthedivine.com/featured/interview-with-carnifex/ |title=Interview with Carnifex |publisher=Teeth of the Divine |date=July 24, 2012}}</ref> On the album, the band emphasized their [[black metal]] influences more, such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Burzum]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Watain]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], and [[Cradle of Filth]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/CarnifexMetal/posts/350745015025780|title=Carnifex|website=Facebook.com|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref>

In an interview with vocalist Scott Lewis about the "deathcore" label, he stated, "We're not one of those bands trying to escape the banner of deathcore. I know a lot of bands try and act like they have a big problem with that, but if you listen to their music, they are very 'deathcore.'"<ref name="Noisecreep"/>

===Lyrical themes===
Carnifex's lyrics are all based around negative themes. Lead vocalist Scott Lewis has stated the theme of Carnifex will always be negative even when the state of mind he is in is positive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impericon.com/en/blog/interview-with-scott-ian-lewis-carnifex-about-die-without-hope/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729001627/http://www.impericon.com/en/blog/interview-with-scott-ian-lewis-carnifex-about-die-without-hope/ |archive-date=2014-07-29 }}</ref> The band's first album ''[[Dead in My Arms]]'' mainly concerns [[broken heart|heartbreak]] and [[self-harm]], while all the albums by the band reference lyrics about [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[betrayal]], [[hopelessness]], [[anger]], and [[hatred]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-rules.com/2014/02/19/carnifex-interview-with-scott-lewis/|title=Carnifex – Interview With Scott Lewis|first=Peter|last=Atkinson|date=19 February 2014|website=Metal-Rules.com|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref>
{{cquote|I always have written from a personal perspective. My personal life for the last few years really fell apart.
