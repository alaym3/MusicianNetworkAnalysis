'''Ian Stephen McCulloch''' (born 5 May 1959) is an English singer-songwriter and musician, best known as the [[frontman]] of the rock group [[Echo & the Bunnymen]].<ref>"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p103714/biography|pure_url=yes}} Ian McCulloch > Overview]".

==Career==
[[File:IanMcCulloch.jpg|thumb|McCulloch in Amsterdam in 2006]]

McCulloch was a singer-songwriter with the [[Crucial Three]], one of many local bands that sprang up amongst the regulars who patronised a Liverpool club called [[Eric's Club|Eric's]] in the late '70s. The other two members were [[Julian Cope]] and [[Pete Wylie]] who went on to form Wah!. The band existed between May and June 1977, and never got beyond rehearsals.<ref name="Frame">Frame, Pete (1980) "Liverpool 1980: Eric's Progeny" (Rock Family Tree)</ref> In July 1978, along with future members of [[the Teardrop Explodes]] – Cope, Mick Finkler and [[Paul Simpson (musician)|Paul Simpson]] – and drummer Dave Pickett, McCulloch formed [[A Shallow Madness]].<ref name="Frame" /><ref name="Strong">Strong, Martin C. (1999) ''The Great Alternative & Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|0-86241-913-1}}, p. 223-4</ref> Again the band did not perform or record, but an acoustic version of the band, under the name 'Uh', played live twice.<ref name="Frame" /> The band split up in September 1978.<ref name="Frame" />

In October 1978, McCulloch founded [[Echo & the Bunnymen]] with [[Will Sergeant]] (guitar), [[Les Pattinson]] (bass), and a [[drum machine]] (allegedly named Echo), making their live début at Eric's in November that year.<ref name="Frame" /> In October 1979, the Bunnymen exchanged the drum machine for [[Pete de Freitas]] on drums. With their line up solidified, the Bunnymen played in the late 1970s and early 1980s, releasing their critically praised debut album, ''[[Crocodiles (album)|Crocodiles]]'' in 1980, and the heavier, bass-driven ''Heaven Up Here'' in 1981. They released their third album ''Porcupine'' in 1983 with the lead single "The Cutter" finishing in the top 10 of the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]]. ''[[Ocean Rain]]'' followed in 1984. Shortly before the album was released, McCulloch described ''Ocean Rain'' as "the greatest album ever made."<ref>{{cite news |last=Hutchinson |first=Charles |url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/music/9268760.Echo___The_Bunnymen__Grand_Opera_House__York__September_29/ |title=Echo & The Bunnymen, Grand Opera House, York. |website=Yorkpress.co.uk |date=23 September 2011|access-date=5 January 2013}}</ref> McCulloch later said: "When I sing '[[The Killing Moon]]' I know there isn't a band in the world who's got a song anywhere near that."<ref>{{cite news |author=Harrison, Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/apr/13/magazine.features7?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=This much I know: Ian McCulloch |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 12 April 2003 |access-date=5 January 2013 |location=London}}</ref>

In 1988, McCulloch left the group to pursue a solo career under the impression the Bunnymen would be laid to rest, if only temporarily.<ref name="Strong" /> When the remaining Bunnymen continued using the name with new singer [[Noel Burke]], the split became permanent with McCulloch referring to the band as "Echo & the Bogusmen".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/bunnymen-bounce-back-1.140826|title=Bunnymen bounce back|first=Kevin|last=Courtney|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|access-date=30 July 2020}}</ref>

In 1990, McCulloch released the album ''[[Candleland]]'' which reflected a more mature outlook on the world, owing to the recent deaths of McCulloch's father<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atomicduster.com/interviews/ian_mcculloch/index.php|title=Interview - Ian McCulloch|website=Atomicduster.com|access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref> and [[Pete de Freitas]], and peaked at number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="Strong" /> It yielded two [[Modern Rock Tracks]] hits, "Proud to Fall" (No. 1 for 4 weeks) and "Faith and Healing". The album ''[[Mysterio (album)|Mysterio]]'' was released in 1992 as the public's interest in the former Bunnyman was waning and sold less than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pauldunoyer.com/pages/journalism/journalism_item.asp?journalismID=280|title=Paul Du Noyer interviews Echo & The Bunnymen|work=pauldunoyer.com|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527233845/http://www.pauldunoyer.com/pages/journalism/journalism_item.asp?journalismID=280|archive-date=27 May 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Shortly after, McCulloch left the public eye to devote more time to his family.

In 1993, McCulloch partnered with [[Johnny Marr]] of [[the Smiths]], writing an album's worth of material. McCulloch has credited Marr with helping him regain his lost confidence and rejuvenating his desire to create music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-04/entertainment/ca-64820_1_ian-mcculloch|title=Bad Blood Is Only an Echo : With Electrafixion, Onetime Bunnymen Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant Are Rockin' Again|website=Latimes}}</ref> When it was suggested that [[Will Sergeant]] be brought in to work on the songs, the tapes were allegedly stolen from a courier van preventing Sergeant from offering any input.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2008-12-03/music/seven-lost-albums-that-should-never-be-found/|title=Seven Lost Albums That Should Never Be Found |author=Stout, Andrew |work=Seattle Weekly |date=2 December 2008}}</ref>

The rekindling of the relationship between McCulloch and Sergeant led to the formation of [[Electrafixion]] in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/electrafixion-mn0000135112/biography|title=Electrafixion &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref> The band released the album ''[[Burned (album)|Burned]]'' which peaked at number 38 in the UK and included the top-30 hit "Sister Pain".<ref name="Strong" /> The band soon found themselves performing set lists composed of half Electrafixion songs and half Echo & the Bunnymen songs.

In 1997, Echo & the Bunnymen reformed and released the album ''[[Evergreen (Echo & the Bunnymen album)|Evergreen]]'' to positive reviews and chart success. ''Evergreen'' made the top 10 of the [[UK Albums Chart]] and the single "[[Nothing Lasts Forever (Echo & the Bunnymen song)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]" reached No. 8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="guinness">Roberts, David, ed. (2006). ''[[Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums|British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' (19th ed.). [[HiT Entertainment]]. {{ISBN|1-904994-10-5}}.</ref> The reformed Bunnymen have since recorded several further albums, the most recent being ''Meteorites'' which was released in 2014.

At the height of the Bunnymen's popularity, McCulloch earned the nickname "Mac the Mouth" due to a penchant for witty, blunt criticism of artists he deemed inferior, while proclaiming the Bunnymen's superiority. Targets of his observations included [[Bono]] of [[U2]] and [[Julian Cope]]. More recently, in 2011, McCulloch said of Bono: "Had he been in Liverpool, he would have been laughed out of the place. U2 have never been liked in Liverpool. We know a fake when we see one." McCulloch said that during the early 1980s, Bono told him the Bunnymen could break America but only if they toured there for three months. McCulloch said: "Three months? I can't spend three minutes in [[Birkenhead]] without going daft, let alone America."<ref>{{cite news |author=Power, Ed |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/echo-and-the-bunnymens-ian-mcculloch-lets-rip-2885790.html |title=Echo and the Bunnymen's Ian McCulloch lets rip |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]] |location=Dublin |date=23 September 2011 |access-date=5 January 2013}}</ref>

In 1998, McCulloch teamed up with the [[Spice Girls]], Tommy Scott of [[Space (indie rock band)|Space]], and Simon Fowler of [[Ocean Colour Scene]] as 'England United' to record "Top of the World", the official song for [[England national football team|Team England]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], although it fared less well than a reissue of "[[Three Lions]]". He enjoyed more success working as a mentor for [[Coldplay]] during the recording of their 2002 album ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dufour |first=Matt |title=Members of Coldplay Join Ian McCulloch on New Solo Effort |url=http://www.thefader.com/2002/10/23/members-of-coldplay-join-ian-mcculloch-on-new-solo-effort/ |work=The Fader |access-date=7 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928053707/http://www.thefader.com/2002/10/23/members-of-coldplay-join-ian-mcculloch-on-new-solo-effort/ |archive-date=28 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2003, McCulloch released his third solo album ''[[Slideling]]'' and undertook a solo tour in support of the album.

McCulloch has been a lifetime supporter of [[Liverpool F.C.]] In 2006, he took part in recording the team's anthem with the Bootroom Allstars – a remake of the [[Johnny Cash]] song "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", and was on the judging panel for the music competition [[Pringles Unsung]].<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6180594.stm|title=Talking Shop: Ian McCulloch|date=28 November 2006|url-status=live|location=London|publisher=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111152148/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6180594.stm|archive-date=11 January 2007 |access-date=30 July 2016}}</ref>

In 2010, McCulloch featured in a guest role on the song "[[Some Kind of Nothingness]]" by the [[Manic Street Preachers]] from their tenth album ''[[Postcards from a Young Man]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/nov/02/manic-street-preachers-some-kind-of-nothingness|title=Exclusive video: Manic Street Preachers feat Ian McCulloch – Some Kind of Nothingness|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 November 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, McCulloch released a solo LP, ''Pro Patria Mori'' and a live album ''Holy Ghosts'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/ian-mcculloch-holy-ghostspro-patria-mori-demon-8571959.html |title=Ian McCulloch, Holy Ghosts/Pro Patria Mori |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London |date=13 April 2013 |access-date=3 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/apr/07/ian-mcculloch-on-my-radar |title=Ian McCulloch's cultural highlights |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=7 April 2013 |access-date=3 November 2013 }}</ref>

In October 2017, McCulloch featured on the Norwegian band [[A-ha]]'s acoustic album ''[[MTV Unplugged – Summer Solstice]]'', singing "Scoundrel Days" and "The Killing Moon". The performance was recorded at [[Giske]] island in Norway in June 2017.
