'''Norman Joel Greenbaum''' (born November 20, 1942) is an American singer-songwriter. He is primarily known for writing and performing his 1969 song "[[Spirit in the Sky]]".

==Early life==
Greenbaum was born in [[Malden, Massachusetts]]. He was raised in an [[Orthodox Jewish]] household and attended [[Hebrew school]] at [[Congregation Beth Israel (Malden, Massachusetts)|Congregation Beth Israel]].<ref>Scott R. Benarde, ''Stars of David: Rock'n'roll's Jewish Stories'' ([[University Press of New England]], 2003), {{ISBN|978-1584653035}}, pp. 186–187. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XI4-VnSrEcAC&lpg=PA186&ots=W8HNrCSUHO&dq=%22Beth%20Israel%22%20malden%20synagogue&pg=PA186#v=onepage&q=%22Beth%20Israel%22%20malden%20synagogue&f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].</ref> His initial interest in music was sparked by Southern blues music and the folk music that was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He performed with various bands in high school and [[Musicology|studied music]] at [[Boston University]] for two years. In college he performed at local coffeehouses but eventually dropped out and moved to Los Angeles in 1965.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/24/fashion/24norman.html |title=A 'Spirit' From the '60s That Won't Die |first=Tom |last=McNichol |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 24, 2006}}</ref>

==Career==
In the late 1960s Norman Greenbaum was the leader and composer for [[Dr. West's Medicine Show and Junk Band]], which recorded the novelty hit "[[The Eggplant That Ate Chicago]]".<ref name="1966 Hot 100 singles">{{cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel|title=Top Pop Singles 1955–1999 |year=2000|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, WI|isbn=0-89820-139-X|page=183}}</ref> The group's psychedelic approach was too eccentric for mainstream show business; the group's name suggested a novelty or comedy act incorporating music.

Greenbaum went solo as a folk artist and submitted an original song, "[[Spirit in the Sky]]", to [[Reprise Records]]. His demonstration recording was a simple folk rendition, with Greenbaum accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. Reprise handed Greenbaum to staff producer [[Erik Jacobsen]], who radically rearranged the song for a new recording session. The updated version now had pulsing electric guitar, synthesized effects, gospel-styled backup singers, and an insistent rhythm accompanying Greenbaum, whose vocal was now double-tracked. Reprise released the record in late 1969, and it skyrocketed to #1 in almost all worldwide markets. It sold two million copies in 1969 and 1970,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Although "Spirit in the Sky" has a clear Christian theme, Greenbaum was and remains an observant Jew.<ref name="NYT">{{Citation

</ref> Greenbaum says he was inspired to write the song after watching country singers singing a song on television. In an interview Greenbaum stated that Western movies were the real inspiration for "Spirit in the Sky":<ref>{{cite web|first=Ray|last=Shasho|work=Classic Rock Music Reporter |title=Exclusive: Norman Greenbaum reveals the true origin of 'Spirit In The Sky'|url = http://www.classicrockmusicwriter.com/2011/12/exclusive-interview-norman-greenbaum.html |date=December 23, 2011 | access-date =October 17, 2018 }}</ref>

<blockquote>'''Norman Greenbaum:''' If you ask me what I based "Spirit in the Sky" on&nbsp;... what did we grow up watching? Westerns! These mean and nasty varmints get shot and they wanted to die with their boots on. So to me that was spiritual, they wanted to die with their boots on.<br />
'''Ray Shasho:''' So that was the trigger that got you to write the song?<br />
'''Norman Greenbaum:''' Yes. The song itself was simple, when you're writing a song you keep it simple of course. It wasn't like a Christian song of praise it was just a simple song. I had to use Christianity because I had to use something. But more important it wasn't the Jesus part, it was the spirit in the sky. Funny enough&nbsp;... I wanted to die with my boots on.</blockquote>
 
All of the accoutrements added to "Spirit in the Sky" in the recording studio made it impossible for Greenbaum to replicate the recording in live performances. His televised appearance on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]'' compelled the singer to synchronize his performance to a playback of the hit record.

Though Norman Greenbaum is generally regarded as a [[one-hit wonder]],<ref name="NYT" /><ref name="SB" /> he actually had two hits: the upbeat "Canned Ham" followed in 1970, and the record reached number 46 on the American charts and number 26 in the Canadian charts.

==Personal life==
Greenbaum has been a long-time resident of [[Santa Rosa, California]].<ref name="NYT" /> He was critically injured when the car in which he was a passenger made a left turn in the path of a motorcycle on Occidental Road on March 28, 2015, killing the motorcyclist and injuring the motorcycle passenger.<ref>[http://www.pressdemocrat.com/home/3728480-181/crash-west-of-santa-rosa "Crash west of Santa Rosa kills motorcyclist; singer Norman Greenbaum hospitalized"]. ''Press-Democrat''. March 28, 2015.</ref> Greenbaum has since gone back to performing.<ref>Freedman, Richard.
