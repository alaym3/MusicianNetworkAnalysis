'''Hadi''' or '''Hady''' ({{lang-ar|هادي}})  is an Arabic/Persian/Turkish/Urdu masculine given name.

Hadi comes from the Arabic [[triconsonantal]] root of {{script/Arabic|ه د ي}}. It is a name derived from the word [[Hidayah]] ({{lang-ar|هداية|Hidāyah}}).

Al-Hadi is one of the 99 [[Names of God in Islam]] meaning ''The Guider''.

Hadi ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <s>הֲדַסָּי‎</s>) also serves as a popular nickname for the [[Jews|Jewish]]/Hebrew feminine given name Hadassah <ins>(Hebrew: הֲדַסָּה‎)</ins>. This derives from [[Hadass]], which means [[Myrtaceae|myrtle tree]], one of the [[Seven Species|seven holy species]] in [[Judaism]]. 

However, it is most often used in honor of [[Esther|Queen Esther]], who was forced to change her name from Hadassah to a more acceptable name, [[Esther (given name)|Esther]] (meaning hidden/ concealed), in order to conceal her [[Jewish identity]].
