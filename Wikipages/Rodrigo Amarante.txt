'''Rodrigo Amarante de Castro Neves''' (born September 6, 1976) is a Brazilian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, composer and arranger. He is part of the bands [[Los Hermanos]], [[Orquestra Imperial]], and [[Little Joy]], and released his first solo record, ''[[Cavalo (album)|Cavalo]]'', in Brazil in late 2013 and worldwide in May 2014. He also wrote and performed the ([[bolero]] style) [[narcocorrido]] "[[Tuyo]]", the theme song for the [[Netflix]] Original Series ''[[Narcos]]'' (2015) and ''[[Narcos: Mexico]]'' (2018), and wrote the score for the film ''[[Entebbe (film)|Entebbe]]'' (2018).

==Biography==
==1997–2007: Los Hermanos==
Amarante was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He studied Journalism at [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]] ("PUC-Rio"), where he met [[Marcelo Camelo]] and [[Rodrigo Barba]]. After a few rehearsals with [[Los Hermanos]], Amarante was invited to join the band.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

On their debut album, ''Los Hermanos'' (1999), Amarante contributed very little, playing [[transverse flute]] and singing the backing vocals. There are only two songs written by him: "Quem Sabe", which turned out to be one of the CD's singles, and "Onze Dias".

On the band's second album, ''Bloco do Eu Sozinho'' (2001), Amarante was able to show his real musical quality, playing guitar together with Marcelo and writing more songs. He recorded "[[Sentimental (Los Hermanos song)|Sentimental]]" (considered by [[Dado Villa-Lobos]] from [[Legião Urbana]] to be the best song of 2001), "Retrato pra Iaiá", and "Cher Antoine" (sung in French). He also co-wrote with Marcelo "A Flor", one of the album's hits, and the instrumental part of the song "Mais Uma Canção".

With their third album, ''Ventura'' (2003), came Amarante's national recognition as a great songwriter; he wrote songs of indisputable quality,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} like "Último Romance", "O velho e o moço", "Um par", "Do Sétimo Andar", and "Deixa o Verão". His role as a sideman in the band ended, and he became recognized as one of the band's leaders, which role until then was attributed only to Marcelo Camelo.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

On the group's fourth album, ''4'' (2005), Amarante wrote almost as many songs as Marcelo. Although ''4'' did not have as much success as the previous album, Amarante's songs are much more distinguished,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} like "O Vento" – the only hit in this album – and "Condicional". He also wrote "Primeiro Andar", "Os Pássaros", and "Paquetá" ([[Paquetá Island|Paquetá]] is a small island in Rio de Janeiro).

In 2006, Amarante won the prize of "Best Instrumentalist" in the Prêmio Multishow (Multishow Awards).

In April 2007 the band announced they were going on hiatus, since 2009, the band has been gathering from years to years for concerts and musical tours.

==2002–2006: Orquestra Imperial==
After a hiatus from [[Los Hermanos]] (in 2007), Amarante dedicated himself to [[Orquestra Imperial]] (a band in which he plays with [[Moreno Veloso]] ([[Caetano Veloso]]'s son), Nina Becker, and the actress [[Thalma de Freitas]]) and went to California to record "Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon" with [[Devendra Banhart]]. There, he started writing songs with [[Fabrizio Moretti]] and [[Binki Shapiro]], a trio that would soon become [[Little Joy]].

==2006–2010: Little Joy==
In 2007, Amarante joined with [[The Strokes]] drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]] and American musician, singer, and songwriter [[Binki Shapiro]] to form the trio [[Little Joy]], a Brazilian/American rock supergroup. Amarante and Moretti had met in 2006, at a festival in [[Lisbon, Portugal|Lisbon]] where both their bands were performing, and the idea came up to start a new musical project unrelated to their respective bands. When Amarante came to work in Los Angeles with [[Devendra Banhart]] on his 2007 album ''[[Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon]]'' they renewed the acquaintance and started making music, then Binki was brought on board. [[Little Joy]] was signed to [[Rough Trade Records]] label.

==2010–present: Solo works==
