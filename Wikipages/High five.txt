The '''high five''' is a [[hand gesture]] that occurs when two people simultaneously raise one hand each, about head-high, and push, slide, or slap the flat of their palm against the flat palm of the other person. The gesture is often preceded verbally by a phrase like "Give me five", "High five", "Up high", or "Slap hands." Its meaning varies with the context of use but can include as a greeting, congratulations, or celebration.

There are many origin stories of the high five,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.outsports.com/2013/2/26/4034108/the-man-who-invented-the-high-five |title=The Man Who Invented the High-Five |work=The Diamond Angle |agency=Outsports.com (2003) |author=Bob Brigham |date=1995 |access-date=July 25, 2014}}</ref> but the two most documented candidates are [[Dusty Baker]] and [[Glenn Burke]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] professional baseball team on October 2, 1977, and [[Wiley Brown]] and [[Derek Smith (basketball)|Derek Smith]] of the [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]] men's college basketball team during the 1978–1979 season.<ref name=mooallem/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2012/04/19/gay-history-high-five|title=The Gay History of the High Five|date=2012-04-19|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en}}</ref>

==Origin==
[[File:9TH Drew Storen and Wilson Ramos.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The gesture might have originated in American professional sports. Photo of [[Drew Storen]] (right) and [[Wilson Ramos]] of the [[Washington Nationals]] in 2011.]]
The use of the phrase as a noun has been part of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 1980 and as a verb since 1981.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606045455/http://highfive.me.uk/history/|archive-date=June 6, 2014|url=http://www.highfive.me.uk/history/ |title=High Five Me web site |publisher=Highfive.me.uk |access-date=2013-02-04}}</ref> The phrase is related to the slang "give me five" which is a request for some form of handshake – variations include "slap me five", "slip me five", "give me (some) skin" – with "five" referring to the number of fingers on a hand.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions (4th Ed) |author=Richard A. Spears |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref> The "high five" originated from the "[[low five]]", which has been a part of African-American culture since the 1920s.<ref name=mooallem/> It's probably impossible to know exactly when the low first transitioned to a high, but there are many theories about its inception.<ref name=mooallem/> [[Magic Johnson]] once suggested that he invented the high five at Michigan State, presumably in the late 1970s. Others have suggested it originated in the women's volleyball circuit of the 1960s.<ref name=mooallem/>

===Glenn Burke and Dusty Baker===
For decades, the "[[conventional<!--this is a direct quote from the source--> wisdom]]"<ref name=mooallem/> has been that the origin of the high five occurred between [[Dusty Baker]] and [[Glenn Burke]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at [[Dodger Stadium]] on October 2, 1977, the last day of the regular season.<ref name=mooallem/> In the sixth inning, Dusty Baker hit a [[home run]] off [[Houston Astros]] pitcher [[J. R. Richard]]. It was Baker's 30th home run, making the Dodgers the first team in history to have four hitters with at least 30 home runs each in a single season.<ref name="LAT1977">{{cite news | first=Ross | last=Newhan | title=The Gang of Four: Garvey. ... 33 Smith ..... 32 Cey ... ... 30 Baker. ... . 30| work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=3 October 1977 }}</ref> As journalist Jon Mooallem tells the story:

{{quote|It was a wild, triumphant moment and a good omen as the Dodgers headed to the playoffs. Burke, waiting on deck, thrust his hand enthusiastically over his head to greet his friend at the plate. Baker, not knowing what to do, smacked it. "His hand was up in the air, and he was arching way back," says Baker ... "So I reached up and hit his hand. It seemed like the thing to do."<ref name=mooallem/>}}

This story regarding the origin of the high five can be found in the written news as early as September 1982 and is featured in the [[ESPN]] ''[[30 for 30]]'' film ''The High Five'' directed by Michael Jacobs.<ref name="LAT1982">{{cite news | first=Randy | last=Harvey | title=Tired of Torment, Burke Searches for Inner Peace| work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=18 September 1982 }}</ref> After retiring from baseball, Burke, who was one of the first openly gay professional athletes, used the high five with other gay residents of the [[Castro district]] of [[San Francisco]], where for many it became a symbol of [[gay pride]] and identification.<ref name=mooallem/>

===Louisville Cardinals===
Another origin story, first reported in 1980,<ref>{{cite news | first=Jim | last=Benagh | title=SportsWorld specials; Shake, shake, shake| work=The New York Times | date=1 September 1980 }}</ref> places it at a [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|University of Louisville Cardinals]] basketball practice during the 1978–1979 season.<ref name=mooallem/> Forward [[Wiley Brown]] went to give a low five to his teammate [[Derek Smith (basketball)|Derek Smith]], but suddenly Smith looked Brown in the eye and said, "No. Up high." Brown thought, "Yeah, why are we staying down low? We jump so high," raised his hand and the high five was supposedly born.<ref name=mooallem/> High fives can be seen in highlight reels of the 1978–1979 Louisville team.<ref name=mooallem/> During a telecast of a 1980 game, announcer [[Al McGuire]] shouted: "Mr. Brown came to play! And they're giving him the high-five handshake. High five!"<ref name=mooallem/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAedMTg1ApQ&t=3609 Louisville vs UCLA 1980 NCAA Championship at 1:00:09], [[YouTube]], Uploaded on April 5, 2013.

===Hoax origin claimed by comedy writers===
In a 2007 press release, two comedy writers and founders of the "National High Five Day" claimed that a late 1970s and early '80s basketball player from Murray State University had invented the gesture.  They also concocted an elaborate and involved story about this player as a young boy learning the gesture from his father.  But in a 2013 ''ESPN'' article, the pair admitted that it had been a publicity stunt.  Per the article, the two had "scoured college basketball rosters to plug in a name."<ref name=mooallem>Jon Mooallem. [http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/6813042/who-invented-high-five "The history and mystery of the high five"], [[ESPN]], 29 July 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalhighfiveproject.org/ |title=National High Five Project |publisher=National High Five Project |access-date=2013-02-04}}</ref>

===Antecedents===
Antecedents of the physical gesture of slapping palms together predate the 1970s,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mubi.com/topics/first-high-five-in-cinema-history |title=First high five in cinema history? |work=Mubi.com |access-date=July 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053607/https://mubi.com/topics/first-high-five-in-cinema-history |archive-date=August 8, 2014 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metafilter.com/141291/Inventor-of-the-high-five |title=Inventor of the high five |work=[[MetaFilter]] |date=July 25, 2014 |access-date=July 30, 2014}} See comments for links to further examples.</ref> when the high five is believed to have been coined. For example, it can be seen in the 1960 French [[Nouvelle vague]] movie ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]''.<ref>''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' at 1 hour, 14 minutes, and 23 seconds when two men part ways.</ref> These earlier cases were never called "high fives," however, because the term had not yet been coined and they lacked the cultural context and meaning surrounding the gesture that originated in the United States during the late 1970s and 1980s independent of usage elsewhere.<ref name=mooallem/>

[[Conventional wisdom]] holds that the Tokyo district of [[Roppongi]] earned the slogan of "High Touch Town" after residents noticed World War II American GIs walking the streets giving each other high-fives; when the Japanese asked about the gesture it was mistranslated as ''hai tatchi'' or "high touch".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcxCCh7sGA4C&q=%22High+Touch+Town%22&pg=PA76 |title=People Who Eat Darkness: The True Story of a Young Woman Who Vanished from the Streets of Tokyo |publisher=Macmillan |author=Richard Lloyd Parry |year=2012 |page=76 |access-date=July 28, 2014|isbn=9780374230593 }}</ref> This story is possibly [[apocryphal]], as Hiroyuki Usui, a representative of the Roppongi Shopkeepers Promotion Association explains, "There is no deep meaning in 'High Touch Town'. People don't know what it means." The term "high touch town" may have originated before the high five and had a different meaning, or 'high touch' may mean "high class", a play on the town's reputation for nightlife activity among off-duty military personnel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2008/08/20/high-brow-trumps-high-touch-in-roppongi/ |title=High brow trumps 'High Touch' in Roppongi |publisher=[[Tokyo Reporter]] |date=August 20, 2008 |access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

==Variations==
In addition to the classic high five several other types of high five exist.

If one initiates a high five (or any variation thereof) by offering a hand(s), and no reciprocal hand appears to consummate the gesture, the initiator is said to have been "[[commons:File:NASA-HighFive-LeftHanging.ogg|left hanging]]".<ref>Neil Pasricha. ''The Book of Awesome'', Penguin, 2010. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3i5aTZIlpR0C&pg=PT206 p. 206].</ref> This could be interpreted as an insult, friendly joke or form of enlightenment, depending on the context of its use.

Another variation is the "self high five." The action consists of raising one hand, generally the right hand, and tagging it with the other. It was often used by [[Diamond Dallas Page]] as part of his persona, such as in his WCW theme song "Self High Five."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCwD_0ChWv0 Diamond Dallas Page WCW Theme "Self High Five" | TNLWrestling.com], [[YouTube]], Uploaded by TNLWrestling on Oct 22, 2011. Last accessed April 2012.</ref> A variation of this variation was explored by Turkish artist Deniz Ozuygur who built a "Self High-five Machine," which was exhibited in New York City in 2010. It is a robotic arm that spins in circles striking another robotic arm, both of which are rubber casts of Ozuygur's own arms.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824113553/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-07/19/self-high-five-machine |archive-date=August 24, 2010 |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-07/19/self-high-five-machine |title=Never get left hanging with the Self High-five Machine |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |author=Duncan Geere |date=July 19, 2010 |access-date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>

A hand grab is when one or both parties grab and hold, sometimes even shaking around the opposing parties hand while still up high. The variation can be used to indicate friendship and/or personal swagger.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/national-high-five-day/18/ |title=How to celebrate National High Five Day: Grab the other person's hand afterwards |work=CBS News |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name="NASA" />  A two-handed high five is as the name suggests the same as a high five but two handed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/national-high-five-day/21/ |title=How to celebrate National High Five Day: Use both hands |work=CBS News |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name="NASA" /> A back end is when a normal high is followed through by swinging the arms around to slap together down low.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/national-high-five-day/24/ |title=How to celebrate National High Five Day: Follow through on the back end |work=CBS News |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref> Some will pass through a gauntlet while giving two hand high fives through a line of people.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/national-high-five-day/10/ |title=How to celebrate National High Five Day: Run down a whole line of high fives |work=CBS News |access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref>

===Too slow===
The "too slow" variation is a sequence of high five and low five, often accompanied by a rhyme such as "Up High. Down Low ..."<ref name=weinraub/><ref name=mightbegiants>[http://www.songlyrics.com/they-might-be-giants/high-five-lyrics/ "High Five!"], a song by [[They Might Be Giants]] from the album ''[[Here Come the 123s]]'' (2008).</ref> then, during the down low sequence, the initiator will surprise the counter-party by pulling their hand back at the last moment, thus tricking the other person into swiping at empty air, completing the rhyme with "Too slow!" <ref>Robison, Jim. "Handshakes Complicate Simple Greetings." [[Orlando Sentinel]], 1985-09-15, p. 6.</ref> There are variations on this theme, with additions of "to the side" and other hand positions for the partner to contact the initiator's hand.<ref>Elizabeth Tucker. ''Children's Folklore: A Handbook'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7WVaMZAu2PEC&pg=PA55 p. 55]</ref>

The origin of the too slow variation has not been established, but notable sources have made reference to it; for example a 1983 journal is quoted as saying, "Whether we hammer, or hoe, whoop or holler, as they say, slap five up high, down low, you're too slow, we do it with the rhythmic motif that leads to harmony."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Too slow |journal=[[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]] |date=1983 |volume=15-16 |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBB9AAAAMAAJ }}</ref> The title song for ''Lay on Five'', a [[List of BBC children's television programmes|BBC children's television programme]] broadcast in 1985–86 featuring [[Floella Benjamin]], ended "..too slow to Lay on Five."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/9781|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528122245/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/9781|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 May 2009|title=Lay on Five|work=Film & TV Database|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|access-date=5 May 2012}}</ref> The too slow variation is in the 1987 film ''[[The Principal]]'' in a scene where Principal Rick Latimer ([[James Belushi]]) does it to Arturo Diego ([[Jacob Vargas]]).<ref>The too slow variation is in the official trailer of ''[[The Principal]]'' at 1 min 40 seconds. {{YouTube|id=8760ji7Ax1k|title=The Principal trailer}}</ref> In the ''New York Times'' archives, the earliest reference is from 1993 when [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] did it with the son of a film-crew member while on the set of ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', saying: "Let's have five. Five high. Five low," at which point Schwarzenegger pulled his hand away saying "Too slow." The boy reportedly laughed.<ref name=weinraub>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/04/garden/on-the-set-with-arnold-schwarzenegger-big-guy-big-star-big-deal-baby.html "ON THE SET WITH – Arnold Schwarzenegger; Big Guy. Big Star. Big Deal, Baby."], Bernard Weinraub, ''The New York Times'', March 4, 1993.</ref> Schwarzenegger did it originally in the 1991 film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', when John Connor ([[Edward Furlong]]) teaches the Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to "Gimme five. Up high, down low, too slow."<ref>''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991).</ref> In 2008, [[They Might Be Giants]] released the song "High Five!" on an album for children titled ''[[Here Come the 123s]]'', with lyrics "High five! Low five! Slap me five! Down low! Too slow!," a gesture described in the song as "old school"<ref>[http://www.lyricsmania.com/high_five!_lyrics_they_might_be_giants.html High Five!], lyrics</ref> a slang term usually meaning something from a prior generation.<ref>See "old school," ''The Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English'', Routledge, 2008. p. 713. {{ISBN|978-0-415-37182-7}}</ref>

The rhyme bears a striking resemblance to a very old rhyme, possibly medieval, used by blacksmiths to teach apprentices how to best operate a bellows in a way that maximized its efficiency by opening it fully and quickly, while closing it slowly. The didactic rhyme is "Up high. Down low. Up quick. Down slow; And that's the way to blow."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.harpenden-history.org.uk/page_id__111.aspx?path=0p2p46p |title=Rhymes from Hertfordshire |work=harpenden-history.org.uk |author=R.

===Air five===
[[File:HFE Air Five.JPG|thumb|Two women engaging in an air five]]
An air five is a variation where the hands of the participants never actually touch, needing only line of sight to make the gesture.<ref>Torbjörn Lundmark. ''Tales of Hi and Bye: Greeting and Parting Rituals Around the World'', Cambridge University Press, 2009. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VgCRU2PEAawC&pg=PA73 p. 73]</ref> It has an advantage for participants who are otherwise too far apart to achieve physical contact at the moment of the gesture. The participants may simply pretend to high five, or add an imitation sound of hand slapping. Also known as the ''wi-five'', a mix of "wireless" and "high five" with a pun on [[Wi-Fi|wi-fi]], a wireless computer technology.<ref>Aaron Peckham.

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the high-five was "singled out, stigmatized and fraught with anxiety", replaced by gestures such as knocking elbows, tapping forearms, clicking cleats. For example, college conferences banned the high-five; the Yankees informally resolved to bump elbows instead of slapping hands; the Minnesota Twins  banned physical contact with fans. Outside of sports, individuals reported avoiding the high-five in their daily lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/sports/basketball/coronavirus-high-five.html |title=In Coronavirus Outbreak, the High-Five Is Left Hanging |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Andrew Keh |date=March 13, 2020 |accessdate=September 8, 2021}}</ref> Dusty Baker, the presumed originator of the gesture, advocated for contactless high-fives.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29200202/has-coronavirus-ruined-high-five |title=Has the coronavirus ruined the high-five? |work=ESPN |author=Kelly Cohen |date=May 22, 2020 |accessdate=September 9, 2021}}</ref>
