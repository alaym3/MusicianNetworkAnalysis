'''Robert Hunter Caldwell''' (born August 15, 1951) is an American singer and songwriter who recorded the hit single "[[What You Won't Do for Love (song)|What You Won't Do for Love]]" in 1978. After several R&B and smooth jazz albums, Caldwell turned to singing standards from the [[Great American Songbook]].

==Career==
Bobby Caldwell was born in Manhattan,<ref name="Ankeny">{{cite web|last1=Ankeny|first1=Jason|title=Bobby Caldwell|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-caldwell-mn0000061045/biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=July 12, 2017}}</ref> but grew up in Miami. His mother sold real estate and one of her clients was reggae singer [[Bob Marley]]; Caldwell and Marley became friends. Growing up in Miami exposed Caldwell to a variety of music such as Haitian, Latin, reggae and R&B.<ref name="Gordon">{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Ed|title=Bobby Caldwell: 'Perfect Island Nights'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4657970|website=NPR.org|access-date=November 10, 2017|language=en|date=May 19, 2005}}</ref> He grew up listening to the music of [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]].<ref name="Smiley">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/singersongwriter-bobby-caldwell/|title=Singer/Songwriter Bobby Caldwell|website=[[PBS]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623053425/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/singersongwriter-bobby-caldwell/|archive-date=June 23, 2015}}</ref>
When he was 12, Caldwell started playing piano and guitar. He was drawn to rock and roll, jazz and rhythm and blues. At 17, he worked with his band in Las Vegas, then moved to Los Angeles.<ref name="Ankeny" /> He was a member of a Miami band called Katmandu who wrote much of their material while also performing traditional standards. Caldwell played multiple instruments and sang.

He signed with [[TK Records]] in Miami. In 1978, after songs for his first album were recorded, executives told Caldwell they enjoyed the album, but thought it was lacking a hit. Caldwell returned to the studio for two days and wrote "[[What You Won't Do for Love (song)|What You Won't Do for Love]]". TK was mainly an R&B label popular among African American listeners. Executives at the label wanted to conceal the fact that Caldwell was white, so they kept his face off the album cover. When he toured with [[Natalie Cole]] to support the album, most of the audience was black and many were surprised that Caldwell was white.<ref name="Gordon"/><ref name="Smiley"/>

"What You Won't Do for Love" reached the top ten on the ''Billboard'' magazine Pop (No. 9)<ref name="Pop">{{cite news|title=What You Won't Do For Love Chart History|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/bobby-caldwell/chart-history/hot-100/song/336181| work=Billboard| access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref> R&B (No. 6), and Adult Contemporary (No. 10) charts. The song has been covered, remade and [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] many times. Caldwell remade it in 1998. It was covered by [[Go West (band)|Go West]], [[Phyllis Hyman]], and [[Boyz II Men]] and was sampled by [[Tupac Shakur]]. It was covered by [[Elliott Yamin]] during the [[American Idol (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2006. The 1980 track "Open Your Eyes" was sampled by [[J Dilla]] on [[Common (rapper)|Common]]'s "[[The Light (Common song)|The Light]]" from his 2000 album "[[Like Water for Chocolate (album)|Like Water For Chocolate]]".<ref name="Okayplayer">{{cite web| title=Tawiah Covers Bobby Caldwell's "Open Your Eyes"|url=https://www.okayplayer.com/news/tawiah-covers-bobby-caldwells-the-light-video.html|website=okayplayer.com}}</ref>

Caldwell's debut album was followed by ''Cat in the Hat'' (1980) and ''Carry On'' (1982). For the latter album, Caldwell played all the instruments, was the producer and helped with arranging and mixing.<ref name="Wynn">{{cite web|last1=Wynn|first1=Ron|title=Carry On|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/carry-on-mw0000197262|website=AllMusic|access-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref> In 1983, Caldwell released ''August Moon'' only in Japan. It was released in the United States in the 1990s.

Singer [[Boz Scaggs]] advised Caldwell to write songs for other musicians after TK Records shut down. Caldwell wrote "[[The Next Time I Fall]]", which became a hit for [[Amy Grant]] and [[Peter Cetera]],<ref name="Appleford">{{cite web| last1=Appleford|first1=Steve| title=Writing Hits Not Enough for Singer Caldwell|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-06/entertainment/ca-457_1_bobby-caldwell|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 10, 2017|date=October 6, 1991}}</ref> and songs for [[Roy Ayers]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], Natalie Cole, [[Neil Diamond]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Al Jarreau]] and Boz Scaggs.<ref name="Leight">{{cite web|last1=Leight|first1=Elias|title=Cool Uncle: Inside 2015's Smartest Retro-Soul Revival|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/cool-uncle-inside-2015s-smartest-retro-soul-revival-20151118|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=November 10, 2017|date=November 18, 2015}}</ref>

On ''Blue Condition'' (1996), Caldwell turned from R&B to recording [[big band]] arrangements of songs from the [[Great American Songbook]], particularly those sung by [[Frank Sinatra]]. He also portrayed Sinatra in tributes to the [[Rat Pack]] in Las Vegas.<ref name="Smiley" /><ref name="Kohlhaase">{{cite web| last1=Kohlhaase| first1=Bill| title=Caldwell Goes Back a Bit and Does It Frank's Way|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/02/entertainment/ca-61774| website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 13, 2017|date=August 2, 1999}}</ref><ref name="Rizik">{{cite web|last1=Rizik| first1=Chris| title=Bobby Caldwell – After Dark (2014) (Review)|url=https://www.soultracks.com/review-bobby-caldwell-after-dark| website=SoulTracks|access-date=November 13, 2017|date=December 9, 2014}}</ref> He continued to sing standards on ''Come Rain or Come Shine'' (1999), ''The Consummate Bobby Caldwell'' (2010) and ''After Dark'' (2014). In 2015, he collaborated with record producer [[Jack Splash]] on the album ''Cool Uncle''.<ref name="Leight" />

==Film soundtracks==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2021}}
Caldwell wrote and performed songs for the movies ''[[Back to School]]'' ("Educated Girl"), ''[[Mac and Me]]'' ("Take Me, I'll Follow You"), ''[[Salsa (1988 film)|Salsa]]'' ("Puerto Rico") and its sequel ("Every Teardrop"). He also recorded a song for the 1984 film [[Night of the Comet]] ("Never Give Up"). Due to what he has cited in interviews as a lower cost of use than the original recordings, his versions of big band standards have appeared in several films. Examples include ''[[Simone (2002 film)|Simone]]'' (2001) and ''Lake Boat'' (2002).

Aside from a minor role in 1988's ''Salsa'', Caldwell portrayed Frank Sinatra from October 1999 to January 2000 in the Las Vegas musical ''The Rat Pack is Back''.

==Japanese audience==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2021}}
Caldwell is [[big in Japan (phrase)|popular in Japan]], where he was nicknamed "Mister AOR". In Japan, the acronym "[[Album Oriented Rock|AOR]]"  (AOR short for "Adult Oriented Rock") is used to describe the style commonly called Adult Contemporary in the United States. In 1992, he received the award for Best Foreign Artist at the [[34th Japan Record Awards]].
