'''Giacomo Puccini'''{{refn|Full name: '''Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|dʒ|æ|k|ə|m|oʊ|_|p|ʊ|ˈ|tʃ|iː|n|i}} {{respell|JAK|ə|moh|_|puu|CHEE|nee}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|dʒ|ɑː|k|ə|m|oʊ|_|p|uː|ˈ|tʃ|iː|n|i}} {{respell|JAH|kə|moh|_|poo|CHEE|nee}}, {{IPA-it|ˈdʒaːkomo putˈtʃiːni|lang}}).|group=n}} (22 December 1858{{spaced ndash}} 29 November 1924) was an Italian [[composer]] known primarily for [[List of compositions by Giacomo Puccini#Operas|his operas]]. Regarded as the greatest{{sfn|Ravenni|Girardi|n.d.|loc=Introduction}} and most successful proponent of [[Italian opera]] after [[Verdi]], he was descended from a long line of composers, stemming to the late-[[Baroque music|Baroque]] era. Though his early work was firmly rooted in traditional late-19th-century [[Romantic music|Romantic]] Italian opera he later developed his work in the realistic ''[[verismo]]'' style, of which he became one of the leading exponents.

His most renowned works are ''[[La bohème]]'' (1896), ''[[Tosca]]'' (1900), ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' (1904), and ''[[Turandot]]'' (1924), all of which are among the most [[List of important operas|frequently performed]] and recorded of all operas.<!-- **doesn't work since late 2018 **{{refn|1=The website Operabase.com in its [http://operabase.com/top.cgi?lang=en& section on opera statistics 2007–2012] ranks Puccini, with 2294 performances of 13 operas, in third place behind Verdi (3020 performances of 29 operas) and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (2410 performances of 22 operas).

==Family and education==
[[File:PucciniBirthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|Puccini's birthplace, seen in 1984]]

Puccini was born Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini in [[Lucca]], Italy, in 1858. He was the sixth of nine children of Michele Puccini (1813–1864) and Albina Magi (1830–1884). The Puccini family was established in Lucca as a local musical dynasty by Puccini's great-great-grandfather – also named [[Jacopo Puccini|Giacomo]] (1712–1781).<ref name=Dry>{{harvnb|Dry|1905|p={{page needed|date=April 2020}}}}</ref><ref name=Puccini-it-Cathedral>{{cite web|title=Cattedrale di S. Martino|url=http://www.puccini.it/index.php?id=290|publisher=Centro di Studi Giacomo Puccini|access-date=3 November 2012}}</ref> This first Giacomo Puccini was ''maestro di cappella'' of the [[Lucca Cathedral|Cattedrale di San Martino]] in Lucca.<ref name=Gervasoni>{{harvnb|Gervasoni|1812|pages=240–241}}</ref> He was succeeded in this position by his son, Antonio Puccini,<ref name=Gervasoni /> and then by Antonio's son [[Domenico Puccini|Domenico]], and Domenico's son Michele (father of the subject of this article).<ref name=Dry /> Each of these men studied music at Bologna, and some took additional musical studies elsewhere.<ref name=Dry /><ref name=Gervasoni /> Domenico Puccini studied for a time under [[Giovanni Paisiello]].<ref name=Dry /> Each composed music for the church. In addition, Domenico composed several operas, and Michele composed one opera.<ref name=Dry /> Puccini's father Michele enjoyed a reputation throughout northern Italy, and his funeral was an occasion of public mourning, at which the then-famed composer [[Giovanni Pacini]] conducted a Requiem.{{sfn|Streatfeild|1895|page=269}}

With the Puccini family having occupied the position of ''maestro di cappella'' for 124 years (1740–1864) by the time of Michele's death, it was anticipated that Michele's son Giacomo would occupy that position as well when he was old enough.<ref name=Puccini-it-Cathedral /> However, when Michele Puccini died in 1864, his son Giacomo was only six years old, and thus not capable of taking over his father's job.<ref name=Dry /> As a child, he nevertheless participated in the musical life of the Cattedrale di San Martino, as a member of the boys' choir and later as a substitute organist.<ref name=Puccini-it-Cathedral />

Puccini was given a general education at the seminary of San Michele in Lucca, and then at the seminary of the cathedral.<ref name=Dry /> One of Puccini's uncles, Fortunato Magi, supervised his musical education. Puccini got a diploma from the Pacini School of Music in Lucca in 1880, having studied there with his uncle Fortunato, and later with Carlo Angeloni, who had also instructed [[Alfredo Catalani]]. A grant from [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]], and assistance from another uncle, Nicholas Cerù, provided the funds necessary for Puccini to continue his studies at the [[Milan Conservatory]],<ref name=Dry /><ref name=Streatfeild /> where he studied composition with [[Stefano Ronchetti-Monteviti]], [[Amilcare Ponchielli]], and [[Antonio Bazzini]]. Puccini studied at the conservatory for three years, sharing a room with [[Pietro Mascagni]]. In 1880, at the age of 21, Puccini composed his ''[[Messa (Puccini)|Mass]]'', which marks the culmination of his family's long association with [[church music]] in his native Lucca.{{refn|Although Puccini himself correctly titled the work a ''Messa'', referring to a setting of the Ordinary of the [[Catholic Mass]], today the work is popularly known as his ''Messa di Gloria'', a name that technically refers to a setting of only the first two prayers of the Ordinary, the [[Kyrie]] and the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], while omitting the [[Credo]], the [[Sanctus]], and the [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]].|group=n}}

==Early career and first operas==
Puccini wrote an orchestral piece called the ''Capriccio sinfonico'' as a thesis composition for the Milan Conservatory. Puccini's teachers Ponchielli and Bazzini were impressed by the work, and it was performed at a student concert at the conservatory on 14 July 1883, conducted by [[Franco Faccio]]. Puccini's work was favorably reviewed in the Milanese publication ''[[La Perseveranza]]'',<ref name=Dry /> and thus Puccini began to build a reputation as a young composer of promise in Milanese music circles.

===''Le Villi''===
After the premiere of the ''Capriccio sinfonico'', Ponchielli and Puccini discussed the possibility that Puccini's next work might be an opera. Ponchielli invited Puccini to stay at his villa, where Puccini was introduced to another young man named [[Ferdinando Fontana]].<ref name=Dry /> Puccini and Fontana agreed to collaborate on an opera, for which Fontana would provide the [[libretto]]. The work, ''[[Le Villi]]'', was entered into a competition sponsored by the Sozogno music publishing company in 1883 (the same competition in which [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' was the winner in 1889).<ref name=Dry /> Although it did not win, ''Le Villi'' was later staged at the [[Teatro Dal Verme]], premiering on 31 May 1884.<ref name=Dry /> [[Casa Ricordi|G. Ricordi & Co.]] music publishers assisted with the premier by printing the libretto without charge.<ref name=Dry /> Fellow students from the Milan Conservatory formed a large part of the orchestra.<ref name=Dry /> The performance was enough of a success that Casa Ricordi purchased the opera.<ref name=Dry /> Revised into a two-act version with an intermezzo between the acts, ''Le Villi'' was performed at [[La Scala]] in Milan, on 24 January 1885. However, Ricordi did not publish the score until 1887, hindering further performance of the work.<ref name=Dry />

===''Edgar''===
[[Giulio Ricordi]], head of [[Casa Ricordi|G. Ricordi & Co.]] music publishers, was sufficiently impressed with ''Le Villi'' and its young composer that he commissioned a second opera, which would result in ''[[Edgar (opera)|Edgar]]''. Work was begun in 1884 when Fontana began working out the scenario for the libretto.<ref name=Girardi /> Puccini finished primary composition in 1887 and orchestration in 1888.<ref name=Girardi>{{cite book|last=Girardi|first=Michele|title=Puccini:His International Art|year=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref> ''Edgar'' premiered at [[La Scala]] on 21 April 1889 to a lukewarm response.<ref name=Girardi /> The work was withdrawn for revisions after its third performance.<ref name=Girardi /> In a Milanese newspaper, Giulio Ricordi published a defense of Puccini's skill as a composer, while criticizing Fontana's libretto. A revised version met with success at the [[Teatro del Giglio]] in Puccini's native Lucca on 5 September 1891.<ref name=Girardi /> In 1892, further revisions reduced the length of the opera from four acts to three, in a version that was well received in Ferrara and was performed in Turin and in Spain.<ref name=Girardi /> Puccini made further revisions in 1901 and 1905, but the work never achieved popularity.<ref name=Girardi /> Without the personal support of Ricordi, ''Edgar'' might have cost Puccini his career. Puccini had eloped with his former piano student, the married Elvira Gemignani, and Ricordi's associates were willing to turn a blind eye to his lifestyle as long as he was successful. When ''Edgar'' failed, they suggested to Ricordi that he should drop Puccini, but Ricordi said that he would stay with him and continued his allowance until his next opera.{{sfn|Carner|1959|p=49}}

===''Manon Lescaut''===
On commencing his next opera, ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'', Puccini announced that he would write his own libretto so that "no fool of a librettist"{{sfn|Carner|1959|p={{page needed|date=June 2018}}}} could spoil it. Ricordi persuaded him to accept [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]] as his librettist, but Puccini soon asked Ricordi to remove him from the project. Four other librettists were then involved with the opera, as Puccini constantly changed his mind about the structure of the piece. It was almost by accident that the final two, [[Luigi Illica]] and [[Giuseppe Giacosa]], came together to complete the opera.

''Manon Lescaut'' premiered at the [[Teatro Regio (Turin)|Teatro Regio]] in Turin on 2 February 1893.<ref name="Night of Lescaut premiere">{{cite news|title=Arte e Scienze|newspaper=La Stampa|date=2 February 1893}}</ref> By coincidence, Puccini's first enduringly popular opera appeared within a week of the premiere of Verdi's last opera, ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', which was first performed on 9 February 1893.<ref name="Night of Lescaut premiere" /> In anticipation of the premiere, ''[[La Stampa]]'' wrote that Puccini was a young man concerning whom "great hopes" had a real basis ("{{lang|it|un giovane che e tra i pochi sul quale le larghe speranze non siano benigne illusioni}}").<ref name="Night of Lescaut premiere" /> Because of the failure of ''Edgar'', however, a failure of ''Manon Lescaut'' could have jeopardized Puccini's future as a composer. Although Giulio Ricordi, head of Casa Ricordi, was supportive of Puccini while ''Manon Lescaut'' was still in development, the Casa Ricordi board of directors was considering cutting off Puccini's financial support.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|2002|p=64}} In any event, "''Manon Lescaut'' was Puccini's first and only uncontested triumph, acclaimed by critics and public alike."<ref name=GroverOperas>{{harvnb|Sadie|Macy|2006|p={{page needed|date=August 2021}}}}</ref> After the London premiere in 1894, [[George Bernard Shaw]] pronounced: "Puccini looks to me more like the heir of Verdi than any of his rivals."<ref name=Budden>{{harvnb|Budden|2002|page=107}}</ref>

''Manon Lescaut'' was a great success and established Puccini's reputation as the most promising rising composer of his generation, and the most likely "successor" to Verdi as the leading exponent of the Italian operatic tradition.<ref name=Streatfeild>{{cite book|last=Streatfeild|first=R. A.|author-link=R A Streatfeild|title=The Opera|year=1897|publisher=John C. Nimmo|location=London}}</ref> Illica and Giacosa returned as librettists for Puccini for his next three operas, probably his greatest successes: ''[[La bohème]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'' and ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''.

==Middle career==
[[File:PucciniTosca.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Original poster for Puccini's ''[[Tosca]]'']]

===''La bohème''===
Puccini's next work after ''Manon Lescaut'' was ''[[La bohème]]'', a four-act opera based on the 1851 book by [[Henri Murger]], ''[[La Vie de Bohème]]''. ''La bohème'' premiered in [[Turin]] in 1896, conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]].{{sfn|Budden|2002|p=494}} Within a few years, it had been performed in many of the leading opera houses of Europe, including in Britain, as well as in the United States.<ref>{{Almanacco|match=La bohème|label=''La bohème''}}</ref> It was a popular success, and remains one of the most frequently performed operas ever written.

The libretto of the opera, freely adapted from Murger's episodic novel, combines comic elements of the impoverished life of the young protagonists with the tragic aspects, such as the death of the young seamstress Mimí. Puccini's own life as a young man in Milan served as a source of inspiration for elements of the libretto. During his years as a conservatory student and in the years before ''Manon Lescaut'', he experienced poverty similar to that of the bohemians in ''La bohème'', including chronic shortage of necessities like food, clothing and money to pay rent. Although Puccini was granted a small monthly stipend by the Congregation of Charity in Rome ({{lang|it|Congregazione di caritá}}), he frequently had to pawn his possessions to cover basic expenses.<ref name=Dry /><ref name="Nuova Antologia">{{harvnb|Checchi|1897|pages=470–81}}</ref> Early biographers such as Wakeling Dry and Eugenio Checchi, who were Puccini's contemporaries, drew express parallels between these incidents and particular events in the opera.<ref name=Dry /><ref name="Nuova Antologia" /> Checchi cited a diary kept by Puccini while he was still a student, which recorded an occasion in which, as in Act 4 of the opera, a single herring served as a dinner for four people.<ref name=Dry /><ref name="Nuova Antologia" /> Puccini himself commented: "I lived that ''Bohème'', when there wasn't yet any thought stirring in my brain of seeking the theme of an opera". ("{{lang|it|Quella Bohème io l'ho vissuta, quando ancora non mi mulinava nel cervello l'idea di cercarvi l'argomento per un'opera in musica.}}")<ref name="Nuova Antologia" />

Puccini's composition of ''La bohème'' was the subject of a public dispute between Puccini and fellow composer Ruggiero Leoncavallo. In early 1893, the two composers discovered that they were both engaged in writing operas based on Murger's work. Leoncavallo had started his work first, and he and his music publisher claimed to have "priority" on the subject (although Murger's work was in the public domain). Puccini responded that he started his own work without having any knowledge of Leoncavallo's project, and wrote: "Let him compose.  I will compose. The audience will decide."<ref name=Phillips-Matz /> Puccini's opera premiered a year before that of Leoncavallo, and has been a perennial audience favorite, while Leoncavallo's version quickly faded into obscurity.<ref name=Girardi />

===''Tosca''===
Puccini's next work after ''La bohème'' was ''[[Tosca]]'' (1900), arguably Puccini's first foray into ''[[verismo]]'', the realistic depiction of many facets of real life including violence. Puccini had been considering an opera on this theme since he saw the play ''Tosca'' by [[Victorien Sardou]] in 1889, when he wrote to his publisher, [[Giulio Ricordi]], begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: "I see in this ''Tosca'' the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music."{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|2002|pp=106–107}}
[[File:Puccini7.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Puccini photographed in 1908]]

The music of ''Tosca'' employs musical signatures for particular characters and emotions, which have been compared to Wagnerian leitmotivs, and some contemporaries saw Puccini as thereby adopting a new musical style influenced by [[Richard Wagner]]. Others viewed the work differently. Rejecting the allegation that ''Tosca'' displayed Wagnerian influences, a critic reporting on the Torino premiere of 20 February 1900 wrote: "I don't think you could find a more Puccinian score than this."<ref>{{cite news|title=La prima della Tosca del M. Puccini al Teatro Regio|newspaper=[[La Stampa]]|date=21 February 1900|language=it}}</ref>

===Automobile crash and near death===
On 25 February 1903, Puccini was seriously injured in a car crash during a nighttime journey on the road from Lucca to [[Torre del Lago]]. The car was driven by Puccini's chauffeur and was carrying Puccini, his future wife Elvira, and their son Antonio. It went off the road, fell several metres, and flipped over. Elvira and Antonio were flung from the car and escaped with minor injuries. Puccini's chauffeur, also thrown from the car, suffered a serious fracture of his femur. Puccini was pinned under the vehicle, with a severe fracture of his right leg and with a portion of the car pressing down on his chest. A doctor living near the scene of the crash, together with another person who came to investigate, saved Puccini from the wreckage.<ref>{{cite news|title=Una disgrazia automobilistica al maestro Puccini|newspaper=La Stampa|date=27 February 1903}}</ref> The injury did not heal well, and Puccini remained under treatment for months. During the medical examinations that he underwent it was also found that he was suffering from a form of diabetes.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|2002|p=123}} The accident and its consequences slowed Puccini's completion of his next work, ''Madama Butterfly''.

===''Madama Butterfly''===
The original version of ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' premiered at [[La Scala]] on 17 February 1904 with [[Rosina Storchio]] in the title role. It was initially greeted with great hostility (probably largely owing to inadequate rehearsals). When Storchio's [[kimono]] accidentally lifted during the performance, some in the audience started shouting: "The butterfly is pregnant" and "There is the little Toscanini". The latter comment referred to her well publicised affair with [[Arturo Toscanini]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Puccini: Madama Butterfly|url = http://www.columbia.edu/itc/music/NYCO/butterfly/fiasco.html|website = www.columbia.edu|access-date = 13 November 2015}}</ref> This version was in two acts;<ref>Version 1 (Milan, 1904). (403 pp) [[Casa Ricordi|G. Ricordi & C.]]: Milano – Roma – Napoli – Palermo – Parigi – Londra – Lipsia. New York: [[Boosey & Hawkes|Boosey & Co.]] Buenos Aires: Breyer Hermanos. This version was withdrawn after the opening night. See [http://opera.stanford.edu/Puccini/Butterfly/libretto.html Version History]</ref> after its disastrous premiere, Puccini withdrew the opera, revising it for what was virtually a second premiere at Brescia in May 1904{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|2002|p=146}} and performances in Buenos Aires, London, the US and Paris. In 1907, Puccini made his final revisions to the opera in a fifth version,<ref>Version 5, the "Standard Version". (266 pp) 1907 G. Ricordi & C.: New York – Milan – Rome – Naples – Palermo – London – Paris – Leipsig – Buenos Ayres – S. Paulo. See [http://opera.stanford.edu/Puccini/Butterfly/libretto.html Version History]</ref> which has become known as the "standard version". Today, the standard version of the opera is the version most often performed around the world. However, the original 1904 version is occasionally performed as well, and has been recorded.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Davis|first=Peter|author-link=Peter G. Davis|title=Selling Old Scores|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=20 January 1997|volume=30|issue=2}}</ref>

==Later works==
[[File:Arturo Toscanini and Giacomo Puccini 1910.jpg|alt=Giacomo Puccini with conductor Arturo Toscanini|thumb|Giacomo Puccini with conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]]]]
After 1904, Puccini's compositions were less frequent. In 1906 Giacosa died and, in 1909, there was scandal after Puccini's wife, Elvira, falsely accused their maid Doria Manfredi of having an affair with Puccini. Finally, in 1912, the death of Giulio Ricordi, Puccini's editor and publisher, ended a productive period of his career.

===''La fanciulla del West''===
[[File:Giacomo Puccini.jpg|thumb|Puccini in 1910|200px]]
Puccini completed ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'', based on a play by [[David Belasco]], in 1910. This was commissioned by, and first performed at, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York on 10 December 1910 with Met stars [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Emmy Destinn]] for whom Puccini created the leading roles of Dick Johnson and Minnie. Toscanini, then the musical director of the Met, conducted.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=544}} This was the first world premiere of an opera at the Met.{{sfn|Randall|Davis|2005|p=42}} The premiere was a great success.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=New York Acclaims Puccini's New Opera|magazine=Theatre Magazine|date=January 1911|volume=13|issue=119}}</ref> However, the compositional style employed in the opera, with few stand-alone arias, was criticized at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Stage|magazine=[[Munsey's Magazine]]|year=1911|volume=44|page=6}}</ref> Some contemporaries also criticized the opera for failing to achieve an "American" tone.{{sfn|Eaton|1911}}<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Hampton's Magazine|date=March 1911|volume=26|issue=3| title=Plays and Players|page=364|quote=In Puccini's ''Girl of the Golden West'' we get a highly amusing operatic picture of what did not take place in California in '49.}}</ref> However, the opera has been acclaimed for its incorporation of advanced harmonic language and rhythmic complexity into the Italian operatic form.{{sfn|Siff|2012}} In addition, one aria from the opera, ''[[Ch'ella mi creda]]'', has become a staple of compilation albums by operatic tenors. It is said that during [[World War I]], Italian soldiers sang this aria to maintain their spirits.<ref name=GroverOperas />{{sfn|Osborne|1982|page=195}}}} The 2008 Italian film, ''Puccini e la fanciulla'' (''Puccini and the Girl''), is based on the period of his life when he was composing the opera.

===''La rondine''===
Puccini completed the score of ''[[La rondine]]'', to a libretto by [[Giuseppe Adami]] in 1916 after two years of work, and it was premiered at the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo|Grand Théâtre de Monte Carlo]] on 27 March 1917. The opera had been originally commissioned by Vienna's [[Carltheater]]; however, the outbreak of [[World War I]] prevented the premiere from being given there. Moreover, the firm of Ricordi had declined the score of the opera&nbsp;– Giulio Ricordi's son Tito was then in charge and he described the opera as "bad [[Franz Lehár|Lehár]]".{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|2002|p=245}} It was taken up by their rival, Lorenzo Sonzogno, who arranged the first performance in neutral [[Monaco]].<ref>Gavin Plumley, "Puccini's Bittersweet Operetta", San Francisco Opera program, Nov/Dec 2007, pp. 30–31</ref> The composer continued to work at revising this, the least known of his mature operas, until his death.

''La rondine'' was initially conceived as an operetta, but Puccini eliminated spoken dialogue, rendering the work closer in form to an opera. A modern reviewer described ''La rondine'' as "a continuous fabric of lilting waltz tunes, catchy pop-styled melodies, and nostalgic love music," while characterizing the plot as recycling characters and incidents from works like 'La traviata' and 'Die Fledermaus'.<ref name=PucciniMitSchlag>{{cite magazine|last=Davis|first=Peter G.|author-link=Peter G. Davis|title=Puccini Mit Schlag|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=3 September 1984|volume=17|issue=35}}</ref>

===''Il trittico'': ''Il tabarro'', ''Suor Angelica'', and ''Gianni Schicchi''===
In 1918, ''[[Il trittico]]'' premiered in New York. This work is composed of three one-act operas, each concerning the concealment of a death: a horrific episode (''[[Il tabarro]]'') in the style of the Parisian [[Grand Guignol]], a sentimental tragedy (''[[Suor Angelica]]''), and a comedy (''[[Gianni Schicchi]]'').

===''Turandot''===
''[[Turandot]]'', Puccini's final opera, was left unfinished at the composer's death in November 1924, and the last two scenes were completed by [[Franco Alfano]] based on the composer's sketches. The libretto for ''Turandot'' was based on a play of the same name by [[Carlo Gozzi]].{{sfn|Ashbrook|Powers|1991|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=srFzafqtePIC&pg=PA43 43]}} The music of the opera is heavily inflected with [[pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] motifs, intended to produce an Asiatic flavor to the music. ''Turandot'' contains a number of memorable stand-alone arias, among them ''[[Nessun dorma]]''.

==Puccini and his librettists==
The libretto of ''Edgar'' was a significant factor in the failure of that opera. Thereafter, especially throughout his middle and late career, Puccini was extremely selective, and at times indecisive, in his choice of subject matter for new works.<ref name=Girardi /> Puccini was deeply involved in the process of writing the libretto itself, requiring many iterative revisions of his libretti in terms of both structure and text. Puccini's relationships with his librettists were at times very difficult. His publisher, Casa Ricordi, was frequently required to mediate disputes and impasses between them.<ref name="Phillips-Matz">{{harvnb|Phillips-Matz|2002|p={{page needed|date=April 2020}}}}</ref>

Puccini explored many possible subjects that he ultimately rejected only after a significant amount of effort—such as the creation of a libretto—had been put into them.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|2002|loc=''passim''}} Among the subjects that Puccini seriously considered, but abandoned, were: ''Cristoforo Sly'', ''Anima Allegra'' (based on the play ''El genio alegre'' by Serafín and Joaquín Álvarez Quintero), ''Two Little Wooden Shoes'' (''I due zoccoletti'') (a short story by Maria Louise Ramé, a.k.a. [[Ouida]]), the life of [[Marie Antoinette]], Margherita da Cortona, and ''Conchita'' (based on the novel ''La Femme et le pantin'' – ''The Woman and the Puppet'', by Pierre Loüys).<ref name="Phillips-Matz" /> Some of these abandoned subjects were taken up and turned into operas by other composers. For example, [[Franco Vittadini]] made an opera of ''Anima Allegra'', Mascagni's opera ''Lodoletta'' is derived from ''Two Little Wooden Shoes'', and [[Riccardo Zandonai]] eventually wrote ''[[Conchita (opera)|Conchita]]''.<ref name="Phillips-Matz" />

==Puccini at Torre del Lago==
[[File:III Torre del Lago, Italy 3 (2).jpg|thumb|Torre del Lago, Italy, Villa Puccini]]From 1891 onwards, Puccini spent most of his time, when not traveling on business, at [[Torre del Lago]], a small community about fifteen miles from Lucca situated between the Ligurian Sea and [[Lake Massaciuccoli]], just south of [[Viareggio]]. Torre del Lago was the primary place for Puccini to indulge his love of hunting. "I love hunting, I love cars: and for these things, in the isolation of Torre del Lago, I keep the faith." ("Amo la caccia, adoro l'automobile: e a questo e a quella nelle solitudini di Torre del Lago serbo intera la mia fede.")<ref>{{cite news|last=Villante|first=Luigi Alberto|title=I progetti di Giacomo Puccini|newspaper=[[La Stampa]]|date=11 February 1905|volume=39|issue=42|language=it}}</ref>

By 1900, he had acquired land and built a villa on the lake, now known as the "Villa Museo Puccini". He lived there until 1921, when pollution produced by peat works on the lake forced him to move to Viareggio, a few kilometres north. After his death, a [[mausoleum]] was created in the Villa Puccini and the composer is buried there in the chapel, along with his wife and son who died later.

The Villa Museo was owned by his granddaughter, [[Simonetta Puccini]], until her death, and is open to the public. An annual [[Festival Puccini]] is held at Torre del Lago.

==Marriage and affairs==
[[File:Elvira Puccini, Giacomo Puccini, Antonio Puccini (1900) - Archivio storico Ricordi FOTO002876.jpg|thumb|Puccini with his wife Elvira and son Antonio, 1900]]
In the autumn of 1884, Puccini began a relationship with a married woman named Elvira Gemignani (née Bonturi, 1860–1930) in Lucca. Elvira's husband, Narciso Gemignani, was an "unrepentant womanizer", and Elvira's marriage was not a happy one.<ref name=Girardi /> Elvira became pregnant by Puccini, and their son, Antonio (1886–1946), was born in Monza. Elvira left Lucca when the pregnancy began to show, and gave birth elsewhere to avoid gossip.<ref name=Girardi /> Elvira, Antonio and Elvira's daughter by Narciso, Fosca (1880–1968), began to live with Puccini shortly afterwards. Narciso was killed by the husband of a woman that Narciso had an affair with, dying on 26 February 1903, one day after [[#Automobile accident and near death|Puccini's car accident]].<ref name=Girardi /> Only then, in early 1904, were Puccini and Elvira able to marry, and to legitimize Antonio.

The marriage between Puccini and Elvira was also troubled by infidelity, as Puccini had frequent affairs himself, including with well-known singers such as [[Maria Jeritza]], [[Emmy Destinn]], [[Cesira Ferrani]], and [[Hariclea Darclée]].<ref name=Girardi /> In 1906, while attending the opening of ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' in Budapest, Puccini fell in love with Blanke Lendvai, the sister of Hungarian composer [[Erwin Lendvai|Ervin Lendvai]] (his friend and protégé for many years).{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|2002|p=160}} Blanke and Puccini exchanged love letters until 1911, when he started an affair with German aristocrat Baroness Josephine von Stangel, which lasted for six years.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|2002|p=223}}

In 1909, Puccini's wife Elvira publicly accused Doria Manfredi, a maid working for the Puccini family, of having an affair with the composer. After being publicly accused of adultery, Doria Manfredi committed suicide. An autopsy determined, however, that Doria had died a virgin, refuting the allegations made against her. Elvira Puccini was prosecuted for slander, and was sentenced to more than five months in prison, although a payment to the Manfredi family by Puccini spared Elvira from having to serve the sentence.<ref name=AM /> Some music critics and interpreters of Puccini's work have speculated that the psychological effects of this incident on Puccini interfered with his ability to complete compositions later in his career, and also influenced the development of his characters such as Liù (from ''[[Turandot]]''), a slave girl who dies tragically by suicide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: San Francisco Opera's Music Director Designate Nicola Luisotti on Covent Garden's ''Turandot'' and his plans for his new company|url=http://www.musicalcriticism.com/interviews/luisotti-0109.shtml|access-date=25 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Two films by acclaimed and controversial filmmaker Tony Palmer|url=http://blog.naxos.com/2008/06/26/two-films-by-acclaimed-and-controversial-filmmaker-tony-palmer/|publisher=Naxos|access-date=25 August 2012|date=26 June 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107084753/http://blog.naxos.com/2008/06/26/two-films-by-acclaimed-and-controversial-filmmaker-tony-palmer/|archive-date=7 January 2009}}</ref>{{sfn|Weaver|Puccini|1994|p=375}}

According to documents found in the possession of a descendant of the Manfredi family, Nadia Manfredi, in 2007, Puccini was actually having an affair with Giulia Manfredi, Doria's cousin. Press reports at the time when these documents were discovered alleged that Nadia Manfredi was Puccini's granddaughter, by a son, Antonio Manfredi, born to Giulia.<ref name=AM>{{harvnb|Mourby|2008}}</ref>{{sfn|Espinoza|2007}}

==Politics==
Unlike Wagner and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], Puccini was not active in politics. Puccini biographer [[Mary Jane Phillips-Matz]] wrote: "Throughout this entire period [of World War I and its immediate aftermath], Puccini's interest in politics was close to zero, as it had been all his life, so far as one can judge. He seemed almost indifferent to everything from mayoral elections in Viareggio to cabinet appointments in Rome."<ref name="Phillips-Matz" /> Another biographer speculates that Puccini may have been—if he had a political philosophy—a monarchist.<ref name=Fairtile>{{cite book|last=Fairtile|first=Linda Beard|title=Giacomo Puccini: A Guide to Research|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-8153-2033-7}}</ref>

Puccini's indifference to politics caused him problems during [[World War I]]. Puccini's long-standing and close friendship with Toscanini was interrupted for nearly a decade because of an argument in the summer of 1914 (in the opening months of the war) during which Puccini remarked that Italy could benefit from German organization.<ref name="Phillips-Matz" /> Puccini was also criticized during the war for his work on ''La rondine'' under a 1913 commission contract with an Austrian theater after Italy and Austria-Hungary became opponents in the war in 1915 (although the contract was ultimately cancelled). Puccini did not participate in the public war effort, but privately rendered assistance to individuals and families affected by the war.<ref name="Phillips-Matz" />

In 1919, Puccini was commissioned to write music to an ode by {{Interlanguage link multi|Fausto Salvatori|it}} honoring Italy's victories in World War I. The work, ''Inno a Roma'' (Hymn to Rome), was to premiere on 21 April 1919, during a celebration of the anniversary of the founding of Rome. The premiere was delayed to 1 June 1919, when it was played at the opening of a gymnastics competition.{{sfn|Weaver|Puccini|1994|p=301}} Although not written for the fascists, ''Inno a Roma'' was widely played during Fascist street parades and public ceremonies.<ref>[http://sfopera.com/SanFranciscoOpera/media/Education-Resource-Materials/Tosca/Puccini_Bio.pdf Puccini biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702150356/http://sfopera.com/SanFranciscoOpera/media/Education-Resource-Materials/Tosca/Puccini_Bio.pdf |date=2 July 2011}} prepared by San Francisco Opera Company</ref>

Puccini had some contact with [[Benito Mussolini]] and the [[National Fascist Party|Italian Fascist Party]] in the year preceding his death. In 1923 the Fascist Party in Viareggio made Puccini an honorary member and sent him a membership card.<ref name="Phillips-Matz" /> However, evidence that Puccini was actually a member of the Fascist party is ambiguous.{{sfn|Wilson|2007|p=192}} The Italian Senate has traditionally included a small number of members appointed in recognition of their cultural contributions to the nation. Puccini hoped to attain this honor, which had been granted to Verdi, and undertook to use his connections to bring about the appointment. While honorary senators could vote, there is no indication that Puccini sought the appointment for this purpose. Puccini also wished to establish a national theater in Viareggio, a project which would require government support. Puccini met with Mussolini twice, in November and December 1923, seeking support for the theater project. While the theater project never came to fruition, Puccini was named Senator (''senatore a vita'') a few months before his death.<ref name="Phillips-Matz" />

At the time Puccini met with Mussolini, Mussolini had been prime minister for approximately a year, but his party had not yet taken full control of the Italian Parliament through the violence and irregularities of the [[Italian general election, 1924|1924 general election]]. Puccini was no longer alive when Mussolini announced the end of representative government, and the beginning of a fascist dictatorship, in his speech before the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1925.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pugliese|first=Stanislao G.|title=Fascism, Anti-Fascism, and the Resistance in Italy: 1919 To the Present|year=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0-7425-3122-8|quote=Mussolini's speech before the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1925 is universally recognized as the beginning of the full fascist dictatorship.

==Death==
[[File:Giacomo Puccini (1924) - Archivio Storico Ricordi FOTO003293 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Puccini in 1924|220px]]
A [[Chain smoking|chain smoker]] of [[Toscano (cigar)|Toscano cigars]] and cigarettes, Puccini began to complain of chronic sore throats towards the end of 1923. A diagnosis of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] led his doctors to recommend a new and experimental [[radiation therapy]] treatment, which was being offered in [[Brussels]]. Puccini and his wife never knew how serious the cancer was, as the news was revealed only to his son.

Puccini died in Brussels on 29 November 1924, aged 65, from complications after the treatment; uncontrolled bleeding led to a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] the day after surgery. News of his death reached Rome during a performance of ''La bohème''. The opera was immediately stopped, and the orchestra played [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|''Funeral March'']] for the stunned audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/2012/11/29/the-death-of-giacomo-puccini-brussels-29-november-1924/ |title=The Death of Giacomo Puccini |publisher=The British Newspaper Archive |date=29 November 2012 |access-date=16 January 2015}}</ref> He was buried in [[Milan]], in Toscanini's family tomb, but that was always intended as a temporary measure. In 1926 his son arranged for the transfer of his father's remains to a specially created chapel inside the Puccini villa at Torre del Lago.

==Style and critical reception==
Most broadly, Puccini wrote in the style of the late-Romantic period of classical music (see [[Romantic music]]).<ref name="Davis">{{cite book|last=Davis|first1=Andrew C.|title=Il Trittico, Turandot, and Puccini's Late Style|date=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0-253-35514-0|pages=8ff}}</ref> Music historians also refer to Puccini as a component of the ''[[giovane scuola]]'' ("young school"), a cohort of composers who came onto the Italian operatic scene as Verdi's career came to an end, such as Mascagni, Leoncavallo, and others mentioned below.<ref name="Mallach" /> Puccini is also frequently referred to as a ''[[verismo]]'' composer.<ref name="Montgomery">{{harvnb|Montgomery|2006|p={{page needed|date=August 2021}}}}</ref>

Puccini's career extended from the end of the Romantic period into the modern period. He consciously attempted to 'update' his style to keep pace with new trends, but did not attempt to fully adopt a modern style. One critic, Andrew Davis, has stated: "Loyalty toward nineteenth-century Italian-opera traditions and, more generally, toward the musical language of his Tuscan heritage is one of the clearest features of Puccini's music."<ref name="Davis" /> Davis also identifies, however, a "stylistic pluralism" in Puccini's work, including influences from "the German symphonic tradition, French harmonic and orchestrational traditions, and, to a lesser extent, aspects of [[Wagnerian]] chromaticism".<ref name="Davis" /> In addition, Puccini frequently sought to introduce music or sounds from outside sources into his operas, such as his use of Chinese folk melodies in Turandot.

All of Puccini's operas have at least one set piece for a lead singer that is separate enough from its surroundings that it can be treated as a distinct aria, and most of his works have several of these. At the same time, Puccini's work continued the trend away from operas constructed from a series of set pieces, and instead used a more "through-composed" or integrated construction. His works are strongly melodic. In orchestration, Puccini frequently doubled the vocal line in unison or at octaves in order to emphasize and strengthen the melodic line.<ref name="Davis" />

''Verismo'' is a style of Italian opera that began in 1890 with the first performance of Mascagni's ''Cavalleria rusticana'', peaked in the early 1900s, and lingered into the 1920s.<ref>"Verismo" in Stanley Sadie (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians'', London: Macmillan/New York: Grove, 1980, vol. 19, p. 670, {{ISBN|1-56159-174-2}}</ref> The style is distinguished by realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of everyday life, especially the life of the contemporary lower classes. It by and large rejects the historical or mythical subjects associated with [[Romanticism]]. ''Cavalleria rusticana'', ''Pagliacci'', and ''Andrea Chénier'' are uniformly considered to be ''verismo'' operas. Puccini's career as a composer is almost entirely coincident in time with the ''verismo'' movement. Only his ''Le Villi'' and ''Edgar'' preceded ''Cavalleria rusticana''. Some view Puccini as essentially a ''verismo'' composer,<ref name=Montgomery /> while others, although acknowledging that he took part in the movement to some degree, do not view him as a "pure" ''verismo'' composer.{{sfn|Berger|2005|page=7}} In addition, critics differ as to the degree to which particular operas by Puccini are, or are not, properly described as ''verismo'' operas. Two of Puccini's operas, ''Tosca'' and ''Il tabarro,'' are universally considered to be ''verismo'' operas.{{sfn|Fisher|2003|p={{page needed|date= April 2020}}}} Puccini scholar [[Mosco Carner]] places only two of Puccini's operas other than ''Tosca'' and ''Il tabarro'' within the ''verismo'' school: ''Madama Butterfly'', and ''La fanciulla del West''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carner |first=Mosco |author-link=Mosco Carner |title=Giacomo Puccini, 'Tosca' |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |edition=reprinted |year=1985 |page=6 |isbn=0-521-22824-7}}</ref> Because only three ''verismo'' works {{em|not}} by Puccini continue to appear regularly on stage (the aforementioned ''Cavalleria rusticana'', ''Pagliacci'', and ''Andrea Chénier''), Puccini's contribution has had lasting significance to the genre.

Both during his lifetime and in posterity, Puccini's success outstripped other Italian opera composers of his time, and he has been matched in this regard by only a handful of composers in the entire history of opera. Between 2004 and 2018, Puccini ranked third (behind Verdi and Mozart) in the number of performances of his operas worldwide, as surveyed by [[Operabase]]. Three of his operas (''La bohème'', ''Tosca'', and ''Madame Butterfly'') were amongst the 10 most frequently performed operas worldwide.<ref name="Operabase">{{cite web|title=Statistics|url=http://operabase.com/top.cgi?lang=en#opera|publisher=[[Operabase]]|access-date=18 November 2012|type=''Statistics by work and by composer'', select "From 2004" and "To 2018"}}</ref>

[[Gustav Kobbé]], the original author of ''The Complete Opera Book'', a standard reference work on opera, wrote in the 1919 edition: "Puccini is considered the most important figure in operatic Italy today, the successor of Verdi, if there is any."<ref name="Kobbé">{{cite book|last1=Kobbé|first1=Gustav|title=The Complete Opera Book: The stories of the operas, together with 400 of the leading airs and motives in musical notation|url=https://archive.org/details/completeoperaboo00kobbiala|date=1919|publisher=G.P.

Kobbé contrasted Puccini's ability to achieve "sustained" success with the failure of Mascagni and Leoncavallo to produce more than merely "one sensationally successful short opera".<ref name="Kobbé" /> By the time of Puccini's death in 1924, he had earned $4&nbsp;million from his works.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |title=The Puccini Centenary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz8EAAAAMBAJ |volume=45 |issue=23 |page=127 |date=8 December 1958}}</ref>

Although the popular success of Puccini's work is undeniable, and his mastery of the craft of composition has been consistently recognized, opinion among critics as to the artistic value of his work has always been divided. [[Grove Music Online]] described Puccini's strengths as a composer as follows:
<blockquote>Puccini succeeded in mastering the orchestra as no other Italian had done before him, creating new forms by manipulating structures inherited from the great Italian tradition, loading them with bold harmonic progressions which had little or nothing to do with what was happening then in Italy, though they were in step with the work of French, Austrian and German colleagues.{{sfn|Ravenni|Girardi|n.d.|loc=#11 Assessment}}</blockquote>

In his work on Puccini, [[Julian Budden]] describes Puccini as a gifted and original composer, noting the innovation hidden in the popularity of works such as "[[Che gelida manina]]". He describes the aria in musical terms (the signature embedded in the harmony for example), and points out that its structure was rather unheard of at the time, having three distinct musical paragraphs that nonetheless form a complete and coherent whole.{{sfn|Budden|2002|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0GRa7bzeT0gC&pg=PA163 163–164]}} This gumption in musical experimentation was the essence of Puccini's style, as evidenced in his diverse settings and use of the [[Motif (music)|motif]] to express ideas beyond those in the story and text.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Voicu |first=Mirela |title=Dramaturgical construction of the character Mimì from opera ''Boema'' de Giacomo Puccini |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=555464 |journal=Învăţământ, Cercetare, Creaţie |volume=III |issue=1 |pages=175–179 |year=2017 |publisher=Editura Muzicală |via=[[Central and Eastern European Online Library]]}} {{subscription}}{{quotation needed|date=September 2020}}</ref>

Puccini has, however, consistently been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult.<ref name=Groos>{{cite book |last1=Groos |first1=Arthur |last2=Parker |first2=Roger |title=Giacomo Puccini, La Bohème |url=https://archive.org/details/giacomopuccinila0000groo/page/127 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |edition=reprinted |date=1986 |page=[https://archive.org/details/giacomopuccinila0000groo/page/127 127] |isbn=0-521-26489-8}}</ref> Some have explicitly condemned his efforts to please his audience, such as this contemporary Italian critic:
<blockquote>He willingly stops himself at minor genius, stroking the taste of the public ... obstinately shunning too-daring innovation ... A little heroism, but not taken to great heights; a little bit of veristic comedy, but brief; a lot of sentiment and romantic idyll: this is the recipe in which he finds happiness. ({{lang|it|[E]gli si arresta volentieri alla piccola genialità, accarezzando il gusto del pubblico ... rifuggendo ostinato dalle troppo ardite innovazioni. ... Un po' di eroismo, ma non spinto a grandi altezze, un po' di commedia verista, ma breve; molto idillio sentimentale e romantico: ecco la ricetta in cui egli compiace.}})<ref>{{cite news|title=Puccini, Franchetti, Leoncavallo|newspaper=[[La Stampa]]|date=August 8, 1903}}</ref></blockquote>

Budden attempted to explain the paradox of Puccini's immense popular success and technical mastery on the one hand, and the relative disregard in which his work has been held by academics:
<blockquote>No composer communicates more directly with an audience than Puccini. Indeed, for many years he has remained a victim of his own popularity; hence the resistance to his music in academic circles. Be it remembered, however, that Verdi's melodies were once dismissed as barrel-organ fodder. The truth is that music that appeals immediately to a public becomes subject to bad imitation, which can cast a murky shadow over the original. So long as counterfeit Puccinian melody dominated the world of sentimental operetta, many found it difficult to come to terms with the genuine article. Now that the current coin of light music has changed, the composer admired by Schoenberg, Ravel, and Stravinsky can be seen to emerge in his full stature.<ref name=Budden /></blockquote>

==Centres for Puccini Studies==
Founded in 1996 in [[Lucca]], the ''Centro di studi Giacomo Puccini'' embraces a wide range of approaches to the study of Puccini's work. In the US, the American Center for Puccini Studies specializes in the presentation of unusual performing editions of composer's works and introduces neglected or unknown Puccini pieces. It was founded in 2004 by the singer and director Harry Dunstan.
