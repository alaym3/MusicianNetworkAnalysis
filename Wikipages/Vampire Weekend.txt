'''Vampire Weekend''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[New York City]], formed in 2006 and currently signed to [[Columbia Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vampire Weekend Revamp Website {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/vampire-weekend-revamp-website/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vampire Weekend Reportedly Sign To Columbia For LP4|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1911974/vampire-weekend-reportedly-sign-to-columbia-for-lp4/news/|website=Stereogum|date=18 November 2016}}</ref> The band was formed by lead vocalist and guitarist [[Ezra Koenig]], multi-instrumentalist [[Rostam Batmanglij]], drummer [[Chris Tomson]], and bassist [[Chris Baio]].

The band's eponymous first album ''[[Vampire Weekend (album)|Vampire Weekend]]'' (2008)—which included the singles "[[Mansard Roof (song)|Mansard Roof]]", "[[A-Punk]]", "[[Oxford Comma (song)|Oxford Comma]]", "[[Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa]]", and "[[The Kids Don't Stand a Chance]]"—was acclaimed by critics for its [[world music]] influences. Their following album, ''[[Contra (album)|Contra]]'' (2010), was similarly acclaimed and garnered strong commercial success. Their third studio album, ''[[Modern Vampires of the City]]'' (2013), won the group the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The 2014 Grammy Awards|journal=Electronic Musician}}</ref> Batmanglij departed the group in early 2016.

==History==

===Formation and early years (2006–2007)===
The band members met while enrolled at [[Columbia University]], beginning with a [[Rapping|rap]] collaboration between Koenig and Tomson named "L'Homme Run".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hhXgsHrv7c |title=Video Hits Interview Vampire Weekend |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2012-04-09}}</ref> They bonded over a shared love of [[punk rock]] and [[Music of Africa|African music]]. Koenig toured with [[The Dirty Projectors]] during a period of experimentation with African music, inspiring the band to incorporate [[world music|world sounds]] into their earliest work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUdHjgJARgI |title=Vampire Weekend interview (PSL) |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2012-04-09}}</ref> The band chose the name "Vampire Weekend" from the title of a short film project Koenig worked on during the summer between freshman and sophomore years in college.<ref name="Artist Direct">{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,4548330,00.html |title=Interview: Vampire Weekend |publisher=Artist Direct |date=2008-01-23 |access-date=2013-04-03}}</ref> While home for the summer, Koenig watched the 1987 vampire film ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' and was inspired to make a [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] version of the film in which a man named Walcott travels to [[Cape Cod]] to warn the mayor that vampires are attacking the United States.<ref name="Artist Direct"/> Koenig abandoned the project after two days.<ref name="Artist Direct"/> The band began playing shows around Columbia University, starting with a battle of the bands at [[Alfred Lerner Hall|Lerner Hall]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Josh Eells| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-semi-charmed-life-of-vampire-weekend-20100204 |title=The Semi-Charmed Life of Vampire Weekend | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2010-02-04 |access-date=2016-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/mcolurso/2008/03/a_few_more_facts_about_vampire.html |title=A few more facts about Vampire Weekend &#124; al.com |website=Blog.al.com |date=7 March 2008 |access-date=2012-04-09}}</ref> After graduating from college, the band self-produced their debut album while simultaneously working full-time jobs, Tomson as a music archivist and Koenig as a middle school English teacher.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=104591996262788 |title=Vampire Weekend with Beach House opening |publisher=Facebook |date=2010-09-01 |access-date=2012-04-09}}</ref>

In 2007, Vampire Weekend's song "[[Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa]]" was ranked 67th on ''Rolling Stone'''s list of the "100 Best Songs of the Year".<ref>{{cite news |title=The 100 best Songs of 2007 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2007-12-27  |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/17601363/the_100_best_songs_of_2007/17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215210735/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/17601363/the_100_best_songs_of_2007/17 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 15, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rolling Stone Magazine The 100 Best Songs Of 2007 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2007-12-27 |url=http://www.popcrunch.com/rolling-stone-magazine-the-100-best-songs-of-2007/ |access-date=2013-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726104625/http://www.popcrunch.com/rolling-stone-magazine-the-100-best-songs-of-2007/ |archive-date=2010-07-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In November 2007, they toured the UK with [[The Shins]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Vampire Weekend To Tour With The Shins |work=Angryape |date=2007-10-11 |url=http://angryape.com/news/2007/10/11/vampire-weekend-to-tour-with-the-shins |access-date=2008-06-19 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110809075014/http://angryape.com/news/2007/10/11/vampire-weekend-to-tour-with-the-shins |archive-date=2011-08-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
The then-nascent influence of blog hype and internet buzz played a role in their success and led to a large prerelease following sufficient to support them performing on three tours before their debut album was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ4MnnGBzeM |title=Vampire Weekend Interview @ Rock Werchter 2008 |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-01-13 |access-date=2012-04-09}}</ref> They were declared "The Year's Best New Band" by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine in the March 2008 issue, and were the first band to be shot for the cover of the magazine before releasing their debut album.<ref name=graduates>Greenwald, Andy.

In an interview for the February 2013 edition of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' (released in mid-January), Koenig described the upcoming album as "darker and more organic" and "very much the last of a trilogy." Said Koenig, "Things that we might have found boring in the past, we've started to find more fresh. This album has more piano and acoustic guitar and organ." ''Modern Vampires of the City'' also continued the use of digital voice modulation as heard in the songs "Diane Young" and "Ya Hey", a technique first used in the song "California English" on ''Contra'' <ref>Eliscu, J.

===Departure of Batmanglij and ''Father of the Bride'' (2014–2019)===
After remaining quiet following the conclusion of their ''Modern Vampires'' tour, which wrapped up in September 2014, it was revealed on January 26, 2016 that Rostam Batmanglij had departed the band. He noted that he and Koenig would continue to collaborate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/63158-rostam-batmanglij-quits-vampire-weekend/|title=Rostam Batmanglij Quits Vampire Weekend|website=Pitchfork.com|first=Amy|last=Phillips|date=26 January 2016|access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/01/rostam-batmanglij-vampire-weekend-quit/|title=Rostam Batmanglij Quits Vampire Weekend|website=Spin.com|first=James|last=Grebey|date=26 January 2016|access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref> Later the same day, Koenig announced that Vampire Weekend was in the studio working on their upcoming fourth album, with Batmanglij contributing to the record. The album's working title was revealed to be ''Mitsubishi Macchiato''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ezra-koenig-talks-new-vampire-weekend-lp-rostam-batmanglijs-exit-20160126|title=Ezra Koenig Talks New Vampire Weekend LP, Rostam Batmanglij's Exit|last=Blistein|first=Jon|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 26, 2016|access-date=January 27, 2016}}</ref>

In April 2016, the band briefly performed at a rally for presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] in Washington Square Park. Koenig has been a well-known supporter of Sanders, after discussions on his [[Beats 1]] radio show, [[Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig|''Time Crisis'']]. The band performed live with [[Dave Longstreth]] of the [[Dirty Projectors]], which marked their first performance as a trio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vampire Weekend and Dirty Projectors Play Bernie Sanders Rally in New York: Watch {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/64791-vampire-weekend-and-dirty-projectors-play-bernie-sanders-rally-in-new-york-watch/|website=Pitchfork.com|date=14 April 2016|language=en}}</ref>

In late 2016, Koenig was reportedly in talks to sign the band with [[Columbia Records]], as he reportedly "hit it off" with executive Rob Stringer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brennan|first1=Collin|title=Vampire Weekend rumored to have signed with Columbia for new album in 2017|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/11/vampire-weekend-rumored-to-have-signed-with-columbia-for-new-album-in-2017/|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=18 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/11/vampire-weekend-rumored-to-have-signed-with-columbia-for-new-album-in-2017/|title=Vampire Weekend rumored to have signed with Columbia for new album in 2017|date=18 November 2016|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref> Initially, this news was regarded a rumor, until the band's website revamp in 2018, in which a [[Sony Music]] copyright appeared on the site.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vampire Weekend Revamp Website {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/vampire-weekend-revamp-website/|work=pitchfork.com|agency=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref>

In March 2017, Koenig revealed in an elaborate Instagram update that during 2016 he had spent countless hours researching and writing music in libraries with grad students. Additionally, he revealed that the album, given the working title of "Mitsubishi Macchiato", would feature a more 'spring-time' vibe and one of the songs would be entitled ''Flower Moon''. Koenig revealed that LP4 would be partially inspired by the songwriting of country singer, [[Kacey Musgraves]], after he attended one of her shows in September 2016. In an interview with [[Stereogum]], he stated, "I’m the type of person who has spent hours poring over the avant-garde poetic lyrics of certain songwriters, and there was something that felt so good [about how] from the first verse, you knew who was singing, who they were singing to, what kind of situation they were in. After the show I realized there’s not a ton of Vampire Weekend songs where you could listen to the first verse and immediately answer the question of who’s singing and who are they singing to.”<ref>{{cite web|title=New Vampire Weekend Album Is Inspired By Kacey Musgraves, Features Ariel Rechtshaid And Rostam|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1975166/new-vampire-weekend-album-is-inspired-by-kacey-musgraves-features-ariel-rechtshaid-and-rostam/news/|website=Stereogum|date=11 December 2017}}</ref> Furthermore, in a September 2017 interview with [[Zane Lowe]], Ezra briefly spoke about ''LP4'' and stated that it was "about 80% done." He mentioned that the album would feature lead producer [[Ariel Rechtshaid]] with additional "guest appearances", one of which being Batmanglij.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ezra Koenig Shares Update On New Vampire Weekend Album|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1963438/ezra-koenig-shares-update-on-new-vampire-weekend-album/news/|website=Stereogum|date=19 September 2017}}</ref> Lowe pushed Koenig for a release date, citing Q1 2018 as a likely candidate. In a December 2017 interview, Koenig noted that Batmanglij was involved in a few songs, some of which was material that they had started working on long ago, and that their method of collaboration had not changed despite the latter's departure from the band.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/music/2017/12/11/vampire-weekend-new-album-ezra-koenig-interview/|title=Ezra Koenig previews Vampire Weekend's fourth LP: 'You want to age gracefully and not boringly'|first=Eric Renner|last=Brown|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=11 December 2017|access-date=30 July 2018}}</ref>
