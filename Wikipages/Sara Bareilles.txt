===2009–2012: ''Kaleidoscope Heart'' and ''The Sing-Off''===
[[File:Sara Bareilles Melkweg.JPG|alt=|thumb|180px|Bareilles at De Melkweg, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, June 16, 2008]]

Exhausted by her rise to stardom and daunted at the prospect of writing another major hit—as documented in her song "[[Uncharted (song)|Uncharted]]"—Bareilles experienced a period of [[writer's block]],<ref>{{cite magazine|date=2 March 2011|title=Sara Bareilles – Sara Bareilles' Battle With Writer's Block|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/sara-bareilles-battle-with-writers-block_1204806|magazine=ContactMusic.com|access-date=October 22, 2011}}</ref> where she came to fear she would never write another song. She began work on the follow-up to her major label debut in the summer of 2009, collaborating with the likes of [[Questlove|Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson]], members of [[Weezer]], and [[Pharrell Williams]]. As new songs began to take shape, [[Neal Avron]] was assigned to produce, record, and mix the entire album. Titled ''[[Kaleidoscope Heart]]'', the album was recorded at [[The Village Recorder]] and [[Sunset Sound]] in Los Angeles.

The first single from ''Kaleidoscope Heart'', "[[King of Anything]]", began receiving radio airplay in the United States in May 2010,<ref>{{cite web|date=3 May 2010|title=Sara Bareilles Set to Release First Single 'King of Anything' Off Forthcoming New Album|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sara-bareilles-set-to-release-first-single-king-of-anything-off-forthcoming-new-album-92683379.html|access-date=September 30, 2011|website=PRNewswire.com}}</ref> and was released for sale in June.<ref name="twittersale">{{cite web|last=Bareilles|first=Sara|date=10 May 2010|title=Quick clarification y'all...|url=https://twitter.com/SaraBareilles/status/13745535401|access-date=May 11, 2010|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter status update}}</ref> "King of Anything" had its first play on British radio airwaves on Paul Kay's "Album Download" show on Mid-Wales commercial radio station [[Radio Maldwyn|"Radio Maldwyn – The Magic 756"]] in August 2010. "King of Anything" was later certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

In anticipation of the new album, Bareilles released a series of webisodes, featuring the making of select songs from ''Kaleidoscope Heart'', including "King of Anything", "Uncharted", "Gonna Get Over You", "Bluebird", and a strings-only version of "King of Anything". The first webisode also contains Bareilles writing the chorus/refrain lyrics for "Hold My Heart". She was selected as VH1's Posted Artist of the Month for July 2010,<ref>{{cite web|date=July 1, 2010|title=Sara Bareilles Posted|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/posted/sara-bareilles/index.jhtml#fbid=1Xmulc2pTYp|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208163929/http://www.vh1.com/music/posted/sara-bareilles/index.jhtml#fbid=1Xmulc2pTYp|archive-date=February 8, 2012|access-date=September 30, 2011|website=VH1.com}}</ref> chronicling her life leading up to the album's release.

''Kaleidoscope Heart'' was released on September 7, 2010, and debuted at number 1 in the United States, selling 90,000 copies.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=15 September 2010|title=Sara Bareilles' 'Heart' Beats at No. 1 on Billboard 200|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/956309/sara-bareilles-heart-beats-at-no-1-on-billboard-200|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> Her previous album, ''Little Voice'', re-entered the charts at number 200 in the same week, bookending the charts.<ref>Trust, Gary.

Bareilles toured in support of ''Kaleidoscope Heart'' from September to December 2010, with most of the shows being sold out. Bareilles toured Europe and parts of Asia and Australia with Maroon 5 throughout spring 2011. She embarked on a small headline tour in April 2011 with openers [[Elizabeth & the Catapult]] and [[Ximena Sariñana]] in support of the second single from ''Kaleidoscope Heart'', "[[Uncharted (song)|Uncharted]]", which concluded April 23, 2011 in Memphis, Tennessee. She also opened select shows for the country music duo [[Sugarland]] on their Summer 2011 Incredible Machine Tour. The third and final single released from ''Kaleidoscope Heart'' is "Gonna Get Over You", with a music video directed by [[Jonah Hill]].

Bareilles was added in the third season of the NBC television series ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' as a celebrity judge following the departure of [[Nicole Scherzinger]], alongside [[Ben Folds]] and Shawn Stockman of [[Boyz II Men]]. Bareilles also guest-starred on ''[[Bucket & Skinner's Epic Adventures]]''.

On August 13, 2011, the Hoosier Lottery Grandstand stage at the [[Indiana State Fair]] collapsed right after Bareilles finished performing as the opening act for [[Sugarland]]. She was uninjured, tweeting, "I'm speechless and feel so helpless; my heart aches for the lives lost." Seven people were killed, and more than 45 injured, in the collapse.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/08/13/indiana.stage.collapse/index.html?iref=NS1 |title=Stage Collapse at Indiana State Fair |publisher=CNN |date=August 13, 2011 |access-date=September 30, 2011}}</ref>

In February 2013, Bareilles began teasing her fans to her upcoming album through her Twitter and YouTube accounts.
