'''Vault Boy''' is the [[mascot]] of the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' media franchise. Created by staff at [[Interplay Entertainment]], the original owners of the ''Fallout'' [[intellectual property]] (IP), Vault Boy was introduced in 1997's ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' as an advertising [[character (arts)|character]] representing Vault-Tec, a fictional [[megacorporation]] that built a series of specialized [[fallout shelter]]s throughout the United States to serve as a front for unethical experiments performed on unsuspecting participants prior to the [[nuclear holocaust]] that sets up the world state of the ''Fallout'' universe. Within the video game series, Vault Boy serves as a generic representation of the player character's [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistical information]] within [[user interface]] (UI) menus, and is a recurring element in Vault-Tec products found throughout the fictional ''Fallout'' universe. His likeness also appears as a [[skin (computing)|customizable skin]] for the [[Mii#Nintendo_Switch|Mii Gunner character]] in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.

Vault Boy's design was developed by [[Leonard Boyarsky]], who drew inspiration from 1950s films as well as the visual aesthetic of the economics-themed board game [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']]. Vault Boy is a ubiquitous feature in promotional material and merchandising for the ''Fallout'' [[brand]], and is regarded by critics to be one of the most recognizable elements of the franchise and the embodiment of its [[Sardonicism|sardonic]], [[retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] themes.

==Concept and design==
Vault Boy was unnamed in 1997's ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'', although the game's instruction manual refers to the character as Vault-Man.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/38400/manuals/Fallout_manual_English.pdf |last=Taylor |first=Christopher |author-link=Christopher Taylor (game designer) |title=Vault Dweller's Survival Guide |publisher=[[Interplay Productions]] |date=October 10, 1997}}</ref> He was created by [[Leonard Boyarsky]], who originally thought of him as the "skill guy" when he developed the character's first piece of concept art. Vault Boy was partly based on [[Rich Uncle Pennybags]]' aesthetic from the ''Monopoly'' board game, and Boyarsky came up with the idea and design for the Vault Boy  “cards”, which is intended to evoke the feel of ''Monopoly'' cards by showing the character engaged in a variety of activities in humorous ways. Vault Boy was drawn for ''Fallout'' by George Almond for the first few cards and by Tramell Ray Isaac who finalized the look of the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duckandcover.cx/content.php?id=7|title=Tim Cain interview on the Duck and Cover}}</ref> The character is inspired by films made during the 1950s, in particular the cartoon character Bert the Turtle from the 1952 [[civil defense]] [[Animation|animated]] [[Live action|live-action]] [[social guidance film]] ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'',<ref>{{cite book |editor1= Michael Blouin|editor2=Morgan Shipley|editor3=Jack Taylor  |title=The Silence of Fallout: Nuclear Criticism in a Post-Cold War World|first=William|last= Knoblauch|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|pages=132 |isbn=9781443868037}}</ref> and parodies the dualities of cheery optimism and sub-surface paranoia from that era.<ref name="pcgamesn">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout/making-of |last=Peel |first=Jeremy |title=How on Earth did ''Fallout'' ever get made? |magazine=[[PCGamesN]] |date=May 12, 2020 |access-date=May 25, 2021}}</ref><ref name="MattChat2">{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laq9ua5VjTs |last=Barton |first=Matt |title=Fallout with Tim Cain Pt. 2 |via=YouTube |date=July 4, 2010 |access-date=April 19, 2021}}</ref><ref name="SR"/>

Brian Menze was responsible for all Vault Boy images drawn for 1998's ''[[Fallout 2]]'' and 2010's ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', and he followed Isaac's art style for the character. On the other hand, the developers of the 2001 spin-off title ''[[Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel]]'', [[Micro Forté]], confused Vault Boy with another in-universe element called the [[Pip-Boy]].<ref name="IGN1">{{cite web |last1=Blevins |first1=Tal |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/091/091858p1.html |title=Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel Interview

As the mascot of ''Fallout'', Vault Boy is frequently used to convey the series' "often goony, occasionally nasty sense of humor".<ref name="IGN2">{{cite web |last1=McLaughlin |first1=Rus |last2=Kaiser |first2=Rowan |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/21/ign-presents-the-history-of-fallout?page=2 |title=IGN Presents the History of ''Fallout'' |date=July 21, 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |page=2 |access-date=May 27, 2021 |archive-date=March 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323000818/http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/21/ign-presents-the-history-of-fallout?page=2}}</ref> Orman's favorite illustration of the character from ''Tactics'' was for the special damage effect of "immobile", where he still wears a "happy, devil-may-care grin" even though his body is horribly mutilated.<ref name="IGN1"/> During the development of ''Fallout 2'', Menze was asked to come up with a perk illustration for the “Childkiller” reputation that would be bestowed on the player character should he or she happen to kill a child character, accidentally or otherwise.

Both Menze and the designer who requested it later realized that it was inappropriate and agreed not to use it, which became the only Vault Boy image to ever be cut from ''Fallout 2''.<ref name="Childkiller1">{{cite web|url=https://www.escapistmagazine.com/rejected-fallout-2-childkiller-vault-boy-image-surfaces/|title=Rejected Fallout 2 Childkiller Vault Boy Image Surfaces|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|author=Tom Goldman|date=February 28, 2010|accessdate=September 17, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Childkiller2">{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/fallout-2s-rejected-childkiller-icon-is-uh-whoa-5481821|title=Fallout 2's Rejected 'Childkiller' Icon is, Uh, Whoa ...|author=Owen Good|date=February 27, 2010|website=[[Kotaku]]|access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref>

==Description==
===Background===
[[File:Vault-Tec Logo.svg|thumb|upright|The corporate logo of Vault-Tec.]]
Vault Boy is the mascot character of the Vault-Tec Corporation, also referred to as Vault-Tec Industries, appearing in their adverts, manuals, products and training films. Although Vault-Tec's slogan, “revolutionising safety for an uncertain future”, suggests a company with people's best interests in mind, it is consistently portrayed as an [[evil corporation|unscrupulous corporation]].<ref name="pcgamesn2">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-5-vaults|last=Sampson|first=Jessi|title=Fallout 5 needs to expand on Vault-Tec's evil roots|magazine=[[PCGamesN]] |date=March 31, 2021 |access-date=September 18, 2021}}</ref><ref name="SR"/> Within series lore, Vault-Tec was contracted by the U.S. government for a nationwide project in 2054 to build [[fallout shelter]]s known as "Vaults" for the American public in anticipation of possible nuclear war with its enemies. Each Vault is self-sufficient and theoretically capable of sustaining their inhabitants indefinitely; however, the Vault project was never intended as a viable method of repopulating the United States in the event of a nuclear holocaust. Instead, most Vaults were secret, unethical social experiments, designed to determine the effects of different environmental and [[Psychology|psychological]] conditions on their inhabitants. Within this context, Vault Boy is cynically deployed as misdirection to reassure unsuspecting individuals who may be repeatedly manipulated and endangered by the Vault experiments.<ref name="SR"/><ref name=DOG>{{cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/games/loki-fallout-retrofuturism-design-references-style-influences/ |last=Byrd |first=Matthew |title=How Loki and Fallout Use Retrofuturism to Unnerve Us |work=[[Den of Geek]] |date=June 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210701005909/https://www.denofgeek.com/games/loki-fallout-retrofuturism-design-references-style-influences/ |archive-date=July 1, 2021 |access-date=July 19, 2021}}</ref>

===Appearances===
Vault Boy is presented as a young male Caucasian cartoon character, dressed in a blue and yellow jumpsuit, with blond hair styled in a distinctive swirl. His default expression is a wide beaming smile, but has been shown to make other facial expressions as well.  His signature pose is to stand with a hand extended in a thumbs up, sometimes with one eye closed. The character's in-game function is to communicate information to players: for example, he is used to represent the player in ''[[Fallout 4]]''{{'s}} perk tree menu, or in a video explaining the SPECIAL [[Statistic (role-playing games)|character statistics]] system. Vault Boy also appears in illustrations for achievements and trophies for the video games developed following Bethesda's acquisition of the ''Fallout'' IP.

Vault Boy is sometimes presented as a female equivalent, Vault Girl, who is also blonde and wears similar attire.<ref name=poly>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/deals/2021/2/18/22288193/fallout-wasteland-warfare-miniatures-ttrpg-stl-files-humble-bundle|title=The Fallout tabletop games are available in a massive new Humble Bundle |last=Hall |first=Charlie |date=February 18, 2021|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=September 17, 2021}}</ref> In 2015's ''[[Fallout Shelter]]'', Vault Boy's distinct art style is employed for the randomly generated Vault Dwellers which players manage in the game.<ref name="SR"/> A Mii Fighter costume based on Vault Boy was added to ''[[Super Smash Bros.

==Cultural impact==
[[File:Fallout_4_at_Gamescom_2015_(20402858326).jpg|thumb|upright|A van featuring Vault Boy and the Vault-Tec logo.]]
Critics noted that Vault Boy have achieved a level of cultural impact and viral recognition outside of the character's original context, which is far beyond what former Interplay staff such as [[Tim Cain]] and [[Feargus Urquhart]] had anticipated during the franchise's early years.<ref name="pcgamesn"/><ref>{{cite book|editor1= Anna Höglund|editor2= Cecilia Trenter| author=Fewster, Derek | title=The Enduring Fantastic: Essays on Imagination and Western Culture| date=2021 | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=219| isbn=9781350181465 }}</ref> This is in spite of the fact that the character is neither playable nor a character in the ''Fallout'' universe.<ref name="Greatest">{{cite book |editor=Jaime Banks |editor2=Robert Mejia |editor3=Aubrie Adams |title=100 Greatest Video Game Characters |date=June 23, 2017|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield, 2017|pages=194–196 |isbn=978-1-59582-768-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Roberts, Dale | title=World of Workcraft: Rediscovering Motivation and Engagement in the Digital Workplace|at=Chapter 13: The Purposeful Play Design Process| date=2016 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=9781134785001 }}</ref> Jeremy Peel from ''[[PCGamesN]]'' claimed that Vault Boy, as a mascot for the series' "sardonic, faux-1950s imagery", has become "as recognisable as [[Mickey Mouse]]".<ref name="pcgamesn"/> ''[[Time Magazine]]'' named Vault Boy the third most influential video game character of all time, lauding his "gloriously absurd and irreverent spectrum of dispositions and postures, from hyperbolic simpering to grisly dismemberments", which made him an icon of [[surreal humour]] in a similar manner as characters from the ''[[Monty Python]]'' series.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://time.com/4836507/influential-video-game-characters/ |author1=Lisa Eadicicco|author2=Alex Fitzpatrick|author3=Matt Peckham |title=The 15 Most Influential Video Game Characters of All Time |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date= June 30, 2017 |access-date=May 25, 2021}}</ref> Cameron Koch from ''Tech Times'' called Vault Boy's pose one of the most enduring or iconic images in video games.<ref name=TechTimes/>

A popular fan theory about Vault Boy was that the character's signature pose is a discreet method to determine whether an individual is within the fallout radius of a nuclear explosion and thus safe from radiation or otherwise.<ref name=TechTimes>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/102639/20151103/maybe-fallouts-vault-boy-isnt-giving-us-the-thumbs-up-after-all.htm|first1=Cameron|last1=Koch|title=Maybe Vault Boy From 'Fallout' Isn't Giving Us The Thumbs Up After All|publisher=Tech Times |date=November 3, 2015 |access-date=September 29, 2021}}</ref><ref name="SR"/> Former Interplay staff, such as [[Brian Fargo]] and Tramell Ray Isaac, insisted that the character is not hiding a secret meaning and is simply giving a show of encouragement, though it may not necessarily be sincere in nature.<ref name="SR"/>

===Analysis===
Writing for the 2017 publication ''100 Greatest Video Game Characters'', Rowan Derrick described Vault Boy as both a symbol of an idyllic world before nuclear war and a constant reminder of that world's failures; a concept that encompasses the promise of a pseudo-1950s nuclear powered paradise even though it directly contradicts the in-universe post-apocalyptic wasteland; and an illustration of the tension between humanity's penchant for harming each other and an ambivalence towards a technologically advanced civil society.<ref name="Greatest"/> Matthew Byrd from ''[[Den of Geek]]'' drew comparisons between Vault Boy and [[Miss Minutes]] from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], citing them as notables examples of "the Smiling Faces of Bureaucracy, Corruption, and Propaganda", where storytellers co opt retrofuturistic designs to serve as a form of social commentary.<ref name=DOG/> Vivian Asimos noted the popular use of Vault Boy's signature pose in sarcastic circumstances to be a notable example of video game content forming the backbone of numerous [[internet meme]]s due to its participatory nature.<ref>{{cite book| author=Asimos, Vivian | title=Digital Mythology and the Internet's Monster: The Slender Man|at=Playing the Slender Man| date=2021 | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing | isbn=9781350181465 }}</ref>
