== Biography ==
Born in France, Rilès started making music at a very early age by learning guitar and making [[YouTube]] covers. After obtaining a bachelor's degree, he decided to focus solely on music as a career. Rilès studied [[English literature]] at the [[University of Rouen]] while studying music on his own in his free time. He worked as a supervisor for a while to save up enough money and build his own home-studio in his bedroom. He then began to compose and write music independently. Rilès is also talented in arts. He sells his pieces of art as a way to make extra money for his music career. 
Rilès started his own music career by writing, producing, and mastering his own songs, as well as recording, directing and editing his music videos. This is reflected in his song lyrics where he references recording and producing his music independently.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/video-riles-ce-rappeur-inconnu-aux-100-millions-de-vues-youtube-apres-un-defi_1953206.html|title=VIDÉO.

He released his first album, ''Vanity Plus Mind'' (2015) and released a variety of singles such as “Brothers” which became a staple and one of his biggest hits in 2016. That same year he released one song per week, every Sunday, for a year to compile into his second “album” (more a collection of songs than an album) called “RILÈSUNDAYZ” which is made up of 52 songs. This includes songs “I Do it”, “Pesetas” and “Should I”, as some of the most popular songs. He organised in a concert tour in France in 2017 during which he performed at the [[Bataclan (theatre)|Bataclan]] in [[Paris]],<ref name=":0" /> twice, then at the Zenith of Rouen.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/normandie/seine-maritime/rouen/images-riles-met-feu-au-zenith-rouen-1377059.html|title=EN IMAGES - Rilès met le feu au Zénith de Rouen|work=France 3|access-date=2017-12-14}}</ref>
