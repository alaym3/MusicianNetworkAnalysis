'''The Revolution''' are an American <!-- Please do not change the genre without discussing it first on the talk page -->[[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota and assembled in 1979 by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. Although widely associated with rock music, the band's sound incorporated [[rhythm and blues]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Funk music|funk]], and [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] elements. Before their official breakup, the Revolution had released two studio albums, two soundtracks, and two videos. The band is known for its many members, varied in race and gender.

The Revolution rose to international fame in the mid-1980s with ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' (1984), which reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and became certified [[RIAA certification|13x Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name="RIAA">[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=3&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Prince&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 RIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by Prince] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924154537/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=3&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Prince&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |date=September 24, 2015 }}. Retrieved on December 15, 2008.</ref> The band also achieved its second number-one ''Billboard'' 200 album with ''[[Around the World in a Day]]'' in 1985. They achieved six top 10 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, including three number-ones: "[[Let's Go Crazy]]", "[[When Doves Cry]]", and "[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]". The band officially disbanded in 1986 after the [[Hit n Run – Parade Tour]], which supported ''[[Parade (Prince album)|Parade]]'', the soundtrack for ''[[Under the Cherry Moon]]''. Following [[Death of Prince|Prince's death]] in 2016, the band announced reunion shows.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7348371/prince-the-revolution-reunion-shows-video|title=Prince's Band The Revolution Announces Reunion Shows|last=Stutz|first=Colin|date=April 26, 2016|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref> The Revolution has won three [[Grammy Award]]s.

==The pre-Revolution==
When Prince formed his backing band after the release of his first album, influenced by  [[Sly Stone]], he created a multi-racial, multi-gendered [[musical ensemble]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2016/04/entertainment/prince-musical-family-tree/|title=Prince: A musical family tree|website=Cnn.com|access-date=November 22, 2020}}</ref> The band initially consisted of:

*[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] on [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[guitar]], and [[piano]]
*[[Dez Dickerson]] on [[guitar]], [[vocals]], and background vocals
*[[Andre Cymone]] on [[bass guitar]]
*[[Bobby Z.]] on [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]
*Gayle Chapman on [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]
*[[Matt Fink]] on keyboards

Though officially unnamed, Prince experimented with the band acting as a [[side project]] known as The Rebels, recording material in 1979 in [[Colorado]] to get more music out.  The recordings were a group effort with lead vocals by Cymone, Dickerson or Chapman.  The project was shelved for unknown reasons, but two of the tracks were later re-recorded and given away by Prince: "You", became "U", and was released on [[Paula Abdul]]'s 1991 ''[[Spellbound (Paula Abdul album)|Spellbound]]'' album; while "[[If I Love U 2 Nite]]" was released by both [[Mica Paris]] and Prince's later wife, [[Mayte Garcia]]. Paris rerecorded the song from scratch, which was released in 1991.  Garcia's version, released in 1995, was rerecorded by Prince.

On the next two tours following the [[Prince Tour]], the band underwent two line-up changes. Gayle Chapman quit the band in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://beautifulnightschitown.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-rest-of-my-life-gayle-chapman-talks.html|title=Dyes Got the Answers 2 Ur ?s: The Rest of My Life: Gayle Chapman Talks About Events After Prince|last=Dyes|first=K. Nicola|date=2013-08-05|website=Dyes Got the Answers 2 Ur ?s|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> The end came when she told Prince she needed more musical fulfillment and growth for herself, but Prince wanted her to commit to some short-noticed rehearsals instead. After a long conversation, Chapman quit the group to be replaced by [[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|title= Prince: Life & Times|author= Jason Draper| publisher=Jawbone Press|year=2008}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160502112306/http://new.prince.org/msg/7/37687] </ref>

The following year, after the [[Dirty Mind Tour]], bass guitarist André Cymone would leave the band. Cymone, whose family gave Prince a home after he left his father's house, left over a number of grievances with Prince—little input in the studio, he wasn't getting credit for his contributions to Prince's music, and in general his desire to start his own career—and would have bitter feelings toward Prince as he later claimed that Prince stole many of his ideas that were used for [[The Time (band)|the Time]] and that he created the bassline for ''[[Controversy (Prince album)|Controversy]]''{{'}}s "[[Do Me, Baby]]".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Ultimately, Cymone was replaced by Mark Brown, renamed [[Brownmark]] by Prince. Coleman was usually only identified by her first name, while Fink started wearing [[Scrubs (clothing)|surgical scrubs]] on stage and became known as "Doctor" Fink. Fink originally wore a black- and white-striped prison jumpsuit.  However, a member of Rick James' band was doing the same thing and not wanting to copy that, Prince asked Fink, "Do you have any other ideas?"  Fink said, "What about a doctor's outfit?"  Prince loved the idea, and thus was born Doctor Fink.

From 1982 to 1983, when the band was almost identified as the Revolution, it consisted of:

*[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] on lead vocals, guitar, and piano
*[[Dez Dickerson]] on guitar
*[[Brownmark|Brown Mark]] on bass
*[[Bobby Z.]] on drums and percussion
*[[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]] on keyboards and piano
*[[Doctor Fink|Matt Fink]] on keyboards
*[[Jill Jones|JJ]] on vocals

The words "and the Revolution" can be seen printed backwards on the cover of his fifth album ''[[1999 (Prince album)|1999]]''. The band members were curious as to if they were getting a real name, but Prince had held back from fully calling the group the Revolution partly because of [[Dez Dickerson|Dez Dickerson's]] wishes to leave the band. When the [[1999 Tour]] ended, [[Dez Dickerson]] finally left the band for religious reasons and was replaced by Coleman's childhood friend [[Wendy Melvoin]]. Prince told Dickerson that he needed three years from him, and Dickerson wasn't willing to commit. Prince told Dickerson he'd leave him on payroll and honor his contract, which Prince did. Dickerson went on to eventually work for independent Christian record label Star Song. [[Wendy & Lisa|Wendy and Lisa]] shortly thereafter formed a special bond with Prince and greatly influenced his output during the rest of their tenure in the band. Prince's former mostly R&B/funk offerings would be more diversified with rock, pop, and [[European classical music|classical music]] elements.

==Prince and The Revolution==

===''Purple Rain'' (1984–1985)===
Prince and The Revolution's best-selling album, ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'', produced by Prince and The Revolution themselves, peaked at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] knocking [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'' from the number one spot.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url ={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5182/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} | title = Chart history – Prince | work = [[Allmusic]] | access-date = December 15, 2008}}</ref> Released at the end of June 1984, the album featured the singles "[[When Doves Cry]]", "[[Let's Go Crazy]]", "[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]", "[[I Would Die 4 U]]", and "[[Take Me with U]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> All the singles had accompanying [[music video]]s (all of which included clips from their relative scenes in the movie)  and all charted on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, but the first four peaked within the top 10 while "When Doves Cry" and "Let's Go Crazy" topped the chart.<ref name="allmusic"/> "[[When Doves Cry]]" would become the most successful single from ''Purple Rain'' at the time of its release on the pop charts, reaching number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 as well as the Dance and R&B chart.<ref name="allmusic"/>

The song "Purple Rain" won two [[Grammy Award]]s for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Instrumental Composition Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album spent 24 weeks at number one and would eventually be certified thirteen times platinum in the United States, six times platinum in Canada and two times platinum in the United Kingdom.<ref name="RIAA" /><ref name="CRIA">{{cite web| url=http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php?page=1&wclause=WHERE+artist_name+like+%27%25Prince%25%27+ORDER+BY+cert_date%2C+cert_award+&rcnt=63&csearch=40&nextprev=1| title=CRIA Certifications| publisher=Canadian Recording Industry Association| access-date=December 15, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822235409/http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php?page=1&wclause=WHERE+artist_name+like+%27%25Prince%25%27+ORDER+BY+cert_date%2C+cert_award+&rcnt=63&csearch=40&nextprev=1| archive-date=August 22, 2009| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="BPI">{{cite web|title=Certified Awards |work=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |access-date=December 15, 2008 |url-status=dead |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk:80/index.asp |archive-date=December 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219051905/http://www.bpi.co.uk/index.asp }}</ref> ''Purple Rain'' would become the first official appearance of The Revolution.<ref name="RSM">{{cite web

*[[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]] on keyboards, piano, and vocals
*[[Doctor Fink|Matt "Doctor" Fink]] on keyboards and vocals
*[[Bobby Z.]] on drums

===Expansion (1985–1986)===
They lasted as such through 1986's [[Hit n Run – Parade Tour]]. In 1985, members of the then soon-to-be-defunct R&B/pop group [[The Family (band)|The Family]] (which, in turn, included former members of another disbanded Prince-associated group, [[The Time (band)|The Time]]) joined The Revolution, along with people from [[Sheila E.]]'s band. The "Counter-Revolution" line-up:

*[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] on lead vocals, guitar, and piano
*[[Wendy Melvoin]] on guitar and vocals
*[[Brownmark|Brown Mark]] on bass guitar and vocals
*[[Bobby Z.]] on drums
*[[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]] on keyboards, piano, and vocals
*[[Doctor Fink|Matt Fink]] on keyboards and vocals
*[[Miko Weaver]] on guitar{{efn|Mico Weaver joined via association with [[Sheila E.]] and as session guitarist for [[The Family (band)|The Family]]}}
*[[Susannah Melvoin]] on backing vocals{{efn|Susannah Melvoin is a former member of The Family; she was Prince's then-lover and is the twin sister of Wendy Melvoin.}}
*[[Eric Leeds]] on [[saxophone]]{{efn|Eric Leeds is a former member of The Family; brother Alan served as Prince's then-tour manager.}}
*[[Atlanta Bliss|Matt "Atlanta Bliss" Blistan]] on [[trumpet]]{{efn|Atlanta Bliss joined via association with friend and former bandmate Leeds. He was never a member of the Family.}}
*[[Jerome Benton]], Wally Safford and Greg Brooks as dancers/vocalists/comic foils (known as The Bodyguards){{efn|Jerome Benton is the sole member of [[The Time (band)|The Time]] to join The Revolution through The Family due to the departures of [[Paul Peterson|St. Paul]] and [[Jellybean Johnson]].}}

For the [[Hit n Run – Parade Tour]], the augmented Revolution with its several new members began to perform the [[jazz]]y arrangements from the album, including the [[horn section]]s.

==Unreleased Revolution album==
''[[Dream Factory (album)|Dream Factory]]'' was an unreleased double LP project recorded by Prince and The Revolution in 1986. The album morphed into ''[[Sign o' the Times]]'' following the dissolution of The Revolution.

==Dissolution==
Prince did not want to see his band anymore and The Revolution were not happy with Prince's decision to include new band members on the scene. In a 2017 direct-to-[[YouTube]] interview (on  [[Yahoo]]'s  account),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hX8ihoV2qE|title=Backspin: The Revolution talk Prince's 'Parade,' 'Sign O' the Times,' and the band's breakup|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=November 22, 2020}}</ref> Wendy Melvoin remembers Prince rehearsing with all his new selections, and ignoring The Revolution by not looking at them. Brownmark, Wendy and Lisa threatened to quit. At one point, Prince dispatched [[Bobby Z.]] to the airport and literally caught Melvoin and Coleman before they boarded. Eventually all three were convinced to ride it out.  Prince promised Brownmark a lot of money, but Brownmark settled for $3000 a week, a paltry sum based on other touring bands.  He turned down a much more lucrative gig as bassist for [[Stevie Nicks]], who was going on tour at that time.  Brown has said that Prince never followed through on "all that money". But as the tour ended, on the final night in Yokohama, Japan, Prince smashed up all of his guitars after a final encore of "Purple Rain". Wendy looked round at the other members and she whispered (and they agreed),"It's over!".

Shortly after the Parade Tour in October 1986, after all the tension between Prince, Wendy Melvoin, and Coleman due to his relationship with [[Susannah Melvoin]], Prince invited Wendy Melvoin and Coleman to [[dinner]] at his rented [[Beverly Hills]] home and fired them both.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Unhappy with their lack of credit and creativity, Wendy & Lisa went on to perform as a duo. Susannah ended up leaving the Revolution too, following a hurtful breakup with Prince, and performed for a time with Wendy & Lisa as a backup singer in their band.

He then called Bobby Z. to tell him that he was being replaced by the more versatile Sheila E, although he was kept on payroll for quite a few years after the fact, honoring Z's contract. Bobby Z would release a solo album in 1989.

Brownmark was asked to stay but quit. Although he said it was "partly out of loyalty to the others" and also because he was "unhappy with the direction of Prince's music at the time", it was probably so he could concentrate on his burgeoning career as a solo artist and as a record producer for himself and other artists.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

[[Doctor Fink|Matt Fink]] remained with Prince until 1991, when similar to the exit of [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] from [[The Time (band)|The Time]], Matt Fink told Prince he wasn't available for two dates at the Rock in Rio festival, as he was busy producing for another band at the time, and found himself replaced by [[Tommy Barbarella]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  However, Fink also stated in a 2001 interview that he was tired of being in the band.  When Prince filmed ''Graffiti Bridge'', Prince wanted Fink to "rehearse the band" and was told that "there wasn't really anywhere in the movie for him."  After the ensuing [[Nude Tour]], essentially a greatest hits-type tour, Fink left for a career writing music for video games, and working at K-Tel Records, based out of Minneapolis. Unlike his bandmates Fink did not immediately release any solo material, an album not being released until 2001.

In 2000, there was rumor of a reunion and a new album called ''Roadhouse Garden'', but Prince scrapped the plans after Wendy & Lisa backed out of the project.  Prince asked Wendy & Lisa to come to Minneapolis to finish ''Roadhouse Garden''.  They asked that Prince pay for their hotel and expenses while in Minneapolis, and  Prince refused. Not wanting to spend all their own money on a Prince project, they declined to work on the album.  Prince would later tell people to "ask Wendy & Lisa", when asked about the status of ''Roadhouse Garden''.

==Reunions==
Mini-reunions of The Revolution have taken place in several forms over the past decade.

In 2000, Prince had a celebration concert in his hometown of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], and asked if any former bandmates wished to perform. Dr. Fink, Bobby Z. and Brown Mark appeared and joined Prince on stage to perform the song "[[America (Prince song)|America]]".

On December 13, 2003, Sheila E. organized a concert for charity known as the 1st Annual Family Jamm which featured several of Prince's protégés, including the entire Revolution, without Prince. They played six songs including "[[Mountains (Prince song)|Mountains]]", "[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]", and "[[Baby I'm a Star]]". That next year, Wendy Melvoin performed a live rendition of ''[[Musicology (album)|Musicology]]'' track "Reflection" with Prince on [[Tavis Smiley]]'s [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television program.<ref>{{cite interview|title=Prince Interview |last=Nelson |first=Prince |subject-link=Prince (musician) |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/archive/200402/20040219_prince.html |type=Interview: Transcript |work=[[The Tavis Smiley Show]] |publisher=[[KCET]] |location=Los Angeles |date=February 19, 2004 |access-date=January 12, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

At the [[2006 BRIT Awards]], a somewhat reformed Revolution once again backed Prince, as he reunited with Wendy, Lisa and Sheila E., while also featuring former [[The New Power Generation|New Power Generation]] member Morris Hayes and played "[[Te Amo Corazón]]" (from Prince's ''[[3121 (album)|3121]]'' album), "[[Fury (song)|Fury]]" (also from ''3121''), "Purple Rain", and "[[Let's Go Crazy]]".  Sheila E. played drums only on "Purple Rain", playing percussion for the rest of the songs.

On February 19, 2012, The Revolution (sans Prince) performed a reunion/benefit concert in Minneapolis at [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue]], where the ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' movie was filmed.

Following the sudden death of group founder Prince on April 21, 2016, The Revolution announced that they were getting back together as a band. {{As of|2018}}, they continue to perform Prince's songs live.
