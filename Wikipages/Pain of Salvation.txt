'''Pain of Salvation''' is a Swedish [[progressive metal]] band led by [[Daniel Gildenlöw]], who is the band's main songwriter, lyricist, guitarist, and vocalist. Pain of Salvation's sound is characterised by [[riff]]-oriented guitar work, a broad vocal range, oscillation between heavy and calm passages, complex vocal harmonies and the structures of their albums,  [[syncopation]], and [[polyrhythm]]s. Thus far, every album released by the band has been a [[concept album]]. Lyrically, the band tends to address contemporary issues, such as sexuality, war, the environment, and the nature of God, humanity, and existence.

Their music is inspired by [[The Beatles]], [[Faith No More]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Jesus Christ Superstar]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/Road_Salt|title=Pain of Salvation (@Road_Salt) on Twitter|website=Mobile.twitter.com|access-date=2017-02-10}}</ref> also other musical genres like [[jazz]], [[classical music]] and [[ethnic music]]; Sometimes [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] elements can be heard in their songs. The band have also covered songs by [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Dio (band)|Dio]], [[The Moody Blues]], [[The Beatles]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and [[Elton John]].

==Etymology==
The name "Pain of Salvation" was devised by Daniel Gildenlöw, who interpreted the name as having "the meaning of balance. Taking the good with the bad. It is also a good expression in everyday use: when something does not go the way you planned, [the phrase 'pain of salvation'] indicates that this is just a slight setback on an otherwise painless journey towards your goal".<ref name=dprp>{{cite web|last=Janssen|first=René|title=Interview with Daniel Gildenlow of Swedish Pain Of Salvation|url=http://www.dprp.net/specials/pos/interview.html|work=DPRP - Dutch Progressive Rock Page |access-date=13 May 2013|date=7 August 1999}}</ref><ref name="old site">{{cite web|title=History |url-status=dead |access-date=26 September 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20010202154500/http://painofsalvation.8k.com/history.htm |archive-date=2 February 2001 |url=http://painofsalvation.8k.com/history.htm|quote=The idea with the name is that everything has two sides, everything is in balance.}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Reality and early Pain of Salvation (1984–1996)===
In 1984, an eleven-year-old [[Daniel Gildenlöw]] founded the band "Reality" in [[Eskilstuna]], [[Sweden]]. One of the early members was Daniel Magdic, who would remain with the band until after [[Entropia (album)|Entropia]] was recorded in 1997. In 1987, Reality participated in the Swedish Annual Music Contest, "Rock-SM", and were the youngest competitors ever to enter the competition.  Daniel Gildenlöw won the category of "Best Vocalist".  In 1990, drummer [[Johan Langell]] and bassist [[Gustaf Hielm]] joined the band.

Daniel Gildenlöw renamed the band to "Pain of Salvation" in 1991, having reportedly conceived the band's name during math class.<ref name=kronos>{{cite web|title=Pain Of Salvation Interjú|url=http://www.kronosmortus.com/archivum/node/10322|work=Kronos Mortus|access-date=13 May 2013|quote=I showed it to my classmate, who later became a member of the band, he said too long, nobody would remember that!|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328052418/http://www.kronosmortus.com/archivum/node/10322|archive-date=28 March 2012}}</ref> During the next 3 years, the band competed in contests and competitions while earning national recognition in the process.

In 1994, [[Kristoffer Gildenlöw]], Daniel's younger brother, replaced Hielm on bass. The line-up of the Gildenlöw brothers, Magdic and Langell entered a local studio and recorded the ''Hereafter'' demo, which the band actively shopped to  record companies. [[Fredrik Hermansson]] learned of the band through the ''Hereafter'' demo and successfully auditioned to become the band's keyboardist.

===''Entropia'' and ''One Hour by the Concrete Lake'' (1997–1999)===
In early 1997, Pain of Salvation entered the Roasting House Studio to record their debut  album, ''[[Entropia (album)|Entropia]]'', which was released in Asia on Avalon Records.  ''Entropia'' was described as "a well-needed breath of fresh air for a genre that was full of self-parody and self-indulgence," as it was "delivered with emotion, intelligence, integrity, passion, and poignancy".<ref name="Allmusic Entropia">{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Robert|title=Pain of Salvation Entropia|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/entropia-mw0000671977|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=17 May 2013}}</ref> A ''Sea of Tranquility'' reviewer also defined the album as Pain of Salvation's most "eclectic"<ref name="SoTEntropia">{{Cite web|url=https://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=2192/|title=Review: "Pain of Salvation : Entropia" - Sea of Tranquility - The Web Destination for Progressive Music!|website=Seaoftranquility.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> release because of the varied song structures and arrangements. The album was also praised for sounding "crisp and fresh."<ref name="SoTEntropia" /> In 1999, the album was released in Europe by [[InsideOut Music]] and in South America by Hellion Records.

Preparations for the band's second album were disrupted by the amicable departure of Magdic, who reportedly was unprepared to commit to the increasing demands associated with the band's initial success. Magdic was replaced by [[Johan Hallgren]], who had previously played with Daniel Gildenlöw in [[Crypt of Kerberos]]. ''[[One Hour by the Concrete Lake]]'' was released in Asia on Avalon Records in July 1998. This album was considered a darker and more complex effort than ''Entropia'', with one reviewer noting that "in a world that demands instant gratification, those things for which one must labor to reach usually give greater satisfaction in the end. That is certainly true with this CD".<ref name="SSMT 1 Hour">{{cite web|last=Braymiller|first=Matthew|title=Pain of Salvation: One Hour by the Concrete Lake|url=http://www.ssmt-reviews.com/artist/pain_of.html|publisher=Satan Stole My Teddybear|access-date=17 May 2013|date=May 2000}}</ref> Another reviewer remarked that it was a more focused effort compared to its predecessor while also noting that it was a [[concept album]] which "contains several independent subtopics and, instead of directly telling a story, combines [interesting] lyrical themes in a very unusual and successful way." Some of the concepts explored are the impact of nuclear waste on the environment and life, in particular at [[Lake Karachay]] in the former USSR; indigenous peoples rights, displacement, and beliefs; and war and firearms.<ref name="SoTEntropia" /> Pain of Salvation signed with [[InsideOut Music]] and later American sibling, [[InsideOut Music America]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rouhana|first1=Rami|title=Pain of Salvation &#124; one year by the concrete lake review|url=http://www.lebmetal.com/2010/01/pain-of-salvation-one-hour-by-the-concrete-lake/|website=Lebmetal.com|access-date=24 September 2016}}</ref>  The band embarked on a European tour supporting fellow progressive metal bands [[Threshold (band)|Threshold]] and [[Eldritch (band)|Eldritch]]. They also played at their first [[ProgPower Europe|ProgPower]] festival in [[Tilburg]] on 14 November 1999.

===''The Perfect Element, Part I'' and ''Remedy Lane'' (2000–2003)===
After a short break to regroup, Pain of Salvation recorded their third album, ''[[The Perfect Element, Part I]]'' from March to July 2000.  Conceptually, ''The Perfect Element, Part I'' examined an individual's formative events during the transition from adolescence to adulthood.  Released in October 2000, the album was noted for being more straightforward and melodic than the two previous albums, yet retaining the complexity of  arrangement and concept.<ref name="Crypt Perfect">{{cite web|last=Dragonchaser|first=Bruce|title=Review: The Perfect Element Part I|url=http://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/review.php?revid=3187|publisher=Metal Crypt |access-date=17 May 2013|date=26 July 2007}}</ref> Also, it was defined as "a landmark in the history of prog metal music. It is original, ground-breaking, fresh, and the definitive prog release of the new millennium."<ref name="Sea of Tranquility - Remedy">{{cite web|last=Batmaz|first=Murat|title=Pain of Salvation Remedy Lane|url=http://seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=356|publisher=[[Sea of Tranquility]]}}</ref> The reviewer stated that ''Perfect Element I'' marked the beginning of a completely new era for the band and praised the bold experimentation in the songwriting and conceptual development.<ref name="SoTPerfect">{{Cite web|url=https://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=3563/|title=Review: "Pain of Salvation: The Perfect Element I" - Sea of Tranquility - The Web Destination for Progressive Music!|website=Seaoftranquility.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> In support of the album, the band toured Europe from September to October 2000 with [[Arena (band)|Arena]]. In February 2001 the band headlined [[ProgPower USA]] alongside [[Symphony X]] and [[Evergrey]].

In late 2001, Pain of Salvation recorded their fourth album, ''[[Remedy Lane]]'', which was almost entirely written during a two-month period from August to September 2001 by Daniel Gildenlöw. The album, which was described as the band's "breakthrough",<ref name="Allmusic Remedy">{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Robert|title=Pain of Salvation Remedy Lane|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/remedy-lane-mw0000210587|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=17 May 2013}}</ref> was recorded at Roasting House Studio in Sweden. ''Remedy Lane'' is Daniel Gildenlöw's semi-autobiographical meditation on love, lust, and life.  The album was released in January 2002. During the Remedy Tour, Pain of Salvation opened for [[Dream Theater]].

On 12 May 2003, Pain of Salvation recorded an acoustic concert in their hometown of [[Eskilstuna]] before a crowd of 80. The concert was released as ''[[12:5]]'' in early 2004. It featured dramatically rearranged versions of the band's past material. As a result, the band considers the album as a stand-alone work and not merely a live album.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===''BE'' and ''Scarsick'' (2004–2008)===
For much of 2003 and 2004, the band worked on their most ambitious conceptual undertaking to date: a concept album about the nature of God and humanity, which Daniel Gildenlöw had been working on intermittently since 1996. The recording of the album was preceded by a number of live shows in Eskilstuna, where the band performed the album in its entirety. The shows were full productions replete with costumes, stage props, screen projections and the nine-part ''Orchestra of Eternity''.  After the conclusion of the string of performances, the material was further refined by Daniel Gildenlöw prior to commencing the recording in February 2004.

In September 2004, ''[[BE (Pain of Salvation album)|BE]]'' was released. The album proved divisive for critics and fans, with [[Allmusic]] remarking that "It may be safe to say that never in the history of rock & roll has an album creaked so alarmingly under the weight of such a ponderous concept".<ref name="Allmusic BE">{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Rick|title=Pain of Salvation Be|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/be-mw0000718093|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=17 May 2013}}</ref> ''Sea of Tranquility'' commented that "[the album] BE too holds so many undiscovered treasures, and only after a good many spins will it disclose itself to its listeners."<ref name="SoTBE">{{Cite web|url=https://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=1705/|title=Review: "Pain Of Salvation : Be" - Sea of Tranquility - The Web Destination for Progressive Music!|website=Seaoftranquility.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> ''BE'' included a song featuring samples culled from a special phone line that the band set up for fans to record their messages on "God’s answering machine". The messages were compiled and presented with a relaxed instrumental accompaniment, resulting in what the band considers to be one of their most touching tracks.<ref name=BE-notes>{{cite AV media notes |title=BE |others=Pain of Salvation |year=2004 |first=Daniel |last=Gildenlöw |type=booklet |publisher=[[InsideOut Music]] |location=[[Dortmund|Dortmund, Germany]]|page=19}}</ref>

[[Image:Daniel Gildenlow.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel Gildenlöw]] performing in 2007]]
Pain of Salvation did not play in the United States from 2004 to 2013. In 2004, Daniel Gildenlöw expressed his refusal to take part in the U.S. policy of fingerprinting all out-of-country visitors, as well as his contempt for the [[George W. Bush#Presidency|Bush administration]].<ref name=Year2005>{{cite web|last=Gildenlöw|first=Daniel|title=Year Report 2005|url=http://www.painofsalvation.com/news/|publisher=Pain of Salvation |access-date=14 May 2013|date=23 December 2005|quote=It has been a year of political discussion, due to my refusal to submit to finger printing to enter USA, and thus staying at home for the Flower Kings tour. On the other hand, the support in this matter from my fellow band members in [Pain of Salvation] has been very heart warming, and the huge positive feedback from fans around the world has been a surprising energy booster. Even fans in the US have voiced their support, along with a disappointment about the results of course. All-in-all, this decision has probably cost me a lot, but it has given me unexpected support too, and I do not regret standing my ground in this issue. If I don't, how can I expect others to stand up for what they believe in?}}</ref>  On 22 January 2009, he announced his support for the newly elected [[Barack Obama]] and lifted his embargo on the country.  On 21 February 2006, [[Kristoffer Gildenlöw]], unable to attend rehearsals due to his relocation to the Netherlands, was asked to leave the band.

''[[Scarsick]]'' was released on 22 January 2007. The album again met with mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=13659 |title=Pain of Salvation: ''Scarsick'' music reviews and MP3 |publisher=Progarchives.com |access-date=2011-07-01}}</ref>  Daniel Gildenlöw said that ''Scarsick'' is a thematic continuation of [[The Perfect Element, Part I]], drawing listeners' attention to the CD inlay where it reads: ''The Perfect Element, Part II - "He"''.<ref name="SoTScarsick">{{Cite web|url=https://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=4645/|title=Review: "Pain Of Salvation: Scarsick" - Sea of Tranquility - The Web Destination for Progressive Music!|website=Seaoftranquility.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref><ref name="youtube scarsick">{{cite web|title=Pain of Salvation's Daniel Gildenlow on ''Scarsick'' Concept|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6Q0Br0A-y0|publisher=Morow.com |date=22 January 2007|access-date=13 May 2013}}</ref>   Because of his brother's departure, Daniel Gildenlöw recorded the bass guitar parts for the album.  The band toured Europe and played select international shows, including one in Egypt. [[Simon Andersson]] was recruited as touring bassist and, on 10 March 2007, he was made a full member of the band.

On 29 April 2007 the band announced that Johan Langell would depart at the end of the tour due to family commitments. On 6 October 2007, at the "Motstøy" festival in Notodden, the band announced that Langell's replacement would be Leo Margarit. Both drummers performed during the show, with Margarit doing a three-minute solo at the end of "Nightmist". Late in 2008, Simon Andersson left the band to pursue his side projects and recover from the ''Scarsick'' tour. The band relied on touring musicians [[Per Schelander]] (2008–2010) and Daniel Karlsson (2011) for the next three years.

On 13 February 2009, the band announced that they would take part in [[Dream Theater]]'s "Progressive Nation 2009" tour.<ref name=ProgNation>{{cite web|title=Dream Theater's Progressive Nation 2009 Tour Lineup Announced|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=42292|work=Metal Underground |access-date=14 May 2013|date=13 February 2009}}</ref>  However, the recent bankruptcy of [[SPV GmbH|SPV]] forced both Pain of Salvation and Beardfish to back out of the tour because of a lack of financial backing.<ref name=ProgNationDropOff>{{cite web|title=Pain Of Salvation Drops Off Progressive Nation Tour|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=45536|work=Metal Underground |access-date=14 May 2013|date=22 June 2009}}</ref>

The [[Ending Themes (On the Two Deaths of Pain of Salvation)]] DVD was released on 24 March 2009 and featured the band performing in Amsterdam performance.  The DVD included a cover of the [[Leonard Cohen]] song, "Hallelujah".

===''Road Salt One'' and ''Two'' (2008–2013)===
On 1 November 2008, the band debuted a new song, "Mortar Grind", from their [[Road Salt One|upcoming studio album]] and [[Linoleum (Pain of Salvation EP)|EP]]. Pain of Salvation described its next project as a two album concept.<ref name="back on track">{{cite web|title=Back on Track!|url=http://www.blog.painofsalvation.com/?p=894|publisher=Pain of Salvation|access-date=13 May 2013|date=3 September 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103523/http://www.blog.painofsalvation.com/?p=894|archive-date=24 December 2013}}</ref>  However, the project was delayed due to the bankruptcy of SPV, subsidiary InsideOut Music was acquired by [[Century Media]], which allowed the band to finish the albums.<ref name="back on track" />  By the time that Daniel Gildenlöw returned to the album, he had re-evaluated the double album concept and ultimately decided to split the project into two separate releases.<ref name=USAProg>{{cite web|last=Kirtland|first=Jill Hughes|title=Interview with Daniel Gildenlöw, Pain of Salvation|url=http://usaprogmusic.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=389&Itemid=45|work=USA ProgMusic|access-date=17 May 2013|quote=It was the easiest thing to not make choices and put it all on a double album and be done with it but after that with the tour not happening and the distribution company going down.

In December 2009, it was confirmed that the song "[[Road Salt]]" would be an entry in the [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010 edition]] of [[Melodifestivalen]], Sweden's national final for the [[2010 Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref name="esct-rsmf10">{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14555 |title=Sweden reveals artist names for Melodifestivalen |last=Repo |first=Juha |date=2009-11-30 |publisher=ESCToday |access-date=30 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201174025/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14555 |archive-date=December 1, 2009 }}</ref> The band performed during the first semi-final and qualified for the runners-up broadcast; however, they lost to [[Pernilla Wahlgren]] by a slim margin and did not progress to the finals.<ref name="esct-rsmf10"/>

''[[Road Salt One]]'' was released on 17 May 2010 in most of Europe and on 8 June 2010 in the North America while ''[[Road Salt Two]]'' was released in September 2011.

{{quote|1=it’s not like a chronological story like the other albums. It’s like several parallel stories and once you look at them together they start vibrating at the same speed or frequency and that’s where you get the story...The whole idea is to compare situations or chains of events, compare them to roads and choose what roads you want to take and the roads will lead you to different places...whatever road you are traveling down at different points in the movie they will be keyframes. At that position, you could see things from a different perspective than you normally would.  Many of these songs are these key frames and sort of singularities and special points on the different roads from all these different people doing the different things.  That’s where everything connects.<ref name=USAProg />}}

In late 2011 and early 2012, the band's lineup underwent significant turmoil, with Johan Hallgren and Fredrik Hermansson leaving at the end of the year,<ref name="johanLeaves">{{cite web|url=http://www.painofsalvation.com/2011/johan-leaves-pos/|title=Johan Hallgren leaves the band|publisher=Pain of Salvation|date=21 October 2011|access-date=15 May 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906041501/http://www.painofsalvation.com/2011/johan-leaves-pos/|archive-date=6 September 2012}}</ref>  touring bassist Daniel Karlsson joining the band on keyboards,<ref name="Karlsson">{{cite web|url=http://www.painofsalvation.com/2011/meet-our-new-keyboard-player/|title=Meet Our New Keyboard Player|publisher=Pain of Salvation|access-date=24 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810191450/http://www.painofsalvation.com/2011/meet-our-new-keyboard-player/|archive-date=10 August 2016}}</ref> Gustaf Hielm returning on bass guitar, and [[Ragnar Zolberg]] joining on guitars.<ref name="Zolberg">{{cite web|url=http://www.painofsalvation.com/2011/presenting-the-guitarist/|title=Ragnar Zolberg on guitar|publisher=Pain of Salvation|access-date=5 January 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194605/http://www.painofsalvation.com/2011/presenting-the-guitarist/|archive-date=10 March 2012}}</ref>
