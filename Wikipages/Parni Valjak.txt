'''Parni Valjak''' ({{IPA-sh|pâːrniː ʋǎːʎak|pron}}; "steamroller") is a [[Croatia]]n and [[SFRY|former Yugoslav]] [[rock music|rock]] band. They were one of the top acts of the former [[Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav rock scene]], and currently one of the top rock-and-roll bands in Croatia. 

==Biography==
Parni valjak was founded in 1975 in Zagreb. Unlike many rock bands that would come later, their style was becoming more mainstream, becoming closer to pop, especially compared with the bands like [[Prljavo kazalište]] or [[Film (band)|Film]].

As years went by, their refusal to change their style proved to be an important factor in the band's longevity. Parni valjak kept a loyal following in 1980s and in 1990s, refusing to allow elements of [[folk music|folk]] and [[turbo folk]] music to become part of their repertoire. Because of that the band enjoys great respect among many Croatian rock critics, being seen as the embodiment of "true" rock and [[urban culture]] and many of their songs are considered evergreen in the former Yugoslavia like "Sve još miriše na nju", "Jesen u meni", "Ugasi me" and "Zastave". Parni valjak kept a relatively small but dedicated following for 30 years, and many people attend their concerts marked by energetic performances, despite the advanced age of the band members: ''Aki Rahimovski'' - vocals, ''Husein Hasanefendić-Hus'' - guitars, [[Marijan Brkić Brk]] - guitars, ''Berislav Blažević-Bero'' - keyboards, ''Zvonimir Bučević-Buč'' - bass guitar, ''Dražen Scholz-Šolc'' - drums, ''Tina Rupčić'' - vocal, ''Anita Mlinarić'' - sax.

In December 2005, Parni valjak made a farewell tour of [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] on their 30th anniversary. Their last public performance in 2005 was a concert on New Year's Eve in [[Ban Jelačić Square]] in Zagreb, though they stated that more concerts may be held in future. In November 2009, they began a reunion tour in Croatia.

In October 2010, Parni valjak held a 2 concerts at [[Belgrade Arena]], [[Belgrade]] that was followed with great public turnout (more than 44,000 people in 2 days).<ref>http://www.rts.rs/page/magazine/sr/story/431/Muzika/780896/Arena+uhvatila+ritam+%E2%80%9EParnog+valjka%E2%80%9C.html</ref>
