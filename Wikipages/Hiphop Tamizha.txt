'''Hiphop Tamizha''' ({{IPA-ta|hiphaːp t̪amiɻaː}}) is an Indian [[Musical ensemble|musical duo]] based in [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. The duo consists of Adhithya "Adhi" Venkatapathy  and R.

Their commercial break-through came with the song "Club le Mabbu le" in 2011. In 2012, Hiphop Tamizha released their debut album ''[[Hip Hop Tamizhan]]'', which is India's first Tamil hip hop album. It was a major success with both the general public and critics. While the duo were originally [[independent music]]ians, since 2013 they have contributed primarily to composing for films.

== Career ==

=== Origins and early work ===
Adhi and Jeeva met via [[Orkut]] in 2007. They were passionate about music and decided that they should create an independent music group in India, in Tamil.<ref name="guindy times" /> According to ''[[The Hindu]]'' and Hiphop Tamizha's [[Facebook]] page, Adhi had not officially found Hiphop Tamizha until 15 February 2010.<ref name=fusion /><ref name="facebook" />

Around the mid 2000s, Adhi released ''Viswaroobam Arambam'',<ref name="fusion" /> the first Tamil hip hop [[mixtape]] in India.{{efn|While a 2011 report by ''The Hindu'' claimed that ''Viswaroobam Arambam'' was released in 2006,<ref name="fusion" /> the official Facebook page of Hiphop Tamizha gives its release year as 2005.<ref name="facebook">{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/hiphoptamizha/info?tab=page_info |title=About Hiphop Tamizha |last=Hiphop Tamizha |via=Facebook |access-date=13 June 2015 |archive-date=8 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308160832/https://www.facebook.com/hiphoptamizha/info?tab=page_info |url-status=live }}{{Primary source inline}}</ref>}} It also played a major role in promoting hip hop as a part of the Tamil culture.<ref name="thehindu2" /> Adhi and Jeeva remained [[underground music|underground]] until they were asked by the [[Tamil Nadu State Election Commission]] to compose an election anthem.<ref name="thehindu1" /> Hiphop Tamizha's single ''Ezhuvoam Vaa'' was chosen as the official anthem for Tamil Nadu's [[2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|2011 state elections]],<ref name="Music Perk" /> and Adhi performed it at [[Pachaiyappa's College]] when [[Anna Hazare]] came there.<ref name="thehindu1" /> Though the song was commercially unsuccessful,<ref name=Multilingual /> Adhi and Jeeva considered it at one point their "best work so far".<ref name="cadence" />

=== Commercial success ===
Adhi composed the song "Club le Mabbu le" in his first year of college.<ref name="thehindu1" /> When we asked how it developed, he recalled, "I grew up watching my mother and aunts just being traditional, and when I saw girls going to bars, I immediately wrote the lyrics of that track. And through my lyrics I am raising the debate over whether we are really changing as a society or are simply aping the West."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sify.com/news/Tamizhan-da--Hip-hop-goes-seriously-Tamizh-imagegallery-2-Features-miqr3Jaebiisi.html |title='Tamizhan da'&nbsp;– Hip hop goes seriously Tamizh |website=Sify |access-date=5 February 2015 |archive-date=12 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612044305/http://www.sify.com/news/Tamizhan-da--Hip-hop-goes-seriously-Tamizh-imagegallery-2-Features-miqr3Jaebiisi.html |url-status=live }}</ref> When Adhi was living in Chennai, he met [[Ma Ka Pa Anand]], then an RJ at [[Radio Mirchi]].<ref name="Grammy" /> Anand allowed Adhi to perform ''Club le Mabbule'' on his radio show with [[Beatboxing|beatboxer]] Bharadwaj Balaji (also known as Triple B).<ref name="guindy times" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/regional/another-kolaveri-in-the-making-602653 |title=Another Kolaveri in the making? |date=1 December 2011 |publisher=[[NDTV]] |access-date=3 December 2014 |archive-date=21 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021190131/http://movies.ndtv.com/regional/another-kolaveri-in-the-making-602653 |url-status=live }}</ref> The recording went [[viral video|viral]], receiving over two million views within a week of its release on YouTube. Afterwards [[Rémy Martin]], an international brand, was surprised by Adhi's determination and launched ''Hiphop Tamizha'' as an official brand.<ref name="guindy times" /> "Club le Mabbule" later vaulted Hiphop Tamizha further into public view when it was criticized as portraying Tamil women in a negative light.<ref name="Senthamizh" />

Hiphop Tamizha's debut album ''[[Hip Hop Tamizhan]]'' was released on 17 August 2012 at [[SPI Cinemas|Sathyam Cinemas]] in Chennai. Publicised as "India's first Tamil hip hop album", it was launched by Purple Note and produced by Remy Martin, in the latter's first association with an Indian album. The music was composed by Adhi and Jeeva, with lyrics by Adhi.<ref name="Music Perk" /> The album was lauded by critics. [[Naren Weiss]], writing for ''Zomba'', called it "nothing short of a masterpiece," while Venkatrangan R of ''Musicperk'' labelled it "A must listen.

Topically, Hiphop Tamizha's songs deal with a wide range of issues. ''Club le Mabbu le'' describes certain nontraditional "failings" of Tamil women, including drinking, smoking, consuming [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and having [[Cohabitation|live-in relationships]].<ref name="Senthamizh" /> ''Sentamizh Penne'', the exact opposite of ''Club le Mabbu le'', talks about a culturally-rich girl, whose traditions are worthy of respect.<ref name="mytamilchannel">{{cite web |url=http://mytamilchannel.com/index/album-review-adhi-hip-hop-tamizha-hip-hop-tamizhan/ |title=Album review: Adhi (Hip Hop Tamizha)&nbsp;– Hip Hop Tamizhan |last=Pravin Bala |date=24 October 2012 |publisher=MyTamilChannel.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402182334/http://mytamilchannel.com/index/album-review-adhi-hip-hop-tamizha-hip-hop-tamizhan/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 |access-date=12 March 2015}}</ref> ''Tamizh Theriyum'' ridicules those who mock the Tamil language or act like they do not speak it.<ref name="mytamilchannel" /> ''Vaadi Pulla Vaadi'' focuses on the conflicts of caste and love, and was inspired by the personal experiences of Adhi's friends.<ref name="deccan" /> According to him, ''Iraiva'' talks about how love is not the end of life: "Two people might really be in love, but because of things like caste, they might not be able to be together. This, we feel, is because of lack of education and awareness". The song ''Karpom Karpippom'' is dedicated to education,<ref name="proud" /> describing it as the main tool required to solve social problems. ''Cheap Popularity'' is Adhi's response to those who criticised him for allegedly seeking popularity through ''Club le Mabbu le''.<ref name="mytamilchannel" />

In 2014, Adhi said that Hiphop Tamizha's aim is to rebuke the belief among contemporary youngsters that conversing in Tamil is "not cool", and that the project was started to enable them to "relate to the concept of being a proud [[Tamils|Tamizhan]], to give them an identity."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140122/entertainment-tvmusic/article/tamil-new-%E2%80%98kewl%E2%80%99 |title=Tamil is the new 'kewl' |date=22 January 2014 |website=Deccan Chronicle |access-date=2 February 2015 |archive-date=14 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314165523/http://deccanchronicle.com/140122/entertainment-tvmusic/article/tamil-new-%E2%80%98kewl%E2%80%99 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although the songs ''Manithan Tamizhan'' and ''Tamizhanda'' [[Tamil nationalism|glorify the culture and language of Tamil Nadu]] and lament their modern-day negligence,<ref name="Music Perk" /> Adhi has stated that Hiphop Tamizha does not want to preach that Tamil people should speak their native language or praise it unduly. Rather, they aim to give it a little respect, similar to what other music has done for the English language.<ref name="deccan" /> He has also said that he wants to change the Indian urban culture of hip-hop being about wearing "baggy pants, 'bling' and big shirts" and eliminate the notion that rap music is about "the money, the women and the [[Gangsta rap|gangster-ism]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zomba.in/Journal/keeping-it-real-hiphop-tamizha-style/ |title=Keeping It Real, Hiphop Tamizha Style |date=4 May 2012 |website=Zomba.in |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130217235721/http://zomba.in/Journal/keeping-it-real-hiphop-tamizha-style/ |archive-date=17 February 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
