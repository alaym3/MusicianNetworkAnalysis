Throughout 2004–2005, Rebelution began to build momentum through consistently playing local shows and by independently releasing an [[Extended play|EP]]. All four current members graduated from [[UC Santa Barbara]], getting degrees in religious studies (Rachmany), anthropology (Finley), film studies (Williams), and business economics (Carey).<ref name='pt'/>

Rebelution released their first full-length album ''[[Courage to Grow]]'' on June 8, 2007, which would become the breakthrough album for the band. The album was praised for its crafty melodies, socially conscious lyrics, and savvy musicianship. ''Courage to Grow'' went on to garner mass downloads and radio play on stations such as San Francisco's [[Live 105]] where their single "Safe and Sound" was played on heavy rotation, with spins on San Diego's [[91X]] and Los Angeles's [[KROQ]]. The album was selected as iTunes Editor's Choice for Best Reggae Album of 2007. In addition, ''Courage to Grow'' peaked at #4 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] ''Top Reggae Albums'' chart.<ref name=albums/>  However, Velasquez, one of the two vocalists, left after the release of ''Courage to Grow'' because of growing tired from the rigorous touring lifestyle, and left Rebelution as a four-member band.<ref name='citybeat'/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thepier.org/seedless-to-continue-on-without-casey-sullivan/ |title=Seedless to Continue On Without Casey Sullivan |last=Patti |first=Mike |date=March 16, 2016 |website=www.ThePier.org |access-date=September 2, 2016}}</ref>
