The '''Five-Percent Nation''', sometimes referred to as the '''Nation of Gods and Earths''' ('''NGE'''/'''NOGE''') or the '''Five Percenters''', is a [[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] movement influenced by [[Islam]] which was founded in 1964 in the [[Harlem]] section of the borough of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], by Allah the Father, who was previously known as [[Clarence 13X]] and, before that, Clarence Edward Smith.

Members of the group call themselves Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those [[elite]]s and their agents opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the eighty-five percent.<ref name="npr.org">{{cite news|title=God, the Black Man and the Five Percenters|newspaper = NPR.org|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5614846|access-date=February 13, 2012|publisher=NPR}}</ref><ref name="HipHopWired">{{cite web |url=http://hiphopwired.com/2012/06/28/the-meaning-of-the-5-a-look-at-the-nation-of-gods-and-earths/ |title=The Meaning of the 5%: A Look at the Nation Of Gods And Earths |last=Chandler |first=D.

The Nation of Gods and Earths teaches the belief that [[Black people]] are the original people of the planet Earth and are therefore the fathers ("Gods") and mothers ("Earths") of [[civilization]].<ref name="npr.org" /> The Nation teaches that Supreme Mathematics and Supreme Alphabet, a set of principles created by Allah the Father, is the key to understanding humankind's relationship to the universe. The Nation does not believe in a god but instead teaches a form of [[Apotheosis]], that the Asiatic Blackman is God and his proper name is "Allah", the Arabic word for "God".<ref name="npr.org" />

== History ==
=== Founding ===
{{Nation of Islam|Offshoots}}
The Nation of Gods and Earths was founded by [[Clarence 13X]] after he left the [[Nation of Islam]]'s Temple Number Seven in Harlem, New York, the same temple where [[Malcolm X]] was a minister from 1960 to 1963. Multiple stories exist as to why Allah and the NOI parted ways: Some state he refused to give up gambling; others state he questioned the unique [[divinity]] of [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], whom the NOI deified as the true and living God in person; or that he questioned Fard's godhood due to the fact that Fard was born of a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] mother.{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=48}}<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Knight|first=Michael M.|title=The Five Percenters|publisher=Oneworld|year=2007|isbn=9781851686155|pages=35–36}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Five Percenter Rap|last=Miyakawa|first=Felecia|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0253217639|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253345745/page/15 15–16]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253345745/page/15}}</ref> One story states that he was disciplined by the NOI and [[excommunicated]] in 1963, but another version of events says that he left of his own free will.{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=99}}

When Allah the Father left the NOI, he was joined by Abu Shahid (formerly John 37X), who agreed with Allah's questioning of Wallace Fard Muhammad. Allah the Father and Shahid were nicknamed "High Scientists" due to their intense study of lessons.<ref name=":4" /> Allah was also joined by Justice (formerly James 109X, and before that, James Howell) who would become one of Allah's closest associates until his death.<ref>{{cite web |author=Beloved Allah |url=http://www.thetalkingdrum.com/nge.html |title=The Founding of the Nation Of Gods And Earths |publisher=Thetalkingdrum.com |access-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=125-126}}

Allah proselytized the streets of Harlem to teach others his views based on his interpretation of NOI teachings. After failing to reach elder adults whom he saw as already set in their ways, he found success with street youth.<ref name="IslamIn">{{cite book |title=Islam in America |author=Jane I.

# Actual Facts (13)
# Solar Facts (9){{sfn|Allah|2007|p=153}}

Each Five Percenter was required to fully "master" each lesson and was expected to be able to "think and reason by forming profound relationships between the lessons and significant experiences within life.{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=153}} Five Percenters were also required to share what they had learned with others, and thereby recruit new members.{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=138–139}}

The FBI's labeling the Five Percenters as a "gang" in 1965 has caused much trouble for Gods and Earths in the United States.

=== "Five Percent" ===
The term "Five Percenter" is taken directly from the "Five Percent" who are described in "Lost-Found Muslim Lesson No. 2" of the Nation of Islam. The lesson groups the people of the world into three categories. Eighty-five percent of the world's population are described as "uncivilized people; poison animal eaters; slaves from mental death and power, people who do not know the Living God or their origin in this world, and they worship that which they do not know. ... [They] are easily led in the wrong direction, but hard to lead into the right direction." Ten percent of the world's population are described as "The rich; the slave-makers of the poor; who teach the poor lies—to believe that the Almighty, True and Living God is a spook and cannot be seen by the physical eye. Otherwise known as: The Blood-Suckers of the Poor." Five Percent of the world's population are described as "the poor, righteous Teachers, who do not believe in the teachings of the 10%, and are all-wise; and know who the Living God is; and Teach that the Living God is the Sun of man, the supreme being, the (Black man) of Asia; and Teach Freedom, Justice and Equality to all the human family of the planet Earth."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence|last=Washington|first=Teresa|publisher=Oya's Tornado|year=2014|isbn=978-0-9910730-0-9|pages=92–93}}</ref>{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=137–138}}

=== The Universal Language ===
<!--Do not add a list of the Supreme Mathematics other than what has already been written. Any further details can be accessed via the references below.-->
The Supreme Mathematics and Supreme Alphabet are key concepts in the Five Percent Nation. The Supreme mathematics is a system of understanding [[numerical digit|numerals]] alongside concepts and qualitative representations that are used along with the Supreme Alphabet.<ref name="ThisFar" /><ref name="CantStop" /> The '''Supreme Mathematics''' is thought to be the highest system of [[numerology]] in the NGE, used to give qualitative value to numbers in addition to quantity.  How the values associated with each number were derived are currently unknown. The numerals are as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence|last=Washington|first=Teresa|publisher=Oya's Tornado|year=2014|isbn=9780991073009|pages=97}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Five Perenter Rap|last=Miyakawa|first=Felicia|publisher=Indiana University PRess|year=2005|isbn=0253217636|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253345745/page/26 26]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253345745/page/26}}</ref>{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=134}}

The '''Supreme Alphabet''' is a system of interpreting text and finding deeper meaning from the NOI Lessons by assigning actual meanings to the letters of the [[Latin script]]. For example, the first letter, A, stands for Allah; the 12th letter, L, stands for Love, Hell, or Right; and the 13th letter, M, stands for Master. The Supreme Alphabet was developed by Allah the Father and Justice.{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=135}} The method by which letters were associated with certain values is unknown.

=== Customs ===
<!--Move all relevant and appropriate information from elsewhere in this article into this section.-->
The Five-Percent Nation holds events known as Universal Parliaments in various cities—usually once a month—to build on their interpretation of the Supreme Mathematics, lessons, and to discuss business concerning the NGE.{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=238–239}} These meetings usually take place in public areas and can be held anywhere.

The Show and Prove is an annual event that takes place in the Harlem section of Manhattan every second weekend in June. Gods and Earths converge from all over the world at [[Harriet Tubman]] Elementary School for this gathering, which includes a marketplace, performances, and speeches in the school's auditorium and a [[science fair]] in which children participate.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2014/jun/19/five-percenters-hold-44th-annual-show-and-prove/ |title=Five Percenters hold 44th annual Show and Prove |access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref>

Because the NGE defines itself as a way of life and not a religion,{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=345}} the Nation generally does not observe religious [[holidays]], including those associated with Christianity or Islam.<ref name="Allah 2009">{{cite book |last=Allah |first=Wakeel |author-link=Wakeel Allah |title=In the Name of Allah: A History of Clarence 13X and the Five Percenters, Vol. 2 |publisher=A-Team Publishing |location=Atlanta, GA |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9821618-2-1 |oclc=607977900 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSeCRQAACAAJ |access-date=23 April 2019 |page=300}}</ref> Many Five Percenters honor Allah the Father's birthday (February 22) and/or the official founding of the Nation (October 10) with special events and parliaments.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Five Percenters |last=Knight |first=Michael |publisher=One World |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-85168-615-5 |pages=172, 214}}</ref>

Similar to adherents of denominations of Islam, Five Percenters abstain from eating [[pork]] or any pork-based by-products.{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=138–139}} According to Five Percenter Universal Shaamguadd, Allah the Father stated Five Percenters should avoid eating "small scavengers, such as shrimp," and also avoid "lobsters, crabs, clams, and oysters."{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=149}} Some Five Percenters take further steps and eschew meat altogether, often opting for "strict" vegetarianism.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |title=Five Percenter Rap |last=Miyakawa |first=Felicia |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-253-21763-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253345745/page/32 32] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253345745/page/32 }}</ref> Allah the Father advocated "eating one meal a day, every other day or every third days, as prescribed in the Nation of Islam."{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=149}} Allah was also a proponent of fasting and many new adherents fast as part of "an induction process."{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=151}}

=== Teachings on race ===
The teachings of Five-Percent Nation have been accused of promoting black supremacy. As in the Nation of Islam, Five Percenters believe that the original inhabitants of the world were Black (which they refer to as the "Asiatic Blackman" and believe had inhabited the earth for "66 trillion years") who ultimately descended from the [[Tribe of Shabazz]], while the [[White people|White race]] are evil "devils" who were created 6,000 years ago on what is today the Greek island of [[Patmos]] by a 'rogue bigheaded scientist' named [[Yakub (Nation of Islam)|Yakub]] (the Biblical and Qur'anic [[Jacob]]) who was of the [[Mecca]]n branch of the tribe. After the Whites attempted to rise up against their creators, they were exiled to the caves of "West Asia" - what would later be known as Europe. The Yakub origin story is the basis for all Five Percenter racial understanding.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/8737494|title="Ain't No Spook God": Religiosity in the Nation of Gods and Earths|last=Andrews|first=Pamela|website=Academia.edu|access-date=2 August 2019}}</ref>

== Hip hop ==
The majority of allusions to Islam in American hip-hop, either conscious or otherwise, spawn from adherents of the Five Percenters. <ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ejf_DwAAQBAJ&dq=Five+Percenters&pg=PA169 |title=Representing Islam: Hip-Hop of the September 11 Generation |last=Mohamed Nasir |first=Kamaludeen |date=2020 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=9780253053053 |access-date=April 29, 2021}}</ref> In its article on Five Percenter [[Jay Electronica]], ''[[Vice Magazine]]'' stated in regard to the Five Percent Nation: "It's a movement that's been affiliated with hip-hop from the very beginning, coining terms like 'ciphers' and 'dropping science' and influencing everyone, [[World's Famous Supreme Team]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Method Man]], [[Rakim]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Brand Nubian]], [[Nas]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Poor Righteous Teachers]], [[Erykah Badu]], and [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]]. With these artists, and any others associated with the Five Percenters, music was more than just a message."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/the-prestige-the-five-percenters-and-why-jay-electronica-hasnt-released-his-debut-album |title=The Prestige, The Five Percenters, and Why Jay Electronica Hasn't Released His Debut Album &#124; NOISEY |last=Bassil |first=Ryan |date=October 23, 2013 |publisher=Noisey.vice.com |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

The Nation of Gods and Earth has propagated its teachings throughout the [[United States]] and abroad. In the early 1980s, this spread was in part due to early adherents teaching when away at college or in the military and, more famously, because of the rise of [[hip hop music]]. The main theme of the NGE doctrine spoken on hip hop records were the teachings that black people were the original or first human life to walk the planet, that the Blackman is God, the Blackwoman is Earth, and through the inner [[esoteric]] powers of the Gods and Earths, the youth can transform and possess its true potential, which aspires to overthrow the overbearing [[oligarchy]] by becoming just rulers of themselves. This especially meshed well with conscious themes found in other golden-age hip hop recordings.

Early hip-hop acts affiliated with the Five Percenters, and who spread its teachings through hip hop, include two MCs of the late 1980s–early '90s conscious-rap era—[[Rakim]] of [[Eric B. & Rakim]]<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_WwhU7vQ5ancC |title=SPIN – |via=[[Internet Archive]] |date=February 1991 |publisher=SPIN Media LLC |access-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref> and [[Big Daddy Kane]]. These two acts, as well as some of their other contemporaries, infused Five-Percent teachings and symbolism throughout their music and videos. This reputation brought fans of Rakim in particular to refer to him as the God MC. After Rakim and Kane's heyday rose acts that were even more explicit with allegiance to the NGE, most notably [[Brand Nubian]], [[Poor Righteous Teachers]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Killarmy]], [[Sunz of Man]], [[Gravediggaz]] and [[Busta Rhymes]].{{sfn|Allah|2007|p=321}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Five Percenters |last=Knight |first=Michael |publisher=One World |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-85168-615-5 |pages=117–186}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence |last=Washington |first=Teresa |publisher=Oya's Tornado |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-9910730-0-9 |pages=101–136}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Five Percenter Rap |last=Miyakawa |first=Felicia |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-253-21763-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253345745/page/41 41–72] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253345745/page/41 }}</ref> The popularity of these acts sparked a boom of new NGE students. The hip hop group [[3rd Bass]], whose MC's [[Pete Nice|Prime Minister Pete Nice]] and [[MC Serch]] were white and Jewish, respectively, cited NGE lessons in the song "Triple Stage Darkness" and other songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/3rd-bass-triple-stage-darkness-lyrics |title=3rd Bass – Triple Stage Darkness |website=Genius |publisher=[[Genius.com]] |access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref>

For example, in the song "Wildflower," [[Ghostface Killah]] rhymes, "I'm God Cipher Divine," spelling G-O-D in the Supreme Alphabet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackapologetics.com/supremealpha.html |title=Supreme Alphabet |publisher=Blackapologetics.com |access-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rapgenius.com/Ghostface-killah-wildflower-lyrics |title=Ghostface Killah – Wildflower Lyrics |publisher=Rap Genius |access-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref> Furthermore, [[RZA]] directly rhymes the Twelve Jewels of life's objectives on his later work with [[Gravediggaz]], rhyming in succession: knowledge, wisdom, understanding, freedom, justice, equality, food, clothing, shelter, love, peace, happiness.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/Gravediggaz-twelve-jewelz-lyrics |title=Gravediggaz – Twelve Jewelz |website=Genius |publisher=[[Genius.com]] |access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref> He regularly wears an eight-pointed star pendant with a number seven and a crescent, which can be seen on the cover of his album ''[[The World According to RZA]]''.

Five Percenters in New York City were a visible presence at parties during hip hop's formative years of the 1970s. Scene pioneer [[DJ Kool Herc]] recalled that while there was a heavy gang presence in attendance, the Five Percenters were also there as a ''de facto'' peace-keeping element.<ref name="GodHop">{{cite book |title=Five Percenter Rap: God-Hop's Music, Message, and Black Muslim Mission |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253345745 |url-access=registration |author=Felicia M.
