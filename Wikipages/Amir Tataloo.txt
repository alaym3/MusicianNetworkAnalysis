== Controversies ==

=== Nuclear energy song ===
During the Iran/5+1 nuclear talks in [[Vienna]], in July 2015, he released a song supporting the [[Iranian nuclear program]]. The music video was produced on the Iranian navy ship [[Iranian frigate Damavand|''Damavand'']].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/07/16/watch-iranian-rapper-celebrates-nuclear-power-from-the-deck-of-a-warship/|title=Watch: Iranian rapper celebrates nuclear power from the deck of a warship|author=Ishaan Tharoor|date=16 July 2015|work=Washington Post}}</ref>

Titled "[[Energy Hastei (song)|Energy Hasteei]]" (انرژی هسته ای), the song's central message was to uphold Iran's right to patrol the Persian Gulf and to produce peaceful nuclear energy. Tataloo's nationalistic song caused controversy<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/07/FOR%20WED%20iran-rapper-tataloo-video.html#ixzz4i7Y8FJxe|title=This young Iranian rapper may have cost Raisi the presidency |date=9 July 2017 |work= Al-Monitor}}</ref> among his Iranian fans who respected the artist for his frank, unconformative political and social statements and were surprised to see him appearing to assist the government in their messaging around the nuclear issue.

=== Allegations of child grooming and sexual abuse ===
On April 24, 2020, Tataloo's [[Instagram]] account was shut down because he called for girls 15 to 20 years of age to join his "harem" and engage in sexual activity with him.<ref>{{cite news|date=25 April 2020|title=Iranian Rapper Calling For Underage Girls To Join His Harem Kicked Out Of Instagram|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|url=https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iranian-rapper-calling-for-underage-girls-to-join-his-harem-kicked-out-of-instagram/30576509.html|access-date=29 April 2020}}</ref> Tataloo deleted these posts a few hours after publication, but screenshots of his posts were taken and sent to women's rights organizations, journalists, and lawyers, who argued that Tataloo's actions equated to child abuse.<ref name="iranwire6973">{{cite news|date=27 April 2020|title=Instagram Shuts Down the Account of Popular Iranian Singer Accused of Child Grooming|work=Iranwire|url=https://iranwire.com/en/features/6973}}</ref> Tataloo proceeded to make another account, which was also shut down.<ref>{{Cite web|title=First His Supporters Insulted Me, Then They Threatened Me with Rape and Murder|url=https://iranwire.com/en/features/6997|access-date=16 May 2020|website=IranWire {{!}} خانه|language=en}}</ref>
