==Life and career==
===Early life and career beginnings===
At an early age, Aha showed an interest in music, playing [[trombone]] in middle school, and playing the drums by the age of 13 at his father’s church. Aha began experimenting with [[music production]] at 14 years old. By 15, he released his first self-produced [[mixtape]] under the name Trill Will.

He transitioned from the drums to keyboards and began playing at other churches in his native [[New Orleans]]. He attended [[Grambling State University]] where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in business management in 2014.<ref name="genius"/> He gained further recognition upon releasing ''Free Barabbas'' in 2015, which featured the singles "Gettin' Money" and "Vegeta", the latter of which proved to be his most successful single.<ref name="rapzilla">{{cite web|url=http://rapzilla.com/rz/music/freemp3s/12043-aha-gazelle-free-barabbas|title=Free Album: Aha Gazelle - Free Barabbas|website=rapzilla.com|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref> Aha was signed to Reach Records in 2017 by [[Lecrae]], who had been closely watching the young artist.<ref name="hiphopdx2">{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.43815/title.aha-gazelle-learned-his-hustle-from-master-p-got-his-platform-from-lecrae|title=Aha Gazelle Speaks On New Orleans Influences, Lecrae&#039;s Impact & Trilliam Series|website=HipHopDX|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, Aha announced that he was leaving Reach Records to pursue other ventures.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}
