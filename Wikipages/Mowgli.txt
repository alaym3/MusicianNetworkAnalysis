'''Mowgli''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aʊ|ɡ|l|i}}) is a fictional character and the protagonist of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' stories. He is a [[feral child|feral]] boy from the [[Pench National Park|Pench]] area in [[Seoni]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]], who originally appeared in Kipling's short story "In the Rukh" (collected in ''[[Many Inventions]]'', 1893) and then became the most prominent and arguably the most memorable character in the collections ''The Jungle Book'' and ''[[The Second Jungle Book]]'' (1894–1895), which also featured stories about other characters.<ref name= Sale>

==Name==
In the stories, the name Mowgli is said to mean "frog", describing his lack of fur. Kipling later said "Mowgli is a name I made up. It does not mean 'frog' in any language that I know of."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_junglebook_names.htm|title=Kipling's list of names|date=30 March 2007|website=www.kiplingsociety.co.uk|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>

Kipling stated that the first syllable of "Mowgli" should rhyme with "cow" (that is, {{IPAc-en|m|aʊ}})<ref>[http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_junglebook_names.htm Kipling's list of names in the stories]</ref> rather than "mow" ({{IPAc-en|m|oʊ}}).

==Kipling's Mowgli stories==
The Mowgli stories, including "In the Rukh", were first collected in chronological order in one volume as ''The Works of Rudyard Kipling Volume VII: The Jungle Book'' (1907) (Volume VIII of this series contained the non-Mowgli stories from the Jungle Books), and subsequently in ''[[All the Mowgli Stories]]'' (1933)..

"In the Rukh" describes how Gisborne, an English [[forest ranger]] in the [[Pench Tiger Reserve|Pench area]] in [[Seoni]] at the time of the [[British Raj]], discovers a young man named Mowgli, who has extraordinary skills in hunting, tracking, and driving wild animals (with the help of his wolf brothers). He asks him to join the forestry service. Mueller, the head of the Department of Woods and Forests of India as well as Gisborne's boss, meets Mowgli, checks his elbows and knees, noting the callouses and scars, and figures Mowgli is not using magic or demons, having seen a similar case in 30 years of service. Muller also offers Mowgli to join the service, to which Mowgli agrees. Later, Gisborne learns the reason for Mowgli's almost superhuman talents; he was raised by a pack of wolves in the jungle (explaining the scars on his elbows and knees from going on all fours). Mowgli marries the daughter of Gisborne's butler, Abdul Gafur. By the end of the story, Mowgli has a son and is back to living with his wolf brothers.

Kipling then proceeded to write the stories of Mowgli's childhood in detail in ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. Lost by his parents as a baby in the Indian jungle during a tiger attack, he is adopted by the [[Indian wolf|Wolf]] Mother, [[Raksha (The Jungle Book)|Raksha]] and [[Father Wolf]], who call him Mowgli (frog) because of his lack of fur and his refusal to sit still. [[Shere Khan]] the tiger demands that they give him the baby but the wolves refuse. Mowgli grows up with the pack, hunting with his brother wolves. In the pack, Mowgli learns he is able to stare down any wolf, and his unique ability to remove the painful [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns]] from the paws of his brothers is deeply appreciated as well.

[[Bagheera]], the black panther, befriends Mowgli because both he and Mowgli have parallel childhood experiences; as Bagheera often mentions, he was "raised in the King's cages at [[Udaipur|Oodeypore]]" from a cub, and thus knows the ways of man. [[Baloo]] the [[sloth bear|bear]], teacher of wolves, has the thankless task of educating Mowgli in "[[The Law of the Jungle]]".

Shere Khan continues to regard Mowgli as fair game, but eventually Mowgli finds a weapon he can use against the tiger – fire. After driving off Shere Khan, Mowgli goes to a human village where he is adopted by [[Messua (Jungle books)|Messua]] and her [[Messua's husband|husband]], whose own son [[Nathoo]] was also taken by a tiger. It is uncertain if Mowgli is actually the returned Nathoo, although it is stated in "[[Tiger! Tiger! (Kipling short story)|Tiger! Tiger!]]" that the tiger who carried off Messua's son was similar to the one that attacked Mowgli's parents. Messua would like to believe that her son has returned, however, she herself realises that this is unlikely.

While herding [[Indian Buffalo|buffalo]] for the village, Mowgli learns that the tiger is still planning to kill him, so with the aid of two wolves, he traps Shere Khan in a ravine where the buffalo trample him. The tiger dies and Mowgli sets to skin him. After being accused of witchcraft and cast out of the village, Mowgli returns to the jungle with Shere Khan's hide and reunites with his wolf family.

In later stories in ''The Jungle Book'''s sequel, ''[[The Second Jungle Book]]'', Mowgli learns that the villagers are planning to kill Messua and her husband for harboring him. He rescues them and sends elephants, water buffaloes, and other animals to trample the village and its fields to the ground. Later, Mowgli finds and then discards an ancient treasure ("The King's [[Ankusha|Ankus]]"), not realising it is so valuable that men would kill to own it. With the aid of [[Kaa]] the python, he leads the wolves in a war against the [[dhole]] ([[Red Dog (Kipling short story)|"Red Dog"]]).

Finally, Mowgli stumbles across the village where his adopted human mother (Messua) is now living, which forces him to come to terms with his humanity and decide whether to rejoin his fellow humans in "[[The Spring Running]]".

==Play adaptations==
Rudyard Kipling adapted the Mowgli stories for ''The Jungle Play'' in 1899, but the play was never produced on stage. The manuscript was lost for almost a century. It was published in book form in 2000.<ref>''The Jungle Play'': UK paperback edition: {{ISBN|0-14-118292-X}}</ref>

==Influences upon other works==
Only six years after the first publication of ''The Jungle Book'', [[Edith Nesbit|E. Nesbit]]'s ''The Wouldbegoods'' (1899) included a passage in which some children act out a scene from the book.<ref name= Sale />{{rp|204}}

Mowgli has been cited as a major influence on [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] who created and developed the character [[Tarzan]]. Mowgli was also an influence for a number of [[Feral Children in Mythology and Fiction|other "wild boy" characters]].

[[Poul Anderson]] and [[Gordon R. Dickson]] used the Mowgli stories as the basis for their humorous 1957 science fiction short story "Full Pack (Hokas Wild)". This is one of a series featuring a teddy bear-like race called Hokas who enjoy human literature but cannot quite grasp the distinction between fact and fiction. In this story, a group of Hokas get hold of a copy of ''The Jungle Book'' and begin to act it out, enlisting the help of a human boy to play Mowgli. The boy's mother, who is a little bemused to see teddy bears trying to act like wolves, tags along to try to keep him (and the Hokas) out of trouble. The situation is complicated by the arrival of three alien diplomats who just happen to resemble a monkey, a tiger and a snake. This story appears in the collection ''Hokas Pokas!'' (1998) and is also available online.

==Mowgli stories by other writers==
''[[The Third Jungle Book]]'' (1992) by Pamela Jekel is a collection of new Mowgli stories in a fairly accurate pastiche of Kipling's style.

''Hunting Mowgli'' (2001) by Maxim Antinori is a very short novel which describes a fateful meeting between Mowgli and a human hunter.

''The Jungle Book: Last of the Species'' (2013) by Mark L Miller is a series of comic books that tells the story of a female Mowgli who unintentionally started a war between animal tribes after killing Shere Khan to avenge the fallen members of the wolf tribe.
