==History==
===Formation (2012-2013)===
Munimuni was formed in [[University of the Philippines|UP Diliman]], TJ de Ocampo met Adj Jiao who was, at that time, doing a musical project with Red Calayan. They figured out that they had similar tastes in music, so they started writing and arranging songs together.

A year after they started, de Ocampo was sent to Japan as an exchange student, later on adding John Owen Castro as the band's session keyboardist. Munimuni kept on doing gigs while de Ocampo was away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheretobaguio.com/get-know-munimuni-band/|title=Get to Know: Munimuni the Band|website=Where to, Baguio?|date=9 November 2017|access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://gadgetsmagazine.com.ph/lifestyle/music-corner/music-corner-indie-searchlight-munimuni|title=Music Corner – Indie Searchlight: Munimuni|publisher=Gadgets Magazine|date=25 January 2017|access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref>
