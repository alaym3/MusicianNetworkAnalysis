'''Entombed''' is a Swedish [[death metal]] band formed in 1987 under the name of [[Nihilist (band)|Nihilist]]. Entombed began their career as an early pioneer of [[Scandinavian death metal]] which initially differed from its American counterpart by its distinct "buzzsaw" guitar tone. However, by the early 1990s their sound had broadened to include [[garage rock]] and other influences. This new style would eventually be described as [[death 'n' roll]]. Entombed has been influenced by bands such as [[Slayer]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Autopsy (band)|Autopsy]], [[Repulsion (band)|Repulsion]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], [[Motörhead]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karsmakers.nl/metal-e-zine/entombed.htm |title=Interview with Entombed |publisher=Karsmakers.nl |access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Entombed |title-link=Entombed (album) |others=Entombed |year=1996 |first=Dan |last=Tobin |page=4 |type=CD booklet |publisher=[[Earache Records]] |location=New York City}}</ref> Along with [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]], [[Grave (band)|Grave]] and [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]], Entombed has been referred to as one of the "big four" of [[Swedish death metal]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://metal-rules.com/review/viewreview.php?month=June&year=2012&pos=48 |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109113236/http://metal-rules.com/review/viewreview.php?month=June&year=2012&pos=48 |archive-date=9 January 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
Entombed are rooted in the band [[Nihilist (band)|Nihilist]] who were formed by drummer [[Nicke Andersson]], guitarist Alex Hellid and bassist Leif Cuzner, who formed the band in 1987.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=149}}</ref> After using a number of temporary vocalists for their initial shows, the band eventually recruited [[Lars-Göran Petrov|L.G. Petrov]],<ref name="LarkinHR"/> who was the drummer for the band [[Morbid (band)|Morbid]], which featured [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] vocalist [[Dead (musician)|Dead]]. The band also recruited Morbid's session guitarist [[Uffe Cederlund]] as a second guitarist, and recorded a number of demos with tracks that would eventually appear on Entombed's [[Left Hand Path (album)|debut album]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Following increased tensions between band members, the majority of the band decided to rename themselves as Entombed rather than force these members out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nihilist/14076|title=Nihilist - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=Metal-archives.com}}</ref>

Entombed's debut album ''[[Left Hand Path (album)|Left Hand Path]]'' was released in 1990,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> a cult favorite that established them as a popular [[Swedish death metal]] band.<ref name=ekeroth>Ekeroth, Daniel (2006). ''Swedish Death Metal''.</ref> ''Left Hand Path'' and its follow-up, ''[[Clandestine (album)|Clandestine]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> were unique in that they featured what was sometimes referred to as a "buzz saw" guitar sound.<ref name=ekeroth/> Prior to the recording of ''Clandestine'', Petrov was fired from the band due to personal disputes.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The vocals on the album were recorded by Andersson instead, and for the tour following the album's release in 1991, the band hired vocalist Johnny Dordevic, previously a member of the band [[Carnage (band)|Carnage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Johnny_%C4%90or%C4%91evi%C4%87/8483|title=Johnny Đorđević - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=Metal-archives.com}}</ref>

Petrov eventually reconciled with the band after releasing an album with the band [[Comecon (band)|Comecon]], and the band eventually released ''[[Wolverine Blues]]'' in 1993.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The album featured a departure of sound from the band's previous work, with a greater influence of [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] alongside their initial death metal stylings, in a style now often referred to as [[death 'n' roll]].<ref name=bowar>Bowar, Chad.

1998's ''[[Same Difference (album)|Same Difference]]'' was the band's first album without drummer and founding member [[Nicke Andersson]], who left the band to concentrate on his new project [[The Hellacopters]].<ref name=entombed>Birchmeier, Jason.

In 2001, the band worked with performance artists Carina Reich and Bogdan Szyberb, and the [[Royal Swedish Ballet]].<ref name=nme>[http://www.nme.com/news/entombed/7638 "'Unreal' People"]. ''[[NME]]''. 3 May 2001. Access date: 18 June 2008.</ref> The production was entitled ''[[Unreal Estate (Entombed album)|Unreal Estate]]''.<ref name=nme/>
[[file:Metalmania 2007 - Entombed 02.jpg|thumb|270px|Entombed during [[Metalmania]] festival in Poland, 2007]]
2003 saw the release of ''[[Inferno (Entombed album)|Inferno]]'', which was the last album with guitarist Uffe Cederlund (who joined [[Disfear]]), bassist Jörgen Sandström and drummer Peter Stjärnvind.

Nico Elgstrand (who produced the album ''Uprising'') joined as bassist in 2004, Olle Dahlstedt (of Alpha Safari and ex–[[Misery Loves Co.]]), replaced Stjärnvind in 2006. When Uffe Cederlund left in 2005, no new guitarist was recruited and Alex Hellid remained as the only guitarist.

''[[Serpent Saints – The Ten Amendments]]'' was released on 9 July 2007.<ref name=entombed/> The album featured a greater influence from traditional death metal and was the band's first release with drummer Olle Dahlstedt and bassist Nico Elgstrand.

In 2010, Victor Brandt joined as bass player and Nico Elgstrand switched to guitars so the band once again had two guitarists.

In 2013, Petrov and Hellid began a legal battle regarding the name Entombed.

In 2014, L.G. Petrov, Olle Dahlstedt, Nico Elgstrand and Victor Brandt formed [[Entombed A.D.]] as a result of the band's trademark being held by Hellid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/l-g-petrov-led-version-of-entombed-becomes-entombed-a-d/|title=L.G. PETROV-Led Version Of ENTOMBED Becomes ENTOMBED A.D.|date=21 January 2014}}</ref>

Hellid, Cederlund, and [[Orvar Säfström|Säfström]] reunited to perform "Clandestine" in its entirety with a symphony orchestra in February 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/video-original-entombed-members-perform-clandestine-with-orchestra-choir/ |title=Video: Original Entombed Members Perform 'Clandestine' With Orchestra, Choir |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=5 February 2014 |access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref> Nicke Andersson  intended to participate, but was prevented by scheduling conflicts.

Hellid, Andersson and Cederlund reunited to perform as Entombed in 2016.

On 7 March, 2021, former vocalist Lars-Göran Petrov died after a battle with [[cholangiocarcinoma]], aged 49.
