==Online career==

===Video content===
Jackson created his YouTube channel in 2006 but did not upload any content until October 2007.<ref name=Manarino2013>{{Cite web|last=Manarino|first=Matthew|url=https://newmediarockstars.com/2013/06/onision-the-definitive-timeline-of-youtubes-ultimate-villain/|title=Onision: The Definitive Timeline Of YouTube's Perfect Villain|date=June 27, 2013|work=[[NewMediaRockstars]]|access-date=May 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703132258/https://newmediarockstars.com/2013/06/onision-the-definitive-timeline-of-youtubes-ultimate-villain/|archive-date=July 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Onision-about/> His earliest clips featured a character named Chibi, whom fans interpreted as a parody of [[Fred Figglehorn]].<ref name=Manarino2013/> In 2019, ''[[Insider Inc.#Insider|Insider]]'' wrote that Jackson was "best known for his objectifying content and controversial reputation", and detailed that "he rates pictures that women submit to him, gives his opinions on their bodies, and comments on other YouTubers".<ref name=Graves2019/>

In 2009, Jackson uploaded "Banana Song (I'm a Banana)", which went [[viral video|viral]]. The video featured Jackson "jumping around screaming in a banana suit",<ref name=Graves2019/> as well as his first wife, Skye Tantaga.<ref name=Manarino2013/> "Banana Song" was featured on [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Tosh.0]]'' as the "Viewer Video of the Week" in 2010.<ref name=ComedyCentral2010>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/episodes/huyilx/tosh-0-february-3--2010---friendly-tackle-season-2-ep-204|title=Tosh.0 - February 3, 2010 - Friendly Tackle - Full Episode|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|access-date=January 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207215735/http://www.cc.com/episodes/huyilx/tosh-0-february-3--2010---friendly-tackle-season-2-ep-204|archive-date=December 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2011, Jackson posted a number of clips with his then-girlfriend [[Lyldoll|Shiloh Hoganson]].<ref name=Manarino2013/> The clips were scripted but presented in a manner many fans interpreted as unscripted.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In some of them, however, Hoganson is seen apparently experiencing transient [[amnesia]]; Adrienne Jourgensen, an ex-girlfriend of Jackson's, published a letter stating that Jackson believed Hoganson was lying about her memory loss.<ref name=Manarino2013/> Jackson and Hoganson later stated that she was pregnant but suffered a [[miscarriage]].<ref name=Manarino2013/><ref name=Cook2013>{{cite web|last=Cook|first=James|title=YouTube's most troubled star|date=December 10, 2013|access-date=January 1, 2017|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/features/report/7407/youtubes-most-troubled-star/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103002341/http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/features/report/7407/youtubes-most-troubled-star/|archive-date=January 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, a video featuring Hoganson resurfaced online; in it, Jackson is heard telling her, "You know this video is never going to be online, right?

===Reception and criticism===
Jackson's on-camera and off-camera activity has received criticism from online media outlets as well as from fellow online content creators. In 2010, ''[[Tubefilter]]'' listed Jackson as one of "5 YouTubers On Their Way Up", alongside [[Shane Dawson]] and the [[Fine Brothers]]. The outlet described Jackson's channel as frequently updated with a "very rough, in-your-face R-rated style" and called Jackson "the most controversial YouTuber."<ref name="Hyde2010">{{cite web|last=Hyde|first=William|date=April 12, 2010|title=5 YouTubers on Their Way Up|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2010/04/12/5-youtubers-on-their-way-up/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102171812/http://www.tubefilter.com/2010/04/12/5-youtubers-on-their-way-up/|archive-date=January 2, 2017|access-date=January 1, 2017|work=[[Tubefilter]]}}</ref> In 2012, ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' described Jackson as "known for his militant vegetarianism, sex appeal, comedic skits, and controversial views on topics like circumcision."<ref name=Eordogh2012/> The publication has also criticized his content on multiple occasions; in 2013, James Cook wrote for the outlet, calling Jackson "YouTube's most troubled star".<ref name=Cook2013/>

In 2018, Jackson was included on a ''Daily Dot''-published list of six YouTubers "worse" than [[Logan Paul]].<ref name="Katzowitz2018">{{cite web|last=Katzowitz|first=Josh|url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/worst-youtube-channels/|title=Forget Logan Paul—these 6 wildly popular YouTube pranksters are worse|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=January 23, 2018|access-date=November 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127185557/https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/worst-youtube-channels/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The outlet opined that "[Jackson's] videos these days [2018] are just as obnoxious and irritating as they were nine years ago when he first struck YouTube gold with a truly terrible song about being a banana."<ref name="Katzowitz2018" /> Jackson has also received criticism from fellow YouTubers, notably Daniel Sulzbach (known online as "MrRepzion" or "Repzion"), Strange Æons, and [[Blaire White]].<ref name="Manarino2013" /><ref name="Asarch2019">{{cite web|last=Asarch|first=Steven|title=Who is Onision?

==Controversies==
===Event and platform bans===
Jackson was banned from [[VidCon|VidCon 2012]] due to a video in which he stated that since his then girlfriend [[Shiloh Hoganson]] slept with more than 20 people before she was with him, she is a "slut" and therefore "cannot be raped".<ref name=Manarino2013/><ref name=Eordogh2012>{{cite web|last=Eördögh|first=Fruzsina|url=https://www.dailydot.com/society/onision-rape-vidcon-haters-youtube-banned/|title=YouTuber inflames viewers with rape comments|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=January 25, 2012|access-date=November 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310231228/http://www.dailydot.com/society/onision-rape-vidcon-haters-youtube-banned/|archive-date=March 10, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The video then received backlash from viewers outside of Jackson's core audience, as noted by ''[[NewMediaRockstars]]'' and ''[[The Daily Dot]]''.<ref name=Manarino2013/><ref name=Eordogh2012/> VidCon co-founder [[Hank Green]] sent an email to Jackson stating "if it is possible that you will not be safe, we will not let you come [to VidCon]."<ref name=Manarino2013/>

In November 2019, Jackson was banned from [[Patreon]] after posting the phone number of Billie Dawn Webb, a fellow YouTuber. Webb was one of several women who claimed Jackson and his spouse had groomed and manipulated them into a sexual relationship or otherwise engaged in harassment and abuse.<ref name=Kelly2019>{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Makena|title=Controversial YouTuber banned from Patreon after alleged doxxing|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20984785/onision-doxxing-patreon-deplatformed-twitter-youtube|work=[[The Verge]]|access-date=November 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127020325/https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20984785/onision-doxxing-patreon-deplatformed-twitter-youtube|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Patreon confirmed in a statement to ''[[The Verge]]'' that they had banned Jackson "as he violated our Bullying and Harassment [policy] as it relates to [[doxing]]."<ref name=Kelly2019/> In response to the ban, Jackson uploaded a video of him seemingly contorting himself, screaming, pouring [[kombucha]] on himself, and shouting, "What am I going to do now?" Jackson subsequently opened a new web site where his supporters could re-donate, but shut it down shortly after its launch.<ref name=Jackson2019>{{cite AV media|last=Jackson|first=Gregory|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53U7egj54cE|title=hiatus|work=UhOhBro|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=November 27, 2019|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212094201/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53U7egj54cE|archive-date=December 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2021, following the release of ''Onision: In Real Life'', Jackson's channels were suspended from the [[YouTube Partner Program]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sung|first=Morgan|title=YouTube demonetized Onision|url=https://mashable.com/article/youtube-onision-demonetized/|access-date=2021-02-03|website=Mashable|language=en}}</ref>

===Allegations of abuse and child grooming===
In 2019, allegations of [[child grooming]] and abuse were leveled at Jackson and his spouse, Kai Avaroe, formerly known as Lainey.<ref name=Graves2019/> Jackson responded by stating that "the grooming stuff is absolute nonsense."<ref name=Graves2019/> As aforementioned, Webb also made allegations of abuse by Jackson and Avaroe, stating that they were sent texts asking them to "be chained to [the] basement wall for a week with a sign around [their] neck that says 'I'm sorry for lying.'"<ref name=Graves2019/>

When reached by ''Insider'' for a comment in response to these allegations, Jackson requested $10,000 for an interview and stated: "I do not want to participate in this circus without compensation, I should be paid to endure to {{sic}} stupidity of the current state of [[call-out culture|outrage/online culture]]."<ref name=Graves2019/> 

On January 9, 2020, Jackson called [[9-1-1]] on American television journalist [[Chris Hansen]] and his lawyer, Mike Morse, for knocking on his door. He described Hansen and his crew as "YouTuber stalkers... Yelling things at [him] through the door", although footage taken by Hansen's crew on the day did not confirm Jackson's account. He had previously asked Hansen for $350,000 in order to be interviewed. Morse stated that "It concerns me that he [has] two kids in the home," and that he "really didn't like hearing about this guy on ''[[Chris Hansen#Have a Seat with Chris Hansen|Have a Seat with Chris Hansen]]''."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Why Is Mike Morse Chasing Accused YouTube Sex Predator Onision?|url=https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/24133/why_is_mike_morse_chasing_accused_youtube_sex_predator_onision|last=Ikonomova|first=Violet|date=January 13, 2020|publisher=Deadline Detroit|access-date=January 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114012958/https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/24133/why_is_mike_morse_chasing_accused_youtube_sex_predator_onision|archive-date=January 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Jackson and Avaroe have since filed two petitions for an [[order of protection]] from unlawful [[Harassment#United_States|harassment]] conduct, one (also on behalf of their children) against Hansen and the other against Sulzbach, who has hired a criminal attorney for the case, which was on January 24 at the [[Pierce County, Washington#Government|Pierce County District Court]] in Washington state, according to their court database.
