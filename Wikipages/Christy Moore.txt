He is one of the founding members of [[Planxty]] and [[Moving Hearts]]. His first album, ''[[Paddy on the Road]]'' was recorded with [[Dominic Behan]] in 1969.

== Early life ==
Moore was born in [[Newbridge, County Kildare]], Ireland and attended [[Newbridge College]]. He was originally a bank employee who wanted to express himself using traditional music. During a bank strike in 1966, which lasted twelve weeks, he went to England, as many striking officials did, but didn't return when the strike was settled. "I had a wild and wonderful time in England, with no bank manager looking over my shoulder," he said. Doing general labouring work, he frequented the folk clubs and the Irish music pubs where he met [[Seamus Ennis]], [[Margaret Barry]], [[Luke Kelly]], Martin Byrnes and many other traditional musicians.<ref name=moo>{{cite book

}}</ref> When Irish singing trio [[The Grehan Sisters]], with whom Moore was previously acquainted, moved to the north of England from Dublin in 1967, they assisted Moore to get a higher profile by giving him contacts and support slots on their concerts.

== Musical career ==
1973 brought his first major release, ''[[Prosperous (album)|Prosperous]]'', which brought together the four musicians who shortly thereafter formed [[Planxty]]: [[Liam O'Flynn]], [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] and [[Dónal Lunny]]. For a time they called themselves "CLAD", an acronym of their names, but soon decided on [[Planxty]].<ref name=moo />

After leaving Planxty in 1975, Moore continued on his solo career, reforming his old band on occasion (which he has been doing ever since). He also formed the band [[Moving Hearts]] with Lunny and five other musicians in 1980. In 1987 he appeared on [[Gay Byrne]]'s ''[[The Late Late Show (Irish talk show)|The Late Late Show]]'' performing with [[The Dubliners]] for their 25th anniversary. In 2000, he published his autobiography, ''One Voice''.<ref name=moo />

Moore's earlier lifestyle resulted in a decline in health and several operations. Moore's battle with alcohol, and subsequent heart operations, have taken their toll. At the end of the 1990s, Moore reduced his workload for medical reasons.<ref name=moo />

Some of Moore's songs are heavily influenced by drink and the effects of drink, his song "Delirium Tremens" being a good example. Listening to Johnny Mulhern's song "Hard Cases" caused Moore to recall the Galway drinking scene with local musicians [[Mickey Finn (Irish fiddler)|Mickey Finn]], Pete Galligan, Corky and Terry Smith.

On 17 April 2009, Moore released his first new studio album in four years, entitled ''Listen'', and promoted it through a series of live gigs.<ref>{{cite web

In December 2011, Moore released the album ''Folk Tale''.  His next album ''Where I Come From'' was released in November 2013 and features a new protest song called "Arthur's Day".  The album peaked at number three in the Irish album charts.<ref>{{cite web

Political songs he has performed throughout his career include [[Mick Hanly]]'s "On the Blanket" about the protests of republican prisoners, [[Viva la Quinta Brigada (song)|"Viva la Quinta Brigada"]],  about the Irishmen who fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]] against [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], and "Minds Locked Shut" about [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] in Derry.

Moore has endorsed a long list of leftist support causes, ranging from El Salvador to [[Mary Robinson]] in the 1990 presidential election.<ref name=moo /> At the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 2005, he sang about the Palestinian solidarity activist [[Rachel Corrie]]. He supported the [[anti-nuclear movement]] in Ireland playing in many concerts and at festivals in [[Carnsore Point]] for the cause.

== Banned songs ==
"They Never Came Home" is a song about the [[Stardust fire]] of 1981 where 48 people died. The song was recorded on the ''[[Ordinary Man (Christy Moore album)|Ordinary Man]]'' album and was released on the B-side of a single in 1985. The song achieved notoriety when Moore was taken to court over claims in the song prejudical to an ongoing court case determining compensation. For instance, the song claimed, "hundreds of children are injured and maimed, and all just because the fire exits were chained". Mr Justice Murphy ordered the ''Ordinary Man'' album to be withdrawn from the shops, and costs were awarded against Moore. "Another Song is Born" was recorded for the album's re-release. "They Never Came Home" later appeared on his box set and on the album ''Where I come from''.<ref>{{cite news

My driver and I were held separately in two interrogation rooms. I found the whole experience threatening. I was questioned about the contents of my briefcase." Despite initial reports to the contrary, the singer's van, which was full of musical equipment, was not searched. "I was questioned about lyrics of songs and I was asked a lot of personal questions about members of my family and my children and about my home. At no time was I given any explanation as to why I was being held and interrogated in this manner", he added. He said the fact that Irish people are still being treated this way on their way to Britain is very "saddening". "I had hoped to deal with this matter out of the public domain. But seeing as it has become a news item, I feel the need to offer my side of the story. I found the whole affair quite frightening."<ref>{{cite web
