== History ==

=== 2006–10: Early years and formation ===
Scott "[[Kid Cudi]]" Mescudi and Oladipo "[[Dot da Genius]]" Omishore met through a mutual friend, with whom Cudi once worked at [[Abercrombie & Fitch]].<ref name="Complex">{{cite web|author=Joe La Puma|title=WZRD: Band Of Brothers (2012 Online Cover Story)|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/wzrd-kid-cudi-dot-da-genius-online-cover-story|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=February 27, 2012|access-date=March 12, 2012}}</ref> After working together for about seven months, Cudi was being evicted from his apartment. With plans to move back to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Dot da Genius' parents allowed Cudi to stay with them and their family, so the two could continue working together and pursue their music careers.<ref name="Complex" />

In addition to being very good friends, Dot da Genius has produced some of Kid Cudi's earliest work from his [[Demo (music)|demos]],<ref>[http://headbangamuzik.com/2010/02/kid-cudi-highs-n-lows-produced-by-dot/ Kid Cudi - Highs 'n' Lows] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120714154501/http://headbangamuzik.com/2010/02/kid-cudi-highs-n-lows-produced-by-dot/ |date=2012-07-14 }} Headbangamuzik.com</ref> to songs on his critically acclaimed mixtape ''[[A Kid Named Cudi]]'' (2008), which was Cudi's breakout project and the first to feature their [[hit single]] "[[Day 'n' Nite]]". Since then they have worked together on Cudi's debut album ''[[Man on the Moon: The End of Day]]'' (2009) as well as his second album, ''[[Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cratekings.com/dot-da-genius-interview-kid-cudi-music-school-preferred-equipment/|title=Dot Da Genius Interview: Kid Cudi, Music School, Preferred Equipment|access-date=21 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://datnewcudi.com/2009/08/27/interview-with-dot-da-genius-part-1/|title=Interview with Dot Da Genius – Part 1|access-date=21 November 2014}}</ref> It wasn't until they were recording "Trapped in My Mind" for Cudi's second album, that ideas of a rock album surfaced. In an interview with [[Complex (magazine)|''Complex'' magazine]], Dot da Genius recounted the recording session: "It was pretty much the same time that we built a studio in Cudi's crib. We did "Trapped In My Mind" and we were dwelling on it like, "This is crazy, we need to put some [[guitar riff]]s on this." So I had my homie B-rent, come through Cudi's crib with his guitar, and Cudi did the guitar riff with his mouth cause Cudi couldn't play the guitar. So Brent replayed it. Then Cudi picked up [Brent's] guitar and started fiddling around with it, and I swear to you within like five minutes, he had a legitimate guitar riff. He never played a guitar a day in his life, but had an ill riff that we could make a song with."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2010/11/dot-da-genius-talks-wizard-his-rock-band-with-kid-cudi|title=Dot Da Genius Talks Wizard, His Rock Band With Kid Cudi|author=Complex Mag|work=Complex|access-date=21 November 2014}}</ref>

With that being said, we have decided to change the release date. We are looking roughly at Feb 28th. Y'all know how Cudi is' and I'm the same way. Everything has to be in place and now it is. I know it's late notice, we were trying to keep the date but got wrapped up making this album perfect for y'all. However for making you guys wait a little longer we will release 'Brake' & 'Teleport 2 Me' on iTunes on the previously said date. AS WELL AS 'DOSE OF DOPENESS'.
