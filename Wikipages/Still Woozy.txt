==Early life==
Sven Gamsky was born on June 23, 1992, in [[Oakland, California]], and grew up in [[Moraga, California]]. He is the youngest of three sons born to Dr. Tom and Berit (Fuglsang) Gamsky, and has two older brothers, Nate and Sam.<ref>https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/05/01/10-in-boy-scout-troop-212-receive-eagle-awards/</ref> Sven started playing the guitar when he was in middle school.

All three of the Gamsky brothers became [[Eagle Scouts]]. Sven was a part of Moraga Boy Scout Troop 212, in which his service project toward becoming an Eagle Scout involved remodeling a garden area at Donald L. Rheem Elementary School in Moraga. The [[East Bay Times]] reported in 2010 upon his achievement of Eagle Scout that "Sven plans to travel and volunteer after high school, and eventually study psychology in college."<ref>https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/05/28/four-moraga-scouts-are-now-eagles/</ref>

Sven Gamsky attended [[Campolindo High School]] in Moraga, graduating in 2010. While in high school, he played guitar and bass in the band "Shoot for Roots". At the beginning of their senior year, "Shoot for Roots" won a Battle of the Bands competition hosted by the Lamorinda Teen Center. They had initially come to a tie with a band called IceBox Business from rival high school, [[Miramonte High School]], but fans from Campolindo High broke the tie by cheering louder for Gamsky's band with a recording of 116 decibels.<ref>http://www.lamorindaweekly.com/archive/issue0315/Battle-of-the-Bands.html</ref>

== Career ==
After high school, Gamsky earned money by teaching guitar in the Oakland area and playing with the band Feed Me Jack at jazz clubs, festivals, and orchestra halls. He graduated from [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 2015, majoring in music with a classical guitar emphasis, and minoring in electronic music.<ref>https://takelessons.com/profile/sven-g</ref>

From 2011 to 2016, Gamsky was in the [[alternative rock]]/[[math rock]] band [[Feed Me Jack]], <ref>{{Cite web|title=Sven Gamsky of Feed Me Jack Is Still Good as Still Woozy|url=https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/1/22/sven-gamsky-feed-jack-still-good-still-woozy/|last=Du|first=Lucas|date=January 21, 2019|website=[[The Chicago Maroon]]|language=en|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Feed Me Jack|url=https://goodtimes.sc/santa-cruz-arts-entertainment/santa-cruz-music/love-your-local-santa-cruz-band/feed-me-jack/|last=Vernin|first=Nick|date=2013-10-02|website=[[Good Times (newspaper)|Good Times Santa Cruz]]|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> which released four albums before disbanding, on good terms, in 2016 for members to individually pursue their careers in music. <ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Feed Me Jack|url=https://www.facebook.com/feedmejack/posts/956462031127948|website=Facebook|language=en|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://feedmejack.bandcamp.com/|title=Ultra Ego, by Feed Me Jack|website=Feed Me Jack|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> The following year Gamsky released his first single, "Vacation", under the stage name Still Woozy,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Still Woozy, a confident awkward|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/section/music/still-woozy-live-confident-awkward|last=Cantie|first=Samantha|website=[[The Michigan Daily]]|language=en|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Still Woozy's #TBT Mixtape: Listen|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8508751/listen-oakland-electronic-folk-artist-still-woozy-tbt-mixtape-playlist|date=2019-04-25|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> stating that he chose the name because of his spaced-out nature.<ref name=":0" /> As Still Woozy, Gamsky has released an EP and several singles,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Capitol Hill Block Party 2019 Must-See: Still Woozy|url=https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/07/16/40768874/capitol-hill-block-party-2019-must-see-still-woozy|last=Polk|first=Leilani|date=July 16, 2019|website=The Stranger|language=en|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> for which Ami Cooks created the album covers, and four music videos, the first of which was released in 2017.<ref>{{Citation|title=Still Woozy - Cooks (Official Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXoC_VhzX9I|work=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Sven Gamsky's Still Woozy Is a Gentle Giant of Indie Pop|url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/features/article/21044473/sven-gamskys-still-woozy-is-a-gentle-giant-of-indie-pop|website=Nashville Scene|language=en|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> Gamsky prefers to release music as soon as possible and will sometimes release a song on the same day he has finished making it.<ref name=":0" />
