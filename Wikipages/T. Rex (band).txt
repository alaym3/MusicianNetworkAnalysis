'''T. Rex''' were <!-- Per WP:ENGVAR, British English uses the plural form for bands. Therefore, "are" should NOT be changed to "is". --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in 1967 by singer-songwriter and guitarist [[Marc Bolan]]. The band was initially called '''Tyrannosaurus Rex''', and released four  albums under this name - three [[psychedelic folk]] and one mellow [[psychedelic rock]].  In 1969, while developing the style for the fourth album, Bolan began to change the band's style towards electric rock, and shortened their name to T. Rex the following year. This development culminated in 1970 with the song "[[Ride a White Swan]]", and the group soon became pioneers of the [[glam rock]] movement.

From 1970 to 1973, T. Rex encountered a popularity in the UK comparable to that of [[the Beatles]], with a run of eleven singles in the UK top ten. They scored four UK number one hits, "[[Hot Love (T. Rex song)|Hot Love]]", "[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]", "[[Telegram Sam]]" and "[[Metal Guru]]". The band's 1971 album ''[[Electric Warrior]]'' received critical acclaim as a pioneering glam rock album: it reached number 1 in the UK. The 1972 follow-up, ''[[The Slider]]'', entered the top 20 in the US. Bolstering their style with [[soul music]], [[funk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]], the band released ''[[Tanx]]'' in 1973 which reached the top 5 in several countries. From 1974, T. Rex's appeal began to wane, though the band continued releasing one album per year. They blended rock with [[R&B]] influences, and occasionally incorporated [[disco]] elements in their music, on subsequent releases before returning to a stripped-down sound.

In 1977, founder, songwriter and sole constant member Bolan died in a car crash several months after the release of the group's final studio album ''[[Dandy in the Underworld]]'', and the group disbanded. T. Rex have continued to influence a variety of subsequent artists. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Class of 2020 |url=https://www.rockhall.com/class-2020-inductees |access-date=15 January 2020 |agency=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and psychedelic folk (July 1967 – mid-1970)===
Marc Bolan founded Tyrannosaurus Rex in July 1967, following a handful of failed solo singles and a brief career as lead guitarist in psych-rock band [[John's Children]]. After a solitary disastrous performance as a four-piece electric rock band on 22 July at the Electric Garden in London's [[Covent Garden]] alongside drummer Steve Porter plus two older musicians: guitarist Ben Cartland and an unknown bassist, the group immediately broke up.<ref name="cliff">''Marc Bolan 1947-1977 A Chronology'' - Cliff McLenehan, Helter Skelter Publishing 2002, p25</ref><ref name="markp">Paytress, Mark. ''Bolan: The Rise and Fall of a 20th Century Superstar''. Omnibus Press. 2003</ref> Subsequently, Bolan retained the band name and the services of Porter, who switched to percussion under the name Steve Peregrin Took, and the two began performing acoustic material as a duo with a repertoire of folk-influenced Bolan-penned songs. Inspired by an influential performance by [[Ravi Shankar]] whom Bolan had seen while touring West Germany with John's Children, the band adopted a stage manner resembling the performance of traditional Indian music.<ref name="markp" /><ref name="Auslander Perf Glam">{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Phillip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=9780472068685 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BV6SnnkAU9IC&q=Marc+Bolan+Eastern+influence&pg=PA92 |access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref>

The combination of Bolan's [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]] and distinctive vocal style with Took's [[Bongo drum|bongos]] and assorted percussion—which often included children's instruments such as the [[Pixiphone]]—earned them a devoted following in the thriving [[hippy]] underground scene. [[BBC Radio One]] Disc jockey [[John Peel]] championed the band early in their recording career.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2JYRaGZ8JJIC&pg=PA122 Stand and Deliver: The Autobiography] Pan Macmillan, 2007</ref> Peel later appeared on record with them, reading stories written by Bolan. Another key collaborator was producer [[Tony Visconti]], who went on to produce the band's albums well into their second, [[glam rock]] phase.<ref name=VIS>Philip Auslander [https://books.google.com/books?id=BV6SnnkAU9IC&pg=PA84&dq=tony+visconti+t.rex&hl=en&ei=d-IETZSrNseZOouM6aYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=tony%20visconti%20t.rex&f=false Performing glam rock: gender and theatricality in popular music] University of Michigan Press, 2006</ref> Their debut album ''[[My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows|My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair...]]'' remained in the [[UK Albums chart]] for nine weeks and peaked at number 15.<ref name=ukchart /> Their second album ''[[Prophets, Seers & Sages: The Angels of the Ages|Prophets, Seers & Sages]]'' was released a few months later.

During 1968–1969, Tyrannosaurus Rex had become a modest success on radio and on record. Their third single "Pewter Suitor", released in January 1969, failed to chart but their third album ''[[Unicorn (Tyrannosaurus Rex album)|Unicorn]]'' came within striking distance of the [[UK Albums Chart|UK Top 10 Albums]].<ref name=ukchart /> While Bolan's early solo material was [[rock and roll]]-influenced pop music, by now he was writing dramatic and [[baroque]] songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Persian mythology]] as well as poetic creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain's student union halls.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1960s/1969/Nov17trex/ BBC – Radion 1 – Keeping it Peel  – 17/11/1969] ''[[BBC Radio One]]''</ref>

Their fourth single "King of the Rumbling Spires" issued in July, was a musical departure compared to the previous material: they used a full rock band setup with a drumkit and an entirely electric sound.  However, by mid-1969 there was a rift developing between the two halves of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Bolan and his girlfriend June Child were living a quiet life, Bolan working on his book of poetry entitled ''The Warlock of Love'' and concentrating on his songs and performance skills. Took, however, had fully embraced the anti-commercial, [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]-taking ethos of the [[UK Underground]] scene centred around [[Ladbroke Grove]]. Took was also attracted to anarchic elements such as [[Mick Farren]]/[[The Deviants (band)|Deviants]] and members of the [[Pink Fairies]] Rock 'n' Roll and Drinking Club.<ref name="TR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.steve-took.co.uk |title=Steve Took's Domain |publisher=Steve-took.co.uk |date=27 October 2011 |access-date=29 February 2012}}</ref> Took also began writing his own songs, and wanted the duo to perform them, but Bolan strongly disapproved of his bandmate's efforts, rejecting them for the duo's putative fourth album, in production in Spring/Summer 1969. In response to Bolan's rebuff, Took contributed two songs as well as vocals and percussion to [[Twink (musician)|Twink]]'s ''[[Think Pink]]'' album.<ref>Sleevenotes by Dave Thompson to CD ''The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus Rex'' Cleopatra Records CLEO 9528-2 1995</ref>

Behind the scenes, Bolan's relationship with Took ended after this dispute, although they were contractually obliged to go through with a US tour which was doomed before it began. Poorly promoted and planned, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, Took drew from the [[shock rock]] style of [[Iggy Pop]]; Took explained, "I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of [[Los Angeles]] shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach."<ref>[https://stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/a/interviews/5-nme-oct-72 ''Steve Took - From Bolan Boogie To Gutter Rock''],  [[Charles Shaar Murray]]. [[NME]] 14 October 1972</ref>

As soon as Bolan returned to the UK in September, he replaced Took with percussionist [[Mickey Finn (drummer)|Mickey Finn]].<ref name=VIS/> and they completed the fourth album, released in early 1970 as ''[[A Beard of Stars]]'', the final album under the Tyrannosaurus Rex moniker. This line up headlined the very first [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 1970.<ref name=hist1970>{{cite web|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/history-1970/|title=1970 (19 September)|work=History|publisher=Glastonbury Festival|access-date=29 June 2011}}</ref> As well as progressively shorter titles, Tyrannosaurus Rex's albums began to show higher production values, more accessible songwriting from Bolan, and experimentation with electric guitars and a true rock sound.<ref name=REX>[https://books.google.com/books?id=60Jde3l7WNwC&pg=PA96&dq=T.Rex+band&hl=en&ei=DdoETcLSKJHoOdfvtaYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=T.Rex%20band&f=false Legends of rock guitar: the essential reference of rock's greatest guitarists] Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997</ref>

===Glam rock and commercial success (July 1970 – December 1972)===
Bolan continued the process of simplification by shortening the band's name to T. Rex.<ref name="Pretty Face (Thompson)" /> The new sound was more pop-oriented, and the first single, "[[Ride a White Swan]]" recorded in July and released in October 1970 made the Top 10 in the UK by late November and would soon reach number 2.<ref name=ukchart /> Ticket fees were reduced to 10 shillings/50p to attract a younger audience.<ref>Bramley, John (2017).</ref> The eponymous first ''[[T.

|title=T. Rex – "Hot Love"
|description=
|format=[[Ogg]]}}

"Ride a White Swan" was quickly followed by a second single, "[[Hot Love (T. Rex song)|Hot Love]]", which reached the top spot on the UK charts, and remained there for six weeks.<ref name=ukchart />  Between these two releases, Bolan first recruited bassist [[Steve Currie]] then drummer [[Bill Legend]] to form a full band to record and tour to growing audiences.  After Chelita Secunda added two spots of glitter under Bolan's eyes before an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for which Bolan wore shiny satin trousers and a shiny jacket (from Chelsea boutique Alkasura) in place of his previous hippy clothes, soon followed by another appearance for the show on which he wore a silver velvet/satin sailor suit, the ensuing performances would often be viewed as the birth of glam rock.

After Bolan's displays, glam rock would gain popularity in the UK and Europe during 1971–1972. The completion of T. Rex's move to electric guitar rock coincided with Bolan's more overtly sexual lyrical style and image. Having already begun standing up onstage to perform electric songs, Bolan also incorporated more physical showmanship, such as struts, dances and poses, into his stage act.  The group's new image and sound quickly attracted a new audience much to the despair of the band's early fans. Some of the lyrical content of Tyrannosaurus Rex remained, but the poetic, surrealistic lyrics were now interspersed with sensuous grooves, orgiastic moans and innuendo.

In September 1971, T. Rex released ''[[Electric Warrior]]'', which featured Currie and Legend. Often considered to be their best album, the chart-topping ''Electric Warrior'' brought much commercial success to the group;<ref name=ukchart>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/2746/t-rex/ |title=T. Rex uk charts |publisher=officialcharts.com |access-date= 2 February 2016}}</ref> publicist [[BP Fallon]] coined the term "T. Rextasy" as a parallel to [[Beatlemania]] to describe the group's popularity.<ref name="Shock and Awe">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-first Century |date=2016 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=9780062279811 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKupCgAAQBAJ&q=T.+Rex+Wax+Co. |access-date=3 August 2019}}</ref> The album included T. Rex's best-known song, "[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]", which hit number one in the UK. In January 1972 it became a top ten hit in the US, where the song was retitled "Bang a Gong (Get It On)". The album still recalled Bolan's acoustic roots with ballads such as "Cosmic Dancer" and the stark "Girl". Soon after, Bolan left [[Fly Records]]; after his contract had lapsed, the label released the album track "[[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]]" as a single without his permission. Bolan went to [[EMI]], where he was given his own record label in the UK—T. Rex Records, the "T. Rex Wax Co."<ref name="markp" />
 
The band released the singles "[[Telegram Sam]]" and "[[Metal Guru]]" respectively in January and in May 1972, and both became number one hits in the UK.<ref name=ukchart /> In May, Bolan's old label Fly released the chart-topping compilation album ''[[Bolan Boogie]]'', a collection of singles, B-sides and LP tracks, which affected  sales of the band's forthcoming album. When  it was released in July, ''[[The Slider]]'' peaked at number four in the UK,<ref name=ukchart /> and it became their most successful album in the US, entering the top 20 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band then released two other standalone singles "[[Children of the Revolution (song)|Children of the Revolution]]" and "[[Solid Gold Easy Action]]" which both reached number 2 in the UK. In December, Bolan's own rock film ''[[Born to Boogie]]'' was released  to theatres. The film featured two T. Rex shows at the [[Wembley Arena|Empire Pool, Wembley]], which had been shot by [[Ringo Starr]] and his crew earlier in the year.

===Transition, decline and resurgence (January 1973 – September 1977) ===
[[Image:Marc Bolan In Concert 1973.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Bolan performing on ABC's ''[[In Concert (American TV series)|In Concert]]'', 1973]]
''[[Tanx]]'' was a commercial success, reaching number 3 in the German Albums chart,<ref name=swedish /> number 4 in the UK,<ref name=ukchart /> and number 5 in Norway.<ref name=swedish>{{cite web |url=https://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=T%2E+Rex&titel=Tanx&cat=a |title=T. Rex - ''Tanx'' World wide: charts |publisher=Swedishcharts.com|access-date= 2 April 2021}}</ref> An eclectic album containing several melancholy ballads and rich production, ''Tanx'' showcased the T. Rex sound bolstered by extra instrumental embellishments such as [[Mellotron]] and saxophone. "The Street and Babe Shadow" was [[funk]]ier while the last song "Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys" was seen by critics as a nod to [[gospel music|gospel]] with several female backing singers.<ref name="Deusner">{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11846-tanx-zip-gun-futuristic-dragon-work-in-progress/ |title=T.

Rex song)|The Groover]]" marked the end of the golden era in which T. Rex scored 11 singles in a row in the UK top ten.

''[[Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow]]'' was released in February 1974, and reached number 12 in the UK. Musically, the band ventured into [[blue eyed soul]] and blended rock with funk and [[R & B]] influences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/zinc-alloy-and-the-hidden-riders-of-tomorrow-mw0000534755 |title=''Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow'' – Marc Bolan & T. Rex |last=Thompson |first=Dave |author-link=Dave Thompson (author) |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=8 February 2015}}</ref> Lyrically, the album harkened back to the Tyrannosaurus Rex days with long song titles and lyrical complexity, but was not a critical success. In the US, Warner Brothers dropped the band without releasing the album. Bill Legend stopped working with Bolan at that time. T. Rex had an extended line-up which included second guitarist [[Jack Green (musician)|Jack Green]] and [[B. J. Cole]] on pedal steel. Soon after the album's release, Bolan split with producer Visconti, then in December 1974, Finn also left the band. A single, "[[Zip Gun Boogie]]", appeared in late 1974 credited as a Marc Bolan solo effort (though still on the T. Rex label). It only reached UK No. 41, and the T. Rex band identity was quickly re-established.

''[[Bolan's Zip Gun]]'' (1975) saw the group further developing the soul and funk of previous records. Most of the material had already been released the previous year in the US as ''[[Light of Love]]''. It was self-produced by Bolan who, in addition to writing the songs, gave his music a harder, more futuristic sheen. Bolan's own productions were not well received in the music press. However, in the US, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine gave it a positive review.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ken|last=Barnes|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/light-of-love-245761|title=T. Rex Light of Love|publisher=RollingStone|date=26 September 1974|access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref> During this time Bolan became increasingly isolated, while high tax rates in the UK drove him into [[tax exile|exile]] in Monte Carlo and the US. No longer a vegetarian, Bolan put on weight due to consumption of hamburgers and alcohol, and was ridiculed in the music press.

T. Rex's penultimate album, ''[[Futuristic Dragon]]'' (1976), featured an inconsistent production style that veered from [[Wall of Sound]]-style songs to [[disco]] backing, with nostalgic nods to the old T. Rex boogie machine. It only managed to reach number 50, but the album was better received by the critics and featured the singles "[[New York City (T. Rex song)|New York City]]" (number 15 in the UK) and "[[Dreamy Lady]]" (number 30).<ref name=ukchart /> The latter was promoted as T. Rex Disco Party. To promote the album, the band toured the UK, and performed on television shows such as ''Top of the Pops'', ''Supersonic'' and ''Get It Together''.

In the summer of 1976, T. Rex released two more singles, "[[I Love to Boogie]]" (which charted at number 13) and "[[Laser Love (T. Rex song)|Laser Love]]", which made number 42.<ref name=ukchart /> In early 1977 ''[[Dandy in the Underworld]]'' was released to critical acclaim. Bolan had slimmed down and regained his elfin looks, and the songs too had a stripped-down, streamlined sound. A spring UK tour with [[punk rock|punk]] band [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] on support garnered positive reviews. As Bolan was enjoying a new surge in popularity, he talked about performing again with Finn and Took, as well as reuniting with Visconti.

===Bolan's death and disbandment===
