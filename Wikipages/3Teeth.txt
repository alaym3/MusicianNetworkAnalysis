'''3Teeth''' (stylized as 3TEETH or 3T3ETH) is an American [[industrial metal]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Formed in 2013, the band currently consists of Alexis Mincolla (vocals), Chase Brawner (guitars), Xavier Swafford (keys & synth), Andrew Means (modular synth & bass), and Nick Rossi (drums). They have currently released three studio albums: their [[3Teeth (album)|self-titled]] debut in 2014, ''[[Shutdown.exe (album)|<shutdown.exe>]]'' in 2017, and ''[[Metawar]]'' on July 5, 2019, via [[Century Media Records]].

==History==
===Name and formation===
The group initially formed as a fun passion-project between Mincolla and Swafford,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/musicians/lex-mincolla-3teeth.htm|title=Metal-Temple.com :: Lex Mincolla (3Teeth) (Interview)|website=Metal-temple.com|language=EN|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref> who lived down the street from each other in Los Angeles.<ref name="AllMusic1">{{cite web|first=Neil|last=Yeung|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/3teeth-mn0003225831|title=3Teeth Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 10, 2019}}</ref> Mincolla did not have a musical background but had experience in visual arts and promotion. Mincolla and Swafford met at a weekly party called Lil Death,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brutalresonance.com/interview/3teeth-interview-jun-2014/|title=Interview: 3Teeth - Interview Jun 2014 {{!}} Brutal Resonance|website=www.brutalresonance.com|language=en|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref> which was hosted by Mincolla, where they began discussing some ideas for a multi-media mix of visuals and music.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/3-teeth-brings-alexis-mincolla-back-to-miami-6483132|title=3 Teeth Brings Alexis Mincolla Back to Miami|last=Duran|first=Jose D.|date=September 4, 2014|website=Miami New Times|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref> The two soon met Andrew Means after being impressed by an online video he sent the pair which Mincolla described as looking "like a computer virus."<ref name="auto"/>

After some of their music was hosted online and began to gain traction, the three sought out a guitarist for the project. Guitar work had initially been outsourced but the turnaround time was slow. Means had grown up with Brawner and suggested that the trio audition him, and after a successful audition Chase joined and 3Teeth had officially formed.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altvenger.com/alexis-mincolla-talks-about-3teeth/|title=Alexis Mincolla talks about 3Teeth {{!}} Altvenger Magazine|language=en-GB|access-date=December 28, 2018}}</ref>

The band took the name 3Teeth from the concepts of Odontomancy, which Mincolla described as an ancient form of divination where "the seer would read prophecies in the teeth like rune stones."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brutalresonance.com/interview/3teeth-interview-jun-2014/|title=3Teeth|website=Brutalresonance.com|access-date=July 5, 2019}}</ref> as well as the word trident, which comes from Latin for "three teeth." Mincolla said of the trident: "...this divine weapon of God that brings destruction. It's what Marduk killed Tiamat with -- this caught thunderbolt or trident."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stufftoblowyourmind.com/blogs/3teeths-alexis-mincolla-talks-industrial-music-robert-anton-wilson.htm|title=3Teeth's Mincolla Talks Esoterism, Music and Art|date=January 13, 2016|website=Stuff to Blow Your Mind|language=en|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref>

The original line-up consisted of Mincolla, Brawner, Swafford, and Means, with Andrew Means performing live drums on an electric kit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dola.com/artists/andrew-means-3teeth|title=Andrew Means - 3Teeth|website=Dola.com|access-date=July 5, 2019}}</ref> Andrew Melendez joined as a live drummer the spring and summer tours in 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/6dbd50/im_alexis_mincolla_lead_singer_of_the_industrial/|title=r/Music - I'm Alexis Mincolla , lead singer of the industrial metal band 3Teeth.

The band signed to Century Media Records in April 2018 with Hanson being announced as the official fifth member of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/artist.aspx?IdArtist=1975|title=Century Media Records - 3Teeth|website=www.centurymedia.com|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref> Nick Rossi joined the live band in Fall 2019 as a temporary replacement for Hanson, who had injured his foot on the European tour earlier that year. In June 2020, the band announced that they had mutually parted ways with Hanson and that Rossi would be joining them as the new drummer to commence recording on the band's fourth album.
