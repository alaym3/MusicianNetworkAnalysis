== Early life ==
Ashton Fletcher Irwin was born on 7 July 1994 in [[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]], [[New South Wales]]. His father, who is an American, left the family when Irwin was two years old. His mother, Anne-Marie, struggled with alcoholism,<ref name=":72">{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Rachel|date=2018-08-07|title="I've always been terribly afraid of becoming an alcoholic:" 5SOS's Ashton Irwin on facing demons|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/ashton-irwin-5sos-alcoholic-fears/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109174341/https://www.altpress.com/features/ashton-irwin-5sos-alcoholic-fears/|archive-date=9 January 2019|access-date=2020-05-24|website=Alternative Press}}</ref> and as a result, he spent his childhood "hanging out with drunk people at pubs".<ref name=":82">{{cite web|title=Ashton Irwin|url=https://people.com/archive/ashton-irwin/|access-date=2020-05-24|website=People}}</ref> He later elaborated, "My upbringing is […] interesting, I didn’t have a father, my mom has struggled with alcoholism my whole life. I’ve grown up kind of bringing other people up…I’ve had to be relentlessly positive, and I have a very depressed mind".<ref name=":72" /> Irwin frequently moved houses as a child, mainly residing in [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]] and [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]].<ref name=":82" /> Irwin's mother "didn't have a lot of money" and as a result, Irwin would "struggle to eat from week to week".<ref>{{Cite web|title=5SOS's Ashton on his childhood: 'We'd struggle to eat from week to week at times'|url=https://www.pressparty.com/pg/newsdesk/londonnewsdesk/view/116475/|access-date=2020-08-07|website=Pressparty|language=en}}</ref>

Irwin's uncle was a drummer in a [[Death metal|death-metal]] band and his step-father played drums in a [[Punk rock|punk-rock]] band.<ref name=":82" /> Irwin learned how to play drums at nine years old after asking his step-father to teach him.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sound Legacy - Ashton Irwin of 5 Seconds of Summer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfLsWyXnzjM|access-date=2020-07-23|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Irwin helped raise his younger siblings, half-brother Harry and half-sister Lauren, whilst attending [[Richmond High School (Richmond, New South Wales)|Richmond High School]], from which he graduated in 2012.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hey, Lets Make a Band!|year=2014|isbn=9780062366443|pages=15|last1=Summer|first1=5.

In late 2011, Irwin received a [[Facebook]] message from friend and future band-mate, [[Michael Clifford (musician)|Michael Clifford]], asking if Irwin was interested in casually playing music with him, [[Calum Hood]] and [[Luke Hemmings]].
