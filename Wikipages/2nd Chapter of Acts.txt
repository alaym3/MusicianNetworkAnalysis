The '''2nd Chapter of Acts''' was a [[Jesus music]] and early [[contemporary Christian music]] group composed of sisters [[Annie Herring]] and Nelly Greisen and brother [[Matthew Ward (singer)|Matthew Ward]]. They began performing in 1972<ref>{{cite work|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/My_Second_Chapter/585FkqzizqQC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22Hollywood+Professional+School%22+%22Bertinelli%22&pg=PA63&printsec=frontcover|page=63-67|author=Matthew Ward|title=My Second Chapter The Matthew Ward Story|year=2010|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]]}}</ref> and enjoyed their period of greatest success during the 1970s. The group disbanded in 1988.

== History ==

The 2nd Chapter of Acts began as a result of the trio singing at home together as Annie played the piano. Following the death of their parents (Elizabeth in 1968 and Walter Ward in 1970),<ref>Booklet included with compilation ''20'' (1992), chapter "Simple Faith", section "Trouble at Home".</ref> Nelly and Matthew, still [[minor (law)|minors]], moved in with their older sister, Annie, and her husband, recording engineer and producer, Buck Herring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matthewward.com/bio_past.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610191228/http://www.matthewward.com/bio_past.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Matthew Ward Biography: 2nd Chapter of Acts|archive-date=June 10, 2004|access-date=Apr 6, 2020}}</ref> Annie was a self-taught singer and songwriter who composed and played her songs around the family piano.  Her brother and sister would often join in as she played, and eventually they developed extremely tight and intricate harmonies.<ref name="EofCCM">{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark Allan |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |year=2002 |location=Peabody, Massachusetts |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |page=801 |quote="2nd Chaper was better than any of those groups--they had a more consistent songeriter, stronger vocals and, especially, tighter harmonies" }}</ref><ref name="2ndchapterofacts.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.2ndchapterofacts.com/articles/frame-picture.htm |title=The Frame Never Outdid the Picture: The 2nd Chapter of Acts Story |publisher=2ndchapterofacts.com |access-date=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927104502/http://www.2ndchapterofacts.com/articles/frame-picture.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

They started singing for local coffee houses and small gatherings, then gained the notice of [[Pat Boone]] who arranged a contract to record and release two singles with MGM, "Jesus Is" (1972) and "I'm So Happy" (1973). The fledgling trio also came to the attention of 1960s folk singer [[Barry McGuire]], who had recently become a Christian and was preparing to record his first Christian music album, produced by Buck Herring. The siblings provided background vocals for ''Seeds'' and McGuire's 1974 follow-up ''Lighten Up''.

The trio released their debut album, ''[[With Footnotes]]'', in 1974. This album featured "[[Easter Song]]" which would become a signature piece for the group and has been recorded by many other artists since. This was followed up with ''[[In the Volume of the Book]]'' in 1975, the year that also saw the release of a live album with Barry McGuire, ''[[To the Bride]]'', which included "[[a band called David]]", who supported 2nd Chapter of Acts on tour. 2nd Chapter of Acts' first three releases were issued by [[Myrrh Records]], and the group toured with McGuire intermittently for three years.

The group went on a touring hiatus in 1976. Annie released her first solo record on the [[Sparrow Records]] label founded that year by the executive who had signed them to the Myrrh label, [[Billy Ray Hearn]]. For the summer of 1977, they were joined on an 18-city tour by [[Phil Keaggy]] and the result was the live triple album, ''[[How the West Was One (2nd Chapter of Acts album)|How the West Was One]]''. Their contract with Myrrh fulfilled, they moved as a group to Sparrow.<ref name="2ndchapterofacts.com"/>

Their Sparrow debut, ''[[Mansion Builder]]'' (1978) was followed up with ''[[The Roar of Love]]'' (1980) (a concept album inspired by [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]''), ''[[Rejoice (2nd Chapter of Acts album)|Rejoice]]'' (1981), ''[[Singer Sower]]'' (1983), and ''[[Together Live]]'' (1983) (with [[Michael Omartian|Michael]] and [[Stormie Omartian]]).  2nd Chapter moved to their own Live Oak label with the release of ''[[Night Light (2nd Chapter of Acts album)|Night Light]]'' in 1985, and their final recording of original material, ''[[Far Away Places (2nd Chapter of Acts album)|Faraway Places]]'' in 1987.

Their voices can be heard among other Christian artists on two benefit singles in 1985.  ''Do Something Now!'' credited to ''The Cause'' on [[Sparrow Records]] to aid famine relief in Africa and ''Fight the Fight, Rescue the Unborn'' which featured over 100 Christian artists, to benefit the Christian Pro-Life Movement, released on Live Oak.

2nd Chapter of Acts broadened their appeal with the release of [[Hymns (2nd Chapter of Acts album)|Hymns]] and [[Hymns 2]], reaching audiences with more traditional music. ''Hymns'' proved to be their best-selling release, receiving a [[Dove Award]] for "Best Praise and Worship Album of the Year" in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doveawards.com/history.php?x=artist |title=Dove Award History Artist |publisher=Doveawards.com |access-date=2011-11-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605031050/http://www.doveawards.com/history.php?x=artist |archive-date=2012-06-05 }}</ref>

Except for two sabbatical years in 1976 and 1983, 2nd Chapter of Acts continued to tour until 1988. Their final concert was in Houston, Texas on August 12 of that year.<ref name="2ndchapterofacts.com"/>

2nd Chapter was recognized by the [[Gospel Music Association]] in 1999 by their induction into its [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmahalloffame.org/site/?page_id=84 |title=Gospel Music Hall of Fame: Year of 1999 |publisher=Gmahalloffame.org |access-date=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929144220/http://www.gmahalloffame.org/site/?page_id=84 |archive-date=2011-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Annie and Matthew also recorded several solo projects during the 2nd Chapter of Acts years. Both have continued to release new material and perform concerts as of 2011.

== Roles of group members ==

Annie was the main songwriter of the group and the only one who played an instrument (piano). Her admittedly unschooled compositional style, with its frequent irregular rhythms, added somewhat progressive rock-like elements to what was otherwise a soft-rock sound. Matthew and Nelly initially made the occasional small contribution to the lyrics, and Matthew developed as a songwriter for the group as his solo career grew.

Annie and Matthew sang most of the solo parts. Nelly — whose voice could be hard to distinguish from Annie's — usually sang lead only on songs where each member took a verse ("Which Way The Wind Blows", "Something Tells Me", "Takin' The Easy Way") or on solo pieces without the others singing backup ("I Don't Wanna Go Home", "Make My Life a Prayer" and "Mountain Tops"). Vocal leads such as in "My Jesus I Love Thee" and "Sing Over Me", where she was backed by the others, were rare exceptions. Her voice was considered the "glue" to the 2nd Chapter of Acts sound, and her harmony parts were generally the most difficult to sing.
