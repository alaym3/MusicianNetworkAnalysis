In January 2011, Marcus Dysch writing for ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' about the involvement of Lowkey in the Palestine Solidarity Campaign commented: "One expert studying anti-Israel activity described the increasing influence of performers such as Lowkey as a 'potential nightmare,' and compared the impact of his backing for the campaign to the effect of artists such as [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Elvis Costello]] "attacking the Jewish state."<ref>[http://www.thejc.com/node/44347 Palestine Solidarity Campaign hits the youth trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195601/http://www.thejc.com/node/44347 |date=4 March 2016 }} thejc.com, 27 January 2011</ref> [[Fox News]] host [[Glenn Beck]] mocked Lowkey on his radio show, poking fun at the lyrics of his song "Terrorist?", and recorded himself dancing to the song and showing gang signs in an effort to ridicule the content.<ref>[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/why-is-glenn-beck-dancing-throwing-up-gang-signs-and-listening-to-anti-american-rap/ Why is Glenn Beck dancing, throwing gang signs and listening to anti American rap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113082405/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/why-is-glenn-beck-dancing-throwing-up-gang-signs-and-listening-to-anti-american-rap/ |date=13 November 2012 }} theblaze.com, 10 February 2011</ref>

Lowkey has been a prominent member of the [[Stop the War Coalition]] and has spoken against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Furthermore, he has been a sharp critic of United States and British foreign policy, claiming that the two countries are only interested in supporting leaders who are under their influence or are willing to assist them. He also claims American media overlooks those within the country who do not believe in American military supremacy.<ref name="ceasefiremagazine.co.uk"/> In 2012, Lowkey turned down an opportunity to appear on [[Tim Westwood]] TV in protest, after Westwood chose to broadcast his show from the British military base [[Camp Bastion]] in Afghanistan.<ref name="auto">[https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/lowkey-no-to-westwood-tv/ Lowkey: Why I had to say no to Westwood TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023701/https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/lowkey-no-to-westwood-tv/ |date=4 March 2016 }} ceasefiremagazine.co.uk, Wednesday 25 January 2012</ref>
