'''Durand Jones & The Indications''' is an American [[contemporary R&B]] and soul group founded by the core songwriting trio of singer Durand Jones, singer/drummer Aaron Frazer, and guitarist Blake Rhein. Formed in 2012, the band came to prominence as part of the [[Retro-soul|soul revivalist]] movement around the time of the reissue of their debut album in 2018. Their second album ''American Love Call'' was released in March 2019, followed by ''Private Space'' in July 2021.
