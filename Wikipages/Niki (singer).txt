Zefanya has stated that she tries to empower Asians and Asian Americans through her music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popspoken.com/culture/2020/04/88risings-niki-opens-up-about-the-value-of-creative-freedom-and-pushing-past-her-anxieties|title= NIKI Opens Up About the Value of Creative Freedom and Pushing Past Her Anxieties|website=[[Popspoken]]|accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref> In the first [[Head in the Clouds Festival]], NIKI took a moment to address the 10,000-plus audience gathered in Los Angeles‚Äô Historic State Park. ‚ÄúI just want to say, as an Asian female, I do not take this day and this stage for granted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/08/241493/niki-zenfaya-head-in-the-clouds-88-rising-interview|title=NIKI Wants Asians To Own Their Heritage|last=Morin|first=Natalie|website=refinery29.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> My hope is that above everything else today, that you feel heard, you feel understood, but most of all that you feel represented."

After 88rising announced their collaboration with popular food festival [[626 Night Market]] to curate a food section at their second "[[Head in the Clouds Festival|Head in the Clouds]]" music festival, Zefanya made a special guest appearance with a meet-and-greet at the 626 Night Market event at [[Santa Anita Park]] in [[Arcadia, California]] on 11 August 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8509783/head-in-the-clouds-festival-adds-jackson-wang|title=Jackson Wang, iKON, DPR Live, Dumbfoundead Join Head in the Clouds 2019 Festival: Exclusive|website=Billboard|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref>

In September 2020, Zefanya released her debut genre-bending concept album ''[[Moonchild (NIKI album)|Moonchild]]''.<ref name="study-2" /> In an interview she was quoted saying,<blockquote>In terms of genre or sound, I wouldn‚Äôt even know how to describe this album. It doesn‚Äôt really fit into any box and I‚Äôm completely ok with that. I personally love projects like that ‚Äì ones that push boundaries and don‚Äôt adhere to any convention. Music is expressive; it‚Äôs art. Formulas get old and boring. I think that‚Äôs how this project differs from my past projects. I sort of just let go of any and all preconceived notions, rules and limitations I had in my head and just let my creativity take the wheel in any direction.<ref name="study-2" /></blockquote>In December 2020, Zefanya dropped "Hallway Weather," a holiday single reminiscent of her folk/indie roots. She says the song is in ‚Äúthe style of music & songwriting [she remembers] feeling most like [herself]. It is genuine & it is true.‚Äù<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1338321985542082561|user=nikizefanya|title=‚ÄòHallway Weather‚Äô out tomorrow üéÑ<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.

She has also said that she listens to and is influenced by all kinds of music.<ref name="study-2" /> She cites growing up in Indonesia as influencing her worldview, and in turn, her music. <ref name=":2" />
