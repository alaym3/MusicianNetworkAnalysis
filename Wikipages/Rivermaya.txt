'''Rivermaya''' is a Filipino alternative rock band. Formed in 1994, it is one of several bands like [[Eraserheads]] who spearheaded the 1990s [[Pinoy rock|Philippine alternative rock]] explosion.

Rivermaya is currently composed of original members [[Mark Escueta]] and [[Nathan Azarcon]], together with longest serving guitarist [[Mike Elgar]]. Notable former original members include chief songwriter [[Rico Blanco]] and vocalist [[Bamboo Mañalac]], who later formed the band [[Bamboo (band)|Bamboo]] and later went on his solo career.

Rivermaya is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the Philippines|top twenty-five best-selling artists]] in Philippine history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeoutbahrain.com/knowledge/features/10738-20-to-try-filipino-albums|title=20 to try: Filipino albums|date=September 23, 2009|website=Timeoutbahrain.com}}</ref>

==History==
===Earlier formation (1993)===
The band's predecessor consisted of Jesse Gonzales on vocals, [[Kenneth Ilagan]] on guitars, [[Nathan Azarcon]] on bass guitar, Rome Velayo on drums, and [[Rico Blanco]] on keyboards and backing vocals whom Azarcon recommended after hearing him play his portable piano rendition of Metallica's "Seek and Destroy" during the audition process. They were managed by Lizza Nakpil and director [[Chito S. Roño]] who had the intention of molding the group into a rock show band. The group was then called Xaga.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Classic line-up and mainstream success (1994–2001)===
In the process of grueling practice sessions, Azarcon's schoolmate [[Francisco "Bamboo" Mañalac]] replaced Gonzales who was asked to leave the band; Azarcon's childhood friend [[Mark Escueta]] replaced Velayo who left due to undisclosed reasons; and Ilagan, who later left the band due to personal reasons, was replaced with [[Perfecto de Castro|Perfecto "Perf" de Castro]] who owned the rehearsal studio where the band used to jam. With Bamboo as frontman, the band members disbanded Xaga and formed the band Rivermaya, a name initially suggested by de Castro. They started putting together original songs like "[[Ulan (Rivermaya song)|Ulan]]" [''Rain''], "214", and "Awit ng Kabataan" [''Song of the Youth''] (mostly composed by Rico Blanco) in demo form for prospective recording companies.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

By November 1994, the band had released its first album, the self-titled ''Rivermaya'', and its first single was "Ulan"; followed by "214". Both songs were critically acclaimed.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Citing artistic differences with the management, Perf de Castro was adamant in leaving the group in late 1995 and returned to his project band "The Blues Trio", a band later renamed "Axis" until its final inception as "Triaxis." The band continued as a quartet and Rico Blanco became the full-time guitarist while Nathan Azarcon's friend J-John Valencia filled in as session additional guitar player on live shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The band's second album ''[[Trip (Rivermaya album)|Trip]]'', released in 1996, contains the singles "[[Kisapmata (song)|Kisapmata]]" [''Blink of an Eye''], "Himala" [''Miracle''], "Flowers", "Princess of Disguise" and "Panahon Na Naman" [''It's Time Once Again'']. [[Whilce Portacio]], co-creator of the [[X-Men]]'s "[[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]" and co-founder of [[Image Comics]], illustrated the album art for ''Trip''.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1997, the band released its third album, ''[[Atomic Bomb (album)|Atomic Bomb]]'', with the single "Hinahanap-hanap Kita" [''Always Wanting to See You'']. The album gained positive responses from listeners and received heavy airplay from radio stations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} During this period, Rivermaya also released the ''Rivermaya Remixed'' album, put together with the help of DJ Toti Dalmacion of Groove Nation.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

====Departure of Bamboo Mañalac (1998)====
The band then embarked on a US and Canada tour in 1998. Despite the band's successful tour, It was also at this time that Bamboo Mañalac decided to stay in the U.S. with his family. His last show with the band was on October 10, 1998 in Oakland, CA. (he eventually went on to form his [[Bamboo (band)|eponymous band]] in 2003).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/03/09/12/why-bamboo-left-band | title=Why Bamboo left the band | publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] | date=March 9, 2012 | access-date=July 13, 2013}}</ref>

Rivermaya decided to forge on, with Rico Blanco taking on lead vocals and released their fourth album, ''It's Not Easy Being Green'' on February 15, 1999 containing the singles "Nerbyoso" [''Nervous''], "Shattered Like", and "Rodeo".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The band released its fifth studio album, aptly called ''Free'', entirely for free on the Internet as well as on CDs distributed at their gigs. ''Free'' went on to be named "Best Album of 2000" at the [[NU 107|NU Rock Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Rivermaya|title=Rivermaya music, videos, stats, and photos|website=Last.fm}}</ref>

===Second evolution of line-up (2001–2007)===
In April 2001, Nathan Azarcon departed from the group to focus on other musical interests (later revealed he got kicked out due to unruly off-screen behavior), leaving Rico Blanco and Mark Escueta as remaining members. [[Japs Sergio]] (from Daydream Cycle) filled in on Azarcon's position in gigs. They were later signed with [[Viva Records (Philippines)|Viva Records]] and released an EP "Alab ng Puso" [''Fire of the Heart''] an original soundtrack for the film ''Buhay Kamao'' which starred [[Robin Padilla]]. The EP also featured a remix by [[Raimund Marasigan]]'s ''Squid 9''. By Summer of 2001, J-John Valencia (who had been a session guitarist for the band since 1995) has left the band. By May 2001, the lineup was changed as they recruited familiar local guitar heroes, [[Kakoy Legaspi|Victor "Kakoy" Legaspi]] (from blues band Mr. Crayon) and [[Mike Elgar]] (from 7 Foot Junior), with Sergio officially absorbed in the band as well. They later began writing songs recording for their 6th studio album. The new line-up made its first performance at NU Pocket Concerts in Alabang Town Center on June 2, 2001. It would allow Rico Blanco to handle vocal duties full-time during live shows.<ref>{{cite web|first=Japs|last=Sergio|url=https://www.facebook.com/japsuki/posts/1653638464657325|title=Japsuki - May nag tag sa akin nito, a few days ago...|publisher=[[Facebook]]|date=2017-12-03|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>

By August 2001, the band had finished recording for their 6th studio album, ''[[Tuloy ang Ligaya]]'', which was released on October 24, 2001 ['The Fun Continues'] and released singles including "Umaaraw, Umuulan" [''Sometimes It Shines, Sometimes It Rains''] and "Wag Na Init Ulo, Baby" [''Don't Be Mad Anymore, Baby'']. Their music videos won the Favorite Group Video in the [[MTV Pilipinas Music Award]] in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The video for "Wag Na Init Ulo, Baby" won a special award for Highest Jump in the same event in 2003.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On October 22, 2003, they released  ''Between the Stars and the Waves'' containing the singles "A Love to Share", "Balisong" [''Butterfly Knife''], "Sunday Driving", "Table for Two", "241", and "Atat" [''Eager''].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

They were nominated in the [[MTV Asia Awards 2004]] for Favorite Artist Philippines, which was won by [[Parokya ni Edgar]].

In mid 2004, Legaspi resigned from the band for undisclosed reasons, he then later performed as a session player with other musicians such as [[Julianne Tarroja]], and Peryodiko, among others. Thus, the band became a four-piece line-up once again and has been there ever since. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

====International success (2004–2007)====
On February 5, 2005, the band won Favorite Artist Philippines in [[MTV Asia Awards 2005]].

The band found a variety of partners who commissioned such works as "Liwanag sa Dilim" [''Light In The Dark''], "Posible" [''Possible''] (Southeast Asian Games' Athletes Anthem) and "You'll Be Safe Here".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

"You'll Be Safe Here", originally created as the theme for the [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]] TV series ''[[Spirits (TV series)|Spirits]]'' was released as an EP by Warner Music Philippines and became the song that [[MTV Asia]] selected for performance at the 2006 Asia Awards. [[Kelly Rowland]] of [[Destiny's Child]] introduced the group, and they were backed up by [[Thailand]]’s Royal Symphony Orchestra during live performance. It was the first time that a Filipino band was invited to perform in the event.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

An album of compiled works, titled "You'll Be Safe Here", was distributed in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Rivermaya embarked on a series of Asian tours, including at Thailand's Pattaya Music Fest (2008, 2009) as well as Singapore's Mosaic Festival (run by The Esplanade); and [[Bangkok]]'s Fat Fest as well as in Indonesia's [[MTV Staying Alive]] show.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the Philippines, the ''Rivermaya Greatest Hits 2006'' album on Viva Records was followed by an album dedicated to its music heroes: ''Isang Ugat, Isang Dugo'' ['One Root, One Blood']. At the end of March 2007, Rivermaya scored again another first for the [[Philippines]] as their videos, "[[You'll Be Safe Here]]" and the recent video remake "Balisong" were chosen as the first [[Asian people|Asian]] artists to have full-length music videos featured on the [[Star World]] Channel.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Also during this time, Rivermaya has been often referred to as "Banda ng Bayan" [The Band of the Nation], a nickname they share with [[Parokya ni Edgar]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

====Departure of Rico Blanco (2007)====
On May 24, 2007, Rico Blanco officially announced his departure from the group citing personal reasons. His last performance with the band was on May 4, 2007 at the Metro Bar. Despite the rumors that the band would eventually disband, both Rivermaya and its management denied the rumors as a result.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Ancheta|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/13427/pep-exclusive-rico-blanco-no-longer-with-rivermaya|title=PEP EXCLUSIVE: Rico Blanco no longer with Rivermaya|publisher=pep.ph|date=2007-05-28|access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref>

After Rico Blanco left, Rivermaya released a new single, "Sayang" [''Such a Waste''], penned and sung by Japs Sergio and described by the band as "an open letter to the fans", the single premiered on June 22, 2007. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In addition, [[Studio 23]] announced the selection of Rivermaya to create the new theme song for the station. The new song is titled "Sumigaw" [''Shout''] and marks the release of a second single in two months for the band, accelerating Rivermaya's pace for new songs rapidly (in previous years, the band had managed to release only a single every 12 months).

On August 11, 2007, during a mini press conference held at Mogwai Bar and Café in Cubao's Marikina Shoe Expo, Rivermaya released its all-new 5-song ''Bagong Liwanag'' ['New Light'] EP, which hit stores nationwide starting August 15. This 5-song EP is released on the band's own label, Revolver Music, and licensed to Warner Music Philippines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/56289/Rivermaya-launches-Bagong-Liwanag-EP |title=Rivermaya launches 'Bagong Liwanag' EP |publisher=GMANews.TV |date=2007-08-16 |access-date=2008-10-29}}</ref>

===Third evolution of line-up (2007–2011)===
Rivermaya held auditions for a new vocalist. The auditions was televised on [[Studio 23]], which was titled ''Bagong Liwanag''. Aside from the band members, main judges are Rivermaya manager Lizza Nakpil, [[The Dawn (band)|The Dawn]] guitarist [[Francis Reyes]], and [[Razorback (band)|Razorback]] bassist Louie Talan. On October 24, 2007, then-18-year-old Jayson Fernandez (usually spelled as "''Jason''") was announced as the winner and new member of Rivermaya.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

On January 21, 2008, Rivermaya released the album entitled ''[[Buhay (album)|Buhay]]'' ['Life'] with the carrier single "Sugal ng Kapalaran" [''Gamble of Fate''] penned by Sergio with both Fernandez and Sergio doing the vocals, while Elgar and Escueta do backing vocals. During this time, the band parted ways with manager-director Chito Roño.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Rivermaya has played in Singapore at the Marina Bay New Year Countdown on December 31, 2008 while in September 2009, the group is the first Filipino band invited to perform on 3 different stages at the 2009 Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix and in the same month and year, the band released the album ''[[Closest Thing To Heaven (Rivermaya album)|Closest Thing To Heaven]]'' with the track "Dangal" [''Dignity''] as the carrier single.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

====Band name ownership disputes (2008-2009)====
After allegedly discovering several acts of misappropriation of funds involving the bands' royalties and talent fees, then Rivermaya band members announced that the band had parted ways with their longtime manager Lizza G. Nakpil on October 29, 2008. She was charged with the crime of [[estafa]], sued for damages, and the court issued a Writ of Preliminary Injunction forbidding further contact with Rivermaya.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091020081757/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/224911/lizza-nakpil-ha]</ref> Also in October 2008, longtime member Mark Escueta filed his own application at the Intellectual Property Office (IPO), solely in his name for Rivermaya but was rejected by the IPO. In August 2009, a decision of the IPO confirmed that the "Rivermaya" name ownership of the trademark belongs to Nakpil. However, in October of the same year, Escueta was granted with a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by the Regional Trial Court of Lucena City. The TRO prevents Nakpil from claiming sole ownership of the "Rivermaya" band name while the case and appeal issued by both parties are still being studied by the court, thus allowing Escueta to continue using the band name regardless of the IPO decision as there was no Entry of Judgment/Execution that has been issued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/23619/tro-over-band-name-ownership-issued-against-rivermaya39s-ex--manager-lizza-nakpil|title=TRO over band-name ownership issued against Rivermaya's ex- manager Lizza Nakpil|first=Bong|last=Godinez|date=22 October 2009|website=Pep.ph}}</ref>

====Departure of Jayson Fernandez (2011)====
On August 28, 2011, Jayson Fernandez left Rivermaya after 4 years with the group citing musical differences as the primary reason.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/jayson-fernandez/my-new-chapter/252578158108192|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=Facebook.com}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=September 2015}} Paolo Valenciano (son of [[Gary Valenciano]]) of Salamin, Pochoy Labog of Malay and [[Dicta License]], and [[Vinci Montaner]] of [[Parokya ni Edgar]] are among the notable personalities who simultaneously filled in as temporary lead vocalists for some occasional gigs weeks after Fernandez's departure.

====''Panatang Makabanda'' and mini-reunion (2012-2016)====
After taking a brief hiatus, in November 2012, Japs Sergio posted on his official Facebook page that he left Rivermaya, in order to pursue his new band, Peso Movement. Since then, Mark Escueta, Mike Elgar and Norby David simultaneously switched over the lead vocal duties.

On March 19, 2013, Rivermaya released the album ''[[Panatang Makabanda]]'' ['A Vow for the Band Passionate'].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

On January 9, 2016, members from the original classic line-up consisting of Perf de Castro, Nathan Azarcon, Mark Escueta and Rico Blanco were re-united at 19 East, Muntinlupa after an invitation from de Castro following his gig.

The gig, which they dubbed as a "secret mini semi-reunion", was composed of Rico Blanco on keyboards, de Castro on guitars, Azarcon on bass guitar and Escueta on drums. Blanco and de Castro simultaneously switch over lead vocals all throughout the performance while Azarcon and Escueta provided backing vocals. Bamboo Mañalac was invited as well however it was reported that he was out of the country on that date.
