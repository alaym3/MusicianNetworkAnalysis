He made over 70 feature films and recorded more than 1,600 songs.

His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed, such as [[Perry Como]],{{sfn |Gilliland |1994 |loc=cassette 1, side B}} [[Frank Sinatra]],<ref name="Giddins">{{cite news |last=Giddins |first=Gary |date=2001-01-28 |title=MUSIC; Bing Crosby, The Unsung King of Song |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/28/books/music-bing-crosby-the-unsung-king-of-song.html |access-date=2020-05-27 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Dean Martin]], [[Dick Haymes]], [[Elvis Presley]],<ref name="Giddins"/> and [[John Lennon]].<ref name="Giddins"/>

Crosby won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance in ''[[Going My Way]]'' (1944) and was nominated for its sequel, ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), opposite [[Ingrid Bergman]], becoming the first of six actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first [[Grammy Award|Grammy Global Achievement Award]].<ref name="variety">{{cite news |last=Tapley |first=Krostopher |title=Sylvester Stallone Could Join Exclusive Oscar Company with 'Creed' Nomination |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 10, 2015 |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/in-contention/sylvester-stallone-oscars-golden-globes-1201657048/ |access-date=February 29, 2016}}</ref> He is one of 33 people to have three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/#most-stars |title=Hollywood Star Walk – Los Angeles Times |website=Projects.latimes.com}}</ref> in the categories of motion pictures, radio, and audio recording.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://walkoffame.com/bing-crosby/ |title=Bing Crosby &#124; Hollywood Walk of Fame |website=Walkoffame.com|date=October 25, 2019 }}</ref> He was also known for his collaborations with friend [[Bob Hope]], starring in the ''[[Road to...]]'' films from 1940 to 1962.

Crosby influenced the development of the postwar [[recording industry]]. After seeing a demonstration of a German broadcast quality [[reel-to-reel tape recorder]] brought to America by [[John T. Mullin]], he invested $50,000 in California electronics company [[Ampex]] to build copies. He then persuaded ABC to allow him to tape his shows. He became the first performer to prerecord his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto [[magnetic tape]].

Through the medium of recording, he constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, [[time shifting]]) used in motion picture production, a practice that became industry standard.<ref>{{cite web |title=Engineering and Technology History Wiki |url=https://ethw.org/First-Hand:Bing_Crosby_and_the_Recording_Revolution |website=Ethw.org |access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref> In addition to his work with early audio tape recording, he helped finance the development of videotape, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the [[History of the Pittsburgh Pirates|Pittsburgh Pirates]] baseball team, during which time the team won two [[World Series]] (1960 and 1971).

Crosby: "Well, I'll tell you, back in the knee-britches day, when I was a wee little tyke, a mere broth of a lad, as we say in Spokane, I used to totter around the streets, with a gun on each hip, my favorite after school pastime was a game known as "[[tag (game)#Cops and robbers|Cops and Robbers]]", I didn't care which side I was on, when a cop or robber came into view, I would haul out my trusty six-shooters, made of wood, and loudly exclaim ''bing''! ''bing''!, as my luckless victim fell clutching his side, I would shout ''bing''! ''bing''!, and I would let him have it again, and then as his friends came to his rescue, shooting as they came, I would shout ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''! ''bing''!"<br />Blondell: "I'm surprised they didn't call you "Killer" Crosby!

As it happens, that story was pure whimsy for dramatic effect; the Associated Press had reported as early as February 1932—as would later be confirmed by both Bing himself and his biographer Charles Thompson—that it was in fact a neighbor—Valentine Hobart, circa 1910—who had named him "Bingo from Bingville" after a comic feature in the local paper called ''[[Newton Newkirk|The Bingville Bugle]]'' which the young Harry liked. In time, Bingo got shortened to Bing.<ref>Associated Press (February 1, 1932).

In 1917, Crosby took a summer job as property boy at Spokane's Auditorium, where he witnessed some of the acts of the day, including [[Al Jolson]], who held him spellbound with [[ad-lib]]bing and parodies of [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian songs]]. He later described Jolson's delivery as "electric".{{sfn |Gilliland |1994 |loc=cassette 3, side B}}

Crosby graduated from Gonzaga High School (today's [[Gonzaga Preparatory School]]) in 1920 and enrolled at Gonzaga University.

==Performance career==
===Early years===
In 1923 Crosby was invited to join a new band composed of high-school students a few years younger than himself. [[Al Rinker|Al]] and Miles Rinker (brothers of singer [[Mildred Bailey]]), James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers,<ref name=bicrdha/> who performed at dances both for high school students and club-goers. The group performed on Spokane radio station [[The Davenport Hotel (Spokane, Washington)|KHQ]], but disbanded after two years.<ref name="Giddins2001" />{{rp|92–97}}<ref>[[The Davenport Hotel (Spokane, Washington)|Early KHQ broadcast from the Davenport Hotel Spokane]]</ref> Crosby and Al Rinker obtained work at the Clemmer Theatre in Spokane (now known as the [[Bing Crosby Theater]]).

Crosby was initially a member of a vocal trio called The Three Harmony Aces with Al Rinker accompanying on piano from the pit, to entertain between the films. Crosby and Al continued at the Clemmer Theatre for several months often with three other men – Wee Georgie Crittenden, Frank McBride and Lloyd Grinnell – and they were billed The Clemmer Trio or The Clemmer Entertainers depending who performed.<ref name="macfarlane2001">{{cite book |first=Malcolm |last=Macfarlane |title=Bing Crosby: Day by Day |year=2001 |url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm |website=Bingmagazine.co.uk}}</ref>

In October 1925, Crosby and Rinker decided to seek fame in California. They traveled to Los Angeles, where Bailey introduced them to her show business contacts. The Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for the revue ''The Syncopation Idea'' starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the [[Loews Theatres|Loew's circuit]]. They each earned $75 a week. As minor parts of ''The Syncopation Idea'' Crosby and Rinker started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively style that was popular with college students. After ''The Syncopation Idea'' closed, they worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They honed their skills with Morrissey. When they got a chance to present an independent act, they were spotted by a member of the [[Paul Whiteman]] organization.

Whiteman needed something different to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in show business, they were attached to one of the biggest names.<ref name="macfarlane2001"/> Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the [[Tivoli Theatre (Chicago)|Tivoli Theatre]] in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was "I've Got the Girl" with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record was inadvertently recorded at a slow speed, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78&nbsp;rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/rhythmboys.html |title=Paul Whiteman's Original Rhythm Boys |website=Redhotjazz.com |access-date=November 19, 2016}}</ref>

===The Rhythm Boys===
Success with Whiteman was followed by disaster when they reached New York. Whiteman considered letting them go. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter [[Harry Barris]] made the difference, and [[The Rhythm Boys]] were born. The additional voice meant they could be heard more easily in large New York theaters. Crosby gained valuable experience on tour for a year with Whiteman and performing and recording with [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Eddie Lang]], and [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. He matured as a performer and was in demand as a solo singer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Macfarlane |first1=Malcolm |title=Bing Crosby – Day by Day |url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/1903-1935.htm#Chapter_3 |website=BING magazine |access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref>

Crosby became the star attraction of the Rhythm Boys. In 1928 he had his first number one hit, a jazz-influenced rendition of "[[Ol' Man River]]". In 1929, the Rhythm Boys appeared in the film ''[[King of Jazz]]'' with Whiteman, but Crosby's growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to the Rhythm Boys leaving his organization. They joined the [[Gus Arnheim]] Orchestra, performing nightly in the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Coconut Grove]] of the Ambassador Hotel. Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Crosby's solos began to steal the show while the Rhythm Boys' act gradually became redundant. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's hits, including "At Your Command", "[[I Surrender Dear]]", and "[[Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (song)|Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams]]". When [[Mack Sennett]] signed Crosby to a solo recording contract in 1931, a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable. Crosby married [[Dixie Lee]] in September 1930. After a threat of divorce in March 1931, he applied himself to his career.

===Success as a solo singer===
[[File:Bing Crosby - Modern Screen, September 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crosby in 1932]]
On September 2, 1931, Crosby made his nationwide [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby|solo radio debut]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radiohalloffame.com/bing-crosby |title=Bing Crosby |publisher=Radio Hall of Fame |access-date=September 2, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923002631/http://www.radiohof.org/musicvariety/bingcrosby.html |archive-date=September 23, 2008}}</ref> Before the end of the year, he signed with both [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] and [[CBS Radio]]. Doing a weekly 15-minute radio broadcast, Crosby became a hit.<ref name="kl">{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p3094/biography}}</ref> "[[Out of Nowhere (Johnny Green song)|Out of Nowhere]]", "Just One More Chance", "[[At Your Command]]" and "[[I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)]]" were among the best selling songs of 1931.<ref name="kl"/>

Ten of the top 50 songs of 1931 included Crosby with others or as a solo act. A "Battle of the Baritones" with singer [[Russ Columbo]] proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan "Bing Was King". Crosby played the lead in a series of [[I Surrender Dear (1931 film)|musical comedy short films]] for Mack Sennett, signed with Paramount, and starred in his first full-length film 1932's ''[[The Big Broadcast]]'' (1932), the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures. He signed a contract with [[Jack Kapp]]'s new record company, [[Decca Records|Decca]], in late 1934.

His first commercial sponsor on radio was [[15 Minutes with Bing Crosby#Bing Crosby – The Cremo Singer|Cremo Cigars]] and his fame spread nationwide. After a long run in New York, he went back to Hollywood to film ''[[The Big Broadcast]]''. His appearances, records, and radio work substantially increased his impact. The success of his first film brought him a contract with Paramount, and he began a pattern of making three films a year. He led his radio show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons while his live appearances dwindled. His records produced hits during the Depression when sales were down. Audio engineer [[Steve Hoffman (audio engineer)|Steve Hoffman]] stated, <blockquote>By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp's crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee.

His social life was frantic. His first son [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary]] was born in 1933 with twin boys following in 1934. By 1936, he replaced his former boss, Paul Whiteman, as host of the weekly NBC radio program ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', where he remained for the next ten years. "[[Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)]]", with his trademark whistling, became his theme song and signature tune.

Crosby's vocal style helped take popular singing beyond the "[[belt (music)|belting]]" associated with [[Al Jolson]] and [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], who had been obligated to reach the back seats in New York theaters without the aid of the microphone. As music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] noted in ''The Great American Popular Singers'', something new had entered American music, a style that might be called "singing in American" with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet ''[[crooner]]''.

Crosby admired [[Louis Armstrong]] for his musical ability, and the trumpet maestro was a formative influence on Crosby's singing style. When the two met, they became friends. In 1936, Crosby exercised an option in his Paramount contract to regularly star in an out-of-house film. Signing an agreement with [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] for a single motion picture, Crosby wanted Armstrong to appear in a screen adaptation of ''The Peacock Feather'' that eventually became ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]''. Crosby asked [[Harry Cohn]], but Cohn had no desire to pay for the flight or to meet Armstrong's "crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, [[Joe Glaser]]". Crosby threatened to leave the film and refused to discuss the matter. Cohn gave in; Armstrong's musical scenes and comic dialogue extended his influence to the silver screen, creating more opportunities for him and other African Americans to appear in future films. Crosby also ensured behind the scenes that Armstrong received equal billing with his white co-stars. Armstrong appreciated Crosby's progressive attitudes on race, and often expressed gratitude for the role in later years.<ref name="Pennies">{{cite web |title=Pennies from Heaven (1936) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/111407%7c111410/Pennies-from-Heaven.html |website=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], Crosby made live appearances before American troops who had been fighting in the [[European Theater of Operations|European Theater]]. He learned how to pronounce German from written scripts and read propaganda broadcasts intended for German forces. The nickname "Der Bingle" was common among Crosby's German listeners and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], General [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and [[Bob Hope]].

The June 18, 1945 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine stated, "America's number one star, Bing Crosby, has won more fans, made more money than any entertainer in history. Today he is a kind of national institution."<ref name="Barnett">{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Lincoln |title=Bing Inc. |url=http://stevenlewis.info/crosby/LIFE%20OVERSEAS6-18-45.htm |website=Stevenlewis.info |access-date=July 5, 2018 |date=18 June 1945}}</ref> "In all, 60,000,000 Crosby discs have been marketed since he made his first record in 1931. His biggest best seller is "White Christmas" 2,000,000 impressions of which have been sold in the U.S. and 250,000 in Great Britain."<ref name="Barnett" /> "Nine out of ten singers and bandleaders listen to Crosby's broadcasts each Thursday night and follow his lead. The day after he sings a song over the air – any song – some 50,000 copies of it are sold throughout the U.S. Time and again Crosby has taken some new or unknown ballad, has given it what is known in trade circles as the 'big goose' and made it a hit single-handed and overnight... Precisely what the future holds for Crosby neither his family nor his friends can conjecture. He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records which he made ten years ago are selling better than ever before. The nation's appetite for Crosby's voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future. For one thing, he enjoys hearing himself sing, and if ever a day should dawn when the public wearies of him, he will complacently go right on singing—to himself."<ref name="Barnett" /><ref name="Inc1945">{{cite book |author=Time Inc |title=Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA17 |access-date=November 19, 2016 |date=18 June 1945 |pages=17–}}</ref>

[[File:Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye in White Christmas trailer.jpg|right|thumb|''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' (1954)]]
The biggest hit song of Crosby's career was his recording of [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]", which he introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941. A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' for their December 25, 2011, program. The song appeared in his film ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1942). His record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to No.&nbsp;1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks. A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another sixteen times. It topped the charts again in 1945 and a third time in January 1947. The song remains the bestselling single of all time.<ref name="kl"/> According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', his recording of "White Christmas", has sold over 50 million copies around the world.<ref name="Guinness">{{cite web |title=Best-selling single |work=[[Guinness World Records]] |year=2012 |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/59721-best-selling-single |access-date=January 11, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113233517/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/59721-best-selling-single |archive-date=13 January 2018}}</ref> His recording was so popular that he was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles.

In the wake of a solid decade of headlining mainly smash hit musical comedy films in the 1930s, Crosby starred with Bob Hope and [[Dorothy Lamour]] in six of the seven ''[[Road to]]'' musical comedies between 1940 and 1962 (Lamour was replaced with Joan Collins in ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' and limited to a lengthy cameo), cementing Crosby and Hope as an on-and-off duo, despite never declaring themselves a "team" in the sense that [[Laurel and Hardy]] or [[Martin and Lewis]] ([[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]]) were teams. The series consists of ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' (1940), ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941), ''[[Road to Morocco]]'' (1942), ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' (1946), ''[[Road to Rio]]'' (1947), ''[[Road to Bali]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion. They performed together countless times on stage, radio, film, and television, and made numerous brief and not so brief appearances together in movies aside from the "Road" pictures, ''[[Variety Girl]]'' (1947) being an example of lengthy scenes and songs together along with billing.

In the 1949 Disney animated film ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'', Crosby provided the narration and song vocals for ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' segment. In 1960, he starred in ''[[High Time (film)|High Time]]'', a collegiate comedy with [[Fabian Forte]] and [[Tuesday Weld]] that predicted the emerging gap between him and the new young generation of musicians and actors who had begun their careers after World War II. The following year, Crosby and Hope reunited for one more ''Road'' movie, ''[[The Road to Hong Kong]]'', which teamed them up with the much younger [[Joan Collins]] and [[Peter Sellers]]. Collins was used in place of their longtime partner Dorothy Lamour, whom Crosby felt was getting too old for the role, though Hope refused to do the film without her, and she instead made a lengthy and elaborate cameo appearance.<ref name="kl"/> Shortly before his death in 1977, he had planned another ''Road'' film in which he, Hope, and Lamour search for the Fountain of Youth.

He won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for ''[[Going My Way]]'' in 1944 and was nominated for the 1945 sequel, ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]''. He received critical acclaim for his performance as an alcoholic entertainer in ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' and received his third Academy Award nomination.<ref name="Fisher">{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=James |title=Bing Crosby: Through the Years, Volumes One–Nine (1954–56) |journal=ARSC Journal |date=Spring 2012 |volume=43 |issue=1}}</ref>

===Television===
{{main|Bing Crosby TV appearances listing}}
[[File:Bing Crosby and family 1974 Christmas special.JPG|thumb|Crosby and his family in a Christmas special, 1974]]
''The Fireside Theater'' (1950) was his first television production. The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at [[Hal Roach#Hal Roach Studios|Hal Roach Studios]] rather than performed live on the air. The "telefilms" were syndicated to individual television stations. He was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s, appearing on various variety shows as well as numerous late-night talk shows and his own highly rated specials. Bob Hope memorably devoted one of his monthly NBC specials to his long intermittent partnership with Crosby titled "On the Road With Bing". Crosby was associated with ABC's ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'' as the show's first and most frequent guest host and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children, and continued after ''The Hollywood Palace'' was eventually canceled. In the early 1970s, he made two late appearances on the ''[[Flip Wilson Show]]'', singing duets with the comedian. His last TV appearance was a Christmas special, ''[[Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas|Merrie Olde Christmas]]'', taped in London in September 1977 and aired weeks after his death.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pairpoint |first1=Lionel |title=The Chronological Bing Crosby on Television |url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/BingTV.htm |website=BING magazine |access-date=February 21, 2016}}</ref> It was on this special that he recorded a duet of "[[The Little Drummer Boy]]" and "[[Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy|Peace on Earth]]" with rock musician [[David Bowie]]. Their duet was released in 1982 as a single 45-rpm record and reached No. 3 in the UK singles charts.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /> It has since become a staple of holiday radio and the final popular hit of Crosby's career. At the end of the 20th century, ''TV Guide'' listed the Crosby-Bowie duet one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.

Bing Crosby Productions, affiliated with [[Desilu Studios]] and later [[CBS Television Studios]], produced a number of television series, including Crosby's own unsuccessful ABC sitcom ''[[The Bing Crosby Show (1964 TV series)|The Bing Crosby Show]]'' in the 1964–1965 season (with co-stars [[Beverly Garland]] and [[Frank McHugh]]). The company produced two ABC medical dramas, ''[[Ben Casey]]'' (1961–1966) and ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]'' (1963–1964), the popular ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' (1965–1971) military comedy on CBS, as well as the lesser-known show ''[[Slattery's People]]'' (1964–1965).

==Singing style and vocal characteristics==
[[File:Bing Crosby 1930s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Crosby in the 1930s]]
Crosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone rather than use the deep, loud [[vaudeville]] style associated with [[Al Jolson]].<ref name="Gary Giddins 2009">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/28/books/music-bing-crosby-the-unsung-king-of-song.html |title=Bing Crosby: The Unsung King of Song |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Gary Giddins |date=2001-01-28 |access-date=2014-12-03}}</ref> He was, by his own definition, a "phraser", a singer who placed equal emphasis on both the lyrics and the music.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Bing Crosby (1901?–1977) |date=1978 |journal=Music Educators Journal |issue=7 |pages=56–57 |edition=64}}</ref> Paul Whiteman's hiring of Crosby, with phrasing that echoed jazz, particularly his bandmate [[Bix Beiderbecke]]'s trumpet, helped bring the genre to a wider audience.<ref name="Gary Giddins 2009" /> In the framework of the novelty-singing style of [[the Rhythm Boys]], he bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was rooted in jazz.<ref>Gary Giddins, ''Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams, The Early Years, 1903-1940'', (NY: Little and Brown, 2009), p. 67, {{ISBN|0316091561}}</ref> He had already been introduced to Louis Armstrong and [[Bessie Smith]] before his first appearance on record. Crosby and Armstrong remained warm acquaintances for decades, occasionally singing together in later years, e.g. "Now You Has Jazz" in the film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956).

During the early portion of his solo career (about 1931–1934), Crosby's emotional, often pleading style of [[crooning]] was popular. But Jack Kapp, manager of Brunswick and later Decca, talked him into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms in favor of a clear vocal style. Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other musicians, and most important, diversifying his repertoire into several styles and genres. Kapp helped Crosby have number one hits in [[Christmas music]], [[Hawaiian music]], and [[country music]], and top-thirty hits in [[Irish music]], [[French popular music|French music]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[ballad]]s.{{sfn|Gilliland|1994|loc=cassette 1, side B}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stevenlewis.info/crosby/jackapp.htm |title=Jack Kapp – Bing Crosby Internet Museum |website=Stevenlewis.info |access-date=November 19, 2016}}</ref>

Crosby elaborated on an idea of Al Jolson's: phrasing, or the art of making a song's lyric ring true. "I used to tell [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]] over and over," said Tommy Dorsey, "there's only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby. All that matters to him is the words, and that's the only thing that ought to for you, too."<ref name="Friedwald2010">{{cite book |last=Friedwald |first=Will |title=A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BW9dtlqrg_0C&pg=PA116 |access-date=October 3, 2018 |date=2 November 2010 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |isbn=978-0-307-37989-4 |pages=116–}}</ref>

Critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] wrote:
{{Blockquote|[While] the octave B flat to B flat in Bing's voice at that time [1930s] is, to my ears, one of the loveliest I have heard in forty-five years of listening to baritones, both classical and popular, it dropped conspicuously in later years. From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G to G, or even F to F. In a recording he made of '[[Dardanella]]' with Louis Armstrong in 1960, he attacks lightly and easily on a low E flat. This is lower than most opera basses care to venture, and they tend to sound as if they were in the cellar when they get there.<ref name="Pleasants">{{cite book |last1=Pleasants |first1=Henry |title=The Great American Popular Singers |url=https://archive.org/details/greatamericanpop00plea |url-access=registration |date=1985 |publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref>}}

==Career achievements==
Crosby's was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine used different methodologies during his career. But his chart success remains impressive: 396 chart singles, including roughly 41 No.&nbsp;1 hits. Crosby had separate charting singles every year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of "White Christmas" extended that streak to 1957. He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. Statistician [[Joel Whitburn]] at ''Billboard'' determined that Crosby was America's most successful recording act of the 1930s and again in the 1940s.<ref>Don Tyler, ''Music of the Postwar Era'' (NY: ABC-CLIO, 2008), 209. {{ISBN|9780313341915}}</ref> In 1960 Crosby was honored as "First Citzen of Record Industry" based on having sold 200 million discs.<ref name="CrosbyStrege2016">{{cite book |author1=Nathaniel Crosby |author2=John Strege |title=18 Holes with Bing: Golf, Life, and Lessons from Dad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2K9VCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT6 |date=3 May 2016 |publisher=Dey Street Books |isbn=978-0-06-241430-4 |pages=6–}}</ref> According to different sources He sold 500 million or even 1 billion worldwide.<ref>{{cite book |title=Crosby |page=775 |work=[[American National Biography |American National Biography: Clarke, Mary-DaCosta]] |first=John A. |last=Garraty |author-link=John A.

For fifteen years (1934, 1937, 1940, 1943–1954), Crosby was among the top ten acts in box-office sales, and for five of those years (1944–1948) he topped the world.<ref name="kl"/> He sang four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning songs&nbsp;– "Sweet Leilani" (1937), "White Christmas" (1942), "[[Swinging on a Star]]" (1944), "In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening" (1951)&nbsp;– and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in ''[[Going My Way]]'' (1944).

A survey in 2000 found that with 1,077,900,000 movie tickets sold, Crosby was the third most popular actor of all time, behind [[Clark Gable]] (1,168,300,000) and [[John Wayne]] (1,114,000,000).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Macfarlane |first1=Malcolm |title=Bing Crosby – Day by Day |date=2001 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=0-8108-4145-2 |pages=670–671}}</ref> The ''International Motion Picture Almanac'' lists him in a tie for second-most years at number one on the All Time Number One Stars List with [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Tom Hanks]], and [[Burt Reynolds]].<ref name="Quigley">{{cite web |title=Top Ten Money Making Stars of the past 79 years |url=http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |publisher=Quigley Publishing |access-date=August 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114130743/http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |archive-date=January 14, 2013 |df=mdy}}</ref> His most popular film, ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'', grossed $30&nbsp;million in 1954 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|30|1954}}}}&nbsp;million in current value).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schmidt |first1=Wayne |title=Waynes This and That |url=http://waynesthisandthat.com/crosbymovies.html |website=Waynesthisandthat.com |access-date=March 31, 2016}}</ref>

He received 23 gold and platinum records, according to the book ''Million Selling Records''. The Recording Industry Association of America did not institute its gold record certification program until 1958 when Crosby's record sales were low. Before 1958, gold records were awarded by record companies.<ref>Erich Hertz and Jeffrey Roessner, ''Write in Tune: Contemporary Music in Fiction'' (NY: Bloomsbury, 2014), 2-3. {{ISBN|9781623561451}}</ref> Crosby charted 23 ''Billboard'' hits from 47 recorded songs with the [[Andrews Sisters]], whose Decca record sales were second only to Crosby's throughout the 1940s.

They made one film appearance together in ''[[Road to Rio]]'' singing "You Don't Have to Know the Language", and sang together on radio throughout the 1940s and 1950s. They appeared as guests on each other's shows and on [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] during and after World War II. The quartet's Top-10 ''Billboard'' hits from 1943 to 1945 include "The Vict'ry Polka", "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In)", and "Is You Is or Is You Ain't (Ma' Baby?)" and helped morale of the American public.<ref>Sforza, John: "Swing It!

==Popularity and influence==
[[File:Bing Crosby Photo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|{{center|Crosby in 1945}}]]
Crosby's popularity around the world was such that in an interview with Dorothy Masuka, the best-selling African recording artist in Africa, she stated "Only Bing Crosby the famous American crooner sold more records than me in Africa." His great popularity throughout [[Africa]] led other African singers to emulate him, including Dolly Rathebe, Masuka, and Míriam Makeba, known locally as "The Bing Crosby of Africa" though she is female.<ref>{{cite book |last=Music |first=International Association for the Study of Popular |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brs4AQAAIAAJ&q=miriam+makeba+fan+of+bing+crosby |title=Popular Music: Intercultural Interpretations |date=August 1998 |publisher=Graduate Program in Music, Kanazawa University |isbn=978-4-9980684-1-9 |language=en}}</ref>

Presenter Mike Douglas commented in a 1975 interview, "During my days in the navy in [[World War II]], I remember walking the streets of Calcutta, India, on the coast, it was a lonely night, so far from my home and from my new wife, Gen. I needed something to lift my spirits. As I passed a Hindu sitting on the corner of a street, I heard something surprisingly familiar, I came back to see the man playing one of those old Vitrolas, like those of RCA with the horn speaker, the man was listening to Bing Crosby sing "Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive". I stopped and smiled in grateful acknowledgment. The Hindu nodded and smiled back.

==Entrepreneurship==
According to Shoshana Klebanoff, Crosby became one of the richest men in the history of show business. He had investments in real estate, mines, oil wells, cattle ranches, race horses, music publishing, baseball teams, and television. He made a fortune from the Minute Maid Orange Juice Corporation, in which he was a principal stockholder.<ref>Shoshana Klebanoff, "Crosby, Bing" ''American National Biography'' (2000).</ref>

===Role in early tape recording===
[[File:Bing Crosby Billboard 3.jpg|right|thumb|{{center|Crosby in 1943}}]]
During the [[Golden Age of Radio]], performers had to create their shows live, sometimes even redoing the program a second time for the West Coast time zone. Crosby had to do two live radio shows on the same day, three hours apart, for the East and West Coasts.<ref name=RW>{{cite magazine |author=Careless, James |title=The Ever-Evolving Role of Airchecks |magazine=Radio World |date=May 22, 2019 |volume=43 |number=13 |page=18}}</ref> Crosby's radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows. (The live production of radio shows was also reinforced by the musicians' union and [[ASCAP]], which wanted to ensure continued work for their members.) In ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional broadcast quality standard:
{{Blockquote|[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Phil Harris, and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.}}

Crosby's insistence eventually factored into the further development of [[magnetic tape sound recording]] and the radio industry's widespread adoption of it.<ref>Hammar, Peter.

But NBC and CBS refused to broadcast prerecorded radio programs. Crosby left the network and remained off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with his sponsor [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] that was settled out of court. He returned to broadcasting for the last 13 weeks of the 1945–1946 season.

The Mutual network, on the other hand, pre-recorded some of its programs as early as 1938 for ''[[The Shadow]]'' with [[Orson Welles]]. ABC was formed from the sale of the [[NBC Blue Network]] in 1943 after a federal [[antitrust]] suit and was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by [[Philco]]. He would get an additional $40,000 from 400&nbsp;independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch (40-cm) [[acetate disc|lacquer discs]] that played ten minutes per side at 33{{sfrac|1|3}} rpm.

Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German [[Magnetophon]] in June 1947—the same device that [[Jack Mullin]] had brought back from Radio Frankfurt with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]] ordered [[Ampex]], which he founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.

Crosby hired Mullin to start recording his ''Philco Radio Time'' show on his German-made machine in August 1947 using the same 50&nbsp;reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at [[Bad Nauheim]] near Frankfurt while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:
{{Blockquote|By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad-lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad-libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.}}

Mullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account:
{{Blockquote|In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad-lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.}}

Crosby invested US$50,000 in Ampex with the intent to produce more machines.<ref name="Sterling, C. H. 1990"/> In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was recorded with the Ampex Model 200A and Scotch 111 tape from [[3M]].<ref name=RW /> Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:

{{Blockquote|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.}}

Crosby started the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film ''[[Mr. Music]]'', he is seen singing into an Ampex tape recorder that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, guitarist [[Les Paul]], which led to Paul's invention of [[multitrack recording]]. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, held tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the [[laugh track]] that are still in use today.<ref name="Sterling, C. H. 1990">Sterling, C. H., & Kittross, J. M. (1990). Stay Tuned: A Concise History of American broadcasting (2nd ed.). Belmont, California: Wadsworth.</ref>

===Videotape development===
Mullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a [[videotape recorder]] (VTR). Television production was mostly [[live television]] in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. ''The Fireside Theater'' (1950) sponsored by [[Procter & Gamble]], was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the "telefilms" were [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to individual television stations.

Crosby continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises gave the world's first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by [[Jack Mullin|John T. Mullin]] and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device aired what were described as "blurred and indistinct" images, using a modified [[Ampex]] 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (6.3&nbsp;mm) audio tape moving at 360&nbsp;inches (9.1&nbsp;m) per second.<ref>"Tape Recording Used by Filmless 'Camera{{'"}}, ''The New York Times'', November 12, 1951, p. 21.

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
Crosby was a fan of [[thoroughbred racing|thoroughbred horse racing]] and bought his first racehorse in 1935. In 1937, he became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its board of directors.<ref name="bingcrosby.com">{{cite web |title=Entrepreneur |url=https://bingcrosby.com/bing-bio/entrepreneur |website=Bingcrosby.com |date=August 15, 1949 |access-date=November 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name="dmtc.com">{{cite web |title=Del Mar Horse Racing History |url=https://www.dmtc.com/media/history |website=Dmtc.com |date=September 7, 1970 |access-date=November 19, 2016}}</ref> Operating from the [[Del Mar Racetrack]] at Del Mar, California, the group included millionaire businessman [[Charles S.

Howard]], became one of Crosby's closest friends; Crosby named his son [[Lindsay Crosby|Lindsay]] after him, and would purchase his 40-room [[Hillsborough, California|Hillsborough]], California estate from Lindsay in 1965.

Crosby and Lindsay Howard formed [[Binglin Stable]] to race and breed thoroughbred horses at a ranch in [[Moorpark, California|Moorpark]] in Ventura County, California.<ref name="bingcrosby.com"/> They also established the Binglin stock farm in Argentina, where they raced horses at Hipódromo de Palermo in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]]. A number of Argentine-bred horses were purchased and shipped to race in the United States. On August 12, 1938, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club hosted a $25,000 winner-take-all [[match race]] won by Charles S. Howard's [[Seabiscuit]] over Binglin's horse Ligaroti.<ref name="dmtc.com"/> In 1943, Binglin's horse Don Bingo won the [[Suburban Handicap]] at [[Belmont Park]] in Elmont, New York.

The Binglin Stable partnership came to an end in 1953 as a result of a liquidation of assets by Crosby, who needed to raise enough funds to pay the hefty federal and state inheritance taxes on his deceased wife's estate.<ref>{{cite news |title=People, Aug. 3, 1953 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822904,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312061744/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822904,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 12, 2007 |work=Time |access-date=January 25, 2007 |date=August 3, 1953}}</ref> The [[Bing Crosby Breeders' Cup Handicap]] at Del Mar Racetrack is named in his honor.

==Sports==
Crosby had an interest in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, [[Gonzaga Bulldogs football|Gonzaga]] head coach [[Mike Pecarovich]] appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach.<ref>[http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Libraries/Foley-Library/Departments/Special-Collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga2.asp Bing Crosby and Gonzaga University: 1925&nbsp;– 1951] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219112102/http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/libraries/foley-library/departments/special-collections/Collections/Bing-Crosby-Collection/CrosbyandGonzaga2.asp |date=February 19, 2016}}, Gonzaga University, retrieved June 6, 2011.</ref> From 1946 until his death, he owned a 25% share of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Although he was passionate about the team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the [[1960 World Series]], choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to its radio broadcast. Crosby had arranged for [[Ampex]], another of his financial investments, to record the [[NBC]] telecast on [[kinescope]]. The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by [[Bill Mazeroski]]'s [[walk-off home run]] that won the game for Pittsburgh. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/throwback-thursday-bing-crosby-took-718437 |title=Throwback Thursday: Bing Crosby Took a Swing at Baseball in the 1940s |website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 17, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/sports/baseball/24crosby.html |title=In Bing Crosby's Wine Cellar, Vintage Baseball |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |work=The New York Times |date=September 23, 2010 |access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref> The restored broadcast was shown on [[MLB Network]] in December 2010.

Crosby was also an avid golfer, and in 1978, he and Bob Hope were voted the [[Bob Jones Award]], the highest honor given by the [[United States Golf Association]] in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship. He is a member of the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]], having been inducted in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldgolfhalloffame.org/bing-crosby/ |title=Bing Crosby |publisher=World Golf Hall of Fame |access-date=July 23, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1937, Crosby hosted the first 'Crosby Clambake' as it was popularly known, at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California|Rancho Santa Fe]], California, the event's location prior to World War II.

Now the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf. In 1950, he became the third person to win the William D. Richardson award, which is given to a non-professional golfer "who has consistently made an outstanding contribution to golf".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gwaa.com/gwaa-awards-and-contests/william-d-richardson-award/ |title=William D.

Crosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of ''[[The King of Jazz]]''. Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap. He competed in both the [[The Amateur Championship|British]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at [[Cypress Point Club|Cypress Point]].

Crosby was a keen fisherman especially in his younger days but it was a pastime that he enjoyed throughout his life. In the summer of 1966 he spent a week as the guest of Lord Egremont, staying in [[Cockermouth]] and fishing on the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]]. His trip was filmed for ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], although all did not go well at first as the [[salmon]] were not running. He did make up for it at the end of the week by catching a number of [[sea trout]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trouthotel.co.uk/journal/bing-crosby-came-stay/ |title=When Bing Crosby came to stay |publisher=Trout Hotel Web |date=April 18, 2017 |access-date=May 13, 2017}}</ref>

Crosby reportedly had an alcohol problem in his youth, and may have been dismissed from Paul Whiteman's orchestra because of it, but he later got a handle on his drinking.

However, Bing Crosby's daughter Mary Crosby said in an interview that Gary Crosby told her the publishers had encouraged him to exaggerate his claims and he had written the book just for money.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bingcrosby.com/bing-bio/the-crosby-family |title=The Crosby Family |website=bingcrosby.com |access-date=July 23, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Crosby's younger son Phillip vociferously disputed his brother Gary's claims about their father. Around the time Gary published his claims, Phillip stated to the press that "Gary is a whining, bitching crybaby, walking around with a two-by-four on his shoulder and just daring people to nudge it off."<ref name="Haller">{{cite web |last1=Haller |first1=Scott |title=The Sad Ballad of Bing and His Boys |url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-sad-ballad-of-bing-and-his-boys-vol-19-no-11/ |website=People.com |access-date=July 5, 2018 |date=21 March 1983}}</ref> Nevertheless, Phillip did not deny that Crosby believed in corporal punishment.<ref name="Haller" /> In an interview with ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine, Phillip stated that "we never got an extra whack or a cuff we didn't deserve".<ref name="Haller" /> During an interview in 1999 by the ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'', Phillip said:

{{Blockquote|My dad was not the monster my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond memories of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote ''Going My Own Way'' out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.<ref name="Grudens, 2002, p. 59">Grudens, 2002, p. 59.</ref>}}

However, Dennis and Lindsay Crosby confirmed that Bing sometimes subjected his sons to harsh physical discipline and verbal put-downs. Regarding the writing of Gary's memoir, Lindsay said, "I'm glad [Gary] did it. I hope it clears up a lot of the old lies and rumors."<ref name="Haller" /> Unlike Gary, though, Lindsay stated that he preferred to remember "all the good things I did with my dad and forget the times that were rough".<ref name="Haller" /> When the book was published, Dennis distanced himself by calling it "Gary's business" but did not publicly deny its claims.<ref name="Haller" /> Bing's younger brother, singer and jazz bandleader [[Bob Crosby]], recalled at the time of Gary's revelations that Bing was a "disciplinarian", as their mother and father had been. He added, "We were brought up that way."<ref name="Haller" /> In an interview for the same article, Gary clarified that Bing "was like a lot of fathers of that time. He was not out to be vicious, to beat children for his kicks."<ref name="Haller" />

Crosby's will established a [[blind trust]] in which none of the sons received an inheritance until they reached the age of 65.<ref name="Dunn">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-13/local/me-242_1_lindsay-crosby |first=Ashley |last=Dunn |date=December 13, 1989 |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Lindsay Crosby Suicide Laid to End of Inheritance Income |access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref>

Lindsay Crosby died in 1989 at age 51, and Dennis Crosby died in 1991 at age 56, both by suicide from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Gary Crosby died of lung cancer in 1995 at age 62, and Phillip Crosby died of a heart attack in 2004 at age 69.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/20/arts/philip-crosby-69-son-of-bing-crosby.html |title=Philip Crosby, 69, Son of Bing Crosby |work=The New York Times |date=January 20, 2004 |access-date=November 2, 2008}}</ref>

Widow [[Kathryn Crosby]] dabbled in local theater productions intermittently and appeared in television tributes to her late husband.

[[Nathaniel Crosby]], Crosby's younger son from his second marriage, is a former high-level golfer who won the [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] in 1981 at age 19, becoming the youngest winner in the history of that event at the time. [[Harry Crosby (businessman)|Harry Crosby]] is an investment banker who occasionally makes singing appearances.

[[Denise Crosby]], Dennis Crosby's daughter, is also an actress and is known for her role as [[Tasha Yar]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and for the recurring role of the Romulan [[Sela (Star Trek)|Sela]] after her withdrawal from the series as a regular cast member. She also appeared in the film adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Pet Sematary]]''.

In 2006, Crosby's niece through his sister Mary Rose, Carolyn Schneider, published the laudatory book ''Me and Uncle Bing''.

There have been disputes between Crosby's two families beginning in the late 1990s. When Dixie died in 1952, her will provided that her share of the community property be distributed in trust to her sons. After Crosby's death in 1977, he left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of his widow, Kathryn, and HLC Properties, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of managing his interests, including his right of publicity. In 1996, Dixie's trust sued HLC and Kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust's entitlement to interest, dividends, royalties, and other income derived from the community property of Crosby and Dixie. In 1999, the parties settled for approximately $1.5&nbsp;million. Relying on a retroactive amendment to the [[California Civil Code]], Dixie's trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby's right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie's trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. The trial court granted Dixie's trust's claim. The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim. In light of the court's ruling, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether a right of publicity can be characterized as [[community property]] under California law.<ref>''Crosby v.

Following his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection of his right lung in January 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to start a new spate of albums and concerts. In March 1977, after videotaping a concert at the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena for CBS to commemorate his 50th anniversary in show business, and with Bob Hope looking on, Crosby fell off the stage into an [[orchestra pit]], rupturing a disc in his back requiring a month in the hospital.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bing Crosby, 73, Dies in Madrid At Golf Course |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/15/archives/bing-crosby-73-dies-in-madrid-at-golf-course-bing-crosby-73-dies-at.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 15, 1977 |access-date=October 25, 2020}}</ref> His first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977 at the [[Concord Pavilion]] in [[Concord, California|Concord]], California.

In September, Crosby, his family and singer [[Rosemary Clooney]] began a concert tour of Britain that included two weeks at the [[London Palladium]]. While in the UK, Crosby recorded his final album, ''[[Seasons (Bing Crosby album)|Seasons]]'', and his final TV [[Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas|Christmas special]] with guest [[David Bowie]] on September 11 (which aired a little over a month after Crosby's death). His last concert was in the [[Brighton Centre]] on October 10, four days before his death, with British entertainer <!-- Not a DBE until the 1979 New Year Honours. -->[[Gracie Fields]] in attendance. The following day he made his final appearance in a recording studio and sang eight songs at the BBC's [[Maida Vale Studios]] for a radio program, which also included an interview with [[Alan Dell]].<ref name="barnes">{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Ken |title=The Crosby Years |publisher=Saint Martins Press |location=New York |year=1980 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/crosbyyears00barn/page/57 57–60] |isbn=978-0-312-17663-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/crosbyyears00barn/page/57}}</ref> Accompanied by the Gordon Rose Orchestra, Crosby's last recorded performance was of the song "[[Once in a While (1937 song)|Once in a While]]".
