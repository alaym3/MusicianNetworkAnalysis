On June 6, 2017, Knocked Loose were announced to be supporting [[Every Time I Die]] along with Hollow Earth for a late 2017 tour of the United States, spanning September and October.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2017/06/06/every-time-i-die-announce-fall-2017-tour-with-knocked-loose-and-hollow-earth/|title=Every Time I Die Announce Fall 2017 Tour with Knocked Loose and Hollow Earth|publisher=Metalsucks.net|date=June 6, 2017}}</ref> A month later, in July 2017, the band announced a November UK tour, also supporting Every Time I Die but instead playing alongside Canadian hardcore band [[Comeback Kid (band)|Comeback Kid]] for a select few dates.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/every-time-i-die-comeback-kid-and-knocked-loose-have-announced-a-tour|title=EVERY TIME I DIE, COMEBACK KID AND KNOCKED LOOSE HAVE ANNOUNCED A TOUR|magazine=Rock Sound|access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref> In the summer of 2017, Knocked Loose played every date of the Vans Warped Tour on the Full Sail stage alongside bands such as Trophy Eyes, Boston Manor, and Movements.

However, before the tour, after members of Stone were accused of sexual assault allegations, Knocked Loose dropped them from the tour and replaced them with Year of the Knife.

Most of the dates of their first headliner were sold out which allowed them to open for [[Parkway Drive]] and for [[Thy Art Is Murder]] on their European tours and also to play a few dates on the main stage of the last [[Warped Tour]].

In the fall of 2018, Knocked Loose opened up for [[Beartooth (band)|Beartooth]] on their Disease tour with [[Sylar (band)|Sylar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bringthenoise.com/blog/beartooth-release-two-new-singles-announce|title=Beartooth Release Two New Singles, Announce Headlining Tour With Knocked Loose & Sylar / the NOISE|website=Beartooth Release Two New Singles, Announce Headlining Tour With Knocked Loose & Sylar / the NOISE}}</ref> Knocked Loose then embarked on a headliner in the Spring of 2019.

== Musical style ==
Knocked Loose have been categorized under several sub-genres by the media and publications alike, including metalcore, hardcore punk, and beatdown hardcore. ''New Noise'', when reviewing their debut album [[Laugh Tracks (Knocked Loose album)|Laugh Tracks]], described the band's sound as being akin to "[[Comeback Kid (band)|Comeback Kid]] at their heaviest with some added doses of [[Slayer]] riffs and [[Code Orange (band)|Code Orange]]-style malice".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newnoisemagazine.com/album-review-knocked-loose-laugh-tracks/|title=Knocked Loose – 'Laugh Tracks'|work=New Noise|date=September 15, 2016}}</ref> Bryan Garris, the band's lead vocalist, has described their sound as being "sandwiched between hardcore and metalcore", although he has stated that the band's intention was to produce a diverse sound that was difficult to categorize.<ref name="AP" /> Knocked Loose have been credited as one of the forerunners of the first-wave metalcore "revival" scene of the late 2010s, alongside bands such as Code Orange, [[Counterparts (band)|Counterparts]], [[Kublai Khan (band)|Kublai Khan]], [[Varials]] and [[Jesus Piece (band)|Jesus Piece]] .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/7-metalcore-revival-bands|title=7 Metalcore Revival Bands You Need To Know About|work=The Odyssey Online|date=October 26, 2017}}</ref>

As is common within the [[metalcore]] and [[hardcore punk]] genres, Knocked Loose incorporate slow-tempo [[Breakdown (music)|breakdowns]] into their music.
