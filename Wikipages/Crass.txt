'''Crass''' were an English [[art collective]] and [[punk rock]] band formed in [[Epping, Essex]] in 1977,<ref>''"In August 1977 Dave King went (...) As Dave exits stage left, Steve Ignorant returns to Dial House and (...) Crass was born."'' {{cite book |author=Berger, George |title=The Story of Crass |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |year=2006 |page=76}}</ref> who promoted [[anarchism]] as a political ideology, a [[lifestylism|way of life]], and a [[resistance movement]]. Crass popularised the [[anarcho-punk]] movement of the [[punk subculture]], advocating [[direct action]], [[animal rights]], [[feminism]], [[anti-fascism]], and [[environmentalism]]. The band used and advocated a [[DIY ethic]] approach to its albums, [[sound collage]]s, leaflets, and films.

Crass spray-painted stencilled [[graffiti]] messages in the [[London Underground]] system and on advertising billboards, coordinated [[Squatting|squats]] and organised political action. The band expressed its ideals by dressing in black, military-surplus-style clothing and using a stage backdrop amalgamating [[icon]]s of perceived authority such as the [[Christian cross]], the [[swastika]], the [[Union Jack]], and the [[ouroboros]].

The band was critical of the punk subculture<ref>{{cite book |quote=We believed that you could no more be a socialist [band] and signed to CBS (The Clash) than you could be an anarchist and signed to EMI |last=Rimbaud |first=Penny |year=2004 |title=Love Songs |publisher=Pomona Publishing |page=xxiv |isbn=1-904590-03-9}}</ref> and [[youth culture]] in general; nevertheless, the anarchist ideas that they promoted have maintained a presence in punk.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=explore|id=style/d11374|label=Anarchist Punk genre}}</ref> Due to their free experimentation and use of tape collages, graphics, spoken word releases, poetry, and improvisation, they have been associated with [[avant-punk]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2010/12/03/crass-the-anarcho-punk-fountainhead-is-coming-to-sf-in-march-sort-of|title=Crass, the Anarcho-Punk Fountainhead, Is Coming to S.F. in March -- Sort Of|first=Josh|last=Graham|date=3 December 2010|access-date=11 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/16660-louder-than-words-walk-through|title=Reading And Rioting: A Louder Than Words Walk Through|magazine=The Quietus|date=11 November 2014|access-date=11 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_uk/article/gvdkbm/smoke-gets-in-your-eyes-anthony-mccalls-enchanting-film-installations|title=Smoke Gets In Your Eyes: Anthony McCall's Enchanting Film Installations|first=Erica|last=Gonsales|website=Creators.vice.com|date=25 May 2011|access-date=11 November 2017}}</ref> and [[art punk]].<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/28/popandrock.shopping4|first1=Dorian|last1=Lynskey|title=Jeffrey Lewis, 12 Crass Songs|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=28 September 2007}}</ref>

== History ==

=== 1977: Origins ===
[[File:Crass steve 1981.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Steve Ignorant onstage, June 1981|Steve Ignorant onstage, June 1981]]

The band was based around an anarchist [[commune]] in a 16th century cottage, [[Dial House, Essex|Dial House]], near [[Epping, Essex|Epping]], Essex,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,3605,417770,00.html|work=The Guardian|author=Iain Aitch|date=5 January 2001|title=Country house anarchy}}</ref> and formed when commune founder [[Penny Rimbaud]] began jamming with [[Steve Ignorant]]<ref>Sleeve note on ''Bullshit Detector Volume 1'' (Crass Records, cat no.421984/4); ''"Sometime in 1977 Rimbaud and Ignorant started messing around with a song called 'owe us a living'. They ran through it a few times and decided to form a band consisting of themselves. They called themselves Crass"''</ref> (who was staying in the house at the time). Ignorant was inspired to form a band after seeing [[The Clash]] perform at Colston Hall in [[Bristol]],<ref name="ReferenceA">"At the end of the Clash gig there was all these people shouting and saying 'your shit!' and Joe Strummer stood there and said 'if you think you can do any better go ahead and start your own band.' And I was like what a great idea!" {{cite web |url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/anarcho_punk/steve_ignorant_interview_2007.htm |title=Steve Ignorant Interview |website=Punk77.co.uk}}</ref> whilst Rimbaud, a veteran of avant garde [[performance art]] groups such as [[EXIT (performance art group)|EXIT]] and Ceres Confusion,<ref>Rimbaud, P; "...EXIT – 'The Mystic Trumpeter, Live at the Roundhouse 1972'" accompanying booklet, Exitstencil Recordings 2013</ref> was working on his book ''Reality Asylum''. They produced "So What?" and "Do They Owe Us A Living?" as a drum-and-vocal duo.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rimbaud, P |title=Love Songs |page=xxi |publisher=Pomona Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-904590-03-9}}</ref> They briefly called themselves Stormtrooper{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=14}} before choosing Crass in reference to a line in the [[David Bowie]] song "[[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]" ("The kids was just crass").{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999a|p=99}}

Other friends and household members joined (including [[Gee Vaucher]], [[Pete Wright (musician)|Pete Wright]], [[N. A. Palmer]] and Steve Herman), and Crass played their first live gig at a squatted [[Street party|street festival]] in Huntley Street, [[North London]]. They planned to play five songs, but a neighbour "pulled the plug" after three.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=83}} Guitarist Steve Herman left the band soon afterwards, and was replaced by Phil Clancey, aka [[Phil Free]].{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=86}} [[Joy De Vivre]] and [[Eve Libertine]] also joined around this time. Other early Crass performances included a four-date tour of New York City,{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=93}} a festival gig in [[Covent Garden]]<ref name="punk77.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/anarcho_punk/steve_ignorant_interview_2007.htm |title=Steve Ignorant interviewed |website=Punk77.co.uk |year=2007}}</ref> and regular appearances with the [[U.K. Subs]] at [[The White Lion, Putney]] and Action Space in central London. The latter performances were often poorly attended: "The audience consisted mostly of us when the Subs played and the Subs when we played".<ref name=rimbaudsleevenote>Rimbaud, P; "...In Which Crass Voluntarily Blow Their Own", sleeve note essay included with ''Best Before 1984'' album</ref>

Crass played two gigs at the [[The Roxy (Covent Garden)|Roxy Club]] in Covent Garden, London.<ref name="punk77.co.uk"/> According to Rimbaud, the band arrived drunk at the second show and were ejected from the stage; this inspired their song, "Banned from the Roxy",<ref>{{cite web |title="Banned from the Roxy" from ''Feeding the 5000'' |publisher=Small Wonder Records |year=1978 |url=http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/crass/bannedfromtheroxy.html}}</ref> and Rimbaud's essay for Crass' self-published magazine ''International Anthem'', "Crass at the Roxy".<ref>{{cite web|author=Rimbaud, Penny |title="Crass at the Roxy" from ''International Anthem 1'' |year=1977 |url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/anthem1/anthem1_4.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201130815/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/anthem1/anthem1_4.html |archive-date=1 December 2005 }}</ref> After the incident the band took themselves more seriously, avoiding alcohol and cannabis before shows and wearing black, military surplus-style clothing on and offstage.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=103}}

[[File:The Crass logo.png|thumb|alt=Crass logo|Crass logo]]They introduced their stage backdrop, a logo designed by Rimbaud's friend [[Dave King (artist)|Dave King]].{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=23}} This gave the band a militaristic image, which led to accusations of fascism.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=104}} Crass countered that their uniform appearance was intended to be a statement against the "[[cult of personality]]", so (in contrast to many rock bands) no member would be identified as the "leader".{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=104}}

Conceived and intended as cover artwork for a self-published pamphlet version of Rimbaud's ''Christ's Reality Asylum'',{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=13}} the Crass logo was an amalgam of several "icons of authority" including the [[Christian cross]], the [[swastika]], the [[Union Jack]] and a two-headed [[Ouroboros]] (symbolising the idea that power will eventually destroy itself).{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999a|p=90}}<ref name="Crass interview">{{cite journal |title=Crass interview |journal=New Crimes |issue=3 |date=Winter 1980}}</ref> Using such deliberately mixed messages was part of Crass' strategy of presenting themselves as a "barrage of contradictions",<ref>{{cite journal |title=Crass interview |journal=[[The Leveller]] |issue=25 |date=April 1979}}</ref> challenging audiences to (in Rimbaud's words) "make your own fucking minds up".{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=90}} This included using loud, aggressive music to promote a [[pacifism|pacifist]] message,{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=89}} a reference to their [[Dada]]ist, performance-art backgrounds and [[Situationist International|situationist]] ideas.{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=88}}

The band eschewed elaborate [[stage lighting]] during live sets, preferring to play under 40-watt household light bulbs; the technical difficulties of filming under such lighting conditions partly explains why there is little live footage of Crass.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=108|ps=: "They were very difficult to film, because with Super-8 you needed far more light than was available at a Crass gig – all you'd get was shadows and light – that would be about it. So it was a bit pointless filming the gigs. I did try asking for maybe 60 watt bulbs instead of 40 but there was no deal" – Mick Duffield}} They pioneered [[multimedia art|multimedia]] presentation, using video technology (back-projected films and [[video art|video collages]] by Mick Duffield and [[Gee Vaucher]]) to enhance their performances, and also distributed leaflets and handouts explaining anarchist ideas to their audiences.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=185}}

=== 1978–1979: ''The Feeding of the 5000'' and Crass Records ===
{{main|Crass Records}}
Crass' first release was ''[[The Feeding of the 5000 (album)|The Feeding of the 5000]]'' (an 18-track, 12" [[Gramophone record|45 rpm]] EP on the [[Small Wonder Records|Small Wonder]] label) in 1978. Workers at an Irish record-pressing plant refused to handle it due to the allegedly [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] content of the song "Asylum",<ref>{{cite book |author=George Berger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-iqD__ZkppsC&pg=PT182 |title=The Story of Crass |isbn=9780857120120|date = 4 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Maria Raha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-NGokpBxFcC&pg=PA96 |title=Cinderella's Big Score: Women Of The Punk And Indie Underground |page=96 |isbn=9781580051163 |date=31 December 2004}}</ref> and the record was released without it. In its place were two minutes of silence, entitled "The Sound of Free Speech". This incident prompted Crass to set up their own [[independent record label]], [[Crass Records]], to prevent Small Wonder from being placed in a compromising position and to retain editorial control over their material.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ignorant, Steve |year=2010 |title=The Rest is Propaganda |publisher=Southern Records |page=167}}</ref>

A re-recorded, extended version of "Asylum", renamed "Reality Asylum", was shortly afterwards released on Crass Records as a [[Single (music)|7]]" single and Crass were investigated by the police due to the song's lyrics. The band were interviewed at their Dial House home by [[Scotland Yard]]'s vice squad, and threatened with prosecution; however, the case was dropped.<ref name=rimbaudsleevenote /> "Reality Asylum" retailed at 45[[Coins of the pound sterling|p]] (when most other singles cost about 90p),{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=137}} and was the first example of Crass' "pay no more than..." policy: issuing records as inexpensively as possible. The band failed to factor [[value added tax]] into their expenses, causing them to lose money on every copy sold.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=138}} A year later Crass Records released new pressings of "The Feeding of the 5000" (subtitled "The Second Sitting"), restoring the original version of "Asylum".

=== 1980: ''Stations of the Crass'' and ''Bloody Revolutions'' ===
[[File:Crass3.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Guitarist and singer on stage|Crass, 1981; [[N. A. Palmer]] (left) and [[Steve Ignorant]] pictured at [[Digbeth Civic Hall]], Birmingham]]In 1979 the band released their second album (''[[Stations of the Crass]]''), financed with a loan from [[Poison Girls]],<ref>Rimbaud, P; sleeve notes to 'The Crassical Collection; Stations of the Crass' Crass Records, 2010</ref> a band with whom they regularly appeared. This was a double album, with three sides of new material and a fourth side recorded live at the Pied Bull in [[Islington]].

The next Crass single, 1980's "Bloody Revolutions", was a benefit release with Poison Girls which raised £20,000 to fund the [[Wapping Autonomy Centre]].{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=23}} The words were a critique (from an anarchist-pacifist perspective) of the traditional [[Marxist]] view of [[Revolution|revolutionary struggle]], and were (in part) a response to violence marring a gig at [[Conway Hall]] in London's [[Red Lion Square]] at which both bands performed in September 1979.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=169}} The show was intended as a benefit for the so-called "Persons Unknown", a group of anarchists facing [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=145}} During the performance [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] supporters and other [[anti-fascists]] attacked [[British Movement]] [[neo-Nazi]]s, triggering violence.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lux, Martin |title=Anti-Fascist |publisher=Phoenix Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-948984-35-8|page=89}}</ref> Crass afterwards argued that the leftists were largely to blame for the fighting, and organizations such as [[Rock Against Racism]] were causing audiences to become polarised into left- and right-wing factions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greengalloway.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/spice-girls-to-cover-crass-song.html |date=23 October 2007 |title=Anarchy in UK: Crass interviewed: 1979  |work=greengalloway |publisher=[[Blogspot]] |quote=But Crass blame this on Rock Against Racism which, they allege, has polarised youth. "If you're not in RAR then you're a Nazi. Now we're sandwiched between left-wing violence and right-wing violence" – Crass interviewed in "New Society", 1979}}</ref> Others (including the anarchist organisation [[Class War]]) were critical of Crass's position, stating that "like [[Kropotkin]], their politics are up shit creek".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Assault on Culture – Utopian Currents From Lettrisme to Class War |publisher=Aporia Press |last=Home |first=Stewart |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-948518-88-1 |page=96 |quote=like Kropotkin, their politics are up shit creek}}</ref> Many of the band's punk followers felt that they failed to understand the violence to which they were subjected from the right.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=149}}

[[File:Crass Joy.jpg|thumb|alt=Crass singer Joy De Vivre|Crass singer [[Joy De Vivre]], 1984]]"Rival Tribal Rebel Revel", a [[flexi disc]] single given away with the ''Toxic Grafity''{{sic}} [[fanzine]], was also a commentary about the events at Conway Hall attacking the mindless violence and [[tribalism|tribalistic]] aspects of contemporary youth culture.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mike Diboll |publisher=Kill Your Pet Puppy |title=Crass – Toxic Grafity Fanzine |year=1979 |url=http://killyourpetpuppy.co.uk/news/toxic-grafity-fanzine-1979/}}</ref> This was followed by the single, "Nagasaki Nightmare/Big A Little A". The strongly [[anti-nuclear]] lyrics of the first song were reinforced by the fold-out-sleeve artwork. It featured an article by Mike Holderness of ''[[Peace News]]'' magazine connecting the [[atomic power]] industry and the manufacture of nuclear weapons,<ref>Mike Holderness, sleeve notes of "Nagasaki Nightmare/Big A Little A" single, Crass Records, 1980</ref> and a large poster-style map of nuclear installations in the UK. The other side of the record, "Big A Little A", was a statement of the band's anti-statist and individualist anarchist philosophy:

"Be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do / I am he and she is she but you're the only you."<ref>Rimbaud, P; "Big A Little A", Crass Records 1980. Quoted in ''Love Songs'' p.57, Pomona Publishing {{ISBN|1-904590-03-9}}</ref>

=== 1981: ''Penis Envy'' ===
[[File:Crass in Loving magazine.png|thumb|left|alt=Magazine record ad|''Loving'' ad for "Our Wedding"]]Crass released their third album, ''[[Penis Envy (album)|Penis Envy]]'', in 1981. This marked a departure from the hardcore-punk image  ''The Feeding of the 5000'' and ''Stations of the Crass'' had given the group. It featured more-complex musical arrangements and female vocals by [[Eve Libertine]] and [[Joy De Vivre]] (singer Steve Ignorant was credited as "not on this recording"). The album addressed feminist issues, attacking marriage and [[sexual repression]].

The last track on ''Penis Envy'', a parody of an [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] [[love song]] entitled "Our Wedding", was made available as a white [[flexi disc]] to readers of ''Loving'', a teenage romance magazine. Crass tricked the magazine into offering the disc, posing as "Creative Recording And Sound Services". ''Loving'' accepted the offer, telling their readers that the free Crass flexi would make "your wedding day just that bit extra special".<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern Studios archive |url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09410.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309043333/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09410.html |archive-date=9 March 2005 }}</ref> A [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] controversy resulted when the hoax was exposed, with the ''[[News of the World]]'' stating that the title of the flexi's originating album was "too obscene to print".<ref>{{cite web|title=News of the World |date=7 June 1981 |page=13 |url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09410d.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320134115/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09410d.html |archive-date=20 March 2005 }}</ref> Despite ''Loving''{{'}}s annoyance, Crass had broken no laws.{{sfn|Berger|2006}}

The album was banned by the retailer HMV,<ref name="Rimbaud">Rimbaud, P; "...In Which Crass Voluntarily Blow Their Own", sleeve note essay included with Best Before 1984 album</ref> and copies of the album were seized from the Eastern Bloc record shop by [[Greater Manchester Police]] under the direction of [[Chief Constable]] [[James Anderton]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Petley, Julian |title=Smashed Hits: Overview |url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/4107/1/Fulltext.pdf}}</ref> The shop owners were charged with displaying [[Obscene Publications Act|"obscene articles for publication for gain"]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Flux of Pink Indians – F.C.T.U.L.P. – Alternative Mixes – 1984 |publisher=Kill Your Pet Puppy |url=http://killyourpetpuppy.co.uk/news/flux-of-pink-indians-f-c-t-u-l-p-alternative-mixes-1984/}}</ref> The judge ruled against Crass in the ensuing court case, although the decision was overturned by the [[Court of Appeal]] (except the lyrics to one song, "Bata Motel", which were upheld as "sexually provocative and obscene").<ref name="Rimbaud_a">Rimbaud, P; sleeve notes to 'The Crassical Collection; Ten Notes on a Summer's Day' Crass Records, 2012</ref>

=== {{anchor|1982–1983: ''Christ&nbsp;– The Album'' and a change of strategy}}1982–1983: ''Christ&nbsp;– The Album'' and strategy change ===
[[File:Crass steve dec1981.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Steve Ignorant and N.A. Palmer|Steve Ignorant and N.A. Palmer pictured at the Wapping Autonomy Centre, December 1981]]The band's fourth LP, 1982's double set ''[[Christ - The Album]]'', took almost a year to record, produce and mix (during which the [[Falklands War]] broke out and ended). This caused Crass to question their approach to making records. As a group whose primary purpose was [[Political criticism|political commentary]], they felt overtaken and made redundant by world events:

{{quote|The speed with which the Falklands War was played out and the devastation that Thatcher was creating both at home and abroad, forced us to respond far faster than we had ever needed to before. ''Christ – The Album'' had taken so long to produce that some of the songs in it, songs that warned of the imminence of riots and war, had become almost redundant. Toxteth, Bristol, Brixton and the Falklands were ablaze by the time that we released. We felt embarrassed by our slowness, humbled by our inadequacy.<ref name="Rimbaud" />}}

Subsequent releases (including the singles "How Does It Feel? (to Be the Mother of a Thousand Dead)" and "Sheep Farming in the Falklands" and the album ''[[Yes Sir, I Will]]'') saw the band's sound go back to basics and were issued as "tactical responses" to political situations.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=220}} They anonymously produced 20,000 copies of a flexi-disc with a live recording of "Sheep Farming...", copies of which were randomly inserted into the sleeves of other records by sympathetic workers at the [[Rough Trade Records]] distribution warehouse to spread their views to those who might not otherwise hear them.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=215}}

=== Direct Action and internal debates ===
[[File:Stations.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Album cover, featuring graffiti|Detail from front cover of ''[[Stations of the Crass]]'', illustrating Crass' stenciled graffiti]]
From their early days of spraying stencilled [[anti-war]], anarchist, [[feminist]] and [[anti-consumerist]] [[graffiti]] messages in the [[London Underground]] and on billboards,{{sfn|McKay|1996|p=87}} Crass was involved in politically motivated [[direct action]] and musical activities. On 18 December 1982, the band helped co-ordinate a 24-hour squat in the empty west London Zig Zag club to prove "that the underground punk scene could handle itself responsibly when it had to and that music really could be enjoyed free of the restraints imposed upon it by corporate industry".{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=25}}

In 1983 and 1984, Crass were part of the [[Stop the City]] actions co-ordinated by [[London Greenpeace]]{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=247}} which foreshadowed the [[anti-globalisation]] rallies of the early 21st century.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=248}} Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to [[non-violence]]. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for us, and I think a lot of our records show that, inadvertently".{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=99}} This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance.{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999a|p=249}} Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was ''[[Acts of Love (album)|Acts of Love]]'': [[European classical music|classical-music]] settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as "songs to my other self" and intended to celebrate "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".<ref>[[Liner notes|Sleeve notes]] of ''Acts of Love'', Crass Records, 1985.</ref>

=== Thatchergate ===
Another Crass [[hoax]] was known as the "[[Thatchergate]] tapes",<ref name=killyourpetpuppy-thatchergate>{{Cite web|url=https://killyourpetpuppy.co.uk/news/crass-capital-radio-reagan-thatcher-tape-new-broadcast-270184/|title=Crass – Thatchergate Tape And News Broadcasts – January 1984|website=Killyourpetpuppy.co.uk |date=2 November 2007}}</ref> a recording of an apparently accidentally overheard telephone conversation (due to crossed lines).

== Influences ==
[[File:Crass2.jpg|thumb|Crass onstage]]
For Rimbaud the initial inspiration for founding Crass was the death of his friend [[Wally Hope|Phil 'Wally Hope' Russell]], as detailed in his book ''The Last of the Hippies: An Hysterical Romance''. Russell had been placed in a [[psychiatric]] hospital after helping to set up the first [[Stonehenge free festival]] in 1974, and died shortly afterwards. Rimbaud believed that Russell was murdered by the State for political reasons.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Last of the Hippies – An Hysterical Romance |last=Rimbaud |first=Penny |author-link=Penny Rimbaud |year=1982 |publisher=Crass |url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/britain/sp001297.txt |quote=The court passed a verdict of suicide with no reference at all to the appalling treatment that had been the direct cause of it. [...] Our inquiries convinced us that what had happened was not an accident. The state had intended to destroy Wally's spirit, if not his life, because he was a threat, a fearless threat who they hoped they could destroy without much risk of embarrassment.}}</ref> Co-founder Ignorant has cited The Clash<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and David Bowie{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999a|p=99}} as major personal influences. Band members have also cited influences ranging from [[existentialism]] and [[Zen]] to [[situationism]],{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=33}} the poetry of [[Baudelaire]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/05258-penny-rimbaud-crass-interview|title=The Quietus - Features - A Quietus Interview - Penny Rimbaud On Crass & The Poets Of Transcendentalism & Modernism|website=The Quietus}}</ref> British working class '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' literature and films such as ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://litopia.com/steve-ignorant-crass-warrior/|title=Steve Ignorant: Crass Warrior|website=Litopia.com}}</ref> and the films of [[Anthony McCall]]{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=33}} (McCall's ''Four Projected Movements'' was shown as part of an early Crass performance).{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=146}}

Crass have said that their musical influences were seldom drawn from rock, but more from classical music (particularly [[Benjamin Britten]], on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based),{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=95}} [[free jazz]],<ref name="Rimbaud_a" /> European [[atonality]],<ref name="Rimbaud_a" /> and avant-garde composers such as [[John Cage]]<ref name="Crass interview"/> and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].<ref name="Rimbaud_a" />

== Legacy ==
Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Savage, Jon |year=1991 |title=England's Dreaming: Sex Pistols and Punk Rock |page=584|isbn=978-0571227204}}</ref> The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the [[peace movement]] and the UK [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] during the late 1970s and early 1980s.{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999a|p=109}} Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Researcher Richard Cross stated: {{cquote|In their own writing, Crass somewhat overstate the contribution that anarcho-punk made to resuscitating the moribund Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in the early 1980s. The initiation of a new arms race, confirmed by plans to deploy first-strike Cruise and Pershing nuclear missiles across Europe, revived anti-nuclear movements across the continent, and would have arisen with or without the intercession of anarcho-punk. What Crass and anarcho-punk can quite legitimately claim is to have convinced a substantial number of radical youth to commit their energies to the most militant anti-militarist wings of the disarmament movement, which laid siege to nuclear installations across the country and which saw no conflict between its pacifist precepts and its willingness to commit acts of 'criminal damage' on the military property of the nuclear state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://killyourpetpuppy.co.uk/news/hippies-now-wear-black-rich-cross/|title=Hippies Now Wear Black/ Rich Cross|website=Killyourpetpuppy.co.uk|date=10 February 2008}}</ref>}}
