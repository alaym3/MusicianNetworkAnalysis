===The Stone Roses===
Brown's music career began in 1980, playing bass guitar in a band with [[John Squire]] and [[Simon Wolstencroft]].<ref name="Robb31">Robb, p. 31</ref> They eventually became the Patrol, with Andy Couzens on vocals.

In 1983, Brown joined the Waterfront, the band that would evolve into the Stone Roses, as co-vocalist.<ref name="Robb71">Robb, p. 71</ref>

The Stone Roses rose to prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their debut album voted the best British album of all time in 2004.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3823983.stm Stone Roses 'top British album']", [[BBC]], 20 June 2004, retrieved 12 August 2011</ref> The band's second album, ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'', received a mixed reaction, and after several changes of line-up, the band split up in October 1996.
