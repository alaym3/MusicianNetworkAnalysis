'''Evergrey''' is a Swedish heavy metal band.

==History==
Evergrey was formed in 1995 in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden as a [[progressive power metal]] band, in contrast to the [[melodic death metal]] that Gothenburg is known for. Since then, the band's lyrics have always been of the darker sort, and the same can be said of the band's imagery. ''The Dark Discovery'' was recorded in 1996 and released in 1998, and ''[[Solitude, Dominance, Tragedy]]'' was recorded and released in 1999. While those two albums dealt with a variety of ideas, many later albums have been [[concept album]]s, dealing with issues like [[paranoia]] and [[alien abduction]] in ''[[In Search of Truth]]'' (2001).

''[[Recreation Day]]'', released in 2003, is an album that covers many issues, ranging from death and [[mourning]] to general fear and [[Sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], all of which contribute to a greater concept of self-reformation. These ideas are explored from many different points of view, such as someone contemplating [[suicide]] ("As I Lie Here Bleeding"), mourners after a funeral ("I'm Sorry", a cover of [[Dilba]] Demirbag's hit), and dying people's looking back on their "unforgivable" [[sins]] ("Unforgivable"). "Unforgivable" also acted as a catalyst for the next album, ''[[The Inner Circle (album)|The Inner Circle]]'' (2004), which expanded on the issues described in the song: [[cult]]s, religion and child abuse.

On 4 April 2006, Evergrey released their sixth studio album, ''[[Monday Morning Apocalypse]]''. It debuted at No.&nbsp;6 in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evergrey.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=56 |title=#6 debut on the Swedish charts! |publisher=Evergrey.net |date=31 March 2006 |access-date=24 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012022115/http://www.evergrey.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=56 |archive-date=12 October 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Later that year, Evergrey played at many festivals throughout Europe: among others, [[Sweden Rock Festival]], [[Download Festival]], [[Arvika Festival]], [[Masters of Rock (festival)|Masters of Rock]], [[Storsjöyran]] and [[Sziget Festival]]. From 5 to 30 May, the band toured the United States with [[In Flames]], [[Nevermore]] and [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]]. On 15 September, they headlined Prog Power VII in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref name=tourarchive>{{cite web|url=http://www.evergrey.net/tour-archive.php|title=Evergrey tour dates archive|publisher=Evergrey.net|date=6 October 2006|access-date=24 October 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012022016/http://www.evergrey.net/tour-archive.php|archive-date=12 October 2006}}</ref>

On 24 October 2006, Evergrey started a new European tour. They were supported by fellow Swedish [[death metal]] band Avatar,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evergrey.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=59 |title=Evergrey European tour announced |publisher=Evergrey.net |date=28 September 2006 |access-date=24 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012022245/http://www.evergrey.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=59 |archive-date=12 October 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and they visited Germany, Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evergrey.net/tour.php|title=Evergrey European tour dates|publisher=Evergrey.net|date=28 September 2006|access-date=24 October 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012021808/http://www.evergrey.net/tour.php|archive-date=12 October 2006}}</ref>

Evergrey released their seventh studio album, ''[[Torn (Evergrey album)|Torn]]'', in September 2008, continuing with their trademark lyrical themes of desperation and despair. [[Jari Kainulainen]] permanently filled the role on 6 August 2007, who also played bass on Torn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evergrey.net/blog/2007/08/06/so-here-he-is/ |title=So, here he is! |publisher=Evergrey.net |date=6 August 2007 |access-date=6 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122928/http://www.evergrey.net/blog/2007/08/06/so-here-he-is/ |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 8 May 2008, Evergrey announced that they had signed a deal with [[SPV GmbH|Steamhammer/SPV]]. This included the release of their new album and the entire back catalogue. It also was announced that the new album, ''[[Torn (Evergrey album)|Torn]]'', would be released early in September 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.evergrey.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=72 |title=Evergrey.net - The Official Home of Evergrey |publisher=Evergrey.net |date=8 May 2008 |access-date=11 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912014615/http://www.evergrey.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=72 |archive-date=12 September 2008 }} </ref> As the deal includes the band's entire back catalog, there is the possibility of re-releases of previous Evergrey albums with the inclusion of added bonus material.

In July 2008, Swedish/Danish band [[Amaranthe]] announced that keyboardist Rikard Zander, along with In Flames bassist [[Peter Iwers]], would make a guest appearance on their upcoming album.

In May 2010, it was announced that Jonas Ekdahl, Henrik Danhage and [[Jari Kainulainen]] have all left Evergrey by mutual decision because of problems with the band members interacting with each other. They called it quits as to not ruin the friendship they all have with each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evergrey.net/news/time-for-some-changes/|title=Time for some changes|publisher=Evergrey.net|date=7 May 2010|access-date=10 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514144107/http://evergrey.net/news/time-for-some-changes/|archive-date=14 May 2010}}</ref>

An article posted on 13 November 2010 on Evergrey's blog contained dates for upcoming concerts as well as the confirmation of a new album titled ''Glorious Collision'' on 28 February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evergrey.net/news/about-the-upcoming-concerts/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201141924/http://evergrey.net/news/about-the-upcoming-concerts/ |archive-date=1 December 2010 }}</ref>

Via [[Facebook]] posts in November 2013, while writing the next Evergrey album due for release in 2014, the band first confirmed that drummer Hannes Van Dahl would be leaving the band to join [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]] full-time, and then due to "problems working together" guitarist Marcus Jidell would also be leaving.

In August 2014, the release of the music video for "King of Errors" from the forthcoming ''[[Hymns for the Broken]]'' revealed that Henrik Danhage and Jonas Ekdahl had returned to the band. ''Hymns for the Broken'' was released on September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/evergrey-to-release-hymns-for-the-broken-in-september/ |title=Evergrey To Release 'Hymns For The Broken' In September |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=5 June 2014 |access-date=22 August 2014}}</ref> The band released two more albums after that, ''[[The Storm Within (album)|The Storm Within]]'' in 2016 and ''The Atlantic'' in 2019. Those three albums were mixed and mastered by Jacob Hansen and form a conceptual trilogy.<ref>{{cite web|title=EVERGREY: 'The Atlantic' Album Details Revealed|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/evergrey-the-atlantic-album-details-revealed/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=19 October 2018|date=19 October 2018}}</ref>
