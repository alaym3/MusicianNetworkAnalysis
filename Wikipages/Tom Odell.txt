Within hours of the advert being aired for the first time, the track reached to the top of the music recognition service Shazam's trending list. Within three days of release, it went straight to 21 in the UK top 40, peaking at 7.

Odell's music was featured in a [[Sony]] advert in 2016, with a cover of "[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colours]]" by [[Cyndi Lauper]].

===2016–2017: ''Wrong Crowd''===
Odell began working on his second studio album in 2015, and played a variety of new songs at Forest Live, a concert series in England's forests by the [[Forestry Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|author=charlotte wisbey |url=https://goape.co.uk/forest-live |title=Competition Archives - Go Ape Blog &#124; Follow all the latest news |website=Goape.co.uk |access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref> On 4 April 2016, the first single, "[[Wrong Crowd (song)|Wrong Crowd]]", was released, and an upcoming second studio album [[Wrong Crowd|of the same name]] was announced.

===2017–2020: ''Jubilee Road''===
[[File:Tom.Odell.jpg|thumb|Tom Odelll performing at Orange Warsaw Festival 2016]]
On his 'No Bad Days' tour, Odell revealed he is writing for a new album and played new songs live. In November 2017, he toured Germany on the New Fall Festival in [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Stuttgart]] and announced that the album has been finished and a first single was to be released imminently. On 20 December 2017 Odell announced in an interview on [[BBC Radio 2]] that the new album is scheduled for release in mid-2018. On 14 June 2018, the first single from Odell's upcoming album, "If You Wanna Love Somebody", was released worldwide. '[[Jubilee Road]]' was released on 26 October.

His recent album, Jubilee Road, was released in 2018 and is inspired by his past neighbors and community. The title "Jubilee Road" is supposed to be a reference to a terraced street in east London that Odell lived on, but when he asked his neighbors if he could use the real name, they responded that they were afraid it would become a tourist destination and would rather him create a fictional name.

===2021: ''Monsters''===
"Numb", the first single from Odell's fourth album, was released in February 2021. In an interview with ''The Gentleman's Journal'' on 27 February 2021, it was revealed that Odell's fourth studio album is titled ''[[Monsters (Tom Odell album)|Monsters]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tom Odell talks money, mental strife – and monsters|url=https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/tom-odell-talks-money-mental-strife-and-monsters/|access-date=2021-02-27|website=The Gentleman's Journal|language=en-GB}}</ref> He stated that the album would feature darker, [[Electropop|electro-pop]] tones, and the lyrics were inspired by artists such as [[XXXTentacion]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[Travis Scott]]. The second single from the album, "Monster v.1", was released in March 2021. The album was released on 9 July 2021.

==Influences==
Odell grew up listening to [[Elton John]]. One of the first albums he listened to was ''[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]'' (1973). He also cites [[David Bowie]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Arthur Russell (musician)|Arthur Russell]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Leon Russell]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Sixto Rodriguez|Rodríguez]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]] as influences.<ref name="glamourmagazine.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.shawconnect.ca/music/interview-rising-star-tom-odell/ |title=Welcome to ShawConnect – Music Blog – Interview: Rising star Tom Odell |publisher=Blogs.shawconnect.ca |date=7 February 2013 |access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1028016/tom-odell-named-brits-critics-choice-winner|title=Tom Odell named BRITs Critics' Choice Winner|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=20 December 2012|access-date=22 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="thelineofbestfit.com">{{cite web|last=Tan |first=Emily |url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/introducing/tom-odell-111986 |title=Introducing: Tom Odell |publisher=The Line of Best Fit |date=31 October 2012 |access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.streetnortheast.com/news/interview-with-tom-odell-ahead-of-jake-bugg-show-in-newcastle/ |title=Street North East &#124; Interview with Tom Odell ahead of Jake Bugg show, in Newcastle |publisher=Streetnortheast.com |date=30 November 2012 |access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref> He is a fan of [[Arcade Fire]], [[Adele]], [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]], [[Cat Power]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Beach House]], [[Radiohead]], [[Coldplay]] and [[Ben Folds]].<ref name="glamourmagazine.co.uk"/><ref name="thelineofbestfit.com"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Olivia Schaff |url=http://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/18281/tips-2013-tom-odell.html |title=Tips 2013: Tom Odell &#124; Feature &#124; Music|publisher=Music.thedigitalfix.com |date=20 December 2012 |access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Earnshaw |first=Helen |url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/interviews/tom-odell-interview-288498.html |title=Tom Odell Exclusive Interview |publisher=Femalefirst.co.uk |date=15 April 2013 |access-date=30 June 2013}}</ref>

Odell has said his lyrics are inspired by his "inability to sustain a relationship with someone for longer than six months." He says, "I find that I write much better songs when I'm being honest, and writing about things that happen to me. It can get a little weird though, when friends or girlfriends work out that a song is about them. But it's amazing what you can get away with it. Artistic license, I think they call it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hungertv.com/music/feature/get-to-know-tom-odell/ |title=Get To Know: Tom Odell &#124; Music |publisher=Hunger Tv |access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref>
