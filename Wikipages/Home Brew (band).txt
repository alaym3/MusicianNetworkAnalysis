In 2012, ''Massive Magazine'' wrote:<blockquote>"Their fun and often satirical take on hip-hop is no less pure or cultured because of that, and the well-rehearsed flows and crafted beats are the result of hours of hard work. This fact also makes them an impressive live outfit, and this reputation has seen them steadily become more in demand throughout New Zealand."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.massivemagazine.org.nz/blog/3918/home-brew-and-peace-when-new-zealand-hip-hop-came-of-age/|title=HOME BREW AND @PEACE|date=2012-02-21|newspaper=Massive Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203132756/http://www.massivemagazine.org.nz/blog/3918/home-brew-and-peace-when-new-zealand-hip-hop-came-of-age/|archive-date=3 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>In 2014, one of the band's performances at Lincoln University in Christchurch was shut down after one of its members allegedly punched an audience member in the face.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9798913/Hip-hop-musician-allegedly-punched-teen|title=Hip-hop musician allegedly punched teen|last=Ensor|first=Blair|date=2014-03-06|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=2016-10-15}}</ref>
