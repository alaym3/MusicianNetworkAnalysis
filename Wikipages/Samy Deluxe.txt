'''Samy Sorge''' (born 19 December 1977),<ref>January/February issue of ''Juice'' (2008) - Page 130</ref> commonly known as '''Samy Deluxe''', '''Wickeda MC''' or '''Sam Semillia''', is a German [[Rapping|rapper]] and record producer from [[Hamburg]]. 

== Early life ==
Samy was two years old when his [[Sudan]]ese father left Germany. Samy grew up with his mother's family. His half-sister was born shortly after his father left. The family lived in [[Barmbek]] for many years, then moved to [[Hamburg-Eppendorf|Eppendorf]], a better-off part of Hamburg. His family was able to make this move after a recommendation from a family friend after his mother remarried. He attended the Wolfgang-Borchert-Schule and attained the ''[[Realschulabschluss]]'', or certificate of general education similar to a British GCSE. He cites his upbringing in a middle-class neighbourhood as part of his inspiration. He says he felt out of place, "At (one) point I would stand out in front of my own house and people who lived here before me would ask 'can I help you?{{'"}}. Additionally, he cites American rappers as his inspiration instead of relying on German history. Samy recalls taking up an interest in rap music in 1988.

== Music career ==

In 2001, Samy Deluxe released his [[Samy Deluxe (album)|self-titled debut album]], which ranked No. 2 in the German Album Charts for the 19th calendar week of 2001. The first single from the album, "Hab' gehört...", ranked No. 26. However, the second single, "{{typo|Internetional}} Love", failed to enter the charts. The final single, "Weck mich auf", peaked at No. 4 in Germany, becoming a national hit and the album's most successful single.
Following the success of his solo debut, Samy Deluxe became a highly acclaimed [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist in [[German rap]] and internationally.

In 2003, Samy Deluxe founded the rap duo ASD with fellow rapper [[Afrob]]. They released their debut ''Wer hätte das gedacht''. The lead single from the album, "Sneak Preview", ranked successfully on the German charts. Most of the beats on this album came from American producers, including [[J Dilla]], [[Diamond D]] and [[Waajeed]].

In August 2004, Samy Deluxe released his second solo album, ''Verdammtnochma!''. The album peaked at No. 2 on the German album-charts shortly thereafter and stayed for three weeks in the Top 10. In the same year, he was featured on the German remix of "[[Dip It Low]]" by American singer [[Christina Milian]], which was a commercial success.

In 2005, Samy Deluxe represented [[Hamburg]] in the [[Bundesvision Song Contest 2005]], with the song "Generation", placing ninth with 44 points.<ref name="fan-lexikon">{{cite web|url=http://www.fan-lexikon.de/film-tv/bundesvision-song-contest/|title=Bundesvision Song Contest|work=fan-lexikon.de|language=German|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>
