When infected, a host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus. When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or '''''virions''''', consisting of (i) the [[genetic material]], i.e., long [[molecule]]s of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, the ''[[capsid]]'', which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]], as they are one-hundredth the size of most bacteria.

The origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]] in a way analogous to [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name="Canchaya" /> Viruses are considered by some [[biologist]]s to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]], although they lack the key characteristics, such as cell structure, that are generally considered necessary criteria for defining [[life]]. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life",<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal| vauthors = Rybicki EP |year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182–86}}</ref> and as [[Self-replication|self-replicators]].<ref name="pmid26965225"/>

Viruses spread in many ways. One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]]  spread [[Airborne transmission|in the air]] by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal–oral route|faecal–oral route]], passed by hand-to-mouth contact or in food or water. The [[infectious dose]] of norovirus required to produce infection in humans is less than 100 particles.<ref name="robilotti15">{{cite journal | vauthors = Robilotti E, Deresinski S, Pinsky BA | title = Norovirus | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 134–64 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25567225 | pmc = 4284304 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.00075-14 }}</ref> [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its "[[Host specificity|host range]]". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 123–124</ref>

Viral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections. Several classes of [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed.

Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by [[Wendell Stanley]], who proved they were particulate.<ref name="Collier3"/> In the same year, [[Friedrich Loeffler]] and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus, [[aphthovirus]] (the agent of [[foot-and-mouth disease]]), through a similar filter.<ref name="isbn0-12-375146-2">{{cite book | vauthors = Fenner F | veditors = Mahy BW, Van Regenmortal MH  |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |edition= 1|publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |page =  15|isbn=978-0-12-375146-1}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, the English bacteriologist [[Frederick Twort]] discovered a group of viruses that infect bacteria, now called [[bacteriophages]]<ref>Shors p. 827</ref> (or commonly 'phages'), and the French-Canadian microbiologist [[Félix d'Herelle]] described viruses that, when added to bacteria on an [[agar plate]], would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Herelle F | title = On an invisible microbe antagonistic toward dysenteric bacilli: brief note by Mr. F.

By the end of the 19th century, viruses were defined in terms of their [[infectivity]], their ability to pass filters, and their requirement for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906 [[Ross Granville Harrison]] invented a method for [[tissue culture|growing tissue]] in [[lymph]], and in 1913 E.&nbsp;Steinhardt, C.&nbsp;Israeli, and R.A. Lambert used this method to grow [[vaccinia]] virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Steinhardt E, Israeli C, Lambert RA |year = 1913|title = Studies on the cultivation of the virus of vaccinia|journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume = 13|pages = 294–300|doi = 10.1093/infdis/13.2.294|issue = 2|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1431761}}</ref> In 1928, H.

Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s when [[poliovirus]] was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.<ref>Collier p. 4</ref>

Another breakthrough came in 1931 when the American pathologist [[Ernest William Goodpasture]] and [[Alice Miles Woodruff]] grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chicken eggs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodpasture EW, Woodruff AM, Buddingh GJ | title = The cultivation of vaccine and other viruses in the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos | journal = Science | volume = 74 | issue = 1919 | pages = 371–72 | date = October 1931 | pmid = 17810781 | doi = 10.1126/science.74.1919.371 | bibcode = 1931Sci....74..371G }}</ref> In 1949, [[John Franklin Enders]], [[Thomas Huckle Weller|Thomas Weller]], and [[Frederick Robbins]] grew poliovirus in cultured cells from aborted human embryonic tissue,<ref name="WellerLibrary2004">{{cite book|author=Thomas Huckle Weller|title=Growing Pathogens in Tissue Cultures: Fifty Years in Academic Tropical Medicine, Pediatrics, and Virology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYbqLuOVJlEC&pg=PA57|year=2004|publisher=Boston Medical Library|isbn=978-0-88135-380-8|page=57}}</ref> the first virus to be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs.

The tobacco mosaic virus was the first to be [[crystal]]lised and its structure could, therefore, be elucidated in detail.

This provides an invaluable source of information for [[Paleovirology|paleovirologists]] to trace back ancient viruses that have existed up to millions of years ago. There are three main hypotheses that aim to explain the origins of viruses:<ref>Shors pp. 14–16</ref><ref>Collier pp. 11–21</ref>

; Regressive hypothesis : Viruses may have once been small cells that [[parasitism|parasitised]] larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria [[rickettsia]] and [[Chlamydia (genus)|chlamydia]] are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend support to this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the 'degeneracy hypothesis',<ref name="Dimmock16">Dimmock p. 16</ref><ref>Collier p. 11</ref> or 'reduction hypothesis'.<ref name="Mahy Gen 24" />
; Cellular origin hypothesis : Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that "escaped" from the genes of a larger organism. The escaped DNA could have come from [[plasmid]]s (pieces of naked DNA that can move between cells) or [[transposons]] (molecules of DNA that replicate and move around to different positions within the genes of the cell).<ref>Shors p. 810</ref> Once called "jumping genes", transposons are examples of [[mobile genetic elements]] and could be the origin of some viruses.

Viruses display a wide diversity of sizes and shapes, called '[[morphology (biology)|morphologies]]'. In general, viruses are much smaller than bacteria and more than a thousand bacteriophage viruses would fit inside an ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' bacterium's cell.<ref>Krasner p. 98</ref> Many viruses that have been studied are spherical and have a diameter between 20 and 300 [[nanometres]].

A complete virus particle, known as a ''virion'', consists of nucleic acid surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a [[capsid]].

; Helical: These viruses are composed of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a [[Helix|helical]] structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in virions which can be short and highly rigid rods, or long and very flexible filaments. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but single-stranded DNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus<ref>Collier p. 37</ref> and inovirus <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Straus SK, Bo HE | title = Filamentous Bacteriophage Proteins and Assembly | journal = Sub-Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 88 | pages = 261–279 | date = 2018 | pmid = 29900501 | doi = 10.1007/978-981-10-8456-0_12 | isbn = 978-981-10-8455-3 }}</ref> are examples of helical viruses.

; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical subunits. The minimum number of capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers or they may be composed of different proteins.<ref name="pmid27045511">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson DP | title = Protruding Features of Viral Capsids Are Clustered on Icosahedral Great Circles | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = e0152319 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27045511 | pmc = 4821576 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0152319 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1152319W | doi-access = free }}</ref>

; Prolate: This is an icosahedron elongated along the fivefold axis and is a common arrangement of the heads of bacteriophages.

; Enveloped:Some species of virus [[Viral envelope|envelop]] themselves in a modified form of one of the [[cell membranes]], either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as a nuclear membrane or [[endoplasmic reticulum]], thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a [[viral envelope]]. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host.

; Complex: These viruses possess a capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, and that may possess extra structures such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as [[Enterobacteria phage T4]], have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a [[hexagon]]al base plate with protruding protein tail fibres.

The [[Poxviridae|poxviruses]] are large, complex viruses that have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is associated with proteins within a central disc structure known as a [[nucleoid]].

A virus has either a [[DNA]] or an [[RNA]] genome and is called a [[DNA virus]] or an [[RNA virus]], respectively. The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.<ref name="Collier9699">Collier pp. 96–99</ref>

Viral genomes are circular, as in the [[polyomavirus]]es, or linear, as in the [[Adenoviridae|adenoviruses]]. The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name="Collier3355" />

A viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds). Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name="Collier9699" />

For most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the 'plus-strand') or [[negative-sense]] (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-sense viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand.<ref name="Collier9699" /> Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are [[ambisense]] in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include [[Geminiviridae|geminiviruses]], which are ssDNA plant viruses and [[arenavirus]]es, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.<ref name="isbn0-470-02387-2">{{cite book | vauthors = Saunders VA, Carter J |title=Virology: principles and applications |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Chichester |year=2007 |page= 72 |isbn=978-0-470-02387-7}}</ref>

==== Genome size ====
Genome size varies greatly between species.

In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses because of a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit.<ref name="pmid20660197" /> Beyond this, errors when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To compensate, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes—the genome is split into smaller molecules—thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes because of the high fidelity of their replication enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pressing J, Reanney DC | title = Divided genomes and intrinsic noise | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–46 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6433032 | doi = 10.1007/BF02257374 | pmc = 7087551 | bibcode = 1984JMolE..20..135P }}</ref> Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case.<ref name="pmid19264617">{{cite journal | vauthors = Duffy S, Holmes EC | title = Validation of high rates of nucleotide substitution in geminiviruses: phylogenetic evidence from East African cassava mosaic viruses | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 90 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1539–47 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19264617 | pmc = 4091138 | doi = 10.1099/vir.0.009266-0 }}</ref>

=== Genetic mutation ===
[[File:Influenza geneticshift.svg|thumb|alt=A cartoon showing how viral genes can be shuffled to form new viruses|Antigenic shift, or reassortment, can result in novel and highly pathogenic strains of [[human flu]]]]
Viruses undergo genetic change by several mechanisms. These include a process called [[antigenic drift]] where individual bases in the DNA or RNA [[mutate]] to other bases. Most of these [[point mutations]] are "silent"—they do not change the protein that the gene encodes—but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to [[antiviral drugs]].<ref name="pmid22143798">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandbulte MR, Westgeest KB, Gao J, Xu X, Klimov AI, Russell CA, Burke DF, Smith DJ, Fouchier RA, Eichelberger MC | display-authors = 6 | title = Discordant antigenic drift of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin in H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 51 | pages = 20748–53 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22143798 | pmc = 3251064 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1113801108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10820748S | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="pmid20375034">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moss RB, Davey RT, Steigbigel RT, Fang F | title = Targeting pandemic influenza: a primer on influenza antivirals and drug resistance | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 1086–93 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20375034 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkq100 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Antigenic shift]] occurs when there is a major change in the genome of the virus.

Segmented genomes confer evolutionary advantages; different strains of a virus with a segmented genome can shuffle and combine genes and produce progeny viruses (or offspring) that have unique characteristics. This is called reassortment or 'viral sex'.<ref>Goudsmit, Jaap. Viral Sex. Oxford Univ Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-19-512496-5|0-19-512496-0}}</ref>

[[Genetic recombination]] is the process by which a strand of DNA (or RNA) is broken and then joined to the end of a different DNA (or RNA)  molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of [[viral evolution]] have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied.<ref name="pmid10573145">{{cite journal | vauthors = Worobey M, Holmes EC | title = Evolutionary aspects of recombination in RNA viruses | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 80 | issue = 10 | pages = 2535–43 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10573145 | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-80-10-2535 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.<ref name="pmid15578739">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lukashev AN | title = Role of recombination in evolution of enteroviruses | journal = Reviews in Medical Virology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 157–67 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15578739 | doi = 10.1002/rmv.457 | s2cid = 26000112 }}</ref><ref name="pmid10479778">{{cite journal | vauthors = Umene K | title = Mechanism and application of genetic recombination in herpesviruses | journal = Reviews in Medical Virology | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 171–82 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10479778 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1654(199907/09)9:3<171::AID-RMV243>3.0.CO;2-A }}</ref>

=== Replication cycle ===
[[File:HepC replication.png|thumb|A typical virus replication cycle]]
[[File:Phage injecting its genome into bacteria.svg|thumb|Some bacteriophages inject their [[genome]]s into bacterial cells (not to scale)]]
Viral populations do not grow through cell division, because they are acellular. Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves, and they assemble in the cell.<ref name="pmid26119571">{{cite journal | vauthors = Freed EO | title = HIV-1 assembly, release and maturation | journal = Nature Reviews.

Their life cycle differs greatly between species, but there are six basic stages in their life cycle:<ref>Collier pp. 75–91</ref>

''Attachment'' is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range and type of host cell of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human [[leucocytes]]. This is because its surface protein, [[gp120]], specifically interacts with the [[CD4]] molecule—a [[chemokine receptor]]—which is most commonly found on the surface of [[CD4+]] [[T-Cells]]. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that result in the [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fusion]] of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.<ref name="pmid23737062">{{cite book | vauthors = Más V, Melero JA | chapter = Entry of enveloped viruses into host cells: membrane fusion | title = Structure and Physics of Viruses | volume = 68 | pages = 467–87 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23737062 | doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16 | isbn = 978-94-007-6551-1 | series = Subcellular Biochemistry | pmc = 7121288 }}</ref>

''Penetration'' or ''[[viral entry]]'' follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]] or [[Lipid bilayer fusion|membrane fusion]]. The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of [[cellulose]], and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall.<ref>Dimmock p. 70</ref> Nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called [[plasmodesma]]ta.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boevink P, Oparka KJ | title = Virus-host interactions during movement processes | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 138 | issue = 4 | pages = 1815–21 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16172094 | pmc = 1183373 | doi = 10.1104/pp.105.066761 }}</ref> Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. Given that bacterial cell walls are much thinner than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.<ref>Dimmock p. 71</ref>

''Uncoating'' is a process in which the viral capsid is removed: This may be by degradation by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the viral genomic nucleic acid.<ref name="pmid27174165">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blaas D | title = Viral entry pathways: the example of common cold viruses | journal = Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift | volume = 166 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 211–26 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27174165 | pmc = 4871925 | doi = 10.1007/s10354-016-0461-2 }}</ref>

''[[Viral replication|Replication]]'' of viruses involves primarily multiplication of the genome. Replication involves the synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) from "early" genes (with exceptions for positive-sense RNA viruses), viral [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], possible assembly of viral proteins, then viral genome replication mediated by early or regulatory protein expression. This may be followed, for complex viruses with larger genomes, by one or more further rounds of mRNA synthesis: "late" gene expression is, in general, of structural or virion proteins.<ref name="pmid23231449">{{cite journal | vauthors = Isomura H, Stinski MF | s2cid = 11448687 | title = Coordination of late gene transcription of human cytomegalovirus with viral DNA synthesis: recombinant viruses as potential therapeutic vaccine candidates | journal = Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–66 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23231449 | doi = 10.1517/14728222.2013.740460 }}</ref>

''Assembly'' – Following the structure-mediated self-assembly of the virus particles, some modification of the proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell.<ref name="pmid11451488">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barman S, Ali A, Hui EK, Adhikary L, Nayak DP | title = Transport of viral proteins to the apical membranes and interaction of matrix protein with glycoproteins in the assembly of influenza viruses | journal = Virus Research | volume = 77 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–69 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11451488 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-1702(01)00266-0 }}</ref>

''Release'' – Viruses can be [[viral shedding|released]] from the host cell by [[lysis]], a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present: this is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses. Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a "[[provirus]]" or, in the case of bacteriophages a "[[prophage]]".<ref>Shors pp. 836</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to the active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latency'', pp. 243–59</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]]. During this process, the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane.<ref>Dimmock 185–87</ref>

=== Genome replication ===
The genetic material within virus particles, and the method by which the material is replicated, varies considerably between different types of viruses.

; DNA viruses: The genome replication of most [[DNA virus]]es takes place in the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell either by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or—more usually—by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes, the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 118; Collier p. 78</ref>

; RNA viruses: Replication of [[RNA virus]]es usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>

; Reverse transcribing viruses: [[Reverse transcribing viruses]] have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes ([[retrovirus]]es) use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes ([[dsDNA-RT virus|pararetrovirus]]es) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name="pmid16949329">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-Pöggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485–91 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]]. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', which includes Hepatitis B virus.<ref>Collier pp. 88–89</ref>

=== Cytopathic effects on the host cell ===
The range of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on the host cell is extensive.<ref>Collier pp. 115–46</ref> These are called '[[cytopathic effect]]s'.<ref>Collier p. 115</ref> Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell.

=== Dormant and latent infections ===

{{Main|Virus classification}}
Classification seeks to describe the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them on the basis of similarities. In 1962, [[André Lwoff]], [[Robert Horne (virologist)|Robert Horne]], and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] hierarchical system.<ref name="pmid14467544">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lwoff A, Horne RW, Tournier P | title = [A virus system] | language = fr | journal = Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences | volume = 254 | pages = 4225–27 | date = June 1962 | pmid = 14467544 }}</ref> This system based classification on [[phylum]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], and [[species]].

The Baltimore classification of viruses is based on the mechanism of [[mRNA]] production. Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family. Viral genomes may be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), RNA or DNA, and may or may not use [[reverse transcriptase]] (RT). In addition, ssRNA viruses may be either [[sense (molecular biology)|sense]] (+) or antisense (−). This classification places viruses into seven groups:

Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the [[common cold]], [[influenza]], [[chickenpox]], and [[cold sores]]. Many serious diseases such as [[rabies]], [[Ebola virus disease]], [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS (HIV)]], [[avian influenza]], and [[SARS]] are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of [[virulence]]. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between [[human herpesvirus 6]] (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].<ref name="PMID_17276367">{{cite journal | vauthors = Komaroff AL | title = Is human herpesvirus-6 a trigger for chronic fatigue syndrome? | journal = Journal of Clinical Virology | volume = 37 |issue= Suppl 1 | pages = S39–46 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17276367 | doi = 10.1016/S1386-6532(06)70010-5 }}</ref> There is controversy over whether the [[bornavirus]], previously thought to cause [[neurology|neurological]] diseases in horses, could be responsible for [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] illnesses in humans.<ref name="Chen_1999">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen CH, Chiu YL, Wei FC, Koong FJ, Liu HC, Shaw CK, Hwu HG, Hsiao KJ | s2cid = 19830976 | display-authors = 6 | title = High seroprevalence of Borna virus infection in schizophrenic patients, family members and mental health workers in Taiwan | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–38 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 10089006 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4000484 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Viruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In [[multicellular organism]]s, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy [[homeostasis]], resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include the ability of the [[herpes simplex virus]], which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency<ref name="pmid17686862">{{cite journal | vauthors = Margolis TP, Elfman FL, Leib D, Pakpour N, Apakupakul K, Imai Y, Voytek C | title = Spontaneous reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 in latently infected murine sensory ganglia | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 81 | issue = 20 | pages = 11069–74 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17686862 | pmc = 2045564 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00243-07 }}</ref> and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and [[varicella zoster virus]], which causes chickenpox and [[shingles]].

=== Epidemiology ===
Viral [[epidemiology]] is the branch of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of [[vertical transmission]] include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus.<ref name="pmid17825648">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fowler MG, Lampe MA, Jamieson DJ, Kourtis AP, Rogers MF | title = Reducing the risk of mother-to-child human immunodeficiency virus transmission: past successes, current progress and challenges, and future directions | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 197 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = S3–9 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17825648 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2007.06.048 }}</ref> Another, more rare, example is the [[varicella zoster virus]], which, although causing relatively mild infections in children and adults, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.<ref name="pmid11190597">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sauerbrei A, Wutzler P | s2cid = 7973561 | title = The congenital varicella syndrome | journal = Journal of Perinatology | volume = 20 | issue = 8 Pt 1 | pages = 548–54 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11190597 | doi = 10.1038/sj.jp.7200457 }}</ref>

It can also occur when [[aerosol]]s containing viruses are inhaled or by insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] such as when infected mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host.<ref name="pmid28289251"/> Most types of viruses are restricted to just one or two of these mechanisms and they are referred to as "respiratory viruses" or "enteric viruses" and so forth. The rate or speed of transmission of viral infections depends on factors that include population density, the number of susceptible individuals, (i.e., those not immune),<ref name="pmid15627236">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garnett GP | title = Role of herd immunity in determining the effect of vaccines against sexually transmitted disease | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 191 |issue= Suppl 1 | pages = S97–106 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15627236 | doi = 10.1086/425271 | doi-access = free }}</ref> the quality of healthcare and the weather.<ref name="pmid16544901">{{cite journal | vauthors = Platonov AE | title = [The influence of weather conditions on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases by the example of West Nile fever in Russia] | language = ru | journal = Vestnik Rossiiskoi Akademii Meditsinskikh Nauk | issue = 2 | pages = 25–29 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16544901 }}</ref>

Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks of [[viral disease]]s.<ref>Shors p. 264</ref> Control measures are used that are based on knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated from the rest of the community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in [[quarantine]].<ref>Shors pp. 894</ref> To control the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|outbreak]] of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered.<ref name="pmid19091686">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jewell CP, Keeling MJ, Roberts GO |title=Predicting undetected infections during the 2007 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak |journal=Journal of the Royal Society, Interface |volume=6 |issue=41 |pages=1145–51 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19091686 |pmc=2817150 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2008.0433 }}</ref> Most viral infections of humans and other animals have [[incubation period]]s during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms.<ref>Shors p. 170</ref> Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections.<ref name="Shorspp">Shors pp. 170–72</ref> Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability—a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal.<ref name="Shorspp" /> This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks.<ref>Shors p. 272</ref> When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics.

=== Cancer ===
{{Details|Oncovirus}}
Viruses are an established cause of cancer in humans and other species. Viral cancers occur only in a minority of infected persons (or animals). Cancer viruses come from a range of virus families, including both RNA and DNA viruses, and so there is no single type of "[[oncovirus]]" (an obsolete term originally used for acutely transforming retroviruses). The development of cancer is determined by a variety of factors such as host immunity<ref name="pmid19467474">{{cite journal | vauthors = Einstein MH, Schiller JT, Viscidi RP, Strickler HD, Coursaget P, Tan T, Halsey N, Jenkins D | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinician's guide to human papillomavirus immunology: knowns and unknowns | journal = The Lancet.

=== Host defence mechanisms ===
{{See also|Immune system}}

The body's first line of defence against viruses is the [[innate immune system]]. This comprises cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that the cells of the innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the [[adaptive immune system]], it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.<ref name="Alberts">{{cite book | vauthors = Alberta B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walters P |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition = Fourth |publisher=Garland Science |year=2002 |location=New York and London |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=mboc4.TOC&depth=2 |isbn=0-8153-3218-1 }}</ref>

[[RNA interference]] is an important innate defence against viruses.<ref name="pmid17693253">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ding SW, Voinnet O | title = Antiviral immunity directed by small RNAs | journal = Cell | volume = 130 | issue = 3 | pages = 413–26 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17693253 | pmc = 2703654 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.039 }}</ref> Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a [[dicer]] that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway—the [[RNA-induced silencing complex|RISC complex]]—is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside the core of the virion.<ref name="pmid15579070">{{cite journal | vauthors = Patton JT, Vasquez-Del Carpio R, Spencer E | title = Replication and transcription of the rotavirus genome | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 10 | issue = 30 | pages = 3769–77 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15579070 | doi = 10.2174/1381612043382620 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15010218">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jayaram H, Estes MK, Prasad BV | title = Emerging themes in rotavirus cell entry, genome organization, transcription and replication | journal = Virus Research | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–81 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15010218 | doi = 10.1016/j.virusres.2003.12.007 }}</ref>

When the [[adaptive immune system]] of a [[vertebrate]] encounters a virus, it produces specific [[antibodies]] that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called [[humoral immunity]]. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM]], is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by the cells of the immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]], is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past.<ref name="pmid8903801">{{cite journal | vauthors = Greer S, Alexander GJ | title = Viral serology and detection | journal = Bailliere's Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 689–721 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8903801 | doi = 10.1016/0950-3528(95)90057-8 }}</ref> IgG antibody is measured when tests for [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] are carried out.<ref name="pmid9086126">{{cite journal | vauthors = Matter L, Kogelschatz K, Germann D | title = Serum levels of rubella virus antibodies indicating immunity: response to vaccination of subjects with low or undetectable antibody concentrations | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 175 | issue = 4 | pages = 749–55 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9086126 | doi = 10.1086/513967 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Antibodies can continue to be an effective defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called [[TRIM21]], can attach to the antibodies on the surface of the virus particle. This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell's [[proteosome]] system.<ref name="pmid21045130">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mallery DL, McEwan WA, Bidgood SR, Towers GJ, Johnson CM, James LC | title = Antibodies mediate intracellular immunity through tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21) | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 46 | pages = 19985–90 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21045130 | pmc = 2993423 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1014074107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10719985M | doi-access = free }}</ref>

A second defence of vertebrates against viruses is called [[cell-mediated immunity]] and involves immune cells known as [[T cells]]. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by 'killer T' cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells such as the [[macrophage]] are specialists at this [[antigen presentation]].<ref name="pmid17725500">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cascalho M, Platt JL | title = Novel functions of B cells | journal = Critical Reviews in Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–51 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17725500 | doi = 10.1615/critrevimmunol.v27.i2.20 }}</ref> The production of [[interferon]] is an important host defence mechanism.

Not all virus infections produce a protective immune response in this way. HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins on the surface of the virion. This is known as "escape mutation" as the viral epitopes escape recognition by the host immune response. These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of [[antigen presentation]], [[cytokine]] resistance, evasion of [[natural killer cell]] activities, escape from [[apoptosis]], and [[antigenic shift]].<ref name="pmid15297608">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hilleman MR | title = Strategies and mechanisms for host and pathogen survival in acute and persistent viral infections | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 |issue= Suppl 2 | pages = 14560–66 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15297608 | pmc = 521982 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0404758101 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..10114560H | doi-access = free }}</ref> Other viruses, called '[[neurotropic virus]]es', are disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach them due to [[immune privilege]].<ref name="pmid25015488">{{cite journal |vauthors=Libbey JE, Fujinami RS |title=Adaptive immune response to viral infections in the central nervous system |journal=Handbook of Clinical Neurology |volume=123 |issue= |pages=225–47 |date=2014 |pmid=25015488 |pmc=4370180 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53488-0.00010-9|isbn=9780444534880 }}</ref>

=== Prevention and treatment ===
Because viruses use vital metabolic pathways within host cells to replicate, they are difficult to eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are [[vaccination]]s to provide immunity to infection, and [[antiviral drugs]] that selectively interfere with viral replication.

==== Vaccines ====

Vaccination is a cheap and effective way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses.

There are many types of plant viruses, but often they cause only a loss of [[crop yield|yield]], and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms, known as [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]. These are usually insects, but some fungi, [[Nematode|nematode worms]], and [[protozoa|single-celled organisms]] are vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, for perennial fruits, for example, efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.<ref>Shors p. 802</ref> Plant viruses cannot infect humans and other animals because they can reproduce only in living plant cells.<ref>Shors pp. 799–807</ref>

Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes.

Plant virus particles or virus-like particles (VLPs) have applications in both [[biotechnology]] and [[nanotechnology]]. The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures and can be produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by expression in a variety of heterologous systems. Plant virus particles can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate foreign material and can be incorporated into supramolecular structures for use in biotechnology.<ref name= LomonossoffGP>{{cite book| vauthors = Lomonossoff GP |chapter = Virus Particles and the Uses of Such Particles in Bio- and Nanotechnology|year=2011|title=Recent Advances in Plant Virology|publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]]|isbn= 978-1-904455-75-2}}</ref>

This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies.<ref name=Coleman>{{cite journal | vauthors = Coleman JR, Papamichail D, Skiena S, Futcher B, Wimmer E, Mueller S | title = Virus attenuation by genome-scale changes in codon pair bias | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5884 | pages = 1784–87 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18583614 | pmc = 2754401 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155761 | bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1784C }}</ref> The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and [[permissive]] cells are available. As of June 2021, the full-length genome sequences of 11,464 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=10239 |title=NIH viral genome database |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |access-date=28 June 2021}}</ref>

{{Details|Biological warfare}}

The ability of viruses to cause devastating epidemics in human societies has led to the concern that viruses could be weaponised for [[biological warfare]]. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous [[Spanish flu|1918 influenza]] virus in a laboratory.<ref name="pmid30152475">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zilinskas RA |title=A brief history of biological weapons programmes and the use of animal pathogens as biological warfare agents |journal=Revue Scientifique et Technique (International Office of Epizootics) |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=415–422 |date=August 2017 |pmid=30152475 |doi=10.20506/rst.36.2.2662 }}</ref>
The smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in the world authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] in Russia and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in the United States.<ref name="pmid18844596">{{cite journal | vauthors = Artenstein AW, Grabenstein JD | s2cid = 33855724 | title = Smallpox vaccines for biodefense: need and feasibility | journal = Expert Review of Vaccines | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 1225–37 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18844596 | doi = 10.1586/14760584.7.8.1225 }}</ref> It may be used as a weapon,<ref name="pmid18844596" /> as the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox and would be vulnerable to the virus.<ref name="pmid18844596" />
