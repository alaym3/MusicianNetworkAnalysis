'''Sleeping at Last''' is a musical project led by singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist '''Ryan O'Neal'''.  The project initially began in Wheaton, Illinois as a three-piece band with Ryan O'Neal as the lead singer and guitarist, his brother Chad O'Neal as the drummer, and Dan Perdue as the bassist. The band independently recorded their debut album, ''Capture'' in 2000, which they used to attract the attention of [[Smashing Pumpkins]] [[frontman]] [[Billy Corgan]], who helped them get signed to a major record label, [[Interscope Records]]. The band released their only major label album, ''[[Ghosts (Sleeping at Last album)|Ghosts]]'' in 2003, before going independent again and releasing ''[[Keep No Score]]'' in 2006, and ''[[Storyboard (Sleeping at Last album)|Storyboards]]'' in 2009.

In the years following the release of their first four albums, both Chad O'Neal and Perdue would leave the band to pursue other interests. Ryan O'Neal chose to retain the use of the band's name for his solo work from that point on, but opted to focus on single songs and short EPs rather than any further traditional albums.

=== ''Atlas'' project (2013–present) ===
O'Neal teased his latest project on his blog in late 2012, showing an image with the date "12.12.12" on it.<ref name="atlas">{{Cite web|url = http://sleepingatlast.com/countdown-begins/|title = Countdown Begins...|date = November 21, 2012|accessdate = July 22, 2014|website = Sleeping at Last|publisher = |last = O'Neal|first = Ryan}}</ref> Two days before December 12 that year, O'Neal revealed the details of ''Atlas'', what he described as "an ongoing series of [EP]s".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://sleepingatlast.com/atlas-in-detail/|title = Atlas: In Detail|date = December 10, 2012|accessdate = July 22, 2014|website = Sleeping at Last|publisher = |last = O'Neal|first = Ryan}}</ref> In the blog post, O'Neal said that the artwork would "play a very special role in [the] project" and that he had turned to Geoff Benzing to "paint one painting for each of the 28+ songs".<ref name="atlas"/>

In December 2013, the song "In the Embers" from the album ''Atlas: Light'' was used by [[Turner Classic Movies]] as the soundtrack for the 2013 version of "TCM Remembers," the network's annual tribute to actors, producers, and other filmmakers who died during the year. The lyrics of the song discuss leaving a legacy after death and compares the span of human lives to fireworks, stating that "till our temporary brilliance turns to ash, we pull apart the darkness while we can."

On January 30, 2014 the song "Sun" from the EP ''Atlas: Space 1'' was used in the trailer for the book-based movie ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://sleepingatlast.com/the-fault-in-our-stars/|title = The Fault in Our Stars – Trailer|date = January 30, 2014|accessdate = July 22, 2014|website = Sleeping at Last|publisher = |last = O'Neal|first = Ryan}}</ref>

On July 8, 2014, Sleeping at Last released ''Atlas: Year One'', a compilation of the previous year's six extended plays.

In 2014 the song "Light" from the album ''Atlas 1'' was used on the OST of ''The Little Death''.

On February 18, 2015, O'Neal announced, via his Facebook page, that ''Atlas: Year Two'' would be coming out in the spring of 2015. On April 2, O'Neal recorded two covers, "Today Has Been Okay" and "[[Chasing Cars]]", that were both used in the eleventh season of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. On May 18, the subscribers of ''Atlas: Year Two'' were able to listen to the first two songs, "Overture II" and "Life". It was released on iTunes on May 26. On June 13, O'Neal recorded an OST for the new upcoming movie ''Many Beautiful Things'' that was available on Spotify. On August 13, the group's song, "Countdowns" was the feature song at the end of the next to last episode of ''[[The Astronaut Wives Club]] – The Dark Side''.  It played as the wives held their breath for [[Apollo 8]] going around the back side of the moon and as the wives go their separate ways in life. On September 18, the first EP of ''Atlas: Year Two'', ''Atlas: Life'', was released on iTunes and Spotify.
