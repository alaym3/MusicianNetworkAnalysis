In 1974, the Matthews family moved to Cambridge, England, for a year, then returned to New York, where his father died from lung cancer in 1977. At some point, while residing in New York, Matthews attended his first concert, when his mother took him to a performance by [[Pete Seeger]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gardner |first=Elysa |url=http://content.usatoday.net/dist/custom/gci/InsidePage.aspx?cId=jconline&sParam=34946928.story |title=Jconline – Postcard from the road: Pete Seeger's all-star hootenanny |publisher=Content.usatoday.net |access-date=2012-04-15}}</ref> The family returned to Johannesburg in 1977.<ref name=nyt/>

Upon Matthews's graduation from Damelin College high school in 1985, he was faced with [[conscription]] into the South African military just as [[End Conscription Campaign|civil disobedience]] to the practice was becoming widespread.<ref>At Ease, ECC newsletter, May 1986, cited in {{cite book |first=Jacklyn |last=Cock |title=Colonels and Cadres: War and Gender in South Africa |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1991 |page=81 |isbn=0-19-570706-0 |oclc=925251407 }}</ref> As a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] (and consequently pacifist), Matthews left South Africa to avoid service.<ref name=CNN>Whitefield, Fredricka (2005).

== Formation of Dave Matthews Band ==
After writing his first few songs, including "I'll Back You Up", "The Song That Jane Likes" and "Recently", Matthews formed [[Dave Matthews Band]] in early 1991 with [[LeRoi Moore]], [[Carter Beauford]], [[Stefan Lessard]], [[Peter Griesar]] (who left the band in 1993), and [[Boyd Tinsley]] while working at Miller's. The band's first show was on March 14, 1991, as part of a benefit for the [[Middle East Children's Alliance]] at [[Trax Nightclub]] in Charlottesville, Virginia.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dmbalmanac.com/TourShowSet.aspx?id=453056860&tid=65&where=1991 | title=03.14.1991 Trax Nightclub Charlottesville, Virginia (Middle East Children's Alliance benefit) | publisher=DMBAlmanac.com | access-date=November 4, 2010}}</ref>

Matthews's older sister Anne, who lived in South Africa, was murdered by her husband in early 1994. Her husband then died by suicide on or around January 27 of that year.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16Htyr5v1N0C&pg=PA20 |title=Dave Matthews Band: Music for the People, Revised and Updated – Nevin Martell – Google Boeken |access-date=2012-12-17|isbn=9780743493826 |last1=Martell |first1=Nevin |date=June 15, 2004 }}</ref> The event had a profound effect on Matthews's outlook on life and was referenced in a few of his songs. On January 29, 1994, he performed with [[Tim Reynolds]] at [[the Wetlands]] in New York, where he dedicated that performance "to her [Anne's] memory". Dave Matthews Band's ''[[Under the Table and Dreaming]]'', released later that year, was dedicated to her.<ref name="books.google.com"/> Anne Matthews was survived by her two children, and they traveled to the United States following her death. Dave and his younger sister Jane (after whom the Dave Matthews Band song "The Song That Jane Likes" is named) took responsibility for the children's upbringing.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

==Other activities==
In 1999, Matthews purchased more than 10 acres of land in Albemarle County, Virginia, known as Blenheim Farm, to preserve its historical significance. He later decided to plant grapes on the property, since it is located within both the Virginia and [[Monticello]] [[viticultural]] areas. Blenheim Vineyards was founded in 2000, and currently produces 5,500 cases of wine per year, including its signature [[Petit Verdot]] and several special edition wines that have featured unique labels with drawings by Matthews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blenheimvineyards.com/ |title=Blenheim Vineyards |publisher=Blenheim Vineyards |access-date=2013-12-04}}</ref>

==Politics==
Matthews published an Internet video before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 U.S. presidential election]], urging viewers to vote without advocating any candidate. He mentioned only Ralph Nader by name, and updated fans about the recording sessions for ''[[Everyday (Dave Matthews Band album)|Everyday]]''. Although his music often explores political and social issues, Matthews refrained from public campaigning for presidential candidates until 2004. He cast his support strongly with Democratic nominee [[John Kerry]], performing at political events including the [[Vote for Change]] tour.

Matthews also supported [[Barack Obama]] for president in 2008, both in the primaries and in the general election.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/20093048/dave_matthews_speaks_out_for_barack_obama?source=music_news_rssfeed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408192456/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/20093048/dave_matthews_speaks_out_for_barack_obama?source=music_news_rssfeed |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 8, 2008 |title=Dave Matthews Speaks Out for Barack Obama |access-date=September 7, 2008 |author=Bates, Eric |date=April 17, 2008 |publisher=RollingStone }}</ref> On April 6, 2008, he and Tim Reynolds played a concert titled "Change Rocks"<ref name="Change Rocks">{{cite web|url=http://www.davematthewsband.com/news/view/7609326981d081ac5a758b04ad0b30fd|title=Change Rocks: Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds to Perform Special Show in Support of Barack Obama|last=Matthews|first=Dave|author2=Reynolds, Tim|date=April 2, 2008|work=Presented by Indiana University Union Board|publisher=Official Dave Matthews Website|access-date=February 4, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006104813/http://davematthewsband.com/news/view/7609326981d081ac5a758b04ad0b30fd|archive-date=October 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> at Indiana University to encourage students to register to vote.
