The '''faun''' ({{Lang-lat|[[faunus]]}}, {{lang-grc|φαῦνος}}, ''phaunos'', {{IPA-el|pʰaunos|pron}}) is a half-[[Human]] half-[[goat]] mythological creature appearing in [[Roman mythology]] and [[Greek mythology]].

The faun, more commonly affiliated with the [[Satyr]]s of Greek mythology than the fauns of Roman, are bipedal creatures with the legs and tail of a goat and the head, torso, and arms of a human, and are often depicted with a goat’s horns and pointed ears. These mythological creatures borrowed their appearance from the satyrs, who in turn borrowed their appearance from the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] of the Greek pantheon. They were symbols of peace and fertility, and their chieftain, [[Silenus]], was a minor deity of [[Greek mythology]].<ref>''Canadian Oxford Dictionary'', second ed., Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 541.</ref>

Romans believed fauns inspired fear in men traveling in lonely, remote or wild places. They were also capable of guiding humans in need, as in the fable of [[The Satyr and the Traveller]], in the title of which Latin authors substituted the word ''Faunus''. Fauns and [[satyr]]s were originally quite different creatures: whereas fauns are half-man and half-goat, satyrs originally were depicted as stocky, hairy, ugly dwarves or [[woodwose]]s with the ears and tails of horses or asses. Satyrs also were more woman-loving than fauns, and fauns were rather foolish where satyrs had more knowledge.

[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] mythological belief also included a god named [[Faunus]] often associated with enchanted woods and the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Phaunos.html |title=Theoi Greek Mythology - Phaunos |publisher=Theoi.com |access-date=2014-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/faun|title=faun {{!}} mythical character|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en}}</ref> and a goddess named [[Fauna (goddess)|Fauna]] who were [[goat people]].

The ''[[Barberini Faun]]'' (located in the [[Glyptothek]] in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]) is a Hellenistic marble statue from about 200 BC, found in the Mausoleum of the Emperor [[Hadrian]] (the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]) and installed at {{lang|it|[[Palazzo Barberini]]}} by Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (later [[Pope Urban VIII]]). [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] restored and refinished the statue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/introtogreece/lect34/hBarberiniFaun.jpg |title=View online |access-date=2014-06-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020221632/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/introtogreece/lect34/hBarberiniFaun.jpg |archive-date=2012-10-20 }}</ref>

The [[House of the Faun]] in Pompei, dating from the 2nd century BC, was so named because of the dancing faun statue that was the centerpiece of the large garden.
