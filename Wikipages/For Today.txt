==History==
For Today was founded in 2005 by Ryan Leitru, Mike Reynolds, David Morrison, and Jon Lauters. Lauters and vocalist Matt Tyler, who joined the band shortly after its formation, (who later became known as Madison Skylights) left the band soon after, and were replaced by [[Mattie Montgomery]] (formerly of [[Besieged (band)|Besieged]]) and Brennan Schaeuble. Schaeuble was replaced by Ryan's brother Brandon. On April 1, 2008, they released their first studio album, produced by [[Facedown Records]], ''Ekklesia'' (a Biblical term from the [[Koine Greek]] that typically denotes the collective people of God; it is usually translated as 'the Body of Christ' or 'the Church').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/1577.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 1577. ἐκκλησία (ekklésia) -- an assembly, a (religious) congregation|access-date=January 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/topical/topical_searchresults/?search=ekklesia|title=BibleGateway.com - Topical Index: ekklesia|access-date=January 2, 2017}}</ref> Their second album, ''Portraits'', was released on June 9, 2009, on the same label, and peaked at No. 15 of the ''Billboard'' Christian albums chart. Different Biblical personalities are portrayed on the album: the Prophets Ezekiel, Joel, Elijah and Isaiah, and Nicodemus the Pharisee, Zacharias, Saul (Paul) of Tarsus and Immanuel (Jesus). The final track on the album, 'Talmidim' (which denotes the disciples of a rabbi, here referring to all disciples of Jesus -Christians) quotes Ezekiel 36:26-28 and describes what it means to be a Christian.

Upon signing with [[Razor & Tie]], the band was in the recording studio on January 6, 2012 until February 8, 2012 at The Machine Shop in New Jersey. They also announced that Will Putney, who produced their previous release Breaker, would produce this album. The album's first single, "Fearless", was released on March 6, 2012. They headlined the Fight the Silence Tour based on their new album in March 2012 and toured alongside [[A Skylit Drive]], [[Stick to Your Guns (band)|Stick to Your Guns]], [[MyChildren MyBride]], and [[Make Me Famous]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/2011/12/for-today-announce-headlining-tour-2/|title=For Today announce headlining tour|publisher=[[HM Magazine]]|first=Doug Van|last=Pelt|date=2011|access-date=January 21, 2017|archive-date=April 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418100602/http://www.hmmagazine.com/2011/12/for-today-announce-headlining-tour-2/}}</ref> The new album, ''Immortal'', was released on May 29, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://highwiredaze.com/fortodaynews7|title=FOR TODAY'S NEW STUDIO ALBUM "IMMORTAL" RELEASE DATE NOW SET FOR MAY 29TH|publisher=Highwire Daze|author=Ken|date=April 18, 2012|access-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref> They played at [[Warped Tour 2012]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vanswarpedtour.com/band/for-today |title=Bands / 2013 Vans Warped Tour / Tickets on Sale Now / For Today |publisher=Vanswarpedtour.com |access-date=January 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217200136/http://vanswarpedtour.com/band/for-today |archive-date=February 17, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
