== Early life ==

Ozuna was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] to a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] father and a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] mother.<!--Discuss on Talk page--><ref name="clarin">{{Cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/espectaculos/musica/ozuna-reggaeton-importante-pasando-musica_0_BkoxkjROG.html |title=Entrevista Ozuna: "El reggaetón es lo más importante que está pasando en la música" |date=March 9, 2018 |work=Clarín |access-date=September 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name=brink>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/10/04/ozuna-interview-odisea-tu-foto-se-preparo|title=Ozuna is on the brink of global superstardom|work=The Fader|last=Reichard|first=Raquel|date=October 4, 2017|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> He grew up listening to traditional Latin genres such as salsa and bachata, which have influenced his musical style.<ref name=brink /> He additionally enjoyed reggaeton artists [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Don Omar]], and [[Wisin y Yandel]], which he refers to as "the real, real reggaeton", as well as American hip-hop and R&B artists [[Jay-Z]] and [[Usher (musician)|Usher]].<ref name=ozunawrestles>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2019/11/25/ozuna-wrestles-with-being-the-new-king-of-reggaeton/|title=Ozuna wrestles with being 'the new king of reggaeton'|last=Arnold|first=Chuck|date=November 25, 2019|access-date=April 16, 2020|work=New York Post}}</ref> As stated in the eponymous opening track from his album ''Odisea'', he grew up poor and was mainly raised by his paternal grandmother. His father, who worked as a dancer for reggaeton performer [[Vico C]] for three years, was fatally shot when Ozuna was three years old, and his mother was not financially stable enough to raise him.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lowe|first=Lawrence|title=Ozuna: el hijo fiel de Puerto Rico|url=http://www.billboard.com.ar/noticia/4761/ozuna-el-hijo-fiel-de-puerto-rico|work=Billboard Argentina|date=March 2, 2018|access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>

Ozuna was raised in his grandmother's three-bedroom apartment built above a bodega in San Juan.<ref name=homecoming>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8099697/ozuna-interview-puerto-rico-latin-superstar-homecoming|title= Ozuna In Puerto Rico: A Latin Superstar's Homecoming|work=Billboard|last=Lowe|first=Lawrence|date=February 15, 2018|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> His grandmother instilled a strong Christian faith in him. He explained that her philosophy centered around the ideal "that nothing is given to us, that you have to work for what you get...a pair of sneakers—we bought those with sacrifice. She would say the same of a pencil, an eraser, simple things. We had to sweat in order to get it."<ref name=homecoming /> Drawing influence from the Latin music he grew up on, he decided to pursue a singing career at age twelve.<ref name=brink /> That same year, his uncle, who served as a father-figure since his father's death, gifted him his first microphone.<ref name=homecoming /> His uncle often played music by Daddy Yankee, Don Omar and [[De La Ghetto]], and the teenager would rap along with the songs on the microphone.<ref name=homecoming />

To further his career, Ozuna took a job at a local bar called El Corozal, where his earliest musical performances took place.<ref name=homecoming /> Hoping to escape the violence and poverty of his neighborhood, he moved to the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|title=¿Reguetón, bachata o trap latino?

As described by a ''[[The New York Times]]'' article, Ozuna "can work across all these genres at the same time is a testament to the current fluidity of Latin pop, but also to the effectiveness of his singing. He has a sweet, nimble voice that he sometimes deploys like a balladeer, and sometimes like a rapper."<ref name=doesitall /> Elias Leight of ''Rolling Stone'' described Ozuna's voice as "slim but slicing, precise and hard to imitate".<ref name=aurarsreview /> Joey Guerra of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' observed that Ozuna "isn't quite as adventurous as contemporaries J Balvin or Bad Bunny.

== Philanthropy ==

== Controversies ==

On January 5, 2017, he was arrested along with his work team at the [[El Dorado International Airport]] in [[Bogotá, Colombia]], by immigration agents. The incident occurred after he and his producer acted violently before the agents, which caused the reprogramming of a concert scheduled in [[Manizales]]. On July 30 of the same year, during a concert at United Palace, New York, Ozuna struck a security guard on the head, with his microphone, for being on stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://exafm.com/#!/costarica/noticias/ozuna-agrede-a-un-guardia-de-seguridad-en-pleno-concierto-199.html|title=Ozuna agrede a un guardia de seguridad en pleno concierto|work=Billboard}}</ref> After receiving criticism for what he did, he expressed regret through Facebook.

In August of the same year, he was nearby when Carlos "Tonka" Báez Rosa, a drug trafficker, was murdered. He said he heard the shooting and fled the scene leaving his vehicle, a [[Range Rover]] truck, and that the victim was his close friend. He was linked to the investigation of the crime when the police found his truck near the scene. On August 7, the car was seized by police, and he received a death threat from a group of drug traffickers. A few days later, police said there was no direct link between his car and the shooting.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.univision.com/radio/puerto-rico-wkaq-am/lo-que-sabemos-y-lo-que-no-sobre-el-tiroteo-mortal-del-que-escapo-ozuna|title=Lo que sabemos (y lo que no) sobre el tiroteo mortal del que escapó Ozuna|newspaper=Univision|language=es}}</ref>

In January 2019, Ozuna confirmed he had been the victim of an [[extortion]] scam involving an explicit video filmed of him when he was a minor. The FBI investigated the case, and Ozuna's lawyer confirmed that [[Kevin Fret]], an openly gay trap singer, was the person extorting Ozuna. Kevin Fret was murdered, and police said that Ozuna was not a suspect in the murder. For the video, which had been edited to cause Ozuna more damage, Ozuna apologized to his fans and family.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cobo |first=Leila |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8494700/ozuna-confirms-victim-extortion-video |title=Ozuna Confirms He Was the Victim of Extortion: 'What Happened Was a Mistake of the Past' |work=Billboard |date=January 23, 2019 |access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref>
