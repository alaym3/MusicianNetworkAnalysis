== History ==
The First Louisiana Midland (LM) was formed on January 1, 1946, by H.H. Holloway, Sr. Mr. Holloway owned a gravel pit at Rhinehart, Louisiana, on the Louisiana & Arkansas Railway's (L&A) main line. When the L&A made plans to dispose of the branch Mr. Holloway knowing without the railroad his gravel pit operations would ultimately fail. The LM consisted of a 76.7-mile branch line from [[Packton, Louisiana]], to [[Vidalia, Louisiana]], from the [[Louisiana and Arkansas Railway]].  Passenger service was discontinued in 1953.  On April 28, 1967, the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] absorbed the Louisiana Midland as part of its absorption of the [[Mississippi Central Railroad (1904-1967)|Mississippi Central Railroad]].<ref name="lewis">{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Edward A. |author-link = Edward A.

In the 1980s, through freight service was discontinued between Packton and [[Ferriday, Louisiana]], because of poor track conditions and lack of demand, reducing the Louisiana Midland's operations to switching service at Packton and Ferriday.  Traffic at the time included pulpwood, wood products and general commodities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Edward A. |author-link = Edward A.
