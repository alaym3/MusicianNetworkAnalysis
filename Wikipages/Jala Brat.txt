Jala also represented [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]] by co-writing and performing "[[Ljubav je]]" together with [[Dalal Midhat-Talakić|Dalal]], [[Deen (singer)|Deen]] and [[Ana Rucner]] but failed to qualify to the final.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leon|first1=Jakov I.|last2=Jordan|first2=Paul|title=Dalal, Deen, Ana & Jala sing 'Ljubav je' for Bosnia & Herzegovina!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=watch_tonight_bosnia_and_herzegovinas_entry_for_2016|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|access-date=21 February 2016|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>

In the summer of 2016, Jala announced he would run as a candidate for the [[Party of Democratic Action]] (SDA) in Bosnia's 2016 municipal elections.<ref>[https://www.vecernji.ba/vijesti/kandidati-na-izborima-glumci-pjevaci-glazbenici-nogometasi-1100191 "Kandidati na izborima: Glumci, pjevači, glazbenici, nogometaši..."]</ref>

==Career==
===Beginning of the career===
Jala started making rap music in 2004 at his improvised house-studio. Later, he formed a [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] group [[Bluntbylon]] with [[Smayla]] and several other members. Their career started mostly on [[YouTube]]. He also made a few solo-works at that period. In 2011, he released his first [[Extended play|EP]] ''Replay'', on which his first song with Buba Corelli appeared.

===2012 works===
In 2012 he released his first solo album ''Riječ na riječ''. He also released EP ''Mahala'' with [[Shtela]]. He also started making album ''Lice Ulice'', but it is still unfinished yet. In 2012 two singles were released, (''Lice Ulice'' and ''Uzeću vam sve).''

In 2015, ''Dom,'' the third single from album was released, revealing that the project is not canceled but only paused. Also, in 2012 Jala, alongside Buba Corelli, started releasing singles from EP ''SA Sin City''. There were 5 singles released, and EP was fully completed in 2013.

===''Pakt s Đavolom'' alongside Buba Corelli===
On 16 November 2014, the first single from the album, "Bez Tebe", was released. Full album was released on 13 December 2014, following three singles (''22'', ''Trinidad & Tobago'' and ''Borba''). The album gained huge success and Jala and Corelli were the most listened rappers in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time.

Following the success of ''Pakt s Đavolom'', in 2015 both Jala and Buba Corelli started to make their music more commercial and less underground as they used to. In 6 September Jala released a single ''Casino''.Buba Corelli was jailed during that time, and Jala continued to make music without him until the end of Eurovision when Corelli was released.

During Corelli's time in jail, Jala released a single ''Dom'' from album ''Lice Ulice'' that was dedicated to Corelli and 3 other rappers who were jailed alongside him. Although he wasn't singing [[turbo-folk]] himself, he made several works with turbo-folk artists [[Dado Polumenta]] (''Dominantna''), [[Maya Berović]] (''To me radi'', with Buba Corelli as a co-star) and [[Mile Kitić]]'s daughter, [[Elena Kitić]]. On 28 July 2016, Elena released her first official song ''Folira'' where Jala was a co-star.

In October 2016, both Jala and Buba Corelli announced that they will publish new album "Kruna". Album contains 8 singles. It was more commercial than their last albums, and most of the songs don't include both Jala and Buba. Only two singles, ''Klinka'' and ''Ne Volim'' (featuring Elena) were made by both of them. 3 singles, ''Comfort'', ''Sporije'' and ''Dokaz'' were made by Buba Corelli only, and rest of them, ''Restart'', ''La Martina'' and ''Bakšiš'' were made by Jala. The album used advanced technology, with 6 out of 8 singles published with [[4K resolution|4K]] videos, and two lyrics videos.

==Collaboration with other rappers==
Since 2011 Jala was mostly collaborating with Bosnian underground rappers that were mostly popular at that time. Besides Buba Corelli, he was known for his work with his colleagues from Bluntbylon, with Smayla as most popular one. He was also working with Buba Corelli's group [[G recordz]] and their members.

He also made several songs with rappers [[Klijent]] and [[Anći]] and also members of the [[Sarajevo]] groups [[Treća Smjena Crew]], [[Capital City Crew]] and [[Dlan Beats]]. In 2012 he was working with one of the biggest Bosnian rappers, [[Frenkie]], with whom he released music video ''Ne odustajem'' for the song of the same name from ''Riječ na Riječ''. He later made several works with [[Serbia]]n [[Juice (Serbian rapper)|Juice]] who was also his guest on ''Pakt s Đavolom''. In 2018, he released the promotional single "[[Mafia (Jala Brat and Buba Corelli song)|Mafia]]" with [[Buba Corelli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/amp/180417097|title=Spot "Mafia" Jale Brata i Bube Corellija za dva dana prikupio više od milion i po pregleda|date=17 April 2018|publisher=Klix|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref>
