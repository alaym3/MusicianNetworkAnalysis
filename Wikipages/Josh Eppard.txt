'''Josh Eric Eppard''' (born December 6, 1979) is an American musician from [[Kingston, New York]] and the drummer for [[progressive rock]] band [[Coheed and Cambria]]. He has worked as a solo [[rapping|rapper]] under the name '''Weerd Science''' and was the drummer for [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] rock band [[Terrible Things]]. Josh was a founding member of the [[Woodstock, NY]] [[new prog]] outfit [[3 (American band)|3]] along with his brother [[Joey Eppard|Joey]] and studio engineer Chris Bittner.

On November 2, 2006 it was announced that Josh would be leaving Coheed and Cambria indefinitely, with [[Chris Pennie]] as his replacement. The reason for his abrupt departure from the band had been shrouded in mystery. However, in an interview with Michael Dodd of Get Your Rock Out, Josh laid the rumours to rest. Though there was speculation Josh had left the band due to "creative limitations", his split from the band actually resulted from a bout with drug addiction that had been exacerbated by the frantic touring schedule, among other things. Citing an often asked question of him as to whether he quit the band or was fired, Josh's response was that he was likely "about to be fired" before he left.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMj5jPS0czM |title=Josh Eppard on leaving and rejoining Coheed and Cambria |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrZ-avqLvo |title=Coheed and Cambria interview |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

After leaving Coheed and Cambria, Josh recorded his second Weerd Science album, ''Sick Kids'', at Darkworld Studio in [[Kingston, NY]] and Applehead Studios in [[Woodstock, NY]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Un |url=http://www.myspace.com/weerdscience |title=Weerd Science's Myspace Profile |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2011-10-13}}</ref> The album is a creative look into the drug addiction the artist suffered, offering, in addition to a very trying personal account, an insightful social commentary on the current condition of the United States. More recently, he also formed a new rock band, Mours, with friend and collaborator [[Dave Parker (rock musician)|Dave Parker]] and musician Anthony Masington.

In 2009, Josh began drumming in [[Terrible Things]], a band he formed with fellow musicians [[Fred Mascherino]], [[Hot Rod Circuit|Andy Jackson]], and bassist Steve Lucarelli, who has since left the band. They have been touring and released their debut, ''[[Terrible Things (album)|Terrible Things]]'' on [[Universal Motown]] on August 31, 2010. In 2011, Josh signed with [[Horris Records]].<ref name=hatchettv>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8-MjPyX1Ok |title=MC Lars and Weerd Science interview Part 1 |publisher=hatchettv |access-date=June 30, 2011}}</ref>

On November 16, 2011, Coheed and Cambria revealed on their website that Josh had officially rejoined the band. On the [[Terrible Things]] YouTube channel, Terrible Things vocalist [[Fred Mascherino]] announced that Josh had left Terrible Things.<ref name=weareterriblethings>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0CWLCYgNrE |title=11-16-2011 (Terrible Things announcement about Josh Eppard's Departure) |author=Fred Mascherino |date=November 16, 2011 |publisher=weareterriblethings |access-date=November 16, 2011}}</ref>
