The youngest child of the Quintanilla family, she debuted on the music scene as a member of the band [[Selena y Los Dinos]], which also included her elder siblings [[A.B. Quintanilla]] and [[Suzette Quintanilla]]. In the 1980s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across Texas for performing [[Tejano music]]{{mdash}}a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the [[Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of The Year]] in 1987, which she won nine consecutive times. She signed with [[Capitol Latin|EMI Latin]] in 1989 and released her [[Selena (album)|self-titled debut album]] the same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter.

Selena released ''[[Entre a Mi Mundo]]'' (1992), which peaked at number one on the US ''Billboard'' [[Regional Mexican Albums]] chart for eight consecutive months. The album's commercial success led music critics to call it the "breakthrough" recording of her musical career. One of its singles, "[[Como la Flor]]", became one of her most popular [[signature song]]s. ''[[Selena Live!|Live!]]'' (1993) won [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican/American Album]] at the [[36th Grammy Awards|1994 Grammy Awards]], becoming the first recording by a female Tejano artist to do so. In 1994, she released ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'', which became one of the [[List of best-selling Latin albums in the United States|best-selling Latin albums in the United States]]. It was critically acclaimed as being responsible for Tejano music's first marketable era as it became one of the most popular [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] subgenres at the time.

Selena was [[Murder of Selena|shot and killed]] on March 31, 1995, by [[Yolanda Saldívar]], her friend and the former manager of her [[Selena Etc.|Selena Etc. boutiques]]. Saldívar was cornered by police when she attempted to flee and threatened to kill herself but was convinced to give herself up. She was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison with possible parole after 30 years. Two weeks later, [[George W. Bush]], then-governor of Texas, declared April 16 as Selena Day in Texas. Her posthumous [[crossover (music)|crossover]] album, ''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' (1995), debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],  making Selena the first Latin artist to accomplish this feat. In 1997, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'', a film about her life and career, which starred a then-unknown [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Selena, catapulting her into fame. In 2020, [[Netflix]] released ''[[Selena: The Series]]'' starring [[Christian Serratos]]. Selena has sold around 18 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling female artists in Latin music.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Navarro • •|first=Heather|title=Selena Remembered 25 Years After Death|url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/selena-remembered-25-years-after-death/2338321/|access-date=October 14, 2021|website=NBC Los Angeles|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Murder ==
{{Main|Murder of Selena|Trial of Yolanda Saldívar}}
The Quintanilla family appointed [[Yolanda Saldívar]] as manager of Selena's boutiques in early 1994.<ref name=orlando /> Eight months later, Selena signed Saldívar as her [[registered agent]] in San Antonio, Texas. After the agreement, Saldívar moved from San Antonio to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=146}} In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer after the number of staff for both stores had decreased.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=182}} According to staff members, Saldívar often dismissed employees she disliked. Employees at the stores regularly complained about Saldívar's behavior to Selena, who dismissed the claims, believing Saldívar would not negatively impose erratic decisions on Selena's fashion venture. According to Quintanilla, Jr., the staff later turned their attention to him and began informing him about Saldívar's behavior. Quintanilla, Jr. took the claims seriously; he told Selena to "be careful" and said Saldívar might not be a good influence. Selena dismissed her father's inquiries because he had often distrusted people in the past.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}} By January 1995, Selena's fashion designer Martin Gomez, her cousin Debra Ramirez, and clients had expressed their concerns over Saldívar's behavior and management skills.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}}{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=171}} During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' said her devotion to Selena bordered on obsession.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=146}}

According to Quintanilla, Jr., in January 1995, he began receiving telephone calls from fans who said they had paid for membership in the Selena fan club and had received nothing in return for it, and he began an investigation.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} Quintanilla, Jr. discovered that Saldívar had embezzled more than $30,000 via forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}}<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liebrum|first1=Jennifer|last2=Jamieson|first2=Wendell|title=Selena's Killer Gets 30 Years|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/selena-killer-30-years-article-1.703778|website=NY Daily News|language=en|date=October 27, 1995}}</ref> Quintanilla, Jr. held a meeting with Selena and Suzette on the night of March 9 at [[Q-Productions]] to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. presented Saldívar with the inconsistencies about the disappeared funds. Quintanilla, Jr. told her that if she did not provide evidence that disproved his accusations, he would involve the local police. Quintanilla, Jr. banned Saldívar from having any contact with Selena. However, Selena did not want to dissolve their friendship; she thought Saldívar was essential to the success of the clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep her close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax preparation.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}}

In the days before Selena's death, Saldívar delayed handing over the bank statements and financial records by saying she had been physically and sexually assaulted in Mexico.<ref name="queen"/> Saldívar, along with Selena, appeared at a medical clinic on March 31, 1995, ostensibly to have Saldívar examined for an assault which she claimed happened to her in Monterrey.{{efn|Testimony given by nurse Carla Anthony at the Saldívar trial indicated that Saldívar and Selena's visit to her clinic occurred March 24, not March 31.<ref name="Rape">{{cite news|title=October 12, 1995 testimony of Carla Anthony |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |url=http://chron.com/content/chronicle/metropolitan/selena/transcripts/95/10/12/anthony.html |access-date=September 27, 2015 |date=October 12, 1995 |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 6, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406191637/http://chron.com/content/chronicle/metropolitan/selena/transcripts/95/10/12/anthony.html}}</ref>  The predominance of other sources indicate that Nurse Anthony is mistaken.}} During that visit, Saldívar was given a brief physical examination by the clinic's doctor, but this did not include a gynecological exam specifically done in cases of sexual assault.
