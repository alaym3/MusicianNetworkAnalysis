'''Of the Wand & the Moon''' (stylized as ''':Of the Wand & the Moon:''') is the [[neofolk]]/[[experimental music|experimental]] project of [[Denmark|Danish]] musician Kim Larsen and various guest contributors.

==Overview==
Larsen was originally a member of the gothic/doom metal band [[Saturnus (band)|Saturnus]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Jensen|first=Claus|date=|title=Interview SATURNUS / OF THE WAND AND THE MOON|url=http://www.intromental.com/webzine/interviews/saturnus.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223023903/http://www.intromental.com:80/webzine/interviews/saturnus.html|archive-date=2004-12-23|access-date=2021-03-16|website=Intromental Webzine}}</ref> but left due to personal disputes.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Vadean|first=Alina|date=2009-12-18|title=Kim Larsen (Of the Wand and the Moon) – Interview|url=https://arianrod.wordpress.com/2009/12/18/kim-larsen-of-the-wand-and-the-moon-interview/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-16|website=Good Music is Good Music|language=en}}</ref> Following this, he began the [[neofolk]] project :Of the Wand & the Moon:, as he was a longtime fan of the genre.<ref name=":1" />

In 1999, the debut :Of the Wand & the Moon: album was released, titled ''Nighttime Nightrhymes''.

2001 saw the release of a second :Of the Wand & the Moon: release titled '':Emptiness:Emptiness:Emptiness:''.

After the release of a split album with [[Sol Invictus (band)|Sol Invictus]] and a few vinyl singles, a collection of [[b-side]]s, taken from the '':Emptiness:Emptiness:Emptiness:'' sessions, titled ''Lucifer'', was released in 2003.

A third album, ''Sonnenheim'', was released in 2005. Here, the music bears a strong resemblance to that of neofolk pioneers [[Death in June]].

After a 6-year silence, a fourth album, ''[[The Lone Descent]]'', was released in 2011. It features more contemporary influences and a richer production. The album was received with great critical acclaim and is considered a neofolk masterpiece.<ref>[http://souciant.com/2012/11/of-the-wand-and-the-moon/ Interview] 2012 Kim Larsen with Oliver Sheppard</ref>
