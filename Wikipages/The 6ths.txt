'''The 6ths''' is a band created by [[Stephin Merritt]], also the primary songwriter and instrumentalist behind [[The Magnetic Fields]], [[The Gothic Archies]], and [[Future Bible Heroes]]. One story has it that the band was conceived when Merritt, observing that there was no tribute album dedicated to him, decided to make one himself.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} In the group, Merritt writes and plays songs which are then sung by other artists—a different artist on each track. It has so far produced two well-received albums and many different collaborations.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=the-6ths-mn0000034287|pure_url=yes}}|title=The 6ths|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|first=Richie|last=Unterberger}}</ref>

==Releases==
The two albums the band released to date are ''Wasps' Nests'' in 1995 ([[Factory Too]] via [[London Records]]) and ''Hyacinths and Thistles'' in 1999. ''Wasps' Nests'' was preceded by a 7" vinyl single of album track "Heaven in a Black Leather Jacket" in 1993 on [[Merge Records]] that contains a B-side, "Rot in the Sun", sung by Merritt himself. The song was also later included on Merritt's ''[[Obscurities (Stephin Merritt album)|Obscurities]]'' compilation in 2011.

The names of both albums, as well as the name of the band, are deliberate [[tongue-twister]]s.  The words are chosen for their abundance of ''s'' and ''th'' sounds; ''sixths'' alone packs one ''th'' and three ''s'' sounds into one syllable. The band's website refers to the 6ths as "every lisper's nightmare".<ref>[http://houseoftomorrow.com/sixths.php The 6ths home page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914195014/http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/sixths.php |date=2010-09-14 }}</ref>
