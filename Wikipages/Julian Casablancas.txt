[[File:The Strokes by Roger Woolman.jpg|thumb|left|Casablancas with the Strokes in 2002]]
Upon meeting future guitarist [[Nick Valensi]] and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti|Fab Moretti]] at Dwight School in Manhattan, the three began to play music together. He reconnected with guitarist [[Albert Hammond Jr.|Albert Hammond Jr]]. when the latter moved to New York. The band was formed in 1998 when Hammond was accepted into the band,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/27/the-strokes-angles-casablancas-interview|title=The Strokes: 'All that Spinal Tap bullshit has gone out the window'|last=Hoby|first=Hermione|date=February 27, 2011|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref> with Casablancas as the lead vocalist and main songwriter and Nikolai Fraiture on bass.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=crQoYila-dAC&pg=PA74|title=Gang of Five|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|date=December 2003|publisher=Spin|pages=74|language=en}}</ref>

The band began rehearsing a fourteen-song set which included "Alone, Together", "Barely Legal", "[[Last Nite]]", "[[The Modern Age]]", "New York City Cops", "Soma", "Someday", "Take It or Leave It" and "This Life" (an early version of "Trying Your Luck"). Most of these songs now feature different lyrics. A demo sent to the newly reformed [[Rough Trade Records]] in the UK sparked interest there, leading to their first release via the website of the UK magazine, ''[[NME]],'' who gave away a free mp3 download of "[[Last Nite]]" a week prior to the physical release as part of ''[[The Modern Age]] EP'' in 2001. The EP sparked a bidding war among record labels, the largest for a rock and roll band in years. Shortly after, The Strokes' critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Is This It]]'' was released.

The band has received the highest of praise for ''Is This It,'' and it set the stage for what people expected to "save rock" in the new millennium.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/the-strokes-retrospective|title=The Fifteen-Year Decline of the Strokes|last=Nguyen|first=Kevin|date=2016-08-12|work=GQ|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref> Though some would argue that such statements left unreasonably sized shoes to fill, The Strokes are still highly recognized as one of the most influential garage rock bands of the early 2000s, paving the way for many new alternative bands to come.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/05/26/how-the-strokes-helped-make-nyc-the-worlds-sexy-rock-capital/|title=The inside story of the band that defined the 2000s|date=2017-05-26|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}</ref>

Statistically, all albums released following their debut were not nearly as successful or well received by fans and critics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} In an excerpt from Lizzie Goodman's ''Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City, 2001–2011 –'' named after The Strokes' track – Strokes guitarist, Albert Hammond Jr., comments, "With ''[[Room on Fire]]'' [2003], people were giving us shit because they said we were sounding too much the same.

After the release of the two other albums and several major tours, the band took a five-year break, then returned with their fourth album [[Angles (The Strokes album)|''Angles'']] in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/7925-this-is-it-ten-years-of-the-strokes/|title=This Is It: Ten Years of the Strokes|last=Garrett|first=Jonathan|date=March 7, 2011|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref> The five-year hiatus was said to be the result of conflicting solo projects, sobriety issues, and unspoken emotions. The Strokes' drummer Fab Moretti claimed the band struggled to process such "subconscious volcanic emotions," partly because they were still "children" at the time.<ref name=":5" />

Although their creative processes has been critiqued by outside observers as "a democracy under a dictator",<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/15495/index6.html|title=Group Therapy|website=NYMag.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref> Casablancas has encouraged each band member to contribute their own ideas and collectively sort through which ones will potentially turn into something more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/features/julian-casablancas-interview|title=Julian Casablancas Interview|work=Clash Magazine|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref> Commenting on the meticulous nature of Julian's creative process, guitarist Nick Valensi has said, "his ear is so sharp. He's the one with the ear for detail in this band. Creatively, he is a force to be reckoned with."<ref name=":6" /> The 2011 release, ''Angles,'' is said to reflect the beginning of the more collaborative nature of the band's creative process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/arts/music/the-strokes-embrace-group-dynamics-in-a-new-album.html|title=The Strokes Embrace Group Dynamics in a New Album|last=Ryzik|first=Melena|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref>

Starting May 14, 2019, The Strokes teased some of new songs, starting with "[[The Adults Are Talking|The Adults are Talking]]", live at [[Pellissier Building and Wiltern Theatre|The Wiltern]] in Los Angeles, giving remarks that there is a possibility for the Strokes to release a new album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-strokes-the-adults-are-talking-live-835099/|title=Watch The Strokes Debut New Song 'The Adults Are Talking'|last=Zemler|first=Emily|date=2019-05-14|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> On December 31, 2019, at Brooklyn NYE, they performed "[[Ode to the Mets]]" as an offer from Casablancas to sing live instead of singing songs from ''Angles'' as requested by fans.

As a solo artist, Casablancas set out with an intention to say what was on his mind, both musically and lyrically.<ref name=":1" /> Speaking on his experience as a solo artist versus releasing music with The Strokes, the singer has put it simply, "it's like touring with me or with five of me," meaning that each member has their own opinionated state of mind. While such statements raised much concern for the relations between the band members, Casablancas claims that in pursuit of a solo career, he is protecting the integrity of the [Strokes] vibe.<ref>{{Citation|last=Beat Magazine|title=Julian Casablancas Interview|date=2010-05-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRtj6wQngg4&t=400s|access-date=2018-11-09}}</ref> In having a musical project separate from The Strokes, he is able to "chase down any idea [he] wants", which he would refrain from doing with the band.<ref>{{Citation|last=PerryPoucheen|title=Julian Casablancas - Interview.|date=2011-05-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ryXJJKXP4&list=PLLZeeZuy6roL7ocqOmOliMSrTX-r3XZCz|access-date=2018-11-09}}</ref>

He discussed his new influences by saying "I would've gone weirder with the music, but I wanted to be smart. I didn't want people to say, 'Okay, this is his weird abstract thing,' and dismiss the album. I worked too hard on it for that to happen...

Along with Casablancas as lead vocalist, the band consists of Jeramy "Beardo" Gritter and Amir Yaghmai on guitar, Jacob "Jake" Bercovici on bass (as well as synthesizer), Alex Carapetis on drums and percussion, and Jeff Kite on keyboard.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Wanting to earn a greater sense of respect as a band, rather than be perceived as a "side-project" of Julian's, the band officially changed their name from "Julian Casablancas + The Voidz" to simply "The Voidz" during an 'initiation' video on the band's YouTube page on December 8, 2017.<ref>{{Citation|last=The Voidz|title=The Voidz "initiate" Julian (band name change/album announce)|date=December 8, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQx3h5D9pwg|access-date=January 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=http://www.self-titledmag.com/2018/10/04/the-voidz-feature-interview/|title=Enter The Voidz|date=2018-10-04|work=self-titled|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}</ref> Julian performed with Carapetis and Kite throughout the tour for his solo album, ''Phrazes for the Young''.

== Musical influences and legacy ==
Casablancas cites [[The Doors]] as one of his earliest musical influences, though he specifies that he was influenced by their musical style rather than the public image of their vocalist and frontman [[Jim Morrison]].<ref name=":4" /> He has also cited [[Lou Reed]] of [[The Velvet Underground]] as a major influence on his lyrics and singing style. He stated in a ''Rolling Stone'' interview, "The way Lou Reed wrote and sang about drugs and sex, about the people around him — it was so matter-of-fact. He could be romantic in the way he portrayed these crazy situations, but he was also intensely real. It was poetry and journalism." Additionally, he has stated that [[Bob Marley]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2010/08/drinks-with-julian-casablancas/|title=Drinks With: Julian Casablancas|last=Matheny|first=Skip|date=August 2, 2010|website=American Songwriter|publisher=AmericanSongwriter.com|access-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref> [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and [[Pearl Jam]] are major influences on his work, even referring to the Pearl Jam song "[[Yellow Ledbetter]]" as the reason he started making music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-strokes-elegantly-wasted-20031113|title=The Strokes: Elegantly Wasted|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=November 13, 2003|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=September 27, 2014}}</ref> He also, in agreement with several of his Voidz bandmates, named [[Stevie Wonder]] as a composer with a "next level mind".<ref name=":4" />

=== Politics ===
Throughout the 2010s, Casablancas became increasingly vocal about his political interests and has said that "whoever's propaganda's the loudest" determines popularity within music and politics alike.<ref name=":2" /> He has overtly explored this link in his work with [[The Voidz]], although he claims that the re-election of [[George W.
