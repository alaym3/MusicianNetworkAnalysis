'''Gipsy Kings''' are a group of [[flamenco]], [[salsa music|salsa]], and [[Pop music|pop]] musicians from [[Arles]] and [[Montpellier]] in the [[south of France]], who perform mostly in Spanish, but also mixing southern French dialects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radio.cz/es/rubrica/notas/gipsy-kings-presentaron-en-praga-su-ultimo-album-roots|title = Gipsy Kings presentaron en Praga su último álbum "Roots"|date = 4 May 2004}}</ref> Although the group members were born in France, their parents were mostly ''[[gitanos]]'', Spanish [[Romani people|Romani]] who fled Spain during the 1930s [[Spanish Civil War]]. They are known for bringing [[rumba flamenca]], a pop-oriented music distantly derived from traditional [[flamenco]] music, to worldwide audiences. The group originally called itself '''Los Reyes'''.

==Career==
Gipsy Kings, born in France but brought up within Spanish culture, are largely responsible for bringing the sounds of progressive pop-oriented flamenco to a worldwide audience. The band started out in [[Arles]], a town in southern France, during the 1970s, when brothers [[Nicolas Reyes|Nicolas]] and Andre Reyes, the sons of flamenco artist Jose Reyes, teamed up with their cousins Jacques, Maurice, and [[Tonino Baliardo]].<ref name=Sullivan/> At the time, Reyes and [[Manitas de Plata]] were a duo who triggered the wider popularity of [[rumba flamenca]] (also known as Spanish or gypsy rumba). When Reyes split from Manitas de Plata, he started a group made up of his sons, which he called Los Reyes (as well as being their family name, ''reyes'' means "kings" in Spanish).

Los Reyes started out as a gypsy band. They traveled around France, playing at weddings, festivals, and in the streets. Because they lived so much like gypsies, the band adopted the name Gipsy Kings. Later, they were hired to add color to upper-class parties in such places as [[St. Tropez]], but their first two albums attracted little notice. At this point, the ''Gipsies'' played traditional flamenco invigorated by Tonino Baliardo's guitar playing and Nicolas Reyes' voice.

The Gipsy King lineup featured a combination of left and right-handed guitarists; three of the Reyes brothers (Nicolas, Andre', and Patchai) play guitar left-handed, and play left-hand (and sometimes right-hand) guitars that are strung for right-handers (i.e., with the low "E" string on the bottom), while Diego Baliardo plays a left-handed guitar that is strung for left hand (i.e., with the low "E" string on the top). Together with right-handers Canut and Paul Reyes, and Paco Baliardo, these guitarists focus on delivering the strong underpinning rhythms while the more complex leads are performed by the right-handed and conventionally-styled Tonino Baliardo.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Success===
Gipsy Kings became popular with their [[Gipsy Kings (album)|self-titled third album]], which included the songs "[[Djobi Djoba]]", "[[Bamboléo]]", and the ballad "[[Un Amor]]".

''Gipsy Kings'' was released in the United States in 1989 and spent 40 weeks on the charts, one of few [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] albums to do so.<ref name=Gray2009/> The band covered "[[I've Got No Strings]]" for the 1991 [[Disney]] video and compilation album ''[[Simply Mad About the Mouse]]''. Their cover version of "[[Hotel California]]" was an example of fast flamenco guitar leads and rhythmic strumming; it was featured in the 1998 [[Joel and Ethan Coen|Coen Brothers']] movie ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.<ref name=Jones2012/> The 2010 film ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' featured their rendition of "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]", a Spanish-language version titled "Hay un Amigo en Mi", and performed in a recognisably flamenco style.<ref name=DC/> "Bamboleo" was featured in a grocery store scene in the 2016 film ''[[Sing (2016 American film)|Sing]]''.

The band have been criticised by flamenco purists, but Nicolas Reyes has said in an interview that the flamenco world is not in great shape itself and that the band are proud of their success. Their 1997 album ''[[Compas (album)|Compas]]'' contains more traditional flamenco music.<ref name=Wald/>

==Solo projects==

Some of the individual members of the band have put out their own albums. In 1988, Canut Reyes released his solo project ''Boléro''. He has since released a second solo album, titled ''Gitano''. André Reyes recorded a solo album in 1992, but never released it officially. Unlicensed copies were acquired by fans and released online.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Tonino Baliardo]] released his own instrumental album, ''Essences'', in 2001, re-released in 2003.

==Collaborations==

Gipsy Kings have collaborated with many renowned artists. These efforts include "Speaking of Dreams" with [[Joan Baez]] in 1990, "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]" with [[Francis Cabrel]] in 1993, a version of [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[One Love (Bob Marley song)|One Love]]" sung with his son [[Ziggy Marley]], and Georges Reyes' song "Donde esta el amor" with Nicolas Reyes in 2006. They also performed "Get Up!" with [[Captain Jack (band)|Captain Jack]], and covered a version of the [[Doobie Brothers]]' "Long Train Running" with [[Bananarama]] on their ''Pop Life'' album, under the pseudonym Alma de Noche.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
