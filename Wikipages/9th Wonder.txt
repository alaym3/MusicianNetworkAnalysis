== Music career ==
9th Wonder's first significant career breakthrough came in 2003 when, as an up-and-coming producer, he released an unofficial remix album of [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]]' 2002 album ''[[God's Son (album)|God's Son]]'' entitled ''[[God's Stepson]]''.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Released through internet outlets, the album garnered significant attention and acclaim.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> The producer has said that he was not thinking in terms of using it to generate a buzz or promote his skills at that point: "I never thought any of this of me as a producer was going to happen."<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> The album has since been credited as starting the now regular trend for unofficial 'home-made' remixes of whole albums.<ref name="hitquarters.com" />

9th Wonder began his career as the main producer for the group [[Little Brother (group)|Little Brother]]. As part of Little Brother he gained recognition and critical acclaim for his production on their debut 2003 release, ''[[The Listening (Little Brother album)|The Listening]]''. [[Jay-Z]]'s studio engineer Young Guru was impressed with his work, and contacted 9th Wonder, which led to 9th Wonder producing "Threat" for Jay-Z's 2003 ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]''.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> The cut proved to be a mainstream breakthrough for 9th Wonder, most immediately in the major production role he secured on Destiny's Child's 2004 ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]'' album that Jay-Z was instrumental in helping bring about.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> On the album, 9th Wonder produced the tracks "[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]" and "Is She the Reason", plus the bonus track "Game Over".

9th Wonder left Little Brother in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/news.php3?id=1510 |title=Hip Hop News Audio, News, Videos, Albums, Ringtones, Lyrics, Urban Wear |publisher=HipHopGame.com |date=January 27, 2007 |access-date=May 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402125042/http://www.hiphopgame.com/news.php3?id=1510 |archive-date=April 2, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Listen to More: Producer, Underground |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/9th-wonder-interview-1011071/ |title=9th Wonder Interview |publisher=Djbooth.net |date=October 10, 2007 |access-date=May 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613162350/http://www.djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/9th-wonder-interview-1011071/ |archive-date=June 13, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

== Recent and current projects ==
In August 2010, Drake exchanged tweets with 9th Wonder on [[Twitter]], expressing his desire to work with him again (the first time being the production of "Think Good Thoughts" featuring [[Phonte]] and [[Elzhi]] for his 2007 mixtape ''[[Comeback Season (mixtape)|Comeback Season]]''). It was revealed in October 2010 that 9th Wonder would be producing for Drake on his second album, ''[[Take Care (album)|Take Care]]'', which was released on November 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/10/07/drake-shares-producers-on-second-album-still-uncertain-of-title/ |title=Drake Shares Producers on Second Album, Still Uncertain of Title |publisher=Rap-Up Magazine |date=October 7, 2010 |access-date=October 11, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101010102448/http://www.rap-up.com/2010/10/07/drake-shares-producers-on-second-album-still-uncertain-of-title/| archive-date= October 10, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> However, a month prior to the release, 9th Wonder said in an interview that he would not appear on ''Take Care'' due to [[A&R]] issues.<ref>{{cite news|last=Iraheta|first=Mark|title=9th Wonder Will Not Appear on Drake's 'Take Care'|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/10/9th-wonder-will-not-appear-on-drakes-take-care|access-date=October 16, 2011|newspaper=Complex Magazine|date=October 12, 2011}}</ref>

== Hip hop professor and academia ==
2007 saw a sideline move into music academia for 9th Wonder when he, along with [[Christopher "Play" Martin]] from hip hop group [[Kid-n-Play]], was appointed Artist-In-Residence by the Chancellor of [[North Carolina Central University]], and began instructing a hip hop history class in NCCU's Music Dept.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nccu.edu/directory/details.cfm?id=pdouthit&search=&department=Music |title=Online Campus Directory |publisher=Nccu.edu |access-date=December 7, 2012}}</ref>

His role as a music professor has proven an ongoing one as in January 2010 it was announced that 9th Wonder would co-teach a class titled "Sampling Soul" with Dr. Mark Anthony Neal at Duke University.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=67160 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209234152/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=67160 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |title=9th Wonder to Teach Course at Duke University &#124; XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=January 7, 2010 |access-date=December 7, 2012 }}</ref> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], he explained the reason for the move into academia: "Educating the youth on where hip-hop comes from and the history of it, using the records we use, gives hip-hop a longer life. I decided to become an advocate of that."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_9thWonder_Interview.html |title=Interview With 9th Wonder |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=May 31, 2010 |access-date=June 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906062832/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_9thWonder_Interview.html |archive-date=September 6, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 9th Wonder also recently took on a course titled "Intro to Hip Hop Production".<ref>[https://trinity.duke.edu/directory/people/d]</ref>

In May 2021, Douthit joined the Faculty at Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment at [[Long Island University]] as a [[Visiting scholar|visiting professor]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://stupiddope.com/2021/05/24/9th-wonder-joins-faculty-at-roc-nation-school-of-music-sports-entertainment-at-long-island-university/ |title=9th Wonder Joins Faculty at Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment at Long Island University |publisher=stupiddope.com |date=May 24, 2021 |accessdate=September 13, 2021}}</ref> His courses include the history of hip hop.
