==History==
===2007–2008: Formation and early career===
Christofer Drew Ingle began making music under the alias nevershoutnever! in 2007, when he was 16 years old. His first exposure came through the internet, where he achieved success on [[Myspace]] before issuing the extended play, ''The Yippee EP'' on July 29, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Jeffries |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/never-shout-never-mn0001019495/biography |title=Never Shout Never &#124; Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2015-11-09}}</ref> On July 30, 2008, he was featured on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'', where he performed his single "Bigcitydreams".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?vid=262521 |title=Big City Dreams (Live) &#124; Never Shout Never &#124; Music Video |publisher=MTV |date=2008-07-31 |access-date=2009-06-12}}</ref> He toured with [[Hellogoodbye]] and [[Ace Enders]] in the fall of 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/4676.htm |title=// AP: NEWS - AP Exclusive: Hellogoodbye revamp lineup, plan fall tour |website=Altpress.com |access-date=2009-06-12}}</ref>

As of November 17, 2008, the official spelling of Ingle's alias became NeverShoutNever!. The spelling was updated on [[iTunes]] and his management company's site.

Never Shout Never headlined its first Warped Tour in Summer of 2010. Never Shout Never's second full-length album, ''[[Harmony (Never Shout Never album)|Harmony]]'', was released in August 2010. In October and November 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nevershoutnever.com/news/2010/08/13/harmony-tour/ |title=Never Shout Never News |website=Nevershoutnever.com |date=2014-08-12 |access-date=2015-11-09}}</ref> Never Shout Never co-headlined the Harmony Tour, where the bands had fans gather can foods to help those in need. As a gift to the fans, Never Shout Never and [[The Maine (band)|The Maine]] released a live split EP. The split EP was made available for free download on Never Shout Never's website.

The band's hometown, Joplin, Missouri, was heavily damaged by a [[2011 Joplin Tornado|tornado on May 22, 2011]]. Following the destruction, Ingle began a relief fund with United Way to raise $1.2 million for his hometown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Christofer Drew of NeverShoutNever Raising Money For Hometown Of Joplin, MO|url=http://www.beholdermedia.com/2011/christofer-drew-of-never-shout-never-raising-money-for-hometown-of-joplin-mo/|website=Beholdermedia.com|access-date=26 June 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124205415/http://www.beholdermedia.com/2011/christofer-drew-of-never-shout-never-raising-money-for-hometown-of-joplin-mo/|archive-date=24 January 2016}}</ref> To raise awareness about the devastation of Joplin, Ingle took video footage of the destruction and posted it on [[YouTube]] on June 1, 2011.

Never Shout Never's fourth full-length album, ''Indigo'' was released November 13, 2012. It debuted at 194 on the Billboard 200, a steep decline from the group's previous high of 14.

He had led a workshop in which a limited number of fans could ask questions and learn from him, with the addition of a one-on-one meet and greet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABzXQ3oEnkU |title=Never Shout Never Song Writing Workshops with Bandhappy |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2013-06-14 |access-date=2015-11-09}}</ref> Never Shout Never released its fifth album, ''Sunflower'', on July 2, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=PREMIERE: Listen to Never Shout Never's "Malibu"|url=http://www.purevolume.com/news/never-shout-never-malibu-stream-sunflower/|publisher=PureVolume.com|access-date=4 June 2013|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160324175340/http://www.purevolume.com/news/never%2Dshout%2Dnever%2Dmalibu%2Dstream%2Dsunflower|archive-date=24 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A festive EP titled ''[[The Xmas EP (Never Shout Never EP)|The Xmas EP]]'' was released on November 25, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Xmas EP Out Now!|url=http://nevershoutnever.com/post/68077860945/the-xmas-ep-out-now|website=Nevershoutnever.com|access-date=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429044827/http://nevershoutnever.com/post/68077860945/the-xmas-ep-out-now|archive-date=29 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===2014-2017: ''Recycled Youth'', ''Black Cat'', and Departure of MacFee===
In late 2013, Never Shout Never announced that the group was working on a new album called ''Recycled Youth, Vol. 1''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Never Shout Never Begin Recording 'Recycled Youth: Volume 1'|url=http://blastoutyourstereo.com/news/music-news/never-shout-never-begin-recording-throwback-album-recycled-youth-volume-1-7774|publisher=Brandon Flores|access-date=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429050551/http://blastoutyourstereo.com/news/music-news/never-shout-never-begin-recording-throwback-album-recycled-youth-volume-1-7774|archive-date=29 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album will feature re-worked songs from previous Never Shout Never releases. In January 2014 the band announced that the group had begun recording the album, and was expected to be released later that year.

The song "Boom!" was released on the [[Warped Tour#Official compilation albums|Vans Warped Tour 2015 Compilation CD]]. The album was released on August 7, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Ian Crawford confirmed on his Facebook page that he had been let go from the band.<ref>{{cite web|title = Ian Crawford - Well, now that the cat is finally out of... {{!}} Facebook|url = https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10205313215615174&id=1391355543|website =Facebook.com|access-date = 2015-11-24}}</ref>

=== 2017-2018: "Throwback Tour" and break-up ===
Never Shout Never performed during the 2017 [[Warped Tour]] before going on the Throwback Tour. The tour lasted throughout 2017 where they played songs from earlier albums that likely wouldn't be played again for a long time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/warped_tour_2017_lineup_announced/|title=Full Warped Tour 2017 lineup announced|first=Caitlyn|last=Ralph|website=Altpress.com|date=March 22, 2017|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/never_shout_never_announce_throwback_tour_everyone_cries_tears_of_joy/|title=Never Shout Never announce throwback tour, everyone cries tears of joy|first=Caitlyn|last=Ralph|website=Altpress.com|date=February 17, 2017|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>

On March 23, 2018, the band released a cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]" on their upcoming cover album "All for Love" composed entirely of covers of love songs. On April 2, they released their cover of [[the Beatles]]' "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4Y1Kb5uKOU|title=Never Shout Never - Love Me Tender (Official Audio)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJMqGerGmws|title=Never Shout Never - Something (Official Video)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>

Ingle revealed in December 2018 that after a small tour in Mexico and Brazil the following month that Never Shout Never would disband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/christoferdrew/status/1078017652298260487|title=After the shows in Brazil & Mexico next month NSN will be done. Thank you all. It was truly a magical journey that me and everyone involved will never forget. #NeverShoutNeverRIP|first=Chris|last=Drew|website=Twitter.com|date=December 26, 2018}}</ref> However, he reached out to fans via an Instagram post two days later asking if he should keep making music under the name. Following the final show in Brazil (with long-time drummer Hayden Kaiser absent) he stated he was uncertain of the band's future, but no official breakup announcement has yet been confirmed.<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/Br-TcqjnpZV/] {{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TeEe8EKhVU&list=RD8TeEe8EKhVU|title=Never Shout Never no Brasil (A Autêntica, Audio, Circo Voador, 2019)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>

It is unlikely ''All for Love'' was finished and will ever be released. Drew continued to upload a handful of covers on YouTube, but these were likely not final recordings for the album, nor were they likely intended to be on the album at all.

=== 2020-present: "Unborn Spark" and Potential Return ===
On April 29, 2020, Drew tweeted a video announcing a solo acoustic album titled ''[[Unborn Spark]]'', due for release on May 13, his son's 1st birthday.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Drew |first1=Christofer |title=Chris Drew on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/christoferdrew/status/1255565601734623237?s=20 |website=Twitter |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref> However, on May 5, he announced that he needed a little more time for mixing and artwork to be completed.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Drew |first1=Christofer |title=Chris Drew on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/christoferdrew/status/1257713600338280450?s=20 |website=Twitter |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref> On May 17, he announced that the album would be released on June 12.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Drew |first1=Christofer |title=Chris Drew on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/christoferdrew/status/1262084305678995456?s=20 |website=Twitter |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref> On June 8, the first single, "Time to Change", was released. With it came the announcement that it would be released as a Never Shout Never album, per the official Never Shout Never Twitter account's first tweet since May 2017.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Never Shout Never |title=Never Shout Never on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/NSNOfficial/status/1270011420541886465?s=20 |website=Twitter |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref>

In early 2021, Drew began posting tweets and Instagram stories concerning a new project he was working on, stating he was playing everything himself. These posts have since either been deleted or disappeared after 24 hours, and it is unclear if this is/was intended to be a Never Shout Never project.
