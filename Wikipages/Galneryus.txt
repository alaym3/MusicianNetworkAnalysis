{{nihongo|'''Galneryus'''|ガルネリウス|Garuneriusu|stylized as '''GALNERYUS'''|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[power metal]] band, formed in [[Osaka]] in 2001 by guitarist [[Syu]] and vocalist Yama-B.<ref name="CDJOURNAL">[http://artist.cdjournal.com/a/-/153012 Artist.cdjournal.com] ''Galneryus Artist Profile'' Retrieved Jan 23, 2011</ref><ref name="Barks">[http://www.barks.jp/artist/?id=1000001683&m=bio Barks.jp] ''ガルネリウス Biography'' Retrieved January 23, 2011</ref> Originally the only official members, the two utilized several support musicians until bassist Tsui, keyboardist Yuhki, and drummer Jun-ichi officially joined for the release of their debut album in 2003. Yama-B left the group in 2008 citing musical differences, and Yu-To, who replaced Tsui in 2006, left the following year. Galneryus recruited [[Masatoshi Ono|Sho]] on vocals and Taka on bass, and released the album ''[[Resurrection (Galneryus album)|Resurrection]]'' in 2010. Jun-ichi left in 2016, and the following year the band released their highest-charting studio album, ''Ultimate Sacrifice'', which reached number 13. In 2017, [[Loudwire]] named Galneryus one of the 10 Best Japanese Metal Bands.<ref>{{cite web| title = 10 Best Japanese Metal Bands| url = http://loudwire.com/best-japanese-metal-bands/#photogallery-1=7| work = [[Loudwire]]| date = 2017-04-20| access-date = 2017-06-08}}</ref>

==History==
===2001–2002: Formation and indie days===
Galneryus was formed in 2001 by guitarist and [[bandleader]] [[Syu]] (Valkyr, [[Animetal]], Aushvitz) and vocalist Masahiro "Yama-B" Yamaguchi (AxBites, Rekion, River End and Gunbridge).<ref name="Barks" /><ref name="Jameinterview">{{cite web| title=Exclusive interview with Syu | url=https://www.jame-world.com/en/article/19322-exclusive-interview-with-syu.html | work=jame-world.com |date=2006-12-15 | access-date=2011-01-23}}</ref> While at a live house in Kujō, [[Osaka]], Syu heard fellow [[Kansai]]-native Yama-B on the radio and knew he wanted to work with him.<ref name="Jameinterview"/> Both veterans of the metal scene, they formed Galneryus with the intention to "express both of their musical tastes/ideas" and so they started looking for additional members to complete the band. They recruited A on keyboards (who had previously played with Syu in Valkyr), Shōgo Himuro on bass, and Toshihiro "Tossan" Yui (formerly of Cemetery, Honey Quest) on drums.

In October 2001, the band released a 2-track [[Demo (music)|demo]] titled "United Flag". The demo was self-produced and released independently. This [[Extended play|EP]] started gaining the attention of both fans and independent record labels as well.

After playing with other metal bands like Fairy Mirror, Mephistopheles, Galactica Phantom, Mastermind, and [[Concerto Moon]], Galneryus went back to the studio to record a second EP. ''Rebel Flag'' was released through the independent label Iron Shock in August 2002.<ref name="RSBio">{{cite web | title = GALNERYUS - Real Sound| url = https://realsound.jp/artist/name/galneryus| work = Real Sound| language = ja| access-date = 2018-09-14}}</ref> The EP again used support musicians to fill the band slots, with Shōgo Himuro again on bass, Toshihiro Yui again on drums, and Yoshinori Kataoka on keyboards.

After this EP, the band started receiving several record deals and started touring more. In 2003, they were invited to play the Melodic Metal Festival in Japan which featured [[Sweden|Swedish]] power metal band [[Dragonland]],<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|work=[[Allmusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/galneryus-mn0000911515|title=Galneryus|access-date=2014-09-01}}</ref> as well as Australia's [[Dungeon (band)|Dungeon]]. As a result, Dragonland invited Galneryus to play with them the next time they toured Japan.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Galneryus was also invited to perform on two metal compilation cover albums with other bands such as Masaki Project, [[Saber Tiger (Band)|Saber Tiger]], and Mephistopheles. Galneryus performed the song "Black Diamond" (originally from [[Finland|Finnish]] power metal band [[Stratovarius]]) on the compilation album ''Stand Proud! III'' and performed the song "Soldier of Fortune" (from Japanese heavy metal band [[Loudness (band)|Loudness]]) on the compilation album ''Japanese Heavy Metal Tribute Tamashii II''. For these songs, the band used supporting musicians Toshihiro Yui on drums, Yusuke on bass, and Yuhki on keyboards. Both compilation albums were released simultaneously in December 2002 on the same day through Iron Shock and distributed through the record label [[Video and Audio Project|VAP]].

===2003–2007: Gone major and formal members===
VAP itself signed Galneryus and the band set to work on writing and recording their full-length debut album ''[[The Flag of Punishment]]'' which featured all 5 EP songs re-written and re-recorded and also cover art by famed ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' artist [[Yoshitaka Amano]].<ref name="Jameinterview"/> At this time Galneryus ceased using temporary members and permanently recruited Ryosuke "Tsui" Matsui (formerly of AxBites) on bass, Yuhki (formerly of Ark Storm and Marge Litch) on keyboards  and Jun-ichi Satoh (formerly of [[Concerto Moon]]) on drums. The album was finally released in October 2003.<ref name="RSBio"/> In March 2005, Galneryus released their second album ''[[Advance to the Fall]]'', and later released their third full-length album ''[[Beyond the End of Despair...]]'' in July 2006.

After the Live for Rebirth tour, Tsui left Galneryus and Yu-To (later known as Leda of [[Deluhi]])<ref name="deluhi">[http://www.jame-world.com/us/database-artists-biography-875-deluhi.html DELUHI - デルヒ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102025205/http://www.jame-world.com/us/database-artists-biography-875-deluhi.html |date=2015-01-02 }} ''jame-world.com.'' Retrieved 2015-01-01.</ref> was recruited to fill in for bass. The band shortly after released their fourth album ''[[One for All - All for One]]'' on August 22, 2007. On October 27, they released their first cover album ''Voices from the Past''. Galneryus then debuted on [[iTunes Store]], making their material available worldwide.

===2008–2011: Yama-B's departure and ''Resurrection''===
In February 2008, both sides of their double A-side single "Alsatia/Cause Disarray" were used as the opening and ending themes for the six-episode [[anime]] series ''[[Mnemosyne (anime)|Rin ~Daughters of Mnemosyne~]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/staff.html|title=XEBEC – ムネモシュネの娘たち - スタッフ＆キャスト|access-date=2017-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113064017/http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/staff.html|archive-date=2018-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On October 10, 2008, it was announced that vocalist Yama-B was leaving the band at the end of the Back to the Flag tour.<ref>{{cite web | title=Galneryus, all new line-up! | url=http://neumania.net/?p=481 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917171323/http://neumania.net/?p=481 | archive-date=2009-09-17 |publisher=neumania.net | access-date=2013-03-31}}</ref><ref name="yama-b">{{cite web| title=YAMA-B Leaves Galneryus | url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/news-38295-yama-b-leaves-galneryus.html | work=jame-world.com | access-date=2012-07-25}}</ref> The decision was made during the recording/releasing of their fifth full album, ''[[Reincarnation (Galneryus album)|Reincarnation]]''. According to Yama-B's note left to the fans on Galneryus' official site, he left due to the band's growth and change.<ref name="yama-b"/> In the note, Yama-B stated that due to differences in opinion on the band's style of music, he was leaving. He and the rest of Galneryus are all okay with this and wished each other well as they went their separate ways. Yama-B later elaborated in 2013, recalling that while he and Syu had different musical tastes from the beginning, with every release the band slowly chased after a new sound "instead of doing music we loved".<ref name="Yama-B interview">{{cite web| title=Interview with YAMA-B | url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-95206-interview-with-yama-b.html | work=jame-world.com | access-date=2013-04-16}}</ref> While Yama-B "likes to stick to a certain set of rules, concepts", particularly Syu would spontaneously abandon a style in order to incorporate new inspirations.<ref name="Yama-B interview"/> On October 23, 2008, Galneryus released their second cover album ''Voices from the Past II'', and on March 25, 2009, they released two "best of" albums.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
Syu has described the music of Galneryus as [[symphonic metal]], [[classic metal]] and [[progressive metal]]. He said that while they are very much influenced by European music, they mix it with the Japanese concept of ''[[wabi-sabi]]'' to create emotional music.<ref name="Ohanami">{{cite web| title=Galneryus im Ohanami Interview & #Fanfaces!| url=https://ohanami.de/galneryus-im-ohanami-interview-fanfaces-english-translation-inside/2/ | work=Ohanami.de|date=2014-07-16 | access-date=2021-01-01}}</ref> At the outset of the group, Yama-B and Syu wanted to stand out and so, among other things, wore [[armour]] and a red enamel outfit respectively.<ref name="Jameinterview"/> However, they eventually changed their minds and wanted to convey their music most of all. Syu explained, "The better we are, the more attention we will get."<ref name="Jameinterview"/> The members of Galneryus are known for their high level of technical proficiency with their instruments, but they consider melody the most important factor in their songs.<ref name="symph"/><ref name="RS2019">{{cite web|title=GALNERYUSが究める、ヘヴィメタル×ポップスの融合「最新作が最強というバンドでありたい」|url=https://realsound.jp/2019/10/post-434346.html|work=Real Sound|language=ja|date=2019-10-23 |access-date=2021-01-01}}</ref> Syu said a song must still be good even when stripped down to just vocals and piano.<ref name="RS2019"/> The guitarist has also said that while he wants to stand out, the vocalist should stand out the most.<ref name="Jameinterview"/> 

When composing music and trying to decide which of his projects the song will go to, Syu said he imagines the vocalist's voice and whether or not it matches the song.<ref name="Jameinterview"/> Because Galneryus has a keyboardist, the guitarist said he can "enlarge the world [he is] creating and be adventurous" with their music.<ref name="Jameinterview"/> In 2017, Syu said their previous three albums were mainly written by him and keyboardist Yuhki, with him usually writing the song first before Yuhki adds "compositions." Yuhki said that in general, up until their fifth album ''Reincarnation'', they all entered the studio together and created the arrangement by [[Jam session|jamming]].<ref name="Pureinterview">{{cite web| title=Interview with GALNERYUS at Pure Rock Japan | url=https://www.jame-world.com/en/article/142623-interview-with-galneryus-at-pure-rock-japan.html | work=jame-world.com |date=2017-07-19 | access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>

During his time with the band, the lyrics were written by Yama-B and usually in English. In 2006, they released their first song in Japanese with Syu explaining; "English is not our native tongue, so it's hard to convey our feelings in it, and Japanese listeners listen to our voice just as melodies, I guess. So if we sing in Japanese, I think we can convey more of what we feel."<ref name="Jameinterview"/> The Japanese lyrics continued when Sho joined for the same reasons.<ref name="Pureinterview"/> He usually asks the composer what kind of imagery they want the song to have before writing them.<ref name="RS2019"/>

The songs on their first three albums tell a story,<ref name="RS2016">{{cite web|title=GALNERYUSが"100％ヘヴィ・メタル"であり続ける理由「自分が聴きたいものをやる」|url=https://realsound.jp/2016/03/post-6528.html|work=Real Sound|language=ja|date=2016-03-02 |access-date=2021-01-01}}</ref> and although he said Yama-B was better suited for the task, Syu briefly described it as the adventure of a man named Galneri. Galneri failed to defeat the bad guy on the first album and was going to try again on the second, but his friends died one after another until finally only Galneri was left and he fell into despair by the end of the second album.<ref name="Jameinterview"/> On the third album, Galneri fights a dragon before teaming up with him to finally defeat the bad guy. The hero and dragon both die in the end, but the final song, "Rebirth", is about a woman who fell in love with the hero before he died and became pregnant.<ref name="Jameinterview"/> Their 2015 album ''Under the Force of Courage'' is a [[concept album]] with a single story, although its follow up also continued the concept.<ref name="Pureinterview"/> Yuhki composed its songs "Rain of Tears" and "Soul of the Field" specifically to utilize Syu's [[death growl]].<ref name="Pureinterview"/>
