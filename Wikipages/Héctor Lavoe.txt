His personality, style and the qualities of his voice led him to a successful artistic career in the whole field of [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] and [[Salsa music|salsa]] during the 1970s and 1980s.

Lavoe was born and raised in the [[Machuelo Abajo]] [[barrio]] of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]. Early in his life, he attended [[Escuela Libre de Música de Ponce]], known today as the [[Instituto de Música Juan Morel Campos]]<ref name="travelguide">{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelponce.com/Morel-Campos.html|title=Juan Morel Campos Music Institute|website=Travelponce.com}}</ref> and, inspired by Jesús Sánchez Erazo, developed an interest in music.<ref name="salsa centro">[http://www.salsacentro.com/hectorlavoe.htm The Triumph and Tragedy of Hector Lavoe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020708040117/http://salsacentro.com/hectorlavoe.htm |date=2002-07-08 }} from ''salsacentro.com''</ref> He moved to [[New York City]] on 3 May 1963, at the age of sixteen.<ref name="salsa centro"/> Shortly after his arrival, he worked as the singer in a sextet formed by Roberto García.<ref name="salsa centro"/> During this period, he performed with several other groups, including Orquesta New York, [[Kako (musician)|Kako All-Stars]], and [[Johnny Pacheco]]'s band.

In 1967, Lavoe joined [[Willie Colón]]'s band as its vocalist,<ref name="CMT"/> recording several hit songs, including "El Malo" and "Canto a Borinquen." Lavoe moved on to become a soloist and formed his own band performing as lead vocalist.<ref name="CMT"/> As a soloist, Lavoe recorded several hits including: "El cantante" composed by [[Rubén Blades]], "Bandolera" composed by Colón, and "Periódico de ayer", composed by [[Tite Curet Alonso]]. During this period he was frequently featured as a guest singer with the [[Fania All Stars]] recording numerous tracks with the band.<ref name="salsa centro"/>

In 1979, Lavoe became deeply [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and sought the help of a high priest of the [[Santería]] faith to treat his drug addiction. After a short rehabilitation, he relapsed following the deaths of his father, son, and mother-in-law.<ref name="Triump"/> These events, along with being diagnosed with [[HIV]], drove Lavoe to attempt suicide by jumping off a Condado hotel room balcony in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref name="Triump"/> He survived the attempt and recorded an album before his health began failing. Lavoe died on 29 June 1993, from a complication of [[AIDS]].<ref name="salsa centro"/>

==Early life==

Héctor was born 30 September 1946 in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]], to Francisca (Pachita) Martínez and Luis Pérez, and raised in the [[Machuelo Abajo]] [[barrio]] of the city.<ref name="Bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.solosabor.com/hectorlavoe.html |title=Solo Sabor Latin Entertainment: Héctor Lavoe |access-date=2007-06-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929050259/http://www.solosabor.com/hectorlavoe.html |archive-date=2007-09-29 }}</ref> He was inspired early in life by his musically talented family. His grandfather, Don Juan Martínez, was a singer of controversial songs, which led to physical confrontations. His uncle was well known in Ponce as a [[Tres (musical instrument)|tres]] player.<ref name="Bio"/> His mother Francisca, also known as Pachita, was well known by her family and townspeople for her beautiful singing voice.<ref name="Bio"/> His father, Luis, supported his wife and eight children by singing and playing guitar with trios and big bands. He was in high demand as a guitarist for the Fiestas de Cruz celebrations and other popular religious ceremonies, and he wanted his son to receive formal musical training as a trombonist; Héctor dreamt of being a singer.<ref name="Fania">{{cite web|url=http://www.fania.com/products/hector-lavoe-la-voz |title=Hector Lavoe - La Voz |publisher=CODIGO Group |access-date=3 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107052520/http://www.fania.com/products/hector-lavoe-la-voz |archive-date=7 January 2016 }}</ref> Héctor was influenced by Puerto Rican singers such as Jesús Sánchez Erazo, also known as "Chuíto el de Bayamón" - one of the island's most successful folk singers, and [[Daniel Santos (singer)|Daniel Santos]].<ref name="Bio"/> Later in his life, he would record songs with both artists.

Héctor attended the local [[Juan Morel Campos]] Public School of Music where the first instrument he learned to play was the [[saxophone]]. His classmates included José Febles and multi-instrumentalist [[Papo Lucca]].<ref name="Bacán"/> One of his teachers was very strict and demanded that he practice good diction and manners, and have a strong stage presence. He felt Héctor would become a superstar as a [[bolero]] singer. From the start Héctor was a star with exceptional charisma, talent, and charm. One of a kind, his unique voice, refined and with impeccable diction, demanded attention. Well on his way to becoming a popular-music vocalist, he began frequenting clubs such as Segovia, where he sang accompanied by his childhood friends, Roberto García and [[Jose Febles|José Febles]].<ref name="Fania"/> At age 17, Lavoe abandoned school and sang with a ten-piece band.<ref name="CMT">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lavoe_hector/bio.jhtml| title=CMT: Héctor Lavoe| access-date=2007-06-16}}</ref> He moved permanently to New York on 3 May 1963, against his father's wishes, as an older brother had moved there and later died of a drug overdose.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/hector_lavoe| title=Héctor Lavoe: National Geographic Music| access-date=2007-06-16| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624223629/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/hector_lavoe| archive-date=2007-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://salsa2u.freeservers.com/prod01.htm| title=Héctor Lavoe - Salsa2u| access-date=2007-06-17}}</ref> It would take many years before Héctor was able to reconcile with his father.

==Arrival in New York City==
Upon arriving in New York he was met by his sister Priscilla.<ref name="His Life">{{Cite web| url=http://www.hectorlavoe.com/home.html| title=Héctor Lavoe: His Life| access-date=2007-06-16|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070614215908/http://www.hectorlavoe.com/home.html |archive-date = 14 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first thing that he did was to visit El Barrio, New York's "[[Spanish Harlem]]."<ref name="His Life"/> Héctor was disappointed by the condition of El Barrio which he had envisioned would have "fancy Cadillacs, tall marble skyscrapers, and tree-lined streets."<ref name="His Life"/> Héctor tried to earn a living as a painter, messenger, porter and concierge.<ref name="Fania"/>

One day he reconnected with his friend Roberto García. They began to frequent Latin music and dance clubs in the Bronx, Spanish Harlem, and Lower Manhattan. In 1965, Héctor met Russell Cohen, who fronted the New Yorkers - the band Héctor would first record with - the album ''Está de bala.''<ref name="Fania"/> Héctor was invited by his friend Roberto García, a fellow musician and childhood friend, to a rehearsal of a newly formed [[sextet]].<ref name="His Life"/> When he arrived, they were rehearsing the romantic [[bolero]] "Tus Ojos". The lead vocalist was singing off key, and as a goodwill gesture, Lavoe demonstrated how it was supposed to sound.<ref name="His Life"/> As a result of this selfless act, the group offered him the job of lead vocalist, which he subsequently accepted.<ref name="His Life"/>

Later in his career he joined other salsa groups including Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars, and [[Johnny Pacheco]]'s FANIA . To distinguish Héctor from other Latino singers, a former manager made him adopt [[Felipe Rodríguez (singer)|Felipe Rodríguez]]'s moniker "La Voz" ("The Voice") and turned it into a stage name, Lavoe.<ref name="His Life"/>

In 1967, he met salsa musician and bandleader [[Willie Colón]]. Johnny Pacheco, owner of [[Fania Records]], and as its recording musical director, suggested that Colón record with Lavoe on a track on Colón's first album ''El Malo''. Given the good results, Colón had Lavoe recorded the rest of the album's vocal tracks. Willie never officially asked Lavoe to join his band, but after the recording, said to him: "On Saturday we start at 10 p.m. at El Tropicoro Club."<ref name="tbxmix">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tbxmix.com/frames/hectorlavoe.htm |title=TBXMIX: Héctor Lavoe |access-date=2007-06-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929055751/http://www.tbxmix.com/frames/hectorlavoe.htm |archive-date=2007-09-29 }}</ref>

The album's success significantly transformed both Colón's and Lavoe's lives.<ref name="His Life"/> Colón's band featured a raw, aggressive, all-trombone sound that was well received by salsa fans, and Lavoe complemented the style with his articulate voice, talent for improvisation, and sense of humor.<ref name="His Life"/> The album was a massive multimillion-dollar success in France, Panama, Colombia and other countries.<ref name="Fania"/> Héctor received instant recognition, steady work, and enough money to provide him with a comfortable lifestyle.<ref name="His Life"/> According to Lavoe, it happened so fast he did not know how to cope with his sudden success. With the sudden fame came love and lust and experimentation with marijuana, heroin, and cocaine.<ref name="Fania"/>

During that year, Lavoe started a romantic relationship with Carmen Castro. She became pregnant but refused to marry him because she considered him a "[[womanizing|womanizer]]."<ref name="American Salsa"/> Lavoe's first son, José Alberto Pérez, was born on 30 October 1968.<ref name="American Salsa"/> On the night José was baptized, Héctor received a call informing him that Nilda "Puchi" Román, with whom he also had a relationship during the same period he was with Castro, was pregnant.<ref name="American Salsa"/> Héctor's second son, Héctor Pérez Jr. was born on 25 September 1969.<ref name="American Salsa"/> Following the birth the couple married, and at Román's request, Lavoe had only minimum contact with Castro and José Alberto during their marriage.<ref name="American Salsa"/>

==Music==

===The Willie Colón years===
Willie Colón and Lavoe made fourteen albums together.<ref name="PBS">{{cite web | title=Héctor Lavoe - The Legends | website=Héctor Lavoe &#124; The Legends &#124; Latin Music USA | date=29 June 1993 | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/latinmusicusa/legends/hector-lavoe/ | access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref> In late 1970, Colón and Lavoe recorded the first of two ''Asalto Navideño'' albums, featuring Puerto Rican folk songs such as Ramito's [[Jíbaro music|jíbaro]] song "Patria y Amor", renamed "Canto a Borinquen", and original compositions.<ref name="Navidad">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilovesalsanews.com/salsa-music/asalto-navideno|title=Willie Colón/Hector Lavoe - Asalto Navideño|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172600/http://www.ilovesalsanews.com/salsa-music/asalto-navideno/|archive-date=2015-04-02}}, an ode to Panama's musical festivals that transposed a rather simple [[bass guitar]] line to trombone, producing a by-now classic salsa riff as a result.</ref>

Lavoe's lack of professionalism was often balanced by an affable onstage presence, very much resembling that of a [[stand-up comedian]].<ref name="Motherflower"/> One famous incident involved a middle-aged audience member at a dance who requested a Puerto Rican Man [[danza]] from Colón's band; Lavoe responded with an insult.<ref name="Motherflower"/> The requester then gave Lavoe such a beating that he almost ended up in the hospital. The request was finally honored on a later Colón record, ''El Juicio'' (The Trial), when he added a danza section to the Rafael Muñoz song "Soñando despierto", which Lavoe introduces with a deadpanned: "¡Para ti, motherflower!" - a [[euphemism]] for: "This one's for you, [[motherfucker]]!"<ref name="Motherflower">{{Cite web| author= Muriel, Tommy| url=http://www.herencialatina.com/Rivalidades/rivalidades_en_la_musica_latina.htm| title=Rivalidades en la música latina (o la tiradera en la salsa)| access-date=2007-06-13}}</ref>

The Colón band had other major hits, such as "Calle Luna, Calle Sol", and the [[Santería]]-influenced "Aguanile", a Pacheco song recorded in the studio by the band. "[[Mi Gente (Héctor Lavoe song)|Mi Gente]]", was better known for a live version Lavoe recorded later with the [[Fania All Stars]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 1973, Willie Colón stopped touring to dedicate himself to record production and other business enterprises. Lavoe was given the opportunity to become the bandleader of his own orchestra.<ref name="salsa centro"/> He and his band traveled the world on their own, and he would also be a guest singer with the [[Fania All-Stars]] for several shows. One of the group's notable performances took place in the [[Kinshasa]] province of the [[Zaire]] (modern day Democratic Republic of Congo) where the group performed as part of the activities promoting [[The Rumble in the Jungle]], a boxing fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]] for the heavyweight championships of the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association.<ref name="Salsa Connects">{{cite web | url=https://sports.vice.com/ca/article/salsa-connects-the-dots-from-rousey-to-the-rumble-in-the-jungle | title=Salsa Connects the Dots | publisher=Vice Sports LLC | access-date=3 November 2015}}</ref>

The Fania All Stars recorded several of their tracks during live concerts. Lavoe was part of the group when the All-Stars returned to Yankee Stadium in 1975, where the band recorded a two volume production entitled ''Live at Yankee Stadium''. The event featured the top vocalists of Fania and Vaya records. Lavoe was included in the group along with: Ismael Miranda, Cheo Feliciano, [[Justo Betancourt]], Ismael Quintana, Bobby Cruz, Pete "El Conde" Rodriguez, Santos Colón, and Celia Cruz. Lavoe recorded songs with the band in fifteen different productions, serving as vocalist on twenty-three songs. Besides recording songs with the band, Lavoe was also present in three movies filmed and produced by Fania Records; these were: ''Fania All Stars: Our Latin Thing'', ''Fania All Stars: Salsa,'' and ''Celia Cruz with the Fania All Stars: Live in Africa''.<ref name="salsa centro"/> His Colón-produced albums would be best sellers; cuts from these albums were hits in Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America:
* Lavoe's recording of [[Tite Curet Alonso]]'s "El Periódico de Ayer" was a number one hit on Mexican charts for four straight months. It was also a strong hit in several Caribbean countries and South America.<ref name="Bacán"/>
* As a producer, Willie Colón had Lavoe record what would become his [[signature song]], the [[Ruben Blades]]-authored song "El Cantante" against Blades' protests (Blades wanted to record the song on his own.). Blades has repeatedly acknowledged since then that Lavoe raised his song to classic status<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/lst/journal/v13/n1/full/lst201474a.html | title=A Tale of Two Singers | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | access-date=3 November 2015}}</ref> and that Lavoe's performance was much better than what he would accomplish with it.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
* The Lavoe song "Bandolera" was a strong seller in Puerto Rico, despite vigorous protests from Puerto Rican feminists about its lyrics and soneos - Lavoe twice offers the song's subject a beating.<ref name="Bacán"/>
* Lavoe's recording of the [[Nicolás Guillén]] poem "Sóngoro Cosongo", set to salsa music, was another major hit.<ref name="American Salsa">{{Cite web| url=http://www.americasalsa.com/biografias/hector_lavoe_02.html| title=American Salsa: Héctor Lavoe| access-date=2007-06-16}}</ref>
* The controversial [[Jíbaro music|jíbaro]] song, "Joven contra viejo", featured Lavoe and [[Daniel Santos (singer)|Daniel Santos]] settling their age-based differences on stage not without a heavy dose of humor and, yet again, Yomo Toro's cuatro music as a backdrop. Another major Christmas hit on ''Billboard'' Greatest Hits for Tropical genre in 1979 includes a song from singer/composer [[Miguel Poventud]] "Una Pena En La Navidad" from the same album titled ''Feliz Navidad''.<ref name="Bacán">{{Cite web| url=http://www.laconga.org/hl_gdominguez.htm| title=Hector Lavoe: Cronología de un Bacán de Barrio| access-date=2007-06-17}}</ref>
* Lavoe's final hit, "El Rey de la Puntualidad" (The King of Punctuality), is a humorous takeoff on Lavoe's constant tardiness and occasional absenteeism from shows.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.myjavaserver.com/servlet/losandres.Letra?arch=917| title=Hector Lavoe >> El Rey de la puntualidad| publisher=J-Lyrics| access-date=2007-07-09|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927124636/http://www.myjavaserver.com/servlet/losandres.Letra?arch=917 |archive-date = 27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Babalao">{{Cite web|author=Pepe Márquez |url=http://www.comoenla.com/nostalgias/Texto/01%20Lavoe.htm |title=Héctor Lavoe: El cantante de los cantantes |access-date=2007-06-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608154649/http://www.comoenla.com/nostalgias/Texto/01%20Lavoe.htm |archive-date=2007-06-08 }}</ref> Lavoe followed the Santeria priest's advice and cut all communication with his family and friends for a period of two months.<ref name="Babalao"/> Following this recording Héctor, reappeared confident and apparently free of his drug addiction.<ref name="Babalao"/>

==Last years and death==

Following his rehabilitation, Lavoe's life was plagued by tragic events, emotional turmoil, and pain.<ref name="Babalao"/> In 1987, his seventeen-year-old son Héctor Jr. was accidentally shot and killed by a friend. In the same period, his apartment in [[Rego Park, Queens]], was destroyed in a fire. One year later, Héctor was scheduled to perform at the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum in [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico]] on the night of Saturday 25 June 1988. Sales for the concert were poor, and promoter [[Rick Sostre]] decided to cancel the concert two hours before concert time. Héctor, defiant to the end, and knowing that it would be one of the last times he would perform in Puerto Rico, decided, against the promoter's wishes, to perform for the public who had paid to see the concert.<ref name="Triump"/> The next day, 26 June 1988, Héctor attempted suicide by jumping off the ninth floor of the Regency Hotel Condado in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref name="tbxmix"/> He survived the attempt, but from that day forward, would never completely recover.<ref name="Triump"/>

In 1990, Héctor gave his last large, public performance with the Fania All Stars at the Meadowlands in New Jersey.<ref name="His Life"/> It was meant to be his comeback concert, but Héctor could not even sing a few notes of his famous song "Mi Gente".<ref name="His Life"/>  It is believed his final public performance was a brief appearance at the club S.O.B.'s in New York City, in April 1992.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/26/arts/review-music-mambo-becomes-king-on-mondays-at-sob-s.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Review/Music; Mambo Becomes King On Mondays at S.O.B.'s | first=Jon | last=Pareles | date=1992-04-26 | access-date=2010-04-10}}</ref>

He was initially buried in [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery (Bronx)|Saint Raymond's Cemetery]] in [[the Bronx]]. In June 2002, the remains of Lavoe and his son were exhumed at his family's request and reburied in his native Ponce, along with his widow Nilda who had died a few weeks before. His remains are at the [[Cementerio Civil de Ponce]] (Ponce Civil Cemetery), in that city's [[Barrio Portugués Urbano|Portugués Urbano]] neighborhood.<ref>[https://www.periodicolaperla.com/aplauden-y-sonean-en-honor-a-hector-lavoe/ ''Aplauden y sonean en honor a Lavoe.''] Carmen Cila Rodríguez.
