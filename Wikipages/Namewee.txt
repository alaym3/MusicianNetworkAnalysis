'''Wee Meng Chee''' ({{zh|s=黄明志|p=Huáng Míngzhì}}; born 6 May 1983), widely known by his [[stage name]] '''Namewee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|m|.|w|iː}}), is a [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] [[hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist, composer, filmmaker and actor. His [[stage name]] is a bilingual pun on his first name, the [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] term for ''name'' ({{zh|c=名字|p=míngzi|links=yes}}).

Wee gained popularity after releasing a controversial song titled "Negarakuku", a remake of the national anthem of Malaysia, "[[Negaraku]]". The word ''kuku'' resembles the male reproductive organ in Chinese [[Hokkien]] dialect. In the weeks following the song's release, it drew criticism from Malaysian society. Despite the controversy surrounding "Negarakuku", Wee released his first, self-titled [[Extended play|EP]], ''Namewee'' (Chinese: 明志), in Malaysia on 3 September 2007.<ref name="Album release">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x0grVUx-Vc|date=26 August 2007|publisher=YouTube|language=zh|script-title=zh:9月3號 敬請期待|access-date=29 August 2007|author=Namewee}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://namewee.blogspot.com/2007/08/im-back.html|title=我的名字叫明志: 黃明志個人首張EP ---|last=Namewee|website=我的名字叫明志|access-date=2018-09-30}}</ref> The album was completed in May and does not contain "Negarakuku".

In early 2010, he released his first film titled ''Nasi Lemak 2.0''. Subsequently, he released ''Hantu Gangster'' and ''Kara King'', which were released in 2012 and 2013 respectively. He also started a talk show series on YouTube, ''Namewee Tokok'', in September 2012. He was nominated for the Best Male Vocal Mandarin award at the [[Golden Melody Award]] in 2016 and 2017. In August 2016, he was arrested by police for filming a music video, featuring performers dressed as religious leaders going about a church, a mosque and a Chinese temple, which allegedly insulted the dignity of [[Islam]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Malaysia's culture of tolerance is under threat|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21707565-malaysias-culture-tolerance-under-threat-taking-rap|access-date=24 September 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=24 September 2016}}</ref>

Namewee is a controversial figure in Malaysian Chinese music. He first gained mainstream popularity with his song "You're Not Red" (Chinese: 你不紅). In subsequent years, several other songs also gained global attention, such as "Thai Love Song" (Chinese: 泰國情哥), "High Pitch" (Chinese: 飆高音) "Stranger In The North" (Chinese: 漂向北方) and "Tokyo Bon 2020" (Japanese: 東京盆踊り2020). Currently, over 125 of his tracks (including those which have been removed from his YouTube channel)  have over 1 million views.<ref>{{Citation|title= Namewee's million view songs YouTube playlist |date=2019-10-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp8YAQVH95dz-796o-4vWi0Dt0ImsBgO_|access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref>

Wee has since been banned in Mainland China as a result of the song and music video "[[Fragile (Namewee song)|Fragile]]" (Chinese:玻璃心), a collaboration with Taiwan-based Australian singer [[Kimberley Chen]] which went viral in October 2021.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Backhouse|first=Andrew|date=2021-10-19|title='Insulting': Singers instantly banned in China|work=news.com.au — Australia's leading news site|url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/insulting-aussie-singer-banned-in-china-after-releasing-controversial-song/news-story/39d9b47e760dd52227e46630f09598af|access-date=2021-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Hsia|first=Hsiao-hwa|date=October 21, 2021|title='Fragile' song pillorying China's online troll army gets millions of views|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/trolls-fragile-10212021125002.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-21|website=Radio Free Asia|language=en}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Born and raised up in the town of [[Muar (town)|Muar]], Johor, Malaysia, Wee was educated in SRJK Chung Hwa 1B and Chung Hwa High School.

While in secondary school, he wrote his first 400 songs. Around the same time, Wee and a few good friends formed a band named Aunt Band (Chinese:大娘乐队) and won several competitions. He had also released several songs, along with complementary music videos on YouTube, which include ''Muar's Mandarin'' ({{zh|c=麻坡的华语| links=no}}) and ''Kawanku'' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''My friends''), the latter being a critical song directed at [[Malaysian Chinese]], [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] and [[Singaporeans]].

He majored in [[Mass communication]] as an undergraduate at [[Ming Chuan University]] in [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]], [[Taiwan]].

==Other notable works==
A small controversy erupted when a three-part video ''Teacher Hew's ABC Time'' (Chinese: ''邱老師 ABC 時間''), directed by Wee was released. In the video, a close friend of Wee, known as teacher Hew, introduces the English alphabet from an adult-oriented perspective. It soon became notorious from its heavy use of profanity as well as orgasm sounds, and the board of directors of Chung Hwa High School decided to sue Wee, as the video was filmed in the school compound, but the lawsuit was later dropped.

In July 2009, Namewee composed the theme and ending songs for the latest Singaporean film '[[Where Got Ghost?]]' which was released on 13 August 2009.

He acted as the principal cast in "Potong Saga"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://15malaysia.com/films/potong-saga/ |title=Short Film Clip{{pipe}}Potong Saga |publisher=15Malaysia |access-date=30 April 2013}}</ref> and as the supporting cast in "Meter".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://15malaysia.com/films/meter/ |title=Short Film Clip{{pipe}}Meter |publisher=15Malaysia |access-date=30 April 2013}}</ref>

Namewee also made a video clip in the late of October 2009, titled ''Namewee fuck TNB''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw5tHTkkuU |title=Namewee fuck TNB{{pipe}}停電了!黃明志大鬧國家能源局{{pipe}}Video clip |publisher=YouTube |access-date=30 April 2013}}</ref> In the video, Namewee's house and [[Muar (town)|Muar]] suffer a blackout at night, but the local TNB ([[Tenaga Nasional|Tenaga Nasional Berhad]]) branch office remains lit, while his brother is sitting for the examinations the following day, so Wee goes to TNB to look for answers, but the ensuing quarrel leads the security guards to escort him out of the facility. After that, Wee scolds TNB and tells them to 'go back to sleep'. The ending song is dedicated to attacking TNB, parodically insulting 'TNB' ('Tenaga Nasional Berhad') as "Tiu Nia Bu", foul language in Hokkien.

In May 2010, Wee made a music video ''Handicap Goal'', featuring himself and his friends, including teacher Hew, to celebrate the 2010 FIFA World Cup by playing [[association football|football]] with women.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bByWv1jiAYo 放半粒 – 黃明志|Official Fifa World Cup 2010 Song (Handicap Goal) by Namewee|video clip].</ref>

On 26 August 2010, Wee made a music video titled ''Nah! 2010'' posting on YouTube criticising a school principal in Kulaijaya, who was reported to have made racist remarks during a school assembly on 12 August 2010. The clip contained obscene language condemning the school principal and the Education Ministry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/node/138910|title=Chua calls for action against racism|website=www.thesundaily.my|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}</ref> However, Wee was asked to give a statement in Kuala Lumpur police station and also Cyberjaya Investigation Unit for two times later.

In September 2010, he published another video ''I Am Who I Am'' (Chinese: ''我還是我''), depicting his past experiences and determination to pursue his dream with no return despite having obstacles.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP9DL1lmWSM 我還是我 I AM WHO I AM by Namewee 黃明志好好野專輯主打]|video clip</ref>

In October 2010, Namewee was officially invited to attend the world-famous [[Busan International Film Festival]] in South Korea.

Wee released his first film ''[[Nasi Lemak 2.0]]''—which he starred in and directed—in September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGE2ahbs_Bw |title=Nasi Lemak 2.0 辣死你媽 電影發佈會 Namewee黃明志在NTV7 |publisher=YouTube |date=26 July 2011 |access-date=30 April 2013}}</ref> The movie gained major success in Malaysia, grossing over RM7&nbsp;million.

In September 2011, a [[public service announcement]] video titled ''Undilah'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1hllAhSXLA |title=UNDILAH – English (Namewee Afdlin Shauki Kuli Pete Teo) |publisher=YouTube |date=14 September 2011 |access-date=30 April 2013}}</ref> encouraging Malaysian citizens to vote, was released by Pete Teo. Namewee composed part of the music and rap lyrics as well as appearing in the video, featuring various other local celebrities and politicians.

He starred in ''[[Petaling Street Warriors]]'', which was released in December 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://my.news.yahoo.com/petaling-street-warriors-full-trailer-lands-093100179.html|title=Petaling Street Warriors" Full Trailer Lands|access-date=12 November 2011|date=24 October 2011|work=[[Yahoo! News]]}}</ref>

After the success of ''Nasi Lemak 2.0'' and ''Petaling Street Warriors'', Namewee started off with his another directorial work, ''[[Hantu Gangster]]''. The film was filmed in [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]] and was released on 9 August 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.com.my/movies/movie_contents.aspx?search=2012.7981.hantugangster.14864 |title=Hantu Gangster |publisher=cinema.com.my |access-date=30 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/12/20/nation/10130042&sec=nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220013714/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F12%2F20%2Fnation%2F10130042&sec=nation|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 December 2011|title=Rapper-director Namewee goes on a gangster haunt|access-date=13 January 2012|date=20 December 2011|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Namewee uploaded a video about [[Lynas]],  and talked about Australian and Kangaroo in the video,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLn3BLWw9B8|title=Namewee Fuck Lynas - Good day to die 美好的一天-黃明志|date=28 February 2012|access-date=15 February 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> on 28 February 2012.

On 25 September 2012, he officially launched an online talk show entitled ''Namewee Tokok'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoUVf_-SQQw|title=[Namewee Tokok] 001 First Show! 開張大吉! 26-09-2012|date=25 September 2012|access-date=15 February 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> hoping through this program, the Malaysian could have a different perspective on viewing various issues and news in Malaysia as the mass media of the country was consolidated by the government.

In 2014, Namewee established [[RED People]], a group of Internet personnel, and was also involved in composing [[Joyce Chu]]'s song ''Malaysia Chabor''.

On 22 April 2017, Namewee uploaded a song on YouTube named "18X PAPAPA" (Chinese: 18X禁歌啪啪啪),<ref>{{Citation|last=Namewee|title=Namewee黃明志18X禁歌【啪啪啪 PAPAPA 】- 蔡阿嘎&雪碧特別演出 @亞洲通吃2018專輯 All Eat Asia|date=2017-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7QDuuAS82M|access-date=2018-09-30}}</ref> reaching more than 8 million views in 2 months and becoming the 2nd most popular song to the group of 7–12 years old students according to research. Namewee's fans commented that although the song was only for 18+, they enjoyed it and kept replaying the song.

To remember the 10th anniversary on 20 May 2017 since he started uploading his songs on YouTube, Namewee released a music video titled ''Muar Mandarin 2017 Official MV'' (Chinese: 麻坡的華語10週年紀念版), featuring various places including the Wetex, 8th avenue, etc., in his birthplace [[Muar (town)|Muar]], a city in Johor, Malaysia. It was an instant hit, reaching more than one million views on YouTube in one month.

In July 2020, Namewee debuted a music video of his song "Five Hundred" (五百), which is a rock song made in the style of and a tribute to Taiwanese [[Wu Bai]] (伍佰) and his band China Blue. While Wu Bai does not appear in the video, a group of impersonators portray him and the band China Blue.

In October 2021, Namewee's "[[Fragile (Namewee song)|Fragile]]" (Chinese:玻璃心), collaborated with Taiwan-based Australian singer [[Kimberley Chen]], garnered over 10 million YouTube views in six days since upload. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Breaking online Chinese nationalist hearts, 'Fragile' goes viral in Taiwan, HK - Focus Taiwan|url=https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202110210004|access-date=2021-10-21|website=focustaiwan.tw|language=zh-Hant-TW}}</ref>  The singers were banned from Mainland China as a result of the song. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Backhouse|first=Andrew|date=2021-10-19|title='Insulting': Singers instantly banned in China|work=news.com.au — Australia's leading news site|url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/insulting-aussie-singer-banned-in-china-after-releasing-controversial-song/news-story/39d9b47e760dd52227e46630f09598af|access-date=2021-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title='Fragile' song pillorying China's online troll army gets millions of views|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/trolls-fragile-10212021125002.html|access-date=2021-10-21|website=Radio Free Asia|language=en}}</ref>
