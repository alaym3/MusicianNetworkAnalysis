'''Coin''' (often stylized as '''COIN''') is an American [[pop rock]] band formed in 2012 in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. It currently consists of Chase Lawrence (lead vocals, synthesizers), Ryan Winnen (drums), and Joe Memmel (lead guitar, backing vocals).

The band originally released two [[extended play|EPs]] in 2012 (''Saturdays'') and 2013 (''1992''). They subsequently gained mainstream attention in 2015 with the lead single "Run" from their self-titled debut album, which was produced by [[Jay Joyce]] and released later the same year by [[Columbia Records|Columbia]].

The group gained further success in 2016 with the lead single "[[Talk Too Much]]" from the band's second studio album, ''How Will You Know If You Never Try'', which was released on April 21, 2017. The song was their first to chart on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Alternative Songs]] chart.<ref name="bbalt">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/6598433/coin/chart?f=377|title=COIN Album & Song Chart History – Alternative Songs|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=January 4, 2017}}</ref>

== History ==

=== 2012&ndash;2014: Early years ===
Coin was formed in 2012 by Chase Lawrence, Ryan Winnen, Joe Memmel, and Zach Dyke. Lawrence, Memmel and Dyke were students at [[Belmont University]]. Lawrence and Memmel were classmates who often sat next to each other in music theory classes.<ref>{{cite web |title=INTERVIEW: COIN Talks Touring, Relationships, and Seizing the Day / Ones To Watch |url=https://www.onestowatch.com/blog/interview-coin-talks-touring-relationships-and |website=Ones To Watch |access-date=18 December 2020}}</ref> After they decided to try writing music together, Winnen and Dyke were introduced to them through mutual friends. The band then decided that they needed recorded music in order for promoters to book them to play live, so they recorded four songs at their school and released them for free on the internet. When they started playing local shows around Nashville, the band quickly attracted a highly enthusiastic and loyal live following. Prior to the release of their debut album, they released two EPs: ''Saturdays'' in late 2012, and ''1992'' in 2013. The song "Atlas" was released as a single in August 2013 from the EP ''1992''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/discovery/listen-coin-atlas-134284|title=Listen: COIN – Atlas|work=The Line of Best Fit|access-date=March 31, 2017}}</ref> "Time Machine" was released as a non-album single in October 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/fJmxNMq2XJ/|title=Instagram post by COIN • Oct 7, 2013 at 2:52am UTC|website=Instagram|access-date=March 31, 2017}}</ref> Both "Atlas" and "Time Machine" were later re-recorded and put on the band's debut album. In March 2014, the band released a re-recorded version of their song, "It's Okay," as a non-album single.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nocountryfornewnashville.com/2014/03/04/coin-debut-new-single-its-okay/|title=Coin Debut New Single, "It's Okay" {{!}} No Country For New Nashville|date=March 4, 2014|access-date=March 31, 2017}}</ref>

=== 2015: ''Coin'' ===
The group released their single, "Run," in early 2015 and were hailed by ''Billboard'' as "new wave crash-course survivors," destined to "break the Nashville mold."<ref name="billboard1" /> The song received positive reviews, as well as heavy airplay on [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius]]' [[Alt Nation]] radio station.
