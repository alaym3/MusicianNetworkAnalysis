She is a great-granddaughter of [[Conrad Hilton]], the founder of [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts|Hilton Hotels]]. Born in New York City, and raised there and in [[Beverly Hills, California]], Hilton first attracted [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] attention in the late 1990s, when she became a fixture in NYC's late-night scene. She ventured into modeling at age 19, signing with [[Donald Trump]]'s agency [[Trump Model Management]]. After [[David LaChapelle]] photographed her and her sister [[Nicky Hilton|Nicky]] for the September 2000 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Hilton was proclaimed "New York's leading [[It Girl]]" in 2001.<ref name="biography.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/paris-hilton-11271420?page=1|title=Paris Hilton Biography|publisher=Biography.com|access-date=August 10, 2012}}</ref> In 2003, a leaked 2001 [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] with her then-boyfriend [[Rick Salomon]], later released as ''[[1 Night in Paris]]'', catapulted her into global fame, and the reality television series ''[[The Simple Life]]'', in which she starred with her friend and socialite counterpart [[Nicole Richie]], started its five-year run on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], reaching 13 million viewers.

Hilton published her debut book, ''[[Confessions of an Heiress]]'' (2004), which became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]], landed her first major film role in the horror remake ''[[House of Wax (2005 film)|House of Wax]]'' (2005) and released her self-titled debut studio album, ''[[Paris (Paris Hilton album)|Paris]]'' (2006), which reached number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and respectively produced the successful single "[[Stars Are Blind]]". Her other reality television ventures include [[MTV]]'s [[Paris Hilton's My New BFF|''Paris Hilton's My New BFF'' franchise]] (2008–2011), [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]]'s  ''[[The World According to Paris]]'' (2011), [[Viceland]]'s ''[[Hollywood Love Story]]'' (2018), and  [[Netflix]]'s ''[[Cooking With Paris]]'' (2021). She has played small roles in Hollywood films and television series, produced several of her own projects, and recorded a line of standalone singles. She was also the subject of the documentaries ''[[Paris, Not France]]'' (2008), ''[[The American Meme]]'' (2018) and ''[[This Is Paris]]'' (2020). In 2012, Hilton made her debut as a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at Brazil's Pop Music Festival. She held a  residence at the [[Amnesia (nightclub)|Amnesia nightclub]] in [[Ibiza]] between 2013 and 2017, was the highest-paid female DJ in 2014,<ref name="time.com">{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4964680/dj-paris-hilton-ibiza/|title=Here's What Happened When We Went Clubbing with DJ Paris Hilton|magazine=Time}}</ref> and has performed at various festivals, such as [[Summerfest]] and [[Tomorrowland]].

A polarizing and often derided [[celebrity]], Hilton is credited with influencing the revival of the [[famous for being famous]] phenomenon throughout the 2000s,<ref name="phfame">{{cite web|url=http://www.scoreboard-media.com/paris-hilton-rule/ |title=The Paris Hilton Rule: Famous For Being Famous |work=Scoreboard Media Group |access-date=September 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528065137/http://www.scoreboard-media.com/paris-hilton-rule/ |archive-date=May 28, 2012 }}</ref> and was, for a number of years, one of the world's most ubiquitous public figures. She appeared in the 2007 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the Most Overrated Celebrity, while ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked her as the Most Overexposed Celebrity in 2006 and 2008. Critics indeed suggest that she exemplifies the [[celebutante]]—a household name not through talent or work, but through inherited wealth and lavish lifestyle. Hilton has parlayed her media fame into an eponymous brand, which includes 19 product lines, 45 boutiques worldwide, and an [[Azure Beach Club Paris Hilton|urban condominium development]] in [[Manila]], Philippines.

Hilton moved frequently in her youth, living in [[Beverly Hills]], [[the Hamptons]], and a suite in the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in [[Manhattan]]. Her relatives have described her as "very much a [[tomboy]]" who dreamed about becoming a veterinarian. According to her mother, she would save up her money to buy monkeys, snakes, and goats, and once recalled a particular incident in which a young Paris left "the snake out the cage [...] at the Waldorf".<ref name="thisisp">[https://youtube.com/wOg0TY1jG3w]{{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref> Hilton was raised in a very "sheltered, conservative" atmosphere; her parents were particularly strict and she was not allowed to date, wear make-up or certain types of clothes, or go to school dances. Her mother enrolled her in [[etiquette]] classes with the idea of involving her in the socialite scene, a world Hilton was at first reluctant to be a part of, as she did not find it to be "real" or "natural". She indeed described it as "very proper, very prim, almost like a ''Stepford wife''".<ref name="thisisp" /> The family's social circle included figures such as [[Lionel Richie]], [[Donald Trump]] and [[Michael Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/are-nicole-richie-and-paris-still-friends-142801|title=Are Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton Still Friends?

Amid a rebellious youth, Hilton's parents sent her, then 16, to a series of boarding schools for emotionally troubled teens, the last of which was [[Provo Canyon School]], where she says that she was mentally and physically abused by the staff. In her documentary ''This Is Paris'', Hilton and other former students from Provo Canyon School recall the abuses they faced, including solitary confinement, forced medication, and being restrained, hit and strangled. She attended Provo for 11 months and was released in 1999 when she turned 18.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Paris Hilton says she was abused while at Utah facility for 'troubled teens'|url=https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/08/22/paris-hilton-says-she-was/|access-date=August 24, 2020|website=The Salt Lake Tribune|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Roberto|first=Melissa|date=August 22, 2020|title=Paris Hilton details alleged abuse at Utah boarding school for the first time: 'Continuous torture'|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/paris-hilton-details-alleged-abuse-utah-boarding-school-continuous-torture|access-date=August 24, 2020|website=Fox News|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="Chicago Flame">{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagoflame.com/2.9141/the-real-news-1.1299436 |title=The Real News&nbsp;– Paris Hilton: I need a disguise |work=[[Chicago Flame]] |date=December 7, 2003 |access-date=April 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708143717/http://www.chicagoflame.com/2.9141/the-real-news-1.1299436 |archive-date=July 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Thiandian News">{{cite news|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/paris-hiltons-teen-lover-threatens-to-expose-their-love-letters_1005218.html|title=Paris Hilton's teen lover threatens to expose their love letters|work=Thiandian News|date=November 15, 2007|access-date=April 2, 2011}}</ref> She then attended the [[Dwight School]] before dropping out a few months later.

==Career==
===Social scene and modeling (1996–2002)===
Hilton originally modeled as a child at charity events.<ref name="porter"/> After relocating to NYC in 1996, she made a debut as a [[socialite]] and started frequenting nightclubs and high-profile events. As Hilton was [[Minor (law)|underage]] at the time, she obtained a counterfeited [[identity document]] in order to gain access to events. She was seen at places such as The Plumm, Moomba, and the ballroom at the Waldorf. Her antics and late-night persona soon started attracting the spotlight from local tabloids. After becoming familiar with Paris and Nicky's social circle, Jason Binn, publisher of ''Hamptons'' magazine, said: "They're little stars. They've become names. To them it's like a job. I believe they wake up every morning and say, 'O.K., where am I supposed to be tonight?'."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2000/09/hiltons200009|title=Hip-Hop Debs! A Night (and Afternoon) with Paris and Nicky Hilton|first=Nancy Jo|last=Sales|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=September 2000}}</ref>

Hilton has recalled getting offers to show up in nightclubs for promotion as early as she was 16, which she saw as an initial route to earn income on her own.<ref name="pa">{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/paris-hilton-explains-how-she-was-paid-to-party-before-turning-21|title=Paris Hilton explains how she was paid to party before turning 21|first=Stephanie|last=Nolasco|website=[[Fox News]]|date=November 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/nicky-hilton-paris-hilton-designer-lloyd-klein-and-maria-news-photo/1513596|title=Nicky Hilton, Paris Hilton, designer Lloyd Klein, and Maria Scheider...|website=Getty Images}}</ref><ref name="gq">{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/how-celebs-get-paid-for-club-appearances|title=How Celebs Make Big Bucks for Doing … Nothing|first=Carrie|last=Battan|date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> This was, however, met with much disdain from Richard and Kathy Hilton, who sent her to a series of "emotional growth" schools until she turned 18. She resumed public appearances shortly after being released. A ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile, published in October 1999, states: "At sixteen and eighteen, Nicky and Paris Hilton are the littlest socialites in town. Thin, blond, and wellborn—their great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton—they moved from L.A. with their parents three years ago, and are now out and about with the city's most entitled teens. Like Eloise, whose story the two say they read "like, a hundred years ago," they live in a hotel, the Waldorf [...] Without even a smile, they can breeze past the velvet ropes at Moomba or get a seat at Le Bilboquet".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/10/18/next-generation-l-the-hilton-sisters|title=Next Generation l The Hilton Sisters|first=Bob|last=Morris|magazine=The New Yorker|date=October 10, 1999}}</ref>

Inspired by designers [[Patricia Field]] and [[Betsy Johnson]], Hilton soon decided to pursue modeling, signing with [[Donald Trump]]'s agency, T Management, at age 19.<ref name="porter"/> Hilton modeled for [[Catherine Malandrino]] and [[Marc Bouwer]], and posed alongside her sister Nicky for [[David LaChapelle]]<ref name="vice">{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/53nvp3/paris-hilton-profile-2015-19-fragrances-and-counting-heiress|title=This Is How Paris Hilton Fooled the Entire United States of America|date=December 9, 2015}}</ref> in a shoot that was featured in the September 2000 issue of ''Vanity Fair''. On her persona, LaChapelle stated: "Paris had a charisma back then that you couldn't take your eyes off. She would giggle and laugh and be effervescent and take up a room".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/21/david-lachapelle-photographer-hawaii-warhol|title=David LaChapelle: 'I never wanted to shoot another pop star—I was tortured by them'|first=Nosheen|last=Iqbal|date=November 21, 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> By 2001, Hilton had become "one of the biggest stars, off and on the catwalk," at [[New York Fashion Week]], graced an advertising campaign for&nbsp;Italian label [[Iceberg (fashion house)|Iceberg]], and appeared on magazines such as ''Vogue'' and ''[[FHM]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Paris_Hilton|title=Paris Hilton – Fashion Model|publisher=Fashionmodeldirectory.com |access-date=January 30, 2013}}</ref> In addition to modeling, Hilton ventured into screen acting, playing an ill-fated character in the independent teen thriller ''Sweetie Pie'' (2000),<ref name="vf" /> and filming a cameo appearance as herself in the comedy ''[[Zoolander]]'' (2001), with [[Ben Stiller]].

===International stardom (2003–2007)===
Hilton's breakout came in 2003, when she starred with her socialite counterpart [[Nicole Richie]] in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] reality series ''[[The Simple Life]]'', in which they lived for a month with a family in the rural community of [[Altus, Arkansas]].

===Persona===
[[File:Paris Hilton at Sundance Film Festival 2008.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hilton at the 2008 [[Sundance Film Festival]]]] 
The unusual nature and extent of her fame is often questioned by critics, as she is not considered an entertainer nor performer. Blair Soden of ''[[ABC News]]'' noted: "She's made a lot of money with a hodgepodge of traditional celebrity revenue. But what she's best at is being Paris Hilton".<ref>{{cite web|first=Blair|last=Soden|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=3270428&page=1|title=Who Will Be the Next Paris Hilton?|date=June 13, 2007|website=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> Writers indeed suggest that Hilton epitomizes the ''[[celebutante]]'': a celebrity for no particularly identifiable reason other than inherited wealth and lavish lifestyle. Cait Munro of ''[[Refinery29]]'' asserted: "Paris Hilton is an icon not just of the 2000s, but of a certain widely held image of what inherited wealth, undeserved fame, and American excess looks like".<ref name="mag29">{{cite web|first=Cait|last=Munro|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/heiress-self-made-paris-hilton-200000651.html|title=Can An Heiress Be Self-Made?

Much of her image has centered on her "party girl-heiress archetype" as well as her blonde hair and the stereotypes associated with it, especially stupidity, naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality.<ref>{{cite web|first=Laura|last=Lavlin|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/42648/1/paris-hilton-the-american-meme-existential-dread|title=Paris Hilton grapples with the futility of life in The American Meme|website=Dazed|date=December 19, 2018}}</ref> The development of that character stemmed from the initial success of ''The Simple Life'' and her desire to embody "the ultimate brand based on [...] the right everything for a formula that far exceeded anybody else at that time", according to Jason Moore, her former manager.<ref name="cnnph">{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2011/11/02/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/jason-moore-on-paris-hilton/index.html|title=The man who 'made' Paris Hilton|first=Abbey|last=Goodman|website=[[CNN]]|date=November 2, 2011}}</ref> He stated: "She was the ultimate package that corporate America would want to make for itself as a marketing tool, but it was already made for them. They say to be a famous person, people want to be you or [sleep with you], and she encompassed both of those".<ref name="cnnph" />

Fashion and language are two contributing factors to Hilton's star image. Known for her long bleached blonde hair, [[valley girl]] accent, and use of blue coloured contact lenses over her naturally brown eyes, she developed her personal aesthetic through mainly [[pink]] attire, [[Juicy Couture]] tracksuits, rhinestones, trucker hats, oversized sunglasses, and the "accessory dog". She mimed "high-fashion poses learned from [[drag queens]]" and created what was described as the "Paris talk". For instance, she often uses one-liners and a breathy, childish voice in television shows and interviews.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Rachel|last=McRady|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/paris-hilton-reveals-the-origin-of-her-baby-voice-w159305/|title=Paris Hilton Reveals the Origin of Her Baby Voice!|magazine=[[US Weekly]]|date=December 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Eun Kyung|last=Kim|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/paris-hilton-her-voice-fragrance-line-how-reality-tv-has-t102840|title=What 'Simple Life' fans never knew about Paris Hilton: That's not her voice|website=TODAY.com|date=September 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/08/popandrock|title=Simon Hattenstone meets Paris Hilton|first=Simon|last=Hattenstone|date=July 7, 2006|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

Her dim-witted blonde persona, despite being a carefully crafted act, has found significant credence among the general public, which she has described as being an obstacle in her career. She once remarked: "People assume before they meet me that I'm a really ditzy dumb blonde. That's the one thing that kind of annoys me sometimes. They just think because of the reality show that's who I really am. But that was just a character that I created. I didn't realize what a huge success [it would be...] With everything that's happening, though, with my business, I think people can understand that you couldn't possibly get this far being a dumb blonde".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/paris-hilton-on-being-recognized-as-a-ditzy-dumb-blonde-it-annoys-me|title=Paris Hilton on being recognized as a 'ditzy dumb blonde': 'It annoys me'|first=Stephanie|last=Nolasco|date=July 17, 2017|website=[[Fox News]]}}</ref>

===Catchphrases===
"'''That's hot'''", "'''loves it'''" and "'''sliving'''" are Hilton's catchphrases.<ref name="hot n not">{{cite book |first=Katarina |last=Rasulić |year=2015 |chapter=What's Hot and What's Not in English and Serbian |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PyADQAAQBAJ&q=%22Paris+Hilton%22+%22that%27s+hot%22+signature&pg=PA290 |title=The Linguistics of Temperature |editor=Maria Koptjevskaja-Tamm |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |location=[[Amsterdam]], Netherlands |page=290 |issn=0167-7373 |isbn=978-90-272-0688-6 |lccn=2014035097 }}</ref> All three are registered as trademarks for products, like clothing apparel, electronic devices, and alcoholic beverages.<ref name="hot n not"/>

On September 6, 2007, Hilton filed an [[injunction]] lawsuit against [[Hallmark Cards]] Inc., titled ''Hilton v. Hallmark Cards'', in [[U.S. District Court]] over the unlawful use of her picture and catchphrase "That's hot" on a greeting card. The card is titled "Paris's First Day as a Waitress" with a photograph of Hilton's face on a cartoon of a waitress serving a plate of food, with a dialogue bubble saying "Don't touch that, it's hot" (which had a [[registered trademark]] on February 13, 2007). Hilton's attorney Brent Blakely said that the [[Copyright infringement|infringement]] damages would be based on profits from the greeting cards. Julie O'Dell said that Hallmark used the card as [[parody]], protected under [[fair use]] law.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/paris-hilton-sues-over-hallmark-card | title=Paris Hilton Sues Over Hallmark Card | work=The Smoking Gun | date=September 7, 2007 | access-date=December 12, 2008}}</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] reviewed the case and "denied Hallmark's motion to dismiss".

===Media presence===
A subject of press and tabloid attention due to her extravagant Hollywood lifestyle, Hilton's media exploits started in the late 1990s, when she became a notable fixture in NYC's late-night circuit.<ref name="vice" /> Publications such as ''Hamptons'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[The New York Post]]'' initially featured her in their columns. According to ''Vice'', ''Page Six'' went from writing about her nine times between 1999 and 2000 to publishing 17 stories about her in 2001.<ref name="vice" /> "The most outrageous [New York City-based heiress] is hotel-darling Paris Hilton, 19, a part-time model with a tendency to flash her thong", Michelle Gotthelf wrote in the ''Post'' on October 15, 2000.<ref name="vice" /> The September 2000 article and pictorial by David LaChapelle for ''Vanity Fair'' "announced [Hilton's] arrival" to the mass public, as per ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. By 2001, she was hailed as "New York's leading It Girl", whose fame was beginning to "extend beyond the New York tabloids".<ref name="porter">{{Cite news|last=Porter|first=Charlie|title=New York style: 'Is this article going to trash me?': Heiress, star of the social columns and now a top model..

The scandal involving her sex tape in 2003 catapulted her into global fame and made her an overnight subject of media frenzy, [[paparazzi]] attention and public scrutiny. The ''NY Post'', for instance, went on to write more than 90 articles about Hilton that year alone. The public's sudden and unusual interest on her life led ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' to write that, "[w]e in the media have become Paris-ites".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2003/12/04/simple-life/|title=The Simple Life|website=EW.com}}</ref> In an effort to “rehabilite her public image” and “capitalise” on the increased curiosity following the release of her sex tape, she heavily promoted herself through different forms of [[mass media]] such as advertising, publishing and broadcasting.<ref name="cnnph" /> The 2000s are widely agreed to be her heyday,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marieclaire.com.au/paris-hilton-blonde-brunette-bronde-hair|title=Paris Hilton has swapped her blonde hair for brown|website=Marie Claire}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instyle.com/news/paris-hilton-kendall-jenner-gigi-hadid-style|title=Paris Hilton Takes Credit for the Sartorial Choices of Today's It Girls|website=InStyle.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/02/140334/paris-hilton-fashion-week-show-caitlyn-jenner|title=Caitlyn Jenner & Paris Hilton Were The Unlikely Stars Of This Fashion Show|first=Landon|last=Peoples|website=www.refinery29.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/paris-hilton-dressed-up-as-kim-kardashian-for-yeezy-season-6.html|title=Paris Hilton Is a Kim Kardashian West Clone and So Are We|first=Emilia|last=Petrarca|date=January 31, 2018|website=The Cut}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a21282422/paris-hilton-on-the-noughties-trend-she-wouldnt-bring-back/|title=Paris Hilton reveals the noughties trend she wouldn't bring back|first=Jessica|last=Davis|date=June 12, 2018|website=Harper's BAZAAR}}</ref> a period in which her presence was, as ''CNN'' once noted, "impossible to escape" and a "staple of the daily news cycles". Throughout the decade, Hilton's media ubiquity fed the then-booming online gossip industry, and cemented her "[[It Girl]]" status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elle.com.au/fashion/paris-hilton-fashion-2000-17652|title=25 Iconic Paris Hilton Fashion Moments You Forgot You Were Obsessed With|first=Natasha|last=Harding|website=ELLE}}</ref>

The "intrusive" presence of paparazzi helped the emerging network of blogs and magazines, such as ''[[TMZ]]'', ''[[US Weekly]]'' and [[PerezHilton.com]], to extensively document Hilton’s exploits. Aware that "anything [she] did was going to be talked about the next day", she would particularly plan public occurrences, described as "pseudo-events", usually for the purpose of being photographed and reported on. This proved to be a symbiotic strategy, from which both Hilton and the press benefited. Sheeraz Hasan, the founder of ''Hollywood.TV'', stated: "I built the foundation of one of the biggest paparazzi companies in the world on the back of Paris Hilton. I had over 100 guys in Los Angeles [...] all of them making a living off" Hilton.<ref>[https://YouTube.com/AuriVlNxx5U] {{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref> ''TMZ'' has been criticized for having a [[personality cult]] of figures such as Hilton,<ref name="tmzmj3"/> but [[Harvey Levin]], the managing editor of ''TMZ'', attributed their coverage on Paris to her "relevancy" and how it helped draw a high viewership to the website.<ref name="tmzmj3">{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/tmzlive?autoplay=true&mediaKey=6b2ea4bc-5d5b-4f38-8189-f28499088e2b|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129120432/http://www.tmz.com/tmzlive?autoplay=true&mediaKey=6b2ea4bc-5d5b-4f38-8189-f28499088e2b|archive-date=November 29, 2009|website=TMZ.com|title=TMZ Live - 11/25/09 Part 3|date=November 25, 2009|access-date=November 25, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Perez Hilton purports to have befriended Hilton, who became the source of his stage name and frequent subject of his posts.

==Cultural impact==
In a 2011 article, ''CNN'' alluded that Hilton had transformed fame "more than any other modern-day star",<ref name="cnnph"/> in reference to her influence on the revival of the [[famous for being famous]] phenomenon, and leadership in the insurgency of a new type of celebrity, whose private life became an unprecedented focus of public interest.<ref name="phfame" /> By molding what academic [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] called "an image", which "is not simply a trademark, a design, a slogan or an easily remembered picture", but "a studiously crafted personality profile of an individual, institution, corporation, product or service", she has been credited with shaping the professional foundation for this kind of celebrity, which intensified with the posterior growth of social media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/paris-hilton-interview|title=Paris Hilton Invented Everything You're Doing in 2017, and She Knows It|first=Mayan Toledano, Emilia|last=Petrarca|website=W Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com.sg/life/paris-hiltons-most-memorable-moments/|title=We Bet That You Forgot Paris Hilton Once Did All These Things|first=Syed Zulfadhli 17|last=February 2017|date=February 17, 2017|website=Harper's Bazaar Singapore}}</ref>

In 2020, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' regarded Hilton as "the woman who will likely go down in history for putting the 'i' in influencer".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2019-12-05/paris-hilton-hollywood-influencer-dj-simple-life-star-tabloids|title=Paris Hilton, Hollywood's original influencer: 'I just want people to know the real me'|date=December 5, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> ''GQ'' had previously called her "the figure who set off Hollywood 2.0's Big Bang, the effects of which continue to radiate through the industry today.

Between 2008 and 2009, Hilton's home was burgled several times by the [[Bling Ring]], a group of fashion-motivated thieves.

===Relationships===
Hilton's extensive list of relationships and romantic associations with other high-profile figures has drawn a large amount of media attention and public disapproval.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://galoremag.com/paris-hiltons-dating-history/|title=A Complete Timeline of Paris Hilton's Dating History|date=June 30, 2016|website=Galore}}</ref> In 2000, for instance, the then-19-year-old drew attention from tabloids when she and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] were seen together on the NYC late-night circuit.

===Sex tape===
In 2003, a [[celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] featuring Hilton and then-boyfriend Rick Salomon was leaked onto the Internet shortly after the debut of her mainstream TV series ''[[The Simple Life]]''. Salomon filed a lawsuit against the company that distributed the tape, and against the Hilton family, whom he accused of tarnishing his reputation by suggesting that he had exploited Hilton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,544778,00.html|title=Shame Game |last=Hiatt|first=Brian |date=November 18, 2003|publisher=ew.com|access-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> Hilton later sued the company that released the tape, Kahatani Ltd., for $30 million for violation of privacy and emotional distress.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/02/09/paris.lawsuit.reut/|title=Paris Hilton sues over Internet sex tape|date=February 9, 2004|publisher=cnn.com|access-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref>

Under the title ''[[1 Night in Paris]]'', Salomon began distributing the tape himself in April 2004 through the adult film company [[Red Light District Video]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,630669,00.html|title=X-Rated Paris Tape Goes to Home Video|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|date=April 30, 2004|publisher=people.com|access-date=December 7, 2008|archive-date=January 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123024124/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,630669,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> In July 2004, Salomon dropped his lawsuit against the Hilton family after Paris Hilton's privacy lawsuit was thrown out of court.

In October 2010, James Rainford bicycled past guards at the entrance to her gated community, went to her house, and began pounding on her door. He was arrested and earned three years' probation, along with a restraining order from Hilton. In April 2011, Rainford was arrested a second time for attacking her boyfriend Cy Waits outside Van Nuys Superior Court, where Hilton was headed to testify against Nathan Lee Parada, and he was arrested again in July outside her [[Malibu, California]] beach house.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paris-hiltons-accused-stalker-to-stand-trial/|title=Paris Hilton's accused stalker to stand trial|website=www.cbsnews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/07/paris-hilton-stalker-intruder-james-rainford-cy-waits.html|title=Paris Hilton stalker James Rainford arrested again, outside her Malibu home|date=July 5, 2011}}</ref> He was charged with two felony stalking counts and three misdemeanor counts of disobeying a court order,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-is-charged-with-stalking-paris-hilton/|title=Man is charged with stalking Paris Hilton|website=www.cbsnews.com}}</ref> but a judge found him to be "mentally incompetent to stand trial" and he was sent to a state mental hospital.

In 2014, an "obsessed fan" flew a plane over Malibu with two banners, one of which read, "Can't Get Paris Whitney Hilton Out of My Mind." The other read, "Mr. & Mrs. Hilton, may I court your daughter Paris?" In 2015, the same person reportedly posed as a flower deliveryman to gain access to her gated community, where he left her a classic [[Cadillac]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2015/02/26/paris-hilton-stalker-new-car-obsessed-fan-bought-cadillac-gift/|title=Paris Hilton -- Obsessed Fan Gets Crazy with Classic Caddy|website=TMZ}}</ref>

In October 2014, Lukas Redanz was completely covered with tattoos of Hilton, and he appeared to be "extremely drunk" when he went to her gated community to see her.

Between 2015 and 2017, Hilton was the target of an identity theft scheme by Paytsar Bkhchadzhyan, a woman who used Hilton's credit cards to book a party at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] worth around $53,000. She also pretended to be Hilton in emails to her employees, convincing them to transfer $106,000 to her account, and hacked her sister Nicky and father Rick Hilton in an attempt to gain passwords to various other accounts.
