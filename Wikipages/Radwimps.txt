== Musicianship ==

Lead vocalist Yojiro Noda writes all of the band's music and lyrics (the only exception currently is the bonus track "Yonaki" from ''Radwimps 4'', written by Akira Kuwahara). Almost all of Noda's lyrics are based on events he experienced, or non-fictional events.<ref name="NeowingInterview"/> "Enren" from ''Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan'', released in 2006, was the first time Noda has written a fictional song since the band formed.<ref name="AmazonInterview">{{cite web | title=Deep Dive - Radwimps | url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/feature.html?docId=1000014546 | work=Amazon |language=ja | year=2006 | access-date=February 9, 2011}}</ref> He personally finds lyric writing a chore, as while he writes lyrics, he constantly questions each phrase, asking if that was exactly what he wanted to say.<ref name="NeowingInterview"/>
