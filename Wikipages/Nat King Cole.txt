===Early career===

When he was 15, Cole dropped out of high school to pursue a music career. After his brother Eddie, a bassist, came home from touring with [[Noble Sissle]], they formed a sextet and recorded two singles for [[Decca Records|Decca]] in 1936 as Eddie Cole's Swingsters. They performed in a revival of the musical ''[[Shuffle Along]]''. Nat Cole went on tour with the musical. In 1937, he married Nadine Robinson, who was a member of the cast. After the show ended in Los Angeles, Cole and Nadine settled there while he looked for work. He led a big band, then found work playing piano in nightclubs. When a club owner asked him to form a band, he hired bassist [[Wesley Prince]] and guitarist [[Oscar Moore]]. They called themselves the King Cole Swingsters after the nursery rhyme in which "[[Old King Cole|Old King Cole was a merry old soul]]". They changed their name to the King Cole Trio before making [[transcription disc|radio transcription]]s and recording for small labels.<ref name="Ruhlmann">{{cite web|last1=Ruhlmann|first1=William|title=Nat King Cole| url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nat-king-cole-mn0000317093/biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=February 22, 2018}}</ref>

Cole recorded "[[Sweet Lorraine]]" in 1940, and it became his first hit.<ref name="Yanow Swing">{{cite book|last1=Yanow|first1=Scott|title=Swing|date=2000|publisher=Miller Freeman|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87930-600-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/swing00yano/page/203 203]|url=https://archive.org/details/swing00yano/page/203}}</ref> According to legend, his career as a vocalist started when a drunken bar patron demanded that he sing the song. Cole said that this fabricated story sounded good, so he didn't argue with it. In fact, there was a customer one night who demanded that he sing, but because it was a song Cole didn't know, he sang "Sweet Lorraine" instead. As people heard Cole's vocal talent, they requested more vocal songs, and he obliged.<ref name="Intimate">{{cite book|last1=Cole| first1=Maria| title=Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/natkingcoleintim00cole|url-access=registration|date=September 1971|publisher= William Morrow|isbn=978-0688021535}}</ref>

===1940s===
In 1941, the trio recorded "That Ain't Right" for Decca, followed the next year by "All for You" for [[Excelsior Records|Excelsior]].<ref name="Ruhlmann" /> They also recorded "[[I'm Lost]]", a song written by [[Otis René]], the owner of Excelsior.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170315223539/https://books.google.com/books?id=jRgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT85&lpg=PT85&dq=%22Excelsior+Records%22+Rene&source=bl&ots=WGb7s0l1Un&sig=4d9p5VXP5s9T0nsJFji0eYTXagY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FyZHT9rsHIHh0QHww_WCDg&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA "Buck-Five Disk of Indies Seen Different Ways"].

Cole began recording and performing pop-oriented material in which he was often accompanied by a [[string orchestra]]. His stature as a popular star was cemented by hits such as "All for You" (1943), "[[The Christmas Song]]" (1947),<ref>Cole recorded "The Christmas Song" four times&nbsp;— on June 14, 1946, with the Nat King Cole Trio; on August 19, 1946, with an added string section; on August 24, 1953; and in 1961 for the double album ''The Nat King Cole Story''.

Throughout the 1950s, Cole continued to record hits that sold millions throughout the world, such as "[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]", "[[Pretend (1952 song)|Pretend]]", "[[A Blossom Fell]]", and "If I May". His pop hits were collaborations with [[Nelson Riddle]],<ref name=pc22/> [[Gordon Jenkins]], and [[Ralph Carmichael]]. Riddle arranged several of Cole's 1950s albums, including ''Nat King Cole Sings for Two in Love'' (1953), his first 10-inch LP. In 1955, "[[Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup]]" reached number 7 on the ''Billboard'' chart. ''[[Love Is the Thing]]'' went to number one in April 1957 and remained his only number one album.

In 1959, he received a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Song|Best Performance By a "Top 40" Artist]] for "Midnight Flyer".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1959-239.html |title=Grammy Awards 1959 |work=Grammy }}</ref>

[[File:Capitol Records Building LA.jpg|thumb|[[Capitol Records Building]], known as "The House That Nat Built" on [[Vine St.]]]]

In 1958, Cole went to Havana, Cuba, to record ''[[Cole Español]]'', an album sung entirely in Spanish. It was so popular in Latin America and the U.S. that it was followed by two more Spanish-language albums: ''[[A Mis Amigos]]'' (1959) and ''[[More Cole Español]]'' (1962).

After the change in musical tastes, Cole's ballads appealed little to young listeners, despite a successful attempt at rock and roll with "[[Send for Me (song)|Send for Me]]",<ref name=pc22/> which peaked at number 6 on the pop chart. Like [[Dean Martin]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Tony Bennett]], he found that the pop chart had been taken over by youth-oriented acts.

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, Cole's longtime collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol to join [[Reprise Records]], which was established by Frank Sinatra. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album, ''Wild Is Love'', with lyrics by [[Raymond Rasch|Ray Rasch]] and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an [[Off-Broadway]] show, ''I'm with You''.

Nevertheless, Cole recorded several hit singles during the 1960s, including "Let There Be Love" with George Shearing in 1961, the country-flavored hit "[[Ramblin' Rose]]" in August 1962 (reaching # 2 on the Pop chart), "[[Dear Lonely Hearts]]" (#13), "[[That Sunday, That Summer]]" (#12) and "[[Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer (song)|Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer]]"<ref name=pc22/> (his final top-ten hit, reaching number 6 on the Pop chart). He performed in many short films, sitcoms, and television shows and played [[W. C. Handy]] in the film ''[[St. Louis Blues (1958 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'' (1958). He also appeared in ''The Nat King Cole Story'', ''[[China Gate (1957 film)|China Gate]]'', and ''[[The Blue Gardenia]]'' (1953).

In January 1964, Cole made one of his final television appearances, on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''. He was introduced as "the best friend a song ever had" and sang "[[When I Fall in Love]]". ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), his final film, was released several months after his death.

Earlier on, Cole's shift to traditional pop led some jazz critics and fans to accuse him of selling out, but he never abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956 he recorded an all-jazz album, ''[[After Midnight (Nat King Cole album)|After Midnight]]'', and many of his albums after this are fundamentally jazz-based, being scored for big band without strings, although the arrangements focus primarily on the vocal rather than instrumental leads.

Cole had one of his last major hits in 1963, two years before his death, with "[[Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer (song)|Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer]]", which reached number 6 on the Pop chart. "[[Unforgettable (Nat King Cole song)|Unforgettable]]" was made famous again in 1991 by Cole's daughter Natalie when modern recording technology was used to reunite father and daughter in a duet. The duet version rose to the top of the pop charts, almost forty years after its original popularity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Teachout|first1=Terry|title=Nat King Cole|journal=The American Scholar |date=1992|volume=26|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=6f10b1ac-7023-4d70-927f-78a426b5840c%40sessionmgr111&vid=0&hid=120&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=rih&AN=1992-02661|access-date=October 1, 2014}}</ref>

Nat's final studio album was titled, "[[L-O-V-E]]". The album peaked at #4 on the Billboard Albums chart in the spring of 1965.

==Personal life==
Around the time Cole launched his singing career, he entered into [[Freemasonry]]. He was raised in January 1944 in the Thomas Waller Lodge No. 49 in California.

===Marriages and children===

===Experiences with racism===
[[File:natcuba.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Nat King Cole in the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba]]]]
In August 1948, Cole purchased a house from Col. Harry Gantz, the former husband of the silent film actress [[Lois Weber]], in the all-white [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles|Hancock Park]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. The [[Ku Klux Klan]], which was active in Los Angeles in the 1950s, responded by placing a burning cross on his front lawn. Members of the property-owners association told Cole they did not want any "undesirables" moving into the neighborhood. Cole responded, "Neither do I. And if I see anybody undesirable coming in here, I'll be the first to complain."<ref name="Levinson2005">{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=Peter J. |title=September in the Rain: The Life of Nelson Riddle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG-UYr7vBb4C&pg=PA89 |access-date=February 19, 2019 |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor Trade |isbn=978-1-58979-163-3 |pages=89–}}</ref>

In 1956 Cole was contracted to perform in Cuba. He wanted to stay at the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba]] in Havana but was refused because it operated a [[racial segregation|color bar]]. Cole honored his contract, and the concert at the [[Tropicana Club]] was a huge success. During the following year, he returned to Cuba for another concert, singing many songs in Spanish.

In 1956 Cole was assaulted on stage during a concert in Birmingham, Alabama, with the [[Ted Heath (bandleader)|Ted Heath]] Band while singing the song "Little Girl". Having circulated photographs of Cole with white female fans bearing incendiary boldface captions reading "Cole and His White Women" and "Cole and Your Daughter"<ref name="Burford">{{cite journal |last1=Burford |first1=Mark |title=Sam Cooke as Pop Album Artist—A Reinvention in Three Songs |journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=113–178 |doi=10.1525/jams.2012.65.1.113 |date=April 2012|jstor=10.1525/jams.2012.65.1.113 }}</ref> three men belonging to the [[Original Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy|North Alabama Citizens Council]] assaulted Cole, apparently attempting to kidnap him. The three assailants ran down the aisles of the auditorium towards Cole. Local law enforcement quickly ended the invasion of the stage, but in the ensuing mêlée Cole was toppled from his piano bench and injured his back. He did not finish the concert. A fourth member of the group was later arrested. All were tried and convicted.<ref>Eyewitness account published in the ''[[The Birmingham News|Birmingham News]]''. Felts, Jim. Letter to the editor. December 15, 2007.</ref> Cole received a slight back injury during the scuffle. Six men, including 23-year-old Willie Richard Vinson, were formally charged with assault with intent to murder him, but later the charge against four of them was changed to conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor. The original plan to attack Cole included 150 men from Birmingham and nearby towns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/nat-king-cole-attacked-on-stage-archive-1956|title=Nat 'King' Cole attacked on stage – archive, 12 April 1956|date=April 12, 2018}}</ref>

After being attacked in Birmingham, Cole said, "I can't understand it&nbsp;... I have not taken part in any protests. Nor have I joined an organization fighting segregation. Why should they attack me?" Cole said he wanted to forget the incident and continued to play for segregated audiences in the south. He said he could not change the situation in a day. He contributed money to the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] and had sued northern hotels that had hired him but refused to serve him. [[Thurgood Marshall]], the chief legal counsel of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], called him an [[Uncle Tom]] and said he should perform with a banjo. [[Roy Wilkins]], executive secretary of the NAACP, wrote him a telegram that said:
{{blockquote|You have not been a crusader or engaged in an effort to change the customs or laws of the South. That responsibility, newspapers quote you as saying, you leave to the other guys. That attack upon you clearly indicates that organized bigotry makes no distinction between those who do not actively challenge racial discrimination and those who do. This is a fight which none of us can escape. We invite you to join us in a crusade against racism.<ref name="Altschuler2003">{{cite book|last=Altschuler|first=Glenn C. |title=All Shook Up: How Rock 'n' Roll Changed America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMyC2FndXwkC|access-date=February 19, 2019|date=August 7, 2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803191-8}}</ref>}}

''[[The Chicago Defender]]'' said Cole's performances for all-white audiences were an insult to his race. The ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]'' said that "thousands of Harlem blacks who have worshiped at the shrine of singer Nat King Cole turned their backs on him this week as the noted crooner turned his back on the NAACP and said that he will continue to play to [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] audiences". To play "Uncle Nat's" discs, wrote a commentator in ''The American Negro'', "would be supporting his 'traitor' ideas and narrow way of thinking". Deeply hurt by the criticism in the black press, Cole was chastened. Emphasizing his opposition to [[racial segregation]] "in any form", he agreed to join other entertainers in boycotting segregated venues. He paid $500 to become a lifetime member of the Detroit branch of the NAACP. Until his death in 1965, Cole was an active and visible participant in the [[civil rights movement]], playing an important role in planning the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963.<ref name="Gilbert1988">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=James|title=A Cycle of Outrage: America's Reaction to the Juvenile Delinquent in the 1950s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSbMWznYmFAC|date=October 13, 1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536356-2|page=9}}</ref><ref name="Sussman">{{cite book |last1=Sussman |first1=Warren |editor1-last=May |editor1-first=Lary |title=Recasting America |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226511757 |chapter=Did Success Spoil the United States |date=January 9, 1989 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/recastingamerica00gres }}</ref>

===Politics===
Cole performed in 1956 for President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s televised birthday celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-16/news/vw-2610_1_eisenhower-presidency |title=It's All Right to Still Like Ike: History: Once Painted as a 'Distanced' President, Dwight Eisenhower Now is Heralded for his Strong Sense of Service. |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=October 16, 1990 |access-date=January 31, 2016}}</ref> At the [[1956 Republican National Convention]], he sang "[[That's All There Is to That]]" and was "greeted with applause".<ref>Official Report of the Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Republican National Convention, August 20–23, 1956, p. 327.</ref> He was also present at the [[1960 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in 1960 to support Senator [[John F. Kennedy]]. He was among the dozens of entertainers recruited by [[Frank Sinatra]] to perform at the Kennedy Inaugural gala in 1961. Cole consulted with President Kennedy and his successor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], on civil rights.

==Illness and death==
In September 1964, Cole began to lose weight and he experienced back problems.{{sfn|Epstein|1999|p=338}} He collapsed with pain after performing at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel]] in Las Vegas. In December, he was working in San Francisco when he was finally persuaded by friends to seek medical help. A malignant tumor in an advanced state of growth on his left lung was observed on a [[Chest radiograph|chest X-ray]]. Cole, who had been a heavy cigarette smoker, had [[lung cancer]] and was expected to have only months to live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/Famous/g/Famous-Tobacco-Victims-Jazz-Singer-Nat-King-Cole.htm |title=Tobacco Victim Nat King Cole |website=Quitsmoking.about.com |access-date=January 31, 2016}}</ref> Against his doctors' wishes, Cole carried on his work and made his final recordings between December 1 and 3 in San Francisco, with an orchestra conducted by [[Ralph Carmichael]]. The music was released on the album ''[[L-O-V-E (album)|L-O-V-E]]'' shortly before his death.{{sfn|Epstein|1999|p=342}} His daughter noted later that he did this to assure the welfare of his family.

Cole entered [[Saint John's Health Center]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] on December 7, and [[cobalt therapy]] was started on December 10. [[Frank Sinatra]] performed in Cole's place at the grand opening of the new [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] of the [[Los Angeles Music Center]] on December 12.{{sfn|Epstein|1999|p=347}} Cole's condition gradually worsened, but he was released from the hospital over the New Year's period. At home Cole was able to see the hundreds of thousands of cards and letters that had been sent after news of his illness was made public. Cole returned to the hospital in early January. He also sent $5,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5000|1964}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to actress and singer [[Gunilla Hutton]], with whom he had been romantically involved since early 1964.<ref>"Unforgettable", ''The New York Times'', December 26, 1999</ref> Hutton later telephoned Maria and implored her to divorce him. Maria confronted her husband, and Cole finally broke off the relationship with Hutton.{{sfn|Epstein|1999|p=350}} Cole's illness reconciled him with his wife, and he vowed that if he recovered he would go on television to urge people to stop smoking. On January 25, Cole's entire left lung was surgically removed. His father died of heart problems on February 1.{{sfn|Epstein|1999|p=355}} Throughout Cole's illness his publicists promoted the idea that he would soon be well and working, despite the private knowledge of his terminal condition. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine reported that "Nat King Cole has successfully come through a serious operation and... the future looks bright for 'the master' to resume his career again".<ref>{{cite news |title=Blues News |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=migEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22nat+king+cole%22 |access-date=September 17, 2015 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=February 6, 1965 |page=28}}</ref> On Valentine's Day, Cole and his wife briefly left St. John's to drive by the sea. He died at the hospital early in the morning of February 15, 1965.{{sfn|Epstein|1999|p=356}}
[[File:Nat King Cole mausoleum.jpg|right|thumb|Cole's vault at Forest Lawn Memorial Park]]
Cole's funeral was held on February 18 at [[St. James' Episcopal Church (Los Angeles, California)|St.James' Episcopal Church<!--(Los_Angeles_California-->]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] in Los Angeles; 400 people were present, and thousands gathered outside the church. Hundreds of members of the public had filed past the coffin the day before.{{sfn|Epstein|1999|p=358}} Honorary pallbearers included [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Count Basie]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Johnny Mathis]], [[George Burns]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Alan W. Livingston|Alan Livingston]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[Steve Allen]], and [[Pat Brown]] (the [[governor of California]]). The eulogy was delivered by [[Jack Benny]], who said that "Nat Cole was a man who gave so much and still had so much to give. He gave it in song, in friendship to his fellow man, devotion to his family. He was a star, a tremendous success as an entertainer, an institution. But he was an even greater success as a man, as a husband, as a father, as a friend."{{sfn|Epstein|1999|p=359}} Cole's remains were interred in Freedom Mausoleum at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]], in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], California.{{sfn|Epstein|1999|p=360}}

==Posthumous releases==
Cole's last album, ''[[L-O-V-E (album)|L-O-V-E]]'', was recorded in early December 1964—just a few days before he entered the hospital for cancer treatment—and was released just before he died. It peaked at number 4 on the ''Billboard'' Albums chart in the spring of 1965. A ''Best Of'' album was certified a gold record in 1968. His 1957 recording of "When I Fall in Love" reached number 4 in the UK charts in 1987, released in reaction to a version by [[Rick Astley]] challenging for the coveted Christmas number 1 spot.

In 1983, an archivist for EMI [[Electrola]] Records, a subsidiary of EMI Records (Capitol's parent company) in Germany, discovered some unreleased recordings by Cole, including one in Japanese and another in Spanish ("Tu Eres Tan Amable"). Capitol released them later that year as the LP ''Unreleased''.

In 1991, [[Mosaic Records]] released ''The Complete Capitol Records Recordings of the Nat King Cole Trio'', a compilation of 349 songs available as an 18-[[Compact disc|CD]] or a 27-[[LP record|LP]] set. In 2008 it was re-released in digital-download format through services like [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon Music]].

Also in 1991, [[Natalie Cole]] recorded a new vocal track that was mixed with her father's 1961 stereo re-recording of his 1951 hit "[[Unforgettable (Nat King Cole song)|Unforgettable]]" for a tribute album of the same title. The song and album won seven Grammy awards in 1992 for Best Album and Best Song.
