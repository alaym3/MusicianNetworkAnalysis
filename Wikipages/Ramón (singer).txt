==Biography==
Ramón was born on 3 May 1985 in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Las Palmas]] in the [[Canary Islands]], the youngest of three boys. He participated in the third season of ''[[Operación Triunfo (Spain)|Operación Triunfo]]'' (2003–2004), where he finished as the runner-up and, in a separate vote, was selected to represent Spain at the Eurovision in 2004 after [[Beth (musician)|Beth]]'s eighth-place finish the year before. It was his first major musical appearance – he had not been a recording artist before ''Operación Triunfo''.

With the song "[[Para llenarme de ti]]" ("To Be Filled By You"), Ramón finished in 10th place with 87 points in the final, which was Spain's last top ten result until 2012, when [[Pastora Soler]] managed to finish in 10th place again, with the song "[[Quédate conmigo]]".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.los40.com/actualidad/noticias/ramon-queda-decimo-en-un-festival-de-eurovision-ganado-por-ucrania/nota/1275976.aspx |title=Ramón queda décimo en un Festival de Eurovisión ganado por Ucrania - Los40.com |last=Staff |work=los40.com |date=17 May 2004 |access-date=30 March 2011}}</ref>

"[[Para llenarme de ti]]", which was written by [[Kike Santander]], was also a commercial success in Spain, peaking at number one on the [[Productores de Música de España|Spanish Singles Chart]]. Ramón's first album ''Es así'', produced by Toni and Xasqui Ten, debuted at number six on the Spanish Albums Chart.

In October 2006, Ramón's second album entitled ''Cambio de sentido'' was released. The album failed to chart. In 2008, Ramón served as a judge in the regional talent show ''¡Quiero ser como Pepe!'', aired on TV Canaria.

In 2010, Ramón abandoned his music career. Shortly after, he finished Audiovisual Production studies at IES Politécnico Las Palmas. In 2013, he moved to [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] to work as a camera assistant for local production company Seefood TV.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.elmundo.es/loc/2014/05/10/536d1c5622601d27398b457b.html |title=Los 'desaparecidos' de Eurovisión |first=José Luis |last=Romo |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |date=10 May 2014 |access-date=16 May 2015}}</ref>
