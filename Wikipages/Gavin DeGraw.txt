He has two older siblings: a sister, Neeka, and a brother, [[Joey DeGraw|Joey]] (who is also a musician). Growing up in a musical family, he was raised to regard music as part of the fabric of everyday life rather than as a remote show-business ideal.<ref name="artistdirect.com">{{cite web|title=Gavin Degraw Biography|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/gavin-degraw/2558748|website=Artist Direct|access-date=7 December 2015}}</ref>

As a teenager, DeGraw experienced a personal epiphany when he discovered [[Ray Charles]] and [[Sam Cooke]], whose combination of personal charm and emotional commitment struck a chord in the budding musician.<ref name="artistdirect.com"/> DeGraw played in a local [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] group called The People's Band with his brother Joey and with local musician and vocalist Steven Levine. The band played many of the local hotels and clubs around the [[Monticello, New York|Monticello]] area. On his brother's advice, DeGraw began writing his own songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnaroo.com/artists/gavin-degraw.aspx|publisher=[[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]]|title=Gavin DeGraw profile|access-date=January 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927030230/http://www.bonnaroo.com/artists/gavin-degraw.aspx|archive-date=September 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> He attended [[Ithaca College]] on a music scholarship, but found himself spending more time in his dorm room writing songs than attending classes and dropped out after one semester. DeGraw then moved to [[Boston]], where he attended the prestigious [[Berklee College of Music]] for two semesters while singing in a rock band and playing solo gigs on the side.<ref name="artistdirect.com"/>

==Music career==
After leaving [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee]] and relocating to [[Manhattan]] in March 1998, DeGraw laid the groundwork for a musical career. Within a few months of his arrival, DeGraw made his way into the Sunday night Ron Grant and Friends open-mike night at Wilson's (the noted Upper West Side restaurant inside the Lucerne hotel). The night manager, Shar Thompson, introduced DeGraw to the club's owner, Debbie Wilson, the next day. Wilson signed on as his manager. DeGraw began developing a reputation in [[New Yorks|New York's]] music community.<ref name="artistdirect.com" /> DeGraw eventually signed a record deal with [[Clive Davis]] and his [[J Records]] imprint, the home of [[Santana (band)|Santana]] as well as R&B singers [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Angie Stone]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gavin Degraw Biography|url=http://www.bandbiographies.com/gavin_degraw/biography.htm|website=Band Biographies|access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=December 2019}}

In the spring of 2002, DeGraw began work on his debut album. "I wanted to create something that was timeless rather than fashionable", he explained. "I was concerned with developing a sound that wasn't disposable. I didn't want to have too much glitter on me". The adjustment from the live stage to the recording studio was an educational process that gave DeGraw new insight into his work. "It made me think about making records differently," he says. "At first I felt out of my element because you have to learn the language and the science of making a record. It's a real process to get to the point where it doesn't sound like it's a process. We worked at making it breathe".<ref name="artistdirect.com"/>{{failed verification|date=November 2020}} The album, entitled ''[[Chariot (album)|Chariot]]'', was recorded at [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound]] in Los Angeles and produced by [[Mark Endert]].<ref name="Gavin DeGraw Biography"/>{{better source needed|date=December 2019}}
