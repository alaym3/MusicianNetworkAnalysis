'''Toby Keith Covel''' (born July 8, 1961) is an American [[country music|country]] singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer. Keith released his first four studio albums—1993's ''[[Toby Keith (album)|Toby Keith]]'', 1994's ''[[Boomtown (Toby Keith album)|Boomtown]]'', 1996's ''[[Blue Moon (Toby Keith album)|Blue Moon]]'' and 1997's ''[[Dream Walkin']]'', plus a Greatest Hits package—for various divisions of [[Mercury Records]] before leaving Mercury in 1998. These albums all earned Gold or higher certification, and produced several Top Ten singles, including his debut "[[Should've Been a Cowboy]]", which topped the country charts and was the most-played country song of the 1990s. The song has received three million spins since its release, according to [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]].<ref>Shelburne, Craig (March 1, 2007), [http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1553672/toby-keith-jams-notches-50-million-airplays.jhtml Toby Keith Jams, Notches 50 Million Airplays], ''CMT.com'', retrieved April 9, 2010</ref>

Signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] Nashville in 1998, Keith released his breakthrough single "[[How Do You Like Me Now?! (song)|How Do You Like Me Now?!]]" in late 1999. This song, the title track to his 1999 [[How Do You Like Me Now?!|album of the same name]], was the number one country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, ''[[Pull My Chain]]'', ''[[Unleashed (Toby Keith album)|Unleashed]]'', and ''[[Shock'n Y'all]]'', produced three more number ones each, and all of the albums were certified 4x Platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released ''[[Honkytonk University]]''.

When DreamWorks closed in 2005, Keith founded the label Show Dog Nashville, which merged with Universal South Records to become [[Show Dog-Universal Music]] in December 2009. He has released ten studio albums through Show Dog/Show Dog-Universal: 2006's ''[[White Trash with Money]]'', 2007's ''[[Big Dog Daddy]]'', 2008's ''[[That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy]]'', 2009's ''[[American Ride (Toby Keith album)|American Ride]]'', 2010's ''[[Bullets in the Gun]]'', 2011's ''[[Clancy's Tavern]]'', 2012's ''[[Hope on the Rocks]]'', 2013's ''[[Drinks After Work]]'', 2015's ''[[35 MPH Town]]'', and 2017's ''[[The Bus Songs]]'', as well as the compilation ''[[35 Biggest Hits]]'' in 2008. Keith also made his acting debut in 2006, starring in the film ''[[Broken Bridges]]'', and co-starred with comedian [[Rodney Carrington]] in the 2008 film ''[[Beer for My Horses (film)|Beer for My Horses]]'', inspired by his song [[Beer for My Horses|of the same name]].

Keith has released 19 studio albums, 2 Christmas albums, and 5 compilation albums, totaling worldwide sales of over 40 million albums. He has charted 61 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including 20 number one hits and 21 additional top 10 hits. His longest-lasting number one hits are "Beer for My Horses" (a 2003 duet with [[Willie Nelson]]) and "[[As Good as I Once Was]]" (2005), at six weeks each. Keith was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] in a closed ceremony alongside [[Ricky Skaggs]] on January 13, 2021.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meanwhile, Doubly-Impeached Trump Reportedly Gives Toby Keith, Ricky Skaggs Medals |last=Murphy |first=Chris|access-date=January 13, 2021 |url= https://www.vulture.com/2021/01/trump-gives-medal-to-toby-keith-ricky-skaggs-impeachment.html}}</ref>

==Early life==
Keith was born in [[Clinton, Oklahoma]], to Carolyn Joan (''née'' Ross) and Hubert K. Covel, Jr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/covel.html|title=Ancestry of Toby Keith|last=Reitwiesner|first=William Addams|publisher=wargs.com|access-date=September 12, 2008}}</ref><ref name="cmtbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/keith_toby/bio.jhtml|title=Toby Keith : Biography|work=Biography|publisher=cmt.com|access-date=September 12, 2008}}</ref> and is of English ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.houseofnames.com/covel-family-crest|title=Covel Surname}}</ref> He has a sister and a brother. The family lived in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], for a few years when Keith was in grade school, but moved to [[Moore, Oklahoma]] (a suburb of [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]]), when he was still young.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="cmtbio" /> Before the family moved to Moore, he visited his grandmother in Fort Smith during the summers. His grandmother owned Billie Garner's Supper Club in Fort Smith,<ref name="allmusic"/> where Keith became interested in the musicians who came there to play.<ref name="cmtbio" /> He did odd jobs around the supper club and started getting up on the bandstand to play with the band. He got his first guitar at the age of eight.<ref name="cmtbio" /> After the family moved to Moore, Keith attended Highland West Junior High and [[Moore High School (Oklahoma)|Moore High School]], where he played [[defensive end]] on the [[American football|football]] team.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Keith graduated from Moore High School and worked as a [[derrick]] hand in the oil fields. He worked his way up to become an operation manager. When Keith was 20, he and his friends Scott Webb, Keith Cory, David "Yogi" Vowell and Danny Smith, with a few others, formed the Easy Money Band, which played at local bars as he continued to work in the oil industry. At times, he would have to leave in the middle of a concert if he was paged to work in the oil field.

In 1982, the oil industry in Oklahoma began a rapid decline and Keith soon found himself unemployed. He fell back on his football training and played defensive end with the semi-pro Oklahoma City Drillers while continuing to perform with his band. (The Drillers were an unofficial [[farm club]] of the [[United States Football League]]'s [[Oklahoma Outlaws]]; Keith tried out for the Outlaws but did not make the team.) He then returned to focus once again on music. His family and friends were doubtful he would succeed, but, in 1984, Easy Money (various other band members included Mike Barnes, T.A. Brauer, and David Saylors) began playing the [[honky tonk|honky-tonk]] circuit in Oklahoma and [[Texas]].

==Musical career==
{{More citations needed section|date=March 2019}}
In the early 1990s, Keith went to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he hung out and [[Busking|busked]] on [[Music Row]] and at a place called Houndogs. He distributed copies of a [[Demo (music)|demo]] tape the band had made to the many record companies in the city. There was no interest by any of the record labels, and Keith returned home feeling depressed. He had promised himself and God to have a recording contract by the time he was 30 years old or give up on music as a career. A flight attendant and fan of his gave a copy of Keith's demo tape to [[Harold Shedd]], a [[Mercury Records]] executive, while he was traveling on a flight she was working. Shedd enjoyed what he heard, went to see Keith perform live and then signed him to a recording contract with Mercury.

===1993–1995: ''Toby Keith'' and ''Boomtown''===
Keith's debut single, "[[Should've Been a Cowboy]]", went to number one<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/430048/Toby+Keith/chart?f=357 |title=Toby Keith – Chart history |publisher=Billboard |access-date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> on the U.S. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in 1993, and it reached number 93 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="whitburn"/> This song led off his [[Toby Keith (album)|self-titled debut album]]. By the end of the decade, "Should've Been a Cowboy" received more than three million [[Spin (radio)|spins]] at radio, thus making it the most-played country song of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1553672/toby-keith-jams-notches-50-million-airplays.jhtml|title=Toby Keith Jams, Notches 50 Million Airplays|last=Shelburne|first=Craig|date=March 1, 2007|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|access-date=October 4, 2010}}</ref> Certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies, the album produced three more Top 5 hits on the country charts with "[[He Ain't Worth Missing]]" (at #5),<ref name="billboard.com"/> "[[A Little Less Talk and a Lot More Action]]" (originally the [[B-side]] of "Should've Been a Cowboy") and "[[Wish I Didn't Know Now]]" (both at #2).<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|pages=219–220|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] wrote of the album, "It is given a production that's a bit too big, clean, glossy and cavernous for Keith's good—it fits the outsized sound of early-'90s radio, but not his outsized talent—but beneath that sheen the songs are very strong." He also thought that it showed the signs of the style that Keith would develop on subsequent albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/toby-keith-mw0000095272|title=''Toby Keith'' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|access-date=July 9, 2013}}</ref> The album's success led to Keith touring with then-labelmates [[Shania Twain]] and [[John Brannen]].<ref name="waddell"/> Keith and Twain also appeared in [[Tracy Lawrence]]'s music video for "[[My Second Home]]" in 1993.

Keith then signed with [[Polydor Records]] Nashville and released his second album, ''[[Boomtown (Toby Keith album)|Boomtown]]'', in September 1994. Also certified platinum, this album was led off by the number one single "[[Who's That Man]]". After it, "[[Upstairs Downtown]]" and "[[You Ain't Much Fun]]" both made the Top 10, while "[[Big Ol' Truck]]" peaked at number 15. By late-1995, he released his first Christmas album, ''[[Christmas to Christmas]]'', via Mercury. Composed entirely of original songs, the album produced one chart entry in "Santa I'm Right Here", which reached as high as number 50 based on Christmas airplay.<ref name="whitburn"/>

===1996–1998: ''Blue Moon'', ''Dream Walkin{{'}}'' and ''Greatest Hits Volume One''===
Keith then signed with the short-lived Nashville division of [[A&M Records]] to release his third album ''[[Blue Moon (Toby Keith album)|Blue Moon]]'' in April 1996. That album received a platinum certification and produced three singles. Its first single, "[[Does That Blue Moon Ever Shine on You]]", which Keith wrote in 1987,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WB&s_site=timesleader&p_multi=WB&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB71C278953DD73&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Nothing shaky about Keith's music success|date=November 12, 1996|work=The Times-Leader|page=1C|access-date=March 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MT&s_site=macon&p_multi=MT&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB76D3553C1FB48&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Stages are set|date=March 29, 1996|work=Macon Telegraph|page=1D|access-date=March 28, 2010}}</ref> peaked at number 2. Following it were "[[A Woman's Touch (song)|A Woman's Touch]]" at number 6, and "[[Me Too (Toby Keith song)|Me Too]]", which became his third number one hit in March 1997.<ref name="whitburn"/> Keith also appeared on [[The Beach Boys]]' now out-of-print 1996 album ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'' performing a cover of their 1963 hit "[[Be True to Your School]]" with the Beach Boys themselves providing the harmonies and backing vocals.

Following a corporate merger, Keith returned to Mercury in 1997. His fourth studio album, ''[[Dream Walkin']]'', was also his first produced by [[James Stroud]], who would also serve as Keith's co-producer until 2005.<ref name="allmusic"/> It produced two consecutive number 2 hits with "[[We Were in Love]]" and a cover of [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s 1996 single "[[I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying]]". Sting also sang duet vocals and played [[bass guitar]] on it,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADA35EBA81992C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title= Keith, Sting duet gives tune second wind|date=November 7, 1997|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|page=P3|access-date=July 3, 2009}}</ref> and the two also performed the song at the 1997 [[Country Music Association]] awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1473203/31st-annual-cma-awards-show.jhtml|title=31st Annual CMA Awards Show|last=Wix|first=Kimmy|date=September 24, 1997|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|access-date=July 3, 2009}}</ref> After this song, the album's [[Dream Walkin' (song)|title track]] reached number 5, while "Double Wide Paradise" peaked at number 40.<ref name="whitburn"/>

Keith's last Mercury release was ''[[Greatest Hits Volume One (Toby Keith album)|Greatest Hits Volume One]]'' in October 1998. The album included twelve of his prior singles and two new songs: the [[country rap]] "[[Getcha Some]]"<ref name="rap">{{cite web|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/braddock.htm|title= Bobby Braddock article|access-date=July 19, 2007|last=Crossan|first=Jeff|work=Songwriter Universe}}</ref> and "If a Man Answers". Both were released as singles, with "Getcha Some" reaching the Top 20, but "If a Man Answers" became his first single to miss the Top 40.<ref name="whitburn"/> According to Keith, these two songs were originally to be put on a studio album, but Mercury executives, dissatisfied with the album that Keith had made, chose to put those two songs on a greatest hits package, and asked him to "go work on another album". After he recorded two more songs which the label also rejected, he asked to terminate his contract with the label.<ref name="waddell">{{cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Ray|date=June 18, 2005|title=Toby Keith: Superstar graduates from 'Honkytonk University'|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=117|issue=25|pages=45, 46, 48, 50|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22toby+keith%22+%22when+love+fades%22&pg=PA48}}</ref> After exiting Mercury, Keith co-wrote [[Shane Minor]]'s debut single "[[Slave to the Habit]]" with [[Chuck Cannon]] and [[Kostas Lazarides|Kostas]].

===1999–2002: ''How Do You Like Me Now?!'' and ''Pull My Chain''===
In 1999, Keith moved to [[DreamWorks Records]]' Nashville division, of which Stroud served as president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1486882/dreamworks-nashville-merges-with-mercury-and-mca.jhtml|title=DreamWorks Nashville Merges With Mercury and MCA|last=Gilbert|first=Calvin|date=May 7, 2004|work=CMT|access-date=July 9, 2013}}</ref> His first release for the label was "When Love Fades", which also failed to make Top 40.<ref name="whitburn"/> Upon seeing the single's poor performance, Keith requested that it be withdrawn and replaced with "[[How Do You Like Me Now?! (song)|How Do You Like Me Now?!]]", a song that he wrote with Chuck Cannon, and which had previously been turned down by Mercury.<ref name="waddell"/> It also served as the title track to his first DreamWorks album, ''[[How Do You Like Me Now?!]]'' The song spent five weeks at number 1 on the country charts, and became his first top 40 pop hit, with a number 31 peak on the Hot 100.<ref name="whitburn"/> It was also the top country song of 2000 according to the [[Billboard Year-End]] chart.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2000/hot-country-songs| title=Best of 2000: Country Songs | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |year=2000 | access-date=August 15, 2012}}</ref> The album, which was certified platinum, produced a Top 5 hit in "[[Country Comes to Town]]" and another number 1 in "[[You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This]]". It was also his first album to feature songs co-written by [[Scotty Emerick]], who would be a frequent collaborator of Keith's for the next several albums. Steve Huey wrote that this album "had a rough, brash attitude that helped give Keith a stronger identity as a performer."<ref name="allmusic"/> In 2001, Keith won the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s Top Male Vocalist and Album of the Year awards.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Following this album was ''[[Pull My Chain]]'', released in August 2001. The album's three singles—"[[I'm Just Talkin' About Tonight]]", "[[I Wanna Talk About Me]]", and "[[My List]]"—all went to number 1 on the country charts, with the latter two both holding that position for five weeks.<ref name="whitburn"/> "I Wanna Talk About Me", written by [[Bobby Braddock]], also displayed a country rap influence with its spoken-word lyrics.<ref name="rap"/> The [[Country Music Association]] named "My List" as Single of the Year in 2002.<ref name="whitburn"/> Of ''Pull My Chain'', Erlewine wrote that "this is a bigger, better record than its predecessor, possessing a richer musicality and a more confident sense of humor".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pull-my-chain-mw0000012267|title=''Pull My Chain'' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|access-date=July 9, 2013}}</ref>

The album was followed in late 2004 by ''[[Greatest Hits 2 (Toby Keith album)|Greatest Hits 2]]'', which included three new songs: "[[Stays in Mexico]]", "Go with Her", and a cover of [[Inez and Charlie Foxx]]'s "[[Mockingbird (Inez & Charlie Foxx song)|Mockingbird]]", recorded as a duet with his daughter, [[Krystal Keith]]. "Stays in Mexico" was a number 3 hit on the country charts, while "Mockingbird" peaked at number 27.

Capri Restaurant Group is owned by Frank Capri, who opened the restaurant in Mesa in the shopping center known as [[Mesa Riverview]] and is planning on opening multiple locations across the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phoenix.metromix.com/bars-and-clubs/article/toby-keith-draws-huge/1228396/content |title=Toby Keith draws huge crowd at opening &#124; Metromix Phoenix |publisher=Phoenix.metromix.com |date=June 4, 2009 |access-date=March 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315105706/http://phoenix.metromix.com/bars-and-clubs/article/toby-keith-draws-huge/1228396/content |archive-date=March 15, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2011, Keith introduced a new drink named “Wild Shot". At first it was only available in Mexico, but now is sold and served in America. It is a featured drink in his restaurant chain, I Love this Bar and Grill.

Keith's music career and his various other business ventures have made him one of the wealthiest celebrities in the United States.  The July 15. 2013, edition of [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]] features Keith on the cover with the caption "Country Music's $500 million man".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2013/06/26/toby-keith-cowboy-capitalist-countrys-500-million-man/ |title=Toby Keith, Cowboy Capitalist: Country's $500 Million Man |work=Forbes |date=June 26, 2013 |access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref> The article titled "Cowboy Capitalist" by [[Zack O'Malley Greenburg]] also contains information regarding Keith's earnings as a musician over the course of his career, such as earning $65 million in the past 12 months, which surpasses the earnings of even more well known musicians such as [[Jay-Z]] and [[Beyoncé]] and that he hasn't earned less than $48 million a year over the past 5 years.

==Political beliefs==
[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 090427-A-6177L-202.jpg|thumb|Keith performs for soldiers in Afghanistan, on April 27, 2009.]]
Since 2002, Keith has made numerous trips to the [[Middle East]] to bring entertainment and encouragement to U.S. men and women serving on or near the front lines. “My father was a soldier. He taught his kids to respect veterans,” said Keith. “It's that respect and the thank-you that we have a military that's in place and ready to defend our nation; our freedom.”<ref name="Greenberger">{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=54109|title=Toby Keith Entertains Troops in Afghanistan |last=Greenberger|first=Michael|date=April 28, 2009|publisher=American Forces Press Service|access-date=July 17, 2009}}</ref>

In 2004, Keith called himself "a conservative Democrat who is sometimes embarrassed for his party".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/07/23/hes_not_afraid_to_speak_out_for_his_country/|title=He's not afraid to speak out for his country|last=Morse|first=Steve|date=July 23, 2004|work=[[Boston Globe]]|access-date=September 12, 2008}}</ref> He endorsed the re-election of President [[George W. Bush]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|the 2004 presidential election]] and performed at a [[Dallas, Texas]], rally on the night before the election. Keith also endorsed Democrat [[Dan Boren]] in his successful run in Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district and is good friends with former Democratic [[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico Governor]] [[Bill Richardson]].
In a January 2007 interview with ''[[Newsday]]'', Keith was asked whether he supported the [[Iraq War]]. He responded with "Never did," and said he favors setting a time limit on the campaign. He also said, "I don't apologize for being patriotic... If there is something socially incorrect about being patriotic and supporting your troops, then they can kiss my ass on that, because I'm not going to budge on that at all. And that has nothing to do with politics. Politics is what's killing America."

[[File:TobyKeith CampLeMonier.jpg|thumb|right|Keith performs for the troops at the O'Callahan's Cantina at [[Camp Lemonnier]], [[Djibouti]], on May 31, 2006.]]
In April 2008, Keith said that [[Barack Obama]] "looks like a great speaker and a great leader. And I think you can learn on your feet in there, so I don't hold people responsible for not having a whole bunch of political background in the House and Senate."<ref>{{cite web|last=Finan |first=Eileen |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20191564,00.html |title=Surprise!

In October 2008, Keith told [[Country Music Television|CMT]] that he had left the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and has re-registered as an independent. "My party that I've been affiliated with all these years doesn't stand for anything that I stand for anymore," he says. "They've lost any sensibility that they had, and they've allowed all the kooks in. So I'm going independent." He also told CMT that he would likely vote for the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] ticket, partially because of his admiration for [[Sarah Palin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1596198/toby-keith-registering-as-independent-voter.jhtml |title=News : Toby Keith Registering as Independent Voter |publisher=CMT |date=October 2, 2008 |access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref>

In March 2009, Keith received the [[Johnny Spann|Johnny "Mike" Spann]] Memorial Semper Fidelis Award during a [[New York (state)|New York]] ceremony held by the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation. The trophy is named for the CIA operative (and former Marine Corps captain) who was the first U.S. casualty in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. "Spending time with our soldiers around the world is something I've always regarded as a privilege and honor," he said. "I'm certainly happy to accept this award, but I won't forget for a second who's really doing the heavy lifting to keep this country safe.

In April 2009, he voiced support for Obama on [[Afghanistan]] and other decisions: "He hired one of my best friends who I think should run for president someday...[[James L. Jones|Gen.

On March 24, 2001, Keith's father, H.K. Covel, was killed in a car accident. That event and the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 prompted Keith to write the song "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue", a song about his father's patriotism and faith in the United States. At first, Keith refused to record the song and sang it only live at his concerts for military personnel. The reaction to the song, the lyrics of which express clear [[nationalistic]] and [[militaristic]] sentiments, was strong in many quarters, even to the point that the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] [[James L. Jones]] told Keith it was his "duty as an American citizen" to record the song.<ref name=CBSnewsDec2003>{{cite web|access-date=June 5, 2007|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/28/60II/main580469.shtml|title=Courtesy Of The Red, White & Blue: Singer Talks About His Defiantly Patriotic Songs|publisher=CBS News |date=December 31, 2003}}</ref> As the lead single from the album ''Unleashed'' (2002), "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue" peaked at number one over the [[Fourth of July]] weekend.

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] invited Keith to sing "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue" on a 2002 Fourth of July concert it was producing, then rescinded the invitation after host [[Peter Jennings]] heard the song and vetoed it. Jennings said the song "probably wouldn't set the right tone".   Keith said his statement to the press of Jennings was, "Isn't he [[Canadians|Canadian]]?", and "I bet [[Dan Rather]] wouldn't kick me off his show."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|date=June 13, 2002|title=Singer Toby Keith speaks out on ABC censorship|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/2002/2002-06-13-toby-keith.htm|access-date=2021-10-15|website=[[USA Today]]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Leung|first=Rebecca|date=October 29, 2003|title=Courtesy Of The Red, White & Blue|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/28/60II/main580469.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031212002038/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/28/60II/main580469.shtml|archive-date=December 12, 2003|access-date=December 31, 2003|website=[[CBS News]]}}</ref>

===Feud with the Dixie Chicks===
Keith had a public feud with the [[Dixie Chicks]] over the song "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue", in 2002, as well as over comments they made about President [[George W. Bush]] on stage during a concert in [[London]], in March 2003. The lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, [[Natalie Maines]], publicly stated that Keith's song was "ignorant, and it makes country music sound ignorant".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=3488 |title=Natalie Maines (Dixie Chick member) Bashes Toby Keith's Patriotic Anthem |publisher=Top40-charts.com |access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref>  Keith responded by pointing out that Maines did not write her music and he does, and by displaying a backdrop at his concerts showing a doctored photo of Maines with [[Iraq]]i dictator [[Saddam Hussein]]. On May 21, 2003, Maines wore a T-shirt with the letters "FUTK" on the front at the [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2958450.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Fresh Dixie Chicks row erupts | date=June 3, 2003 | access-date=May 25, 2010}}</ref> While a spokesperson for the Dixie Chicks said that the acronym stood for "'''F'''riends '''U'''nited in '''T'''ruth and '''K'''indness," many, including host [[Vince Gill]], took it to be a shot at Keith ("'''F'''uck Yo'''u''' '''T'''oby '''K'''eith").  In an October 2004 appearance on ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', Maines finally confessed that it was indeed a shot at Keith, and that she "thought that nobody would get it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/216|title=Video of Dixie Chicks Appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher|publisher=Yoism.org|access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref>

In August 2003, Keith's representation publicly declared he was done feuding with Maines "because he's realized there are far more important things to concentrate on".  Keith was referring specifically to the terminal illness of a former bandmate's daughter, Allison Faith Webb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/tobey%20keith%20ends%20feud%20with%20natalie%20maines |title=Tobey Keith Ends Feud With Natalie Maines |publisher=Contactmusic.com |access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref> However, he continues to refuse to say Maines' name, and claims that the doctored photo was intended to express his opinion that Maines' criticism was an attempt to squelch Keith's [[free speech]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In April 2008, a commercial spot to promote [[Al Gore]]'s "[[We Campaign]]", involving both Keith and the Dixie Chicks, was proposed. However, the idea was eventually abandoned due to scheduling conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postrock/2008/10/toby_keith_unplugged.html |title=Talk Talk: Toby Keith Unplugged – Post Rock |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref>

On March 24, 1984, Keith married Tricia Lucus. He is the father of three children—two daughters, Shelley Covel Rowland<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/shelley.covelrowland?ref=ts ]{{Dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> (born 1980, adopted by Keith in 1984) and Krystal "[[Krystal Keith]]" LaDawn Covel Sandubrae (born September 30, 1985; signed a contract with Show Dog-Universal in 2013), and one son (Stelen Keith Covel, born 1997). He also has four grandchildren.

On March 24, 2001, Keith's father was killed in a car accident on [[Interstate 35]]. On December 25, 2007, the Covel family was awarded $2.8 million for the wrongful death of H.K. Covel. Elias and Pedro Rodriguez, operators of Rodriguez Transportes of Tulsa, and the Republic Western Insurance Co. were found liable as they failed to equip the charter bus with properly working air brakes.<ref>Cannon, Jane Glenn (December 25, 2007), [http://newsok.com/article/3185063/?print=1 "Toby's family satisfied"].
