Rimes began her career in [[musical theatre]], performing in a [[Dallas, Texas]], production of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', and almost landing the lead part in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''. After appearing on the network television competition show ''[[Star Search]]'', where she clearly charmed host [[Ed McMahon]] in addition to being a one-week champion, Rimes decided to go into [[country music]]. Rimes appeared a number of times on ''[[Johnnie High's Country Music Revue]]'' in [[Arlington, Texas]], which gained the attention of national [[talent scouts]].<ref name="musicianguide" />

By age nine, Rimes was an experienced singer. She toured nationally with her father and also regularly performed [[a cappella]] renditions of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at the opening of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] football games. Wilbur Rimes began recording his daughter under the independent label Nor Va Jak when she turned 11. She released three albums between 1991 and 1996.<ref name="musicianguide" />

Rimes was discovered by Dallas [[disc jockey]] and record promoter [[Bill Mack (singer)|Bill Mack]]. Mack was impressed by Rimes's vocal ability, and over the following three years, he made various attempts to take Rimes to a mainstream level. The center of Mack's plan to bring her success was his composition, "Blue".  In July 1994, Rimes recorded the song on her independent album, ''[[All That (album)|All That]]''.<ref name="book-pg63">{{cite book |title = Dreams Come True: The LeAnn Rimes Story |last = Sgammato |first = Jo |year = 1997 |publisher = [[Random House]] |isbn = 0-345-41650-3 |pages = 63–64 }}</ref>

Rimes would later that year release her fifth studio album titled ''[[Twisted Angel]],'' which contained more adult material.<ref name="cmtbio" />
After battling managerial control over her career the previous year, ''Twisted Angel'' became the first album released by Rimes that was not produced by her father.<ref name="twistedangelreview">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r606362|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Twisted Angel'' album review|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|website=allmusic|access-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref>
Instead, Rimes executive produced the album. A month following the album's release, ''Twisted Angel'' was certified "Gold" by the RIAA, her second Gold-certified album.<ref name="riaa" />
The album received mainly negative reviews by most music critics and magazines. Allmusic stated that the album could possibly "alieniate her from her original fans" and "the songwriting is a little uneven."<ref name="twistedangelreview" />
''Rolling Stone'' gave the album two out of five stars, stating that the album sounded too "country-pop crossover."<ref>{{cite magazine |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/leannrimes/albums/album/121150/review/5943137/twisted_angel |title = LeAnn Rimes: ''Twisted Angel'' |last = Hoard |first = Christian |date = October 22, 2001 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219082454/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/leannrimes/albums/album/121150/review/5943137/twisted_angel |archive-date = February 19, 2009 |magazine = Rolling Stone |url-status = dead |access-date = February 15, 2009 }}</ref>

Two singles were spawned from the album between 2002 and 2003, however none of the singles were Top 40 hits on the country or pop charts. The lead single, "[[Life Goes On (LeAnn Rimes song)|Life Goes On]]", reached the Top 40 only on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart, peaking at No. 9. The second single, "[[Suddenly (LeAnn Rimes song)|Suddenly]]", only peaked at 43 on the US Country charts, 47 on the UK charts and 53 on the Australian charts.

The following year when Rimes turned 21, she released her first children's book, titled ''Jag'', in July<ref name="jag" /> and she also released a ''[[Greatest Hits (LeAnn Rimes album)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation in November.<ref name="rock" />
The album recapped Rimes's major hits under Curb records from "Blue" in 1996, to "Life Goes On" in 2002. The album peaked at No. 3 on the Top Country Albums chart and No. 24 on the ''Billboard'' 200 in November.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r678180|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Greatest Hits'' album review|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|website=allmusic |access-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r678180|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Greatest Hits'' charts & awards|website=allmusic|access-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref>

[[File:LeAnn Rimes performs in the East Room of the White House.jpg|left|thumb|Rimes performing in the East Room of the White House before President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Laura Bush]], 2006]]

In January 2005, Rimes released her seventh studio album, ''[[This Woman (LeAnn Rimes album)|This Woman]],'' her first album of contemporary country music in many years.<ref name="allmusicbio" />
Although the album received mixed reviews from magazines and critics, it was Rimes's best-selling album in over five years,<ref name="biography">{{cite web |url = http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1843:2276/2/LeAnn_Rimes.htm |title = The Biography Channel: LeAnn Rimes biography |publisher = [[Biography Channel]] |access-date = February 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090220010248/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1843%3A2276/2/LeAnn_Rimes.htm |archive-date = February 20, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

selling more than 100,000 copies within its first week. Rimes explained to the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' that the album helped mature her as a person, "I have 10 years of experience, so it's tough to get anything past me in this business. I've become a very strong woman because of all I've gone through, good and bad."<ref name="people" />
''This Woman'' would eventually be certified "Gold" later in 2005, after selling more than 500,000 units nationwide.<ref name="rock" />
The album's singles were Rimes's first Top 10 hits on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in five years. The three singles released from the album—"[[Nothin' 'Bout Love Makes Sense]]", "[[Probably Wouldn't Be This Way]]", and "[[Something's Gotta Give (LeAnn Rimes song)|Something's Gotta Give]]"—all peaked within the Top 5 on the country charts between 2005 and 2006.<ref name="cmtbio" />
From the album, Rimes was nominated for a Grammy award for ''Best Female Country Vocal Performance'' for "Something's Gotta Give". She was also nominated for an [[American Music Award]] for "Favorite Female Country Artist". In 2006, Rimes recorded a cover version of [[Barbara Mandrell]]'s "[[If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Want to Be Right)]]", for a tribute album to Mandrell's career titled, ''She Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool: A Tribute to Barbara Mandrell''.<ref name="rock" />
Rimes also recorded a track for [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]'s 50th anniversary celebration album titled, "Remember When".<ref name="musicianguide" />

In summer 2006, Rimes released the studio album ''[[Whatever We Wanna]],'' which was released exclusively outside of the United States and Canada. It was originally planned on being released in North America; however, due to the success of ''This Woman'', it was never released. The album spawned three singles: "[[And It Feels Like]]", a duet with [[Brian McFadden (singer)|Brian McFadden]] titled "[[Everybody's Someone]]", and "Strong". The album leaned more towards [[pop rock]] and [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] music instead of country.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r842018|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Whatever We Wanna'' album review |last=Mawer|first=Sharon|website=allmusic|access-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref>

Rimes released one final single in the US from her album ''This Woman'' in August 2006 called "[[Some People (LeAnn Rimes song)|Some People]]", which peaked at 34 on the US country charts.

=== 2007–2009: ''Family'' ===
In October 2007, Rimes released her ninth studio album, ''[[Family (LeAnn Rimes album)|Family]]''. The album was a mix of country, pop, and rock music, and included the duet with [[Bon Jovi]], "[[Til We Ain't Strangers Anymore]]".<ref name="people" />
''Family'' was the first album released by Rimes in which every track was co-written by Rimes herself.<ref name="biography" />

=== 2016–present: ''Remnants'' ===
Rimes released a new single, "[[The Story (song)#LeAnn Rimes version|The Story]]", on June 24, 2016, in the UK. It is the first single from her studio album ''[[Remnants (LeAnn Rimes album)|Remnants]]'' and the first released under her new label [[RCA Records#Other RCA labels|RCA UK]].<ref name=story>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7408828/leann-rimes-new-single-rca-uk-the-story|title=LeAnn Rimes Announces New Single On RCA UK, 'The Story'|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)]]|access-date=2016-08-12}}</ref> The song was written by Phil Hanseroth and first recorded by [[Brandi Carlile]].

Rimes has indicated that she feels a strong connection with the track. In an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', she said "I fully embrace the journey I am on and have a deeper understanding of how every piece of my story serves a purpose in my evolution as a woman and an artist. This song is not only a love song but a song of self-acceptance and appreciation for life."<ref name=story/> The single was released internationally in September 2016; the album, ''Remnants'', was released in the UK on October 28, 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.euronews.com/2016/08/23/leann-rimes-releases-remnants |title = LeAnn Rimes releases 'Remnants' |publisher = Euronews |access-date = April 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170427095843/http://www.euronews.com/2016/08/23/leann-rimes-releases-remnants |archive-date = April 27, 2017 }}</ref>

Rimes makes an appearance in the 2017 [[Channing Tatum]] film ''[[Logan Lucky]]'', in which she sings ''[[America the Beautiful]]''. The track ''[[Love Is Love Is Love]]'', which appears on Rimes's ''Remnants'' album, is also used in the film.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.today.com/video/leann-rimes-talks-about-logan-lucky-and-shows-her-exercise-moves-1026712131800 |title = LeAnn Rimes talks about 'Logan Lucky' and shows her exercise moves |website = TODAY.com |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170826054512/https://www.today.com/video/leann-rimes-talks-about-logan-lucky-and-shows-her-exercise-moves-1026712131800 |archive-date = August 26, 2017 }}</ref>

On June 20, 2018, Rimes released ''Re-Imagined'', an EP featuring five tracks from her back-catalogue ("Can't Fight the Moonlight", "Blue", "One Way Ticket", "How Do I Live" and "Borrowed") that she has re-recorded. "Borrowed" includes duet vocals from [[Stevie Nicks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/06/listen-to-leann-rimes-duet-borrowed-with-stevie-ni.html|title=Hear LeAnn Rimes Sing "Borrowed" with Stevie Nicks for Re-Imagined EP|date=June 20, 2018|website=Pastemagazine.com|access-date=December 19, 2019}}</ref>

Rimes was scheduled to release a live album titled ''Rimes: Live at Gruene Hall'' on April 13, 2019, in honor of [[Record Store Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/02/leann-rimes-to-release-record-store-day-exclusive.html|title=LeAnn Rimes to Release Record Store Day-Exclusive Live Album|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|first=Lindsay|last=Thomaston|date=February 15, 2019|access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref>

== Musicianship ==
=== Vocal ability and musical styling ===
Since her debut in 1996, Rimes's [[soprano]]<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.metacritic.com/music/twisted-angel |title = Twisted Angel Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |website = [[Metacritic]] |access-date = July 8, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130924183336/http://www.metacritic.com/music/twisted-angel |archive-date = September 24, 2013 }}</ref> voice and vocal style have often been compared to and identified with [[Patsy Cline]]. Cline showed distinctive emotional expression in most of her material. Rimes has also used distinctive emotional expression in many of her songs, most notably her first single, "[[Blue (LeAnn Rimes single)|Blue]]", which was sung in the style of Cline. Rimes's vocal similarities to Cline had brought wide interest to the idea that Rimes was the successor to Cline's legacy, and brought her novelty appeal. Many music critics have argued that Rimes's vocals were only a reproduction of Cline's original sound, while others have disagreed.<ref name="musicianguide" /> Her vocal ability has also brought Rimes to comparisons to past teenage country stars, including 1950s country star [[Brenda Lee]] and 1970s country star [[Tanya Tucker]].

Rimes was known for choosing mature material that was beyond her age range. In her first album, Rimes recorded such material as [[Deborah Allen]]'s "My Baby", whose lyrics provocatively say, "my baby is a full-time lover, my baby is a full-grown man."<ref name="roughguide" /> Other material such as [[Diane Warren]]'s "[[How Do I Live]]" had also been considered too mature for Rimes's age and was the main reason why her version of the song was not chosen to be used in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Con Air]]''.<ref name="nashville">{{cite book |last = Kosser |first = Michael |title = How Nashville Became Music City, U.S.A. |publisher = Hal Leonard Corp. |location = Milwaukee, WI, USA |page = 316 |chapter = Ch. 26 — The King of Independents }}</ref>

[[AllMusic]] has called Rimes's vocals "rich and powerful."<ref name="allmusicbio" /> Rimes has a vocal range that goes from D3 to E♭6, which is a little more than three octaves.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ImfgdVhcI |title = LeAnn Rimes- Vocal Range (D3-Eb6) |website = [[YouTube]] |access-date = July 8, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151017092619/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ImfgdVhcI |archive-date = October 17, 2015 }}</ref>

=== Influences ===
Rimes has given credit to artists from various music genres, mainly [[country music|country]] and [[pop music|pop]]. She has stated that [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Wynonna Judd]] and [[Reba McEntire]] were primary influences on her career.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cybercountry.com/leannrimes.html |title = LeAnn Rimes |publisher = cyber country.com |access-date = February 16, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219081659/http://www.cybercountry.com/leannrimes.html |archive-date = February 19, 2009 }}</ref> Rimes has said the main influence on her career was Patsy Cline. She has covered many of Cline's hit songs since the beginning of her career. Her 1999 self-titled album is primarily a tribute to Cline, as Rimes recorded five out of ten songs for the album that were hits for Cline years before. Rimes paid tribute to Cline at the 2013 [[American Country Awards|ACA Awards]], performing a medley of her hits.<ref name="1999albumreview" /> Rimes has also stated that [[Judy Garland]] was an influence as well.<ref>''1997 Disney Channel Special concert Interview''</ref>

== Film and television ==
After beginning to date actor [[Andrew Keegan]] in 1998, Rimes said to the press that she had some ideas about possibly getting involved in an acting career. Rimes moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], later in the year with her mother to pursue an acting career.<ref name="people" /> That year Rimes played a role in the [[made for television movie]], ''[[Holiday in Your Heart]],'' which is based on a book she had helped write. For participating in the film, Rimes was awarded the "Rising Star" award from the ''Lone Star Film & Television Awards.'' She made her official film debut in 2000's ''[[Coyote Ugly (film)|Coyote Ugly]]'', performing toward the end of the film, as well as providing the singing voice for [[Piper Perabo]]'s character Violet Sanford.<ref>{{cite web |title = Radio Free Entertainment Exclusive Interview: Piper Perabo |url = http://www.radiofree.com/profiles/piper_perabo/interview03.shtml |publisher = RadioFree.com |date = March 22, 2007 |author = Lee, Michael J. |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111004065637/http://www.radiofree.com/profiles/piper_perabo/interview03.shtml |archive-date = October 4, 2011 }}</ref> In addition, she also recorded four songs for the film's soundtrack, including the Top 20 Pop hit, "Can't Fight the Moonlight."<ref name="musicianguide" /> In 2005, Rimes hosted the country music television competition, ''[[Nashville Star]]'' on the [[USA (TV network)|USA]] television network. However she only held the position for one season after deciding to depart from the show's cast.<ref name="biography" />

In early June 2007, she was chosen at the last minute to record the leading song for the soundtrack of ''[[Evan Almighty]]'' called "Ready For A Miracle" (previously recorded by [[Patti LaBelle]]). The song can be heard in the movie, during the end credits, and in the trailers of ''Evan Almighty.''<ref>{{cite news |title = LeAnn Rimes sings for Evan Almighty |publisher = CMT |url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1563132/20070621/rimes_leann.jhtml |date = June 21, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106114000/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1563132/20070621/rimes_leann.jhtml |archive-date = November 6, 2007 }}</ref>
Rimes played a supporting role in the movie ''Good Intentions'' with her friend Elaine Hendricks, which filmed near [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref name="Good Intentions">{{cite news |url = http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5613564,00.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153749/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5613564,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date = September 30, 2007 |title = LeAnn Rimes in the Movies |date = July 3, 2007 |publisher = [[Great American Country|GAC]] }}</ref>
Rimes plays Meg Galligan in the [[made for TV movie]], ''Northern Lights'', based on the [[Nora Roberts]] novel of the same name. The film aired on the [[Lifetime (network)|Lifetime]] network on March 12, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.theboot.com/2008/10/14/leann-rimes-to-star-in-made-for-tv-movie/ |title = LeAnn Rimes to Star in Made-for-TV Movie |last = Darden |first = Beville |publisher = The Boot.com |access-date = March 2, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090323033659/http://www.theboot.com/2008/10/14/leann-rimes-to-star-in-made-for-tv-movie/ |archive-date = March 23, 2009 }}</ref>

In 2007, Rimes began hosting the ''[[Colgate Country Showdown]]'', a nationwide televised country music talent competition, similar to that of ''American Idol'' or ''Nashville Star''.  In 2011, Rimes hosted the show for her fifth consecutive year, when the show switched sponsorship to [[Texaco]].<ref>[http://www.countryshowdown.com/Texaco/FAQs.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321201445/http://www.countryshowdown.com/Texaco/FAQs.php |date=March 21, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2020, Rimes competed as the "Sun" on the [[The Masked Singer (American season 4)|fourth season]] of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] reality singing competition ''[[The Masked Singer (American TV series)|The Masked Singer]]''. Her identity was revealed during the season finale on December 16, 2020, where she was declared the winner of the season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schneider |first1=Michael |title='The Masked Singer' Finale Reveals Sun as Winner: Here's the Identity of the Final Three Celebrities |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/the-masked-singer-finale-recap-sun-mushroom-crocodile-leann-rimes-1234864744/ |website=Variety |access-date=17 December 2020 |date=17 December 2020}}</ref> She was later a guest panelist in the [[The Masked Singer (American season 5)|season five]] finale where she also performed her song "How Do I Live" with "Chameleon", "Black Swan", and "Piglet" as Rimes stood back to back with her "Sun" costume.

== Personal life ==
=== Lawsuits ===
On May 21, 2000, Rimes filed a [[lawsuit]] against her father, Wilbur Rimes, and her former manager, Lyle Walker, in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Rimes claimed that her father and former manager took over seven million dollars from her in the preceding five years. Rimes also alleged that both men made unreasonable fees and took advantage of Rimes's label, [[Curb Records|Asylum-Curb]], in order to acquire financial gain.

Rimes sought unspecified damages because her attorney was not sure of how much money had been lost in the preceding five years. According to Rimes's lawyer, her mother hired two accountants to investigate how much was taken from Rimes' fortune, and it was estimated that the men acquired around eight million dollars in royalties.<ref name="musicianguide" /> In 2002, Rimes's lawsuit with her father was "settled on undisclosed terms."<ref name="people" /> Rimes reconciled with her father for her wedding.<ref>{{cite magazine |title = SomethingBlue |author = GarySusman |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,213116,00.html |magazine = Entertainment Weekly |date = February 26, 2002 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528220013/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C213116%2C00.html |archive-date = May 28, 2008 }}</ref>

In November 2000, Rimes filed a second lawsuit against her label, Asylum-Curb. Rimes wanted permission to be released from the contract that was signed by her parents on Rimes's behalf when she originally signed with the label in 1995. She also wanted her label to turn over the rights of her music, video work, and publishing interests, and destroy all of her recordings that were currently available to the label at the time of the lawsuit.<ref name="mtv" /> Part of Rimes's legal battles ended in December 2001, when Asylum-Curb started a new contract with Rimes.<ref name="musicianguide" />

=== Marriages ===
Amid the legal battles, Rimes fell in love with backup dancer Dean Sheremet. The two met when he was chosen to dance during Rimes's hosting of the 2001 [[Academy of Country Music Awards]]. After her first date with Sheremet, Rimes told ''[[InStyle Magazine]]'': "This is the guy I want to marry."<ref name="people" /> The couple married the next year, in 2002.
