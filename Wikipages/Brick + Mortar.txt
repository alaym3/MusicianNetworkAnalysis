==History==
===Early years===
Asraf and Tacon began playing music together when they were in middle school, initially as a drum and bass improvisational duo. The two bonded further over their shared interest in songwriting.<ref>{{cite web |author=Brick + Mortar |url=http://www.rhythmlivinusa.com/family/brick-mortar.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110192358/http://www.rhythmlivinusa.com/family/brick-mortar.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-11-10 |title=Rhythm Livin USA |publisher=Rhythm Livin USA |accessdate=2012-02-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=McCall|first=Tris|authorlink=Tris McCall|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2011/09/brick_mortar_to_perform_at_max.html |title=Brick + Mortar to perform at Maxwell's with Waking Lights |publisher=NJ.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref> They made many attempts at playing music with other people but "it never worked. It always ended up with Brandon [Asraf] and I", according to John Tacon.<ref name="musicwithoutlabels1">{{cite web | url=http://musicwithoutlabels.com/2011/11/20/brick-mortar-new-music-video-photo-interview | title=Brick + Mortar | publisher=Music Without Labels | date=2011-11-20 | accessdate=2012-02-09 | last=Holliday | first=Katie | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516013023/http://musicwithoutlabels.com/2011/11/20/brick-mortar-new-music-video-photo-interview/ | archivedate=2012-05-16 }}</ref> Their first band together was called Black Rhythm.

Both members took private lessons for their respective instruments at a young age, but were largely self-taught in their knowledge of theory and performance.<ref name="musicwithoutlabels1"/>

===Asbury Park and ''7 Years in the Mystic Room''===
In 2008, Asraf and Tacon renamed their project Brick + Mortar, and began focusing more heavily on the use of electronic samples in their music as well as relying less on improvisation and more on structured pop songs. With the promising rise of the Asbury Park musical scene, the duo began performing regularly up and down the New Jersey coast and building a reputation as one of the strongest live acts to come out of the state.

Brick + Mortar's consistent performances quickly gained them a strong following as one of the best live bands in the Asbury Park music scene, eventually rewarding them with opening spots for larger national acts such as [http://www.rivercityextension.com River City Extension] and [[Jimmy Eat World]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Beat |first=Star |url=http://www.starbeatmusic.net/2010/09/brick-mortar-opening-for-jimmy-world.html |title=Brick & Mortar opening for Jimmy World Eat on Sept. 24 |publisher=Star Beat Music |date=2010-09-11 |accessdate=2012-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916061857/http://www.starbeatmusic.net/2010/09/brick-mortar-opening-for-jimmy-world.html |archivedate=2010-09-16 }}</ref> at such well-known venues as the [http://www.starlandballroom.com Starland Ballroom] and [[the Stone Pony]].

In 2010, the band released their first studio LP, recorded independently, entitled ''7 Years in the Mystic Room''.<ref>{{cite web|title=7 Years In the Mystic Room|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/7-years-in-the-mystic-room/id360919952|work=iTunes|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref> The record garnered a great deal of positive feedback by critics and fans.

The duo's high energy shows, positive local press, and successful first record had not gone unnoticed by music executives. In December 2010, Brick + Mortar were invited to perform at a [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]]/[[Jive Records]] showcase the performance venue [[(Le) Poisson Rouge|Le Poisson Rouge]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenjunderground.com/photos/brick-mortar-le-poisson-rouge-121510 |title=Brick + Mortar @ Le Poisson Rouge 12.15.10 - Photos |publisher=The NJ Underground |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref> After a sing-off with a heckler in the audience, the duo won an award presented to them by Senior V.P. of the label.<ref>{{cite web |author=Friday |url=http://thenjunderground.com/blog/2010/12/17/brick-mortar-performed-participated-in-a-sing-off-won-a-trop.html |title=Brick + Mortar performed, participated in a sing-off & won a trophy @ Le Poisson Rouge 12.15.10 - Home |publisher=The NJ Underground |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2012-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226082538/http://thenjunderground.com/blog/2010/12/17/brick-mortar-performed-participated-in-a-sing-off-won-a-trop.html |archivedate=2011-12-26 }}</ref>
