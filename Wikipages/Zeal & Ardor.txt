'''Zeal & Ardor''' is a Swiss [[avant-garde metal]] band started and led by [[Manuel Gagneux]], a Swiss-American musician who had previously created a [[chamber pop]] project called Birdmask. Formed in 2013, the band mixes sounds of [[African-American spirituals]] with [[black metal]].

Initially a solo project, the band signed with MVKA records in 2016 and expanded to a full lineup, with Gagneux on vocals and guitar, backing vocalists Denis Wagner and Marc Obrist, guitarist Tiziano Volante, bassist Mia Rafaela Dieu, and drummer Marco Von Allmen. The project started in New York City, but is now based in [[Basel, Switzerland]].

Zeal & Ardor has released two albums, ''[[Devil Is Fine]]'' (2016), and ''[[Stranger Fruit]]'' (2018), as well as a demo album ''Zeal and Ardor'' (2014). In 2020, they released their first EP, ''[[Wake of a Nation]]''. A third studio album, ''[[Zeal & Ardor (album)|Zeal & Ardor]]'', has been announced for future release.

Zeal & Ardor offered a unique merchandise deal during their 2018 shows, fans could get free merchandise if they [[Human branding|branded]] the band's logo onto their skin. Eight people took up the offer, with Gagneux saying "The intent was that no one would ever do it. Because that's the whole thing: you don't want this brand. If you do, you're just an idiot who is following, not thinking for yourself. If they want to underline my statement, that's fine with me. But eight people is enough. If they don't get the symbolism, let's not encourage them."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/shocking-revelations/eight-people-got-zeal-ardors-logo-burnt-into-their-flesh-at-shows|title=Eight People Got ZEAL & ARDOR's Logo Burnt Into Their Flesh At Shows|date=23 May 2018|access-date=11 June 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143806/http://www.metalinjection.net/shocking-revelations/eight-people-got-zeal-ardors-logo-burnt-into-their-flesh-at-shows|archive-date=12 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/22/zeal-ardor-black-metal-bluesman-brands-fans|title=Zeal and Ardor: meet the black metal bluesman who brands his fans|first=Michael|last=Hann|date=22 May 2018|website=the Guardian|access-date=11 June 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530224703/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/22/zeal-ardor-black-metal-bluesman-brands-fans|archive-date=30 May 2018}}</ref>

===''Wake of a Nation'' and ''Zeal & Ardor'' (2020–present)===
In September and October 2020, the band released five of the six songs from their first EP, ''[[Wake of a Nation]]'', which was announced alongside the first two singles for release on October 23 of the same year. Gagneux wrote the songs in direct response to the [[murder of George Floyd]] earlier in 2020.<ref name="INT">{{cite web|date=2020-09-05|title=Zeal & Ardor Announce New EP Wake Of A Nation For October 2020 Release -|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2020/09/05/news/zeal-ardor-announce-new-ep-wake-of-a-nation-for-october-2020-release/|access-date=2020-09-08|website=mxdwn Music|language=en-US}}</ref> Gagneux explained the EP in the announcement:

{{blockquote|"Wake Of A Nation"'s intent and context should be obvious. I like to revel in ambiguity and in room for interpretation. This is not the case here. These 6 songs are a knee jerk reaction to what has happened to my fellow people in the last months. Originally I was set to record an album scheduled to come out next year. As these songs were written due to the horrendous events that instilled them I decided to release them as soon as possible. Using the rich heritage and culture as a part of my musical identity it felt like cowardice to sit by and continue with my routine as if nothing happened. This record is for [[shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]], [[Killing of Eric Garner|Eric Garner]], George Floyd and the countless untold and nameless killed. It is for the brave souls willing to take a stand and ready to risk their own wellbeing so that others may have theirs intact.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2020/09/04/news/zeal-ardor-announce-wake-of-a-nation-ep/|title=Zeal & Ardor Announce "Wake Of A Nation" EP|date=September 4, 2020|website=Theprp.com}}</ref>}}
