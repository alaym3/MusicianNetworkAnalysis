Throughout 2019, Firebrace completed a 55-date 'Spirit and Beyond' tour through central and regional Australia, where he made it a priority to speak with as many Aboriginal school children as possible to pass on powerful messages about working hard to achieve goals and the importance of finding a passion.<ref name="KMB">{{cite web|url=https://themusicnetwork.com/isaiah-firebrace-know-me-better/|title=Isaiah Firebrace drops radio-ready single "Know Me Better"|website=The Music Network|date=29 July 2020|access-date=1 August 2020}}</ref>

In July 2020, Firebrace released "Know Me Better". He said "This song actually means a lot to me because I finally feel like I'm starting to know myself better and I am heading in the direction I want to with my music. I've been in the studio a lot over the last three years and have experimented with lots of styles but 'Know Me Better' is a song that I'm really proud to release. I love the song, I love the production and I just can't wait to be able to show people this song".<ref name="KMB"/> Firebrace also announced that he was writing a children's book, "The Purple Platypus", which pushes a positive message for kids who feel different.<ref name="KMB"/>
