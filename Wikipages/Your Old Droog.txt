'''Your Old Droog''' is a Ukrainian-born American rapper and producer from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

== Biography ==
Droog's family emigrated to the United States from [[Ukraine]] when he was four years old.<ref name=sway/> His family was Jewish, and his first language was Russian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shorefire.com/releases/entry/your-old-droog-ukraine|title = Your Old Droog Returns with Ukraine}}</ref> As a young rap enthusiast growing up in [[Brooklyn]], Droog first developed his craft in lunchroom [[rap battle|battles]] in school.<ref name=sway/>

In April 2014, he released the song "Nutty Bars",  which generated a significant amount of buzz due to comparisons to Nas and the otherwise lack of information about the artist.<ref name=spin/> The speculation began after [[Sacha Jenkins]], a longtime associate of Nas, made a short positive review of the rapper on [[Mass Appeal (media)|Mass Appeal]] with the sub-heading "Who is this guy? None of your damn business! Just enjoy the music and stop asking questions."<ref name=spin/><ref name=MassAppeal>{{cite web|url=https://massappeal.com/your-old-droog-nutty-bars/ |title=YOUR OLD DROOG "NUTTY BARS" |last=Jenkins |first=Sacha |work=Mass Appeal |date=April 29, 2014 |access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref> The 10-song ''Your Old Droog EP'' was released soon after in June on [[SoundCloud]], produced by Droog and RTNC (later known as Mono En Stereo <ref name=hhdx-transportation/>).
