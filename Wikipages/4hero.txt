'''4hero''' are an [[electronic music]] group from [[Dollis Hill]], London, comprising producers Mark "Marc Mac" Clair & Denis "Dego" McFarlane. While the band is often cited as ''4 Hero'' or ''4-Hero'', the name is stylised as ''4hero'' on their albums and website. 4hero are known for being pioneers of [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[Jungle (music)|jungle]]/[[drum and bass]], [[broken beat]] and [[nu jazz]] music.

==Style==
4hero's style was initially uptempo [[breakbeat]], [[house music|house]] and [[techno]], and has progressed to breakbeat hardcore, [[oldschool jungle]], and [[drum and bass]]. Comparisons have been drawn between them and East London band [[Shut Up and Dance (band)|Shut Up and Dance]], with both bands evolving in the early 1990s as a reapproachment between the breakbeat-driven [[African music|African]]-diasporic musical structures of [[hip hop|hip-hop]] and [[reggae]], and the dark, European reconstruction of the techno sound popularised by the likes of [[Joey Beltram]], [[CJ Bolland]] and Mundo Muzique. 4hero both embraced the dynamics of populist rave culture, and maintained an avant-garde status as innovative and experimental producers. They trailblazed genre-crossing studio techniques such as [[Audio timescale-pitch modification|timestretching]] and [[pitch-shifting]].

==Early history, 1989–1995==
The main players in 4hero first met and came to prominence in the late 1980s when they were involved in the Strong Island FM [[pirate radio]] station. Marc Mac and Gus Lawrence set up [[Reinforced Records]] in 1989 to release their own productions as 4hero, with the group being completed by Dego and Ian Bardouille. Their first release was the 1990 single "All B 3 / Rising Son".

The follow-up [[Extended play|EP]], ''Combat Dancin''', underpinned the sub-bass pressure of the bleep 'n' bass artists associated with Sheffield's [[Warp Records]], such as [[LFO (British band)|LFO]] and [[Nightmares on Wax]], with mid-tempo hip-hop-style [[breakbeat]]s. It also brought the group to the attention of the [[rave]] community due to the track "Mr Kirk's Nightmare", which pivoted around the "Get Into Something" break (taken from the [[Isley Brothers]]) and a morbid vocal [[sampling (music)|sample]] ("Mr Kirk? Your son is dead. He died of an overdose.") taken from the [[Bobby Susser]], [[anti-drug]] hit "Once You Understand" by [[Think (band)|Think]]. 4hero were among the first proponents of what would become known as "drum and bass", which began to grow in profile via a series of releases on Reinforced. Another drum and bass figurehead, [[Goldie]], met 4hero at a performance in London's [[London Astoria|Astoria]]. Marc and Dego went on to teach and collaborate with Goldie which then brought the sounds Goldie envisioned to life, forming the [[Rufige Cru]] and [[Metalheadz]] monikers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/04/reinforced-interview|title=Reinforced Records|author=Hanna Bächer|date=12 April 2016|website=RBMA Daily|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190404182741/http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/04/reinforced-interview|archivedate=4 April 2019|access-date=7 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The band's debut album, ''In Rough Territory'', was released in 1991 on Reinforced. This would be the only one of the group's albums to feature Gus and Ian as full members. In late 1992 and early 1993, 4hero would release the [[darkcore]] ''Journey from the Light EP'', which according to and referenced by music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]], "If anyone can claim to have invented dark-core, it's 4 Hero".<ref>Reynolds S, 1998, ''Energy Flash'', Picador, p196-199, {{ISBN|0-5712-8914-2}}</ref>

Marc Mac and Dego would also record together under the alias "Tom & Jerry" (releasing classics such as "The One Reason", "We Can Be Free", "Lover to Lover", and "Air Freshener"), whilst Marc Mac solely as "Manix" (''Manic Minds EP'', ''Rainbow People EP'', and "Heading to the Light") and Dego as "Tek 9" ("Just a Dream", and ''Return of Tek 9 EP'').

In 1995, ''[[NME]]'' voted 4hero's second album ''[[Parallel Universe (4hero album)|Parallel Universe]]'' the album of the year in its dance category.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/features/4hero|title=4Hero – Features – Clash Magazine|date=1 January 2007|work=Clash Magazine}}</ref>

==1996 to the present day==
In 1997, one of their tracks, a [[remix]] of [[Masters At Work|Nuyorican Soul]]'s "Black Gold of the Sun", was released to critical acclaim with [[Louie Vega]] himself describing it as "...one of the best remixes ever...".  

The next year, 4hero rose again to mainstream visibility with their third studio album as 4hero, ''[[Two Pages]]'' (1998). Released on [[Gilles Peterson]]'s [[Talkin' Loud]] record label, the [[double album|double]] CD blended jazzy double bass, flowing breakbeats and a brew of [[mysticism]], [[spiritualism]], [[astrology]], [[U.F.O.]]s, and environmentalism. Luke Parkhouse provided the drums while [[Ursula Rucker]], Carol Crosby and Face V. Walsh provided vocals alongside veteran singer Terry Callier and a few other special guests. The album gained critical acclaim and a place on the shortlist for 1998's [[Mercury Music Prize]] as well as picking up a [[MOBO Awards|MOBO]] award in the same year. Both this album and artists recording on 4hero's Reinforced label were influential in the development of the broken beat scene.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/d79gbj/what-happened-to-broken-beat-alex-nut-eglo-records|title = Vice: Whatever Happened to Broken Beat?|date =29 January 2014 |author=Patrick Carnegy|website = Vice}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2015/05/20/dego-4hero-interview/|title=

Between 1998 and 2001, they hosted a Sunday night show with [[Kirk Degiorgio]] on [[Kiss 100 FM]] under the "R Solution" moniker.

4hero's fourth album, ''[[Creating Patterns]]'' (2001), featured another [[Ursula Rucker]] collaboration, an appearance from [[Jill Scott]], and a cover of [[Minnie Riperton]]'s classic 1970s song "Les Fleurs" with [[Carina Andersson]] as the lead vocalist. The latter was featured in a [[Baileys Irish Cream|Baileys]] TV commercial and series 4 of ''[[Top Gear (series 4)|Top Gear]]'' (both in 2004).

In 2004, the group released a [[compilation album]] consisting of two discs. The first disc contained 4hero remixes, while the tracks on disc 2 are remixes of 4hero tracks by other artists. This was released on their new label Raw Canvas. In 2006, 4hero was featured on the track "Bed of Roses" by [[Jody Watley]] on her album, ''[[The Makeover]]''.

Six years after the release of ''Creating Patterns'', ''[[Play with the Changes]]'' was released in February 2007 to critical acclaim. ''[[Mixmag]]'' described it as "their finest album to date" and awarded it the title of Album of the Month in its January 2007 issue.

In 2012, the album ''Hipology'' was released under the alias The Visioneers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcworld.net/features/marc-mac/|title=Marc Mac – DMC World Magazine|date=4 July 2012|work=DMCWorld Magazine}}</ref>
