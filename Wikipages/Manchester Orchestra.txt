==History==

===2004–2005: Early years===
Manchester Orchestra originated in the Atlanta suburbs. They are named after the English city of [[Manchester]], a city frequently viewed as being [[bohemianism|bohemian]]<ref>{{Cite news |title=Gritty city wins the boho crown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/may/26/communities.arts |newspaper=The Guardian |date=May 26, 2003 |access-date=November 13, 2011}}</ref> and also rich in musical history ([[The Smiths]], [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[The Buzzcocks]], [[The Stone Roses]], [[Joy Division]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Happy Mondays]], [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], [[Rick Astley|Rick Astley]]). Feeling increasingly alienated at his "small-town-Georgia, Christian high school" named Providence Christian Academy, in suburban Atlanta, the band's lead singer Andy Hull became so frustrated that he spent his senior year studying at home. He also wrote and recorded his first full-length album in 2004 while studying during his last year of high school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bonnaroo.com/manchester-orchestra|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831192432/http://www.bonnaroo.com/manchester-orchestra|url-status=dead|title=Manchester Orchestra|archive-date=August 31, 2007|access-date=May 1, 2021}}</ref>

Early in their career, the band recorded an album entitled ''[[Nobody Sings Anymore]]''. However, it was never released due to the shift in the band's musical direction and personnel changes undergone following its recording. The band stated that "the band that made the record was different to the band now." Some of the tracks written for the album were released instead on ''[[You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor]]''.<ref>

In March 2010, Hull mentioned in an interview with the Dallas Observer that the band had begun work on a follow up to 2009's ''[[Mean Everything to Nothing]]'', tentatively titled ''Let Go of Your Sorrowful Groaning''. (While ultimately discarded as an album title, this phrase later appeared on the song "Mighty".)

On ''Hope'', Andy Hull stated that the band "aimed for nasty and guttural stuff on ''Cope'', and this was more like, 'How pretty can this be?' I've always liked both sensibilities. This was an opportunity to see if we could sit down and do it for a whole album." They also announced a 13-date tour in support of ''Hope''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brian Mansfield, Special for USA TODAY |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/09/16/manchester-orchestra-hope-cope/15714047/ |title=Manchester Orchestra releases surprise album, 'Hope' |website=Usatoday.com |date=September 16, 2014 |access-date=March 30, 2016}}</ref>
