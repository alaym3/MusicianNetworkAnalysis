==History==

===2001–2004: Early years—The Silver Boulders===
While Nat was in preschool, he formed a band called The Silver Boulders with his friends, which included David,<ref name=NYTimes/> Thomas, Josh, Walker (son of news journalist [[Ann Curry]]), and Cal (son of actress [[Julianne Moore]]).<ref name=timescenterstage/><ref name=msnvideo>{{cite video | people = [[Ann Curry]], [[Polly Draper]], [[Michael Wolff (musician)|Michael Wolff]], [[Nat Wolff]], [[Alex Wolff]] | url = http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=en-US&vid=d34b0db7-be2f-4dac-8915-26b989be88ca | title = TODAY: 'Naked Brothers Band' | medium = telecast | publisher = MSN | date = April 12, 2007 | access-date = August 9, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080801122130/http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=en-us&vid=d34b0db7-be2f-4dac-8915-26b989be88ca | archive-date = August 1, 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Nat wrote his first song titled "Mama Don't Let Me Cry"<ref name=apple>{{Cite news |url=https://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/nakedbrothers/ |title=The Naked Brothers Band: Naked Inspiration |last=Driver |first=Dustin |work=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |access-date=June 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906221133/http://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/nakedbrothers/ |archive-date=September 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> at the age of five.<ref name=NYTimes/> At the time, Alex was not allowed to be part of the band, as Nat felt it would be unfashionable to have a brother in the same ensemble.<ref name=timescenterstage/>

When Nat, who lives in [[Lower Manhattan]] of [[New York City]], was four years old, his father, jazz pianist [[Michael Wolff (musician)|Michael Wolff]] (bandleader on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'')<ref name=timescenterstage/><ref name=NYTimes2/><ref name=NYTimes/> played Nat music, primarily jazz. One day, Michael overheard Nat teaching himself how to play major chords on the piano; Nat told his father that they were his "proud chords." After hearing the music of [[The Beatles]], Nat became inspired and watched all the group's films including ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]].''<ref name=timescenterstage/> On the other hand. Alex discovered how to play the [[saxophone]] at the age of two and a half. As recalled by the boys' mother, actress [[Polly Draper]] (star on ABC's ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|Thirtysomething]]''), Nat and Alex were infants when they arose from a bath proclaiming, "We're the naked brothers band!"<ref name=timescenterstage/><ref name=NYTimes2/><ref name=NYTimes/>

After the [[September 11 attacks]], six-year-old Nat composed the song "Firefighters" for a benefit he performed with his band, staged behind his [[Lower Manhattan]] apartment. Alex desired to be part of the concert, and so Nat created "a fake plastic saxophone" for him to play.<ref name=timescenterstage/> The charity ended up raising over $45,000 and was donated to the children of the firefighters who were killed during the terrorist attacks. After the band's charity concert, the band performed shows at Christmas parties and wedding ceremonies.<ref name=timescenterstage/>

After being inspired by [[Ringo Starr]] from [[the Beatles]], Alex chose the [[drums]] as an alternative instrument to play.<ref name=timescenterstage/> Alex learned how to play, as he viewed tapes of Starr playing, which resulted in him becoming a proficient drummer. This persuaded Nat to allow Alex to join his band. At the age of 6, Nat composed a melody without lyrics. He later desired to compose a song that sounded like [[The Beach Boys]]' music. Subsequently, Nat wrote the song "Crazy Car".<ref name=timescenterstage/>

In 2003, Nat was featured in his mother's play ''Getting Into Heaven'' at [[The Flea Theater]]. Nat also performed in ''The Heart of Baghdad'' at the same theater.<ref name=NYTimes2/>

===2004–2009: The Naked Brothers Band===
Nat begged his mom to be a child actor by putting signs on his door that said: "I want to be a child actor!" At first, she refused by explaining that it would be too difficult, so she made a compromise with Nat; in 2003, she let him film his own sitcom titled ''Don't Eat Off My Plate''.<ref name=NYTimes2/> After that, Nat begged his dad to record a tape in the studio with Alex and him, so Michael arranged a recording session for the three of them in the studio. While Draper saw them recording in the studio, she came up with the idea to make a "[[mockumentary|mock documentary]]" about the band as if they were huge like The Beatles.<ref name=timescenterstage/> During summer 2004, the film took production at the family's real-life apartment and throughout [[New York City]],<ref name=NYTimes2/> at which time Nat was 9 and Alex was 6-and-a-half.<ref name=timescenterstage/> Draper wrote and directed ''[[The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie]]'', which was designed as an [[independent film|independent]] family project with a budget under $1,000,000.<ref name=NYTimes2/> The film consisted of celebrities who were friends with Draper and Wolff, including [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Ann Curry]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], [[Ricki Lake]], [[Arsenio Hall]], and the complete cast of ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|Thirtysomething]].''<ref name=timescenterstage/><ref name=NYTimes2/> The film also included Draper's niece [[Jesse Draper|Jesse]],<ref name=NYTimes2/> her venture capitalist brother [[Tim Draper|Tim]], and her nephews William "Billy" and Adam, and Coulter Mulligan. Michael Wolff produced the music with his longtime friend, the music composer [[Michael A. Levine]];<ref name=timescenterstage/> Polly Draper, Michael Wolff, and Tim Draper all served as executive producers for the film. Nat Wolff wrote and performed all the songs, except for "That's How It Is", which was written and performed by Alex Wolff.

On October 23, 2005, Draper and Wolff entered the film at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]], where it won the audience award for family [[feature film]].<ref name=NYTimes2/><ref name=variety>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/profiles/TVMOW/main/177027/The+Naked+Brothers+Band.html?dataSet=1 |title=Variety Profiles: The Naked Brothers Band |work=Variety}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref name=variety2>{{Cite news|title=Naked Brothers Band |last=Fries |first=Laura |work=Variety |date=January 25, 2007 |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932570.html?categoryid=32&cs=1&query=Kidzhouse+Entertainment}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Albie Hecht]], a former [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] executive and founder of [[Spike TV]], was in the audience that day. He ended up bringing the film to Nickelodeon, suggesting they develop it into a television series. Tom Asheim, the vice president and general manager of Nickelodeon said:
: "At first, we were intrigued by the idea, but we weren't sure kids would get the vague-tongue-and-check-of-it. Then a bunch of us took it home to our own children and they loved it."<ref name=NYTimes2/>

Eventually, the staff at Nickelodeon persuaded Draper to put together a television series after comprising with short, 13 episode seasons over the summer and early autumn, so the boys were able to attend private school throughout most of the school year. Draper recalled, "When Nickelodeon first asked us about doing a series, we said, 'How about a cartoon, so the kids could stay normal?' They said, 'No, we love your kids.'"<ref name=risingstars>[http://webcenters.netscape.compuserve.com/celebrity/becksmith.js?p=bsf_nakedbros_rstar ]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> In the summer through the early fall of 2006, the first season of the self-titled series took production.<ref name=NYTimes2/> On January 27, 2007, ''The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie'' aired on Nickelodeon, and the self-titled series aired February 3.<ref name=NYTimes2/> Polly Draper is the creator, [[head writer]], executive producer, and frequent director of the series,<ref name=NYTimes2/><ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=variety2/> while Albie Hecht is the executive producer and his production company [[Worldwide Biggies]] distributes the series.<ref name=NYTimes/> Kidz House Entertainment also distributes the series.<ref name=variety2/> It is located at Stage 1, which is a division of Broadway Stages in [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]], [[Brooklyn]] where the show is filmed.<ref name=NYTimes2/><ref name=broadwaystages>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwaystages.com/ |title=de beste bron van informatie over webarchiv.

Nat and Alex never really realized how big they were until October 8, 2007. Band members Nat, Alex, Thomas, David, [[Allie DiMeco]] (who stars as Rosalina and Nat's crush on the film and TV series), and [[Qaasim Middleton]] (who replaced former band-member Josh on the series) had an autograph-signing at [[Times Square]] [[Virgin Megastore]] for the band's release of their self-titled debut album ''[[Naked Brothers Band (album)|The Naked Brothers Band]]''. There were 1,500 fans that waited outside of Virgin Megastore for hours; some camped out overnight.<ref name=timescenterstage/><ref name=NYTimes2/> They also had a live performance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]'' with the band's song "I'm Out".

In 2008, the second season of the band's television series aired, premiering on January 26 in ''[[Sidekicks (TV movie)|Sidekicks]]''. It then ended after a 15-episode run with ''[[Polar Bears (TV movie)|Polar Bears]]'', which aired on June 6.

On April 15, 2008, the band finally released its second album, ''[[I Don't Want to Go to School (album)|I Don't Want To Go To School]]''. The album had a total of 12 tracks, along with two bonus tracks, and a poster. As part of a [[Wal-Mart]] special sale, it included a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the Draper-Wolff family and the siblings' bandmates.

The band then started its first national-tour around the country called '''Nat & Alex Wolff: Fully Clothed & On Tour''', which started on November 1, 2008.<ref name="kaboose">{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.kaboose.com/naked-brothers-band-interview.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209004951/http://entertainment.kaboose.com/naked-brothers-band-interview.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 9, 2009 |title=Interview: Nat and Alex Wolff of the Naked Brothers Band - Kids' TV Shows, Music - Kaboose.com |publisher=Entertainment.Kaboose.com |access-date=April 24, 2010 }}</ref> Nat and Alex, along with professionally trained musicians that include ''Jacob Hertzog (music director, guitar and backup vocals)'', ''Misty Boyce (keyboards and backup vocals)'', ''[[Chris Muir (musician)|Chris Muir]]'' (bass and backup vocals), and ''[[Boris Pelekh]] (guitar, drums and backup vocals)'', performed songs from and even some from the upcoming episodes. Some concerts they performed at include the Capital One Bank Theater in [[New York City]], the [[Theater of the Living Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]], the Berkeley Performance Center in [[Boston]], [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|The Roxy]] in [[Los Angeles]], and the [[House of Blues]] in [[Chicago]], [[New Orleans]], [[Florida]] and [[California]].<ref name=kaboose/> The tour ended shortly after on December 14, 2008.

The third season of the brothers' show began on October 18, 2008, with the television movie ''[[Mystery Girl (The Naked Brothers Band)|Mystery Girl]]''. The third and final season of ''[[The Naked Brothers Band (TV series)|The Naked Brothers Band]]'' television show aired four TV movies and three holiday specials. The series ended on June 13, 2009, with ''No School Fools' Day''. Many fans wondered the reason for why the show came to an end. There were many reasons, but in the end it was confirmed that the ending of the series was because they wanted to film a 60 episode season which would conflict with the boys' school schedule.

===2009–2010: Duo career and touring===
After ''The Naked Brothers Band'' television show ended, the brothers continued to pursue music but emerged as a duo group because the duo's old band name was owned by [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]], a trademark of Nickelodeon. The other bandmates — Jake Hertzog and [[Boris Pelekh]] on guitar, [[Chris Muir (musician)|Chris Muir]] on bass, and Misty Boyce on keyboards — provided back-up instrumentation.  They had also appeared at the siblings' initial tour in 2008.<ref name=TimeOutChicago>{{Cite news|url=http://www3.timeoutny.com/chicago/blog/out-and-about/2009/08/chatting-with-the-naked-brothers-band/#more-26066|author=Sutton, Judy|title=Chatting with the Wolff Brothers of the Naked Brothers Band|publisher=TimeOutChicago|date=August 11, 2009|access-date=February 3, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312160222/http://www3.timeoutny.com/chicago/blog/out-and-about/2009/08/chatting-with-the-naked-brothers-band/#more-26066|archive-date=March 12, 2010}}</ref> Following the 2008 tour, the brothers confirmed their first full-length summer tour, titled "Nat and Alex Wolff: Summer Road Trip Tour". It began in June 2009 and ended in early October 2009.

The brothers performed at Pop-Con 2010, alongside [[Justin Bieber]], [[Selena Gomez]], and many other teen performers. Thereafter, the duo performed at the [[Earth Day]] 2010 concert in New York and played many new songs there, such as "Fire and Kerosene", "18" or "Disappointed" and others.

After the brothers completed their tour in 2009, they revealed that they were working on a new studio album, post their [[Nickelodeon]] TV series. New material was written and recorded during that summer. Two demo tracks — a cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s song "[[Dancing in the Dark (Bruce Springsteen song)|Dancing In The Dark]]" and of [[The Beatles]]' song, "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]" — were leaked onto the siblings' official website.<ref name=NatnAlex>{{cite web|url=http://www.natnalex.com/|title=NatNAlex.com|date=September 2007|access-date=February 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115025030/http://www.natnalex.com/|archive-date=January 15, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===2010–2012: ''Black Sheep''===
{{Further|Black Sheep (Nat & Alex Wolff album)}}
The brothers began recording their [[studio album]] in early 2010, and it was planned to consist of 12 new tracks. Of the writing process, Nat said, "The material is a bit more mature, as I have matured as a [song]writer."<ref name=TimeOutChicago/> Leading up to the album release, the brothers have starred in their own webshow on [[YouTube]], which was written and directed by their mother and their official website produced it. New episodes have been uploaded weekly, most of which featured snippets of tracks from their upcoming album, Black Sheep. The album was to be released in the fall of 2011. The album was produced by their father and Daniel Wise, a client at The Soundmine Recording Studio.<ref name=Soundmine>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundminerecording.com/recording-clients.php|title=The Soundmine Recording Studio - Our Clients|publisher=The Soundmine Recording Studio|access-date=February 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210095836/http://www.soundminerecording.com/recording-clients.php|archive-date=2010-12-10|url-status=live}}</ref>

===2012–present: ''Throwbacks'', double singles, and ''Public Places''===
In October 2013, Nat & Alex Wolff released an album of previously unreleased songs, entitled ''Throwbacks''. The album primarily consisted of songs the musicians wrote during their time on their Nickelodeon show, ''The Naked Brothers Band''.

In 2014, the brothers released a double-single, [[Cities (Nat & Alex Wolff song)|Cities]]/[[It's Just Love (Nat & Alex Wolff song)|It's Just Love]]. Three months later, they released two more singles, "Last Station" and "Rules". On October 7, an additional double-single, consisting of "Where I'm Goin{{'"}} by Alex, and "Rock Star" by Nat, was released. An alternate version of Rock Star was also featured in the film Nat co-starred in Palo Alto.

In November 2016, they announced a new EP titled ''Public Places'' was available for pre-order with the lead single "Rollin' Around" being available as an instant download when the album was pre-ordered. ''Public Places'' was released December 16, 2016.

==Musical style and influences==
{{More citations needed section|date=September 2010}}
The brothers' career was inspired by their favourite [[rock band]], [[The Beatles]]. Alex learned to play the drums by watching [[Ringo Starr]] on the [[The Beatles Anthology|''Anthology'']] tapes. This was the reason the brothers wanted to be in a band.<ref name=timescenterstage/> Nat has also said that the two of them were very inspired by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[the Killers]], [[The Doors]], and [[Coldplay]]. Originally, the band was a [[bubblegum pop]]-style group, over time however, the band evolved to have a more rock-based sound.
