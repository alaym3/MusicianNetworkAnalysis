==Personal life==
Fletcher released "I Believe You" in support of sexual assault survivors in March 2018, penning a [[#MeToo]]-inspired letter to ''Billboard''.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8236612/fletcher-new-song-i-believe-you-me-too-open-letter FLETCHER Shares #MeToo-Inspired Track 'I Believe You' With Poignant Open Letter: 'I'm Listening, We All Are'] at Billboard; by Patrick Crowley; published March 9, 2018; retrieved January 4, 2020</ref> She supported the movement with appearances at ''[[It's On Us]]'' and the [[United State of Women Summit]]. She's also participated in ''Girl Up'' and the ''[[Teen Vogue]]'' Summit in support of [[women's empowerment]] efforts.

Fletcher is a member of the [[LGBTQ|LGBTQ+]] community, and actively supports organizations such as [[GLAAD]], [[The Trevor Project]] and [[It Gets Better]]. She told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' "I definitely identify within the LGBTQ community, but as far as putting a label on like gay, straight, bisexual, lesbian, queer... it's all in the family and spectrum, and sexuality and gender is not black and white. It's a spectrum that we all fall somewhere in the world on. That's how I feel comfortable expressing myself -- loving who I feel like loving and who I'm attracted to."<ref name=":0"/>

Fletcher previously dated YouTuber [[Shannon Beveridge]]. Her EP ''The S(ex) Tapes'' chronicles the aftermath of their breakup.<ref name="TeenVoge2020"/>
