{{History of the Arab States}}

The '''Shihab dynasty''' (alternatively spelled '''Chehab'''; {{lang-ar|الشهابيون}}, [[ALA-LC]]: ''al-Shihābiyūn'') was an Arab family whose members served as the paramount tax farmers and local chiefs of [[Mount Lebanon]] from the early 18th to mid-19th century, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. Their reign began in 1697 after the death of the last [[Ma'n dynasty|Ma'nid]] chief. The family centralized control over Mount Lebanon, destroying the feudal power of the mostly [[Druze]] lords and cultivating the Maronite clergy as an alternative power base of the emirate. The Shihab family allied with [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] of [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] during his occupation of [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]], but was deposed in 1840 when the Egyptians were driven out by an Ottoman-European alliance, leading soon after to the dissolution of the Shihab emirate. Despite losing territorial control, the family remains influential in modern [[Lebanon]], with some members having reached high political office.

===Origins===
The Banu Shihab were originally an [[Arab]] tribe from the [[Hejaz]].<ref name=Hitti7>{{cite book|last1=Hitti|first1=Philipp K.|title=The Origins of the Druze People: With Extracts from their Sacred Writings|date=1928|publisher=AMS Press|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXJtAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> According to the 19th-century historian [[Mikhail Mishaqa]], the Banu Shihab were descendants of the [[Banu Makhzum]] clan of [[Quraysh]] to which [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] belonged, and that the family's ancestor was a certain soldier named Harith who fell in battle at the [[Bab Sharqi]] gate of [[Damascus]] during the Muslim [[Siege of Damascus (634)|siege of that city]] in 634.<ref>Mishaqa, ed.

===Governors of Wadi al-Taym===
[[Image:Citadelle Hasbaya.jpg|right|thumb|The 12th-century Shihab Citadel in [[Hasbaya]] in [[Wadi al-Taym]] ]]
The 19th-century family histories of the Shihabs by Haydar al-Shihabi and his associate [[Tannus al-Shidyaq]] claim that the clan's leader during its migration to Wadi al-Taym was a certain Munqidh ibn Amr (d. 1193), who defeated the Crusaders in an engagement there the following year. The same sources note that he was appointed governor of Wadi al-Taym in 1174 by the [[Zengid dynasty|Zengid]] ruler of Damascus [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur al-Din]]. Munqidh was succeeded by his son Najm (d. 1224), who was in turn succeeded by his son Amir (d. 1260). Amir allied with the [[Ma'n dynasty]], a Druze clan based in the [[Chouf District|Chouf]] region of [[Mount Lebanon]] and defeated the Crusaders in an engagement in 1244.{{sfn|Hourani|2010|p=968}} Amir's son and successor Qurqumaz took refuge with the Ma'ns in the Chouf during a [[Mongol invasions of the Levant|Mongol invasion]] in 1280. After his death in 1284 his son Sa'd succeeded him as governor of Wadi al-Taym.{{sfn|Hourani|2010|p=969}} The Shihabs continued to govern Wadi al-Taym throughout [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] rule (1260–1516), according to the family histories.{{sfn|Hourani|2010|pp=969–970}} Their chief Ali ibn Ahmad was mentioned by the local Druze chronicler [[Ibn Sibat]] (d. 1520) as the governor of Wadi al-Taym in 1478. Ali's son Yunus was mentioned by the contemporary Damascene chroniclers al-Busrawi and Ibn al-Himsi as being involved in a rebellion in Damascus in the late 1490s.{{sfn|Hourani|2010|p=970}}

The Ottoman Empire conquered the Levant in 1516 and an Ottoman government record from August 1574 directs the governor of Damascus to confiscate the rifle stockpiles of Qasim Shihab,{{sfn|Abu-Husayn|2004|p=24}} identified by the Shihab family histories as Qasim ibn Mulhim ibn Mansur, great-grandson of Yunus ibn Ali.{{sfn|Hourani|2010|p=971}} Qasim's son Ahmad was the ''[[multazim]]'' (tax farmer) of Wadi al-Taym and neighboring Arqoub in 1592–1600, 1602, 1606, 1610–1615, 1618–1621 and 1628–1630.{{sfn|Hourani|2010|pp=971–972}} Ahmad fought alongside the Ma'nid chief [[Fakhr al-Din II]] and the Kurdish rebel [[Ali Janbulad]] in a revolt against the Ottomans in the Levant in 1606, which was stamped out the following year.{{sfn|Abu-Husayn|1985|p=25}} When the forces of the Ottoman governor of Damascus [[Hafiz Ahmed Pasha]] moved against Ahmad in Wadi al-Taym in 1612, Fakhr al-Din's forces repulsed them.{{sfn|Abu-Husayn|1985|p=88}}  When, in the following year, Hafiz Ahmed Pasha launched an imperial-backed campaign against Fakhr al-Din, Ahmad, his brother Ali and many other local allies of the Ma'ns joined the Ottoman forces.{{sfn|Abu-Husayn|1985|p=93}} He held the fort of [[Hasbaya]] and later that year attacked his brother Ali in the latter's fort of [[Rashaya]].{{sfn|Hourani|2010|p=971}} Fakhr al-Din escaped to Europe and returned to Mount Lebanon in 1618, after which Ahmad sent his son Sulayman to welcome his return.{{sfn|Hourani|2010|p=972}} By then the Ma'ns had been restored to their tax farms and the governorships of [[Sidon-Beirut Sanjak|Sidon-Beirut]] and [[Safad Sanjak|Safad]]. Fakhr al-Din reconciled Ahmad and Ali in 1619. Ahmad and his men fought in Fakhr al-Din's army against the governor of Damascus Mustafa Pasha in the decisive [[Battle of Anjar]] in 1623,{{sfn|Hourani|2010|p=972}} which sealed Fakhr al-Din's growing power in Mount Lebanon.

In 1660, the Ottomans, created the [[Sidon Eyalet]], which included Mount Lebanon and Wadi al-Taym, and under the command of Grand Vizier [[Koprulu Mehmed Pasha]], launched an expedition targeting the Shihabs of Wadi al-Taym and the [[Shia Muslim]] Hamade clan of Keserwan.<ref name="Harris109"/> As Ottoman troops raided Wadi al-Taym, the Shihabs fled to the [[Keserwan]] region in northern Mount Lebanon seeking Hamade protection.<ref>Harris 2012, pp. 109–110.</ref> Koprulu Mehmed Pasha issued orders to Emir Ahmad Ma'n to hand over the Shihab emirs, but Emir Ahmad rejected the demand and instead fled to Keserwan, losing the tax farms of Mount Lebanon in the process.<ref name="Harris110">Harris 2012, p. 110.</ref> The peasantry of the abandoned regions suffered at the hands of Ottoman troops pursuing the Shihab and Ma'n leaders.<ref name="Harris110"/> The Shihabs decided to flee further north into Syria, taking up shelter at [[Harim Mountains|Mount A'la]] south of [[Aleppo]] until 1663.<ref name="Harris110"/> Four years later, the Ma'ns and their Qaysi coalition defeated the Yamani coalition led by the [[Alam al-Din|Alam al-Din family]] outside the port city of [[Beirut]].<ref name="Harris110"/> Consequently, Emir Ahmad Ma'n regained control of the Mount Lebanon tax farms.<ref name="Harris110"/> The Shihabs further solidified their alliance with the Ma'ns when, in 1674, Musa Shihab married the daughter of Emir Ahmad Ma'n.<ref name="Harris109"/> In 1680, Emir Ahmad mediated a conflict between the Shihabs and the Shia Muslim [[Harfush clan]] of the [[Beqaa Valley]], after the latter killed Faris Shihab in 1680 (Faris had recently displaced the Harfush from [[Baalbek]]), prompting an armed mobilization by the Shihabs.<ref>Harris 2012, p. 111.</ref>

In 1693, the Ottoman authorities launched a major military expedition, consisting of 18,500 troops, against Emir Ahmad when he declined a request to suppress the Hamade sheikhs after they raided [[Byblos]], killing forty Ottoman soldiers, including the garrison commander, Ahmad Qalawun, a descendant of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultan [[Qalawun]].<ref name="Harris113">Harris 2012, p. 113.</ref> Emir Ahmad fled and had his tax farms confiscated and transferred to [[Alam al-Din#Attempts to return and demise under Musa|Musa Alam al-Din]], who also commandeered the Ma'n palace in [[Deir al-Qamar]].<ref name="Harris113"/> The following year, Emir Ahmad and his Shihab allies mobilized their forces in Wadi al-Taym and conquered Chouf, forcing Musa Alam al-Din to flee to [[Sidon]]. Emir Ahmad was restored his tax farms in 1695.<ref name="Harris113"/>

===Regency of Bashir I===

When Emir Ahmad Ma'n died without a male heir in 1697, the sheikhs of the Qaysi Druze faction of Mount Lebanon, including the [[Jumblatt]] clan, convened in Simaqaniyyah and decided that Bashir Shihab I should succeed Ahmad as emir of Mountain Lebanon.<ref name="Izzeddin201"/><ref name="Harris113"/> Bashir was related to the Ma'ns through his mother<ref name="Izzeddin201"/><ref name="Khairallah111"/>  who was the sister of Ahmad Ma'n and the wife of Bashir's father, Husayn Shihab.<ref name="Khairallah111"/> Due to the influence of Husayn Ma'n, the youngest of Fakhr ad-Din's sons, who was a high-ranking official in the Ottoman imperial government, the Ottoman authorities declined to confirm Bashir's authority over the tax farms of Mount Lebanon; Husayn Ma'n forsake his hereditary claim to the Ma'n emirate in favor of his career as the Ottoman ambassador to India.<ref name="Izzeddin202">Abu Izzeddin 1998, p. 202.</ref> Instead, the Ottoman authorities appointed Husayn Ma'n's choice, Haydar Shihab, the son of Musa Shihab and Ahmad Ma'n's daughter.<ref>Abu Izzeddin 1998, pp. 201–202.</ref> Haydar's appointment was confirmed by the governor of Sidon,<ref name="Harris114">Harris, p. 114.</ref> and agreed upon by the Druze sheikhs, but because Haydar was still a minor, Bashir was kept on in the capacity of regent emir.<ref name="Izzeddin202"/>

The transfer of the Ma'n emirate to the Shihabi clan made the family's chief the holder of a large tax farm that included the Chouf, Gharb, [[Matn District|Matn]] and [[Keserwan]] areas of Mount Lebanon.<ref name="Harris117">Harris 2012, p. 117.</ref> However, the tax farm was not officially owned by the Shihabi emir and was subject to annual renewal by the Ottoman authorities, who made the ultimate decision to confirm the existing holder or assign the tax farm to another holder, often another Shihab emir or a member of the rival Alam al-Din clan.<ref name="Harris114"/> The Qaysi Druze were motivated in their decision to appoint the Shihabs with the fact that the Wadi al-Taym-based Shihabs were not involved in the intertribal machinations of the Chouf, their military strength and their marital kinship with the Ma'n.<ref name="Harris113"/> Other clans, including the Druze Jumblatts and the [[Maronites|Maronite]] [[Khazen]]s were subsidiary tax farmers, known as ''muqata'jis'', who paid the Ottoman government via the Shihabs.<ref name="Harris117"/> A branch of the Shihab family continued to rule Wadi al-Taym, while the Shihab branch of Mount Lebanon was based in Deir al-Qamar.<ref name="Harris117"/> The Shihab emir was also formally at the military service of the Ottoman authorities and required to mobilize forces upon request.<ref name="Harris117"/> The Shihabs' new status made them the preeminent social, fiscal, military, judicial and political power in Mount Lebanon.<ref name="Harris117"/>

In 1698, Emir Bashir gave protection to the Hamade sheikhs when they were sought out by the authorities and successfully mediated between the two sides.<ref name="Harris114"/> He also captured the rebel Mushrif ibn Ali al-Saghir, sheikh of the Shia Muslim Wa'il clan of Bishara in [[Jabal Amil]], and delivered him and his partisans to the governor of Sidon, who requested Emir Bashir's assistance in the matter.<ref name="Harris114"/> As a result, Emir Bashir was officially endowed with responsibility for "safekeeping of Sidon Province" between the [[Safad Sanjak|region of Safad]] to Keserwan.<ref name="Harris114"/> At the turn of the 18th century, the new governor of Sidon, [[Arslan Mehmed Pasha]], continued the good relationship with Emir Bashir, who by then had appointed a fellow Sunni Muslim Qaysi, [[Umar al-Zaydani]], as the subsidiary tax farmer of [[Safad]].<ref name="Harris114"/> He also secured the allegiance of the Shia Muslim Munkir and Sa'ab clans to the Qaysi faction.<ref name="Harris114"/> Emir Bashir was poisoned and died in 1705. The Maronite Patriarch and historian, [[Istifan al-Duwayhi]], asserts Emir Haydar, who had since reached adulthood, was responsible for Emir Bashir's death.<ref name="Harris114"/>

===Reign of Haydar===
{{See also|Battle of Ain Dara}}
Emir Haydar's coming to power brought about an immediate effort on the part of Sidon's governor, Bashir Pasha, a relative of Arlsan Mehmed Pasha, to roll back Shihab authority in the province.<ref name="Harris114"/> To that end, the governor directly appointed [[Zahir al-Umar]], Umar al-Zaydani's son, as the tax farmer of Safad, and directly appointed members of the Wa'il, Munkir and Sa'ab clans as tax farmers of Jabal Amil's subdistricts.<ref name="Harris114"/> The latter two clans thereafter joined the Wa'il's and their pro-Yamani faction.<ref name="Harris114"/> The situation worsened for Emir Haydar when he was ousted by the order of Bashir Pasha and replaced with his Choufi Druze enforcer-turned enemy, Mahmoud Abi Harmoush in 1709.<ref>Harris 2012, pp. 114–115.</ref> Emir Haydar and his Qaysi allies then fled to the Keserwani village of [[Ghazir]], where they were given protection by the Maronite Hubaysh clan, while Mount Lebanon was overrun by a Yamani coalition led by the Alam al-Din clan.<ref name="Harris115">Harris 2012, p. 115.</ref> Emir Haydar fled further north to [[Hermel]] when Abi Harmoush's forces pursued him to Ghazir, which was plundered.<ref name="Harris115"/>

In 1711, the Qaysi Druze clans mobilized to restore their predominance in Mount Lebanon, and invited Emir Haydar to return and lead their forces.<ref name="Harris115"/> Emir Haydar and the Abu'l Lama family mobilized at [[Ras el Matn|Ras al-Matn]] and were joined by the Jumblatt, Talhuq, Imad, Nakad and Abd al-Malik clans, while the Yamani faction led by Abi Harmoush mobilized at [[Ain Dara, Lebanon|Ain Dara]].<ref name="Harris115"/> The Yaman received backing from the governors of Damascus and Sidon, but before the governors' forces joined the Yaman to launch a pincer attack against the Qaysi camp at Ras al-Matn, Emir Haydar launched a preemptive assault against Ain Dara.<ref name="Harris115"/> In the ensuing [[Battle of Ain Dara]], the Yamani forces were routed, the Alam al-Din sheikhs were slain, Abi Harmoush was captured and the Ottoman governors withdrew their forces from Mount Lebanon.<ref name="Harris115"/> Emir Haydar's victory consolidated Shihab political power and the Yamani Druze were eliminated as a rival force; they were forced to leave Mount Lebanon for the Hauran.<ref name="Harris116">Harris, p. 116.</ref>

Emir Haydar confirmed his Qaysi allies as the tax farmers of Mount Lebanon's tax districts. His victory in Ain Dara also contributed to the rise of the Maronite population in the area, as the newcomers from Tripoli's hinterland replaced the Yamani Druze and Druze numbers decreased due to the Yamani exodus. Thus, an increasing number of Maronite peasants became tenants of the mostly Druze landlords of Mount Lebanon.<ref name="Harris116"/> The Shihabs became the paramount force in Mount Lebanon's social and political configuration as they were the supreme landlords of the area and the principal intermediaries between the local sheikhs and the Ottoman authorities.<ref name="Harris116"/> This arrangement was embraced by the Ottoman governors of Sidon, Tripoli and Damascus. In addition to Mount Lebanon, the Shihabs exercised influence and maintained alliances with the various local powers of the mountain's environs, such as with the Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil and the Beqaa Valley, the Maronite-dominated countryside of Tripoli, and the Ottoman administrators of the port cities of Sidon, Beirut and Tripoli.<ref name="Harris116"/>

===Reign of Mulhim===
Emir Haydar died in 1732 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Mulhim.<ref>Harris, p. 117.</ref> One of Emir Mulhim's early actions was a punitive expedition against the Wa'il clan of Jabal Amil. The Wa'il kinsmen had painted their horses' tails green in celebration of Emir Haydar's death (Emir Haydar's relations with the Wa'il clan had been poor) and Emir Mulhim took it as a grave insult.<ref name="Harris118">Harris, p. 118.</ref> In the ensuing campaign, the Wa'ili sheikh, [[Nasif al-Nassar]], was captured, albeit briefly. Emir Mulhim had the support of Sidon's governor in his actions in Jabal Amil.<ref name="Harris118"/>

Beginning in the 1740s, a new factionalism developed among the Druze clans.<ref name="Harris119">Harris, p. 119.</ref> One faction was led by the Jumblatt clan and was known as the Jumblatti faction, while the Imad, Talhuq and Abd al-Malik clans formed the Imad-led Yazbak faction.<ref name="Harris119"/> Thus Qaysi-Yamani politics had been replaced with the Jumblatti-Yazbaki rivalry.<ref name="Izzeddin203">Abu Izzeddin, p. 203.</ref> In 1748, Emir Mulhim, under the orders of the governor of Damascus, burned properties belonging to the Talhuq and Abd al-Malik clans as punishment for the Yazbaki harboring of a fugitive from Damascus Eyalet. Afterward, Emir Mulhim compensated the Talhuqs.<ref name="Harris119"/> In 1749, he succeeded in adding the tax farm of Beirut to his domain, after persuading Sidon's governor to transfer the tax farm. He accomplished this by having the Talhuq clan raid the city and demonstrate the ineffectiveness of its deputy governor.<ref name="Harris119"/>

===Power struggle for the emirate===
{{see also|Mansur Shihab}}
Emir Mulhim became ill and was forced to resign in 1753 by his brothers, emirs [[Mansur Shihab|Mansur]] and Ahmad, who were backed by the Druze sheikhs.<ref name="Harris119"/> Emir Mulhim retired in Beirut, but he and his son Qasim attempted to wrest back control of the emirate using his relationship with an imperial official.<ref name="Harris119"/> They were  unsuccessful and Emir Mulhim died in 1759.<ref name="Harris119"/> The following year, Emir Qasim was appointed in place of Emir Mansur by the governor of Sidon.<ref name="Harris119"/> However, soon after, emirs Mansur and Ahmad bribed the governor and regained the Shihabi tax farm.<ref name="Harris119"/> Relations between the brothers soured as each sought paramountcy. Emir Ahmad rallied the support of the Yazbaki Druze,<ref name="Harris119"/> and was able to briefly oust Emir Mansur from the Shihabi headquarters in Deir al-Qamar.<ref name="Izzeddin203"/> Emir Mansur, meanwhile, relied on the Jumblatti faction and the governor of Sidon, who mobilized his troops in Beirut in support of Emir Mansur.<ref name="Harris119"/> With this support, Emir Mansur retook Deir al-Qamar and Emir Ahmad fled.<ref name="Izzeddin203"/> Sheikh Ali Jumblatt and Sheikh Yazbak Imad managed to reconcile emirs Ahmad and Mansur, with the former relinquishing his claim on the emirate and was permitted to reside in Deir al-Qamar.<ref name="Izzeddin203"/>

Another son of Emir Mulhim, Emir [[Yusuf Shihab|Yusuf]], had backed Emir Ahmad in his struggle and had his properties in Chouf confiscated by Emir Mansur.<ref name="Harris119"/> Emir Yusuf, who was raised as a [[Maronite Church|Maronite Catholic]] but publicly presented himself as a Sunni Muslim, gained protection from Sheikh Ali Jumblatt in [[Moukhtara]], and the latter attempted to reconcile Emir Yusuf with his uncle.<ref name="Harris119"/> Emir Mansur declined Sheikh Ali's mediation. Sa'ad al-Khuri, Emir Yusuf's ''mudabbir'' (manager), managed to persuade Sheikh Ali to withdraw his backing of Emir Mansur, while Emir Yusuf gained the support of [[Uthman Pasha al-Kurji]], the governor of Damascus. The latter directed his son Mehmed Pasha al-Kurji, governor of Tripoli, to transfer the tax farms of [[Byblos]] and [[Batroun]] to Emir Yusuf in 1764.<ref name="Harris119"/> With the latter two tax farms, Emir Yusuf formed a power base in Tripoli's hinterland. Under al-Khuri's guidance and with Druze allies from Chouf, Emir Yusuf led a campaign against the Hamade sheikhs in support of the Maronite clans of [[House of al-Dahdah|Dahdah]], Karam and Dahir and Maronite and Sunni Muslim peasants who, since 1759, were all revolting against the Hamade clan.<ref name="Harris119"/> Emir Yusuf defeated the Hamade sheikhs and appropriated their tax farms.<ref name="Harris120">Harris, p. 120.</ref> This not only empowered Emir Yusuf in his conflict with Emir Mansur, but it also initiated Shihabi patronage over the Maronite bishops and monks who had resented Khazen influence over church affairs and been patronized by the Hamade sheikhs, the Shihab clan's erstwhile allies.<ref name="Harris120"/>

===Reign of Yusuf===
{{main|Yusuf Shihab}}
In 1770, Emir Mansur resigned in favor of Emir Yusuf after being compelled to step down by the Druze sheikhs.<ref name="Izzeddin203"/><ref name="Harris120"/> The transition was held at the village of [[Barouk]], where the Shihabi emirs, Druze sheikhs and religious leaders met and drew up a petition to the governors of Damascus and Sidon, confirming Emir Yusuf's ascendancy.<ref>Abu Izzeddin, pp 203–204.</ref> Emir Mansur's resignation was precipitated by his alliance with Sheikh [[Zahir al-Umar]], the Zaydani strongman of northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar of Jabal Amil in their revolt against the Ottoman governors of [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]]. Sheikh Zahir and the forces of [[Ali Bey al-Kabir]] of Egypt had occupied Damascus, but withdrew after Ali Bey's leading commander, [[Abu al-Dhahab]], who was bribed by the Ottomans. Their defeat by the Ottomans made Emir Mansur a liability to the Druze sheikhs vis-a-vis their relations with the Ottoman authorities, so they decided to depose him.<ref name="Harris120"/> Emir Yusuf cultivated ties with Uthman Pasha and his sons in Tripoli and Sidon, and with their backing, sought to challenge the autonomous power of sheikhs Zahir and Nasif.<ref name="Harris120"/> However, Emir Yusuf experienced a series of major setbacks in his cause in 1771.<ref name="Harris120"/> His ally, Uthman Pasha, was routed in the [[Battle of Lake Huleh (1771)|Battle of Lake Hula]] by Sheikh Zahir's forces. Afterward, Emir Yusuf's large Druze force from Wadi al-Taym and Chouf was routed by Sheikh Nasif's Shia cavalrymen at [[Nabatieh]].<ref name="Harris120"/> Druze casualties during the battle amounted to some 1,500 killed, a loss similar to that suffered by the Yamani coalition at Ain Dara.<ref name="Harris120"/> Furthermore, the forces of sheikhs Zahir and Nasif captured the town of Sidon after Sheikh Ali Jumblatt withdrew.<ref name="Harris120"/> Emir Yusuf's forces were again routed when they attempt oust sheikhs Zahir and Nasif, who had key backing from the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] fleet, which bombarded Emir Yusuf's camp.<ref>Harris, p. 121.</ref>

Uthman Pasha, seeking to prevent Beirut's fall to Sheikh Zahir, appointed [[Jazzar Pasha|Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar]], who was formerly in Emir Yusuf's service, as garrison commander of the city.<ref name="Harris122">Harris, p. 122.</ref> Emir Yusuf, as tax farmer of Beirut, agreed to the appointment and declined a bounty on al-Jazzar by Abu al-Dhahab (al-Jazzar was wanted by the Mamluk strongmen of [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman Egypt]]).<ref name="Harris122"/> However, al-Jazzar soon began acting independently after organizing the fortifications of Beirut, and Emir Yusuf appealed to Sheikh Zahir through Emir Mansur's liaising to request Russian bombardment of Beirut and oust al-Jazzar.<ref name="Harris122"/> Sheikh Zahir and the Russians acceded to Emir Yusuf's request after a large bribe was paid to them.<ref name="Harris122"/> After a four-month siege, al-Jazzar withdrew from Beirut in 1772, and Emir Yusuf penalized his Yazbaki allies, sheikhs Abd al-Salam Imad and Husayn Talhuq to compensate for the bribe he paid to the Russians.<ref name="Harris122"/> The following year, Emir Yusuf's brother, Emir Sayyid-Ahmad, took control of [[Qabb Ilyas]] and robbed a group of Damascene merchants passing through the village. Emir Yusuf subsequently captured Qabb Ilyas from his brother, and was transferred the tax farm for the Beqaa Valley by the governor of Damascus, [[Muhammad Pasha al-Azm]].<ref name="Harris122"/>

In 1775, Sheikh Zahir was defeated and killed in an Ottoman campaign, and al-Jazzar was installed in Sheikh Zahir's [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] headquarters, and soon after, was appointed governor of Sidon.<ref name="Harris122"/> Among al-Jazzar's principal goals was to centralize authority in Sidon Eyalet and assert control over the Shihabi emirate in Mount Lebanon. To that end, he succeeded in ousting Emir Yusuf from Beirut and removing it from the Shihabi tax farm. Moreover, al-Jazzar took advantage and manipulated divisions among the Shihab emirs in order to break up the Shihabi emirate into weaker entities that he could more easily exploit for revenue.<ref>Harris, pp. 122–123.</ref> In 1778 he agreed to sell the Chouf tax farm to Emir Yusuf's brothers, emirs Sayyid-Ahmad and Effendi after the latter two gained the support of the Jumblatt and Nakad clans (Emir Yusuf's ally Sheikh Ali Jumblatt died that year).<ref name="Harris123">Harris, p. 123.</ref> Emir Yusuf, thereafter, based himself in Ghazir and mobilized the support of his Sunni Muslim allies, the Ra'ad and Mir'ibi clans from [[Akkar]].<ref name="Harris123"/> Al-Jazzar restored the Chouf to Emir Yusuf after he paid a large bribe, but his brothers again challenged him 1780.<ref name="Harris123"/> That time they mobilized the support of both the Jumblatti and Yazbaki factions, but their attempt to kill Sa'ad al-Khuri failed, and Effendi was killed.<ref name="Harris123"/> In addition, Emir Yusuf paid al-Jazzar to loan him troops, bribed the Yazbaki faction to defect from his Sayyid-Ahmad's forces and once again secured control of the Shihabi emirate.<ref name="Harris123"/>

===Reign of Bashir II===
{{main|Bashir Shihab II}}
[[File:BashirChehab.jpg|thumb|upright|Bashir Shihab II was the Emir of Mount Lebanon from 1789 until 1840.]]

The most prominent among the Shihabi emirs was Emir [[Bashir Shihab II]], who was comparable to Fakhr ad-Din II. His ability as a statesman was first tested in 1799, when [[Napoleon]] besieged [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], a well-fortified coastal city in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], about forty kilometers south of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Both Napoleon and [[Jazzar Pasha|Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar]], the governor of Sidon, requested assistance from Bashir, who remained neutral, declining to assist either combatant. Unable to conquer Acre, Napoleon returned to [[Egypt]], and the death of Al-Jazzar in 1804 removed Bashir's principal opponent in the area.<ref name = "Shihab"/> When Bashir II decided to break away from the Ottoman Empire, he allied himself with [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], the founder of modern Egypt, and assisted Muhammad Ali's son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], in another siege of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. This siege lasted seven months, the city falling on May 27, 1832. The Egyptian army, with assistance from Bashir's troops, also attacked and conquered [[Damascus]] on June 14, 1832.<ref name = "Shihab"/>

In 1840, the principal European powers (Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia), opposing the pro-Egyptian policy of the French, signed the London Treaty with the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman ruler) on July 15, 1840.<ref name = "Shihab"/> According to the terms of this treaty, Muhammad Ali was asked to leave Syria; when he rejected this request, Ottoman and British troops landed on the Lebanese coast on September 10, 1840. Faced with this combined force, Muhammad Ali retreated, and on October 14, 1840, Bashir II surrendered to the British and went into exile.<ref name = "Shihab">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+lb0025) Library of Congress - The Shihabs, 1697-1842]</ref> [[Bashir III|Bashir Shihab III]] was then appointed. On January 13, 1842, the sultan deposed Bashir III and appointed [[Omar Pasha]] as governor of Mount Lebanon. This event marked the end of the rule of the Shihabs.

==Legacy==
Today, the Shihabs are still one of the most prominent families in Lebanon, and the third president of Lebanon after independence, [[Fuad Chehab]], was a member of this family (descending from the line of Emir Hasan, Emir Bashir II's brother<ref>{{cite book|last1=Malsagne|first1=Stéphane|title=Fouad Chéhab (1902-1973).

The Shihabs bear the title of "emir". Descendants of Bashir II live in Turkey and are known as the Paksoy family due to Turkish restrictions on non-Turkish surnames.<ref>http://www.abourjeily.com/Main_Bachir2.html</ref> Today, a group of them are Sunni, and others are Maronite Catholics, though they have common family roots. The 11th-century citadel in Hasbaya, [[South Lebanon]], is still a private property of the Shihabs, with many of the family's members still residing in it.
