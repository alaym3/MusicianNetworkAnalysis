'''DIIV''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], formed in 2011. The band consists of [[Zachary Cole Smith]] (vocals, guitar), Andrew Bailey (guitar), Colin Caulfield (bass, keyboards, guitar, vocals) and Ben Newman (drums).

Initially called Dive, the band started as Smith's solo recording project. After releasing three singles—"Sometime", "Human" and "Geist"—on [[Captured Tracks]], DIIV released its debut studio album, ''[[Oshin (album)|Oshin]]'', on June 26, 2012.

In 2016, the band released its second studio album, ''[[Is the Is Are]]'', after a lengthy and troubled gestation period.<ref>[http://www.stillinrock.com/2015/12/interview-still-in-rock-diiv.html Interview with Still in Rock, December 2015] “Still in Rock”</ref> On October 4, 2019, DIIV's third album, ''[[Deceiver (DIIV album)|Deceiver]],'' was released on [[Captured Tracks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-new-single-diiv-skin-game-band-announce-new-album-2532041|title=Listen to a hypnotic new single from DIIV as band announce return with new album, 'Deceiver'|last=Aubrey|first=Elizabeth|date=2019-07-24|website=me.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref>

After a few years playing guitar with the psych-rock band [[Soft Black]] and playing drums for [[Beach Fossils]], Zachary Cole Smith formed DIIV in 2011 as a forum for his own songs. He enlisted childhood friend Andrew Bailey (like Smith, from Connecticut) on guitar, bassist Devin Ruben Perez (from New York City), and ex-[[Smith Westerns]] drummer Colby Hewitt (from California) as his live band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/diiv-mn0002827271/biography|title=DIIV &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref> Smith, who originally named the project "Dive" after the [[Dive (Nirvana song)|Nirvana song of the same name]],<ref name="Pelly">{{cite web

Smith would eventually change the spelling of the band's name after learning of the early 1990s Belgian industrial [[Dive (Belgian band)|act by that name]].

[[Captured Tracks]] signed the band and released two singles, "Sometime" and "Human", which were recorded solely by Smith and had acted as [[Demo (music)|demo]]s.<ref name="Higgins">{{cite news

In May 2012, the band changed their name to DIIV, according to Smith, "out of respect for [[Dirk Ivens]] and the original [[Dive (Belgian band)|Dive]]," a 1990s Belgian [[Industrial music|industrial]] group.<ref name="Zeichner">{{cite magazine

"We’ve not been contacted by Dirk Ivens or his lawyers," Smith said in a press release, "but the short of it is that I don’t really give a fuck what the band is called." He continued, "I originated this project in a bedroom with no internet and didn’t know if it would ever leave the bedroom. 'DIVE', the word, was an element of what inspired the project in its genesis, but we’ve outgrown the name and its associations. The band is the same, the music is the same, the future will always be the same. A name is nothing."<ref name="Pelly" /><ref name="Sullivan">{{cite web

The songs on ''Oshin'' were influenced by [[krautrock]], ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]'' bands, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[world music]]. "People didn’t seem to pick up on the influence of these [[Mali]]an guitar players, especially Baba Salah whose record I got at the library," Smith said.

DIIV supported English band [[The Vaccines]] on their UK tour during November 2012. DIIV also supported the Canadian duo [[Japandroids]] on their East Coast US tour in November–December 2012.

On lists of the top 50 albums of 2012, ''Oshin'' was listed 22nd by ''[[Stereogum]]'' and 40th by ''Pitchfork''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1210661/stereogums-top-50-albums-of-2012/franchises/list/|title=Stereogum's Top 50 Albums Of 2012|website=Stereogum.com|date=December 5, 2012|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref>

In July 2013, multi-instrumentalist Colin Caulfield joined the band. Caulfield played keyboard and guitar for live shows, until late 2017, when he replaced Devin Ruben Perez on bass guitar.

On March 9, 2015, DIIV began recording their second album, ''[[Is the Is Are]]'', at Strange Weather Recording Studio in Brooklyn.

Drummer Colby Hewitt left the band in spring 2015 due to his rumored drug addiction.<ref name=fader>{{cite web|last1=McDermott|first1=Patrick D.|title=What Happened To DIIV?|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/08/11/diiv-zachary-cole-smith-interview|website=[[The Fader]]|access-date=August 14, 2015|date=August 11, 2015}}</ref> Ben Newman, (from North Carolina, formerly of Banda Suki) who played on several "Oshin" tracks including "Doused" (credited as Ben Wolf) was added as the group's drummer in April 2015, and played on the bulk of ''Is the Is Are''.

On September 16, 2015, DIIV released the first single from ''Is the Is Are'', "Dopamine".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Minsker|first1=Evan|title=DIIV Drop New Single "Dopamine"|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/61211-diiv-drop-new-single-dopamine/|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=September 16, 2015|date=September 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Coughlan|first1=Jamie|title=DIIV Share New Track 'Dopamine'|url=http://overblown.co.uk/diiv-share-new-track-dopamine/|website=Overblown.co.uk|access-date=23 September 2015}}</ref> They shared a second song from the album, "Bent (Roi's Song)", on November 4, 2015,<ref>{{cite web|title=DIIV have just announced new album 'Is The Is Are'|url=http://www.neverenoughnotes.co.uk/2015/11/diiv-have-just-announced-new-album-is-the-is-are/|website=Neverenoughnotes.co.uk|date=November 4, 2015 |access-date=4 November 2015|ref=Never Enough Notes}}</ref> followed by "Mire (Grant's Song)" on November 25.<ref name="Never Enough Notes">{{cite news|title=DIIV share new track 'Mire (Grant's Song)' from upcoming second album 'The Is The Are' |url=http://www.neverenoughnotes.co.uk/2015/11/diiv-share-new-track-mire-grants-song-from-upcoming-second-album-the-is-the-are/ |access-date=25 November 2015  |publisher=Never Enough Notes|date=25 November 2015}}</ref> "Under the Sun" was released as a single on December 13.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moreland|first1=Quinn|title=DIIV - "Under the Sun"|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17876-diiv-under-the-sun/|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=December 14, 2015|date=December 14, 2015}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[NME]]'' in October 2019, bassist Colin Caulfield commented on this period in the band's career, "It definitely felt like an end point... I had tried really hard to be as supportive as possible for a long time. It was a hands up moment, it was the type of realization Cole had to come to himself. And he did, which is great."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/diiv-interview-looking-easy-solution-addiction-found-theres-not-one-2555618|title=DIIV interview: "I was looking for an easy solution to addiction"|website=Nme.com|date=9 October 2019|access-date=20 November 2020}}</ref>

This period also saw the band take part in very occasional interviews with the media, with the band remaining relatively out of the public eye more than ever. Throughout 2016-2018 DIIV released a vast selection of cover songs, with the group performing songs by [[Elliott Smith]], [[Cat Power]], [[Sparklehorse]] and [[(Sandy) Alex G]] and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]. Later in 2017, DIIV also parted ways with bassist Devin Ruben Perez after earlier controversy arose from the revelation that Perez had posted anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic, and sexist comments on [[4chan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/57837-diivs-devin-ruben-perez-under-fire-for-sexist-racist-homophobic-remarks-on-4chan/|title=DIIV's Devin Ruben Perez Under Fire for Sexist, Racist, Homophobic Remarks on 4chan|website=Pitchfork|date=14 December 2014}}</ref> Perez himself maintains that he left the band over artistic differences and industry fatigue. <ref>https://imgur.com/jz4L1sZ</ref>

===2018&ndash;present: ''Deceiver''===
In the aftermath of Cole’s personal struggles, he "finally accepted what it means to go through treatment and committed," emerging with a renewed focus and perspective. Getting back together with the band in [[Los Angeles]] would result in a series of firsts. This would be the first time DIIV wrote and recorded a record as a band with bassist Colin Caulfield bringing in demos, writing alongside Cole, and the entire band contributing to the songwriting process of every song.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://capturedtracks.com/artist/diiv/|title=DIIV|website=Captured Tracks}}</ref> In an interview, Colin explained the writing process, "Cole and I approached writing vocal melodies the same way the band approached the instrumentals," says Colin. "We threw ideas at the wall for months on end, slowly making sense of everything. It was a constant conversation about the parts we liked best versus which of them served the album best."<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://capturedtracks.com/diiv-annouce-forthcoming-album-deceiver/|title=DIIV Announce Forthcoming Album, Deceiver|website=Captured Tracks}}</ref>
