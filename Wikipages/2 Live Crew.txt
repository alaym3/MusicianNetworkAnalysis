'''2 Live Crew''' was an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group from [[Miami]], [[Florida]], which had its greatest commercial success from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. The group's most well-known line up was composed of [[Luther Campbell|Luke Campbell]], [[Fresh Kid Ice]], [[Mr. Mixx]], and [[Brother Marquis]]. They were considerably controversial in the U.S. due to the sexually explicit content in their songs, particularly on their 1989 album ''[[As Nasty as They Wanna Be]]''.<ref name="Sound Warehouse">{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Sound Warehouse agrees not to stock 2 Live Crew's controversial 'As Nasty as They Wanna Be.'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-10/entertainment/ca-3843_1_sound-warehouse|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=November 10, 1990}}</ref><ref name="Omaha Undaunted by Florida Rap Ruling : Pop music: Officials still will prosecute retailers for selling 2 Live Crew albums despite obscenity reversal.">{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Omaha Undaunted by Florida Rap Ruling : Pop music: Officials still will prosecute retailers for selling 2 Live Crew albums despite obscenity reversal.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-09/entertainment/ca-1542_1_live-crew|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=May 9, 1992}}</ref><ref name="Album Sales Pact Averts Omaha Case : Pop: Obscenity charges are dropped after two record retail chains agree to stop selling sexually explicit 2 Live Crew music to minors.">{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Album Sales Pact Averts Omaha Case : Pop: Obscenity charges are dropped after two record retail chains agree to stop selling sexually explicit 2 Live Crew music to minors.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-02/entertainment/ca-1979_1_live-crew|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 2, 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Record Retailers Charged : Lawsuit: Two chains are accused of selling rap group 2 Live Crew albums to minors.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-02/entertainment/ca-1979_1_live-crew|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=April 23, 1992}}</ref><ref name="'Rap Jam '91' Show Called Off">{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title='Rap Jam '91' Show Called Off in Ohio : Concert: Cincinnati arena manager cites insufficient insurance, not police pressure, in cancellation.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-09/entertainment/ca-2145_1_cincinnati-police|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=March 9, 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=LA Times articles about 2 Live Crew|url=http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/2-live-crew-music-group|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times}}</ref> They were frequently challenged for their sexually explicit lyrics.

== History ==
=== 1984–1986: Group formation and breakthrough ===
The 2 Live Crew, although seen as a main fixture in the Miami hip-hop scene, actually got their start in [[California]] and was created by DJ [[Mr. Mixx]] (David Hobbs) with fellow rappers [[Fresh Kid Ice]] (Chris Wong Won), and Amazing Vee (Yuri Vielot).

The group released its first single, "Revelation", on its own label "Fresh Beat Records" in 1984. The A-side of "Revelation" contained a song by the same where the only rapper featured was Amazing Vee, and on the B-Side it contained a song named "2 Live" where Fresh Kid Ice was the only rapper featured.  "Revelation" was popular in Florida. Luke Skyywalker ([[Luther Campbell]]), who at the time was local DJ and promoter, invited The 2 Live Crew to relocate to Miami. Also due to the subsequent success of 2 Live Crew, this made Fresh Kid Ice the first rapper to be noted in [[Asian American hip hop|Asian American in hip hop]], and the first [[Asian hip hop|Asian rapper]] to gain notoriety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-rappers-rise-some-must-face-questions-about-race-hip-n843416|title=As Asian rappers rise, some must face questions about race and hip-hop|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

For their second single "What I Like" (1985), Fresh Kid Ice was the only rapper featured. Amazing Vee was only credited as writer, and left the group shortly after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Two-Live-Crew-What-I-Like/release/179201|title=Two Live Crew* - What I Like|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=April 15, 2018}}</ref>

The single "Throw The D" released in January 1986 gave a permanent blueprint to how future [[Miami bass]] songs were written and produced.<ref name="Bein2014">{{cite web|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/tootsie-rolls-hoochie-mamas-and-cars-that-go-boom-the-story-of-miami-bass|title=Tootsie Rolls, 'Hoochie Mamas,' and Cars That Go Boom: The Story of Miami Bass|last=Bein|first=Kat|date=November 3, 2014|website=thump.vice.com|publisher=VICE|access-date=February 27, 2017|quote=Miami Bass, Booty Bass, Booty Music, or whatever you want to call it, changed the scenes of hip hop, dance music, and pop forever...The story of music's dirtiest genre reaches back to the '80s with roots set firmly in Afrika Bambaataa's elektro-funk...foundational artists Amos Larkins and Maggotron, both of whom have been credited as kicking the regional sound into motion.

The dance consisted of men throwing their hips back and forth, while the girls would squat with their hands on their knees, bend over, and shake their butt. Wong Won suggested to Mr. Mixx that they should adapt the hook, and they scratched it into the song. Wong Won felt his voice was too high pitched for the hook, so Mr. Mixx who came up with the pattern did it using an emulator. Wong Won wrote the lyrics in twenty minutes on a plane ride returning to their base. Finally they booked a 16 track studios to record it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wong Won|first=Christopher|title=My Rise 2 Fame|publisher=Iconic Three Media Group|year=2015|pages=890–911|chapter=9.

Rapper [[Brother Marquis]] (Mark Ross) joined The 2 Live Crew. Luke Skyywalker ([[Luther Campbell]]) gave The 2 Live Crew a record deal and worked as the group's manager. He also joined the group as its hype-man and spokesperson in their subsequent controversies.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p50048|pure_url=yes}}|title=The 2 Live Crew: Biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|year=1999|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 4, 2010}}</ref>

The 2 Live Crew's debut album, ''[[The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are]]'', was released in 1986. Alex Henderson of [[AllMusic]] commented that the album "did take sexually explicit rap lyrics to a new level of nastiness", with tracks such as "We Want Some Pussy" and "Throw the 'D'".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r28357|pure_url=yes}}|title=The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are: Review|last=Henderson|first=Alex|publisher=allmusic|access-date=January 4, 2010}}</ref> With word-of-mouth attention, the album was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Bob Rosenberg of [[Will to Power (band)|Will to Power]] remixed "Beat Box" (originally released as "Two Live") and was billed "King of Edits" by Luke Skyywalker. In 1987, a Florida store clerk was acquitted of [[felony]] charges for selling the album to a 14-year-old girl.<ref name="allmusic" />

=== 1988–1998: Best selling albums and controversy ===
In 1988, the group released their second album, ''[[Move Somethin' (album)|Move Somethin']]'' It was certified Gold and featured the singles "Move Somethin'" and "Do Wah Diddy Diddy". The album improved on the charts from the previous album, making in to No. 68 on the Billboard 200 and No. 20 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.

Campbell decided to sell a separate clean version in addition to the explicit version of the album, ''[[Move Somethin' (album)|Move Somethin']]'' (1988), produced by Mr. Mixx. A record store clerk in [[Alexander City, Alabama]], was cited for selling a copy to an undercover police officer in 1988.<ref name="Larkin" /> It was the first time in the United States that a record store owner was held liable for obscenity over music. The charges were dropped after a jury found the record store not guilty.<ref name="Larkin" />

In 1989, the group released their third album, ''[[As Nasty as They Wanna Be]]'', which also became the group's most successful album. A large part of its success was due to the single "[[Me So Horny]]", which was popular locally with heavy radio rotation on Miami's WPOW-Power 96 FM. The [[American Family Association]] (AFA) did not think the presence of a "[[Parental Advisory]]" sticker was enough to adequately warn listeners of what was inside the case. [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], a lawyer affiliated with the AFA, met with [[Florida]] Governor [[Bob Martinez]] and convinced him to look into the album to see if it met the legal classification of [[obscenity]].<ref name="The 'Batman who took on rap">{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=The 'Batman' Who Took On Rap : Obscenity: Lawyer Jack Thompson put his practice on hold to concentrate on driving 2 Live Crew out of business. In Southern Florida, he is loved and loathed.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-18/entertainment/ca-87_1_jack-thompson|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=June 18, 1990}}</ref> In 1990, action was taken at the local level and [[Nick Navarro]], [[Broward County Sheriff's Office|Broward County sheriff]], received a ruling from County Circuit Court judge Mel Grossman that [[probable cause]] for obscenity violations existed.<ref name="allmusic" /> In response, Luther Campbell maintained that people should focus on issues relating to hunger and poverty rather than on the lyrical content of their music.<ref>''Jet'', November 26, 1990, p.34</ref>

Navarro warned record store owners that selling the album might be prosecutable. 2 Live Crew then filed a suit against Navarro. That June, [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida|U.S. district court]] Judge [[Jose Alejandro Gonzalez, Jr.|Jose Gonzalez]] ruled the album obscene and illegal to sell. Charles Freeman, a local retailer, was arrested two days later, after selling a copy to an undercover police officer. This was followed by the arrest of three members of 2 Live Crew after they performed the ''As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' album at Club Futura in [[Hollywood, Florida]], hosted by radio personality Tony the Tiger (Ira Wolf) from Power 96 FM, one of the few radio stations in the U.S. that continued airplay while the trial ensued. After international exposure with support from [[freedom of speech]] advocates like [[SCREW (magazine)|''SCREW'' magazine]]'s [[Al Goldstein]] (who owned a house in Broward County) and many others, they were acquitted soon after, as professor [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] testified at their trial in defense of their lyrics. Freeman's conviction was overturned on appeal as well.<ref name="allmusic" />

"A lot of people have gotten the impression that I'm this rude, sexual deviant or something," Campbell told journalist [[Chuck Philips]]. "But contrary to what has been printed about me in the papers, I'm no moral threat to anybody. I'm just a hard-working guy marketing a new product."<ref name="Campbell says he's a hardworking guy trying promote a new product">{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Businessman With a Nasty Rep : Rap: 2 Live Crew's controversial Luther Campbell says he's 'just a hard-working guy marketing a new product.'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-25/entertainment/ca-1217_1_live-crew|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=July 25, 1990}}</ref>

In 1992, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] overturned the obscenity ruling from Judge Gonzalez, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] refused to hear Broward County's appeal. As in the Freeman case, Gates testified on behalf of 2 Live Crew, arguing that the material that the county alleged was profane actually had important roots in [[African-American]] vernacular, games, and literary traditions and should be protected.<ref>{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Appeals Court Voids Obscenity Ruling on 2 Live Crew Album|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-08/news/mn-1911_1_live-crew|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=May 8, 1992}}</ref>

As a result of the controversy, sales of ''As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' remained brisk,<ref name="banned in use doing brisk business">{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Despite Chains' Boycott, Campbell Album Sells : Rap: The explicit 'Banned in the U.S.A.' is doing brisk business.

It peaked at number 29 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 3 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. A few other retailers were later arrested for selling it as well, including Canadian [[Marc Emery]], who was convicted in Ontario in 1991, and later gained fame as a marijuana activist. Later hard-rock band [[Van Halen]] sued over an uncleared sample of their song "[[Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love]]" in the 2 Live Crew song "The Fuck Shop".<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The publicity then continued when [[George Lucas]], owner of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe, successfully sued Campbell for appropriating the name "[[Luke Skywalker|Skywalker]]" for his record label, Luke Skyywalker Records.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=348}}</ref> Campbell changed his stage name to Luke (and changed the record label's name to Luke Records)<ref name="LarkinDM"/> and the group released an extremely [[politics|political]] follow-up album, ''[[Banned in the U.S.A.]]'',<ref name="LarkinDM"/> after obtaining permission to use an interpolation of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]".

''Banned in the U.S.A'' was the group's fourth album. It was originally credited as [[Luther Campbell|Luke]]'s solo album.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The certified Gold album included the hits "[[Do the Bart]]" and the title track. It was also the first release to bear the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-standard [[Parental Advisory]] warning sticker.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The [[eponym]]ous title single is a reference to the decision in a court case that its album, ''As Nasty as They Wanna Be'', was [[obscene]] (the decision was overturned on appeal).

Displeased over the decision of Florida Governor [[Bob Martinez]] who, on being asked to examine the album, decided it was obscene and recommended local law enforcement take action against it and over the subsequent action of [[Broward County, Florida]], [[sheriff]] [[Nick Navarro]], who arrested local record-store owners on obscenity charges for selling the group's albums and the subsequent arrest of members of the group on obscenity charges, the group included the song "Fuck Martinez", which also includes multiple repetitions of the phrase "fuck Navarro". The group found two other men with the same names, and had them sign releases, as they thought that this action would make it impossible for Martinez or Navarro to sue them.

''[[Live in Concert (2 Live Crew album)|Live in Concert]]'' (1990) was their fifth album.<ref name="LarkinDM"/>  This was 2 Live Crew's first and only [[live album]], and was also the only 2 Live Crew release under the Effect subsidiary label of [[Luke Records]],<ref name="LarkinDM"/> a move that was deemed necessary for the company to be able to release additional 2 Live Crew material outside of their distribution deal with [[Atlantic Records]], which was signed in 1990 – the same year they released ''Banned in the U.S.A.''

''[[Sports Weekend: As Nasty as They Wanna Be, Pt. 2]]'' was their sixth album.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Released in 1991, it is the sequel of ''As Nasty as They Wanna Be''.<ref name="LarkinDM"/>  A clean version was released later that same year titled ''Sports Weekend: As Clean as They Wanna Be Part II.''<ref name="LarkinDM"/>  This was the last studio album by all original members of the 2 Live Crew. It contains the successful single "[[Pop That Coochie|Pop That Pussy]]". The album was certified a gold record.

From that point on, all the releases by 2 Live Crew would always vary, having one or two member of the original line up missing, with the exception of [[Fresh Kid Ice]].

In 1994, ''[[Back at Your Ass for the Nine-4]]'' was released.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> This album the group was billed as "The New 2 Live Crew"<ref name="LarkinDM"/> as Brother Marquis and Mr. Mixx had left the group, the line-up for this album was [[Fresh Kid Ice]], [[Luther Campbell|Luke]] and new member, Verb. It is the last album with the 2 Live Crew banner to feature Campbell. The album became a moderate hit, peaking at No. 52 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and No. 9 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]].<ref name="billboard.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-new-2-live-crew|title=The New 2 Live Crew Back At Your Ass For The Nine-4 Chart History|website=Billboard|access-date=March 1, 2019}}</ref> Two charting singles were produced, "Hell, Yeah" and "You Go Girl" who were both made into music videos.

1995 saw a reunion of Fresh Kid Ice, Brother Marquis and Mr. Mixx re-formed again to record "Hoochie Mama" for the soundtrack of movie ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]''. The soundtrack reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], where it held the position for two weeks, and the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart for six weeks.

Fresh Kid Ice, Mr. Mixx, and Brother Marquis left Luke and [[Luke Records]] to go to Lil' Joe Records and released ''[[Shake a Lil' Somethin']]'' (1996) without Luther Campbell. ''[[Shake a Lil' Somethin']]'' is their seventh album. It was released on August 6, 1996, for Lil' Joe Records and was produced by Mr. Mixx. The album made it to No. 145 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and No. 33 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] and two singles "Shake a Lil' Somethin'", which peaked at No. 11 on the [[Hot Rap Songs|Hot Rap Singles]] chart and "Do the Damn Thing", which reached No. 24 on the same chart. It peaked at number 59 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop and albums chart. At the time of this album, Fresh Kid Ice had left the New 2 Live Crew (which consisted of himself, [[Luther Campbell|Luke]] and Verb and [[Luke Records]]) to re-join original members Mr. Mixx and Brother Marquis. However, the reunion was short lived as Mr. Mixx left the group after this album.

''[[The Real One]]'' is their eighth and last studio album. It was released on April 7, 1998, for Lil' Joe Records and with the absence of Mr. Mixx, was produced by various producers. The album peaked at No. 59 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]]. Shortly after the release of this album, Brother Marquis left as well.

=== 2000–2009: Hiatus and reformation ===
In the early 2000s, both [[Brother Marquis]] and [[Fresh Kid Ice]] pursued solo projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/193064-Fresh-Kid-Ice|title=Fresh Kid Ice|website=Discogs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6375297/a/bottom+boi+style.htm |title=Brother Marquis – Bottom Boi Style CD |publisher= CD Universe}}</ref>

Circa 2006–2007 [[Fresh Kid Ice]] and [[Brother Marquis]] discussed their differences and decided to relaunch 2 Live Crew. They offered other past members to be involved but were declined. Both of them started to tour and release singles.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/My-Rise-Fame-Autobiography-Legend-ebook/dp/B010NY9W06|title="My Rise 2 Fame": The Tell All Autobiography of a Hip Hop Legend|last=Wong Won|first=Christopher 'Fresh Kid Ice"|publisher=Iconic Three Media Group,LLC|date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>

=== 2010–present: Awards, Mr. Mixx return, and death of Fresh Kid Ice ===
In 2010, [[Brother Marquis]] and [[Fresh Kid Ice]] briefly reunited with [[Luther Campbell]], and [[Mr. Mixx]] as they were honorees winners at the 2010 VH1 Hip-Hop Honors: The Dirty South Edition.

Later that year, the both of them released the singles "I'm 2 Live" featuring [[Mannie Fresh]], "Cougar", "Boom" featuring [[E-40]]. They announced the release of a new 2 Live Crew album called ''Just Wanna be Heard'' with guest [[Too Short]], [[E-40]], and [[Insane Clown Posse]]. It was set to be released in August 2010, but remains unreleased to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rollingout.com/2010/08/17/2-live-crew-returns-to-music-despite-stroke-and-midlife-crisis/|title=2 Live Crew Returns to Music, Despite Stroke and Midlife Crisis|website=Rollingout.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/the-2-live-crew/5448797|title=The 2 Live Crew on Apple Music|website=Music.apple.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.11306/title.2-live-crew-readies-new-album-mannie-fresh-assists|title=2 Live Crew Readies New Album, Mannie Fresh Assists|date=May 23, 2010|website=HipHopDX.com}}</ref>
