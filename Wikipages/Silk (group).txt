'''Silk''' is an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] group, formed in 1989 in [[Atlanta]], Georgia. They are best known for their 1993 hit single, "[[Freak Me]]", which reached number-one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

==Career==
Silk is best known for their [[hit record|hit]] [[single (music)|singles]], "[[Freak Me]]", and "Happy Days" from their debut album, ''[[Lose Control (album)|Lose Control]]''. Another hit from ''Lose Control'', "Girl U For Me", helped the album reach [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] status.  They later had success with singles such as "[[I Can Go Deep]]", "Hooked on You", "Don't Rush", "If You" (released February 23, 1999) "Meeting in My Bedroom", and "We're Calling You."  In 1994, Silk won Album Of The Year for ''Lose Control'' at the Soul Train Music Awards.

Silk was discovered by the musician [[Keith Sweat]]. The group was originally a quintet made up of Timothy "Timzo" Cameron, James "Jimmy" Gates, Jr., Johnathen "John John" Rasboro, Tyga Graham & Albert Allen.  Gary "Big G" Glenn & Gary "Lil G" Jenkins joined shortly after the departures of Graham & Allen. In 2002, Silk left the label and took a hiatus. That same year, Jenkins went on to pursue other interests and made his stage debut in 2002 as 'AJ' in the [[Tyler Perry]] play ''[[Madea's Family Reunion]]''. He resurfaced musically in 2007 with his solo debut, ''The Other Side''. Silk and Sweat both appeared in the group, [[Black Men United]] on the song "U Will Know" which is featured on soundtrack for the movie ''[[Jason's Lyric]]''. silk has also appeared on the soundtracks for ''Booty Call'' (Feel Good), ''Made In America'' (Does He Do It Good w/Keith Sweat),''A Low Down Dirty Shame'' (I Can Go Deep), and ''Blankman'' (Cry On).

In 2003 and down to a quartet, Silk released their fifth studio album ''Silktime'' on their own label Silk Music Group. The album featured the songs "Silktime", "My Girl", "Alibi", "More", "You (The Baby Song)", "Check My Story" and a [[cover version]] of [[Blue Magic (band)|Blue Magic]]'s "[[Sideshow (song)|Sideshow]]". That song reunited them with their mentor Keith Sweat. The album appeared in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

In 2006, the group returned with their sixth release, a covers album entitled ''Always And Forever'' on Shanachie Records. The album featured covers of R&B songs including "[[Adore (Prince song)|Adore]]" by [[Prince (artist)|Prince]], "[[Always and Forever (Heatwave song)|Always and Forever]]" by [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]], and "Secret Garden" by [[Quincy Jones]]. "Secret Garden" was the first and only single.

Jenkins has since reunited with Silk and their 7th album, ''Quiet Storm'', was released on March 18, 2016 on Shanachie Records.

In 2018, Silk celebrated 25 years in the music business with two star studded concerts---one at B.B. King's in New York in February and the other in Atlanta in March.  They were also honored with an episode on the popular series ''Unsung'' that same year.
