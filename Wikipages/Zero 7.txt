'''Zero 7''' are an English musical duo consisting of Henry Binns and Sam Hardaker. They began as studio engineers and in 1997 formed the group Zero 7. Their debut album, ''[[Simple Things (Zero 7 album)|Simple Things]]'', was released in 2001. Subsequent albums include ''[[When It Falls]]'', ''[[The Garden (Zero 7 album)|The Garden]]'', and ''[[Yeah Ghost]]''.

After studying [[Audio engineering|sound engineering]], Binns and Hardaker began their careers in the [[music industry]] in the 1990s at [[Mickie Most]]'s [[Rak Records|RAK]] recording studio in London, engineering music for British groups like [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Young Disciples]], and [[Robert Plant]]. In 1997 they created a [[remix]] of the song "Climbing Up the Walls" by [[Radiohead]] (which was also the first time the name 'Zero 7' was used)<ref>{{cite web|title=THE INTERVIEW: Zero 7|url=http://www.shortandsweetnyc.com/2009/09/the-interview-zero-7/|website=Short and Sweet NYC|access-date=22 February 2015}}</ref> and Binns received a credit for additional sampling on ''[[Kid A]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/henry-binns-mn0000632301/credits |title=Henry Binns &#124; Credits |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The pair also remixed [[Terry Callier]]'s "Love Theme From Spartacus" and songs by [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Sneaker Pimps]] and [[Lambchop (band)|Lambchop]].

==History==
The name Zero 7 was chosen after Binns and Hardaker spent time on the Honduran island [[Utila]], which contained a bar named Cero Siete. After returning to the UK they were asked by Radiohead to remix the song "Climbing Up the Walls". Binns and Hardaker called their mix "the Zero 7 Mix", and the name stuck.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zeroing in on eclectic electronica|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060706/asp/calcutta/story_6420433.asp|website=The Telegraph – Calcutta|access-date=22 February 2015}}</ref>

In 1999, they released an [[Extended play|EP]] of original material called ''EP1'', under the name Zero 7. In 2001, they released their debut album, ''Simple Things'', which featured collaborations with vocalists [[Mozez]], [[Sia (musician)|Sia Furler]], and [[Sophie Barker]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zero 7 - Simple Things|url=https://www.discogs.com/Zero-7-Simple-Things/release/49594|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref> The album became a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]], was nominated for the [[Mercury Music Prize]], and won the "Best Newcomer" [[Muzik]] Award.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Muzik Magazine Dance Awards 2001|url=https://archive.org/details/muzik079_december_2001/page/n43/mode/2up|journal=Muzik Magazine|volume=December 2001|pages=45}}</ref> Live appearances after the album's release consisted of Binns and Hardaker along with guest vocalists and other musicians, with as many as 20 performers on stage at once.
