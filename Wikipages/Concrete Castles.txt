==History==

In 2009, five elementary aged friends from [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] formed '''M4''' (Mini Men Making Music), under the tutorage of guitar teacher Ryan Krysiak. After going through several lead vocalists who quit the band for different reasons, Audra Miller joined in 2013 and has been their lead singer since.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beardsley-Petit |first1=Karen |title=M4 -- teens make music, headlines |url=https://www.goerie.com/article/20150607/LIFESTYLE/610180361 |website=GoErie.com |access-date=27 July 2021}}</ref> In December 2015, the band changed their name to '''First to Eleven'''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yarborough |first1=Chuck |title=First to Eleven claims back-to-back Tri-C High School Rock Off (photos) |url=https://www.cleveland.com/rockoff/2016/02/first_to_eleven_wins_second_tr.html |website=cleveland.com |date=14 February 2016 |access-date=27 July 2021}}</ref> In 2016, they played at the [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carfer |first1=Grant |title=The Women of Warped Tour |url=https://www.sacurrent.com/sa-sound/archives/2016/06/21/the-women-of-warped-tour?page=5 |website=sacurrent.com |access-date=27 July 2021}}</ref> In 2017 and 2018 most of the original five members left the band for college, with only Matthew Yost remaining as a founding member.

In January 2021, First to Eleven’s [[YouTube]] channel reached one million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Geisler |first1=Jennie |title=From teen rockers to YouTube stars: Erie's First to Eleven at 1 million fans and growing |url=https://www.goerie.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/01/29/eries-first-to-eleven-hits-1-million-subscribers-youtube/4080141001/ |website=GoErie.com |access-date=27 July 2021}}</ref>
