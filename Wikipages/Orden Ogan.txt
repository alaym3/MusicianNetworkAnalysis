==History==
Founded in June 1996 as Tanzende Aingewaide, the band was renamed Orden Ogan in 1997. Orden Ogan means "The Order of Fear," Orden being the German word for Order, and Ogan being the Old Celtic word for Fear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockrevoltmagazine.com/interview-orden-ogan/| author=Cynthia Howarth | publisher=RockRevolt Magazine|date=2015-03-28| title=INTERVIEW: ORDEN OGAN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yn6fR7CAD0&t=0m21s | title = ORDEN OGAN &nbsp;– Ravenhead (2015) // Official Lyric Video // AFM Records | quote = ORDEN (noun): german word for a religious order; OGAN (noun): old celtic for >fear< | accessdate = 2021-10-09 | date = 2015-01-12 | publisher = YouTube of band's record label "AFM Records" | language = en}}</ref>  They released three [[Demo (music)|demo tapes]]: ''Into Oblivion'' (1998),<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Orden_Ogan/Into_Oblivion/11227 | title = Orden Ogan: Into Oblivion | accessdate = 2021-10-09 | date = 2020-11-29 | publisher = metal-archives.com | language = en}}</ref> ''Soli Deo Gloria'' (1999), and ''Testimonium A.D.''

The band considers its history to begin in 2008 with the release of their first studio album, ''Vale,'' which was released via Yonah Records in Germany, and met with acclaim by the European press.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The German magazine, Rock Hard Magazine, called the band "the one and only legitimate [[Blind Guardian]] successor".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} ''Vale'' was later released in Brazil and Japan in 2009. ''Vale'' is also the first of the band's albums to feature their mascot Alister Vale. The cover art on all of the band's studio albums are done by Andreas Marschall, who has also done cover art for bands such as Blind guardian. The band's songs may also include deeper meaning, but all studio albums include the loose concept of the story of their mascot Alister Vale, an immortal who is cursed and has to move on and on, but everything he leaves decays behind him. ''Orden Ogan'' participated in over 50 shows in 2008, with festivals such as Rock am Ring (Ger, Hi8 stage), Metal Healing in [[Greece]], Germany's Rock Harz, and the Metal Camp in [[Slovenia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockharz-festival.com/orden-ogan-3|title=ORDEN OGAN - ROCKHARZ Festival|website=Rockharz-festival.com|accessdate=14 October 2020}}</ref>

In 2010, Orden Ogan released their second studio album, ''Easton Hope,'' with their current label AFM Records. Following the release, Orden Ogan did their first European tour supporting Tiamat.
