Growing up on a council estate in east London, Green went on to become a multi-platinum artist, with 3.5 million combined sales in the UK. He is the former co-host of ''[[Lip Sync Battle UK]]'' on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].<ref Name="York">[https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/people/rapper-professor-green-announces-leeds-show-here-s-how-to-get-tickets-1-9905873 "Rapper Professor Green announces Leeds show", ''Yorkshire Evening Post''] 30 July 2019</ref> His autobiography featured on the ''Times'' bestseller list, and he is the patron of the [[suicide prevention]] [[Charitable_organization|charity]] [[Campaign Against Living Miserably|CALM]].<ref>[https://www.thecalmzone.net/about-calm/meet-the-team/ Calm] team.</ref>

==Early life==
Manderson's mother gave birth to him when she was 16 years old, splitting with the boy's father shortly after. At six weeks old he required a [[pyloromyotomy]] operation to his stomach.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Adam|date=2020|title=Dear NHS 100 Stories to say Thank You
|chapter=Professor Green}}</ref>  Manderson was raised by his grandmother, great-grandmother and uncles in a two bedroom flat on the Northwold housing estate in Clapton, [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London, in a home which he describes as chaotic. Green's great-grandmother Edie taught him to read and fed his intellectual curiosity as a child. When she died it had a great impact on him as they were so close.

He sold cannabis as a youngster and smoked it on a daily basis between the ages of 16 and 24. Although he was a bright student and dreamed of being a lawyer, he suffered from depression at the loss of his parents and he left Stoke Newington School in Clissold Road without any qualifications. <ref name=Swash100420/><ref Name=White>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/07/professor-green-white-working-class-boys-becoming-more-disengaged "Professor Green: white working-class boys becoming more disengaged"] 7 January 2018, Guardian</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p058dgnq |title=Professor Green: Is It Time To Legalise Weed? |publisher=BBC Three}}</ref><ref Name=Family>[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/23/professor-green-my-family-values "Professor Green: My family values", Guardian, 25 January 2015]</ref>
