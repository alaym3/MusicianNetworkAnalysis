'''The Kingsmen''' are a 1960s [[garage rock]] band from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, United States. They are best known for their 1963 recording of [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]]'s "[[Louie Louie]]", which held the No.&nbsp;2 spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for six weeks and has become an enduring classic.

In total, the Kingsmen charted 11 single releases from 1963 to 1968 and five consecutive albums from 1963 to 1966.  Their first album, ''[[The Kingsmen in Person]]'', remained on the [[Billboard Top LPs|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart for 131 weeks from January 1964 to August 1966.  Their early albums were released internationally in Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, and Taiwan.

==Early years==
In 1957, Lynn Easton invited [[Jack Ely]] to play with him at a Portland Hotel gig, with Ely singing and playing guitar and Easton on the [[drum kit]].<ref name=Marsh85>Marsh 1993, p. 85</ref> The two teenagers had grown up together, as their parents were close friends.<ref name=Marsh85/> Easton and Ely performed at local parties and events, and soon added Mike Mitchell on guitar and Bob Nordby on bass to round out the band. They called themselves the Kingsmen, taking the name from a recently disbanded group.<ref>Marsh 1993, p. 86</ref> The Kingsmen began their collective career playing at fashion shows, [[Red Cross]] events, and supermarket promotions, generally avoiding rock songs on their setlist.<ref>Marsh 1993, p. 87</ref> In 1962, Don Gallucci, a high school freshman at the time, was recruited from another local group, the Royal Notes, to play keyboards.<ref name="Predoehl2020">{{cite web|title=RIP: Lynn Easton of the Kingsmen|publisher=The Louie Report|url=http://www.louielouie.net/blog/?p=11519|date=April 28, 2020|first=Eric|last=Predoehl}}</ref>

=="Louie Louie"==
In 1962, while playing a gig at the Pypo Club in [[Seaside, Oregon]], then managed by Al Dardis, the band noticed [[Rockin' Robin Roberts]]'s version of "[[Louie Louie]]" being played on the jukebox for hours on end. The entire club would get up and dance.<ref>Blecha 2009, p. 134</ref> Ely convinced the Kingsmen to learn the song, which they played at dances to a great crowd response.<ref>Blecha 2009, p. 135</ref> Unknown to him, he changed the beat because he misheard it on a jukebox.<ref name=Marsh83>Marsh 1993, p. 83</ref> Ken Chase, host of radio station [[KISN (Portland)|KISN]], formed his own club to capitalize on these dance crazes.<ref>Blecha 2009, p. 136</ref> Dubbed "The Chase", the Kingsmen became the club's [[house band]] and Ken Chase became the band's manager. On April 5, 1963, Chase booked the band an hour-long session at the local Northwestern Inc. studio for the following day to record a demo tape for a summer cruise ship gig.{{sfn|Blecha|2009|page=137}} Adding to the hurried atmosphere, the band had just played a 90-minute "Louie Louie" marathon the night before.{{sfn|Marsh|1993|page=88}}

Despite the band's annoyance at having so little time to prepare, on April 6 at 10&nbsp;am the Kingsmen walked into the three-microphone recording studio. "[[Jamaica Farewell]]", one partial and one full take of "Louie Louie", and "Haunted Castle" were recorded.{{sfn|Peterson|2005|pages=45-57}} For "Louie Louie", the only vocal number, Ely was forced to lean back and sing to a microphone suspended from the ceiling. "It was more yelling than singing," Ely said, "'cause I was trying to be heard over all the instruments."{{sfn|Blecha|2009|page=137}} In addition, he was wearing [[Dental braces|braces]] at the time of the performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hayes|first=Ron|title=Rock's Rumored Dirtiest Song Turns 30|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eM5eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7zIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3814,3358820&dq=jack+ely+braces&hl=en|access-date=July 19, 2012|newspaper=[[Lewiston Morning Tribune]]|date=August 13, 1993}}</ref> Ely sang the beginning of the third verse two bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. The Kingsmen were not proud of the recording and wanted to fix their mistakes, but Chase liked the energy and rawness,{{sfn|Blecha|2009|page=138}} and assured them that the demo version could be redone before a record was released.{{sfn|Peterson|2005|page=54}} The one hour session cost either $36{{sfn|Peterson|2005|page=47}}, $50{{sfn|Blecha|2009|page=138}}, or somewhere in between {{sfn|Marsh|1993|page=98}} and the band split the cost.

With a competing "Louie Louie" version from Paul Revere and the Raiders getting heavy play on a competing station, Chase began playing the Kingsmen's demo version on his show at KISN. He then contracted with Jerry Dennon's Jerden Records to press a single.{{sfn|Blecha|2009|page=139}} The B-side was "Haunted Castle", composed by Ely and [[Don Gallucci]], the new keyboardist; however, Lynn Easton was credited on both the [[Jerden Records|Jerden]] and [[Wand Records|Wand]] releases.{{sfn|Blecha|2009|page=156}}  

"Louie Louie" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] chart and No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Additionally it reached No.&nbsp;1 on the [[CHUM Chart|CHUM]] Canada chart and in the UK it reached No.&nbsp;26 on the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Wand issued a re-release in 1966 as "Louie Louie 64-65-66" and it re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No.&nbsp;97.

The band attracted nationwide attention when "Louie Louie" was banned by the [[governor of Indiana]], [[Matthew E. Welsh]], also attracting the attention of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]] because of alleged indecent [[song lyrics|lyrics]] in their version of the song. The lyrics were, in fact, innocent, but Ely's baffling enunciation permitted teenage fans and concerned parents alike to imagine the most scandalous obscenities. (Ironically, the FBI totally missed Lynn Easton yelling "Fuck!" at 0:54 after fumbling a drum fill). All of this attention only made the song more popular. In April 1966 "Louie Louie" was reissued and once again hit the music charts, reaching No.&nbsp;65 on the ''Cashbox'' chart and No.&nbsp;97 on the ''Billboard Hot 100'' chart.

In 1985, [[Ross Shafer]], host and a writer-performer of the late-night comedy series ''[[Almost Live!]]'' on the [[Seattle]] TV station [[KING-TV|KING]], spearheaded an effort to have "Louie Louie" replace "[[Washington, My Home]]" by Helen Davis as [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]].<ref>''Seattle Weekly'' (October 27, 1999) Music: [http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9943/two-reighley.php "The State I'm In"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821164549/http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9943/two-reighley.php |date=August 21, 2006}}, by Kurt B. Reighley</ref> Picking up on this initially prankish effort, [[Whatcom County]] Councilman Craig Cole introduced Resolution No. 85-12 in the state legislature, citing the need for a "contemporary [[Theme music|theme song]] that can be used to engender a sense of pride and community, and in the enhancement of tourism and economic development". His resolution also called for the creation of a new "Louie Louie County". While the House did not pass it, the Senate's Resolution 1985-37 declared April 12, 1985, "Louie Louie Day". A crowd of 4,000, estimated by press reports, convened at the [[Washington State Capitol|state capitol]] that day for speeches, singalongs, and performances by the Wailers, the Kingsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders. Two days later, a Seattle event commemorated the occasion with the premiere performance of a new, Washington-centric version of the song written by composer Berry.<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~tdg/dg/Comps/rhino2.html Liner notes, ''The Best Of Louie Louie Volume 2''] (Rhino R1 70515), by Doc Pelzell</ref>

Over the years the Kingsmen's version of "Louie Louie" has been recognized by organizations and publications worldwide for its influence on the history of [[rock and roll]].  Rankings and recognition in major publications and surveys are shown in the table below.

==Kingsmen history==
[[File:The Kingsmen 1966.jpg|thumb|left|The Kingsmen in 1966. Clockwise from lower left: Lynn Easton, J.C. Rieck, Kerry Magness, Mike Mitchell, Dick Peterson]]
Before the success of "Louie Louie", the members of the Kingsmen took varied paths. Easton, whose mother had registered the name of the group and therefore owned it, declared that from this point on he intended to be the singer, forcing Ely to play the drums. This led Jack Ely and Bob Nordby to quit the group in 1963, and Gary Abbott and Norm Sundholm were added to play drums and bass, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artists' Biographies – The Kingsmen|work=Billboard|date=December 14, 1963|access-date=May 15, 2019|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-IDX/IDX/1963/Billboard-1963-12-14-OCR-Page-0014.pdf}}</ref>

Don Gallucci was forced out because he wasn't old enough to tour and later formed [[Don and the Goodtimes]], which morphed into the short-lived [[Touch (60s band)|Touch]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Cash-Box-IDX/70s/1979/CB-1979-10-10-OCR-Page-0034.pdf|title=Producer's Profile – Don Gallucci|date=October 10, 1979|publisher=[[Cash Box]] magazine|access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref> Later, Gallucci became a record producer with [[Elektra Records]], with his most famous production being [[the Stooges]]' seminal second album ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]''. ("Louie Louie" was frequently performed at Stooges concerts; the song appears on their live album as well as an [[Iggy Pop]] solo record.)

The two remaining original Kingsmen, Lynn Easton and Mike Mitchell, were joined by Gary Abbott, Barry Curtis and Norm Sundholm to record their first album and tour as the official band.  Dick Peterson replaced Gary Abbott shortly thereafter.  This line-up stayed intact from 1964 into 1966 and charted multiple singles and albums with Easton as the principal vocalist.

After Ely's departure and considerable chart success by the new line-up, the group learned that he was performing with another group as The Kingsmen.<ref>Peterson 2005, p. 325.</ref> Following [[Law|legal action]], a settlement was reached and Easton, Mitchell, Peterson, Curtis and Sundholm established their rights to the "Kingsmen" name. Thus, Ely was forced to stop using the name, Easton was forced to stop [[lip sync]]ing to Ely's vocals, and subsequent releases of "Louie Louie" were required to have the text "Lead vocal by Jack Ely" below the title.  Unable to perform using the Kingsmen name, Ely continued with his groups the Squires and the Courtmen.  He also received a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] for "Louie Louie" as part of the settlement.<ref>Peterson 2005, p. 327.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Settle Kingsmen vs Jack Ely Litigation|date=February 2, 1966|publisher=Cash Box magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Cash-Box-IDX/60s/1966/CB-1966-02-12-OCR-Page-0007.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/60s/1966/BB-1966-02-12.pdf|title=Court Tells Ely & Kingsmen to Use a Different Billing|date=February 12, 1966|page=7|work=Billboard|access-date=May 15, 2019}}</ref>

The Kingsmen's 1964 follow up to "Louie Louie" was a party version of "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]" which hit the ''Billboard Hot 100'' at No.&nbsp;16 and on ''Cashbox'' at No.&nbsp;17. Then came "[[Little Latin Lupe Lu]]" peaking on ''Billboard'' at No.&nbsp;46 and ''Cashbox'' at No.&nbsp;49. After that it was "Death of An Angel" No.&nbsp;33 on Cashbox and No.&nbsp;42 on Billboard.

1965 saw the Kingsmen return to the Top 10 nationally with "[[The Jolly Green Giant]]" reaching No.&nbsp;4 on Billboard and No.&nbsp;8 on Cashbox. The novelty number also made No.&nbsp;25 on the Billboard R&B chart and hit No.&nbsp;1 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] Canada chart. The follow-up song was "The Climb", No.&nbsp;45 on Cashbox and No.&nbsp;65 on Billboard. "Annie Fanny" was released next reaching No.&nbsp;43 on Cashbox and No.&nbsp;47 on Billboard. Next came "(You Got) The Gamma Goochee", No.&nbsp;98 on Cashbox and No.&nbsp;122 on Billboard.  The group also appeared in the [[beach party film|beach party movie]] ''[[How to Stuff a Wild Bikini]]'' singing "Give Her Lovin'" (released as a B-side to "Annie Fanny") which appeared on the soundtrack album along with their recording of the title song.

In 1966 the Kingsmen continued to hit the charts with "Killer Joe" reaching No.&nbsp;77 on Billboard and No.&nbsp;81 on Cashbox. Their original recording of "Louie Louie" was re-released as "Louie Louie 64-65-66" and re-entered the Billboard chart at No.&nbsp;97. In 1967 they made the chart for the last time with "Bo Diddley Bach" reaching No.&nbsp;128 on Billboard.

Lynn Easton left the group in 1967. He worked for an advertising firm and hosted a "bandstand-type" show for a Portland television station.<ref>{{cite web|title=Giant Easton Launches Weekly Seg on KGW-TV|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/60s/1967/Billboard%201967-10-28.pdf|work=Billboard|page=55|date=October 28, 1967|access-date=May 15, 2019}}</ref>

In late 1968 with the original group on a recording and touring hiatus, the Kingsmen's management team worked with the [[Jerry Kasenetz|Kasenetz]]-[[Jeffry Katz|Katz]] production organization and studio musicians to release a single on the Earth label ("Feed Me"/"Just A 'B' Side").<ref>Released on Earth 104. Lead singers were C. L. Weldon on "Feed Me" and [[Joey Levine]] on "Just A 'B' Side".</ref> A separate lineup was formed with new members (including lead singer [[Yank Barry]]) to tour for a time during 1968–1969 on the East Coast of the United States while the main lineup of the band was inactive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.louielouie.org/modules.php?name=Kingsmen_Lineup |title=Kingsmen web site historical page |access-date=May 29, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316060331/http://www.louielouie.org/modules.php?name=Kingsmen_Lineup |archive-date=March 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/yank-barry|newspaper=[[National Post]]|first=Joe|last=O'Connor|date=April 15, 2012 |title=The world according to Yank: Montrealer with checkered past gets Nobel nod, or does he?|access-date=January 21, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=Clarification/>

In 1973 the reactivated group signed with [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] and released one single which did not chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Cash-Box-IDX/70s/1973/Cash-Box-1973-03-24-OCR-Page-0014.pdf|title=Kingsmen to Capitol|publisher=[[Cash Box]] magazine|date=March 24, 1973|access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Cash-Box-IDX/70s/1976/Cash-Box-1973-03-31-OCR-Page-0018.pdf|title=Picks of the Week|publisher=[[Cash Box]] magazine|date=March 31, 1973|access-date=May 15, 2019}}</ref>

On November 9, 1998, the Kingsmen were awarded ownership of all their early recordings released on [[Wand Records]] from [[Gusto Records]], including "Louie Louie". They had not been paid royalties on the songs since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-IDX/IDX/1995/Billboard-1995-07-08-OCR-Page-0009.pdf|title=Kingsmen to Reclaim Master Recordings|date=July 8, 1995|access-date=May 15, 2019|work=Billboard|first=Chris|last=Morris}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-IDX/IDX/1998/Billboard-1998-11-21-OCR-Page-0008.pdf|title=Kingsmen Prevail in Contract Suit|date=November 21, 1998|access-date=May 15, 2019|work=Billboard|first=Bill|last=Holland}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.louielouie.org/lawsuitinfo.htm |title=Louielouie.org |access-date=October 10, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719034045/http://www.louielouie.org/lawsuitinfo.htm |archive-date=July 19, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

;Discography Notes
{{notelist}}

==Other uses of the name==
Prior to this group's formation, another group called The Kingsmen operated in 1958 and was made up of members of [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] who were moonlighting from their regular work with Haley. This group scored a [[hit record]] (#35) on Billboard with the instrumental entitled "Week End", written by [[Rudy Pompilli]], [[Franny Beecher]], and [[Billy Williamson (guitarist)|Billy Williamson]], backed with "Better Believe It" as the B side. They released a follow-up single on East West Records featuring "The Catwalk" backed with "Conga Rock". Although the Comets did the actual recordings, when the Kingsmen went on tour a different set of musicians performed instead of Haley's people. The band made at least one appearance on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' in 1958.

Many other groups have used the name "The Kingsmen", including a [[gospel music|gospel]] [[List of vocal groups|vocal group]] formed in 1956 (also referred to as [[The Kingsmen Quartet]]), and bands that were later renamed as [[Flamin' Groovies]], [[The Gants]] and [[The Statler Brothers]]. An [[a cappella]] group at [[Columbia University]] is traditionally known as the Kingsmen; former members include [[Art Garfunkel]] and the original lineup of [[Sha Na Na]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Peterson|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Billboard-Index/IDX/1978/1978-07-15-Billboard-Page-0044.pdf|work=Billboard|date=July 15, 1978|title=Woodstock to Prime Time – A 10 Year Rock Odyssey|access-date=May 15, 2019}}</ref>
