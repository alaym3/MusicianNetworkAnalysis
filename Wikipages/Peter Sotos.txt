'''Peter Sotos''' (born April 17, 1960) is an American writer and musician. In his books, Sotos examines [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] [[sex crime|sexual criminals]] and [[sexual abuse|sexually violent]] pornography, particularly [[child pornography|involving children]]. His writings are interpreted by some as commenting on media hypocrisy around these issues. His books are often first person narratives, taking on the [[point of view (literature)|point of view]] of the [[sexual predator]] in order to explore sadistic and [[pedophilia|pedophilic]] sexual impulses.

== Early life ==
Sotos is a graduate of [[Holy Cross High School (River Grove, Illinois)|Holy Cross High School]]. He attended [[Northern Illinois University]] for one year and studied at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] for four years.

== ''Pure'' magazine and after ==

In 1984, while the [[day care sex abuse hysteria]] phenomenon was sweeping the nation and while attending the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], Sotos began producing the controversial magazine ''Pure'', notable as the first [[zine]] dedicated to [[serial killer]] lore. The original publications are now collectors' items.

In addition to offering many details about the crimes of serial killers and Nazis, the text in the magazine praises them, describing them using such terms as "genius", "glorious", "exemplary", and "illustrious". The text is juxtaposed with pictures and newspaper clippings relevant to the crimes discussed, showing that the media also abuses the victims. A short [[manifesto]] introducing the first issue says the magazine "satiates and encourages true lusts."

A photocopy from a magazine of [[child pornography]] was used as the cover of issue #2 of ''Pure'' which led to Sotos pleading guilty to possession of child pornography, receiving a suspended sentence. A copy of the magazine was found by [[Scotland Yard]] in Edinburgh, in the home of a suspect in a series of child abductions, murders and grave robbings, which led to Sotos' arrest.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-06/news/8503240469_1_child-pornography-case-illegal-magazines-child-abuse | title=$100,000 Bond in Child Pornography Case | author=Linnet Myers and Dave Schneidman | date=December 6, 1985 | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref>

Despite his early legal troubles, Sotos continues to garner support for his ideas and literary output: in the foreword to the French edition of ''Index'' (1999) the publisher [[Jean-Jacques Pauvert]] compared him to [[Marquis de Sade]]; the American author [[Bruce Benderson]] has been analyzing his writings for ''[[La Nouvelle Revue Française]]'';<ref>[http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/La-Nouvelle-Revue-Francaise/La-Nouvelle-Revue-Francaise473 ''NRF'' #577 (April 2006)]</ref> in 2012 Sotos joined [[Dennis Cooper]] for a lecture at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]];<ref>[https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cazjxRB/rgq8y7 Centre Pompidou: Peter Sotos — ''Mine Kept'']</ref> in 2015 the German contemporary art magazine ''[[Texte zur Kunst]]'' published “Proxy: Peter Sotos in Conversation”.<ref>[https://www.textezurkunst.de/98 ''Texte zur Kunst'' #98: ''Media'' (June 2015)]</ref>
