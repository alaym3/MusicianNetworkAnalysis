'''Uncle Sam''' (which has the same initials as ''[[United States]]'') is a common [[national personification]] of the [[federal government of the United States]] or the country in general that, according to legend, came into use during the [[War of 1812]] and was supposedly named for [[Samuel Wilson]]. The actual origin is obscure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schauffler|first1=Robert Haven|title=Flag day; its history|date=1912|page=[https://archive.org/details/flagdayitshistor00scha/page/145 145]|url=https://archive.org/details/flagdayitshistor00scha|publisher=New York : Moffat, Yard and Co}}</ref> Since the early 19th century, Uncle Sam has been a popular symbol of the US government in [[American culture]] and a manifestation of patriotic emotion.<ref name="T.A.

== Earlier personifications ==
[[File:ColumbiaStahrArtwork.jpg|thumb|Columbia]]
The earliest known personification of the United States was as a woman named [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], who first appeared in 1738 (pre-US) and sometimes was associated with another female personification, [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]]. With the [[American Revolutionary War]] came [[Brother Jonathan]], a male personification, and Uncle Sam finally appeared after the [[War of 1812]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Uncle Sam|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614065/Uncle-Sam.|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|access-date=June 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120172843/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614065/Uncle-Sam.|archive-date=January 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Columbia (personification)|Columbia]] appeared with either [[Brother Jonathan]] or Uncle Sam, but her use declined as a national personification in favor of Liberty, and she was effectively abandoned once she became the mascot of [[Columbia Pictures]] in the 1920s.

According to an article in the 1893 ''[[The Lutheran Witness]]'', Uncle Sam was simply another name for [[Brother Jonathan]]:

<blockquote>When we meet him in politics we call him Uncle Sam; when we meet him in society we call him [[Brother Jonathan]].  Here of late Uncle Sam ''alias'' [[Brother Jonathan]] has been doing a powerful lot of complaining, hardly doing anything else. {{sic}}<ref>December 7, 1893 "A Bit of Advice" ''The Lutheran Witness'' he pg 100</ref></blockquote>

A March 24, 1810, journal entry by Isaac Mayo (a midshipman in the [[US Navy]]) states:
<blockquote>weighed anchor stood down the harbor, passed [[Sandy Hook]], where there are two light-houses, and put to sea, first and the second day out most deadly seasick, oh could I have got onshore in the hight [''sic''] of it, I swear that uncle Sam, as they call him, would certainly forever have lost the services of at least one sailor.<ref name=newlight>{{cite web|author=Zimmer, Ben|date=July 4, 2013 |title=New Light on "Uncle Sam" referencing work at USS Constitution Museum in Charlestown, Mass|url=http://www.vocabulary.com/articles/wordroutes/new-light-on-uncle-sam/|access-date=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703024112/http://www.vocabulary.com/articles/wordroutes/new-light-on-uncle-sam/|archive-date=July 3, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>

The precise origin of the Uncle Sam character is unclear, but a popular legend is that the name "Uncle Sam" was derived from [[Samuel Wilson]], a [[meatpacker]] from [[Troy, New York]], who supplied rations for American soldiers during the War of 1812. There was a requirement at the time for contractors to stamp their name and where the rations came from onto the food they were sending. Wilson's packages were labeled "E.A.—U.S." When someone asked what that stood for, a co-worker jokingly said, "[[Elbert Anderson]] [the contractor] and Uncle Sam," referring to Wilson, though the ''U.S.'' actually stood for "United States".<ref>Wyandott Herald, Kansas City, August 17, 1882, p. 2</ref> Doubts have been raised as to the authenticity of this story, as the claim did not appear in print until 1842.<ref>{{cite web|work=Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, Volume 19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ4pAAAAYAAJ&q=%22samuel+wilson%22+%22the+most+popular+explanation%22&pg=PA47|title=Uncle Sam|author=Matthews, Albert|date=1908|access-date=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003080711/https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ4pAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA47&dq=%22samuel+wilson%22+%22the+most+popular+explanation%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dZqVVZ3ZEsPfsAXCgI-IBA&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20wilson%22%20%22the%20most%20popular%20explanation%22&f=false|archive-date=October 3, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, the earliest known mention definitely referring to the metaphorical Uncle Sam is from 1810, predating Wilson's contract with the government.<ref name=newlight/> As early as 1835, [[Brother Jonathan]] made a reference to Uncle Sam, implying that they symbolized different things: Brother Jonathan was the country itself, while Uncle Sam was the government and its power.<ref>Morgan, Winifred (1988). ''An American icon: Brother Jonathan and American identity''. [[University of Delaware Press]]. pg. 81.</ref>

By the 1850s, the names [[Brother Jonathan]] and Uncle Sam were being used nearly interchangeably, to the point that images of what had previously been called "Brother Jonathan" were being called "Uncle Sam". Similarly, the appearance of both personifications varied wildly. For example, one depiction of Uncle Sam in 1860 showed him looking like [[Benjamin Franklin]],<ref>An appearance echoed in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', June 3, 1865 "Checkmate" political cartoon (Morgan, Winifred (1988) ''An American icon: Brother Jonathan and American identity'' University of Delaware Press pg 95)</ref> while a contemporaneous depiction of [[Brother Jonathan]]<ref>On page 32 of the January 11, 1862, edition ''Harper's Weekly.''</ref> looks more like the modern version of Uncle Sam, though without a [[goatee]].

Uncle Sam did not get a standard appearance, even with the effective abandonment of Brother Jonathan near the end of the [[American Civil War]], until the well-known recruitment image of Uncle Sam was first created by [[James Montgomery Flagg]] during [[World War&nbsp;I]]. The image was inspired by a British recruitment [[Lord Kitchener Wants You|poster]] showing [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in a similar pose. It is this image more than any other that has influenced the modern appearance of Uncle Sam: an elderly white man with white hair and a [[goatee]], wearing a white [[top hat]] with white stars on a blue band, a blue [[tail coat]], and red-and-white-striped trousers.

Flagg's depiction of Uncle Sam was shown publicly for the first time, according to some, on the cover of the magazine ''[[Leslie's Weekly]]'' on July&nbsp;6, 1916, with the caption "What Are You Doing for Preparedness?"<ref name="loc" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/mysteries/080630-uncle-sam.html | title=Who Created Uncle Sam? | publisher=Live Science | work=Life's Little Mysteries | access-date=February 16, 2012 | archive-date=December 3, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203113644/http://www.livescience.com/mysteries/080630-uncle-sam.html}}</ref> More than four&nbsp;million copies of this image were printed between 1917 and 1918. Flagg's image was also used extensively during [[World War&nbsp;II]], during which the US was codenamed "Samland" by the German intelligence agency [[Abwehr]].<ref>Macintyre, Ben. ''Operation Mincemeat'', p. 57. {{ISBN|978-1-4088-0921-1}}</ref> The term was central in the song "[[The Yankee Doodle Boy]]", which was featured in 1942 in the musical ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]''.

There are two memorials to Uncle Sam, both of which commemorate the life of Samuel Wilson: the [[Uncle Sam Memorial Statue]] in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]], his birthplace; and a memorial near his long-term residence in Riverfront Park, [[Troy, New York]]. Wilson's boyhood home can still be visited in [[Mason, New Hampshire]]. Samuel Wilson died on July&nbsp;31, 1854, aged 87, and is buried in [[Oakwood Cemetery (Troy, New York)|Oakwood Cemetery]], Troy, New York.

In 1976, Uncle Sam was depicted in "[[United States Bicentennial|Our Nation's 200th Birthday]], [[Invention of the telephone|The Telephone's 100th Birthday]]" by [[Stanley Meltzoff]] for [[Bell System]].<ref>[https://www.jklmuseum.com/tag/stanley-meltzoff/ "Stanley Meltzoff Archives: The 1976 Bell System Telephone Book Cover"] [[JKL Museum of Telephony]] (December 19, 2015); retrieved March 16, 2021</ref>

In 1989, "Uncle Sam Day" became official. A Congressional joint resolution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d100:HJ00626:@@@X|title=Bill Summary & Status – 100th Congress (1987–1988) – H.J.RES.626 – All Congressional Actions – THOMAS (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov|access-date=September 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705024845/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d100:HJ00626:@@@X|archive-date=July 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> designated September&nbsp;13, 1989, as "Uncle Sam Day", the birthday of [[Samuel Wilson]].
