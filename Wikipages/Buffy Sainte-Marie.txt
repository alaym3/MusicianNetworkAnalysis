In 1964, on a return trip to the Piapot Cree reserve in Canada for a [[powwow]], she was welcomed and (in a Cree Nation context) adopted by the youngest son of Chief [[Piapot]], Emile Piapot and his wife, Clara Starblanket Piapot, who added to Sainte-Marie's cultural value and place in native culture.<ref name="DirectorsCut">''Buffy Sainte-Marie: A Multimedia Life (Director's Cut)'' DVD, distributed by Filmwest Associates of Canada and the US, [http://www.filmwest.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630112629/http://www.filmwest.com/ |date=June 30, 2019 }}, 2006</ref>

Although not a Baháʼí herself, she became an active friend of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] and has appeared at concerts, conferences and conventions of that religion. In 1992, she appeared in the musical event prelude to the [[Baháʼí World Congress]], a double concert "Live Unity: The Sound of the World" in 1992 with video broadcast and documentary.<ref>[http://info.bahai.org/article-1-9-2-2.html Baháʼís and the Arts: Language of the Heart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026122949/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-9-2-2.html# |date=October 26, 2012 }} by Ann Boyles, also published in 1994–95 edition of ''The Baháʼí World'', pgs. 243–72</ref> In the video documentary of the event Sainte-Marie is seen on the ''[[Dini Petty]] Show'' explaining the Baháʼí teaching of [[Progressive revelation (Baháʼí)|progressive revelation]].<ref>''Live Unity:The Sound of the World'' A Concert Documentary, VCR Video, distributed by Unity Arts Inc., of Canada, © Live Unity Enterprises, Inc., 1992</ref> She also appears in the 1985 video ''Mona With The Children'' by Douglas John Cameron.

==Career==
Sainte-Marie plays piano and guitar, self-taught in her childhood and teen years. In college some of her songs, "Ananias", the Indian lament, "[[Now That the Buffalo's Gone]]" and "Mayoo Sto Hoon" (a cover of a [[Hindi]] [[Bollywood]] song "Mayus To Hoon Waade Se Tere" sung by the Indian singer [[Mohammed Rafi]] from the 1960 movie [['Barsaat Ki Raat]]) were already in her repertoire.<ref name="moonshot"/>

By 1962, in her early twenties, she was touring alone, developing her craft and performing in various concert halls, folk music festivals and [[First Nations]] reservations across the United States, Canada and abroad. She spent a considerable amount of time in the coffeehouses of downtown Toronto's old [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] district, and New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] as part of the early to mid-1960s folk scene, often alongside other emerging Canadian contemporaries, such as [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Joni Mitchell]]. (She also introduced Mitchell to [[Elliot Roberts]], who became Joni's manager.)<ref name="DirectorsCut"/>

In 1963, recovering from a throat infection, Sainte-Marie became addicted to [[codeine]] and recovering from the experience became the basis of her song "[[Cod'ine]]",<ref name="profiles"/> later covered by [[Donovan]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Charlatans (American band)|the Charlatans]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Man (band)|Man]],<ref>On their album ''[[Maximum Darkness]]''</ref> [[the Litter]], [[the Leaves]], [[Jimmy Gilmer]], [[Gram Parsons]],<ref>On ''Another Side of This Life: The Lost Recordings of Gram Parsons 1965–1966''</ref> Charles Brutus McClay,<ref>Charles Brutus McClay – "Bottled in France", released 1970 by CBS France, cat.nr.64478</ref> [[the Barracudas]] (spelled "Codeine"),<ref>The Barracudas – "Drop Out with The Barracudas", released 1981 by Zonophone, cat.nr.ZONO103</ref> [[The Golden Horde (band)|the Golden Horde]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/the-golden-horde/codeine-live-london-1991|title=Codeine (live, London, 1991) by The Golden Horde on SoundCloud|publisher=Soundcloud.com|date=March 9, 2012|access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref> [[Nicole Atkins]] and [[Courtney Love]].

She was subsequently named [[Billboard Magazine|''Billboard'' magazine]]'s Best New Artist. Some of her songs addressing the mistreatment of Native Americans, such as "[[Now That the Buffalo's Gone]]" (1964) and
"[[Little Wheel Spin and Spin|My Country 'Tis of Thy People You're Dying]]" (1964, included on her 1966 album), created controversy at the time.<ref name="encyc-great-plains"/> In 1967, she released ''[[Fire & Fleet & Candlelight]]'', which contained her interpretation of the traditional [[Yorkshire dialect]] song "[[Lyke Wake Dirge]]". Sainte-Marie's other well-known songs include "[[Mister Can't You See]]", (a [[Top 40]] U.S. hit in 1972); "He's an Indian Cowboy in the Rodeo"; and the theme song of the movie ''[[Soldier Blue]]''. She appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s ''[[Rainbow Quest|Rainbow Quest with Pete Seeger]]'' in 1965 and several Canadian Television productions from the 1960s to the 1990s,<ref name="DirectorsCut"/> and other TV shows such as ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''; and sang the opening song "The Circle Game" (written by Joni Mitchell<ref name="DirectorsCut"/>) in Stuart Hagmann's film ''[[The Strawberry Statement (film)|The Strawberry Statement]]'' (1970) ''[[Then Came Bronson]]''; episode 20 "Mating Dance for Tender Grass" (1970) sang and acted.

In the late 1960s, she used a [[Buchla]] synthesizer to record the album ''Illuminations'', which did not receive much notice. It was the first totally [[quadraphonic]] electronic vocal album. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

She appeared in "The Heritage" episode of ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', that first aired on October 30, 1968.

In late 1975, Sainte-Marie received a phone call from  ''[[Sesame Street]]'' producer [[Dulcy Singer]] to appear on the show for a one-shot guest appearance. Sainte-Marie told Singer she had no interest in doing a children's TV show, but reconsidered after asking "Have you done any Native American programming?" According to Sainte-Marie, Singer wanted her to count and recite the alphabet but Buffy wanted to teach the show's young viewers that "Indians still exist".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} She regularly appeared on ''Sesame Street'' over a five-year period from 1976 to 1981. Sainte-Marie breastfed her first son, Dakota "Cody" Starblanket Wolfchild, during a 1977 episode, which is believed to be the first representation of breastfeeding ever aired on television.<ref>

''Sesame Street'' aired a week of shows from her home in Hawaii in January 1978.

Sainte-Marie's closest friend from the ''Sesame Street'' cast was [[Alaina Reed Hall|Alaina Reed]], who played [[List of human Sesame Street characters|Olivia Robinson]] on the show and later joined the cast of ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''.

In 1979, ''[[Spirit of the Wind]]'', featuring Sainte-Marie's original musical score, including the song "Spirit of the Wind", was one of three entries that year at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The film is a docudrama about [[George Attla]], the 'winningest [[dog musher]] of all time', as the film presents him, with all parts played by Native Americans except one by [[Slim Pickens]]. The film was shown on cable TV in the early 1980s and was released in France in 2003.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===1980s===
Sainte-Marie began using [[Apple II]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053236/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_n5_v37/ai_12287153 Names under the sun: Buffy Sainte-Marie – multi-awarded native American singer makes a comeback] Los Angeles Business Journal, May 1992 by Michael Logan.</ref> and [[Macintosh]] computers as early as 1981 to record her music and later some of her visual art.<ref name="moonshot"/> The song "[[Up Where We Belong]]" (which Sainte-Marie co-wrote with [[Will Jennings]] and musician [[Jack Nitzsche]]) was performed by [[Joe Cocker]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] for the film ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]''. It received the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1982.<ref name = "OscarBSM"/>

In the early 1980s one of her native songs was used as the theme song for the [[CBC Television|CBC]]'s native series [[Spirit Bay (TV series)|Spirit Bay]]. She was cast for the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] 1993 telefilm ''The Broken Chain''. It was shot entirely in [[Virginia]]. In 1989 she wrote and performed the music for ''[[Where the Spirit Lives]]'', a film about native children being abducted and forced into residential schools.

===1990s===
[[File:Buffy Sainte-Marie July 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|Buffy Sainte-Marie playing the [[Peterborough Summer Festival of Lights]] on June 24, 2009]]
Sainte-Marie voiced the Cheyenne character, Kate Bighead, in the 1991 made-for-TV movie ''[[Son of the Morning Star]]'', telling the Indian side of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], where [[Sioux]] Chief [[Sitting Bull]] defeated [[George Armstrong Custer|Lt. Col. George Custer]].

In 1992, after a sixteen-year recording hiatus, Sainte-Marie released the album ''[[Coincidence and Likely Stories]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Recorded in 1990 at home in Hawaii on her computer and transmitted via modem through the Internet to producer Chris Birkett in London, England,<ref name="DirectorsCut" /> the album included the politically charged songs "The Big Ones Get Away" and "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" (which mentions [[Leonard Peltier]]), both commenting on the ongoing plight of Native Americans (see also the [[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee|book]] and [[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (film)|film]] with the same name'')''. Also in 1992, Sainte-Marie appeared in the television film ''[[The Broken Chain]]'' with [[Wes Studi]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]] along with First Nations Baháʼí [[Phil Lucas]]. Her next album followed up in 1996 with ''Up Where We Belong'', an album on which she re-recorded a number of her greatest hits in more unplugged and acoustic versions, including a re-release of "[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]". Sainte-Marie has exhibited her art at the [[Glenbow Museum]] in Calgary, the [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]], the [[Emily Carr]] Gallery in [[Vancouver]] and the American Indian Arts Museum in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. In 1995, she provided the voice of the spirit in the magic mirror in HBO's ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', which featured a Native American retelling of the Snow White fairy tale.

Also in 1995, the [[Indigo Girls]] released two versions of Sainte-Marie's protest song "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" on their live album ''[[1200 Curfews]]''. The song appears toward the end of Disc One in a live format, recorded at the Atwood Concert Hall in the [[Alaska Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Anchorage]], Alaska. "Every word is true", Emily says in the introduction. The second, found at the end of Disc Two, is a studio recording.

In 1996, she started a philanthropic non-profit fund [[Nihewan Foundation for American Indian Education]] devoted to improving Native American students’ participation in learning. The word "Nihewan" comes from the Cree language and means "talk Cree", which implies "Be Your Culture".

Sainte-Marie founded the [[Cradleboard Teaching Project]] in October 1996 using funds from her Nihewan Foundation and with a two-year grant from the [[W.K. Kellogg Foundation]] of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]. With projects across [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], [[Cree]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Menominee]], [[Coeur D'Alene Tribe|Coeur D'Alene]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Quinault (tribe)|Quinault]], [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]], and [[Apache]] communities in eleven states, partnered with a non-native class of the same grade level for Elementary, [[Middle school|Middle]], and High School grades in the disciplines of Geography, History, Social Studies, Music and Science and produced a multimedia curriculum CD, ''Science: Through Native American Eyes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cradleboard.org/2000/history.html |title=Cradleboard History |publisher=Cradleboard.org |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref>

In 2002, a track written and performed by Sainte-Marie, titled "Lazarus", was sampled by [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] producer [[Kanye West]] and performed by [[Cam'Ron]] and Jim Jones of [[The Diplomats]]. The track is called "Dead or Alive". In June 2007, she made a rare U.S. appearance at the [[Clearwater Festival]] in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York]].

In 2008, a two-CD set titled ''Buffy/Changing Woman/Sweet America: The Mid-1970s Recordings'' was released, compiling the three studio albums that she recorded for [[ABC Records]] and [[MCA Records]] between 1974 and 1976 (after departing her long-time label [[Vanguard Records]]). This was the first re-release of this material. In September 2008, Sainte-Marie made a comeback onto the music scene in Canada with the release of her studio album ''[[Running for the Drum]]''. It was produced by Chris Birkett (producer of her 1992 and 1996 [[best of]] albums). Sessions for this project commenced in 2006 in Sainte-Marie's home studio in Hawaii and in part in France. They continued until spring 2007. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On November 29, 2019, a 50th-anniversary edition of Sainte-Marie's 1969 album [[Illuminations (Buffy Sainte-Marie album)|''Illuminations'']] was released on vinyl by [[Concord Records]], the company that bought [[Vanguard Records]], the original publisher of the album.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sainte-Marie |first1=Buffy |title=News |url=http://buffysainte-marie.com/?p=2559 |website=Official Buffy Sainte-Marie Website}}</ref>

==Blacklisting==
Sainte-Marie said in a 2008 interview at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5_3IhqNZKI| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427184220/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5_3IhqNZKI| archive-date=2010-04-27 | url-status=dead|title=2008 Native Writer's Series #3 – Buffy Sainte-Marie|publisher=YouTube|date=April 17, 2008 |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref> that she had been [[Blacklisting|blacklisted]] by American radio stations and that she, along with Native Americans and other Indigenous people in the [[Red Power movements]], were put out of business in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paulsen|first=Sasha|title=An original rebel with a resonating voice|journal=[[Napa Valley Register]]|publisher=Lee Enterprises, Inc.|location=Napa, CA|date=September 24, 2011|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/an-original-rebel-with-a-resonating-voice/article_1d0ae17a-ea4b-11e0-8335-001cc4c002e0.html|access-date=September 28, 2011}}</ref>

In a 1999 interview at [[Diné College]] with a staff writer with ''[[Indian Country Today]]'', Sainte-Marie said "I found out 10 years later, in the 1980s, that President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been writing letters on [[White House]] stationery praising radio stations for suppressing my music" and "In the 1970s, not only was the protest movement put out of business, but the [[Red Power movement|Native American movement]] was attacked."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bsnorrell.blogspot.com/2008/10/canadian-aboriginal-music-awards-is.html?showComment=1224884880000|title=CENSORED NEWS: Uncensored: Buffy Sainte-Marie honored with Lifetime Achievement Award|publisher=Bsnorrell.blogspot.com|date=October 22, 2008|access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref>

As a result of this blacklisting led by (among others) Presidents [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], and [[Nashville]] disc jockey [[Ralph Emery]] (following the release of ''[[I'm Gonna Be a Country Girl Again]]''), Sainte-Marie said "I was put out of business in the United States".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nagy|first1=Rob|title=Folk icon Buffy Sainte-Marie continues her journey — performs at Philadelphia Folk Festival 2016|url=http://www.buckslocalnews.com/entertainment/folk-icon-buffy-sainte-marie-continues-her-journey-performs-at/article_46964db1-3357-594f-86dd-d06f91aa6db9.html|access-date=14 May 2017|work=Bucks Local News|date=12 August 2016}}</ref>
