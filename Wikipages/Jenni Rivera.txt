In life and death, several media outlets including [[CNN]], [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], [[Fox News]], and ''[[The New York Times]]'' have labeled her the most important female figure and top-selling female artist in [[Regional Mexican]] music. ''Billboard'' magazine named her the "top Latin artist of 2013", and the "best selling Latin artist of 2013".

Rivera began recording music in 1992. Her recordings often had themes of social issues, infidelity, and relationships. Rivera released her first studio album, ''[[Si Quieres Verme Llorar]]'', in the late 1990s, failing to attain commercial success; however, she rose to prominence in the United States and Mexico with her major-label debut, ''[[Parrandera, Rebelde y Atrevida]]''. In the early 2000s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across California for performing [[Banda (music)|Banda]] music—a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the [[Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year]] in 2007, which she won nine consecutive times. Her tenth studio album, ''[[Jenni (album)|Jenni]]'' (2008), became her first No.1 record on the [[Top Latin Albums|''Billboard'' Top Latin Albums chart]] in the United States. In 2010, she appeared in and produced the reality TV show ''Jenni Rivera Presents: Chiquis & Raq-C''. She also appeared in and produced ''[[I Love Jenni]]'' starting in 2011 through 2013 and ''Chiquis 'n Control'' in 2012. Her acting debut was in the film ''[[Filly Brown]]'', which was released in 2013.

Over the course of her career, Rivera was awarded two [[Premios Oye!|Oye! Awards]] (Mexico's equivalent to the United States' [[Grammy Awards]]), two [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], twenty-two [[Billboard Latin Music Awards|''Billboard'' Latin Music Awards]], eleven ''Billboard'' Mexican Music Awards and eighteen [[Lo Nuestro Awards]]. She received four [[Latin Grammy]] nominations. She has a star on the [[Las Vegas Walk of Stars]], and she is one of the best-selling regional Mexican artists of all time, having sold more than 20&nbsp;million records worldwide, also making her the highest-earning banda singer of all time.

Aside from music, she was active in her community and donated her time to civic causes. The [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] appointed her its spokesperson in the United States. A proclamation was given officially naming August 6 “Jenni Rivera Day” by the [[Los Angeles City Council]] for all her charity work and community involvement.

Rivera, along with six others, [[2012 Mexico Learjet 25 crash|died in a plane crash]] near [[Monterrey]], on December 9, 2012. An investigation was unable to determine the causes of the accident. Lawsuits involving the owners of the plane, Rivera's estate, and family members of those on board with Rivera were filed.

At the onset of her musical career, she was told many times she would not make it. At that time and still today, the genre known as regional Mexican music was and is dominated by men. In a 2011 interview with ''Billboard'' magazine, she stated, "It was hard knocking on those doors to get my music played. One radio programmer in L.A., the meanest son of a bitch in the world, threw my CD in the trash right in my face."

It peaked at No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' Top Latin Albums chart in the United States. In an interview Rivera said that releasing the album was very daring and marked her career in a positive way. She said she wanted to grow as an artist and the people that listen to banda will listen to mariachi if they find a good album that they feel is worth buying. She went on to say there are certain nationalities that will listen to mariachi and not banda. Those were the people that she was going after. She also stated, "Commercializing a ranchera album is much harder. There had not been a successful female mariachi artist in a long time.

In late 2014, controversy and accusations continued to surround the circumstances of her death. Her widower, [[Esteban Loaiza]], has sued Starwood for wrongful death. A request by his attorneys to dismiss the case was granted in late October, court records show. Loiaza's suit contended the pilots flying Rivera.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martens|first1=Todd|title=Husband of Latina music star Jenni Rivera files wrongful-death suit|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/15/entertainment/la-et-ms-husband-late-latin-pop-star-jenni-rivera-20140215|access-date=January 3, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 15, 2014}}</ref>

Rivera's estate has launched a copyright lawsuit against her former manager Laura Lucio. The plaintiffs are asking a judge to instruct law enforcement officials to confiscate Rivera's writings and interviews from Lucio so she cannot use them for a book project. In January 2014, Lucio filed a lawsuit claiming Rivera's estate published a biography of Rivera using the writings and interviews that she helped put together before Rivera passed. Lucio alleged her book project, Mi Vida Loca, which she claimed to have written with Rivera, was shelved following Rivera's death but was later published under a new title, ''[[Unbreakable: My Story, My Way]]'', without her permission. Rivera's estate subsequently had the lawsuit moved out of a state court and into federal court, but in September 2014, U.S. District Judge George Wu granted Lucio's request to have the case moved back to state court. She then published the materials and Rivera's estate are now claiming they are the rightful owners of them. The lawsuit reads, "Defendant even falsely listed herself as the author of these copyrighted works, created by Jenni Rivera and/or owned by Jenni Rivera Enterprises, in a registration of a manuscript titled Jenni Rivera, Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) as told to Laura Lucio; with the Writer's Guild of America's Intellectual Property Registry.<ref name="book lawsuits">{{cite web|last=Sheperd|first=Julianne|title=Jenni Rivera's Family and Friends Continue to Fight Over Her Legacy|url=http://jezebel.com/jenni-riveras-family-and-friends-continue-to-fight-over-1642878633|work=Jezebel|access-date=October 8, 2014}}</ref> Rivera's Estate and Lucio settled the case out of court in September 2015.

On December 9, 2014, the estate of Rivera sued the owners of the plane that was carrying her. The negligence case is against Starwood Management Inc., which owned the Learjet 25 jet that crashed in northern Mexico, after plunging more than 28,000 feet. The case is also against the companies that serviced the aircraft, Bombardier Inc. and Learjet Inc. Rivera's parents and five of her children are plaintiffs in the case. The suit seeks unspecified damages on their behalf. Rivera's estate has also been sued along with Starwood by relatives of those killed in the crash, including her attorney, hairstylist, publicist and makeup artist and one of the plane's pilots.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two years after Jenni Rivera's death, estate sues airplane companies over fatal crash|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2014/12/09/two-years-after-jenni-rivera-death-estate-sues-airplane-companies-over-fatal/|access-date=December 9, 2014|work=Fox News Latino|publisher=FOX News Network, LLC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Jenni Rivera's Estate Sues Plane Owners over Fatal Crash|url=http://www.people.com/article/jenni-rivera-estate-sues|access-date=December 9, 2014|work=People Magazine|publisher=Time Inc.}}</ref>

On October 8, 2014, [[Long Beach, California]] Councilman Dee Andrews pushed to name a park in memorial of Rivera.
