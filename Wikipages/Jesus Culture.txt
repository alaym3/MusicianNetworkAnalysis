== Background ==
In late 1999, the youth group at Bethel Church in Redding, California, led by youth pastor Banning Liebscher, launched the first Jesus Culture conference. Tony Cummings, music editor of [[Cross Rhythms]], described the ministry as "one of the most significant Christian movements in post-war America".<ref name=cr>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Jesus_Culture_Kim_Walker_speaks_about_the_powerful_worship_ministry_from_California/38957/p1/ |title='&#39;Cross Rhythms'&#39; Jesus Culture: Kim Walker speaks about the powerful worship ministry from California |publisher=Crossrhythms.co.uk |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

According to Jesus Culture's website, "The heart of these gatherings was to serve other churches and lead young people to experience the radical love of God."<ref name=website>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusculture.com/about |title=Jesus Culture website |publisher=Jesusculture.com |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

In 2013, Jesus Culture moved to [[Sacramento]] to plant a church,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jesusculture.com/sacramento | title=JC Move: Jesus Culture is moving to sacramento | publisher=Jesus Culture | access-date=July 11, 2013}}</ref> and meetings started at [[Folsom High School]] on September 14, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://new.jesusculture.com/sacramento/ | title=Welcome - Jesus Culture | publisher=Jesus Culture | access-date=September 5, 2014}}</ref>

The conferences bring together a number of pastors and ministers to preach to the conference attendees.<ref name=visions/>  Worship is led through song, featuring a number of worship leaders.

==Jesus Culture Music==
Jesus Culture Music is the music label for the Jesus Culture Ministry. Its albums feature the worship of the Jesus Culture Sacramento, performing a mix of original and cover songs.<ref>{{cite web | work = The joint review | last=Mahoney|first = Mike |title = Jesus Culture – Come Away|url = http://thejointreview.com/2010/11/17/jesus-culture-come-away/ |access-date=September 28, 2011 | quote = It's also typical in that it's a mix of originals and cover songs.}}</ref>

Youth worship leaders [[Kim Walker (musician)|Kim Walker-Smith]], Melissa How and [[Chris Quilala]], long active with the youth group at Bethel Church in Redding, became the core of the Jesus Culture band.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/bios/Chris_Quilala_042010.aspx | first =Chris | last = Quilala | title = Encountering God in Jesus Culture | work = 700 Club Interview | publisher = CBN |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref> Jesus Culture states the purpose of music in their movement is to "ignite revival in the nations of the earth; to compel the Body of Christ to radically abandon itself to a lifestyle of worship; to encounter His extravagant love and raw power."<ref name = website />

Since 2006, the band has released a number of albums on the Jesus Culture Music label. Their 2011 album, ''Awakening (Live from Chicago)'', appeared at No.&nbsp;133 on the Canadian SoundScan charts.<ref name = Canoe>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Charts/ALBUMS.html | contribution = SoundScan Charts | publisher = Canoe | title = Jam! Music }}.</ref>  ''[[Christianity Today]]'' negatively reviewed the album, criticizing it for "amps of staggering sound leave little room for thoughtful reflection or deliberate contemplation",<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/novemberweb-only/livechicago-mini.html | title = Awakening: Live in Chicago |date=Nov 2011  | website = Jesus Freak Hideout| access-date = October 12, 2014}}.</ref> while Jesus Freak Hideout praised it for its "very overt sense of passion for the LORD and worshiping him."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/AwakeningLiveFromChicago.asp|title=Jesus Culture, "Awakening: Live From Chicago" Review|work=jesusfreakhideout.com|access-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref>

The tenth album, ''Unstoppable Love'', was released in June 2014. Some critics called it "one of their best",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/UnstoppableLove.asp|title=Jesusfreakhideout.com: Jesus Culture, "Unstoppable Love" Review|work=jesusfreakhideout.com|access-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref> "passionate",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/article/jesus-culture-unstoppable-love/|title=Jesus Culture: Unstoppable Love|work=ccmmagazine.com|access-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref> and "powerful",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soul-audio.com/2014/06/review-jesus-culture-unstoppable-love/|title=Review: Jesus Culture – Unstoppable Love - Soul-Audio|work=soul-audio.com|access-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref> while others see this newest offering as "a missed opportunity for the band to push themselves a little more musically" other than another CD with musicality that "get[s] bigger and bigger, wider and wider."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tollbooth.org/index.php/past-issues/past-music-reviews/1233-jesus-culture-unstoppable-love|title=Jesus Culture  - Unstoppable Love - The Phantom Tollbooth - The Phantom Tollbooth|author=Haydon Spenceley|work=tollbooth.org|access-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref>
