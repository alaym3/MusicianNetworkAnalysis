'''Band Aid''' were a [[charity supergroup]] featuring mainly British and Irish musicians and recording artists.<ref>[http://www.itv.com/daybreak/entertainment/music/bob-geldof/ Sir Bob Geldof on tour] ITV.com.

The 12" version was mixed by [[Trevor Horn]].

==Background==
The [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was formed by [[Bob Geldof]], who was then lead singer of the Irish band [[the Boomtown Rats]]. The [[BBC]] played a major role in capturing the poverty affecting Ethiopian citizens and thereby influenced Geldof to take action. [[Paula Yates]], Bob Geldof's partner, is considered to have been the brains behind the original Band Aid. It was she who became the driving force that inspired (and helped) Geldof to rally the most famous pop stars of the 1980s to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11235803/Band-Aid-30-Paula-Yates-the-woman-who-inspired-Bob-Geldof.html|title=Band Aid 30: Let's not forget Paula Yates - the woman who inspired it all|journal=Daily Telegraph|last=Cohen|first=Claire|date=2014-11-17|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

The group was composed of forty artists to raise awareness and funds for the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine in 1983–1985]]. The group's name stemmed from the idea that the musicians were providing aid to the less fortunate and suggested that their project was likened to putting a [[Band-Aid|band-aid]] on a wound. Geldof was looking for support from all nations for Africa beginning in the United Kingdom. To do so, the artists recorded a hit single titled "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" depicting the poverty-stricken African scenery of the time. Lyrics of the song included a description of the country saying, "where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow, do they know it's Christmas time at all?" [[Ethiopia]] follows the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|Orthodox]] calendar where Christmas is celebrated on the seventh of January, however, when the song was recorded (during the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia]]), the country had a [[Derg|Communist government]] and as such, religious festivals were not celebrated.

==Original Band Aid==

===Chronology (1984)===
Geldof was so moved by the plight of starving children in Ethiopia, that he decided to try to raise money using his contacts in pop music. Geldof enlisted the help of [[Midge Ure]], from the group [[Ultravox]], to produce a [[charity record]]. Ure took Geldof's lyrics, and created the [[melody]] and backing track for the record.<ref name="Ure2013">{{cite book |first=Midge |last=Ure |author-link=Midge Ure |title=If I Was... An Enhanced Updated Autobiography |publisher=Acorn Digital Press |year=2013}}</ref> Geldof called many of the most popular British and Irish performers of the time, persuading them to give their time free. His one criterion for selection was how famous they were, to maximise sales of the record. He then kept an appointment to appear on a show on [[BBC Radio 1]], with [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]], but instead of promoting the new [[The Boomtown Rats|Boomtown Rats]] material as planned, he announced the plan for Band Aid.<ref name="BBCThree">{{cite AV media | people =Presenter: [[Midge Ure]]| date =21 October 2004 | title =Band Aid: The Song That Rocked the World | medium =TV Production | work =[[BBC]] }}</ref>

The recording studio gave Band Aid no more than 24 free hours to record and mix the record, on 25 November 1984. The recording took place at [[SARM Studios]] in [[Notting Hill]] between 11&nbsp;am and 7&nbsp;pm, and was filmed by director [[Nigel Dick]] to be released as the [[pop video]] though some basic tracks had been recorded the day before at Midge Ure's home studio. The first tracks to be recorded were the group / choir choruses which were filmed by the international press. The footage was rushed to newsrooms where it aired while the remainder of the recording process continued. Later, drums by [[Phil Collins]] were recorded. The introduction of the song features a slowed down sample from a [[Tears for Fears]]' track called "The Hurting", released in 1983. [[Tony Hadley]], of [[Spandau Ballet]], was the first to record his vocal, while a section sung by [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] was deemed unusable, and replaced with section comprising [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], and [[Heaven 17|Glenn Gregory]] from [[Heaven 17]]. [[Simon Le Bon]] from [[Duran Duran]] sang between contributions from George Michael and Sting. [[Paul Young]] has since admitted, in a documentary, that he knew his opening lines were written for [[David Bowie]], who was not able to make the recording but made a contribution to the B-side (Bowie performed his lines at the Live Aid concert the following year). [[Boy George]] arrived last at 6&nbsp;pm, after Geldof woke him up by phone to have him flown over from New York City on [[Concorde]] to record his solo part. (At the time, [[Culture Club]] were in the middle of a US tour.)

The following morning, Geldof appeared on the Radio 1 breakfast show with [[Mike Read]], to promote the record further and promise that every penny would go to the cause. This led to a stand-off with the [[British Government]], who refused to waive the [[Value added tax|VAT]] on the sales of the single. Geldof made the headlines by publicly standing up to Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and, sensing the strength of public feeling, the government backed down and donated the tax back to the charity.

The record was released on 3 December 1984,{{cn|date=August 2021}} and went straight to No. 1 in the [[UK singles chart]], outselling all the other records in the chart put together. It became the fastest- selling single of all time in the UK, selling a million copies in the first week alone. It stayed at No. 1 for five weeks, selling over three million copies and becoming easily the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK, thus beating the seven-year record held by [[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]. It has since been surpassed by [[Elton John]]'s "[[Candle in the Wind 1997]]" (his tribute to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]) but it is likely to keep selling in different versions for many years to come. In [[1986 Grammy Awards|1986]] the original music video from "Do They Know It's Christmas?" won Band Aid a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video#Recipients|Best Music Video, Short Form]].

After [[Live Aid]], "Do They Know It's Christmas?" was re-released in late 1985 in a set that included a special-edition 'picture disc' version, modelled after the Live Aid logo with 'Band' in place of 'Live'. An added bonus, "One Year On" (a statement from Geldof and Ure on the telephone) was available as a [[b-side]]. "One Year On" can also be found in transcript form in a booklet which was included in the DVD set of Live Aid, the first disc of which features the BBC news report, as well as the Band Aid video.

Live Aid inspired a number of charity events, such as Media Aid that raised money for Save the Children.

===Effectiveness===

The hit single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" was highly successful worldwide. It sold over two million copies around the globe and raised more than $24&nbsp;million (USD). The super group's success was seen as a large increase in Celebrity Diplomacy and inspired similar actions of support from countries such as Canada, France, Spain and the United States. The success influenced two organisations of live Benefit Concerts run by Celebrity Charity. The concerts were [[USA for Africa]] and [[Live Aid]] and were broadcast in over 160 countries. Band Aid and Live Aid combined raised about $150&nbsp;million (USD) for the famine relief effort in [[Ethiopia]].

==Band Aid II==
This version, released in 1989, was produced by a British songwriting and production team formed by [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]], [[Matt Aitken]] and [[Pete Waterman]] known as [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]. The only artists from the original Band Aid to be featured again on this version were [[Sara Dallin]] and [[Keren Woodward]] of [[Bananarama]]. This version topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] for three weeks.

===Production===
On Friday 1 December 1989, Bob Geldof called [[Pete Waterman]] to ask if he would consider producing a new version of the song featuring the big stars from that time. Waterman immediately postponed his wedding<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/14-of-the-worst-christmas-songs-188075|title=14 of the worst Christmas songs|work=MusicRadar|access-date=2018-11-22}}</ref> and began calling up the artists. With just two days' notice, on Sunday 3 December, recording took place at PWL Studios in South London. Present in the studio was Bob Geldof, wife [[Paula Yates]] and six-year-old daughter, Fifi Trixiebelle, who was eager to meet Jason Donovan.

Production continued through the Monday, and by Tuesday 5 December the song was broadcast for the first time on London's [[Capital Radio]]. Advance sales of the record reached 500,000. The song was released the following week on 11 December and spent three weeks at number one, becoming the ninth biggest-selling song of the year.

==Band Aid 30==
{{Main|Band Aid 30}}
'''Band Aid 30''' was the 2014 incarnation of the [[charity supergroup]] Band Aid. Announced by [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Midge Ure]], the aim was to aid [[2014 Ebola outbreaks|2014 Ebola outbreak]] victims in Western Africa and preventing its spread. As in previous incarnations, the group covered the track "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", written in 1984 by Geldof and Ure. The song was recorded by some of the biggest-selling current British and Irish pop acts, including [[One Direction]], [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Emeli Sandé]], [[Ellie Goulding]] and [[Rita Ora]]. [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] and [[Take That]] also took part, along with [[Chris Martin]] ([[Coldplay]]) and [[Bono]] ([[U2]])—the third time he contributed to a Band Aid recording.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Band Aid 30: One Direction among celebrity line-up|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=10 November 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/11220735/Band-Aid-30-line-up-revealed.html}}</ref>

Their version of the song debuted at the chart's summit during the week of its release, then dropped down a place in each of the following two weeks before dropping out of the Top 10 in its fourth week. It also received a polarised reception from many music critics due to its new lyric directed towards Africa.

Also, for the first time, a German version was produced and reached the top position of the German single charts at the beginning of December 2014. The project is led by Geldof's close friend [[Campino (singer)|Campino]], lead vocalist of the punk rock band [[Die Toten Hosen]]. A French version of the song is led by [[Carla Bruni]].<ref name="frenchgerman">{{Cite news|title=Carla Bruni to do French Band Aid song|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 November 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11235431/Carla-Bruni-to-do-French-Band-Aid-song.html}}</ref>

==Musicians and instrumentation==
Many of the people involved in the original Band Aid single appeared on the 1984 Christmas edition of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', along with [[Slade (band)|Slade]], [[The Thompson Twins]], [[Bronski Beat]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] and [[Jim Diamond (singer)|Jim Diamond]] to mime to the record. This was the only time the original Band Aid single was performed live on television. However [[Bono]] could not attend, and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] mimed Bono's line. According to the film made by [[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]] on the days of the recording 24–25 November 1984, Bob Geldof says [[The Edge]] from U2 was to have played guitar on the track but was unable to as he was in hospital at the time with a kidney infection.

==Related projects==
The Band Aid project inspired other charity records around the world, including ''[[We Are the World]]'' by [[USA for Africa]] (in the United States), ''[[Cantaré, cantarás|Cantaré Cantarás]]'' by Project Hermanos (in Latin America), ''[[Nackt im Wind]]'' by [[Band für Afrika]] (in Germany), ''[[Ethiopie]]'' by [[Chanteurs Sans Frontiere]] (in France), ''[[Tears Are Not Enough]]'' by [[Northern Lights (Canadian band)|Northern Lights]] (in Canada), ''[[Show some Concern]]'' by [[The Concerned]] in Ireland, ''[[Sammen for Livet]]'' by [[Forente Artister]] (in [[Norway]]), ''[[Maksamme Velkaa]]'' by [[Apua-Orkesteri]] (in [[Finland]]), ''[[Chega de Mágoa]]'' by [[Nordeste Já]] (in [[Brazil]]), ''[[Za milion godina]]'' by [[YU Rock Misija]] (in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]), ''[[Stars (metal song)|Stars]]'' by [[Hear 'n Aid]] (international [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] artists), ''[[Afrika (Danish song)]]'' written by [[Nanna Lüders Jensen|Nanna]] with various Danish artists, ''Volare'' by [[Musicaitalia per l'Etiopia]] in Italy and many others.

The cassette also featured a recording of the "Do They Know It's Christmas?" single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0011356 |title=Soft Aid |publisher=World of Spectrum |access-date=2 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue042/Pages/CVG04200011.jpg |title=Archive – Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |access-date=2 May 2012}}</ref>

===Band Aid Liverpool===
In December 2020, a group of musicians from Liverpool recorded a version of "Do They Know it's Christmas" as a charity record in support of Shelter. Retitled "Do They Know it's Christmas (Feed the World)" with lyrics referring to places on Merseyside, the project was given the go-ahead by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to release their cover version on 10 December 2020. Band Aid Liverpool features about 70 musicians/personalities from Liverpool including Asa Murphy from [[BBC Radio Merseyside]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04w2tk3/episodes/guide|title = BBC Radio Merseyside - Asa Murphy - Episode guide}}</ref> five-piece band The Hummingbirds and project originator Tony Cook, from tribute band The Mersey Beatles.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-25|title=Band Aid Liverpool gets backing from Sir Bob Geldof|url=https://theguideliverpool.com/band-aid-liverpool-gets-backing-from-sir-bob-geldof/|access-date=2021-02-15|website=The Guide Liverpool|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Criticism and controversies==

===Claims of self-righteousness===
In 1986, the anarchist band [[Chumbawamba]] released the album ''[[Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records]]'', as well as an EP entitled "We Are the World", jointly recorded with US band A State of Mind, both of which were intended as anti-capitalist critiques of the Band Aid/[[Live Aid]] phenomenon.<ref>{{Citation|title=Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records - Chumbawamba {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/pictures-of-starving-children-sell-records-mw0000944036|language=en|access-date=2021-11-21}}</ref> They argued that the record was primarily a cosmetic [[Situationist International|spectacle]], designed to draw attention away from the real political causes of world hunger.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In a 1985 ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' interview, [[Morrissey]] gave his views about the song:
<blockquote>'I'm not afraid to say that I think Band Aid was diabolical. Or to say that I think Bob Geldof is a nauseating character. Many people find that very unsettling, but I'll say it as loud as anyone wants me to. In the first instance the record itself was absolutely tuneless. One can have great concern for the people of Ethiopia, but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of Great Britain. It was an awful record considering the mass of talent involved. And it wasn't done shyly. It was the most self-righteous platform ever in the history of popular music.'<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garfield |first=Simon |title=This Charming Man: No SEX No DRUGS No ROCK 'N' ROLL and Definitely No ROYALTY! |journal=Time Out |date=13 March 1985 |url=http://foreverill.com/interviews/1985/charming.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526222643/http://foreverill.com/interviews/1985/charming.htm |archive-date=26 May 2013 }}</ref></blockquote>
