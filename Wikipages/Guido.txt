'''Guido''' is a [[given name]] [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] from the [[Old High German]] name Wido.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mike Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/guido |title=Behind the Name |publisher=Behind the Name |access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> It originated in Medieval [[Italy]]. Guido later became a male first name in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Switzerland]]. The meaning of the name is debated, with various sources indicating the Germanic "Wido" means "wood" and others connecting the Italian form "Guido" to the latinate root for "guide".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/guide|title=guide &#124; Origin and meaning of guide by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>

The slang term ''[[Guido (slang)|Guido]]'' is used in American culture to refer derogatorily to an Italian male who is vain, overly aggressive, and unsophisticated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/guido|title=GUIDO &#124; Meaning & Definition for UK English &#124; Lexico.com|website=Lexico Dictionaries &#124; English}}</ref> It may also be used as a more general [[ethnic slur]] for working-class urban [[Italian Americans]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13708-2003Jul5.html |author= Libby Copeland| work=The Washington Post | title=Strutting Season | date=6 July 2003 |access-date=1 November 2013}}</ref>
