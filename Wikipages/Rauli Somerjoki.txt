'''Rauli Somerjoki''' (born '''Rauli Aarre Tapani Somerjoki'''; 30 August 1947-14 January 1987), known professionally as "'''Badding'''", was a [[Finnish rock]] singer born in the town of [[Somero]] into a family of five children. His records were published on such labels as [[Love Records]].

== Career ==
Badding Somerjoki founded his first band, [[The Five Yes]], in 1963 and also played in the group [[Suomen Talvisota 1939-1940]]. He and [[M. A. Numminen]] caused a major scandal in 1966 with provocative songs like "Mitä nuoren aviomiehen tulee muistaa" ('What Young Husbands Should Remember') and "Jenkka ulkosynnyttimistä" ('Vulva [[Jenkka]]'), whose performance resulted in the interruption of the concert by the police although the lyrics were simply texts from factual books on marriage and sexuality available in public libraries.<ref>[https://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000001217316.html ] (in Finnish)</ref>

Badding's most famous songs include "Fiilaten ja höyläten" (originally [[Reelin' and Rockin']] by [[Chuck Berry]]); "Paratiisi" ('Paradise', a song composed by Badding himself and the lyrics written together with [[Arja Tiainen]]); "Bensaa suonissa" ('Gasoline in the veins', composed by Badding himself, with lyrics written by [[Jarkko Laine]]); "Ikkunaprinsessa" ('Window Princess', originally [[Glendora (song)|Glendora]]); "Tähdet, tähdet" ('Stars, Stars', a song made by Somerjoki himself); and "Laivat" ('Ships', 'Parakhody', originally a Russian popular song).

Badding started his solo career in 1970. He competed in the [[Syksyn sävel]] song contest with "Ja rokki soi" written by [[Matti ja Teppo]].

During his later career, Badding worked with the [[Agents (Finnish band)|Agents]]. His last gig took place in [[Seinäjoki]] on 28 December 1986. During the autumn, he had suffered many bouts of [[bronchitis]]. In January 1987, he died in Helsinki of alcohol-related ailments. He was only 39 years of age.
