Martinez grew up in a "traditional Latin household" where she was made to feel shameful about talking about her sexuality and felt as if she would not be accepted if she came out as bisexual.

== Career ==

=== 2012: Beginnings and ''The Voice'' ===
In 2012, during her junior year of high school, Martinez participated in the ''[[MSG (TV network)|MSG]] Varsity Talent Show'', a televised talent competition. She sang [[The Beatles]]' rendition of "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]" by [[Barrett Strong]] and "[[Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)]]" by [[The Four Tops]]. She was eliminated in the second round.<ref name="msgbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.msgvarsity.com/melanie-adele-martinez-eliminated-round-2-1.1006344|title=Melanie Adele Martinez (eliminated, Round 2)|publisher=MSG Varsity|access-date=July 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190235/http://www.msgvarsity.com/melanie-adele-martinez-eliminated-round-2-1.1006344|archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref>

Later in 2012, Martinez auditioned for the [[The Voice (American season 3)|third season]] of ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]''. She had not watched the show herself prior to the audition.<ref name="wonderland" /> The initial, untelevised audition was an open call, held at [[Javits Center]]. She recalls that while she and her mother were driving to the audition, her mother's car broke down before they reached the [[Queens–Midtown Tunnel]], and the two were forced to "hitchhike" a [[taxicab]] in order to get there. Several months after the initial audition, while at [[Roosevelt Field Mall]], Martinez received word that she had advanced to the "second round". She then received multiple callbacks until she was finally selected to audition on the show itself.<ref name="liherald" />

Martinez auditioned singing [[Britney Spears]]'s "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]". Three of the four judges, [[Adam Levine]], [[CeeLo Green]] and [[Blake Shelton]], hit the "I Want You" button for her. Martinez chose Adam Levine to be her coach.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baldwin's Melanie Martinez lands spot on the voice|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/backstage-pass-1.811987/baldwin-s-melanie-martinez-lands-spot-on-the-voice-1.4012668|access-date=November 27, 2013|newspaper=Newsday|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029213435/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/backstage-pass-1.811987/baldwin-s-melanie-martinez-lands-spot-on-the-voice-1.4012668|archive-date=October 29, 2013}}</ref>

In the Battle Round, Martinez competed against Caitlin Michele. They performed a duet of the [[Ellie Goulding]] song "[[Lights (Ellie Goulding song)|Lights]]". Martinez won and moved on to the Knockout Round. Michele was stolen by Cee Lo Green and also moved on. In the Knockout Round, Martinez was paired with Sam James. She chose to sing [[La Roux]]'s "[[Bulletproof (La Roux song)|Bulletproof]]". Levine eliminated James, and Martinez moved on to the Live Rounds as one of the five remaining members of Team Adam. In week one of the Live Rounds, Martinez sang "[[Hit the Road Jack]]". Public vote saved Team Adam members [[Amanda Brown (singer)|Amanda Brown]] and Bryan Keith.

Levine then chose Martinez over Loren Allred and Joselyn Rivera to remain in the competition. In week three, Martinez's performance of "[[Seven Nation Army]]" finished the voting period at #10 on the iTunes Top 200 Single Chart, causing her iTunes votes to be multiplied by ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/us/charts/songs/2012/11/20|website=iTunesCharts.net|title= US Songs Tuesday, 20th November 2012|access-date=November 23, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925052841/http://www.itunescharts.net/us/charts/songs/2012/11/20|archive-date=September 25, 2015}}</ref> This occurred again in week four, when "[[Too Close (Alex Clare song)|Too Close]]" ended the voting period at #6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/us/charts/songs/2012/11/27|website=iTunesCharts.net|title=US Songs Tuesday, 27th November 2012|access-date=November 23, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923095611/http://www.itunescharts.net/us/charts/songs/2012/11/27|archive-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref>
Martinez was eliminated by audience vote in week five, along with the fellow Team Adam member Amanda Brown, leaving Levine with no artists. In response, Martinez said, "I never expected to get this far and this is beyond what I've ever dreamed of. I'm just so glad I got to express who I am as an artist and really touch people's hearts because that was the ultimate goal."<ref name=HuffingtonPost>{{cite news|last=Elkin|first=Jaimie|title='The Voice' Top 4 Revealed: Melanie Martinez And Amanda Brown Eliminated|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/04/the-voice-top-4_n_2241195.html|access-date=November 27, 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=December 4, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111020719/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/04/the-voice-top-4_n_2241195.html|archive-date=November 11, 2013}}</ref>

=== 2013–2014: ''Dollhouse'' ===
[[File:Melanie martinez (cropped).jpg|thumb|Martinez in February 2014]]
After the show, Martinez began working independently on original material, which she says she spent the majority of 2013 writing. She released her debut single, "Dollhouse", on February 9, 2014.<ref name="usdollhouse">{{cite web|last1=McRady|first1=Rachel|title=Voice's First Breakout?
