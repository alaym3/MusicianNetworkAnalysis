==Musical career==
The pair initially made contact via message boards on [[Okayplayer.com]] and soon began recording and exchanging music. Soon after, they formed The Foreign Exchange without having ever met each other in person, hence the name.
Their album, ''[[Connected (Foreign Exchange album)|Connected]]'', was released in 2004 and was a showcase for Nicolay's musical talents as well as an introduction to like-minded [[Little Brother (group)|Little Brother]] affiliates who contributed to the album. The album received strong reviews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3321-connected/ |title=The Foreign Exchange: Connected &#124; Album Reviews |work=Pitchfork |date=September 14, 2004 |accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref> and the single, "Sincere", featuring [[YahZarah]], was released with a music video directed by Joey Boukadakis.<ref>{{Citation|last=HowloftheJackal|title=Foreign Exchange – "Sincere"|date=June 23, 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-JFsxIAP_o|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref>

In October 2008, the duo released their second album ''[[Leave It All Behind (Foreign Exchange album)|Leave It All Behind]]''.

In June 2009, the group announced that Zo! is now an official artist on The Foreign Exchange Music imprint and, in November 2009, [[YahZarah]] also joined the imprint. Median and [[Darien Brockington]] later joined.

In December 2009, the group were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track "Daykeeper" (feat. Muhsinah) from their ''Leave It All Behind'' album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grammys.com/grammy_awards/52nd_show/list.aspx |title=GRAMMY.com &#124; The Official Site of Music's Biggest Night |publisher=Grammys.com |date=August 4, 1964 |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206120022/http://www.grammys.com/grammy_awards/52nd_show/list.aspx |archivedate=December 6, 2009 }}</ref>
