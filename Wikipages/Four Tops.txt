The '''Four Tops''' are an American vocal [[quartet]] from [[Detroit]] who helped to define the city's [[Motown sound]] of the 1960s. The group's repertoire has included [[soul music]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[disco]], [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]], [[doo-wop]], [[jazz]], and [[show tunes]].

Founded as the '''Four Aims''', lead singer [[Levi Stubbs]], [[Abdul Fakir|Abdul "Duke" Fakir]], [[Renaldo Benson|Renaldo "Obie" Benson]] and [[Lawrence Payton]] remained together for over four decades, performing from 1953 until 1997 without a change in personnel. The Four Tops were among a number of groups, including the [[the Miracles|Miracles]], the [[the Marvelettes|Marvelettes]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]], the [[the Temptations|Temptations]], and the [[the Supremes|Supremes]], who established the [[Motown|Motown Sound]] heard around the world during the 1960s. They were notable for having Stubbs, a [[baritone]], as their lead singer, whereas most other male and mixed vocal groups of the time were fronted by [[tenor]]s. 

The group was the main male vocal group for the highly successful [[songwriter|songwriting]] and [[record producer|production]] team of [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]], who crafted a stream of hit singles for Motown. These included two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hits for the Tops: "[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]" in 1965 and "[[Reach Out I'll Be There]]" in 1966. The group continued to have chart singles into the 1970s, including the million-seller "[[Ain't No Woman (Like the One I've Got)|Ain't No Woman]]" (1973). 

The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked them #79 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

The Four Tops continue to perform with Fakir as the last surviving original member.

==History==
===Early years===
All four members of the group began their careers together while they were high-school students in [[Detroit]]. At the insistence of their friends, Pershing High students [[Levi Stubbs]] and [[Abdul Fakir|Abdul "Duke" Fakir]] performed with [[Renaldo Benson|Renaldo "Obie" Benson]] and [[Lawrence Payton]] from Northern High at a local [[birthday party]]. The quartet decided to remain together and named the group the '''Four Aims'''.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=91/3}}</ref> With the help of Payton's songwriter cousin [[Roquel Billy Davis|Roquel Davis]], the Aims signed to [[Chess Records]] in 1956, changing their name to the '''Four Tops''' to avoid confusion with the [[The Ames Brothers|Ames Brothers]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

Over the next seven years, the Tops had unsuccessful tenures at Chess, Red Top, [[Riverside Records]] and [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Without any hit records to their name, they toured frequently, developing a polished stage presence and an experienced [[supper club]] act, as well as supporting [[Billy Eckstine]]. In 1963, [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy, Jr.]], who had worked with [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Roquel "Billy" Davis]] as a songwriter in the late 1950s, convinced the Tops to join the roster of his growing [[Motown]] record company.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

===Joining Motown===
During their early Motown years, the Four Tops recorded [[jazz]] standards for the company's [[Workshop Jazz Records]] label. In addition, they sang backup on Motown singles<ref name=pc50>{{cite episode|series=[[Pop Chronicles]]|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19831/m1/|title=Show 50 - The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

In 1964, Motown's main songwriting and production team, [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]], created a complete instrumental track without any idea of what to do with it. They decided to craft the song as a more mainstream pop song for the Four Tops and proceeded to create "[[Baby I Need Your Loving]]" from the instrumental track.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> On its release in mid-1964, "Baby I Need Your Loving" made it to number 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

The first follow-up single, "[[Without the One You Love (Life's Not Worth While)]]" (1964), just missed both the pop and R&B Top 40 charts, but "[[Ask the Lonely]]" (1965), written and produced by Motown A&R head [[William "Mickey" Stevenson]] with [[Ivy Jo Hunter]], was a Top 30 pop hit and a Top 10 R&B hit in early 1965. 

===Success===
After their first number 1 hit, "[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)]]" in June 1965, the Four Tops released a long series of successful hit singles.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Among the first wave of these hits were the Top 10 "[[It's the Same Old Song]]" (1965), "[[Something About You (Four Tops song)|Something About You]]" (1965), "[[Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)]]" (1966), and "[[Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever]]" (1966).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> 

Holland-Dozier-Holland wrote most of [[Levi Stubbs]]'s vocals in a tenor range, near the top of his range, in order to get a sense of strained urgency in his [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[preacher]]-inspired leads. They also wrote additional background vocals for a female group, the [[The Andantes|Andantes]], on many of the songs, to add a high end to the low-voiced harmony of the Tops. [[Ivy Jo Hunter]]'s "[[Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever]]" (1966) was one of a few exceptions.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

August 1966 brought the release of the Four Tops' all-time biggest hit and one of the most popular Motown songs ever. "[[Reach Out I'll Be There]]" reached number 1 on the U.S. pop and R&B charts<ref name=pc50/> and the UK chart and soon became the Tops' signature song.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> It was almost immediately followed by the similar-sounding "[[Standing in the Shadows of Love]]"; its depiction of heartbreak reflecting the opposite of the optimism in "Reach Out". It was another Top 10 hit for the Tops.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

[[File:FourTops1967.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Performing at New Rochelle (New York) High School, c. 1967]]

The Top 10 U.S. hit "[[Bernadette (Four Tops song)|Bernadette]]" centered around a man's all-consuming obsession with his lover,<ref name=pc50/> continued the Four Tops' successful run into April 1967, followed by the Top 20 hits "[[7-Rooms of Gloom]]", and "[[You Keep Running Away]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> By now, the Tops were the most successful male Motown act in the United Kingdom (in the United States, they were second to the [[The Temptations|Temptations]]), and began experimenting with more mainstream pop hits. They scored hits with their versions of [[Tim Hardin]]'s "[[If I Were a Carpenter (song)|If I Were a Carpenter]]" in late 1967 (mid-1968 in the U.S.) and [[the Left Banke]]'s "[[Walk Away Renée]]" in early 1968.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> These singles and the original "[[I'm in a Different World]]" were their last hits produced by Holland-Dozier-Holland, who left Motown in 1967 after disputes with [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy, Jr.]]<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

===Late Motown period===
Without Holland-Dozier-Holland, the hits became less frequent.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The group worked with a wide array of Motown producers during the late 1960s, including [[Ivy Jo Hunter]], [[Ashford & Simpson|Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson]], [[Norman Whitfield]] and [[Johnny Bristol]], without significant chart success.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Their first major hit in a long time came in the form of 1970's "[[It's All in the Game (song)|It's All in the Game]]", a pop Top 30/R&B Top Ten hit produced by [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Wilson and the Tops began working on a number of innovative tracks and albums together, echoing Whitfield's [[psychedelic soul]] work with the [[the Temptations|Temptations]]. Their 1970 album ''[[Still Waters Run Deep (Four Tops album)|Still Waters Run Deep]]'' was a forerunner of the [[concept album]]. It also served as an inspiration for [[Marvin Gaye]]'s 1971 classic album ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'', the [[What's Going On (song)|title track of which]] was co-written by the Tops' [[Renaldo Benson|Renaldo "Obie" Benson]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

In addition to their own albums, the Tops were paired with [[The Supremes]], who had just replaced lead singer [[Diana Ross]] with [[Jean Terrell]], for a series of albums billed under the joint title ''[[The Magnificent 7 (album)|The Magnificent 7]]'' in 1970, and ''[[The Return of the Magnificent Seven]]'' and ''[[Dynamite (The Supremes and the Four Tops album)|Dynamite!]]'' in 1971.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Whilst the albums themselves did not perform really well on the charts, ''The Magnificent Seven'' featured a Top 20 version of [[Ike Turner|Ike]] & [[Tina Turner]]'s "[[River Deep - Mountain High]]", produced by [[Ashford & Simpson]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The 1971 single "[[A Simple Game]]" featured backing vocals from members of [[The Moody Blues]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The song did not fare well on the U.S. charts, but reached number three on the UK chart.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

===ABC/Dunhill Records and Casablanca Records===
Motown as a company began to change during the early 1970s. Older acts such as [[Martha and the Vandellas]] and [[The Marvelettes]] were slowly moved aside or dropped to focus on newer acts, such as [[Michael Jackson]] and [[The Jackson 5]], [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]], and the now-solo [[Diana Ross]]. In addition, the company moved its operations from Detroit to [[Los Angeles, California]], where [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy, Jr.]] planned to break into the [[motion picture]] and [[television]] industries. In 1972, it was announced that the entire company would move west and that all its artists had to move as well. Many of the older Motown acts, already neglected by the label, opted to stay in Detroit, including [[The Funk Brothers]] studio backing band, [[Martha Reeves]], and the Four Tops.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

The Tops departed Motown for [[ABC-Dunhill]], where they were assigned to writer-producers [[Dennis Lambert]] and [[Brian Potter (musician)|Brian Potter]] and the label's head of A&R, [[Steve Barri]] as producer, with The Tops' own [[Lawrence Payton]] later also serving as a producer and writer. He also took over lead vocal duties on several tracks.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The group's first release on the label, "[[Keeper of the Castle (song)|Keeper of the Castle]]" (1972) was their first pop Top 10 hit since "[[Bernadette (Four Tops song)|Bernadette]]" in 1967. Follow-ups included the 1973 million-selling "[[Ain't No Woman (Like the One I've Got)]]", also a top 10 pop hit and their third R&B number 1, and the Top 20 hit, "[[Are You Man Enough (The Four Tops song)|Are You Man Enough]]" (1973), (from the 1973 movie ''[[Shaft in Africa]]'').<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "[[Sweet Understanding Love]]" (1973); "Midnight Flower (1974); and "One Chain Don't Make No Prison" (1974) all reached the R&B Top 10 between 1972 and 1974. Two ABC/Dunhill singles, 1974's "I Just Can't Get You Out of My Mind" and 1975's "Seven Lonely Nights" have become popular tunes in the southeast Beach/Shag Club Dance circuit.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

After the release of "[[Catfish]]" (a top 10 R&B hit) in 1976, the major hits started to dry up and the Tops left ABC after an album recorded in Philadelphia with the [[MFSB]] musicians resulted in only minor chart success in 1978. The group disappeared from the recording scene until the early 1980s.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Signing a deal with [[Casablanca Records]], the Tops made a comeback in 1981 with the number 1 R&B hit "[[When She Was My Girl]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Produced by David Wolfert, it just missed the Billboard pop Top 10, peaking at number 11. The group also scored a UK Top 10 hit with the song and had another hit there with the follow-up, "Don't Walk Away". In 1982, their song "Back to School Again" appeared in both the movie ''[[Grease 2]]'' and its [[soundtrack]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}

===Return to Motown===
By 1983, The Tops had rejoined Motown,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> where their former ABC-Dunhill producer, Barri was vice-president of A&R. They were featured on the company's 1983 [[television special]] ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'', taking part in one of the highlights of the show - a battle of the bands between The Tops and [[The Temptations]], patterned after similar competitions [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy, Jr.]] had staged during the 1960s.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> [[Levi Stubbs]] and Temptation [[Otis Williams]] decided the Temptations/Tops battle would be a good one to take on the road, and both groups began semi-regular joint tours.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The first of The Tops' albums under their new Motown contract was ''Back Where I Belong'' (1983).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> A whole side of the album was produced by the [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]], including the R&B Top 40 single, "I Just Can't Walk Away".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Only one more Tops album would be released by Motown, ''Magic'' in 1985. The lead single from that album, "Sexy Ways", was almost a Top 20 R&B hit, peaking at number 21 in mid-1985. In July of that year, the group performed at the [[Live Aid]] concert, singing five of their hit songs.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The title track of 1988's ''Indestructible'' was the group's final Top 40 hit, reaching No. 35.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> It was also featured in the 1988 [[science-fiction]] cop film, ''[[Alien Nation (film)|Alien Nation]]''. Another track, "[[Loco in Acapulco]]", written and produced by British pop musician [[Phil Collins]] and former Motown composer-producer [[Lamont Dozier]], climbed into the UK Top 10 and made number 7 in early 1989.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The Arista contract provided an opportunity to pair [[Levi Stubbs]] with fellow Arista artist, another R&B vocalist from Detroit, [[Aretha Franklin]], who was at the height of her own 1980s hit streak. This pairing resulted in the 1988 song "[[If Ever a Love There Was]]", which became a popular R&B and Adult Contemporary hit, as well as being featured on the soundtrack of the 1988 motion picture ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]''.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In December 1988, [[Pan Am Flight 103]] (a disaster known as the Lockerbie bombing) became the group's scheduled return flight to the U.S. for Christmas after completing their European tour. A prolonged recording session and a performance at the British television show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' caused them to oversleep and miss the ill-fated flight which crashed in [[Lockerbie]], Scotland, after a terrorist bomb was detonated on board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silverstatenews.com/lockerbie.htm |title=Silver State News Service: Lockerbie Anniversary |publisher=Silver State News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023437/http://www.silverstatenews.com/lockerbie.htm |archive-date=2014-11-29 |access-date=2011-02-23 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/locherbie1.html |title='The Frost Blog: Lockerbie Tragedy |publisher=The Frost Blog |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519235352/http://martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/locherbie1.html |archive-date=2011-05-19 }}</ref> They left London however using a later [[British Airways]] flight.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

===Later years===
From the late 1980s, the Four Tops focused on touring and live performances. They recorded only one album, returning again to Motown for 1995's ''Christmas Here with You''.{{cn|date=August 2020}} On June 20, 1997, 59-year-old [[Lawrence Payton]] died as a result of liver cancer, after singing for 44 years with the Four Tops who, unlike many other Motown groups, never had a single lineup change until then.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-06-21-mn-5588-story.html|title=Lawrence Payton; Member of Four Tops|newspaper=LA Times|date=June 21, 1997|accessdate=April 1, 2021}}</ref> At first, [[Levi Stubbs]], [[Renaldo Benson|Renaldo "Obie" Benson]], and [[Abdul Fakir|Abdul "Duke" Fakir]] toured as a [[trio (music)|trio]]  called ''The Tops''. In 1998, they recruited former member of the [[the Temptations|Temptations]] [[Theo Peoples]] to restore the group to a quartet. By the turn of the century, Stubbs had become ill from [[cancer]]; [[Ronnie McNeir]] was recruited to fill the Lawrence Payton position and Theo Peoples stepped into Stubbs' shoes as lead singer. Stubbs later died on October 17, 2008 at his home in Detroit.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/17/levi-stubbs-singer-motown Obituary: Levi Stubbs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202093343/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/17/levi-stubbs-singer-motown |date=2017-02-02 }}. ''The Guardian'', October 17, 2008.</ref> 

The group was featured in several television specials during this time, including ''Motown 45'', and several by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], including a 50th-anniversary concert dedicated to the group (available on DVD). The concert turned out to be bittersweet; it featured a brief appearance of Levi Stubbs using a wheelchair, and a memorial to Lawrence Payton, announced by Renaldo "Obie" Benson. Benson appeared on one more [[PBS]] special and died on July 1, 2005, from [[lung cancer]]. The final PBS special, titled ''Motown: The Early Years'', featured a message of Benson's passing following the credits.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The group was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1990, and into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 1999.  In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them #79 on their list of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060316103016/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/ 100 Greatest Artists of All Time].<ref>{{cite web| title = The Immortals: The First Fifty| work = Rolling Stone Issue 946|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625061212/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty| archive-date = 2008-06-25}}</ref> The Four Tops were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005.<ref name="Fame">{{Cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/74-four-tops|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends - FOUR TOPS|website=Michiganrockandrolllegends.com}}</ref>

The Four Tops sang the National Anthem before the start of game 5 for the 2011 baseball [[American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) between the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] & [[Detroit Tigers]] on October 13, 2011 in Detroit, MI. When singing the last line of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", "... and the home of the brave", they quickly sang the words "Ain't No country Like the One I Got", before singing the last word, "brave". The Four Tops were honored with an induction into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame|R&B Music Hall of Fame]] at the Inaugural ceremony held at [[Cleveland State University]]'s Waetejen Auditorium on Saturday August 17, 2013.{{cn|date=August 2020}}
