== History ==
The first release from TV on the Radio (initially just founding members Adebimpe and Sitek) was the self-released ''[[OK Calculator]]'' (the title being a reference to [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[OK Computer]]''<ref>{{citation|title=TV on the Radio: Coming in Loud and Clear|date=April 13, 2007|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/12/AR2007041200693.html|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|last=Harrington|first=Richard|access-date=September 30, 2008|pages=WE06}}</ref>).
