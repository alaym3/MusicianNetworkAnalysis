'''Marc Andrew Gunn''' (born March 17, 1972)<ref>{{cite web | title = Personal FAQ about Marc Gunn | url = http://www.marcgunn.com/jus_da_faq.shtml | publisher = Marc Gunn.com | accessdate = March 18, 2012 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061217/http://www.marcgunn.com/jus_da_faq.shtml | archivedate = March 4, 2016 }}</ref> is an American musician and [[podcaster]]. 

Gunn rose to prominence as the [[autoharp]]-playing half of the [[Brobdingnagian Bards]]. He and partner Andrew McKee developed a following with weekly performances on the campus of the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. This led to gigs at [[renaissance faire]]s, [[science fiction conventions]], and Celtic music festivals as well as parties and weddings for the pair.  The group headlined at the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] party for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]].'' 

After the group split up in 2008, Gunn became a prolific recording musician in the Celtic music community, releasing eleven new albums between 2008 and 2011. His recording of "Rising of the Moon" earned an award in 2013 in the Celtic Radio Music Awards for "Best Roots Traditional".

Gunn was an early adopter of podcasting and one of the few professional podcasters. He started podcasting in May 2005, but it was July when he released his most-successful podcast, [[Irish & Celtic Music Podcast]]. This show began as a spinoff of his Celtic Music Magazine email newsletter. It quickly eclipsed the newsletter's success.

The Irish & Celtic Music Podcast is an hour-long show focusing primarily on independent Celtic musicians and bands. The music styles range from traditional Irish songs and tunes to modern Celtic rock from around the world.<ref>{{cite news |last1=MacGillis |first1=John |title=Jesse Ferguson promotes local music on Irish & Celtic Music Podcast |url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2019/07/21/jesse-ferguson-promotes-local-music-on-irish-celtic-music-podcast/ |work=[[Cornwall Seaway News]] |date=July 21, 2019}}</ref> It won in the "Best Podsafe Music" category three times in the [[Podcast Awards]] in 2009, 2010, and 2017.

==Musical career==
Marc Gunn began his Celtic music career as one-half of the Brobdingnagian Bards. He produced the Bards' early albums. In 2004, Gunn released his first solo album, ''Soul of a Harper''. He then embarked on work on one of his most-popular albums, ''Irish Drinking Songs for Cat Lovers''.

The Brobdingnagian Bards band broke up amicably on September 15, 2008. Gunn began performing solo. He released several albums a year with four full-length studio albums released in 2008, three in 2009, and two in 2010.

Gunn continued releasing 1–2 albums each year. He began diverging from his traditional Celtic music base with more Geek-themed albums inspired by ''Firefly,'' ''Lord of the Rings'', and other science fiction pop culture media shows. He performs solo and with groups at various conventions like Gen Con and Dragon Con each year.

==Podcasting career==
As a fan of Celtic music, Marc Gunn started the ''Celtic Music Magazine'' in 2000. It began as a weekly publication that reviewed Celtic music of all varieties from Irish traditional music to [[Celtic rock]]. On July 28, 2005, he began publishing the ''Irish & Celtic Music Podcast''. It was the second podcast of Celtic music to be released. 

Gunn created the show to help independent Celtic musicians find new fans. The show grew in popularity. In its early days, it is claimed to have had over 20,000 downloads per episode and was one of the top music podcasts on iTunes. The show currently claims over 10,000 downloads per episode and is in the top 90% of all podcasts, according to Libsyn stats.

The podcast won "Best Podsafe Music" in the annual [[Podcast Awards]] for 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=2009 People's Choice Winners |url=http://podcastawards.com/ |website=[[Podcast Awards]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106083424/http://podcastawards.com/ |archive-date=2010-01-06 |date=6 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This win was repeated in 2010 and again in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=Congratulation to the Winners: 2010 Winners and Nominees |url=https://www.podcastawards.com/ |website=[[Podcast Awards]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224225351/https://www.podcastawards.com/ |archive-date=2010-12-24 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=2017 Winners {{!}} Podcast Awards - The People's Choice |url=https://www.podcastawards.com/ |website=[[Podcast Awards]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013212041/https://www.podcastawards.com/ |archive-date=2017-10-13 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
