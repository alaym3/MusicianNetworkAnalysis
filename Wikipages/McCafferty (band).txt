'''McCafferty''' is an American indie rock band from [[Medina, Ohio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/boardside_uk_headlining_tour_dates_2018|title=Broadside announce headlining tour dates and other news you might have missed today – News – Alternative Press|website=Altpress.com|access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref> The band's lineup currently consists of Nick Hartkop on guitar and vocals and his partner Emily Hartkop on bass.

The band's early releases feature Hartkop performing solo and producing an acoustic [[dance-punk]] sound. In later recordings, following the addition of Graham, and subsequently Joecken and Easterly, the band has evolved to encompass a [[pop-punk]] and [[emo]] sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/mccafferty/the-house-with-no-doorbell/|title=''The House with No Doorbell'' • November 16, 2019 at 3:57 AM|website=Archive.is|access-date=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Hartkop's wife, Emily, later joined the group as a bassist when Joecken did not return after their 2018 breakup. The band has notoriously gone through several breakups and reformations, most recently in February 2020 where all remaining members left the band aside from Nick and Emily.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.is/VnbaB|title=Instagram photo by Evan Graham • Jan 30, 2020 at 9:41 PM|website=Archive.is|access-date=March 6, 2020}}</ref>

==History==
McCafferty was formed in 2011 and at the time was mainly a solo acoustic effort from singer-songwriter Nick Hartkop. In the same year, Hartkop self-released the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Moms+Dads'' (2011) under the name McCafferty. The following year he released ''Japan'' (2012) and ''DanceBeats to Hurt Girls'' (2012). In 2013, he released three EPs – ''I Hate This Body'' (2013), ''It's a Bad Idea'' (2013), and ''Forest Life'' (2013), as well as a collaborative live album, ''This Will Mean Nothing'' (2013), which featured tracks from Sam Rockwell and Chris Joecken (who at the time had not yet joined McCafferty).<ref name= UnpluggedMagazine>{{cite web|url=http://sacunplugged.com/post/68696365827/from-the-ground-up-mccaffertys-nick-hartkop|title= From the Ground Up: McCafferty's Nick Hartkop Gives the RUndown on the Building Blocks of the Ban's Catalogue and their Upcoming Full-Length |work=Unplugged Magazine|author= Kirby, Alisha|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref>

In late 2013, the band signed with Monkey Boy Records and released its first full-length [[LP record|LP]], ''Beachboy'' (2013).<ref name= CraigReviewMusic>{{cite web|url= https://craigreviewsmusic.com/2014/01/05/mccafferty-beachboy-review/|title= McCafferty – ''BeachBoy'' (Review)|website=CraigReviewMusic.com |author= Barker, Craig|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref> In 2015 the band released two further EPs: ''When the Lightning Hit'' (2015) and ''Happy Birthday, Dad'' (2015).

In 2016 the band started working on its second full-length LP, which was expected to be named ''Beachboy 2'',<ref name= InfectiousMagazine>{{cite web|url= https://infectiousmagazine.com/stream-mccafferty-top-hat/ |title= STREAM: MCCAFFERTY "TOP HAT" |work=Infectious Magazine |author= Flores, Angie|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref> but ultimately abandoned the project when Hartkop decided to disband the group and return to full-time work as a special education teacher.<ref name= GoldFlakePaint>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/mccafferty-trailer-trash/|title= Track Premiere: McCafferty "Trailer Trash"|website=GoldFlakePaint.co.uk|author= Maine, Sammy|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}</ref>

In late 2016, the band reformed after a successful fan-led [[crowdfunding]] effort to support the production of another EP, with the working title ''DanceBeats to Hurt Girls''. The band signed a single album deal with Take This To Heart Records and released ''Thanks. Sorry. Sure.'' (2017) on June 30, 2017.<ref name=AltPressEntry>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/mccafferty_thanks_sorry_sure_ep_stream/biography|title= McCafferty release early stream of new EP ''Thanks.

On June 25, 2018, Hartkop announced via the official McCafferty Twitter that he would be releasing a compilation record titled "The Sum of All Fears" that would include all of the tracks from ''DanceBeats to Hurt Girls'', ''It's a Bad Idea'', ''When the Lightning Hit'', ''I Hate This Body'' and more. These songs had previously not officially been released onto streaming services. The record was released on [[Spotify]] on June 28, 2018. An EP, ''Clementine'', was released on August 11, along with an official announcement from the band regarding their permanent breakup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mccaffertymusic.bandcamp.com/album/clementine|title=''Clementine'', by McCafferty |website=McCaffertymusic.bandcamp.com}}</ref> The band later reformed, without Joecken, who went to on to form Sister Sandy with Easterly; Hartkop's wife Emily Hartkop replaced Joecken on bass.

On December 29, 2018, the band released ''Yarn: Commentary''. It contains input from Wes Easterly, Evan Graham, and Nick Harktop about the influences and ideas behind the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mccaffertymusic.bandcamp.com/album/yarn-commentary-2|title=''Yarn: Commentary'', by McCafferty|website=McCaffertymusic.bandcamp.com}}</ref>

The band released their third album, ''The House with No Doorbell'', on October 20, 2019. They released a single, "Fentanyl", on June 18 ahead of the release of the album.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/mccaffertyband/posts/2214332081968442] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> A second single, "Sellout", was released on September 22.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n3ZfcxRmoc] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> McCafferty broke up yet again and on November 6, 2019, the lead singer, Nick, released "Divva (I Murdered Nick Hartkop)"<ref>https://mccaffertymusic.bandcamp.com/track/divva-i-murdered-nick-hartkop</ref> Which would be better described as "Emo-Rap" rather than the DIY Indie/Punk Sound McCafferty is known for.

On November 6, 2020, Hartkop released a single under the McCafferty name, "Isn't It Beautiful", where he mentioned multiple allegations against him <ref>https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1qvPOwZI2BStB7Rjh0IR9JvOnGgZ2QgZbfKb_AhWiA7I/mobilebasic</ref> and was "leaving McCafferty behind".<ref>https://mccaffertymusic.bandcamp.com/track/isnt-it-beautiful</ref> Along with releasing two previously unreleased demos on "Two Demos Never Released Back in 2017 So Please Don't Think I'm Coming Back, I Promise You I Won't".<ref>https://mccaffertymusic.bandcamp.com/album/two-demos-never-released-in-2017-so-please-dont-think-im-coming-back-i-promise-you-i-wont</ref> Despite this, a new song, "Beachboy 2", was released on February 2, 2021<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOV4A41EfFQ]</ref> along with another single "If I Saw Him, I'd Still Kiss Him" on March 18, 2021.<ref>{{Citation|title=If I Saw Him, I'd Still Kiss Him|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX2bAYDQjOg|language=en|access-date=2021-03-20}}</ref>

On May 12, 2021, Hartkop released the single "Queerball" under the Mccafferty name. The single is akin to "Divva (I Murdered Nick Hartkop)" as it is also in the "Emo-Rap" style.<ref>{{Citation|title=Queerball|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQnbKo0gK-I|language=en|access-date=2021-05-20}}</ref>

The official website states a new album named "Snoqualmie Welcomes You" will release in Winter 2021 <ref>{{Citation|title=Snoqualmie Welcomes You|url=https://www.mccaffertyband.com|language=en|access-date=2021-10-21}}</ref>
