'''Alba Farelo''' (born 1997),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/musica/20180413/442494870324/bad-gyal-dancehall-concierto-sala-apolo-jamaica.html|title=La cantante Bad Gyal presenta sus nuevas canciones|last=Lines|first=Esteban|date=13 April 2018|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=29 July 2018|language=es}}</ref> better known as '''Bad Gyal''', is a Spanish-born singer, songwriter, disc jockey and producer from [[Vilassar de Mar]], [[Spain]]. Her music interpolates various genres in the urbano umbrella genre including dancehall, trap, dance and hip hop. Farelo rose to fame in 2016 after posting a music video of her covering "[[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]]" by [[Rihanna]] in the [[Catalan language]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Trap catalán: los orígenes del fenómeno musical Bad Gyal|url=https://www.elnacional.cat/enblau/es/television/bad-gyal-inicios-canciones-catalan_414776_102.html|access-date=2021-01-17|website=En Blau}}</ref> After becoming viral she began a serious musical career as an independent artist and released a mixtape, ''Slow Wine'', later that year. Throughout the years, Bad Gyal has developed a [[cult following]] especially after releasing her most iconic single to date "Fiebre", who has been described by the youngsters as the "soon-to-be modern [[Marcha Real|hymn of Spain]]".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Diez-Garde|first=Jose Luis|date=28 November 2019|title=Bad Gyal, la bomba sexual que quiere el trono de Rosalía|trans-title=Bad Gyal, the sex bomb that wants Rosalía's throne|url=https://www.larazon.es/gente/20191128/3etc4gsywvgspmvxfpbyimgkce.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 January 2021|website=[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]|language=es}}</ref> She signed a record deal with [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-05-01|title=Bad Gyal da el salto a una multinacional y firma por Interscope y Aftercluv|url=https://jenesaispop.com/2019/05/01/361841/bad-gyal-confirma-su-salto-a-una-multi-y-ficha-por-interscope-y-aftercluv/|access-date=2021-01-17|website=jenesaispop.com|language=es}}</ref>

==Early life==
Farelo was born in [[Vilassar de Mar]], [[Spain]], the eldest of five children,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/features/a-little-bit-international-bad-gyal-interviewed|title=A Little Bit International: Bad Gyal Interviewed|last=Martin|first=Felicity|date=2 August 2018|work=Clash Magazine|access-date=26 September 2018}}</ref> daughter of the actor and dubbing actor Eduard Farelo.<ref name="dazed">{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/39156/1/bad-gyal-worldwide-angel-interview|title=The Catalan reggaeton queen growing angel wings|last=Joshi|first=Tara|date=23 February 2018|website=[[Dazed]]|access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref><ref name="pitchfork">{{Cite web|last1=Sherburne|first1=Philip|date=2017-10-05|title=Bad Gyal Is a Rihanna-Loving Dancehall Badass From Barcelona|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/rising/bad-gyal-is-a-rihanna-loving-dancehall-badass-from-barcelona/|access-date=2017-10-13|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He worked for international productions such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. After taking ''[[selectividad]]'', Farelo studied a degree in [[fashion design]] at the [[University of Barcelona]]. While attending university and working at a call centre, she released "Pai" in April 2016, an adaptation of "[[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]]" by [[Rihanna]], adapting the lyrics to a mixture of [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[English language|English]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/05/bad-gyal-alba-farelo-interview|title=Bad Gyal: 'Young people feel really represented by reggaeton'|last=Aroesti|first=Rachel|date=5 July 2018|website=[[the Guardian]]|access-date=28 July 2018}}</ref> She stated that she never meant for that song to become viral and that she just did it to create a funny memory with her friend group. However, with that video Farelo became one of the first artists to sing typically Latin music genres in Catalan and was named one of the biggest musical promises in Spain after the cover was picked up by a local radio. While working in a bakery in her hometown, she decided to drop out of college to pursue a serious career in the music industry. She began as an independent artist singing covers and playing music in nightclubs in the [[province of Barcelona]]. She later became more interested in producing her own music and, with the money she made out of these gigs, she rented recording studios for limited hours and hired some producers. She would then release "Indapanden", "No Pierdo Nada" among other songs produced by Fake Guido.

==Career==

=== 2016-2018: ''Slow Wine Mixtape'' and ''Worldwide Angel'' ===
"Pai" gained popularity on [[YouTube]], and was picked up by a local radio, which led to the creation of a mixtape, ''Slow Wine'', with producer Pablo Martínez. The mixtape was released on November 11, 2016. It received generally favourable critics thanks to its innovative sound. ''[[Mondo Sonoro]]'' stated: "with this project Bad Gyal stands out from the disruptive base rag to embrace what she always considered her musical origins: Jamaican music. Much closer to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] than to [[Atlanta]], Farelo has easily slipped through the musics of his fellow generations and added "pegones beats". Bad Gyal started to raise online. Through that era she hit a page on several professional music magazines and websites including ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' and ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact Magazine]],'' who named her song, "Jacaranda" their number 1 single of 2017.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Sherborne|first=Philip|date=1 March 2018|title=Bad Gyal: Worldwide Angel Album Review|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bad-gyal-worldwide-angel/|access-date=27 July 2018|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> After releasing the mixtape's debut single "Fiebre", the singer started to grow exponentially in the areas of [[Maresme|El Maresme]], [[Barcelonès]] and other points of Catalonia and Spain. Throughout the years, the song has developed a [[cult following]] and has been catalogued as a must play at clubs and music festivals. As "Fiebre" was having a lot of success, she was offered many record deals, which she turned down after some legal advises by lawyers and her dream to continue as an independent artist. The success of the mixtape and its critical acclaim led Farelo to perform at several festivals in Iceland and Japan, as well as the Red Bull Music Academy Festival in Los Angeles, and [[Sónar]] in Barcelona.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.factmag.com/2017/11/09/bad-gyal-access-all-areas/|title=Bad Gyal - Access All Areas|date=9 September 2017|work=FACT Magazine|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20180129/44394677676/bad-gyal-presenta-en-estados-unidos-su-nuevo-disco-recopilatorio.html|title=Bad Gyal presenta en Estados Unidos su nuevo disco recopilatorio|date=29 January 2018|work=[[La Vanguardia]]|access-date=29 July 2018|language=es}}</ref> In late 2017 she also toured Mexico and the US.

In February 2018, she released her second mixtape to critical acclaim, which she titled "Worldwide Angel". The album was licensed and distributed with [[Canada (producer)|Canada Editorial]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/12/20/bad-gyal-nicest-cocky-interview-dancehall-catalan|title=The dazzling melancholy of Bad Gyal's dancehall-inspired party music|last=Myers|first=Owen|date=Summer 2018|work=The Fader|access-date=27 July 2018}}</ref> The mixtape was produced by Jam City, Dubbel Dutch, DJ Florentino and Spanish musician [[El Guincho]]. It spawned many singles including "Blink", "Candela" and "Internationally". The last one was included in the digital soundtrack of the first season of the [[Netflix]] teen drama series ''[[Elite (TV series)|Élite]]'' and was featured in an episode. To promote the album, she took part of international festivals such as [[Sxsw|SXSW]] and [[Lollapalooza]] and toured once again the United States. During winter season she embarked on her first Asian tour, which visited countries like Japan, China or the Philippines. She also released "Open the Door" featuring Jamaican singer Govana, "Yo SIgo Iual" and "Unknown Feeling".

=== 2019-present: Steps as a signed artist ===
Formerly signed with the production company Canada Editorial, in April 2019 it was announced Farelo had signed with [[Interscope Records]] and [[Aftercluv Dance Lab|Aftercluv]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8509195/bad-gyal-signs-with-interscope-and-aftercluv-exclusive|title=Bad Gyal Signs With Interscope and Aftercluv: Exclusive|last=Madeleine|first=Fernando|date=30 April 2019|website=Billboard|access-date=26 May 2019}}</ref> The next month she was featured in Spanish ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.es/living/articulos/bad-gyal-dancehall-urbano-fichaje-interscope-universal-music-2019/40518|title=Bad Gyal: "Todo lo decido yo..."|last=Blanco|first=Eva|date=May 2019|website=Vogue.es|language=es|trans-title=Bad Gyal: "Everything I decide..."|access-date=26 May 2019}}</ref> As a signed artist, she moved to a more mainstream field with her first release as a signed artist being the long-anticipated track "Santa María" featuring Jamaican dancehall-reggae artist [[Busy Signal]]. It was released in parallel with "[[Milionària]]" by [[Rosalía (singer)|Rosalía]], in which some called "the biggest musical weekend celebration in Catalan recent music memory".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Busquets|first=Jordi Pueyo|last2=Pous|first2=Ariadna|date=2019-07-04|title=Rosalía canta en catalán en su nueva canción ‘Milionària’|language=es|work=El País|url=https://elpais.com/ccaa/2019/07/03/catalunya/1562171204_970914.html|access-date=2021-01-17|issn=1134-6582}}</ref> It reached the fourteenth position on the [[PROMUSICAE]] chart and was later certified gold.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-07-16|title=Rosalía suma su cuarto top 1 en España con 'Milionària'; Bad Gyal, top 14 con 'Santa María'|url=https://jenesaispop.com/2019/07/16/367580/rosalia-suma-su-cuarto-top-1-en-espana-milionaria-bad-gyal-top-14-con-santa-maria/|access-date=2021-01-17|website=jenesaispop.com|language=es}}</ref> A couple weeks later she released its B-side track, "Hookah", which also entered the chart. During the summer she embarked on her third solo tour "Bad Gyal Soundsystem", which visited many festivals including [[Sónar]], [[Lisbon|Jameson Urban Routes]], [[Hallowfest|Hellow]], [[Valencian Community|Arenal Sound]] and [[Toluca, Mexico|Ceremonia]], among others. In October 2019 she collaborated with Spanish urbano artist Omar Montes on "[[Alocao]]", which eventually became huge in Spain and selected parts of Latin America. The song peaked number one in Spain for several weeks and was certified four times platinum for selling over 160,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BAD GYAL AND OMAR MONTES TEAM UP ON STEAMY NEW RECORD "ALOCAO" – Skope Entertainment Inc|url=https://skopemag.com/2019/10/26/bad-gyal-and-omar-montes-team-up-on-steamy-new-record-alocao|access-date=2021-01-17|language=en-US}}</ref> Montes and Farelo recorded another song entitled "Qué Te Pasó", which was not published after breaking their musical relationship. In August 2020, the song was filtered on digital platforms. In December, she released her biggest commercial solo track to date "Zorra", which peaked at number two on the PROMUSICAE chart and was certified platinum in Spain. Bad Gyal offered two major solo sold-out concerts at [[Razzmatazz (club)|Razzmatazz]] and another sold-out one at [[Madrid|La Riviera]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-04|title=Bad Gyal: El underground es el nuevo mainstream|url=https://qualsevolnit.com/2019/12/bad-gyal-concierto-razzmatazz/|access-date=2021-01-17|website=Qualsevol Nit|language=es}}</ref> The Soundsystem show was expected to begin a major Spanish and Latin American leg starting March 8, 2020 but could only do three shows due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Appearances at festivals like [[Estéreo Picnic Festival|Estéreo Picnic]] and [[Primavera Sound]] were cancelled while the whole tour was postponed to November.
