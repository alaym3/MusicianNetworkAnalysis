== History ==

=== Formation and early years ===

The initial band formation consisted of Richard, Sean and Cobi, who met at [[Musicians Institute]] in Hollywood in 2011 (Richard originally from [[New Mexico]], Sean from [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and Cobi from [[Puerto Rico]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.konbini.com/fr/entertainment-2/warm-up-buttertones/|title=TWarm Up : l'univers ténébreux du gang des Buttertones|website=konbini.com|accessdate=11 July 2017}}</ref> Bonding over their interest in mid-twentieth century music, they first began playing music together at Redman's Hollywood apartment.<ref>[http://www.innovativeleisure.net/artists/the-buttertones "The Buttertones"], Innovative Leisure.</ref> The band's name mirrors that of doo-wop groups such as [[The Cleftones]], and reflects their attempt to seamlessly blend an array of sounds<ref name="flaunt.com">(26 September 2015), [http://www.flaunt.com/content/music/buttertones "The Buttertones: All Different Flavours"], Flaunt Magazine.</ref> Their self-titled debut was "an eight-track effort steeped in expertly executed surf riffs and rolling percussion",<ref name="i-d.vice.com"/> released as a cassette on L.A.'s garage-pop Lolipop label in 2013.

The trio were subsequently joined by Dakota and London (both from [[California]]), after which they self-released their second album, ''American Brunch'', in 2015. Through their first two albums, The Buttertones principally cultivated a musical following in [[Los Angeles]], playing 'practically every venue' and becoming 'a household name in the 20-something Echo Park/Silver Lake/Los Feliz crowd.'<ref name="flaunt.com"/>

The band have cited a diverse range of musical influences on their sound, including [[The Clash]], [[The Cramps]], [[The Gun Club]], [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]] and [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powmagazine.org/video/a-dark-journey-of-romantic-yearning-an-interview-with-the-buttertones/|title=A Dark Journey of Romantic Yearning: An Interview with the Buttertones|website=powmagazine.org|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> explaining that 'from the moment a sound speaks to us, we tend to integrate it into our music, as long as it's coherent with a whole. We don't really have sound aesthetics or stable influences. We don't care about labels.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gonzai.com/vous-reprendrez-bien-un-peu-de-buttertones/|title=Vous reprendrez bien un peu de Buttertones ?|website=gonzai.com|accessdate=23 May 2018}}</ref>

=== Gravedigging (2017) ===

The Buttertones' third album, ''Gravedigging'' (and their debut for [[Innovative Leisure]]) was released on 31 March 2017. The album was recorded at Jazzcats studio in Long Beach in the spring of 2016, and was produced by Jonny Bell of [[Crystal Antlers]]. ''Gravedigging'' is the most collaborative of the band's albums, with songwriting and vocals from guitarist Dakota Böttcher on 'I Ran Away'.<ref name="auto">Feuer, Daiana (23 March 2017), [http://larecord.com/archive/2017/03/23/the-buttertones-interview-gravedigging "The Buttertones: We Plead the Fifth"], L.A. Record.</ref>

The release of ''Gravedigging'' garnered the band an increase in publicity: 'from a band who has so far threatened without actually nailing a bona fide tail on the donkey...''Gravedigging'' might well be an early contender for soundtrack of the year.' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2017/03/27/the-buttertones-gravedigging-innovative-leisure/|title=Album Review: The Buttertones - Gravedigging|date=27 March 2017|website=godisinthetvzine.co.uk|accessdate=11 July 2017}}</ref> The album was met with generally positive reviews upon its release. It has been described as 'refreshing and innovative',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newnoisemagazine.com/review-buttertones-gravedigging/|title=Album Review: The Buttertones - Gravedigging|date=13 June 2017|website=newnoisemagazine.com|accessdate=11 July 2017}}</ref> 'stylish, dark, and a lot of fun',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigsoupmusic.com/reviews/album-reviews/the-buttertones-gravedigging/|title=The Buttertones 'Gravedigging' - GIGsoup|date=22 March 2017|website=gigsoupmusic.com|accessdate=11 July 2017}}</ref> and as 'more of a series of cinematic vignettes than anything else...As each song has its own micro-theme, Araiza's voice seems to adopt a character to suit each song's story.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kxsc.org/blog/2017/4/2/new-adds-shadow-serpentwithfeet-the-buttertones-and-more|title=Album Review: The Buttertones - Gravedigging|date=2 April 2017|website=kxsc.org|accessdate=11 July 2017}}</ref>

The album release was accompanied by an appearance at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Music and Arts Festival]], European and North American tours, and the release of a further single, "Madame Supreme", in October 2018.

=== Jazzhound (2020) ===

The Buttertones began the year as opening act for [[The Reverend Horton Heat]], and announced the release of their fifth album, ''Jazzhound'', on 10 April 2020. The album was their first following the departure of guitarist Dakota Böttcher, with drummer Cobi switching instruments to take his place.

=== Sexual assault allegations ===

On 15 July 2020, Clementine Creevy of [[Cherry Glazerr]] posted a statement on Instagram in which she accused Sean Redman of statutory rape and sexual misconduct: " I was 14 and he was 20...He also insisted on not using protection and gave me HPV. That was the first time I had sex." Creevy also made reference to having witnessed "a culture of predatory, misogynistic, and abusive behavior towards women by Sean, some of his bandmates in the Buttertones, and other men in their circle."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-buttertones-part-ways-with-bassist-after-cherry-glazerrs-clem-creevy-accuses-him-of-statutory-rape/|title=Cherry Glazerr’s Clem Creevy accuses ex-bandmate & Buttertones bassist of statutory rape|website=Brooklyn Vegan|accessdate=15 July 2020}}</ref>
