==Personal life==
While returning to his home in [[North London]] from a gig in [[Essex]], Ironik became the victim of a stabbing attack at around 3&nbsp;a.m. on 6 November 2010, when two men attacked him for his jewellery, knifing him in the right buttock.> Ironik said of the stabbing: "It was something I've never experienced in my life before. Something that I've spoke about in a lot of my records - some of my records - actually. I find it very low that someone has to go take what you have and what you work for. I've kind of got over it and trying to get back on to living my life and being normal. The past is behind, and I'm trying to get on with my life. I'm back to normal, back to work 100% and I'm just happy that everyone was really supportive. I'll always be involved in charity work and especially the anti-gun and knife crime thing. It's a very important thing... I'll always be a part of supporting it, even before the incident, but obviously now more so." The DJ has been reported to have recovered now.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a301641/ironik-back-to-normal-after-stabbing.html|title=Ironik "back to normal" after stabbing|date=2 February 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=Mayer Nissim|access-date=2 February 2011|location=London}}</ref>
