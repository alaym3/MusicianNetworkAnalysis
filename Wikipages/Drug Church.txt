'''Drug Church''' is an American [[post-hardcore]] band from [[Albany, New York]], United States. The band has released three albums, as well as several EPs.

==History==
Drug Church did not start as a side project for singer Patrick Kindlon of [[Self Defense Family]]. After having released a three-song demo online in 2011, the band got signed by [[No Sleep Records]] by the beginning of 2012. Drug Church then signed to [[Pure Noise Records]] in 2018 who released their album, "Cheer".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/drug_church_members_of_self_defense_family_sign_to_no_sleep/|title=Drug Church (members of Self Defense Family) sign to No Sleep|first=Bryne|last=Yancey|website=Altpress.com|date=26 January 2012|accessdate=25 September 2020}}</ref>

==Lyrical and musical style==
Musically the band mixes hardcore punk in the style of bands like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] with [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] elements to create their [[post-punk]]/[[post-hardcore]] sound.
The lyrics to their songs focus mostly on social matters and tend to be dark and/or satirical. In a Q&A Session on the website of his other project Self Defense Family, Kindlon has stated that he has no pre-written lyrics for his bands and rather writes the songs' lyrics while in the studio:

<blockquote>Completely different people write the instrument portion of the music. Leads to a very different feel, so, very different lyrics.
Also, I write everything in the studio. So, there’s no bank of lyrics I pull from. This is made to order, not buffet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://selfdefensemusic.com/post/128214457978/you-might-have-been-asked-this-before-but-im|title=Learn Self Defense|website=Selfdefensemusic.com|accessdate=25 September 2020}}</ref></blockquote>
