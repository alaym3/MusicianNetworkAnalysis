In 1992, Suede released her second album ''Barely Blue''. Writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', music critic Mike Joyce stated, "Virtually all the songs are redeemed by Suede's appealing soprano voice and articulate phrasing. There's more than a little Streisand in her thoughtful approach to a lyric."<ref>{{cite news|title=Pop Soprano Suede Covering the Bases|author=Joyce, Mike|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=31 January 1992|page= 14}}</ref>
