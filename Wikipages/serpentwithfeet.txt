 }}</ref> known professionally as '''serpentwithfeet''', is an experimental musician based in [[New York City]] in [[Brooklyn]]. Wise released the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Blisters'' in 2016, his debut studio album ''[[Soil (album)|soil]]'' in 2018, his second EP ''Apparition'' in 2020, and his second studio album ''[[Deacon (album)|Deacon]]'' in 2021.

==Early life==
Wise was raised in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. He grew up in a religious family; his father owned a Christian bookstore and his mother was a [[choir director]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Phares |first=Heather |title=serpentwithfeet |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/serpentwithfeet-mn0003526016/biography|location=AllMusic.com|access-date= July 5, 2018}}</ref> Wise joined the church choir as a child and grew up with classical and [[gospel music]] as a primary influence.

When he was 11 years old his mother asked him if he wanted to audition for the [[Maryland State Boychoir]] and he refused, so she signed him up anyway and he ended up loving it.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=When the classical world passed on serpentwithfeet he built a whole new one for himself|url=https://www.loudandquiet.com/interview/when-the-classical-world-passed-up-on-serpentwithfeet-he-built-a-whole-new-one-for-himself/|access-date=November 11, 2020|website=Loud And Quiet|language=en-US}}</ref> This was his introduction to classical vocal music. He realized from this experience that there was a lack of diversity in the choir and there was "not much room for the black voice."<ref name=":0" />

He attended high school at [[Baltimore City College]], a school for gifted and talented students that was known for their internationally competitive choir. At the age of 14, he competed in choir competitions with his school choir in Europe and won trophies. He said in an interview with ''[[Loud and Quiet]]'': "It was all black kids, but our repertoire was predominantly classical. And that blew my mind." After this, Wise decided that he wanted to become a world-class performer and he started taking vocal lessons to become a classically trained opera singer.<ref name=":0" />

He later moved to [[Philadelphia]], where he attended the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]. Although Wise was initially interested in becoming a classical opera singer, he was rejected from conservatories he applied to.

==Career==
After leaving the University of the Arts, Wise spent time in Paris and in Philadelphia's [[neo-soul]] scene. However, his voice was seen as closer in tone to opera than to his peers in neo-soul.<ref>{{cite news |last= Schnipper|first= Matthew|date= July 21, 2016|title= serpentwithfeet: The Ecstasy of Exorcism|url= https://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9921-serpentwithfeet-the-ecstasy-of-exorcism/|location=Pitchfork|access-date= July 5, 2018}}</ref> Wise then moved to New York, where he released his first single "Curiosity of Other Men" in 2014.
