'''The Walkabouts''' were an [[United States|American]] [[rock band]] formed in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in 1984. The core members were vocalist Carla Torgerson and vocalist and songwriter Chris Eckman. Although the rest of the line-up changed occasionally, for most of the time the other members were Michael Wells, Glenn Slater and Terri Moeller.<ref name="Larkin80">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|page=487}}</ref>

The band drew inspiration from [[folk music|folk]] and [[country music]], particularly [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Neil Young]] and [[Johnny Cash]], but also from other types of artists and musical styles such as [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], [[Leonard Cohen]], French [[chanson]] and [[Jacques Brel]]. Their sound was typically rich, with string arrangements and keyboards in addition to the standard rock instruments.

The Walkabouts achieved commercial success and a strong fanbase in [[Europe]], where they had done promotion and extensive touring starting from the early 1990s. They occasionally even made it high on the [[record chart]]s in countries such as [[Greece]] and [[Norway]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== History ==
Carla Torgerson and Chris Eckman met and began playing music together in 1983 while attending [[Whitman College]] in [[Walla Walla, Washington]]. In 1984, they moved to Seattle, and the band was born when they joined forces with Chris' two younger brothers, drummer Grant and bassist Curt. The Eckman brothers had been playing in various [[punk rock]] and [[pop (music)|pop]] groups during their college years, and Carla came from a folk and street singing background. The band took their name from Nicolas Roeg's cult film, ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]''.<ref name=bandsite>{{cite web |url=http://thewalkabouts.com/bio.html |title=DustWeb |publisher=The Walkabouts |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331120141/http://thewalkabouts.com/bio.html |archivedate=2012-03-31 }}</ref>

They released their first EP, ''22 Disasters'', in early 1985.<ref name="Larkin80"/> Curt Eckman then left the band, to be replaced by Michael Wells. Their second EP, ''Linda Evans/Cyclone'', was released in 1987. The following year they released their first album, ''See Beautiful Rattlesnake Gardens'', on the [[PopLlama Records|PopLlama]] label, before being signed by [[Sub Pop]] as that label's first non-grunge band.<ref name="Larkin80"/> Adding keyboard player and multi-instrumentalist Glenn Slater, they released three albums on Sub Pop over the next few years - ''Cataract'' (1989), ''Rag & Bone'' (1990), and ''[[Scavenger (Walkabouts album)|Scavenger]]'' (1991).<ref name="Larkin80"/> They also toured extensively, particularly in Europe. In 1992 they left Sub Pop Seattle, but remained with Sub Pop Europe who issued three more albums, ''[[New West Motel]]'' (1993), ''[[Satisfied Mind]]'' (1993), and ''[[Setting the Woods on Fire]]'' (1994).<ref name="Larkin80"/> Drummer Terri Moeller replaced Grant Eckman in 1992, when he left to care for his newborn son, Dakota Eckman.<ref name=fansite>[http://www.thewalkabouts.com/intro.html The Stopping-Off Place: Unofficial Site for the Walkabouts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113142725/http://www.thewalkabouts.com/intro.html |date=2007-11-13 }}</ref>

''[[Satisfied Mind]]'' was their first of several albums largely or wholly comprising songs originally written and recorded by an eclectic variety of other artists, including [[Nick Cave]], [[Charlie Rich]], [[Johnny Rivers]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Mary Margaret O'Hara]], and [[Gene Clark]].<ref name="Larkin80"/> Their 1996 collection of unreleased songs, ''Death Valley Days'', also included songs by [[Neil Young]], [[Nick Drake]] and [[Bob Dylan]], and in 2000 they issued ''Train Leaves at Eight'', which broadened the approach further by including songs by European artists including [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Goran Bregović]], [[Jacques Brel]] and [[Neu!]].<ref name="fansite"/>

In 1995, the band signed with [[Virgin Records]] in Germany and released ''Devil's Road'' (1996) - recorded in part with the [[Warsaw Philharmonic]] - and ''Nighttown'' (1997), leading to new levels of success in Europe.<ref name="Larkin80"/> The video for "The Light Will Stay On", the lead single from ''Devil's Road'' was in heavy rotation on [[MTV Europe]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Starting in 1996, Michael Wells left the band for several years, rejoining in 2003. He was replaced in quick succession by bassists [[John Baker Saunders]], [[Fred Chalenor]] and Joe Skyward. In 1999, they moved to the German record label, [[Glitterhouse Records]] (the successor to Sub Pop Europe), and released ''Trail of Stars'' (1999), ''Train Leaves at Eight'' (2000), ''Ended Up a Stranger'' (2001),<ref name="Larkin80"/> ''Slow Days with Nina'' (2003) - an EP tribute to [[Nina Simone]] - and ''[[Acetylene (album)|Acetylene]]'' (2005). During that period of time, Terri Moeller took a break from the band in 2000, and was replaced by [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] until she returned in 2001.

In 2010, guitarist Paul Austin joined the band and work began on a new album entitled ''Travels in the Dustland,'' released the following year to strong reviews that also hailed the band's return to activity after a six year absence. During the subsequent European tour, the live album ''Berlin'' was recorded and released.

In 2015, Eckman confirmed in an interview with ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut magazine]]'', and in a subsequent Facebook post, that The Walkabouts had disbanded.<ref name=fb>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.eckman.9/posts/10203760975681939|title=Chris Eckman's Facebook page |date=2015-01-04 |accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref> Eckman continues to write and record with a number of projects, as well as serve as label manager for the global sounds imprint Glitterbeat.

== Side projects ==
Eckman and Torgerson have also released albums as side projects under the name "Chris & Carla" and as solo artists.<ref name="Larkin80"/> Carla Torgerson has worked with [[Greeks|Greek]] musician Akis Boyatzis and his band Sigmatropic on their album ''16 [[Haiku]] & Other Stories'' (2001). Later Torgerson released a solo album ''Saint Stranger'' (2004) with help of Akis Boyatzis. Chris Eckman worked between 1996 and 2003 with Norwegian band [[Midnight Choir]] and teamed with Al DeLoner of Midnight Choir in [[electronica]]-project called "Höst" for an album ''The Damage Suite'' (2001). Also Eckman has worked in recent years with [[Willard Grant Conspiracy]] on the albums ''[[Regard the End]]'' and ''[[Let It Roll (Willard Grant Conspiracy album)|Let It Roll]]'', as well as with [[The Bambi Molesters]]. Eckman is also a member of the trio Dirtmusic along with [[Chris Brokaw]] and [[Hugo Race]] and he has worked with the band [[Tamikrest]] from [[Mali]]. These two acts toured Europe as a double bill in the spring of 2010. Eckman has also worked with [[Tosca (band)|Tosca]] on projects including the song "John Lee Huber", and with [[Rupert Huber]] of Tosca] on the album ''L/O/N/G''.

Terri Moeller has also formed The Beltanes with Eric Alton, formerly of [[X-15]], releasing one cassette EP, entitled ''Love Punks'' (1990), and [[The Transmissionary Six]] with Paul Austin, formerly of [[Willard Grant Conspiracy]]. She released a solo CD under the pseudonym Terri Tarantula in 2010.
