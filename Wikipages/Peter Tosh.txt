'''Peter Tosh''', [[Jamaican Order of Merit|OM]] (born '''Winston Hubert McIntosh'''; 19 October{{Hair space}}<ref>Liner notes to album Burnin'</ref> 1944&nbsp;– 11 September 1987) was a Jamaican [[reggae]] musician. Along with [[Bob Marley]] and [[Bunny Wailer]], he was one of the core members of the band [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|the Wailers]] (1963–1976), after which he established himself as a successful solo artist and a promoter of [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]]. He was murdered in 1987 during a [[home invasion]].

==Early music and with the Wailers==
Tosh was born in [[Westmoreland Parish|Westmoreland]], the westernmost [[parishes of Jamaica|parish]] of Jamaica. He was abandoned by his parents and "shuffled among relatives."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5268401/the_oppressed_lose_a_voice_peter_tosh/|title=The oppressed lose a voice, Peter Tosh (1987) - on Newspapers.com|newspaper=The Daily Tar Heel|date=14 September 1987|page=10|access-date=2016-05-15}}</ref> When McIntosh was fifteen, his aunt died and he moved to [[Trenchtown]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. He first learned guitar after watching a man in the country play a song that captivated him. He watched the man play the same song for half a day, memorizing everything his fingers were doing. He then picked up the guitar and played the song back to the man. The man then asked McIntosh who had taught him to play; McIntosh told him that he had.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetalkingdrum.com/tosh.html/ |title=Peter Tosh |access-date=11 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005001005/http://www.thetalkingdrum.com/tosh.html |archive-date=5 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the early 1960s, as an aspiring musician, Tosh went to vocal teacher [[Joe Higgs]], who gave free music lessons to young people. Through his contact with Higgs, Tosh met Robert Nesta Marley ([[Bob Marley]]) and Neville O'Reilly Livingston ([[Bunny Wailer]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/peter-tosh-artist-3552776|title=Biography of Reggae Legend Peter Tosh|last=Romer|first=Megan|website=ThoughtCo|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> He then changed his name to Peter Tosh and the trio started singing together in 1962. Higgs taught the trio to harmonize and while developing their music, they would often play on the street corners of Trenchtown.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In 1964 Tosh helped organize the band [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|the Wailing Wailers]], with [[Junior Braithwaite]], a falsetto singer, and backup singers [[Beverley Kelso]] and [[Cherry Smith]]. Initially, Tosh was the only one in the group who could play musical instruments. According to [[Bunny Wailer]], Tosh was critical of the band because he was a self-taught guitarist and keyboardist, and thus became an inspiration for the other band members to learn to play. The Wailing Wailers had a major [[ska]] hit with their first single, "Simmer Down", and recorded several more successful singles before Braithwaite, Kelso and Smith left the band in late 1965. Marley spent much of 1966 in [[Delaware]] in the United States with his mother, Cedella (Malcolm) Marley-Booker, and for a brief time was working at a nearby [[Chrysler]] factory. He returned to Jamaica in early 1967 with a renewed interest in music and a new spirituality. Tosh and Bunny were already Rastafarians when Marley returned from the US, and the three became very involved with the Rastafari faith. Soon afterwards, they renamed the musical group the Wailers. Tosh would explain later that they chose the name Wailers because to "wail" means to mourn or to, as he put it, "...express one's feelings vocally". He also claims that he was the beginning of the group, and that it was he who first taught Bob Marley the guitar. Also according to [[Bunny Wailer]], the early Wailers learned to play instruments from Tosh.<ref name="reclaiming">{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&t=1&islist=false&id=137701446&m=137725679 |title=Peter Tosh: Reclaiming a Wailer |access-date=23 October 2011}}</ref>

During the mid 1960s Tosh, along with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer, were introduced to [[Danny Sims]] and [[Johnny Nash]] who signed the three artists to an exclusive recording contract on Sims' and Nash's [[JAD Records]] label<ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|date=2012-10-12|title=Pivotal reggae innovator Danny Sims dies|url=https://www.caribbeanlifenews.com/pivotal-reggae-innovator-danny-sims-dies/|access-date=2020-07-24|website=Caribbean Life News|language=en-US}}</ref> as well as an exclusive publishing agreement through Sims' music publishing company, Cayman Music. Rejecting the up-tempo dance of ska, the band slowed their music to a [[rocksteady]] pace, and infused their lyrics with political and social messages inspired by their new-found faith. The Wailers composed several songs for the American-born singer Nash before teaming with producer [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] to record some of the earliest well-known reggae songs, including "Soul Rebel", "Duppy Conqueror", and "Small Axe". The collaboration had given birth to reggae music and in 1970 bassist [[Aston Barrett|Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] and his brother, drummer [[Carlton Barrett]], joined the group. They recorded the album ''[[The Best of The Wailers]]'', which was produced by Leslie Kong and released in 1971.

In 1972, Danny Sims assigned the balance of the [[JAD Records]] recording contract with the band to [[Chris Blackwell]] and [[Island Records]] company <ref name="auto2"/> and released their debut, ''[[Catch a Fire]]'', in 1973, following it with ''[[Burnin' (The Wailers album)|Burnin']]'' and ''[[Natty Dread]]'' the same year. The Wailers had moved from many producers after 1970 and there were instances where producers would record rehearsal sessions that Tosh did and release them in England under the name "Peter Touch".

In 1973, Tosh was driving home with his girlfriend Evonne when his car was hit by another car driving on the wrong side of the road. The accident killed Evonne and severely fractured Tosh's skull. After [[Island Records]] president [[Chris Blackwell]] refused to issue his solo album in 1974, Tosh and Bunny Wailer left the Wailers, citing the unfair treatment they received from Blackwell, to whom Tosh often referred with a derogatory play on Blackwell's surname, 'Whiteworst'.<ref name=LARB>{{cite web|last=Jelly-Schapiro|first=Joshua|title=Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Island Records|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&id=688&fulltext=1&media=|publisher=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=11 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709081953/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&id=688&fulltext=1&media=|archive-date=9 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Tosh had written many of the Wailers' hit songs such as "Get Up, Stand Up", "400 Years", and "No Sympathy". Tosh began recording and released his solo debut, ''[[Legalize It]]'', in 1976 with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] company, and [[Island Records]]. The title track soon became popular among endorsers of cannabis legalization, reggae music lovers and Rastafari all over the world, and was a favourite at Tosh's concerts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} That was his last album from the Wailers, Island Records. In 2013, a book co-written by French scholar Dr [[Jérémie K. Dagnini|Jeremie Kroubo Dagnini]] and American [[Lee Jaffe]], his former associate, says Tosh was part of a smuggling operation that raised money to fund this album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Book-links-Tosh-and-ganja-trade_16964199|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|website=Jamaica Observer}}</ref>

==Solo career==
Tosh started to make his own albums with [[Rolling Stones Records]] and CBS Records ''[[Equal Rights (album)|Equal Rights]]'' followed in 1977, featuring his recording of a song co-written with Marley, "[[Get Up, Stand Up]]", and a cover of "Stepping Razor" that would also appear on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Rockers (soundtrack)|Rockers]]''.

Tosh organized a backing band, [[Word, Sound and Power]], who were to accompany him on tour for the next few years, and many of whom performed on his albums of this period. In 1978 the [[Rolling Stones]] record label Rolling Stones Records contracted with Tosh, on which the album ''[[Bush Doctor]]'' was released, introducing Tosh to a larger audience. The album featured Rolling Stones frontmen [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]], and the lead single&nbsp;– a cover version of [[The Temptations]] song "[[Don't Look Back (Temptations song)|Don't Look Back]]"&nbsp;– was performed as a duet with Jagger.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

During Bob Marley's free [[One Love Peace Concert]] of 1978, Tosh lit a marijuana [[Joint (cannabis)|spliff]] and lectured about [[Legalisation of cannabis|legalizing cannabis]], lambasting attending dignitaries [[Michael Manley]] and [[Edward Seaga]] for their failure to enact such legislation. Several months later he was apprehended by police as he left Skateland dance hall in Kingston and was beaten severely while in police custody{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.

''[[Mystic Man]]'' (1979), and ''[[Wanted Dread and Alive]]'' (1981) followed, both released on Rolling Stones Records. Tosh tried to gain some mainstream success while keeping his militant views, but was only moderately successful, especially when compared to Marley's achievements.

In 1984, after the release of 1983's album ''[[Mama Africa (Peter Tosh album)|Mama Africa]]'', Tosh went into self-imposed exile, seeking the spiritual advice of traditional medicine men in Africa, and trying to free himself from recording agreements that distributed his records in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Tosh had been at odds for several years with his label, [[EMI]], over a perceived lack of promotion for his music.<ref name=Wendt>[http://www.midnightdread.com/peter.html Personal Interview with Doug Wendt], 17 August 1983.</ref>

Tosh also participated in the international opposition to South African [[apartheid]] by appearing at anti-apartheid concerts and by conveying his opinion in various songs like "Apartheid" (1977, re-recorded 1987), "Equal Rights" (1977), "Fight On" (1979), and "Not Gonna Give It Up" (1983). In 1987, Peter Tosh seemed to be having a career revival. He was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Performance in 1987 for ''[[No Nuclear War]]'', his last record.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/arts/pop-view-peter-tosh-reggae-s-rebel.html |title=Peter Tosh, Reggae's Rebel |work=Nytimes.com |date=27 September 1987 |access-date=4 November 2011}}</ref>

==Death==
On 11 September 1987, just after Tosh had returned to his home in Jamaica, a three-man gang came to his house on motorcycles demanding money.<ref name=Hibbert/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5266412/police_identify_reggae_star_peter/|title=Police identify reggae star Peter Tosh's killers (1987) - on Newspapers.com|newspaper=Santa Cruz Sentinel|date=14 September 1987|page=4|access-date=2016-05-15}}</ref> Tosh replied that he did not have any with him but the gang did not believe him. They stayed at his residence for several hours and tortured Tosh in an attempt to [[extort]] money from him. Over the hours, as various associates of Tosh arrived to visit him, they were also taken hostage by the gunmen. The gunmen became more and more frustrated, especially the chief thug, Dennis "Leppo" Lobban, a man whom Tosh had previously befriended and tried to help find work after a long jail sentence.<ref name=Hibbert>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/The-night-Peter-Tosh-was-killed |title=The night Peter Tosh was killed |last=Hibbert |first=Sybil E. |date=22 April 2012 |work=Jamaica Observer |access-date=20 December 2012}}</ref> Tosh said he did not have any money in the house, after which Lobban and the fellow gunmen began opening fire in a reckless manner. Tosh was shot twice in the head and killed. Herbalist Wilton "Doc" Brown and disc jockey Jeff 'Free I' Dixon also died as a result of wounds sustained during the robbery. Several others in the house were wounded, including Tosh's common law wife Andrea Marlene Brown, Free I's wife Yvonne ("Joy"); Tosh's drummer Carlton "Santa" Davis, and musician Michael Robinson.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5266265/reggae_star_peter_tosh_slain_1987/|title=Reggae star Peter Tosh slain (1987) - on Newspapers.com|newspaper=Logansport Pharos-Tribune|date=13 September 1987|page=1|access-date=2016-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5266103/video_beat_remembering_peter_tosh/|title=Video Beat - Remembering Peter Tosh (1987) - on Newspapers.com|newspaper=The Index-Journal|date=25 October 1987|page=60|access-date=2016-05-15}}</ref>

===M16 guitar===
In 1983, at the Los Angeles stop on Tosh's ''Mama Africa'' tour, a local musician named Bruno Coon went to the hotel at which Tosh was staying, claiming to have a gift for him. The gift was a custom-built guitar in the shape of an [[M16 rifle]]. Tosh accepted the gift personally.<ref name="Gleaner20061124">{{cite news| title= M-16 guitar came in hot| first= Copeland| last= Forbes| url= http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20061124/ent/ent1.html| newspaper= Jamaica Gleaner| location= Kingston, Jamaica| date= 24 November 2006| access-date= 30 December 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080503031325/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20061124/ent/ent1.html| archive-date= 3 May 2008| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}</ref> The guitar was subsequently lost by the airlines when the tour went to Europe but was recovered when Tosh's [[public relations]] agent placed an article about its loss in ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.

==Personal life==
===Religion===
Along with [[Bob Marley]] and [[Bunny Wailer]] during the late 1960s, Peter Tosh became a devotee of [[Rastafari]].<ref>Michael E. Veal, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rveYGxIUD4oC&pg=PA15&dq=peter+Tosh+rastafari&num=100&client=firefox-a&cd=3#v=onepage&q=peter%20Tosh%20rastafari&f=false Dub: soundscapes and shattered songs in Jamaican reggae] (Wesleyan University Press, 2007), p. 15</ref>  One of the beliefs of the Rastas is that [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], was either an [[The Rastafari Messiah|embodiment of God]] or a messenger of God, leading the three friends to be baptized by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://midnightraverblog.com/2012/05/ethiopian-orthodox-christianity-rastafari-and-the-black-lion-bakery-part-2-of-2/ |title=Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, Rastafari, and The Black Lion Bakery (PART 2 of 2) &#124; MIDNIGHT RAVER |website=Midnightraverblog.com |date=2012-05-21 |access-date=2017-07-20}}</ref>

===Unicycling===
At some point after his departure from the Wailers, Tosh developed an interest in [[unicycle]]s and became a unicycle rider, being able to ride forwards and backwards and hop. He often amused his audiences by riding onto the stage on his unicycle for his shows.<ref name="unicycling">{{cite web|url=http://intelligentdiplomat.free.fr/articles/article21.html |title="Babylon By Bike" - Intelligent Diplomat - The site dedicated to Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer |publisher=Intelligent Diplomat |access-date=2017-07-20}}</ref><ref name="video">{{YouTube|id=UA_b5Ue-poY&t=3m40s|title=Johnny B.
