'''Immolation''' is an American [[death metal]] band from [[Yonkers, New York]]. They are considered one of the leaders of the New York death metal scene along with [[Incantation (band)|Incantation]], [[Mortician (band)|Mortician]] and [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]], as well as one of the best bands of the death metal genre.

==History==
Immolation was founded after the demise of Rigor Mortis (NY), a band formed in May 1986 by Andrew Sakowicz (bass guitar, vocals) Dave Wilkinson (drums), and Robert Vigna (guitar). After recording the ''Decomposed'' and ''Warriors of Doom'' demos, Sakowicz left the band in early 1988 and was replaced by Ross Dolan, and the band's name was changed to "Immolation". The new lineup put out two studio demos, in 1988 and 1989, and gained a worldwide following in the underground death metal scene. Immolation signed a record deal with [[Roadrunner Records]] and released their debut album ''[[Dawn of Possession]]'' in 1991. After leaving Roadrunner, the band released "Stepping on Angels," a compilation of demo releases and live tracks. In 1995 the band was signed by [[Metal Blade Records]] and released three albums: ''[[Here in After]]'', ''[[Failures for Gods]]'', and ''[[Close to a World Below]]''. After their second album, drummer Craig Smilowski left the band and was replaced by [[Alex Hernandez (drummer)|Alex Hernandez]]. Their next three albums, ''[[Unholy Cult]]'', ''[[Harnessing Ruin]]'', and ''[[Shadows in the Light]]'' were released by French label [[Listenable Records]] and Century Media in the US.

In May 2001, Immolation were the headliners for a tour in Europe with supporting bands: Deranged, [[Deströyer 666]], [[Decapitated (band)|Decapitated]] and [[Soul Demise]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/new+york/yonkers/immolation|title=Immolation Biography|last=Young|first=Garry-Sharpe|work=[[MusicMight]]|access-date=November 5, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831095030/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/new+york/yonkers/immolation|archive-date=August 31, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''Unholy Cult'' saw the departure of guitarist Thomas Wilkinson and the addition of ex-[[Angelcorpse]] guitarist Bill Taylor. Steve Shalaty replaced Hernandez on ''Harnessing Ruin''. In February 2008, Immolation toured the US alongside bands such as [[Rotting Christ]], [[Belphegor (band)|Belphegor]] and [[Averse Sefira]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/b/2008/01/03/immolation-tour-dates.htm|title=Rotting Christ, Immolation, Belphegor and Averse Sefira Tour Dates|last=Bowar|first=Chad|date=January 3, 2008|work=[[About.com]]|access-date=November 5, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107185403/http://heavymetal.about.com/b/2008/01/03/immolation-tour-dates.htm|archive-date=January 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In January and February 2010, Immolation toured with headliner [[Nile (band)|Nile]] along with [[Krisiun]], Rose Funeral, and Dreaming Dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/nile-announces-tour-immolation-krisiun-abigail-williams-dreaming-dead|title=Nile announces first metal tour of 2010 with Immolation, Krisiun, Dreaming Dead, and Rose Funeral |date=July 15, 2009 |work=Metal Injection |access-date=November 5, 2009}}</ref>

In March 2010, Immolation released ''[[Majesty and Decay]]'' through [[Nuclear Blast]]. In 2011, they released the 5-track ''Providence'' EP through Scion A/V as a free download.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scionav.com/collection/808/Scion-A/V-Presents:-Immolation---Providence |title=Immolation - Providence EP &#124; Scion Audio Visual |work=Scion A/V |access-date=September 21, 2012}}</ref> In May 2013, Immolation released ''[[Kingdom of Conspiracy]]'', again via Nuclear Blast, and toured with [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Napalm Death]] on a tour sponsored by [[Decibel Magazine]]. At the end of 2016, Bill Taylor left the band for personal reasons, and was replaced by Alex Bouks. In 2017 Immolation released their tenth full-length album ''[[Atonement (Immolation album)|Atonement]].''

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
Immolation relies on riffs written in [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] [[Harmony|harmonic]] patterns, often dueling between the two guitars, to progress songs, typically over [[Time signature#Complex time signatures|complex rhythm]] and [[drum pattern]]s.<ref name="Purcell2003">{{cite book|last=Purcell|first=Natalie J.|title=Death Metal music: the passion and politics of a subculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwJJR5vvlIsC&pg=PA21|access-date=November 8, 2010|date=May 5, 2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1585-4|pages=19–21}}</ref> Their riffs are often a mixture of fast tremolo picking and a lot of [[power chords]] and pinched harmonics to lay down a wall of sound that many bands have tried to use in their own music. Their guitar parts are often highly complex and technically proficient; drum parts are often written to follow the guitar riffs in a way that is unusual for most death metal. They and [[Incantation (band)|Incantation]] helped bring the New York death metal scene to the attention of the underground.<ref name="Purcell2003"/> Their debut album is frequently cited as being an important and highly influential album, having laid down the blueprint that bands such as [[Cryptopsy]] and [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]] would follow with their respective debuts.<ref name=About.com>{{cite web|last=Schalek|first=Dave|title=Essential Death Metal Albums|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/toppicks/tp/essentialdeathmetalalbums.htm?rd=1|publisher=About.com|access-date=December 13, 2013}}</ref>

Guitarist Robert Vigna and vocalist/bassist Ross Dolan have been the only constant members throughout the band's history. Vigna is considered to be one of the most talented death metal guitarists<ref>{{cite news|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=102306 |title=#15 Robert Vigna (Immolation) |last=Dick |first=Chris |date=August 2007 |work=Decibel Magazine |access-date=January 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211183549/http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=102306 |archive-date=February 11, 2010 }}</ref> and is well known for his complex riffing and wailing solos.

The band's lyrics from ''[[Dawn of Possession]]'' to ''[[Unholy Cult]]'' are largely [[anti-religion]], especially [[anti-Christianity]].<ref name="Purcell2003"/> Beginning with ''[[Harnessing Ruin]]'', there are more lyrics touching on other subjects such as politics. As Ross Dolan explained, the band's shift in lyrical theme was motivated by current events:

{{quote|1=We did kind of leave the religious themes alone, because we were very passionate about that for the first number of records. And once ''Unholy Cult'' came out, that was where we branched off. That's where the shift happened, 'cause that was right after [[9/11]], as you know! I saw it, I went down there, I had family that got killed in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)#Destruction|towers]], and it was a life-changing event in a lot of ways. And I knew at that point that things would never be the same, in our country or in the world. And that's where the shift happened, and we started to focus more on the darker side of humanity. Which we did already with the religious themes, of course, because that was a very dark part of our history. I mean not to knock anybody who's very passionate about their religion, but in my personal point of view, I've always thought of it as a very controlling and negative force. It serves as a division in our world, it divides people, just like so many other things! So that's where we are, and that's where that shift started, away from religion and into something more socially relevant and looking more deeply at ourselves.<ref name="Metal Blast">{{cite web|last=Finer|first=Sam|title=Immolation (Ross Dolan) Interview|url=http://www.metalblast.net/2013/05/immolation-interview/|work=Metal Blast|access-date=2 June 2013|date=14 May 2013}}</ref>}}
