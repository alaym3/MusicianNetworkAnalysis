==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Since 2017, Foureira has dated [[Alberto Botía]], a Spanish footballer who was playing in Greece for [[Olympiacos F.C.]] at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/gente/20180509/443451023971/eleni-foureira-eurovision-2018-relacion-jugador-barca.html|title=Eurovisión 2018: Eleni Foureira, la estrella de Chipre que sale con un exfutbolista del Barça|newspaper=[[La Vanguardia]]|language=es|date=9 May 2018|access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ελένη Φουρέιρα και Αλμπέρτο Μποτία αγκαλιά στο Instagram - «Προς το παρόν θα αποφύγω τον γάμο»|url=https://www.ethnos.gr/lifestyle/163107_eleni-foyreira-kai-almperto-mpotia-agkalia-sto-instagram-pros-paron-tha-apofygo |access-date=14 October 2021 |publisher=Ethnos |date=25 June 2021 |language=Greek}}</ref>

===Origin controversy===
Since the beginning of her career, the Greek media have speculated on Foureira's ancestral origins.<!--Controversy was not over her country of birth, it was due to the fact that she did not have a Greek surname and thus there were questions regarding her heritage.--> As a member of Mystique, she claimed to be [[Brazilians|Brazilian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protothema.gr/thema-people/article/103269/h-plhrhs-metallaksh-ths-elenhs-foyreira/|script-title=el:Η πλήρης μετάλλαξη της Ελένης Φουρέιρα|date=31 January 2011|language=el|publisher=Protothema|access-date=24 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103000025/http://www.protothema.gr/thema-people/article/103269/h-plhrhs-metallaksh-ths-elenhs-foyreira/|archive-date=3 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> She later claimed that her father was from [[Athens]] and her mother from [[Ioannina]], although she had some [[Mexicans|Mexican]] ancestry as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gossip-tv.gr/showbiz/story/70599/einai-apo-ten-albania-e-phoureira |script-title=el:Είναι από την Αλβανία η Φουρέιρα|language=el|date=12 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ishow.gr/news.asp?guid=2CF2AF80-D616-469D-894A-3EC6B041DA9C |script-title=el:Η απάντηση της Φουρέιρα...

In 2013, it was reported by the Greek media that Foureira was born in Albania and that her birth name was Entela Fureraj.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athenstimeout.gr/music/apokalypsiayto-einai-pragmatiko-onoma-tis-elenis-foyreira |script-title=el:Αποκάλυψη:Αυτό είναι το ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΟ όνομα της Ελένης Φουρέιρα!|date=29 July 2013|language=el|publisher=Athens Timeout}}</ref> Foureira did not comment on the reports until 2014, when she confirmed them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protothema.gr/life-style/Gossip/article/429988/h-eleni-foureira-pio-apokaluptiki-apo-pote/ |script-title=el:Ελένη Φουρέιρα: Γεννήθηκα στην Αλβανία!|language=el|date=27 November 2014|publisher=Protothema}}</ref> She claimed that she did not reveal her origin in order to be accepted in the music industry in Greece. She continued claiming she never understood the issue, since she always felt Greek and she has received only Greek education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protothema.gr/life-style/article/430173/eleni-foureira-giati-ekrupsa-pos-eimai-apo-tin-alvania/ |script-title=el:Ελένη Φουρέιρα: Γιατί έκρυψα πως είμαι από την Αλβανία|date=28 November 2014|language=el|publisher=Protothema}}</ref> Andreas Giatrakos, who discovered Foureira and recruited her to join Mystique, later stated that he wanted Foureira to be proud of her origin and would not have rejected her if he knew she was born in Albania.<ref name="Mystique">{{cite web|url=http://www.protothema.gr/life-style/article/430360/psemata-oti-eipame-stin-foureira-na-krupsei-tin-katagogi-tis-leei-o-proin-manatzer-tis/ |script-title=el:Ψέματα ότι είπαμε στην Φουρέιρα να κρύψει την καταγωγή της, λέει ο πρώην μάνατζερ της|date=28 November 2014|language=el|publisher=Protothema}}</ref> She was reluctant to call herself a [[Northern Epirus|Northern Epirote]]; instead, she said that she was born in Albania.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=el:Ελένη Φουρέιρα: Ήρθα 8 ετών στην Ελλάδα από την Αλβανία|url=https://www.newsbeast.gr/lifestyle/arthro/2169430/eleni-foureira-irtha-8-eton-stin-ellada-apo-tin-alvania|website=Newsbeast.gr|access-date=15 March 2018|language=el-GR|date=14 March 2016|quote=Ο παππούς μου είναι Έλληνας, αισθάνομαι Ελληνίδα.

During the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]], Foureira made the Albanian patriotic [[crossed hands (gesture)|eagle gesture]] in a photo with Albanian singer [[Eugent Bushpepa]]. The image went viral in Albania and Greece, being well-received in the former but causing controversy in the latter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazetatema.net/2018/05/04/shqiponja-ne-eurovision-terbon-median-greke/|title=Shqiponja në "Eurovision" tërbon median greke|date=2018-05-04|work=Gazeta Tema|access-date=2018-05-04|language=sq-AL}}</ref> Later, she declared that she loves Greece as it is the country where she lives and where she grew up, so the controversy was unnecessary.
