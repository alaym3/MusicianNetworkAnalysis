'''Wishbone Ash''' are a [[British rock]] band who achieved success in the early and mid-1970s.  Their popular albums included ''[[Wishbone Ash (album)|Wishbone Ash]]'' (1970), ''[[Pilgrimage (Wishbone Ash album)|Pilgrimage]]'' (1971), ''[[Argus (album)|Argus]]'' (1972), ''[[Wishbone Four]]'' (1973), ''[[There's the Rub]]'' (1974), and ''[[New England (Wishbone Ash album)|New England]]'' (1976).

Wishbone Ash are noted for their extensive use of harmony twin lead guitars, which had been attracting electric blues bands since [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Jimmy Page]] had played together in [[the Yardbirds]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jeff Beck: Crazy Fingers|page=[https://archive.org/details/jeffbeckcrazyfin00cars/page/34 34]|author=Annette Carson|isbn=978-0879306328|publisher=Backbeat Books|date=2001|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/jeffbeckcrazyfin00cars/page/34}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-yardbirds/biography|website=Rollingstone.com|title=The Yardbirds Bio}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/3830-wishbone-ash|title=Wishbone Ash - Artist Profile|website=eventseeker.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> Their contributions helped [[Andy Powell]] and [[Ted Turner (guitarist)|Ted Turner]] to be voted "Two of the Ten Most Important Guitarists in Rock History" (''Traffic'' magazine 1989), and to appear in the "Top 20 Guitarists of All Time" (''[[Rolling Stone]]''){{cn|date = March 2021}}. ''[[Melody Maker]]'' (1972) described Powell and Turner as "the most interesting two guitar team since the days when Beck and Page graced The Yardbirds". Several notable bands have cited Wishbone Ash as an influence, including [[Iron Maiden]], [[Van Halen]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Metallica]], [[Dream Theater]], [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] and [[Opeth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shropshirestar.com/entertainment/music/2019/09/27/wishbone-ash-to-bring-anniversary-tour-to-birmingham/|title=Wishbone Ash to bring anniversary tour to Birmingham|publisher=[[Shropshire Star]]|date=September 27, 2019|access-date=November 7, 2019}}</ref><ref name=blabbermouth>{{cite web|title=Classic Rock Legends WISHBONE ASH Celebrate 50th Anniversary With Spring, Fall U.S. Tours|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/classic-rock-legends-wishbone-ash-celebrate-50th-anniversary-with-spring-fall-u-s-tours/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=January 14, 2020|date=January 14, 2020}}</ref>

Formed in [[Torquay]], Devon, in 1969, out of the ashes of trio The Empty Vessels (originally known as The Torinoes, later briefly being renamed Tanglewood in 1969), which had been formed by Wishbone Ash's founding member [[Martin Turner]] (bass & vocals) in 1963 and complemented by Steve Upton (drums and percussion) in 1966. The original Wishbone Ash line-up was completed by guitarists/vocalists Andy Powell and Ted Turner. In 1974, Ted Turner left the band, and was replaced by [[Laurie Wisefield]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The band continued on with strong critical and commercial success until 1980. There followed line-ups featuring former bass players from [[King Crimson]] ([[John Wetton]]), [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] ([[Trevor Bolder]]), and [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]] (Mervyn Spence), Wisefield left in 1985. In 1987, however, the original line-up reunited for several albums – ''[[Nouveau Calls]]'', ''[[Here to Hear]]'' and ''[[Strange Affair (album)|Strange Affair]]'' – until 1990, when Upton quit the band. After Martin Turner was replaced in 1991, the band recorded ''[[The Ash Live in Chicago]]'', before Ted Turner left in 1993.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> This left Andy Powell as the sole remaining original founding member of Wishbone Ash to continue the band on into the future.

==History==
===Formation and rise to fame (1969–1980)===
[[File:Wishbone-ash-charlotte-nc-m.jpg|thumb|right|Wishbone Ash on stage in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], US, in 1972]]
Wishbone Ash were formed in October 1969 by bass guitarist [[Martin Turner]] and drummer Steve Upton. When Tanglewood's original guitarist, Martin's brother Glenn Turner left the trio and returned to his native [[Devon]], their manager, [[Miles Copeland III]] advertised for a guitar player and also for a keyboard player. After an extensive search for a guitarist, the band could not decide between the final two candidates, [[Andy Powell]] and [[Ted Turner (guitarist)|Ted Turner]] (no relation to Martin). It was suggested that they try both guitar players "just to see what it sounds like". Differing from the twin lead sound of [[Southern rock]] pioneer [[The Allman Brothers Band]], Wishbone Ash included strong elements of [[progressive rock]], and also of [[folk music|folk]] and [[European classical music|classical music]]. After the band members wrote several suggested band names on two sheets of paper, Martin Turner picked one word from each list – 'Wishbone' and 'Ash'.

In early 1970, the band secured an opening spot for [[Deep Purple]].  Its guitarist, [[Ritchie Blackmore]], later recommended Wishbone Ash to producer [[Derek Lawrence]], as well as helping them secure a record deal with [[Decca Records|Decca]]/[[MCA Records]]. The band's debut album, ''[[Wishbone Ash (album)|Wishbone Ash]]'', was released in December 1970. One year later, the group released ''[[Pilgrimage (Wishbone Ash album)|Pilgrimage]]''. The band peaked commercially in 1972 with ''[[Argus (album)|Argus]]'', their highest placed entry in the [[UK Albums Chart]] (#3).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The album was voted by the readers of ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' as the "best rock album of the year", also "Top British Album" (''Melody Maker''). The band were getting international acclaim for their live performances as they gained popularity around the world.

The band had now begun to play major arenas as headliners. ''[[Wishbone Four]]'' (1973) was the band's first record without producer Derek Lawrence, as the band decided to produce the album themselves. In December 1973, the band released a [[double album|double]] live album, ''[[Live Dates]]''. There was an album released called ''Wishbone Ash Live in Memphis'', which was a promo to FM radio stations but never sold in stores. Not long after, guitarist [[Ted Turner (guitarist)|Ted Turner]] left the band. After replacing Turner with guitarist [[Laurie Wisefield]] ([[Home (UK band)|ex-Home]]), the band relocated to the US and recorded ''[[There's the Rub]]'' (1974).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> ''[[Locked In (album)|Locked In]]'' (1976), produced by [[Tom Dowd]], saw the band moving towards US soft-rock territory and the group began touring with a keyboard player.

1976's ''[[New England (Wishbone Ash album)|New England]]'' returned to the traditional Wishbone Ash style. ''[[Front Page News]]'' (1977) was the band's last album of this period that was recorded in the US. In 1978, after years of experimental albums, the band decided to return to its roots with ''[[No Smoke Without Fire]]'', the first to be produced by Derek Lawrence since ''Argus'' in 1972. The album contained mainly songs written by Laurie Wisefield and Martin Turner. The band spent six months making the next album, ''[[Just Testing]]'' which was released in February 1980. Pressured by [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] to make more commercial music, Andy Powell, Laurie Wisefield and Steve Upton expressed to bassist/vocalist Martin Turner that they planned to recruit a lead singer / frontman, thus restricting Martin Turner's duties to bass guitar only.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Turner felt unable to support such plans and described the position he was being put in as "untenable". Following a band meeting at his house, Martin Turner parted company with the band. Ironically, the band never recruited the proposed frontman and Turner, in his 2012 autobiography, described the situation as "constructive dismissal". However this was not a view held by the rest of the remaining band members or the then management.

===Line-up changes (1981–1986)===
Turner was replaced by bassist and vocalist [[John Wetton]], formerly of [[Family (band)|Family]], [[King Crimson]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]] ''[[Number the Brave]]'' was released in April 1981 and featured Wetton's lead vocals on just one song, although during album sessions he had offered songs such as "Here Comes the Feeling" that would eventually sell millions when released on [[Asia (band)|Asia's]] 1982 debut album. Wetton did not continue with Wishbone Ash beyond the album sessions and instead co-founded Asia.

Wetton was replaced on the ''Number the Brave'' tour by the former [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] bassist [[Trevor Bolder]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Also joining the band was female backing vocalist, [[Claire Hamill]], who had sung on both the ''Just Testing'' and ''Number the Brave'' albums. In 1982, after Hamill's departure, the band experimented with [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] on the ''[[Twin Barrels Burning]]'' album. It became the highest charting Wishbone Ash album in years ([[UK Albums Chart|UK]] #22).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Bolder left the group to rejoin [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] in 1983, to be replaced by bassist/vocalist [[Mervyn Spence]] (ex-[[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]]).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The group continued with a rock side on 1985's ''[[Raw to the Bone]]'', which became the first Wishbone Ash album not to make the charts. Not long after, Wisefield left after serving as guitarist in the band for eleven years, going on to a varied career that would include work with [[Tina Turner]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Roger Chapman]], [[Jeff Wayne]] and the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] musical ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]''. He was replaced by Jamie Crompton, who in turn was succeeded briefly by [[Phil Palmer]]. Early in 1986, Mervyn Spence quit as well, to be replaced by ex-[[The Kinks|Kinks]] bassist [[Andy Pyle]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===Reunions and departures (1987–1994)===
In 1987, [[I.R.S. Records]] founder and original Wishbone manager [[Miles Copeland III]] began a series of albums entitled ''No Speak'', which featured all [[instrumental]] music. To launch the label successfully, Copeland needed a big name band that would bring publicity to the project. Copeland approached the four founding members of Wishbone Ash about having the original line-up record an all-instrumental album. For the first time in fourteen years, Andy Powell and Steve Upton joined forces with Martin Turner and Ted Turner to record the album ''[[Nouveau Calls]]'', released in February 1988.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The original line-up's tour of 1988 was a huge success, as the band played large venues for the first time since the late 1970s. In August 1989, the band released a reunion album with vocals entitled ''[[Here to Hear]]'',<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> featuring mainly songs written by Ted and Martin Turner.

In 1990 the band went back into the studio to record the follow-up to ''Here to Hear''. The band were shocked when founding member Upton, the band's drummer for their entire career, announced his retirement from the [[music industry]]. They enlisted drummer [[Robbie France]], but replaced him with [[Ray Weston]] when it was determined that personal conflicts between France and Martin Turner could not be resolved. ''[[Strange Affair (album)|Strange Affair]]'' was released in May 1991, featuring mainly songs written by Andy Powell and Ted Turner.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Later in 1991, the band decided to continue without founding member Martin Turner, with the bassist/vocalist being replaced by returnee [[Andy Pyle]], who had been in the band years earlier. The band toured throughout 1992/93, releasing the live album ''[[The Ash Live in Chicago]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> 1994 saw the second and final departure of Ted Turner. Following Turner's departure, Pyle and Weston also left the band.

===Reunion years to present (1995–present)===
{{more citations needed section|date= February 2012}}
At this stage Andy Powell was the only original member left in Wishbone Ash. Powell enlisted guitarist/songwriter [[Roger Filgate]], bassist/vocalist [[Tony Kishman]], and drummer [[Mike Sturgis]]. The new line-up debuted on a short UK/European tour in spring 1995. By the time of the band's 25th anniversary tour in late 1995, Tony Kishman was finding touring difficult due to other performing engagements in the United States. Founding member Martin Turner replaced him on bass and vocals for the duration of the tour, before Kishman returned to record lead vocals for the band's next album. ''[[Illuminations (Wishbone Ash album)|Illuminations]]'' was released in 1996 and featured the Powell, Filgate, Kishman, Sturgis line-up. Powell relied on fan donations and outside assistance to help finance the album.

In 1997, Filgate, Kishman, and Sturgis departed, so Powell brought former drummer Weston back into the fold, along with new members guitarist [[Mark Birch (musician)|Mark Birch]] and bassist [[Bob Skeat]]. Wishbone Ash then went on to release two electronic dance albums on UK indie label Invisible Hands Music. The albums contained electronic beats blended with Wishbone Ash guitar riffs. ''[[Trance Visionary]]'' was the first of the pair, spawning a 12" single of four mixes that was a clubland smash and reached number 38 on the UK dance chart. ''[[Psychic Terrorism]]'' followed. The band then released an acoustic album of classic and new songs entitled ''[[Bare Bones (Wishbone Ash album)|Bare Bones]]'' before hitting the road in 2000 to celebrate their 30th anniversary. A filmed show was held at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] in London, where the band welcomed special guests Wisefield and Hamill as well as other friends for a star-studded concert that resulted in ''[[Live Dates 3]]'' and a live DVD.

[[File:Wishboneash1.jpeg|250px|thumbnail|Wishbone Ash performing in Aberdeen, Scotland on 28 October 2006]]
In 2001, Mark Birch was replaced by [[Finland|Finnish]] guitarist [[Ben Granfelt]]. The band hit the road for their most extensive touring schedule in years. Wishbone Ash returned to the studio in 2002 for the ''[[Bona Fide (Wishbone Ash album)|Bona Fide]]'' album. 2003 saw the band touring across the world with [[Savoy Brown]], playing their largest number of American dates since the 1980s. Ben Granfelt left the band in 2004 to continue working on his solo career. Granfelt's mentor, Muddy Manninen joined the band. In late 2006, the band released a new studio album entitled ''[[Clan Destiny]]''. In 2007, longtime drummer Ray Weston left the band, stating that he was tired of constant touring and wanted to concentrate on different things. He was replaced by [[Joe Crabtree]], known for his work with [[Pendragon (band)|Pendragon]] and King Crimson violinist [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]]. In late 2007, the band released ''[[Power of Eternity]]''; their first with new member Joe Crabtree.

On 25 November 2011 Wishbone Ash released their 23rd album, the well received ''[[Elegant Stealth]]'', which is also the first album to be recorded by the same line up as the predecessor since 1989. In 2013 a court case relating to a trade mark infringement and the use of the name 'Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash' was decided.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/IPEC/2013/3242.html|title=Between : ANDREW POWELL Claimant and MARTIN ROBERT TURNER Defendant : Case No. 3242|website=Bailii.org|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> The court ruled in favour of Andy Powell with the comprehensive judgement forming a clear history of the band since its inception. On 19 February 2014 the 24th studio album ''[[Blue Horizon (Wishbone Ash album)|Blue Horizon]]'' was released. The reviews for this album were generally very positive indeed. As of 2014 this line-up of the band, having been together since 2007, became the longest-lasting line-up of Wishbone Ash in the group's history. On 16 May 2015, Wishbone Ash recorded a live to vinyl album at [[Metropolis Group|Metropolis Studios]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisismetropolis.com/wishbone-ash/|title=Wishbone Ash - 16th May {{!}} Metropolis Studios|website=Thisismetropolis.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-20}}</ref>

On 21–23 May 2015, Wishbone Ash recorded the DVD ''Live in Paris'' at
{{ill|Le Triton|fr|Le Triton (salle de concert)}}
in France. The performance included additional percussion and guitar contributions from Andy's son Aynsley Powell. In May 2017, it was announced that [[Mark Abrahams (musician)|Mark Abrahams]], a long time Wishbone Ash fan, would be joining on guitar duties. Abrahams is a guitarist who previously owned Vision Guitars, a guitar shop in [[Castleford]], [[West Yorkshire]], England. On 25 June 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Wishbone Ash among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

On 24 September 2019 it was announced that Wishbone Ash were signed to [[SPV GmbH|Steamhammer/SPV]] and will release ''Coat of Arms'', their first studio album in six years, on 28 February 2020. The album's lead single, "We Stand as One", was premiered on to the band's 50th anniversary in autumn 2019 and was released on 10 January 2020.<ref name="blabbermouth"/><ref>{{cite web|title=WISHBONE ASH Signs With SPV/STEAMHAMMER; New Album Due In January|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/wishbone-ash-signs-with-spv-steamhammer-new-album-due-in-january/|publisher=capitalchaostv.com|access-date=September 16, 2019|date=September 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pauline's Chronicles from the Road|url=http://wishboneash.com/blog/post/bring_wishbone_ash_to_vancouver/|publisher=wishboneash.com|access-date=November 7, 2019|date=October 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wishboneash.com/blog/post/we_stand_as_one_released/|title=Wishbone Ash's new single - We Stand As One|website=Wishbone Ash|access-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref> The second single "Back in the Day" was released on February 7, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wishboneash.com/blog/post/2nd_single_released_today/|title=Wishbone Ash 2nd single - Back in the Day|website=wishboneash.com|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> The album cover has been created by a heraldry artist Olaf Keller in the Regal Coat of Arms design studio.

For some dates on their 2021 tour, drummer [[Mike Sturgis]] rejoined the band in place of Joe Crabtree.

==Martin Turner - (Ex Wishbone Ash)==
Martin Turner began touring in 2004 with "Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash", performing material by the classic line ups of the band. Occasionally Ted Turner and Laurie Wisefield have joined his group on stage as guests. He published his autobiography in 2012.<ref name=meaww>{{cite journal|url=https://meaww.com/martin-turner-wishbone-ash-andy-powell-split|title="I want nothing to do with Andy Powell": Rock legend and Wishbone Ash founder Martin Turner on his bitter split with the band|website=Meaww.com|date=5 June 2018|access-date=21 June 2018}}</ref>

In 2013 Andy Powell took legal action to protect the Wishbone Ash registered trademark and prevent Martin Turner from using his chosen group name. The court ruled in favour of Andy Powell and Martin Turner's application to appeal was refused. Since then he has toured and recorded with his band as "Martin Turner - (Ex Wishbone Ash)".

==Special events==
Wishbone Ash have developed two group gatherings, AshCon in the UK and AshFest in the United States. These began in 1994 and have developed into gatherings of the 'faithful' and have since become annual fixtures.
