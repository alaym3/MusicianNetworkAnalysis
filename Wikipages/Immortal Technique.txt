== Musical career ==

===2000–2005: ''Revolutionary Vol. 1'' and ''Revolutionary Vol. 2''===

In 2001, Immortal Technique released his first album ''[[Revolutionary Vol. 1]]'' without the help of a record label or distribution, instead using money earned from his rap battle triumphs.<ref name="Bio"/> He also battled but lost to Posta Boy in [[106 & Park]]'s [[Freestyle Friday]]. ''Revolutionary Vol. 1'' also contained the underground classic ''Dance With The Devil''. In November 2002, he was listed by ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' in its "[[Unsigned Hype]]" column, highlighting artists that are not signed to a record label. The following year, in September 2003, he received the coveted "Hip Hop Quotable" in ''The Source'' for a song entitled "Industrial Revolution" from his second album. Immortal Technique is the only rapper in history to have a "Hip Hop Quotable" while being unsigned.<ref name="Bio"/> He released his second album ''[[Revolutionary Vol. 2]]'' in 2003. In 2004, Viper Records and, in 2005, [[Babygrande Records]] re-released Immortal Technique's debut, ''Revolutionary Vol. 1'', to make it available to a wider audience. "Point of No Return" from ''Revolutionary Vol 2'' was used as the entrance theme for [[Rashad Evans]] during the [[UFC 88]] Main Event between [[Chuck Liddell]] and Rashad Evans.

===2005–present: ''The 3rd World'', ''The Martyr'' and ''The Middle Passage''===
[[File:Immortal Technique, live.jpg|thumb|right|Immortal Technique performing in March 2006]]
Between 2005 and 2007 Immortal Technique began working on ''The Middle Passage'' and ''[[The 3rd World]]'', the two albums that would serve a follow up to ''[[Revolutionary Vol. 2]]'' and complete the series. He was also featured on several movie soundtracks and video game soundtracks, all the while touring relentlessly.

===Collaborations===
[[File:Immortal Technique at Roskilde.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Immortal Technique (left) at the [[Roskilde Festival]], 2006]]
The summer of 2005 saw the release of "Bin Laden", a vinyl single 12" featuring [[Mos Def]] and [[DJ Green Lantern]]. The single also contained a remix of the song featured [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and [[KRS-One]]. In early 2006, the song "Impeach the President", featuring [[Dead Prez]] and Saigon turned up in the mixtape "Alive on Arrival" [[DJ Green Lantern]]. This is a simple version of The Honeydrippers, 1973, in which Immortal Technique urged fans to organize a vote of censure against George W. Bush. In April 2009, a new song leaked on the internet named "Democratie Fasciste (Article 4)" by Brazilian-French rapper [[Rockin' Squat]] which featured Immortal Technique. The official release of the song and Rockin' Squat's album ''Confessions D'un Enfant Du Siècle Volume 2'' was on May 12, 2009. The instrumental from the song was sampled from Wendy Rene's "After Laughter". The song expresses the inequalities of the [[Third World]] and revolutionary events throughout history against tyranny and oppression.

The song contains lyrics in English (Immortal Technique), French (Rockin' Squat) and brief shout outs in Spanish (Immortal Technique). This song is Immortal Technique's first official international collaboration.<ref name="Rockin Squat Ft. Immortal Technique - Démocratie Fasciste (Article 4)">{{cite web | website= Immortal Technique Forum | title= Rockin Squat Ft.

On September 11, 2009, a "snippet" of the song was released on [[YouTube]].<ref name="Voices of the Voiceless snippet">{{cite web | last =Ian | first =(SO Empire) | title =Voices of the Voiceless Snippet | url =http://www.hiphopdx.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=46457 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  The preview was released ahead of its September 21 launch on [[iTunes]], as part of a [[internet marketing|web-campaign]] that included updates, promotion and links on forums, [[online magazine|E-Magazines]] and several [[social network service|social networking sites]]. The song's lyrics cover a broad range of issues that are familiar to listeners of both artists – [[racism]], [[world revolution]], [[war]], [[socialism]], [[fascism|government control]], [[rape]], [[famine]], [[colonialism]], [[Classism]], [[self-determination]] and the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]].<ref name="Lowkey on Conspiracy Worldwide Hip Hop Radio">{{cite web | last=C.W. | first=Hip Hop Radio | title= Lowkey speaks on 'Voices' | url=http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/}}</ref>
