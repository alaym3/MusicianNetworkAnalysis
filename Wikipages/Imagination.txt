'''Imagination''' is the ability to produce and simulate novel objects, sensations, and ideas in the [[mind]] without any immediate input of the [[senses]]. It is also described as the forming of experiences in one's mind, which can be re-creations of past experiences, such as vivid memories with imagined changes, or completely invented and possibly fantastic scenes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIxODwAAQBAJ&q=imagination+ability+form+images+invent+ideas+and+sensations+in+the+mind&pg=PT43|title=SENSE THINK ACT: a collection of exercises to experience total human ability|last=Szczelkun|first=Stefan|date=2018-03-03|publisher=Stefan Szczelkun|isbn=9781870736107}}</ref> Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the [[learning process]].<ref name="Norman2000">Norman 2000 pp. 1-2</ref><ref name="Sutton-Smith88">[[Brian Sutton-Smith]] 1988, p. 22</ref><ref>[[Archibald MacLeish]] 1970, p. 887</ref><ref name="Egan92">[[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Kieran Egan]] 1992, pp. 50</ref> A basic training for imagination is listening to [[storytelling]] ([[narrative]]),<ref name="Norman2000"/><ref>[[Northrop Frye]] 1963, p. 49</ref> in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to "evoke worlds".<ref>As noted by [[Giovanni Pascoli]]</ref>  

Imagination is a [[cognitive process]] used in mental functioning and sometimes used in conjunction with [[psychology|psychological]] [[imagery]]. It is considered as such because it involves thinking about possibilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rational Imagination: How People Create Alternatives to Reality|url=https://archive.org/details/rationalimaginat00byrn|url-access=limited|last=Byrne|first=Ruth|publisher=MIT Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0262025843|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rationalimaginat00byrn/page/n52 38]}}</ref> The cognate term of mental imagery may be used in [[psychology]] for denoting the process of reviving in the mind recollections of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "[[wikt: imaging|imaging]]" or "[[wikt:imagery|imagery]]" or to speak of it as "[[Reproductive imagination|reproductive]]" as opposed to "productive" or "[[Constructive imagination|constructive]]" imagination. Constructive imagination is further divided into voluntary imagination driven by the [[lateral prefrontal cortex]] (LPFC) and involuntary imagination (LPFC-independent), such as REM-sleep [[dream]]ing, [[daydreaming]], [[hallucinations]], and spontaneous [[insight]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vyshedskiy |first1=Andrey |title=Voluntary and Involuntary Imagination: Neurological Mechanisms, Developmental Path, Clinical Implications, and Evolutionary Trajectory |journal=Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture |date=2020 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.26613/esic.4.2.186 |jstor=10.26613/esic.4.2.186 |s2cid=231912956 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.26613/esic.4.2.186 |issn=2472-9884}}</ref> The voluntary types of imagination include integration of [[modifiers]], and [[mental rotation]]. Imagined images, both novel and recalled, are seen with the "[[mind's eye]]".

Imagination, however, is not considered to be exclusively a cognitive activity because it is also linked to the body and place, particularly that it also involves setting up relationships with materials and people, precluding the sense that imagination is locked away in the head.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awRR9dWdF9MC&q=imagination+cognitive+process&pg=PT35|title=Imagining Landscapes: Past, Present and Future|last1=Janowski|first1=Dr Monica|last2=Ingold|first2=Professor Tim|date=2012-09-01|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9781409461449}}</ref>

Imagination can also be expressed through stories such as [[fairy tale]]s or [[Fantasy|fantasies]].  Children often use such [[narrative]]s and pretend play in order to exercise their imaginations. When children develop fantasy they play at two levels: first, they use [[role playing]] to act out what they have developed with their imagination, and at the second level they play again with their make-believe situation by acting as if what they have developed is an actual reality.<ref>{{cite book |author=Laurence Goldman |title=Child's play: myth, mimesis and make-believe. |quote=Basically what this means is that the children use their make-believe situation and act as if what they are acting out is from a reality that already exists even though they have made it up.imagination comes after story created.|location=Oxford New York|isbn=978-1-85973-918-1  |publisher=Berg Publishers |year=1998}}</ref>

==History==
[[Aristotle]] in ''[[On the Soul]]'' considered the imagination (''phantasia'') as a capacity for making mental images, and distinguished it from perception and from thinking. He held however that thought was always accompanied by an image.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/suppl4.html |title=Supplement to Aristotle's Psychology: Imagination |last=Shields |first=Christopher |author-link=Christopher Shields |date=2020 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= |access-date=26 Oct 2021}}</ref>

The notion of a "mind's eye" goes back at least to [[Cicero]]'s reference to '''''mentis oculi''''' during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of [[simile]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/deoratorelibr00cice/page/535 Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Liber III: XLI: 163.]</ref>

In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to "the [[Gulf of Gabès|Syrtis]] of his patrimony" and "the [[Charybdis]] of his possessions" involved similes that were "too far-fetched"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of "the rock" and "the gulf" (respectively) — on the grounds that "the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ciceroonoratorya00ciceuoft#page/239/mode/1upWatson, J.S. (trans. and ed.), ''Cicero on Oratory and Orators'', Harper & Brothers, (New York), 1875:  Book III, C.XLI, p.239.]</ref>

In medieval [[faculty psychology]], the imagination was one of the [[five wits|inward wits]] along with [[memory]] and the [[sensus communis]]. It allowed the recombination of images, for example by combining perceptions of gold and mountain to obtain the idea of a golden mountain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=E Ruth |author-link= |date=1975 |title=The Inward Wits: Psychological Theory in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance |url= |location=London |publisher=Warburg Institute |page= |isbn=9780854810512}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Mahoney |first=Edward P |editor1-last=Kretzmann |editor1-first=N |editor2-last=Kenny |editor2-first=A |editor3-last=Pinborg |editor3-first=J |editor4-last=Stump |editor4-first=E |date=1982 |title=Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy |chapter=Sense, intellect, and imagination in Albert, Thomas, and Siger |chapter-url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-history-of-later-medieval-philosophy/sense-intellect-and-imagination-in-albert-thomas-and-siger/C14862252E39C684E11C1B1133FA0EE9 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=602-622 |isbn=9781139055154 |doi=10.1017/CHOL9780521226059.033}}</ref>

The concept of "mind's eye" appeared in English in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] (c.1387) [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]] in his [[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]], where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with "the eyes of his mind"; namely, those eyes "with which all men see after they have become blind".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyprol00chauuoft#page/78/mode/1up ''The Man of Laws Tale'', lines 550-553.]</ref>

Galileo used the imagination to conduct [[thought experiment|thought experiments]], such as asking readers to imagine what direction a stone released from a sling would fly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Franklin |first=James |author-link=James Franklin (philosopher) |editor1-last=Freeland |editor1-first=G |editor2-last=Corones |editor2-first=A  |date=2000 |title=1543 and All That: Image and Word, Change and Continuity in the Proto-Scientific Revolution |chapter=Diagrammatic reasoning and modelling in the imagination: the secret weapons of the Scientific Revolution |chapter-url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/imagin.pdf |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Kluwer |pages=53-115 |isbn=9780792359135}}</ref>

==Description==
The common use of the term is for the process of forming new images in the mind that have not been previously experienced with the help of what has been seen, heard, or felt before, or at least only partially or in different combinations. This could also be involved with thinking out possible or impossible outcomes of something or someone in life's abundant situations and experiences. Some typical examples follow:
* [[Fairy tale]]
* [[Fiction]]
* A form of [[verisimilitude]] often invoked in [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] invites readers to pretend such stories are true by referring to [[object of the mind|objects of the mind]] such as fictional books or years that do not exist apart from an [[imaginary world]].

Imagination, not being limited to the acquisition of exact knowledge by the requirements of practical necessity is largely free from objective restraints. The ability to imagine one's self in another person's place is very important to social relations and understanding. [[Albert Einstein]] said, "Imagination ... is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."<ref>{{cite journal | title=What life means to Einstein: an interview | date=October 26, 1929 | last=Viereck | first=George Sylvester | journal=The Saturday Evening Post | author-link=George Sylvester Viereck}}</ref>

The same limitations beset imagination in the field of [[scientific method|scientific]] [[hypothesis]]. Progress in scientific research is due largely to provisional explanations which are developed by imagination, but such hypotheses must be framed in relation to previously ascertained facts and in accordance with the principles of the particular science.

Imagination is an experimental partition of the mind used to develop theories and ideas based on functions. Taking objects from real perceptions, the imagination uses complex If-functions that involve both [[Semantic memory|Semantic]] and [[Episodic memory|Episodic]] memory to develop new or revised ideas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Devitt|first1=Aleea L.|last2=Addis|first2=Donna Rose|last3=Schacter|first3=Daniel L.|date=2017-10-01|title=Episodic and semantic content of memory and imagination: A multilevel analysis|journal=Memory & Cognition|language=en|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1078–1094|doi=10.3758/s13421-017-0716-1|issn=1532-5946|pmc=5702280|pmid=28547677}}</ref> This part of the mind is vital to developing better and easier ways to accomplish old and new tasks. In sociology, Imagination is used to part ways with reality and have an understanding of social interactions derived from a perspective outside of society itself. This leads to the development of theories through questions that wouldn't usually be asked. These experimental ideas can be safely conducted inside a virtual world and then, if the idea is probable and the function is true, the idea can be actualized in reality. Imagination is the key to new development of the mind and can be shared with others, progressing collectively.

Regarding the volunteer effort, imagination can be classified as:
* involuntary (the dream from the sleep, the daydream)
* voluntary (the reproductive imagination, the creative imagination, the dream of perspective)

==Psychology==
Psychologists have studied imaginative thought, not only in its exotic form of [[creativity]] and artistic expression but also in its mundane form of everyday imagination.<ref>Ward, T.B., Smith, S.M, & Vaid, J. (1997). Creative thought. Washington DC: APA</ref> [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] has proposed that everyday imaginative thoughts about [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] alternatives to reality may be based on the same cognitive processes on which rational thoughts are also based.<ref>Byrne, R.M.J. (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]].</ref> Children can engage in the creation of imaginative alternatives to reality from their very early years.<ref>Harris, P. (2000). The work of the imagination. London: Blackwell.</ref> [[Cultural psychology]] is currently elaborating a view of imagination as a higher mental function involved in a number of everyday activities both at the individual and collective level<ref>Tateo, L. (2015). Giambattista Vico and the psychological imagination. Culture and Psychology, vol. 21(2):145-161.</ref> that enables people to manipulate complex meanings of both linguistic and iconic forms in the process of experiencing.

The phenomenology of imagination is discussed In ''The Imaginary: A Phenomenological Psychology of the Imagination'' ({{lang-fr|L'Imaginaire: Psychologie phénoménologique de l'imagination}}), also published under the title ''The Psychology of the Imagination''''',''' a 1940 book by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], in which he propounds his concept of the imagination and discusses what the existence of imagination shows about the nature of human consciousness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The psychology of imagination|author=Sartre, Jean-Paul|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415119542|location=London|oclc=34102867}}</ref>

The imagination is also active in our perception of photographic images in order to make them appear real.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=John G.|date=2016-12-01|title=Sartre and the Imagination: Top Shelf Magazines|journal=Sexuality & Culture|volume=20|issue=4|pages=775–784|doi=10.1007/s12119-016-9358-x|s2cid=148101276|issn=1095-5143}}</ref>

==Memory==
{{see also|Mental image|Imagery}}
Memory and mental imagery, often seen as a part of the process of imagination, have been shown to be affected by one another.<ref name="Long">{{Cite book 
|author=Long, Priscilla |title=My Brain On My Mind |page=27 |date=2011 |isbn=978-1612301365}}</ref> "Images made by functional magnetic resonance imaging technology show that remembering and imagining sends blood to identify parts of the brain."<ref name="Long" /> Various psychological factors can influence the mental processing of the brain and heighten its chance to retain information as either long-term memories or short-term memories. John Sweller indicated that experiences stored as long-term memories are easier to recall, as they are ingrained deeper in the mind. Each of these forms require information to be taught in a specific manner so as to use various regions of the brain when being processed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leahy|first=Wayne|author2=John Sweller|title=The Imagination Effect Increases with an Increased Intrinsic Cognitive Load|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|date=5 June 2007|volume=22|issue=2|pages=273–283|doi=10.1002/acp.1373}}</ref> This information can potentially help develop programs for young students to cultivate or further enhance their creative abilities from a young age. The [[neocortex]] and [[thalamus]] are responsible for controlling the brain's imagination, along with many of the brain's other functions such as consciousness and abstract thought.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brainhealthandpuzzles.com/brain_parts_function.html|title=Welcome to Brain Health and Puzzles!| access-date=2011-03-05}}</ref> Since imagination involves many different brain functions, such as emotions, memory, thoughts, etc., portions of the brain where multiple functions occur—such as the thalamus and neocortex—are the main regions where imaginative processing has been documented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceforums.net/topic/33986-what-part-of-the-brain-handles-imagination-answered/ |title=Welcome to ScienceForums.Net!}}</ref> The understanding of ''how'' memory and imagination are linked in the brain, paves the way to better understand one's ability to link significant past experiences with their imagination. Aphantasia is a disease that makes you not imagine.

==Perception==
[[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] posited that [[perception]]s depend on the world view of a person. The world view is the result of arranging perceptions into existing imagery by imagination. Piaget cites the example of a child saying that the moon is following her when she walks around the village at night. Like this, perceptions are integrated into the world view to make sense. Imagination is needed to make sense of perceptions.<ref>Piaget, J. (1967). The child's conception of the world. (J. & A. Tomlinson, Trans.). London: Routledge & Kegan Paul. BF721 .P5 1967X</ref>

==Brain activation==
A study using [[fMRI]] while subjects were asked to imagine precise visual figures, to mentally disassemble them, or mentally blend them, showed activity in the [[occipital lobe|occipital]],  frontoparietal, [[posterior parietal]], [[precuneus]], and [[dorsolateral prefrontal]] regions of the subject's brains.<ref>Alexander Schlegel, Peter J. Kohler, Sergey V. Fogelson, Prescott Alexander, Dedeepya Konuthula, and Peter Ulric Tse (Sep 16, 2013) [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/13/1311149110 Network structure and dynamics of the mental workspace] ''PNAS'' early edition</ref>

==Evolution==
[[File:TheoryLargeFigures.png|300px|thumb|Phylogenesis and ontogenesis of various components of imagination]]
[[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] acquisition of imagination was a gradual process. The simplest form of imagination, REM-sleep [[dream]]ing, evolved in [[mammals]] with acquisition of [[REM sleep]] 140 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hobson |first1=J.

==Moral Imagination== 
Moral imagination usually describes the mental capacity to find answers to ethical questions and dilemmas through the process of a mental and intellectual imagination and visualization.
 
Different definitions of "moral imagination" can be found in the literature.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Freeman, R. E. |author2=Dmytriyev, S.|author3= Wicks, A. C. |title=The moral imagination of Patricia werhane: A festschrift. |date=2018 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |pages=97}}</ref> 
 
One of the most prominent definitions was provided by the philosopher Mark Johnson: "An ability to imaginatively discern various possibilities for acting in a given situation and to envision the potential help and harm that are likely to result from a given action."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=M. |title=Moral imagination |date=1993 |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press. |page=202}}</ref>
 
In an article recently published in the Journal of Management History, the authors argued that Hitler Assassin Claus von Stauffenberg decided to dare to overthrow the Nazi regime in particular (among other factors) as a result of a process of "moral imagination." His willingness to kill Hitler was less due to his compassion for his comrades, his family or friends living at that time (actual people living at that time), but originated rather from the fact that he was already thinking about the potential problems of later generations and people he did not know. In other words, through a process of “moral imagination” he developed empathy for "abstract" people (for examples, Germans of later generations, people who were not yet alive).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Langhof, J. G.|author2= Gueldenberg, S. |title=Whom to serve?
