'''The Faint''' is an American [[indie rock]] band. Formed in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the band consists of [[Todd Fink]], Graham Ulicny, Dapose and [[Clark Baechle]]. The Faint was originally known as '''Norman Bailer''' and included [[Conor Oberst]] (of [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], with whom The Faint toured in 2005). He quit shortly after the band was formed,<ref name=faintprofile>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030810005332/http://www.thefaint.com/profile/ The Faint // Profile], ''The Faint'', (2005-01-27). Retrieved 2008-05-09.</ref> though the Faint continued to share a spot with Bright Eyes on [[Saddle Creek Records]].

==History==
Growing up, Fink, Petersen, and Baechle [[Skateboarding|skateboarded]] in their free time, until Fink developed knee problems, which shifted their hobbies towards making music.<ref name=faintyoutubeinterview>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyycYQfIhjg The Faint // Youtube Interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520044638/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyycYQfIhjg |date=May 20, 2016 }}, ''BeatLawrence Interviews the Faint'', (2007-10-21). Retrieved 2008-05-09.</ref> The band originally consisted of [[Clark Baechle]], [[Todd Fink]] (formerly Todd Baechle), and [[Joel Petersen]]. They signed to [[Saddle Creek Records]] and released a few singles, but were unable to establish widespread sales. After adding Matt Bowen, the Faint released ''[[Media (album)|Media]]''. At the end of 1998, [[Jacob Thiele]] joined the band, and shortly thereafter, Matt Bowen was replaced by Ethan Jones. They toured the [[United States|U.S.]], playing what would become the songs that would comprise the next album, ''[[Blank-Wave Arcade]]'', which had a more dance and techno influenced sound and was an underground hit.<ref name=lazy-i_interview>[http://www.timmcmahan.com/macabre.htm Lazy-i // Interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915010806/http://www.timmcmahan.com/macabre.htm |date=September 15, 2015 }}, ''The Faint: men in black'', (2001-08-15). Retrieved 2008-05-09.</ref> Before recording the album, however, Jones left the band and was replaced on bass guitar by Joel Petersen, who played both bass and guitar on the album.  Partway through the creation of ''[[Danse Macabre (album)|Danse Macabre]]'', the Faint added Dapose, a [[death metal]] guitarist formerly of LEAD. Their next album, recorded with [[Mike Mogis]] and released in 2004, was called ''[[Wet from Birth]]''. Conor Oberst claimed in an August 2020 interview with [[Pitchfork Magazine]] that The Faint were offered a major label record deal, but turned it down out of loyalty and commitment to [[Saddle Creek]], which at the time was still a collaborative project between members of The Faint, [[Cursive]] and [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]]. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Sodomsky |first1=Sam |title=The Music That Made Conor Oberst |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/the-music-that-made-bright-eyes-conor-oberst/|website=pitchfork.com|publisher=Pitchfork |access-date=March 6, 2021}}</ref>

In May 2008, the Faint announced that they had split from [[Saddle Creek]], and that their fifth studio album would be self-released under their own label, blank.wav. The album, entitled ''[[Fasciinatiion]]'', was released on August 5, 2008 in the U.S. The first single from the album was "The Geeks Were Right", which was released on [[Boys Noize]] Records. It was also announced that the band would tour North America with British electronic group [[Ladytron]] during the spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/64480/ladytron |title=Ladytron and the Faint to Tour Together |access-date=2009-02-13 |date=2009-02-12 |publisher=[[idiomag]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219171115/http://idiomag.com/peek/64480/ladytron |archive-date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref>

Since the release of ''[[Fasciinatiion]]'', two of the band members, [[Clark Baechle]] and [[Todd Fink]] have been quietly, with little advertising, performing under the name Depressed Buttons, playing remixes of other artists, and DJing for various small clubs and venues.

The band performed an original song "Teach Me Teacher" on the children's show [[Yo Gabba Gabba!]] in the third-season episode "School", which originally aired September 19, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8frUBgyoP4 |title=Teach Me - The Faint - Yo Gaba Gaba |access-date=2021-03-06 |date=2010-09-10}}</ref> 

On October 30, 2012, [[Saddle Creek Records]] released a deluxe edition of ''[[Danse Macabre (album)|Danse Macabre]]'' with the original album remastered, bonus and unreleased tracks, and a DVD of archival footage, live projections from that era's tour dates, and live footage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://saddle-creek.com/store/550 |title=The Faint Danse Macabre (Deluxe Edition) [Remastered] |access-date=15 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825161638/http://saddle-creek.com/store/550 |archive-date=25 August 2012 }}</ref> The band announced that it would play ''[[Danse Macabre (album)|Danse Macabre]]'' in its entirety along with fan favorites during a tour of 24 cities across North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefaint.com/ |title=The Faint website |access-date=15 September 2012}}</ref>

In 2016, Graham Ulicny (of [[Reptar (band)|Reptar]]) replaced Jacob Thiele on keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasvegasweekly.com/ae/music/2016/oct/19/interview-faint-frontman-todd-fink-gang-of-four/ |title=Frontman Todd Fink Talks 'Refuturizing' The Faint and Touring with Gang of Four' |access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref> Thiele died on February 13, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coffey |first1=Kevin |title=Former member of The Faint, Jacob Thiele, has died.

''Vverevvolf Grehv'' (pronounced as Werewolf Grave) is the brainchild of Dapose.  The music of Vverevvolf Grehv combines the brutality of [[death metal]], the tempos of [[speed metal]] and the sonic decimation of [[noise music|noise]] with the complexities of electronic music genres such as [[snare rush]] and [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]].  He is influenced by [[Merzbow]]’s work, the writings of [[Howard Bloom]], and numerous classical composers.
