'''Natalie Anne Merchant''' (born October 26, 1963) is an American [[alternative rock]] singer-songwriter.<ref name="Larkin"/> She joined the band [[10,000 Maniacs]] in 1981, and was lead vocalist and primary lyricist for the group. She remained with the group for their first seven albums and left it to begin her solo career in 1993. She has since released seven studio albums.

==Early life==
Natalie Merchant was born October 26, 1963, in [[Jamestown, New York]],<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=835/6}}</ref> the third of four children of Anthony and Anne Merchant. Her paternal grandfather, who played the [[accordion]], [[mandolin]] and guitar, emigrated to the United States from [[Sicily]]; his surname was "Mercante" before it was [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]].<ref name=Cromelin />

When Merchant was a child, her mother listened to music (primarily [[Petula Clark]] but also [[the Beatles]], [[Al Green]], [[Aretha Franklin]])<ref name="Buffalo News" /> and encouraged her children to study music, but would not allow TV after Natalie was 12. "I was taken to the symphony a lot because my mother loved classical music. But I was dragged to see [[Styx (band)|Styx]] when I was 12. We had to drive 100 miles to [[Buffalo, New York]]. Someone threw up next to me and people were smoking pot. It was terrifying. I remember Styx had a white piano which rose out of the stage. It was awe-inspiring and inspirational."<ref name=Q /> "She [her mother] had show tunes, she had the soundtrack from ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]''. And then eventually... she'd always liked classical music and then she married a jazz musician, so that's the kind of music I was into. I never really had friends who sat around and listened to the stereo and said 'hey, listen to this one', so I'd never even heard of who [[Bob Dylan]] was until I was 18."<ref name="Melody Maker" /> Merchant says she did not have a TV between 1988 and 1989: "I grew up in a house where no one watched the news on television and no one read the paper. I've been discovering these things as I get older, and the news has affected me more than it ever has before."<ref name=SDUT />

Merchant started working in a health food store at 16.<ref name=VanMeter /> She considered a career in special education after taking part in a summer program for disabled children, but in 1981 she started singing for a band, Still Life, that became [[10,000 Maniacs]].<ref name=VanMeter />

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=April 2017}}

===10,000 Maniacs===
{{Main|10,000 Maniacs}}
[[File:Natalie merchant1.jpg|thumb|upright|Merchant became known for her swirling style of dancing and her simple dress while performing with 10,000 Maniacs.]]
Merchant was lead singer and primary lyricist for 10,000 Maniacs, joining in its infancy in 1981 while she was a student at [[Jamestown Community College]].<ref name="Larkin"/> The group recorded their album ''Human Conflict Number Five'', and recorded a corresponding [[music video]] at the Hotel Franklin and at Group W Westinghouse studios in Jamestown, New York, in 1982. Merchant sang lead vocals, and later played the piano as well on seven studio albums with 10,000 Maniacs. In 1993 she announced that she was leaving the group, citing a lack of creative control over the music she wrote with the band.<ref name=press /> Her last recording with the band, a cover of Bruce Springsteen's and Patti Smith's "Because the Night" at the 10,000 Maniacs ''MTV Unplugged'' performance, reached #11 on the Hot 100 chart on February 18, 1994; becoming the band's highest-charting song in the U.S.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/10000-maniacs|title=10,000 Maniacs|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=July 7, 2020}}</ref>

===''Tigerlily'' (1995)===
[[File:Natalie Merchant.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Merchant in 1995 at [[Earth Day]] in [[Columbia, Maryland]]]]
After her split with 10,000 Maniacs, Merchant was so eager to begin writing her own material that she went home that very day and composed the song "I May Know the Word", which was originally meant to appear on the soundtrack to the [[Tom Hanks]] movie ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> The song was eventually cut from the soundtrack, but it would go on to appear on Merchant's debut solo album, ''[[Tigerlily]]'', which was released on the [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] label in 1995.<ref name="Larkin"/> Merchant chose to name the album that as she felt it captured the album's feel, which she described as both "fierce" and "delicate".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The third song on the album, "Beloved Wife", was featured as the first song in the [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for the film ''[[Message in a Bottle (film)|Message in a Bottle]]''.

Seeking creative control, Merchant chose to fund the album herself, refusing the [[Advance money|advance]] from the record company. She also wanted to work with a core group of young musicians who she felt would be enthusiastic about the music.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}} The group would consist of guitarist [[Jennifer Turner (musician)|Jennifer Turner]], bassist Barrie Maguire, and former [[The Wallflowers|Wallflower]] and eventual boyfriend, [[Peter Yanowitz]], who played drums on the album,<ref name="Larkin"/> and who continued to do so with the singer until their abrupt split in 2000.

''Tigerlily'' was a critical and commercial success, spawning her first top-ten hit in the single "[[Carnival (Natalie Merchant song)|Carnival]]", and achieving top-40 success with subsequent singles "[[Wonder (Natalie Merchant song)|Wonder]]" and "Jealousy". The album would go on to sell over five million copies, and continues to be Merchant's most successful album to date. She did extensive touring for it and made numerous television appearances, including performances on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and on late-night talk shows. The media's immediate and critical effect on culture and cultural icons was of particular interest to Merchant.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In "River", a song from ''Tigerlily'', Merchant defends [[River Phoenix]] as she castigates the media for systematically dissecting the child actor after his death.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===''Ophelia'' (1998–1999)===
{{See also|Ophelia (album)}}
Three years passed before Merchant released her second solo effort, ''[[Ophelia (album)|Ophelia]]''. While ''Tigerlily'' contained sparse instrumentation, the music on ''Ophelia'' had lusher arrangements. The reprise at the close of the album featured a symphonic arrangement composed and conducted by British composer [[Gavin Bryars]] with whom she would collaborate nine years later to put Shakespeare's sonnets to music.<ref>{{cite web|title=NOTHING LIKE THE SUN – Merchant collaborates with British composer Gavin Bryars to put sonnets to music for The Royal Shakespeare Company's festival|url=http://www.nataliemerchant.com/news/2007/2/28|website=The Official Natalie Merchant Website|access-date=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Merchant treated the recording of ''Ophelia'' as a series of workshops, where she would invite various musicians she had met over the years into her home studio to collaborate and record. While ''Ophelia'' is not a concept record in the traditional sense, the name of the album and the title track are a literary reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Ophelia]].

The first single off the album was a happy and uncharacteristically simple song called "[[Kind and Generous]]", which received massive airplay on [[VH1]] and which solidified Merchant's role as a bona fide solo artist. That summer, [[Sarah McLachlan]] invited Merchant to co-headline the year's biggest music festival with her, [[Lilith Fair]]. The exposure from the tour helped the album reach Platinum status in just under a year, with subsequent singles "[[Break Your Heart (Natalie Merchant song)|Break Your Heart]]" and "Life Is Sweet" receiving moderate airplay on adult contemporary stations. No video was filmed for the latter, however, with a clip from Merchant's appearance on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'' being used instead. She would also go on to appear on [[PBS]]' ''[[Sessions at West 54th]]'' and VH1's ''[[Hard Rock Live]]'' before the year's end. In 1998, Merchant also recorded [[George Gershwin]]'s "But Not for Me" for the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Red Hot + Rhapsody]]'', a tribute to [[George Gershwin]], which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing [[AIDS]] awareness and fighting the disease.

The ''Ophelia'' tour ended in 1999 with the final few shows being performed and recorded on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The performance would be released as the album ''[[Live in Concert (Natalie Merchant album)|Natalie Merchant: Live in Concert]]'' with a companion video of the same name. The performance was notable in that it featured numerous covers including songs by [[David Bowie]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Katell Keineg]].

In 1998, Merchant collaborated on the making of the album ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' with [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Wilco]], which set previously unreleased Guthrie lyrics to music by Bragg. She provided lead vocals for the song "Birds and Ships" and backing vocals for "Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/when-words-arent-enough-6359716 |title=When Words Aren't Enough |last=Harris |first=Michael C. |date=August 6, 1998 |website=[[miaminewtimes.com]] |access-date=August 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wilcoworld.net/song/way-over-yonder-in-the-minor-key/ |title=Way Over Yonder In The Minor Key |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Wilcoworld.net |access-date=August 21, 2021}}</ref> and returned for the second volume of the album, 2000s ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. II]]'', providing  vocals on the song "I Was Born".

===American folk music tour (2000) and ''Motherland'' (2001)===
In 2000, Merchant embarked on a folk tour in the United States with many shows being supported by alt-country band [[Wilco]].

Merchant's next studio album on the [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] label was ''[[Motherland (Natalie Merchant album)|Motherland]]'', released in 2001. ''Motherland'' saw Merchant at her most experimental musically. ''Motherland'' achieved Gold on the Billboard charts after debuting at No. 30 on the Billboard 200 and No. 13 on the Top Internet Albums of 2001, respectively. ''Rolling Stone'' favored this album with 3½ stars, and also noticed a difference in Merchant's voice, which was more deep and gritty like that of [[Sade (singer)|Sade]] than her previous albums. Singles that were released from ''Motherland'' were "[[Just Can't Last]]", "[[Build a Levee]]" and "Tell Yourself".

Merchant embarked on a year and a half world tour to promote ''Motherland''. The first leg of the tour started in Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 17, 2001, with performances across the United States, and heading to Europe with some special acoustic shows in Europe. Merchant also participated in the [[Rock am Ring]] Festival and [[Rock im Park]] in 2002. In the summer of 2002, she was paired with [[Chris Isaak]] and played at stadiums and arenas.

===''The House Carpenter's Daughter'' (2003)===
[[File:Natalie merchant2.jpg|thumb|Merchant at the piano in 2005]]

After her contract with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] expired in August 2002, Merchant decided not to sign with them again, or any other major label.<ref name=Pareles /> Her next studio album, ''[[The House Carpenter's Daughter]]'', was released in September 2003 on her own label, Myth America Records. To date this has been the only release on Myth America.

===''Leave Your Sleep'' (2010)===
In October 2009, the websites of [[Nonesuch Records]] and Natalie Merchant announced that she had signed with the label. ''[[Leave Your Sleep]]'' was released on April 13, 2010<ref name="LeaveYourSleepRelease">{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/natalie-merchant-marks-release-of-leave-your-sleep-npr-morning-edition-abc-gma-bbc-sheer-ravishing-beauty-2010-04-13 |title=Merchant Marks Release of "Leave Your Sleep" on NPR's "Morning Edition," ABC's "GMA"; BBC Cites Its "Sheer Ravishing Beauty" &#124; Nonesuch Records |publisher=Nonesuch.com |date=April 13, 2010 |access-date=May 15, 2015}}</ref> and is a compilation of five years of inspiration from a "conversation" with her daughter over the "first 6 years of her life". The album debuted on the Billboard Top 200 at No. 17, Billboard Folk Albums at No. 1, Amazon.com at No.1, and [[iTunes]], No. 3. The album was co-produced by [[Andres Levin]].

Merchant contributed a cover of [[Buddy Holly]]'s "Learning the Game" to the tribute album ''[[Listen to Me: Buddy Holly]]'', released September 6, 2011.

===''Natalie Merchant'' (2014)===
In February 2014, Merchant announced her [[Natalie Merchant (album)|eponymous]] album. The album consists of new works. It is her first collection of original material since 2001's ''Motherland''. ''Natalie Merchant'' was released May 6, 2014, on Nonesuch Records and was named Album of the Week by ''The Daily Telegraph.''{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The album debuted at #20 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top 200 albums and #2 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Folk Albums charts for the week of May 24, 2014.  She toured from July 3, 2014, kicking off in Kingston, New York, concluding at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee on July 25, 2014.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===''Paradise Is There: The New Tigerlily Recordings'' (2015)===
In 2015, Merchant released an album of new recordings of the songs from her multi-platinum solo album. She enhanced many of the tracks with strings and stripped others bare. She says, "The distance this music traveled once it left my hands is humbling, and I am moved by how many lives it has touched along the way."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Records|first1=Nonesuch|title=Natalie Merchant's "Paradise Is There: The New Tigerlily Recordings" with Companion Documentary on DVD Out Now|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/natalie-merchant-paradise-there-new-tigerlily-recordings-dvd-out-now-2015-11-06|website=Nonesuch.com|publisher=Nonesuch Records|access-date=January 23, 2018}}</ref>

===''Butterfly'' (2017)===

==Personal life==
Merchant met [[Michael Stipe]] of the band [[R.E.M.]] in 1983. The two became close friends and eventually had a romantic relationship. The two credit each other as inspirations for some of their songwriting. In an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', Stipe said "Natalie was really the reason my work became politicised in the late Eighties."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met-michael-stipe-and-natalie-merchant-1183710.html|title=How we met: Michael Stipe and Natalie Merchant|date=November 8, 1998|website=Independent.co.uk|access-date=March 16, 2018}}</ref>

In 2003, Merchant married Daniel de la Calle and had a daughter named Lucia. In an interview in 2012, she indicated that she was divorced.<ref name=StudioA /><ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/31/natalie-merchant_n_1243224.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Laura | last=Rowley | title=Natalie Merchant On Motherhood As Muse | date=January 31, 2012}}</ref>

Merchant enjoys gardening and painting.<ref name=Vox /> Some of her paintings can be seen on her website. She has been a [[vegetarian]] since 1980,<ref name=VT /> except for the duration of her pregnancy when she temporarily resumed eating meat.<ref name=StudioA /> In 1997, she said: {{blockquote
|The '60s aesthetic has never really appealed to me, the tie-dyed [[Deadhead]] running barefoot through the forest on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. I don't think that's really me. But I've been a vegetarian for 17 years, and I consider myself an environmentalist in as much as I can be, considering the job that I have. I prefer living in the countryside rather than the city{{emdash}}I find it more sane and sustaining for myself.<ref name=IndianapolisStar />}}

==Activism==
In 2012, Merchant, along with actor and writer [[Mark Ruffalo]], organized a concert to protest oil and gas fracking in New York state. A documentary, written and directed by [[Jon Bowermaster]], was made of the event and titled ''Dear Governor Cuomo''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gunpowdersky.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019195943/http://www.filmbuff.com/films/1938|url-status=dead|title=Gunpowder & Sky &#124; An Independent Global Studio|date=February 19, 2019|archive-date=October 19, 2013|website=Gunpowdersky.com|access-date=October 6, 2019}}</ref>  She directed a short 2013 documentary titled ''Shelter: A Concert Film to Benefit Victims of Domestic Violence'', that shone light on a group of women living in the mid-Hudson region of New York State responding to the crisis of domestic violence in their community with compassion and creativity. It was inspired by an event for One Billion Rising, a global campaign calling for an end to violence against women, held on February 14, 2013. Merchant presented a screening of the film at the [[Old Dutch Church (Kingston, New York)|Old Dutch Church in Kingston, New York]], on the day of One Billion Rising for Justice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/watch-natalie-merchant-shelter-concert-film-inspired-one-billion-rising-2014-02-11 |title=Watch: Natalie Merchant's "SHELTER" Concert Film Inspired by One Billion Rising &#124; Nonesuch Records |publisher=Nonesuch.com |date=February 11, 2014 |access-date=May 9, 2014}}</ref>
