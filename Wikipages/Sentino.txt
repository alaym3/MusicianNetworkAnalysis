The '''Sentino''' is a tributary of the [[Esino]] River, which springs at 750 m above sea level above the mountains of [[Gubbio]], in [[Umbria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiumi.com/acque/index.php?id_g=251|title=Torrente Sentino|website=www.fiumi.com|access-date=2019-08-27|language=it}}</ref> The Sentino flows from the north-eastern slope of Madonna della Cima.

The source gushes from the north-eastern slope of Madonna della Cima and initially flows through the hills of the pre-Apennines of Gubbio, collecting the influx of many small streams.

When it reaches the village of [[Scheggia e Pascelupo|Scheggia]], it cuts through the chain of [[Apennines]], creating the Gola del Corno del Catria, located in the northern sector of the [[Monte Cucco]]  Park.

Having crossed the Apennines, the Sentino enters the [[Marche]] region through a valley dotted with hermitages and monasteries, including [[Sant'Emiliano in Congiuntoli]], until it reaches the town of [[Sassoferrato]]: the ancient Roman city of ''[[Sentinum]]'', from which it takes its name.

Continuing its course, the river meets the [[Fabriano]] pre-Apennines generating the imposing Frasassi Gorge, famous for [[Frasassi Caves|the homonymous cave]], which the Sentino in the past has contributed to its genesis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.frasassi.com/GrotteGenesi.aspx?L=IT|title=Grotte di Frasassi|website=www.frasassi.com|access-date=2019-08-27|language=it}}</ref>

Once past the Frasassi Gorge, near San Vittore Terme, the Sentino concludes its 42 km journey by meeting the [[Esino]] River, of which it becomes its main tributary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertobarbaresi.it/articoli-itinerari/il-torrente-sentino/|title=Il torrente Sentino|website=robertobarbaresi.it - Pesca alla trota in torrente - Ambienti Trote Tecniche Itinerari Info|language=it|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref> 

The average flow rate of the Sentino is about 3 mÂ³/s.
