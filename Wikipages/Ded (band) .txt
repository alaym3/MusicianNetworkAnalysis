'''Ded''' (stylized as '''DED''') is an American [[nu metal]] band from [[Tempe, Arizona]] made up of members from [[Greeley Estates]] and [[Man Made Machine]]. The band released its debut track "FMFY" in December 2016 with production by [[John Feldmann]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://puregrainaudio.com/videos/ded-release-deadly-new-lyric-video-for-fmfy-exclusive-premiere |title=DED Release 'Deadly' New Lyric Video for "FMFY" |publisher=Puregrainaudio.com |date=December 21, 2016|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}</ref> Ded followed up with its first radio single "Anti-Everything" on February 3, 2017 with an exclusive premiere on [[Sirius XM Octane]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://loudwire.com/ded-anti-everything-exclusive-lyric-video-premiere |title=DED, 'Anti-Everything' - Exclusive Lyric Video Premiere |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=February 23, 2017|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}</ref>

The origins of the ensemble can be traced to Arizona band The Cover Up.  Lead vocalist Joe Cotela stated that things with The Cover Up were approaching a standstill, and that they were performing music influenced by [[Every Time I Die]].  Because the band was dissatisfied with Epic Records not properly promoting the album, the band decided to move on.<ref>{{cite web|author=Carlos Ramirez|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2011/09/19/man-made-machine-begin-interview |title=Man Made Machine Looked to '90s Rock for Inspiration on Their Debut Album |publisher=Noisecreep.com |date=September 19, 2011 |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}</ref>

This dissolution eventually formed [[Man Made Machine]].
