'''Stanley Allison Rogers''' (November 29, 1949 – June 2, 1983)<ref name="Cove"/> was a Canadian [[folk music]]ian and songwriter.

Rogers was noted for his rich, [[baritone]] voice and his traditional-sounding songs which were frequently inspired by [[Canadian history]] and the daily lives of working people, especially those from the fishing villages of the [[Maritime provinces]] and, later, the farms of the [[Canadian prairies]] and [[Great Lakes]].<ref>Edwards, Melissa. "The Stan Rogers Map of Canada". ''The Geist Atlas of Canada'', Arsenal Pulp Press, Vancouver, BC. page 70.</ref> Rogers died in a fire aboard [[Air Canada Flight 797]] on the ground at the [[Greater Cincinnati Airport]] at the age of 33.

==Early life and musical development==
Rogers was born in [[Hamilton, Ontario]],<ref name="Cove">{{cite web|url=http://stanrogers.net/about/stan-rogers|work=Stan Rogers Biographies|title=Stan Rogers biodata|publisher=Fogarty's Cove Music|access-date=October 30, 2015}}</ref> the eldest son of Nathan Allison Rogers and Valerie (née Bushell) Rogers, two [[Maritimers]] who had relocated to [[Ontario]] in search of work shortly after their marriage in July 1948.

It was there that he became familiar with the way of life in the [[Maritimes]], an influence which was to have a profound impact on his subsequent musical development. He was interested in music from an early age, reportedly beginning to sing shortly after learning to speak.<ref name="O'Kane2016"/> He received his first guitar, a miniature hand-built by his uncle Lee Bushell, when he was five years of age.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Stan Rogers shows off his first guitar|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/stan-rogers-shows-off-his-first-guitar|access-date=January 3, 2018|series=Canada After Dark|first=Paul|last=Soles|network=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=November 30, 1978|via=CBC Digital Archives}}</ref> He was exposed to a variety of music influences, but among the most lasting were the [[country and western]] tunes his uncles would sing during family get-togethers.

Rogers signed with [[RCA Records]] in 1970 and recorded two singles: "Here's to You Santa Claus" in 1970,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Copyright Office|year=1970 |title=Music: Current and Renewal Registrations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oj0hAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1926|journal=Catalog of Copyright Entries|series=3rd|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|publication-date=1971|volume=24, Part 5|issue=2, Section I|page=1926}}</ref> and "The Fat Girl Rag" in 1971.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Copyright Office|year=1971|title=Music: Current and Renewal Registrations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkMhAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1544|journal=Catalog of Copyright Entries|series=3rd|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Library of Congress|publication-date=1972|volume=25, Part 5|issue=1, Section I|page=1544}}</ref> In 1973, Rogers recorded three singles for Polygram: "Three Pennies", "Guysborough Train", and "Past Fifty."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Copyright Office|year=1973|title=Music: Current and Renewal Registrations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0shAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA2402|journal=Catalog of Copyright Entries|series=3rd|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Library of Congress|publication-date=1974|volume=27, Part 5|issue=2, Section I|page=2402}}</ref>

In 1976, Rogers recorded his debut album, ''Fogarty's Cove'', released in 1977 on Barnswallow Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lccn.loc.gov/88751368|title=Fogarty's Cove [sound recording]|last=Rogers|first=Stan|year=1977|website=Library of Congress Online Catalogue|publisher=Fogarty's Cove Music|location=Hamilton, Ontario, Canada|access-date=February 24, 2017|quote=Originally released in 1977 on Barn Swallow Records, BS 1001.}}</ref> The album's subject matter dealt almost entirely with life in [[Maritimes|maritime Canada]], and was an immediate success. Rogers then formed [[Fogarty's Cove Music]], and bought Barnswallow during the production of ''Turnaround'', allowing him to release his own albums. [[posthumous work|Posthumously]], additional albums were released.
 
<!---Significant passage about his musical development required here----->
Rogers' songs often had a [[Celtic music|Celtic]] feel which was due, in part, to his frequent use of [[DADGAD]] guitar tuning. He regularly used his [[William Laskin|William 'Grit' Laskin]] built [[12-string guitar]] in his performances. His best-known pieces include "[[Northwest Passage (song)|Northwest Passage]]", "[[Barrett's Privateers]]", "[[The Mary Ellen Carter]]", "[[Make and Break Harbour]]", "[[The Idiot (song)|The Idiot]]", "[[Fogarty's Cove]]", and "[[White Squall (song)|White Squall]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stanrogers.net/about/stan-rogers/|title=Stan Rogers Biographies|date=September 21, 2020|website=Fogarty's Cove Music}}</ref>

==Death==
Rogers died alongside 22 other passengers most likely of [[smoke inhalation]] on June 2, 1983, while traveling on [[Air Canada Flight 797]] (a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]) after performing at the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]]. The airliner was flying from [[Dallas]], Texas, to [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]] when a fire of unknown ignition source within the vanity or toilet shroud of the aft washroom forced it to make an [[emergency landing]] at the [[Greater Cincinnati Airport]] in northern Kentucky. There were initially no visible flames, and after attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, smoke filled the cabin. Upon landing, the plane's doors were opened, allowing the five crew and 18 of the 41 passengers to escape, but approximately 90 seconds into the evacuation the oxygen rushing in from outside caused a flash fire.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR86-02.pdf |author=Bureau of Accident Investigation |title=NTSB/AAR-86/02 |date=January 31, 1986 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |location=Washington, D.C. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322014736/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR86-02.pdf |archive-date=March 22, 2006 |url-status=unfit |via=AirDisaster.Com}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Rogers' remains were cremated, and his ashes were scattered off the coast of [[Nova Scotia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/10511652/stan-rogers|title=Stan Rogers (1949-1983)|work=[[Find A Grave]]|access-date=2020-12-17}}</ref>

Rogers' legacy includes his recordings, songbook, and plays for which he was commissioned to write music. His songs are still frequently covered by other musicians, and are perennial favourites at Canadian [[campfires]] and [[song circles]]. Members of Rogers' band, including his brother [[Garnet Rogers]], continue to be active performers and form a significant part of the fabric of contemporary Canadian folk music. Following his death, he was nominated for the [[Juno Awards of 1984|1984 Juno Awards]] in the category for [[Juno Award for Artist of the Year|Best Male Vocalist]]. That same year, he was posthumously awarded the Diplôme d’Honneur of the [[Canadian Conference of the Arts]].<ref name="CCArts">{{cite web |title=Diplôme d'honneur: Past Recipients |url=http://ccarts.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Diplome-dhonneur-recipients-2011.pdf |publisher=Canadian Conference of the Arts |access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref> In 1994, his posthumous live album ''[[Home in Halifax]]'' was likewise nominated for [[Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year – Solo|Best Roots and Traditional Album]].

His widow, Ariel, continues to oversee his estate and legacy. His music and lyrics have been featured in numerous written publications and films. For instance, his lyrics have appeared in school poetry books,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} taking their place alongside acknowledged classics. His song "[[Northwest Passage (song)|Northwest Passage]]" was featured in the last episode of the TV show ''[[Due South]]'', his songs "[[Barrett's Privateers]]" and "[[Watching the Apples Grow]]" having been previously featured. "Barrett's Privateers" has also been used extensively in promotion ads for [[Alexander Keith's Brewery|Alexander Keith's]] ale. In the 2005 [[CTV television network|CTV]] [[made-for-TV movie]] on the life of [[Terry Fox]], Rogers' "[[Turnaround (song)|Turnaround]]" is the music over the closing shot. As the movie ends, Fox is depicted, alone, striding up a hill, while the lyric "And yours was the open road. The bitter song / The heavy load that I'll never share, tho' the offer's still there / Every time you turn around," forges a link between these Canadian icons.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Many of his songs on the albums ''[[Northwest Passage (album)|Northwest Passage]]'' and ''[[From Fresh Water]]'' refer to events in Canadian history.

[[Adrienne Clarkson]], who, prior to serving as the [[Governor General of Canada]] from 1999 to 2005, had worked for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], highlighted Rogers' career in a 1989 television documentary called ''[[One Warm Line]]'' on [[CBC Television]]; she also quoted Rogers in her investitural address.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

When CBC's [[Peter Gzowski]] asked Canadians to pick an alternate national anthem, "Northwest Passage" was the overwhelming choice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Enright |first1=Michael |title=Stan Rogers: Folk Singer, Storyteller, Proud Canadian Part 2 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/rewind/stan-rogers-folk-singer-storyteller-proud-canadian-part-2-1.3239078 |date=July 7, 2016 |website=CBC Rewind with Michael Enright |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=April 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=The Great Canadian Song Contest |series=Morningside |series-link=Morningside (radio program) |first=Peter |last=Gzowski |station=CBC Radio |date=March 3, 1995 }}</ref>

The [[Stan Rogers Folk Festival]] is held every year in [[Canso, Nova Scotia]]. In 1995, several artists performed two nights of concerts at Halifax's [[Rebecca Cohn Auditorium]], which were released on album that year as ''[[Remembering Stan Rogers]]''.

Rogers is also a lasting fixture of the Canadian folk festival [[Summerfolk Music and Crafts Festival|Summerfolk]], held annually in [[Owen Sound, Ontario]], where the main stage and amphitheater are dedicated as the "Stan Rogers Memorial Canopy". The festival is firmly fixed in tradition, with Rogers' song "[[The Mary Ellen Carter]]" being sung by all involved, including the audience and a medley of acts at the festival.

At [[Canmore Folk Music Festival|The Canmore Folk Festival]], Alberta's longest running folk music festival, performers take to the Stan Rogers Memorial Stage, which is the festival's main stage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Stan's son, [[Nathan Rogers]], is also an established Canadian folk artist with a voice and lyrical acumen similar to his father's.  He has released two critically acclaimed solo discs and tours internationally as a solo act and in the trio, Dry Bones.

In 2007, Rogers was recognized posthumously with a National Achievement Award at the annual [[SOCAN]] Awards held in Toronto.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160810134100/http://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2007-socan-awards]</ref>

Canadian Celtic rock band [[Enter the Haggis]] regularly performs a cover of “White Squall” to end their shows, and included it on their 2011 album ''Whitelake''.

In 2011, the pirate metal band [[Alestorm]] released a cover of Rogers' song "Barrett's Privateers" (Label Napalm Records).

In 2013, Groundwood Books turned Rogers' song "Northwest Passage" into a children's book illustrated by award-winning artist Matt James.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Northwest Passage|url=https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/13584765-northwest-passage|access-date=25 September 2021|website=Goodreads.com}}</ref>

In 2017, Canadian [[Celtic punk]] band, [[The Real McKenzies]], released a cover of Rogers' "Northwest Passage" on their album ''Two Devils Will Talk.''

In 2019, Canadian metal band [[Unleash the Archers]] released a cover of Rogers' "Northwest Passage" on Napalm Records.

In 2019, Canadian folk punk band [[The Dreadnoughts]] released a cover of Rogers' "Northwest Passage", as well as a commemorative song named "Dear Old Stan", on Stomp Records.

In 2020, [[Canadian Premier League]] soccer club [[HFX Wanderers FC]]'s home kit featured a soundwave image taken from Rogers' "Barrett's Privateers", inspired in part by the song's adoption by Privateers 1882, a supporters group of the Wanderers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Marty |title=4 easy-to-miss flourishes from the 2020 CPL home kits |url=https://canpl.ca/article/4-easy-to-miss-flourishes-from-the-2020-cpl-home-kits |website=Canadian Premier League |access-date=February 28, 2020}}</ref>
