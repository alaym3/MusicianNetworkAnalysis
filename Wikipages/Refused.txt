Refused is composed of vocalist [[Dennis Lyxzén]], guitarist [[Kristofer Steen]], drummer [[David Sandström]], and bassist Magnus Flagge. Guitarist [[Jon Brännström]] was a member from 1994, through reunions, until he was fired in late-2014. Their lyrics are often of a non-conformist and politically far-left nature.{{r|burningheart2}}{{r|allmusic}}

On 9 January 2012, the band announced their reunion confirming shows at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Rock am Ring]], [[Ruisrock]], [[Roskilde Festival]], [[Groezrock]], [[Way Out West Festival]], [[Sonisphere Festival]] (cancelled), [[Download Festival]], [[Rock for People]], [[Primavera Sound]], [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]], [[Fuji Rock Festival]], [[Øyafestivalen]], [[Pukkelpop]], [[Resurrection Fest|Resurrection]]. After embarking on a [[Refused Reunion Tour|world tour]] for nearly a year, Refused went on hiatus again in 2012, but announced another reunion in November 2014.

The band released five EPs and three full-length albums before originally splitting up in 1998, and released their fourth full-length album ''[[Freedom (Refused album)|Freedom]]'' on the [[Epitaph Records]] label on 26 June 2015. "Elektra" was released as the first single from the comeback album on 27 April 2015.<ref name="Lam">{{cite web|author1=Lamington23|title=Refused on lying, selling outand Taylor Swift|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/43137/Refused-on-lying-selling-out-and-Taylor-Swift|website=FasterLouder.com.au|access-date=28 June 2015|date=24 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628081410/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/43137/Refused-on-lying-selling-out-and-Taylor-Swift|archive-date=28 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

With an already altered lineup (including [[Kristofer Steen]] joining from local band [[Abhinanda]] with Pär Hansson going the other way) the band released their first [[studio album]], ''[[This Just Might Be the Truth]]'', in 1994. A month later, they released the ''[[Everlasting (EP)|Everlasting]]'' EP.

Refused's final line-up consisted of Dennis Lyxzén, David Sandström, Kristofer Steen, and Jon Brännström, but the band never found a permanent [[Bass guitar|bass]] player, switching up to 12 bassists until their original break-up.<ref name=popsongs>{{cite web|access-date=2 December 2017|url=http://popsongsfortherevolution.noisey.com/|title= REFUSED: Pop Songs for the Revolution |first=Dan |last=Ozzi|location=United States|website=[[Noisey]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701173248/http://popsongsfortherevolution.noisey.com/|archive-date=1 July 2015}}</ref> In June 1996, they released ''[[Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent]]'' through [[Victory Records]].

===''The Shape of Punk to Come'' and disbandment (1998)===
Their third album, 1998's ''[[The Shape of Punk to Come]]'', incorporated diverse sounds outside of the strict hardcore realm, such as [[electronica]], [[jazz]], and [[ambient (music)|ambient]]. Initially, the album was both a commercial and critical failure, with little media coverage and mixed reception from fans and critics alike; some even refused to rate it because of its stylistic divergence.<ref name=popsongs/><ref name="in effect">{{cite web|access-date=29 November 2017|url=https://www.ineffecthardcore.com/reviews/archive-reviews-feb-2012-to-sep-2012/|title=Refused @ Fieri Arena Milano, Italy June 4, 2012|first=Tim|last=Edwards|website=Ineffecthardcore.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171129073241/https://www.ineffecthardcore.com/reviews/archive-reviews-feb-2012-to-sep-2012/|archive-date=29 November 2017}}</ref>

The United States tour to support the album was cancelled halfway. They were joined by Washington, D.C.'s [[Frodus]] and only completed eight shows in half-empty basements and coffeehouses, finishing in a chaotic performance in a basement of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]] that, after four songs, was shut down by [[police]].<ref name=burningheart2>{{cite web|title=Refused Are Fucking Dead|url=http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refmanifest5.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117175926/http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refmanifest5.htm|archive-date=17 January 2012|publisher=[[Burning Heart Records]]|access-date=27 June 2015}}</ref> They described these concerts as "emotionally devastating" and "an awful experience", which finally led to their break-up after a rough internal fight in Atlanta, Georgia.<ref name="Refused are fucking dead" /><ref>{{cite web|access-date=1 December 2017|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-with-refuseds-dennis-lyxzen-reunion-success-was-a-bit-trippy-20130506|title=Q&A; With Refused's Dennis Lyxzen: Reunion Success Was 'A Bit Trippy'|first= Steve |last=Appleford|publication-date=6 May 2013|website=[[RollingStone]]|date=6 May 2013|location=Münster, Germany|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507035548/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-with-refuseds-dennis-lyxzen-reunion-success-was-a-bit-trippy-20130506|archive-date=7 May 2013}}</ref> Other factors to their disbandment were a depletion of creative energy and band members wanting different things. There was also conflict between Dennis and the rest of the band.<ref name="buddyhead"/>

Refused announced their demise through a strongly-worded open letter titled "Refused Are Fucking Dead" on their label [[Burning Heart Records|Burning Heart]]'s website.<ref name=burningheart2/>

===After breakup (1999–2009)===
The story of Refused's last show soon became popular, as well as ''The Shape of Punk to Come''. A year after its release, the album shot up from 1,400 to 21,000 units sold in the United States. In 2000, it went up to 28,000.<ref name=popsongs/> From then on, many notable artists started to praise the band and newcomers cited them as an influence.

Lead singer [[Dennis Lyxzén]] went on to form [[The (International) Noise Conspiracy]] soon thereafter, while the other members, as well as venturing into their own projects, formed the group [[TEXT]].

In 2007 Lyxzén and Sandström briefly reformed their Refused side project, [[Final Exit (band)|Final Exit]], which existed in the mid-late 1990s and originally consisted of members of Refused and [[Abhinanda]], with each member taking a different role to that which they had in their main bands (e.g., David on vocals and Dennis on bass guitar).

As of May 2008, Dennis Lyxzén and David Sandström formed a new straightforward hardcore band under the name [[AC4]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mokas |first1=Apostolis |title=AC4: Umeå Hardcore Punk |url=https://diyconspiracy.net/interview-with-ac4-2010/ |website=DIY Conspiracy |date=5 February 2014 |publisher=Keep It Real Fanzine |access-date=17 June 2021}}</ref>

Kristofer Steen moved to [[Orange County, California]] and attended film school there.<ref name="buddyhead"/> He made a documentary on the band's last year in existence called ''[[Refused Are Fucking Dead]]'', which was released in 2006. Then, he began working on operas in Sweden.<ref name="popsongs"/>

===Rumours (2010–2011)===
In March 2010, Epitaph Records put up the old Refused website online with the words "Coming Soon."<ref>{{cite web| title = Refused 'set to reform'| work = [[NME]]| date = 27 March 2010| url = http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/50408| access-date = 27 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Karan| first = Tim| title = Refused Hint a Reformation, Album with Epitaph| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = 27 March 2010| url = http://altpress.com/news/8643.htm| access-date = 27 March 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100331000232/http://altpress.com/news/8643.htm| archive-date = 31 March 2010| url-status = dead}}</ref> Rumours spread across the Internet about what the new website could indicate, including speculation of a reunion.<ref name="exclaim">{{cite web| last = Pratt| first = Greg| title = Epitaph Confirms Deluxe Reissue of Refused's ''The Shape of Punk to Come'' As Reunion Rumours Run Wild on the Internet| work = [[Exclaim!]]| date = 29 March 2010| url = http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=115&csid2=844&fid1=45419| archive-url = https://archive.today/20130115075823/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=115&csid2=844&fid1=45419| url-status = dead| archive-date = 15 January 2013| access-date = 29 March 2010}}</ref> Citing an anonymous source "close to the situation," ''Punknews.org'' unofficially announced that the band would perform at European music festivals in 2010.<ref>{{cite web| last = Yancey| first = Bryne| title = UPDATED: Refused updates website, reunion in the works| work = Punknews.org| date = 27 March 2010| url = http://www.punknews.org/article/37669| access-date = 27 March 2010}}</ref>  Dennis Lyxzén denied claims of a Refused reformation as he and David Sandström were busy with [[AC4]].<ref name="exclaim"/><ref>{{cite web| last = Magnusson| first = Daniel| title = REFUSED PÅ VÄG ATT ÅTERFÖRENAS| work = [[Gaffa (magazine)|Gaffa]]| language = sv| date = 29 March 2010| url = http://gaffa.se/nyhet/38196| access-date = 29 March 2010}}</ref> The new band website was later announced to be a promotional site for a reissue of Refused's final album, ''[[The Shape of Punk to Come]]''.<ref name="exclaim"/> The reissue, released on 8 June 2010, is a three-disc set with an unreleased live album recorded in 1998 and the ''[[Refused Are Fucking Dead]]'' DVD documentary in addition to the full original album.<ref>{{cite web| last = Paul| first = Aubin| title = Refused to issue deluxe 3 CD ''Shape of Punk to Come''| work = Punknews.org| date = 7 April 2010| url = http://www.punknews.org/article/37803| access-date = 7 April 2010}}</ref>

In November 2011, multiple posters said to be for the upcoming 2012 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]] appeared on several Internet sites, and the line-ups included Refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swnk.org/wp-content/uploads/coachella-2012-lineup-poster-leaked.jpg|format=JPG|title=Leaked Coachella 2012 Poster|website=Swnk.org|access-date=26 June 2015}}</ref> This started new rumours of a long-awaited reunion.

===Reunion (2012)===
[[File:Refused June 2012.jpg|thumb|170px|Dennis Lyxzén with Refused in 2012]]
{{further|Refused Reunion Tour}}
During [[BBC Radio 1]]'s "Punk Show" on 2 January 2012, [[Mike Davies (broadcaster)|Mike Davies]] stated that Refused, along with [[At the Drive-In]] would be reforming in 2012. On 9 January 2012, it was announced that Refused would be performing for the 2012 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]]. The reunion was confirmed via Dennis Lyxzén's Facebook page. This was highly contested considering the band's original and explicit declaration to never reunite.{{r|burningheart2}}<ref name="p carter reformation">{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/blog/read/my-thoughts-on-the-refused-reformation-daniel-p-carter?|work=[[Rock Sound]]|title=My thoughts on the Refused reformation|author=Daniel P.

They also headlined the [[Groezrock]] festival in Belgium. The confirmation that Refused would be UK exclusives at [[Sonisphere Festival]] in the UK was made on 20 February. However, in light of Sonisphere UK's subsequent cancellation, Refused were officially booked by [[Download Festival]] on 3 April, to perform at Donington Park instead. On 29 February, Refused played a secret show in Umeå, their first live performance since 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/03/video-refused-perform-first-show-in-14-years/ |title=Video: Refused perform first show in 14 years « Consequence of Sound |website=Consequenceofsound.net |date=1 March 2012}}</ref> Refused are also confirmed for the [[Rock for People]] festival in [[Czech Republic]].

On 23 August 2012 Refused indicated by a Facebook post that their reunion was for 2012 only and not a continuation of their career. On 24 August 2012, it was announced that Refused would undertake a theatre tour of Australia for the first time ever that November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundwavetouring.com/news/refused-announce-australian-tour/|title=REFUSED ANNOUNCE AUSTRALIAN TOUR!! << Soundwave Touring|publisher=Soundwave Touring|date=24 August 2012|access-date=1 November 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218184126/http://www.soundwavetouring.com/news/refused-announce-australian-tour/|archive-date=18 December 2014}}</ref> The after party for Refused's show on 15 December 2012 in Fabriken, Umeå saw brief reunions from related Umeå hardcore bands [[Abhinanda]] and [[Final Exit (band)|Final Exit]], as well as some rarely performed songs from Refused. [[Redd Kross]] also performed on the evening.
