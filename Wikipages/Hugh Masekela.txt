'''Hugh Ramapolo Masekela''' (4 April 1939 – 23 January 2018)<ref name="BBC 23 Jan 2019">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42786749|title=Hugh Masekela, South African jazz trumpeter, dies|date=23 January 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=23 January 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> was a South African trumpeter, [[flugelhorn]]ist, [[cornet]]ist, singer and composer who was described as "the father of [[South African jazz]]". Masekela was known for his jazz compositions and for writing well-known [[Music in the movement against apartheid|anti-apartheid songs]] such as "[[Soweto Blues]]" and "[[Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)|Bring Him Back Home]]". He also had a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1968|number-one US pop hit in 1968]] with his version of "[[Grazing in the Grass]]".

==Early life==
Hugh Ramapolo Masekela was born in the township of [[KwaGuqa]] in [[Witbank]] (now called Emalahleni), South Africa, to Thomas Selena Masekela, who was a health inspector and sculptor and his wife, Pauline Bowers Masekela, a social worker.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/obituaries/hugh-masekela-dies.html|title=Hugh Masekela, Trumpeter and Anti-Apartheid Activist, Dies at 78|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 January 2018|author=Russonello, Giovanni}}</ref> His younger sister [[Barbara Masekela]] is a poet, educator and [[ANC]] activist. As a child, he began singing and playing piano and was largely raised by his grandmother, who ran an illegal bar for miners.<ref name="NYT"/> At the age of 14, after seeing the 1950 film ''[[Young Man with a Horn (film)|Young Man with a Horn]]'' (in which [[Kirk Douglas]] plays a character modelled on American jazz cornetist [[Bix Beiderbecke]]), Masekela took up playing the trumpet. His first trumpet was bought for him from a local music store by Archbishop [[Trevor Huddleston]],<ref name=bbc-did>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00938bc|title=Desert Islands Discs: Hugh Masekela|first=Sue|last=Lawley|date=16 July 2004|access-date=7 July 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> the [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid]] chaplain at St. Peter's Secondary School now known as [[St. Martin's School (Rosettenville)]].<ref>Fairweather, Digby, ''The Rough Guide to Jazz'', St. Martin's Press (2004), p. 13 – {{ISBN|0-312-27870-5}}.</ref><ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-42787109|title=Hugh Masekela: South Africa's 'Father of Jazz'|first=Flora|last=Drury|date=23 January 2018|access-date=23 January 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Huddleston asked the leader of the then [[Johannesburg]] "Native" Municipal Brass Band, Uncle Sauda, to teach Masekela the rudiments of trumpet playing.<ref name=enca>{{cite web|url=https://www.enca.com/life/entertainment/rip-hugh-masekelas-train-comes-to-a-halt|title='Father of South African jazz' Hugh Masekela dies|website=Enca.com|date=23 January 2018|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref> Masekela quickly mastered the instrument. Soon, some of his schoolmates also became interested in playing instruments, leading to the formation of the Huddleston Jazz Band, South Africa's first youth orchestra.<ref name=enca/> When [[Louis Armstrong]] heard of this band from his friend Huddleston he sent one of his own trumpets as a gift for Hugh.<ref name=bbc-did/> By 1956, after leading other ensembles, Masekela joined [[Alfred Herbert]]'s African Jazz Revue.<ref name="Mojapelo2008">{{cite book|last=Mojapelo|first=Max |title=Beyond Memory: Recording the History, Moments and Memories of South African Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-KW9f02oNMC&pg=PA268|year=2008|publisher=African Minds|isbn=978-1-920299-28-6|pages=268–}}</ref>

From 1954, Masekela played music that closely reflected his life experience. The agony, conflict, and exploitation faced by South Africa during the 1950s and 1960s inspired and influenced him to make music and also spread political change.  He was an artist who in his music vividly portrayed the struggles and sorrows, as well as the joys and passions of his country. His music protested about [[apartheid]], [[slavery]], government; the hardships individuals were living. Masekela reached a large population that also felt oppressed due to the country's situation.<ref name="Stanley Niaah2007">{{cite book|last=Stanley Niaah|first=Sonjah|editor-first1=Katherine |editor-last1=McKittrick |editor-first2=Clyde Adrian |editor-last2=Woods|title=Black Geographies and the Politics of Place|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLJ2AAAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=South End Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-773-6|pages=193–217|chapter=Mapping of Black Atlantic Performance Geographies: From Slave Ship to Ghetto}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ritmoartists.com/Hugh/Masekela.htm |title=Hugh Masekela |access-date=29 February 2008 |archive-date=14 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214080650/http://www.ritmoartists.com/Hugh/Masekela.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Following a [[Manhattan Brothers]] tour of [[South Africa]] in 1958, Masekela wound up in the orchestra of the musical ''[[King Kong (1959 musical)|King Kong]]'', written by [[Todd Matshikiza]].<ref name=sahistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/hugh-masekela|title=Hugh Masekela|date=17 February 2011|website=Sahistory.org.za|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref> ''King Kong'' was South Africa's first blockbuster theatrical success, touring the country for a sold-out year with [[Miriam Makeba]] and the Manhattan Brothers' Nathan Mdledle in the lead.

At the end of 1959, [[Dollar Brand]] (later known as [[Abdullah Ibrahim]]), [[Kippie Moeketsi]], [[Makhaya Ntshoko]], [[Jonas Gwangwa]], Johnny Gertze and Hugh formed the [[Jazz Epistles]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-complete-recordings-feat-hugh-masekela-dollar-brand/872610789|title=The Complete Recordings (feat.

Following the 21 March 1960 [[Sharpeville massacre]]—where 69 protestors were shot dead in [[Sharpeville]], and the South African government banned gatherings of ten or more people—and the increased brutality of the Apartheid state, Masekela left the country. He was helped by [[Trevor Huddleston]] and international friends such as [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[John Dankworth]], who got him admitted into London's [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama|Guildhall School of Music]] in 1960.<ref name=times>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hugh-masekela-obituary-qnhgmqt33|title=Hugh Masekela|date=23 January 2018|access-date=23 January 2018|website=Thetimes.co.uk}}</ref> During that period, Masekela visited the United States, where he was befriended by [[Harry Belafonte]].<ref name=indy>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/hugh-masekela-dead-death-music-jazz-latest-news-life-career-apartheid-south-africa-a8173406.html|title=South African jazz legend and apartheid activist Hugh Masekela dies|first=Maya|last= Oppenheim|date=23 January 2018|website=Independent.co.uk|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref> After securing a scholarship back in London,<ref name="NYT"/> Masekela moved to the United States to attend the [[Manhattan School of Music]] in New York, where he studied classical trumpet from 1960 to 1964.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/23/hugh-masekela-obituary|title=Hugh Masekela obituary: South African jazz pioneer who fought the evil of apartheid|first=Robin|last=Denselow|date=23 January 2018|website=the Guardian|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref> In 1964, [[Miriam Makeba]] and Masekela were married, divorcing two years later.<ref name=guardian/>

He had hits in the US with the pop jazz tunes "[[Up, Up and Away (song)|Up, Up and Away]]" (1967) and the number-one smash "[[Grazing in the Grass]]" (1968), which sold four million copies.<ref>[[Scott Yanow|Yanow]], Scott. ''Trumpet Kings: The Players Who Shaped the Sound of Jazz Trumpet'', Backbeat Books (2001), p. 248. {{ISBN|0-87930-608-4}}</ref> He also appeared at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967, and was subsequently featured in the film ''[[Monterey Pop]]'' by [[D. A. Pennebaker]]. In 1974, Masekela and friend [[Stewart Levine]] organised the [[Zaire 74]] music festival in [[Kinshasa]] set around [[the Rumble in the Jungle]] boxing match.<ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/06/14/532636128/before-the-rumble-in-the-jungle-music-rang-out-at-zaire-74|title=Before The Rumble In The Jungle, Music Rang Out At Zaire 74|first=Sam|last=Gringlas|author2=Ari Shapiro|website=Npr.org|date=14 June 2017|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref>

He played primarily in jazz ensembles, with guest appearances on recordings by [[the Byrds]] ("[[So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star]]" and "[[Lady Friend (song)|Lady Friend]]") and [[Paul Simon]] ("Further to Fly"). In 1984, Masekela released the album ''Techno Bush''; from that album, a single entitled "Don't Go Lose It Baby" peaked at number two for two weeks on the dance charts.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974–2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=168}}</ref> In 1987, he had a hit single with "[[Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)|Bring Him Back Home]]". The song became enormously popular, and turned into an unofficial anthem of the [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid movement]] and an anthem for the movement to free [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref name="Slate 2013">{{cite web|last1=Haglund|first1=David|title=It Is Music and Dancing That Makes Me at Peace With the World|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/12/05/nelson_mandela_songs_free_mandela_tributes_from_the_specials_johnny_clegg.html|website=Slate.com|date=5 December 2013|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Greenwald 2015">{{cite web|last1=Greenwald|first1=Matthew|title=Hugh Masekela Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/bring-him-back-home-nelson-mandela-mt0010490700|website=AllMusic|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref>

A renewed interest in his African roots led Masekela to collaborate with [[Music of West Africa|West]] and Central African musicians, and finally to reconnect with Southern African players when he set up with the help of Jive Records a mobile studio in [[Botswana]], just over the South African border, from 1980 to 1984. Here he re-absorbed and re-used [[mbaqanga]] strains, a style he continued to use following his return to South Africa in the early 1990s.<ref name=washington>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/hugh-masekela-south-african-trumpeter-and-a-leading-voice-in-the-anti-apartheid-movement-dies-at-78/2018/01/23/3181306a-0032-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html|title=Hugh Masekela, South African trumpeter and a leading voice in the anti-apartheid movement, dies at 78|first=Harrison|last=Smith|date=23 January 2018|access-date=23 January 2018|website=W.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

Also in the 1980s, Masekela toured with [[Paul Simon]] in support of Simon's album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'', which featured other South African artists such as [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], Miriam Makeba, [[Ray Phiri]], and other elements of the band [[Kalahari (band)|Kalahari]], which was co-founded by guitarist [[Banjo Mosele]] and which backed Masekela in the 1980s.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

In 2003, he was featured in the documentary film ''[[Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony]]''.  In 2004, he released his autobiography, ''[[Still Grazing]]: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela'', co-authored with journalist D. Michael Cheers,<ref>Masekela, Hugh. ''Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela'', Crown Publishers (2004), {{ISBN|0-609-60957-2}}.</ref> which detailed Masekela's struggles against apartheid in his homeland, as well as his personal struggles with alcoholism from the late 1970s to the 1990s. In this period, he migrated, in his personal recording career, to [[mbaqanga]], jazz/[[funk]], and the blending of South African sounds, through two albums he recorded with [[Herb Alpert]], and solo recordings, ''[[Techno-Bush]]'' (recorded in his studio in Botswana), ''[[Tomorrow (Hugh Masekela album)|Tomorrow]]'' (featuring the anthem "Bring Him Back Home"), ''Uptownship'' (a lush-sounding ode to American R&B), ''Beatin' Aroun de Bush'', ''Sixty'', ''Time'', and ''Revival''. His song "[[Soweto Blues]]", sung by his former wife, Miriam Makeba, is a [[blues]]/jazz piece that mourns the carnage of the [[Soweto riots]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/miriam-makeba-singer-banned-from-her-native-south-africa-for-fighting-apartheid-1009604.html|title=Miriam Makeba: Singer banned from her native South Africa for fighting|date=11 November 2008|first=Jon|last=Lusk|website=Independent.co.uk|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref> He also provided interpretations of songs composed by [[Jorge Ben]], [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], [[Caiphus Semenya]], [[Jonas Gwangwa]], [[Dorothy Masuka]], and [[Fela Kuti]].

In 2009, Masekela released the album ''Phola'' (meaning "to get well, to heal"), his second recording for 4 Quarters Entertainment/[[Times Square Records]]. It includes some songs he wrote in the 1980s but never completed, as well as a reinterpretation of "The Joke of Life (Brinca de Vivre)", which he recorded in the mid-1980s. From October 2007, he was a board member of the Woyome Foundation for Africa.<ref>[http://www.wofound.org/board.htm Board members], Woyome Foundation for Africa.</ref><ref>[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/trumpet-player-and-so-much-more-hugh-masekela "Trumpet player and so much more, Hugh Masekela"], African American Registry.</ref>

In 2010, Masekela was featured, with his son [[Selema Masekela]], in a series of videos on [[ESPN]]. The series, called ''Umlando – Through My Father's Eyes'', was aired in 10 parts during ESPN's coverage of the [[FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa. The series focused on Hugh's and Selema's travels through South Africa. Hugh brought his son to the places he grew up.
