'''Ojay Morgan''' (born 1987), better known as '''Zebra Katz''', is a [[Berlin]]-based Jamaican-American<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/zebra-katz-moor-mother-less-is-moor-ojay-morgan|title=Zebra Katz Claims The Anti-Throne|website=Interview|date=20 March 2020}}</ref> rapper, producer and songwriter who has collaborated with artists including [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Gorillaz]]. His career took off in 2012 when fashion designer [[Rick Owens]] featured Zebra Katz's song "Ima Read" on loop at [[Paris Fashion Week]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://us.carhartt-wip.com/blogs/journal/into-the-wild|title=Into the Wild|website=us.carhartt-wip.com}}</ref> Morgan self-identifies as [[queer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/25/zebra-katz-interview-ima-read#:~:text=%22She's%20been%20an%20influence%20on,term%20he%20feels%20ambivalent%20about.|title = Zebra Katz: 'Creating a strong, black, queer male is something that needed to happen'|date = 25 May 2013}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
Throughout his career, Morgan has openly spoken out against the "queer rap" genre coined by [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] and other publications used to classify Zebra Katz, and artists like [[Mykki Blanco]] and [[Le1f]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/712-queer-rap-is-not-queer-rap/|title=Queer Rap is Not Queer Rap|website=Pitchfork|date=31 March 2015}}</ref> While stating that if it weren't for his sexuality, he'd be generally classified as a "rapper", Morgan claims the inherently homophobic genre pigeonholes musicians. In this sense, his music has been classified as genre-defying.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kaltblut-magazine.com/zebra-katz-shares-powerful-new-video-for-ish/|title=Zebra Katz shares powerful new video for 'ISH'|website=www.kaltblut-magazine.com|date=6 February 2020}}</ref>

== Ima Read ==
Despite not having a strong personal relationship with voguing, Morgan says the movement was pushed onto him as a means for creating context for "Ima Read". The connection between voguing and the track was fuelled by the 20th anniversary of the ballroom scene documentary film ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris is Burning]]'' and popularization of voguing in 2012. That said, Morgan loves ballroom culture/voguing. He performed at the 2012 [[GMHC]] House of Latex Ball,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poz.com/article/gmhc-house-latex-ball-22233-3172|title=GMHC's Annual House of Latex Ball|website=www.poz.com|date=28 August 2012}}</ref> supports House of Vogue founder, DJ [[MikeQ]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/music/zebra-katz-doesnt-give-a-fuck-about-your-hot-takes|title=ZEBRA KATZ DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOUR HOT TAKES|website=ssense.com|date=21 April 2017}}</ref> and is a forming member of the [[House of Ladosha]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/new-yorker-festival/spotlight-on-brooklyn-playlist|title=Spotlight on Brooklyn Playlist|magazine=The New Yorker|date=13 October 2009}}</ref>

== ''Less Is Moor'' ==
Inspired by [[James Baldwin]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Nina Simone]], and [[Little Richard]], Zebra Katz's 2020 debut album, ''Less Is Moor'' – pays homage to the minimalistic approach often demanded from artists of color. Morgan clarifies this by saying that non-white people are commonly expected to be more resourceful than their white counterparts.<ref name=":0">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/9339252/zebra-katz-new-album-less-is-moor-interview|title=Why Zebra Katz Waited Seven Years Before Dropping His New Album 'Less is Moor'|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> With elements of hip-hop, drum 'n' bass, and electronic music, ''Less Is Moor'' is said to channel Katz's caustic lyricism into its biting rhythms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thevinylfactory.com/news/zebra-katz-debut-album-less-is-moor-vinyl/|title=Zebra Katz meshes industrial hip-hop and trap on debut album, LESS IS MOOR|website=thevinylfactory.com|date=23 January 2020}}</ref>

The basis for the ''Less Is Moor'' album started while Morgan was studying at the [[New School]]'s [[Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts]]. His senior thesis project, "Moor Contradictions", was a performance featuring monologues and raps, including "Ima Read", from different personas created by Morgan. Among these characters is Zebra Katz, who Morgan says, was formed as a result of his thesis on identity obsession.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.it/en/vogue-black/the-black-blog/2012/04/zebra-katz|title=Zebra Katz|website=Vogue}}</ref> Since then, Morgan has been fighting against the various boxes and typecasts created by those around him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/12903-zebra-katz-interview|title=Dazzle-Camo: An Interview With Zebra Katz|website=thequietus.com}}</ref>

The title of the album is inspired by the Moor people.<ref name=":0" />
