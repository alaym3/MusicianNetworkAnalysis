'''HIM''' (sometimes stylized as '''H.I.M.''') was a Finnish [[gothic rock]] band from [[Helsinki]]. First formed in 1991 by vocalist [[Ville Valo]] and bassist [[Mige (musician)|Mikko "Mige" Paananen]] under the name '''His Infernal Majesty''', the band broke up after only a few years, only to be reformed in 1995 by Valo and guitarist [[Linde Lindström|Mikko "Linde" Lindström]]. After being rejoined by Mige, as well as keyboardist Antto Melasniemi and drummer Juhana "Pätkä" Rantala, the band, now called HIM, released its debut album ''[[Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666]]'' in 1997. In 2000, now with drummer [[Gas Lipstick|Mika "Gas Lipstick" Karppinen]] and keyboardist Juska Salminen, the band released ''[[Razorblade Romance]]'', which reached the number one spot in Finland, Austria and Germany. The first single "[[Join Me in Death]]" also charted at number one in Finland and Germany, eventually going [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] and [[Music recording sales certification|gold]], respectively. Following the addition of [[Burton (musician)|Janne "Burton" Puurtinen]] on keyboards, HIM released ''[[Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights]]'' (2001) and ''[[Love Metal]]'' (2003). Both cracked the top ten in several countries and allowed the band to tour in the United Kingdom and the United States for the first time.

In 2005, HIM released ''[[Dark Light (HIM album)|Dark Light]]'', which became the group's most commercially successful album to date. HIM also became the first Finnish group in history to receive a gold record in the US. In 2007, HIM released ''[[Venus Doom]]'', the making of which was marred by problems in Valo's personal life. Nevertheless, the album gave the band its highest chart position in the US at number twelve. After 2010's ''[[Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice]]'', HIM went on a hiatus after Gas Lipstick was forced to take medical leave. Following several months of uncertainty, the band regrouped and released the album ''[[Tears on Tape]]'' in 2013. Gas Lipstick announced his departure from the band in 2015 and was subsequently replaced by Jukka "Kosmo" Kröger. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced that the band would be disbanding following a [[Bang and Whimper 2017 – The Farewell Tour|farewell tour]] in 2017. The band played its final show on New Year's Eve 2017 as a part of its annual [[Helldone|Helldone Festival]].

HIM is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists in Finland|most commercially successful Finnish bands of all time]], with sales of over ten million records. HIM has also received numerous accolades, including eight [[Emma-gaala|Emma Awards]]. The band is known for its distinct sound, which combines more melodic and melancholic elements with heavier influences. This made it difficult for audiences to categorize HIM's music, which led to the band coining the term "love metal". HIM is also known for its logo, the heartagram, which has made numerous appearances in other media.

The first incarnation of HIM was formed in 1991 by childhood friends [[Ville Valo]] and [[Mige (musician)|Mikko "Mige" Paananen]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. Valo played six-string bass, which substituted for guitar, while Mige also played bass. The band had two rotating drummers: Sami "Juippi" Jokilehto and Juha Tarvonen.{{sfn|Juntunen|2002|p=23}}<ref name="LoudLegacy">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaSOTXJSLYw | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211110/PaSOTXJSLYw| archive-date=2021-11-10 | url-status=live|title= HIM's Ville Valo - Loud Legacy (Full Documentary) |work=[[Loudwire]] |via=[[YouTube]] |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=9 June 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview |last1=Valo |first1=Ville |subject-link1=Ville Valo |interviewer=Laura Vähähyyppä |title=Lauantain kuokkavieras: Ville Valo |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlVw5lIc2pQ | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211110/QlVw5lIc2pQ| archive-date=2021-11-10 | url-status=live|work=[[Radio Rock]] |date=21 May 2016 |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=9 June 2016 |language=Finnish}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Dubbed His Infernal Majesty, other names considered for the band included Black Earth, Black Salem and Kafferi.{{sfn|Juntunen|2002|pp=23{{ndash}}25}} After recording its first demo ''Witches and Other Night Fears'',<ref name="Wiki">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b8hOK890b8 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211110/6b8hOK890b8| archive-date=2021-11-10 | url-status=live|title=HIM's Ville Valo and Mikko Paananen - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? |work=[[Loudwire]] |via=[[YouTube]] |date=24 April 2014 |access-date=9 June 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> His Infernal Majesty played its first show on [[New Year's Eve]] 1992 at the [[Tavastia Club|Semifinal]] in Helsinki.

Following a two month break in early 2002, HIM regrouped and began rehearsing for its next album, which saw the band working with Hiili Hiilesmaa again.{{sfn|Juntunen|2002|p=249}} The band viewed the record as a reaction to the difficulties they faced during ''Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights''. According to Valo: "After what we considered a disappointment with ''Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights'', because there were so many chefs in the kitchen, we wanted to be a band [...] that we control what we do, and everybody else can fuck off." This new determination was underlined by the decision to include the band's logo, the heartagram, prominently on the front cover.

In the band's early days, HIM's image was heavily characterized by occult and satanic imagery. The use of the number "666" was prominent in lyrics, as well as song and album titles. The band's original name "His Infernal Majesty" was also inspired by ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'' by [[Anton LaVey]], the song "Oblivious to Evil" by [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], and [[Haile Selassie]], who was known as "his imperial majesty".<ref name="Wiki"/>{{sfn|Juntunen|2002|p=24}} This flirtation with the occult was seen by the band as purely "symbolic" and "traditionally rock 'n' roll".<ref name="LoudLegacy"/>{{sfn|Juntunen|2002|p=29}} Ville Valo first became interested in the occult while in school and soon began reading books on the subject. All of the band were also big fans of [[black metal]]. However, the group have maintained that none of them were seriously interested in satanism. Instead their interest was about mere "fascination", as well as a tongue in cheek hats off to their favorite bands.<ref name="Q&A"/>{{sfn|Juntunen|2002|p=25}} His Infernal Majesty eventually shortened its name to HIM in 1996, reportedly because Finnish people had difficulty remembering and pronouncing "His Infernal Majesty".{{sfn|Juntunen|2002|p=26}} In the years since, HIM toned down the use of satanic imagery even further. When asked about the band's image in 2013, Valo responded: "I think we're pretty much the same [offstage].

On the band's first three albums, vocalist Ville Valo was featured solely on the cover.<ref name="Q&A"/> According to Valo, ''Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666'' was meant as combination of [[Goth subculture|goth]] and [[eroticism]], while ''Razorblade Romance'' was influenced by the 1980s, [[glam rock]] and [[pop music]]. ''Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights'', meanwhile, took inspiration from [[Lou Reed]], [[Patti Smith]] and late 1970s New York City art circles.{{sfn|Juntunen|2002|p=73}} ''Love Metal'' was the first album to prominently feature the heartagram on its cover, which was repeated on the follow-up ''Dark Light''.<ref name="LoudLegacy"/><ref name="SUBTV"/> For ''Venus Doom''{{'}}s cover, the band used a painting by David Harouni, which Valo had purchased while on tour in [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite interview |last1=Valo |first1=Ville |subject-link1=Ville Valo |title=An interview with Ville Valo |interviewer=Jussi Mäntysaari |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obvkktL14k4 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211110/obvkktL14k4| archive-date=2021-11-10 | url-status=live|work=[[The Voice TV]] |via=[[YouTube]] |year=2007 |access-date=1 September 2021 |language=Finnish}}{{cbignore}}</ref> ''Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice'' featured a photo of a late 19th century nun sculpture that Valo had purchased in [[Bavaria]].<ref>{{cite interview |last1=Valo |first1=Ville |subject-link1=Ville Valo |title=An interview with Ville Valo |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WLowd1eI04 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211110/6WLowd1eI04| archive-date=2021-11-10 | url-status=live|work=Bravo Web TV |via=[[YouTube]] |date=2 February 2010 |access-date=22 December 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> On ''Tears on Tape'', HIM used several paintings by [[Daniel P.

HIM is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists in Finland|most commercially successful Finnish bands of all time]], with sales of over ten million albums worldwide.<ref name="HSArkisto"/><ref>{{Cite news |title=Yllätysilmoitus: HIM lopettaa! |date=5 March 2017 |last=Pudas |first=Mari |newspaper=[[Iltalehti]] |url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/viihde/201703052200080915_vi.shtml |access-date=18 June 2017 |language=Finnish}}</ref> They are also the first Finnish group in history to receive a gold record in the United States.<ref name="HSAnalyysi"/><ref name="HSArkisto"/> As one of the first Finnish bands to achieve major international success, HIM has been credited for paving the way for other Finnish groups, such as [[Children of Bodom]] and [[Sonata Arctica]]. HIM's manager Seppo Vesterinen recalled how before HIM "the success of Finnish bands [..] was confined to pretty small circles, it wasn't a global phenomenon".<ref name="Savo">{{cite news |title="Ei ole tehdasta, jossa napista painamalla syntyisi uusia HIMejä" |url =http://www.savonsanomat.fi/kulttuuri/Ei-ole-tehdasta-jossa-napista-painamalla-syntyisi-uusia-HIMej%C3%A4/943242 |last=Lankolainen |first=Eeva |newspaper=[[Savon Sanomat]] |date=7 March 2017 |access-date=15 April 2017 |language=Finnish}}</ref> In 2015, HIM were one of six Finnish bands honored by the [[Posti Group|Finnish postal service]] by being featured on a new line of postage stamps designed by Klaus Welp.<ref name="Stamps">{{Cite news |title=Children of Bodom, Nightwish, HIM, Apocalyptica + More Honored With Finnish Postage Stamps |date=16 April 2015 |last=Hartmann |first=Graham |website=[[Loudwire]] |url=https://loudwire.com/children-of-bodom-nightwish-him-apocalyptica-finnish-postage-stamps/ |access-date=27 December 2016}}</ref> Publications such as ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' and ''[[Loudwire]]'' have ranked HIM among the best Finnish metal bands of all time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=10 of the best metal bands from Finland |last=Patterson |first=Dayal |author-link=Dayal Patterson |work=[[Metal Hammer]] |via=Louder |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/10-of-the-best-metal-bands-from-finland |date=17 May 2016 |access-date=1 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=10 Best Finnish Metal Bands |last=DiVita |first=Joe |website=[[Loudwire]] |url=http://loudwire.com/best-finnish-metal-bands/#photogallery-1=4 |date=5 September 2017 |access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref>

Much of HIM's success has been attributed to Ville Valo.<ref name="HSAnalyysi"/> Along with his songwriting,<ref name="Savo"/> a key component in HIM's success was Valo's image, which ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' described as utilizing "the tried and true [[James Dean]] formula, wherein sensitivity and edginess combined."<ref name="HSAnalyysi"/> ''Metal Hammer'' described Valo as one of the few new "rockstars" of the early 2000s, stating: "HIM were like no other band. They had a special something, but more importantly they had a special someone. Ville shone like a star with his blend of [[Mick Jagger]] posturing and [[Brandon Lee]]'s dark charms in ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hibbard |first=Jamie |date=December 2017 |title=Sympathy for the Devil |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]: A Brief History of HIM |pages=8{{ndash}}9 |publisher=Future plc |location=London, England }}</ref> ''Loudwire'' ranked Valo as the fourteenth greatest metal frontman of the 21st century, stating: "His baritone voice is undeniably gorgeous, his vampiric charisma is almost hypnotic, male fans desperately attempt to emulate him and female fans scream ballistically as if he was the second coming of [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Top 30 Frontmen + Frontwomen of the 21st Century |date=28 February 2018 |last=DiVita |first=Joe |website=[[Loudwire]] |url=https://loudwire.com/top-frontmen-frontwomen-21st-century/ |access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref> Unlike other rock and metal bands, HIM also had a wide appeal,<ref name="HimmeetäValoa"/> with BMG's Asko Kallonen recalling: "For example in England it was hard to grasp. There the split was usually clear: hard rock was for guys, pop was for girls. HIM was listened to by both."<ref>{{cite news |title="Mietin, mistä maailmasta tämä tulee?"

The heartagram has also been a key factor in HIM's success, with Valo noting how the symbol has transcended the band, stating: "There are a lot of people who have them [tattooed] who don't actually know what it was, don't relate it to the band, and in that sense, I consider that to be my greatest achievement."<ref name="SheerHeart"/> Valo has also credited Bam Margera and [[Kat Von D]] for helping the band gain exposure through their work.<ref name="Wiki"/><ref name="SheerHeart"/><ref name="Loudwire"/> HIM's music and the heartagram have been prominently featured in Margera's films and TV shows, as well as Von D's ''[[LA Ink]]''.<ref name="Loudwire"/> Margera was first introduced to HIM in May 2000, when he flew to Finland for a skateboarding competition and saw the band's music video on TV. He subsequently went out to a record store and bought the album ''Razorblade Romance''.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Margera, Bam (director) |year=2005 |title=HIM vs BAM - Making of "Buried Alive by Love" |medium=Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRx0rIVxyh4 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211110/NRx0rIVxyh4| archive-date=2021-11-10 | url-status=live|via=YouTube |access-date=1 September 2021 |work=[[Sony BMG]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Regarding Margera's involvement in HIM's success, Valo stated: "It wasn't about secret handshakes between managers, he was just a random fella who came a-knocking on our door [...] and that's how the friendship started."<ref name="Loudwire"/> Kat Von D, meanwhile, was introduced to HIM when the band was recording ''Dark Light'' in Los Angeles. She later appeared in the music video for "Killing Loneliness" and has gone on to do several tattoos for members of the band.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/ville-valo-rakastumassa/2878742 |title =Ville Valo rakastumassa? |website=MTV Uutiset |language=Finnish |date=18 March 2010 |access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref>
