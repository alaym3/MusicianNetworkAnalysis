'''Robert Matthew Van Winkle''' (born October 31, 1967), known professionally as '''Vanilla Ice''', is an American rapper, actor, and television host. Born in [[South Dallas]], and raised in Texas and [[South Florida]], Ice released his debut album, ''Hooked'', in 1989 on [[Ichiban Records]], before signing a contract with [[SBK Records]], a [[record label]] of the [[EMI Group]], which released a reformatted version of the album in 1990 under the title ''[[To the Extreme]]'' which became the fastest-selling hip hop album of all time<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forman|first1=Murray|title=The 'hood Comes First: Race, Space, and Place in Rap and Hip-hop|year=2002|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=0-8195-6397-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/hoodcomesfirstra00form/page/61 61]|chapter='Welcome to the City'|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/hoodcomesfirstra00form/page/61}}</ref> and contained Ice's best-known hits: "[[Ice Ice Baby]]" and a cover of "[[Play That Funky Music]]". "Ice Ice Baby" was the first hip hop single to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|charts]] and has been credited with helping to diversify hip hop by introducing it to a mainstream audience.

Although he was successful, Ice later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, which had paid him to adopt a more commercial appearance to appeal to a mass audience and published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. Soundtrack appearances and a live album, ''[[Extremely Live]]'', continued the success, but a second mainstream studio album, ''[[Mind Blowin']]'', featured an image change which saw a massive drop in popularity for Ice.
After surviving a [[suicide]] attempt, Ice changed his musical style and lifestyle. While his later, less mainstream albums, including ''[[Hard to Swallow]]'', ''[[Bi-Polar (Vanilla Ice album)|Bi-Polar]]'' and ''[[Platinum Underground]]'', failed to chart or receive much radio airplay, Ice gained an [[Underground culture|underground following]]. In 2009, Ice began hosting ''[[The Vanilla Ice Project]]'' on [[DIY Network]]. His latest album, ''[[W.T.F. (Wisdom, Tenacity and Focus)|WTF – Wisdom, Tenacity & Focus]]'', was released in August 2011. After that, Ice signed to [[Psychopathic Records]].

{{quote|Ice's mic technique is actually stronger and more nimble than [[MC Hammer]]'s, and he really tries earnestly to show off the skills he does have.

In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics."{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[Allrovi]] reviewer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that "There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/music/album/mind-blowin-mw0000108435|title=Review of ''Mind Blowin''|access-date=June 30, 2008|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|publisher=[[Allrovi]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005122140/http://www.allrovi.com/music/album/mind-blowin-mw0000108435|archive-date=October 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said "A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time".

At around this time, Ice began using [[MDMA|ecstasy]], [[cocaine]] and heroin. During periods of heavy drug use, Ice received many [[tattoo]]s from [[tattoo artist|artist]] acquaintances.

By the summer, Ice was the world's No. 6-ranked sit-down jet ski racer, competing nearly every weekend and earning a [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] sponsorship.<ref name="Pearlman"/>

Uncertain about his future career, Ice studied real estate and started working on the side renovating and selling houses. In late 1995, he set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a [[grunge]] band, Pickin Scabz. The name was set to reflect Ice's career, and how he was healing from his suicide attempt, and that he was now "picking up the pieces".<ref name="Peisner"/> Ice expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound he was looking for.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1996, longtime associate and friend Monte Lipman signed Ice for [[Universal Republic Records]]. He did guest vocals with no stage name for the song "Boom" by [[Bloodhound Gang]] on their CD ''[[One Fierce Beer Coaster]]''.

Ice later developed a friendship with producer [[Ross Robinson]], who had become known for producing music by [[Deftones]], [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]] and [[Sepultura]]. Robinson and Ice shared an interest in [[motocross]] racing.<ref name="Peisner"/> Monte Lipman hoped that Robinson would produce a new Vanilla Ice album. According to Robinson, others had attempted to discourage him from working with Ice, saying it might hurt his reputation.

Ice's third studio album, ''[[Hard to Swallow]]'', featured a darker sound and lyrics than Ice's previous work, as well as various mixtures of different styles of hip hop and hard rock, which garnered media attention.

Having attracted a following outside of his former mainstream audience, Ice began recording independently, despite still being signed to Universal. During a recording session, Ice met the all-female American [[hard rock]] band from [[Southern California]], [[Betty Blowtorch]]. The late [[Bianca Halstead]] bonded with Ice and asked if he wanted to contribute a rap interlude to their track ''Size Queen''.

===Independent releases (2002–2009)===
With Quon back as manager, Ice was scheduled to appear in various reality TV programs. Ice, still an entertainer at heart, felt that the experience would be good for him. In 2002, he appeared on Celebrity Boxing, fighting [[Todd Bridges]] under the name 'Bi-Polar'. In 2003, he appeared in five episodes of [[Hollywood Squares]], eight episodes on 'The Farm' and three episodes of Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge, and made a cameo appearance in [[The New Guy]] in 2002.

From January to February 2004, Ice appeared on the reality television series ''[[The Surreal Life]]''.<ref name="WashingtonPost"/> Although much of the series was staged, Ice found the experience to be therapeutic, stating that a comment made by [[Tammy Faye Messner]] during filming, "We are who we are because of who we were", helped him accept his past.<ref name="Atria"/>

==Style and influences==
[[File:Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer.jpg|thumb|right|[[MC Hammer]] performing with Vanilla Ice in July 2009]]
{{As of|2009|alt=As of the late 2000s}}, Ice's live performances feature a mix of newer, rock and techno-influenced material and [[old-school hip hop]].<ref name="WashingtonPost"/> Ice performs with a live drummer and DJ,<ref>{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Reavy|title=Hyped Hammer/Ice show a hit with Utah fans|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705288347,00.html |work=[[Deseret News]]|date=March 2, 2009|access-date=March 10, 2009}}</ref> and sometimes sprays his audience with bottled water.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ki-Min|last=Sung|title=Vanilla Ice caps a crazy evening |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=June 15, 2006}}</ref> Ice's performances often feature an inflatable grim reaper balloon, a dancer in a clown mask, and confetti thrown into the audience.<ref name="Mooney"/> Describing his performances, Ice stated "It's high energy, stage diving, pyrotechnics, girls showing their breasts. It's crazy party atmosphere."<ref name="WashingtonPost"/>

Ice stated that his musical style was influenced by [[underground music]], rather than mainstream music, and that his influences included hip hop and [[funk]] artists such as [[Funkadelic]], [[Rick James]], [[Roger Troutman]], [[Egyptian Lover]] and [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]].<ref name="WashingtonPost"/> Ice is a big fan of 50's and 60's reggae and [[Bob Marley]]'s work and has also stated that he enjoys [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], and [[System of a Down]].<ref name="WashingtonPost"/>

Ice sometimes plays bass, drums and keyboards on studio recordings.<ref name="Vontz"/> Vanilla Ice referred to his mainstream music as "above-ground" rather than underground, as he tried to make danceable beats and removed expletives so that the songs could reach a wider audience. A lot of his early hits had Ice boasting sexual conquests, in 1991, Ice was quoted "I rap about what I know. Girls and stuff. That's what is going through my head."<ref>{{cite news|title=Why the World Is After Vanilla Ice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/03/arts/why-the-world-is-after-vanilla-ice.html?pagewanted=5&src=pm|work=Vanilla Ice Interview|publisher=New York Times|access-date=24 January 2016|date=February 3, 1991|first=James|last=Bernard}}</ref>

When asked about his darker sound in 2002, Ice replied; "Music is about reflection and I'm just reflecting my life and everything it's been and there's no way I'm going to be able to stress what I want and mean over a break beat, you know, it's too emotional and it's too intense, so you have to have the intensity of the band, it's like a symphony, you know, you have to build on the intense parts, and so it just wasn't going to happen, to come extreme over some hip hop record, so to exorcise my demons I had to have the band."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vanillaicecentral.com/june0702interview.html|title=Interview|publisher=Underground Scene|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328123117/http://vanillaicecentral.com/june0702interview.html|archive-date=March 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Along with [[Beastie Boys]], [[3rd Bass]], and [[House of Pain]], Ice was one of the earliest white rappers to attain major success.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kennedy |first1=Erica |title=White on both sides |journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=77 |date=Feb 2002 |issn=1070-4701 }}</ref> [[Chuck D]] has credited Ice as a regional breakthrough, stating "He broke through in the mid-South, in a Southern area in Texas, in something that was kind of indigenous to that hip-hop culture down there. He just doesn't get credit for it."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Morse |first=Nathan |date=April 20, 2009 |title=Public Enemy: The Rolling Stones of the Rap Game |journal=[[L.A.

The song's music video featured [[Henry Rollins]] as Ice, who is depicted as being assaulted by 3rd Bass. Ice responded to "Pop Goes the Weasel" with his 1992 song "The Wrath".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hess|first=Mickey|title=Is Hip Hop Dead?|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99461-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ishiphopdeadpast00hess_0/page/117 117–118]|chapter=White Rappers|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ishiphopdeadpast00hess_0/page/117}}</ref> [[Del tha Funkee Homosapien]] referred to Ice in the lyrics of "Pissin' on Your Steps", which appeared on his 1991 debut album ''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''.

After signing with Psychopathic Records, Violent J mentioned that Insane Clown Posse were longtime fans of Ice's work; "We were bumping him way before "Ice Ice Baby" blew up.

[[Eminem]] has often name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles he did with rapper [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] in 1992 where they performed against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single "[[Just Don't Give a Fuck]]", Eminem mentions Ice alongside [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], boasting in a playful manner that he is a better rapper. In "Role Model", Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice's dreadlocks. Ice responded to in a magazine interview with ''Vibe'' saying that Eminem "raps like a girl".<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 1999 |title=13 Ways Of Looking At A Whiteboy |journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |volume=7 |issue=5 |page=120 |issn=1070-4701 }}</ref> While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song "Marshall Mathers" which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song "[[Purple Pills]]" in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice's only response in song. On his album ''[[Bi-Polar (Vanilla Ice album)|Bi-Polar]]'', Ice mentions Eminem in a positive light ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say "I give him credit, I think he's talented, I think he's a killer rapper, you know I don't compare myself to him because he's another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don't colorize hip hop, it's stupid, but for people who are doing that are just looking through the eyes of a racial standpoint, and it really shouldn't be looked at that way, you're looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don't need to compare us two.
