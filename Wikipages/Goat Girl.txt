==Debut album==
Their self-titled debut album was released in April 2018. Featuring 19 tracks, it was well-received by the music press. ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' described it as "absurd, playful, and more than a little unsettling, sounding at times like a less romantic [[The Libertines|Libertines]],"<ref name="Pitchfork" /> going on to say the album, "appears daunting but proves to be light and accessible, with plenty of offbeat wit and many an unexpected twist down gothic country roads."<ref name="Pitchfork" /> ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "a weird, wily and unpredictable record, getting under the surface of things."<ref name="Guardian" /> The band played on the [[John Peel]] stage at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2019]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supajam.com/news/story/Live-Review-Goat-Girl-on-the-John-Peel-Stage|title=Live Review: Goat Girl on the John Peel Stage|website=Supajam.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>
