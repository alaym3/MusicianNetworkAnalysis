'''The Weepies''' are an American [[indie (music)|indie]] pop-[[folk music|folk]] singer-songwriters [[Steve Tannen]] and [[Deb Talan]]. Their music has been described as "subtly intoxicating folk-pop".<ref>Ruehl, Kim. "[http://folkmusic.about.com/od/cdreviews/gr/WeepiesSayImU.htm Review: ''Say I Am You'']." ''[[About.com]]''.

==History==
===Formation and early years (2001–2005)===
In 2001, Talan and Tannen were individually active as singer-songwriters but mutual fans of each other's music; Tannen played Talan's album "constantly", even singing along in harmony, while Talan in turn was captivated by and had "formed a kind of a relationship" with Tannen's music.<ref name="npr-2006">{{cite interview |last=Talan |first=Deb |subject-link=Deb Talan |last2=Tannen |first2=Steve |authorlink2=Steve Tannen |interviewer=Linda Wertheimer |work=Weekend Edition Saturday, [[National Public Radio]] |type=Interview: Audio |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=6041220 |title=The Weepies: Beautiful Music Together |date=September 9, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref> After eventually meeting at one of Tannen's shows at [[Club Passim]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], they quickly discovered a deep musical bond and began playing music together. According to Talan, the band's name

<blockquote>...came about from a few different sources, but one was, you know, those sort of old movies that were called weepies, where you could basically be guaranteed that if you needed a good cry, you could go and see one of these and bring your [[handkerchief|hanky]] and have a good time. And we want to be able to provide that for people. We want to make music that touches them and moves them in that way, the place where tears come from, for joy and for sorrow.<ref name="npr-2006"/></blockquote>

The Weepies' first album [[Happiness (The Weepies album)|''Happiness'']] was released at Club Passim on November 29, 2003, and though they were unsigned by a label it sold over 10,000 copies.

===Nettwerk (2005–2011)===
In 2005, The Weepies recorded a second album, ''[[Say I Am You]]'', in the bedroom of their home in [[Pasadena, California]]; the occasional motorist can be heard passing by in the background of some of the tracks.<ref name="npr-2006"/> In May 2005, after a sold-out show at The Living Room in New York City, The Weepies were approached by [[Nettwerk Records]] and signed by the label later that year. The album was released digitally in December of that year and physically on March 7, 2006. By February 2006, the album hit number one the [[iTunes Store]] list of most-downloaded folk albums in eight countries, with the single "World Spins Madly On" also topping the list of most-downloaded folk songs in the United States.<ref>"[http://www.nettwerk.com/news.jsp The Weepies Hit No.&nbsp;1 on iTunes!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813205622/http://www.nettwerk.com/news.jsp |date=2006-08-13 }}" ''Nettwerk: News''. February 9, 2006.</ref> [[Snow Patrol]]'s [[Gary Lightbody]] nominated the album for the [[Shortlist Music Prize]], awarded to the year's best album released in the United States selling fewer than 500,000 copies, though it failed to reach the ten-album shortlist.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The band played 180 shows in 2006 and toured Europe for the first time, playing at [[Oxegen 2006|Oxegen]], [[T in the Park]], and the [[Hurricane Festival]].

In 2007, the band collaborated with [[Mandy Moore]], playing and writing on her new album, ''[[Wild Hope]]''.

The Weepies recorded their third album, ''[[Hideaway (The Weepies album)|Hideaway]]'', in a small rental house in [[Topanga, California]]. Released in April 2008, it sold 14,000 copies in its first week and was the band's first entrance on the Billboard Top 200, charting at number 31.

The Weepies' fourth full-length album, ''[[Be My Thrill]]'', was released in August 2010, and featured [[Colbie Caillat]] in back-up vocals on the track "I Was Made for Sunny Days." The album topped the Top 200 Billboard Charts at No.&nbsp;34 and remained at No.&nbsp;3 on Billboard's Top Folk albums for nine weeks.<ref>''[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the weepies|chart=all}} The Weepies' Billboard Chart]'' Billboard.com February 8, 2010.</ref> The band's subsequent supporting tour had 26 sold-out shows across the United States.<ref>''[http://nettskinny.com/story/20100805/weepies-announce-first-tour-4-years The Weepies Announce First Tour In 4 Years!]'' Nettwerk Press Blog.

After Talan underwent both chemotherapy and surgery, the band's Facebook page announced on June 10, 2014, that she was in remission. The group then announced a new album entitled [[Sirens (The Weepies album)|Sirens]], which was released in April 2015.<ref name="facebook-deb">{{cite web|title=The Weepies |publisher=Facebook |date=June 10, 2013 |url=https://www.facebook.com/theweepies |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name="weepies-news">{{cite web|title=Deb Talan in treatment for cancer |publisher=Weepies |date= |url=http://www.theweepies.com/?p=news.php |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> In February 2015 they released the theme song, Sirens.<ref>[http://m.billboard.com/articles/news/6458246/exclusive-the-weepies-song-sirens#!/entry/view/id/114669 Exclusive: Listen to The Weepies New Title Song 'Sirens,' from Their First New Album in Five Years], [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]], February 2, 2015</ref> The full album was officially released on April 28, 2015.
