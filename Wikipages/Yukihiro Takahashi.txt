'''Yukihiro Takahashi''' (高橋 幸宏 ''Takahashi Yukihiro'', born June 6, 1952) is a Japanese musician, singer, record producer and actor, who is best known internationally as the drummer and lead vocalist of the [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]],<ref name="sarasota 1980">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7s4mAAAAIBAJ&pg=4481,2128223&dq=yukihiro+takahashi&hl=en|title=Computer rock music gaining fans|last=Inaba|first=Minoru|date=August 18, 1980|work=Sarasota Journal|pages=11–A|access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref> and as the former drummer of the [[Sadistic Mika Band]].  He is currently a member of the group [[METAFIVE]].

==Biography==
Yukihiro Takahashi first came to prominence as the drummer of the [[Sadistic Mika Band]] in the early 1970s, and became known to western audiences after this band (led by [[Kazuhiko Katō]], formerly of [[The Folk Crusaders]]) toured and recorded in the United Kingdom. After the [[Sadistic Mika Band]] disbanded, some of the members (including Takahashi) formed another band called [[The Sadistics]], who released several albums. Takahashi recorded his first solo album, ''Saravah'', in 1977. In 1978, Takahashi joined [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Haruomi Hosono]] to form the [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]].

After the Yellow Magic Orchestra disbanded in the mid 1980s, Takahashi went solo and released a large number of solo albums, primarily intended for the Japanese market. Takahashi has collaborated extensively with other musicians, including [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]], [[Iva Davies]] of [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ymMUAAAAIBAJ&pg=3348,5435471&dq=yukihiro+takahashi&hl=en|title=Icehouse duo pen a ballet|date=September 8, 1985|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|pages=140|access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref> [[Keiichi Suzuki (composer)|Keiichi Suzuki]] of the [[Moonriders]] (often as a duo dubbed "[[The Beatniks (band)|The Beatniks]]", although Suzuki essentially functioned as a member of Takahashi's backing band during the [[Moonriders]]' brief hiatus) and in particular [[Steve Jansen]]. Takahashi has released a single ''Stay Close'' and an EP ''Pulse'' as a duo with Jansen.

Takahashi helped compose the soundtrack to the [[anime]] series ''[[Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water]]'' in 1989, including the song  "Families".<ref>{{cite web|title=Synthpop's YMO to Hold 1st L.A. Concert in 32 Years|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-31/synthpop-ymo-to-hold-1st-l.a-concert-in-32-years|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=August 5, 2011|date=January 31, 2011}}</ref> Takahashi participated in temporary reunions of both the [[Sadistic Mika Band]] (missing the lead vocalist Mika who was replaced by [[Kaela Kimura]]), and The Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). Both of these reunions included tours of Japan, and an album of new material.

In the early 2000s, Takahashi became a member of the duo Sketch Show, with [[Haruomi Hosono]]. Sketch Show has released two albums, one of which, ''Loophole'', has been released in the UK. Both Takahashi and Hosono have recently reunited with Sakamoto as HASYMO – a combination of Human Audio Sponge and Yellow Magic Orchestra. This collaboration produced a new single "Rescue" in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ム › エンタメ › その他 › 記事 YMOメンバーによる新ユニットHASYMOの新曲クリップをお届け！|url=https://www.rbbtoday.com/article/2007/08/27/44400.html|date=2007-08-27|access-date=2021-10-01|work=RBB Today}}</ref> Takahashi is still actively involved in music and its production, having released the solo album ''Life Anew'' on July 17, 2013, as well as anniversary and live albums. His latest work is ''Saravah, Saravah!'' (2018), a remastered reboot of his solo debut album which, along with re-recorded vocals, features appearances by [[Ryuichi Sakamoto|Sakamoto]], [[Haruomi Hosono|Hosono]] and other musicians.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=高橋ユキヒロ　ソロ活動40周年記念「Saravah Saravah!」音源解禁&ジャケット写真 公開！|date=September 21, 2018|publisher=PR Times|url=https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000170.000019470.html|language=ja|access-date=October 1, 2021}}

Takahashi suffered from temporary headaches since the beginning of summer 2020. While Takahashi initially thought that this was a temporary migraine, he finally subjected himself to an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scan]]. It was discovered that the headache was the result of a brain tumor.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Thiessen|first=Brock|date=2020|title=YMO's Yukihiro Takahashi Undergoes Surgery to Remove Brain Tumour|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/ymos_yukihiro_takahashi_undergoes_surgery_to_remove_brain_tumour|url-status=live|archive-date=2020|website=exclaim!}}</ref> On August 13, 2020, Takahashi underwent surgery to remove the tumor; he announced that there were no aftereffects and that he would devote himself to treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nelson|first=Bill|date=2020|title=YMO's Yukihiro Takahashi Undergoes Surgery to Remove Brain Tumour|url=https://www.billnelson.com/forum/william-s-world/ymo-s-yukihiro-takahashi-undergoes-surgery-to-remove-brain-tumour|url-status=live|archive-date=2020}}</ref> On October 20, 2020, Takahashi announced through his social media that he had completed his course of treatment following the surgery.<ref>{{Cite news|title=高橋幸宏「皆さんに心から感謝」治療全行程が終了|url=https://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/202010200000423.html|date=October 20, 2020|access-date=November 20, 2020|work=[[Nikkan Sports]]|language=ja}}</ref>
