'''Whitey''' was an American band playing rock, funk and Latin styles from 1989 to 1997. Originating in [[Denton, Texas]], Whitey was popular in the [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] scenes including [[Deep Ellum]] and became known for its wild stage antics.  They toured extensively throughout Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana, and Arkansas.

In 1994, Whitey won the [[Dallas Observer]] Music Awards - Best FUNK/R&B Group Category <ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Zoller Seitz |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1995-04-13/news/1995-dallas-observer-music-awards-part-ii/3/ |title=1995 Dallas Observer Music Awards (Part II) - Page 3 |publisher=Dallas Observer |date=1995-04-13 |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>

Whitey was formed in Denton in the early1990s, the brain child of Corey Korn while playing in another Denton band called the Cowtippers. The original name was to be Kill Whitey (an ironic twist on a (mostly) white funk band), but Corey thought it might be too extreme and shortened it to Whitey.

"In the early 1990s, the underground sounds of Denton bubbled to the surface and people noticed — albeit not for the first time, since Denton’s musical prowess is a cyclical phenomenon. The main clubs of Denton at the time — the Gravity Room, the Library and later Rick’s Place, The Depot Beer Garden — were hosting funk bands of the Goodfoot, Whitey, [[Billy Goat (band)|Billygoat]] and [[Ten Hands (band)|Ten Hands]] variety."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unt.edu/northtexan/archives/s02/denton.htm |title=University of North Texas North Texan Online Summer 2002 : Denton Rocks! |publisher=Unt.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>
