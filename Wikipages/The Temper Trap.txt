==History==

===Formation and ''The Temper Trap EP'' (2005–2007)===
The Temper Trap formed as an [[indie pop]] band in 2005.<ref name="Clash"/><ref name="BBC"/> Indonesian-born Mandagi, who is originally from [[Manado]] and a grand-nephew of [[Arie Frederik Lasut]],<ref name="EveningStandard">{{cite web|title=The Temper Trap: Put your hands in the air for the globetrotters of rock|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/the-temper-trap-put-your-hands-in-the-air-for-the-globetrotters-of-rock-a3268831.html|work=London Evening Standard|access-date=14 June 2016|author=David Smyth|date=10 June 2016}}</ref> was a [[Street performance|busker]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia, in 1999 when he met Aherne, who wanted to learn to play guitar. Six years later, Mandagi met Dundas while the pair worked in a clothing store. In 2005, the three friends decided to form a band, with Mandagi on vocals and guitars, and Dundas on drums, while Aherne was later convinced to join on bass guitar by Mandagi. The group was named "The Temper Trap" after Temper Temper, the trio's first choice, was rejected due to its use by a United States (US) band. The Temper Trap rehearsed with a variety of second guitarists before Dundas recommended his former [[Geelong Grammar School|Geelong Grammar]] schoolmate, Sillitto, on lead guitar.<ref name="Howl"/><ref name="Donovan"/> The group performed at [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival]] in March 2006.<ref name="Leahey"/>

The group signed to [[Michael Gudinski]]'s label, [[Liberation Music]], and released its debut extended play (EP), ''[[The Temper Trap EP|The Temper Trap]]'', in November 2006 through the label;<ref name="Howl"/> the EP was produced by Scott Horscroft ([[The Sleepy Jackson]], [[Silverchair]]).<ref name="Mineo"/> According to a live review by "planetclare" of Australian music website FasterLouder, Dundas sometimes abandons the drums and plays guitar, while Mandagi's voice "hits a note and then transcends it, slicing the sound barrier and leaving you with your mouth open and your eyes wide". The review also described Aherne regularly moving around the stage and Sillitto providing guitar solos that "subtlety drove the melody from the side of stage".<ref name="Planetclare"/> After finishing an Australian tour, the band then performed at the [[V Festival (Australia)|V Festival]] in Melbourne, Sydney (March 2007) and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] (April).<ref name="Mineo"/>

===''Conditions'' (2008–2011)===
In late 2008, The Temper Trap started recording their debut album, ''[[Conditions (album)|Conditions]]'', in Melbourne with [[audio engineering|engineering]] by record producer [[Kalju Tonuma]].<ref name="Leahey2"/> They travelled to the UK and attracted the attention of the local music industry after playing at the [[Musexpo]] in London in October.<ref name="Marshall"/> By January 2009, the band had signed to [[Infectious Records]] for European releases.<ref name="Marshall"/> The [[BBC]] chose The Temper Trap in its top&nbsp;15 ''[[Sound of 2009]]'' list.<ref name="BBC"/><ref name="Electric"/> In March, the band finished recording ''Conditions'' in London with UK music producer [[Jim Abbiss]].<ref name="Marshall"/> Mandagi said his key influences when recording it had included [[Radiohead]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Massive Attack]] and [[U2]].<ref name="Apollo's Cred"/> In May, after performing at [[South by Southwest]] in March, they signed to [[Glassnote Records]] for US releases.<ref name="Crazed Hits"/> The album was released in Australia on 19 June and debuted at No.&nbsp;9 on the Australian [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref name="AUS" /> It was released in the UK in August. The band had returned to London in early May to "spend a bit of time on the continent and try and build a fan base over here", according to Sillitto. He says "it was always our dream to at least come over here and give it a good crack early on".<ref name="The Temper Trap – Music Feeds"/>

The album's lead single, "[[Sweet Disposition]]", was released in Australia in October 2008.<ref name="JPLay"/> It was re-recorded with Abbiss and re-issued in June 2009. This version peaked in the top&nbsp;10 on the [[Ultratop|Belgian]], [[Irish Singles Chart|Irish]] and [[UK Singles Chart]]s and reached No.&nbsp;14 on the ARIA Singles Chart.<ref name="Sweet"/> The group played shows in Europe with [[Silversun Pickups]] and garnered attention from newfound fans and media. In August, they played the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]. In September, the band embarked on their first headlining UK tour, including Hare and Hounds in Birmingham<ref name="Henwood"/> and the 300-capacity Arts Centre in Norwich. The tour started and finished in Brighton, with the Goldhawks as their support act.

In August, The Temper Trap played on a balcony over London's Camden Lock to promote the release of their next single "[[Science of Fear]]" on the online viral music show ''[[BalconyTV]].''<ref name="Regan"/> In late November, the group cancelled sold-out show dates in Germany to return to Australia to perform at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2009|ARIA Awards]].<ref name="Adams"/> They received four nominations in the categories Album of the Year, Breakthrough Album of the Year and Best Rock Album for ''Conditions'', and Single of the Year for "Sweet Disposition".<ref name="Aria Awards 2009"/>
