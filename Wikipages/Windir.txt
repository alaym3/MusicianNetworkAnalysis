'''Windir''' ("Warrior" in [[English language|English]]) was a [[black metal]] band from [[Sogndal]], [[Norway]]. The band was formed in 1994 by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Terje "Valfar" Bakken, and released its debut album ''[[Sóknardalr]]'' in 1997. Windir combined black metal with Scandinavian [[folk music]], [[Scandinavian folklore|folklore]] and [[mythology]], and many of the band's lyrics are written in [[Sognamål]]. Windir produced four albums in their almost ten years of existence. The band broke up in March 2004 after frontman Valfar died of [[hypothermia]] after becoming caught in a blizzard on his way to his family's cabin in Norway. Following his death, the remaining band members went on to form a number of new bands including [[Vreid]], Mistur, and [[Cor Scorpii]].

Most of the band's early albums featured lyrics written in frontman Valfar's native dialect, Sognamal. The band had an "intense affinity for traditional music and Norwegian texts, drawing much of its lyrical content from local sagas, using traditional folk tunes in its music, and singing in an archaic rural dialect."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/metalrulesglobeh00wall|url-access=registration|quote=Windir.|title=Metal Rules the Globe: Heavy Metal Music Around the World|last=Berger|first=Harris M.|last2=Greene|first2=Paul D.|date=2011-12-27|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822347334|pages=[https://archive.org/details/metalrulesglobeh00wall/page/n203 194]|language=en}}</ref> With the coining of the term, the genre "Sognametal" as established by Windir has inspired many bands from the small region of [[Sogn og Fjordane]], most of whom are ex-members of Windir or friends of them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.toiletovhell.com/sognametal-the-legacy-of-windir-part-1/|title=Sognametal: The Legacy of Windir – Part 1|date=2014-10-20|work=The Toilet Ov Hell|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en-US}}</ref> These bands include: [[Vreid]], [[Cor Scorpii]], Mistur, Sigtyr and Feigd.
