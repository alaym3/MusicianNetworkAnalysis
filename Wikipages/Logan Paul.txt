In February 2017, [[Dwayne Johnson]] released on his own YouTube channel, "Logan Paul has been cut from, like, all of The Rock's movies", a video starring himself and Paul, in which Johnson informs Paul that he has been cut from all of Johnson's films, and consoles Paul by making him the "ambassador" to his upcoming ''[[Baywatch (film)|Baywatch]]'' feature film.<ref>Cohen, Ian (February 2017).

On November 23, 2017, Paul released his new single, "No Handlebars", a track that draws heavily on an interpolated sample of the song "[[Handlebars (song)|Handlebars]]" by the American alternative hip hop group [[Flobots]]. The song was heavily criticized for its perceived sexual objectification of women, including a scene in its music video where Paul rides several women like a bicycle. Flobots frontman [[Jamie Laurie]] lambasted Paul for both the "sexist" lyrical content of the song and for unauthorized use of the sample, calling him the face of "douchebag entitlement". Laurie would later go on to release a track with lyrics deriding Paul, titled "Handle Your Bars". Paul did not respond to Laurie's comments nor the backlash towards "No Handlebars"; however, he has since deleted the song from YouTube.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flobots Go to War With Vlogger Logan Paul Over 'No Handlebars' |url=http://www.westword.com/music/flobots-go-to-war-with-vlogger-logan-paul-over-no-handlebars-9810636 |website=[[Westword]] |first=Kyle |last=Harris |date=December 21, 2017 |access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref>

In January 2019, Paul remarked on his ''Impaulsive'' podcast, "What is it, male-only March? We're gonna attempt to go [[gay]] for just one month." He received widespread criticism for implying that being gay is a choice, with [[LGBTQ+]] organization [[GLAAD]] responding to Paul's statement on Twitter, writing, "That's not how it works, Logan Paul."<ref>{{cite news|first=Sabrina|last=Barr|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/logan-paul-criticism-backlash-gay-podcast-impaulsive-youtube-apology-a8724296.html|title=Logan Paul criticised for saying he's 'going gay' for one month|date=January 12, 2019|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref>

In March 2019, Paul released what has been described as a [[mockumentary]] exploring the [[Flat Earth#Conspiracy theory|Flat Earth Theory]]. In the video, he interviewed many self-proclaimed "[[Modern flat Earth societies|Flat Earthers]]", and spoke at the 2018 Flat Earth International Conference, which took place in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/logan-paul-doesnt-actually-think-the-earth-is-flat-movie/|title=Good news everyone, Logan Paul doesn't actually think the Earth is flat|first=Morgan|last=Sung|website=[[Mashable]]|date=March 21, 2019|access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref>

Logan Paul was sued by Planeless Pictures in December 2020 for the aforementioned 2017 incident in Aokigahara, when he posted a video including a recently deceased suicide victim. Planeless Pictures accused him of posting the video in order to escape a movie deal he had with them where he would star in, write, and produce their film [[Airplane Mode (2019 film)|''Airplane Mode'']]. They also claimed that the video led to [[Google]] suspending their contract with them, leaving them $3 million in debt.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gabrielle|first=Julia|date=December 30, 2020|title=Studio Sues Logan Paul Over Controversial 'Suicide Forest' Video, Alleges YouTuber Torpedoed Movie Deal|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/studio-sues-logan-paul-over-controversial-suicide-forest-video-alleges-youtuber-3111822|access-date=December 31, 2020|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]}}</ref>

{{Main|KSI vs. Logan Paul II}}
On September 4, 2019, it was announced that Paul would be making his professional boxing debut in a rematch against KSI, which would be shown exclusively on [[DAZN]] in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://campusinsiders.com/football/|title=Football Archives}}</ref> The fight was scheduled to take place on November 9 at the [[Staples Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/27530738/youtubers-paul-ksi-make-pro-boxing-debuts|title=ESPN: YouTubers Paul, KSI to make pro boxing debuts|date=September 3, 2019}}</ref> At the UK press conference for the rematch, Paul again stirred controversy as he accused KSI of having five abortions, before remarking, "Five babies dead. I might return the favor and kill you." He received criticism from [[United States abortion-rights movement|abortion rights activists]], who described his comment as "horrific", while [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion activists]] came to his defense.

=== Exhibition bouts ===

====Mayweather vs. Paul====
{{Main|Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Logan Paul}}
On December 6, 2020, it was announced that Paul would face former [[List of boxing quintuple champions|five-division world champion]] [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] in an exhibition bout on February 20, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baby |first=Ben |date=December 6, 2020 |title=Mayweather back to face Logan Paul in exhibition |url=https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/30465352/floyd-mayweather-jr-sets-exhibition-bout-youtuber-logan-paul |access-date=June 9, 2021 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref> The fight was postponed, and took place on June 6, 2021 at [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 28, 2021|title=Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Logan Paul: What you need to know about their exhibition bout|url=https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/30575064/floyd-mayweather-vs-logan-paul-need-know-their-exhibition-bout|access-date=June 9, 2021|website=ESPN.com|language=en}}</ref> On May 6, 2021, Mayweather and Paul met for the first time at a press conference at Hard Rock Stadium, where the latter's brother, [[Jake Paul]], became involved in an angry brawl with Mayweather when he removed Mayweather's hat from his head.<ref>{{Cite web|last=161385360554578|date=May 7, 2021|title=Floyd Mayweather and Jake Paul get into furious BRAWL at press conference|url=https://talksport.com/sport/boxing/877288/floyd-mayweather-jake-paul-brawl-logan-paul/|access-date=June 9, 2021|website=talkSPORT|language=en-US}}</ref> A visibly irate Mayweather was captured on video saying, "I'll kill you motherfucker!

The bout consisted of constant [[Clinch fighting|clinching]] initiated by Paul and went the full distance to the sound of boos from the crowd, with no winner being announced.<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 7, 2021|title=Logan Paul v Floyd Mayweather ends in boos as each fighter makes millions|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/07/logan-paul-vs-floyd-mayweather-boxing-fight-result-earnings|access-date=June 9, 2021|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Mayweather had started tentatively and defensively, reluctant to throw often and avoiding most of Paul's shots. Toward the end of the first round, Paul unleashed a wild flurry, but most of his punches were blocked by Mayweather's guard. The second round was similar to the first, with Mayweather content with the slow pace of the fight. He finally turned up the offense in the third, opening up with some clean left hooks that rocked Paul's head back, as well as mixing in his trademark pull counter with the right hand.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Floyd Mayweather vs. Logan Paul fight results, highlights: 'Money' impresses as exhibition goes the distance|url=https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/floyd-mayweather-vs-logan-paul-fight-results-highlights-money-impresses-as-exhibition-goes-the-distance/live/|access-date=June 9, 2021|website=CBSSports.com|language=en}}</ref> From the fourth round onward, Paul was visibly fatigued and took every opportunity to utilize his weight advantage by tying the smaller Mayweather up in the clinch after every exchange. Despite Paul's constant attempts at neutralizing Mayweather's offense, the latter continued to dictate the pace of the fight and land the cleaner, more effective punches. Toward the end of the eighth and final round, Paul showboated when it became clear that he had done enough to avoid being stopped as most had predicted would be the case,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jones|first=Zack|title=Floyd Mayweather Vs.

Mayweather's superior boxing was reflected by the [[CompuBox]] punch stats, with Mayweather having landed 43 punches of 107 thrown (40.2%), compared to Paul's 28 landed of 217 thrown (12.9%).<ref>{{Cite web|last=CompuBox|title=Floyd Mayweather vs. Logan Paul - CompuBox Punch Stats|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/floyd-mayweather-vs-logan-paul-compubox-punch-stats--158204|access-date=June 9, 2021|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us}}</ref>

In his post-fight interview, Mayweather praised his opponent, saying "He's better than I thought he was... he's a tough, rough competitor." Paul appeared to harbor some doubt about how seriously Mayweather had taken the fight, saying "I'm going to go home thinking, 'Did Floyd let me survive?{{'"}}<ref name=":1" /> Shortly after the fight was over, Paul expressed renewed interest in a change of pace for his burgeoning combat sports career when he categorized himself as 'a good grappler' and explained that an MMA career was still on the table for his future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jitsmagazine.com/logan-paul-interested-in-mma-i-am-a-good-grappler/|title=Logan Paul Interested in MMA: 'I Am a Good Grappler'|date=June 8, 2021}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Paul has English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Jewish and German ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|title=A death in the family...|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAfl-h5fkc|website=YouTube (Logan Paul Vlogs)}}</ref>

In October 2015, Paul lived in the same apartment complex on [[Hollywood and Vine]] in [[Hollywood, California]] as other social media celebrities including [[List of Playboy Playmates of 2011#October|Amanda Cerny]], [[Juanpa Zurita]], and [[King Bach|Andrew Bachelor]], with his roommates Mark Dohner and [[Evan Eckenrode]]. This proximity facilitated various collaborations on their respective videos.<ref name="CBSNews" /> In October 2017, Paul and Eckenrode relocated to an estate in [[Encino, California]].<ref>{{cite web |title=YouTube star Logan Paul snaps up a prized Encino estate for $6.55 million |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-logan-paul-encino-20171024-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times|date=October 25, 2017 }}</ref>

In episode 179 of ''Impaulsive,'' Paul announced his plan to run for President of the United States, saying: “2032 is the first year I can run, but it’s probably going to be when I’m a grown-ass man with lots of intelligence and wisdom. Around 2050-ish, let’s call it.”{{cn|date=October 2021}}

In episode 198 of ''Impaulsive'' with guest [[Carl Lentz]], who was pastor of [[Hillsong Church]] [[New York City|NYC]] at the time, Paul discussed religion, and described himself as [[Spiritual but not religious|"not overly religious"]]. Paul also said that he was a Christian.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |title=WHAT RELIGION SHOULD YOU BELIEVE IN? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2SG--lhu1c&ab_channel=ImpaulsiveClips |website=YouTube |publisher=Impaulsive |access-date=November 5, 2020}}</ref> He specified that he believes in a [[Creator deity|"creator"]], but he doesn't know what this creator's role would be in human's lives. The episode garnered mockery toward Paul, who initially claimed that Jews believe in [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] as their god, before being corrected.<ref name=":2" />

In February 2021, Paul announced that he would be moving to [[Dorado, Puerto Rico]]  from Los Angeles. He stated that the high taxes in California were the main motivator for the move.<ref>{{Cite news|date=February 17, 2021|title=YouTube Star Logan Paul Deserts California for Puerto Rico|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/youtube-star-logan-paul-deserts-california-for-puerto-rico|access-date=February 19, 2021}}</ref>As of June 2021, he has made the move and is currently living in a $13 million mansion.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-06-03|title=Inside Logan Paul's swanky $13M Puerto Rico mansion|url=https://nypost.com/2021/06/03/logan-paul-training-for-floyd-mayweather-fight-at-13m-mansion/|access-date=2021-08-27|website=New York Post|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Health===
Paul claims he is [[red-green colorblind]]. However, he has been parodied and criticized by [[YouTube personalities]] such as [[h3h3 Productions|Ethan Klein]] and [[iDubbbz]] for faking his reactions in a video in which he used [[Color blindness#Lenses|color-corrective glasses]] for the first time. Paul himself admits that he "embellished" and "exaggerated his reactions" to the glasses, but added that he "did not lie" about his impairment.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dryden |first=Liam |title=Logan Paul Addresses Allegations He Faked His Colourblindness |url=http://www.wetheunicorns.com/news/logan-paul-allegations-colourblindness/ |access-date=January 21, 2018 |work=We The Unicorns |date=September 5, 2017}}</ref>

In February 2019, Paul claimed that he has long-term [[brain damage]], which he sustained from playing high school football. He claims that the [[Daniel Amen|eccentric celebrity doctor]], who diagnosed him, says it affects his ability to have [[empathy]] and a human connection with others.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/logan-paul-brain-damage-youtube/ |title=Logan Paul says he has brain damage that affects his empathy |date=February 25, 2019 |website=The Daily Dot |access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY-jGedHMzE |title= I have holes in my brain |date= Feb 24, 2019 |website= YouTube}}</ref>

When filming a video for his Vine channel in 2014, Paul attempted a stunt during which he landed on a chair and damaged part of his right testicle.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/logan-paul-testicle/ |title=Logan Paul once lost a chunk of testicle in a stunt gone wrong |work=[[The Daily Dot]] |first=Jay |last=Hathaway |date=October 6, 2017 |access-date=October 6, 2017}}</ref>
