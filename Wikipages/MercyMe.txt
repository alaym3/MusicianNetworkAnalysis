'''MercyMe''' is an American [[contemporary Christian music]] band founded in [[Edmond, Oklahoma]]. The band consists of lead vocalist [[Bart Millard]], percussionist Robby Shaffer, bassist Nathan Cochran and guitarists Michael Scheuchzer and Barry Graul.

The band formed in 1994 and released six independent albums before signing with [[INO Records]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=December 2002 |title=Real People. Real Worship |url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/stories/11535185/mercyme/ |magazine=[[CCM Magazine]] |access-date=July 3, 2009}}</ref>
The group first gained mainstream recognition with the crossover single "[[I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)|I Can Only Imagine]]", which elevated their debut album, ''[[Almost There (MercyMe album)|Almost There]]'', to triple platinum certification. Since then, the group has released eight additional studio albums (six of which have been certified gold) and a greatest hits album, ''[[10 (MercyMe album)|10]]''. The group has also had 13 consecutive top 5 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Christian Songs]] chart, with 7 of them reaching No.&nbsp;1. MercyMe has won 8 [[Dove Awards]] and has had many Grammy Award nominations. On April 8, 2014, the band released its eighth studio album titled ''Welcome to the New''. Their ninth studio album, ''Lifer'', was released on March 31, 2017, and tenth, ''Inhale (Exhale)'', was released on April 30, 2021.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years ===

Singer Bart Millard met pianist James Phillip Bryson in [[Lakeland, Florida]], after an invitation from his youth pastor.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cusic |first=Don |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music: Pop, Rock, and Worship |date=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=USA |page=300}}</ref> Both led a praise team on a trip to Europe. They both felt a call to work full-time in music. They later met the guitarist Michael John Scheuchzer, who joined them, then moved to [[Oklahoma City]]. The group was officially formed in 1994 in Henderson Hills Baptist Church in [[Edmond, Oklahoma]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Pat |last=Gilliland |url=https://newsok.com/article/1890784/band-could-only-imagine-success-song-would-bring |title=Band could only imagine success song would bring |website=newsok.com |location=USA |date=February 21, 2004}}</ref>

In 1997, MercyMe moved to [[Nashville]] to find a record label. After a year, they left Nashville for [[Dallas]] and recorded an album.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tramel |first=Jimmie |date=April 1, 2018 |title=MercyMe guitarist talks about the band's Oklahoma ties and the story behind the hit song 'I Can Only Imagine' |work=tulsaworld.com |location=USA |url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/features/mercyme-guitarist-talks-about-the-band-s-oklahoma-ties-and/article_38572115-5922-5b3a-a1a3-6503333e47bb.html}}</ref> Then they settled in [[Greenville, Texas]], and served at Highland Terrace Baptist Church.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 6, 2003 |title=Christian Rock Crosses Over |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/07/06/christian-rock-crosses-over.html |publisher=Fox News Channel |location=USA}}</ref>

The trio set up a studio and a "living area" in an old abandoned day-care center.<ref name="Fluke brings Mercyme together">{{Cite journal |last=Somers |first=Eliza Marie |date=May 24, 2006 |title=Fluke brings Mercyme together |url=http://www.denverpost.com/music/ci_12126370 |journal=[[The Denver Post]] |access-date=June 30, 2009}}</ref> Bassist Nathan Cochran and drummer Robby Shaffer later joined the band, accompanying the band in releasing six independent projects before signing with [[INO Records]] in 2001.

=== ''Almost There'', ''Spoken For'' and ''Undone'' (2001–2004) ===

After signing with [[INO Records]], the band released its first major debut album, ''[[Almost There (MercyMe album)|Almost There]]''. The single "[[I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)|I Can Only Imagine]]" earned the band a [[Dove Award]] in 2002 for song of the year. However, it was not until three years after its release that the song began to gain mainstream success,<ref name="Fluke brings Mercyme together" /> topping the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] sales chart for seven weeks,<ref name="MercyMe begins ‘Imagine Tour’ in 2004">{{Cite journal |date=December 13, 2003 |title=MercyMe begins 'Imagine Tour' in 2004 |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20031213/mercyme-begins-imagine-tour-in-2004/index.html |journal=[[The Christian Post]] |access-date=July 8, 2009}}</ref> and peaking at No.&nbsp;71 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], No.&nbsp;33 on the [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Mainstream Top 40]], No.&nbsp;27 on the [[Adult Top 40]], No.&nbsp;5 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]], and No.&nbsp;52 on the [[Hot Country Songs|Country Songs]] charts. The success of the single ultimately propelled ''Almost There'' to being certified double platinum, representing sales of over 2&nbsp;million albums, as well as the single itself being certified platinum.

In 2002, MercyMe released ''[[Spoken For]]'', which peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Christian Albums]] chart. The album's two singles, "Spoken For" and "Word of God Speak", went on to peak at No.&nbsp;1 on Christian radio charts, with "Word of God Speak" spending a record 22 weeks atop the newly created ''Billboard'' [[Christian Songs]] chart.<ref name="MercyMe begins ‘Imagine Tour’ in 2004" />
The album was eventually certified gold by the RIAA.<ref name="riaa">{{Cite web |title=RIAA – Gold & Platinum Searchable Database |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007 |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]}}</ref>

''Spoken For'' earned the band three Dove Awards, but was to a certain extent overlooked by the attention that "I Can Only Imagine" was receiving in the mainstream markets at the time.

In 2003, guitarist Barry Graul, who had previously been with the Christian hard rock band [[Whitecross (band)|Whitecross]], joined MercyMe,<ref name="Christian Group MercyMe Combines Rock, Religious Influences in Music">{{Cite news |last=Hoover |first=Carl |date=October 16, 2008 |title=Christian Group MercyMe Combines Rock, Religious Influences in Music |work=[[Waco Tribune-Herald]] |url=http://www.wacotrib.com/aw/content/accesswaco/2008/10/16/10162008wacmercyme.html |url-status=dead |access-date=July 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819042424/http://www.wacotrib.com/aw/content/accesswaco/2008/10/16/10162008wacmercyme.html |archive-date=August 19, 2009}}</ref> giving MercyMe a second guitarist to provide greater depth on their third studio album, ''[[Undone (MercyMe album)|Undone]]''.<ref name="Christian Group MercyMe Combines Rock, Religious Influences in Music" /> In 2004, the band headlined the "Imagine Tour" with fellow artists [[Amy Grant]] and [[Bebo Norman]].<ref name="MercyMe begins ‘Imagine Tour’ in 2004" /> In addition to headlining the "Imagine Tour", MercyMe released their third major label album, ''[[Undone (MercyMe album)|Undone]]'', which peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and No.&nbsp;1 on the Christian Albums charts, their highest debut on the chart at that point. The album spawned three successful singles – "[[Here with Me (MercyMe song)|Here With Me]]" (which topped the Christian Songs chart as well as reaching No.&nbsp;12 on the Adult Contemporary chart and No.&nbsp;38 on the Adult Top 40 chart), "Homesick" (which reached No.&nbsp;3 on the Christian Songs chart and No.&nbsp;9 on the Adult Contemporary charts), and "[[In the Blink of an Eye (song)|In the Blink of an Eye]]" (which topped the Christian Songs chart). The album itself won a [[Dove Award]] for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year at the [[36th GMA Dove Awards]], and was certified gold by the RIAA.

MercyMe also released a live video album, ''MercyMe Live'', in 2004, which eventually was certified platinum by the RIAA.

=== ''The Christmas Sessions'' and ''Coming Up to Breathe'' (2005–2006) ===

In 2005, MercyMe launched a tour with [[Jeremy Camp]], [[The Afters]] and [[Monk and Neagle]] in support of their album, ''[[Undone (MercyMe album)|Undone]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Camacho |first=Justin |date=November 2, 2004 |title=MercyMe Schedules 'Undone' Tour For February |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20041102/mercyme-schedules-undone-tour-for-february/index.html |journal=[[The Christian Post]] |access-date=July 17, 2009}}</ref>

After releasing ''Undone'' in 2004, the band took a time to rest before their next big release, so they decided to work on a Christmas record.<ref name="Well Mercy Me, Children">{{Cite journal |date=December 2005 |title=Well Mercy Me, Children |url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/stories/11535625/mercyme/ |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |access-date=July 19, 2009}}</ref> ''[[The Christmas Sessions]]'' was recorded and was released on September 27, 2005. The album spawned seven songs which hit the top 40 on the Christian Songs chart (with one hitting No.&nbsp;1 and two others reaching the top ten), and four of these charted in the top 40 of the Adult Contemporary chart (with one peaking in the top 10). The album itself peaked at No.&nbsp;64 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and No.&nbsp;3 on the Christian Songs chart.

To promote ''The Christmas Sessions'', MercyMe had a Christmas tour with [[Steven Curtis Chapman]], who also released a Christmas album that year titled ''[[All I Really Want for Christmas]]''.

In 2006, MercyMe released ''[[Coming Up to Breathe]]'', which charted at No.&nbsp;13 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and No.&nbsp;1 on the Christian Albums chart.<ref name="Artist Chart History-MercyMe">{{Cite web |title=Artist Chart History-MercyMe |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mercyme|chart=all}} |access-date=July 19, 2009 |work=Billboard}}</ref><ref name="MercyMe Hits Billboard Top 20 with Latest Release">{{Cite journal |last=Camacho |first=Justin |date=May 5, 2006 |title=MercyMe Hits Billboard Top 20 with Latest Release |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20060505/mercyme-hits-billboard-top-20-with-latest-release/index.html |journal=[[The Christian Post]] |access-date=July 17, 2009}}</ref> Although the band had earned a reputation for being an adult contemporary group with their other albums, the group decided to make ''Coming Up to Breathe'' a more rock-oriented album, in the vein of their earlier [[grunge]]-influenced albums.<ref name="MercyMe's Jesus Freak?">{{Cite journal |last=Farias |first=Andree |year=2006 |title=MercyMe's Jesus Freak? |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2006/mercyme-0506.html |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |access-date=July 9, 2009}}</ref> As such, it also peaked at No.&nbsp;5 on the [[Top Rock Albums]] chart and No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Top Alternative Albums]] chart, their only chart appearances on these records to date.

''Coming Up to Breathe'' spawned three radio singles ("[[So Long Self]]", "[[Hold Fast (song)|Hold Fast]]", and "[[Bring the Rain]]"), two of which ("So Long Self" and "Bring the Rain") reached the top spot on the Christian Songs chart. "So Long Self" and "Hold Fast" also both reached the top 30 on the Adult Contemporary chart. ''Coming Up to Breathe'' was eventually certified gold by the RIAA.

In support of ''Coming Up to Breathe'', MercyMe headlined the "Coming Up to Breathe Tour", along with [[Audio Adrenaline]] (on its farewell tour) and [[Phil Wickham]], seeing half their shows sell out two weeks into the tour.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=October 19, 2006 |title=MercyMe National Tour Selling Out Nationwide |url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/headlines/11535753/mercyme/ |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |access-date=July 8, 2009}}</ref>

=== ''All That is Within Me'', ''Coming Up to Breathe: Acoustic'' and ''10'' (2007–2009) ===

On November 20, 2007, MercyMe released ''[[All That Is Within Me]]''. Millard, the band's lead singer, had believed that ''All That is Within Me'' was going to be a worship album with half of the songs being cover songs and the other half original songs; however, when the band got in studio, they ended up having written all the songs found in this album.<ref name="Comfortable with All That Is Within">{{Cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Stan |year=2007 |title=Comfortable with All That Is Within |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2007/mercyme-1107.html |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |access-date=July 4, 2009}}</ref>

Upon release, the album peaked at No.&nbsp;15 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and No.&nbsp;1 on the Christian Songs chart. The album contained three singles ("God With Us", "You Reign" and "Finally Home"), all of which reached the top three on the Christian Songs chart; "Finally Home" also peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the Adult Contemporary chart (their last appearance on the chart to date). ''All That Is Within Me'' was also certified gold by the RIAA.

In 2008, the band released ''Coming Up to Breathe: Acoustic'', an acoustic version of their earlier release ''Coming Up to Breathe''.

On April 7, 2009, MercyMe released their first [[greatest hits]] compilation, ''[[10 (MercyMe album)|10]]'',<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Williams |first=Lindsay |date=April 2009 |title=10 Questions with MercyMe |url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/stories/11601914/mercyme/ |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |access-date=July 19, 2009}}</ref> a double album consisting of 15 studio recordings (12 of which were previously singles and 3 of which were new recordings) and 11 live or concept videos, as well as several documentaries on the band. The album charted at No.&nbsp;18 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and No.&nbsp;1 on the Christian Songs chart, although no singles were released from the album.

=== ''The Generous Mr. Lovewell'' and ''The Worship Sessions'' (2010–2011) ===

MercyMe's sixth studio album, ''[[The Generous Mr. Lovewell]]'', was released on May 4, 2010. The album itself peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 (MercyMe's highest debut to date and first top 5 album ever on the chart) and No.&nbsp;1 on the Christian Albums chart. The album (a concept album relating around the overall theme of love and vaguely relating to its self-titled character) has also spawned three singles – "[[All of Creation (song)|All of Creation]]", "[[Beautiful (MercyMe song)|Beautiful]]", and "[[Move (MercyMe song)|Move]]" – all of which reached the top spot on the Christian Songs chart. Upon wrapping up "The Generous Mr. Lovewell" tour, MercyMe was asked to perform the national anthem at a [[Dallas Cowboys]] game.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 15, 2010 |title=MercyMe Closes 2010 With Billboard's National Christian Audience and Christian AC Song of the Year, "All of Creation" |url=http://fusemix.com/en/the-leak/1722-mercyme-closes-2010-with-billboards-national-christian-audience-and-christian-ac-song-of-the-year-all-of-creation |access-date=April 5, 2012 |publisher=Fusemix.com}}</ref>
