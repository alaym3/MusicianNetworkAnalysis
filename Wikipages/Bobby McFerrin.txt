'''Robert Keith McFerrin Jr.''' (born March 11, 1950)<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=1562}}</ref> is an American folk-jazz vocalist. He is known for his vocal techniques, such as singing fluidly but with quick and considerable jumps in pitch—for example, sustaining a melody while also rapidly alternating with [[arpeggio]]s and harmonies—as well as [[scat singing]], [[polyphonic]] [[overtone singing]], and improvisational [[beatboxing|vocal percussion]]. He is widely known for performing and recording regularly as an unaccompanied solo vocal artist. He has frequently collaborated with other artists from both the jazz and classical scenes.

McFerrin's song "[[Don't Worry, Be Happy]]" was a No. 1 U.S. pop hit in 1988 and won [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] honors at the [[Grammy Awards of 1989|1989 Grammy Awards]]. McFerrin has also worked in collaboration with instrumentalists, including pianists [[Chick Corea]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Joe Zawinul]], drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]], and cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]].

==Early life and education==
McFerrin was born in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], United States, the son of operatic [[baritone]] [[Robert McFerrin]] and singer Sara Copper. He attended [[Cathedral High School (Los Angeles)|Cathedral High School in Los Angeles]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-11-17|title=Cheryl North: Jeremy Denk, Bobby McFerrin: Two talented wits bring their music to San Francisco|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/11/17/cheryl-north-jeremy-denk-bobby-mcferrin-two-talented-wits-bring-their-music-to-san-francisco/|access-date=2020-10-21|website=The Mercury News|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Cerritos College]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Los Angeles Times|date=1996-08-23|title=McFarrin Well|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-08-23-ca-37028-story.html|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> [[University of Illinois Springfield]] (then known as Sangamon State University)<ref>{{Cite web|title=History and Traditions - About - UIS|url=https://www.uis.edu/about/history-traditions/|access-date=2020-10-21|website=www.uis.edu|language=en}}</ref> and the [[California State University, Sacramento]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-11-17|title=Cheryl North: Jeremy Denk, Bobby McFerrin: Two talented wits bring their music to San Francisco|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/11/17/cheryl-north-jeremy-denk-bobby-mcferrin-two-talented-wits-bring-their-music-to-san-francisco/|access-date=2020-10-21|website=The Mercury News|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Career==
McFerrin's first recorded work, the self-titled album ''[[Bobby McFerrin (album)|Bobby McFerrin]]'', was not produced until 1982, when McFerrin was already 31 years old. Before that, he had spent six years developing his musical style, the first two years of which he attempted not to listen to other singers at all, in order to avoid sounding like them. He was influenced by [[Keith Jarrett]], who had achieved great success with a series of solo improvised piano concerts including ''[[The Köln Concert]]'' of 1975, and wanted to attempt something similar vocally.<ref>[http://bobbymcferrin.com/bobby-projects/bobby-solo/ Bobby Solo], bobbymcferrin.com (official website)</ref>

In 1984, McFerrin performed onstage at the Playboy Jazz Festival in Los Angeles as a sixth member of [[Herbie Hancock]]'s VSOP II, sharing horn trio parts with the Marsalis brothers.

In 1986, McFerrin was the voice of Santa Bear in ''Santa Bear's First Christmas'', and in 1987 he was the voice of Santa Bear/Bully Bear in the sequel ''Santa Bear's High Flying Adventure''. On September 24 of that same year, he performed the theme song for the opening credits of Season 4 of ''[[The Cosby Show]]''.

In 1988, McFerrin recorded the song "[[Don't Worry, Be Happy]]", which became a hit and brought him widespread recognition across the world. The song's success "ended McFerrin's musical life as he had known it," and he began to pursue other musical possibilities on stage and in recording studios.<ref name=npr>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125725036&sc=fb&cc=fp Bobby McFerrin's Improv-Inspired 'Vocabularies']. NPR. Retrieved July 1, 2011.</ref> The song was used as the official campaign song for [[George H. W. Bush]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988 U.S. presidential election]], without Bobby McFerrin's permission or endorsement. In reaction, Bobby McFerrin publicly protested that use of his song, and stated that he was going to vote against Bush. He also dropped the song from his own performance repertoire.<ref name="Carl Anthony Online">[http://carlanthonyonline.com/2012/10/13/the-echo-dissonance-of-george-bushs-1988-campaign-music/ "The Echo & Dissonance of George Bush's 1988 Campaign Music"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114072834/http://carlanthonyonline.com/2012/10/13/the-echo-dissonance-of-george-bushs-1988-campaign-music/ |date=November 14, 2012 }}. Carl Anthony Online, October 13, 2012. Retrieved November 12, 2012.</ref>

At that time, he performed on the [[PBS]] TV special ''Sing Out America! with [[Judy Collins]]''. McFerrin sang a ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' medley during that television special.

In 1989, he composed and performed the music for the [[Pixar]] short film ''[[Knick Knack]]''. The rough cut to which McFerrin recorded his vocals had the words "blah blah blah" in place of the end credits (meant to indicate that he should [[improvise]]). McFerrin spontaneously decided to sing "blah blah blah" as lyrics, and the final version of the short film includes these lyrics during the end credits. Also in 1989, he formed a ten-person "Voicestra" which he featured on both his 1990 album ''Medicine Music'' and in the score to the 1989 Oscar-winning documentary ''[[Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt]]''.

Around 1992, an [[urban legend]] began that McFerrin had committed suicide; it has been speculated that the false story spread because people enjoyed the irony of a man known for the positive message of "Don't Worry, Be Happy" suffering from depression in real life.<ref name="Snopes">[http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/mcferrin.asp "Don't Worry, Be Dead"]. Snopes.com. Retrieved July 1, 2011.</ref>

In 1993, he sang [[Henry Mancini]]'s "[[The Pink Panther Theme|Pink Panther Theme]]" for the movie ''[[Son of the Pink Panther]]''.

[[File:Bobby McFerrin 1994.jpg|left|thumb|upright|McFerrin in 1994]]
In addition to his vocal performing career, in 1994, McFerrin was appointed as creative chair of the [[Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra]]. He makes regular tours as a guest conductor for symphony orchestras throughout the United States and Canada, including the [[San Francisco Symphony]] (on his 40th birthday), the [[New York Philharmonic]], the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]], the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] and many others. In McFerrin's concert appearances, he combines serious conducting of classical pieces with his own unique vocal improvisations, often with participation from the audience and the orchestra. For example, the concerts often end with McFerrin conducting the orchestra in an [[a cappella]] rendition of the "[[William Tell Overture]]," in which the orchestra members sing their musical parts in McFerrin's vocal style instead of playing their parts on their instruments.

For a few years in the late 1990s, he toured a concert version of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', partly in honor of his father, who sang the role for [[Sidney Poitier]] in the 1959 ''[[Porgy and Bess (film)|film version]]'', and partly "to preserve the score's jazziness" in the face of "largely white orchestras" who tend not "to play around the bar lines, to stretch and bend". McFerrin says that because of his father's work in the movie, "This music has been in my body for 40 years, probably longer than any other music."<ref>{{cite web|author=Cori Ellison|title='Porgy' and Music's Racial Politics|date=December 13, 1998|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/13/arts/music-porgy-and-music-s-racial-politics.html}}</ref>

McFerrin also participates in various music education programs and makes volunteer appearances as a guest music teacher and lecturer at public schools throughout the U.S. McFerrin has collaborated with his son, Taylor, on various musical ventures.

In July 2003, McFerrin was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from [[Berklee College of Music]] during the Umbria Jazz Festival where he conducted two days of clinics.<ref>{{cite web|author=Russell Carlson|url=https://jazztimes.com/news/berklee-honors-rollins-holds-summer-clinics/|title=Berklee Honors Rollins, Holds Summer Clinics|work= JazzTimes|date=June 21, 2003}}</ref>

In 2009, McFerrin and psychologist [[Daniel Levitin]] hosted ''The Music Instinct'', a two-hour documentary produced by [[PBS]] and based on Levitin's best-selling book ''[[This Is Your Brain on Music]]''. Later that year, the two appeared together on a panel at the [[World Science Festival]].

McFerrin was given a lifetime achievement award at the A Cappella Music Awards on May 19, 2018.

McFerrin was honored with the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award on August 20, 2020.

==Personal life==
He is the father of musicians [[Taylor McFerrin]] and [[Madison McFerrin]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Allen|first=Meaghan|date=2017-07-10|title=Madison McFerrin: a cappella with a twist|url=https://berkeleybside.com/madison-mcferrin-a-cappella-with-a-twist/|access-date=2021-05-09|website=B-Side|language=en-US}}</ref> and actor [[Jevon McFerrin]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Returning to Minnesota, Grammy-winner Bobby McFerrin gives first interview in 4 years|url=https://www.startribune.com/returning-to-minnesota-grammy-winner-bobby-mcferrin-gives-first-interview-in-4-years/485272621/|access-date=2021-05-09|website=Star Tribune}}</ref>

==Vocal technique==
As a vocalist, McFerrin often switches rapidly between [[Modal voice|modal]] and [[falsetto]] registers to create [[polyphonic]] effects, performing both the main [[melody]] and the accompanying parts of songs. He makes use of percussive effects created both with his mouth and by tapping on his chest. McFerrin is also capable of [[Overtone singing|multiphonic singing]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/12/arts/jazz-at-ritz-mcferrin.html |title=Jazz, at Ritz, McFerrin |date=December 12, 1984 |work=The New York Times }}</ref>

A document of McFerrin's approach to singing is his 1984 album ''[[The Voice (Bobby McFerrin album)|The Voice]]'', the first solo vocal jazz album recorded with no [[accompaniment]] or [[overdubbing]].<ref>Scott Yanow, [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r143475|pure_url=yes}} "Bobby McFerrin – The Voice"], AllMusic Review.</ref>
