'''36 Crazyfists''' are an American [[metalcore]] band formed in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] in 1994. The band's name comes from the Hong Kong film ''36 Crazy Fists''.<ref name="Show & Tell Online">{{cite web |title=Show & Tell Online - interview with Brock Lindow of 36 Crazyfists |author=Sisti, Scott |publisher=Show & Tell Online |url=http://www.showandtellonline.com/_36_crazyfists/_interview_051502.html |access-date=May 6, 2007 |date=May 15, 2002 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20061230145822/http://www.showandtellonline.com/_36_crazyfists/_interview_051502.html |archive-date=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To date they have released eight studio albums.

==History==
{{BLP sources section|date=November 2016}}
===Early years (1994-1999)===
36 Crazyfists formed in 1994 in [[Anchorage, Alaska]]. The original members were vocalist Brock Lindow, guitarists Steve Holt and Ryan Brownell, bassist JD Stuart, and drummer Thomas Noonan. Holt is from [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]], and Lindow spent much of his childhood there.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/445/story/158297.html|title=Burning love: Hot rock brotherhood expands, evolves in third year|last=Westfall|first=Kortnie|date=July 4, 2007|work=Anchorage Daily News|access-date=October 30, 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Lindow, Brownell, Stuart, and Noonan are all from Anchorage.

36CF originated from the remains of three local bands: Grin, Hessian, and Broke. JD Stuart played in Grin, Brock Lindow in Hessian, and Steve Holt and Ryan Brownell in Broke. One of the circumstances influencing the formation of 36CF was the murder of Broke's drummer Duane Monsen. On January 28, 1994, Broke played a set at the Underground bar in Anchorage. Later that night there was an altercation between Monsen and a drunken soldier who was stationed locally at [[Fort Richardson (Alaska)|Ft. Richardson]]. According to an article in the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'', Monsen tried to apologize and defuse the situation, but was fatally stabbed in the neck.<ref name="ancestry">{{cite web| url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi| title=Social Security Death Index| access-date=July 26, 2011}}{{Failed verification|date=October 2011}}</ref> He was 27 years old. In the wake of this tragedy, Monsen's friends organized a benefit concert to raise funds for his family. Monsen's protégé Thomas Noonan played the drums at this show and the musicians decided that they were an excellent match. In retrospect, it became the first 36CF performance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.drumsoloartist.com/Site/Drum_Publications/magazines/DrumPro/DrumPROMagazine2003_10.pdf| page=24| title=Interview with Thomas Noonan of 36 Crazyfists| last=Davis| first=Brian| date=October 2003| work=Drum Pro Magazine| access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref>

36CF released their first EP, ''Boss Buckle'', in 1995 on cassette. At that time the band's local popularity was rising quickly and the tape became a rarity, with the entire printing sold or given away as promos. On May 13, 1996, 36CF opened for [[Primus (band)|Primus]] at Egan Center in Anchorage. This concert was particularly interesting in a few ways. This was the one of the first times 36CF performed before an audience of thousands, though many locals were already familiar with the band's music. This was also the last show of Primus' Punchbowl tour and the last show for drummer Tim Alexander before his first hiatus from Primus.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://bullboard.prawnsong.com/showthread.php?t=63022| work=Underwater Gnome| title=The Bull Board, Primus 1996-05-13| access-date=December 24, 2017| archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708032504/http://bullboard.prawnsong.com/showthread.php?t=63022| archive-date=July 8, 2012| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

36CF were planning to relocate to [[Tacoma, Washington]], in search of professional recording contracts when another tragedy struck. On June 16, 1996, JD Stuart died in a car collision at age 23.<ref name="ancestry"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.genealogybank.com/gbnk/ssdi/?kwexc=&deathy_0=1996&deathy_1=1996&birthy_1=1973&ssstate=&ssnum=&statelast=&kwinc=&formDate=&nonusloc=&lname=Stuart&ziplast=&cntylast=&fname=J&citylast=&minit=&birthy_0=1973| title=J Stuart SSDI Records| access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref> This was a huge loss for the band because Stuart's musicianship and showmanship were a large part of the band's appeal. Nevertheless, the band persevered. At that time, Brownell retired from the band and the remaining members recruited bassist Mick Whitney, who is also from Anchorage. 36CF then relocated to the [[Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area]].

In 1997, the band released their second EP, ''Suffer Tree'', on cassette. Later that year they released their full-length debut CD, ''In the Skin''. They next relocated to [[Portland, Oregon]]. In 1999, they released a four-song demo that, through their friends in Skinlab, ended up in the hands of [[Monte Conner]], A&R rep at [[Roadrunner Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreepresents.com/index.php?section=bands&band=36_Crazyfists |title=Family Tree Presents |publisher=Family Tree Presents |access-date=May 7, 2010}}</ref> In an interview with ''AntiHero Magazine'', vocalist Brock Lindow states that the demo was produced by [[Steev Esquivel]] and Scott Sargeant of [[Skinlab]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiheromagazine.com/interview-36-crazyfists-brock-lindow/ |title=Interview: 36 Crazyfists – Brock Lindow |author=RaMar, Greg |publisher=AntiHero Magazine |date=April 10, 2015 |access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref>

===Roadrunner Records years (2000–2007)===
Signed by Roadrunner Records in 2000, the band recorded their major debut album ''[[Bitterness the Star]]'' which was released on April 4, 2002. In support of its release they toured with bands such as [[Candiria]], [[God Forbid]], [[Chimaira]], [[Diecast (band)|Diecast]], and Hotwire. After touring the [[United States]], they headed off to Europe to begin the European Road Rage Tour with [[Killswitch Engage]] and [[Five Pointe O]].

The band re-emerged two years later, on March 16, 2004 with their second album ''[[A Snow Capped Romance]]'' which was produced by James Paul Wisner (who also produced albums for bands like [[Dashboard Confessional]] and [[As Friends Rust]]). They toured intensely behind the record (playing shows with acts like Killswitch Engage and [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]]) through December, taking two months off before beginning the work on their next album.

36 Crazyfists entered the studio with producer [[Sal Villanueva]] (who had worked with [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]] and [[Taking Back Sunday]]) in October 2005 to commence recording their third album ''[[Rest Inside the Flames]]'', which was released across Europe on June 12, 2006. Ultimately, Roadrunner decided not to release the album in North America. A deal with [[DRT Entertainment]] was later struck, and the album received a belated release on November 7, 2006.

The album was a success in the UK, with ''Rest Inside the Flames'' debuting at No.&nbsp;71 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and reaching No.&nbsp;2 on the [[BBC]]'s Rock Albums chart. However, the album only sold 1,858 copies in the US during its first week of release.<ref>IndieHQ, [http://indiehq.com/2006/11/15/indepedent-sales-chart-11-15-06/ "Independent Sales Chart 11-15-06"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013145312/http://indiehq.com/2006/11/15/indepedent-sales-chart-11-15-06/ |date=October 13, 2007 }}, PostedNovember 15, 2006.</ref>

The band started an extensive UK tour, supported by [[Twelve Tribes (band)|Twelve Tribes]] and Your Rigamortus on April 1, 2007, where they played at 26 venues across the country.

===Ferret Music years (2007–2014)===
[[File:Brock and Mick from 36 Crazyfists.jpg|thumb|36 Crazyfists headlining the Summer Meltdown Festival in midtown Anchorage, July 2007]]
In May 2008 the band released ''[[The Tide and Its Takers]]'' on [[Ferret Music]]. They continue to play annually at the Summer Meltdown Festival in Anchorage, Alaska, except for 2008, when they were on tour with the first Annual Rockstar Mayhem Festival. Shortly after the Mayhem tour, bassist Mick Whitney left the band and was replaced by Brett Makowski.

36 Crazyfists filmed their show of January 9, 2009 in Anchorage, Alaska for their first live DVD, ''Underneath a Northern Sky'', released in October 2009.

The album ''[[Collisions and Castaways]]'' was released in the US by Ferret Music on July 27, 2010 and a day earlier in the rest of the world via [[Roadrunner Records]]. The album features guest appearances by [[Twelve Tribes (band)|Twelve Tribes]] frontman Adam Jackson (who also featured on their 2008 album ''The Tide and Its Takers''), Raithon Clay of Plans to Make Perfect, and Brandon Davis from Across the Sun.  Production duties for the album were handled by band guitarist Steve Holt and sport mixing from Andy Sneap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2010/05/21/news/36-crazyfists-reveal-title-and-track-listing-for-new-album|title=36 Crazyfists Reveal Title And Track Listing For New Album|author=wookubus|work=Theprp.com|date=May 21, 2010}}</ref>

The band played a variety of European festivals in June, including the UK Download Festival. 36 Crazyfists returned to the US in July to tour with [[Fear Factory]], After the Burial, [[Divine Heresy]], and Baptized in Blood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2010/05/21/news/fear-factory-announce-july-north-american-dates-with-36-crazyfists-after-the-burial-and-more/|title=Fear Factory Announce July North American Dates With 36 Crazyfists, After The Burial And More|author=wookubus|work=Theprp.com|date=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

In the UK the band resigned with Roadrunner Records. ''Collisions and Castaways'' was released a day earlier on July 26.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/page/News?&news_page=&news_id=94411%2F |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826052307/http://roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/page/News/?&news_page=&news_id=94411%2F |archive-date=August 26, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===''Time and Trauma,'' ''Lanterns'' and lineup changes (2014–2021)===
In May 2011, 36 Crazyfists confirmed they would be touring the UK starting on October 1 in Oxford and finishing the nine date tour in Birmingham on October 22. The tour was subsequently canceled due to family matters. 36 Crazyfists did, however, confirm that they have begun writing their next album. In 2012 the band announced the addition of drummer Kyle Baltus to the group's ranks after the departure of long time drummer, Thomas Noonan. In addition, the band was rejoined by bassist Mick Whitney following the departure of Brett "Buzzard" Makowski.

During the UK tour at the end of 2013, the band debuted the title track for their seventh studio album, ''Time and Trauma''. By mid-2014 the band had completed work on their new album for an early 2015 release. A listening party for the CD was held on July 24 at Pioneer Bar in Anchorage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/36-crazyfists-completes-work-on-time-and-trauma-album/|title=36 Crazyfists Completes Work On 'Time And Trauma' Album - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref> Their seventh studio album ''Time and Trauma'' was released on February 17, 2015 via [[Spinefarm Records]]. Spinefarm Records also released the single "Also Am I" on their SoundCloud page. 

On September 29, 2017, the band released their eighth studio album ''Lanterns'' on Spinefarm Records.

On March 19, 2021, Steven Holt posted on his personal [[Facebook]] profile in which he suggested that the band has disbanded. However, there has been no official confirmation, and less than two weeks prior, vocalist Brock Lindow confirmed that a new album was about half written.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-36-crazyfists-reportedly-break-up/|title = NEWS: 36 Crazyfists reportedly break up!|date = March 22, 2021}}</ref> However, a few weeks later, it was reported that the band was continuing without Lindow, though there was also no official confirmation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Kennelty|url=https://metalinjection.net/news/36-crazyfists-reportedly-planning-a-new-album-without-founding-vocalist|title=36 CRAZYFISTS Reportedly Planning A New Album Without Founding Vocalist|publisher=Metal Injection|access-date=April 13, 2021|date=April 10, 2021}}</ref>
