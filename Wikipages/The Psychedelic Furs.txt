'''The Psychedelic Furs''' are a British [[post-punk]] band founded in [[London]] in February 1977.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Led by singer [[Richard Butler (singer)|Richard Butler]] and his brother [[Tim Butler]] on [[bass guitar]], the Psychedelic Furs are one of the many acts spawned from the British [[post-punk]] scene. Their music went through several phases, from an initially austere [[art rock]] sound, to later touching on [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[hard rock]].<ref name=Maisey>{{cite web|url=http://veermag.com/2015/05/guitarist-john-ashton-talks-furs-satellite-paradiso|author=Maisey, Jeff|title=Guitarist John Ashton Talks Furs, Satellite Paradiso|date=18 May 2015|access-date=19 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413103316/http://veermag.com/2015/05/guitarist-john-ashton-talks-furs-satellite-paradiso/|archive-date=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The band had several hits in their early career. In 1986, filmmaker [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] used their song "[[Pretty in Pink (song)|Pretty in Pink]]" for his [[Pretty in Pink|film of the same name]]. They went on hiatus after they finished touring in 1992, but resumed in 2000 and continue to perform live. The band released ''[[Made of Rain]]'', their first studio album in nearly three decades, on 31 July 2020.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/psychedelic-furs-album-announcement-945298/|title=Psychedelic Furs Announce First New Album Since 1991, 'Made of Rain'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 31, 2020|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early days (1977–1980)===
Richard Butler stated that the Psychedelic Furs began rehearsing in his family's front room, but were soon banished because of the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/love-their-way/Content?oid=3795986|title=Love Their Way: The Psychedelic Furs will take the Rialto stage providing a look back on college rock memories|date=30 May 2013|author=Armstrong, Gene|access-date=19 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401005401/http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/love-their-way/Content?oid=3795986|archive-date=1 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The band was initially called RKO, then Radio. They later vacillated between calling themselves the Europeans and the Psychedelic Furs, playing gigs under both names before permanently settling on the latter.<ref name="Thompson, Dave 2004">{{cite book |author=Thompson, Dave|author-link1=Dave Thompson (author)|title=Beautiful Chaos|publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing|date=2004|ISBN=1-900924-47-1}}</ref> The word psychedelic was chosen to separate the band from [[punk rock]]ers who ostentatiously scorned the legacy of 1960s rock music.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Holdship |first=Bill |date=February 1983 |title=The Psychedelic Furs: Sugar Cubes For The New Depression |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/the-psychedelic-furs-sugar-cubes-for-the-new-depression |magazine=[[Creem]] |access-date=8 August 2019 |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

The band initially consisted of [[Richard Butler (singer)|Richard Butler]] (vocals), [[Tim Butler]] (bass guitar), Duncan Kilburn (saxophone), Paul Wilson (drums) and Roger Morris (guitars). By 1979, this line-up had expanded to a sextet with Vince Ely replacing Wilson on drums and [[John Ashton (musician)|John Ashton]] joining as a second guitarist.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The Psychedelic Furs' debut, a [[The Psychedelic Furs (album)|self-titled album]] released in March 1980, was produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]]. The album quickly established the band on radio in Europe and was a No. 18 hit in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The album also found success in Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Australia.

===Success (1981–1991)===
The Furs found success in the US with their next release, 1981's ''[[Talk Talk Talk]]'' which saw the band making its debut on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  In the UK, the album yielded two charting [[single (music)|singles]], "[[Dumb Waiters (song)|Dumb Waiters]]" and the original version of "[[Pretty in Pink (song)|Pretty in Pink]]". The latter song served as inspiration for the 1986 [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] [[Pretty in Pink|film of the same name]] and was re-recorded for the platinum-selling [[Pretty in Pink (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] - though Richard Butler was later adamant that the cinematic interpretation had very little to do with the song's original intent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/05128-the-psychedelic-furs-interview-talk-talk-talk/ |title=All Of This And Nothing: The Psychedelic Furs on 'Talk Talk Talk' |author=Ogg, Alex |date=20 Oct 2010 |work=The Quietus |access-date=10 May 2011 }}</ref>

In 1982, the band was reduced to a quartet with the departures of Morris and Kilburn, and moved to the U.S. in search of a producer.<ref>{{cite book

| year =2002}}</ref> The band recorded their next album, [[Forever Now (The Psychedelic Furs album)|''Forever Now'']], with [[record producer]] [[Todd Rundgren]] in [[Woodstock, New York]]. Released in September 1982, this album contained "[[Love My Way (song)|Love My Way]]", which became another UK chart entry, and also their first US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] single.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Ely left the band after ''Forever Now'' (though he would later return in 1988). The next album, ''Mirror Moves'' was produced by [[Keith Forsey]] (who also programmed the drums and became the band's drummer) and featured the songs "[[The Ghost in You]]" and "[[Heaven (The Psychedelic Furs song)|Heaven]]". Both charted in the UK and "Heaven" became the band's highest charting UK hit at the time, peaking at No. 29. [[Columbia Records]] opted for "Here Come Cowboys" for the corresponding US release which failed to chart but "The Ghost In You" was a hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In [[Canada]], "The Ghost In You" also charted. ''Mirror Moves'' became a Top 20 album on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]] and was named the No. 1 album of 1984 by [[Toronto]] new wave radio station [[CFNY-FM|CFNY]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritofradio.ca/|title=The CFNY Spirit Of Radio Fan Page|website=spiritofradio.ca|access-date=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111124824/http://www.spiritofradio.ca/|archive-date=11 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 
[[File:RButler.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard Butler (singer)|Richard Butler]] in 2006]]

By the mid-1980s, the band had become a staple on both US [[college radio]] and [[modern rock]] radio stations. Simultaneously, they were experiencing consistent mainstream success placing several singles in the charts on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Still, according to biographer [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]], they would "have more impact on future musicians than they ever did in the marketplace."<ref name="Thompson, Dave 2004"/>

In 1986, the band recorded a new version of "Pretty in Pink" for the soundtrack of the film of the same name. Released as a single, it became their biggest hit to date in the US and their biggest UK hit.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Butler later claimed that the success of "Pretty in Pink" caused the band to be pressured into entering the recording studio with producer [[Chris Kimsey]] to record a follow-up release before they were ready.<ref name=butler /> The result was ''Midnight to Midnight'', their biggest [[Top 40]] success to date, but an album that Richard Butler later characterized as "hollow, vapid and weak".<ref name=butler>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/from-forever-to-a-cosmic-joke/2006/06/18/1150569205950.html?page=fullpage|title=From forever to a cosmic joke|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 June 2006|access-date=12 September 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807060105/http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/from-forever-to-a-cosmic-joke/2006/06/18/1150569205950.html?page=fullpage|archive-date=7 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A more overtly commercial effort than their prior recordings, the album also featured the single "[[Heartbreak Beat]]", the Furs' biggest Top 40 hit in the US. The album also featured drummer Paul Garisto and saxophonist [[Mars Williams]], both of whom toured with the band.

In the wake of ''Midnight to Midnight'', Ely returned, and the Furs issued the single "[[All That Money Wants]]", a track recorded for the 1988 [[greatest hits|best-of]] [[compilation album]] ''[[All of This and Nothing]]''. 1989's ''[[Book of Days (The Psychedelic Furs album)|Book of Days]]'', produced by the band and [[David M. Allen]], featured the singles "Should God Forget" and "[[House (The Psychedelic Furs song)|House]]". Produced by the band and [[Stephen Street]], 1991's ''[[World Outside (album)|World Outside]]'' included the single "[[Until She Comes]]" and was the Furs' final studio album for more than two decades.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

"All That Money Wants" was a No. 1 hit in 1988, while "House" topped the chart in 1990 and "Until She Comes" was No. 1 in 1991.

===Hiatus and reunion (2000–present)===
[[File:TButler.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Tim Butler]] in 2006]]

The band took a long break in the early 1990s, with Richard and Tim Butler going on to found [[Love Spit Love]] with [[Richard Fortus]] and [[Frank Ferrer]] (both of whom would later join [[Guns N' Roses]]). In 2000, Richard Butler, Tim Butler and Ashton reformed the Psychedelic Furs. The touring lineup also included Fortus and later, Ferrer. They released a live album, ''Beautiful Chaos: Greatest Hits Live'' ,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-psychedelic-furs-mn0000418662/biography|title=The Psychedelic Furs biography|website=AllMusic|author=Ruhlmann, William|access-date=19 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160321121323/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-psychedelic-furs-mn0000418662/biography|archive-date=21 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> which included a new studio recording, "Alive (For Once in My Lifetime)".

The current Psychedelic Furs touring line-up includes Richard Butler, Tim Butler, Williams, [[Amanda Kramer]] and [[Rich Good]].

In 2017, the band's 1984 single "The Ghost in You" was featured in the second season of [[Netflix]] hit series ''[[Stranger Things]]'', and was included on the [[Sony Music]] soundtrack companion to the season, ''[[Music of Stranger Things#Stranger Things: Music from the Netflix Original Series|Stranger Things: Music from the Netflix Original Series]]'', released in October 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wabx.net/news/articles/2017/oct/27/new-stranger-things-soundtrack-features-classic-songs-by-the-police-the-clash-bon-jovi-and-more/|title=New "Stranger Things" soundtrack features classic songs by The Police, The Clash, Bon Jovi and more|first=Midwest Communications|last=Inc.|website=WABX 107.5|access-date=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406230440/http://wabx.net/news/articles/2017/oct/27/new-stranger-things-soundtrack-features-classic-songs-by-the-police-the-clash-bon-jovi-and-more/|archive-date=6 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> That same year, the band's 1982 single "Love My Way" was played several times in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated film ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me by Your Name]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/call-me-by-your-names-glorious-dance-floor-scene/549272/|title=The Hidden Meanings of the Dance-Floor Scene in 'Call Me by Your Name'|first=Brandon|last=Tensley|website=theatlantic.com|access-date=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408012512/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/call-me-by-your-names-glorious-dance-floor-scene/549272/|archive-date=8 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Psychedelic Furs released their eighth studio album ''[[Made of Rain]]'' on 31 July 2020 to positive reviews.

On March 1, 2021 the band released the official video for ''[[Made of Rain]]'''s fifth single "Wrong Train".  It premiered exclusively on NME.com and was inspired by Richard Butler's paintings. He starred in the video himself.

On September 1, 2021, two weeks before the Maid Of Rain Tour kicked-off, the band released a new single "Evergreen", from the "Made Of Rain" sessions. According to Richard Butler it's about “memory and the passing of time.”
