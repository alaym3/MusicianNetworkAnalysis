They are best known for the hit singles "[[Touch, Peel and Stand]]", "[[The Down Town]]", "[[Shelf in the Room]]", "[[Enemy (Days of the New song)|Enemy]]", as well as radio hits "Weapon and the Wound", "Hang On To This" and "Die Born".

The band was formed by Meeks as an acoustic solo project during his teenage years. The first album silently titled Yellow/Orange featured the line-up [[Jesse Vest]], [[Todd Whitener]] and [[Matt Taul]] before a mutual parting and later forming [[Tantric (band)|Tantric]]. It briefly included future pop star [[Nicole Scherzinger]] on the second album under the color of Green. Days of the New would later on succeeding releases include many hands, primarily accomplished drummer Ray Rizzo, former late [[Alice in Chains]] bassist [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]], and former [[Train (band)|Train]] bassist [[Charlie Colin]].

==History==

===Early years===
Days of the New began as an [[experimental rock]]/[[groove metal]] trio called '''Dead Reckoning''', with Meeks, Matt Taul, and [[Jesse Vest]]. When they turned to an acoustic sound, they changed the name of the band and added guitarist Todd Whitener.

A demo version of the song "Freak" appeared on the ''Harvest Showcase Volume 3'', a compilation of Louisville area artists. This recording features a solo performance by Meeks credited to Days of the New. Jesse Vest and Matt Taul are listed as band members in the liner notes although they do not appear on this recording.

Producer [[Scott Litt]] signed the band after their third live show.

===1996-1998===
The band recorded their [[Days of the New (1997 album)|debut album]] at Allen Martin Productions in Louisville, KY in October and November 1996. The first Days of the New release, an eponymous album frequently called "Orange" or "Yellow" after the color of the disc and liner notes, was released in 1997, selling 1.5 million copies worldwide. Three songs from this album were hits: "[[Touch, Peel and Stand]]," "[[The Down Town]]," and "[[Shelf in the Room]]." The first was No.&nbsp;1 on Billboard's Rock Chart for 17 weeks; "[[The Down Town]]" and "[[Shelf in the Room]]" were each top 40 hits.

They contributed the song "Running Knees" to ''[[Godzilla: The Album]]''.

Internal problems of the band were evident early on. Shortly after releasing their debut album, Days of the New began touring for small shows. [[MTV]] reported that, after missing a Florida concert in April, the band members appeared physically black-eyed and beaten the following day after what sources claimed to be a band brawl. They then toured with [[Metallica]] and [[Jerry Cantrell]] starting in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], [[Florida]] on June 24, 1998. Meeks later criticized this billing, stating that, due to their acoustic sound, Days of the New should have toured with a group like [[Dave Matthews Band]].

Just before starting this summer tour, however, Meeks had already told interviewers that all of his fellow band members were holding him back and, consequently, were being released from the group. He also said that they were disappointed by this decision but that he thought they would remain friends. An Outpost spokesperson, however, claimed that "Travis just talks" and that nothing was official.  Before they could fulfill club touring duties with [[Finger Eleven]] and Flight 16 in December, without citing reason, Meeks canceled in early November. Various explanations were given by band members and a label spokesperson including poor tour scheduling, band fighting, and even Meeks being physically ill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427903/19981110/days_of_the_new.jhtml |title=Days Of The New Cancel Tour - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=November 10, 1998 |access-date=November 6, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402091743/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427903/19981110/days_of_the_new.jhtml |archive-date=April 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was finally confirmed in February 1999 that the band indeed split up. Todd Whitener, Matt Taul, and Jesse Vest would go on to form C14, soon renamed [[Tantric (band)|Tantric]], while Meeks formed a new band under the Days of the New name.

There are two contradictory explanations of the original Days of the New breakup. Comments by Meeks in 1998 lead to reports that he fired the rest of the band. Meeks has called this telling false and claims the other band members were jealous that he was paid more than they were. When Meeks first announced the news, he said "It's like a journey in the wilderness - you know with like the struggle and stuff. I made it through, I survived, but the other guys didn't." He also posted comments online: "It wasn't truly a band format. It is my fault for leading you on and setting you up to get attached to the prior members."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427904/19980825/days_of_the_new.jhtml |title=Days of the New Continue to Confuse - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=August 25, 1998 |access-date=November 6, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402091757/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427904/19980825/days_of_the_new.jhtml |archive-date=April 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Later, in 2002, Meeks called in to [[The Howard Stern Show]] and was asked by Stern why he didn't stick with the original members. He replied, "They had no spirituality. They had no brains." When Stern pointed out, "They had hits!" he gave the vague response, "That's not what I'm into. I'm into the truth."<ref>{{citation|url=http://marksfriggin.com/news02/4-29.htm|title=MarksFriggin.com - Stern Show Archives For The Week Of 4/29/2002 to 5/3/2002}}</ref>

===1999-2001===
Shortly after the original band's breakup, Meeks recorded a second album, ''[[Days of the New (1999 album)|Days of the New]]''. The album was released on August 31, 1999. Meeks debuted his new band on September 4, 1999 at the [[ear X-tacy]] store in Louisville. Critics were fairly enthusiastic about the album but it sold poorly compared to the previous effort.

In February 2000, Meeks returned to the studio with a new band and recorded their third album as Days of the New by July. Like the first two records, [[Days of the New III|the album]] is self-titled. The first single, "Hang on to This" peaked at No.&nbsp;18 on the US Rock Chart<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/days-of-the-new-iii-r553076/charts-awards |title=Days of the New III - Days of the New : Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=September 25, 2001 |access-date=November 6, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219045345/http://allmusic.com/album/days-of-the-new-iii-r553076/charts-awards |archive-date=February 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and was the most added song on rock radio the week of its debut. The album, released two weeks after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] with very little promotion, sold 90,000 copies. Days of the New toured with [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[3 Doors Down]]. Meanwhile, Meeks's original bandmates formed the band [[Tantric (band)|Tantric]], whose debut [[Tantric (album)|self-titled debut]] went platinum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/tantric/news/artist-name-days-of-the-new-id-1031018-pulls-out-of-atlanta-fest-due-to-tantric--12026480 |title=Tantric News - Yahoo! Music |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |access-date=November 6, 2012}}</ref>

===2002–present===
After touring for "Red," the band parted ways with Interscope and had a period of inactivity. In December 2002, Meeks was involved in a high-profile audition for [[Velvet Revolver]] with several former members of [[Guns N' Roses]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=8101 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - DAYS OF THE NEW Frontman Collaborates With Former GUNS N' ROSES Members |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=November 6, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828193547/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=8101 |archive-date=August 28, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the later half of 2003, Meeks embarked on a solo tour, performing at small venues. His addiction to [[methamphetamine]] continued and in early 2005, he appeared on [[A&E (TV network)|A&E's]] ''[[Intervention (TV series)|Intervention]]'', where family and friends convinced him to enter rehab.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1499835/50-cent-game-team-up-charity-again.jhtml |title=For The Record: Quick News On 50 Cent And Game, Ashanti, Kelly Clarkson, Shakira, Paris Hilton, Pennywise & More - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=April 8, 2005 |access-date=November 6, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107150040/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1499835/50-cent-game-team-up-charity-again.jhtml |archive-date=November 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In September 2005, Meeks announced he had achieved sobriety and was writing for a fourth Days of the New record.

On March 4, 2008, [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] released ''[[Days of the New: The Definitive Collection]]'', the first compilation of the band. Meeks stated that the upcoming record will be called ''Days of the New Presents Tree Colors''.<ref name="LEO Weekly">{{cite web|last=Herron |first=Mat |url=http://leoweekly.com/?q=node/7333 |title='You're talking to a miracle' &#124; Louisville's Alt-Weekly |publisher=LEO Weekly |date=July 15, 2008 |access-date=November 6, 2012}}</ref>

In 2010, [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]] of [[Alice in Chains]] began playing with Meeks, preparing for a tour that would also feature [[Charlie Colin]] of [[Train (band)|Train]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grungereport.net/?p=3876 |title=90's Alternative Rock News » Blog Archive » EXCLUSIVE NEW DETAILS ABOUT MIKE STARR'S DEATH |publisher=GrungeReport.net |date=April 2, 2011 |access-date=November 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327140721/http://grungereport.net/?p=3876 |archive-date=March 27, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> However, Starr died on March 8, 2011, before touring had begun.<ref>{{cite web |last=Downey |first=Ryan J. |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1659474/alice-in-chains-mike-starr-dead.jhtml |title=Ex-Alice In Chains Bassist Mike Starr Found Dead - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=March 8, 2011 |access-date=November 6, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107150003/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1659474/alice-in-chains-mike-starr-dead.jhtml |archive-date=November 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2014, the original lineup of Days of the New announced they had reunited and were planning a summer tour called "Full Circle."
On May 30, 2014, Days of the New announced plans to release an EP with new material that fall.

Following a cancelled date in [[Columbia, Missouri]], the band abruptly ended their set in [[St. Louis]] on September 6 due to Meeks being too [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] to perform. Bassist Jesse Vest took the microphone to inform the crowd that it was the band's last show together. In the next several days, the band released several statements on Facebook claiming they'd reunited with Meeks because, after he'd unsuccessfully tried to recruit other musicians, he'd begged them to return.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/days-of-the-new-announce-breakup-onstage-band-future-in-doubt/?trackback=tsmclip |title=Days of the New Announce Breakup Onstage During Concert |publisher=loudwire.com |date=September 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055641/http://loudwire.com/days-of-the-new-announce-breakup-onstage-band-future-in-doubt/?trackback=tsmclip |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On September 26, 2014, the band announced on Facebook that they again would be going their separate ways with Meeks retaining the Days of the New name. Meeks put a new lineup together and continued touring but was arrested in Portland, Maine on October 10, 2014 on a warrant for failure to appear in court to answer charges of possessing a hypodermic needle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/days-of-the-new-travis-meeks-criminal-most-wanted-list-missing-court-date/|title=Days of the New's Travis Meeks on Criminal Most Wanted List|website=Loudwire|access-date=April 10, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420222450/http://loudwire.com/days-of-the-new-travis-meeks-criminal-most-wanted-list-missing-court-date/|archive-date=April 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In April 2017, Meeks had been released from jail and was posting on social media.<ref>[http://www.alternativenation.net/days-news-travis-meeks-debuts-surprising-new-look-jail-stint/ Days of the New’s Travis Meeks Debuts Surprising New Look After Jail Stint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225091952/http://www.alternativenation.net/days-news-travis-meeks-debuts-surprising-new-look-jail-stint/ |date=December 25, 2017 }}. Alternative Nation, April 15, 2017.</ref>

In August 2018, after a four-year hiatus, Meeks played a solo show at the Red Bicycle Hall in [[Madison, Indiana]].

On March 3rd 2021, an unofficial bootleg compilation of some of Days of the New's rarer tracks, entitled 'The Gift', was released illegally without the consent of the band or previous record label. 911 Entertainment Records have since confirmed this was wrong and pulled the release from all streaming platforms, effective immediately.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=921443525064022&set=p.921443525064022&type=3] 911 Entertainment Records issue an apology and have pulled the bootleg album they compiled from streaming platforms.</ref>

On 26th July 2021, an apparently new studio album, 'Illusion Is Now' appeared on Spotify, YouTube and iTunes via label 911 Entertainment Records. That it appeared without any accompanying publicity led to early speculation on Reddit's /r/grunge channel that this could be a repeat of the debacle earlier in the year where an album was released inappropriately and withdrawn just days later.
