==History==
===Formation (2016)===
Josh Price, Matt Boggis and Eamon Sandwith met in music class at St. Teresa's Catholic College in Noosa, Queensland. When they were 17, in September 2016, they formed the Chats, with Price on guitar, Boggis on drums, and Sandwidth on bass and vocals. Former member Tremayne McCarthy also played bass and guitar in the original lineup.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/chats-0|title=THE CHATS|website=triple j Unearthed|language=en|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> The band takes its name from the phrase "that's chat" - (Australian slang to describe something terrible).

Their debut self-titled EP, recorded at their high school, was released on 7 November 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thechatslovebeer.bandcamp.com/album/the-chats-ep|title=The Chats EP {{!}} The Chats|website=BandCamp|date=7 November 2016|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> [[Triple J]] described the EP as "seven joyous sky-punching tracks that combined 60s garage punk and 70s new wave punk".<ref name=":0" />

=== ''Get This in Ya!!'' (2017) ===
[[File:TheChats2017.jpg|thumb|Bassist Eamon Sandwith performing live with the Chats in 2017]]
Their second EP, ''Get This in Ya!!'' was released on 31 July 2017, "another thrilling seven-song slice of economic, stripped-down, early [[Buzzcocks]]-styles punk tension".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1910/S00045/the-chats-identity-theft-tour-nz-supports-announced.htm|title=The Chats 'Identity Theft' Tour NZ Supports Announced {{!}} The Chats|website=scoop.co.nz|date=3 October 2019|accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=":0"/> It was tracked/recorded at Eleven PM Studios in Nambour, Queensland, Australia, by Finn Wegener and Michael Currie on 24 June 2017. Former member, Tremayne McCarthy, actually played bass on the "Smoko" track and spoke the line "Is it Smoko?". Michael Currie was the producer and decided that the best way to record the band was all in the same room together live.  Only very minimal overdubbing was done. It was then mixed and mastered by Michael Currie at his Polished Turd Studios in Brisbane, Australia. The music video for the track "Smoko", filmed with no budget at a building site, was directed by Matisse Langbein, who also did the cover art for the EP, and was released on the 3rd of October, quickly becoming a viral hit and drawing attention from popular rock musicians [[Dave Grohl]], [[Josh Homme]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Alex Turner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58V2vC9EPc|title=THE CHATS - SMOKO (OFFICIAL VIDEO)|author=The Chats|date=3 October 2017|accessdate=27 July 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-07-12|title=Dave Grohl, Alex Turner & Josh Homme Went To The Chats' Gig & There's Receipts To Prove It|url=https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/dave-grohl-alex-turner-josh-homme-went-to-the-chats-gig-theres-receipts-to-prove-it/|access-date=2021-03-15|website=Music Feeds}}</ref> Triple J argued that the song "was an instant classic of a youth anthem on a par with '[[You Really Got Me]]', '[[My Generation]]' or '[[Teenage Kicks]]'".<ref name=":0"/>

===Universal deal and ''High Risk Behaviour'' (2018–present)===
On 3 July 2018, the Chats released the single "Do What I Want", announced to be included in their forthcoming studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/au/album/do-what-i-want-single/1406719164|title=Do What I Want - Single by The Chats|website=Apple Music|date=3 July 2018|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://airit.org.au/The-Chats-Do-What-I-Want.html|title=The Chats - Do What I Want|website=Amrap's AirIt|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref>

In late December 2019, Sandwith posted a song criticizing Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]] for his perceived apathy and carelessness towards the [[2019–20 Australian bushfire season|2019-20 bushfire crisis]] to Instagram, titled 'I Hope Scott's House Burns Down'; according to Pedestrian.tv, the song is being used to aid fundraising efforts for numerous volunteer firefighter groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/the-chats-premiere-new-little-ditty-i-hope-scotts-house-burns-down-on-social-media/|title=The Chats Premiere New Little Ditty 'I Hope Scott's House Burns Down' On Social Media|date=2019-12-24|website=Music Feeds|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> The band debuted the song "The Clap" on 17 January 2020 and revealed the name of their debut studio album, ''[[High Risk Behaviour]]'', as well as a release date of 27 March 2020. Weeks before its release, the band released a music video for the album track "Dine & Dash".<ref>{{Citation|title=The Chats – Dine N Dash (Official Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3jAJHRW_Yo|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>

On 8 November 2020, the band released their next single, "AC/DC CD", a tribute to the Australian band [[AC/DC]]. Guitarist Josh "Pricey" Price was not featured in the song’s music video, while potential new member Josh Hardy of Australian band the Unknowns was, leading to online speculation of his departure from the band. In December 2020, the band officially confirmed Price’s departure and announced Hardy as his replacement.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Newstead|first=Al|date=2020-12-02|title=The Chats announce new line-up after guitarist departs band|url=https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/the-chats-guitarist-josh-pricey-price-departs-band-new-lineup/12941576|access-date=2020-12-02|website=triple j|language=en}}</ref>

On 10 September 2021, the band released a cover of [[Metallica|Metallica’s]] “Holier Than Thou” for the charity tribute album ''[[The Metallica Blacklist]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Metallica Blacklist: 53 Unique Artists {{!}} Metallica.com|url=https://www.metallica.com/news/2021-06-22-the-metallica-blacklist.html|access-date=2021-09-14|website=www.metallica.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
The band coined the term "shed rock" to describe their sound, and their self-contained approach has been likened to that of [[King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard]].<ref name=":0"/> They cited Australian bands [[Cosmic Psychos]], [[Dune Rats]] and [[Eddy Current Suppression Ring]] as major influences.<ref name=rb/>
