'''Broadcast''' were an English [[electronic music|electronic]] band formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1995 by [[Trish Keenan]] (vocals, keyboards, guitar) and James Cargill (bass). Their musical style blended elements of 1960s American [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] with experimental [[electronica]], incorporating [[sampling (music)|samples]] from various sources, and earned the band a [[cult following]].<ref name=lentz>{{cite book |title=Obituaries in the Performing Arts, 2011 |last=Lentz III |first=Harris M. |publisher=McFarland |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-7864-9134-6 |page=179}}</ref>

Broadcast released three studio albums—''[[The Noise Made by People]]'' (2000), ''[[Haha Sound]]'' (2003), and ''[[Tender Buttons (album)|Tender Buttons]]'' (2005)—as well as several EPs and a collaboration album with [[the Focus Group]] titled ''[[Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age]]'' (2009). Their most recent release is the soundtrack album ''[[Berberian Sound Studio (soundtrack)|Berberian Sound Studio]]'' (2013).

Aside from founding members Keenan and Cargill, Broadcast has experienced regular lineup changes. The band has included Roj Stevens (keyboards), Tim Felton (guitar), and Steve Perkins (drums). [[Keith York]], Phil Jenkins, [[Jeremy Barnes]], Neil Bullock and Ash Sheehan have also featured in the band as touring or session drummers. As of 2005, Broadcast consisted only of the founding duo. Following the death of Keenan in 2011, Cargill remained the only member.

==History==
===1995–1999: Formation===
Keenan (formerly of folk duo Hayward Winters) and Cargill met in the mid 1990s at the Sensateria psychedelic club, and formed Pan Am Flight Bag in 1995, renamed Broadcast after several concerts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/trish-keenan-singer-who-made-beguiling-bewitching-music-with-the-experimental-band-broadcast-2189035.html|title=Trish Keenan: Singer who made beguiling, bewitching music with the experimental band Broadcast|date=20 January 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>

The band's first release in 1996, was the 7" single "Accidentals" (issued on Wurlitzer Jukebox Records), which was written based around a [[sampling (music)|sample]] from [[Joseph Losey]]’s 1967 film ''[[Accident (1967 film)|Accident]]''.<ref name=jones/> The same year, they released ''The Book Lovers'' EP (issued in November by [[Duophonic Records]]).<ref>{{cite web|work=AllMusic|title=The Book Lovers - Broadcast|access-date=15 January 2018|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-book-lovers-mw0001887046}}</ref>
In 1996, the band recorded a Peel Session.

[[Warp (record label)|Warp]] released a compilation album, ''[[Work and Non Work (album)|Work and Non Work]]'', in June 1997, compiling the EP and two singles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/work%20and%20non%20work/|title=WORK AND NON WORK : BROADCAST|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=8 September 2017}}</ref> The 1999 Broadcast track "You Can Fall" was included on the soundtrack album for the film ''[[Morvern Callar (film)|Morvern Callar]]'', released by Warp in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/morvern-callar-original-soundtrack-mw0000592653|title=Morvern Callar [Original Soundtrack] - Original Soundtrack {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>

===2000–2010: Studio albums===
The group's debut studio album, ''[[The Noise Made by People]]'', was released by Warp in March 2000. It was self-produced in the group's own recording studio after having been through three producers to get a particular sound.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EoowCBYogmUC|title=Original Emotional Soundtrack|last=Konig|first=Bill|date=2000-05-22|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=61|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCoEAAAAMBAJ&q=broadcast+trish+keenan&pg=PA43|title=Cinematic For The People|last=Wyatt|first=Kieran|date=April 2000|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=43|language=en}}</ref> Regarding the expensive two year production of the album, Keenan said, "There [were] no financial benefits in getting it right."<ref name=":0" /> The band issued two EPs in the same year, ''Extended Play'' and ''[[Extended Play Two]]''.

Their second album, ''[[Haha Sound]]'', was released in August 2003, preceded by two EPs, ''[[Microtronics Volume 01|Microtronics Volume 01: Stereo Recorded Music for Links and Bridges]]'' and ''[[Pendulum (Broadcast album)|Pendulum]]''. Recording sessions for the album took place in fragments at various locations: Keenan recorded vocal tracks with her head in a cardboard box which gave it a "closeness and deadness that makes it sit in the mix a bit nicer," while drummer Bullock recorded drum tracks in a neighborhood church before overdubbing guitar tracks and additional arrangements.<ref name="emusician">{{cite web|url=https://www.emusician.com/gear/broadcast|work=Electronic Musician|title=BROADCAST|author=Micallef, Ken|date=1 August 2003|access-date=22 December 2017}}</ref> ''Haha Sound'' became their first charting album in the United States, reaching No. 8 in the [[Top Dance/Electronic Albums]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/broadcast/chart-history/dance-electronic-albums/song/440670|title=Broadcast Haha Sound Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-02-07}}</ref> While touring the United States to promote ''Haha Sound'', the group recruited American drummer [[Jeremy Barnes]] to perform their live shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisenarcs.com/2011/03/08/talknarc-interview-hawk-hacksaws-jeremy-barnes/|date=8 March 2011|title=TalkNarc: Interview with A Hawk and a Hacksaw's Jeremy Barnes|access-date=23 December 2017|work=NoiseNarcs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theleaflabel.com/en/releases/view/129/a%20hawk%20and%20a%20hacksaw/the%20way%20the%20wind%20blows/bay%2051cd|work=The Leaf Label|title=The Way the Wind Blows|access-date=2 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820051350/http://www.theleaflabel.com/en/releases/view/129/a%20hawk%20and%20a%20hacksaw/the%20way%20the%20wind%20blows/bay%2051cd|archive-date=20 August 2012}}</ref> Felton departed after ''Haha Sound'' to form a new project, Seeland, with touring keyboardist Billy Bainbridge (formerly of fellow Birmingham Warp act, [[Plone (band)|Plone]]).

Broadcast's next album, ''[[Tender Buttons (album)|Tender Buttons]]'', was issued in September 2005. It was their first album as a duo of Keenan and Cargill. On tour they were joined by Ash Sheehan on drums and James’s brother Bill on guitar and keyboards. A second compilation of B-sides and rarities, ''[[The Future Crayon]]'', was issued in August 2006.

Broadcast released a collaborative album with [[the Focus Group]] (aka graphic designer and [[Ghost Box]] label co-owner [[Julian House]]) called ''[[Broadcast and the Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age]]'' in October 2009. The band was chosen by [[Matt Groening]] to perform at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival he curated in May 2010 in [[Minehead]], [[Somerset, England]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atpfestival.com/events/news/1004291436|title=Stage Times for ATP curated by Matt Groening - updated with DJs - All Tomorrow's Parties|website=All Tomorrow's Parties|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>

===2011–2013: Keenan's death and ''Berberian Sound Studio''===
Keenan died on 14 January 2011 at the age of 42, following complications with pneumonia, which she suffered from after earlier contracting [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://warp.net/news/a-statement/ |title=Broadcast: A Statement |website=[[Warp (record label)|Warp]] |date=14 January 2011 |access-date=24 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/54570 |title=Broadcast's Trish Keenan dies after contracting pneumonia |first=Adam |last=Bychawski |work=[[NME]] |date=14 January 2011 |access-date=24 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/14/broadcast-singer-hospitalised|title=Broadcast singer Trish Keenan dies after suffering pneumonia &#124; Music|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|last1=Griffiths|last2=Goff|first1=Ian J|first2=Daffyd|date=14 January 2011|access-date=25 August 2014}}</ref> Cargill, the sole remaining member, said in a 2011 interview with ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'' that a new Broadcast album was in the works, featuring vocals recorded by Keenan shortly before her death.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Everhart|first=John|date=23 November 2011|title=James Cargill Working on New Broadcast Album with Trish Keenan Vocals Recorded Before Her Passing|url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/news/james_cargill_working_on_new_broadcast_album_with_trish_Keenan_vocals/|journal=[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under The Radar]]|access-date=12 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/news/44733-broadcast-working-on-new-album/|title=Broadcast Working on New Album|date=28 November 2011|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=12 January 2013}}</ref> He later said: "Trish left a lot of tapes, four-tracks and stuff, and I’ve been going through those. It’s difficult, and I’m connected to it at the same time. It’s wonderful, but I’m also feeling a sense of loss. The next thing I release with Trish on it will be more like a monument and a tribute to her rather than this obsessive thing I used to have about making albums."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/broadcast-1272609|title=Broadcast to make Trish Keenan tribute album|date=24 November 2011|work=NME|access-date=10 January 2018}}</ref> {{As of|2021|post=,}} however, the album has not been released.

===Musical style===
''[[Fact (UK magazine)|FACT]]'' described Broadcast's music as blending "pop songcraft and experimentally-minded [[electronic music]] into a contemporary blend of [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]] that resonated deeply with listeners".<ref name="auto">{{cite web |last1=IQ Jones |first1=Mikey |title=The Essential...

Other recurrent elements in the band's music (particularly their first two albums) were "science fiction" atmospheres and "skewed variants" of [[swing music|swing]] and [[jazz]] music, which "offered a Eurocentric counterpoint to the mostly American psych innovators they’d imbibed."<ref name=jones/> In a review published in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 2001, the band were likened to being "stuck in a time warp–the sound of '70s wife-swapping parties with beanbags and unhappy children serving sausages on sticks."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|title=Reviews: Broadcast|page=197|volume=17|issue=1–4|publisher=Spin Media, LLC}}</ref>

===Equipment===
The band's recording gear and methods were profiled in a 2003 article in ''[[Electronic Musician]]'', in which it was noted that they recorded many of their guitar arrangements (played at that time on a 1960s Italian [[Eko guitars|Eko]] Edsel) through microphones, rather than through a [[DI unit]].<ref name=emusician/>
Additional instruments, including the [[vibraphone]], [[timpani]], clarinets and organ were recorded and subsequently fed through a speaker again in order to be re-recorded with microphones.<ref name=emusician/> Their private studio setup included an [[AKG Acoustics|AKG BX-15]], a [[Fostex]] rackmount coil reverb amplifier and an Acutronics tray (originally sourced from a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] amplifier.)<ref name=emusician/> Their recording setup also included a [[Mark of the Unicorn|MOTU]] 2408 hard-disk recording system, an [[PowerPC G4|Apple Mac G4]], a [[Fender Rhodes]], a [[Vox Continental]] and a [[Korg MS-20]].<ref name=emusician/>

For digital production, the band sometimes used an reFX QuadraSid emulator and [[Reaktor|Native Instruments Reaktor]].<ref name=emusician/> Commenting on the production of their third album, ''Haha Sound'', Keenan said: "You know when it feels overworked. We used more of a minimalist approach on this album: There has been less emphasis on decoration and more on repetitive parts that go through the tracks. They are not the focus for your ear, but they are the foundation."<ref name=emusician/>

===Live performances===
Keenan suffered from stage fright in Broadcast's early days, and earned a reputation for a "[[shoegazing]] onstage introversion."<ref name=option>{{cite journal|journal=[[Option (music magazine)|Option]]|issue=78–81|page=24|title=Broadcast|year=1998|publisher=Sonic Options Network}}</ref> "I used to get nervous like the whole of that day of the show, and now it only happens the moment I walk onstage," she later said in a 1998 interview. "When you listen to me sing my first line, you can always tell my heart is in my throat. Headlining gigs is a confidence booster."<ref name=option/>
