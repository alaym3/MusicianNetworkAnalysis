==Career==
===1998–2002: Early career to debut studio album===
Before launching his solo career, Rudd began playing music as part of the band 'Xavier and the Hum'. He drew inspiration from artists such as [[Leo Kottke]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Natalie Merchant]] and multi-instrumentalist [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], as well as music from diverse sources such as Hawaiian and Native American music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sortmusic.com/_x/xavier-rudd-biography,len.html |title=Xavier Rudd Biography |website=Sortmusic.com |access-date=4 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Rudd found doing what he loves|url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/story.html?id=3f47ba78-ab4c-4ddd-a007-5215252a0dca|first=Tom|last=Harrison|work=[[The Province]]|date=1 June 2006|access-date=3 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103094801/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/story.html?id=3f47ba78-ab4c-4ddd-a007-5215252a0dca|archive-date=3 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> His music first took him overseas when he traveled to [[Whistler, British Columbia]]—Rudd was in a band and would play each night after a day of snowboarding.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.geckosadventures.com/tales/xavier-rudd-inspiration/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616104803/http://www.geckosadventures.com/tales/xavier-rudd-inspiration/|archive-date=16 June 2015|newspaper=Geckos Adventures|title=Xavier Rudd talks travel, inspiration and what makes a 'real' journey}}</ref>

Rudd was in Canada when the [[September 11 attacks]] happened.<ref name=Gottehrer/> Rudd felt "spun out" watching the American media coverage, including graphic imagery of the destruction of the World Trade Center. Rudd wrote the song ''12 September'', which would feature on his first studio album ''To Let'', about the day after the attacks. In 2006, discussing the song, Rudd said: {{quote| That's what the song's about, the world waiting. All of a sudden there was an attack and there was these people who were equally as toxic that were going to retaliate. No one could really do anything about it. It's about the next day and that's why I called it the 12th of September.<ref name=Gottehrer/>}}

===2003–05: ''Solace'' to ''Food in the Belly''===
[[File:Xavier Rudd.jpg|thumb|right]]In 2004, Rudd released ''Solace'', his first album to be distributed by a major label—[[Universal Music Australia]]. Rather than inviting guest artists to join him on the record, Rudd performed all the instrumentation for the album alone with only a few overdubs. Instruments included [[didgeridoos]], slide guitars, stomp boxes, djembe drums, slit drums, and the harmonica.<ref name=Lobley/> In his live show, Rudd came to be renowned for his 'one-man band' performances.<ref name=Ridley>{{citation|url=http://thedwarf.com.au/interview/xavier-rudd-band-in-one-man|date=19 October 2005|title=Xavier Rudd – Band in one man|first=Dan|last=Ridley|publisher=The Dwarf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202125730/http://thedwarf.com.au/interview/xavier-rudd-band-in-one-man|archive-date=2 February 2016}}</ref>

===2007: ''White Moth''===
The song ''White Moth'' was written about a moth that followed Rudd's son Joaquin for several hours on his mother's 30th birthday. Rudd thought it was the spirit of his then wife's grandmother.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fasterlouder.junkee.com/white-moths-and-aboriginal-spirits-an-interview-with-xavier-rudd/788531|first=Nicole|last=Summers|date=16 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204075034/http://fasterlouder.junkee.com/white-moths-and-aboriginal-spirits-an-interview-with-xavier-rudd/788531|archive-date=4 February 2016|title=White Moths and Aboriginal spirits: An interview with Xavier Rudd|publisher=Faster Louder}}</ref> Rudd and his family were holidaying to celebrate the occasion on an island off Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/rudd-sings-for-rights/2007/05/29/1180205207581.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|newspaper=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=29 May 2007|title=Rudd sings for rights|archive-date=23 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223123028/http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/rudd-sings-for-rights/2007/05/29/1180205207581.html?page=fullpage|agency=AAP}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://3degree.ecu.edu.au/articles/1355|title=White Moth: Xavier Rudd's spiritual journey|first=Anish|last=Karki|date=2 November 2007|publisher=Edith Cowan University|work=3rd Degree|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305015008/http://3degree.ecu.edu.au/articles/1355|archive-date=5 March 2011}}</ref>

===2008–11: From ''Dark Shades of Blue'' to collaboration with Izintaba===
''Black Water'' the first track on Rudd's 2008 album ''Dark Shades of Blue'' was named after one of Lutken-Rudd's paintings.<ref name=Murfett/> The album saw Rudd introduce a heavier sound, using electric guitars in place of acoustic guitars and creating darker more somber tones.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/xavier-rudd-dark-shades-of-blue/|first=Dan|last=Raper|title=Xavier Rudd: Dark Shades of Blue|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202122304/http://www.popmatters.com/review/xavier-rudd-dark-shades-of-blue/|archive-date=2 February 2016|date=18 August 2008|website=Popmatters.com}}</ref> He recorded with [[Dave Tolley]], a percussionist drummer, who he had previously collaborated with for ''White Moth'' and ''Food in the Belly''.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/media/s2884954.htm|title=Xavier Rudd says it's time to smile with his new album Koonyum Sun|date=28 April 2010|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=3 February 2016}}</ref>

Reflecting on ''Dark Shades of Blue'', Rudd told media he felt the heavier sound was a "precursor for things that might come... I feel like my music is ahead of me all the time.<ref name=Wildsmith/> Rudd was referring to his and Lutken's divorce, which was finalised in 2009.

After the failure of his marriage, Rudd was supported in his grief and recovery by new South African bandmates, bassist Tio Moloantoa and percussionist Andile Nqubezelo. Rudd had met Moloantoa and Nqubezelo performing at the 2008 [[Wiesen, Austria|Wiesen]] Nuke Festival.<ref name=Cuthbertson>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/roots-of-a-psychic-revival/story-e6frg8n6-1225856584593|first=Ian|last=Cuthbertson|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Corp|date=22 April 2010|title=Roots of a psychic revival}}</ref> Rudd described his connection with Moloantoa and Nqubezelo as musical, spiritual and emotional—"I feel like they were sent to me," he said.<ref>{{cite press release|title=XAVIER RUDD TO RELEASE NEW ALBUM "KOONYUM SUN" IN APRIL: Ground Breaking Multi-instrumentalist Currently Touring in Europe|publisher=ANTI|date=2010|quote=“It’s been the most inspirational musical experience of my life,” shares Rudd about his writing with Tio and Andile. “We have an undeniable connection – musically, spiritually, and emotionally. I feel like they were sent to me.”}}</ref>

In 2010 Rudd bought 20&nbsp;hectares of property at Koonyum Range, [[Mullumbimby]], the location was the inspiration for the name of the album Rudd would release with Moloantoa and Nqubezelo, ''Koonyum Sun''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/domain/australian-capital-territory/old-dairy-now-cream-of-crop/2010/04/27/1272133728009.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|title=Old dairy now cream of crop|date=27 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429025640/http://www.smh.com.au/news/domain/australian-capital-territory/old-dairy-now-cream-of-crop/2010/04/27/1272133728009.html|archive-date=29 April 2010}}</ref> The album moved away from the heavier sound of ''Dark Shades of Blue'' to a more up-beat style.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.surfgirlmag.com/2010/01/13/xavier-rudd-falmouth-show|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203073647/http://www.surfgirlmag.com/2010/01/13/xavier-rudd-falmouth-show/|archive-date=3 February 2016|title=Xavier Rudd Tour|date=13 January 2010|publisher=SurfGirl Magazine}}</ref>

In 2015, Rudd was criticised for allowing the multi-national company [[KFC]], a seller of factory-farmed chicken, to use his song "Let Me Be" in a television advertisement. Some commentators felt the advertising campaign aligned with the Australian cricket season served to undermine Rudd's activism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/xavier-rudd-fans-angry-as-his-song-appears-in-kfc-ad-20151207-glhhaj.html|title=Xavier Rudd fans angry as his song appears in KFC ad|first=Kate|last=Aubusson|date=7 December 2015|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=10 November 2020}}</ref>
