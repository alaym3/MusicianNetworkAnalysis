'''Ninja Sex Party''' (often abbreviated as '''NSP''') is an American [[Comedy music|musical comedy]] [[Double act|duo]] consisting of singer [[Dan Avidan]] and keyboardist [[Brian Wecht]]. They formed in 2009 in [[New York City]] and are currently based in [[Los Angeles]]. They are also known as two thirds of the video game-based musical trio [[Starbomb]], together with frequent collaborator [[Egoraptor|Arin Hanson]]. Avidan joined Hanson's [[YouTube]] [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] [[webseries]] ''[[Game Grumps]]'' as co-host in 2013.

The work of Ninja Sex Party typically consists of [[rock music|rock]] or [[synth-pop]]-oriented humorous songs, frequently on the topics of sex, seduction, love or [[fantasy]], with Avidan and Wecht respectively portraying the characters of Danny Sexbang, an idiotic, exuberant, [[hypersexual]] [[Jewish]] man constantly trying to hit on women, and Ninja Brian, an uncommunicative, homicidal ninja with [[erectile disfunction]]. However, their ''Under the Covers'' [[cover album]] series that began in 2016 saw them take on a non-comedic approach to music for the first time, covering songs from the [[1970s in music|1970s]], [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[1990s in music|1990s]].

To date, NSP [[Ninja Sex Party discography|has released]] nine studio albums (six consisting of original material, and three cover albums), in addition to three albums as a part of Starbomb. Wecht initially acted as [[record producer]] and performed all instrumentation on their early albums, until they started working with producer Jim Arsenault (and later [[Jim Roach (producer)|Jim Roach]]) and [[backup band|backing band]] [[TWRP (band)|TWRP]] in 2015. Wecht and Avidan have appeared in Tupper Ware Remix Party's own works, either as individuals or as Ninja Sex Party. Since May 2018, Wecht also portrays Ninja Brian on his own live comedy show titled ''Ninja Brian's All-Star Variety Luau Spectacular''.
