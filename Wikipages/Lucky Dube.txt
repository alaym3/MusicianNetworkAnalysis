==Biography==

===Early life===
Lucky Dube was born in [[Ermelo, Mpumalanga|Ermelo]], formerly of the Eastern [[Transvaal Scottish Regiment|Transvaal]], now of [[Mpumalanga]], on 3 August 1964. His parents separated before his birth, and he was raised by his mother, who named him ''Lucky'' because she considered his birth fortunate after a number of failed pregnancies.<ref name="CNN">[http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/10/19/safrica.death/  Car jacker kills reggae star], ''CNN'', 19 October 2007.</ref> Along with his two siblings, Thandi and Mandla, Dube spent much of his childhood with his grandmother, Sarah, while his mother relocated to work. In a 1999 interview, he described his grandmother as "his greatest love" who "multiplied many things to bring up this responsible individual that I am today."<ref name="M&G">{{cite news|url=http://www.chico.mweb.co.za/art/q_n_a/990826-dube.html |title=Getting Lucky |newspaper=The Mail & Guardian |date=26 August 1999 |access-date=20 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911081427/http://www.chico.mweb.co.za/art/q_n_a/990826-dube.html |archive-date=11 September 2007 }}</ref><ref name="Bio">[http://www.luckydubemusic.com/biography.html Finding reggae], luckydubemusic.com, Retrieved 19 October 2007</ref>

===Beginning of his musical career===
As a child Dube worked as a gardener but, as he matured, realizing that he wasn't earning enough to feed his family, he began to attend school. There he joined a choir and with some friends, formed his first musical ensemble called ''The Skyway Band''.<ref name="Bio"/> While at school he discovered the [[Rastafari movement]]. At the age of 18 Dube joined his cousin's band, [[The Love Brothers]], playing [[Zulu music|Zulu]] [[Popular music|pop music]] known as [[mbaqanga]] whilst funding his lifestyle by working for Hole and Cooke as a security guard at the car auctions in [[Midrand]]. The band signed with Teal Record Company, under [[Richard Siluma]] (Teal was later incorporated into [[Gallo Record Company]]). Though Dube was still at school, the band recorded material in Johannesburg during his school holidays. The resultant album was released under the name ''Lucky Dube and the Supersoul''. The second album was released soon afterwards, and this time Dube wrote some of the lyrics in addition to singing. It was around this same time when he began to learn English.<ref name="Bio"/>

===Moving into reggae===
On the release of his fifth album, Dave Segal (who became Dube's sound engineer) encouraged him to drop the "Supersoul" element of the name. All subsequent albums were recorded as ''Lucky Dube''. At this time Dube began to note fans were responding positively to some reggae songs he played during [[live concert]]s. Drawing inspiration from [[Jimmy Cliff]]<ref name="Indy">Basildon Petain, [http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article3078918.ece South African reggae star shot dead in front of his children] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021114829/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article3078918.ece |date=21 October 2007 }}, ''The Independent'', 19 October 2007.</ref> and [[Peter Tosh]],<ref name="M&G"/> he felt the socio-political messages associated with Jamaican reggae were relevant to a South African audience in an [[institutional racism|institutionally racist]] society.<ref name="Indy"/>

He decided to try the new musical genre and in 1984, released the [[mini album]] ''Rastas Never Die''. The record sold poorly – around 4000 units – in comparison to the 30,000 units his mbaqanga records would sell. Keen to suppress anti-apartheid activism, the apartheid regime banned the album in 1985, because of its critical lyrics, for instance in the song ''"War and Crime"''.<ref name="SABC">[http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/crime1justice/0,2172,157771,00.html Condolences pour in for Lucky Dube] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621075355/http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/crime1justice/0,2172,157771,00.html |date=21 June 2008 }}, ''SABC'', 19 October 2007.</ref> However, he was not discouraged and continued to perform the reggae tracks live and wrote and produced a second reggae album. ''Think About The Children'' (1985). It achieved [[Music recording sales certification|platinum sales status]] and established Dube as a popular reggae artist in South Africa, in addition to attracting attention outside his homeland.<ref name="Bio"/>

=== Commercial and critical success ===
Dube continued to release commercially successful albums. In 1989, he won four [[OKTV Awards]] for ''Prisoner'', won another for ''Captured Live'' the following year and yet another two for ''House of Exile'' the year after.<ref name="Albums">[http://www.luckydubemusic.com/discography.html Discography], luckydubemusic.com, Retrieved 19 October 2007</ref> His 1993 album, ''Victims,'' sold over one million copies worldwide.<ref name="Reuters2"/> In 1995, he earned a worldwide recording contract with [[Motown Records|Motown]]. His album ''Trinity'' was the first release on [[Tabu Records]] after Motown's acquisition of the label.<ref name="Albums"/>

In 1996, he released a [[compilation album]], ''Serious Reggae Business'', which led to him being named the "Best Selling African Recording Artist" at the [[World Music Awards]] and the "International Artist of the Year" at the [[Ghana Music Awards]]. His next three albums each won [[South African Music Awards]].<ref name="Albums"/> His most recent album, ''Respect'', earned a European release through a deal with [[Warner Music]].<ref name="Reuters2"/> Dube toured internationally, sharing stages with artists such as [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].<ref name="Indy"/> He appeared at the 1991 [[Reggae Sunsplash]] (uniquely that year, was invited back on stage for a 25-minute-long encore) and the 2005 [[Live 8 concert, Johannesburg|Live 8]] event in Johannesburg.<ref name="Indy"/>

In addition to performing music Dube was a sometime actor, appearing in the feature films ''Voice in the Dark'', ''Getting Lucky,'' and ''Lucky Strikes Back''.<ref name="News24-2">[http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/Pages/profilefull.aspx?IndID=5079 Who's Who: Lucky Dube] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023170114/http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/Pages/profilefull.aspx?IndID=5079 |date=23 October 2007 }}, News24, Retrieved 10 October 2007.</ref>

Lucky Dube is considered to be especially remarkable as a Dub Artist due to his lack of a diasporic cultural base. This was particularly due to the nature of [[Reggae]] and Dub being a platform for expression of displacement from the homeland. In ''Prisoner'', the South African artist makes the genre his own by applying themes of apartheid and internal displacement.<ref name="Prisoner">{{YouTube|1Z3sVa9SJkI}}</ref> In the song and music video, he is found disturbing the bounds of the genre by highlighting the toils of his own homeland. He was revolutionary in so far as he introduced a competing version to Reggae's constant tendency of romanticizing the utopian homeland of Africa.

Dube took Dub and used it as a platform to promote racial equality within Africa during the Apartheid. He used dub to frame his arguments about colonialism and the African Slave trade, and how he felt that Africa should be reclaimed by the black race.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chude-Sokei |first1=Louis |title=When Echoes Return: roots, diaspora and possible Africas (a eulogy) |journal=Transition |date=2011 |issue=104 |pages=76-92}}</ref>

===Death===
On 18 October 2007, Lucky Dube was killed by armed robbers in Rosettenville, a Johannesburg suburb, shortly after dropping two of his seven children off at their uncle's house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/archive/s-african-reggae-star-lucky-dube-killed-attempted-car-jacking |title=S.

===Legacy===
On 21 October 2008, [[Rykodisc]] released a compilation album entitled ''Retrospective'', which featured many of Dube's most influential songs as well as previously unreleased tracks in the United States. The album celebrated Dube's music and honored the contributions he made to South Africa.<ref>[http://www.rykodisc.com/luckydube/bio/ Lucky Dube – Bio|Artists|RYKODISC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201165125/http://www.rykodisc.com/luckydube/bio/ |date=1 February 2009 }}</ref>
The [[Roots Reggae Library]] has taken steps to store digital versions of the Mbaqange albums made in the 80's. Five of the six albums have been retrieved. ''Ngikwethembe Na'' has yet to be found.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.roots-reggae-library.com/2014/10/the-tartans.html|title = Lucky Dube|access-date = 19 August 2015|website = roots-reggae-library.com|last = de Vries|first = Anton E.

As one of the first artists to bring African reggae to the mainstream, Dube bridged cultural gaps within the [[African diaspora]]. What Lucky Dube's music did was "[present] a praxis of cross-culturality and visionary possibility"<ref name="Chude-Sokei">{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/412974|title=When Echoes Return: roots, diaspora and possible Africas (a eulogy)|first=Louis|last=Chude-Sokei|date=27 January 2011|journal=Transition|volume=104|pages=76–92|access-date=3 January 2019|via=Project MUSE}}</ref> that the diaspora at large tends to erase. Dube gave Africa a voice and put its culture on the global stage by joining the global reggae community. Through taking Jamaican roots music back to its roots, he recontextualized the oppression and political struggles that reggae seeps itself in, bringing the basis of the diaspora back in conversation with the diaspora at large to allow for a more [[Pan-Africanism|pan-African]] form of cultural expression. Dube's roots reggae brought African people to the table in terms of conversation about the black diaspora by mimicking Caribbean artists' assertions of African authenticity or racial utopia.<ref name="Chude-Sokei"/>  Lucky Dube ultimately shows how Africans have to find their way into the conversations of the Black Diaspora by mimicking their assertions of African authenticity or racial utopia. Dube catalyzed roots reggae's appearance as a popular form of protest song.<ref name="Chude-Sokei"/> This helped “legitimize and strengthen the oppositional gesture in popular African music and culture, particularly for those generations born after decolonization.<ref name="Chude-Sokei"/>

On 18 October 2017, Gallo Records South Africa released a 25 track limited edition commemorative album titled ''The Times We've Shared''. The album features his biggest hits exclusive performances and 3 previously unreleased tracks.

In [[Australia]], Lucky Dube's music has found resonance in remote [[Australian Aboriginal]] communities, and his popularity has led Lucky Dube to be called "Bigger than the [[Beatles]]" throughout much of central and northern Australia.<ref name=abc>{{cite web |last1=Stevens |first1=Rhiannon |title='Bigger than the Beatles': The legacy of Lucky Dube |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-16/legacy-of-lucky-dube-indigenous-australian-desert-reggae/11590626 |website=ABC |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref> In 2005, Dube was a touring act in [[Alice Springs]], in [[central Australia]], promoted by entrepreneur Scott Boocock, on advice from his friend,  Joe Miller, a [[disc jockey]] on local First Nations radio station [[Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association#CAAMA Radio|CAAMA Radio]], and he had noted that Dube's popularity was growing. Dube's Australian tour started in May 2005, and he played in Alice Springs (to a crowd of 4,000 people), [[Darwin, Northern Territory]], and [[Cairns, Queensland]].
