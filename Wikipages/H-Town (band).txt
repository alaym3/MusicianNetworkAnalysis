'''H-Town''' is an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] vocal group from Houston, Texas, United States. H-Town was founded in 1990 by brothers Keven "Dino" Conner ({{c.}} 1975 – 2003),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/entertainment/music/article/H-Town-s-Dino-Conner-R-B-artist-dies-at-28-2084449.php|title=H-Town's Dino Conner, R&B artist, dies at 28|year=2003|publisher=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2019-01-03 |quote=Houston police report that a sports utility vehicle struck a car driven by Teshya Rae Weisent, 22, in which Conner was a passenger.

==History==
===Formation===
The group grew up together in Houston's [[Yellowstone, Houston|Yellowstone]] neighborhood located on the south side of the city. While attending [[Jack Yates High School]], in 1991, Keven and Solomon Conner formed a band with Darryl Jackson. They were known as "The Gents" and recorded their first album, ''It's No Dream'', with producer Phil Blackmon. Shazam was chosen as lead singer at the time of recording this album, which featured the ballad "A Time for Us". The album was released locally and was not a huge commercial success. The group continued recording and performed at talent shows and plays when a local producer sent their [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] to [[2 Live Crew]] rapper and record label executive [[Luther Campbell|Luther "Luke" Campbell]]. After an impromptu audition, Campbell signed the group to his label, [[Luke Records]]. Producer Bishop "Stick" Burrell became their producer and positioned Dino as lead singer, seeing his potential and rare voice as the formula for success in the group and built his sound around him. <ref name=youth>{{cite web|url=http://youthoutlook.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=113|title=H-Town: Learning the Lessons of Fame|last=Joseph|first=Stanley |date=2001-03-22|publisher=youthoutlook.org|access-date=2008-06-05}}</ref> They took the name of the group, "H-Town", from the local nickname for the city of Houston, Texas, in which they grew up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://htown4ever.com/blog/bio/|title=Bio|year=2011|publisher=H-Town Music|work=htown4ever.com|access-date=2008-10-17}}</ref>

"Boots" was a #1 hit on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks|R&B charts]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1993-06-12/r-b-hip-hop-songs|title=Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales: Chart Listing For The Week Of June 12, 1993|publisher=billboard.com|access-date=2008-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522011222/http://www.billboard.com/charts/1993-06-12/r-b-hip-hop-songs |archive-date=2013-05-22}}</ref> and peaked at #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/276320/h-town/chart|title=H-Town Chart History|publisher=billboard.com|access-date=2008-06-05}}</ref> "Lick U Up", the band's follow-up single, peaked at #21.

It peaked at #9 on the R&B Charts''.''

=== ''Beggin' After Dark'' (1994), ''Ladies Edition, Woman's World'' (1997)===
In late 1993, H-Town returned to the studio to record their second album ''[[Beggin' After Dark]] ''. It was released on November 8, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/h_town/albums.jhtml?albumId=46092|title=H-Town - ''Beggin' After Dark'' |publisher=mtv.com|access-date=2008-06-05}}</ref> The most popular single from this album was "Emotions". It became a #11 hit on the Billboard R&B chart and reached #51 on the Hot 100.<ref name=billboard /> Other tracks from the album included "Back Seat (Wit No Sheets)", "Full Time", "One Night Gigolo", "Tumble & Rumble", "Buss One", featuring [[reggae]] singer [[Tyler James Williams|Papa Reu]], and "Baby I Love Ya" featuring [[Zapp (band)|Roger Troutman]]. By the time H-Town returned to the studio to record ''[[Ladies Edition]]'', they had undergone some changes. They recorded a [[cover version]] of [[The Persuaders (band)|The Persuaders]]' "[[Thin Line Between Love and Hate|A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]" featuring [[Shirley Murdock]] for the [[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate|1996 film of the same name]]. The song became H-Town's first [[Top 40]] pop hit in three years, peaking at #37.<ref name=billboard /> They then cut ties with Luther Campbell, underwent a spiritual awakening of sorts, and became more aware of women's issues on their third album ''[[Ladies Edition, Woman's World]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429843/19971015/h_town.jhtml|title=H-Town Give Shout Out To "Women Of The World"|date=1997-10-15|publisher=mtv.com|access-date=2008-06-05}}</ref> It was released on October 28, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/h_town/albums.jhtml?albumId=121271|title=H-Town - ''Ladies Edition''|publisher=mtv.com|access-date=2008-06-05}}</ref> The album's general theme centers on a man's penitence for his past transgressions with his woman, a theme conveyed in songs such as "Don't Sleep on the Female", "Julie Rain" (an account of [[spousal abuse]]), and "Jezebel".  According to the liner notes, the album was dedicated to [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] and "all the women of the world." Twenty national women's telephone helplines were also listed on the back cover. Their one and only single from the album, "[[They Like It Slow]]" was released on September 23, 1997, and peaked at #35 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

=== Later career ===
Founding member Dino Conner was killed along with his girlfriend in an automobile accident in 2003.<ref name="mtv"/>  In 2004, the band self-released [[Imitations of Life]].  The surviving members continued to record and tour into the 2010s, collaborating with [[Pretty Ricky]] and [[Jodeci]] on a 2010 single "Knockin' Your Heels".
