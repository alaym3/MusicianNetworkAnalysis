'''Warlock''' were a German [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, founded 1982 in [[Düsseldorf]] by members of the underground bands Snakebite and Beast. The band gained popularity and some commercial success in Europe in the mid-1980s, due to the personality and stage presence of lead vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]]. Warlock supported successful heavy metal bands on tour, such as [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Dio (band)|Dio]] and [[Megadeth]].

By the end of the decade, Doro Pesch was the sole original member who remained in the band and she was forced to change the name to Doro for legal reasons. Doro, the band, continues to play several songs taken from the Warlock repertoire in their live shows.

The band has reunited for festival appearances and special occasions since 2003, under the name Warlock 1986.

==History==
===Formation and first contract===
The first nucleus of the band was formed under the name Snakebite in [[Düsseldorf]], West Germany in 1980,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hardharderheavy.de/band_biografie/bands_doro.shtml | title = Band: Doro | access-date = 17 July 2012 | date = 2 September 2007 | publisher = HardHarderHeavy.de | language = de}}</ref> and was composed of [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]] on vocals, Michael Bastian on guitar, Frank Rittel on bass and Thomas Franke on drums, the latter coming from the band Stallion.<ref name="fanclub" >{{cite journal | title = Warlock: the story so far | journal = International Warlock Fan Club Info Magazine | year = 1984 | issue = 1| url = http://demolishmag.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/warlock-the-story-so-far-1984/ | access-date = 10 February 2014}}</ref> Franke was soon replaced by Michael Eurich and, just before disbanding, Snakebite acquired the left-handed Peter Szigeti as second guitarist from Beast. Snakebite and Beast were two of the many bands playing in the local clubs and bars and recording cheap demos to promote their music.<ref name="fanclub" /> Pesch, Szigeti and Eurich did try-outs with other groups, but in October 1982 went on to form a new band with Thomas Studier on bass and guitarist Rudy Graf, who came up with the name Warlock and a bucket full of songs. The new band found a manager in Peter Zimmermann, who arranged gigs in support of German hard rockers Trance, contributing to build a solid reputation for Warlock in the local underground metal scene.<ref name="fanclub" />

After recording a four-track demo and sending it to several record labels and music magazines,<ref name="Axel" >{{cite web | url = http://www.metalkings.com/reviews/axel-thubeauville/axel-thubeauville-eng.htm | title = Interviews: Axel Thubeauville | access-date = 26 June 2012 | date = December 2002 | publisher = MetalKings.com}}</ref> the band obtained a contract with the Belgian [[independent label]] [[Mausoleum Records]].

===''Hellbound'' and ''True as Steel''===
In early 1985, the band signed a contract with the major label [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]] and recorded their second album ''[[Hellbound (Warlock album)|Hellbound]]'', produced by Henry Staroste and released in May 1985 on [[Vertigo Records]] in Europe. The band started to receive attention from the media and appeared in TV shows in the UK<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOGUWaeAraQ | title = Warlock - Live ECT 1985 | access-date = 9 July 2012 | date = 2 August 2007 | publisher = [[YouTube]]}}</ref> and Germany.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFKA2J0rjC8 | title = Warlock - Out of control ( rare german tv footage ) - 1980s | access-date = 9 July 2012 | date = 3 September 2010 | publisher = [[YouTube]]}}</ref> Their first full European tour brought them to [[Koko (venue)|Camden Palace Theater]] in London, where the concert was filmed for Warlock's first video release ''[[Metal Racer]]''.<ref name="bio">{{cite web | url = http://www.doroclan.de/DoroPesch/Neu/seite03usp.htm | title = Doro Pesch Biography | access-date = 30 June 2012 | last = Cannella | first = Tony | publisher = Doro Official Website | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6AaL5cSPZ?url=http://www.doroclan.de/DoroPesch/Neu/seite03usp.htm | archive-date = 10 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Warlock's live performance was welcomed with a rave review by the British magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]''<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Oliver | first1 = Derek | title = [[Kerrang!]] | chapter = Sizzling! | volume = 105 | publisher = Morgan Grampian | date = 17 October 1985 | location = London, UK | pages = 50}}</ref> and the group was elected 'Best New Band' of 1985 in the Readers' Poll of that magazine.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Dome | first1 = Malcolm | author-link1 = Malcolm Dome |title = Mega Metal Kerrang! | chapter = Warlock | volume = 1 | publisher = Spotlight Publications Ltd | year = 1986 | location = London, UK | pages = 2}}</ref> Doro Pesch was also elected Best Female Singer by the readers of the music magazine ''[[Metal Forces]]'' at the end of 1984.<ref name="Reynolds 1985"/> The band played at the Metal Hammer Festival at [[Loreley]], Germany in September, alongside [[Metallica]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]], [[Pretty Maids]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]] and [[Wishbone Ash]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www1.sk-static.com/images/media/img/col6/20100813-023318-518437.jpg | title = Metal Hammer Festival 1985 | access-date = 26 June 2012 | format = JPG | publisher = Songkick.com}}</ref>

Later that year, after the tour for ''Hellbound'', guitarist Rudy Graf left the band and was replaced by Niko Arvanitis,<ref name="megametal" >{{cite book | last1 = Simmons | first1 = Sylvie | author-link1=Sylvie Simmons|title = Mega Metal Kerrang! | chapter = 'Lock Jaw | volume = 4 | publisher = Spotlight Publications Ltd | year = 1986 | location = London, UK | pages = 8–11}}</ref> a former bandmate of Rittel in Stormwind.<ref name="fanclub" /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Stormwind/1856 | title = Stormwind | access-date = 26 June 2012 | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia Metallum]]}}</ref>

This updated line-up recorded the album ''[[True as Steel (album)|True as Steel]]'' in May–June 1986, produced again by Henry Staroste and mixed in the US by [[Michael Wagener]].<ref>{{cite magazine | last1 = Oliver | first1 = Derek | magazine = [[Kerrang!]] | title = Siren of Steel | volume = 126 | date = 7 August 1986 | location = London, UK | pages = 52–53}}</ref> The album received mixed reviews,<ref name="megametal" /> but was Warlock's highest-charting in Germany, climbing up to No. 18,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.officialcharts.de/suche.asp?search=warlock&x=6&y=7&country=de | title = Suche nach "warlock" | access-date = 27 June 2012 | work = Charts.de | publisher = [[Media Control Charts]] | language = de}}</ref> and got a fair amount of radio airplay in the US, due to the single "Fight for Rock".

On 16 August 1986, Doro Pesch was the first woman to front a band at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Castle Donington]], England, where Warlock played on the same stage of [[Motörhead]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/donington-1986.html | title = Monsters of Rock.

==Music and style==
Warlock were one of the few successful female-fronted heavy metal bands in the circuit during the 80s, when the scene was dominated by male singers.<ref name="megametal" /><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1233878/bio | title = Biography for Doro Pesch | access-date = 8 July 2012 | website = [[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> Doro Pesch's voice and stage presence immediately caught the attention of fans and press, and she became the principal means of promotion for the band, as well as the main spokesperson for Warlock.<ref name="megametal" />

Warlock's music is always primarily described as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/warlock-mn0000234355 | title = Warlock Biography | first = Greg | last = Prato | access-date = 26 June 2012 | work = [[Allmusic]] | publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]]}}</ref> and the band cite as main influences 1970s metal acts such as [[Judas Priest]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Accept (band)|Accept]],<ref>{{cite journal | title = Warlock Via Inferno | journal = Metal Attack | date = 22 July 1985 | issue = 23 | pages = 28–31| language = fr}}</ref> and groups from the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement.<ref name="megametal" />

Warlock's sound and songwriting evolved from the traditional heavy metal of their debut album ''[[Burning the Witches]]'' to the faster and darker ''[[Hellbound (Warlock album)|Hellbound]]'', which incorporates elements of [[power metal]], such as fast tempos, powerful choruses and fantasy-inspired lyrics. ''[[True as Steel (album)|True as Steel]]'' is a more commercial album, where any reference to fantasy and the occult in the lyrics was abandoned.<ref name="megametal" /><ref name="mind" /> ''[[Triumph and Agony]]'' recovers elements of the first albums, but veers also towards a melodic and FM radio-friendly sound, influenced by the US production. Other bands that had a similar sound include [[Keel (band)|Keel]], the late 80s' Judas Priest and [[Lizzy Borden (band)|Lizzy Borden]].

[[Power ballads]] were also characteristic of Warlock and are present in the track listings of every album.<ref name="burning" />
