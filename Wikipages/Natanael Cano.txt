Cano was the first musician to publicly fuse this variant of the two genres together which has made him stand out.<ref>{{Cite web|last=USA|first=El Periódico|title=Natanael Cano y sus "corridos tumbados", la revolución del regional mexicano {{!}} El Periódico USA {{!}} En español del Rio Grande Valley, Texas.|url=https://www.elperiodicousa.com/natanael-cano-y-sus-corridos-tumbados-la-revolucion-del-regional-mexicano/|access-date=2021-10-22|language=en-US}}</ref>  This genre was dubbed ''corridos tumbados''.<ref name="Vice-ES-2021">{{cite web | last=Salazar | first=Cynthia | title="El éxito se mide en dinero": Natanael Cano y el imperio del regional urbano | website=VICE | date=2021-01-18 | url=https://www.vice.com/es/article/dy84xw/el-exito-se-mide-en-dinero-natanael-cano-y-el-imperio-del-regional-urbano | language=es | access-date=2021-01-20}}</ref> The idea to fuse the two genres was proposed by Dan Sanchez whom wrote Natanael's first corrido tumbado, "Soy El Diablo".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_wrJkOJXfI&list=WL&index=22</ref>

==Early life==
Cano was born in [[Hermosillo]], [[Sonora]]. When Cano was nine, he showed off his talent at family events and parties or wherever he was invited.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Biografía de Natanael Cano|url=https://www.buenamusica.com/natanael-cano/biografia|access-date=2021-10-22|website=www.buenamusica.com|language=es}}</ref> When he first taught himself to play the guitar at thirteen, he learned Mexican band [[Maná|Maná's]] "[[Rayando El Sol|Rayando el Sol]]" off of YouTube.<ref name="copy">{{Cite magazine|title=20 Questions With Natanael Cano: Corridos Tumbados Artist on New Album, Songwriting Process & More|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/9579384/natanael-cano-interview-20-questions.|access-date=2021-10-25|magazine=Billboard|language=en}}</ref> Then he focused on regional Mexican [[corrido]]s like the ones by [[Ariel Camacho]] who was his ultimate source of inspiration.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|title=Biografía de Natanael Cano|url=https://www.buenamusica.com/natanael-cano/biografia|access-date=2021-10-25|website=www.buenamusica.com|language=es}}</ref><ref name="copy"/> Three years later at sixteen, when he dropped out of school, he released his first song on YouTube "El de los lentes Gucci" where he first fused hip-hop/trap with corridos, which he now refers to as corridos tumbados.<ref name=":0" /> 

==Music career==
At the beginning of his career, Cano primarily upload videos guitar covers to YouTube and later grew into performing underground.<ref name=":1" /> Cano signed to the Los Angeles-based urban regional Mexican label Rancho Humilde in March 2019.<ref name=":2" /> The label's founder, Jimmy Humilde was looking to sign more urban regional corridos singers and after watching Cano on an Instagram video in early 2019, he decided to fly Cano out to LA and eventually signed him.<ref name=":2" /> Humilde keeps Cano grounded, constantly reminding him that he "can achieve great things if he doesn't get lost in the journey".<ref name=":2" /> 

Cano also has partnerships with Warner Music Latin <ref name="Vice-ES-2021" /> and [[Apple Music]].<ref name="Remezcla">{{cite web | last=Estaff | first=Remezcla | title=Natanael Cano Joins Apple Music's Up Next Program | website=Remezcla | date=2020-09-09 | url=https://remezcla.com/music/natanael-cano-joins-apple-musics-up-next-program/ | access-date=2021-01-20}}</ref> Cano was the first musician to fuse this variant of the two genres together which has made him stand out, which has led him to be the first Mexican to be recognized as the artist of the month through Apple Music Up Next, "a show aimed at discovering rising stars that in previous years advanced several of today's top talents".<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|last=Romualdo|first=Javier|date=9 September 2020|title=Natanael Cano y sus "corridos tumbados", la revolución del regional mexicano: NATANAEL CANO (Entrevista)|work=EFE News Service|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440931123}}</ref> This accomplishment on Apple's huge platform shows that Cano, at the age of nineteen beat 300 million songs since his debut in 2019 and shows that he is the number one regional Mexican artist from his category of music.<ref name=":3" />

=== Corridos tumbados: combining trap music with the sounds of regional Mexico<ref name=":3" /> ===
The fusion of trap music and regional corridos known as corridos tumbados were born in Los Angeles where Cano arrived with Rancho Humilde to showcase his talents.<ref name=":3" /> Cano is best known for his creation of corridos tumbados which are inspired in the traditional songs of Mexico and combine the lyrics of trap music and sometimes hip-hop.<ref name=":3" /> He could be considered the king of corridos tumbados because he has been recognized for his interpretation of this subgenre of corridos.<ref name=":6" /> Cano states that the genre of music he specializes on is "the sound of regional Mexican music but with the sound of the new generation that young musicians added".<ref name=":3" /> Traditional corridos have consisted of daily tragedies, conflicts and even stories about crime with the subgenres like narco corridos<ref name=":3" /> and lumbre corridos.<ref name=":4" /> Before his album, "A Mis 20," he has stemmed away from his origins and mostly focused on trap corridos like in his albums "Las Torres 3," "Spy El Nata," and "Trap Tumbado".<ref name="copy" /> Cano turned his focus back to corridos tumados because he said he that that is his main focus right now.<ref name="copy" />

=== Influences and Inspiration ===
Throughout the earlier stages of Cano's music career, Cano was heavily influenced by corridos he grew up listening performed by regional Mexican artists [[Gerardo Ortíz|Geraldo Ortiz]] and Ariel Camacho. <ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Flores|first=Griselda|date=15 February 2020|title=Natanael Cano|work=Billboard}}</ref> Cano says that he if he could see any artist perform dead or alive, it would be Ariel Camacho since he passed away before Cano got a chance to see him in concert. <ref>{{Cite web|last=copy|first=Copied to clipboardClick to|title=20 Questions With Natanael Cano: Corridos Tumbados Artist on New Album, Songwriting Process & More|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/9579384/natanael-cano-interview-20-questions|access-date=2021-11-04|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref> By his late teens, he became inspired by a corrido group from Orange County, California, Legado 7, known best for their "lumbre corridos" (fire corridos) which they became known for since they broke traditional values and wrote lyrics about weed.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=LEGADO 7|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/7yCGrS6Xh3UngvY6Ad5sMJ|access-date=2021-11-04|website=Spotify|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> Cano's songs are influenced by experiences in his personal life or of his friends.<ref name=":3" /> His lyrics are based on events that he has gone through in his life.<ref name=":3" /> As a big fan of musicians like [[Bad Bunny]], [[Jhay Cortez]], and [[J Balvin]], Cano is musically inspired by them.<ref name="copy" />

=== Goals ===
Cano mentions that his goal is to collaborate with many different Latin trap artists but he wants the collaborations to happen naturally, not be force. <ref name=":2" /> Cano's dream collaboration would be with [[Anuel AA]] and that he is the top collaboration he would like follow through with.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":5">{{Citation|title=¿Una colaboración con Anuel AA?
