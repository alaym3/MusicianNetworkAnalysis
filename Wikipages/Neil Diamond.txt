''Rolling Stone'' Interview, September 23, 1976, pp. 105–09.</ref> Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then became aware of the possibility of writing his own songs. "And the next thing, I got a guitar when we got back to Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs," he said.<ref name=RS76/> He added that his attraction to songwriting was the "first real interest" he had growing up, while also helping him release his youthful "frustrations".<ref name=RS76/>

Diamond also used his newly developing skill to write poetry. By writing poems for girls he was attracted to in school, he soon learned it often won their hearts. His male classmates took note and began asking him to write poems for them, which they would sing and use with equal success.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|10}} He spent the summer following his graduation as a waiter in the [[Catskills]] resort area.

==Career==

===1960s===
Diamond was not rehired after his 16 weeks with Sunbeam, and he began writing and singing his own songs for demos. "I never really chose songwriting," he says. "It just absorbed me and became more and more important in my life."<ref name=RS76/> His first recording contract was billed as "Neil and Jack", an [[Everly Brothers]]-type duet with high school friend Jack Packer.<ref name=RS88/> They recorded the unsuccessful singles "You Are My Love at Last" with "What Will I Do", and "I'm Afraid" with "Till You've Tried Love", both records released in 1962. ''Cashbox'' and ''Billboard'' magazines gave all four sides excellent reviews, and Diamond signed with [[Columbia Records]] as a solo performer later in 1962. In July 1963, Columbia released the single "At Night" with "Clown Town"; ''Billboard'' gave an excellent review to Clown Town, and ''Cashbox'' gave both sides excellent reviews, but it still failed to make the charts. Columbia dropped him from their label and he went back to writing songs in and out of publishing houses for the next seven years.

He wrote wherever he could, including on buses, and used an upright piano above the [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland Club]] in New York City. One of the causes of this early nomadic life as a songwriter was his songs' wordiness: "I'd spent a lot of time on lyrics, and they were looking for hooks, and I didn't really understand the nature of that," he says.<ref name=RS76/> He was able to sell only about one song a week during those years, barely enough to survive on. He found himself only earning enough to spend 35 cents a day on food (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.35|1963}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name=RS76/> But the privacy that he had above the Birdland Club allowed him to focus on writing without distractions. "Something new began to happen. I wasn't under the gun, and suddenly interesting songs began to happen, songs that had things none of the others did."<ref name=RS76/> Among them were "[[Cherry, Cherry]]" and "[[Solitary Man (song)|Solitary Man]]". "Solitary Man" was the first record that Diamond recorded under his own name which made the charts. It remains one of his personal all-time favorites, as it was about his early years as a songwriter, even though he failed to realize it at the time. He describes the song as "an outgrowth of my despair".<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|37}}

Diamond spent his early career in the [[Brill Building]]. His first success as a songwriter came in November 1965 with "[[Sunday and Me]]", a Top 20 hit for [[Jay and the Americans]]. Greater success followed with "[[I'm a Believer]]", "[[A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You]]", "Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)", and "Love to Love", all performed by [[the Monkees]]. He wrote and recorded the songs for himself, but the cover versions were released before his own.<ref>Interview, ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'', transmitted on May 23, 2008, on BBC One</ref> The unintended consequence was that Diamond began to gain fame as a songwriter. "I'm a Believer" became a gold record within two days of its release and stayed at the top of the charts for seven weeks, making it the Popular Music Song of the Year in 1966.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|44}}

"[[And the Grass Won't Pay No Mind]]" brought covers from [[Elvis Presley]] (who also interpreted "Sweet Caroline") and [[Mark Lindsay]], former lead singer for [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]]. Other notable artists who recorded his early songs were the English hard-rock band [[Deep Purple]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], and [[Cliff Richard]].{{efn|Richard released versions of "[[I'll Come Running (Neil Diamond song)|I'll Come Running]]", "Solitary Man", "[[Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon]]", "I Got the Feelin' (Oh No No)", and "Just Another Guy".}}

In 1966, Diamond signed a deal with [[Bert Berns]]'s [[Bang Records]], then a subsidiary of [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]. His first release on that label was "Solitary Man", which was his first true hit as a solo artist.{{efn|Prior to the release of "Solitary Man", he had considered using a stage name; he came up with "Noah Kaminsky" and "Eice Charry."<ref>{{cite news|last=Devine|first=Rachel|title=Pick of the week: Neil Diamond|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4039468.ece|access-date=March 11, 2011|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=June 1, 2008|location=London}}</ref> Bang Records asked him which name to use, and he thought of his grandmother, who had died prior to the release of "Solitary Man"; he told Bang to "go with 'Neil Diamond' and I'll figure it out later."}} Diamond followed with "[[Cherry, Cherry]]" and "[[Kentucky Woman]]".<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|37}} His early concerts featured him opening for bands such as [[Herman's Hermits]] and [[the Who]].<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|45}} As a guest performer with The Who, he was shocked to see [[Pete Townshend]] swinging his guitar like a club and then throwing it against walls and off the stage until the instrument's neck broke.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|46}}

Diamond began to feel restricted by Bang Records because he wanted to record more ambitious, introspective music, such as "Brooklyn Roads" from 1968. Berns wanted to release "Kentucky Woman" as a single, but Diamond was no longer satisfied writing simple pop songs, so he proposed "[[Shilo (song)|Shilo]]", which was not about the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] but rather an imaginary childhood friend. Bang believed that the song was not commercial enough, so it was relegated to being an LP track on "[[Just for You (Neil Diamond album)|Just for You]]". Diamond was also dissatisfied with his royalties and tried to sign with another record label after discovering a loophole in his contract that did not bind him exclusively to either WEB IV or Tallyrand, but the result was a series of lawsuits that coincided with a slump in his record sales and professional success. A magistrate refused WEB IV's request for a temporary injunction to prevent Diamond from joining another record company while his contract dispute continued in court, but the lawsuits persisted until February 18, 1977, when he triumphed in court and purchased the rights to his Bang-era master tapes.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|51}}<ref name=musicianguide>* Johnson, Anne Janette [http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001145/Neil-Diamond.html "Neil Diamond Biography"], Musician Guide.</ref>

On March 18, 1968, Diamond signed a deal with [[Uni Records]];<ref name="musicianguide"/> the label was named after [[Universal Pictures]], the owner of which, [[MCA Inc.]], later consolidated its labels into [[MCA Records]] (now called [[Universal Music]] after merging with PolyGram in 1999). His debut album for Uni/MCA was ''[[Velvet Gloves and Spit]]'', produced by [[Tom Catalano]], which did not chart, and he recorded the follow-up ''[[Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show]]'' at [[American Sound Studios]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] with [[Tommy Cogbill]] and [[Chips Moman]] producing.<ref name="musicianguide"/>

===1970s===
In late 1969, he moved to Los Angeles. His sound mellowed with such songs as "[[Sweet Caroline]]" (1969), "[[Holly Holy]]" (1969), "[[Cracklin' Rosie]]" (1970) and "[[Song Sung Blue]]" (1972), the last two reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the Hot 100. "Sweet Caroline" was Diamond's first major hit after his slump. In 2007 Diamond said he had written "Sweet Caroline" for [[Caroline Kennedy]] after seeing her on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in an equestrian riding outfit,<ref>CBS "Sunday Morning", November 5, 2008.</ref> but in 2014 he said in an interview on the Today Show that it was written for his then wife, Marcia. He could not find a good rhyme with the name "Marcia" and so used the name Caroline.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/20/showbiz/music/neil-diamond-sweet-caroline/ Neil Diamond reveals story behind 'Sweet Caroline'], CNN, October 20, 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.today.com/toyotaconcertseries/neil-diamond-reveals-sweet-caroline-secret-today-1D80228037 Neil Diamond reveals 'Sweet Caroline' is about more than JFK's daughter], Today Show website, 10/20/14.</ref> It took him just one hour, in a Memphis hotel, to write and compose it. The 1971 release "[[I Am... I Said|I Am...I Said]]" was a Top 5 hit in both the US and UK and was his most intensely personal effort to date, taking over four months to complete.<ref name="jackson">{{cite book | last=Jackson | first= Laura | author-link= Lara Jackson | title = Neil Diamond: His Life, His Music, His Passion | publisher=[[ECW Press]] | year=2005 | pages = 80–81}}</ref>

In 1971, Diamond played 7 sold-out concerts at the [[Greek Theater (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in Los Angeles. The outdoor theater, which was noted for showcasing the best of current entertainers, added a stereo sound system for the first time. Diamond was also backed by a 35-piece string orchestra and six backing singers.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|86}} After the first night, one leading newspaper called it "the finest concert in Greek Theater history."<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|87}}

In August 1972, he played again at the Greek, this time doing 10 shows. When the show was first announced, tickets at the 5000-seat theater sold out rapidly.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|93}} He added a quadraphonic sound system for his performance to create full surround-sound. The performance of August 24, 1972, was recorded and released as the live double album ''[[Hot August Night]]''. ''Hot August Night'' demonstrates Diamond's skills as a performer and showman, as he reinvigorated his back catalogue of hits with new energy. Diamond recalled: "''Hot August Night'' captures a very special show for me. We went all out to really knock 'em dead in L.A."<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|93}} Many consider it his best work; critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called ''Hot August Night'' "the ultimate Neil Diamond record...

In the fall of 1972, Diamond performed for 20 consecutive nights at the [[Winter Garden Theater]] in New York City.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|95}} That theater had not staged a one-man show since [[Al Jolson]] in the 1930s.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|95}} The approximately 1,600-seat Broadway venue provided an intimate concert setting not common at the time, with every performance reportedly sold out.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|95}} It also made Diamond the first rock-era star to headline on Broadway.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|95}} The review in the ''New York Times'' stated:

But Mr. Diamond is clearly a brash young man and one with both the musical track record and the performance macho to bring it off...He needn't worry about comparisons with the likes of Garland and Kaye.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|95}}}}

After the Winter Garden shows, Diamond announced that he needed a break, and he engaged in no more live performances till 1976. He used those four years to work on the score for [[Hall Bartlett]]'s film version of [[Richard Bach]]'s ''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]'' and to record two albums, ''[[Serenade (Neil Diamond album)|Serenade]]'' and ''[[Beautiful Noise]]''. He said years later, "I knew I'd come back, but I wasn't sure when. I spent one year on each of those albums...I'd been on the road six years.

He also said he needed to get back to having a private life, one where he could be anonymous.<ref name=Billboard-1977>''Billboard'', February 19, 1977, p. 32.</ref>

In 1973, Diamond switched labels again, returning to [[Columbia Records]] for a million-dollar-advance-per-album contract (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1973}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name="musicianguide"/> His first project, released as a solo album, was the soundtrack to ''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull (film)|Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]''. The film received hostile reviews and did poorly at the box office, and the album grossed more than the film did. [[Richard Bach|Richard D. Bach]], author of the best-selling source story, disowned the film, and he and Diamond sued Bartlett, though for differing reasons; in Bach's case, it was because he felt the film omitted too much from the original novella, whereas in Diamond's case, it was because he felt the film had butchered his score. "After 'Jonathan,'" Diamond declared, "I vowed never to get involved in a movie again unless I had complete control." Bartlett angrily responded to Diamond's lawsuit by criticizing his music as having become "too slick...and it's not as much from his heart as it used to be." Bartlett also added, "Neil is extraordinarily talented. Often his arrogance is just a cover for the lonely and insecure person underneath."<ref>{{cite news|last=Arrington |first=Carl |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081836,00.html |title=Having Survived a Tumor and ''The Jazz Singer'', Neil Diamond Eases His Life Back into Shape |work=People|date=April 5, 1982|access-date=August 7, 2013}}</ref>

Despite the controversy surrounding the film, the soundtrack was a success, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard albums chart. Diamond also won a [[Golden Globes|Golden Globe Award]] for Best Original Score and a [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture]].<ref name=musicianguide/> Thereafter, Diamond often included a ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' suite in his live performances, as he did in his 1976 "Love at the Greek" concert and for his show in Las Vegas that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyBkeUmUkfI|title=Neil Diamond live (1/2) - Jonathan Livingston Seagull|date=September 25, 2011|access-date=August 18, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

Diamond returned to live shows in 1976 with an Australian tour, "The 'Thank You Australia' Concert", which was broadcast to 36 television outlets nationwide. He also again appeared at the Greek Theater in a 1976 concert, ''[[Love at the Greek]]''. An album and accompanying video/DVD of the show includes a version of "Song Sung Blue" with duets with [[Helen Reddy]] and [[Henry Winkler]], a.k.a.

In 1974, Diamond released the album ''[[Serenade (Neil Diamond album)|Serenade]]'', from which "[[Longfellow Serenade]]" and "I've Been This Way Before" were issued as singles. The latter had been intended for the ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' score, but Diamond had completed it too late for inclusion. That same year he appeared on a TV special for [[Shirley Bassey]] and sang a duet with her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axH_nNprRSg|title=Shirley Bassey & Neil Diamond – Play Me / Diamond – Sweet Caroline / Longfellow Serenade (1974 TV)|date=March 19, 2011|access-date=March 15, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

[[File:Neil Diamond Aladdin Theater For the Performing Arts 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Diamond performing on opening night of the Theater For the Performing Arts at the [[Aladdin Hotel & Casino]], on July 2, 1976.]]

In 1976, he released ''[[Beautiful Noise]]'', produced by [[Robbie Robertson]] of [[The Band]]. On Thanksgiving 1976, Diamond made an appearance at The Band's farewell concert, ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', performing "Dry Your Eyes", which he wrote jointly with Robertson, and which had appeared on ''Beautiful Noise''. He also joined the rest of the performers onstage at the end in a rendition of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[I Shall Be Released]]".

Diamond was paid $650,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|650000|1976}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, to open its new $10&nbsp;million Theater For the Performing Arts on July 2, 1976. The show played through July 5 and drew sold-out crowds at the 7,500-seat theater. A "who's who" of Hollywood attended opening night, ranging from [[Elizabeth Taylor]] to [[Chevy Chase]], and Diamond walked out on stage to a standing ovation. He opened the show with a story about an ex-girlfriend who dumped him before he became successful. His lead-in line to the first song of the evening was, "You may have dumped me a bit too soon, baby, because look who's standing here tonight."

He performed at [[Woburn Abbey]] on July 2, 1977, to an audience of 55,000 British fans. The concert and interviews were taped by film director [[William Friedkin]], who used six cameras to capture the performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdsa_-WPZIQ|title=Neil Diamond enters the stage to 55000 screaming fans at Woburn Abbey in 1977|date=June 30, 2013|access-date=August 18, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

In 1977, Diamond released ''[[I'm Glad You're Here With Me Tonight]]'', including "[[You Don't Bring Me Flowers]]", for which he composed the music and on the writing of whose lyrics he collaborated with [[Alan Bergman]] and [[Marilyn Bergman]]. [[Barbra Streisand]] covered the song on her album ''[[Songbird (Barbra Streisand album)|Songbird]]'', and later, a Diamond-Streisand duet was recorded, spurred by the success of radio mash-ups. That version hit No. 1 in 1978, his third song to top the Hot 100. They appeared unannounced at the 1980 [[Grammy awards]] ceremony, where they performed the song to a surprised and rapturous audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpyduY49CE0|title=YouTube|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref>

His last 1970s album was ''[[September Morn (album)|September Morn]]'', which included a new version of "[[I'm a Believer]]". It and "[[Red Red Wine]]" are his best-known original songs made more famous by other artists. In February 1979, the uptempo "Forever in Blue Jeans", co-written and jointly composed with his guitarist, Richard Bennett, was released as a single from ''You Don't Bring Me Flowers'', Diamond's album from the previous year.<ref>Diamond had originally titled that particular album ''The American Popular Song'', but he changed its title after his and Streisand's duet, "You Don't Bring Me Flowers", charted.</ref>

In 1979, Diamond collapsed on stage in San Francisco and was taken to the hospital, where he endured a 12-hour operation to remove what turned out to be a tumor on his spine.<ref name="juke/ref">''[[Juke Magazine]]'', June 9, 1983.</ref> He said he had been losing feeling in his right leg "for a number of years but ignored it." When he collapsed, he had no strength in either leg.<ref name="juke/ref"/> He underwent a long rehabilitation process just before starting principal photography on his film ''[[The Jazz Singer (1980 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' (1980).<ref name="entertainment.timesonline.co.uk"/> He was so convinced he was going to die that he wrote farewell letters to his friends.<ref name="juke/ref"/>

===1980s===
A planned film version of "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" to star Diamond and Streisand fell through when Diamond instead starred in a 1980 remake of the [[Al Jolson]] classic ''[[The Jazz Singer (1980 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' alongside [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Lucie Arnaz]]. Though the movie received poor reviews, the soundtrack spawned three Top 10 singles, "Love on the Rocks", "Hello Again", and "[[America (Neil Diamond song)|America]]", the last of which had emotional significance for Diamond. "'America' was the story of my grandparents," he told an interviewer. "It's my gift to them, and it's very real for me ... In a way, it speaks to the immigrant in all of us."<ref name=Bream/>{{rp|89}} The song was performed in full by Diamond during the film's finale.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc-v8CFJzu4 "America:" ''The Jazz Singer'' finale], [[YouTube]]</ref> An abbreviated version played over the film's opening titles.

The song was also the one he was most proud of, partly because of when it was later used: national news shows played it when the hostages were shown returning home after the [[Iran hostage crisis]] ended; it was played on the air during the 100th anniversary of the [[Statue of Liberty]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_7gcu1dmGk|title=Neil Diamond "America" Live 1986 New York City (Full version with reprise)|date=June 22, 2016|access-date=August 18, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> and at a tribute to slain civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], as well as the Vietnam Vets Welcome Home concert, he was asked to perform it live. At the time, a national poll found the song to be the number-one most recognized song about America, more than "God Bless America".<ref name=RS88/> It also became the anthem of his world tour two weeks after the attacks on America on September 11, 2001, when he changed the lyric at the end from; "They're coming to America", to "Stand up for America!" Earlier that year he performed it after a request from former heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7UuesqOD0g|title=Neil Diamond takes live song request from Muhammad Ali|date=June 4, 2016|access-date=August 18, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

The film's failure was due in part to Diamond never having acted professionally before. "I didn't think I could handle it," he said later, seeing himself as "a fish out of water."<ref name=Bream/>{{rp|85}} For his performance, Diamond became the first-ever winner of a Worst Actor [[Razzie Award]], even though he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the same role. Critic [[David Wild]] noted that the film showed that Diamond was open about his religion: "Who else but this Jewish Elvis could go multi-platinum with an album that featured a version of '[[Kol Nidre|the Kol Nidre]]?'"<ref name=RS88/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IEDLZayfdU Neil Diamond singing the "Kol Nidre"], ''The Jazz Singer'', clip. [[YouTube]]</ref> Diamond later told the ''Los Angeles Times'', "For me, this was the ultimate [[bar mitzvah]]."<ref name=Bream/>{{rp|85}}

Another Top 10 selection, "[[Heartlight (song)|Heartlight]]", was inspired by the blockbuster 1982 movie ''[[E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]]''. Though the film's title character is never mentioned in the lyrics, [[Universal Pictures]], which had released ''[[E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and was the parent company of the [[Uni Records]] label, by then called [[MCA Records]], for which Diamond had recorded for years, briefly threatened legal action against both Diamond and Columbia Records.

Diamond's record sales slumped somewhat in the 1980s and 1990s, his last single to make the Billboard's Pop Singles chart coming in 1986, but his concert tours continued to be big draws. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine ranked Diamond as the most profitable solo performer of 1986.<ref>Music Choice Television – on screen facts</ref> He released his 17th studio album in 1986, ''[[Headed for the Future]]'', which reached number 20 on the ''Billboard 200''. Three weeks later he starred in ''Hello Again'', his first television special in nine years, performing comedy sketches and a duo medley with [[Carol Burnett]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7RKnZMd2pA&t=72s|title=YouTube|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref>

In January 1987, Diamond sang the national anthem at the [[Super Bowl XXI|Super Bowl]]. His "America" became the theme song for the [[Michael Dukakis]] 1988 presidential campaign. That same year, UB40's reggae interpretation of Diamond's ballad "[[Red Red Wine]]" topped the Billboard Pop Singles chart and, like the Monkees' version of "I'm a Believer", became better known than Diamond's original version.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, Diamond produced six studio albums. He covered many classic songs from the movies and from famous Brill Building-era songwriters. He also released two Christmas albums, the first of which peaked at No. 8 on Billboard's Album chart. Diamond also recorded two albums of mostly new material during this period. In 1992, he performed for President [[George H.W. Bush]]'s final ''Christmas in Washington'' [[NBC]] special. In 1993, Diamond opened the Mark of the Quad Cities (now the iWireless Center) with two shows on May 27 and 28 to a crowd of 27,000-plus.

The 1990s saw a resurgence in Diamond's popularity. "[[Sweet Caroline]]" became a popular sing-along at sporting events. It was used at [[Boston College]] [[Boston College Eagles football|football]] and [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|basketball]] games. College sporting events in other states also played it,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brfj-s4llGo|title=Penn State. Sweet Caroline.

The [[New York Rangers]] also adapted it as their own and played it whenever they were winning at the end of the third period of their games. The [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pitt Panthers football]] team also played it after the third quarter of all home games, with the crowd cheering, "Let's go Pitt". The [[Carolina Panthers]] played it at the end of every home game they won. The [[Davidson College]] pep band likewise played it in the second half of every [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball]] home game.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===2000s===

A more severely stripped-down-to-basics album, ''[[12 Songs (Neil Diamond album)|12 Songs]]'', produced by [[Rick Rubin]], was released on November 8, 2005, in two editions: a standard 12-song release, and a special edition with two bonus tracks, including one featuring backing vocals by [[Brian Wilson]]. The album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard chart, and received generally positive reviews; Earliwine describes the album as "inarguably Neil Diamond's best set of songs in a long, long time."<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r805249 |title=12 Songs – Neil Diamond &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=November 8, 2005 |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref> ''12 Songs'' also became noteworthy as one of the last albums to be pressed and released by [[Sony BMG]] with the [[Extended Copy Protection]] software embedded in the disc. (See the [[2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal]].)

In 2007, Diamond was inducted into the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limusichalloffame.org/inductees/07inductees.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217232729/http://www.limusichalloffame.org/inductees/07inductees.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 17, 2007|title=LIMHOF - 2007 Inductees|date=February 17, 2007|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref>

On March 19, 2008, it was announced on the television show ''[[American Idol]]'' that Diamond would be a guest mentor to the remaining ''Idol'' contestants, who would sing Diamond songs for the broadcasts of April 29 and 30, 2008. On the April 30 broadcast, Diamond premiered a new song, "Pretty Amazing Grace", from his then recently released album ''[[Home Before Dark]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.spinner.com/2008/04/29/neil-diamond-goes-home-before-dark/ |title=AOL Radio – Listen to Free Online Radio – Free Internet Radio Stations and Music Playlists |website=Spinner.com |date= |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref> On May 2, 2008, Sirius Satellite Radio started Neil Diamond Radio. On April 8, 2008, Diamond made a surprise announcement in a big-screen broadcast at Fenway Park that he would be appearing there "live in concert" on August 23, 2008, as part of his world tour. The announcement, which marked the first official confirmation of any 2008 concert dates in the US, came during the traditional eighth-inning singalong of "Sweet Caroline", which had by that time become an anthem for Boston fans.

On April 28, 2008, Diamond appeared on the roof of the [[Jimmy Kimmel]] building to sing "Sweet Caroline" after Kimmel was jokingly arrested for singing the song dressed as a Diamond impersonator.

On June 29, 2008, Diamond played to an estimated 108,000 fans at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in Somerset, England on the Concert of a Lifetime Tour; technical problems{{Which|date=November 2016}} marred the concert.<ref>[https://www.nme.com/news/neil-diamond/37729 "Neil Diamond overcomes technical problems to wow Glastonbury"], NME, UK, June 29, 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_8gQMUYnXlxOW7Syx-FN8g|title=Neildi|website=YouTube|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref>
In August, Diamond allowed cameras to record his entire four-night run at New York's Madison Square Garden; he released the resulting DVD in the U.S. in 2009, one year to the day of the first concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-daijUbwBs|title=YouTube|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Hot August Night/NYC: Live from Madison Square Garden|Hot August Night/NYC]]'' debuted at No. 2 on the charts. On the same day the DVD was released, CBS aired an edited version, which won the ratings hour with 13 million viewers. The next day, the sales of the DVD surged, prompting Sony to order more copies to meet the high demand.

On August 25, 2008, Diamond performed at The Ohio State University while suffering from laryngitis. The result disappointed him as well as his fans, and on August 26, he offered refunds to anyone who applied by September 5.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/27/raspy-neil-diamond-offers_n_121732.html |title=Raspy Neil Diamond Offers Refunds |website=Huffingtonpost.com |date= August 27, 2008|access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref>

Diamond was honored as the [[MusiCares Person of the Year]] on February 6, 2009, two nights before the 51st Annual [[Grammy Awards]].

Long loved in Boston, Diamond was invited to sing at the July 4, 2009, Independence Day celebration.

On October 13, 2009, he released ''[[A Cherry Cherry Christmas]]'', his third album of holiday music.

===2010s===
[[File:1afin-2795f.jpg|thumb|Diamond (2015)]]
On November 2, 2010, Diamond released the album ''[[Dreams (Neil Diamond album)|Dreams]]'', a collection of 14 interpretations of his favorite songs by artists from the rock era. The album also included a new slow-tempo arrangement of his "[[I'm a Believer]]". In December, he performed a track from the album, "[[Ain't No Sunshine]]", on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' with [[Committed (group)|Committed]] and [[Street Corner Symphony (group)|Street Corner Symphony]], two [[A cappella|a cappella groups]] featured on the show.

The years 2011 and 2012 were marked by several milestones in Diamond's career. On March 14, 2011, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at a ceremony at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.
