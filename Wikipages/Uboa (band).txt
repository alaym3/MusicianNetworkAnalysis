==Life==
Xandra lives in [[Melbourne]], Australia. Uboa's music often reflects her struggles with her [[transgender]] identity, reflected in her music via the juxtaposition of emotional ambient music and harsh white noise.<ref name="sf">Vellucci, Justin. "[http://swordfishblog.com/2019/04/interview-xandra-metcalfe-of-uboa-2019/ Interview: Xandra Metcalfe of Uboa (2019)]". ''Swordfish'', 15 April 2019. Retrieved 3 August 2019</ref> In an April 2019 interview she described the sources of her mental pain as including "mistaken identity, failed relationships and inability to love, joblessness, boredom, structurelessness, psychosis...[and] anxiety."<ref name="sf" />

==Music==
In a very positive review of ''The Origin of My Depression'' by the critic [[Anthony Fantano]], her sound was described as a "cerebral dive" into Xandra's most negative and intense feelings of being a transgender woman...via "intense feelings of abandonment...expressed through intense soundscapes...and walls of distortion", culminating in a wide expanse of styles and soundscapes.<ref name="af" /> Metcalfe has said of the album's sound, "I always associated sadness in music with sparseness, barrenness and quietness. I wanted to signify empty space musically. Hence why the harsh noise is few and far between, and I think a little more effective because of all the sparseness it contrasts with".<ref name="parr" />  Comparing the two albums, Metcalfe has said "Originally I was worried 'The Origin of My Depression' wasn't "Uboa" enough because of how restrained and sparse it is as a record."

She describes the writing process for ''My Depression'' as having "little conscious intentionality, it was mostly an intuitive process of writing. Nothing was planned out, and a lot of the songs were improvisations refined into compositions, usually after several attempts. “Detransitioning” took countless attempts to get right, whereas “An Angel of Great and Terrible Light” came out of nowhere."<ref name="sf" />
