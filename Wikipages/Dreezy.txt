== Life and career ==

Throughout her childhood, Sledge  moved to a number of locations throughout the city of Chicago. To escape issues that a number of teens face (blended families, constantly having new friends, and problems at home) Sledge looked into the [[fine art]]s, which helped her deal with some of the realities of her life. She explored scatting, poetry writing, and drifted towards [[singing]] at the age of 10. Sledge always felt like music was her internal escapism, and by the age of 14, she found interest in becoming a rapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/dreezy-interview-schizo|title=Dreezy Is the Crown Princess of Chicago Rap|publisher=Tara Mahadevan|access-date=January 29, 2015}}</ref> Sledge has cited rappers [[J.
