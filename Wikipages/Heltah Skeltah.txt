'''Heltah Skeltah''' was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo which consisted of rappers Jahmal "Rock" Bush and [[Sean Price|Sean "Ruck" Price]]. The two were also members of New York [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Boot Camp Clik]], along with [[Buckshot (rapper)|Buckshot]], [[Smif-N-Wessun]] and [[O.G.C.]]

== Biography ==
Heltah Skeltah debuted on Smif-N-Wessun's album ''[[Dah Shinin']]'' in 1995, appearing on the tracks "Wontime", "Cession at da Doghillee" and "Let's Git It On". Later in 1995, they grouped up with fellow Boot Camp members O.G.C. to form [[the Fab 5]] (a nod to [[the Beatles]]), and released a surprise hit single, "Leflaur Leflah Eshkoshka". Out of the Fab 5 members, Rock and Sean Price received the most attention for their charisma and chemistry. The duo released their debut album ''[[Nocturnal (Heltah Skeltah album)|Nocturnal]]'' in June 1996, which included "Leflah", as well as the singles "Operation Lock Down" and "Therapy". The album sold over 250,000 copies in the United States, and has become a classic because of its grimy, basement sound and strong lyrics. The duo released a group album with the Boot Camp in 1997, then followed in 1998 with their second effort ''[[Magnum Force (album)|Magnum Force]]''. The album's lead single, "I Ain't Havin' That" (sampled from the [[A Tribe Called Quest]] track "[[Hot Sex]]", with the chorus sampling [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]'s 1996 hit "Pick it Up"), became a Hot 100 hit. Despite the single's success, the album was criticized due to its lighter content. Price and Rock seemed disillusioned with their lack of sales, and split up. Rock began having problems with [[Duck Down Records]], and split with the label, signing to DJ Lethal's Lethal Records. He planned to release an album titled ''Planet Rock'', but the label folded and the album disappeared. Sean Price remained with the Camp for their second album ''[[The Chosen Few (Boot Camp Clik album)|The Chosen Few]]'' in 2002. Heltah Skeltah reunited in 2005, making appearances on Sean Price's solo album ''[[Monkey Barz]]'' and Smif-N-Wessun's ''[[Smif 'N' Wessun: Reloaded]]''. The duo continued work with the Boot Camp for their third group effort ''[[The Last Stand (Boot Camp Clik album)|The Last Stand]]'', released in July 2006. In 2007, Heltah Skeltah had a track included on the ''Official Joints'' mixtape, a collection of previously unreleased songs by NYC rappers. Heltah Skeltah dropped their third album together titled ''[[D.I.R.T. (Da Incredible Rap Team)]]'' which was released on September 30, 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.duckdown.com/website/|title = Coming Soon – Duck Down Music}}</ref> Sean Price died in his sleep on August 8, 2015. He was 43 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.35001/title.sean-price-passes-away-dj-premier-just-blaze-react|title=Sean Price Passes Away; DJ Premier & Just Blaze React|date=August 8, 2015}}</ref>

Rock had his own song called "I Am Rock", which was not used in any Heltah Skeltah albums and was prominently featured in [[Electronic Arts|EA]] video games which include ''[[NFL Street 2]]'', ''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005 video game)|Need for Speed: Most Wanted]]'', ''[[Madden NFL Arcade]]'', ''[[EA Sports UFC 2]]'', and made an appearance in the "Legends" update of the 2015 [[Need for Speed (2015 video game)|''Need for Speed'' remake]].
