That girl can sing and she sings with her heart and soul, I think that's what literally hypnotizes people. There is something iconic about her. She can be idolized not only by generations that are into heavier music but also by the kids that are growing up on pop culture".<ref>{{cite web|title = Concert Review: LA's Edge of Paradise Bring Tsunami to Hawaii | website= Metalholic.com|url = http://metalholic.com/concert-review-las-edge-of-paradise-bring-tsunami-to-hawaii/|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}</ref> ''Hard Rock Haven'' claimed, "The band can not only put on a show, but they are great songwriters as well.
