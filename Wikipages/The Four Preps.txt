'''The Four Preps''' are an [[United States|American]] [[popular music]] male quartet. In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the group amassed eight gold singles and three gold albums.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Their million-selling signature tunes included "[[26 Miles (Santa Catalina)]]", "[[Big Man (The Four Preps song)|Big Man]]", "Lazy Summer Night", and "[[Down by the Station]]".

The Four Preps' numerous television and motion picture appearances included four years backing teen heartthrob [[Ricky Nelson]] on ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' and appearing with [[Sandra Dee]] in the film ''[[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]''. The group's most recent television appearance was with the award-winning 2004 PBS special, ''Magic Moments: The Best of 50s Pop''.

The current incarnation of the Four Preps features co-founder and original lead singer Bruce Belland, Bob Duncan (formerly with the Diamonds and the Crew Cuts), Michael Redman (of the Crew Cuts), and Jim Armstrong.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blufftontoday.com/sun-city/2017-08-29/four-preps-bring-1960s-tunes-sun-city|title=The Four Preps bring 1960s tunes to Sun City|last=Wilkerson|first=DeeAnna|date=2017-08-29|work=Bluffton Today|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}</ref> Their shows are currently an amalgamation of singing everything from doo-wop to [[Tin Pan Alley]] standards and comedy.

==Original line-up==
* Bruce Belland, lead vocals (born October 22, 1936, [[Chicago, Illinois]])
* [[Ed Cobb]], bass (born February 28, 1938; died September 19, 1999)

* [[Glen A. Larson]], baritone (born January 3, 1937 [[Los Angeles, California]]; died November 14, 2014)

==History==
The four original members were students at [[Hollywood High School]] and were signed to a [[recording contract]] by [[Capitol Records]], after one of Capitol's executives saw them at a [[talent show]] at that school in 1956.<ref name="4 Preps Com Bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefourpreps.com/4_preps_wiki-bio-2017.htm |title=The Four Preps - Bio |accessdate=2020-03-26 |quote=The four original members were students at Hollywood High School and debuted in a 1954 Student Talent show. They were signed to a recording contract by Capitol Records producer Voyle Gilmore after seeing them perform at a UCLA sorority in1956. }}</ref> They had a minor [[record chart|chart]] [[hit record|hit]] that year with "Dreamy Eyes" and between 1956 and 1964 reached the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' pop charts]] with 13 different songs. In 1957 they appeared with [[Lindsay Crosby]], [[Bing Crosby]]'s son, in the television special ''[[The Edsel Show]]''.

Their biggest hit was "26 Miles (Santa Catalina)," which was written by Belland and Larson in 1957 and reached number two early the following year. The [[gramophone record|record]] sold over one million copies, earning a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Belland and Larson also wrote "Big Man", which reached number three in 1958. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], thus becoming the group's biggest hit there. The pair also composed new lyrics for the older tune "[[Down by the Station]]", which peaked at number 13 in 1960. Cobb wrote a handful of songs for the group, though not any of their chart hits; Cobb later became a noted writer and/or producer of hit material for other artists, especially [[The Standells]]' "Dirty Water", [[Brenda Holloway]]'s "[[Every Little Bit Hurts]]" and [[Gloria Jones]]' "[[Tainted Love]]," later recorded by [[Soft Cell]].  Many Four Preps records were arranged by their high school friend and piano accompanist [[Lincoln Mayorga]].<ref name="rockabilly">[http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/lincoln_mayorga.htm  Lincoln Mayorga at Black Cat Rockabilly]. Accessed January 26, 2010.</ref>

In 1959, the group appeared as themselves in the film ''[[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052847/fullcredits#cast IMDB.com]. Accessed March 25, 2012.</ref> For a short period, Don Clarke replaced Ingram while the latter finished college at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], but he rejoined the group in 1960.

The group was known for its family-friendly comedic humor in live performances. In 1960, they recorded a [[parody]] [[single (music)|single]], "More Money for You and Me," which included single parody verses of several popular songs by [[The Fleetwoods]], [[The Hollywood Argyles]], [[The Platters]], [[The Four Freshmen]], [[The Kingston Trio]] and [[Dion and the Belmonts]]. The title parody, sung to the tune of "[[Tom Dooley (song)|Tom Dooley]]," went like this:

: ''Hang down the [[The Kingston Trio|Kingston Trio]],''
: ''Hang 'em from a tall [[oak]] tree;''
: ''Eliminate the Kingston Trio;''
: ''More [[money]] for you and me.''

In 1962, they released another novelty record "The Big Draft", where they "suggest" a couple of American groups to go drafting themselves by parodying their songs. The record once again included single parody verses from popular hits of the day, this time from [[The Platters]], [[The Four Aces]], [[The Marcels]], [[The Highwaymen (folk band)|The Highwaymen]] (the folk band), and [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]] (who split with the Belmonts in 1960).

Both "More Money for You and Me" and "The Big Draft" were recorded live.

The group last appeared on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart in 1964, when "[[A Letter to The Beatles]]" charted for a total of three weeks beginning March 21, peaking at number 85 before being pulled from sale.<ref name="Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-2002">{{cite book

}}</ref> The arrival of [[The Beatles]], along with the rest of the [[British Invasion]], coincided with the decline of popularity of the Four Preps and most other folk revival groups. In 1966, [[Dave Somerville|David Somerville]], formerly of [[The Diamonds]], joined the group, replacing Cobb.  In 1969, the group disbanded, as their type of music had become less popular.  Belland and Somerville occasionally performed as a duo after the breakup.

== Later careers ==
Belland continued writing songs for other singers, as well as writing television show scripts, eventually becoming a network executive. Belland was a producer on several game shows in the 1970s for [[Ralph Edwards]] Productions.  Cobb became a [[record producer]] and [[audio engineering|sound engineer]].  He composed and produced the top-twenty hit, "[[Dirty Water]]" for [[The Standells]] in 1966 with Cobb; "[[Every Little Bit Hurts]] " for [[Brenda Holloway]]; "[[Tainted Love]]" for [[Gloria Jones]], which became a worldwide hit for [[Soft Cell]] in 1982.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Ingram became a [[commodity broker|commodities broker]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Clarke became a music teacher at Glendora High School.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Don Clarke was a music director at [[Mark Keppel High School]], Alhambra, California, from 1965 to 1967.

In the 1980s, Belland, Cobb, Somerville, and Jim Pike (formerly of [[the Lettermen]]) eventually formed a new "Four Preps" group and went on to perform.  Jim Yester, formerly of [[The Association]], replaced Pike in 1993, and the group became the "New Four Preps".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefourpreps.com/4_preps_bio-2012.htm|title=THE FOUR PREPS BIO|website=thefourpreps.com}}</ref>

In March 1999, Ingram died of a heart attack;{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Cobb died of [[leukemia]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] later the same year.

Yester, Belland and Somerville then recorded and toured for a short time as “Triple Gold – The Three Tenors of Pop” and then moved on to pursue individual opportunities. In 2004 PBS asked Bruce to put together a one shot version of the Four Preps for “Magic Moments”, a PBS Special saluting the hit makers of the 1950s. Bruce, Glen Larson, Jim Yester and David Somerville performed on that show as The Four Preps and the program has become one of Public television's biggest fund raisers. Somerville died on July 14, 2015.

Belland's daughters, Tracey Bryn Belland and Melissa Brooke Belland, followed in their father's footsteps as singers, forming a group named [[Voice of the Beehive]].
