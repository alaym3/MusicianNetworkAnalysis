==Career==

===Background and formation===
Katie White started her music career as a school-time hobby in an all-female [[punk rock|punk]] trio called TKO—short for Technical Knock Out—with two friends from Lowton School, Marion Grethe Seaman and Emma Lally. The band had minimal success, once sharing the same stage as the bands [[Steps (group)|Steps]] and [[Atomic Kitten]].<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7128858.stm|title=BBC Sound of 2008: The Ting Tings|access-date=17 May 2010 | work=BBC News | date=2 January 2008}}</ref> While De Martino was in Manchester, the pair bumped into each other and discovered they had a mutual love of [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]]. De Martino relocated to Islington Mill Studios (the Mill) in the [[Salford, Greater Manchester]] area.<ref name="Inpd1">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/tings-can-only-get-better-for-the-ting-tings-789109.html|title=Tings can only get better for The Ting Ting's|work=The Independent|date=29 February 2008|access-date=28 June 2009 | location=London}}</ref> The pair, along with friend Simon Templeman, went on to form the Portishead-influenced trio Dear Eskiimo, who signed to [[Mercury Records]]. However, due to a change of directors and managers, the management style of the record label caused them to split.<ref name="TTHist"/><ref name="MEN1">[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/music/rock_and_pop/s/1008/1008617_ting_tings__the_hottest_party_in_town.html Ting Tings – the hottest party in town] Manchester Evening News – 8 June 2007{{Dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> The experience left White and De Martino with a distrust of the music industry.

White was a barmaid at the Mill while De Martino produced tracks for various artists therein. The pair developed their sound from influences of performers at the Mill, and were inspired to form their own group, "The Ting Tings". "Ting Ting" was the name of a Chinese colleague of White at a shop, who told her that it sounded like the pronunciation of "[[bandstand]]" in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] ([[Chinese pavilion|亭]]).<ref name="TTHist">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetingtings.com/us/the-band |title=Ting Tings – History |publisher=The Ting Tings |access-date=29 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201120325/http://www.thetingtings.com/us/the-band |archive-date=1 December 2008 }}</ref> The band researched the name and found it also meant the "sound of innovation on an open mind".

Having created three songs, the band's first gig was a free-beer invite all at the Mill in their rented dwelling called "the Engine House". Subsequent gigs were funded on donations, and after their third gig they were name-checked on [[XFM]].<ref name="Inpd1"/> The Islington Mill gigs ended up as some of the most sought-after tickets on the Manchester party scene with various [[A&R]] reps and record producers, such as [[Rick Rubin]], asking for tickets.<ref name="MEN1"/>

The Ting Tings later scrapped the majority of the material from the Berlin sessions against the wishes of their label, with White explaining: "We were in Berlin where there is a great electro scene with Sian Hogan, and so we made songs like that, but quickly realised that everything on the radio was [[Europop|Euro-pop]] shite. We didn't want our record to be tarnished with that brush". De Martino added that they were angry the single "Hands" was promoted on BBC Radio 1, but had been intended by the band as "an underground, white label-only release". The band relocated to Spain, where they found influence in the music of the [[Beastie Boys]], [[Spice Girls]] and [[TLC (group)|TLC]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Copsey |first=Robert |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a363022/the-ting-tings-scrapped-album-was-s-euro-pop.html |title=The Ting Tings: 'Scrapped album was s*** Euro-pop' |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=31 January 2012 |access-date=18 February 2012}}</ref> They performed new material from the album in July 2011 at DCode Festival in Madrid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9BaqsNC0Ms |title=The Ting Tings -Silence/Hang it Up/Hit Me Down Sonny : Dcode Festival, Madrid 2011| via= YouTube |date=2011-07-13 |access-date=2013-06-28}}</ref>
