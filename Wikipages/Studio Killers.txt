==History==

===2011–2014: Formation and debut studio album===

The voices of Goldie Foxx and Dyna Mink stated that they had originally written a song for a British girl band that was dropped from their label and were put in contact with Cherry's vocalist, who wrote the lyrics and performed the song with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2013/6/Studio-Killers-are-animated-anonymous-and-unapologetic|title=Studio Killers are animated, anonymous and unapologetic|author=Matt Meuse|publisher=[[CBC Music]]|date=14 June 2013|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickkicksnare.com/2013/07/15/kks-exclusive-interview-studio-killers/ |title=KKS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Studio Killers |publisher=Kick Kick Snare |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref> The members claim that most of their correspondence is through email, although their song "Who Is in Your Heart Now?" was written when they first had a face to face meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/interview/studio-killersinterview-june-2013 |title=Studio Killers Interview |publisher=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref> The identities of the band members are unknown, and all interaction with fans is conducted via their fictional counterparts; however, it has been speculated by fans that the Finnish musician [[Teemu Brunila]] provides the voice of Cherry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Menestysbändin salattu laulaja tuleekin Suomesta – tunnistatko? – Hymy|url=http://www.hymy.fi/tasta-puhutaan/menestysbandin-salattu-laulaja-tuleekin-suomesta-tunnistatko|publisher=Otavamedia Oy|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>

They premiered in 2011 with the single "[[Ode to the Bouncer]]", about the lead singer character Cherry's difficulties in getting into a club,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scandipop.co.uk/studio-killers-ode-to-the-bouncer/ |title=– Studio Killers: ‘Ode To The Bouncer’ |publisher=Scandipop.co.uk |date=8 April 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref> and gained popularity through their music video on [[YouTube]]. The single was successful in the Netherlands, Finland, and Denmark. After releasing other singles "Eros and Apollo", "All Men Are Pigs", and "[[Jenny (Studio Killers song)|Jenny]]" through 2012 and 2013, they released their [[Studio Killers (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 2013, and followed up in 2014 with the new single "Grande Finale".
