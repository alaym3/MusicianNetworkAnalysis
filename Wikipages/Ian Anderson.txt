==Early life==
Ian Anderson was born in [[Dunfermline]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], the youngest of three brothers. His father, James Anderson, ran the RSA Boiler Fluid Company in East Port, Dunfermline.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=The Entertainers – Brothers score stage success |url=http://www.tullpress.com/dp19oct79.htm |url-status=dead |work=[[Dunfermline Press]] |publisher=TullPress.com |date=19 October 1979 |access-date=8 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311104953/http://www.tullpress.com/dp19oct79.htm |archive-date=11 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Anderson's family moved to [[Edinburgh]] when he was three.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wordpodcast.co.uk/2018/02/14/word-podcast-279-ian-anderson-celebrates-the-50th-anniversary-of-jethro-tull/|title=Word Podcast 279 – Ian Anderson celebrates the 50th anniversary of Jethro Tull – The Word Podcast}}</ref> He was influenced by his father's [[big band]] and [[jazz]] [[Gramophone record|record]]s and the emergence of rock music, but was disenchanted with the "showbiz" style of early American [[rock and roll]] stars like [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ian Anderson (2 of 11) – The Formative Years |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4mNh5fMGOg&feature=fvwrel | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/p4mNh5fMGOg| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|publisher=YouTube |access-date=2 January 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

His family moved in 1959 to [[Blackpool]], England, where he was educated at [[Blackpool Grammar School]].<ref>Nollen, Scott Allen. ''Jethro Tull: A History of the Band, 1968–2001'', p. 23. McFarland, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7864-1101-5}}</ref> In a 2011 interview, Anderson said he was asked to leave grammar school for refusing to submit to corporal punishment (permitted at that time).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVPUZZaPDYk | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/zVPUZZaPDYk| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=Ian Anderson on Studio 4 with Host Fanny Kiefer Part 1 of 2 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2 January 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He studied fine art at Blackpool College of Art from 1964 to 1966 while living in [[Lytham St Annes]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/chance-to-share-your-jethro-tull-memories-1-6922393|title=Chance to share your Jethro Tull memories|date=29 October 2014|website=www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk|access-date=9 July 2016}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
While a teenager, Anderson took a job as a sales assistant at [[Lewis's]] department store in Blackpool, then as a vendor on a news stand.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 1963, he formed The Blades from among school friends: Michael Stephens (guitar), [[John Evan]] (keyboards), [[Jeffrey Hammond]] (bass) and [[Barriemore Barlow]] (drums). This was a [[soul music|soul]] and [[blues music|blues]] band, with Anderson on vocals, guitar and harmonica – he had yet to take up the flute. They played their first show at the Holy Family Church Hall in [[North Shore, Blackpool|North Shore]].<ref name=":0" />

In late 1967, Anderson was still holding down a day job, namely cleaning the Ritz Cinema in [[Luton]], including the toilets, in the mornings, "which took me half the day" he said in a later interview. He took an old, chipped [[urinal]] from the cinema storeroom and had it for a time after leaving the job. It was not, however, the urinal which "was bolted to the side of John Evan's Hammond organ on stage" and figured in early 1970s Tull performances.<ref>Wiser, Carl, [http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/ian_anderson_of_jethro_tull/ "Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull" (interview)], ''Songfacts'', n.d. Retrieved 6 March 2013.</ref>

[[File:Jethro Tull Ian.jpg|thumb|right|Anderson performing with [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 24 March 1977]]

At this time Anderson abandoned his ambition to play electric guitar, allegedly because he felt he would never be "as good as [[Eric Clapton]]". As he himself tells it in the introduction to the video ''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'', he traded his electric guitar in for a flute which, after some weeks of practice, he found he could play fairly well in a rock and blues style. According to the sleeve notes for the first Tull album, ''[[This Was]]'' (1968), he had been playing the flute only a few months when the album was recorded. His guitar practice did not go to waste either, as he continued to play acoustic guitar, using it as a melodic and rhythmic instrument. As his career progressed, he added soprano saxophone, mandolin, keyboards and other instruments to his arsenal.

His tendency to stand on one leg while playing the flute came about by accident, as he had been inclined to stand on one leg while playing the harmonica, holding the microphone stand for balance. Anderson was known for his famous one-legged flute stance, and was once referred to as a "deranged flamingo".<ref>Hume, Paul, and Richard Harrington. "Performing Arts: Philadelphia Orchestra Jethro Tull". The Washington Post 22 November 1997: B6. WP Company LLC D/b/a The Washington Post. Web. 5 October 2014.</ref> This stance is on many album covers of Jethro Tull. During a long stint at the [[Marquee Club]], a journalist described him, wrongly, as standing on one leg to play the flute, when in fact he was originally playing the harmonica on one leg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS_PGPwWVmE | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/SS_PGPwWVmE| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=Interview With Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson (CLCI Webzine 17 March 2018) |publisher=YouTube |access-date=20 March 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He decided to live up to the reputation, albeit with some difficulty. His early attempts are visible in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' (1968) film appearance of Jethro Tull. This was referenced in the facetious liner notes for ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'' in a quote about "the one-legged pop flautist, Ian Anderson".

===Later career===
[[File:Jethro Tull 5.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Anderson with Jethro Tull at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]], March 1978]]
Anderson already wished to start a solo career in 1980, when Jethro Tull was going to take a break after [[John Glascock]]'s death. He wrote the album ''[[A (Jethro Tull album)|A]]'' as a solo record, but [[Martin Barre]] and [[Dave Pegg]]'s participation led the album to be released under the Jethro Tull name, causing the old band to split. His first official solo album was ''[[Walk into Light]]'', in 1983, in which [[Peter-John Vettese]] played an important role in the electronic direction of the music.

In the 1990s he began working with simple bamboo flutes. He uses techniques such as over-blowing and hole-shading to produce note-slurring and other expressive techniques on this otherwise simple instrument. Anderson said that around this time his daughter began taking flute lessons and noticed his fingering was incorrect, prompting him to relearn the flute with the right fingering.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://newsok.com/article/2447855/jethro-tull-flutist-reforms-technique/ |title=Jethro Tull Flutist Reforms Technique |date=1993-11-12 |access-date=2019-04-01 |language=en-US}}</ref> In 1995, Anderson released his second solo album, ''[[Divinities: Twelve Dances with God]]'', an instrumental work composed of twelve flute-heavy pieces pursuing varied themes with an underlying motif. The album was recorded with Jethro Tull keyboard player [[Andrew Giddings]] and orchestral musicians. Anderson released two further song-based solo albums, ''[[The Secret Language of Birds]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Rupi's Dance]]'' in 2003. In 2003, Anderson recorded a composition called "Griminelli's Lament", in honour of his friend, the Italian flutist [[Andrea Griminelli]].

In 2011, with the end of Jethro Tull touring, and the question of his friend [[Derek Shulman]] (whatever happened to Gerald Bostock?),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/02/jethro-tulls-ian-anderson-on-thick-as-a-brick-2-the-grammys-and-more/|title=Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson On Thick As A Brick 2, The Grammys And More - American Songwriter|work=American Songwriter}}</ref> Anderson begun to produce a sequel to ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'' (1972), titled ''[[Thick as a Brick 2]]'' or ''TAAB2'', was released on 3 April 2012. It is billed as being performed by Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson instead of being a Jethro Tull album proper. Anderson toured performing both albums in their entirety. A trailer for ''TAAB2'' was posted on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7jZMCBEsZM| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/q7jZMCBEsZM| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=Official TAAB 2 trailer|work=YouTube.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Anderson released a new album, ''[[Homo Erraticus]]'', in May 2014. He described it as a [[progressive rock]] concept album blending rock, folk, and metal music.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Peaking at No. 14 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] it is his most successful ever solo album.

In September 2017, Anderson announced plans for a tour to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of ''This Was'', and a new studio album in 2019. The band line-up includes Anderson, Hammond, Opahle, O'Hara, and Goodier (all musicians of Anderson's solo band since 2012),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gigantic.com/jethro-tull-tickets | title=Jethro Tull Tickets |access-date=29 August 2017}}</ref> with Barre absent from the lineup.

On 2 January 2018, Ian Anderson published a New Year post on jethrotull.com, including a picture of Anderson with the caption "IA in the studio working on a new album for release March 2019. Shhhh; keep it a secret..."<ref name="happynewyear">{{Cite web |url=http://jethrotull.com/happy-new-year-from-ian-anderson/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411181824/http://jethrotull.com/happy-new-year-from-ian-anderson/ |archive-date=11 April 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 1 June 2018, Parlophone Records released a new (50-track) career collection celebrating the Jethro Tull's 50th anniversary featuring all 21 Tull albums, named ''[[50 for 50]]''. In the notes of the ''50 for 50'' booklet it is said that the new album scheduled for 2019 will be a solo record by Ian Anderson and not a new album by Jethro Tull.

Interviewed in October 2019, Anderson said he planned to finish the new album by February 2020 and to release it in September 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truemetal.it/news/intervista-jethro-tull-ian-anderson-112806-p2 | title=Interview: Jethro Tull |access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref>

==Family and personal life==
Anderson is the youngest of three brothers. The oldest of the three, Robin, became administrator of [[Scottish Ballet]] in 1973.<ref name=":1" />

From 1970 to 1974, Anderson was married to [[Jennie Franks]], a photographer who is credited with some of the lyrics to the first couple of verses of the song "[[Aqualung (song)|Aqualung]]".<ref>[http://remus.rutgers.edu/JethroTull/FAQ.html#Q7 Who is Jennie Anderson, the person credited on the ''Aqualung'' album as the author of the title track?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022154806/http://remus.rutgers.edu/JethroTull/FAQ.html |date=22 October 2012 }}, Jethro Tull FAQ. Retrieved 26 October 2012.</ref>

Anderson married Shona Learoyd in 1976, described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine as a "beautiful convent-educated daughter of a wealthy wool manufacturer".<ref>{{cite web| date=21 March 1977| url=http://www.tullpress.com/p21mar77.htm| title=Rock's heaviest breather is Ian Anderson| access-date=22 April 2007| publisher=tullpress.com| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718024454/http://www.tullpress.com/p21mar77.htm| archive-date=18 July 2007| df=dmy-all}}</ref> She had studied ballet for 10 years, though when Anderson met her she was working as a press officer at Jethro Tull's record label at the time, [[Chrysalis Records]]. She later became involved with the band's on-stage special effects.

The couple have lived in a 16th-century redbrick farmhouse on the {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} Pophleys Estate in [[Radnage]], England, in Kilmarie House on their [[Strathaird Estate]] on the [[Isle of Skye]] in Scotland, as well as a short time in [[Montreux]], Switzerland. They currently live in [[Wiltshire]], England, and have a house again in Switzerland, near Montreux. They have two children: James Duncan Anderson, also a musician; and Gael, who works in the film industry and is married to actor [[Andrew Lincoln]], star of the US TV drama series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]''.<ref name="jethrotull.com">{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/ian-anderson-bio/ |title=Ian Anderson |publisher=Jethro Tull |access-date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

Anderson is a survivor of [[deep vein thrombosis]], and has done several [[public service announcement]]s to raise awareness of the disease.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://jethrotull.com/confessions-of-a-dvt-victim-and-ten-tips-for-survival/| author=Ian Anderson| title=Confessions of a DVT victim and ten steps for survival| date=3 February 2001| publisher= jethrotull.com| access-date=20 June 2011}}</ref>

Among his interests, Anderson lists protecting wild cats, especially those that have been rescued from harsh captivity; cameras, chiefly [[Leica Camera|Leica]]s; and [[Indian cuisine]] – he has written a beginner's guide, thus far published only on the internet.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://jethrotull.com/ian-andersons-guide-to-choosing-indian-food/| author=Ian Anderson| publisher= j-tull.com| title=Indian Food Guide| access-date= 22 April 2007}}</ref>

During a video interview for ''[[The Big Interview with Dan Rather]]'' in May 2020, Anderson said he was suffering from the incurable [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) after being diagnosed a number of years previously. He went on to state his belief that a likely cause of this condition has been the use of on-stage [[smoke machine]]s in live performances throughout his long career. Anderson continued medication to treat the condition, avoided areas of high pollution to avoid exacerbation of the disease, and practised breathing exercises to keep his lungs fit, stating that COPD had otherwise not yet affected his day-to-day routine.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/music/news/ian-anderson-jethro-tull-lung-disease-1234606177/ | title = Ian Anderson, Jethro Tull Frontman, Reveals He Has 'Incurable Lung Disease' | first=  J.
