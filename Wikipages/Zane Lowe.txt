'''Alexander Zane Reid Lowe''' (born 7 August 1973) is a [[New Zealand]] radio [[Disc jockey|DJ]], live DJ, record producer, and television presenter.

After an early career in music creation, production and DJing in New Zealand, he moved to the UK in 1997, coming to prominence through presenting on [[XFM]] and [[MTV Europe]] ([[MTV Two]]), before hosting a new global music show on [[BBC Radio 1]] from 2003–2015. He now hosts his own show on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s international radio station, [[Apple Music 1]]. Lowe has also developed a DJ career, with sets at various concerts and as a warm-up act for touring bands.

Both would eventually develop their careers in the UK.

==International DJ==

Lowe relocated to the UK in 1997. He initially worked at the Record and Tape Exchange in [[Notting Hill]], before being asked to cover for a show on [[XFM]], going on to host XFM's Music Response. In 2003, he joined [[BBC Radio 1]], showcasing new music from around the world.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crawley |first1=Jason |title=Lowe swaps XFM for Radio 1 |access-date=21 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114222519/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a10796/lowe-swaps-xfm-for-radio-1.html#~p3ZMkn9l0jEseS |url-status=live |archive-date=14 January 2013 |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a10796/lowe-swaps-xfm-for-radio-1.html#~p3ZMkn9l0jEseS |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=26 March 2003  }}</ref>

==Lowe on MTV {{anchor|Gonzo}}==
Lowe started his career on [[MTV UK]] before moving to [[MTV2 Europe]] (now MTV Rocks) presenting shows such as '''MTV News''' (1998-2001), MTV News Daily Edition (1999-2001) and ''Brand:New'' (1999). From 2002 to 2015, he presented ''[[Gonzo (show)|Gonzo]]'', its flagship music show. The show evolved from a two-hour random collection of presenting and clips, to a [[primetime]] (7pm) show featuring regular musical guests and interviews. The show was presented solely by Lowe, with the studio effectively being a [[Chroma key|blue screen]] and 'Brown Couch'. His presenting manner on ''Gonzo'' was more laid back than on his radio show. The show featured music videos, music news and input from the channel's message boards. The show also featured mock interview done by a character called [[Ginger Bloke]], in which popular musical artists were humorously "interviewed." Occasionally, moderators of the boards (chosen on ''Gonzo'' and by the members) contributed; one member even filled in for a week when Lowe was too unwell to present. At [[Oxegen Festival]] 2006, Zane Lowe was reportedly "beaten up" by [[Didz Hammond]] and [[Carl Barât]] from [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]] on an episode of ''Gonzo''. He has since said that the punch was in fact completely playful but unfortunately, and painfully, connected with his groin.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuhBJgxhjhI Zane Lowe on Dirty Pretty Things Bust-up]. YouTube (11 November 2006). Retrieved 9 September 2011.</ref>

==BBC Radio 1==
Lowe's [[BBC Radio 1]] evening show was broadcast from 2003 to 2015, occupying a 7-9PM timeslot on Mondays to Thursdays every week. Lowe's method of DJing was high octane and fast-paced,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/zane-lowe-radios-grand-optimist-8208358.html|title=Zane Lowe: Radio's grand optimist|date=12 October 2012|website=independent.co.uk|access-date=28 March 2018}}</ref> The show developed a number of features including "Hottest Record In The World Right Now",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Zane|title=Zane Lowe's Hottest Records|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0182w8t|website=bbc.co.ukpublisher=BBC}}</ref> "masterpieces"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Zane|title=Zane Lowe's Masterpieces|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010vstq|website=bbc.co.ukpublisher=BBC}}</ref> and the "Zane Lowe Meets" interviews, including interviews with [[Jay-Z]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Jay Z.

On 15 February 2015 it was announced that Lowe would be leaving BBC Radio 1 in March 2015 to launch a new station with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/31470124/zane-lowe-to-leave-radio-1-in-march|title = Zane Lowe to leave Radio 1 in March|date = 14 February 2015|publisher = BBC Newsbeat|access-date = 6 July 2015}}
</ref> Lowe presented his last show on 5 March 2015, bowing out with "Song for the Dead" by [[Queens of the Stone Age]], from their 2002 album ''Songs for the Deaf''.

===Masterpieces===
Between 2007 and 2012, one week per year of Lowe's show was dedicated to albums considered "masterpieces". Each show focused on a different album which Lowe and his team considered to be a classic. The first half of the show was dedicated to interviews and an in-depth look at the album's cultural impact, with the album being played in full in the second half of the show.

In 2011, during a 21 November broadcast of "Masterpieces" featuring [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], Lowe expressed his delight at securing the opportunity to play ''[[Siamese Dream]]'' in full, stating the album to be one of his favourites. Three days later, Lowe announced that 2011 could possibly be the final edition of "Masterpieces", concluding the show with "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]" from [[Jeff Buckley]]'s album ''[[Grace (Jeff Buckley album)|Grace]]'', stating that the idea of the feature originally came from the suggestion that the album ''Grace'' be played on the air from beginning to end. However, Lowe later announced that "Masterpieces" would continue in 2012, with the four chosen albums being announced on 6 November 2012. Lowe himself stated that 2012 was a slightly different year of selection, in that the team chose albums that were of "pure quality, but [haven't] necessarily featured on any traditional 'greatest albums' lists."<ref name="Zane Lowe announces his 2012 Masterpieces on Radio 1">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/zane-lowe-masterpieces.html|title=Zane Lowe announces his 2012 Masterpieces on Radio 1|publisher=BBC|access-date=10 November 2012}}</ref>

==Ryan Jarman incident==
Lowe is remembered for saving [[Ryan Jarman]]'s life at the 2006 [[NME Awards]], an incident which [[NME]] now refers to as "engraved in indie folklore".<ref name="NME 26/01/08">NME 26/01/08</ref> The incident occurred when Jarman's band, [[The Cribs]], accepted an award on behalf of winners [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]]. While on his way to collect the trophy from presenter [[Russell Brand]], Jarman dived onto the [[Kaiser Chiefs]]' table and pierced his back with broken glass, narrowly missing his vital organs.<ref name="NME 26/01/08"/> He was taken to hospital but discharged himself to return for the show's after-party later in the night. However, his injuries were severe and he fell unconscious in a back corridor. Lowe, a fellow guest at the party, found Jarman lying on the floor bleeding profusely and another ambulance was called which took Jarman to hospital where doctors stitched up the injuries along with the ones the first surgeon had missed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-cribs-252-1353078|website=nme.com|title=NME Awards star hospitalised twice in a night}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/in-case-you-missed-it-zane-lowe-has-been-making-music-for-years-and-has-worked-with-a-bunch-of-world-famous-artists-including-future|title=Zane Lowe Has Been Producing For Future, Tinie Tempah and Pretty Much Everyone|last=Bassil|first=Ryan|date=1 October 2014|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=21 June 2017}}</ref>
