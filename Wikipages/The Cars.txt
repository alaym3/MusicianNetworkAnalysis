'''The Cars''' were<!-- Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both American English and British English. Please do not change "were" to "was". --> an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Boston]] in 1976. Emerging from the [[New wave music|new wave]] scene in the late 1970s, it consisted of [[Elliot Easton]] ([[lead guitar]]), [[Greg Hawkes]] ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), [[Ric Ocasek]] ([[rhythm guitar]]), [[Benjamin Orr]] ([[bass guitar]]), and [[David Robinson (drummer)|David Robinson]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]). Ocasek and Orr shared lead vocals, and Ocasek was the band's principal songwriter.

The Cars were at the forefront of the merger of 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new [[synthesizer]]-oriented pop that became popular in the early 1980s. [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], music critic for ''The New York Times'' and ''Rolling Stone'', described the Cars' musical style: "They have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends—[[Punk rock|punk]] minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of [[art rock]], the '50s [[rockabilly]] revival and the melodious terseness of [[power pop]]—and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend."<ref name="ReferenceA">Palmer, Robert. "Pop: Cars Merge Styles" ''The New York Times'' August 9, 1978: C17</ref>

The Cars had four Top 10 hits: "[[Shake It Up (The Cars song)|Shake It Up]]" (1981), "[[You Might Think]]" (1984), "[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]" (1984), and "[[Tonight She Comes]]" (1985). The band was named Best New Artist in the 1978 ''Rolling Stone'' Readers' Poll, and won [[MTV Video Music Award|Video of the Year]] for "[[You Might Think]]" at the first [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]] in 1984. Their debut album ''[[The Cars (album)|The Cars]]'' sold six million copies and appeared on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart for 139 weeks. As of 2001, they had sold over 23 million albums in the United States.

The band disbanded in 1988 and Ocasek stated that a reunion would never occur.<ref>"Life after the Cars" ''The Cincinnati Post'' October 11, 1997: 16A</ref> Orr died in 2000 from [[pancreatic cancer]]. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with [[Todd Rundgren]] to form the spin-off band [[the New Cars]], which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs along with new material. The surviving original members reunited in 2010 to record the album ''[[Move Like This]]'', which was released in May 2011, followed by a short tour.<ref name=reunite>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/953063/the-cars-reunite-for-first-album-in-23-years The Cars Reunite for First Album in 23 Years Billboard October 21, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413082050/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/953063/the-cars-reunite-for-first-album-in-23-years |date=April 13, 2013 }}</ref>

==History==

===Early years===
Before the Cars, members of the band performed together in several different groups. Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr met in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1960s after Ocasek saw Orr performing with his band the Grasshoppers on the ''[[Upbeat (TV series)|Big 5 Show]]'', a local musical variety program. The two were in various bands in Columbus, Ohio and Ann Arbor, Michigan, then moved to Boston in the early 1970s. In Boston, Ocasek and Orr, along with lead guitarist Jas Goodkind, formed a [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills and Nash]]-style folk rock band called Milkwood. In 1973, they released one album, ''How's the Weather'', on [[Paramount Records (1969)|Paramount Records]], that failed to chart.

After Milkwood, Ocasek and Orr formed the group Richard and the Rabbits, whose name was suggested by [[Jonathan Richman]]. The band included Greg Hawkes, who had studied at the [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee School of Music]] and had played saxophone on Milkwood's album. Hawkes left to tour with [[Martin Mull|Martin Mull and His Fabulous Furniture]], a musical comedy act in which Mull played a variety of instruments. Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr then performed as an acoustic duo called simply Ocasek and Orr at the Idler coffeehouse in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some of the songs they played became early Cars songs.

Later, Ocasek and Orr teamed with guitarist Elliot Easton (who had also studied at Berklee) in the band Cap'n Swing. Cap'n Swing also featured drummer Glenn Evans, later followed by Kevin Robichaud, and a jazzy bass player, which clashed with Ocasek's more rock-and-roll leanings. Benjamin Orr was the lead vocalist and did not play an instrument. Cap'n Swing soon came to the attention of [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]] disc jockey Maxanne Sartori, who began playing songs from their demo tape on her show.

After being rejected by several record labels, Ocasek got rid of the bass player and drummer and decided to form a band that better fit his style of writing. Orr took over on bass and Robichaud was replaced by [[David Robinson (drummer)|David Robinson]], best known for his career with [[the Modern Lovers]]. Robinson had also played in [[DMZ (band)|DMZ]] and the Pop! Hawkes returned to play keyboards and the band became "the Cars", a name suggested by Robinson, whose sense of fashion had a strong influence on the band's image.

===Rise in popularity, ''The Cars'', and ''Candy-O'' (1978–1979)===
The Cars played their first show at [[Pease Air National Guard Base|Pease Air Force Base]] in New Hampshire on December 31, 1976, and spent early 1977 playing throughout New England, developing the songs that appeared on their debut album. A nine-song demo tape was recorded in early 1977 and soon "[[Just What I Needed]]" was getting heavy airplay on Boston radio stations WBCN and [[WJMN (FM)|WCOZ]].<ref>Carter Alan. ''Radio Free Boston: The Rise and Fall of WBCN''. {{ISBN|978-1-55553-729-6}}. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2013, p. 109.</ref> By virtue of that airplay, the band was offered record deals from [[Arista Records]] and [[Elektra Records]]. The band signed to Elektra, due to its lack of new wave acts, allowing the band to stand out more compared to Arista which had many new wave artists.<ref name="Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology">{{cite book|last1=Milano|first1=Brett|title=Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology|publisher=Rhino}}</ref> The band's debut album ''[[The Cars (album)|The Cars]]'' was released in June 1978, reaching No.&nbsp;18 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. "Just What I Needed" was released as the debut single from the album, followed by "[[My Best Friend's Girl (song)|My Best Friend's Girl]]" and "[[Good Times Roll]]", all three charting on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album featured multiple album tracks that received substantial airplay, such as "[[You're All I've Got Tonight]]", "[[Bye Bye Love (The Cars song)|Bye Bye Love]]", and "[[Moving in Stereo]]".

Released in June 1979, ''[[Candy-O]]'', the band's second album, was an even bigger hit peaking at No. 3 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' album chart, 15 spots higher than their debut. Featuring an album cover created by the famed ''[[Playboy]]'' artist [[Alberto Vargas]], it featured their first Top-20 single "[[Let's Go (The Cars song)|Let's Go]]". Follow-up singles "[[It's All I Can Do]]" and "[[Double Life (song)|Double Life]]" also were released, but with less success.

===Change in sound, ''Panorama'', and ''Shake It Up'' (1980–1983)===
Following the success of ''Candy-O'', the band's third studio album ''[[Panorama (The Cars album)|Panorama]]'' was released in 1980. The album, considered more experimental than its predecessors, featured only one top-40 hit with "[[Touch and Go (The Cars song)|Touch and Go]]". Although the album peaked at No. 5 in America, it did not receive the critical praise of ''The Cars'' and ''Candy-O'', with ''Rolling Stone'' describing the album as "an out-and-out drag".

In 1981, the Cars purchased Intermedia Studios in Boston, renaming it Syncro Sound.<ref>Morse, Steve. "Boston's Music Scene: A Hotbed of Rock and Roll" ''Boston Globe'' June 5, 1981</ref> The only Cars album recorded there was the band's fourth album ''[[Shake It Up (The Cars album)|Shake It Up]]'', a more commercial album than ''Panorama''. It was their first album to spawn a top-10 single with [[Shake It Up (The Cars song)|the title track]], and it included another hit in "[[Since You're Gone]]". Following their 1982 tour, the Cars took a short break and went to work on solo projects, with Ocasek and Hawkes both releasing debut albums (''[[Beatitude (album)|Beatitude]]'' and ''[[Niagara Falls (Greg Hawkes album)|Niagara Falls]]'', respectively).

===''Heartbeat City'', ''Door to Door'', superstardom, and first hiatus (1984–1988)===
The Cars reunited and released their most successful album, ''[[Heartbeat City]]'', in 1984. The first single, "[[You Might Think]]", helped the Cars win [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the first [[MTV Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]]. Other hit singles from the album included "[[Magic (The Cars song)|Magic]]", "[[Hello Again (The Cars song)|Hello Again]]", and "[[Why Can't I Have You]]". "[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]", their most successful single, with Orr on lead vocals, gained particular notability when it was used in a video of the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine]] prepared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and introduced by [[David Bowie]] at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]] in London<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book|first=Martin C.|last=Strong|year=2000|title=The Great Rock Discography|edition=5th|publisher=Mojo Books|location=Edinburgh|pages=154–155|isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> (the Cars themselves performed at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia). Actor/director [[Timothy Hutton]] directed the band's 1984 "Drive" music video.

After the resulting period of superstardom and another hit single, "[[Tonight She Comes]]", a No.&nbsp;7 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and a No. 1 hit on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Top Rock Tracks]] chart (their last No.&nbsp;1), from their ''[[Greatest Hits (The Cars album)|Greatest Hits]]'', the Cars took time off again to pursue solo projects. Easton and Orr released their debut albums (''[[Change No Change]]'' and ''[[The Lace (Benjamin Orr album)|The Lace]]'', respectively), while Ocasek released his second solo album, ''[[This Side of Paradise (Ric Ocasek album)|This Side of Paradise]]''. In 1987, the Cars released their sixth album, ''[[Door to Door (album)|Door to Door]]''. It contained their last major international hit "[[You Are the Girl]]", but the album failed to approach the success of their previous albums. The group announced their breakup in February 1988.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===Post break-up, solo careers and death of Benjamin Orr (1989–2009)===
In the late 1990s, rumors circulated of a Cars reunion, with nothing to follow after them. However, in 1995 [[Rhino Records]] released a two-CD set ''[[Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology]]'', containing all the group's hits mixed with rarities (demos and non-album B-sides). They followed up with the releases of ''[[The Cars: Deluxe Edition]]'' (1999), their debut album in a two-CD format, and ''[[Complete Greatest Hits (The Cars album)|Complete Greatest Hits]]''.

In the mid-1990s, Orr recorded tracks with guitarist John Kalishes for an unreleased follow-up to ''The Lace'' and performed with three bands: his own band ORR, the [[Voices of Classic Rock]], and Big People. Orr did appear with his former band mates one last time in an interview for a documentary about the group before his death from [[pancreatic cancer]] at age 53 on October 3, 2000.

Ocasek continued to perform as a solo artist, having released over seven studio albums. Robinson retired from music and spent most of his time working in his restaurant. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes combined their talents with [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Prairie Prince]] (the Tubes, Journey), and [[Kasim Sulton]] (Utopia, Meat Loaf) in a revamped lineup, [[the New Cars]], to perform classic Cars songs along with some new original material and selections from Rundgren's career.

In 2008, the band's first album was released for the video game ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52772 |author=Linde, Aaron |title=Cars' Self-Titled Album Hits Rock Band Next Week |publisher=Shacknews.com |date=May 20, 2008 |access-date=April 27, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808004509/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52772 |archive-date=August 8, 2010 }}</ref>

===Reunion, ''Move Like This'' and second hiatus (2010–2017)===

In 2010, the founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ric Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson placed a photo of the four members together in Millbrook Sound Studios, in Millbrook, New York, on their Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=11446_The_Cars_Hint_At_Reformation_On_Facebook |title=Photo |publisher=Undercover.com.au |date=July 25, 2010 |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922053410/http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=11446_The_Cars_Hint_At_Reformation_On_Facebook |archive-date=September 22, 2010  }}</ref> On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song, "[[Blue Tip]]", on their Facebook page. A picture of [[Jacknife Lee]] in the studio was posted on the group's Facebook page hinting that he would be producing the new Cars album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/#!/photo.php?fbid=430995919928&set=a.430995914928.193453.189146859928 |title=The Cars |publisher=Facebook |access-date=March 8, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408055255/http://www.facebook.com/ |archive-date=April 8, 2005 }}</ref>

In October ''Billboard'' reported that a new album which might be supported by a tour was being recorded at veteran engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of the new song "[[Sad Song (The Cars song)|Sad Song]]" was added to the band's Facebook page on December 7, 2010; another clip of a song called "Free" was shared on their Facebook page on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for "Blue Tip" was released February 17. The video was directed by Roberto Serrini and Eron Otcasek from The Lab NYC and features the four members of the band and NYC-based street artist Joe Iurato. According to ''Rolling Stone'', the surviving Cars mutually agreed there would be no replacing the late Benjamin Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all bass parts.<ref name="RollingStone-Reunion"/>

The new album, titled ''[[Move Like This]]'', was released on May 10 by [[Hear Music]]/[[Concord Music]] Group, debuting at No.&nbsp;7 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s album charts. It featured 10 songs in under 40 minutes.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Reviews: The cars reassemble – and prove they haven't lost a hand clap.|last=Rosen|first=J.|date=May 26, 2011|journal=Rolling Stone}}</ref> "Sad Song" was released to radio stations on March 1 as the album's first single.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musictap.net/2011/02/01/tapsheet-release-notes-02012011/ |title=TAPSheet: Release Notes – 02/02/2011 |publisher=Musictap.net |access-date=March 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620101333/http://musictap.net/2011/02/01/tapsheet-release-notes-02012011/ |archive-date=June 20, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=16774 |title=Available for Airplay 3.07-08 |magazine=FMQB |access-date=March 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926080305/http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=16774 |archive-date=September 26, 2011  }}</ref> In May 2011, the Cars went on a [[The Cars North American Tour Spring 2011|ten-city tour of the United States and Canada]]<ref name="Paste">{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/04/the-cars-announce-north-american-tour.html |title=The Cars Announce North American Tour |first=Max |last=Blau |date=April 4, 2011 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |access-date=May 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510180814/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/04/the-cars-announce-north-american-tour.html |archive-date=May 10, 2011 }}</ref> and also performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago in August. On the tour, Orr's bass parts were performed by Hawkes on keyboard and bass; the vocals on songs originally sung by Orr ("Just What I Needed", "Let's Go" and "Moving in Stereo") were performed by Ocasek. In an interview, Ocasek was asked whether the band would have reunited if Ben Orr had still been alive. Ocasek responded "Ben and I had a real cold war going that lasted about 23 years. I could never really figure out exactly why, but I think there was a lot of jealousy because I wrote the songs and I got a lot of attention. And there was all kinds of weird stuff, like he said, 'My girlfriend writes songs, let's use one of those or two of those.' I said, 'No, that's not the Cars.'"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/magazine/mag-08Talk-t.html|title=The Return of Ric Ocasek|last=Goldman|first=Andrew|date=May 6, 2011|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 10, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

The Cars once again became inactive after the tour's conclusion in 2011. On April 28, 2016, Ric Ocasek appeared on behalf of the Cars for a Q&A with SiriusXM satellite radio. 2016 also saw a release of remastered Cars music on CD and vinyl. Ocasek supervised the remastering.

===Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction and death of Ric Ocasek (2018–2019)===
After seven years of inactivity, the group reconvened, along with [[Weezer]]'s [[Scott Shriner]] on bass in Orr's stead, to play a four-song set ("You Might Think", "My Best Friend's Girl", "Moving in Stereo", "Just What I Needed") at their 2018 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Light |first1=Elias |last2=Grow |first2=Kory |title=The Cars Play Greatest Hits at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2018 Induction |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-cars-play-greatest-hits-at-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-2018-induction-628943/ |website=Rolling Stone |access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> They were introduced by [[The Killers|Killers]] frontman [[Brandon Flowers]].
