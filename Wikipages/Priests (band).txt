On December 12, 2019, Priests announced that they were going on an indefinite hiatus, releasing a statement reading in part, "We aren’t in a place to write another album together right now, and feel like each of us would be better served pursuing individual projects for the time being." They clarified that they did not intend to break up, saying that they were "not closing off the option of playing together in the future at some point if it feels right, but not for the foreseeable future."<ref name="Pitchfork Hiatus">{{cite web |last1=Strauss |first1=Matthew |title=Priests Announce Indefinite Hiatus |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/priests-announce-indefinite-hiatus/ |website=Pitchfork |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref>
