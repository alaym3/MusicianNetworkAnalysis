When he was seven years old, his sister pushed him to join a singing competition and taught him the popular [[Cliff Richard]] song '[[Bachelor Boy]]'. Even though ignorant about singing at that age, he won the competition. It was a defining moment. His school principal, Sister Mabilia, understood his passion for music and since then she never missed an opportunity to encourage him into singing and taking part in stage acts. Her favourite was the [[Boney M]] song '[[El Lute]]' -about a man wrongly imprisoned for a crime he did not commit- which he would often sing to her. He considers her as his first [[guru]] in life and a constant source of inspiration. At home, he and his cousin Piku would sing songs of [[The Beatles]], [[The Eagles]], [[Simon and Garfunkel]], [[U2]], etc. He passed out his high school from St. Anthony's College, [[Shillong]], and later attended Gauhati Commerce College for graduation.

Subramaniam]], [[A.R. Rahman]], [[Salil Chowdhury]], [[Ilaiyaraaja]], [[Bhupen Hazarika]] and [[Jayanta Hazarika]] also influenced him a lot.
