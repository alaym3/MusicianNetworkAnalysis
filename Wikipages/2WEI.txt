'''2WEI''' or '''2WEI Music''' (pronounced Zwei) is a composer team founded by Christian Vorländer and Simon Heeger in early 2016. The group is based in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tête-à-Tête with 2WEI |url=https://akkuratjournal.com/collections/frontpage/products/akkurat-journal-vol-2 |journal=Akkurat |volume=2 |page=3}}</ref> Their music has been featured in numerous movie trailers including ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' and ''[[Darkest Hour (film)|Darkest Hour]]''. 

== Background ==
Christian Vorländer and Simon Heeger have known each other since college, after which they pursued different career paths. Vorländer began working for [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Junkie XL]] in [[Los Angeles]],<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tête-à-Tête with 2WEI |url=https://akkuratjournal.com/collections/frontpage/products/akkurat-journal-vol-2 |journal=Akkurat |volume=2 |page=7}}</ref> while Heeger worked at advertising music houses like Mophonics and Yessian.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tête-à-Tête with 2WEI |url=https://akkuratjournal.com/collections/frontpage/products/akkurat-journal-vol-2 |journal=Akkurat |volume=2 |pages=7, 11}}</ref>

Vorländer returned to Germany in 2015, and in 2016 they joined forces and formed 2WEI, combining their skills from the advertising and [[film score]] music world.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tête-à-Tête with 2WEI |url=https://akkuratjournal.com/collections/frontpage/products/akkurat-journal-vol-2 |journal=Akkurat |volume=2 |page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How Hamburg's 2WEI Music Is Bringing Hollywood Scores to Adland|url=https://lbbonline.com/news/how-hamburgs-zwei-music-is-bringing-hollywood-scores-to-adland/|publisher=Little Black Book}}</ref>

Since then, the group has had a continuous success, licensing their tracks for various promotional campaigns. Most recently their tracks have been used in a series of animations created by [[YouTube]] user SAD-ist, based on events in the [[Dream SMP]], a [[Minecraft]] server dedicated to improvisational [[role-playing]]. The popularity of these animations resulted in the group providing SAD-ist with an unreleased track to use specifically for her animation, as well as providing the sound design.<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=SAD_istfied |number=1378015940898656263 |title=HEY!! Deffo give @2WEIMUSIC and @marvinbrooksii some love}}</ref>

The composer duo has had their tracks promoted to various trailer houses and music editors by Position Music, the label which they are currently working with.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tête-à-Tête with 2WEI |url=https://akkuratjournal.com/collections/frontpage/products/akkurat-journal-vol-2 |journal=Akkurat |volume=2 |page=19}}</ref> Soon after, their music was chosen to be featured in various major [[Hollywood]] movie trailers.
