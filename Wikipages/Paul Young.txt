==Early life and career==
Paul Young was born in [[Luton]], Bedfordshire, England. He has an older brother, Mark, and a younger sister, Joanne.<ref name="Home"/> As a youth, after school, he played football for the [[Vauxhall Motors]] factory and in his spare time played in several bands as a bass guitarist.

The first group for which he became lead singer was Kat Kool & The Kool Kats. In the late 1970s he joined [[Streetband]], who had one [[UK Singles Chart|Top 20 hit in the UK]], with the humorous, novelty track "[[Toast (Streetband song)|Toast]]".<ref name="Official Charts"/> In December 1979, Streetband disbanded.

The ex-Streetbanders added new recruits Dave Lathwell on guitar and Baz Watts on drums and became Q-Tips. In addition, a four piece [[brass section]] was created by Steve Farr ([[baritone saxophone]]), Richard Blanchard ([[tenor saxophone]]), Stuart Van Blandamer ([[alto saxophone]]) and Tony Hughes (trumpet), who all hailed from the [[North London]] and [[Hertfordshire]] area, while [[Electronic organ|organist]] Ian Kewley lived in [[Essex]]. Q-Tips' name derived from a well-known brand of [[cotton buds]].

Q-Tips's first rehearsals took place in November 1979. Their first concert was on 18 November 1979 at the Queens Arms Hotel in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]]. This was followed by another at the Horn of Plenty in [[St Albans]]&nbsp;-&nbsp;a regular gig for Streetband during 1978&nbsp;-&nbsp;and a total of 16 in their first month of existence. Some personnel changes occurred during the first six months, with Blanchard and Lathwell leaving the band.

By 1 April 1980, the band had recorded two tracks, "SYSLJFM (The Letter Song)", and "Having a Party", both recorded at the Livingstone Studios in [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]]. Constant touring and concert appearances had built a strong fan base by mid-1981, when the small amount of [[soul music]] covers were outnumbered by the band's own tracks.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll |title=Q-Tips |author=Huey, Steve|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The professionalism of the band had attracted the attention of several record labels, with the late [[Mickie Most]] ([[RAK Records]]) confirming on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''Round Table'' programme that Q-Tips "...are easily the best live band working at the moment". In August 1980, the British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported that Q-Tips had released their debut, eponymous album.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

In time, Garth Watt Roy replaced John Gifford on guitar,<ref name="AMG"/> and Blandamer was replaced by Nick Payne. This line-up remained for the rest of the band's career. They appeared on [[BBC Television]]'s ''In Concert'', ''[[Rock Goes to College]]'' and ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'' in the latter part of 1981.  Other television appearances included children's Saturday morning TV. Q-Tips opened for [[The J. Geils Band]], [[The Knack]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Bob Marley]] and the [[Average White Band]].

The band toured with [[After the Fire]], and supported [[The Who]] on their 12-date UK tour in 1980. In 1981, Q-Tips played the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. With poor record sales after the release of two albums and seven singles, the Q-Tips broke up in early 1982 when Paul Young signed a solo [[recording contract]] with [[Columbia Records|CBS]].<ref name="AMG"/> In late 1982 and early 1983, the brass section and drummer of Q-Tips toured with [[Adam Ant]] on the UK and US legs of his ''[[Friend or Foe (album)|Friend or Foe]]'' tour, and some remained for Ant's 1984 ''[[Strip (Adam Ant album)|Strip]]'' tour.

Young briefly teamed up again with Q-Tips for a reunion tour in 1993.<ref name="AMG"/>

==Solo career and pop stardom==
The Q-Tips disbanded in 1982, and Young was signed by [[Columbia Records]] as a solo performer.

Young's new backing band The Royal Family included keyboardist Kewley, fretless bass player [[Pino Palladino]],<ref>[http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/paul-young-and-the-royal-family/memorabilia/ Paul Young and the Royal Family memorabilia] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120919151153/http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/paul-young-and-the-royal-family/memorabilia/ |date=19 September 2012 }}.

That year, Young scored the biggest worldwide hit of his career with "[[Every Time You Go Away]]", a cover of a song from the 1980 Hall & Oates album ''Voices''. "Every Time You Go Away" topped the pop charts in the U.S., and was his biggest success in the U.S. He performed the song during the London segment of the Live Aid concert.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504968/live-aid-look-back.jhtml/ Live Aid: A Look Back At A Concert That Actually Changed The World].

He contributed to the [[Vangelis]] album ''[[Voices (Vangelis album)|Voices]]'' in 1995.
