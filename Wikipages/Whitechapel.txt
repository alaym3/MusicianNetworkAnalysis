'''Whitechapel''' is a district<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/Documents/Planning-and-building-control/Strategic-Planning/Local-Plan/Evidence-base/Evidence-base,-core-strategy,-Sep-2009/Urban-Structure-and-Characterisation-Study-pages-52-63.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 June 2019 |archive-date=28 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728135936/https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/Documents/Planning-and-building-control/Strategic-Planning/Local-Plan/Evidence-base/Evidence-base,-core-strategy,-Sep-2009/Urban-Structure-and-Characterisation-Study-pages-52-63.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> in [[East London]] and the future administrative centre of the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]. It is a part of the [[East End of London]], {{convert|3.4|mi|km|1}} east of [[Charing Cross]]. It was part of the ancient parish of [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]], Middlesex. It was split off as a separate parish in the 14th century. It became part of the [[County of London]] in 1889 and [[Greater London]] in 1965. Because the area is close to the [[London Docklands]] and east of the [[City of London]], it has been a popular place for immigrants and the working class.

The area was the centre of the London Jewish community in the 19th and early 20th century, and the location of the infamous 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888–91), some of which were attributed to the mysterious [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]]. In the latter half of the 20th century, Whitechapel became a significant settlement for the [[British Bangladeshi]] community, and has the [[Royal London Hospital]] and [[East London Mosque]].

==History==
===Before the 19th century===
[[File:Whitechapel High Street 1905.JPG|thumb|Whitechapel High Street in 1905]]
[[File:Stepney Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Whitechapel wards of Stepney Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]
Whitechapel's heart is [[Whitechapel High Street]], extending further east as [[Whitechapel Road]], named after a small [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to [[St Mary]]. The church's earliest known rector was Hugh de Fulbourne in 1329. Around 1338, it became the parish church of Whitechapel, called, for unknown reasons, [[St Mary Matfelon]]. The church was severely damaged during the Blitz and demolished in 1952, and its location and graveyard is now a [[Altab Ali Park|public garden]] on the south side of the road.<ref name="Christopher Hibbert 1983">Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert (eds) (1983) "Whitechapel" in ''The London Encyclopaedia'': 955-6</ref><ref>Andrew Davies (1990) ''The East End Nobody Knows'': 15–16</ref>

Whitechapel High Street and Whitechapel Road are now part of the [[A11 road (Great Britain)|A11 road]], anciently the initial part of the [[Roman road]] between the [[City of London]] and [[Colchester]], exiting the city at [[Aldgate]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22732 'Stepney: Communications', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 7–13] accessed: 9 March 2007</ref> In later times, travellers to and from London on this route were accommodated at the many [[coaching inns]] which lined Whitechapel High Street.<ref name="Christopher Hibbert 1983"/>

By the late 16th century, the suburb of Whitechapel and the surrounding area had started becoming 'the other half' of London. Located east of [[Aldgate]], outside the [[London Wall|City Walls]] and beyond official controls, it attracted the less fragrant activities of the city, particularly tanneries, breweries, foundries (including the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]], which later cast [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Liberty Bell]] and London's [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]]) and [[slaughterhouse]]s.

In 1680, the Rector of Whitechapel, [[Ralph Davenant]], of the parish of St Mary Matfelon, bequeathed a legacy for the education of forty boys and thirty girls of the parish; the [[Davenant Centre]] is still in existence although the [[Davenant Foundation School]] moved from Whitechapel to [[Loughton]] in 1966.

Population shifts from rural areas to London from the 17th century to the mid-19th century resulted in great numbers of more or less destitute people taking up residence amidst the industries and mercantile interests that had attracted them.

In 1797, the body of the sailor [[Richard Parker (mutineer)|Richard Parker]], hanged for his leading role in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Nore mutiny]], was given a Christian burial at Whitechapel after his wife [[exhume]]d it from the unconsecrated burial ground to which it was originally consigned. Crowds gathered to see the body before it was buried.

===19th century===
By the 1840s, Whitechapel, along with the enclaves of [[Wapping]], [[Aldgate]], [[Bethnal Green]], [[Mile End]], [[Limehouse]], [[Bow, London|Bow]], [[Bromley-by-Bow]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Shadwell]] and [[Stepney]] (collectively known today as "the [[East End of London|East End]]"), had evolved into classic ''"[[Dickensian]]"'' London, with problems of poverty and overcrowding. Whitechapel Road itself was not particularly squalid through most of this period; it was the warrens of small dark streets branching from it that contained the greatest suffering, filth and danger, such as [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]] (now a private alley but once described as "the worst street in London"<ref>[http://www.casebook.org/victorian_london/the-worst-street-in-london.html ''Ripper Casebook: 1901 The Worst Street in London''] accessed 5 May 2007</ref>), Thrawl Street, Berners Street (renamed [[Henriques Street]]), Wentworth Street, and others.

[[William Booth]] began his ''Christian Revival Society'', preaching the gospel in a tent, erected in the ''Friends Burial Ground'', Thomas Street, Whitechapel, in 1865. Others joined his ''Christian Mission'', and on 7 August 1878 the [[Salvation Army]] was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road.<ref>[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army 1878 Foundation Deed Of The Salvation Army] accessed 15 February 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525050352/http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army |date=25 May 2012 }}</ref> A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/london/attractions/whitechapel-road/a/poi-sig/1278840/358914 |access-date=14 September 2021| title=Whitechapel Road |website=Lonely Planet }}</ref>

In the [[Victorian era]] the basal population of poor English country stock was swelled by immigrants from all over, particularly Irish and Jewish. Writing of the period 1883–1884, [[Yiddish theatre]] actor [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] wrote, "The further we penetrated into this Whitechapel, the more our hearts sank. Was this London? Never in Russia, never later in the worst slums of New York, were we to see such poverty as in the London of the 1880s."<ref>Jacob Adler, ''A Life on the Stage: A Memoir'', translated and with commentary by Lulla Rosenfeld, Knopf, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|0679413510}}. p. 232–233</ref>

This endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution. In October 1888 the [[Metropolitan Police]] estimated that there were 1,200 prostitutes "of very low class" resident in Whitechapel and about 62 brothels.<ref>Donald Rumbelow (2004) ''The Complete Jack the Ripper'': 12. Penguin</ref> Reference is specifically made to them in [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s ''[[Life and Labour of the People in London]]'', specially to dwellings called [[Blackwall Buildings]] belonging to Blackwall Railway. Such prostitutes were numbered amongst the 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888–91), some of which were committed by the legendary serial killer known as '[[Jack the Ripper]]'. These attacks caused widespread terror in the district and throughout the country and drew the attention of social reformers to the squalor and vice of the area, even though these crimes remain unsolved today.<ref>Nicholas Connell (2005) ''Walter Dew: The Man Who Caught Crippen'': 7–55</ref>

The "Elephant Man" [[Joseph Merrick]] (1862–1890) became well known in Whitechapel – he was exhibited in a shop on the Whitechapel Road before being helped by [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]] (1853–1923) at the [[Royal London Hospital]], opposite the actual shop. There is a museum in the hospital about his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/seven-places-in-london-connected-with-the-elephant-man-020117|title=Seven places in London connected with the Elephant Man|website=Time Out London|language=en|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref>

===20th century===
In 1902, American author [[Jack London]], looking to write a counterpart to [[Jacob Riis]]'s seminal book ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'', donned ragged clothes and boarded in Whitechapel, detailing his experiences in ''[[The People of the Abyss]]''. Riis had recently documented the astoundingly bad conditions in large swathes of the leading city of the United States.

[[File:Winston Churchill at the Siege of Sidney Street, 3 January 1911.jpeg|thumb|Home Secretary Churchill observing the events at Sidney Street, Whitechapel and Stepney]]

The [[Siege of Sidney Street]] in January 1911 was a gunfight between police and military forces, and Latvian revolutionaries. Then Home Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] took over the operation, and his presence caused a political row over the level of his involvement during the time. His biographers disagreed and claimed that he gave no operational commands to the police,{{sfn|Addison|2014}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2012|p=195}} but a Metropolitan Police account states that the events of Sidney Street were "a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions".{{efn|Subsequent stories that a bullet passed through Churchill's top hat are apocryphal, and no reference to such an occurrence appears in either the official records, or Churchill's accounts of the siege.{{sfn|Waldren|2013|p=11}}}}

The [[Freedom Press]], a socialist publishing house, thought it worthwhile to explore conditions in the leading city of the nation that had invented modern capitalism. He concluded that English poverty was far rougher than the American variety. The juxtaposition of the poverty, homelessness, exploitive work conditions, prostitution, and infant mortality of Whitechapel and other East End locales with some of the greatest personal wealth the world has ever seen made it a focal point for leftist reformers and revolutionaries of all kinds, from [[George Bernard Shaw]], whose [[Fabian Society]] met regularly in Whitechapel, to [[Vladimir Lenin]], led rallies in Whitechapel during his exile from Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/first-thursdays/galleries/first-thursday-gallery-46/|title=First Thursday GALLERY 46|website=Whitechapelgallery.org|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref> The area is still home to Freedom Press, the anarchist publishing house founded by [[Charlotte Wilson]].

In Sunday 4 October 1936, the [[British Union of Fascists]] led by [[Oswald Mosley]] clashed in the East End including a part of southern Whitechapel on [[Cable Street]] with various [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] demonstrators, including local [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Communism|communist]] groups during the [[Battle of Cable Street]] where Mosley planned to send thousands of marchers dressed in uniforms styled on those of [[Blackshirts]] through the East End, which then had a large [[Jews|Jewish]] population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15171772|title=Cable Street: 'Solidarity stopped Mosley's fascists'|work=BBC News|access-date=13 October 2015}}</ref>

Whitechapel remained poor (and colourful) through the first half of the 20th century, though somewhat less desperately so. It suffered great damage in [[the Blitz]], including the destruction of the parish church, [[St Mary Matfelon]] on December 29th 1940, and from the subsequent [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[V-weapons|V-weapon]] attacks. Since the war, Whitechapel has lost most of its notoriety.

[[Altab Ali]] was murdered by three teenagers on 4 May 1978 in a racist attack at St Mary's Gardens by St Mary's Churchyard as he walked home after work. The reaction to his murder provoked the mass mobilisation of the Bengali community locally and came to represent the self-organisation of the community. The gardens of the churchyard were later renamed [[Altab Ali Park]] in his memory.

The [[Metropolitan line]] between Hammersmith and Whitechapel was withdrawn in 1990 and shown separately as a new line called the [[Hammersmith & City line]].{{sfn|Rose|2007}}<ref name="T90">{{cite web|title=London Underground map 1990|url=http://www.clarksbury.com/cdl/maps/tube90.jpg|work=The London Tube map archive|access-date=21 November 2012}}</ref>

Whitechapel Road was the location of two 19th-century theatres: The Effingham (1834–1897) and [[Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel|The Pavilion Theatre]] (1828–1935; building demolished in 1962). [[Charles Dickens Jr.]] (eldest child of [[Charles Dickens]]), in his 1879 book ''[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]'', described the Pavilion this way: "A large East-end theatre capable of holding considerably over 3,000 persons. Melodrama of a rough type, farce, pantomime, [[et cetera|<!--SIC, &c.-->&c.]]"<ref>{{cite web|author=Dickens, Charles Jr.|year=1879|title=Pavilion Theatre|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-p.htm|access-date=22 August 2007|author-link=Charles Dickens Jr.}}
</ref> In the early 20th century it became the home of Yiddish theatre, catering to the large Jewish population of the area, and gave birth to the Anglo-Jewish 'Whitechapel Boys' avant-garde literary and artistic movement.

Since at least the 1970s, Whitechapel and other nearby parts of East London have figured prominently in London's art scene. Probably the area's most prominent art venue is the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]], founded in 1901 and long an outpost of high culture in a poor neighbourhood. As the neighbourhood has gentrified, it has gained citywide, and even international, visibility and support. From 2005 the gallery underwent a major expansion, with the support of £3.26&nbsp;million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The expanded facility opened in 2009.

Whitechapel in the early 21st century has figured prominently in London's punk rock/skuzz rock scene, with the main focal point for this scene being Whitechapel Factory and Rhythm Factory bar/restaurant/nightclub. This scene includes the likes of The Libertines, Zap!, [[Nova (Italian band)|Nova]], [[The Others (band)|The Others]], Razorlight, and The Rakes, all of whom have had some commercial success in the music charts.

===Demographics===
[[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshis]] are the most visible migrant group today, who make up 40% of the Whitechapel ward total population.<ref name=BanPop>{{NOMIS2011|id=1237320252|title=Whitechapel 2011 Census Ward|access-date=9 February 2018}}</ref> The [[East London Mosque]] at the end of Whitechapel Road is a major symbol of the resident Islamic community. The mosque group was established as early as 1910, and the demand for a mosque grew as the [[Sylhet]]i community grew rapidly over the years.

In 1985 this large, purpose built mosque with a dome and minaret was built in the heart of Whitechapel, attracting thousands of worshippers every week, and it was further expanded with the [[London Muslim Centre]] in 2004.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonmosque.org.uk/?page=history History of East London Mosque] East London Mosque & London Muslim Centre. Retrieved 24 April 2009.</ref> The [[Altab Ali Park]] near [[Adler Street]] was formerly a church site but was destroyed during the Blitz. It was renamed to 'Altab Ali Park' in memory of a Bangladeshi clothing worker who was the victim of a racially motivated murder on 4 May 1978, and of other victims of racist attacks during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/wkaldgateroute.htm |title=Aldgate |publisher=London-footprints.co.uk |access-date=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwrite.org.uk/londonbehindthescenes/bricklane/altabalipark.html |title=Brick Lane Tour :: Stop 10: Altab Ali Park |publisher=Worldwrite.org.uk |date=4 May 1978 |access-date=29 April 2014}}</ref>

===In literature===
Whitechapel features in [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Pickwick Papers]]'' (chapter 22) as the location of the Bull Inn, where the Pickwickians take a coach to [[Ipswich]]. En route, driving along Whitechapel Road, [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] opines that it is "not a wery nice neighbourhood" and notes the correlation between poverty and the abundance of oyster stalls here.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/etexts/dickens/pickwick-0022.shtml |access-date=14 September 2021| title=The Pickwick Papers  |chapter=Chapter XXII Mr. PICKWICK JOURNEYS TO IPSWICH AND MEETS WITH A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE WITH A MIDDLE-AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL-PAPERS | author=Charles Dickens | year=1836}}
</ref> One of [[Fagin]]'s dens in Dickens's ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' was located in Whitechapel and Fagin, himself, was possibly based on a notorious local [[fence (criminal)|'fence']] named [[Ikey Solomon]] (1785–1850).

Whitechapel is also the setting of several novels by Jewish authors such as ''Children of the Ghetto'' and ''The King of Schnorrers'' by [[Israel Zangwill]] and ''Jew Boy'' by [[Simon Blumenfeld]]. Several chapters of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s classic [[Yiddish]] novel ''[[Adventures of Mottel the Cantor's Son]]'' take place in early 20th-century Whitechapel, depicted from the point of view of an impoverished East European Jewish family fleeing the pogroms. The novel ''[[Journey Through a Small Planet]]'' by [[Emanuel Litvinoff]] vividly describes Whitechapel and its Jewish inhabitants in the 1920s and 1930s.

The prostitute and daughter of a [[Luddite]] leader Sybil Gerard, main character of [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s novel [[The Difference Engine]] comes from Whitechapel. The novel's plot begins there.

One of the episodes in [[Michael Moorcock]]'s novel ''[[Breakfast in the Ruins]]'' takes place in 1905 Whitechapel, described from the point of view of an eleven year old [[Polish Jews|Jewish refugee from Poland]], working with his parents at a [[sweatshop]], who is caught up in the deadly confrontation between Russian revolutionaries and agents of the [[Okhrana|Czar's Secret Police]].

''Brick Lane'', the 2003 novel by [[Monica Ali]] is based in Whitechapel and documents the life of a young Bangladeshi woman's experience of living in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Whitechapel is used as a location in most [[Jack the Ripper fiction]]. One such example is the bizarre ''White Chappel Scarlet Tracings'' (1987) by [[Iain Sinclair]].<ref>Glinert, Ed (2000). ''A Literary Guide to London''. London: Penguin. Page 256.</ref> It also features as the setting for the science fiction [[Webcomic]] ''[[FreakAngels]]'', written by popular comics writer [[Warren Ellis]].

Whitechapel is one of the worldwide locations referenced in [[Edith Piaf]]'s song ''C'est a Hambourg'' [https://www.google.co.il/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02PwU2vEUrq71kz2idNxlAhbeJzjQ%3A1599481773385&ei=rSdWX7PdFofgkgXXtK6wCQ&q=edith+piaf+c%27est+a+hambourg+lyrics&oq=%22Edith+piaf%22+%2B+C%27est+%C3%80+Hamburg+lyrica&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQARgAMgYIABAWEB46CAghEBYQHRAeOgYIABANEB5QkBhYoHFg8IABaABwAHgAgAGkAYgBiA6SAQQwLjEzmAEAoAECoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&sclient=psy-ab], describing the harsh life of prostitutes.

In 2002, Whitechapel was used as the setting for a [[Sherlock Holmes]] film, ''[[The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire]]'', based on the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] story ''[[The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire]]''.

Whitechapel serves as the setting for the television series ''[[Ripper Street]]'', which aired 2013–2016.
