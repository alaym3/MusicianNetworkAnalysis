Each episode of ''Content Cop'' has been dubbed as an "event" by fellow YouTube commentators, with every new episode sparking controversy. From December 2015 to April 2017, iDubbbz released ''Content Cop'' episodes on a wide variety of YouTube personalities, including [[Keemstar]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o3TfHjj_e4&t=546s|title=Content Cop – KEEMSTAR|last=iDubbbzTV|date=May 5, 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref> [[LeafyIsHere]],<ref name="Leafboi">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21020323/youtube-policy-harassment-cyberbullying-drama-pewdiepie-steven-crowder|title=YouTube is growing up, and creators are frustrated by growing pains

Ian's first Content Cop was released in December 2015 and targeted [[Reaction video|reaction YouTuber]] Jinx Reload.<ref>{{Citation|last=iDubbbzTV|title=Content Cop – Busting JINX RELOAD|date=December 13, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrhWjEoRuBA|access-date=February 27, 2018}}</ref>

In May 2016, iDubbbz released a ''Content Cop'' video on Daniel Keem, better known as Keemstar, and his channel DramaAlert. The video has over 32 million views on YouTube as of May 2021. In the video, iDubbbz accused Keemstar of threatening big YouTubers with negative coverage and promoting small channels or accusing them of hiding something. He called Keemstar a "very rash decision maker" and showed clips of Keem saying what he called "really regrettable shit". In response, Keem called the ''Content Cop'' video "entertaining" and denied wanting to attack other YouTubers, saying he has "no problem booking guests or landing exclusive interviews". He also apologized for the comments and incidents he caused, but "justified" saying '[[nigger]]' by (jokingly) using a [[genealogical DNA test]] to show he is nine percent black.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lorenz|first1=Taylor|title=How DramaAlert Became the TMZ of YouTube|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-drama-alert-became-the-tmz-of-youtube|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=January 27, 2018|language=en|date=January 18, 2018}}</ref>

On April 6, 2017, YouTuber and rapper Bryan Le, known online as RiceGum, stated in a video that he would like to have a Content Cop made on him, stating: "I don't really care, but I kind of really want him to make one on me".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ricegum/status/850117415115476992?lang=en|title=RiceGum on Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref> In October 2017, iDubbbz uploaded a video titled "Content Cop – Jake Paul", which has over 50 million views as of May 2021. However, the 31-minute video was not about the YouTube personality [[Jake Paul]], instead it was about RiceGum. In the video, iDubbbz called him "Asian Jake Paul", explaining that he didn't want to give RiceGum the satisfaction of having his name in the title or his face in the thumbnail. iDubbbz proceeded to analyze and criticize him in a format inspired by the [[seven deadly sins]].<ref name="dailydot1"/> To coincide with the episode of ''Content Cop'', iDubbbz released a music video for a new [[diss track]] titled "[[Asian Jake Paul]]", which has over 85 million views as of August 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQpKb0U800I&t=126s|title=Asian Jake Paul (feat.

The song peaked at number 24 on the [[Billboard charts#R&B/Hip-Hop|R&B/Hip-hop Digital Song Sales]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/boyinaband/chart-history/r-and-b-hip-hop-digital-song-sales/song/1048090|title=Boyinaband Asian Jake Paul Chart History|website=Billboard}}</ref> RiceGum responded with several videos, including "[[List of most-disliked YouTube videos|Frick Da Police]]", a response diss track, and a 22-minute video response. The ''Content Cop'' video gained 20 million views in the first two weeks from its release, leading to backlash towards RiceGum for past comments towards a rape victim, to whom he apologized. iDubbbz responded with a follow-up video titled "Content Deputy – AJP" rebutting RiceGum's responses, featuring a comedic cameo by rapper [[Post Malone]], and stating that this would be his final response to the situation.<ref name="dailydot1"/> 

In late 2019, three years after Ian's ''Content Cop'' episode on LeafyisHere, YouTube removed the video as a consequence of the website's updated policies on harassment and bullying.<ref name="Leafboi" /><ref name="Vox">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/12/13/21012611/youtube-coppa-changes-harassment-policy-backlash|title=YouTube just made sweeping positive changes to its harassment policy.
