'''Sebastián Obando Giraldo''' (born 15 October 1994), known professionally as '''Sebastián Yatra''', is a [[Colombians|Colombian]] singer and songwriter. He began as a Latin pop artist and has recorded many [[ballad]]s, but has released several successful reggaeton singles. Yatra is noted for his romantic lyrics, melding traditional lyricism with modern reggaeton influences. He rose to prominence in [[Latin America]] in 2016 when he released the hit "Traicionera". He has released two studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career.

Born in [[Medellín]] and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career. He achieved breakout success with "Traicionera" followed by "[[Robarte un Beso]]" featuring [[Carlos Vives]]. "Traicionera" served as the lead single for his 2018 debut album, ''Mantra'', which also featured the single "Sutra", featuring Puerto Rican rapper [[Dalmata]]. He then released the album ''Fantasia'' including the lead single "Un Año" featuring Mexican band [[Reik]]. He received continued success collaborating with [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Natti Natasha]], and the [[Jonas Brothers]] on the bilingual single "[[Runaway (Sebastián Yatra, Daddy Yankee and Natti Natasha song)|Runaway]]".

I did a trap record called 'Como Si Nada' with this guy Calle and the rap he does is mind-blowing. | source =– Yatra, on his 2018 album ''Mantra''.<ref name=vibe/>}}
Yatra released the album ''Mantra'' on May 18, 2018. On the album's title, he explained, “My mantra are my songs. It takes you to that good energy with whatever you’re listening to. All these songs have these positive vibes, especially in the lyrics. They’re just sharing love."<ref name=vibe/> In 2018, Yatra voiced the character Migo in the Spanish language version of the computer-animated film ''[[Smallfoot (film)|Smallfoot]]''.<ref name=smallfoot>{{cite web|url=https://www.sungazette.com/life/showcase/2018/10/smallfoot-is-thoughtful-entertaining-with-a-big-message/|title= ‘Smallfoot’ is thoughtful, entertaining with a big message|last=Deitrick|first=Quinn|work=Williamsport Sun-Gazette|date=October 3, 2018|access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref> He released the single "Sutra" featuring Puerto Rican reggaeton artist [[Dalmata]] in March 2018, which also peaked at number 26 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Songs.<ref name=charthistory/>

Instead of telling people it was awesome, we told everyone that the collaboration sucked and having everyone say, ‘Dude you guys messed up the song so bad.’”<ref name=vibe/> Artists [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]], [[Zion Y Lennox]], and J Balvin publicly commented on the "rivalry".<ref name=vibe/> The music video features a playful nod at the artificial feud, with the artists competing over love interests.<ref name=vibe/>

In January 2019, Sebastián Yatra and Reik launched a collaborative work titled “Un Año” (one year). The single was well-received by many Venezuelan migrants who identify the song lyrics with separations from families.<ref>{{Cite web|title= "Un año": Canción de Sebastián Yatra y Reik con la que se identificaron los venezolanos|URL = http://www.ntn24.com/entretenimiento/venezuela/un-ano-cancion-de-sebastian-yatra-y-reik-con-la-que-se-identificaron-los|access-date= 2019-01-20}}</ref> The single was released alongside his new album ''Fantasia'' which was released in April 2019. Despite releasing several reggaeton-influenced songs prior to releasing the album, the majority of the twelve tracks on ''Fantasia'' have been classified as ballads. Yatra commented, "I started my career as a balladeer. I listened to [[Luis Fonsi]], [[Reik]], [[Alex Ubago]] and [[Michael Bublé]]. I'm very grateful for all the urban things I've done but I did not want to lose my essence."<ref name=fantasiasongs>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8506907/sebastian-yatra-fantasia-songs-interview|title= Sebastian Yatra Shares the Inspiration Behind 7 Key Tracks on New Album 'Fantasia'|last=Fernandez|first=Suzette|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=April 12, 2019|access-date=December 6, 2019}}</ref> ''Fantasia'' has been nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album|Best Latin Pop Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref name=grammynom>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/arts/music/grammy-nominations.html|title=Grammy Nominations 2020: See the List|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[A.

==Artistry==
Yatra's music has been classified as Latin pop, reggaeton, and [[ballads]]. According to ''The Fader'', Yatras music lands "somewhere in between the olden times’ sappy romantics and the new wave’s sensuous vibras."<ref name=fader/> He is influenced by Latin pop and reggaeton artists [[Ricky Martin]], [[J Balvin]], [[Juanes]], and [[Reik]].<ref name=billboardfishing/><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.etonline.com/enrique-iglesias-and-ricky-martin-announce-joint-tour-142521| title=Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin Announce Joint Tour| access-date=March 5, 2020 |date=March 4, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''Billboard'', he expressed a desire to collaborate with Italian opera singer [[Andrea Bocelli]].<ref name=billboardfishing/> Yatra believes that contemporary musicians commit an "error in associating ballads with boring and slow and old", and hopes to rejuvenate intererest in ballads for a younger audience.<ref name=vibe/> However, his music contains elements of other genres; Desire Thompson of ''Vibe'' described his song "Traicionera" as a "trap-EDM blend".<ref name=vibe/>

Despite growing up in Florida and being fluent in English, Yatra sings almost exclusively in Spanish. Yatra explains, “My goal was always to be a singer in Spanish. And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve.”<ref name=thingstodo/> His June 2019 song "Runaway" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting.<ref name=runawayjonas/> In December 2019, he collaborated with [[South Korea]]n boy group [[Monsta X]] for the song "Magnetic", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in [[Spanglish]].<ref name=monstaxteenvogue>{{cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/monsta-x-sebastian-yatra-magnetic-music-video|title=Monsta X and Sebastian Yatra Release "Magnetic" Music Video|work=Teen Vogue|last=Delgado|first=Sara|date=December 20, 2019|access-date=May 8, 2020}}</ref> Sara Delgado of ''Teen Vogue'' called the song a "truly international pop hit".<ref name=monstaxteenvogue/>
