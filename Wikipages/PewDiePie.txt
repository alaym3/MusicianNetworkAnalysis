Kjellberg's popularity on YouTube and extensive media coverage have made him one of the most noted online personalities and [[content creation|content creators]]. He has been portrayed in the media as a figurehead for YouTube and as being almost synonymous with YouTube gaming. In 2016, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named him as one of [[Time 100|the world's 100 most influential people]].

Born and raised in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]], Kjellberg registered his YouTube channel "PewDiePie" in 2010, primarily posting Let's Play videos of [[Survival horror|horror]] and [[action video games]]. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity in the following years, being one of the fastest growing channels in 2012 and 2013, and becoming the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed on YouTube]] on 15 August 2013. Over time, his style of content diversified to include [[vlog]]s, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and [[music video]]s. From 2015 to 2018, his content also shifted away from Let's Play content and became increasingly subject to media controversies.

In 2019, following a [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|public competition]] with Indian record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], Kjellberg was overtaken as the most-subscribed YouTube channel. His channel currently holds the title of the fourth-most subscribed, albeit remaining the most-subscribed operated by an individual. Kjellberg had the [[List of most-viewed YouTube channels|most-viewed channel on YouTube]] from 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, and the channel currently ranks as the 24th-most-viewed, and the sixth among those operated by an individual.

=== YouTube Red, Revelmode, and style change (2015–2017) ===
''The New York Times'' retrospectively noted that around 2015, Kjellberg's video content experienced a change in style: "he began to take more risks. He continued playing video games, but he started experimenting. He did viral challenges, made fun of other YouTubers, and reviewed meme submissions from his fans."<ref name="Roose2019b" /> Kjellberg has attributed his content around this time as a result of immaturity, boredom with playing video games, YouTube's platform incentives, and the belief that his channel's growth had plateaued.<ref name="Roose2019b" /> One video cited as being representative of this change featured Kjellberg reading erotic fan fiction about characters from the Disney film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''. Then-CEO of [[The Walt Disney Company]] [[Bob Iger]] was reportedly angered by the video, putting Kjellberg's deal with Maker Studios, a Disney subsidiary, in jeopardy.<ref name="Roose2019b" />

During September 2015, Kjellberg teased about having a role in a [[web television]] series, stating that he was in [[Los Angeles]] for the show's shooting.<ref>{{cite web |last=Acuna |first=Kirsten |title=It looks like YouTube's biggest star is filming a new mystery project in LA |work=[[Tech Insider]]|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|url=http://www.techinsider.io/pewdiepie-tv-show-2015-9 |date=14 September 2015 |access-date=23 October 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030051913/http://www.techinsider.io/pewdiepie-tv-show-2015-9 |archive-date=30 October 2015 }}</ref> Although not many details were revealed at the time, it was later announced that the series would be an original [[YouTube Premium|YouTube Red]] series titled ''[[Scare PewDiePie]]''.<ref name="Sarkar2015">{{cite web |last=Sarkar |first=Samit |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/10/21/9584414/scare-pewdiepie-youtube-red-skybound-entertainment-maker-studios |title=PewDiePie is getting a reality series on YouTube's new ad-free subscription service |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=21 October 2015 |access-date=23 October 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116200738/http://www.polygon.com/2015/10/21/9584414/scare-pewdiepie-youtube-red-skybound-entertainment-maker-studios|archive-date=16 November 2016 }}</ref> The series premiered the following February.<ref name=Popper2016a>{{cite web|last=Popper|first=Ben|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/10/10958434/scare-pew-die-pie-youtube-red-original|title=Can PewDiePie grow up without alienating his fans?|work=[[The Verge]]|date=10 February 2016|access-date=1 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801124729/https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/10/10958434/scare-pew-die-pie-youtube-red-original|archive-date=1 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 21 June, Kjellberg launched ''Gaming Week'', during which he would focus on uploading [[Let's Play]] videos every day for the first time in several years.

Lev Grossman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' noted that "he's totally unpolished, but at the same time his timing is consistently spot-on," adding that "most of the critical literature about PewDiePie focuses on the bad language and crude physical humor–and admittedly there are a lot of both–and the fact that he is, at the end of the day, just a guy playing video games and yelling."<ref name="Grossman2016" /> Walker wrote Kjellberg's "chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity."<ref name="Walker14" /> Justin Charity of ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' stated, "PewDiePie isn't a comedian in any conventional sense," but described his "hosting style [as] loopy and irreverent in the extreme: He's a little bit stand-up, a little bit shock jock, a little bit [[4chan]] bottom-feeder."<ref name="Charity2017">{{cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/2017/9/11/16292206/pewdiepie-racism-gaming-dmca-shift|title=Can Copyright Law Bring Down PewDiePie?|last=Charity|first=Justin|date=11 September 2017|work=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803163711/https://www.theringer.com/2017/9/11/16292206/pewdiepie-racism-gaming-dmca-shift|archive-date=3 August 2018|access-date=3 August 2018}}</ref>

In regards to his early Let's Play content, Swedish columnist Lars Lindstrom commented positively, stating that "Felix Kjellberg [having] a comic talent is indisputable. It is both amazingly awful and amazingly funny when a father bikes around with his son in the game ''[[Happy Wheels]]'' and both get crushed and bloody again and again and PewDiePie improvises absurd comments as the game continues.

Following the controversy regarding alleged anti-Semitic content in his videos, many media publications both in and outside of the gaming and tech industries severely criticised Kjellberg's content.

== Public image and influence ==
Since breaking through on YouTube with his [[Let's Play]]-styled videos, Kjellberg has emerged as one of the most noted and influential online personalities. He has also been cited by various publications as largely influential for digital content creation and Internet culture, particularly relating to video gaming subcultures. ''[[Eurogamer]]'' noted that Kjellberg was cast by media reports as a "figurehead" of YouTubers, and for being nearly synonymous with gaming YouTubers in general.<ref name="Phillips2016" /> In 2016, Douglas Holt of ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' wrote of Kjellberg as "YouTube's greatest success", and regarded him, about gaming subcultures, "the star of this digital art world—just as [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] and [[Patti Smith]] had done in [[urban art]] worlds back in the analog days".<ref name="Holt2016" /> Lev Grossman of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] wrote that Kjellberg dominated "an entire medium single-handed," and pioneered "a new form of fame not controlled or manufactured by a studio or a network."<ref name="Grossman2016" />

In September 2014, Rob Walker of ''[[Yahoo!]]'' called Kjellberg's popularity "insane", writing, that it "strikes me as considerably more curious&nbsp;– I mean, you know who [[Rihanna]] is, but would you recognize this kid if he was standing in line behind you at the bank?"<ref name="Walker14">{{cite web |last=Walker |first=Rob |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/pewdiepie-truly-why-96476190194.html |title=PewDiePie Is the Most Popular YouTube Star in the World.

He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly more than willing to make fun of himself in the process."<ref name="Walker14" /> In 2015, Ross Miller of ''The Verge'' wrote, "Love it or hate it, his success&nbsp;– like so many other YouTube personalities&nbsp;– isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience.

In the wake of the ''Wall Street Journal'' controversy, John Herman of ''The New York Times'' commented that "[Kjellberg] bemoaned [YouTube's] structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules.
