'''Marie Helen Sjöholm''' ({{IPA-sv|hɛˈleːn ˈɧø̌ːhɔlm}};{{citation needed|reason=accent 2?|date=August 2018}} born 10 July 1970) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] singer, actress and [[musical theatre]] performer who lives in [[Gamla Enskede]] in [[Stockholm]]. She grew up in [[Sundsvall]] and started to sing in choirs at an early age, working, among others, with Swedish conductor [[Kjell Lönnå]]. By the end of the 1980s she toured with the group "Just for Fun".

==Career==
Her career as a performer of musical theatre began with small-scale concert presentations of ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', in which she sang the role of Florence. She took part in a number of smaller productions, including ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' in [[Enskede-Årsta-Vantör|Enskede]] and the musical ''Elvira Madigan'' at Malmö Music Theatre in [[Malmö]], Sweden.

Her big breakthrough occurred in 1995 when she created the title role in [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Björn Ulvaeus]]' ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'', which she played on and off for nearly four years (during the musical's entire run). ''[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star and Tribune]]'' in its review of the concert version of the musical performed by the original cast in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] in 1996 described her as "extraordinary" (14 October 1996, page 05B). In 1998, she played Hodel in ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', taking a break from ''Kristina''. In 2000, she returned to Malmö Music Theatre to portray the role of [[Fantine]] in ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', and in 2002 she created the role of Florence in the reconceived Swedish production of ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', opposite original London star [[Tommy Körberg]] as Anatoly. Having left this production upon closing in 2003, Sjöholm took part in Chinarevyn, a revue starring many well-known Swedish performers including [[Magnus Härenstam]], [[Lasse Berghagen]], [[Loa Falkman]], [[Sissela Kyle]] and herself.

Helen Sjöholm has also toured extensively throughout Sweden with [[Georg Wadenius]] and Martin Östergren and she has released two albums, ''Visor'' (2002) (a collection of more or less well-known Swedish folk songs in new arrangements by Östergren) and ''Genom varje andetag'' (2003) (featuring music and lyrics by jazz pianist [[Anders Widmark]]).

She first appeared on the big screen in 1999, appearing in ''Där regnbågen slutar'' by [[Richard Hobert]]. In 2004, she returned to the movies, portraying the role of Gabriella in [[Kay Pollak]]'s much-debated ''[[As It Is in Heaven|Så som i himmelen]]'' (''As It Is in Heaven'').

She is also a frequent performer with [[Benny Andersson]]'s band, [[Benny Anderssons Orkester]] (BAO), singing mostly dance music and music by Andersson. Additionally, she has appeared in numerous gala concerts including ''Rhapsody in Rock''.

On 4 July 2009, Helen performed as lead female singer with the Benny Andersson Band (the name by which BAO is known outside Sweden) at a free concert on [[Hampstead Heath]] in [[London]] to mark Sweden's presidency of the [[European Union|EU]]. The concert comprised a mixture of BAO classics, traditional Swedish folk, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], old British pub singalong [[Beer Barrel Polka|Roll Out the Barrell]], [[ABBA]] and even ''Cadillac'' by the [[Hep Stars]].

An English album by the Benny Andersson Band was released on 6 July 2009 with some of the Swedish original songs having been translated into English and a new song (''Story of a Heart'') which is also the title of the album. The song was first played on 25 May 2009 on [[BBC Radio 2]] on ''The Ken Bruce show presented by Zoë Ball'' and after received significant airplay on the station, including being added to the station's A-list.

On 11 June 2009, it was announced that Helen would perform in the English version of ''Kristina från Duvemåla'' (outside Sweden called ''Kristina'') in a concert version of the musical at [[Carnegie Hall]], [[New York City|New York]], on 23 and 24 September 2009. She sang as her previous title character while [[Russell Watson]] sang as Karl Oskar. She received standing ovations on both nights for her rendition of ''You Have to Be There'' (''Du måste finnas''). The concerts themselves in the main received rave reviews, with a CD release of the live recording issued in May 2010.

Hit recordings include "Du måste finnas" ("You Have to Be There") from the symphonic musical ''Kristina från Duvemåla'' (''Kristina''), "Vår sista dans" ("If this is Our Last Dance") with Benny Andersson's orkester, "[[Gabriellas sång]]" (from film ''Så som i himmelen'' a.k.a. ''As It Is In Heaven''), "Jag vet vad han vill" (a.k.a. "I Know Him So Well") from musical ''Chess'', "Det är vi ändå" (with Tommy Körberg and Benny Anderssons Orkester), and "Du är min man" ("You Are My Man") with Benny Anderssons Orkester, among others.
