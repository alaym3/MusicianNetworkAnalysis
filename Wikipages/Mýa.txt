==Early life==
Mýa Harrison, a native of [[Washington, D.C.]], is one of three children. Her father Sherman, who is African-American,  is a musician and singer, and her mother Theresa, who is Italian-American, worked as an accountant. She grew up in suburban Washington D.C. with her two younger brothers Chaz and Nijel. As a child, she imitated [[Michael Jackson]] in her mother's high-heeled boots, using a spoon as a make-believe microphone.<ref name="The Washington Post">{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-58338007|title=For 18-year-old singer, it's all about a hit single.|access-date=October 15, 2012|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> Mýa took violin lessons throughout her childhood, but dance was her primary after-school activity. She started [[ballet]] lessons in 1982 when she was only two and [[Jazz dance|jazz]] and [[Tap dance|tap]] when she was four.<ref name="The Washington Post"/> Although she lost interest for several years, her interest waned at about age ten, but at age twelve, it was rekindled.<ref name="The Washington Post"/><ref name="New Straits Times">{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82548687.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610060521/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82548687.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014|title=Sheer Mya-gic in her voice|access-date=October 14, 2012|work=[[New Straits Times]]}}</ref> Her tap dancing skills afforded her an opportunity to study with one of the best known tap dancers in the country, [[Savion Glover]], when he came to Washington, D.C. for a workshop. Glover later chose Mýa for a solo spot in a dance performance at the [[Kennedy Center]].<ref name="The Washington Post"/><ref name="AMG Bio">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mya-p291307/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography|access-date=October 31, 2010|work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

During her childhood, Mýa sometimes had to endure insensitive comments about her ethnic background, but her accomplishments as a dancer helped her make the transition into adolescence and deal with its peer pressure. As a popular performer, Mýa would later draw from her experiences to speak to girls' groups as part of the Secret of Self-Esteem program for adolescents, addressing issues such as [[body image]], [[peer pressure]], and [[gender stereotypes]]. Learning steps from music videos landed her a stint from 1996 until 1998 as a hip-hop dancer for [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''[[Teen Summit]]''.<ref name="The Washington Post"/> She also began teaching a children's hip-hop and jazz dance class in Camp Springs.<ref name="The Washington Post"/> By age 15, Mýa's musical side took over and her professional-musician father helped her perfect her vocal abilities. When he realized that his daughter was serious about a career in music, Mýa's father began shopping around with her demo tape, eventually catching the interest of University Music president and CEO Haqq Islam.<ref name="New Straits Times"/> After graduating from [[Eleanor Roosevelt High School (Maryland)|Eleanor Roosevelt High School]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]], [[Maryland]] at 16, Mýa took a few classes at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], but the teenager's primary focus was on the recording studio.<ref name="ReedKenyatta2005">{{citation|author1=Stacy-Deanne|last2=Kenyatta|first2=Kelly|last3=Lowery|first3=Natasha|editor-first=Kywnn|editor-last=Sanders|title=Alicia Keys, Ashanti, Beyoncé, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez & Mya: Divas of the New Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZGMcUEvkyEC&pg=PA126|access-date=July 8, 2020|year=2005|publisher=Colossus Books|location=Phoenix, Arizona|isbn=978-0-9749779-6-6|page=126}}</ref>

===2000–2002: ''Fear of Flying'' and "Lady Marmalade"===
Additionally in late 1999, Mýa began production on an album that would eventually become ''[[Fear of Flying (album)|Fear of Flying]]'', which involved a variety of producers, including [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Swizz Beatz]], [[Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis]], and [[Wyclef Jean]]. The title was partially inspired by [[Erica Jong]]'s [[Fear of Flying (novel)|same-titled 1973 novel]], which shared a lot of similarities toward [[female sexuality]] and development of [[second-wave feminism]]. Mýa, who did some writing on her debut album, was heavily involved in the production of ''Fear of Flying'', from writing and [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] to producing, [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], and [[Audio mastering|mastering]].<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nA4EAAAAMBAJ&q=mya&pg=PA28|title=Mya Shares Her 'Fear Of Flying'|access-date=October 31, 2010|work=[[Google Books]]|date=March 18, 2000}}</ref> Released in April 2000 to mixed reviews, ''Fear of Flying'' debuted at number 15 on the ''Billboard'' 200 with first week sales of 72,000 copies.

|quote=I'm just happy to be here. I think being a young artist, just starting out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like [[Aretha Franklin]]. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely want to be able to sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.

Since the beginning of her career, Mýa has always been artistically involved in her career. Harrison writes the majority of her own material for her studio albums. In an interview, she explained she writes 99.9% of her albums, and when songs are submitted to her, if she feels the song is something that feels like something she can perform well and hits close to home, then she feels comfortable doing it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/community/chat/2002-02-20-mya.htm |title=The Grammys: Mya |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 21, 2005 |access-date=September 12, 2010}}</ref> Harrison is known for writing sexually-driven lyrics and female empowerment compositions with a bit of an edge to them through her love for free-spirited [[word play]] and incorporates a wide genre of music such as [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop music|pop]], [[dance music|dance]], [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[techno]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[reggae]], and [[quiet storm]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456990/20020812/mya.jhtml |title=Mya Plans 'Lady Marmalade' Reunions On Third Album – News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=[[MTV]]|date=August 13, 2002 |access-date=August 31, 2010}}</ref><ref name="teenmusic.com">{{cite web|last=Lamb |first=Christopher |url=http://www.teenmusic.com/d.asp?r=5587&c=1021 |title=Mya: Marmalade to Rock |publisher=Teen Music |date=August 21, 2001 |access-date=August 31, 2010}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', she revealed she draws her musical inspirations from humming a melody off the note of a whirring fan or tapping her foot to the rhythm of the bathtub dripping; commenting she can hear melodies from natural sounds like birds chirping or the taxis and construction in Manhattan. Occasionally, Harrison wishes she could stop the music. "In the middle of a conversation, I'll start humming or moving my feet, and my friends will say, 'You can't be serious,{{'"}} she notes.

===Alter ego===
Introduced to audiences through her song, "Worth It," Mýa credits notorious mob accountant [[Meyer Lansky]] for American Mafia, as inspiration for her new handle. The singer ties her low-key nature to his laid-back image and her independent artist status to his birthdate on the United States' Independence Day.<ref name="alterego"/>

For Lan$ky's blunt [[cadence]], Mýa cites conscious and classic hip-hop trailblazers such as [[Mos Def]], Common, [[Digable Planets]], [[Black Thought]], [[André 3000]], and [[Erykah Badu]].<ref name="alterego"/>

However, all influences aside, Lan$ky is an integral part of Mýa, relying on her specifically during hard times. "When I need a picker-upper, or somebody to be that mentor, someone to be that fighter, or somebody to be that person that will crack the whip and get me in shape, that's who Mýa Lan$ky is."<ref name="alterego"/>

While adding, "The one that doesn't let me slip up. The one that's hard on me when I'm too vulnerable or hearing those voices, those outside forces. I get her together."<ref name="alterego"/>
