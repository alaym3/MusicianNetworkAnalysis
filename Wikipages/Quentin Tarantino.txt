In January 1992, Tarantino's [[neo-noir]] crime thriller ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''—which he wrote, directed, and acted in as Mr. Brown—was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was an immediate hit, with the film receiving a positive response from critics. The dialogue-driven [[heist film]] set the tone for Tarantino's later films. Tarantino wrote the script for the film in a three-and-a-half week bender and forwarded it to director [[Monte Hellman]]. Hellman helped Tarantino to secure funding from [[Richard N. Gladstein]] at Live Entertainment (which later became Artisan, now known as [[Lionsgate]]). [[Harvey Keitel]] read the script and also contributed to the budget, taking a role as co-producer and also playing a major part in the picture.<ref>Keitel heard of the script through his wife, who had attended a class with Lawrence Bender (see ''Reservoir Dogs'' special edition DVD commentary).</ref>

Following the success of ''Reservoir Dogs'', Tarantino was approached by Hollywood and offered numerous projects, including ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' (1994) and ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' (1997), but he instead retreated to [[Amsterdam]] to work on his script for ''Pulp Fiction''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/men-black-movies-hidden-secrets-facts-trivia/5/?v=8 |title=Quentin Tarantino and John Landis Turned Down The Chance To Direct Men In Black |website=[[Screen Rant]] |first=Jeff |last=Rindskopf |date=February 21, 2018 |access-date=October 26, 2018}}</ref>

Tarantino wrote, directed, and acted in the black comedy crime film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' in 1994, maintaining the [[violence in art|aestheticization of violence]] for which he is known, as well as his [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear]] storylines. Tarantino received the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]], which he shared with Roger Avary, who contributed to the story. He also received a nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] category. The film received another five nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Tarantino also won the [[Palme d'Or]] for the film at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film grossed over $200 million<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pulpfiction.htm |title=Pulp Fiction (1994) |publisher= Box Office Mojo |access-date=March 12, 2019}}</ref> and earned positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pulp_fiction/ |title=Pulp Fiction (1994) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/pulp-fiction |title=Pulp Fiction Reviews |publisher=Metacritic.

In 1995, Tarantino participated in the anthology film ''[[Four Rooms]]'', a collaboration that also included directors Robert Rodriguez, [[Allison Anders]] and Alexandre Rockwell. Tarantino directed and acted in the fourth segment of "The Man from Hollywood", a tribute to the ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' episode "[[Man from the South]]".{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} He re-teamed with Rodriguez later in the year with a supporting role in ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'', while in 1996 ''From Dusk till Dawn'' was finally released with Rodriguez directing and Tarantino in a minor role alongside Keitel, [[George Clooney]], and [[Juliette Lewis]].{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

His third feature film was ''[[Jackie Brown]]'' (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel ''[[Rum Punch]]''. An homage to [[blaxploitation]] films, it starred [[Pam Grier]], who starred in many of the films of that genre in the 1970s.

=== 2000s: Subsequent success ===
Tarantino had planned to start work on ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', as it was provisionally titled, but postponed this to write and direct ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1|Kill Bill]]'', a highly stylized "revenge flick" in the cinematic traditions of ''[[Wuxia]]'' (Chinese martial arts), ''[[Jidaigeki]]'' (Japanese period cinema), [[Spaghetti Western]]s and [[poliziotteschi|Italian horror]].

=== As a producer ===
In recent years, Tarantino has used his Hollywood power to give smaller and foreign films more attention than they might have received otherwise. These films are often labeled "Presented by Quentin Tarantino" or "Quentin Tarantino Presents". The first of these productions was in 2001, with the Hong Kong martial arts film ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'', which made over $14 million in the United States, seven times its budget.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} In 2004, he brought the Chinese martial arts film ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' to U.S. shores. It ended up having a number-one opening at the box office and earning $53.5 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/VIEW-Worldwide-Asian-films-are-grossing-2733592.php |title=Worldwide, Asian films are grossing millions.

In 2008, he produced the [[Larry Bishop]]-helmed ''[[Hell Ride]]'', a revenge biker film.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

In addition, in 1995, Tarantino formed [[Rolling Thunder Pictures]] with Miramax to release or re-release several independent and foreign features. By 1997, Miramax had shut down the company due to poor sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://criterioncompletion.com/rolling-thunder/ |title=Rolling Thunder |date=May 13, 2016 |website=The Criterion Completion |access-date=March 12, 2019}}</ref> The following films were released by Rolling Thunder Pictures: ''[[Chungking Express]]'' (1994, dir.

=== Film critic ===
In June 2020 Tarantino became an officially recognized critic on the critique [[review aggregator]] website, [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. His reviews are part of the "Tomatometer" rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenewbev.com/quentin-news/tomatometer-approved/|title=Tomatometer Approved|work=newbev.com|date=June 24, 2020|access-date=July 27, 2021}}</ref> He is also currently writing a book of film critiques.<ref name="Book Deal"/>

Early on in his career, Tarantino considered filming comic book adaptations. In the early 1990s, while fresh from his critical success with ''Reservoir Dogs'', Tarantino came to Constantin Productions with a script for a [[Silver Surfer]] film, but was turned-away.<ref name="SilverSurfer">{{cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/saga-of-the-silver-surfer-film-making-of-the-silver-surfer/ |title=Saga of the Silver Surfer (Film): Making of "The Silver Surfer" |website=cbr |first=Beau |last=Yarbrough |date=May 15, 2000 |access-date=October 23, 2018}}</ref> Following the release of ''Reservoir Dogs'', Tarantino considered making a film adaptation of [[Luke Cage]], but chose to make ''Pulp Fiction'' instead.<ref name="LLukeCage">{{cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/quentin-tarantino-considered-making-a-luke-cage-movie-203240267.html |title=Quentin Tarantino Considered Making a Luke Cage Movie |date=September 29, 2016 |work=[[Yahoo!

Before ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', Tarantino had considered making ''The Vega Brothers''.{{anchor|The Vega Brothers}} The film would have starred Michael Madsen and [[John Travolta]] reprising their roles of Vic (Mr. Blonde) from ''Reservoir Dogs'' and Vincent from ''Pulp Fiction''. In 2007, because of the age of the actors and the onscreen deaths of both characters, he claimed that the film—which he intended to call ''Double V Vega''—is "kind of unlikely now".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/2007/04/07/quentin-tarantino-talks-vega-brothers-the-pulp-fiction-reservoir-dogs-sequelprequel/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723210818/http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/04/07/quentin-tarantino-talks-vega-brothers-the-pulp-fiction-reservoir-dogs-sequelprequel/|url-status=dead |archive-date=July 23, 2008 |title=Quentin Tarantino talks Vega Brothers, the Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs sequel/prequel |publisher=SlashFilm |first=Peter |last=Sciretta |date=April 7, 2007}}</ref>

In 2009, in an interview for Italian television, after being asked about the success of the two ''Kill Bill'' films, Tarantino said, "You haven't asked me about the third one", and implied that he would be making a third ''Kill Bill'' film with the words, "The Bride will fight again!"<ref>[http://www.badtaste.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9753&Itemid=29 Quentin Tarantino Talks Kill Bill 3: The Bride Will Fight Again!], BadTaste.it, October 1, 2009.

In a late 2012 interview with the online magazine ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]'', Tarantino clarified his remarks and described his next film as being the final entry in a "''Django-Inglourious Basterds''" trilogy called ''Killer Crow''. The film will depict a group of [[World War II]]-era black troops who have "been fucked over by the American military and kind of go apeshit. They basically – the way Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and the Basterds are having an 'Apache resistance' – [the] black troops go on an Apache warpath and kill a bunch of white soldiers and white officers on a military base and are just making a warpath to Switzerland."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theroot.com/views/tarantino-unchained-part-1-django-trilogy |title=Django Unchained Trilogy and More: Tarantino Talks to Gates |website=theroot.com |date=December 23, 2012 |access-date=December 31, 2012|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230233859/http://www.theroot.com/views/tarantino-unchained-part-1-django-trilogy |archive-date=December 30, 2012}}</ref>

A long-running rumor in the industry is that Tarantino is interested in filming a new version of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]'s 1985 novel ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]''. His friend [[Roger Avary]] adapted ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'', another novel by Ellis, to film in 2002, and since both he and Tarantino like the works by Ellis, Tarantino has been eyeing the possibility of adapting ''Less Than Zero''.

Tarantino has stated in many interviews that his writing process is like writing a novel before formatting it into a script, saying that this creates the blueprint of the film and makes the film feel like literature. About his writing process he told website The Talks, "[My] head is a sponge. I listen to what everyone says, I watch little idiosyncratic behavior, people tell me a joke and I remember it. People tell me an interesting story in their life and I remember it. ... when I go and write my new characters, my pen is like an antenna, it gets that information, and all of a sudden these characters come out more or less fully formed. I don't write their dialogue, I get them talking to each other."<ref name=":0" /> In 2013, a survey of seven academics was carried out to discover which filmmakers had been referenced the most in essays and dissertations on film that had been marked in the previous five years.

In a December 2009 interview with John Scott Lewinski of ''[[Digital Spy]],'' Tarantino said that he plans to retire from filmmaking when he is 60, in order to focus on writing novels and film literature. He is skeptical of the film industry going digital, saying, "If it actually gets to the place where you can't show [[35 mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] in theaters anymore and everything is digital projection, I won't even make it to 60."<ref>{{cite web |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a191697/tarantino-im-going-to-become-a-novelist.html |title=Tarantino: 'I'm going to become a novelist' |website=Digital Spy |date=December 16, 2009 |access-date=March 2, 2010}}</ref> He has also stated that he has a plan, although "not etched in stone", to retire after making his tenth movie: "If I get to the 10th, do a good job and don't screw it up, well that sounds like a good way to end the old career."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wow-dude.net/article/235/Quentin-Tarantino-Still-Wants-To-Retire-After-His-Tenth-Film.html |title=Quentin Tarantino still wants to retire after his tenth film |date=November 11, 2014 |access-date=November 11, 2014 |website=Wow Dude |publisher=Wow Dude|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111151219/http://www.wow-dude.net/article/235/Quentin-Tarantino-Still-Wants-To-Retire-After-His-Tenth-Film.html |archive-date=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

=== Faith ===
As a youth, Tarantino attended an [[Evangelical]] church, describing himself as "baptized, born again and everything inbetween." Tarantino said this was an act of rebellion against his [[Catholic]] mother as she had encouraged what might usually be considered more conventional forms of rebellion, such as his interests in [[comic books]] and [[horror films]]. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Tarantino was evasive about his religious beliefs despite making it clear that he believed in [[God]], whom he credited with giving him his writing ability.<ref name="HBOMaher2003">{{Cite episode

"I think I was born Catholic, but I was never practiced," said Tarantino. "As time has gone on, as I've become a man and made my way further as an adult, I'm not sure how much any of that I believe in.
