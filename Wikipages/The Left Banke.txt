==History==
===1965–69: early years and disbandment===
The Left Banke was formed in 1965 and consisted of [[keyboardist|keyboard player]]/[[songwriter]] [[Michael Brown (rock musician)|Michael Brown]], [[drummer]]/[[Singing|singer]] George Cameron, [[bass guitarist]]/[[Singing|singer]] [[Tom Finn (singer)|Tom Finn]], [[Singing|singer]] [[Steve Martin Caro|Steve Martin]] (who also used the name Steve Martin Caro), and [[drummer]] Warren David-Schierhorst. Brown's father, [[Harry Lookofsky]], a well-known [[Session musician|session]] [[violin]]ist, ran a studio in New York and took an interest in the band's music, acting as [[Record producer|producer]], [[Talent manager|manager]] and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publisher]].<ref name="stories">{{cite web|title=Stories Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5539|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2 February 2010}}</ref> After some initial [[Studio recording|recording sessions]], David-Schierhorst was ousted, with Cameron switching to drums and Jeff Winfield on guitar. Brown's song, "Walk Away Renee", was sold to [[Smash Records]], a subsidiary of [[Mercury Records]], and became a huge hit in late 1966. The band's second [[Single (music)|single]], "Pretty Ballerina", also written by Brown, charted in early 1967, and The Left Banke released an [[album]] entitled ''[[Walk Away Renee/Pretty Ballerina]]'', by which time Rick Brand had replaced Winfield on guitar.

Tension between Brown and the rest of the band soon began to surface. When "Walk Away Renee" belatedly became a hit, the original band had become inactive. Brown decided to capitalize on the single's success by assembling a new version of The Left Banke for touring purposes, with [[Bert Sommer]] on [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], original drummer Warren David, and (future member of [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]) [[Michael McKean]] on guitar. Brown also recorded a single, "Ivy, Ivy" [[A-side and B-side#B/W|b/w]] "And Suddenly" as The Left Banke, with Sommer and a group of [[session musicians]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael McKean sets the record straight on The Left Banke|publisher=Newsreviewsinterviews.com|url=http://newsreviewsinterviews.com/interviews/michael-mckean-sets-the-record-straight-on-the-left-banke/|access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A With Michael McKean of Spinal Tap, Appearing at the Fillmore Miami Beach on May 5!|newspaper=[[Miami New Times]]|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/qanda-with-michael-mckean-of-spinal-tap-appearing-at-the-fillmore-miami-beach-on-may-5-6446620|access-date=22 April 2017}}</ref> The remaining members of the band hired attorneys to issue a cease and desist order and urged their [[fan club]] to boycott the record,<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Finn Interview - Part 1|website=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA-r-VzxtD0|access-date=12 April 2010}}</ref> which led to confusion among radio stations over which "Left Banke" to support. Radio and [[Smash Records]] ultimately removed their support from the single, which subsequently failed to make the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The "New" Left Banke never performed live. "And Suddenly" was eventually recorded by a group called [[The Cherry People]] and became a minor hit.<ref>{{cite web|title=And Suddenly by the Cherry People review|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t4524894|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2 February 2010}}</ref> McKean would later find fame as an actor (''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', ''[[Better Call Saul]]'').

In late 1967, the original group reunited and recorded more material, including the single "Desiree." Brown left the group permanently shortly thereafter and was replaced for touring purposes by Emmett Lake. Cameron, Finn and Martin continued to record and tour, with Tom Feher replacing Lake on keyboards and writing half of the band's new material. The songs recorded by various incarnations of the group in 1967 and 1968 were assembled into a second [[LP album|LP]], ''[[The Left Banke Too]]'', which was released in November 1968. This album featured backing vocals by a young [[Steven Tyler]] (who later became the lead singer of [[Aerosmith]]) on "My Friend Today" and "Dark is the Bark".<ref>{{cite web |title=Left Banke Interview Part 2 |medium=video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3UlPzemL5c#t=114s |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=May 10, 2021}}</ref> The band continued playing live in 1969, without Martin, but soon disbanded due to lack of success and financial problems. Later that same year, Brown and Martin reunited in the studio to record another single as The Left Banke, "Myrah" b/w "Pedestal", which was their final single for Smash Records.

===1971–present: various reunions===
In 1971, Brown, Cameron, Finn and Martin reunited briefly to record two songs for the movie ''Hot Parts''. The songs, "Love Songs in the Night" and "Two by Two", were released as a Steve Martin solo single on [[Buddah Records]], despite featuring contributions from four founding members of The Left Banke. In 1972, producer [[Les Fradkin]] offered to produce the group for a project on [[Bell Records]]. Although these sessions were not released at the time, one of the songs, "I Could Make It Last Forever", composed by Fradkin and Diane Ellis, was released on Fradkin's ''Goin' Back'' solo [[Compact Disc|CD]] in 2006. It was a rare recording since it featured Caro, Finn, Cameron and Brown, along with Brown's father, violinist Harry Lookofsky. Fradkin sang and played [[12-string guitar]] on the sessions. In 1978, Martin, Cameron and Finn reunited as The Left Banke to record an album's worth of material which was not released at the time. However, a single from these 1978 sessions, "Queen of Paradise" (b/w "And One Day"), was released in late 1978 with modest success. The album was eventually issued by [[Relix|Relix Records]] in 1986 under the title ''[[Strangers on a Train (album)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (''Voices Calling'' in Europe). However, the album did little to restore the popularity of the group.

After leaving The Left Banke in 1967, Michael Brown helped form the band, [[Montage (band)|Montage]]. Although Brown was never an official member of Montage, his presence is unmistakable in its music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Montage Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p19403|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2 February 2010}}</ref> The band released one self-titled album in 1969, which included a re-recording of The Left Banke song "Desiree", before Brown left. Brown's next project was the band [[Stories (band)|Stories]], featuring singer [[Ian Lloyd (musician)|Ian Lloyd]]. The band had a hit in 1973 with "[[Brother Louie (Hot Chocolate song)|Brother Louie]]", which reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 charts.<ref name="stories"/> However, Brown had left the group after their 2nd album "About Us", but before the success of "Brother Louie". Brown's next project was with The Beckies, which released one group-titled album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Beckies/dp/B013PZTHBO|title=The Beckies|access-date=13 June 2021|website=Amazon.com}}</ref>

In 1992, [[Mercury Records]] released a Left Banke [[Compilation album|compilation]] titled ''[[There's Gonna Be a Storm: The Complete Recordings 1966–1969]]''. It was intended to bring together the band's entire recorded output from the years 1966 to 1969, although a 1969 [[outtake]] titled "Foggy Waterfall", which had previously appeared on two earlier compilations, was not included.

In 1994, Michael Brown and his wife Yvonne Vitale produced and released an album titled ''On This Moment''. Between 2001 and 2006, Brown hosted a series of recording sessions at his home studio with Ian Lloyd (vocals), Tom Finn (bass guitar/vocals), Jim McAllister (guitar), and Jon Ihle (drums).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Finn Interview - Part 2|website=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UORzzTCEn2o|access-date=12 April 2010}}</ref>

In 2006, ex-member of [[The Bangles]] [[Susanna Hoffs]] and [[Matthew Sweet]], as Sid 'n' Susie, covered "She May Call You Up Tonight" for their first album ''[[Under the Covers, Vol. 1]]''. In addition, [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]] of the band [[Belle and Sebastian]] has cited The Left Banke as one of the early influences on the sound of the band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stuart Murdoch Interview|publisher=[[Fresh Air]]|url=https://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&t=1&islist=false&id=5244680&m=5244687|access-date=27 March 2011}}</ref> 

Former guitarist Jeff Winfield died of complications from pneumonia on June 13, 2009, at age 60.<ref name="villager"/>

====2011–13====
The previous touring version of The Left Banke featured one original member, George Cameron. Initially, Tom Finn and George Cameron reformed The Left Banke in March 2011, tapping New York City's Mike Fornatale (already a veteran of numerous other 60s band reunions, including The Monks and Moby Grape) to sing lead vocals in Steve Martin Caro's stead. The reunited group also featured new players: Paul Alves (lead guitar, backing vocals), Charly Cazalet (bass), Mickey Finn (keyboards), Rick Reil (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and second keyboardist/synth player Joe McGinty (replaced by John Spurney in 2012). They appeared live at Joe's Pub in New York City on March 5, 2011, and March 6, 2011, to sold-out audiences. In April 2011, Tom Finn revealed in a Facebook posting that he had reformed the group,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/reparataandthedelrons |title=Reparata and the Delrons |publisher=Facebook |access-date=1 April 2012}}</ref> with two shows planned for July in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larryhovis.net/leftbanke/ |title=The Left Banke - LeftBanke.nu |publisher=Larryhovis.net |access-date=1 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/LeftBanke |title=The Official Left Banke Fan Page |publisher=Facebook |date=2012-02-29 |access-date=1 April 2012}}</ref>  Tom Finn performed with the re-formed group through 2013, after which he left due to disagreements with Cameron and due to back trouble.

In early 2011, [[Sundazed Records|Sundazed]] released reissues of the two Smash vinyl albums on CD and LP, utilizing the original running order and artwork.

In February 2012, Tom Finn notified the YouTube community that the Left Banke was in the process of creating a new record featuring contributions from co-founder Michael Brown.
[[File:The Left Banke playing in an 2012 reunion tour.jpg|thumb|George Cameron (3rd from left) and Tom Finn (Center, 4th from left) with band during their 2012 reunion tour.]]
On April 29, 2012, Brown joined the reunited Left Banke on stage at B.B. King's in New York City for a version of his "Pretty Ballerina." His performance was greeted with a standing ovation. Rick Brand, guitarist with the band in 1966-67 was also in attendance. Tom Finn sang a newly written song called "City Life" which showed a heavier rock version of the Left Banke with baroque string section intact. No new recordings begun in 2012 were ever released, and Brown died in 2015.

At the beginning of their reunion dates, the group was joined onstage by a two or three-piece string section and even a guest oboe player for one or two shows. Both Michael Brown and George Cameron were in touch with Steve Martin Caro, who wanted to rejoin the group, but was unable to tour in 2012 due to previous commitments.

On June 6, 2013, Brown joined the reunited Left Banke on stage at Joe's Pub in NYC for his last live performance of Walk Away Renee.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=The Left Banke "Walk Away Renee" NYC... 6/6/2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0DaiofY-lM|language=en|access-date=2021-04-05}}</ref>

===Unrealized reunions===
On March 18, 2015, the day before Mike Brown's death, it was announced that original vocalist Steve Martin Caro officially rejoined the current touring version of The Left Banke. Photos on The Left Banke official Facebook and Twitter pages displayed Steve signing a contract. Two 2015 shows featured co-headliner [[Ian Lloyd (musician)|Ian Lloyd]] of [[Stories (band)|Stories]] and Sam Kogon as vocalist.  The re-formed Cameron band played for the last time twice in 2015; once in Sellersville, PA and once in Natick, MA.  No shows under any Left Banke configuration have been performed since 2015, and by 2020 the major players of 1966 were all deceased.

In January, 2018, it was announced on the official Facebook page operated by Steve Martin Caro and George Cameron that they were planning a tour. Several photos of Steve Martin Caro rehearsing with George Cameron and guitarist Sam Kogon were posted with a message which stated "it was Steve's first time behind the microphone in over 15 years. We went through and workshopped much of the Left Banke catalog."  However, Cameron passed away five months later, before any performances could take place under this collaboration.

===Deaths===
Michael Brown died from heart disease on March 19, 2015, at age 65. Brown had been writing new material and planned to participate in the 2015 reunion of The Left Banke with Steve Martin Caro and George Cameron. Brown's funeral and memorial service was held on March 25, 2015 at Fort Lee Gospel Church in Fort Lee, New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-michael-brown-20150321-story.html|title=Michael Brown dies at 65; co-wrote pop classic 'Walk Away Renee'|first=Randy|last=Lewis|website=Latimes.com|access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref>
