'''Tony Cottrell''', better known as '''Hi-Tek''' (born May 5, 1976),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=April L. |title=Cover Story: Teknology Eternal |url=https://www.citybeat.com/home/article/13021227/cover-story-teknology-eternal |website=citybeat.com |publisher=City Beat |date=October 23, 2003|access-date=November 4, 2018}}</ref> is an [[United States|American]] [[Rapping|rapper]] and [[record producer]] from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. He is best known for his work with [[Talib Kweli]]. His father is singer Willie Cottrell of the Willie Cottrell Band, whom Hi-Tek featured on his second album, ''[[Hi-Teknology 2]]''.

==Career==

===1996-2000===
Hi-Tek started his career with hip hop group [[Mood (band)|Mood]] and had a regional hit with "Hustle on the Side". That song was made for Mood's album ''Doom'', which featured amongst others [[Brooklyn]] MC [[Talib Kweli]]. Hi-Tek went on to produce most of Talib Kweli and [[Mos Def]]'s ''[[Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star|Black Star]]'' (1998). In 2000, Tek and Kweli (under the name Reflection Eternal) released ''[[Train of Thought (Reflection Eternal album)|Train of Thought]]'' (2000) on [[Rawkus Records]], with raps by Kweli and beats by Hi-Tek. It enjoyed moderate crossover radio success with the singles "The Blast" and "Move Somethin'". Reflection Eternal released a follow-up album titled ''Revolutions Per Minute'' on May 18, 2010.

===2001-current===
After signing to Rawkus Records, Hi-Tek produced for a number of the labels projects, including the  popular ''[[Soundbombing]]'' series; a three-record compilation of mostly Rawkus-based artists. In 2001, he released his solo album ''[[Hi-Teknology]]'' on Rawkus. The album featured appearances by [[Mos Def]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Vinia Mojica]], [[Buckshot (rapper)|Buckshot]], and others, with all production handled by Hi-Tek. It received critical acclaim and spawned a minor hit, "Round and Round" with Cincinnati singer [[Jonell]].

Hi-Tek is a staff producer for [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and its affiliates, as well as past associates such as Kweli and Mos Def.  He has also recorded songs for [[Dion Jenkins]], an R&B singer signed to Aftermath. ''Hi-Teknology 2'' was released October 17, 2006 on [[Babygrande Records|Babygrande]], and distributed by [[Koch Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=hitek |title=Exclusive Hip Hop News, Audio, Lyrics, Videos, Honeys, Wear, Sneakers, Download Mixtapes |publisher=Hiphopgame.com |date=2006-07-19 |access-date=2012-03-30}}</ref> The producer released the third installment, ''[[Hi-Teknology 3: Underground]]'' on December 11, 2007.

In November 2015, producer 9th Wonder announced Hi-Tek as the newest member of The Soul Council - the production staff of his record label [[It's A Wonderful World Music Group]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Victoria|title=Hi-Tek Joins The Soul Council|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.36213/title.hi-tek-joins-the-soul-council|website=hiphopdx.com|date=10 November 2015|publisher=Cheri Media|access-date=2015-11-15}}</ref>
