'''Yes''' are <!-- not "is"; British English is used for this article. See WP:ENGVAR for more info. --> an English [[progressive rock]] band formed in London in 1968 by singer [[Jon Anderson]], bassist [[Chris Squire]], guitarist [[Peter Banks]], keyboardist [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]] and drummer [[Bill Bruford]]. The band has undergone [[List of Yes band members|numerous formations]] throughout its history; nineteen musicians have been full-time members. Since June 2015, it has consisted of guitarist [[Steve Howe]], drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]], keyboardist [[Geoff Downes]], singer [[Jon Davison]] and bassist [[Billy Sherwood]]. Yes have explored several musical styles over the years, and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers.

Yes began performing original songs and rearranged covers of rock, pop, blues and jazz songs, as evident on their first two albums. A change of direction in 1970 led to a series of successful progressive rock albums until their disbanding in 1981, their most successful being ''[[The Yes Album]]'' (1971), ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' (1971) and ''[[Close to the Edge]]'' (1972). Yes toured as a major rock act that earned the band a reputation for their elaborate stage sets, light displays, and album covers designed by [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]]. The success of "[[Roundabout (song)|Roundabout]]", the single from ''Fragile'', cemented their popularity across the decade and beyond.

In 1983 Yes reformed with a new line-up that included [[Trevor Rabin]] and a more commercial and pop-oriented musical direction. The result was ''[[90125]]'' (1983), their highest-selling album, which contained the U.S. number-one single "[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]". From 1991 to 1992, Yes were an eight-member formation after they merged with [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]] for ''[[Union (Yes album)|Union]]'' (1991) and its tour. Since 1994, Yes have released albums with varied levels of success and completed tours from 1994 to 2004. After a four-year hiatus, they resumed touring in 2008 and continue to release albums; their most recent is ''[[The Quest (Yes album)|The Quest]]'' (2021). From 2016 to 2018, a new group of former Yes members began touring and named themselves [[Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman]].<ref>http://www.museonmuse.jp/?p=10801</ref>

Yes are one of the most successful, influential, and longest-lasting progressive rock bands. They have sold 13.5 million [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified albums in the US,<ref name=riaatotal>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=top_tallies&ttt=TAA#search_section|title=Top Selling Artists|publisher=RIAA|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> as well as more than 30 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yesworld.com/discography/yes-the-studio-albums-1969-1987/|title=Yes the Studio Albums 1969-1987|publisher=yesworld|access-date=25 November 2021}}</ref> In 1985, they won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] with "[[Cinema (Yes song)|Cinema]]", and received five Grammy nominations between 1985 and 1992. They were ranked No. 94 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxm64mApR05CJVCePlmcUFluSZyiAvKZ8|title=VH1 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock|publisher=YouTube|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> Yes have headlined annual progressive rock-themed cruises since 2013 named Cruise to the Edge. Their [[Yes discography|discography]] spans 22 studio albums. In April 2017, Yes were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], which chose to induct current and former members Anderson, Squire, Bruford, Kaye, Howe, Wakeman, White and Rabin.

=== 1968–1971: Formation and breakthrough{{anchor|Mabel Greer's Toyshop}} ===
[[File:Yes logo.svg|thumb|left|upright|The band's logotype used since 1972 designed by artist Roger Dean]]

In 1967, bassist [[Chris Squire]] formed the rock band [[Mabel Greer's Toyshop]],<ref>"Yes: Perpetual Change" by David Watkinson, Plexus Publishing, 2001.</ref> with singer and guitarist Clive Bayley, drummer Bob Hagger, and guitarist [[Peter Banks]].<ref name="welch3334">Welch 2008, p. 33–34.</ref> They played at the [[Marquee Club]] in [[Soho]], London where Jack Barrie, owner of the nearby La Chasse club, saw them perform. "There was nothing outstanding about them", he recalled, "the musicianship was very good but it was obvious they weren't going anywhere".<ref>Welch 2008, p. 23.</ref> Barrie introduced Squire to singer [[Jon Anderson]], a worker at the bar in La Chasse, who found they shared interests in [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and harmony singing. That evening at Squire's house they wrote "Sweetness," which was included on the first Yes album.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 24.</ref> Meanwhile, Banks had left Mabel Greer's Toyshop to join Neat Change, but he was dismissed by this group on 7 April 1968.<ref name=welch3334/> In June 1968, Hagger was replaced in the nascent Yes by [[Bill Bruford]], who had placed an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'',<ref name="welch3334" /><ref>Welch 2008, p. 37.</ref> and Banks was recalled by Squire, replacing Bayley as guitarist.<ref name=welch3334/> Finally, the classically trained organist and pianist [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]], of Johnny Taylor's Star Combo and the Federals, became the keyboardist and the fifth member.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 38</ref> The newborn band rehearsed in the basement of The Lucky Horseshoe cafe on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] between 10 June and 9 July 1968.<ref>Bruford, p. 35</ref><ref>Welch 2008, p. 39</ref><ref>Welch 2008, p. 44</ref>

Anderson suggested that they call the new band Life. Squire suggested that it be called World.<ref>Yesspeak Live: The Director's Cut</ref> Banks responded, simply, "yes", and that was how the band were named.<ref name=welch3334/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4822acba-543b-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}</ref> The first gig under the new brand followed at a youth camp in [[East Mersea]], Essex on 4 August 1968. Early sets were formed of cover songs from artists such as [[the Beatles]], [[the 5th Dimension]] and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]].<ref>Welch 2008, p. 45.</ref> On 16 September, Yes performed at Blaise's club in London as a substitute for [[Sly and the Family Stone]], who failed to turn up. They were well received by the audience, including the host Roy Flynn, who became the band's manager that night.<ref>Welch 2008, pp. 50–51.</ref> That month, Bruford decided to quit performing to study at the [[University of Leeds]].<ref name="welch52-53">Welch 2008, pp. 52–53.</ref> His replacement, Tony O'Reilly of [[the Koobas]], struggled to perform with the rest of the group on stage and former Warriors and future [[King Crimson]] drummer Ian Wallace subbed for one gig on 5 November 1968.<ref name="welch52-53"/> After Bruford was refused a year's sabbatical leave from Leeds, Anderson and Squire convinced him to return for Yes' supporting slot for [[Cream (band)|Cream's]] farewell concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 26 November.<ref name="welch52-53"/>

[[File:Jon Anderson, 1973.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jon Anderson in 1974]]

After seeing an early [[King Crimson]] gig in 1969, Yes realised that there was suddenly stiff competition on the London gigging circuit, and they needed to be much more technically proficient, starting regular rehearsals.<ref name="banks">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sjxnnx-jqU|title=Interview with Peter Banks by Mark Powell|publisher=[[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red TV]]|access-date=21 September 2017}}</ref> They subsequently signed a deal with [[Atlantic Records]], and, that August, released their debut album ''[[Yes (Yes album)|Yes]]''.<ref name="welch315">Welch 2008, p. 315</ref> Compiled of mostly original material, the record includes renditions of "[[Every Little Thing (Beatles song)|Every Little Thing]]" by the Beatles and "I See You" by [[the Byrds]]. Although the album failed to break into the UK album charts, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic [[Lester Bangs]] complimented the album's "sense of style, taste, and subtlety".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/yes/albums/album/113178/review/6067812/yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603085300/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/yes/albums/album/113178/review/6067812/yes|archive-date=3 June 2008|title=Yes: Yes: Music Reviews: Rolling Stone|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=7 February 1970|access-date=14 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Melody Maker'' columnist Tony Wilson chose Yes and [[Led Zeppelin]] as the two bands "most likely to succeed".<ref>Liner notes on Yes (1969)</ref>

Following a tour of Scandinavia with [[the Faces]], Yes performed a solo concert at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] on 21 March 1970. The second half consisted of excerpts from their second album ''[[Time and a Word]]'', accompanied by a 20-piece youth orchestra.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 77.</ref> Banks left the group on 18 April 1970, just three months before the album's release. Having expressed dissatisfaction with the idea of recording with an orchestra as well as the sacking of Flynn earlier in the year,<ref name=welch315/><ref>Welch 2008, p. 80.</ref> Banks later indicated that he was fired by Anderson and Squire, and that Kaye and Bruford had no prior knowledge that it would be happening.<ref name=banks/> Similar to the first album, ''Time and a Word'' features original songs and two new covers–"Everydays" by [[Buffalo Springfield]] and "No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed" by [[Richie Havens]]. The album broke into the UK charts, peaking at number 45. Banks' replacement was [[Tomorrow (band)|Tomorrow]] guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]], who appears in the photograph of the group on the American issue despite not having played on it.<ref>Welch, 2008, p. 89</ref>

The band retreated to a rented farmhouse in [[Devon]] to write and rehearse new songs for their following album. Howe established himself as an integral part of the group's sound with his [[Gibson ES-175]] and variety of acoustic guitars. With producer and engineer [[Eddy Offord]], recording sessions lasted as long as 12 hours with each track being assembled from small sections at a time, which were pieced together to form a complete track. The band would then learn to play the song through after the final mix was complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nfte.org/interviews/EO234.html|title=Conversation with Eddy Offord|first=Tim|last=Morse|year=2000|publisher=Notes From the Edge (http://www.nfte.org)|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> Released in February 1971, ''[[The Yes Album]]'' peaked at number 4 in the UK and number 40 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts.

Yes embarked on a 28-day tour of Europe with [[Iron Butterfly]] in January 1971.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 102</ref> The band purchased Iron Butterfly's entire [[public address system]], which improved their on-stage performance and sound.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 104.</ref> Their first date in North America followed on 24 June in [[Edmonton]], Canada supporting [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].<ref>Bruford, p. 55</ref> Friction arose between Howe and Kaye on tour;<ref>Welch 2008, p. 109.</ref> this, along with Kaye's reported reluctance to play the [[Mellotron]] and the [[Minimoog]] synthesizer, preferring to stick exclusively to [[piano]] and [[Hammond organ]],<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book|first=John|last=Tobler|year=1992|title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|edition=1st|publisher=Reed International Books Ltd|location=London|page=229|id=CN 5585}}</ref> led to the keyboardist being fired from the band in the summer of 1971. Anderson recalled in a 2019 interview: "Steve and Chris came over and said, 'Look, Tony Kaye... great guy.' But, you know, we’d just seen [[Rick Wakeman]] about a month earlier. And I said, 'There’s that Rick Wakeman guy,' and we’ve got to get on with life and move on, you know, rather than keep going on, set in the same circle. And that’s what happens with a band."<ref name="BCBYesIndeed">{{cite web|url=https://bestclassicbands.com/jon-anderson-interview-3-26-19/ |title=Jon Anderson Interview?

=== 1971–1974: ''Fragile'', ''Close to the Edge'' and ''Tales from Topographic Oceans'' ===
At the time of Kaye's departure, Yes had already found their new keyboardist – [[Rick Wakeman]], a classically trained player who had left the folk rock group [[Strawbs]] earlier in the year. He was already a noted studio musician, with credits including [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], [[David Bowie]], [[Cat Stevens]] and [[Elton John]]. Squire commented that he could play "a grand piano for three bars, a Mellotron for two bars and a Moog for the next one absolutely spot on",<ref>{{cite video|people=Squire, Chris|title=BBC broadcast of Sounding Out: Yes on 10&nbsp;January&nbsp;1972}}</ref> which gave Yes the orchestral and choral textures that befitted their new material.

Released on 26 November 1971, the band's fourth album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' showcased their growing interest in the structures of classical music, with an excerpt of ''[[The Firebird]]'' by [[Igor Stravinsky]] being played at the start of their concerts since the album's [[Fragile Tour|1971–1972 tour]].<ref>''Yessongs'' track listing. Atlantic Records 1973.</ref> Each member performed a solo track on the album, and it marked the start of their long collaboration with artist [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]], who designed the group's logo, album art, and stage sets. ''Fragile'' peaked at number 7 in the UK and number 4 in the US<ref name="allmusicalbumchart">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yes-mn0000685647/awards|title=Yes Billboard Albums |website=Allmusic|access-date=21 September 2017}}</ref> after it was released there in January 1972, and was their first record to reach the top ten in North America. A shorter version of the opening track, "[[Roundabout (song)|Roundabout]]", was released as a single that peaked at number 13 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5891|pure_url=yes}}|title=Yes > Charts & Awards &gt; Billboard Singles|website=Allmusic|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref>

In February 1972 Yes recorded a cover version of "[[America (Simon & Garfunkel song)|America]]" by [[Paul Simon]]. The single reached number 46 on the US singles chart.<ref name=allmusicsinglechart>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yes-p5891/charts-awards/billboard-singles|title=Yes Billboard Singles|website=Allmusic|access-date=21 September 2017}}</ref> The track subsequently appeared on ''[[The New Age of Atlantic]]'', a 1972 compilation album of several bands signed to Atlantic Records, and again in the 1975 compilation ''[[Yesterdays (Yes album)|Yesterdays]]''.

Released in September 1972, ''[[Close to the Edge]]'', the band's fifth album, was their most ambitious work so far. At 19 minutes, the [[Close to the Edge (song)|title track]] took up an entire side on the vinyl record and combined elements of classical music, psychedelic rock, pop, and jazz. The album reached number 3 in the US<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> and number 4 on the UK charts.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 129.</ref> "[[And You and I]]" was released as a single that peaked at number 42 in the US.<ref name=allmusicsinglechart/> The growing critical and commercial success of the band was not enough to retain Bruford, who left Yes in the summer of 1972, before the album's release, to join [[King Crimson]]. The band considered several possible replacements, including [[Aynsley Dunbar]] (who was playing with Frank Zappa at the time),<ref>{{cite web|title=Chris Squire Takes A Straight And Stronger Course|url=http://bassmusicianmagazine.com/2013/03/chris-squire-takes-a-straight-and-stronger-course-by-rick-suchow-bass-musician-magazine-march-2013/|website=Bass Musician Magazine|author=Rick Suchow|date=March 2013|publisher=V.I.E., LLC|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> and decided on former [[Plastic Ono Band]] drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]], a friend of Anderson and Offord who had once sat in with the band weeks before Bruford's departure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2005/05/alan-white-3/|title=Yes' Alan White Exclusive Interview: Modern Drummer Magazine|date=18 May 2005|publisher=Moderndrummer.com|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> White learned the band's repertoire in three days before embarking on their [[Close to the Edge Tour|1972–1973 tour]]. By this point, Yes were beginning to enjoy worldwide commercial and critical success. Their early touring with White was featured on ''[[Yessongs]]'', a triple live album released in May 1973 that documented shows from 1972. The album reached number 7 in the UK and number 12 in the US.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/><ref>Welch 2008, p. 136.</ref> A [[Yessongs (film)|concert film]] of the same name premiered in 1975<ref>Welch 2008, p. 146.</ref> that documented their shows at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]] in December 1972, with added psychedelic visual images and effects.

''[[Tales from Topographic Oceans]]'' was the band's sixth studio album, released on 14 December 1973.  It marked a change in their fortunes and polarised fans and critics alike. The double vinyl set was based on Anderson's interpretation of the [[Shastra|Shastric]] scriptures from a footnote within [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s book ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''. The album became the first LP in the UK to ship gold before the record arrived at retailers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQkEAAAAMBAJ|title=Yes LP Breaks Ground in U.K.|date=15 December 1973|magazine=Billboard|page=42|access-date=11 February 2012}}</ref> It went on to [[List of UK Albums Chart number ones of the 1970s#1974|top the UK charts]] for two weeks while reaching number 6 in the US,<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> and became the band's fourth consecutive gold album.

=== 1974–1980: ''Relayer'', ''Going for the One'', ''Tormato'' and the Paris sessions ===
Several musicians were approached to replace Wakeman, including [[Vangelis Papathanassiou]], [[Eddie Jobson]] of [[Roxy Music]] and former Atlantis/Cat Stevens keyboardist [[Jean Roussel]]. Yes ultimately chose Swiss keyboardist [[Patrick Moraz]] of [[Refugee (band)|Refugee]], who arrived in August 1974<ref>{{cite news |title= News Briefs |magazine=Billboard |date=31 August 1974}}</ref> during the recording sessions for ''[[Relayer]]'', which took place at Squire's home in [[Virginia Water]], Surrey. Released in November that year, ''Relayer'' showcased a [[jazz fusion]]-influenced direction the band were pursuing. The album features the 22-minute track titled "[[The Gates of Delirium]]", which highlights a battle initially inspired by ''[[War and Peace]]'' by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Its closing section, "Soon", was subsequently released as a single. The album reached number 4 in the UK and number 5 in the US.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/><ref>Welch 2008, p. 154.</ref> Yes embarked on their [[List of Yes concert tours (1960s–70s)#Relayer Tour|1974–1975 tour]] to support ''Relayer''. The compilation album ''[[Yesterdays (Yes album)|Yesterdays]]'', released in 1975, contained tracks from Yes' first two albums, the B-side track from their "Sweet Dreams" single from 1970 titled "Dear Father", and the original ten-minute version of their cover of "America".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Relayer & Yesterdays|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=Ken|last=Barnes|date=19 June 1975}}</ref>

Between 1975 and 1976, each member of the band released a solo album. Their subsequent [[List of Yes concert tours (1960s–70s)#1976 Solo Albums Tour|1976 tour]] of North America with [[Peter Frampton]] featured some of the band's most-attended shows. The show of 12 June, also supported by [[Gary Wright]] and [[Pousette-Dart Band]] at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in Philadelphia, attracted over 100,000 people.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yestour '76 – Laser Show Intrigues Audiences|work=Circus Magazine|date=13 September 1976|author=Peter Crescenti}}</ref> Roger Dean's brother Martyn was the main designer behind the tour's "Crab Nebula" stage set, while Roger and fabric designer Felicity Youette provided the backgrounds.

In late 1976, the band traveled to Switzerland and started recording for their album ''[[Going for the One]]'' at [[Mountain Studios]], [[Montreux]]. It was then that Anderson sent early versions of "Going for the One" and "[[Wonderous Stories]]" to Wakeman, who felt he could contribute to such material better than the band's past releases. Moraz was let go, after Wakeman was booked on a session musician basis. Upon its release in July 1977, ''Going for the One'' [[List of number-one albums from the 1970s (UK)#1977|topped]] the UK album charts for two weeks and reached number 8 in the US.<ref name="allmusicalbumchart" /><ref name="wel166" /> "[[Wonderous Stories]]" and "Going for the One" were released as singles in the UK and reached numbers 7 and 25, respectively.<ref name="wel166">Welch 2008, p. 166</ref> Although the album's cover was designed by [[Hipgnosis]], it still features their Roger Dean "bubble" logotype. The band's [[List of Yes concert tours (1960s–70s)#Going for the One Tour|1977 tour]] spanned across six months.

''[[Tormato]]'' was released in September 1978 at the height of [[punk rock]] in England, during which the music press criticised Yes as representing the bloated excesses of early-1970s progressive rock. The album saw the band continuing their movement towards shorter songs; no track runs longer than eight minutes.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Yes Decade|date=17 October 1978|website=Circus Magazine|first=Kurt|last=Loder}}</ref> Wakeman replaced his Mellotrons with the [[Birotron]], a [[sampler (musical instrument)|tape replay keyboard]], and Squire experimented with harmonisers and Mu-tron pedals with his bass. Production was handled collectively by the band and saw disagreements at the mixing stage among the members. With heavy commercial rock-radio airplay, the album reached number 8 in the UK and number 10 in the US charts, and was also certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="allmusicalbumchart" /> Despite internal and external criticisms of the album, the band's [[List of Yes concert tours (1960s–70s)#Tormato Tour|1978–1979 tour]] was a commercial success. Concerts were performed [[Theatre in the round|in the round]] with a £50,000-central revolving stage and a 360-degree sound system fitted above it. Their dates at Madison Square Gardens earned Yes a [[Madison Square Garden Gold Ticket Award|Golden Ticket Award]] for grossing over $1 million in box office receipts.<ref>Wooding, p. 197</ref>

In October 1979 the band convened in Paris with producer [[Roy Thomas Baker]]. Their diverse approach was now succumbing to division, as Anderson and Wakeman favoured the more fantastical and delicate approach while the rest preferred a heavier rock sound. Howe, Squire and White liked none of the music Anderson was offering at the time as it was too lightweight and lacking in the heaviness that they were generating in their own writing sessions. The Paris sessions abruptly ended in December after White broke his foot while rollerskating in a roller disco.<ref name="lithiummagazine.com 21 March 2014">{{cite web|url=http://lithiummagazine.com/interview-chris-squire-yes-march-19-2014|title=An Interview with Chris Squire of YES – March 19, 2014|work=Lithium Magazine|date=21 March 2014|access-date=22 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030334/http://lithiummagazine.com/interview-chris-squire-yes-march-19-2014|archive-date=22 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

When the band, minus Wakeman (who had only committed to recording keyboard overdubs once new material would be ready to record), reconvened in February to resume work on the project, their growing musical differences, combined with internal dissension, obstructed progress. Journalist Chris Welch, after attending a rehearsal, noted that Anderson "was singing without his usual conviction and seemed disinclined to talk".<ref>Welch, Musicians Only, 14 June 1980, p. 5.</ref> By late March, Howe, Squire and White had begun demoing material as an instrumental trio, increasingly uncertain about Anderson's future involvement. Eventually, a serious band dispute over finance saw Anderson leave Yes, with a dispirited Wakeman departing at around the same time.

=== 1980–1981: ''Drama'' and split ===
In 1980 pop duo [[the Buggles]] (keyboardist [[Geoff Downes]] and singer [[Trevor Horn]]) acquired [[Brian Lane (manager)|Brian Lane]] as a manager. At this point, the departure of Anderson and Wakeman had been kept secret from everyone outside the Yes inner circle. Seeing an option of continuing the band with new creative input and expertise, Squire revealed the situation to Horn and Downes and suggested that they join Yes as full-time members. Horn and Downes accepted the invitation and the reconfigured band recorded the ''[[Drama (Yes album)|Drama]]'' album, which was released in August 1980. The record displayed a heavier, harder sound than the material Yes recorded with Anderson in 1979, opening with the lengthy hard rocker "[[Machine Messiah]]". The album received substantial radio airplay in the late summer-fall of 1980, and peaked at number 2 in the UK and number 18 in the US, though it was the first Yes album to not be certified Gold by the RIAA since 1971.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> Their [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Drama Tour|1980 tour]] of North America and the UK received a mixed reaction from audiences. They were well received in the United States, and were awarded with a commemorative certificate after they performed a record 16 consecutive sold-out concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]] since 1974.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 197.</ref>

After the ''Drama'' tour, Yes reconvened in England to decide the band's next step, beginning by dismissing Lane as their manager. Horn chose to leave Yes to pursue a career in music production, with White and Squire next to depart. Left as the sole remaining members, Downes and Howe opted not to continue with the group and went their own separate ways in December 1980.

A live compilation album of Yes performances from 1976 to 1978, mixed in mid-1979 and originally intended for release in late 1979, was released as ''[[Yesshows]]'' in November 1980, peaking at number 22 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/>

An announcement came from the group's management in March 1981 confirming that Yes no longer existed.

Downes and Howe soon reunited to form [[Asia (band)|Asia]] with former [[King Crimson]] bassist and vocalist [[John Wetton]], and drummer [[Carl Palmer]] from [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]]. Squire and White continued to work together, initially recording sessions with [[Jimmy Page]] for a proposed band called [[XYZ (UK band)|XYZ]] (short for "ex-Yes-and-Zeppelin") in the spring of 1981. Page's former bandmate [[Robert Plant]] was also to be involved as the vocalist but he lost enthusiasm, citing his ongoing grieving for recently deceased Led Zeppelin drummer [[John Bonham]]. The short-lived group produced a few demo tracks, elements of which would appear in Page's band the Firm and on future Yes tracks "Mind Drive" and "Can You Imagine?". In late 1981, Squire and White released "[[Run with the Fox]]", a Christmas single with Squire on vocals which received radio airplay through the 1980s and early 1990s during the Christmas periods. A second Yes compilation album, ''[[Classic Yes]],'' was released in November 1981.

=== 1982–1988: Reformation, ''90125'' and ''Big Generator'' ===
[[File:Trevor Rabin July 2017.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Trevor Rabin joined the band when it reformed in 1983 and stayed until 1994 when he decided to become a film composer. He would later be a member of Yes Featuring Anderson Rabin Wakeman.]]
In 1982 [[Phil Carson]] of Atlantic Records introduced Squire and White to guitarist and singer [[Trevor Rabin]], who had initially made his name with the South African supergroup [[Rabbitt]], subsequently releasing three solo albums, working as a record producer and even briefly considered being a member of [[Asia (band)|Asia]]. The three teamed up in a new band called [[Cinema (band)|Cinema]], for which Squire also recruited the original Yes keyboard player Tony Kaye. Despite the presence of three Yes musicians, Cinema was not originally intended to be a continuation of Yes, and entered the studio to record a debut album as a brand new group. Although Rabin and Squire initially shared lead vocals for the project, Trevor Horn was briefly brought into Cinema as a potential singer,<ref name="innerviewsrabin2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.innerviews.org/inner/rabin.html|title=Trevor Rabin – Capturing adrenaline |publisher=Innerviews.org|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> but soon opted to become the band's producer instead.

Horn worked well with the band. However, his clashes with Tony Kaye (complicated by the fact that Rabin was playing most of the keyboards during the recording sessions) led to Kaye's departure after around six months of rehearsing.<ref name=innerviewsrabin2004/> Meanwhile, Squire encountered Jon Anderson (who, since leaving Yes, had released two solo albums and had success with the [[Jon and Vangelis]] project) at a Los Angeles party and played him the Cinema demo tracks. Anderson was invited into the project as lead singer and joined in April 1983 during the last few weeks of the sessions, having comparatively little creative input beyond adding his lead vocals and re-writing some lyrics.

At the suggestion of record company executives, Cinema then changed their name to Yes in June 1983. Rabin initially objected to this, as he now found that he had inadvertently joined a reunited band with a history and expectations, rather than help launch a new group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoremagacine.com/Entrevistas_eng_det.php?Codigo=19|title=Web dedicada a la Música de Cine y Bandas Sonoras |publisher=ScoreMagacine.com|date=22 September 2005|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> However, the presence of four former Yes members in the band (three of whom were founding members, including the distinctive lead singer) suggested that the name change was sound commercial strategy. The new album marked a radical change in style as the revived Yes had adopted a [[pop rock]] sound that showed little of their progressive roots. This incarnation of the band has sometimes been informally referred to as "Yes-West", reflecting the band's new base in Los Angeles rather than London.

Yes released their comeback album ''[[90125]]'' (named after its catalogue serial number on [[Atco Records]]) in November 1983. It became their biggest-selling album, certified by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] at triple-platinum (3 million copies) in sales in the US, and introduced the band to younger fans. "Owner of a Lonely Heart" [[List of number-one mainstream rock hits (United States)|topped]] the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart for four weeks, and went on to reach the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1984|number one spot]] on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart, the only single from Yes to do so,<ref name=allmusicsinglechart/> for two weeks in January 1984. Kaye's short-term replacement on keyboards, [[Eddie Jobson]], appeared briefly in the original video but was edited out as much as possible once Kaye had been persuaded to return to the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yesfans.com/archive/index.php/t-36085.html|title=Why I did not join Yes – by Eddie Jobson [Archive&#93; – Yesfans.com: The place for YES fans since 2001|publisher=Yesfans.com|date=20 February 2004|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref>

In 1984 the singles "Leave It" and "[[It Can Happen (Yes song)|It Can Happen]]" reached number 24 and 57 respectively.<ref name=allmusicsinglechart/> Yes also earned their only [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] in 1985 for the two-minute track "[[Cinema (Yes song)|Cinema]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT151|title=27th Annual Grammy Awards Final Nominations|date=26 January 1985|access-date=12 February 2011|volume=97|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=78|magazine=Billboard|issn=0006-2510|issue=4}}</ref> They were also nominated for an award for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals]] with "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] award with ''90125''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-22/entertainment/8501100896_1_terry-britten-vocal-purple-rain|title=And What's Your Line on the Winners?|date=22 February 1985|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> The band's [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#9012Live Tour|1984–1985 tour]] was the most lucrative in their history and spawned ''[[9012Live (video)|9012Live]]'', a concert film directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]] with added special effects from [[Charlex]] that cost $1 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/660003811.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+28%2C+1986&author=Steve+Morse%2C+Globe+Staff&pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=GENESIS%3A+PART-TIME+SOLOISTS%2C+PART-TIME+BAND&pqatl=google|title=Genesis: Part-Time Soloists, Part-Time Band |date=28 February 1986|first=Steve|last=Morse|access-date=22 September 2017|newspaper=Boston Globe}}</ref> Yes' mini-LP released in 1985, ''[[9012Live: The Solos]]'', earned Yes a nomination for a second Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for Squire's solo track, a rendition of "[[Amazing Grace]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1987/grammys.htm|title=29th Grammy Awards – 1987|publisher=Rock on the Net|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref>

Yes began recording for their twelfth album, ''[[Big Generator]]'', in 1986. The sessions underwent many starts and stops due to the use of multiple recording locations in Italy, London, and Los Angeles as well as interpersonal problems between Rabin and Horn, which kept the album from timely completion. Eventually Rabin took over final production, the album was released in September 1987, and immediately began receiving heavy radio airplay, with sales reaching number 17 in the UK and number 15 in the US.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> ''Big Generator'' earned Yes a nomination for a second Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1988, and was also certified platinum (with 1 million plus in sales) by the RIAA.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CeslAAAAIBAJ&pg=6885,4044707&dq|title=Irish rockers among Grammy nominees|date=15 January 1988|author=Larry McShane|website=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Publishing Company|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> The single "[[Love Will Find a Way (Yes song)|Love Will Find a Way]]" topped the Mainstream Rock chart, while "[[Rhythm of Love (Yes song)|Rhythm of Love]]" reached number 2 and "[[Shoot High Aim Low]]" number 11.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> The [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Big Generator Tour|1987–1988 tour]] ended with an appearance at Madison Square Garden on 14 May 1988 as part of Atlantic Records' 40th anniversary.

=== 1988–1995: ABWH, ''Union'', and ''Talk'' ===
By the end of 1988, Anderson felt creatively sidelined by Rabin and Squire and had grown tired of the musical direction of the "Yes-West" line-up. He took leave of the band, asserting that he would never stay in Yes purely for the money, and started work in [[Montserrat]] on a solo project that eventually involved Wakeman, Howe and Bruford. This collaboration led to suggestions that there would be some kind of reformation of the "classic" Yes, although from the start the project had included bass player [[Tony Levin]], whom Bruford had worked with in King Crimson. The project, rather than taking over or otherwise using the Yes name, was called [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]] (ABWH).

Their [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (album)|eponymous album]] released in June 1989 featured "Brother of Mine", which became an MTV hit and went gold in the United States. It later emerged that the four band members had not all recorded together; Anderson and producer [[Chris Kimsey]] slotted their parts into place. Howe has stated publicly<ref name="Innerviews">{{cite web|url=http://www.innerviews.org/inner/howe2.html|title=Steve Howe – Into the storm|publisher=Innerviews|year=2012|access-date=22 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723040600/http://www.innerviews.org/inner/howe2.html|archive-date=23 July 2015}}</ref> that he was unhappy with the mix of his guitars on the album, though a version of "Fist of Fire" with more of Howe's guitars left intact appeared on the ''[[In a Word: Yes (1969-)|In a Word]]'' box set in 2002. ABWH toured in [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe Tour|1989 and 1990]] as "An Evening of Yes Music" which featured Levin, keyboardist [[Julian Colbeck]], and guitarist [[Milton McDonald]] as support musicians. A live album was recorded and released in 1993 titled ''[[An Evening of Yes Music Plus]]'' that featured [[Jeff Berlin]] on bass due to Levin suffering from illness. The tour was also dogged by legal battles sparked by Atlantic Records due to the band's references to Yes in promotional materials and the tour title.

Following the tour the group returned to the recording studio to produce their second album, tentatively called ''Dialogue''. After hearing the tracks, [[Arista Records]] refused to release the album as they felt the initial mixes were weak. They encouraged the group to seek outside songwriters, preferably ones who could help them deliver hit singles. Anderson approached Rabin about the situation, and Rabin sent Anderson a demo tape with four songs, indicating that ABWH could have one but had to send the others back. Arista listened to all four and wanted all of them, but Rabin would not agree to the request.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The "Yes-West" group were working on a follow-up to ''Big Generator'' and had been shopping around for a new singer, auditioning [[Roger Hodgson]] of [[Supertramp]], [[Steve Walsh (musician)|Steve Walsh]] of [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[Robbie Nevil]] of "[[C'est la Vie (Robbie Nevil song)|C'est la Vie]]" fame,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/30492578/|title=Yes: a weird return of '70s once-weres and '80s wanna-bes|first=Roger|last=Catlin|page=4|date=18 April 1991|newspaper=Hartford Courant|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-access=subscription|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> and [[Billy Sherwood]] of [[World Trade (band)|World Trade]]. Walsh only spent one day with them, but Sherwood and the band worked well enough together and continued with writing sessions. Arista suggested that the "Yes-West" group, with Anderson on vocals, record the four songs to add to the new album which would then be released under the Yes name.

''[[Union (Yes album)|Union]]'' was released in April 1991 and is the thirteenth studio album from Yes. Each group played their own songs, with Anderson singing on all tracks. Squire sang background vocals on a few of the ABWH tracks, with Tony Levin playing all the bass on those songs. The album does not feature all eight members playing at once. The track "Masquerade" earned Yes a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920108&slug=1469119|title=Grammy Nominations Span Streisand, Seal, Seattle Symphony|date=8 January 1992|access-date=12 February 2011|website=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]}}</ref> ''Union'' sold approximately 1.5&nbsp;million copies worldwide, and peaked at number 7 in the UK and number 15 in the US charts.<ref name="allmusicalbumchart" /> Two singles from the album were released. "[[Lift Me Up (Yes song)|Lift Me Up]]" topped the Mainstream Rock charts in May 1991 for six weeks, while "[[Saving My Heart]]" peaked at number 9.<ref name=allmusicsinglechart/>

Almost the entire band have openly stated their dislike of ''Union''. Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was reportedly unable to recognise any of his keyboard work in the final edit and threw his copy of the album out of his limousine. He has since referred to the album as "Onion" because it makes him cry when he thinks about it. ''Union'' Co-producer [[Jonathan Elias]] later stated publicly in an interview that Anderson, as the associate producer, knew of the session musicians' involvement. He added that he and Anderson had even initiated their contributions, because hostility between some of the band members at the time was preventing work from being accomplished.<ref>{{cite web|author=Henry Potts|url=http://www.bondegezou.co.uk/iv/jeinterview.htm|title=Bondegezou.co.uk|publisher=Bondegezou.co.uk|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> The [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Union Tour|1991–1992 Union tour]] united all eight members on a revolving circular stage.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Sutcliffe|first=Phil|date=5 March 1991|title=Stories|journal=Q Magazine|volume=55|pages=12-13}}</ref> Following its conclusion, Bruford chose not to remain involved with Yes and returned to his jazz project ''[[Earthworks (album)|Earthworks]]''. Howe also ceased his involvement with the band at this time.

In 1993 the album ''[[Symphonic Music of Yes]]'' was released and features orchestrated Yes tracks arranged by [[Dee Palmer]]. Howe, Bruford and Anderson perform on the record, joined by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[English Chamber Orchestra]] and the [[London Community Gospel Choir]].

The following Yes studio album, as with ''Union'', was masterminded by a record company, rather than by the band itself. Victory Music approached Rabin with a proposal to produce an album solely with the ''90125'' line-up. Rabin initially countered by requesting that Wakeman also be included. Rabin began assembling the album at his home, using the then-pioneering concept of a digital home studio, and used material written by himself and Anderson. The new album was well into production in 1993, but Wakeman's involvement had finally been cancelled, as his refusal to leave his long-serving management created insuperable legal problems.

''[[Talk (Yes album)|Talk]]'' was released in March 1994 and is the band's fourteenth studio release. Its cover was designed by [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Max]]. The record was largely composed and performed by Rabin, with the other band members following Rabin's tracks for their respective instrumentation.<ref name=ultimateclassicrock>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/yes-talk/|author=Jeff Giles|title=Revisiting Yes' Confused 1994 Album, 'Talk'|date=21 March 2014|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> It was digitally recorded and produced by Rabin with engineer Michael Jay, using 3.4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of hard disk storage split among four networked [[Apple Macintosh]] computers running [[Digital Performer]], the first album ever recorded with such software.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a significant claim|date=May 2017}} The album blended elements of radio-friendly rock with a more structurally ambitious approach taken from the band's progressive blueprint, with the fifteen-minute track "[[Endless Dream (Yes song)|Endless Dream]]".

The [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Talk Tour|1994 tour]] (for which the band included side man [[Billy Sherwood]] on additional guitar and keyboards) used a sound system developed by Rabin named Concertsonics which allowed the audience located in certain seating areas to tune portable FM radios to a specific frequency, so they could hear the concert with headphones.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-08-05/entertainment/9408030535_1_rabin-headphones-band|date=5 August 1994|author=Parry Gettelman|work=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=22 September 2017|title=Yes Mines Cutting Edge Of Sound}}</ref>

In early 1995, following the tour, Rabin, feeling that he had achieved his highest ambitions with ''Talk'', lamented its disappointing reception as being "just wasn't what people wanted to hear at the time" and noted at the conclusion of the tour that "I think I'm done" and returned to LA where he shifted his focus to composing for films.<ref name=ultimateclassicrock/> Kaye also left Yes to pursue other projects.

=== 1995–2000: ''Keys to Ascension'', ''Open Your Eyes'' and ''The Ladder'' ===
In November 1995 Anderson, Squire, and White resurrected the "classic" 1970s line-up of Yes by inviting Wakeman and Howe back to the band, recording two new lengthy tracks called "Be the One" and "That, That Is". In March 1996 Yes performed three live shows at the [[Fremont Theater]] in [[San Luis Obispo]], California which were recorded and released, along with the new studio tracks, that October on [[CMC International]] Records as the  ''[[Keys to Ascension]]''  album, which peaked at number 48 in the UK and number 99 in the US.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> A same-titled [[Keys to Ascension (video)|live video]] of the shows was also released that year.

Yes continued to record new tracks in the studio, drawing some material written around the time of the XYZ project. At one point the new songs were to be released as a studio album, but commercial considerations meant that the new tracks were eventually packaged with the remainder of the 1996 San Luis Obispo shows in November 1997 on ''[[Keys to Ascension 2]]''. The record managed to reach number 62 in the UK, but failed to chart in the US.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> Disgruntled at the way a potential studio album had been sacrificed in favour of the ''Keys to Ascension'' releases (as well as the way in which a Yes tour was being arranged without his input or agreement), Wakeman left the group again. (The studio material from both albums would eventually be compiled and re-released without the live tracks onto a single CD, 2001's ''[[Keystudio]]''.)

[[File:Yes 19980619.jpg|thumb|left|Yes live performance June 1998]]
With Yes in disarray again, Squire turned to Billy Sherwood (by now the band's engineer) for help.<ref name=se-sherwood102013>{{cite news|url=http://news.allaboutjazz.com/something-else-interview-billy-sherwood-formerly-of-yes.php#.VHNWNrFFDVU|title=Something Else! Interview: Billy Sherwood, Formerly of Yes|publisher=News.allaboutjazz.com|date=13 October 2011|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> Both men had been working on a side project called [[Conspiracy (band)|Conspiracy]] and reworked existing demos and recordings from there to turn them into Yes songs, and also worked on new material with Anderson and White. (Howe's involvement at this stage was minimal, mainly taking place towards the end of the sessions.) Sherwood's integral involvement with the writing, production, and performance of the music led to his finally joining Yes as a full member (taking on the role of harmony singer, keyboardist and second guitarist).

The results of the sessions were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, ''[[Open Your Eyes (Yes album)|Open Your Eyes]]'' (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="se-sherwood102013" /> (Sherwood: "My goal was to try to break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. I love all music. That was the one thing I tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with Yes, you heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud — to have aligned planets for a moment in time."<ref name="se-sherwood102013"/>) However, ''Open Your Eyes''  was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the ''Billboard'' 200<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The [[Open Your Eyes (Yes song)|title single]]  managed to reach number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart.<ref name=allmusicsinglechart/>

For the [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Open Your Eyes and Thirtieth Anniversary Tour|1997/1998 ''Open Your Eyes'' tour]], Yes hired Russian keyboard player [[Igor Khoroshev]], who had played on some of the album tracks. Significantly, the tour setlist featured only a few pieces from the new album, and mostly concentrated on earlier material. Anderson and Howe, who had been less involved with the writing and production on ''Open Your Eyes'' than they'd wished, would express dissatisfaction about the album later.

By the time the band came to record their eighteenth studio album ''[[The Ladder (Yes album)|The Ladder]]'' with producer [[Bruce Fairbairn]], Khoroshev had become a full-time member (with Sherwood now concentrating on songwriting, vocal arrangements, and second guitar). With Khoroshev's classically influenced keyboard style, and with all members now making more or less equal writing contributions, the band's sound returned to its eclectic and integrated 1970s progressive rock style. ''The Ladder'' also featured Latin music ingredients and clear world music influences, mostly brought in by Alan White (although Fairbairn's multi-instrumentalist colleague [[Randy Raine-Reusch]] made a strong contribution to the album's textures). One of the album tracks, "Homeworld (The Ladder)", was written for Relic Entertainment's [[Homeworld]], a real-time strategy computer game, and was used as the credits and outro theme.

''The Ladder'' was released in September 1999, peaking at number 36 in the UK and number 99 in the US.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> While [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#The Ladder Tour|on tour in 1999 and early 2000]], Yes recorded their performance at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on 31 October 1999, releasing it in September 2000 as a DVD and live album called ''[[House of Yes: Live from House of Blues]]''. As Sherwood saw his role in Yes as creating and performing new music, and the rest of the band now wished to concentrate on performing the back catalogue, he amicably resigned from Yes at the end of the tour.<ref name="se-sherwood102013"/>

Later in the year, Yes embarked on the three-month [[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#Masterworks Tour|Masterworks tour]] of the United States, on which they performed only material which had been released between 1970 and 1974 (''The Yes Album'' through to ''Relayer''). While on tour, Khoroshev was involved in a backstage incident of sexual assault with a female security guard at Nissan Pavilion in [[Bristow, Virginia]] on 23 July 2000<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2000-07-26/news/0007260043_1_guards-battery-sexually|title=Yes Keyboardist Needs To Keep His Hands On The Keys|work=The Washington Post|publisher=Daily Press|date=26 July 2000|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.pollstar.com/article/touchy-feely-musician-gets-slapped-11021|title=Touchy-Feely Musician Gets Slapped|magazine=Pollstar|date=26 July 2000|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://zenponies.com/yitp/2000/jul/jul28_00.html|title=Yes in the Press|publisher=Zenponies.com|date=28 July 2000|access-date=21 September 2017}}</ref> and parted company with the band at the end of the tour.

=== 2001–2004: ''Magnification'' and further touring ===
In 2001 Yes released their nineteenth studio album ''[[Magnification (album)|Magnification]]''. Recorded without a keyboardist, the album features a 60-piece orchestra conducted by [[Larry Groupé]]; the first time the band used an orchestra since ''Time and a Word'' in 1970. The record was not a chart success; it peaked at number 71 in the UK and number 186 in the US.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> The Yes Symphonic Tour ran from July to December 2001 and had the band performing on stage with an orchestra and American keyboardist [[Tom Brislin]]. Their two shows in Amsterdam, in November, were recorded for their 2002 DVD and 2009 CD release ''[[Symphonic Live]]''. The band invited Wakeman to play with them for the filming, but he was on a solo tour at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfte.org/interviews/rw263.html|title=Conversation with Rick Wakeman|first=Mike|last=Tiano|publisher=Notes from the Edge|date=14 July 2002|access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref>

Following Wakeman's announcement of his return in April 2002, Yes embarked on their [[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#Full Circle Tour|Full Circle Tour]] in 2002–2003 that included their first performances in Australia since 1973.<ref name="billboard03">{{cite magazine|title=''Billboard'' Spotlight: Yes 35th Anniversary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0REEAAAAMBAJ|magazine=Billboard|date=1 November 2003|pages=45–46, 48–50, 55–59|publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc}}</ref> The triple compilation album ''[[The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection]]'' was released in July 2003, reaching number 10 in the UK charts, their highest-charting album since 1991, and number 131 in the US. On 26 January 2004, the film ''[[Yesspeak]]'' premiered in a number of select theatres, followed by a closed-circuit live acoustic performance of the group that was released as ''[[Yes Acoustic: Guaranteed No Hiss]]'' later on. A [[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#35th Anniversary Tour|35th anniversary tour]] followed in 2004 which was documented on the live DVD ''[[Songs from Tsongas]]''.

In 2004 Squire, Howe, and White reunited for one night only with former members [[Trevor Horn]], [[Trevor Rabin]] and [[Geoff Downes]] during a show celebrating Horn's career, performing three Yes songs. The show video was released in DVD in 2008 under the name ''Trevor Horn and Friends: Slaves to the Rhythm''.<ref name=horn2004>{{cite web|title=2004 concert with Trevor Horn|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75O9XiiYHPA|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="SlavesToTheRythm">{{cite web|title=Trevor Horn and Friends: Slaves to Rhythm|url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/108749-trevor-horn-and-friends-slaves-to-rhythm/|website=Popmatter.com|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref>

=== 2004–2010: Hiatus, side collaborations, and new line-up ===
After their 35th Anniversary Tour, Yes described themselves as "on hiatus." During this period, Anderson toured both solo and jointly with Wakeman (for concerts focused largely on Yes material); Squire released his long-awaited second solo album, and White launched his own eponymous band [[White (band)|White]] (subsequently joining fellow Yes-men Tony Kaye and Billy Sherwood in [[Circa (band)|CIRCA]]). Wakeman also continued to release solo material, as did Howe, who released three solo albums and also reunited to record, release and tour with once-and-future Yes bandmate Geoff Downes in the reunion of the original [[Asia (band)|Asia]] line-up. Various members were also involved in overseeing archival releases.

In May 2008 a fortieth anniversary Close to the Edge and Back Tour—which was to feature [[Oliver Wakeman]] on keyboards—was announced. Anderson has said that they had been preparing four new "lengthy, multi-movement compositions" for the tour,<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ex-yes-frontman-jon-anderson-opens-up-about-getting-fired-20110706|title=Ex-Yes Frontman Jon Anderson Opens Up About Getting Fired|publisher=Rolling Stone Music (http://www.rollingstone.com)|author=Andy Greene|date=6 July 2011|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> but he had expressed disinterest in producing a new studio album after the low sales of ''Magnification'', suggesting that recording one was not "logical anymore."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045684/yes-reveals-very-different-new-material|title=Yes Reveals 'Very Different' New Material|magazine=Billboard|author=Gary Graff|date=1 May 2010|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> The tour was abruptly cancelled prior to rehearsals, after Anderson suffered an asthma attack and was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, and was advised by doctors to avoid touring for six months.<ref name="NME">{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/nme-1293-1332478|title=Yes cancel 40th anniversary tour|publisher=NME|date=4 June 2008|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref>

In September 2008 the remaining three members, eager to resume touring regardless of Anderson's availability, announced a tour billed as Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White of Yes, with Oliver Wakeman on keyboards and new lead singer [[Benoît David]], a Canadian musician who'd previously played with [[Mystery (band)|Mystery]] and with Yes tribute band Close to the Edge.<ref name="hardrockhideout">{{cite web|url=http://hardrockhideout.wordpress.com/2008/09/12/yes-to-tour-with-replacement-singer/|title=Yes To Tour With Replacement Singer|author=Rob Rockitt|website=Hard Rock Hideout|date=12 September 2008|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> Anderson expressed his disappointment that his former bandmates had not waited for his recovery, nor handled the situation "in a more gentlemanly fashion," and while he wished them well, he referred to their ongoing endeavours as "solo work" and emphasised his view that their band "is not Yes."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/yes-jon-anderson-disappointed-that-band-recruited-replacement-20080924|author=Daniel Kreps|title=Yes' Jon Anderson "Disappointed" That Band Recruited Replacement|date=24 September 2008|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> As Anderson was a co-owner of the Yes trademark, the remaining members agreed not to tour with the Yes name.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/487686312/|title=Rock bad says Yes to YouTube star|first=Brian|last=Mansfield|newspaper=Calgary Herald|page=C7|date=4 November 2008|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref> The [[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#In the Present Tour|In the Present Tour]] started in November 2008, but it was cut short in the following February when Squire required emergency surgery on an [[aneurysm]] in his leg.<ref name="tour dates cancelled">{{cite news|url=http://www.musicnewsnet.com/2009/02/prog-rockers-yes-cancel-slate-of-gigs.html|title=Prog Rockers YES Cancel Slate of Gigs|author=Mal Westerly|publisher=MusicNewsNet.com|date=12 February 2009|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en/music-database/musician/3327448684dbe1a0846abd180f6a9f4e54a7d/biography|title=Chris Squire|publisher=Radio Swiss Jazz|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> Touring resumed in June 2009 and continued through 2010, with Asia and Peter Frampton supporting the band at several shows.

=== 2010–2015: ''Fly from Here'', ''Heaven & Earth'', and album series tours ===
In August 2010 it was announced that new material had been written for ''[[Fly from Here]]'', Yes' twentieth studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/yes-peter-frampton-performing-at-lucky-star-casino-in-oklahoma/article/3472712/?page=2|title=Yes, Peter Frampton performing at Lucky Star Casino in Oklahoma|author=Genbe Triplett|publisher=NewsOK.com|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/276493|author=Earl Dittman|title=On the road again, Prog-rockers Yes say 'no' to calling it quits|publisher=DigitalJournal|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> Yes then signed a deal with [[Frontiers Records]] and began recording in Los Angeles with Trevor Horn serving as producer. Much of the album material was extrapolated from a pair of songs written by Horn and Geoff Downes around the time that they had been Yes members during 1980 and the ''Drama'' album. During the recording sessions, the band thought it would be wise to bring Downes back to replace Oliver Wakeman on keyboards, reasoning that he was closer to the material. Asserting that all studio recording was to be carried out by "the line-up that actually ... does the work," Howe dispelled rumours that an invitation to sing on the record had been extended to Anderson, who subsequently announced a new project as an ongoing collaboration with former Yes members Wakeman and Rabin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Interview_Steve_Howe_on_Asias_Omega_Touring_With_Yes_and_the_Steve_Howe_Trio?page=2 |title=Interview: Steve Howe on Asia's "Omega," Touring With Yes, and the Steve Howe Trio|date=29 July 2010|publisher=Premier Guitar|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Trevor Rabin Interview|first=Malcolm|last=Dome|journal=Classic Rock Presents ...

In May 2015 news of Squire's diagnosis with [[acute erythroid leukaemia]] was made public.
