'''The World/Inferno Friendship Society''' (also referred to as '''World Inferno''', or '''Inferno''') was an American band from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Its style merged [[Punk rock|punk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[klezmer]] and [[jazz]], while its [[Musical collective|collective]] membership featured [[horn section|horns]], [[piano]] and guitar and had a membership of about 40 players, of whom only about seven to ten active members usually performed at a time. The group was led by singer [[Jack Terricloth]], who was the only constant during the group's history. Terricloth was known for his pointed commentary during shows; his monologues touched on politics and his transformation from the "old school."

Its lyrics often concerned historical or biographical subjects, such as [[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] [[Germany]], [[Peter Lorre]], [[Jeffrey Lee Pierce]] of [[The Gun Club]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Leni Riefenstahl]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Philip K. Dick]], and [[Jonathan Fire*Eater]].

While over 40 Society members have come and gone, Terricloth maintained that the group was "always meant to be this way," and were more of a gang than an actual band. Many members continued to collaborate with the group, but do not join them on tour.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Bandleader Jack Terricloth died in May 2021; no information on the future of the World/Inferno Friendship Society has been released following his death.<ref>{{cite web |title=The World/Inferno Friendship Society’s Jack Terricloth Dead At 50 |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2147801/the-world-inferno-friendship-societys-jack-terricloth-dead-at-50/news |website=Stereogum |access-date=15 May 2021 |language=en |date=14 May 2021}}</ref>

==Hallowmas==
The World/Inferno Friendship Society's annual [[Halloween]] show, Hallowmas, was its most-anticipated performance of the year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The event was known for its elaborate planning and surprises. Past Hallowmases have included a burning effigy of Mr. Terricloth constructed and set alight by a large, caustic cat; an [[Anti-Social Music|ethereal string quartet]] performing throughout the evening in the rear of the hall; circus performances and [[fire breathing]] by the Odd Child Uprising troupe and a cadaverous marching band materializing on stage for the finale, "Pumpkin Time". The song (performed only at Hallowmas shows) includes street rallies, and references [[The Great Pumpkin]] from the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip.
