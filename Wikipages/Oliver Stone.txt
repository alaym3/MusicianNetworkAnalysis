'''William Oliver Stone''' (born September 15, 1946) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oliverstone.com/books|title=The Oliver Stone Experience {{!}} The Official Oliver Stone website {{!}} oliverstone.com|website=www.oliverstone.com|access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-10-best-oliver-stone-films-20120618|title=The 10 Best Oliver Stone Films|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=December 15, 2017|date=June 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/oliver-stone-10-essential-films|title=Oliver Stone: 10 essential films|work=British Film Institute|access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref> Stone won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] as writer of ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (1978), and wrote the gangster film [[remake]] ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (1983). Stone achieved prominence as writer and director of the [[war film|war]] [[drama film|drama]] ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986), which won [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. ''Platoon'' was the first in a trilogy of films based on the [[Vietnam War]], in which Stone served as an infantry soldier. He continued the series with ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1989)—for which Stone won his second Best Director Oscar—and ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'' (1993). Stone's other works include the [[Salvadoran Civil War]]-based [[drama film|drama]] ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'' (1986); the financial drama ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987) and its sequel ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps|Money Never Sleeps]]'' (2010); the [[Jim Morrison]] biographical film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (1991); the [[Satire|satirical]] [[black comedy]] [[crime film]] ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' (1994); a trilogy of films based on the [[President of the United States|American Presidency]]: ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991), ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995), and ''[[W. (film)|W.]]'' (2008); and ''[[Snowden (film)|Snowden]]'' (2016).

Many of Stone's films focus on controversial American political issues during the late 20th century, and as such were considered contentious at the times of their releases. They often combine different camera and film formats within a single scene, as demonstrated in ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991), ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' (1994), and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).<ref>{{cite book|author=James Riordan|date=September 1996|title=Stone: A Biography of Oliver Stone|page=377 |publisher=New York: Aurum Press|isbn= 1-85410-444-6}}</ref>

Stone attended [[Trinity School (New York City)|Trinity School]] in New York City before his parents sent him away to [[The Hill School]], a [[college-preparatory]] school in [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]]. His parents divorced abruptly while he was away at school (1962) and this, because he was an only child, marked him deeply. Stone's mother was often absent and his father made a big impact on his life--perhaps because of this, father-son relationships feature heavily in Stone's films.<ref name="cadwalladr">{{cite news|last=Cadwalladr|first=Carole|title=Oliver Stone and the politics of film-making|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/18/oliver-stone-chavez-wall-street|access-date=July 22, 2010|newspaper=The Observer|date=July 18, 2010|location=paragraphs 31 and 42}}</ref>

He often spent parts of his summer vacations with his maternal grandparents in France, both in Paris and [[La Ferté-sous-Jouarre]] in Seine-et-Marne. Stone also worked at 17 in the Paris mercantile exchange in sugar and cocoa&nbsp;– a job that proved inspirational to Stone for his film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]''.

==Writing and directing career==

===1970s===
[[File:Oliver Stone 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Stone in February 1987]]
Stone graduated from [[New York University]] with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in [[filmmaking|film]] in 1971, where his professors included director and fellow NYU alumnus [[Martin Scorsese]].<ref name=NYMag-10-2013>{{cite web|last=Seitz|first=Matt|title=Oliver Stone on New York in the Sixties and Seventies and Taking Film Classes With Martin Scorsese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2013/10/oliver-stone-on-going-to-nyu-with-scorsese.html|work=Vulture|publisher=New York Magazine|access-date=October 29, 2013|date=October 28, 2013}}</ref> The same year, he had a small acting role in the comedy ''[[The Battle of Love's Return]]''.<ref>M.J. Simpson [http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/interviews/lloydkaufmana.html Interview with Lloyd Kaufman] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621053248/http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/interviews/lloydkaufmana.html |date=June 21, 2008 }}.</ref> Stone made a short, well received 12-minute film ''Last Year in Viet Nam''. He worked as a taxi driver, film production assistant, messenger, and salesman before making his mark in film as a screenwriter in the late 1970s, in the period between his first two films as a director: horror films ''[[Seizure (film)|Seizure]]'' and ''[[The Hand (1981 film)|The Hand]]''.

In 1979, Stone was awarded his first Oscar, after adapting true-life prison story ''[[Midnight Express (book)|Midnight Express]]'' into the successful film [[Midnight Express (film)|of the same name]] for British director [[Alan Parker]] (the two men would later collaborate on the 1996 movie of stage musical ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'').  Stone's screenplay for ''Midnight Express'' was much criticized for its inaccuracies in portraying the events described in the book and vilifying the Turkish people.{{failed verification|date=January 2021}} The original author, [[Billy Hayes (writer)|Billy Hayes]], around whom the film is set, said the film's depiction of prison conditions was accurate. Hayes said that the "message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey. It's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs.' "<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/156011_midnightexpress.html |title=The real Billy Hayes regrets 'Midnight Express' cast all Turks in a bad light |publisher=Seattlepi.com |date=January 10, 2004 |access-date=August 13, 2010 |first1=John |last1=Flinn}}</ref> Stone later apologized to [[Turkey]] for over-dramatizing the script, while standing by the film's stark brutality of Turkish prisons.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krassner |first=Paul |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2005-01-06/news/oliver-stone-apologizes-to-turkey/ |title=Oliver Stone Apologizes to Turkey |publisher=Laweekly.com |date=January 6, 2005 |access-date=September 21, 2016}}</ref>

===1980s===
Stone wrote further features, including [[Brian De Palma]]'s drug lord epic ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]],'' loosely inspired by his own addiction to [[cocaine]], which he successfully kicked while working on the screenplay.''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-total-film-interview-oliver-stone|title=The Total Film Interview&nbsp;– Oliver Stone|date=November 1, 2003|access-date=October 15, 2008|publisher=[[Total Film]]}}</ref>'' He also penned ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'' (co-written with [[Michael Cimino]]) featuring [[Mickey Rourke]], before his career took off as a writer-director in 1986. Like his contemporary Michael Mann, Stone is unusual in having written or co-written most of the films he has directed. In 1986, Stone directed two films back to back: the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'', shot largely in Mexico, and his long in-development Vietnam project ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', shot in the Philippines.

''Platoon'' brought Stone's name to a much wider audience. It also finally kickstarted a busy directing career, which saw him making nine films over the next decade. Alongside some negative reaction, ''Platoon'' won many rave reviews ([[Roger Ebert]] later called it the ninth best film of the 1980s), large audiences, and Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. In 2007, a film industry vote ranked it at number 83 in an [[American Film Institute]] "[[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]]" poll of the previous century's best American movies. British TV channel [[Channel 4]] voted ''Platoon'' as the sixth greatest war film ever made.<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel 4's 100 Greatest War Movies of All Time |url=http://www.thependragon.co.uk/Channel4WarFilms.htm |access-date=August 13, 2011}}</ref> In 2019, ''Platoon'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref name="Chow">{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Andrew R. |date=December 11, 2019 |title=See the 25 New Additions to the National Film Registry, From Purple Rain to Clerks |url=https://time.com/5747503/national-film-registry-2019-additions/ |magazine=Time |location=New York, NY |access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>

''Platoon'' was the first of three films Stone has made about the [[Vietnam War]]: the others were ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' and ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'', each dealing with different aspects of the war. ''Platoon'' is a semi-autobiographical film about Stone's experience in combat; ''Born on the Fourth of July'' is based on the [[Born on the Fourth of July|autobiography]] of US Marine turned peace campaigner [[Ron Kovic]]; ''Heaven & Earth'' is based on the memoir ''[[When Heaven and Earth Changed Places]]'', in which [[Le Ly Hayslip]] recalls her life as a Vietnamese village girl drastically affected by the war and who finds another life in the USA.

Stone also directed ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', which was released in December 1987. Lead performer [[Michael Douglas]] received an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as a ruthless Wall Street corporate raider, and ''[[Talk Radio (film)|Talk Radio]]'', based on [[Eric Bogosian]]'s Pulitzer-nominated play.

===1990s===
''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', released in 1991, received criticism from former Doors keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] during a question and answer session at [[Indiana University East]] in 1997. During the discussion, Manzarek stated that he sat down with Stone about [[the Doors]] and [[Jim Morrison]] for over 12 hours. [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison]]—a rock critic and author—was a consultant on the movie, in which she makes a cameo appearance, but she writes in her memoir ''Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison'' (Dutton, 1992) that Stone ignored everything she told him and proceeded with his own version of events. From the moment the movie was released, she blasted it as untruthful and inaccurate.<ref>{{Cite news |title=She Slams 'Doors' on Portrayal |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |date=March 1991}}</ref> The other surviving former members of the band, [[John Densmore]] and [[Robby Krieger]], also cooperated with the filming of ''Doors'', but Krieger distanced himself from the work before the film's release. However, Densmore thought highly of the film,<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Jim |last=Clash |date=January 25, 2015 |title=Doors Drummer John Densmore On Oliver Stone, Cream's Ginger Baker (Part 3) |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2015/01/25/doors-drummer-john-densmore-on-oliver-stone-creams-ginger-baker-part-3/amp/
|magazine=[[Forbes]] |access-date=May 21, 2021}}</ref> and in fact celebrated its DVD release on a panel with Oliver Stone.

During this same period, Stone directed one of his most ambitious, controversial and successful films: ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', that depicts the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963. In 1991, Stone showed ''JFK'' to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on [[Capitol Hill]], which helped lead to passage of the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:SJ00282:@@@D&summ2=m& |title=Bill Summary & Status – 102nd Congress (1991–1992) – S.J.RES.282 – CRS Summary&nbsp;– THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |access-date=December 12, 2012 |archive-date=January 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127020834/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:SJ00282:@@@D&summ2=m& |url-status=dead }}</ref> of 1992. The [[Assassination Records Review Board]] (created by Congress to lessen, but not end the secrecy surrounding Kennedy's assassination) discussed the film, including Stone's observation at the end of the film, about the dangers inherent in government secrecy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/advisory/arrb98/index.html |title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board |publisher=Fas.org |date=May 30, 2008 |access-date=September 30, 2010}}</ref> Stone published an annotated version of the screenplay, in which he cites references for his claims, shortly after the film's release.

<blockquote>I make my films like you're going to die if you miss the next minute. You better not go get popcorn.<ref>{{cite web |last=Petersen |first=Scott |url=http://www.craveonline.com/filmtv/articles/04648829/3/oliver_stone_natural_born_director.html |title=Oliver Stone: Natural Born Director |publisher=Craveonline.com |access-date=September 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011014931/http://www.craveonline.com/filmtv/articles/04648829/3/oliver_stone_natural_born_director.html |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>

Stone's satire of the modern media, ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' was released in 1994. Originally based on a screenplay by [[Quentin Tarantino]], but significantly rewritten by Stone, [[:it:Richard Rutowski|Richard Rutowski]], and David Veloz,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/natural-born-killers_shoot.html|title="Natural Born Killers", shooting draft, revised by Richard Rutowski & Oliver Stone|website=www.dailyscript.com|access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref> critics recognized its portrayal of violence and the intended satire on the media. Before it was released, the [[MPAA]] gave the film a NC-17 rating; this caused Stone to cut four minutes of film footage in order to obtain an R rating (he eventually released the unrated version on VHS and DVD in 2001). The film was the recipient of the Grand Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000681/1994/1/|title=Venice Film Festival (1994)|website=IMDb|access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref> that year.

Stone went on to direct the 1995 [[Richard Nixon]] biopic ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', which received multiple Oscar nominations for script, [[John Williams]]' score, [[Joan Allen]] as Pat Nixon and [[Anthony Hopkins]]' portrait of the title role. Stone followed ''Nixon'' with the 1997 road movie/film noir, ''[[U Turn (1997 film)|U Turn]]'', and 1999's ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'', a film about power struggles within and without an [[American football]] team.

After a period from 1986 to 1999, where he released a new film at least every 1–2 years, Stone slowed down in the 2000s, though still finding some success.

In 2004, Stone directed ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]''.

Facebook. Retrieved on May 22, 2014.</ref> He further refined the film and in 2014 released the two-part, 3-hour 26-minute ''Alexander: The Ultimate Cut''. After ''Alexander'', Stone went on to direct ''[[World Trade Center (film)|World Trade Center]]'', based on the true story of two [[Port Authority Police Department|PAPD]] policemen who were trapped in the rubble and survived the [[September 11 attacks]].

Stone wrote and directed the [[George W. Bush]] biopic ''[[W. (film)|W.]]'', chronicling the former President's childhood, relationship with his father, struggles with his alcoholism, rediscovery of his Christian faith, and continues the rest of his life up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

On May 22, 2017, various industry papers reported that Stone was going to direct a television series about the [[Guantanamo detention camp]].<ref name=HollywoodReporter2017-05-22/><ref name=MiamiHerald2017-05-22/><ref name=Deadline2017-05-22/><ref name=Variety2017-05-22/> [[Daniel Voll]] was credited with creating the series. [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s production company is financing the series. It was reported that Stone was scheduled to direct every episode of the first season.

=== 2020s ===
In July 2020, Stone teamed with [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] to release his first memoir, titled ''[https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/chasing-the-light/9780358346234 Chasing the Light: Writing, Directing, and Surviving Platoon, Midnight Express, Scarface, Salvador, and the Movie Game]'', which chronicles his turbulent upbringing in New York City, volunteering for combat in Vietnam, and the trials and triumphs of moviemaking in the 1970s and '80s. The book, which ends on his Oscar-winning success [[Platoon (film)|Platoon]], was praised by the [https://www.nytimes.com/section/books/review New York Times], who said, “The Oliver Stone depicted in these pages — vulnerable, introspective, stubbornly tenacious and frequently heartbroken — may just be the most sympathetic character he’s ever written… neatly sets the stage for the possibility of that rarest of Stone productions: a sequel.”[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/books/review/oliver-stone-chasing-the-light.html]

Stone made three documentaries on [[Fidel Castro]]: ''[[Comandante (film)|Comandante]]'' (2003), ''[[Looking for Fidel]]'', and ''Castro in Winter'' (2012). He made ''[[Persona Non Grata (2003 film)|Persona Non Grata]]'', a documentary on Israeli-Palestinian relations, interviewing several notable figures of Israel, including [[Ehud Barak]], [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], and [[Shimon Peres]], as well as [[Yasser Arafat]], leader of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].

In 2009, Stone completed a feature-length documentary, ''[[South of the Border (2009 film)|South of the Border]]'' about the rise of leftist governments in Latin America, featuring seven presidents: [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]]'s [[Evo Morales]], [[Ecuador]]'s [[Rafael Correa]], [[Cuba]]'s [[Raúl Castro]], the [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Kirchners]] of Argentina, [[Brazil]]'s [[Lula da Silva]], and [[Paraguay]]'s [[Fernando Lugo]], all of whom are critical of US foreign policy in South America. Stone hoped the film would get the rest of the Western world to rethink socialist policies in South America, particularly as it was being applied by Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Chávez joined Stone for the premiere of the documentary at the [[Venice International Film Festival]] in September 2009.<ref>

===Sexual harassment allegations===
In 2017, former ''[[Playboy]]'' [[List of Playboy models|model]] [[Carrie Stevens]] alleged that in 1991, Stone had "walked past me and grabbed my boob as he waltzed out the front door of a party."<ref name=sexstone>Maane Khatchatourian, [https://variety.com/2017/film/news/oliver-stone-groping-playboy-model-1202589178/ Oliver Stone Accused of Groping Former Playboy Model in '90s], ''Variety'' (October 13, 2017).</ref>

The allegation Stevens made surfaced after Stone announced he would no longer direct [[The Weinstein Company]]'s television series ''[[Guantanamo (TV series)|Guantanamo]]'' following the revelation of the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations]].<ref name=sexstone /> Stone also drew criticism for his comments on Weinstein, saying

<blockquote>I'm a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial. I believe a man shouldn't be condemned by a vigilante system. It's not easy what he's going through, either. During that period he was a rival. I never did business with him and didn't really know him. I've heard horror stories on everyone in the business, so I'm not going to comment on gossip.

Speaking at the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival|San Sebastián film festival]], Stone said that many Americans had become disillusioned with [[Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration|Barack Obama's policies]], having originally thought he would be "a man of great integrity." He said: "On the contrary, Obama has doubled down on the (George W.)

In a January 2010 press conference announcing his documentary series on the history of the United States, he said: "Hitler is an easy scapegoat throughout history and it's been used cheaply.

Interviewed by London's ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' on July 25, 2010, Stone said: "Hitler did far more damage to the Russians than the Jewish people, 25 or 30 [million killed]". He objected to what he termed "the Jewish domination of the media", appearing to be critical of the coverage of [[the Holocaust]], adding "There's a major lobby in the United States.

A day later, Stone stated:

<blockquote>In trying to make a broader historical point about the range of atrocities the Germans committed against many people, I made a clumsy association about the Holocaust, for which I am sorry and I regret. Jews obviously do not control media or any other industry. The fact that the Holocaust is still a very important, vivid and current matter today is, in fact, a great credit to the very hard work of a broad coalition of people committed to the remembrance of this atrocity—and it was an atrocity.<ref name="wsj">[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/07/26/oliver-stone-sorry-about-holocaust-comments “Oliver Stone 'Sorry' About Holocaust Comments”].

In December 2014, Stone made statements supporting the Russian government's narrative on Ukraine, portraying the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] plot. He also refutes the claim that former Ukrainian president (who was ousted as a result of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution) [[Viktor Yanukovych]], was responsible for the [[List of people killed during Euromaidan|killing of protesters]] as claimed by the new Ukrainian government. He said Yanukovych was the legitimate president who was forced to leave Ukraine by "well-armed, [[neo-Nazi]] radicals".

===Russia===
In a June 2017 interview with ''[[The Nation]]'' to promote his documentary on [[Vladimir Putin]], Stone rejected the consensus findings of the United States’ intelligence agencies that [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russia sought to influence]] the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]. Stone accused the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and [[National Security Agency|NSA]] of cooking the intelligence. He said: "The influence on the election from the Russians to me is absurd to the naked eye. Israel has far more influence on American elections through AIPAC. Saudi Arabia has influence through money… [[Sheldon Adelson]] and the [[Koch brothers]] have much more influence on American elections… And the prime minister of Israel comes to our country and addresses Congress to criticize the president's policy in Iran at the time—that's pretty outrageous."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/oliver-stone-talks-to-the-nation-about-his-new-documentary-the-putin-interviews/|title=Oliver Stone Talks to 'The Nation' About His New Documentary 'The Putin Interviews'|last=Rampell|first=Ed|journal=The Nation|date=June 12, 2017|access-date=February 15, 2019|issn=0027-8378}}</ref>
