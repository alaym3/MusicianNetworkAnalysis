'''EPMD''' is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo from [[Brentwood, New York|Brentwood]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The duo's name is a concatenation of the members' names "E" and "PMD" or an [[acronym]] for "'''Erick and Parrish Making Dollars'''", referencing its members: [[rappers|emcees]] [[Erick Sermon]] ("E" a.k.a. E Double) and [[Parrish Smith]] ("PMD" a.k.a. Parrish Mic Doc). During an interview on college radio station WHOV in 1987, Parrish Smith stated that the name evolved from the original: "We were originally known as "EEPMD" (Easy Erick and Parrish the Microphone Doctor), but chose to go with EPMD because it was easier to say." He also stated that they dropped the two "E's" because [[N.W.A]].'s Eric Wright was already using "[[Eazy-E]]" as his stage name. The group has been active for {{Age|1987|1|1}} years (minus two breakups in 1993 and 1999), and is one of the most prominent acts in [[east coast hip hop]].

==History==

===Early years and mainstream success: 1987–1992===
Hailing from [[Brentwood, New York|Brentwood]], [[Long Island, New York]], EPMD's first [[album]], ''[[Strictly Business (EPMD album)|Strictly Business]]'', appeared in 1988 and featured the underground hit "Strictly Business," which sampled [[Eric Clapton]]'s version of [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]." Many critics cite this first album as the group's most influential.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The group's brand of funk-fueled [[sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy hip-hop proved to be a major force in the genre. Unlike [[old school hip hop]], which was originally based on [[disco]] hits but eventually became more [[electro (music)|electronic]], EPMD based its music mainly on lifting funk and rock breaks for samples and helped to popularize their usage, along with [[Marley Marl]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. "You're a Customer" combined snippets of [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]]'s "[[Fly Like an Eagle (song)|Fly Like an Eagle]]," [[Kool & the Gang]]'s "[[Jungle Boogie]], the bass line from [[ZZ Top]]'s "[[Cheap Sunglasses]]" and drum beat (Roger Linn LM-2 machine).  "Jane," about a romantic rendezvous gone bad, would be revisited on no less than five sequels; a first for hip-hop. "[[You Gots to Chill]]" used 1980s funk band [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]]'s "More Bounce to the Ounce," which has become one of the most enduring sample sources for hip-hop. EPMD later appeared on the single "Everybody (Get Up)" by [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]] frontman [[Roger Troutman]] on his last solo album, [[Bridging the Gap (Roger Troutman album)|''Bridging The Gap'']], in 1991. "I'm Housin'" was covered some 12 years later by [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Managed early on by [[Russell Simmons]]' RUSH Management, the group toured with such hip-hop luminaries as [[Run-DMC]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince]].<ref name=ALLMUSIC>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p36/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography]</ref>

[[File:EPMD Business as Usual (shirt).jpg|thumb|right|270px|Promotional EPMD T-shirt for its 1990 ''Business as Usual'' album]]

EPMD signed with [[Sleeping Bag Records|Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records]], which eventually released its debut album, ''[[Strictly Business (EPMD album)|Strictly Business]]'', by [[Electro (music)|electro funk]] pioneer [[Kurtis Mantronik]], who also worked as an [[A&R]] representative for the label. Propelled by several strong singles ("You Gots to Chill" and the album's title track), the album was eventually certified gold, selling over 500,000 copies{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, as did 1989's follow-up, ''[[Unfinished Business (EPMD album)|Unfinished Business]]''. Financial frustrations followed when Sleeping Bag went under in 1992. The two EPMD albums and [[Nice & Smooth]]'s debut album were acquired by [[Priority Records|Priority/EMI Records]] before the label was sold to Warlock Records. The duo's Sleeping Bag contract was acquired by [[Def Jam Records|Def Jam]]. EPMD returned in 1990 with ''[[Business As Usual (EPMD album)|Business As Usual]]'' and ''[[Business Never Personal]]'' two years later. By 1992, the group presided over an extended family dubbed the [[Hit Squad]], which included [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[K-Solo]], [[Das EFX]], [[Hurricane G]], and [[Knucklehedz]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC"/>

In 1992, EPMD had a hit with its song "Crossover," which lamented rappers making blatant concessions to pop sensibilities in order to get mainstream attention from music audiences.<ref name="ALLMUSIC"/> The song became a hit, peaking at No. 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and in doing so becoming their biggest hit to date.

===First breakup and Feud: 1993–1996===
EPMD called it quits in 1993, under controversial circumstances. According to interviews in ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' and ''Rap Pages'', in late 1991, Smith's house was burglarized by armed intruders. According to Smith, in the ensuing police investigation, one of the apprehended culprits supposedly gave up Sermon's name as having allegedly paid them to do it. Sermon was arrested and briefly detained for questioning, but no charges were filed. Still, it led to lingering tensions, and by the time of the break-up, Sermon alleged financial impropriety on Smith's part. The duo found itself as solo artists by default: Sermon debuted in 1993 with ''[[No Pressure (Erick Sermon album)|No Pressure]]'', followed by ''[[Double or Nothing (Erick Sermon album)|Double or Nothing]]'' (1995), ''[[Def Squad Presents Erick Onasis]]'' (2000), ''[[Music (Erick Sermon album)|Music]]'' (2001), and ''React'' (2002). Smith released 1994's ''[[Shade Business]]'', followed by ''[[Business Is Business (album)|Business is Business]]'' in 1996.<ref name="ALLMUSIC"/>

===First reunion and second breakup: 1997–2005===
The duo reunited in 1997, recording a comeback LP, ''[[Back in Business (EPMD album)|Back in Business]]''. In 1998, a remix of the song "Strictly Business" appeared by the A&R man who signed the duo while at Fresh/Sleeping Bag, [[Kurtis Mantronik]]. Sermon released an album with Redman and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]] as the [[Def Squad]] in 1998: ''[[El Niño (Def Squad album)|El Niño]]'' was certified gold{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} that same year. EPMD's last LP, ''[[Out of Business]]'', was released in 1999 as both a single CD and a [[special edition|limited edition]] [[double CD]]. The limited edition double CD contained both new material and rerecorded versions of its greatest hits. Smith released ''[[The Awakening (PMD album)|The Awakening]]'' (2003) on his own Hit Squad label, and Sermon released ''[[Chilltown, N.Y.]]'' (2004) on [[Motown Records|Motown/Universal]]. A [[Hit Squad]] compilation LP (overseen by Smith, featuring a new EPMD track) was released on Nervous Recordings in 2004.<ref name="ALLMUSIC"/>

===Second reunion: 2006–present===
A reunited EPMD with [[DJ Scratch]] performed live at the Rock the Bells Tour in New York on October 14, 2006 at ''B.B. King Blues Club & Grill'', their first NYC show in eight years. The tour also featured former Hit Squad members Keith Murray, Das EFX, and Redman. 

Two months later, EPMD and Keith Murray released a new song, titled "The Main Event," produced by ''DJ Knowhow''. In the March 2007 issue of Swedish hip-hop magazine ''Quote'', Erick Sermon and Parish Smith talked about whether the duo planned to record together again. On its recent tour, the group announced that it was working on a new album, tentatively titled ''We Mean Business''.

On June 27, 2007, the group appeared on BET's ''Rap City'' to freestyle.  EPMD's new single, "Blow",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/blogs/multimedia__music/archive/2007/08/08/18378990.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014021359/http://allhiphop.com/blogs/multimedia__music/archive/2007/08/08/18378990.aspx|url-status=dead|title=Multimedia / Music : EPMD|archive-date=14 October 2007|access-date=22 June 2021}}</ref> was released on vinyl from Unique Distribution during August 2007 as a prelude to a new album that was to be released in 2008. The song instantly became a regular feature on the [[Funkmaster Flex]] show. The same month, the duo made a number of surprise live appearances, including the Rock the Bells tour with [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Cypress Hill]], [[Mos Def]] and others.

In June 2008, during an interview with HipHopGame, Erick and Parish confirmed that ''[[We Mean Business (album)|We Mean Business]]'' would be released on September 9. The album eventually emerged in December 2008, and featured guest appearances from the likes of [[KRS-One]] and [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] amongst others. In the end of the interview, they mentioned the possibility of a [[Hit Squad]]/[[Def Squad]] double disc album, but that they had problems with [[K-Solo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=epmd |title=Exclusive Hip Hop News, Audio, Lyrics, Videos, Honeys, Wear, Sneakers, Download Mixtapes |publisher=Hiphopgame.com |date=2008-06-25 |access-date=2013-03-05}}</ref>

On August 3, 2008, EPMD joined [[Method Man & Redman]] on stage at the Rock The Bells concert at Jones Beach, New York.

The following month, EPMD took the stage as part of AllHipHop.com's ''Breeding Ground'' event at S.O.B.'s in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allhiphop.com/photos/flicks/picture20528991.aspx |title=Allhiphop |publisher=Allhiphop |date=2009-10-12 |access-date=2013-03-05}}</ref> The duo performed many of their early hits and featured Keith Murray as a guest.

In March 2011, EPMD performed at the Lawyer4Musicians Hiphop showcase at Venue 222 in Austin, Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://do512.com/event/2011/03/18/l4m-2011-hiphop-showcase-feat-epmd-cool-kids-das-racist-and-more |title=L4M 2011 HIPHOP SHOWCASE feat EPMD, COOL KIDS, DAS RACIST, and MORE! at Venue 222, Austin on Do512 |publisher=Do512.com |date=2011-03-18 |access-date=2012-03-30}}</ref> It was the duo's first time performing in Austin, where they performed many of their early hits as well as cover songs and freestyle rhymes.
