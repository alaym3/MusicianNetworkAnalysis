==History==

===Early years (1975–1978)===
[[File:Cartandhorses.jpg|thumb|right|The Cart and Horses Pub, located in Maryland Point, Stratford, was where Iron Maiden played some of their first shows in 1976. The building was officially named "The Birthplace of Iron Maiden".{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004a|1p=29|2a1=Bushell|2a2=Halfin|2y=1985a|2p=9}}]]

Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975 by bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas]], the title of which reminded him of the [[iron maiden|iron maiden torture device]].{{sfn|Barton|1979}} After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in [[Maryland, London|Maryland]], Stratford.{{sfn|Wall|2004b|p=29}} A few decades later the pub in Maryland was officially named "The Birthplace of Iron Maiden" and turned into a music pub with many mementos of the band's early years as part of London's rock music history.{{sfn|Cart and Horses|2021}}

The original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist [[Paul Day (musician)|Paul Day]] being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked "energy or charisma on stage".{{sfn|Wall|2004c|p=32}} He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances.{{sfn|Wall|2004c|p=32}} Wilcock's friend, [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.{{sfn|Wall|2004d|p=33}} Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976,{{sfn|Wall|2004d|p=33}} though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases.

[[File:Harris 1.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]
Iron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.{{sfn|Wall|2004e|p=44}} Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,{{sfn|Wall|2004f|p=46}} as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.{{sfn|EMI|2004}} A new line-up was put together, including future [[Cutting Crew]] member [[Tony Moore (musician)|Tony Moore]] on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]] (better known today as Thunderstick). A poor performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town,{{sfn|Wall|2004g|p=23}} in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert. Afterwards, Iron Maiden fired Purkis and replaced him with [[Doug Sampson]].{{sfn|Wall|2004h|p=48}} At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound.{{sfn|Wall|2004i|p=48}} A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated.{{sfn|Wall|2004j|p=50}} As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return, and was also dismissed.{{sfn|EMI|2004}}

Harris, Murray, and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.{{sfn|Wall|2004k|p=52}} A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in [[Leytonstone]] in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist [[Paul Di'Anno]].{{sfn|Wall|2004l|p=54}} Steve Harris stated, "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge."{{sfn|Wall|2004m|p=53}} At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, "Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult."{{sfn|Wall|2004n|p=64}}

===Record contract and early releases (1978–1981)===
{{main|The Soundhouse Tapes|Iron Maiden (album)|Killers (Iron Maiden album)}}

On New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.{{sfn|Wall|2004o|p=66}} Hoping that the recording would help them secure more gigs,{{sfn|Wall|2004o|p=66}} the band presented a copy to [[Neal Kay]], then managing a heavy metal club called "Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.{{sfn|Wall|2004p|p=67}} Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, "Prowler", eventually went to No.&nbsp;1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wall|2004r|pp=104–105}} A copy was also acquired by [[Rod Smallwood]], who soon became the band's manager,{{sfn|Wall|2004s|p=83}} and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as ''[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]'', named after the club.{{sfn|Wall|2004t|p=103}} Featuring only three tracks (one song, "Strange World", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production){{sfn|Wall|2004u|p=102}} all five thousand copies sold out within weeks.{{sfn|Wall|2004v|pp=104–105}}

[[File:IRON MAIDEN - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Di'Anno]] and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] supporting [[Judas Priest]] on their British Steel Tour, 1980]]
In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with [[EMI]],{{sfn|Wall|2004w|p=108}} and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, [[Adrian Smith]] of [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], to join the group as their second guitarist.{{sfn|Wall|2004z|pp=163–164}} Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and [[Dennis Stratton]] was hired instead.{{sfn|Wall|2004aa|p=121}} Shortly afterwards, [[Doug Sampson]] left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-[[Samson (band)|Samson]] drummer [[Clive Burr]] at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.{{sfn|Wall|2004bb|p=123}} Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the ''[[Metal for Muthas]]'' compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of "[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]" and "Wrathchild".{{sfn|Wall|2004cc|p=137}} The release led to an [[Metal for Muthas Tour|ensuing tour]] which featured several other bands linked with the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] ([[NWoBHM]]) movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004dd|1p=139|2a1=Saulnier|2y=2012dd}} According to different sources between May 1976 and December 1979 the band played about 200 shows in [[Great Britain]].{{sfn|SetlistED|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

Iron Maiden released their [[Iron Maiden (album)|self-titled album]] in 1980, which debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Wall|2004ee|p=143}} The album includes other early favourites such as "[[Running Free]]", "Transylvania", "Phantom of the Opera", and "[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]" – which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a [[Iron Maiden Tour|headline tour of the UK]], before opening for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their 1980 [[Unmasked Tour]]'s European leg as well as supporting [[Judas Priest]] on [[British Steel Tour|select dates]]. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980 with almost 40,000 in attendance. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with [[UFO (band)|UFO]] headlining. After the Kiss tour, [[Dennis Stratton]] was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,{{sfn|Hinchcliffe|1999}} and was replaced by [[Adrian Smith]] in October 1980. In Europe Iron Maiden played 28 shows to about 400,000 people (mainly [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fans). In December musicians played [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London where the very first band's live video was filmed. ''[[Live at the Rainbow]]'' was released in May 1981 and the cuts "Iron Maiden" and "Wrathchild" from this video received heavy rotation on [[MTV]] during its first hours on the air as the first metal videos ever.{{sfn|First Albums|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|Roland|2013}}

An eponymous debut album achieved critical acclaim in [[Japan]] where Iron Maiden were named "The Best Newcoming Foreign Band" by readers of Music Life magazine and received their the very first Gold certificate.{{sfn|Japan 1980|2021}} Four decades later Iron Maiden's debut album was ranked No.&nbsp;13 of "The Greatest Hard Rock & Metal Albums Ever" published by journalists of opinion-forming [[Rolling Stone]] magazine and also named the third most important metal debut album of all time. ''Iron Maiden'' is ranked at the similar positions in many other polls worldwide.{{sfn|40Anni|2021}}{{sfn|40Anos|2021}}

In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]''. Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: "Prodigal Son" and "Murders in the Rue Morgue"{{sfn|Wall|2004ff|p=183}} (the latter's title was taken from the [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).{{sfn|Brannigan}} The leitmotif of the lyrics was a murder contemplated from different perspectives.{{sfn|First Albums|2021}} Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,{{sfn|Wall|2004gg|p=145}} the band hired veteran producer [[Martin Birch]],{{sfn|Wall|2004hh|p=181}} who would continue to work with Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.{{sfn|Wall|2004ii|p=300}} The record was followed by the band's first [[Killer World Tour|world tour]], which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at [[Aladdin (hotel and casino)|The Aladdin Casino]] in Las Vegas. Iron Maiden played 45 shows in [[North America]] to several hundred thousand fans, including two headline gigs in Canada.{{sfn|USA1981|2021}}{{sfn|Wall|2004jj|p=251}} ''Killers'' made the band's USA album charts debut, reaching No.&nbsp;78 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Billboard}} Iron Maiden booked 132 shows to promote their second album.{{sfn|Tour1981|2021}} Musicians played the small or mid-size venues using standard type of stage equipment including 200 lamps, smoke machines, two backdrops with [[Eddie (Iron Maiden)|Eddie]] and four members of the crew wearing Eddie's masks during the "Iron Maiden" song live performance.{{sfn|Tour1981|2021}}

[[File:Iron Maiden, Steve Harris - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|Iron Maiden on stage, [[Killer World Tour]] 1981]]
The band's second album featured, among others single "[[Twilight Zone (Iron Maiden song)|Twilight Zone/Wrathchild]]" (released with double A-side) and speed metal opus "[[Purgatory (song)|Purgatory]]" as well as two instrumental songs "The Ides of March", "Genghis Khan" and the title track being a proto-thrash composition.{{sfn|KillSingles|2021}} The music style of the album inspired generations of thrash, speed and power metal bands. The cover illustration by [[Derek Riggs]] became the first of many more iconic in the history of the genre.{{sfn|First Albums|2021}} ''Killers''' sold much better worldwide than their debut, hitting the million mark a year after launch, earning the group Gold certificates in [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Canada]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]] (double Gold) and in [[United Kingdom]]. Album debuted at No.&nbsp;12 in the UK and reached Top 10 and Top 20 in many countries around the world.{{sfn|First Albums|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

The UK tour included the band's headline performance at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]]. Paul Di'Anno's addiction problems led to the cancellation of several German dates. In some cities, local fans reacted with street riots. Iron Maiden toured [[Japan]] for the first time in seven shows. All tickets were sold out in record time, but problems with Di'Anno forced the band to cancel two shows. The concert recordings from [[Nagoya]] were used on the mini-album ''[[Maiden Japan]]'' (''[[Heavy Metal Army]]'' in Japan) released in September 1981.{{sfn|First Albums|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} Musicians visited [[Yugoslavia]] to be a headliner of the Belgrade festival with 50,000 people. It was the first time the band had played behind the [[Iron Curtain]] and also a groundbreaking performance for a new generation of heavy metal artists at the so-called [[Eastern Bloc]].{{sfn|Juras1981|2021|pp=178–184}} During the summer, Iron Maiden played several festivals in Europe, including appearances as "very special guests" at the Golden Summernights 1981 festival series held at [[Zeppelinfeld]] in [[Nuremberg]] with 100,000 people, but also in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Darmstadt]] in front of an audience of several dozen thousand.{{Sfn|DDotB|2021}}

===Success (1981–1985)===
{{main|The Number of the Beast (album)|Piece of Mind|Powerslave|Live After Death}}

By 1981, [[Paul Di'Anno]] was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} about which Di'Anno comments, "it wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day&nbsp;... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much."{{sfn|Wall|2004kk|p=194}} With his performances waning, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour,{{sfn|Wall|2004ll|p=219}} at which point the band had already selected his replacement.{{sfn|Wall|2004mm|p=218}}

[[File:Iron Maiden in San Sebastian.jpg|thumb|Stage set 1982]]
After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]],{{sfn|Wall|2004nn|p=217}} [[Bruce Dickinson]], previously of [[Samson (band)|Samson]], auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.{{sfn|Walloo|2004|p=218}} The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004pp|p=219}} For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played "Children of the Damned" and "22 Acacia Avenue", introducing fans to the sound towards which they were progressing.{{sfn|Dome|2014}}

In 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]''. This became the band's first UK Albums Chart No.&nbsp;1 record,{{sfn|Wall|2004rr|p=227}} was a Top Ten hit in many other countries, and reached No.&nbsp;33 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Billboard}}{{sfn|Wall|2004ss|p=228}} At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management, and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a "moral contribution" to "Children of the Damned", "The Prisoner" and "[[Run to the Hills]]".{{sfn|Shooman|2007aa|p=82}} For the second time the band embarked on a world tour, dubbed [[The Beast on the Road]], during which they visited North America, Japan, Australia, and Europe, including a headline appearance for 40,000 people at the [[Reading festival|Reading Festival]]. Iron Maiden played 188 shows in 10 months.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} For the very first time they presented conceptual setting including specially designed stage and lighting composed of almost 400 lamps. Also for the first time in the history of the band, the movable, three-meter Eddie was presented on stage during the performance of the song "Iron Maiden".{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

The Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed that Iron Maiden were [[Satanism|Satanic]] because of the new album's title track and demonic cover art,{{sfn|Wall|2004tt|p=228}} to the point where a group of Christian [[activism|activists]] destroyed Iron Maiden records in protest.{{sfn|Young(1)}} In recent years, Dickinson stated that the band treated this as "silliness",{{sfn|Eagle Vision|2001}} and that the demonstrations in fact gave them "loads of publicity".{{sfn|EMI|2004}} An American professor Bryan A. Bardine referring to visual aspect of band's third album stated the authors' message seems to be understandable: "this album evokes power, passion and music that present darker themes and images."{{Sfn|Bayer|2009|pp=133–134}}

The band played over 100 dates in North America supporting [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]. Iron Maiden headlined some Canadian dates, New York, Chicago free show and the other soloed stops. They also performed at the biggest American festivals ([[Day on the Green]], SuperFest, Pacific Jam, Rock Fest) which were held on big stadiums as [[Rich Stadium]], [[Anaheim Stadium]], [[Oakland Alameda Coliseum]] or [[Comiskey Park]] among many others.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} Iron Maiden were quickly promoted to the hard rock extra-league and avantgarde of heavy metal. ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' is considered as the ground-breaking album for modern heavy metal and has been back on the album sales charts and the all time heavy metal albums polls constantly.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|Golden Era|2021}} The album's crowning track entitled "[[Hallowed Be Thy Name (song)|Hallowed Be Thy Name]]" is considered one of a few most important in the history of the genre, it has repeatedly held leading positions in various polls.{{sfn|Hallowed|2021}} After the first year of its release 2,5 million copies were sold.{{sfn|39Anos|2021}} A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; by 2010, the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide.{{sfn|Pfanner|2010}} The "Golden Era" in the band's history has begun{{sfn|Golden Era|2021}} In December 1982, drummer [[Clive Burr]] was fired from the band and replaced by [[Nicko McBrain]], who previously played for [[Trust (French band)|Trust]].{{sfn|Wall|2004uu|p=233}} Although Harris stated that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities,{{sfn|Wall|2004ww|pp=232–233}} Burr objected to this, and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.{{sfn|Marlow|2011}}

Soon afterwards, the band journeyed for the first time to The Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at [[Compass Point Studios]].{{sfn|Wall|2004vv|p=246}} In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', which reached the No.&nbsp;3 spot in the UK,{{sfn|Wall|2004zz|p=247}} and No.&nbsp;14 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Billboard}} ''Piece of Mind'' features the successful singles "[[The Trooper]]" and "[[Flight of Icarus]]", the latter being notable as one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.{{sfn|Wall|2004aaa|p=245}} The other notable songs of the album are "Where Eagles Dare" (based on so same entitled movie with [[Clint Eastwood]] starring), "Revelations", "Die with Your Boots On" and an epic "To Tame a Land" based on [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel titled "Dune".{{sfn|PoM Album|2021}} Iron Maiden played 151 concerts in Europe and North America as a part of [[World Piece Tour]]. For the very the first time they booked a massive North America tour as headliners.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} Nearly 90 shows took place in 10,000 + capacity arenas, and the band sold out [[Madison Square Garden]] with a crowd of 20,000.{{sfn|WPT|2021}} In London, they played four consecutive nights at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]], then toured many large venues across [[Western Europe]], including an extensive German leg. The World Piece Tour was summed up by two headlining performances at the Rock & Pop Festival at the [[Westfalenhallen|Westfalenhalle]] in Dortmund. The show was broadcast live to 300 million people with the exception of the song "Iron Maiden" due to the band's "violent behaviour on stage".{{sfn|WPT|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

The setting of the tour was the next step in the visual development of the band's concerts. Iron Maiden used, inter alia, 100,000 watts sound system for the first time in the history of a group specially designed for large sports arenas.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} The lighting equipment, in addition to the standard ramps with spots, included four movable, triangular ramps, rising to different heights above the stage and illuminating the audience from different angles. Those ones were the first ramps of this type in the world, and their construction became a significant step forward as a starting point for the creation of mobile, extensive lighting systems used on subsequent routes. The lighting platform was built on the basis of over 520 lamps.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} As with the previous tour, the band had a conceptual set design with a number of props referring to the image of the promoted album, the movable Eddie and his big head emerging from behind the stage, also more use was made of pyrotechnics.{{sfn|Golden Era|2021}}

UK magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' summed up the passing year, and readers were asked to select one hundred best metal albums of all time, with ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' ranked first, followed by ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', and the band's other releases were in the Top 50.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} The rankings in other regions of the world looked similar. Iron Maiden became the most serious contenders for the title of "the biggest heavy metal formation in the world". In the year of the premiere, the circulation of the fourth album exceeded 2 million copies sold.{{sfn|Golden Era|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} In September 1983 the band released a video compilation ''[[Video Pieces]]'' containing official clips from ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' and ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' albums.{{sfn|Piece Videos|2021}}

Soon after the success of ''Piece of Mind'' and its [[World Piece Tour|supporting tour]], the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Powerslave]]'', on 9 September 1984. The album features the singles "[[2 Minutes to Midnight]]" and "[[Aces High (song)|Aces High]]", an emotional title track as well as "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", based on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poem of the same name]], and running over 13 minutes in length.{{sfn|Wall|2004bbb|p=253}} ''Powerslave'' was another chart success, reaching No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]{{sfn|Billboard}} and No.&nbsp;2 in the UK as a result of band's record company EMI's third ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' pop compilation which should not be listed.{{sfn|UK Charts|2021}}{{sfn|Wall|2004ccc|pp=253–255}}

The tour, following the album, dubbed the [[World Slavery Tour]], was the band's largest to date, consisting of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,{{sfn|Wall|2004ddd|p=253}} playing to an estimated three and a half million people.{{sfn|LouderSound|2021}}{{sfn|Stenning 1|2006|p=102}} The most elaborate tour to date was famous from using the custom made props, such as the extendible golden [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], 33-foot [[Eddie (mascot)|Eddie]] appearing as big one and mummified walking phantom, the conceptual stage set with an [[Ancient Egyptian]] motives and extensive [[pyrotechnics]].{{sfn|LouderSound|2021}} The band's own equipment travelled in six 45 foot articulated trucks, and touring needed three buses for 60 road crew and two more for musicians. The PA front system power had 153,000 watts and an additional 21,000 for stage monitors. A custom-built and flexible lighting rig held nearly 800 lamps in vast triangular ramps of moving aluminium. The band's 2008–2009 tour, [[Somewhere Back in Time World Tour]], featured a stage set which largely emulated the World Slavery Tour.{{sfn|WST|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

The enterprise started in August 1984 with five shows in [[Poland]]. Iron Maiden were the first Western artists which brought the full-scale production behind the [[Iron Curtain]].{{sfn|Golden Era|2021}} Average attendance in Poland was estimated as 12,000 people plus few thousands outside each night. The inaugural show in [[Warsaw]] held at [[Torwar Hall|Torwar Arena]] gathered over 14,000 people and five thousand more listened outside.{{sfn|IMBio|2021}}{{sfn|WST1|2021}} In Budapest, some 50,000 fans filled a parking lot.{{sfn|IMHUU|2021}}{{sfn|IMHU|2021}} Iron Maiden played to capacity crowds all over Europe and the UK. 105 dates in North America were massive successes. Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts at [[Long Beach Arena]] for combined audience of 54,000 fans.{{sfn|Golden Era|2021}} In New York City, the band played five nights at [[Radio City Music Hall]] and only Dickinson's illness prevented the five scheduled shows from being seven.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

The band's third official video entitled ''[[Behind the Iron Curtain (video)|Behind the Iron Curtain]]'' was released in October 1984. The [[World Slavery Tour]] documentary brought footage of the band touring the [[Eastern Europe]] in 1984, performing shows in visited countries, and additionally portrayed the musicians as playing at the Polish wedding in [[Poznań]]. The video contained two promotional clips for songs from the ''[[Powerslave]]'' album, brand new live tracks and special interviews with musicians and members of the road crew. ''Behind the Iron Curtain'' was the first documentary published by a Western artist which pictured them touring the countries of [[Eastern Bloc]]. MTV broadcast an expanded version (about one hour long) of this document, which became a part of the ''[[Live After Death|Live After Death DVD]]'' released in February 2008.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|BTRC|2021}}

Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined (with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) the [[Rock in Rio]] festival to an estimated 350,000 in attendance.{{sfn|EMI|2008}} The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).{{sfn|Wall|2004eee|p=258}} This was the first substantial break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,{{sfn|Stenning 2|2006|p=104}} with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.{{sfn|Wall|2004fff|p=255}} In October 1985 Iron Maiden published their first double live album, ''[[Live After Death]]'', which was a critical and commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;19 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''{{sfn|Billboard}} and No.&nbsp;2 in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004ggg|p=257}} The album was recorded at [[Long Beach Arena]] and also features additional tracks from four nights at London's [[Hammersmith Apollo]]. ''Live After Death'' is widely regarded as one of the greatest live albums of all time and has been described by [[Classic Rock (magazine)|''Classic Rock'']] as "the last great live album of the vinyl era" and seminal heavy metal live release.{{sfn|LAD|2021|p=193}}{{sfn|Live Coll|2021}} Along with the album a same-titled official video was also released and debuted at No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts and topped music video charts worldwide. ''Live After Death'' live video was digitally remastered and released in 2008 as a part of the "History of Iron Maiden" series.{{sfn|IMBio|2021}} In November 1985, Iron Maiden were named the best rock and metal band in the world and awarded at Public Choice International. This recognition sealed their status as the biggest heavy metal band in the world.{{sfn|IPCH1985|2021}}

===Experimentation (1986–1989)===
{{main|Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son}}

Returning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]].'' For the first time in the band's history, this featured [[synthesiser|synthesised]] bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.{{sfn|Huey(3)}} The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single "[[Wasted Years]]", but notably included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004hhh|p=260}} While Dickinson was focused on his own music, guitarist Adrian Smith, who typically collaborated with the vocalist, was "left to [his] own devices" and began writing songs on his own, coming up with "Wasted Years", "Sea of Madness", and "[[Stranger in a Strange Land (Iron Maiden song)|Stranger in a Strange Land]]",{{sfn|Wall|2004iii|p=261}} the last of which would be the album's second single.{{sfn|Wall|2004jjj|p=260}} The album was the band's biggest American chart success to date, reaching No.&nbsp;11 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''{{sfn|Billboard}} and No.&nbsp;2 in the UK charts. Album immediately reached Gold status in the UK and Platinum in the States where eventually went Double Platinum according to band's official biography "Run to the Hills".{{sfn|Wall|2004kkk|p=257}} The [[Somewhere on Tour]] production was the most ambitious to date. ''Somewhere in Time'' features "Caught Somewhere in Time" as an opening track, anthemic "Heaven Can wait" and progressive epic opus "Alexander the Great" crowning the album.{{sfn|SOT|2021}} Band used seven 45 foot articulated trucks packed with over 100 tons of equipment, three crowd buses for 60 people and two nightliners for five musicians. The band – owned customised Turbosound system was probably the biggest in the world used indoors. Total power (PA and stage monitors) was estimated at 180,000 watts. The vast and flexible lighting rig held over 1100 lamps hanged over futuristic stage set including flying space ships, inflatable props, laser guns, pyrotechnics, hydraulic stands, backdrops and monumental Eddie's appearance.{{sfn|SOT|2021}}

[[Somewhere on Tour]] was a big success everywhere. Band played 157 shows to two and a half million of fans. 81 shows in North America were spectacular success and musicians booked the bigger indoor arenas and some stadiums too. Once again Iron Maiden visited Poland, Hungary and [[Yugoslavia]] to play for tens of thousands fans in each country.{{sfn|IMBio|2021}} Massive UK leg including six nights at Hammersmith Odeon was sold out in advance.{{sfn|SOT|2021}} In October 1987 Iron Maiden released ''[[12 Wasted Years]]'' video documentary, focusing on the history of the band from 1975 to 1987. It included several rare videos and interviews from the band's career, some of which were later included on the 2004 documentary ''[[The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days|The Early Days]]''. In March 2013, Iron Maiden included the full documentary in a reissue of their 1989 concert film, ''[[Maiden England]]''.{{sfn|12WY|2021}}

The experimentation evident on ''Somewhere in Time'' continued on their next album, ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', which was released in 1988. A [[concept album]] recorded at [[Musicland Studios]] in Munich,{{sfn|Musiclands|2021}} based on the 1987 novel ''[[Seventh Son (novel)|Seventh Son]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]],{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} it was the band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith.{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} After his contributions were not used for ''Somewhere in Time'', Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.{{sfn|Wall|2004lll|p=265}} Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts,{{sfn|Wall|2004mmm|p=263}} and reached No.&nbsp;12 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'',{{sfn|Billboard}} although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.{{sfn|RIAA}} The album incorporated many progressive rock influences and brought four hit singles (Top 5 in the UK alone) such as "Can I Play with Madness", "Infinite Dreams", "The Evil That Men Do" and "The Clairvoyant", epic title track and expressive "Moonchild" or "Only the Good Die Young" inspired by [[Aleister Crowley]]'s works.{{sfn|77Album|2021}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

After the blockbuster tour in North America, Iron Maiden were headliners of [[Monsters of Rock|Monsters of Rock festivals]] in Europe for the very first time. They headlined stadiums and festivals in [[UK]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]].{{sfn|MOR1988|2021}} During the following [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour|tour]], the band headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Donington Park]] for the first time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history, with an estimated 107,000 in attendance.{{sfn|Wall|2004nnn|p=269}} Also included on the bill were [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[David Lee Roth]], [[Megadeth]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and [[Helloween]].{{sfn|UK Rock Festivals}} The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during Guns N' Roses' performance; the following year's festival was cancelled as a result.{{sfn|Wall|2004ooo|p=269}} The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC Arena]], Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled ''[[Maiden England]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004ppp|p=272}}

Soon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the "stripped down" style that they were leaning towards.{{sfn|Wall|2004ttt|p=283}} Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years.{{sfn|Wall|2004uuu|p=285}} The album, ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'', was released in October 1990.{{sfn|Prato}} It contained hit singles as "[[Holy Smoke (song)|Holy Smoke]]" and "[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter]]", the band's first (and to date, only) [[UK Singles Chart]] No.&nbsp;1, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004www|p=282}} The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90-second live clip on Top of the Pops was shown.

After another extensive tour and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', which was released in 1992.

The band presented a powerful and elaborated lighting rig (over 1000 lamps and lasers) and scenery partly reminiscent of the 1980s. The setting of the Monsters of Rock concerts was completed by the huge Eddie crowning the stage and screens. Iron Maiden made their first appearance in [[Iceland]] and returned to Oceania after a seven-year hiatus. The tour in Japan was the largest in the history of the group. The tour witnessed the personal conflicts between Bruce Dickinson and rest of the band.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|DarkEra|2021}}

In 1993, Bruce Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a [[Real Live Tour|farewell tour]] and two live albums (later re-released in [[A Real Live Dead One|one package]]).{{sfn|Wall|2004ag|p=293}} The first, ''[[A Real Live One]]'', featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993.

It happened for the very first time in band's history.{{sfn|Grammy1994|2021}} Since May 1976 Iron Maiden has played over 1400 shows for a combined audience estimated at more than 20 million fans worldwide, on five continents, a record-breaking achievement for a heavy metal band.{{sfn|Attendance1994|2021}} The band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing [[Blaze Bayley]], formerly of the band [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]], who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.{{sfn|Wall|2004aj|p=301}} Harris' preferred choice from the outset,{{sfn|Wall|2004ak|p=302}} Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor and ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(b)}}

After a three-year hiatus from studio releases – a record for the band at the time - Iron Maiden returned in 1995. Releasing their next studio album, ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]'', the band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at No.&nbsp;8),{{sfn|Wall|2004al|p=313}}. The album would go on to win ''Album of the Year'' awards in France, Spain and Germany.{{sfn|Wall|2004am|p=311}} After more than ten years of the Iron Maiden's constant domination in the readers' polls of [[Kerrang!]] magazine, band's founder Steve Harris received the prestigious ''Kerrang Kreativity Award''.{{sfn|KreativityAward|2021}} The record included the 11-minute epic "Sign of the Cross", the band's longest song since "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", as well as the singles "[[Man on the Edge]]" (based on the film ''[[Falling Down]]''),{{sfn|Paterson|2009|p=44}} and "[[Lord of the Flies (song)|Lord of the Flies]]", based on the [[Lord of the Flies|novel of the same name]].{{sfn|Popoff|2005(b)}} The release is notable for its "dark" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.{{sfn|Wall|2004an|p=311}} [[The X Factour|The band toured]] for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing for the first time in Israel and South Africa, Malta, Bulgaria, Romania in Europe and ending in the [[Americas]]. The biggest show of the whole tour was a headline appearance for 60,000 people at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in São Paulo, Brazil.{{sfn|Wall|2004ao|p=314}}

Generally Iron Maiden booked smaller venues including clubs, theatres and mid-size arenas, especially in the States. The band played in stadiums and large arenas in South America and resurged with mainstream popularity in Greece. The stage production was smaller than previous years but included many elements Iron Maiden were famous for: two Eddies, mobile lighting rig, conceptual stage set or backdrops. The tenth studio album sold in 1.3 million copies,  the lowest sales result since 1981.{{sfn|Wall|2004ap|p=315}} After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, ''[[Best of the Beast]]''. The band's first compilation, it included a new single, "[[Virus (Iron Maiden song)|Virus]]", in which the lyrics attack the critics, who had recently written off the band. Initially the musicians planned to release a video compilation but quit, due to the unsatisfying quality of available video remastering.{{sfn|Wall|2004ar|p=316}}

In 1998 Iron Maiden released ''[[Virtual XI]]'', whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date, failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in the band's history.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(a)}}{{sfn|Sverigetopplistan}} The album peaked at No.&nbsp;16 in the UK; the band's lowest for a new studio record.{{sfn|Official Charts Company|1998}} At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including ''Live at Donington'' (which was given a mainstream release for the first time). ''Virtual XI'' features the singles "[[The Angel and the Gambler]]" and "[[Futureal]]", as well as epic opus entitled "Clansman" and the power ballad "Como Estais Amigos" dedicated to all people who died in [[Falklands War]].{{sfn|Saulnier|2010}}

Prior to the album's release, the band organised a publicity tour in which they held football matches in different European countries with some guest musicians and pro-footballers from the UK and Europe.{{sfn|Paterson|2021|p=72}} Following the more "back to the basic" stage sets that they had been using following 1988's [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour]], they returned to a conception of an elaborate stage set.{{sfn|Paterson|2021|pp=75–76}} The musicians and management stated [[Virtual XI World Tour]] would bring a "massive show, with huge production, including stadium-levelling amounts of pyro". They also announced the participation of Dave Lights, who did their lighting and effects in the 1980s. Management booked more mid–size arenas and stadiums in Latin America, including a headline show at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in Buenos Aires, Argentina as the final show of the tour.{{sfn|VXI|2021}} Finally, the band used bigger backdrops, more elaborate lighting rigs, a conceptual stage set and an inflatable Eddie's head and hands which embraced both sides of the stage. Fans didn't see pyrotechnics and the kind of production comparable with ‘80s monumental stage sets as it was previously announced. The tour was a big disappointment, both to musicians and the fans.{{sfn|1998Prod|2021}}

Bayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.{{sfn|Wall|2004as|p=324}} The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the [[Virtual XI World Tour]],{{sfn|Wall|2004at|p=321}} although Janick Gers stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2010}}

===Return of Dickinson and Smith, ''Brave New World'' (1999–2002)===
{{main|Ed Hunter|Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)}}
[[File:Iron Maiden en Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Adrian Smith (left) re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, resulting in a three–guitar line-up.]]

While the group were considering a replacement for Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004au|p=328}} Although Harris admitted that he "wasn't really into it" at first, he then thought, "'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?' The thing is, we know Bruce and we know what he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.' I mean, we got on well professionally for, like, eleven years, and so&nbsp;... after I thought about it, I didn't really have a problem with it."{{sfn|Wall|2004aw|p=328}}

The band entered into talks with Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999,{{sfn|Wall|2004av|p=329}} along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later.{{sfn|Wall|2004az|p=330}} With Gers, Smith's replacement, remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three-guitar line-up (called "The Three Amigos"), and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004a1|p=331}} Dubbed [[The Ed Hunter Tour]], it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, ''[[Ed Hunter]]'', whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group's website, and also contained a computer game of the same name starring [[Eddie (mascot)|the band's mascot]].{{sfn|Adams}} The 1999 reunion tour was the biggest enterprise in terms of production since [[Fear of the Dark Tour|Fear of the Dark Tour 1992]]. The band visited North America and several European countries to present the conceptual show inspired by scenes from the game. Iron Maiden used a two-part stage related to graphics from the promoted game, three movable screens surrounded by light ramps, projectors, huge backdrops, pyrotechnics (for the first time since 1988), colourful props, visuals and two types of Eddie in the version known from the game. The equipment travelled in seven huge trucks.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

One of Dickinson's primary concerns on rejoining the group "was whether we would in fact be making a real state-of-the-art record and not just a comeback album,"{{sfn|Wall|2004a3|p=328}} which eventually took the form of 2000's ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004a4|p=341}} Having disliked the results from Harris' personal studio, Barnyard Studios located on his property in Essex,{{sfn|Berelian|2000}} which had been used for the last four Iron Maiden studio albums, the band recorded the new release at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, France in November 1999 with producer [[Kevin Shirley]].{{sfn|Wall|2004a5|p=341}} New release was promoted by two singles "[[The Wicker Man (song)|The Wicker Man]]" and "[[Out of the Silent Planet (song)|Out of the Silent Planet]]", both of them went successful in the UK singles chart.{{sfn|Wall|2004a6|pp=341–343}} Thematic influences continued with "The Wicker Man" – based on the 1973 British [[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|cult film of the same name]] – and "Brave New World" – title taken from the [[Aldous Huxley]] [[Brave New World|novel of the same name]].{{sfn|Wall|2004a7|p=342}} The album furthered the more progressive and melodic sound present in some earlier recordings, with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration.{{sfn|Wall|2004a8|p=342}} The album was a commercial and an artistic success and was considered as the band's classic release along with previous records from the '80s. ''Brave New World'' charted No. 7 in the [[UK Album Charts]] and No.&nbsp;39 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' and Top 5 in many other territories, and eventually went Gold and Platinum in a dozen of countries worldwide. The twelfth studio album has brought Iron Maiden back to the metal extra league again.{{sfn|Wall|2004axx|pp=342–344}}{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

[[Brave New World Tour|The reunion world tour]] that followed consisted of well over 100&nbsp;dates (including 31 shows of 1999 tour) and culminated on 19 January 2001 in a show at the [[Rock in Rio]] festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played to an audience of over 250,000.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004a9|1p=353|2a1=Shooman|2y=2007a10|2p=176|3a1=Sanctuary|3y=2002a11|4a1=Martins|4y=2002a12}} While the performance was being produced for a CD and a highly successful DVD release in March 2002, under the name ''[[Rock in Rio (album)|Rock in Rio]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004a13|p=357}} the band took a year off from touring, during which they played three consecutive shows at [[Brixton Academy]] in aid of former drummer [[Clive Burr]], who had recently announced that he had been diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].{{sfn|Wall|2004a14|p=361}} The band performed two further concerts for Burr's MS Trust Fund charity in 2005,{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2005c}} and 2007,{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2007c}} before his death in 2013.{{sfn|BBC News|2013}}

During the 2000–2002 tour, Iron Maiden played 91 shows for over two million people in 33 countries. The band visited big arenas, stadiums and performed at the biggest festivals.{{Sfn|NewTour|2021}} The world tour dubbed "Metal 2000 Tour" was a great undertaking, the main aim of which was to restore the concert glory of the band from the 80's. Iron Maiden used huge lighting equipment with moving parts and 600 lamps, pyrotechnics, a walking and a large wicker Eddie with dancers in the center, a burning cross lifting Bruce Dickinson up, backdrops and conceptual scenery related to the ''Brave New World'' album cover illustration.{{sfn|Metal2000Tour|2021}} In addition to their touring success, the musicians have been nominated twice for the annual US music award [[Grammy Awards]]{{sfn|Grammy2001|2021}} and received the [[Ivor Novello Awards]] for an international achievement.{{sfn|IvorNovello|2021}} Iron Maiden was hailed as the most successful British metal group on [[Channel 4 (British Television Station)|British Channel 4]], and ''The Number of the Beast'' album was included in the prestigious [[Eagle Vision (company)|Eagle Vision]]'s "Classic Albums" series.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} In 2001 band won Online Music Awards Germany in category "Best Artist Website".{{sfn|Online Music Awards|2021}}

In November 2002, Iron Maiden released their third "best of" compilation ''[[Edward the Great]]'' and a limited edition of a very special, collector's metal casket entitled ''[[Eddie's Archive]]''. The special box included three double CDs: ''[[BBC Archives (album)|BBC Archives]]'', ''[[Beast over Hammersmith]]'' and ''[[Best of the 'B' Sides]]'' with unique live recordings from Reading Festivals 1980 and 1982, Donington's Monsters of Rock Festival 1988, BBC Rock Friday 1979, songs from B-sides of particular singles and a live recording of London's Hammersmith Odeon 1982 in its entirety. As the special fan souvenirs, the box offered parchment with the band's family tree, a customised [[shot glass]] and the ring.{{sfn|Wall|2004a15|pp=364–365}}

In June 2003 Iron Maiden released double DVD promo-videos compilation entitled ''[[Visions of the Beast]]'' which went multi-platinum worldwide. The same period band started promotional tour related to the new DVD and forthcoming album.{{sfn|VOTB|2021}} The summer leg was funny named [[Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour]] and embranced 57 shows in Europe and North America. They played indoor arenas, stadiums, American amphitheaters and headlined big festivals such as Roskilde, Heineken Jammin' Festival, [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]] (combined attendance of 130.000) or the first edition of [[Download Festival]] held at [[Donington Park]] as a successor of Monsters of Rock.{{sfn|GMET|2021}} The Spanish leg of the tour spanned nine shows played in 2003 with 160,000 fans in attendance which was the biggest result in band's career. 28 shows in Europe gathered 720,000 fans and Iron Maiden visited US and Canada to play 29 shows for the hundreds of thousands of people. Fans could hear band's evergreens and the brand new song "[[Wildest Dreams (Iron Maiden song)|Wildest Dreams]]" being the first promotional single from brand new album.{{sfn|2003-04|2021}} The tour was another visual attraction, the setting referring to the most popular incarnations of Eddie with all the lighting effects and pyrotechnics. There was also a public lobotomy of the group's mascot taking place during the song "Iron Maiden".{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

Following their [[Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour]] in the summer of 2003, Iron Maiden released ''[[Dance of Death (album)|Dance of Death]]'', their thirteenth studio album, which was met by worldwide critical and commercial success. The album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK Albums Chart{{sfn|Wall|2004a16|p=368}} and No.&nbsp;18 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''.{{sfn|Billboard}} Produced by Kevin Shirley, now the band's regular producer, many critics felt that this release matched up to their earlier efforts, such as ''Killers'', ''Piece of Mind'' and ''The Number of the Beast''.{{sfn|Wall|2004a17|p=369}} As usual, historical, and literary references were present, with "Montségur" in particular being about the [[Catharism|Cathar]] stronghold conquered in 1244,{{sfn|Wall|2004a18|p=373}} and "Paschendale" relating to [[Battle of Passchendaele|the significant battle]] which took place during [[World War I|the First World War]].{{sfn|Wall|2004a19|p=375}} The album features successful singles "[[Wildest Dreams (Iron Maiden song)|Wildest Dreams]]" and "[[Rainmaker (Iron Maiden song)|Rainmaker]]", epic title track and "[[No More Lies (Iron Maiden song)|No More Lies]]" (next ban's EP) acoustic ballad "Journeyman" and first ever song composed by Nicko McBrain entitled "The New Frontier".

[[Dance of Death Tour|Dance of Death Tour 2003–04]] started in September 2003 and was the band's most theatrical tour to date. The stage portrayed medieval castle with an opening gates, [[Grim Reaper]]'s sculptures on sides, the towers and two versions of Eddie as the ominus Grim Reaper character.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}} Bruce Dickinson used many props such as the black coat, carnival masks, the throne, [[World War I]] uniform and helmet. During presentation of the "Paschendale" song fans could see the dead soldiers' mannequins, trenches and the lighting system imitated flashes of explosions that echoed through the powerful sound system. Iron Maiden played 53 shows visiting European indoor arenas, North America, Latin American stadiums and Japan.{{sfn|2003-04|2021}} Musicians took a part in charity football events called Music SoccerSix.

In 2005, the band announced the [[Eddie Rips Up the World Tour]], which, tying in with their 2004 DVD entitled ''[[The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days]]'', only featured material from their first four albums and was the first of three retrospective tours in the "History of Iron Maiden" series referring to the '80s.{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2005b}} As part of this celebration of their earlier years, "The Number of the Beast" single was re-released{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2004d}} and went straight to No.&nbsp;3 in the UK Chart.{{sfn|Official Charts Company|2005}} The tour included many headlining stadium and festival dates, including a performance at [[Ullevi Stadium]] in Sweden to an audience of almost 60,000.{{sfn|Metal Underground|2004}} This concert was also broadcast live on satellite television all over Europe to approximately 60 million viewers.{{sfn|Metal Underground|2005}} The tour was the first step to transform reborn Iron Maiden into a stadium-size band. The stage production was larger than before and referred to the visual elements known from the tours promoting the group's first four albums. The band used more backdrops, several types of Eddies, more powerful lighting rig with triangular ramps and pyrotechnics.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

Following this run of European shows, the band co-headlined the US festival tour, [[Ozzfest]], with [[Black Sabbath]]. An average festival's concerts attendance was estimated as 30,000 people.

The scene resembled a fragment of a fortification decorated with plastic, with reproductions of images of barricades, entanglements, trenches and shooting sites. Movable light ramps were covered with camouflage netting and khaki fabric, there were also paratrooper mannequins with fabric accessories. Additional lighting was also used, and at the climax, the scene turned into a huge, moving tank.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}{{sfn|AMOLADTour200607|2021}}

Only seven concerts in [[Scandinavia]] saw over 250,000 viewers gathered at such venues as [[Ullevi Stadion]], [[Olympic Stadion]] in Stockholm and Helsinki, [[Ratina Stadion]] in Finland and [[Valle Hovin]] in Oslo. According to [[Live Nation (events promoter)|Live Nation Scandinavia]], the band attracted the largest audience ever for a rock artist in this region of Europe.

Michele Stokley, organiser of [[Sarnia Bayfest]] stated, Iron Maiden "brought 22 tractor trailers and the [six] buses full of equipment for the show".{{sfn|StageEquipment|2021}}

Iron Maiden's [[mascot]], [[Eddie (mascot)|Eddie]], is a perennial fixture in the band's science fiction and horror-influenced album cover art, as well as in [[concert|live]] shows.{{sfn|Wall|2004b1|p=133}} Originally a papier-mâché mask incorporated in their backdrop which would squirt fake blood during their live shows,{{sfn|Wall|2004b2|p=62}} the name would be transferred to the character featured in the band's debut album cover, created by [[Derek Riggs]].{{sfn|Wall|2004b3|p=136}} Eddie was painted exclusively by Riggs until 1992, at which point the band began using artwork from numerous other artists as well, including [[Melvyn Grant]].{{sfn|Wall|2004b4|p=289}} Eddie is also featured in the band's [[first-person shooter]] video game, ''[[Ed Hunter]]'',{{sfn|Popoff|2005(a)}} as well as their [[Mobile operating system|mobile]] [[role-playing game]], ''Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast'',{{sfn|Lach|2016a}} in addition to numerous T-shirts, posters and other band-related merchandise.{{sfn|Wall|2004b5|p=133}} In 2008, he was awarded the "Icon Award" at the ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' Golden Gods,{{sfn|Thrash Hits|2008}} while [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson.com]] describes him as "the most recognisable metal icon in the world and one of the most versatile too".{{sfn|Lefkove|2008}} In November 2021, the group's management teamed up with [[Marvel Entertainment]], the oldest and largest producer of iconic comics in the world. The result of the collaboration was, among others, a series of gadgets containing the image of the most famous characters of Marvel and Eddie. According to the manager of Rod Smallwood, this collab was a dream come true of joining the band's mascot to the group of pop culture superheroes such as [[X-Men]], [[Avengers (comics)|Avangers]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], [[Captain America]], [[Venom (character)|Venom]], [[Thanos]], [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] or [[Deadpool]].{{Sfn|Marvel|2021}}

Over the course of several decades, the band's cover illustrations and iconography have appeared in various TV productions, music videos by artists representing popular music in the broad sense, and in press publications. The distinctive cover illustrations, especially the group's mascot and logo, have become part of celebrity clothing (especially [[t-shirts]]) worn privately, as well as at prestigious industry events, including fashion shows. Among hundreds of others can be found: [[Lady Gaga]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[Rihanna]], [[Madonna]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Taylor Hill (model)|Taylor Hill]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[David Beckham]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Diego Maradona]], [[Kelly Rowland]], [[Taryn Manning]], [[Olivia Munn]], [[Travis Scott]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Dolph Ziggler]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Holly Madison]], [[David Banks (soccer)|David Banks]], [[Jaden Smith]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Sam Worthington]], [[Taylor Momsen]], [[Kat Von D]], [[Keith Urban]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Paul Gascoigne]], [[Marc Overmars]], [[Faustino Asprilla]], [[Juicy J]], [[Kourtney Kardashian]], [[DJ Mustard]], [[Odell Beckham Jr.|Odell Beckham Jr]], [[Ann Sydney]], [[Kylie Jenner]], [[Pilar Rubio]], [[Slaven Bilic]], [[Pablo Zabaleta]], [[Anushka Sharma]], [[Terry Butcher]], [[Ian Wright]], [[Patrick Vieira]], [[Paul Mariner]], [[Stuart Pearce]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Bjorn Einar Romoren]].{{sfn|Importance of Iron Maiden|2021}}{{sfn|Iron Maiden Fashion|2021}}{{sfn|Iron Maiden Celebrities|2021}}

[[File:Iron Maiden Logo.png|thumb|left|Iron Maiden logotype and font]]
Iron Maiden's distinct logo has adorned all of the band's releases since their debut, 1979's ''[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]'' EP. The typeface originates with [[Vic Fair]]'s poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'',{{sfn|Meansheets|2010}} also used by [[Gordon Giltrap]], although Steve Harris claims that he designed it himself, using his abilities as an architectural draughtsman.{{sfn|EMI|1998}} Metal Lord / Iron Maiden, a characteristic font known from the group's classic logo, disseminated around the world by graphic works related to the band's activities, has found its way into pop culture for good, becoming a motif commonly used to create various logos and inscriptions.{{sfn|IM Logotype|2021}} The song "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]" (from [[Monty Python]]'s ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'') is a staple at their concerts, where the recording is played after the final encore.<ref name="O7iSI">{{cite news |title=Iron Maiden meets 'Monty Python' |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-meets-monty-python/ |access-date=4 September 2019 |work=Blabbermouth}}</ref>

In May 2019, the band filed a $2 million lawsuit against video game company [[3D Realms]] for infringing on their trademark via the planned release of a game called [[Ion Maiden]], which the band claims "is nearly identical to the Iron Maiden trademark in appearance, sound and overall commercial impression." The suit further accuses 3D Realms of causing "confusion among consumers" by depicting a skull icon similar to the band's Eddie mascot and that ''Ion Maiden'' is similar to the band's own ''Legacy of the Beast'' video game.<ref name="3plQv">{{cite web |last1=Beaumont-Thomas |first1=Ben |title=Iron Maiden sue video game company for $2m over Ion Maiden game |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/30/iron-maiden-sue-video-game-developers-for-2m-over-ion-maiden-game |website=The Guardian |access-date=4 June 2019 |date=30 May 2019}}</ref>

===Influence on other artists and the genre===
[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] co-founder [[Paul Stanley]] noticed Iron Maiden "have helped spawn an entire genre of music" and influenced literally thousands of other artists.{{sfn|Kiss Stanley|2021}} According to ''[[Guitar World]]'', Iron Maiden's music has "influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like [[Metallica]] to current stars like [[Avenged Sevenfold]],"{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} with Metallica drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] commenting that he has "always had an incredible amount of respect and admiration for them."{{sfn|Kerrang!|2008}} Ulrich multiple times cited Iron Maiden as probably the biggest influence on Metallica's career and the all further achievements.{{sfn|Metallica's Achievements|2021}} [[Kerry King]] of [[Slayer]] stated that "they meant so much to [him] in their early days" and [[Scott Ian]] of [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] said that "they had a major impact on [his] life."{{sfn|Young(2)}} [[Megadeth]] have cited Iron Maiden as one of their biggest inspiration on many different levels.{{sfn|Megadeth on Maiden|2021}} Members of [[Testament (band)|Testament]] have stated that Iron Maiden were one of their blueprint bands and have covered their songs many times.{{sfn|Testament on Maiden|2021}} [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] of [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] has also acknowledged Iron Maiden as one of the band's influences, and cited both them and Judas Priest as "basically the calibre of the stuff [he] listened to" in Exodus' early years.{{sfn|Exodus on Maiden|2021}} [[Kurt Cobain]], late founder, composer, vocalist and guitarist of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], was a big fan of Iron Maiden.{{sfn|Cobain|2021}} Both former and current members of [[Suicidal Tendencies]] have also mentioned Iron Maiden as one of the sources of inspiration behind their music.{{sfn|Clark|2021}}{{sfn|Lombardo|2021}}

[[Tobias Forge]], frontman and leader of Swedish rock band [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]] stated that "for me personally, they have been very influential musically, I've always listened to them a lot growing up as a metal fan. Their live album, ''[[Live After Death (album)|Live After Death]]'', had — and still has — a great impact on me when it comes to work ethic. Going through that book that came with the record, watching all those dates. When I was a kid, I would sit there with a map book and pin out all the cities they played on that tour. It was like a hundred shows all over America. The show was so over the top, so it set a standard. "[Iron] Maiden was one of the big movers when it came to '80s heavy metal merchandise. All of our merchandise has always been inspired by bands like Maiden. That's the sort of idea I had about rock and roll merchandise."{{sfn|Tobias Forge|2021}}

[[M. Shadows]] of Avenged Sevenfold stated that Iron Maiden "are by far the best live band in the world and their music is timeless", while [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] singer [[Matt Heafy]] comments that "without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist".{{sfn|Kerrang!|2008}} [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Stone Sour]] frontman [[Corey Taylor]] said that "Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I've ever seen anybody do. And Bruce Dickinson? Dude! To me, he was the quintessential old-school heavy metal singer. He could hit notes that were just sick, and he was a great showman. Everything made me a fan. And there wasn't a dude that I hung out with that wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks",{{sfn|MTV|2006(a)}} while their music also helped [[Jesper Strömblad]] of [[In Flames]] to pioneer the [[melodic death metal]] genre, stating that he had wanted to combine [[death metal]] with Iron Maiden's melodic guitar sounds.{{sfn|Metal Update|2010}} Viking metallers of Swedish band [[Amon Amarth]] stated Iron Maiden is one of their biggest influence also participated in Iron Maiden's ''Legacy of the Beast'' RPG game project.{{sfn|LOTB Game|2021}} [[Chris Impellitteri]] stated Iron Maiden have influenced "virtually every heavy metal band in existence with their music, brand, and of course talent!"{{sfn|Chris Impellitteri|2021}}

[[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] drummer [[Charlie Benante]] stated Iron Maiden "made every band that were influenced by them aspire to be like them. When I was learning to play guitar, this was one of the tunes I practiced. I developed as a guitar player and my coordination got better and better. Maiden had something different, they brought out that Primal roar from us. This was a New style of Hard Rock and Metal, they had a Punk Drive to them with Boston styled Guitar licks, they changed the game. I often said, no Maiden, no Big 4."{{sfn|Benante|2021}}

Famous pop singer [[Lady Gaga]] stated she admires what Iron Maiden have achieved in their career and aims to follow in their path. "The devotion of the fans moving in unison, pumping their fists, watching the show, when I see that, I see the paradigm for my future and the relationship I want to have with my fans. Iron Maiden‘s never had a hit song, and they tour stadiums around the world, and their fans live, breathe and die for Maiden, and that is my dream. That is my dream."{{sfn|Lady GaGa on Maiden|2021}} [[Joakim Brodén|Joakim Broden]], songwriter who is the lead vocalist, keyboardist, and occasional third guitarist of the Swedish heavy metal band [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]], stated Iron Maiden's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' "is an album that defines an entire music genre". Band's formula secret is about "taking the energy of punk and put it into heavy metal without losing any of what made metal great".{{sfn|Sabaton on Maiden|2021}}

Among the countless musicians and bands which have been introduced into metal or influenced by Iron Maiden are: [[Gene Hoglan]] of [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], Death, Testament, [[Strapping Young Lad]] and ex-[[Fear Factory]],{{sfn|Hoglan|2021}} [[Vicious Rumors]],{{sfn|Vicious|2021}} [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]],{{sfn|Anathema|2021}} [[Aaron Stainthorpe]] of [[My Dying Bride]],{{sfn|MDB|2021}} [[Bobby Ellsworth|Bobby 'Blitz' Ellsworth]] of [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]],{{sfn|Overkill|2021}} [[Karl Sanders]] of [[Nile (band)|Nile]],{{sfn|Sanders|2021}} [[Gojira (band)|Gojira]],{{sfn|Gojira|2021}} [[Moonspell]],{{sfn|Moonspell|2021}} [[HammerFall|Hammerfall]],{{sfn|Hammerfall|2021}} [[Kurdt Vanderhoof]] of [[Metal Church]],{{sfn|Vanderhoof|2021}} [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]]'s [[Jeff Waters]],{{sfn|Annihilator|2021}} [[Jørn Lande|Jorn Lande]],{{sfn|Jorn|2021}} [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]],{{sfn|Carcass|2021}} [[Stratovarius]],{{sfn|Stratovarius|2021}} [[Warlock (band)|Warlock]],{{sfn|Warlock|2021}} [[Queensrÿche|Queensryche]],{{sfn|Queensryche|2021}} [[Michael Amott]] of [[Arch Enemy]],{{sfn|Arch Enemy|2021}} [[Funeral for a Friend]],{{sfn|FFAF|2021}} [[Children of Bodom]],{{sfn|Bodom|2021}} [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]],{{sfn|RWild|2021}} [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]],{{sfn|Digger|2021}} [[Necrophobic]],{{sfn|Necrophobic|2021}} [[Chris Barnes (musician)|Chris Barnes]] of [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]] and ex-[[Cannibal Corpse]],{{sfn|Barnes|2021}} [[Wolf (band)|Wolf]],{{sfn|Wolf|2021}} [[Edguy]],{{sfn|Edguy|2021}} [[Angra (band)|Angra]],{{sfn|Angra|2021}} [[Blind Guardian]],{{sfn|Blind Guardian|2021}} [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]],{{sfn|Gamma|2021}} [[Iron Savior]],{{sfn|Iron Savior|2021}} [[Powerwolf]],{{sfn|Powerwolf|2021}} [[Marek Pająk]], guitarist of [[Vader (band)|Vader]], Nocny Kochanek,{{sfn|Polish Metal Alliance|2021}} [[Sepultura]],{{sfn|Sepultura|2021}} [[Savatage]],{{sfn|Savatage|2021}} [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]],{{sfn|D.R.I.|2021}} [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]]{{sfn|Sodom|2021}} and [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]] (whose song "[[Flotsam and Jetsam (Flotsam and Jetsam album)|Iron Maiden]]" is a tribute to the band){{sfn|Flotsam and Jetsam|2021}} among many others.

As noticed music journalist [[Geoff Barton]], the band's music constituted an important passage between the classic heavy rock school of the turn of the 1960s and 1970s, based on rhythm 'n blues, and contemporary heavy metal, characterised by sub-genre diversification and stylistic eclecticism.{{sfn|Barton|2015|p=150}} According to [[Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp]] the style and attitude of Iron Maiden drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] has inspired generations of heavy-metal drummers that followed.{{sfn|RNRFC|2021}} As stated the former editor of the German magazine ''[[Rock Hard]]'', Götz Kühnemund, Iron Maiden were (and still are) the inspiration for all the heavy metal bands we know today because they're an intrinsically heavy metal group. It is equally important for those who play power metal, speed, thrash, death, black, hard rock – almost every genre. Iron Maiden took hard rock from the '70s, took it into the' 80s, and created a new genre that didn't exist before. This band introduced a [[DIY]] approach to all rock music. They even more than all the others popularised guitar harmonies in metal. Many metal bands in existence today have two guitarists, who use double guitar harmonies, and that's where they are inspired by Iron Maiden.{{sfn|Götz Kühnemund|2019}}

According to music journalist and the writer [[Neil Daniels]] Iron Maiden "redefined the whole genre blending classic heavy rock influence with punky vibe, twin guitars attack and progressive approach which finally have created the new quality. Band's influence on generations of rock and metal bands cannot be overstated. They elevated metal to an art form, proving that academic and musical inspirations can coexist."{{sfn|Neil Daniels|2019b}} From the artist's profile published by the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] it appears that "in the 1980s, Iron Maiden released seven high-octane albums that cemented them as one of the greatest rock bands – creating a blueprint for how heavy metal bands should look, sound and tour."{{sfn|RnRHoF Note|2021}}

Downing]], confessed Iron Maiden's "music does not quite suit my taste, I cannot deny that it has had a great influence on heavy metal and music in general. As a Brit, I am terribly proud of what they have managed over the years to fill the niche they have created. Besides, I have always admired them for being able to achieve such a great commercial success for their marketing activities".{{sfn|K.K. Downing|2018|pp=138–139}}

[[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] is considered one of the most influential musicians and composers in heavy rock history. He is also the author of the lion's share of the Iron Maiden's repertoire and the creator of the archetypal composition pattern in modern metal. In addition to writing riffs, vocal melodies and lyrics for most songs, he was also involved in audio-visual production and editing. The riffs created by him are among the most unforgettable in history, as evidenced by compositions such as "[[The Trooper]]", "[[The Number of the Beast (song)|The Number of the Beast]]", "[[Phantom of the Opera (Iron Maiden song)|Phantom of the Opera]]", "[[Run to the Hills]]", "[[Fear of the Dark (song)|Fear of the Dark]]" or "[[Hallowed Be Thy Name (song)|Hallowed Be Thy Name]]". The creator of Iron Maiden has been repeatedly named the best and most influential metal bassist of all time. He is also the originator of extremely expressive, galloping bass lines. His compositional style is based on triplets consisting of sixteenths and eighth notes, creating intense rhythmic background for a double (then triple) guitar attack. Steve Harris is one of the few bass players who can play extremely fast and dense – only with his fingers! This ability has become a sensation in the context of the entire heavy metal scene. According to the [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] editors "technically it was incredibly impressive to achieve so much speed and dynamics in the sound without using a standard pick". The founder of Iron Maiden inspired masses of future musicians, including such outstanding bassists as: [[Cliff Burton]], [[Jason Newsted]], [[Frankie Bello]] and [[Robert Trujillo]].{{sfn|Harris|2021}}

===Appearance in media===
The first heavy metal videos in history broadcast by [[MTV]] were the images for the live versions of "Iron Maiden" and "Wrathchild" taken from official VHS ''[[Live at the Rainbow|Live at the Rainbow (Iron Maiden)]]''.{{sfn|MTV|2021}}{{sfn|List25|2021}} The song "Flash of the Blade" was included on the soundtrack of [[Dario Argento]]'s 1985 horror film ''[[Phenomena (film)|Phenomena]]'' (AKA "Creepers") and was covered by the American band [[Avenged Sevenfold]] on their double live album/DVD ''[[Live in the LBC & Diamonds in the Rough]]''. [[Rhapsody of Fire]] have also recorded a cover of the song that is featured on the deluxe edition of their album ''[[From Chaos to Eternity]]''. "Flash of the Blade" can also be heard in the ''[[Jem and the Holograms]]'' episode "Kimber's Rebellion", just after the cartoon band members return home from Paris, on a boom-box stereo being carried by a passerby.{{sfn|DDotB|2021}}

The band's name has been mentioned prominently in several songs, such as the singles "[[Teenage Dirtbag]]" by [[Wheatus]],{{sfn|Basham|2000}} "[[Back to the 80's (song)|Back to the 80's]]" by Danish dance-pop band [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]].{{sfn|MetroLyrics(1)}} and "[[Fat Lip]]" by [[Sum 41]].{{sfn|Sputnikmusic(1)}} Iron Maiden have also been referenced in [[Weezer]]'s "Heart Songs" (from their 2008 self-titled "[[Weezer (2008 album)|Red]]" album),{{sfn|MetroLyrics(2)}} [[Blues Traveller]]'s "Psycho Joe" (from 1997's ''[[Straight On till Morning (album)|Straight on till Morning]]''),{{sfn|MetroLyrics(3)}} and [[NOFX]]'s "Eddie, Bruce and Paul" (from their 2009 album ''[[Coaster (album)|Coaster]]''), which [[Sputnikmusic]] describes as "a humorous retelling of Paul DiAnno's departure".{{sfn|Thomas|2009}}

The number of releases and ventures in tribute to the British formation can be estimated in hundreds, moreover - the reinterpretations of the band's achievements make up an extremely wide range of stylistic variants, such as: numerous sub-genres of rock and metal, soul, pop, classics, symphonic music, alternative music, electro, techno, industrial, hip-hop, rap, reggae, ska, jazz, chorales, pastiches, piano music, early music, string music, early music or acoustic versions with a wide range of classical instruments.{{sfn|Tribute1|2021}}{{sfn|Tribute2|2021}} In 2008, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' released ''[[Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden]]'', an album composed of Iron Maiden cover songs performed by Metallica, [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Dream Theater]], Trivium, [[Coheed and Cambria]], Avenged Sevenfold, and other groups influenced by the band.{{sfn|Kerrang!|2008}} In 2010, [[Maiden uniteD]], an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of [[Ayreon]], [[Threshold (band)|Threshold]] and [[Within Temptation]], released ''[[Mind the Acoustic Pieces]]'', a re-interpretation of the entire ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' album.{{sfn|Maiden United}} As of 2021 nearly 200 Iron Maiden cover audio-visual releases exist (each featuring various artists), including piano,{{sfn|AllMusic}} electro,{{sfn|Aquarius Records}} string quartet{{sfn|Loftus}} and hip-hop tributes among many others.{{sfn|AllMusic(2)}}

Iron Maiden songs have been featured in the soundtracks of several video games, including ''[[Carmageddon 2]]'',{{sfn|Giant Bomb}} ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'',{{sfn|IGN}} ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City]]'',{{sfn|Allgame}} ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned]]'',{{sfn|Rockstar Games}} Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'',{{sfn|Polygon2021|2021}} ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4]]'',{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2002}} ''[[SSX on Tour]]''{{sfn|Cheat Code Central}} and ''[[Madden NFL 10]]''.{{sfn|Metal Insider|2009}} Their music also appears in the ''[[Guitar Hero]] ''and ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' series of [[music video game|rhythmic video games]].{{sfnm|1a1=East|1y=2009|2a1=Rock Band}} Iron Maiden songs have also appeared in films, such as ''[[Phenomena (film)|Phenomena]]'' (entitled ''Creepers'' in the US),{{sfn|BillWyman.com|2014}} and ''[[Murder by Numbers]]'';{{sfn|JoBlo.com}} while MTV's animated duo [[Beavis and Butt-Head]] have commented favourably on the band several times.{{sfnm|1a1=Wardlaw|2a1=Ling|2y=2005}}

[[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] author Bill Forster is an avowed Iron Maiden fan and made several Iron Maiden references, including song lyrics and the phrase "Up the Irons" in his books, including ''[[The Transformers: The Ark : A Complete Compendium of Transformers Animation Models|The Ark]]'' series and ''The AllSpark Almanac'' series.{{sfnm|1a1=Angelfire(1)|2a1=Angelfire(2)}} Iron Maiden music, lyrics, themes, fans and iconography have appeared in many episodes and movies including quasi-documentary comedies as ''Schemers'',{{sfn|Schemers|2020}} ''The Night of the Beast''{{sfn|The Night of the Beast|2020}} also in documentary movies such as ''[[Global Metal]]''{{sfn|Global Metal|2008}} or band's own ''[[Flight 666]]'' among many others.{{sfn|Flight 666 the movie|2009}}

[[Bruce Dickinson]] is the most active in media member of the band. Iron Maiden frontman presented ''Bruce Dickinson's Friday Rock Show'' on [[BBC]] radio station [[6 Music]] from 2002 to 2010.{{sfn|FRS|2010}} In addition to his show on 6 Music, Dickinson also hosted a series entitled ''Masters of Rock'' on [[BBC Radio 2]] from 2003 to 2007.{{sfn|MOR BBC|2007}} His singing and episode acting were presented in ''The Club Paradise'',{{sfn|Club Paradise|1990}} ''[[Mr Bean|Mr Bean's Elected]]'',{{sfn|Mr Bean|1991}} and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child]]''{{sfn|Nightmare|1989}} Dickinson's aviation passion and storytelling talent were reflected in ''[[Flying Heavy Metal|Flying Heavy Metal (Discovery Series)]]'' among many other documents.{{sfn|Flying Heavy Metal|2005}}

===Claims of Satanic references===
In 1982, the band released one of their most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as [[Satanism|Satanists]], encouraging people to destroy copies of the release.{{sfn|Young(1)}} The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes.{{sfnm|1a1=Eagle Vision|1y=2001|2a1=Young(1)}} The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2011(2)}}

Contrary to the accusations, the band have always denied the notion that they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the ''[[Live After Death]]'' concert video.{{sfn|EMI|2008}} Steve Harris has since commented that, "It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists."{{sfn|Wall|2004b6|p=228}} Harris has also stated that "[[The Number of the Beast (song)|The Number of the Beast]]" song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004b7|p=224}} and also influenced by [[Robert Burns]]' "[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]".{{sfn|Eagle Vision|2001}} Furthermore, the band's drummer, [[Nicko McBrain]], has been a born-again Christian since 1999.{{sfn|Godscare}}

===Ed Force One===
[[File:Boeing 757-23A, Astraeus AN1497690.jpg|thumb|The band's former Ed Force One, a [[Boeing 757-200]]]]

For their [[Somewhere Back in Time World Tour]] in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an [[Astraeus Airlines]] [[Boeing 757]]<!-- The first two Ed Force Ones were Boeing 757s. They upgraded to a 747 for the 2016 Book of Souls tour. --> as transport.{{sfnm|1a1=Bezer|1y=2008|2a1=Metal Storm|2y=2007}} The aeroplane was converted into a [[combi aircraft|combi]] configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, thereby allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically.{{sfn|Metal Storm|2007}} It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery,{{sfn|Metal Storm|2007}} which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers.{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2008}}

[[File:Boeing747-IronMaiden01.jpg|thumb|left|Iron Maiden's Ed Force One, a [[Boeing 747-400]], as used during The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016.]]
The aircraft, named "Ed Force One" after a competition on the band's website,{{sfn|Cashmere|2008}} was flown by Dickinson, as he was also a commercial airline pilot for Astraeus, and plays a major role in the award-winning documentary{{sfnm|1a1=Juno Awards|1y=2010|2a1=Bezer|2y=2009c}} ''[[Iron Maiden: Flight 666]]'', which was released in cinemas in 42 countries in April 2009.{{sfn|Bezer|2009a}} A different aeroplane (registered G-STRX){{sfn|EMI|2012}} was used for [[The Final Frontier World Tour]] in 2011 with altered livery, adopting the artwork of ''[[The Final Frontier]]'' album,{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2010d}} and features heavily in the 2012 documentary "[[En Vivo! (Iron Maiden album)|Behind the Beast]]". For [[The Book of Souls World Tour]] in 2016, the band upgraded to an ex-[[Air France]] [[Boeing 747-400]] jumbo jet, supplied by [[Air Atlanta Icelandic]] (registered TF-AAK){{sfnm|1a1=PlaneSpotters.net|2a1=Sands|2y=2016}} and customised by [[Volga-Dnepr Airlines|Volga-Dnepr Gulf]],{{sfn|volga-dnepr.com|2016}} which allows for more space without the aircraft having to undergo a significant conversion to carry their equipment.{{sfn|Lach|2015b}}

Steve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter,{{sfn|MusicRadar|2010}} has stated that his influences include [[Black Sabbath]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]] and [[Wishbone Ash]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blabbermouth.net|1y=2004ca|2a1=EMI|2y=2004|3a1=Wall|3y=2004zw|3p=27|4a1=Wall|4y=2004wz|4p=154}} In 2010 Harris stated, "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's ''[[Argus (album)|Argus]]'' album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it."{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} In 2004, Harris explained that the band's "heaviness" was inspired by "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in."{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2004c}} On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as "more like a rhythm guitar,"{{sfn|Popoff|2005(c)}} cited as responsible for the band's galloping style,{{sfn|Fender}} heard in such songs as "[[The Trooper]]"{{sfn|Huey(2)}} and "Run to the Hills."{{sfn|Lawson}}

The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing style. Dave Murray is known for his [[legato]] technique which, he claims, "evolved naturally. I'd heard [[Jimi Hendrix]] using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing."{{sfn|McIver|2010(a)}} Stating that he "was inspired by [[blues rock]] rather than metal," Adrian Smith was influenced by [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Pat Travers]], leading to him becoming a "melodic player."{{sfn|McIver|2010(c)}} Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by [[Ritchie Blackmore]],{{sfn|Wall|2004b8|p=277}} which he claims is in contrast to Smith's "rhythmic" sound.{{sfn|McIver|2010(b)}}

Singer Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith,{{sfn|Wall|2004b14|p=244}} has an operatic vocal style, inspired by [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Peter Hammill]], [[Ian Anderson]] and [[Ian Gillan]],{{sfn|Dmme.net}} and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.{{sfnm|1a1=Rosen|1y=2011|2a1=HearYa.com|2y=2006|3a1=Blabbermouth.net|3y=2009a|4a1=Blabbermouth.net|4y=2009b}} Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the ''Dance of Death'' album,{{sfn|Ling|2005b}} Harris often relies on him while developing songs. Adrian Smith commented, "Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns."{{sfn|Wall|2004b9|p=241}}

Throughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, in spite of the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's ''Somewhere in Time'',{{sfn|Prato}} keyboards on 1988's ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'',{{sfn|Wall|2004b10|p=265}} and an attempt to return to the "stripped down" production of their earlier material on {{notatypo|1990's}} ''No Prayer for the Dying''.{{sfn|Wall|2004b11|p=283}} In recent years, however, the band have begun using more [[progressive rock|progressive]] elements in their songs,{{sfnm|1a1=Dome|1y=2006a|2a1=Dome|2y=2006b}} which Steve Harris describes as not progressive "in the modern sense, but like [[Dream Theater]], more in a 70s way".{{sfn|Dome|2006b}} According to Harris, ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'' was the band's first album which was "more progressive",{{sfn|Wall|2004b12|p=264}} while they would only return to this style from 1995's ''The X Factor'', which he states is "like an extension of ''Seventh Son''..., in the sense of the progressive element to it".{{sfn|Wall|2004b13|p=311}} The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material,{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} which [[AllMusic]] states was "clearly drawing from elements of punk rock",{{sfn|Huey(1)}} although Harris firmly denies this.{{sfn|VH1|2011}}
