===''The Devil's Carnival'' (2012-15)===
{{Main|The Devil's Carnival|Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival}}
In 2012 Zdunich and Bousman, along with composer Saar Hendelman, released [[The Devil's Carnival]], a 56-minute independent film designed to challenge conventional distribution models.<ref>http://www.laweekly.com/publicspectacle/2012/08/17/how-the-creators-of-the-devils-carnival-said-screw-you-to-hollywood-and-gained-a-cult-following</ref> The film featuring stars from film and television, like [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] and [[Dayton Callie]], as well as rock stars [[Emilie Autumn]] and [[Ivan Moody (vocalist)|Ivan Moody]].<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2204379/</ref> During the initial release The Devil’s Carnival was only shown at exclusive one night engagements in 60 cities across the U.S. and Canada.<ref>http://renegadecinema.com/1282/terrance-zdunich-interview</ref> The road tour broke with the normal film viewing experience by including meet and greets with the cast, Q&As, costume contests, live sideshow acts and behind the scenes footage.<ref>http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/the-devils-carnival-prepares-for-its-road-tour-with-this-new-trailer</ref>

Due to the success of the first film and road tour Zdunich reprised his role as Lucifer in 2015 ''[[Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival]]''.<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/watch-trailer-devils-carnival-alleluia-746774</ref> Along with returning talent, Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival featured [[Adam Pascal]], [[Barry Bostwick]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Tech N9ne]] and [[Ted Neely]].<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3892618/?ref_=nv_sr_2</ref>

A tour followed the second film, though suffered from legal issues and what Zdunich described as "illogical tour routing, poor ground management and worse communication". The issues led to two shows being cancelled. Zdunich revealed in a 2016 blog post that ''Alleluia!'' might be the end of the project, citing legal and financial difficulties. He added: "It may be. But I hope not."<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190709084806/http://www.terrancezdunich.com/control/confessions-from-the-devil</ref>

===''American Murder Song'' (2016- present)===
{{main|American Murder Song}}

On the ''Alleluia!'' road tour, Zdunich announced a new musical collaboration with composer Saar Hendelman called [[American Murder Song]], a collection of original [[murder ballad|murder ballads]] set in different time periods of American history.<ref>http://loudwire.com/alleluia-the-devils-carnival-road-show-invades-los-angeles</ref>

American Murder Song's debut [[ballads]] are set in 1816 during the [[Year Without A Summer]], when severe climate abnormalities lowered global temperatures and devastated American farmlands.<ref>http://bravewords.com/news/cradle-of-filth-backing-vocalist-lindsay-schoolcraft-joins-cast-of-american-murder-song-trailer-available</ref> The Year Without A Summer was released as 4 extended play albums, multiple online videos and a tour.<ref>http://horrornews.net/110751/american-murder-song-summons-sans-dress-american-wake</ref> The videos introduced characters from the songs, including "Pretty Lavinia," about America's first purported female [[serial killer]], [[Lavinia Fisher]].<ref>http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/arch-enemys-alissa-white-gluz-plays-americas-first-female-serial-killer-for-american-murder-song</ref> The videos featured performances by cult music stars like [[Arch Enemy]]’s [[Alissa White-Gluz]] as Pretty Lavinia, [[Aurelio Voltaire]] as lothario wife-killer Unwed Henry, and Chibi, front woman of [[The Birthday Massacre]], as Sweet Rosalie, an "escaped mental patient who leaves a trail of dead in her wake."<ref>http://www.sinfulcelluloid.com/2016/06/american-murder-song-releases-new-video-six-mile-inn</ref>

The duo began what would become a series of tours across the United States in 2016, continuing intermittently until slowed by the arrival of the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020.<ref>https://americanmurdersong.com/tours/</ref>

In 2017, Hendelman and Zdunich announced that the theme for their second year of murder ballads with American Murder Song would be the [[Donner Party]], the infamous [[American pioneers]] who got stuck in the snowy Sierra Nevada Mountains and resorted to [[cannibalism]].<ref>https://www.facebook.com/thekillingplace/videos/1878322029081361</ref> They produced a The Donner Party album, a series of [[The Twilight Zone]]-styled videos,<ref>https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/251489/watch-first-episode-american-murder-song-presents-black-wagon</ref> and a second tour.<ref>http://www.patchchordnews.com/review-american-murder-song-vinyl-music-hall-pensacola-fl-2017-10-09</ref>

Zdunich and Hendelman are currently writing and recording music for the next phase of American Murder Song,<ref>http://www.terrancezdunich.com/control/a-day-in-the-life</ref> focusing on the crimes of [[H. H. Holmes]] at the [[World’s Columbian Exposition|1893 world’s fair]].

Zdunich regularly attests to his love of the macabre and produces work normally dubbed "horror."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/comics/464 |title=Bloody Disgusting talks Molting |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting.com |date=March 25, 2010 |access-date=January 6, 2012}}</ref> From his earliest pieces, such as the illustrated God & the Box (seen on his website), his work has always prominently featured bugs, especially cockroaches.
