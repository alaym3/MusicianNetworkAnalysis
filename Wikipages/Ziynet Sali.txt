'''Ziynet Sali Safter''' (born 29 April 1975) is a Turkish-Cypriot singer who also holds British citizenship. Her later works contain pop elements while her earlier works also had [[rebetiko]] and [[classical Turkish music]] themes.

Sali was born in [[Nicosia]] and then moved to England with her family. She returned to [[Cyprus]] in 1981 and completed her education until high school degree in there. In 1994, she moved to [[Istanbul]] to study and in 1999, she graduated from the [[ITU Turkish Music State Conservatory]]. She started to perform as a professional vocalist while studying. Sali made her debut in 2000 with her first studio album released by Dost Music, ''Ba-Ba'', that contains only [[Turkish language|Turkish]] songs. ''Amman Kuzum'', her second studio album which was released by Zorba Müzik in 2004 contained [[Greek language|Greek]] songs too. ''Chiculata+1 (Amman Kuzum)'', a new edition of ''Amman Kuzum'' that also includes "Chiculata" was released by the same record label in 2005, and the next year, her third studio album ''Mor Yıllar'' was released by Ozan Video.

After release of her third studio album ''Herkes Evine'' by DMC in 2008, ''Bizde Böyle + Herkes Evine'', a new version of the same album that also included "Bizde Böyle" was released by DMC. In 2010, her first non-album single "Rüya" was her first song that reached to the first place in Turkish music charts. She continued to work with DMC, and released "Bize Yeter" (2010) and ''Collection'', her first compilation album. In 2012, GNL Entertainment released respectively her fifth studio album ''Sonsuz Ol'' and ''Sonsuz Ol + Remixes'', an album that contains ''Sonsuz Ol'' and [[remix]] versions of some of her former songs. The next year, GNL Entertainment released Sali's first live album ''Bir Akdeniz Rüyası''. Non-album single "Gelemiyorum Yanına" (2013) was her last work with GNL Entertainment before working with DMC again. In 2014, "Bugün Adım Leyla" and her second live album ''Bugün Adım Leyla'' were released respectively. After releasing of her sixth and the latest studio album ''No 6'' in 2015, Sali continued her works by releasing four non-album singles, "Ağlar mıyım? Ağlamam" (2017), "Magic" (2017), "Deli Divanenim" (2018), and "Hadi Hoppalara" (2018). "Magic" was her first English song.
