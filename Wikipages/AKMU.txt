On 13 September, YG Entertainment confirmed Chan-hyuk would enlist for his mandatory military enlistment on 18 September with the Korean Marines, thus halting all Akdong Musician activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://osen.mt.co.kr/article/G1110730534|title=악동뮤지션 이찬혁, 9월 18일 해병대 軍입대 확정|date=13 September 2017}}</ref> Meanwhile, Su-hyun occupied her time with solo activities as a radio DJ at [[KBS Cool FM]]'s ''[[Volume Up (radio show)|Volume Up]]'', permanent cast member on JTBC's [[Begin Again (TV series)|''Begin Again'']], soundtrack release for [[tvN]] drama [[Mr. Sunshine (2018 TV series)|''Mr. Sunshine'']] and more.
