== History ==
Friends and rappers [[The Quiett]] and [[Dok2]] formed Illionaire Records on January 1, 2011. They signed rapper [[Beenzino]] later that year. The Quiett later said in an interview with ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' that he wanted to start a small label to avoid the traditional k-pop major label system. "On major labels, the money made by the artists is first given to the company to pay the bosses, managers, and staff members. In our case, we’re the bosses," he said. The label has only one employee and none of the three rappers are bound by contracts.<ref name=":0" />

The label experienced a surge of popularity in its first few years due to [[Dok2]]'s many collaborations with Korean-American singer and rapper [[Jay Park]].<ref name=":1"/>

Illionaire Records toured Korea in the summer of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=ILLIONAIRE RECORDS, 'They Love Who?

Dok2 and The Quiett represented Illionaire Records on the third season of the TV rap competition show [[Show Me the Money 3|Show Me The Money]], where they were the producers of winning contestant [[Bobby (rapper)|Bobby]] of [[IKON (South Korean band)|IKON]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rappers Dok And The Quiett Confirmed As 'Show Me The Money 5' Producer-Judges|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/269430/20160222/show-me-the-money-dok2-the-quiett.htm|access-date=2016-03-24}}</ref> They, being famous only under-ground, became famous to people after they appeared in the Show Me the Money. Showing the genius recording ability, Illionare Records became even more spotlighted.

On 6 February 2020, Illionaire Records announced via Instagram, founding member Dok2 and the label mutually agreed to terminate his contract.<ref>{{cite web |title=일리네어레코즈와 Dok2는 2020년 2월 6일 부로 각자의 길을 가기로 결정했습니다. ... |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B8ORYOLg4S3/?taken-by=1llionaire_records |website=Instagram |publisher=1llionaire_records |access-date=21 October 2020}}</ref> No official reason was given for the departure.

Illionaire Records announced on 6 July 2020 that they will close their record label via their official Instagram<ref>{{Cite web|title=1LLIONAIRE RECORDS OFFICIAL (@1llionaire_records) • Instagram photos and videos|url=https://www.instagram.com/1llionaire_records/|access-date=2020-07-06|website=instagram.com|language=en}}</ref> and Twitter<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/1llionaire|url=https://twitter.com/1llionaire|access-date=2020-07-06|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> account. They stated they will continue to support their artists in their future endeavours. No other reason was provided for their sudden departure.

== Subsidiary Projects ==
[[Dok2]] and [[The Quiett]] formed a new label under Illionaire in September 2016. After announcing [[Ambition Musik]], they introduced three rappers, Kim Hyo-eun, [[Changmo]], [[Hash Swan]], and later, [[Ash Island (rapper)|Ash Island]] and Leellamarz through the official Ambition Musik Instagram account. For the first time, Dok2 and The Quiett didn't think to scout Changmo, Ash Island, and Hash Swan, so fans guessed that it would be Superbee and myunDo or [[Microdot (rapper)|Microdot]], but it wasn't true. After establishing Ambition Musik, new members joined through Ambition Musik, not Illionaire.

== Influence on Korean Hip-Hop ==
Before Illionaire Records came out, showing off money to people was not ethically right in Korean culture. People used to think that rappers were always having trouble with earning money, and it was actually true as the first generation of Hip-Hop artists had trouble with earning money. However, [[Dok2]] didn't care what other people say or think about him, so he showed him making tons of money with his rap music. Hip-hop used to be a music genre that not many people liked, but Illionaire Records has helped to lead the Hip-Hop culture to the mainstream from the underground.

==Background of Korean Hip-hop culture==
Towards the end of the Korean War, Korean people became more acceptable westernized culture.<ref name=":8">{{cite web|url=http://scalar.usc.edu/works/breakdancers-vocaloids-and-gamers-east-asian-youth-cultures-spring-2015/regurgitation-of-appropriated-western-music-in-south-korea.htm|title=East Asian Youth Cultures Spring 2015|last=Dixon|first=Dwayne|access-date=2018-02-26}}</ref> Especially, the biggest change was accepting Hip-hop culture. Since Korea had really conservative beliefs, it was hard to mingle with a culture that expresses freedom and criticizes society, like Hip-hop does. However, as people's thought has been changed, Hip-hop gained a lot of popularity. Dok2 is one of the pioneers of Hip-hop in Korea.
