===Early lives===
Craig Reid and Charles Reid were born in [[Leith]] on 5 March 1962 and grew up in [[Edinburgh]], [[Cornwall]] and [[Auchtermuchty]]. When they lived in Auchtermuchty, they attended [[Bell Baxter High School]].

=== Pre-Proclaimers (1970s–1982) ===

=== Formation and ''This Is the Story'' (1983–1987) ===
Becoming aware of the potential of playing as a duo, the Reids established the Proclaimers as an [[Acoustic rock|acoustic]] duo in 1983.<ref name="beginning" /> In allusion to their early sound, actor [[Peter Mullan]] said that the Proclaimers played "a mix of [[post-punk]] and [[Folk music|folk]]".<ref name="shortlist">{{cite web |last1=Pine |first1=Holly |title=Peter Mullan |url=https://www.shortlist.com/news/peter-mullan |website=Shortlist |date=16 September 2013 |access-date=10 March 2020}}</ref> During this time, the duo attracted a regional fan-base, with [[Inverness]] having an especially dedicated community of supporters.<ref name="allmusic" /> Many of the duo's songs, such as "Letter from America" which was written in 1984 and reflected [[unemployment]] rates of the day,<ref name="bbc30">{{cite news |last1=Brocklehurst |first1=Steven |title=This is the story of 30 Years of the Proclaimers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-40261550 |access-date=10 March 2020 |work=BBC News |date=18 June 2017}}</ref> were conceived in this period.<ref name="bbc30" />

The Proclaimers recorded a [[demo album]] with the assistance of [[Kevin Rowland]] of [[Dexys Midnight Runners]].<ref name="bbc30" />{{when|reason=date unspecified in the source|date=March 2020}} The demo fell into the hands of English [[indie pop]] band [[the Housemartins]],<ref name="bbc30" /> who invited the Proclaimers to support them on their 1986 tour.<ref name="allmusic" /><ref name="bbc30" /> First opening at the [[O2 Academy Birmingham|Hummingbird]] in [[Birmingham]],<ref name="bbc30" /> the tour afforded the duo the opportunity to perform on Channel 4 pop programme ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' in January 1987,<ref name="Logan2007">{{cite news | date=8 February 2007 | url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2008246,00.html | title=Pop idols | work=The Guardian | access-date=8 February 2007 | last=Logan | first=Brian }}</ref> and [[Chrysalis Records]] quickly signed the pair.<ref name="allmusic" />

In 1987, the duo's [[John Owen Williams (record producer)|John Williams]]-produced debut record ''[[This Is the Story]]'' was released through Chrysalis,<ref name="allmusic" /><ref name="bbc30" /> and displayed a [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] sound lauded by Timothy Monger as "sparse but spirited".<ref name="allmusic" /> For release as a single, the album-track "Letter from America" was remixed by [[Gerry Rafferty]],<ref name="bbc30" /><ref name="allmusic" /> embellishing the song with a full-band sound.<ref name="bbc30" /><ref name="allmusic" /> The single peaked at No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name=occ>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24561/proclaimers/|title=Official Charts > Proclaimers|publisher=The Official UK Charts Company|access-date=21 March 2016}}</ref><ref name="allmusic" /> as the duo appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for the first time on 12 December 1987,<ref name="bbctotp">{{cite web |title=BBC One - Top of the Pops, 03/12/1987 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00059dc |website=BBC |access-date=12 March 2020}}</ref> while the album ''[[This Is the Story]]'' went [[music recording sales certification|gold]].<ref name=bpi>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/d7Z7icd.jpg|title=BPI > Certified Awards > Search results for 'Proclaimers' (from bpi.co.uk)|publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]]|access-date=21 March 2016}}</ref> On their 1987 breakthrough, Neil McCormick of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' opined that the pair "stuck out like a pair of sore thumbs" amidst the "ersatz glamour of [[1980s music|Eighties pop]]".<ref name="Telegraph01" />
