The '''Carter Family''' is a traditional [[American folk music]] group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[Southern Gospel]], [[popular music|pop]] and [[rock music]]ians as well as on the [[Folk & blues revival|U.S. folk revival]] of the 1960s.

They were the first vocal group to become country music stars, and were among the first groups to record commercially produced country music. Their first recordings were made in [[Bristol, Tennessee]], under producer [[Ralph Peer]] on August 1, 1927, the day before country singer [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] also made his initial recordings under Peer. Their recordings of songs such as "[[Wabash Cannonball]]", "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|Can the Circle Be Unbroken]]", "[[Wildwood Flower]]", "[[Keep On the Sunny Side]]" and "[[I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes]]" made these songs country standards. The tune of the last was used for [[Roy Acuff]]'s "[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|The Great Speckled Bird]]", [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]]'s "[[The Wild Side of Life]]" and [[Kitty Wells]]' "[[It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels]]", making the song a hit all over again in other incarnations.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Definitive Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock |last=Heatley |first=Michael |year=2007 |publisher=Star Fire |location=London, UK |isbn=978-1-84451-996-5 }}</ref>

The original group consisted of  [[Sara Carter]], her husband [[A.P. Carter]], and her sister-in-law [[Maybelle Carter]]. Maybelle was married to A.P.'s brother [[Ezra Carter]] (Eck) and was also Sara's first cousin. All three were born and raised in [[southwest Virginia]], where they were immersed in the tight harmonies of mountain [[gospel music]] and [[shape note]] singing.

Throughout the group's career, Sara Carter sang lead vocals and played rhythm guitar or [[autoharp]], and  Maybelle sang harmony and played lead guitar. On some songs A.P. did not perform at all; on some songs he sang harmony and background vocals and occasionally he sang lead. Maybelle's distinctive guitar-playing style became a hallmark of the group, and her [[Carter Family picking|Carter Scratch]] (a method for playing both lead and rhythm on the guitar) has become one of the most copied styles of guitar playing. The group (in all its incarnations, see below) recorded for a number of companies, including RCA Victor, ARC group, Columbia, Okeh and various imprint labels.<ref>Zwonitzer, M. & Hirshberg, C.

==History==
[[File:Birthplace log cabin of A.P. Carter at the Carter Fold at Maces Springs, Virginia now Hiltons, Virginia.jpg|thumb|Birthplace log cabin of A.P. Carter at the Carter Fold at Maces Springs, Virginia now Hiltons, Virginia]]

The Carter Family made their first recordings on August 1, 1927.<ref name="Carter_Clifton">{{cite AV media | people = Maybelle Carter, Bill Clifton | title = Wildwood Pickin' | at = "1: Introduction: Bill Clifton" | medium = audio CD | publisher = Vanguard Records | asin = B000000EHH}}</ref> The previous day, [[A.P. Carter]] had persuaded his wife [[Sara Carter]] and his sister-in-law [[Maybelle Carter]] to make the journey from [[Maces Spring, Virginia]], to [[Bristol, Tennessee]], to audition for record producer [[Ralph Peer]]. Peer was seeking new talent for the relatively embryonic recording industry. The initial sessions are part of what are now called the [[Bristol Sessions]]. The band received $50 for each song recorded, plus a half-cent royalty on every copy sold of each song for which they had registered a copyright. On November 4, 1927, the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] (later [[RCA Victor]]) released a double-sided [[78 rpm]] record of the group performing "Wandering Boy" and "Poor Orphan Child".  On December 2, 1928, Victor released "The Storms Are on the Ocean" / "[[Single Girl, Married Girl]]", which became very popular.

By the end of 1930, they had sold 300,000 records in the United States. Realizing that he would benefit financially with each new song he collected and [[copyright]]ed, A.P. traveled around the southwestern Virginia area in search of new songs; he also composed new songs. In the early 1930s, he befriended [[Lesley Riddle|Lesley "Esley" Riddle]], a black guitar player from [[Kingsport, Tennessee]]. Lesley accompanied A.P. on his song-collecting trips. In June 1931, the Carters did a recording session in [[Benton, Kentucky]], along with [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. In 1933, Maybelle met the [[Speer Family]] at a fair in [[Ceredo, West Virginia]], fell in love with their signature sound, and asked them to tour with the Carter Family.

==Second generation==

In the winter of 1938–39, the Carter Family traveled to [[Texas]], where they had a twice-daily program on the [[Border blaster|border radio]] station [[XERA-AM|XERA]] (later [[XERF-AM|XERF]]) in Villa Acuña (now [[Ciudad Acuña|Ciudad Acuña, Mexico]]), across the border from [[Del Rio, Texas]]. In the 1939–40 season the children of A.P. and Sara ([[Janette Carter]], [[Joseph Dougherty Carter|Joe Carter]]) and those of Maybelle ([[Helen Carter]], [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]], [[Anita Carter]]) joined the group for radio performances, now in [[San Antonio, Texas]], where the programs were prerecorded and distributed to multiple border radio stations. (The children did not, however, perform on the group's records.) In the fall of 1942, the Carters moved their program to [[WBT (AM)|WBT]] radio in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], for a one-year contract. They occupied the sunrise slot, with the program airing between 5:15 and 6:15&nbsp;a.m.

By 1936, A.P. and Sara's marriage had dissolved. Sara married A.P.'s cousin, Coy Bayes, and moved to [[California]], and the group disbanded in 1944.

Maybelle continued to perform with her daughters [[Anita Carter]], [[June Carter]], and [[Helen Carter]] and recorded on 3 labels (RCA Victor, Columbia and Coronet) as  "[[The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle]]" (sometimes billed as "The Carter Sisters" or "Maybelle Carter and the Carter Sisters" or "Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters"). In 1943, Maybelle Carter and her daughters, using the name "the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle" had a program on [[WRNL]] in Richmond, Virginia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolfe|first1=Charles K.|title=Classic Country: Legends of Country Music|date=2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780415928267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwaUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT50 |access-date=16 January 2015}}</ref> Maybelle's brother, Hugh Jack (Doc) Addington Jr., and Carl McConnell, known as the Original Virginia Boys, also played music and sang on the radio show.

[[Chet Atkins]] joined them playing electric guitar in 1949 at WNOX radio in Knoxville, Tennessee and then moved with them in Oct. of 1949 to KWTO radio in Springfield, Missouri. Opry management didn't want the Carters to bring Chet with them when they were offered a regular spot on the Grand Ole Opry but Ezra (their father and manager) insisted that Chet come with them as he was a part of their troupe or band now. Finally the Opry management agreed and Chet went with them when they were hired by WSM and the Grand Ole Opry with their first day being May 29, 1950. Chester worked with them when they did "personals" off and on for 8 years but mostly on the live Grand Ole Opry performances.<ref>name="Atkins_Neely

A.P., Sara, and their children Joe and Janette recorded 3 albums in the 1950s under the name of The A.P. Carter Family. Mother Maybelle Carter and the Carter Sisters began using the name "the Carter Family" after the death of A.P. Carter in 1960 for their act during the 1960s and 1970s. Maybelle and Sara briefly reunited, recorded a reunion album (An Historic Reunion), and toured in the 1960s during the height of [[folk music]]'s popularity.<ref name="YT_Sara&Maybelle_video">

A documentary about the family, ''[[Sunny Side of Life]]'', was released in 1985.

In 1987, reunited sisters June Carter Cash and Helen and Anita Carter, along with June's daughter [[Carlene Carter]], appeared as the Carter Family and were featured on a 1987 television episode of ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' along with [[Johnny Cash]].<ref name="AustinCityLimits">

Revivalist folksingers during the 1960s performed much of the material the Carters had collected or written.  For example, on her early [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] albums, folk performer [[Joan Baez]] sang "Wildwood Flower", "Little Moses", "Engine 143", "Little Darling, Pal of Mine", and "Gospel Ship". The Carter Family song "Wayworn Traveller" was covered by a young [[Bob Dylan]], who wrote his own words to the melody and named it "[[Paths of Victory]]"; this recording is featured on ''[[Bootleg Series Vol. 1–3]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://secondhandsongs.com/work/42027/all|title=Song: The Wayworn Traveller written by A.P. Carter |website=Secondhandsongs.com|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> After writing that song, he wrote new words to the melody and changed the time signature to 3/4, thus creating one of his most famous songs, "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/14/arts/music/bob-dylan-influences-playlist-spotify.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/14/arts/music/bob-dylan-influences-playlist-spotify.html|title=Listen to Bob Dylan's Many Influences|first=Guilbert|last=Gates|date=October 15, 2016|website=Nytimes.com|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref>

== Third generation ==
The Carter Family name has been revived for a third time, under the name '''Carter Family III'''. A project of descendants of the original Carter Family, [[John Carter Cash]], grandson of Maybelle Carter, and Dale Jett, grandson of A.P. and Sara Carter, along with John's then-wife [[Laura Weber White|Laura (Weber) Cash]]. They released their first album, ''Past & Present'', in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Past & Present|url=https://johncartercash.bandcamp.com/album/past-present|website=Johncartercash.bandcamp.com|access-date=12 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430174039/http://johncartercash.bandcamp.com/album/past-present#|archive-date=2016-04-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Rosie Nix Adams]], daughter of June Carter Cash, was also a semi-regular performing member of the Carter Family.

The Carter Family was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news|last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

==Legacy and musical style==
As important to country music as the family's repertoire of songs was Maybelle's [[guitar]] playing. She developed her innovative guitar technique largely in isolation; her style is today widely known as the "Carter scratch" or "[[Carter Family picking]]". While Maybelle did use a flatpick on occasion, her major method of guitar playing was the use of her thumb (with a thumbpick) along with one or two fingers. What her guitar style accomplished was to allow her to play melody lines (on the low strings of the guitar) while still maintaining rhythm using her fingers, brushing across the higher strings.

Before the Carter family's recordings, the guitar was rarely used as a lead or solo instrument among white musicians.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Maybelle's interweaving of a melodic line on the bass strings with intermittent strums is now a staple of steel string guitar technique. Flatpickers such as [[Doc Watson]], [[Clarence White]] and [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]] took flatpicking to a higher technical level, but all acknowledge Maybelle's playing as their inspiration.

{{quote|It has been noted that 'by the end of the twenties, Maybelle Carter scratch ... was the most widely imitated guitar style in music. Nobody did as much to popularize the guitar, because from the beginning, her playing was distinctive as any voice.'|quoted in ''The Bristol Sessions: Writings About the Big Bang of Country Music'' (2005)<ref name="Wolfe_Olson">

In 1988, the Carter Family was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] and received its [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients A-D|Award]] for the song "Will the Circle Be Unbroken". In 1993, the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative [[List of people on stamps of the United States|postage stamp honoring A.P., Sara, and Maybelle]]. In 2001, the group was inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]]. In 2005, the group received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

Renewed attention to the Carter Family tune "When I'm Gone" occurred after several covers performed a cappella with a cup used to provide percussion, as in [[the cup game]] and dubbed "[[Cups (song)|Cups or The Cup Song]]", went viral and culminated with a short performance in the movie ''[[Pitch Perfect]]''. Afterwards it was released as a single by [[Anna Kendrick]].
