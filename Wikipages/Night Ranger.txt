'''Night Ranger''' is an American [[hard rock]] band from [[San Francisco]] formed in 1979 that gained popularity during the 1980s with a series of albums and singles.<ref name="sony">{{cite web |url=http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/NightRanger/biograph.html |title=Sony Music Biography |publisher=Sonymusic.com |date=March 26, 1997 |access-date=September 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704123758/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/NightRanger/biograph.html |archive-date=July 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The band's first five albums sold more than 10 million copies worldwide<ref name="sony" /> and have sold 17 million albums total. The quintet is perhaps best known for the [[power ballad]] "[[Sister Christian]]," which peaked at number five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in June 1984, along with several other top 40 hit singles in the 1980s, including "[[Don't Tell Me You Love Me]]," "[[When You Close Your Eyes]]," "Sentimental Street," "Four in the Morning (I Can't Take Any More)," and "[[Goodbye (Night Ranger song)|Goodbye]]."<ref>[https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Night-Rangers-revisit-Sister-Christian-and-San-2595773.php sfgate.com]</ref>

After their success waned in the late 1980s, the band split up in 1989, and its members pursued other musical endeavors, including [[Supergroup (music)|group]] and [[solo (music)|solo]] efforts.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nightranger.com/about/brad_Bio.aspx| title=Brad Gillis| work=Official Community of Night Ranger| access-date=May 21, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509194316/http://www.nightranger.com/about/brad_Bio.aspx| archive-date=May 9, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=kelly>{{cite web| url=http://www.nightranger.com/about/kelly_Bio.aspx| title=Kelly Keagy| work=Official Community of Night Ranger| access-date=May 21, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512145930/http://www.nightranger.com/about/kelly_Bio.aspx| archive-date=May 12, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=jack>{{cite web| url=http://www.nightranger.com/about/jack_Bio.aspx| title=Jack Blades| work=Official Community of Night Ranger| access-date=May 21, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509065543/http://www.nightranger.com/about/jack_Bio.aspx| archive-date=May 9, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Brad Gillis and Kelly Keagy teamed up with bassist Gary Moon, and released an album without the other original band members in 1995, but the band soon reunited to release two new albums in the latter half of the decade.

== History ==
{{Review|section|date=March 2009}}

=== Beginnings ===
The group's origin can be traced to [[Rubicon (US band)|Rubicon]], a pop/funk group led by [[Jerry Martini]], who gained fame as a member of [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. After Rubicon's demise in 1979, bassist [[Jack Blades]] formed a trio<ref name=jack/> with two other Rubicon members, drummer [[Kelly Keagy]] and guitarist [[Brad Gillis]]. Performing under the name Stereo, the threesome added keyboardist [[Alan Fitzgerald]], a former member of [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]], in 1980. Fitzgerald soon recommended enlisting a second virtuoso guitarist, so [[Jeff Watson (guitarist)|Jeff Watson]], who led his own band in [[Northern California]], was added to the group. As Stereo, the band played small clubs in San Francisco in 1980, such as the Palms in the Tenderloin.<ref>{{cite web|author=squintyt4e|title=Night Ranger Aug 21, 2013: 6 - Eddie's Coming Out Tonight - Dutchess County Fair, Rhinebeck, NY|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WQq2nRBr3g|website=Youtube|access-date=February 12, 2017}}</ref>  By late that year, the band name was changed to "Ranger" and were opening for acts such as [[Sammy Hagar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/search?query=artist:%28Night+Ranger%29+tour:%28Taking+it+to+the+People+%28Sammy+Hagar%29%29|website=setlist.fm|access-date=February 12, 2017|title=Search results}}</ref>

=== 1980s ===
In 1982 the band changed its name to Night Ranger after a country band, the Rangers, claimed a trademark infringement.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Metzer, Greg, 1960-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/905349930|title=Rock band name origins : the stories of 240 groups and performers|date=March 20, 2015|isbn=978-0-7864-5531-7|location=Jefferson, N.C.|oclc=905349930|page=132}}</ref> By this point, they had recorded ''[[Dawn Patrol (album)|Dawn Patrol]]'' for [[Boardwalk Records]] and done opening stints for [[ZZ Top]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]; the latter had employed Brad Gillis as a replacement guitarist for the recently deceased [[Randy Rhoads]], in the spring and summer of 1982. After Boardwalk folded, producer Bruce Bird secured Night Ranger a deal with [[MCA Records|MCA]] on their Camel subsidiary in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1992-11-05|title=Bruce Bird; Marketer, Promoter in Record Industry|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-11-05-mn-1372-story.html|access-date=2020-08-17|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

''[[Rolling Stone]]'s ''review of ''7 Wishes'' took a swipe at Night Ranger's "formula" of "sub-Broadway" ballads.  Other critics were even less flattering, with terms such as "poseurs" and "pomp-rockers" put forth in various music guides, but favorable critics, such as ''[[Hit Parader]]'', underscored Jack Blades' puppy-dog appeal, which won over female fans, while Gillis and Watson's dueling guitars pleased the same male audience that guitar-driven bands such as [[Van Halen]] had already begun to cultivate. Both guitarists also featured prominently in magazines such as ''[[Guitar for the Practicing Musician]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}
    
''Dawn Patrol'''s first single, "Don't Tell Me You Love Me", received a boost through its [[MTV]] video airplay, and peaked modestly at number&nbsp;40 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart. "Sing Me Away", a concert favorite sung by Keagy, fell short of the top 40 at a peak position of number 54, though it also was featured on MTV.  Night Ranger's popularity solidified with their second album, ''Midnight Madness'', which pushed the band from opening act to headliner status by the summer of 1984. Apart from "Rock in America", ''Midnight Madness'' spun off two hit ballads: "When You Close Your Eyes" (number 14) and "Sister Christian" (number five), written and sung by Kelly Keagy for his younger sister, Christine. "Sister Christian" proved to be the band's milestone—as well as a millstone.<ref name= kelly/> According to a later interview with Gillis, "Sister Christian" was actually completed in 1982, but Gillis said the band chose not to release it on ''Dawn Patrol'' because they were afraid of losing their hard rock credibility.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 1985 Night Ranger continued headlining their own tours in support of ''7 Wishes'', which followed a very loose concept of the band flying across the ocean in a WWII [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] bomber. Blades later reported Gillis and he were fascinated by World War II planes. Night Ranger's "Sentimental Street" video even placed them in an [[Amelia Earhart]] scenario, with the entire band lost at sea. Like ''Midnight Madness'', ''7 Wishes'' garnered three hit singles: "Sentimental Street" (number eight; sung by Kelly Keagy); Blades' mid-tempo rocker "Four in the Morning (I Can't Take Anymore)" (number 19), the title describing the time of night Blades wrote the song;<ref name="songfacts">{{cite web

}}</ref> and the pleasant, acoustic-flavored "Goodbye" (number 17), which had the band veering in an overtly folk-rock, even country, direction. According to a 2001 TNN interview, Blades wrote "Goodbye"  in memory of his older brother, James, who had died from a heroin overdose several years before.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Between 1984 and 1987, Night Ranger branched out into soundtracks, recording or contributing songs to several teen-oriented films. In 1984, the band released "Interstate Love Affair" (later appearing on ''7 Wishes'') for ''[[Teachers (film)|Teachers]]'', starring [[Nick Nolte]]. In 1985, they also contributed another ''7 Wishes'' track, "This Boy Needs to Rock", to the soundtrack of ''[[Explorers (film)|Explorers]]''.  The band also received exposure on two [[Anthony Michael Hall]] vehicles, ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'' (1984) and ''[[Out of Bounds (1986 film)|Out of Bounds]]'' (1986). "Rumours in the Air" from ''Midnight Madness'' appeared on the former, while the latter featured "Wild and Innocent Youth", a rollicking Blades-Keagy composition that has still never been released on a Night Ranger album or compilation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 1987 Blades co-wrote the title theme to the [[Michael J. Fox]] film ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'', which served as the lead-off single on the band's next album, ''Big Life''. Unlike the previous three Night Ranger albums produced by Pat Glasser, this one was produced by [[David Foster]], and featured more up-tempo songs than power ballads.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=March 1|first1=Jeff GilesPublished|last2=2017|title=30 Years Ago: Night Ranger Struggle to Maintain Momentum With 'Big Life'|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/night-ranger-big-life/|access-date=2020-12-02|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en}}</ref>

''Big Life'' featured some fairly mature Blades-Keagy songwriting, including the nuanced fan favorite "Rain Comes Crashing Down", inspired by a stormy California afternoon. Sung by Keagy, "Carry On" was most reminiscent of classic Night Ranger, and featured as the flip side of "Secret of My Success".  None of the chosen ''Big Life'' singles hit the top 40. "Secret of My Success" stalled just short of hit-single status at number 64 on ''Billboard's ''Hot 100 despite heavy [[MTV]] rotation in the spring of 1987.  Night Ranger also openly quarreled with MCA over choosing "Hearts Away" in lieu of one of their heavier songs. Their label expected another top-10 ballad, like "Sister Christian" or "Sentimental Street", but despite Keagy's passionate vocals, "Hearts Away" failed to catch on during Night Ranger's 1987 tour (peaking at number 90 on ''Billboard's ''Hot 100)—a vigorous series of dates across North America and the Caribbean, featuring [[The Outfield]] as the opening act. A third single/video was released for "Color Of Your Smile", but it failed to reach the charts due to limited airplay.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In early 1988, Fitzgerald left during the recording of Night Ranger's fifth album, citing his own diminished role in the guitar-driven band, though Fitzgerald had originally suggested the addition of [[Jeff Watson (guitarist)|Jeff Watson]] to augment the band's sound in the first place.  With "Fitz" gone, Night Ranger acquired a touring keyboardist, Jesse Bradman, to complete the next album, ''[[Man in Motion (Night Ranger album)|Man in Motion]]'', which promised a return to earlier form with more hard rock to anchor the group's sagging fortunes. None of the singles from it were distinguished enough to gain radio airplay, though, as MCA once again chose ballads over rockers. "I Did It for Love" (written by [[Russ Ballard]]) fared poorly, even with a cameo appearance by popular actress [[Morgan Fairchild]] in the video. The band still views "Restless Kind" as a favorite, but it failed to chart. "Don't Start Thinking (I'm Alone Tonight)" and "Reason to Be" were similarly unsuccessful in early 1989. ''Man in Motion'' thus became the first Night Ranger album not to achieve gold or platinum status.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=320/1}}</ref>

=== Early 1990s: "Moon Ranger" era ===
After a tour in 1988–89 supporting ''Man in Motion'' (including an opening slot for [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]]), Blades left Night Ranger to form the popular super-group [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]] with [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Tommy Shaw]] of [[Styx (band)|Styx]].<ref name= jack/>

In 1991, Keagy and Gillis enlisted Gary Moon (ex-[[Three Dog Night]]) to replace Blades as vocalist/bassist and decided to reform as a trio after Jeff Watson decided to pursue a solo career.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> In 1993, David Zajicek was added as a full member on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals to the new unit of the group and to back the coming album and bolster the group's stage sound.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The reformed nucleus of the group (Gillis, Keagy, Moon, and Zajicek) then recorded ''[[Feeding off the Mojo]]'' in 1995, with producer David Prater, who previously introduced Zajicek to Night Ranger.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

=== 1996–1999: "Reunion" ===
[[File:Night Ranger 080121-N-5416W-044.JPG|thumb|Night Ranger (2008)]]
[[Image:Kelly Keagy.jpg|thumb|Kelly Keagy (2009)]]
In 1996 Blades returned to Night Ranger, which ultimately led to a reunion of all five original members for two studio albums on [[CMC Records]], which engineered a similar comeback for Styx. While ''Neverland'' and ''Seven'' did not become as successful as the band's early material in the United States, these albums became quite popular in [[Japan]], and the ballad "Forever All Over Again" (from ''Neverland'') did become a minor [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] hit in the States. The band continued to tour between solo albums and projects, mostly on the summer festival circuit. Blades also began a stint as chief counselor for the [[Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 1999, they joined other 1980s bands in the second installment of the [[Rock Never Stops Tour]], which also happened to feature Blades' former Damn Yankees bandmate Ted Nugent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

=== 2000–2010 ===
In 2003, Fitzgerald was replaced by [[Great White]] rhythm guitarist/keyboardist [[Michael Lardie]]. Fitzgerald began handling offstage keyboards once again for [[Van Halen]] in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 2007, while working on their next release, ''[[Hole in the Sun]]'', Watson was fired from the band. His replacement for the remainder of their 2007 tour was [[Winger (band)|Winger]]/[[Whitesnake]] guitarist [[Reb Beach]]. Lardie and Beach soon left the band to focus on Great White and Winger/Whitesnake, respectively. Christian Matthew Cullen replaced Lardie in 2007, while Joel Hoekstra took over for Beach by early 2008.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

''Hole in the Sun'' was released overseas in April 2007, but did not appear in the US until July 2008.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In January 2008, in a podcast interview with ''Stuck in the 80s'', Blades said the band's latest album, ''Hole in the Sun'', would be released in 2008 and supported by a national tour. In addition, he said the band was flying to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in late January to play a special show for Navy and Marines troops on the island. To date, Night Ranger has sold 16 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tampabay.com/80s/2008/01/night-ranger-po.html |title=Stuck in the '80s &#124; tampabay.com: Archives |publisher=Blogs.tampabay.com |date=January 14, 2008 |access-date=September 15, 2009}}</ref>

=== 2011–present ===
When not with Night Ranger, Hoekstra played guitar for the hit Broadway show ''Rock of Ages'' and the [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]]. Hoekstra also did double duty for a stretch of the band's 2011 tour, filling in for [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of Foreigner, which was also on the bill that summer along with Journey.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

On March 8, 2011, Night Ranger announced new member Eric Levy ([[Garaj Mahal]]) and the departure of Christian Matthew Cullen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nightranger.com/news/please-make-welcome-eric-levy |title=Please Make Welcome Eric Levy&#124; nightranger.com: News |publisher=nightranger.com |date=March 11, 2011 |access-date=March 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714182316/http://www.nightranger.com/news/please-make-welcome-eric-levy |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In May 2012, Night Ranger celebrated the 30th anniversary of their debut album''Dawn Patrol'' by recording "24 Strings and a Drummer" as both a live DVD and album in an intimate, all-acoustic setting in front of a select number of fans at TRI Studios in San Rafael, California. According to Brave Words,<ref>{{cite web |title=Night Ranger To Release 24 Strings and a Drummer |date=September 5, 2012 |url=http://bravewords.com/news/night-ranger-to-release-24-strings-a-drummer-live-acoustic-cd-dvd-package |publisher=Brave Words.Com}}</ref> the CD/DVD features some of their greatest hits, such as "(You Can Still) Rock in America" and "Sister Christian", in new acoustic arrangements.

On June 4, 2012, Night Ranger returned to the Islington Academy in London for the second headlining show in 12 months at the 800-capacity venue.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

On July 12, 2012, Night Ranger opened for the German band The Scorpions at its US farewell "Get Your Sting and Blackout" tour at [[Merriweather Post Pavilion]] in [[Columbia, Maryland]]. Alongside their major hits, the band also commemorated Gillis's brief stint with [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band with a cover of "Crazy Train".{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

From July 13 to 15, 2012, Night Ranger performed in the small midwestern town of Woodhaven, Michigan, for the Uncle Sam Jam.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

On September 1, 2012, Night Ranger performed as the headlining act for the "River Days" festival in Portsmouth, Ohio.
