Stone appeared in three films released in 2009. The first of these was opposite [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Jennifer Garner]] and [[Michael Douglas]] in [[Mark Waters (director)|Mark Waters]]' ''[[Ghosts of Girlfriends Past]]''. Loosely based on [[Charles Dickens]]' 1843 [[novella]] ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', the romantic comedy has her playing a ghost who haunts her former boyfriend. Critical reaction to the film was negative, though it was a modest commercial success.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ghostsofgirlfriendspast.htm |title=Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |access-date=March 25, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407014245/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ghostsofgirlfriendspast.htm |archive-date=April 7, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=March 25, 2016 |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1193906-ghosts_of_girlfriends_past |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408110619/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1193906-ghosts_of_girlfriends_past/ |archive-date=April 8, 2016 }}</ref> Her most financially profitable venture that year was [[Ruben Fleischer]]'s $102.3&nbsp;million-grossing horror comedy film ''[[Zombieland]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=2009 Yearly Box Office Results |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2009 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |access-date=March 26, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406233637/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2009 |archive-date=April 6, 2016 }}</ref> in which she features alongside [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Woody Harrelson]] and [[Abigail Breslin]].
