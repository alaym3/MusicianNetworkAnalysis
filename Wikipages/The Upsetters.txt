'''The Upsetters''' was the name given to the [[house band]] for Jamaican [[reggae]] producer [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]]. The name of the band comes from Perry's nickname of Upsetter, after his song "I Am the Upsetter", a musical dismissal of his former boss [[Coxsone Dodd]].

== History ==
The Upsetters were originally [[Gladdy's All-Stars]], led by pianist [[Gladstone Anderson]] and it was they who originally [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] the international hits "Live Injection" and "[[Return of Django (song)|Return of Django]]". The [[double A-side]] release of "Return of Django" / "Dollar in the Teeth", peaked at #5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in November 1969.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

This line-up remained the studio band that is most associated with the name, going on to eventually form the nucleus of [[Bob Marley]]'s backing band [[Wailers Band|The Wailers]].<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Upsetters,+The The Upsetters at Discogs.com]</ref>

The band included guitarist Alva Lewis, [[organist]] [[Glen Adams]] and brothers [[Aston Barrett|Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] and [[Carlton Barrett]], on bass guitar and drums respectively. Under Lee "Scratch" Perry's direction, the band backed Bob Marley on a full-time basis, especially with his 1969 groundbreaking works [[Soul Rebels]] and [[Soul Revolution]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DykffzkFALoC&q=%22The+Upsetters%22+-wikipedia&pg=PA20|title=Rock Obituaries: Knocking On Heaven's Door|last=Talevski|first=Nick|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9780857121172|language=en}}</ref>  

By 1972 the Barrett brothers had joined The Wailers and Scratch brought in other musicians to replace them. The main Black Ark Upsetters became [[Boris Gardiner]] (bass), Mikey Richards, [[Sly Dunbar]], Benbow Creary (drums), [[Earl "Chinna" Smith]] (guitar), Winston Wright (keyboards) and [[Keith Sterling]] (keyboards).
