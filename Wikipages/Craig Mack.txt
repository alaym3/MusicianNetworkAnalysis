'''Craig Jamieson Mack''' (May 10, 1970<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|date=2018-03-13|title=Craig Mack, 'Flava in Ya Ear' Rapper, Is Dead at 47|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/obituaries/craig-mack-flava-in-ya-ear-dead.html|access-date=2020-10-05|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> – March 12, 2018) was an American rapper and record producer. He helped build the foundation for [[Bad Boy Records]], one of hip hop’s most influential labels.

Born in [[The Bronx]] but raised in [[Long Island]],<ref name=":0" /> Craig Mack began rapping as a teenager under the name MC EZ and released one single in 1988, "Just Rhymin'" backed with “Get Retarded,” as part of MC EZ & Troup. Mack then became friends with fellow Long Island hip hop act [[EPMD]] and eventually went on tour with the duo, doing jobs as a roadie. After a few years without forward movement in his recording career, Mack took advantage of an opportunity to rap for [[Sean Combs]], and secured a record deal with Combs’s newly founded label, [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]. Mack is best known for his 1994 hit, "[[Flava in Ya Ear]]".

==Career==
His first [[Single (music)|single]] "Get Retarded/Just Rhymin'" was released under the name MC EZ in 1988 on [[Fresh Records (US)|Fresh Records]]. Mack is best known for his 1994 hit single "[[Flava In Ya Ear]]", which was released under his real name. The [[remix]] of the single was the breakout appearance of [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], as well as one of the first solo appearances by [[Busta Rhymes]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Thompson|first=Paul|date=2018-03-13|title=Remembering Craig Mack, Bad Boy's Forgotten First Success Story|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/craig-mack-bad-boys-rap-obituary.html|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Vulture|language=en-us}}</ref> While Mack was technically the first rapper to release music on [[Bad Boy Records]],<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-03-19|title=How Craig Mack helped secure Bad Boy Records' place in hip-hop history|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/craig-mack-dead-died-new-york-hip-hop-rapper-bad-boy-records-sean-combs-puff-dad-notorious-b-i-g-a8263131.html|access-date=2020-10-05|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref> the success of The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album ''[[Ready to Die]]'', which released exactly seven days before Mack's debut album [[Project Funk da World]], overshadowed Mack's early success on the label.<ref name=":1" />

Although Sean Combs mentioned in a 1994 interview on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'' that he was working with Mack on his second album, which was to be released sometime in January 1995, this proved to not be the case. Present at that interview (which also included The Notorious B.I.G.), Mack himself appeared puzzled by the statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7iA5HDWdM |title=Diddy/Puff Daddy CAUGHT Lying to Craig Mack about 2nd album!!! |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2012-04-09}}</ref> Mack did release a second album in 1997 without Bad Boy, but none of the singles charted and Mack was unable to repeat his success. In an interview, The Notorious B.I.G. says he appeared on the remix of "Flava In Ya Ear" for political reasons for Combs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVv4zGLTsek&t=113|title=Notorious BIG With Lil Cease Interview (Throwback Footage) |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> In 2002, Mack would appear in the music video for Puffy's single "[[I Need a Girl (Part One)]]".<ref>{{Cite web|title=P.

After a few attempts to return to success in the early-2000s, it was said that Mack was working on his third studio album in 2002, which was set to be released in 2007.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} The single "Mack Tonight" was released for the album in 2006.

Mack then disappeared from the hip hop industry until in 2012, when a video was leaked on YouTube saying he had joined a Christian ministry, surprising family members and fans.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Is Craig Mack Part Of A Religious Cult? {{!}} The Urban Daily|url=https://theurbandaily.com/1819075/craig-mack-joins-religious-cult/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=theurbandaily.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=r/hiphopheads - Wait, so hold up, did Craig Mack join a doomsday cult?|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/3nzk9t/wait_so_hold_up_did_craig_mack_join_a_doomsday/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=reddit|date=8 October 2015|language=en-US}}</ref> From 2012 until his death, Mack resided in the [[Overcomer Ministry]] located in [[Walterboro, South Carolina]].<ref>Nicola Menzie, [http://www.christianpost.com/news/rapper-craig-mack-now-a-christian-testifies-of-leaving-wickedness-for-righteousness-in-church-video-101830/ "Rapper Craig Mack, Now a Christian, Testifies of Leaving 'Wickedness' for 'Righteousness' in Church Video,"] ''[[The Christian Post]]'', August 8, 2013.</ref> The Overcomer Ministry is a secluded Christian commune that has been described as a cult,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> and whose leader [[Brother Stair]] has been charged with various crimes including assault and sexual conduct with a minor.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Schladebeck|first=Jessica|title=Inside the controversial 'cult' where rapper Craig Mack spent his final years|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cult-rapper-craig-mack-spent-final-years-article-1.3872397|access-date=2020-10-05|website=nydailynews.com}}</ref> The Overcomer Ministry's YouTube channel released a video titled "Craig Mack Testimony" on May 22, 2016,<ref>{{Citation|last=The Overcomer Ministry|title=Craig Mack Testimony|date=2016-05-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO5d6iNI_Ck|access-date=2016-06-10}}</ref> in which Mack appears in the middle of the church to rap about Christianity through a remix of "When God Comes".<ref>{{Citation|last=BoomBap4Life|title=10 – When God Comes – Craig Mack|date=2011-04-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us0nTZXee80|access-date=2016-06-10}}</ref> The last part of the video entails a full version of the song with better production quality and a beat.
