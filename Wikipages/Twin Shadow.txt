== Biography ==
=== Early life and career beginnings (1983–2009) ===
Lewis was born March 30, 1983<ref>{{cite web|last=Bermingham|first=Finbarr|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/features/302244-twin_shadow_born_in_80s|publisher=The Skinny|access-date=September 27, 2012|title=Twin Shadow: Born in the 80s}}</ref> in the Dominican Republic and raised in Florida. Lewis's first exposure to music started by singing in his church choir.

Around 2000, he moved to Boston and started the band Mad Man Films alongside Joseph Ciampini (drums) (of [[Hooray For Earth]]) and Zak Longo (bass) of Before Lazers. Mad Man Films released two records independently. In 2006, not satisfied with recording music for theatre and films, Lewis moved to Brooklyn, NY, and started the Twin Shadow project.<ref name="indierockcafe" />

=== ''Forget'' (2010–2011) ===
Lewis' debut album, [[Forget (Twin Shadow album)|''Forget'']], was released November 15, 2010 on [[Terrible Records]].

=== ''Confess'' (2012–2013) ===
[[File:Twin Shadow at Lincoln Hall.jpg|thumb|Twin Shadow at Lincoln Hall in Chicago, August 5, 2012]]
On July 10, 2012, Lewis released his follow-up album, [[Confess (album)|''Confess'']], which he produced himself.<ref name="Pitchfork" /> Lewis gained inspiration for the album after being involved in a motorcycle accident in Boston.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|last=Fitzmaurice|first=Larry|title=Twin Shadow – Interview|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8882-twin-shadow/|access-date=July 9, 2012|date=July 5, 2012}}</ref> Two of the album's songs, "Five Seconds" and "Patient", were transformed into a music video saga which drew inspiration from Lewis's novel ''Night of the Silver Sun''.<ref name="Minsker">{{cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|title=Video: Twin Shadow: "Patient"|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/47112-video-twin-shadow-patient/|publisher=pitchfork.com|access-date=September 6, 2012|date=July 10, 2012}}</ref> [[The A.V. Club]] described the album as "filled with Morrissey-esque yelps and Human League-worthy choruses, [...] Twin Shadow manages to digest his influences rather than simply replicate them. ''Confess'' retains the humid fog that saturated ''Forget'', but the instrumentation is brighter, louder, and sharper. Synthesizers punch through the atmosphere, and Lewis' exquisite croon floats above it all."<ref>{{cite web|last=Eby|first=Margaret|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/twin-shadow-confess,82177|title=Review: Twin Shadow: Confess|publisher=Avclub.com|date=2012-07-10|access-date=2015-03-18}}</ref>

The album debuted on [[Billboard 200]] at No. 54, and on the Top Rock Albums chart at No. 18. The album has sold 30,000 copies in the US as of March 2015.<ref>{{cite magazine|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150314222707/http://hitsdailydouble.com/new_album_releases |archive-date= March 14, 2015 |url=http://hitsdailydouble.com/new_album_releases |title=Upcoming Releases |magazine=Hits Daily Double |publisher=HITS Digital Ventures }}</ref>

=== ''Eclipse'' and ''Night Rally'' (2014–2016) ===
After criticising his own work for being too elitist,<ref name="WilsonBillboard">{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Carl|title=Album Review: Twin Shadow Clears the Electronic Fog on Major-Label Debut 'Eclipse'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6502363/twin-shadow-eclipse-album-review|website=Billboard|access-date=March 19, 2015}}</ref> Lewis set out to create a more approachable album, ''[[Eclipse (Twin Shadow album)|Eclipse]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leas|first1=Ryan|title=Q&A: Twin Shadow On Eclipse, Signing To Warner Bros., & Indie Vs.

If that makes me 'pop,' then that makes me pop.}}</ref> his first with a major record label, [[Warner Music]]. Carl Wilson of [[Billboard Magazine]] notes that Twin Shadow has left behind much of his "foggy layers of synths and drum machines" reminiscent of the likes of [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Simple Minds]] in favor of a more contemporary sound.<ref name="WilsonBillboard" />

''Eclipse'' is also noted for Lewis' almost complete departure from guitar playing, a conscious decision according to a [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] interview in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Ian|title=Twin Shadow|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9575-twin-shadow|website=Pitchfork|access-date=March 19, 2015}}</ref>

In March 2015, NPR exclusively streamed the album and Twin Shadow was live in session at [[KCRW]] on their "[[Morning Becomes Eclectic (Live at KCRW)|Morning Becomes Eclectic]]" segment. In April 2015, Eclipse was made [[WFUV]] AAA radio album of the month, Lewis was featured in [[Interview magazine|Interview Magazine]] as part of their Pop Craft feature and he was featured on the cover of Culture Collide's "Travel with Purpose" magazine. ''Eclipse'' also marks the first album of Twin Shadow's to include creative direction by Milan Zrnic. Zrnic photographed all of the imagery associated with the album and consulted on all video content, tour staging, merchandise, and styling.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beauchemin|first1=Michelle|title=Twin Shadow announces new album|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/57352-twin-shadow-announces-new-album-eclipse-shares-video-for-turn-me-up/|website=Pitchfork}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gruger|first1=William|title=Twin Shadow & Tumblr|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6487574/tumblr-irl-sxsw-series|website=Billboard|access-date=November 18, 2015}}</ref>

"To the Top", a song from ''Eclipse'', was featured in the trailer for the film ''[[Paper Towns (film)|Paper Towns]]'', produced by the same team as ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'' and starring [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Nat Wolff]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Strecker|first1=Erin|title=Twin Shadow, Mikky Ekko Soundtrack 'Paper Towns' Trailer|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6509166/paper-towns-trailer-john-green-watch|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=November 18, 2015}}</ref>

On April 17, 2015, Twin Shadow and his band and crew were involved in a tour bus crash.<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/article/twin-shadows-tour-bus-was-accident-two-people-rema-218302 Twin Shadow's tour bus crashes], avclub.com; accessed November 18, 2015.</ref> Both driver John Crawford and drummer Andy Bauer were hospitalized and in serious condition.

On July 28, 2015, Twin Shadow released the ''Night Rally'' mixtape for free online, in conjunction with the announcement of the Night Rally Tour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/Premiere-night-rally-twin-shadow|title=We Catch Up with Twin Shadow, Plus Download His New Mixtape 'Night Rally' for Free|date=2015-07-28|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-us}}</ref> Due to Bauer's severe injuries from the April bus crash, the band retooled the songs in the live set, with samples and a drum machine to keep time. Twin Shadow departed on their Night Rally Tour in August 2015 through the United States and Canada, and opened a portion of the Fall 2015 Death Cab for Cutie United States tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/59155-death-cab-for-cutie-add-dates-with-explosions-in-the-sky-twin-shadow-and-best-coast|title=Death Cab for Cutie Add Dates With Explosions in the Sky, Twin Shadow, and Best Coast {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-10}}</ref>
''Night Rally'' consists of recordings from 2010 to 2014. During his healing time in Los Angeles following the bus crash, Lewis began to rummage through old hard drives. He left a message under the mixtape on [[SoundCloud]], expressing how his discovery gave him a glimpse into the past five years:

<blockquote>The more I dug the more I realized how much music was made in the last 5 years. Being home I had the time and perspective to enjoy all the little impulses, embarrassing choices, and exciting moments that I couldn't bottle. There were also some songs that I couldn't understand why I never finished."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.twinshadow.net/news/download-free-night-rally-mixtape-19286|title=DOWNLOAD THE FREE NIGHT RALLY MIXTAPE – T W I N S H A D O W Latest News|website=T W I N S H A D O W Official Website|language=en|access-date=2018-01-10}}</ref></blockquote>
