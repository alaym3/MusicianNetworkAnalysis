'''21''' ('''twenty-one''') is the [[natural number]] following [[20 (number)|20]] and preceding [[22 (number)|22]].

==In mathematics==
21 is:

* a [[composite number]], its proper [[divisor]]s being [[1 (number)|1]], [[3 (number)|3]] and [[7 (number)|7]], and a [[deficient number]] as the sum of these divisors is less than the number itself.
* a [[Fibonacci number]] as it is the sum of the preceding terms in the sequence, 8 and 13.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000045|title=Sloane's A000045 : Fibonacci numbers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>
* the fifth [[Motzkin number]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001006|title=Sloane's A001006 : Motzkin numbers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>
* a [[triangular number]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000217|title=Sloane's A000217 : Triangular numbers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref> because it is the sum of the first six natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21).
* an [[octagonal number]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000567|title=Sloane's A000567 : Octagonal numbers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>
* a [[Padovan sequence|Padovan number]], preceded by the terms 9, 12, 16 (it is the sum of the first two of these) in the padovan sequence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000931|title=Sloane's A000931 : Padovan sequence|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>
* a [[Blum integer]], since it is a semiprime with both its prime factors being [[Gaussian prime]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A016105|title=Sloane's A016105 : Blum integers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>
* the sum of the divisors of the first 5 [[positive integers]] (i.e., 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 3) + (1 + 2 + 4) + (1 + 5))
* the smallest non-trivial example of a Fibonacci number whose digits are Fibonacci numbers and whose digit sum is also a Fibonacci number.
* a [[Harshad number]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005349|title=Sloane's A005349 : Niven (or Harshad) numbers|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>* a [[repdigit]] in base 4 (111<sub>4</sub>).
* the smallest natural number that is not close to a power of 2, 2<sup>''n''</sup>, where the range of closeness is ±''n''.
* the smallest number of differently sized squares needed to [[squaring the square|square the square]].<ref>C. J. Bouwkamp, and A. J. W. Duijvestijn, "Catalogue of Simple Perfect Squared Squares of Orders 21 Through 25." Eindhoven University of Technology, Nov. 1992.</ref>
* the largest ''n'' with this property: for any positive integers ''a'',''b'' such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''n'', at least one of <math>\tfrac{a}{b}</math> and <math>\tfrac{b}{a}</math> is a terminating decimal. See a brief proof below.

Note that a necessary condition for ''n'' is that for any ''a'' coprime to ''n'', ''a'' and ''n'' - ''a'' must satisfy the condition above, therefore at least one of ''a'' and ''n'' - ''a'' must only have factor 2 and 5.

Let <math>A(n)</math> denote the quantity of the numbers smaller than ''n'' that only have factor 2 and 5 and that are coprime to ''n'', we instantly have <math>\frac{\varphi(n)}{2} < A(n)</math>.

We can easily see that for sufficiently large ''n'', <math>A(n) \sim \frac{\log_2(n) \log_5(n)}{2} = \frac{\ln^{2}(n)}{2 \ln(2) \ln(5)}</math>, but <math>\varphi(n) \sim \frac {n} {e^\gamma\; \ln \ln n}</math>, <math>A(n) = o(\varphi(n))</math> as ''n'' goes to infinity, thus <math>\frac{\varphi(n)}{2} < A(n)</math> fails to hold for sufficiently large ''n''.

In fact, For every ''n'' > 2, we have
:<math>A< 1 + \log_2(n) + \frac{3 \log_5(n)}{2} + \frac{\log_2(n) \log_5(n)}{2} </math>
and
:<math>\varphi(n) > \frac {n} {e^\gamma\; \log \log n + \frac {3} {\log \log n}} </math>
so <math>\frac{\varphi(n)}{2} < </math> fails to hold when ''n'' > 273 (actually, when ''n'' > 33).

Just check a few numbers to see that '= 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 21.
