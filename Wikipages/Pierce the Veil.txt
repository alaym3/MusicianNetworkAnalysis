==History==

===Early years and ''A Flair for the Dramatic'' (2006–2009)===
Pierce the Veil was founded by Mike Fuentes and Vic Fuentes in 2006,<ref name="AllMusic" /> after the disbandment of Before Today. The brothers continued to write songs together and eventually came up with enough material for a new full-length album. Still backed by their label, [[Equal Vision Records]], they wrote and recorded an entire album on their own in [[Seattle, WA]] with producer Casey Bates. The brothers released the album ''[[A Flair for the Dramatic]]'' on June 26, 2007, under a new name: Pierce the Veil, which is derived from a song of the same name from Before Today's album, ''A Celebration of an Ending''. Soon after, Pierce the Veil acquired new members Tony Perry (lead guitar) and Jaime Preciado (bass). Pierce the Veil toured vigorously for about 3 months after the release of ''[[A Flair for the Dramatic]]''. They have toured with bands such as [[A Day to Remember]], [[Chiodos]], [[From First to Last]], [[Emery (band)|Emery]], [[All Time Low]], [[Sleeping with Sirens]], [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]] and [[Mayday Parade]].

In November 2007, Pierce the Veil performed one date on the [[Warped Tour 2007|Vans Warped Tour 2007]], and were on the entire tour in 2008. They also played the [[Bamboozle Left]] in 2008. Their first headlining tour, called ''The Delicious Tour'', which took place in October&ndash;November 2008, featured [[Breathe Carolina]], [[Four Letter Lie]] and [[Emarosa]]. They ended their record cycle with the [[Taste of Chaos]] 2009 tour along with [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]], [[Four Year Strong]] and [[Cancer Bats]]. Vic and Mike Fuentes with Ayrton Jara confirmed to be included in the new project and [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Isles & Glaciers]], featuring vocalists [[Craig Owens (vocalist)|Craig Owens]] of [[Chiodos]] and [[Jonny Craig]] of [[Emarosa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/5371.htm|title=News - Alternative Press|work=Alternative Press|access-date=May 20, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051853/http://www.altpress.com/news/5371.htm|archive-date=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The "supergroup" released its first EP titled ''[[The Hearts of Lonely People]]'' on March 9, 2010.

In November 2017, drummer Mike Fuentes was accused of soliciting nude photos and statutory rape by a young woman. The incidents were have alleged to have occurred roughly a decade prior over the course of several years. The pair allegedly initiated contact on MySpace before meeting for the first time at a Pierce the Veil concert. Fuentes was 24 at the time, while the girl was 16, a [[Underage sex|legal minor]] in the state of California. The woman stated they had sex after meeting again at a concert during Warped Tour. The relationship was said to have lasted until she turned 18.<ref>''Hysteria Mag'': [http://www.hysteriamag.com/pierce-veil-mike-fuentes-accused-assaulting-minor/ PIERCE THE VEIL // Mike Fuentes Accused of Assaulting a Minor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115225630/http://www.hysteriamag.com/pierce-veil-mike-fuentes-accused-assaulting-minor/ |date=November 15, 2017 }}</ref> No formal charges were brought publicly against Mike Fuentes for this allegation.

In December 2017, a second woman accused him of requesting nude pictures when she was a minor. She accused him anonymously on Twitter. The woman claimed they first met at Warped Tour in 2008, when she was 14 years old where they exchanged phone numbers. When she turned 15, Fuentes allegedly requested nude photos from her.<ref>''[[Loudwire]]'': [http://loudwire.com/pierce-the-veil-mike-fuentes-accused-of-sexual-relations-with-a-minor/ Pierce the Veil’s Mike Fuentes Accused of Sexual Relations With a Minor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118235118/http://loudwire.com/pierce-the-veil-mike-fuentes-accused-of-sexual-relations-with-a-minor/ |date=November 18, 2017 }}</ref>

In light of the allegations, Fuentes and the rest of the band released a statement later that month, stating that Mike Fuentes was to step down as drummer to "concentrate on his personal life". The band announced a hiatus and cancelled their planned 2018 UK tour with [[All Time Low]].<ref name="altpress23" /> No formal charges were brought publicly against Mike Fuentes for this allegation.
