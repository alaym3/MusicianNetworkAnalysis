'''Rotting Christ''' is a Greek [[black metal]]<!-- Stop changing this to black metal, see box. --> band formed in 1987. They are noted for being one of the first [[black metal]] bands within this region, as well as a premier act within the European [[Underground music|underground]] [[heavy metal music|metal]] scene.<ref name="allmusic"/> They are also responsible for creating the signature Greek black metal sound prevalent in the early 1990s.

== History<!--'Unisound Records' redirects here--> ==
Rotting Christ was founded in 1987 as a [[grindcore]] act. They released a series of demos and splits with local bands during their rehearsal era. During this period, the group gradually altered their sound with influence from proto-[[black metal]] bands like [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Venom (band)|Venom]], and in the process became one of the inaugurators of black metal. Their 1989 demo, ''Satanas Tedeum'', presented a crossover between black metal and grindcore. In 1991, the band released ''[[Passage to Arcturo]]'', their career-breaking EP.

One of band's major debuts was on the 1993 "Fuck Christ Tour", which also featured [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] and [[Blasphemy (band)|Blasphemy]]. During this concert, some audience members had engaged in cutting and self-mutilation that resulted in [[Inpatient care|hospitalization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bands.metalland.net/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?id=1233&lang=en|title=Band "Rotting Christ" :: Download Rotting Christ MP3, read Biography, Discography, Members and more...|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> Before signing to Unisound Records (a now-defunct Athens-based [[independent record label]] founded in 1992),{{efn|Not to be confused with the Stockholm-based [[Unisound Recordings]].}} [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]'s [[Øystein Aarseth]] had expressed interest in distributing the band through his [[Deathlike Silence Productions]] label,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-900_when_hades_strikes.aspx|title=CoC : Rant : When Hades Strikes...|access-date=August 14, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212221342/http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-900_when_hades_strikes.aspx|archive-date=February 12, 2012}}</ref> but due to Aarseth's murder the same year, nothing materialized. The band signed to [[Century Media Records|Century Media]] in 1996 and remained on their roster for 10 years before joining [[Season of Mist]].

Rotting Christ has played in many regions outside their native [[Greece]], including the [[Americas]], Greater [[Europe]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Malta]] and the [[Middle East]]. Several heavy metal festivals around the world have hosted the band, including the 2003 [[Wacken Open Air]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]]. Past tour mates include [[My Dying Bride]], [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]], [[Tiamat (band)|Tiamat]], [[Vintersorg]], [[Finntroll]], [[Agathodaimon (band)|Agathodaimon]], [[Old Man's Child]], [[Malevolent Creation]], [[Anorexia Nervosa (band)|Anorexia Nervosa]], [[Vader (band)|Vader]], [[Krisiun]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]], [[Melechesh]] and [[Nile (band)|Nile]], among many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/538/Rotting-Christ.html|title=Rotting Christ html Biography and Band Info at The Gauntlet|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=12448|title=Anorexia Nervosa Join Vader's Blitzkrieg 3 Tour|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metal-rules.com/interviews/RottingChrist.htm|title=Metal Rules!!:  Interview with Rotting Christ|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref>

Rotting Christ was one of the first bands announced to perform the Barge to Hell festival, which is a metal-themed cruise organized by Ultimate Metal Cruises and took place aboard [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]]'s ''[[MS Majesty of the Seas|Majesty of the Seas]]''. Barge to Hell set sail from Port of Miami on December 3, 2012.

{{As of|2012}}, Rotting Christ has been around for 25 years and is one of the longest running bands within the black metal genre. In celebration of the band's longevity, the 2-DVD + 2-CD compilation ''Non Serviam: A 20 Year Apocryphal Story'', shot in Athens on December 8, 2007, was released worldwide February 23, 2009.

''[[Aealo]]'', the band's tenth studio album, was released on February 15, 2010 in Europe and February 23, 2010 in the United States.

To coincide with their 30th anniversary, the band released a new 7" single "The Call" on February 9, 2018; the single's b-side is a live version of "The Sign of Evil Existence", which includes guest vocals by [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]]'s [[Adam Darski|Nergal]] and Varathron's Stefan Necroabyssious.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rotting Christ To Release "The Call" 7" In February|url=http://www.theprp.com/2018/01/19/news/rotting-christ-release-call-7-february/|publisher=theprp.com|date=January 19, 2018|access-date=January 19, 2018}}</ref> The band also released an official biography entitled "Non Serviam: The Official Story Of Rotting Christ" in late November 2018, written by Sakis Tolis and British author Dayal Patterson (author of 'Black Metal: Evolution Of The Cult', 'The Cult Never Dies Vol. One' and 'Into The Abyss') and published by British publishing house Cult Never Dies.

Three [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardists]] had previously been a part of the band; George Tolias, George Zaharopoulos (Magus Wampyr Daoloth of [[Necromantia]]) and a session musician known only as Panayiotis (on ''[[A Dead Poem]]'').

The band members from the beginning, up to ''[[Triarchy of the Lost Lovers]]'' album, were using the pseudonyms Necromayhem for Sakis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Necromayhem|title=Necromayhem|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> Necrosauron for Themis<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Necrosauron|title=Necrosauron|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> and Mutilator for Jim (Dimitris).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/mutilator|title=Mutilator|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> George Zaharopoulos used the pseudonym Morbid for early EP and split-LP releases up to ''Passage to Arcturo'', and the pseudonym Magus Wampyr Daoloth<ref>{{Cite web|title=Magus Wampyr Daoloth|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/311160-Magus-Wampyr-Daoloth|access-date=January 27, 2021|website=Discogs|language=en}}</ref> for ''[[Thy Mighty Contract]]'' and ''[[Non Serviam (album)|Non Serviam]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Patterson|first=Dayal|title=Non Serviam - The Official Story of Rotting Christ (Greek Edition)|last2=Tolis|first2=Sakis|publisher=Brainfood {{!}} Acid Publications|year=2018|isbn=978-960-436-595-1|location=Athens, Greece|pages=|language=Greek}}</ref>

== Publicity ==
Over the years, the group has faced controversy due to their name and gained international media attention in November 1999 during the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|2000 United States Presidential Primaries for Republican Nomination]], when [[candidate]]/[[Christian right|Christian conservative]] [[Gary Bauer]] accused the band of being "anti-Catholic", among other things. In response to Bauer's criticism, [[Sakis Tolis]] wrote:

{{quote|Living in (so called) democratic societies, I think everyone should have the right to call religions as he/she wants. We in fact simply believe they are "rotting"! We are not a "satanic-crusader" type of band but rather one of the many bands that represent the dark side in nowadays Metal music.<ref name=rusmetal.ru>{{cite web|url=http://www.rusmetal.ru/vae_solis/rotting_christ.html|title=Rotting Christ|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref>}}

They also have had to cancel some shows, most recently in May 2005, when [[Megadeth]] frontman [[Dave Mustaine]] threatened to refuse to play at a Greek concert if Rotting Christ were on the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/rottingchrist2.html|title=Rotting Christ interview @ Tartareandesire.com|access-date=August 14, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110080610/http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/rottingchrist2.html|archive-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/greece/athens/rotting%20christ|title=MusicMight :: Artists :: ROTTING CHRIST|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref>

In response to their forced cancellation, Tolis noted:

{{quote|I didn't expect something like that from Dave Mustaine, because, you know, he's supposed to be metal — you know, 'metal band,' all metal ... I just feel sorry for him and for every new Christian with new ideas, because we think Christianity is the worst thing to happen in human history. This is a well-organized trick in order to control society, so when I see someone that's very much Christian, that's full of the system, I feel very sorry for him because he's not free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rotting-christ-mainman-feels-sorry-for-megadeth-s-dave-mustaine/|title=ROTTING CHRIST Mainman Feels 'Sorry' For MEGADETH's DAVE MUSTAINE|last=Blabbermouth|date=February 4, 2007|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref>}}

[[Nuclear Assault]] and former [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] bassist [[Dan Lilker]] defended Rotting Christ and criticized Dave Mustaine's actions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dan-lilker-to-dave-mustaine-break-up-megadeth-and-pursue-your-new-love-for-jesus-on-your-own/|title=DAN LILKER To DAVE MUSTAINE: 'Break Up MEGADETH And Pursue Your New Love For Jesus On Your Own'|last=Blabbermouth|date=May 22, 2005|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> as did [[Nevermore (band)|Nevermore]]'s [[Warrel Dane]], whose bands appeared on Mustaine's [[Gigantour]] in 2005. Dane added:

{{quote|Everybody is free to believe anything he wants to; I just think that Dave misunderstood the whole subject. I have met the guys from Rotting Christ and I don't think that they are Satanists or something. I think that Dave overreacted on this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/musicians/warrel_dane_nevermore.htm?root=14&keep_has_js=1|title=Metal-Temple.com - Warrel Dane interview, 30 June 2005|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref>}}

When playing in [[Malta]], a country which in its constitution declares itself as Roman Catholic, trouble from the Church and other Catholic groups ensued when an unknown person stuck a Rotting Christ flyer to a church door. The band was allowed to play eventually even though they had to change venue.

In April 2018, Rotting Christ were scheduled to play in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Upon arriving in [[Tbilisi]], founding members Sakis and Themis Tolis  were arrested by Georgian authorities under suspicion of terrorism due to their band name, as reported by an announcement from the band's label, [[Season of Mist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/rotting-christ-arrested-georgia/|title=Rotting Christ Arrested in Georgia Under Suspicions of Terrorism|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=June 7, 2018}}</ref>  They had their passports and cell phones confiscated and were detained in prison, without being permitted legal representation or contact with the Greek Embassy for 12 hours.  Afterwards, they were informed by their lawyers that the two were included in a "list of unwanted people for reasons of national security" that labeled them as "Satanists" and "suspects of terrorism".  The two were eventually released, after arrangements made by the band's other members in collaboration with the local promoter, "who involved legal experts, journalists and activists in Georgia".  The band was allowed to perform their scheduled concert and left for their next destination, Armenia, without hassle.

A species of prehistoric [[brittle star]], ''Brezinacantha tolis'', was named after band members Sakis and Themis Tolis.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/new-fossil-species-discovery-named-after-rotting-christ/ |title=New Fossil Species Discovery Named After ROTTING CHRIST}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27326-z|title=Brittle-star mass occurrence on a Late Cretaceous methane seep from South Dakota, USA|year=2018|last1=Thuy|first1=Ben|last2=Landman|first2=Neil H.|last3=Larson|first3=Neal L.|last4=Numberger-Thuy|first4=Lea D.|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=8|issue=1|page=9617|pmid=29941907|pmc=6018167|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.9617T}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
Early in their career, they were responsible for creating what is known as the "classic" Greek black metal sound which can be heard in other bands such as Varathron and Thou Art Lord. Despite the name, the band's traditional lyrical themes involving [[evil]] and [[occultism]] has evolved into a more "mystic" path,<ref name=rusmetal.ru/> and they have modified their musical direction on each album, utilizing elements such as clean melodic [[baritone]] vocals, [[doom metal|doom]], [[gothic metal]] and [[industrial music]] traits, and male/female [[Benedictine]] chants. Recent albums, beginning with ''[[Khronos (Rotting Christ album)|Khronos]]'', have shown the band taking a more modern, faster and more aggressive approach to their [[black metal|blackened]]-[[gothic metal|gothic]] style. Their 2007 album, ''Theogonia'', especially, has been described as more "atmospheric" and "epic" by their label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phonopaca.com/en/members/season_of_mist/season.htm|title=Phonopaca : Accueil|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref>

The group's choice of producers, engineers and mixers has also been varied; Swedish [[extreme metal]] figures [[Dan Swanö]] (Unisound), [[Peter Tägtgren]] (Abyss Studios) and [[Fredrik Nordström]] ([[Studio Fredman]]), German producers [[Andy Classen]] ([[Asphyx]], [[Belphegor (band)|Belphegor]]), Siggi Bemm ([[Therion (band)|Therion]], [[Theatre of Tragedy]]) and [[Waldemar Sorychta]] ([[Lacuna Coil]], [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]]) as well as Xy ([[Samael (band)|Samael]] percussionist/keyboardist) have all contributed to production on the band's albums.
