==Musical style==
The band's initial music featured a gritty [[metalcore]] sound with low-tuned guitars a hint of djent, slight melodies but an overall emphasis on dissonance and equally as gritty lyrics. Tewers used a guttural vocal style most typically found in [[deathcore]] music with minor use of sung vocals in their earlier music mirror their angry and gritty tone conveying his lyricism of dark themes. The band would go on to add some melodic elements in their future releases after incorporating the use of clean vocals during their debut album. Their sophomore album would mark a change a shift to faster aggressive music with the incorporation of [[industrial music|industrial]] samples and even full songs with little to no screaming. By their third album the band began to stray away from their metalcore and deathcore roots leaving the aggression behind in favor of [[experimental rock|experimentation]]. By their fourth outing, ''[[Dispose (album)|Dispose]]'', Tewers stated the album would be a different type of heavy with the band leaving breakdowns and the cliches of metalcore behind them for unpredictable with songs varying from [[alternative rock]] to [[electronica]] many switching seamlessly from genre to the next in a matter of seconds.<ref name="auto"/> The biggest change came with [[multi-instrumentalist]] Landon Tewers including help from the rest of the band in the creative process for ''Dispose'' with Tewers writing, recording and producing all of the band previous releases aside from drums and percussion on some of their older releases.
