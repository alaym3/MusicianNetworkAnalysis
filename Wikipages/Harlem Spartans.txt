== History ==
===Beginnings (2014–2018)===
Harlem Spartans started making music in 2014, using a local youth centre as a music studio. Most artists within Harlem Spartans are from [[Kennington]], with many of them going to Tenison’s School in Oval. Musically, like much of UK drill music, their music contains references to their local area, violence, references to beef with other groups, and is often riddled with slang.<ref name="auto5"/>

The group is known for its beef with Brixton-based group 410.<ref name="crackmagazine1"/><ref name="complex1"/> The beef has been expressed through various diss tracks, and has at times escalated to physical violence. 410 rapper AM released the song "Attempted 1.0" in 2018. The song contained many direct references to violence towards Harlem Spartans members. [[Skengdo & AM]], members of 410, were later given a gang injunction from the police that banned them from entering Kennington or mentioning rival gangs in their music.

===Rise to fame and success of Harlem Spartans (2018–present)===
Prominent songs from the group include "Call Me a Spartan",<ref name="auto5" /> "Kennington Where It Started",<ref name="auto5" /> and Loski's songs "Cool Kid", "Hazards", and "Forrest Gump", the latter of which entered the charts. In April of 2018, Loski released his mixtape ''Call Me Loose.''<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/loski-interview-the-break/|title=The Break Presents: Loski - XXL|last=Rathod|first=Nikita|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523214845/https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/loski-interview-the-break/|archive-date=2019-05-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev3y4p/loski-boasy-new-video-track-interview-2019|title=Drill Artist Loski Is Dripping with Flair|last=Bassil|first=Ryan|date=2019-01-11|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212162720/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev3y4p/loski-boasy-new-video-track-interview-2019|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref>

The minicab drove away from the scene a short distance before the driver was told to stop and Elijah Morgan and Jedaiah Param got out and started chasing Davis. CCTV footage from Ha’penny Hatch showed that Davis was pursued by the pair, as well as two other unidentified males, who were all armed with knives or machetes. Davis' friend had tried to place himself between him and the attackers, but he was overpowered. All four of them stabbed Davis, who collapsed to the ground.

Despite paramedics' efforts, Crosslon died a short time later due to the loss of blood from at least nine stab wounds, including one that penetrated his lung and heart. He was pronounced dead at 03:30 after being stabbed multiple times. Bis was 20-years old at time of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/12/09/bis-harlem-spartans-age-real-name-tributes-on-twitter/|title=Remembering Bis of Harlem Spartans: Age, real name, tributes|last=Weston|first=Christopher|date=2019-12-09|website=HITC|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212201130/https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/12/09/bis-harlem-spartans-age-real-name-tributes-on-twitter/|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref> Elijah Morgan, 20 and Jedaiah Param, 21 were found guilty on Friday, 12 March 2021 following a trial at the Old Bailey.
