'''Ärsenik''' is a [[French rap|rap]] group based in [[Villiers-le-Bel]], [[France]], founded in 1992, and made up of two brothers, [[Lino (rapper)|Lino]] (Gaëlino M'Bani) and [[Calbo (rapper)|Calbo]] (Calboni M'Bani), whose family is originally from [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].

==Career==
Ärsenik started as a band in mid 1990s. Until 1997, the group also included Tony Truand, a cousin. In 1998, now a duo, Ärsenik released their first album ''Quelques gouttes suffisent'' went double gold.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  A new album was planned for 2005, but the two brothers instead decided to concentrate on solo albums.  Lino released ''Paradis Assassiné'' en 2005, which was the name of a solo song on the group's second album.

In 2007 the group released a disc titled ''S'il en reste quelque chose'' which included the most popular songs from the two brothers, such as "L'enfer remonte à la surface", "Rime & chatiments" and "Sexe, pouvoir & biftons".

Revered as one of the original rap groups, their music voices the disaffection of the French underclass, combining African and Arabic melodies and beats with French lyrics. French rap is filled with slang that is hard for even French-speakers to understand; whole songs are delivered in Verlan, the ingenious, dizzying slang in which words are reversed or recombined. Like France's [[chanson]] tradition, French rap is also famous for emphasizing lyrics, and the rappers are widely viewed as heirs to the chansonniers.<ref name="slate.com">[http://www.slate.com/id/2130120 David Brooks vs. gangsta rap. - By Jody Rosen - Slate Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

;As part of Bisso Na Bisso 
In the late 1990s, Lino and Calbo teamed up with a group of rappers who were also second-generation Africans, on a collaborative project called [[Bisso Na Bisso]], an expression which means "just between ourselves" in [[Lingala]], the most commonly spoken language in the [[Congo region]]. Part of this group were Ben-J (from Les Neg'Marrons), Passi (from Ministère A.M.E.R.),  twin brothers Doc and G Kill (from 2Bal), and Mystik and his female cousin M'Passi. The group embarked on a collective return to their African roots, featuring music with an innovative fusion of styles, that mixed modern [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[Zouk (musical movement)|zouk]] sounds with traditional [[Congolese rumba]].<ref>[http://194.117.210.41/siteen/biographie/biographie_6127.asp RFI Musique - - Passi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
