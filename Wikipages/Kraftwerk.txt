'''Kraftwerk''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʁaftvɛɐ̯k|lang}}, {{literally}} "[[power station]]") is a German band formed in [[Düsseldorf]] in 1969 by [[Ralf Hütter]] and [[Florian Schneider]]. Widely considered innovators and pioneers of [[electronic music]], Kraftwerk was among the first successful acts to popularize the genre. The group began as part of [[West Germany|West Germany's]] experimental [[krautrock]] scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including [[synthesizer]]s, [[drum machine]]s, and [[vocoder]]s. [[Wolfgang Flür]] joined the band in 1974 and [[Karl Bartos]] in 1975, expanding the band to a quartet.

On commercially successful albums such as ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' (1974), ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' (1977), ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' (1978), and ''[[Computer World]]'' (1981), Kraftwerk developed a self-described experimental "robot pop" style that combined electronic music with [[pop music|pop]] melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylized image including matching suits. Following the release of ''[[Electric Café]]'' (1986), Flür left the group in 1987, followed by Bartos in 1990. Founding member Schneider left in 2008.

The band's work has influenced a diverse range of artists and many genres of modern music, including [[synth-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[post-punk]], [[techno]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], and [[club music]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/see-them-to-believe-it-why-kraftwerk-is-the-worlds-most-influential-band-78138|title=See them to believe it: why Kraftwerk is the world's most influential band|first=Uwe|last=Schütte|website=The Conversation}}<br />{{Cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/kraftwerk-are-more-influential-than-the-beatles-let-us-explain/|title=Kraftwerk Are More Influential Than The Beatles.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1969–1973) ===
[[Florian Schneider]] (flutes, synthesizers, violin) and [[Ralf Hütter]] (organ, synthesizers) met as students at the [[Robert Schumann Hochschule]] in Düsseldorf in the late 1960s, participating in the German [[experimental music]] and art scene of the time, which ''[[Melody Maker]]'' jokingly dubbed "[[krautrock]]".<ref name="Bussy">{{cite book |last=Bussy |first=Pascal |title=Kraftwerk—Man, Machine & Music |publisher=SAF Publishing |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-946719-70-9}}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2019}} 

They joined a quintet known as [[Organisation (band)|Organisation]], which released one album, ''[[Tone Float]]'' in 1970,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Organisation-Tone-Float/release/133960|title=Organisation – Tone Float (1970, Vinyl)|access-date=23 June 2021|website=Discogs.com}}</ref> issued on [[RCA Records]] in the UK, and split shortly thereafter.<ref>Pascal Bussy: "Kraftwerk: Man, Machine and Music", SAF Publishing Ltd., Reprinted 1993, 1997, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-946719-70-9}}</ref> Schneider became interested in synthesizers,  deciding to acquire one in 1970. While visiting an exhibition in their hometown about visual artists [[Gilbert and George]], they saw "two men wearing suits and ties, claiming to bring art into everyday life. The same year, Hütter and Schneider started bringing everyday life into art and form Kraftwerk".<ref name="Rogers">{{cite news |first=Jude |last=Rogers |author-link=Jude Rogers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/27/kraftwerk-most-influential-electronic-band-tate |title=Why Kraftwerk are still the world's most influential band |newspaper=The Observer |date=27 January 2013 |access-date=27 January 2013}}</ref>

Early Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970 to 1974 fluctuated, as Hütter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians during the preparations for and the recording of three albums and sporadic live appearances, including guitarist [[Michael Rother]] and drummer [[Klaus Dinger]], who left to form [[Neu!]].<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} The only constant figure in these line-ups was Schneider, whose main instrument at the time was the flute; at times he also played the violin and guitar, all processed through a varied array of electronic devices. Hütter, who left the band for eight months to focus on completing his university studies, played synthesizer and keyboards (including Farfisa organ and electric piano).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

The band released two free-form experimental rock albums, ''[[Kraftwerk (album)|Kraftwerk]]'' (1970) and ''[[Kraftwerk 2]]'' (1972). The albums were mostly exploratory musical improvisations played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, organ, flute, and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Both albums are purely instrumental. Live performances from 1972 to 1973 were mostly made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic [[drum machine]] with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. Occasionally, they performed with bass players as well. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} Later in 1973, [[Wolfgang Flür]] joined the group for rehearsals, and the unit performed as a trio on the television show ''Aspekte'' for German television network [[ZDF]].<ref name="iwasarobot">{{cite book |last=Flür |first=Wolfgang |author-link=Wolfgang Flür |title="Kraftwerk": I Was A Robot |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=1993 |isbn=978-1-86074-417-4}}</ref>

With ''[[Ralf und Florian]]'', released in 1973, Kraftwerk began to rely more heavily on synthesizers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the [[vocoder]], which became one of its musical signatures. According to English music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]], Kraftwerk were influenced by what he called the "adrenalized insurgency" of Detroit artists of the late '60s [[MC5]] and [[the Stooges]].<ref name="Reynolds">{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Reynolds |author-link=Simon Reynolds |title=Generation Ecstasy: into the world of techno and rave culture |publisher=Routledge |year=1999}}</ref>

The input, expertise, and influence of producer and engineer [[Conny Plank|Konrad "Conny" Plank]] was highly significant in the early years of Kraftwerk. Plank also worked with many of the other leading German electronic acts of that time, including members of [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Neu!]], [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], and [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]]. As a result of his work with Kraftwerk, Plank's studio near [[Cologne]] became one of the most sought-after studios in the late 1970s. Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}}

=== International breakthrough: ''Autobahn'' and ''Radioactivity'' (1974–1976) ===

}}

The release of ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' in 1974 saw Kraftwerk moving away from the sound of its first three albums. Hütter and Schneider had invested in newer technology such as the [[Minimoog]] and the [[EMS Synthi AKS]], helping give Kraftwerk a newer, "disciplined" sound. ''Autobahn'' was also the last album that [[Conny Plank]] engineered. After the commercial success of ''Autobahn'' in the US, where it peaked at number 5 in the [[Billboard 200|Billboard Top LPs & Tapes]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kraftwerk-p4706/charts-awards/billboard-albums |title=allmusic ((( Kraftwerk > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums ))) |website=AllMusic |access-date=9 July 2009}}</ref> Hütter and Schneider invested in updating their studio, thus lessening their reliance on outside producers. At this time the painter and graphic artist [[Emil Schult]] became a regular collaborator, designing artwork, cowriting lyrics, and accompanying the group on tour.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}}

The year 1975 saw a turning point in Kraftwerk's live shows. With financial support from [[Phonogram Inc.]], in the US, they were able to undertake a tour to promote the ''Autobahn'' album, a tour which took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time. The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up in the form of a quartet. Hütter and Schneider continued playing keyboard synthesizers such as the [[Minimoog]] and [[ARP Odyssey]], with Schneider's use of flute diminishing. The two men started singing live for the first time, and Schneider processing his voice with a vocoder live. Wolfgang Flür and new recruit [[Karl Bartos]] performed on home-made electronic percussion instruments. Bartos also used a Deagan [[vibraphone]] on stage. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk. Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}}

After the 1975 ''Autobahn'' tour, Kraftwerk began work on a follow-up album, ''[[Radio-Activity]]'' (German title: ''Radio-Aktivität''). After further investment in new equipment, the [[Kling Klang Studio]] became a fully working recording studio. The group used the central theme in radio communication, which had become enhanced on their last tour of the United States. With Emil Schult working on artwork and lyrics, Kraftwerk began to compose music for the new record. Even though ''Radio-Activity'' was less commercially successful than ''Autobahn'' in the UK and United States, the album served to open up the European market for Kraftwerk, earning them a [[gold disc]] in France. Kraftwerk made videos and performed several European live dates to promote the album. With the release of ''Autobahn'' and ''Radio-Activity'', Kraftwerk left behind avant-garde experimentation and moved towards the electronic pop tunes for which they are best known.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}}

In 1976, Kraftwerk toured in support of the ''Radio-Activity'' album. [[David Bowie]] was among the fans of the record and invited the band to support him on his ''[[Station to Station]]'' tour, an offer the group declined.<ref>[[Richard Witts|Witts, Richard]]. "Vorsprung durch Technik ? Kraftwerk and the British Fixation with Germany". reproduced in "Kraftwerk: Music Non-Stop".  Continuum Books 2012</ref> Despite some innovations in touring, Kraftwerk took a break from live performances after the ''Radio-Activity'' tour of 1976.

=== ''Trans-Europe Express'', ''The Man-Machine'' and ''Computer World'' (1977–1982) ===
After having finished the Radio-Activity tour Kraftwerk began recording ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' (German: ''Trans-Europa Express'') at the Kling Klang Studio.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} ''Trans-Europe Express'' was mixed at the [[Record Plant|Record Plant Studios]] in Los Angeles. It was around this time that Hütter and Schneider met David Bowie at the Kling Klang Studio. A collaboration was mentioned in an interview ([[Brian Eno]]) with Hütter, but it never materialised. The release of ''Trans-Europe Express''  in March 1977<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} was marked with an extravagant train journey used as a press conference by EMI France.  The album won a disco award in New York later that year.

In May 1978 Kraftwerk released ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' (German: ''Die Mensch-Maschine''), recorded at the Kling Klang Studio. Due to the complexity of the recording, the album was mixed at Studio Rudas in Düsseldorf. The band hired sound engineer Leanard Jackson from Detroit to work with Joschko Rudas on the final mix. ''The Man-Machine'' was the first Kraftwerk album where [[Karl Bartos]] was cocredited as a songwriter. The cover, produced in black, white and red, was inspired by Russian artist [[El Lissitzky]] and the [[Suprematism]] movement. Gunther Frohling photographed the group for the cover, a now-iconic image which featured the quartet dressed in red shirts and black ties. After it was released Kraftwerk did not release another album for three years.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}}

In May 1981 Kraftwerk released ''[[Computer World]]'' (German: ''Computerwelt'') on [[EMI Records]].<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} It was recorded at Kling Klang Studio between 1978 and 1981.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} Much of this time was spent modifying the studio to make it portable so the band could take it on tour.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} Some of the electronic vocals on ''Computer World'' were generated using a [[Texas Instruments]] language translator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.datamath.org/Speech/LanguageTranslator.htm |title=Datamath |publisher=Datamath |date=5 December 2001 |access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref> "[[Computer Love (Kraftwerk song)|Computer Love]]" was released as a single backed with the ''Man-Machine'' track "[[Das Model|The Model]]".<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}}  Radio DJs were more interested in the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] so the single was repackaged by EMI and re-released with "The Model" as the A-side. The single reached number one in the UK, making "The Model" Kraftwerk's most successful song in that country.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} As a result, the ''Man-Machine'' album also became a success in the UK, peaking at number 9 in the [[UK albums chart|album chart]] in February 1982.<ref name="uk chart">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/kraftwerk/#albums |title=Kraftwerk albums Chart |website=Officialcharts.com |access-date=8 August 2013}}</ref> The band's live set focused increasingly on song-based material, with greater use of vocals and the use of sequencing equipment for both percussion and music. In contrast to their cool and controlled image, the group used sequencers interactively, which allowed for live improvisation. Ironically Kraftwerk did not own a computer at the time of recording ''Computer World''.

Kraftwerk returned to live performance with the ''Computer World'' tour of 1981, where the band effectively packed up its entire Kling Klang studio and took it along on the road. They also made greater use of live visuals including back-projected slides and films synchronized with the music as the technology developed, the use of hand-held miniaturized instruments during the set (for example, during "Pocket Calculator"), and, perhaps most famously, the use of replica [[mannequin]]s of themselves to perform on stage during the song "The Robots".

=== ''Electric Café'' (1982–1989) ===
In 1982 Kraftwerk began to work on a new album that initially had the working title ''[[Technicolor]]'' but due to trademark issues was changed to ''[[Electric Café]]'' for its original release in 1986 (for a remastered re-release in 2009, it was retitled again after its original working title, ''[[Techno Pop]]''). One of the songs from these recording sessions was "[[Tour de France (song)|Tour de France]]", which EMI released as a single in 1983. This song was a reflection of the band's new-found obsession for cycling. After the physically demanding ''Computer World'' tour, Ralf Hütter had been looking for forms of exercise that fitted in with the image of Kraftwerk; subsequently he encouraged the group to become vegetarians and take up cycling. "Tour de France" included sounds that followed this theme including bicycle chains, gear mechanisms and the breathing of the cyclist. At the time of the single's release Ralf Hütter tried to persuade the rest of the band that they should record a whole album based on cycling. The other members of the band were not convinced, and the theme was left to the single alone.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} "Tour de France" was released in German and French. The vocals of the song were recorded on the Kling Klang Studio stairs to create the right atmosphere.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} "Tour de France" was featured in the 1984 film ''[[Breakin']]'', showing the influence that Kraftwerk had on black American dance music.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}}

In May or June 1982,<ref>[[Karl Bartos]] 2017, ''Der Klang der Maschine'', ch. 12</ref> during the recording of "Tour de France", Ralf Hütter was involved in a serious cycling accident.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}} He suffered head injuries and remained in a coma for several days. During 1983 Wolfgang Flür was beginning to spend less time in the studio. Since the band began using sequencers his role as a drummer was becoming less frequent. He preferred to spend his time travelling with his girlfriend. Flür was also experiencing artistic difficulties with the band. Though he toured the world with Kraftwerk as a drummer in 1981, his playing does not appear on that year's ''Computer World'' or on the 1986 album ''Electric Café''. In 1987 he left the band and was replaced by [[Fritz Hilpert]].

=== ''The Mix'' (1990–1999) ===
After years of withdrawal from live performance Kraftwerk began to tour Europe more frequently. In February 1990 the band played a few secret shows in Italy. Karl Bartos left the band shortly afterwards. The next proper tour was in 1991, for the album ''[[The Mix (Kraftwerk album)|The Mix]]''. Hütter and Schneider wished to continue the synth-pop quartet style of presentation, and recruited [[Fernando Abrantes]] as a replacement for Bartos. Abrantes left the band shortly after though. In late 1991, long-time Kling Klang Studio sound engineer Henning Schmitz was brought in to finish the remainder of the tour and to complete a new version of the quartet that remained active until 2008.

In 1997 Kraftwerk made a famous appearance at the dance festival [[Tribal Gathering]] held in England.<ref>[http://www.physicsroom.org.nz/2cents/kraftwerk.htm 2 Cents: Kraftwerk, Tribal Gathering] (25 May 1997).</ref> In 1998, the group toured the US and Japan for the first time since 1981, along with shows in [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]].

In July 1999 the single "Tour de France" was reissued in Europe by EMI after it had been [[out of print]] for several years. It was released for the first time on CD in addition to a repressing of the 12-inch vinyl single. Both versions feature slightly altered artwork that removed the faces of Flür and Bartos from the four-man cycling paceline depicted on the original cover. In 1999 ex-member Flür published his autobiography in Germany, ''Ich war ein Roboter''. Later English-language editions of the book were titled ''Kraftwerk: I Was a Robot''.

In 1999, Kraftwerk were commissioned to create an [[a cappella]] [[jingle]] for the [[Hannover]] [[Expo 2000]] [[world's fair]] in [[Germany]]. The jingle was subsequently developed into the single "[[Expo 2000 (song)|Expo 2000]]", which was released in December 1999, and remixed and re-released as "Expo Remix" in November 2000.

=== ''Tour de France Soundtracks'' and touring the world (2000–2009) ===
[[File:Kraftwerk live in Stockholm.jpg|thumb|In [[Stockholm]], February 2004]]
In August 2003 the band released ''[[Tour de France Soundtracks]]'', its first album of new material since 1986's ''Electric Café''. In January and February 2003, before the release of the album, the band started the extensive ''Minimum-Maximum'' world tour, using four customised [[Sony]] [[VAIO]] laptop computers, effectively leaving the entire Kling Klang studio at home in Germany. The group also obtained a new set of transparent video panels to replace its four large projection screens. This greatly streamlined the running of all of the group's sequencing, sound-generating, and visual-display software. From this point, the band's equipment increasingly reduced manual playing, replacing it with interactive control of sequencing equipment. Hütter retained the most manual performance, still playing musical lines by hand on a controller keyboard and singing live vocals and having a repeating [[ostinato]]. Schneider's live vocoding had been replaced by software-controlled speech-synthesis techniques. In November, the group made a surprising appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, performing "Aerodynamik". The same year a promotional box set entitled ''12345678'' (subtitled ''The Catalogue'') was issued, with plans for a proper commercial release to follow.  The box featured [[Audio mastering|remastered]] editions of the group's eight core studio albums, from ''Autobahn'' to ''Tour de France Soundtracks''. This long-awaited box-set was eventually released in a different set of remasters in November 2009.

In June 2005 the band's first-ever official live album, ''[[Minimum-Maximum]]'', which was compiled from the shows during the band's tour of spring 2004, received extremely positive reviews.<ref name="taylor">Tony Naylor. [https://www.nme.com/reviews/kraftwerk/7663 "Kraftwerk: Minimum-Maximum Live"]. ''[[NME]]'', 2 June 2005. Retrieved 8 August 2013</ref> The album contained reworked tracks from existing studio albums. This included a track titled "Planet of Visions" that was a reworking of "Expo 2000". In support of this release, Kraftwerk made another quick sweep around the Balkans with dates in [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Turkey]], and Greece. In December, the [[Minimum-Maximum (video)|''Minimum-Maximum'' DVD]] was released. During 2006, the band performed at festivals in Norway, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Spain, Belgium, and Germany.

In April 2008 the group played three shows in US cities [[Minneapolis]], [[Milwaukee]], and [[Denver]], and were a coheadliner at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. This was their second appearance at the festival since 2004. Further shows were performed in Ireland, Poland, [[Ukraine]], Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore later that year. The touring quartet consisted of Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, [[Fritz Hilpert]], and video technician Stefan Pfaffe, who became an official member in 2008. Original member Florian Schneider was absent from the lineup. Hütter stated that he was working on other projects.<ref>{{cite news |first=Graham |last=Reid |title=Interview: Ralf Hutter of Kraftwerk |date=27 September 2008 |work=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10534357&pnum=0 |access-date=27 September 2008}}</ref> On 21 November, Kraftwerk officially confirmed Florian Schneider's departure from the band;<ref>{{cite news |author=Music |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/4144592/Kraftwerks-co-founder-Florian-Schneider-leaves-band.html |title=Kraftwerk's co-founder Florian Schneider leaves band |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 January 2009 |access-date=7 December 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' commented: "There is something brilliantly Kraftwerkian about the news that Florian Schneider, a founder member of the German electronic pioneers, is leaving the band to pursue a solo career.

In 2009, Kraftwerk performed concerts with special 3D background graphics in Wolfsburg, Germany; Manchester, UK; and Randers, Denmark.

Although not officially confirmed, Ralf Hütter suggested that a second boxed set of their first three experimental albums—''[[Kraftwerk (album)|Kraftwerk]]'', ''[[Kraftwerk 2]]'' and ''[[Ralf and Florian]]''—could be on its way, possibly seeing commercial release after their next studio album: "We've just never really taken a look at those albums. They've always been available, but as really bad [[bootleg recording|bootlegs]]. Now we have more artwork. [[Emil Schult|Emil]] has researched extra contemporary drawings, graphics, and photographs to go with each album, collections of paintings that we worked with, and drawings that Florian and I did. We took a lot of [[instant camera|Polaroids]] in those days."

Kraftwerk played at Ultra Music Festival in Miami on 23 March 2012. Initiated by [[Klaus Biesenbach]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]] of New York organized an exhibit titled ''Kraftwerk – Retrospective 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8'' where the band performed their studio discography from ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' to ''[[Tour de France Soundtracks|Tour de France]]'' over the course of eight days to sell-out crowds. The exhibit later toured to the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]] as well as to [https://www.kunstsammlung.de/en/home.html K21] in Düsseldorf. Kraftwerk performed at the No Nukes 2012 Festival in [[Tokyo, Japan]]. Kraftwerk were also going to play at the Ultra Music Festival in [[Warsaw]], but the event was cancelled; instead, Kraftwerk performed at Way Out West in [[Gothenburg]]. A limited edition version of the ''Catalogue'' box set was released during the retrospective, restricted to 2000 sets. Each box was individually numbered and inverted the colour scheme of the standard box. In December, Kraftwerk stated on their website that they would be playing their ''Catalogue'' in Düsseldorf and at London's Tate Modern. Kraftwerk tickets were priced at £60 in London, but fans compared that to the $20 ticket price for tickets at New York's MoMA in 2012, which caused consternation. Even so, the demand for the tickets at The Tate was so high that it shut down the website.

In March 2013, the band was not allowed to perform at a music festival in China due to unspecified "political reasons".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/29/kraftwerk-denied-festival-appearance-in-china Kraftwerk denied festival appearance in China].

In April 2017, Kraftwerk announced ''[[3-D The Catalogue]]'', a live album and video documenting performances of all eight albums in ''The Catalogue'' that was released 26 May 2017. It is available in multiple formats, the most extensive of which being a 4-disc [[Blu-ray]] set with a 236-page hardback book. The album was nominated for the [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album|Best Dance/Electronic Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album|Best Surround Sound Album]] at the ceremony that took place on 28 January 2018, winning the former, which became the band's first Grammy win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/40924|title=Kraftwerk and LCD Soundsystem among Grammy Awards 2018 winners|website=Resident Advisor}}</ref>

On 20 July 2018, at a concert in Stuttgart, German astronaut Alexander Gerst performed "Spacelab" with the band while aboard the [[International Space Station]], joining via a live video link. Gerst played melodies using a tablet as his instrument alongside Hütter as a duet, and delivered a short message to the audience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCQEzgtWv-E|title=Good evening, Kraftwerk / Guten Abend Kraftwerk, guten Abend Stuttgart!|access-date=23 June 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

They were influenced by the modernist [[Bauhaus]] aesthetic, seeing art as inseparable from everyday function.<ref name="ind" /> Usually, the lyrics are very [[Minimalist music|minimal]] but reveal both an innocent celebration of, and a knowing caution about, the modern world, as well as playing an integral role in the rhythmic structure of the songs. Many of Kraftwerk's songs express the paradoxical nature of modern urban life: a strong sense of alienation existing side by side with a celebration of the joys of modern technology.<ref>{{cite book |author=Barr, Tim |title=Kraftwerk: from Dusseldorf to the Future With Love |publisher=Ebury Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-09-186490-3}}</ref>

Starting with the release of ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'', Kraftwerk began to release a series of [[concept albums]] (''[[Radio-Activity]]'', ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'', ''[[The Man-Machine]]'', ''[[Computer World]]'', ''[[Tour de France Soundtracks]]'').<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSamDwAAQBAJ&q=kraftwerk+%22concept+albums%22&pg=PT147 |title=Kraftwerk: Future Music from Germany |last=Schütte |first=Uwe |date=27 February 2020 |isbn=9780241320556 |access-date=29 April 2020}}</ref> All of Kraftwerk's albums from ''Trans Europe Express'' onwards, except ''Tour de France Soundtracks'', have been released in separate versions: one with German vocals for sale in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and one with English vocals for the rest of the world, with occasional variations in other languages when conceptually appropriate. Live performance has always played an important part in Kraftwerk's activities. Also, despite its live shows generally being based around formal songs and compositions, live [[improvisation]] often plays a noticeable role in its performances. This trait can be traced back to the group's roots in the first experimental Krautrock scene of the late 1960s, but, significantly, it has continued to be a part of its playing even as it makes ever greater use of digital and computer-controlled sequencing in its performances. Some of the band's familiar compositions have been observed to have developed from live improvisations at its concerts or sound-checks.<ref>{{citation |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/preview+behind+kraftwerk+machines/11360476/story.html |title=The man behind Kraftwerk's machines |author=Sperounes, Sandra |work=Edmon Journal |date=14 September 2015 |access-date=28 October 2016}}</ref>

=== Technological innovations ===
Throughout their career, Kraftwerk have pushed the limits of [[music technology]] with some notable innovations, such as home-made instruments and custom-built devices. The group has always perceived their Kling Klang Studio as a complex music instrument, as well as a sound laboratory; Florian Schneider in particular developed a fascination with music technology, with the result that the technical aspects of sound generation and recording gradually became his main fields of activity within the band.<ref name="Bussy" />{{page needed|date=April 2019}}  Alexei Monroe called Kraftwerk the "first successful artists to incorporate representations of industrial sounds into non-academic electronic music".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Monroe |first=Alexei |title=Interrogation Machine: Laibach and NSK |publisher=Cambridge: The MIT Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/interrogationmac0000monr/page/212 212] |year=2005 |isbn=0-262-63315-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/interrogationmac0000monr/page/212 }}</ref>
[[File:Kraftwerk Vocoder custom made in early1970s.JPG|thumb|Early 1970s vocoder, custom built for Kraftwerk]]

Kraftwerk used a custom-built [[vocoder]] on their albums ''Ralf und Florian'' and ''Autobahn''; the device was constructed by engineers P. Leunig and K. Obermayer of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Braunschweig.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kraftwerk Vocoder (Barth / Leunig) sold: $12,500 |url=http://www.sequencer.de/blog/?p=843 |website=Sequencer.de |access-date=14 December 2012 |date=25 June 2006}}</ref> Hütter and Schneider hold a patent for an [[electronic drum kit]] with sensor pads, filed in July 1975 and issued in June 1977.<ref name="aktivitaet-fanzine1" /> It must be hit with metal sticks, which are connected to the device to complete a circuit that triggers analog synthetic percussion sounds.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-zX6QkdQ30 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/D-zX6QkdQ30| archive-date=2021-10-30|title="Tomorrow's world" (1976 Tv performance) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=23 January 2008 |access-date=14 December 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The band first performed in public with this device in 1973, on the television program ''Aspekte'' (on the all-German channel [[ZDF|Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen]]), where it was played by Wolfgang Flür.<ref>Flür, Wolfgang (2001).

Routledge. 2013.</ref>

On the ''Radio-Activity'' tour in 1976 Kraftwerk tested out an experimental light-beam-activated drum cage allowing Flür to trigger electronic percussion through arm and hand movements. Unfortunately, the device did not work as planned, and it was quickly abandoned.<ref name="aktivitaet-fanzine1">{{cite web |url=http://www.aktivitaet-fanzine.com/10_kk0.html |title=Aktivitaet Online – Archive – General articles – Kling Klang: The Electronic Garden |website=Aktivitaet-fanzine.com |access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref> The same year Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider commissioned [[Bonn]]-based "Synthesizerstudio Bonn, Matten & Wiechers" to design and build the Synthanorma Sequenzer with Intervallomat, a 4×8 / 2×16 / 1×32 step-sequencer system with some features that commercial products couldn't provide at that time.<ref name="aktivitaet-fanzine1" /> The [[music sequencer]] was used by the band for the first time to control the electronic sources creating the rhythmic sound of the album ''Trans-Europe Express''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elektropolis.de/synthanorma.pdf|website=Elektropolis.de |title=Synthanorma Sequenzer – description by D. Matten |access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref>

Since 2002, Kraftwerk's live performances have been conducted with the use of virtual technology (i.e. software replicating and replacing original analogue or digital equipment). According to [[Fritz Hilpert]], "the mobility of music technology and the reliability of the notebooks and software have greatly simplified the realization of complex touring setups: we generate all sounds on the laptops in real time and manipulate them with controller maps. It takes almost no time to get our compact stage system set up for performance. [...] This way, we can bring our Kling-Klang Studio with us on stage. The physical light weight of our equipment also translates into an enormous ease of use when working with software synthesizers and sound processors. Every tool imaginable is within immediate reach or just a few mouse clicks away on the Internet."<ref>Interview: ''The Future Is Virtual – Music Tech Talk With Fritz Hilpert'', Sounds & Performance magazine, 2009</ref>

=== Reclusiveness and eccentricity ===
The band is notoriously reclusive, providing rare and enigmatic interviews, using life-size mannequins and robots to conduct official photo shoots, refusing to accept mail and not allowing visitors at the Kling Klang Studio, the precise location of which they used to keep secret.

Another notable example of this eccentric behavior was reported to [[Johnny Marr]] of [[the Smiths]] by Karl Bartos, who explained that anyone trying to contact the band for collaboration would be told the studio telephone did not have a ringer since, while recording, the band did not like to hear any kind of noise pollution. Instead, callers were instructed to phone the studio precisely at a certain time, whereupon the phone would be answered by Ralf Hütter, despite never hearing the phone ring.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ioyvLPs4Bc | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629180016/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ioyvLPs4Bc| archive-date=2012-06-29|title=Top 100 Albums: Kraftwerk Trans-Europe-Express commented by Johnny Marr and Mark Radcliffe |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=1 April 2007 |access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref>
