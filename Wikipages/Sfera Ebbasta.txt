==Biography==

=== First years ===
Sfera was born in the [[Milan]]ese town of [[Sesto San Giovanni]], but grew up in the neighbouring town of [[Cinisello Balsamo]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Lorenza|last=Sebasiani|date=30 March 2018|title=Sfera Ebbasta: "Sono il nuovo ragazzo della Via Gluck"|url=https://www.vanityfair.it/music/storie-music/2018/03/30/sfera-ebbasta-trap-canzoni-intervista-foto-concerti-tour|accessdate=20 January 2019|work=Vanity Fair|language=it}}</ref> His parents separated two years after his birth, and his father died when he was only 13. He dropped out of school at the age of 14.

===First song (2011–2013)===
The rapper began his musical activity by uploading videos on [[YouTube]] between 2010 and 2012 without any success.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.it/musica/interviste-musica/sfera-acab-intervista/313754/#Part4|title=Un bravo ragazzo in un brutto quartiere: intervista a Sfera Ebbasta|last=Italia|first=Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone Italia|access-date=22 June 2018|language=it-IT}}</ref> In this period he started getting into contact with producer Charlie Charles, met while trying to illegally enter in a [[Hip Hop TV]] concert in [[Milan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/it/article/rdpwnv/sfera-ebbasta-charlie-charles-intervista|title=Loro di Sfera Ebbasta non sanno niente|date=10 June 2015|work=Noisey|access-date=22 June 2018|language=it}}</ref> Thus, they formed the [[musical collective|collective]] Billion Headz Money Gang, better known by the acronym BHMG.

=== Collaborations and FAMO$O (2018-present) ===
After Rockstar, Sfera has collaborated with lot of Italian and non rappers in some tracks, without announcing a new album.

The first appareance as a featuring is on 22 May 2020 when Italian rapper DrefGold has released his second album ''Elo'', in which Sfera Ebbasta appears as a featuring in the single "Elegante". On 5 June the single "Miami" was released: it is the result of a collaboration with US rapper [[Ronny J]] and Argentinian rapper [[Khea]], while a week later it was the turn of "M'Manc", a single recorded with the producer Shablo and the Neapolitan rapper Geolier.

On 26 June Italian rapper [[Gué Pequeno]] released his seventh album ''[[Mr. Fini]]'', in which Sfera Ebbasta duets with him on the track "Immortale". Another collaboration occurs on 10 July when [[Mahmood (singer)|Mahmood]] released the single "[[Dorado (song)|Dorado]]", realized with Sfera Ebbasta himself and Colombian rapper [[Feid]]. Last collaboration is on 11 September, when Father son and spirit, the second studio album of the trap group FSK Satellite, is released and Sfera Ebbasta appears in the track "Soldi sulla carta".

Though, the album awaits and the hype grows day per day. After some silence (but announcing every time that he was making music and something new, without speak about it) at the beginning of October 2020 Sfera released on IG a teaser to announce the third studio album.

On the 13th of that month it announced the title, ''FAMO$O'' (Italian word for FAMOU$, with the S stylized as dollar symbol), and its tracklist, characterized for the first time ever by several important and relevant collaborations,  with names which are worldwide known as [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[Diplo]] and [[J Balvin]]. Curiously, the only Italian collaboration is with [[Marracash]] and [[Gué Pequeno]] in a track; the publication of the project is scheduled for 20 November 2020. Also involved in the project are some important producers as Steve Aoki, Diplo and [[London on da Track]]. Moreover, another curiosity will be represented in the last track "$€ Freestyle", because it will be the first track produced by Sfera himself.

Alongside the musical project Sfera released the documentary of the same name, exclusively on Prime Video, which shows some anecdotes of his musical growth and the making-of the new album.

On 28 October he released the first single "[[Bottiglie Privè]]", the unique which is produced by his producer [[Charlie Charles]], who is executive producer of the entire album.

With the release of ''FAMO$O'', a collaboration with the famous American fast food restaurant chain [[KFC]] has been announced.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sfera Ebbasta svela un'inedita collaborazione con KFC|url=https://soldoutservice.com/p/sfera-ebbasta-kfc-collaborazione|access-date=17 November 2020|website=SOLDOUTSERVICE|language=it}}</ref>

In July of 2021, his collaboration with Italian rapper Blanco titled "Mi fai impazzire" ("You drive me crazy") peaked at #1 on the Italian singles chart, giving him his 18th number one single,<ref>https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/1</ref> and was certified quadruple platinum by [[FIMI]].<ref>{{cite certification|region=Italy|id=8995|access-date=20 September 2021}}</ref>
