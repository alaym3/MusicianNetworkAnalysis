The band was formed in 2012 between friends Luke, Matt, Jade and Todd, after they relocated from Adelaide to Sydney. Soon after they released their debut EP, ''Embers''. 

In 2014, the band signed to [[Ivy League Records]], through which they released their second EP, ''Illumina''. Shortly after this, the band saw the arrival of Jennifer and the departure of Jade. The EP saw success on triple j, and the band won the Sydney slot for the 2015 [[Laneway Festival]] Unearthed competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://killyourstereo.com/news/1040915/laneway-festival-announces-unearthed-acts/|title=Laneway Festival announces Unearthed acts|publisher=Kill Your Stereo|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref>

In 2015, the lineup changed once again with the departure of Matt and the arrival of Rosie. Later in the year, the band released their third EP, ''Another Life''. The songs "Close Your Eyes", "Perfect Picture" and "Another Life" all received significant airplay on [[Triple J]]. The band released the singles "Rather Be Lonely" and "Let Go" in 2016 and 2017, respectively, with both singles also receiving strong airplay on triple j.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/user/triplejradio/library/music/I+Know+Leopard|title=triplejradio's Library|publisher=last.fm|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref>
