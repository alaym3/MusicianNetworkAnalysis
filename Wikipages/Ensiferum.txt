==Band history==
===Formation, demos and ''Ensiferum'' (1995−2002)===
''Ensiferum'' was founded in 1995 by [[Markus Toivonen]] ([[guitar]]), Sauli Savolainen (bass) and Kimmo Miettinen (drums). In the next year, [[Jari Mäenpää]] was taken into the band as singer and second guitar-player. In 1997, the first demo was released, containing three songs.

[[File:Ensiferum Rockharz 2016 23.jpg|thumb|Ex-accordionist Netta Skog at Rockharz 2016]]
In 1998, Savolainen and Miettinen left the band and were replaced by Jukka-Pekka Miettinen (Kimmo Miettinen's little brother, then 14 years old) and Oliver Fokin. In January 1999, a second demo was recorded, which although it did not produce a recording deal, boosted the band's confidence. In November 1999 a third demo ''Hero in a Dream'' was recorded, and was successful in obtaining a record deal with [[Spinefarm Records]]. The logo that appears on all the band's releases was designed for the third demo by Tuomas Tahvanainen, who also designed the logos for the earlier demos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensiferum.com/e_html/e_history.htm|title=Story of Ensiferum|website=Ensiferum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113121556/http://www.ensiferum.com/e_html/e_history.htm|archive-date=January 13, 2008|access-date=January 25, 2008}}</ref> In 2000, the band went into the studio to work on their first album, ''[[Ensiferum (album)|Ensiferum]]'', which was released in August 2001. In the same year, Meiju Enho joined them as a [[Synthesizer|keyboard]]-player.

===''Iron'', Line-up changes, ''Dragonheads'' and ''10th Anniversary Live'' (2003−2006)===
In 2004, after the work was completed on the second album, ''[[Iron (Ensiferum)|Iron]]'', Mäenpää left the band due to conflicts between scheduled studio work on his side project [[Wintersun]] and touring with Ensiferum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/wintersun.html|title=Wintersun interview|website=Tartarean Desire Webzine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011072155/https://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/wintersun.html|archive-date=October 11, 2017|access-date=November 30, 2019}}</ref> For the tour with [[Finntroll]], Petri Lindroos from [[Norther]] replaced Mäenpää on guitar and as singer, and became a member of the band after the tour. In December 2004, Jukka-Pekka Miettinen left the band and was replaced by Sami Hinkka ([[Rapture (band)|Rapture]]). Fokin also left in 2005 to be replaced by Janne Parviainen.

The new Ensiferum line-up entered the studio later that year to record an [[Extended play|EP]] to be called ''[[Dragonheads]]'', which was released in February 2006. As well as the title track, it also contained two reworked demo songs; an [[Amorphis]] cover and a short rendition of the [[Kalevala]] melody, as well as a medley of three traditional [[Finland|Finnish]] songs.

In June 2006, Ensiferum released their live [[DVD]], ''[[10th Anniversary Live]]'', which was recorded in [[Nosturi]], [[Helsinki]], on 31 December 2005.

===''Victory Songs'' and Meiju's departure (2006−2009)===
The recording of the third studio album, called ''[[Victory Songs]]'', took place between November 2006 and early 2007, and was released on 20 April 2007. A single titled "[[One More Magic Potion]]" (after the track of the same name) was released on 7 February. Following the album's release, the band released through the producer's [[MySpace]] page, a music video for the song "Ahti," which included all band members featured as extras. The video was released after the album release due to video filming problems.

On 10 September 2007, it was announced that keyboardist [[Meiju Enho]] would leave the band. This was posted in a bulletin on their MySpace page and later confirmed on their website. The band used [[Emmi Silvennoinen]] of [[Exsecratus]] as a touring fill-in. Silvennoinen later became a permanent member of the band during the recording of the ''From Afar'' album.<ref name="past" /><ref name="future">{{cite web|url=http://www.ensiferum.com/e_html/e_news.htm|title=Ensiferum — Latest News|website=Ensiferum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104082210/http://ensiferum.com/e_html/e_news.htm|archive-date=January 4, 2010|access-date=August 17, 2009}}</ref>

Shortly before their Russian tour in 2008, Lindroos fell "seriously ill" and was unable to participate. The band hired ex-bassist Jukka-Pekka Miettinen to assume Lindroos' guitar duties, while bassist Sami Hinkka took over his lead vocal duties for the tour.

In the first half of 2009, Ensiferum performed at a string of [[metal festival|festivals]] including Frostrock in [[Belgium]], [[Finnish Metal Expo]] and [[Tuska Open Air]] in [[Finland]], Winterfire, Rocktower, Legacy and Rock am Härtsfeldsee in [[Germany]], Summer Nights in [[Austria]], and Z7 Metal Dayz in [[Switzerland]].<ref name="past" /> In June and July they toured North America as part of the [[Summer Slaughter Tour]] with [[Necrophagist]], [[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]], [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]], [[Blackguard (band)|Blackguard]], [[Dying Fetus]], [[Beneath the Massacre]], [[Origin (band)|Origin]], and [[Winds of Plague]].<ref name="past" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensiferum.com/e_html/e_tourinfo.htm|title=Ensiferum — Future concerts|website=Ensiferum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418060737/http://ensiferum.com/e_html/e_tourinfo.htm|archive-date=April 18, 2009|access-date=July 2, 2009}}</ref> In August they performed at the Global East Rock Festival in [[Ukraine]], [[Ankkarock]] and Jurassic Rock in [[Finland]], and Let's Open Air in [[Turkey]].<ref name="future" />

=== ''From Afar'' and ''Unsung Heroes'' (2009−2012) ===
Ensiferum released their fourth studio album, ''[[From Afar (album)|From Afar]]'', on 9 September 2009 with [[Spinefarm Records]]. The album was produced by [[Nightwish]] producer [[Tero Kinnunen]] and ''[[Victory Songs]]'' producer Janne Joutsenniemi, and it was mixed by producer [[Hiili Hiilesmaa]].<ref name="news">{{cite web|url=http://www.ensiferum.com/e_html/e_news.htm|title=Ensiferum — News|website=Ensiferum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104082210/http://ensiferum.com/e_html/e_news.htm|archive-date=January 4, 2010|access-date=July 2, 2009}}</ref> The limited edition of the album includes a cover of [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[folk rock]] group [[Nordman]] with guest vocalist [[Heri Joensen]] of Faroese band [[Týr (band)|Týr]].<ref name="from-afar">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122903|title=Ensiferum: new album title, track listing revealed|date=July 1, 2009|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=July 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703130022/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122903|archive-date=July 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjpfdN8NX5E|title=Ensiferum Interview With Peter Lindroos @ Ankkarock 2009|date=August 16, 2009|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=November 30, 2019}}</ref> Following the release, the group embarked on a European tour with [[Estonia]]n [[folk metal]] band [[Metsatöll]] and [[Finland|Finnish]] [[melodic death metal]] band [[Tracedawn]].<ref name="future" /><ref name="news" /><ref name="from-afar" /> In October they performed at Hellflame Festival – The South Side of Hell and Devil's Revenge festival in [[Germany]], and Tattoo the Mind in [[France]].<ref name="future" /> Ensiferum performed on the second day of the inaugural Screamfest Festival in Sydney, Australia, on New Years Day 2010. In November/December they toured North America with [[Ex Deo]] (on selected dates), and Blackguard.

Ensiferum were also confirmed to play [[Bloodstock Open Air]] at Catton Hall, United Kingdom in 2010. In October 2010, Ensiferum embarked on their first ever South African tour. This tour consisted of four shows in two cities, and they were accompanied by numerous local metal bands including [[Riddare av Koden]], Empery and All Forlorn. The final show, at The Black Dahlia in Johannesburg, was filmed to potentially appear on their next live DVD. In early 2011 Ensiferum embarked on [[The Ugly World Tour 2011]] with labelmates [[Children of Bodom]], [[Amon Amarth]], [[Machinae Supremacy]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} supporting them for segments of their tour in the US and Canada. The tour took place within a 4-month period of time and spanned 23 countries.

The band's fifth studio album, ''[[Unsung Heroes (Ensiferum album)|Unsung Heroes]]'', was released on 24 August 2012. It's also their final album for Spinefarm Records. The next year, Ensiferum signed with [[Metal Blade Records]] after thirteen years with their previous label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalblade.com/us/news/ensiferum-sign-to-metal-blade-records/|title=ENSIFERUM sign worldwide deal with Metal Blade Records|date=April 24, 2013|website=[[Metal Blade Records]]|access-date=January 1, 2018}}</ref> After release of the album, Ensiferum embarked on a tour of Europe and South America.

=== New Label, ''One Man Army'', and ''Two Paths'' (2013−2019) ===
Ensiferum's sixth album, ''[[One Man Army (Ensiferum album)|One Man Army]]'', was released on 20 February 2015. The album was recorded at Astia Studio with producer [[Anssi Kippo]]. A music video for the title track "One Man Army" was released prior to the album's release. In March of that year, Ensiferum announced on their Facebook page that keyboardist Emmi Silvennoinen would not be able to make the European and North American "One Man Army Tour" due to personal commitments at home. Former [[Turisas]] accordion player Netta Skog filled her role for the tour. Skog had performed clean vocals on the ''One Man Army'' songs "Cry for the Earth Bounds" and "Neito Pohjolan". [[Heri Joensen]] of [[Týr (band)|Týr]] makes an appearance on the track "Heathen Horde", quoting stanza 16 of ''Hávamál'' in Old Icelandic.

On 31 March 2016 it was announced that Emmi Silvennoinen would take a leave of absence from the band because of personal issues. Netta Skog was confirmed as her permanent replacement. With Skog in the line-up, the band entered the studio to record their seventh studio album, ''[[Two Paths (album)|Two Paths]]''. Anssi Kippo, who had produced ''One Man Army'', was again chosen to produce the album. The band focused on a more "organic" sound for ''Two Paths'', using [[analog recording]] and neglecting to use a [[click track]] for certain songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensiferum.com/band/|title=Band – Ensiferum|website=Ensiferum|access-date=January 1, 2018}}</ref> ''Two Paths'' was released on 15 September 2017.

Skog left the band in December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Ensiferum/posts/10155249567326309|title=NETTA SKOG TO LEAVE ENSIFERUM|date=December 21, 2017|website=[[Facebook]]|access-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref>
