'''Omnium Gatherum''' is a five-piece [[melodic death metal]] band from [[Finland]], founded in the autumn of 1996. Although the band mainly follows the path of the [[melodic death metal]] genre, much of their work shows strong influences from [[progressive metal]], especially their later albums.

Their fine blend of melody and aggression is so good I actually thought about stealing the record and releasing it as my own :) You won´t find a better album in years."<ref name="Official Website"/>

In August 2010, Omnium Gatherum announced that they had signed a deal with Lifeforce Records for their next release, and that their longtime rhythm guitarist Harri Pikka had left the band. Their official statement read "We're really sorry to announce also that Harri Pikka has silently decided to flee the OG crew after 13 years of solid service. We don't know his exact reasons for this but maybe someday mr. Mystery Man tells us… :) At the moment we've decided to finish the new album as a 5-piece unit, but we have the best possible live guitar unit called Joonas Koto (Malpractice / Ex-To/Die/For / Ex-Hateframe) filling the second guitar live duties at the moment and it rocks!"   Omnium Gatherum entered the studio to record their fifth studio album for an early 2011 release.  Lead guitarist Markus Vanhala handled all guitar parts for the recording. Mixing and mastering were handled by Dan Swano.<ref name="Official Website"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=33396841&blogId=538308734 |title=Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=2013-11-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=2009-02-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=33396841&blogId=538308689 |title=Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=2013-11-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=2009-02-07 }}</ref>

The vocal styles vary from deep death growls to clean vocals. The sound of the album is epic and progressive.
