Cooke was born in [[Mississippi]] and later relocated to [[Chicago]] with his family at a young age, where he began singing as a child and joined [[the Soul Stirrers]] as lead singer in the 1950s. Going solo in 1957, Cooke released a string of hit songs, including "[[You Send Me]]", "[[A Change Is Gonna Come]]", "[[Cupid (Sam Cooke song)|Cupid]]", "[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]", "[[Chain Gang (song)|Chain Gang]]", "[[Twistin' the Night Away]]", "[[Bring It On Home to Me]]", and "[[Good Times (Sam Cooke song)|Good Times]]". During his eight-year career, Cooke released 29 singles that charted in the [[Top 40]] of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles]] chart, as well as 20 singles in the Top Ten of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks|Black Singles]] chart.

In 1964, Cooke was shot and killed by the manager of a motel in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="mofmotl">{{Cite news |date=December 12, 1964 |title=Manager of motel shoots singing star |page=10 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |agency=Associated Press |location=(Idaho) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TXxfAAAAIBAJ&pg=6334%2C1996941}}</ref> After an inquest and investigation, the courts ruled Cooke's death to be a [[justifiable homicide]];<ref name="bookofhits">{{Cite book |last=Bronson |first=Fred |title=The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits: The Inside Story Behind Every Number One Single on Billboard's Hot 100 from 1955 to the Present |publisher=Billboard Books |year=2003 |isbn=0-8230-7677-6 |page=30}}</ref> his family has since questioned the circumstances of his death.

Cooke was also a central part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], using his influence and popularity with the white and black population to fight for the cause. He was good friends with boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], activist [[Malcolm X]] and football player [[Jim Brown]], who together campaigned for racial equality.

==Early life==
<!-- Listing birth name as Samuel Cook for consistency with the previous reference, although Guralick's book Dream Boogie gives his name as Samuel Cook -->
Cooke was born Samuel Cook in [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]], in 1931 (he added the "e" to his last name in 1957 to signify a new start to his life).<ref name="Guralnick">{{Cite book |last=Guralnick |first=Peter |url=https://archive.org/details/dreamboogietrium00gura/page/9 |title=Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-316-37794-5 |author-link=Peter Guralnick}}</ref><ref>Note: His headstone gives his birth year as 1930.</ref> He was the fifth of eight children of the Rev.

The family moved to Chicago in 1933.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=10}} Cook attended Doolittle Elementary and [[Wendell Phillips Academy High School]]{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=15, 22}} in Chicago, the same school that [[Nat "King" Cole]] had attended a few years earlier. Cooke began his career with his siblings in a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=13–14}} He first became known as lead singer with [[the Highway Q.C.'s]] when he was a teenager, having joined the group at the age of 14.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=29–31}} During this time, Cooke befriended fellow gospel singer and neighbor [[Lou Rawls]], who sang in a rival gospel group.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=90}}

==Career==
===The Soul Stirrers===
{{main|The Soul Stirrers}}
In 1950, Cooke replaced gospel tenor [[R. H. Harris]] as lead singer of the gospel group [[the Soul Stirrers]], founded by Harris, who had signed with [[Specialty Records]] on behalf of the group.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=65–68}} Their first recording under Cooke's leadership was the song "Jesus Gave Me Water" in 1951. They also recorded the gospel songs "[[Peace in the Valley]]", "How Far Am I from Canaan?", "Jesus Paid the Debt" and "One More River", among many others, some of which he wrote.<ref name="songsofsamcooke.com">{{Cite web |date=March 1, 1951 |title=Jesus Gave Me Water |url=http://songsofsamcooke.com/soulstirrers/jesus_gave_me_water.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130216192534/http://songsofsamcooke.com/soulstirrers/jesus_gave_me_water.htm |archive-date=February 16, 2013 |access-date=February 13, 2013 |publisher=Songsofsamcooke.com}}</ref> Cooke was often credited for bringing gospel music to the attention of a younger crowd of listeners, mainly girls who would rush to the stage when the Soul Stirrers hit the stage just to get a glimpse of Cooke.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=47}}

''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s 2015 list of "the 35 Greatest R&B Artists Of All Time" includes Cooke, "who broke ground in 1957 with the R&B/pop crossover hit "You Send Me" ...

===Crossover pop success===
Cooke had 30 U.S. top 40 hits between 1957 and 1964, plus three more posthumously. Major hits like "[[You Send Me]]", "[[A Change Is Gonna Come]]", "[[Cupid (Sam Cooke song)|Cupid]]", "[[Chain Gang (song)|Chain Gang]]", "[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]", "[[Another Saturday Night]]", and "[[Twistin' the Night Away]]" are some of his most popular songs.

[[File:Sam Cooke billboard.jpg|thumb|left|Cooke in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 1965, released posthumously]]
His first pop/soul single was "Lovable" (1956), a remake of the gospel song "Wonderful". It was released under the [[pseudonym|alias]] "Dale Cook"<ref name="pc17">{{Cite web |date=June 22, 1969 |title=Show 17 – The Soul Reformation: More on the evolution of rhythm and blues |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19767/m1 |access-date=September 22, 2010 |website=[[Pop Chronicles]] |publisher=Digital Library, University of North Texas}}</ref> in order not to alienate his gospel fan base; there was a considerable stigma against gospel singers performing secular music. However, it fooled no one<ref name=bookofhits />—Cooke's unique and distinctive vocals were easily recognized. [[Art Rupe]], head of Specialty Records, the label of the Soul Stirrers, gave his blessing for Cooke to record secular music under his real name, but he was unhappy about the type of music Cooke and producer [[Bumps Blackwell]] were making. Rupe expected Cooke's secular music to be similar to that of another Specialty Records artist, [[Little Richard]]. When Rupe walked in on a recording session and heard Cooke covering [[Gershwin]], he was quite upset. After an argument between Rupe and Blackwell, Cooke and Blackwell left the label.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=171–180}} "Lovable" was never a hit, but neither did it flop, and indicated Cooke's future potential. While gospel was popular, Cooke saw that fans were mostly limited to low-income, rural parts of the country, and sought to branch out. Cooke later admitted he got an endorsement for a career in pop music from the least likely man, his pastor father. "My father told me it was not what I sang that was important, but that God gave me a voice and musical talent and the true use of His gift was to share it and make people happy." Taking the name "Sam Cooke", he sought a fresh start in pop.

In 1957, Cooke appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[The Guy Mitchell Show]]''. That same year, he signed with Keen Records. His first hit, "[[You Send Me]]," released as the B-side of "[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]],"<ref name=pc17/>{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=167}} spent six weeks at No. 1 on the [[List of No. 1 R&B hits (United States)|Billboard R&B chart]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sam Cooke |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/sam-cooke |access-date=October 10, 2017 |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref> The song also had mainstream success, spending three weeks at No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' pop]] chart.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dean |first=Maury |title=Rock 'N' Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-cyclopedia |publisher=Algora Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=0-87586-207-1 |page=176}}</ref> It elevated him from earning $200 a week to over $5,000 a week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://archive.org/details/variety209-1958-02/page/n1/mode/1up?view=theater|title=Sam Cooke Finds Single Click Leads to Big Payoff On One-Nighters, Video|date=February 5, 1958|page=2|via=[[Archive.org]]|access-date=September 25, 2021}}</ref>

In 1958, Cooke performed for the famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.|Leon Hefflin Sr.]] held at the Shrine Auditorium on August 3. The other headliners were [[Little Willie John]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Ernie Freeman]], and [[Bo Rhambo]]. [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] was there to crown the winner of the Miss Cavalcade of Jazz beauty contest. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockeys of Los Angeles.<ref name="Guralnick" />

Cooke signed with the [[RCA Victor]] record label in January 1960, having been offered a guaranteed $100,000 ({{Inflation|US|100000|1960|r=-4|fmt=eq}}) by the label's producers [[Hugo & Luigi]].<ref name="BbJan60">{{Cite magazine |date=January 18, 1960 |title=Sam Cooke Signs With Hugo-Luigi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4x4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="CBJan60">{{Cite magazine |date=January 23, 1960 |title=RCA Victor Signs Sam Cooke |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Cash-Box-IDX/60s/1960/CB-1960-01-23-OCR-Page-0052.pdf |magazine=[[Cash Box (magazine)|Cash Box]] |location=New York |access-date=2 May 2020}}</ref> One of his first RCA Victor singles was "[[Chain Gang (song)|Chain Gang]]", which reached No. 2 on the Billboard pop chart.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=338}} It was followed by more hits, including "Sad Mood",{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=348, 361}} "[[Cupid (Sam Cooke song)|Cupid]]",{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=362}} "[[Bring It On Home to Me]]" (with [[Lou Rawls]] on backing vocals),{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=404–407}} "[[Another Saturday Night]]",{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=460}} and "[[Twistin' the Night Away]]".{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=390, 396}}

In 1961, Cooke started his own record label, [[SAR Records]], with [[J. W. Alexander (musician)|J. W.

Like most R&B artists of his time, Cooke focused on singles; in all, he had 29 top 40 hits on the pop charts and more on the R&B charts. He was a prolific songwriter and wrote most of the songs he recorded. He also had a hand in overseeing some of the song arrangements. In spite of releasing mostly singles, he released a well-received [[blues music|blues]]-inflected LP in 1963, ''[[Night Beat (Sam Cooke album)|Night Beat]]'', and his most critically acclaimed studio album, ''[[Ain't That Good News (album)|Ain't That Good News]]'', which featured five singles, in 1964.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sam Cooke – Billboard Charts |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/sam-cooke |access-date=January 3, 2019 |website=2019 Billboard}}</ref>

In 1963, Cooke signed a five-year contract for [[Allen Klein]] to manage Kags Music and SAR Records and made him his manager. Klein negotiated a five-year deal (three years plus two option years) with RCA Victor in which a holding company, Tracey, Ltd, named after Cooke's daughter, owned by Klein and managed by J. W. Alexander, would produce and own Cooke's recordings. RCA Victor would get exclusive distribution rights in exchange for 6 percent royalty payments and payments for the recording sessions. For tax reasons, Cooke would receive preferred stock in Tracey instead of an initial cash advance of $100,000. Cooke would receive cash advances of $100,000 for the next two years, followed by an additional $75,000 for each of the two option years if the deal went to term.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=44–46}}

She said she then fired at Cooke in self-defense because she feared for her life. Cooke was struck once in the [[torso]]. According to Franklin, he exclaimed, "Lady, you shot me", in a tone that expressed perplexity rather than anger, before advancing on her again. She said she hit him in the head with a broomstick before he finally fell to the floor and died.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 628}} A [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] was convened to investigate the incident.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=619, 627}}

Boyer told the police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She said that after they left a local nightclub together, she had repeatedly requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She said that once in one of the motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and then stripped her to her panties; she said she was sure he was going to [[rape]] her. Cooke allowed her to use the bathroom, from which she attempted an escape but found that the window was firmly shut. According to Boyer, she returned to the main room, where Cooke continued to molest her. When he went to use the bathroom, she quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She said that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long to respond, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothes back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called the police.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=616–619}}

Boyer's story is the only account of what happened between her and Cooke that night; however, her story has long been called into question. Inconsistencies between her version of events and details reported by diners at Martoni's Restaurant, where Cooke dined and drank earlier in the evening, suggest that Boyer may have gone willingly to the motel with Cooke, then slipped out of the room with his clothing to rob him, rather than to escape an attempted rape.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=643}}<ref name=Wolff /> Cooke was reportedly carrying a large amount of money at Martoni's, according to restaurant employees and friends. However, a search of Boyer's purse by police revealed nothing except a $20 bill, and a search of Cooke's [[Ferrari]] found only a money clip with $108 and a few loose coins.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Krajicek |first=David |title=The Death of Sam Cooke |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210053736/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/11.html |archive-date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=September 9, 2016 |website=CrimeLibrary.com}}</ref>

However, questions about Boyer's role were beyond the scope of the inquest, the purpose of which was only to establish the circumstances of Franklin's role in the shooting. Boyer's leaving the motel room with almost all of Cooke's clothing, and the fact that tests showed Cooke was inebriated at the time, provided a plausible explanation to the inquest jurors for Cooke's bizarre behavior and state of undress. In addition, because Carr's testimony [[Corroborating evidence|corroborated]] Franklin's version of events, and because both Boyer and Franklin later passed [[polygraph]] tests,<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=December 16, 1964 |title=Shooting of Sam Cooke Held 'Justifiable Homicide' |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[United Press International]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/12/17/archives/shooting-of-sam-cooke-held-justifiable-homicide.html}}</ref> the [[coroner's jury]] ultimately accepted Franklin's explanation and returned a verdict of [[justifiable homicide]].<ref name=bookofhits /> With that verdict, authorities officially closed the case on Cooke's death.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|pp=626–629}}

Some of Cooke's family and supporters, however, have rejected Boyer's version of events, as well as those given by Franklin and Carr. They believe that there was a [[conspiracy]] to murder Cooke and that the murder took place in some manner entirely different from the three official accounts.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Milicia |first=Joe |date=December 6, 2005 |title=Sam Cooke's story told from 'the inside out'—A thorough effort to give him his due |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-116060846.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105204309/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-116060846.html |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |quote=That he was killed after being scammed by a prostitute just didn't make sense to many people.
