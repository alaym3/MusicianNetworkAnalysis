'''Pascal Arbez-Nicolas''' ({{IPA-fr|paskal aʁbɛz nikɔla}}; born 18 May 1976), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Vitalic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|t|ə|l|ɪ|k}}), is a French [[electronic music]] [[record producer|producer]].

==History==
His first singles were released in 1996 and 1997, but were confined to underground electronic music scene.  However, he became good friends with techno producer [[The Hacker]], whom he met in Le Rex Club, the "techno temple" of [[Laurent Garnier]]. "The Hacker" suggested he should send his new tracks to [[DJ Hell]], head of [[International DeeJay Gigolo Records]] in [[Munich]]. Pascal did so, and International DeeJay Gigolo Records released the well known ''Poney EP'' in 2001, which was a huge success shortly after its release. With the track "La Rock 01", Vitalic created a club anthem which was a hit in the summer of 2001. The track was also included on many compilation albums, even rock compilations. [[Miss Kittin]] included "La Rock 01" on her DJ mix album ''[[On the Road (Miss Kittin album)|On the Road]]''.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web

In 2005, Vitalic's released his debut album, ''[[OK Cowboy]]'', on Different/[[PIAS Recordings]].  Pascal states that all of the instruments used in the album are [[synthesizer|synthesized]]. His official website states that "the only thing he can't fake is the emotion that galvanizes his music."

His song "Trahison" from ''OK Cowboy'' was used in the trailer for the 2007 French film ''[[Naissance des Pieuvres]]''. His song "Poney Part 1" was featured in the [[Pleix]] film ''Birds''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pleix.net/birds.html |title=Birds |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719140710/http://www.pleix.net/birds.html |archive-date=2011-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was announced by Festival Republic that Vitalic would be playing both the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK in August 2009.
