'''Ima Robot''' is an American band based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States, that formed in the late 1990s. They have released several albums, EPs, and singles, most notably ''[[Ima Robot (album)|Ima Robot]]'' in 2003, ''Search and Destroy'' and ''[[Monument to the Masses]]'' in 2006, and ''[[Another Man's Treasure]]'' in 2010. The band's song, "Greenback Boogie", a [[B-side]] to ''Another Man's Treasure'', is the main theme song of the [[USA Network]] legal drama series ''[[Suits (American TV series)|Suits]]''.

==History==
In the 1990s, singer/rapper [[Alex Ebert]] and guitarist Tim "Timmy the Terror" Anderson worked together under various names including 13's Lucky, The Window Club, and Eiffel Tower Window Masters before deciding on the band name Ima Robot. The phrase "Ima Robot" came from an inside joke between members of the band, which Ebert has stated "was something that we thought was really, really, really, really funny, and I can't, for the life of me, remember why"<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68477/ima-robot.|title = Ima Robot|magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> In 1997, the duo recruited keyboardist/bassist Oliver "Oligee" Goldstein. The trio would perform with various frequently changing members until they recruited drummer Rich Lambert in December 2000 and bassist [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]] in November 2001. The band recorded numerous untitled Demo CDs through the late 90's and early 2000's. In mid/late 2002, Ima Robot was signed to [[Virgin Records]]. As Ebert described the first thing Virgin Chairman/CEO said about the band: "The first thing [[Matt Serletic]] said was that seeing us was like seeing the Ramones for the first time, and that he felt this kind of energy that we needed to capture and not try to gloss and glean over.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68477/ima-robot|title = Ima Robot|magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>" Lambert was let go the day after the band was signed, and was replaced by studio drummer [[Joey Waronker]].

On September 16, 2003, Ima Robot released their first full-length [[album]], the self-titled ''[[Ima Robot (album)|Ima Robot]]''. The album featured the singles "Dynomite" and "Song #1" (released in the [[UK]] only).

In 2004, Waronker and "Oligee" left the band. Meldal-Johnsen followed in 2005, with former [[Oleander (band)|Oleander]] drummer [[Scott Devours]]. Tim Anderson's cousin, whom he had never met before Devours, auditioned and took over the drums. [[Filip Nikolic (Artist)|Filip Nikolic]] took over the bass and Andy Marlow started playing the keyboards. In the process of writing their second album, the band recorded the EP "Search and Destroy", which they released and distributed independently at shows starting on April 5, 2006.

On September 12, 2006, they released their second album ''[[Monument to the Masses]]'', which featured the singles "Creeps Me Out" and "Lovers in Captivity".

In April 2007, the band won their independence from [[Virgin Records]] and continued to work unsigned under the management of Alexis Rivera of Echo Park Records. The song "Gangster" premiered on the band's [[MySpace]] on April 15, 2008, with its lyrics posted in a blog entry by the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/artists/ima-robot/biography |title=Ima Robot Biography &#124; Ima Robot Bio & History |publisher=Xfm |access-date=2013-01-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315214626/http://www.xfm.co.uk/artists/ima-robot/biography |archive-date=2012-03-15 }}</ref> In 2010 the band announced the upcoming release of their new album, ''Another Man's Treasure'', and released the song "Ruthless" on the Internet.

Ebert remained frustrated with Virgin, saying in a 2016 interview with [[Transverso Media]] that, "pretty unironically I ended up feeling like a robot by the end of the process because of the major label thing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transversomedia.com/articles/edward-sharpe-and-the-magnetic-zeros-alex-ebert-new-interview-persona |title=Edward Sharpe Is Dead: Alex Ebert on The Magnetic Zeros' Pursuit of Failure, Identity, and Unrealism — TRANSVERSO |website=Transversomedia.com |date=2016-04-12 |access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> During that period, they were being represented by the Werewolf Heart label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imarobot.com/ |title=Another Man's Treasure |publisher=Imarobot.com |access-date=2013-01-10}}</ref>

In June 2008, Lars Vognstrup joined the group, having previously played with Nikolic in the band [[Junior Senior]]. In 2009, [[Orpheo McCord]] (of [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]] and of [[Fool's Gold (band)|Fool's Gold]]), Jason "ComputerJay" Taylor, and Jonas Petri Megyessi joined the band.

On January 6, 2011, the band played six songs live on [[KCRW]]'s [[Morning Becomes Eclectic]]. This was the first time since ''Monument to the Masses'' tours that the new band lineup had played live. Ima Robot's B-side "Greenback Boogie" from the album ''[[Another Man's Treasure]]'' has been featured as the theme song of the USA Network legal drama, ''Suits'', since 2011.

The band has been inactive since 2011 as its members have been busy with side projects. Alex Ebert has stated that he is "still in Ima Robot."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tuners.io/tracks/6844 |title=TUNERS|website=Tuners.io |access-date=2018-10-24 }}</ref>
