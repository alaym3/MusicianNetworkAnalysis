==Early life==
A distant relative of [[Davy Crockett]],<ref name="AMG"/> Charley was born in [[San Benito, Texas]], United States.<ref name="Chron"/>  The son of a single mother<ref name="Austin"/> with an older brother and sister, Crockett was raised in a trailer park in [[Los Fresnos, Texas]].<ref name="AMG"/><ref name="Rolling"/> His mother relocated the family to [[Dallas]],<ref name="Rolling"/> and Crockett spent the summer months with his uncle, who lived in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]].<ref name="Dmag"/> Upon leaving high school, at the age of 17 Crockett decided to travel with his guitar, acquired by his mother from a pawn shop.  Crockett noted "I taught myself how to play and started to write songs immediately, without any chord knowledge or anything. I didn't know what key I was in for 12 years, but my ear was really good, and I could play in any key and any chord. I just didn't know what it was."<ref name="Austin"/> His early musical influences came from hearing [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and became fascinated with the [[sampling (music)|samples]] used.  Crockett said "I got into [[Curtis Mayfield]] through samples of his songs by other artists, and [[Nina Simone]] was through a sample. Even [[J. Cole]], I was listening to a song of his ("Kenny Lofton"), and it was based on the sample from [[the Manhattans]] version of "[[Hurt (Roy Hamilton song)|Hurt]]".<ref name="Chron"/>

Crockett played music on the streets in the French Quarter of New Orleans and in [[Deep Ellum, Dallas]] as a teenager. Later he traveled further afield by hitchhiking and riding freight, before by 2009 busking in New York City.<ref name="Dmag"/><ref name="AMG"/> As he improved his performing, Crockett organized a street band called the Trainrobbers, which caught the attention of a Manhattan-based representative for [[Sony Music]].  She signed the 26 years old Crockett to a two-year management contract, although he rejected a publishing deal.<ref name="Austin"/><ref name="Dmag"/> Eventually tired of life on the streets and the pending expiry of the contract, Crockett relocated to [[Northern California]], where he combined working on farms and communes with performing for three more years.<ref name="Austin"/><ref name="AMG"/><ref name="Chron"/> Crockett then existed on the streets in Paris, France, for a year, and briefly lived in Spain and Morocco.<ref name="Mystic"/>

During these years, Crockett struggled to stay on the right side of the law. In the US, he sold weed to get by, at one point working the harvest in clandestine marijuana field in the northwest, and was arrested for possession in 2014. He was convicted of a felony crime twice. Music provided the way out.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Story|url=https://www.charleycrockett.com/story|access-date=2021-09-17|website=Charley Crockett|language=en-US}}</ref> Crockett noted later, "People think my story is far-fetched, but the thing is, I've toned it down."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gage|first=Jeff|date=2018-04-26|title=How Charley Crockett's Hard Living Shaped New Album 'Lonesome As a Shadow'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/how-charley-crocketts-hard-living-shaped-new-album-lonesome-as-a-shadow-630324/|access-date=2021-07-14|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

In late 2018, Crockett issued ''Lil G.L.'s Blue Bonanza''. Crockett noted that "Lil G.L. is my side name, like Hank [Williams] had Luke the Drifter. I use it for all my side projects and cover projects".  He explained the moniker was given to him by a local blues drummer, Jay Moeller, in reference to the obscure R&B singer [[G. L. Crockett]].<ref name="Austin"/> [[AllMusic]] stated "''Lil G.L.'s Blue Bonanza'' is a companion of sorts to Charley Crockett's 2017 ''Lil G.L.'s Honky Tonk Jubilee''".<ref name="AMG"/> The album was primarily another compilation of cover versions, although Crockett's definition of the blues encompasses tracks including [[Jimmy Reed]]'s "[[Bright Lights, Big City (song)|Bright Lights, Big City]]"; [[Tom T.
