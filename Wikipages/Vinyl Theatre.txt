== History ==
=== Formation (2012–2014) ===
Singer and guitarist Keegan Calmes first met keyboardist Chris Senner at a cross-country meet in high school. They decided after getting to know each other that they would meet up again, this time to begin writing and practicing songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbuew_rXxwM|title = Vinyl Theatre: Behind the Band - Chris Senner - YouTube|date = December 9, 2014|access-date = January 31, 2014|publisher =[[YouTube]] }}</ref> Calmes left Wisconsin to attend college at [[Adams State University]] in Colorado while Senner attended college at [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]. The two wrote songs and shared ideas over [[Skype]] and email and eventually recorded a demo CD together. Senner emailed one of his friends from college, Nick Cesarz, and asked him to record drums over their tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am4jx5mCoDA|title = Vinyl Theatre: Behind the Band - Nick Cesarz - YouTube|date = November 24, 2014|access-date = January 31, 2015|publisher =[[YouTube]] }}</ref> Cesarz was brought into the band once Calmes and Senner have their approval of his recording. Keegan returned home from Colorado, having dropped out to be able to pursue music as a career. The band was in need of a bass player, so Chris contacted a high school friend, Josh Pothier, and asked him to join. With his parents' blessing, Pothier dropped out of college, where he was close to finishing a degree in psychology, to join the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eli_u-el6Gc|title = Vinyl Theatre: Behind the Band - Josh Pothier |publisher=[[YouTube]]|date = December 16, 2014|access-date = January 31, 2015}}</ref>

The group first called themselves "Alchemy", but after searching on the internet, they found other bands either with the same or similar names, making it difficult for themselves to stand out.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/vinyl-theatres-hitting-its-stride-in-the-music-world-b99296500z1-265575401.html|title = Vinyl Theatre's hitting its stride in the music world|date = July 2, 2014|access-date = January 31, 2015|website=Jsonline.com }}</ref> They dropped the name when they had new management and replaced it with "Vinyl Theatre", stating that the vinyl aspect meant "When you buy a record on vinyl, it’s often for a band you’re truly dedicated to..." and "theatre" represented the theatrics of music.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.directlyrics.com/directlyrics-interviews-vinyl-theatre-on-signing-with-fueled-by-ramen-debut-album-electrogram-first-headlining-us-tour-news.html|title = DirectLyrics Interviews Vinyl Theatre: On Signing With Fueled By Ramen, Debut Album "Electrogram" & First Headlining U.S Tour!|date = November 7, 2014|access-date = January 31, 2015|website=Directlyrics.com }}</ref>

With their name, members, and management being settled, the band began collaboratively writing songs and began putting them on social music sharing site, [[SoundCloud]]. There, they released their first song, "Breaking Up My Bones", which received large amounts of feedback from around the world. Looking back, the band realized that the combination of the site's only weeks-old "trending" feature and self-promotion on other social media networks was what provided them with so much feedback.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://174.123.25.3/music/articles/atlunchwithvinyltheatre.html|title = At lunch with Vinyl Theatre|date = October 4, 2014|access-date = January 31, 2015|website=174.123.25.3 }}</ref>

===Fueled by Ramen and touring (2014–2016)===
In March 2014, the band was put on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s Next Big Sound Chart<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.billboard.com/charts/next-big-sound-25/2014-03-22|title = <nowiki>Next Big Sound | Billboard</nowiki>|date = March 22, 2014|access-date = January 31, 2015|website=Billboard.com }}</ref> and was also announced to the setlist of Summerfest's Emerging Artist Series to take place in July of that year. New York City-based record label [[Fueled by Ramen]], which has bands such as [[Paramore]] and [[Twenty One Pilots]] on their roster, picked up on the attention that Vinyl Theatre was receiving and contacted the band to ask for a performance. People from the label flew out to Milwaukee and watched the band perform in their practice space, which was also Nick Cesarz's basement. On August 19, 2014, Vinyl Theatre announced via their Facebook page that they had just been signed to Fueled by Ramen and that their first album, ''Electrogram'' would be released on September 23, 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/VinylTheatre/posts/946931008666218|title = Vinyl Theatre - We are happy to announce that we have...|date = August 19, 2014|access-date = January 31, 2014|website=Facebook.com }}</ref>
