Starting his career with singles of [[standard (music)|standard music]], he became highly popular as an album artist, with several dozen of his albums achieving [[Music recording certification|gold or platinum]] status and 73 making the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] to date. Mathis has received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and has been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] for three separate recordings.

Although frequently described as a romantic singer, his discography includes [[traditional pop music|traditional pop]], [[Brazilian music|Brazilian]] and [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]], [[soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[show tune]]s, [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[soft rock]], [[blues]], [[country music]], and even a few [[disco]] songs for his album ''[[Mathis Magic]]'' in 1979. Mathis has also recorded six albums of [[Christmas music]]. In a 1968 interview, Mathis cited [[Lena Horne]], [[Nat King Cole]], and [[Bing Crosby]] among his musical influences.<ref name=pc23/>

==Early life and education==
Mathis was born in [[Gilmer, Texas]], on September 30, 1935,<ref name="mathis"/> the fourth of seven children of Clem Mathis and Mildred Boyd, both domestic cooks.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/10/johnny-mathis-my-family-values|title=Johnny Mathis: My family values|date=January 10, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=February 17, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Herschthal |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/arts/music/blacks_and_jews_musical_gray_area |title="For Blacks And Jews, A Musical Gray Area" Eric Herschthal, ''Jewish Week'', October 12, 2010 |publisher=Thejewishweek.com |date=June 25, 2014 |access-date=June 29, 2014}}</ref> The family moved to [[San Francisco, California]], settling on 32nd Avenue in the [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Richmond District]], where Mathis grew up. His father, a singer and pianist,<ref name="auto"/> had worked in [[vaudeville]], and when he saw his son's talent, he bought an old [[upright piano]] for $25 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25|1944}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and encouraged him. Mathis began learning songs and routines from his father; his parents also ran his fan club.<ref name="auto"/> His first song was "My Blue Heaven".<ref name="stationave">{{cite web|url= http://www.stationave.com/bios.johnnymathis.html|title= The Incomparable Mr. Johnny Mathis|publisher= Station Avenue Productions|date= April 3, 2006|access-date= February 2, 2007|archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/697DcAaEi?url=http://www.stationave.com/bios.johnnymathis.html|archive-date= July 13, 2012|url-status= dead}}</ref> Mathis started singing and dancing for visitors at home, at school, and at church functions.<ref name="lvol">{{cite web|url= http://www.lvol.com/bios/e60.html|title= Johnny Mathis|publisher= Las Vegas Online Entertainment Guide|year= 2006|access-date= February 2, 2007}}</ref> Mathis is of [[African-American]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] heritage.

When Mathis was 13, voice teacher Connie Cox accepted him as her student in exchange for work around her house.<ref name=Star>{{cite web|author= Richard Ouzounian|title= Johnny Mathis: A born crooner|url= https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/684202|newspaper= Toronto Star|date= August 22, 2009}}</ref> Mathis studied with Cox for six years, learning vocal scales and exercises, voice production, classical and operatic singing. The first band he sang with was formed by his high school friend [[Merl Saunders]]. Mathis eulogized Saunders at his funeral in 2008, thanking him for giving Mathis his first chance as a singer.

Mathis was a star athlete at [[George Washington High School (San Francisco)|George Washington High School]] in San Francisco. He was a high jumper and hurdler, and he played on the basketball team. In 1954, he enrolled at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]] on an athletic scholarship, intending to become an English teacher and a [[physical education]] teacher.<ref name=Star/> While there, Mathis set a high-jump record of 6'-5 1/2" [1.97 m]. This is still one of the college's top jump heights and was only 7&nbsp;cm [three inches] short of the 1952 Olympic record of 2.04 m at the time. Just as when he was in high school, Mathis's name was frequently mentioned in the sports sections of the Northern California newspapers. He and future NBA star [[Bill Russell]] were featured in a 1954 sports section article of the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' demonstrating their high-jumping skills (Russell #1 & Mathis #2 in the City of San Francisco at that time). During one meet at the University of Nevada, Mathis beat Russell's highest jump attempt that day. Mathis was often referred to as "the best all-around athlete to come out of the San Francisco Bay Area."{{by whom|date=January 2020}}

==Career==
===Debut===
While singing at a Sunday afternoon jam session with a friend's jazz sextet at the [[Black Hawk (nightclub)|Black Hawk Club]] in San Francisco, Mathis attracted the attention of the club's co-founder, Helen Noga. She became his music manager, and in September 1955, after Noga had found Mathis a job singing weekends at Ann Dee's 440 Club, she learned that [[George Avakian]], head of Popular Music A&R at [[Columbia Records]], was on vacation near San Francisco. After repeated calls, Noga finally persuaded Avakian to come hear Mathis at the 440 Club. After hearing Mathis sing, Avakian sent his record company a telegram stating: "Have found phenomenal 19-year-old boy who could go all the way. Send blank contracts."<ref name="lvol"/>

At San Francisco State, Mathis had become noteworthy as a high jumper, and in 1956 he was asked to try out for the U.S. Olympic Team that would travel to [[Melbourne, Australia]], that November.<ref name="mathis">{{cite web|access-date=May 12, 2011|title=Johnny Mathis Official Website|url=http://www.johnnymathis.com/}}</ref> Mathis had to decide whether to go to the Olympic trials or to keep his appointment in [[New York City]] to make his first recordings. On his father's advice, Mathis opted to embark on a professional singing career. His [[LP record|LP record album]] was released in late 1956 instead of waiting until the first quarter of 1957.

Mathis's first [[record album]], ''Johnny Mathis: A New Sound In Popular Song'', was a slow-selling jazz album, but Mathis stayed in New York City to sing in nightclubs. His second album was produced by [[Columbia Records]] vice-president and [[record producer]] [[Mitch Miller]], who helped to define the Mathis sound. Miller preferred that Mathis sing soft, romantic ballads, pairing him with conductor and music arranger [[Ray Conniff]], and later, [[Ray Ellis]], [[Glenn Osser]], and [[Robert Mersey]]. In late 1956, Mathis recorded two of his most popular songs: "[[Wonderful! Wonderful!]]" and "[[It's Not for Me to Say]]".<ref name=pc23>{{Pop Chronicles|23}}.</ref> Also that year, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him up to sing the latter song in the movie ''[[Lizzie (1957 film)|Lizzie]]'' (1957).

===Show biz millionaire===
Mathis' appearance on the popular TV program ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in June 1957 helped increase his popularity. Later in 1957, he released "[[Chances Are (song)|Chances Are]]", which became his second single to sell a million.<ref name=Millionaire>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 24, 1958|title=Mathematics on Mathis|page=57|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety213-1958-12#page/n295/mode/1up|access-date=May 21, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> In November 1957, Mathis released "[[Wild Is the Wind (song)|Wild Is the Wind]]", which featured in the [[Wild Is the Wind|film of the same name]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. He performed the song at the ceremony in March 1958.

The week before his appearance at the Academy Awards, ''[[Johnny's Greatest Hits]]'' was released. The album spent an unprecedented 490 consecutive weeks through 1967 (nearly nine and one-half years) on the ''Billboard'' top 200 album charts,<ref>{{cite news|title= Top LP's|date=July 20, 1968|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| page =70}}</ref> including three weeks at number one. It held the record for the most weeks on the top [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums in the US for 15 years, until [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (March 1973) reached 491 weeks in October 1983.<ref>{{cite news|title= Top LP's & Tapes|date=October 29, 1983|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| page =73}}</ref>

Later in 1958, Mathis made his second film appearance for [[20th Century Fox]], singing the song "[[A Certain Smile (song)|A Certain Smile]]" in the [[A Certain Smile (film)|film of that title]]. The song was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].

By the end of the year, he was set to earn $1 million a year.<ref name=Millionaire/> Critics called him "the velvet voice".<ref name="stationave"/>

[[File:Johnny Mathis 1960.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Mathis in 1960]]
During the summer of 1958, Mathis left San Francisco with the Nogas, who sold their interest in the Black Hawk club that year, and moved to [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], California, where the Nogas bought a house. Mathis lived with the family.

Mathis appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'' on January 1, 1959.

Mathis had two of his biggest hits in 1962 and 1963, with "[[Gina (song)|Gina]]" (number 6) and "[[What Will Mary Say]]" (number 9).

In 1962, ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine listed Mathis as one of 30-35 millionaires on their list of "America's 100 Richest Negroes".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|date=May 1962|access-date=November 15, 2020|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9cDAAAAMBAJ|pages=130–137|title=America's 100 Richest Negroes}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 2, 1962|title=5 From Show Business In 'Ebony' Roster of 100 U.S. Negro Millionaires|page=1}}</ref>

===Split from Noga===
In October 1964, Mathis sued Noga to void their management arrangement, which Noga fought with a counterclaim in December 1964. Mathis purchased a mansion in [[Hollywood Hills]] that was originally built by the billionaire [[Howard Hughes]] in 1946, where he still maintains a residence.

After splitting from Noga, Mathis established Jon Mat Records, incorporated in California on May 11, 1967, to produce his recordings (previously, he founded Global Records to produce his Mercury albums), and Rojon Productions, incorporated in California on September 30, 1964, to handle all of his concert, theater, showroom, and television appearances, and all promotional and charitable activities. His new manager and business partner was Ray Haughn, who, until his death in September 1984, helped guide Mathis's career. Since that time, Mathis has taken sole responsibility for it.

While Mathis continued to make music, the ascent of the Beatles and early 1970s album rock kept his adult contemporary recordings out of the pop singles charts, until he experienced a career renaissance in the late 1970s.

Johnny Mathis had a 1976 [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one single]] in the UK with the song "[[When a Child Is Born]]".

In 1978, Mathis recorded "[[Too Much, Too Little, Too Late]]" with singer [[Deniece Williams]]. The lyrics and music were arranged by Nat Kipner and John McIntyre Vallins. Released as a single in 1978, it reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 pop chart, number nine on the Canadian Singles Chart and number three on the UK Singles Chart. It also topped the US R&B and adult contemporary charts. "Too Much, Too Little, Too Late" was certified gold and silver in the US and in the UK by the RIAA and the British Phonographic Industry respectively. It was his first number one hit since his 1957 chart-topping "Chances Are".

The duo released a follow-up duet, their version of "[[You're All I Need to Get By#Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams version|You're All I Need to Get By]]," peaking at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. In 1982, they were credited for performing "Without Us" which became the theme song for the American sitcom television series, [[Family Ties]], from its second season onwards. The success of the duets with Williams prompted Mathis to record duets with a variety of partners, including [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Gladys Knight]], [[Jane Olivor]], [[Stephanie Lawrence]], and [[Nana Mouskouri]]. A compilation album also called ''Too Much, Too Little, Too Late'', released by Sony Music in 1995 featured the title track among other songs by Mathis and Williams.

===News and recent years===
During 1980–1981, Mathis recorded an album with [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s [[Bernard Edwards]] and [[Nile Rodgers]], ''[[I Love My Lady]]'', which remained unreleased in its entirety until its 2017 appearance in the 68 disc collection [[The Voice of Romance: The Columbia Original Album Collection]]. Three tracks had appeared on a Chic [[box set]] in 2010 and a fourth, the title track, on Mathis' ''Ultimate Collection'' in 2011 and the Chic Organization's ''[[Up All Night (The Chic Organization album)|Up All Night]]'' in 2013.

Mathis returned to the [[British (people)|British]] Top 30 album chart in 2007 with the Sony BMG release ''The Very Best of Johnny Mathis'' in 2008 with the CD "A Night to Remember" and again in 2011 with "The Ultimate Collection"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/johnny%20mathis/|title= Johnny Mathis – Albums |publisher=Official Charts Company|access-date= February 17, 2014}}</ref>

Mathis continues to perform live, but from 2000 forward, he limited his concert performances to about fifty to sixty per year. He is one of the last pop singers who travels with his own full orchestra (as opposed to a band).

Mathis, [[Bob Dylan]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Billy Joel]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] carry the distinction of having the longest tenure of any recording artists on the Columbia label. With the exception of a four-year break to record for [[Mercury Records]] in the mid-1960s, he has been with Columbia Records throughout his career, from 1956 to 1963 and from 1968 to the present. (Dylan spent a couple of years at [[Asylum Records]] then re-signed with Columbia; Bennett recorded for [[Verve Records|Verve]] and his own Improv label from 1972 to 1986 when he returned to Columbia; Joel has been with the label since his 1973 album "[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]];" Streisand and Springsteen have never left.)

He has had five of his albums on the ''Billboard'' charts simultaneously, an achievement equaled by only two other singers: [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Barry Manilow]]. He has released 200 singles and had 71 songs charted around the world.

Pieces of music from numerous Mathis albums continue to be used in motion pictures and television. For example, "Chances Are" was played during an extraterrestrial visit in the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). "[[Wonderful! Wonderful!]]"  was used in ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Home (The X-Files)|Home]]", albeit performed by a sound-alike singer. Mathis's "Wonderful! Wonderful!" was also used in the conclusion to the long-running TV series ''Desperate Housewives'' as "Karen McClusky" died. Various Mathis songs have been played more recently in the TV series ''[[Mad Men]],'' which also features a recurring minor character named "John Mathis," and in the TV series ''[[Call the Midwife]]''.

He has taped twelve of his own television specials and made over 300 television guest appearances, with 33 of them being on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Longtime ''Tonight Show'' host [[Johnny Carson]] said, "Johnny Mathis is the best ballad singer in the world." He appeared on the show with Carson's successor, [[Jay Leno]],<ref>{{cite web

Through the years, his songs (or parts of them) have been heard in 100 plus television shows and films around the globe. His appearance on the ''[[Live by Request]]'' broadcast in May 1998 on the [[A&E Network]] had the largest television viewing audience of the series. Also in 1989, Johnny sang the theme for the ABC daytime soap opera ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]''.
