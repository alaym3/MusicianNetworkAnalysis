==History==
At first, the band consisted solely of Willgoose. He made his public debut at The Selkirk pub in [[Tooting]], London, England in August 2009.  Shortly afterwards he issued ''EP One''.  Teaming up with Wrigglesworth on drums, the band played its first festival in September 2010, Aestival in Suffolk, and work began on a second EP, ''The War Room'', which was released in May 2012.  Since then, the band has released four albums, ''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain]]'' (2013); ''[[The Race for Space (album)|The Race for Space]]'' (2015); ''[[Every Valley]]'' (2017); and ''[[Bright Magic]]'' (2021). The Race for Space was supported by two shows at the [[National Space Centre]] in Leicester celebrating the album's launch. The album charted just outside the top 10 in 11th place in the UK in its release week and reaching Number 1 in the UK Independent Charts for that week. A follow-up EP was released at the tail end of 2015 (Sputnik/Korolev) which was backed up by a UK tour, climaxing in the band's biggest headline show, a sold-out night at the O2 Academy Brixton, of which a live album was released in 2016. While writing ''The War Room'' the band formed a close relationship with the [[British Film Institute]], using their material during live shows.<ref name="The Guardian 2014-02-06" />

On 10 March 2017, PSB released a new single titled ''Progress'' featuring vocals from Tracyanne Campbell from [[Camera Obscura (band)|Camera Obscura]] with photo shoots showing the band as a three-piece with new member JF Abraham featured on promotional photos. Their third studio album, entitled ''[[Every Valley]]'', about the coal mining industry's rise and fall in the Welsh Valleys between the 1950s and 1980s, was released on 7 July 2017. As with ''The Race for Space'', the band had two album launch concerts, this time in [[Ebbw Vale]], where the LP was recorded.

In June 2018, PSB appeared at the [[BBC]] Music "Big Weekend", playing at the [[Titanic Quarter]] in [[Belfast]]. As part of this a series of four new pieces, based on the story of the {{RMS|Titanic}}, was debuted. These tracks were released as the EP White Star Liner on 26 October 2018.

They performed a "specially commissioned new arrangement" of ''The Race for Space'' on 25 July 2019 in a late-night [[The Proms|Prom]], joined by [[London Contemporary Voices]] and the Multi-Story Orchestra, the performance being shown on BBC television the following night.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00071mr/bbc-proms-2019-public-service-broadcasting |date=26 July 2019 |title=BBC Proms 2019: Public Service Broadcasting |access-date=3 August 2019 |publisher=[[BBC Proms]] |quote=[[Cerys Matthews]] introduces cult London band Public Service Broadcasting who take to the Royal Albert Hall stage for their Proms debut.

In December 2020, Willgoose released ambient solo EP ''A Wonderful Hope'' under the name Late Night Final. This release on PIAS Recordings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart-update/|title=Official Albums Chart Update Top 100 &#124; Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com}}</ref> is a record which featured soundscape artist Teddy Hunter on the track "The Human Touch".<ref>https://driftrecords.com/products/late-night-final-a-wonderful-hope#:~:text=Late%20Night%20Final%20is%20the,Willgoose.&text=With%20the%20next%20PSB%20album,set%20about%20creating%20something%20new.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://circuitsweet.co.uk/2020/09/late-night-final-public-service-broadcastings-j-willgoose-announces-a-wonderful-hope-lp-shares-the-human-touch-ft-teddy-hunter/|title=Late Night Final: Public Service Broadcasting's J.

On 2 June 2021, PSB debuted the first single, called "People, Let’s Dance" from their fourth studio album "Bright Magic".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Public Service Broadcasting return with new album Bright Magic {{!}} Louder|url=https://www.loudersound.com/amp/news/public-service-broadcasting-return-with-new-album-bright-magic|access-date=4 June 2021|website=www.loudersound.com}}</ref>

==Music style and live performances==

The band mostly plays instrumental music; Willgoose has said that "singing is never going to work. I'm not going to be happy with it, I'm not going to be comfortable playing it to other people."<ref name="The Guardian 2014-02-06">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/06/public-service-broadcasting-keep-calm-and-carry-on |title=Public Service Broadcasting keep calm and carry on |date=6 February 2014 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |last=Sheffield |first=Hazel}}</ref> They take samples from old [[public information film]]s, archive footage and propaganda material.<ref>{{cite web |website=Picture House Hackney |url=http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema/Hackney_Picturehouse/film/Public_Service_Broadcasting_Guests/ |title=Public Service Broadcasting + guests |access-date=20 May 2012}}</ref> Despite Willgoose's prior reservations about singing, he did later contribute vocals to the duet piece "You + Me" from ''Every Valley'', because the intended vocalist was not available.
