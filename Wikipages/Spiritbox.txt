'''Spiritbox''' is a Canadian [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. Husband and wife duo guitarist Mike Stringer and vocalist Courtney LaPlante established Spiritbox in 2017. The band's full lineup comprises LaPlante and Stringer, bassist Bill Crook, and drummer Zev Rose. The band's original full-time drummer, Ryan Loerke, was replaced by Rose in 2020. The band's metal style is difficult to pigeonhole into a specific metal music genre and displays an array of styles that draw from a variety of influences and incorporate electronic elements.

Dissatisfaction caused LaPlante and Stringer to leave their former band, [[Iwrestledabearonce]], and they started Spiritbox, seeking artistic freedom. Both released a debut [[extended play]], ''Spiritbox'' (2017), followed by a second EP, ''Singles Collection'' (2019), with the band's line-up completed. Spiritbox developed an approach to fanbase building focused on the [[Internet]] and introduced their music through acclaimed music videos. The band continued to gain popularity with several singles that reached the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] before releasing their debut album ''[[Eternal Blue (album)|Eternal Blue]]'' (2021), which entered the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number thirteen. Their music is currently released through their own label, Pale Chord, via a partnership with [[Rise Records]].<!--PER WP:LEADCITE, INFO IN THE LEAD IS CITED IN THE BODY-->
