==History==

===Freundeskreis===
Freundeskreis were primarily known for their political lyrics, in which they advocate equality and [[Internationalism (politics)|international understanding]]. After the much-noticed first album, ''[[Quadratur des Kreises]] (Squaring the Circle)'', and its hit single "A-N-N-A" which peaked at #6 in the [[Media Control Charts|German charts]], the band released its second album, ''[[Esperanto (Freundeskreis album)|Esperanto]]'', named after the [[constructed language]] [[Esperanto]]. The reasoning for the name was that the group wished to show that they believe that [[hip hop]] should be the Esperanto of [[youth]].<ref name=Naming>{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle-community.net/entertainment/deutscher_hip_hop_mit_niveau_freundeskreis_sind_zuruck_20070311.html |title=Deutscher Hip Hop mit Niveau: Freundeskreis sind zurück |accessdate=2007-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601184025/http://lifestyle-community.net/entertainment/deutscher_hip_hop_mit_niveau_freundeskreis_sind_zuruck_20070311.html |archivedate=2007-06-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1999 and 2000, the band was back in the charts with the singles "Mit Dir" (''With you''; featuring [[Joy Denalane]], who later become Herre's wife) and "Tabula Rasa Pt. II".  For the [[soundtrack]] of the film ''[[23 (film)|23]]'', Freundeskreis [[Cover version|covered]] the song "Halt dich an deiner Liebe fest" (''Hold on to your love'') written by [[Rio Reiser]], voicing it on [[Lee "Scratch" Perry|Lee "Scratch" Perry's]] [[Police and Thieves|police & thieves riddim]]. Freundeskreis was one of the first bands to take part in the [[Kolchose]], a group of hip hop artists from [[Stuttgart]].

In 2001, the band took a break for the members to pursue solo careers, the most active being Herre, who has released a solo album and works as producer for his wife.

A Freundeskreis [[greatest hits]] album was released in July 2007 under the title ''FK10''. After announcing their breakup in summer 2007, Freundeskreis gave their last concert in Stuttgart on 19 September 2007.

==Conscious lyrics==
Freundeskreis have been considered as a conscious hip-hop artist as their lyrics have educational themes. The song "Leg Dein Ohr Auf Die Schiene Der Geschichte" (lay your ear on the tracks of history) asks listeners to look beyond what they were taught in history lessons and learn the real lessons of history.

Excerpts from "Leg Dein Ohr Auf Die Schiene Der Geschichte"<ref>[http://www.freundeskreis10.de/songtexte.php?show=12 FREUNDESKREIS10.DE - SONGTEXTE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>"

:''viele Menschen schrecken zurück wenn sie "Geschichte" hör'n''

:''Geschichte...''

:''vier langweilige Stunden pro Woche in der Schule''

:(...)

:''neunzehnhundertdreiundsiebzig Geburtsjahr wichtig für mich''

:''als auch geschichtlich denn da wurd' klar dass die C.I.A. 'ne Hure war''

Rough translation:

:''many people step away when they hear "history"''

:''History...''

:''Four boring lessons in school a week ''

:(...)

:''nineteenseventythree, birth year, important for me,''

:''as well as historically, because then it became clear that the CIA was a whore''

The rest of the song takes into account other historical events important to his year of birth, as well as other events throughout his childhood which are often overlooked. The chorus implores,

:''you're just a part of it so get to the heart of it''

:'''cause if you don't go you won't know''

:''you're just a part of it get to the heart of it''

:'''cause if you don't go you never ever never ever gonna know''

===FK Allstars===
FK Allstars was a collaboration of several hip hop, [[Soul music|soul]], and [[reggae]] artists, including Max Herre, Sekou Neblett, Afrob, Brooke Russell, [[Joy Denalane]] and [[Gentleman (musician)|Gentleman]]. Despite the FK Allstars band having its roots in hip hop, there are elements of reggae, soul, [[funk]] and [[jazz]] blended in.
