'''Warren Griffin III''' (born November 10, 1970), known professionally as '''Warren G''', is an American [[rapper]], [[songwriter]], [[record producer]], and [[DJ]] known for his role in [[West Coast Rap|West Coast rap]]'s 1990s ascent.<ref name=":7">Steve Huey, [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/warren-g-mn0000815167/biography "Warren G: Biography"], ''AllMusic.com'', Netaktion LLC, visited 8 May 2020.</ref><ref name=":6">Jeff Weiss explains, "As much as '[[The Chronic]]' is a psychedelic and sinister warp of the [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] records that constantly rotated on [[Dr. Dre|Dre]]'s childhood turntable, it is the sound of Long Beach, too: the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] hymns of the Baptist church turned into filthy harmonic gospel by Snoop, Nate Dogg, Warren G and Daz" [J Weiss, [https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-dr-dre-the-chronic-20171215-story.html "25 years later, Dr. Dre's 'The Chronic' remains rap's world-building masterpiece"], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/entertainment/music/25-years-later-dr-dres-the-chronic-remains-raps-world-building-masterpiece/2017/12/14/8632acda-e00f-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html ''Washington Post''] & ''Chicago Tribune'', 15 Dec 2017].

==Early life==

Warren Griffin III was born on November 10, 1970, in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], a city in California's [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]].<ref name=":15" /> He had three sisters and was the only son of Warren Griffin, Jr., an airplane mechanic, and Ola, a [[dietician]].<ref name=":15">Brenna Sanchez, [https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/warren-g "Contemporary Musicians: Warren G"], ''[[Encyclopedia.com]]'', [[Cengage]], updated 12 Apr 2020.</ref> They divorced when Warren was 4 and he lived with his mother and three sisters in [[East Long Beach]] until he was just about to start middle school.<ref name=":15" />

In 1982, Warren went to live with his father in [[North Long Beach, Long Beach, California|North Long Beach]].<ref name=":15" /> His new wife, Verna, had three children from a prior marriage,<ref name=":15" /> one of whom was Andre Young, the soon-to-become [[Dr. Dre]] who in 1984 joined a leading DJ crew, the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]], which by 1985 doubled as an electro rap group, which in 1987 put out the Los Angeles area's first rap recording under a [[major label]].<ref>David Diallo, ch 10 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XkCncJ7j744C&q=Cru "From electro-rap to G-funk: A social history of rap music in Los Angeles and Compton, California"], in Mickey Hess, ed., ''Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide'', Volume 1: ''East Coast and West Coast'' (Westport, CT: [[Greenwood Press]], 2010).</ref><ref name=":29">David Diallo, "Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg", in Mickey Hess, ed., ''Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture'' (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood Press, 2007), pp 319–[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Icons_of_Hip_Hop/LldOLnIQ66cC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Eazy&pg=PA321 322].</ref> By then, a [[Jordan High School (Long Beach, California)|Jordan High School]] student, Warren was playing football and running with friends.<ref name=":15" />

At age 17, Warren was jailed for gun possession.<ref name=":15" /> While incarcerated, he took the nickname "Warren G."<ref name=":15" /> Released soon after, he began focusing on music after Dre taught him how to use a drum machine.<ref name=":15" /> Meanwhile, still in 1988, Dre was the lead [[record producer]] for [[Ruthless Records]] and for, as a member of, [[N.W.A]]—a new rap group on the new label—whose landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', was driving the Los Angeles area's rap scene to swiftly drop electro for gangsta,<ref name=":29" /> while Warren, fresh out of high school, was jailed for selling drugs.<ref name=":15" /> Once out, he worked at the Long Beach shipyards.<ref name=":15" />

By 1990, Warren had formed the trio [[213 (group)|213]],<ref name=":13" /> with two longtime running mates, Nathaniel "[[Nate Dogg]]" Hale and Calvin "[[Snoop Dogg]]" Broadus. 213 was a contributor to the [[G-funk]] sound to soon emerge in rap.<ref name=":6" /> The trio dissolved after Warren connected them to Dre.<ref name=":13" /> At that point, two superstar, solo careers were launched: Dre's and Snoop's, upon G-funk.<ref name=":4">Ben Westhoff, "[https://www.laweekly.com/the-making-of-the-chronic The making of ''The Chronic''"], ''[[LA Weekly]]'', 19 Nov 2012.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-tw8TACddA "Dr. Dre speaks at Snoop Dogg's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony 11.19.18"], ''The Hollywood Fix'' @ YouTube, 19 Nov 2018.</ref> Nate, too, signed to Dre's [[Death Row Records]], in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref name=":4" /> Warren initially helped there,<ref name=":13" /> but, not desiring a career in his mentor and stepbrother's shadow, signed to [[Def Jam Recordings]], in [[New York City]].<ref name=":15" /><ref name=":23" />

==Music career==

=== Start with 213 (circa 1990) ===
By 1990, in his hometown [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], as record producer and rapper, Warren formed a music trio with two of his longtime running mates, Nathaniel "[[Nate Dogg]]" Hale, a rapperlike singer, and Calvin "[[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Rock]]" Broadus,<ref name=":24">In his 1994 single "[[Do You See]]," Warren G reminisces on his background, while incidentally noting, twice, that 213 had originally been Warren G, Nate Dogg, and Snoop Rock, amid visuals that briefly show the V.I.P record shop [Warren G, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoezCLhQFaE "Do You See"], ''Warren G'' @ YouTube, 6 Oct 2009].</ref> a singerlike rapper.<ref name=":4" /> The Long Beach trio, fond of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] rap group [[415 (group)|415]], named for the [[Bay area]]'s [[area code]], took the name [[213 (group)|213]], the Los Angeles area's.<ref name=":13" /> Practicing and recording in the modest studio in Long Beach record store V.I.P.,<ref name=":24" /> they cut a demo tape.<ref name=":13" /> [[Dr. Dre]], already a celebrity, rebuffed his younger stepbrother Warren's requests for him to listen.<ref name=":1">P.R., "Warren G", in Nathan Brackett with Christian Hoard, eds., ''The New Rolling Stone Album Guide'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004), [https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_New_Rolling_Stone_Album_Guide/t9eocwUfoSoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Snoop,+Nate,+Warren,+213,+1990+Dre&pg=PA859 p 859].

Before long, homemade copies of 213's songs spread in [[Los Angeles county]], particularly the cities [[Compton, California|Compton]] and [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], and Los Angeles city's sections [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and [[South Los Angeles|South Central]], but no label picked them up.<ref name=":13" /> One day, Warren phoned Dre to catch up, and found him at a bachelor party—thrown for Dre's friend Andre "LA Dre" Bolton, another record producer—whereupon Warren found himself invited to join it.<ref name=":13" /> There, once the songs began to repeat, Warren offered LA Dre the 213 tape.<ref name=":13" /> Liking it, he summoned Dr. Dre, who, hearing the Snoop rap "Super Duper Snooper," immediately welcomed the trio.<ref name=":15" /> Days later, 213 moved into Dre's lavish [[Troubadour style#Architecture|troubadour-style]] house in [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], home to both his wife and his recording studio.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>In Calabasas, on the hills west of the [[San Fernando Valley]], Dre had bought, in perhaps 1989, "a lavish [[Troubadour style|troubadour-style]] home", and put a recording studio in an upstairs bedroom [Gerrick D.

In April 1992, Dr. Dre's debut solo single "[[Deep Cover (song)|Deep Cover]]" introduced America to Snoop Doggy Dogg, the track's guest but instantly star rapper.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":17">David Diallo, "Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg", in Mickey Hess, ed., ''Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture'', Volume 1 (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LldOLnIQ66cC&pg=PA326&dq=213 pp 326–327].</ref> Warren helped Dre find sounds for Dre's debut solo album ''[[The Chronic]]'',<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":13" /> further debuting Snoop, whereby superstardom chased Snoop into 1993 and, via Snoop's own debut solo album, ''[[Doggystyle]]'', captured him by 1994.<ref name=":4" /><ref>Stereo Williams, [https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-snoop-dogg-became-the-most-wanted-man-in-america "When Snoop became the most wanted man in America"], ''[[Daily Beast]]'', 18 Nov 2018.</ref> By then, also solo, Nate, too, had joined Dre's label, [[Death Row Records]].<ref name=":4" /><ref>By the July 1998 release of Nate Dogg's repeatedly delayed solo album, the curtain was already closing on G-funk's popular run [Thomas Erlewine, [https://www.allmusic.com/album/g-funk-classics-vols-1-2-mw0000182144 "Nate Dogg: ''G Funk Classics, Vols. 1 & 2''"], ''AllMusic.com'', Netaktion LLC, visited 24 Apr 2020].</ref> Warren, returning to Long Beach, aimed to find his own way.<ref name=":15" /><ref name=":18">Gill, Karam, director, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B78awTk4MU "''G Funk'' | Official Documentary"], ''SnoopDoggTV'' @ YouTube Premium, 11 Jull 2018, which webpage offers a written synopsis.

=== Solo stardom (1993–1996) ===

During 1993, at Dr. Dre's studio, Warren met [[John Singleton]], director of ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'', the seminal film named for [[Boyz-n-the-Hood|Eazy-E's debut single]], produced by Dre.<ref>[[Jerry Heller]] w/ Gil Reavill, ''Ruthless: A Memoir'' (New York: [[Simon Spotlight Entertainment]], 2007), [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ruthless/jsn3pM18uJcC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=Singleton p 181].</ref><ref>Keith Murphy, [https://www.bet.com/music/2019/05/03/john-singleton-hollywood-hip-hop-champion-op-ed.html "John Singleton: Hollywood’s ultimate hip-hop head broke ground for the culture"], ''[[Bet.com|BET.com]]'', 3 May 2019.</ref> Singleton asked Warren to produce a song for [[Poetic Justice (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] of his forthcoming film ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]''. Warren thus produced [[Mista Grimm]]'s song "[[Indo Smoke]]," featuring Warren G and [[Nate Dogg]].<ref name=":15" /> The single's success led to Warren's invitation to [[Russell Simmons]]'s label [[Def Jam Recordings]], where Warren G signed a record deal.<ref name=":15" /> Also that year, Warren and Nate, along with [[Kurupt]]—whom the 213 trio had brought to Dre to help on his album ''[[The Chronic]]''<ref name=":4" />—feature on "Ain't No Fun," a huge underground hit, too risque to be a single, on Snoop's ''[[Doggystyle]]'' album, released in November.<ref>About tracks on Dr. Dre's album [[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|''2001'']], Soren Baker writes, "If fact, even songs that did not receive accompanying videos became huge underground hits, as had been the case with ''The Chronic''<nowiki/>'s '[[Bitches Ain't Shit]]' and ''Doggystyle''<nowiki/>'s 'Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)" [S Baker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wIFnDwAAQBAJ&q=Bitches+Ain%27t+Shit ''The History of Gangster Rap''] (New York: Abrams Image, 2018)].</ref>

On the ''[[Above The Rim]]'' soundtrack, from [[Death Row Records]] in April 1994, the single "[[Regulate (song)|Regulate]]" was a duet cowritten and performed by Warren G and Nate Dogg. Spending 20 weeks on the popular songs chart, the [[Billboard Hot 100]], with 18 of them in the Top 40, including three weeks at #2 in May,<ref name=":8" /> it was the summer's top rap hit.<ref name=":13" /> Certified Gold, half a million copies sold, since June, it attained Platinum, a million copies, in August.<ref name=":2" /> In January 2017, via digital downloading, it was certified 2x Multi-Platinum.<ref name=":2" /> Back in the American summer of 1994, it stood at #1 on the [[MTV]] charts.<ref name="Vernallis">{{cite book|last=Vernallis|first=Carol|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjDIw2pxjiMC&pg=PT221|title=Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-231-11799-9|page=221}}</ref> Performing in Japan, he would discover fans who apparently understood no English, but knew all the lyrics. Into the 21st century, it remained Def Jam's biggest hit single.<ref name=":19" /> Russell Simmons, a Def Jam founder, explains, "Warren's music was worldwide because the melody plays no matter what the language."<ref name=":23">Gill, Karam, director, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B78awTk4MU "''G Funk'' | official documentary"], ''SnoopDoggTV'' @ YouTube Premium, 11 Jul 2018, which webpage offers a written synopsis, whereas the Russell Simmons quote about "Regulate" may appear at about the 57:35 mark.

Yet further, unlike other G-funk, short for ''gangsta'' funk, Warren G, even called "a romantic" at heart,<ref name=":32">Eric Weisbard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8X17JjiXfYYC&pg=PA135&dq=romantic "Platter du Jour: Warren G"], in Craig Marks, ed., Spins column, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', 1994 Sep;'''10'''(6):135.</ref> voiced simpler concerns.<ref name=":31" /> And his modest rap styling maximized, by heeding, his modest lyricism.<ref name=":25" /> "Regulate" doubled as the lead single Warren G's debut album, ''[[Regulate... G Funk Era]]'', arriving in June 1994. Selling a million copies in three days, it debuted at #2 on the popular albums chart, the [[Billboard 200]].<ref name=":15" /> In August, it was certified 2x Multi-Platinum, two million copies sold.<ref name=":2" /> Its second single, "[[This D.J.]]," went gold, half a million copies, in September,<ref name=":2" /> while peaking in July at #9.<ref name=":8" /> At the [[1995 Grammy Awards]], in March, both singles were nominated.<ref name=":9">"Regulate" was nominated in [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]], and "This D.J." in [[Best Rap Solo Performance]].</ref> And in January, the album's other single, "[[Do You See]]," had peaked at #42.<ref name=":14">[https://www.billboard.com/music/warren-g/chart-history "Chart history: Warren G"], ''Billboard.com'', visited 10 May 2020.</ref> In August, the album was certified 3x Multi-Platinum.<ref name=":2" /> That month also brought some Warren G collaborations on two albums from his Long Beach associates, the [[Twinz]] duo's ''[[Conversation (album)|Conversation]]'' and [[The Dove Shack]] trio's ''[[This Is the Shack]]''. And 1996 saw Warren G on the "Groupie" track of Snoop's second album, ''[[Tha Doggfather]]''.

=== Followup albums (1997–2001) ===
Warren G's second album, ''[[Take a Look Over Your Shoulder]]'', released in March 1997, was [[certified Gold]], half a million copies sold, in May.<ref name=":2" /> Sharing with the [[Supercop (soundtrack)|''Supercop'' soundtrack]] the single "[[What's Love Got to Do with It (Warren G song)|What's Love Got To Do with It]]," featuring singer [[Adina Howard]], a spin on the [[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|1984 single]] by [[Tina Turner]], reached #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref>[https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/30875/warren-g "Warren G"], ''[[OfficialCharts.com]]'', The Official UK Charts Company, visited 12 May 2020.</ref> and peaked in the US at #32 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name=":8" /> "[[Smokin' Me Out]]," featuring [[Ron isley|Ron Isley]] of [[The Isley Brothers|the classic soul group]], reaching #35, was big on the Los Angeles area's radio play.<ref name=":25" /> "I Shot the Sheriff," a lyrical spin on the [[I Shot the Sheriff|1973 single]] by [[Bob Marley & The Wailers|Bob Marley & the Wailers]], yet an instrumental borrow from rap group [[EPMD]]'s 1988 single "[[Strictly Business (EPMD song)|Strictly Business]]," which itself samples that Wailers classic, reached #20.<ref name=":8" /> Yet a letdown overall, the album missed his debut's superstar potential.<ref name=":5">John Bush, [https://www.allmusic.com/album/i-want-it-all-mw0000247898 "Warren G: ''I Want It All''"], ''AllMusic.com'', Netaktion LLC, visited 8 May 2020.</ref>

In July 1998, Warren G's sixth appearance in the Billboard Hot 100's upper tier Top 40 became Nate Dogg's single "[[Nobody Does It Better (Nate Dogg song)|Nobody Does it Better]]"<ref name=":8" />—on [[G-Funk Classics, Vol. 1 & 2|Nate's repeatedly delayed debut album]]—featuring Warren G, in another duet, which peaked at #18 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name=":14" /> Here, incidentally, Warren raps a [[Bar (music)|bar]] indicating his transition to family life.<ref name=":30">In the "[[Nobody Does It Better (Nate Dogg song)|Nobody Does It Better]]" single, in his third and final verse, Warren G raps, in two bars, "Hot rap singles, on the charts now / Got a baby, so I'm breaking hearts now" [https://www.metrolyrics.com/nobody-does-it-better-lyrics-nate-dogg.html "Nobody Does It Better lyrics—Nate Dogg"], ''[[MetroLyrics.com]]'', CBS Interactive Inc., 2020].</ref> Warren's third album, ''[[I Want It All (album)|I Want It All]]'', released in October 1999, has Warren mainly producing—where, perhaps, his greater comparative strength among musical peers abides—while vocals go largely to guest artists, including Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, [[RBX]], [[Kurupt]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Slick Rick]], and [[Jermaine Dupri]].<ref name=":5" /> Certified Gold in November 1999,<ref name=":2" /> it bears the single "[[I Want It All (Warren G song)|I Want It All]]," featuring [[Mack 10]], which, becoming Warren's most recent Top 40 appearance, peaked on the Hot 100 at #23.<ref name=":8" />

Over 20 years later, his 1997 and 1999 albums remain at Gold certification, which none of his subsequent albums have achieved.<ref name=":2" /> Released in December 2001, Warren's fourth album, ''[[The Return of the Regulator]]'', with a litany of collaborators, including the [[P-Funk]] father and G-funk godfather [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and, elsewhere, Dr. Dre producing a track, is allegedly overdone, a comeback undone by Warren's reaching beyond his strengths and being outdone by his guests.<ref name=":20">Jason Birchmeier, [https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-return-of-the-regulator-mw0000592309 "Warren G: ''The Return of the Regulator''"], ''AllMusic.com'', Netaktion LLC,</ref><ref name=":12" /> He "wastes a hot, Dre-produced beat," in the single "[[Lookin' at You (song)|Lookin' at You]]," alleges a ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' writer, who finds G-funk on its deathbed and Warren G "administering the fatal shot."<ref name=":12">Shawn Edwards, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xiUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA124 "Warren G: ''The Return of the Regulator''"], ''Vibe'', 2002 Jan;'''10'''(1):124.</ref> The album peaked at number 83 the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and became his final album under a [[major record label]], here [[Universal Music Group]], before returned on an independent label.<ref name=":0">Jason Birchmeier, [https://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-mid-nite-hour-mw0000170923 "Warren G: ''In the Mid-Nite Hour''"], ''AllMusic.com'', Netaktion LLC, visited 8 May 2020.</ref>

=== Indie career (2005–present) ===

''[[In the Mid-Nite Hour]]'', released in October 2005, Warren G's fifth album, his first without a [[major label]] involved,<ref name=":0" /> was on Hawino Records.<ref name=":10">Steve "Flash" Juon, [http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2005_10_midnitehour.html "Warren G: ''In the Mid-Nite Hour'': Hawino Records/Lightyear Ent."], ''RapReviews.com'', 18 Oct 2005.</ref> Heavily featuring his native, 213 groupmates Nate and Snoop, it is devotedly Warren's own project, homemade on a low budget.<ref name=":0" /> Music critics assess it to better carry Warren G's own virtues as G-funk's [[everyman]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":10" /> Yet by that very virtue, as expected, it saw scarce exposure beyond Warren G's fans.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":10" />

His sixth album, in September 2009, ''[[The G Files]]'', "still the same basic G-funk sound," adds to "that classic soul vibe," Warren explains, "a taste of that modern electro sound."<ref name=":11">Jeff Weiss, [https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/12/the-gfunk-continuum-warren-g-talks-the-gfiles-the-xfiles-and-west-coast-hiphop.html "The G-funk continuum: Warren G talks 'The G-Files,' 'The X-Files' and West Coast hip hop"], ''Pop & Hiss'', the ''L.A. Times'' Music Blog, 18 Dec 2009.</ref> Disliking what he put as the rap standard of "some drums and one synth sound," he titled "The West is Back" for return to "that great soulful sound."<ref name=":11" /> "100 Miles and Running" features Nate Dogg—recorded before Nate's strokes in 2007 and 2008—and the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s [[Chef Raekwon]].<ref name=":11" />

From June to September 2013, Warren toured in the West Coast Fest, "an OG affair" with [[DJ Quik]], [[Mack 10]], the [[Dogg Pound]], [[Bone Thugs N Harmony]], and others.<ref name=":21">Rose Lilah, [https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/west-coast-fest-tour-line-up-features-e-40-dogg-pound-warren-g-and-more-news.5950.html "West Coast Fest tour line-up features E-40, Dogg Pound, Warren G & more"], HotNewHipHop website, 6 Jun 2013.</ref> Meanwhile, in a guest role, Warren played OG Hemingway in the sitcom ''[[Newsreaders]]'' on the [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] programming.<ref name=":27" /> And in August 2014, on the [[Mnet (TV channel)|Mnet]] channel's reality series ''American Hustle Life'', he directed an alternate music video for "Boy In Luv," by South Korean boy band [[BTS]].

Nostalgic fans would ask Warren for more of classic [[G-funk]], and even ask for more from Nate Dogg, who had died in 2011.<ref name=":3">[[Ebro Darden]] & [[Laura Stylez]], interviewers, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0blMD48aR0s&t=1s "Warren G talks growing up as Dr. Dre's brother, Snoop’s early rap battles and his new album"], ''[[Hot 97]]'' @ YouTube, 10 Aug 2015</ref><ref name=":26">Erika Ramirez, [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6620370/warren-g-regulate-g-funk-era-part-ii-ep "Warren G to release 'Regulate…G Funk Era Part II' EP this summer"], ''Billboard.com'', 8 Jul 2015.</ref> The single "[[My House (Warren G song)|My House]]," leading Warren G's first [[Extended play|EP]], arrived on July 13, 2015. With four songs, the EP, premised as a sequel to the 1994 original, is titled ''[[Regulate... G Funk Era, Pt. II]]''. Released on August 6, it features [[E-40]], [[Too Short]], [[Jeezy]], [[Bun B]], and, in all four songs, Nate Dogg. With his unique knack for intuiting Warren's production cues, Nate leaves behind some of his 213 partner's favorite recordings.<ref name=":3" />

==Personal life==
Apart from his music career, Warren has four children with his wife, Tenille Griffin. Getting older, increasingly identifying with his father, fond of cooking and storytelling, Warren G embraces "his morals and good family fun."<ref name=":28" /> One of his sons, Olaijah, played college football for the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]] from 2018 to 2020 and was recognized with all-conference honors in 2019.<ref name=":16">Ben Kercheval, [https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/usc-football-recruiting-warren-gs-son-five-star-cb-olaijah-griffin-commits "USC football recruiting: Warren G's son, five-star CB Olaijah Griffin, commits"], [[CBS Sports]] website, 7 Feb 2018.</ref><ref>Within USC's conference, the Pac-12, Griffin drew honorable mention for the official all-conference team, and made the Phil Steele All-Pac-12 third team ["[https://usctrojans.com/sports/football/roster/olaijah-griffin/11113 Football: Olaijah Griffin]", ''USCTrojans.com'', USC Athletics, visited 11 Aug 2020].</ref> In December 2020, he decided to forego his senior season and entered the [[2021 NFL Draft]] and went undrafted. Following the Draft, he signed with the [[Buffalo Bills]] as an undrafted free agent. In 2019, Warren G launched a line of barbecue sauces and rubs, Sniffin Griffin's BBQ, for retail and restaurant supply. This was inspired by his father, a cook in the [[US Navy]] and avid barbecue chef.<ref name=":28" /><ref name=":22">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXxnuoYUzE4 "Behind the scenes of Warren G the owner of Sniffin Griffins BBQ first sauce run"], ''Warren G'' @ YouTube, 7 Dec 2019.</ref>
