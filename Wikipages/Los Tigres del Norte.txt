'''Los Tigres del Norte''' (English: ''The Tigers of the North'') are a [[Norteño (music)|norteño]] band from [[San Jose, California]].<ref>[http://www.lostigresdelnorte.com/english/about.html Los Tigres del Norte - About]</ref>

==History==
[[File:LosTigresdelNorte.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jorge Hernández performing in August 2008]]
The band was started by [[Rosa Morada]], [[Mocorito]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Mexico]] natives Jorge Hernández, his brothers, and their cousins. They then began recording after moving to [[San Jose, California]] in the late 1960s, when all the members were still in their teens.<ref name="newyorker">{{cite web|last=Wilkinson |first=Alec |url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/24/100524fa_fact_wilkinson |title=Alec Wilkinson, "Immigration Blues," The New Yorker magazine, May 24, 2010 |publisher=Newyorker.com |access-date=May 14, 2012}}</ref> They were sponsored by a local record company, Discos Fama, owned by an Englishman named Art Walker, who took them under his wing and helped them find jobs and material, as well as recording all of their early albums.<ref name="newyorker" />

The Tigres were at first only locally popular, but took off after Jorge and Art Walker heard a Los Angeles mariachi singer perform a song in the early 1971 about a couple of drug runners, Emilio Varela and Camelia la Texana. There had been occasional ballads ([[corrido]]s, in Mexican terminology) about the cross-border drug trade ever since [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in the 1920s, but never a song as cinematic as this, featuring a woman smuggler who shoots the man and takes off with the money. After getting permission to record this song, Los Tigres del Norte released "'''[[Contrabando y traición]]'''" ("Contraband and Betrayal") in 1974.<ref name="univision-biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.univision.com/uv/music/1029452/Los_Tigres_del_Norte/biografia|title=Música|website=www.univision.com}}</ref> The song quickly hit on both sides of the border, inspired a series of movies, and kicked off one of the most remarkable careers in Spanish-language music.

In norteño form, Los Tigres del Norte have been able to portray "real life" in a manner that strikes a chord with people across the [[Americas]]. Many of their most popular songs consist of tales or corridos about life, love, and the struggle to survive in an imperfect world. They regularly touch on the subject of [[drug trafficking|narcotics]] and [[illegal immigration]], but they have also shared stories of love and betrayal between a man and a woman. Together, the band and its public has turned norteño music into an international genre. The band has modernized the music, infusing it with [[bolero]], [[cumbia]], rock rhythms, and [[waltz]]es. They also prominently incorporate a [[saxophone]] into some of their songs. As a result, it can be said that they also perform [[Norteño (music)#Regional variations|norteño-sax]] in addition to traditional accordion-led norteño.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

On January 9, 2007, Los Tigres del Norte was honored as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon at the 14th annual BMI Latin Awards.  Los Tigres, who were saluted that evening with an all-star musical tribute, were being honored as BMI Icons for their "unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers." They joined an elite list that includes such Latin music giants as [[Juan Luis Guerra]] and [[Carlos Santana]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/534208 |title=Los Tigres del Norte To Be Honored as BMI Icons at 14th Annual Latin Awards|date=January 9, 2007|publisher=bmi.com|access-date=October 11, 2010}}</ref>

On October 16, 2009, Los Tigres del Norte held a Concert in [[Guadalupe, Nuevo León|Guadalupe]], [[Nuevo León]] (outside of [[Monterrey]]) at the Annual Expo Guadalupe that lasted 12 hours, breaking their own record of 9 hours from previous year. It began on Saturday night and ended on Sunday at 9 a.m., not uncommon for Los Tigres del Norte. They are known for having encores at their concerts that can last more than an hour after the scheduled ending of the concert.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

They have performed before the [[United States Armed Forces]] in Japan and South Korea.<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://www.visionhispanausa.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=439:los-tigres-del-norte-with-raul-hernandez-&catid=29:historias-locales-empty&Itemid=4 |title=Visión Hispana |publisher=Visionhispanausa.com |date=April 15, 2010 |access-date=May 14, 2012}}</ref>

In 2010, the band made headlines by joining in a massive international [[boycott]] of the U.S. state of [[Arizona]], in response to the [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act]].<ref>[http://correo-gto.com.mx/notas.asp?id=160749 El Correo de Guanajuato:  "Tigres del Norte, participan en boicot contra Arizona"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722223133/http://correo-gto.com.mx/notas.asp?id=160749 |date=July 22, 2011 }} (in Spanish)</ref>

On October 8, 2013, Los Tigres del Norte played at an immigration reform rally on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Their setlist included songs that underscored the themes the rally would address including “La Puerta Negra (1986),” “De Paisano a Paisano (2000),” and “Mis Dos Patrias.” The band was introduced by then Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] (D-Calif.) Mexican-American singer-songwriter and actress, [[Lila Downs]], also accompanied the group in a series of duets.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/los-tigres-del-norte-sing-the-real-stuff-at-immigration-rally/2013/10/08/c3a26a84-304f-11e3-bbed-a8a60c601153_story.html Montgomery, David (2013).

In 2014 Los Tigres del Norte released the album ''[[Realidades (album)|Realidades]]'', which contains the song “Era Diferente” (meaning “She Was Different”) about a lesbian teenager who falls in love with her best friend; according to lead singer and songwriter Jorge Hernández, this is the first time a norteño group has ever written a gay love song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/realidades-mw0002741060/releases |title=Realidades - Los Tigres del Norte &#124; Releases |publisher=AllMusic |date=2014-10-07 |access-date=2015-03-25}}</ref><ref name="BY  Yezmin Villarreal">{{cite web|author= Yezmin Villarreal |url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/music/2015/03/21/los-tigres-del-norte-are-making-gay-norte-o-history |title=Los Tigres del Norte Are Making Gay Norteño History |publisher=Advocate.com |date=2015-03-21 |access-date=2015-03-25}}</ref>

In 2018, many artists sought permission to record at Folsom prison, more so for the 50th anniversary of Johnny Cash's. However, Los Tigres del Norte was the only act authorized by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In fact, Los Tigres are the only band to record an album at Folsom since Johnny Cash released his 1968 opus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/los-tigres-del-norte-johnny-cash-folsom-prison-doc-869636/|title=See Los Tigres del Norte Perform at Folsom Prison in New Documentary|last=Exposito|first=Suzy|date=2019-08-09|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
In May 2000, Los Tigres del Norte founded the Los Tigres del Norte Foundation which is committed to fostering appreciation and preservation of Mexican and [[Mexican-American folklore]]. The Los Tigres del Norte Foundation donated $500,000 to the [[UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center]], which was used to digitize over 32,000 Spanish language recordings contained in the Strachwitz Frontera Collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostigresdelnorte.com/english/foundation.html|title=Los Tigres Del Norte|website=www.lostigresdelnorte.com}}</ref>
