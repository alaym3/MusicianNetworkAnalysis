Writing about the nature of Evans's success during the time of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], [[Amanda Petrusich]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'': "It seems possible that after nearly a year of solitude and collective self-banishment, and of crushing restrictions on travel and adventure, the chantey might be providing a brief glimpse into a different, more exciting way of life, a world of sea air and pirates and [[grog]]."<ref name=":2" />

Evans's second single, "[[Told You So (Nathan Evans song)|Told You So]]", released on 25 June 2021.
