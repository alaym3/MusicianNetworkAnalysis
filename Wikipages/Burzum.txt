'''Burzum''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|z|əm}}; {{IPA-no|ˈbʉ̀rtsʉm|lang}}) was a Norwegian music project founded by [[Varg Vikernes]] in 1991. Although Burzum never played live performances, it became a part of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] and is considered one of the most influential acts in [[black metal]]'s history.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Sam Dunn|Dunn, Sam]] |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |medium=motion picture |location=Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=Dayel|title=20 of the best black metal albums from the 1990s|date=20 July 2016|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-07-20/20-of-the-best-black-metal-albums-from-the-1990s|website=[[Team Rock]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hopper|first1=Jessica|title=The Complicated Appeal Of Black Metal|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicahopper/the-complicated-appeal-of-black-metal|website=[[Buzzfeed]]|date=29 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Sigel|first1=Zack|title=Are Music Streaming Services Doing More Harm Than Good To The Metal Community?|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/47107/heavy-metal-music-streaming-pros-cons/|website=VH1.com|date=7 August 2015}}</ref> He has also released four [[dark ambient]] and [[neofolk]] albums.

Vikernes founded Burzum in 1991 and recorded the first four Burzum albums between January 1992 and March 1993. From 1994 to 2009, Vikernes was imprisoned for the murder of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] guitarist [[Euronymous|Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth]] and the arson of three churches. While imprisoned, he recorded two dark ambient albums using only [[synthesizer]]s, as he had no access to drums, guitar, or bass. Since his release from prison in 2009, he has recorded several more albums. Vikernes announced the end of Burzum in 2018, but released the project's final album ''[[Thulêan Mysteries]]'' in 2020.

== History ==
=== Early years (1988–1992) ===<!-- NOTE: Please do not add info about Varg Vikernes that is unrelated to Burzum -->

[[File:Burzumlogodemoii.png|thumb|left|The Burzum logo used in 1991]]

Varg Vikernes began making music in 1988 with the band Kalashnikov.<ref name="story1"/> The following year, the name was changed to Uruk-Hai, after [[Uruk-hai|the creatures]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name="story1"/> In 1990 and 1991, Vikernes played guitar for the [[death metal]] band [[Old Funeral]], which also consisted of members who would later form the band [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]]. He appears on the Old Funeral [[extended play|EP]] ''Devoured Carcass''. Vikernes left Old Funeral in 1991 to concentrate on creating his own musical visions. He had a short lived project called Satanel, along Abbath Doom Occulta. He then began a solo project under the name Burzum. The word "burzum" means "darkness" in the [[Black Speech]], a language crafted by Tolkien. Soon after recording two demo tapes, he became part of the Norwegian black metal scene. With his demo tapes, he had attracted attention from [[Euronymous|Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth]] of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], who had just recently formed [[Deathlike Silence Productions]]. Aarseth then signed Burzum to the label, and shortly after, Vikernes ―under the pseudonym of Count Grishnackh―, began to record Burzum's [[Burzum (album)|self-titled debut album]]. According to Vikernes' autobiography on his website, he had intended to record the album in the worst recording quality possible (due to this being a typical trademark of the early Norwegian black metal scene), while still making it sound acceptable. Burzum's eponymous debut album was released in 1992, being the second album released on Deathlike Silence Productions. The song "War" from this album had a guest appearance from Euronymous, playing a guitar solo "just for fun", according to Vikernes.

[[File:Burzum logo.svg|thumb|right|The Burzum logo used between 1991 and 1993]]

Vikernes has stated that he had never played any live shows with Burzum, though at one point was interested in it,{{failed verification|date=November 2017}} so [[Samoth]] of Emperor accompanied him as a session bassist, though only appearing on the ''[[Aske (EP)|Aske]]'' EP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Samoth/36|title=Samoth|website=Metal-archives.com|access-date=12 November 2017}}</ref>  Additionally, Erik Lancelot was hired to be the band's drummer,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} though did not record on any Burzum material, and along with Samoth did not play a live show. Vikernes had by then lost his interest in playing live concerts, and stated that he "didn't even need session musicians anymore". Therefore, Samoth and Lancelot had parted ways with Burzum. ''[[Det som engang var]]'' was released as Burzum's second album in 1993, recorded in 1992.

=== Imprisonment (1993–2009) ===<!-- NOTE: Please do not add info about Varg Vikernes that is unrelated to Burzum -->
[[File:BurzumLogo.png|thumb|right|The Burzum logo used between 1994 and 2009]]
May 1994 saw the release of ''[[Hvis lyset tar oss]]'', a new album of previously recorded material from 1992. Burzum remained as a solo project until 1994, when Vikernes was arrested for the murder of [[Euronymous]] and the burnings of several churches in Norway. During his time in prison, Vikernes released his next album, titled ''[[Filosofem]]'', on 1 January 1996. Recorded in March 1993, ''Filosofem'' was the last recording Vikernes made before his imprisonment. ''Burzum / Aske'', a compilation comprising the ''Burzum'' album and ''Aske'' EP, was released in 1995. While imprisoned, Vikernes managed to record two other albums in a [[dark ambient]] style. They were released as ''[[Dauði Baldrs]]'' (1997) and ''[[Hliðskjálf (album)|Hliðskjálf]]'' (1999). Both of these albums were created with a synthesizer, as Vikernes was prohibited from using any other instruments in prison.

In 1998, all Burzum albums released up to that point were re-released as vinyl picture discs in a special box set called ''1992–1997''; however the ''Filosofem'' album didn't contain "Rundtgåing av den transcendentale egenhetens støtte" due to its length. The regular vinyl issue of ''Filosofem'' on Misanthropy had tracks 1–4 plus "Decrepitude II" on side 1 and "Rundtgåing av den transcendentale egenhetens støtte" on side 2.

=== Post-imprisonment and retirement (2009–2020)<!--'Byelobog Productions' redirects here--> ===

Soon after being released, Vikernes started writing new tracks (nine metal tracks and an ambient intro and outro) for an upcoming Burzum album. According to Vikernes' recounts, several record companies were interested in releasing his first album in eleven years. He stated about the new album, "I want to take my time, and make it the way I want it. It will be metal, and the fans can expect genuine Burzum."

The album was going to be originally titled ''Den hvite guden'' ("The White God"),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/07/04/magasinet/innenriks/kriminalomsorg/kirkebrann/drapsdom/7051663/ |title="Greven" angrer ingenting – magasinet – dagbladet.no |date=4 July 2009 |work=dagbladet.no |language=no |access-date=25 May 2013}}</ref> but he later decided to change it to ''[[Belus (album)|Belus]]'', which was released by the independent record label '''Byelobog Productions'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (''byelobog'' is the transliteration of "белобог" in Slavic languages, meaning "white god") on 8 March 2010.<ref name="Belus">{{cite web |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/discography/official/2010_belus.shtml |title=Burzum – Discography – Official Releases – "''Belus''" 2010 |date=December 2009 |work=burzum.org |access-date=25 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story12.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – A Burzum Story: Part XII – ''Belus'' |last=Vikernes |first=Varg |author-link=Varg Vikernes |date=November 2009 |work=burzum.org |access-date=25 May 2013}}</ref> It was also announced that a movie would be released in 2010, based on Varg Vikernes' life in the early 1990s. The movie would mainly draw inspiration from the book ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'', with the film being of the same name.

== Musical style ==
Burzum's music includes both straightforward [[black metal]] as well as [[dark ambient]], [[neofolk]]<ref name="Spracklen"/>  and [[Neo-Medieval music|neo-medieval music]]. It is often minimalist and dark, with repetition and simple song structures. Vikernes has described Burzum as a kind of "spell" or recreation of an imaginary world tied in with Pagan history.<ref name="story1"/> Each album, he claims, was designed as a kind of "spell" in itself, with each beginning song intending to make the listener more susceptible to "magic", the following songs to inspire a "trance-like state of mind", and the last song to carry the listener into a "world of fantasy" (dreams, for the listener would fall asleep—Burzum was supposed to have been evening music).<ref name="story1"/> Vikernes claims the intent to create this fantasy world came from dissatisfaction with the real world.<ref name="story1"/> He has stated the "message" of Burzum can be found in the lyrics of the first song of the first album ("Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown").<ref name="story1"/>

Burzum's lyrics and imagery are often inspired by fantasy and [[Norse mythology]], and do not feature the alt right-wing political views Vikernes is known for.<ref name="Helden"/> In a 2010 interview, Vikernes said: "Burzum is not a political or religious band, or even an anti-religious band. Burzum is music; art if you like, and the interpretation of art lies in the eye of the beholder. I might be Nordic, heterosexual and have a Pagan ideology myself, but why would I expect the fans of my music to be just like me?".<ref>[https://www.stereogum.com/295222/haunting-the-chapel-no-8/franchises/haunting-the-chapel/ Haunting The Chapel No. 8]. ''[[Stereogum]]'', 10 March 2010.</ref> 

Burzum's early work was influenced by [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]; for example, Vikernes' early moniker "Count Grishnackh" is taken from an orc character called Grishnákh in Tolkien's works.<ref name="story1"/> ''Burzum'' is a word of the [[Black Speech]] of [[Mordor]] meaning "darkness" (though Vikernes views what Christians consider "darkness" as "light"),<ref name="story1"/> and is inscribed on the [[One Ring]] in Tolkien's ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/paganism03.shtml |title=Varg Vikernes – Paganism: Part III – The One Ring |last=Vikernes |first=Varg |author-link=Varg Vikernes |work=burzum.org |access-date=25 May 2013}}</ref>
