'''The Innocence Mission''' is an American [[indie folk]] band from [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], United States, composed of Karen Peris (née McCullough), her husband (and fellow guitarist) Don Peris, and Mike Bitts (on bass guitar). Although all members of the band have contributed to their music, Karen Peris is their main writer.

==History==
The band was formed in 1980 when the members met during a Catholic school production of ''[[Godspell]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=15827892&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjM0NTU3OTYzNywiaWF0IjoxNjIyMTY4NDM5LCJleHAiOjE2MjIyNTQ4Mzl9.i0N88GCs6HOV6L_MK7D-r9cdEO6V7OERXpWiDMBFWFE|title=8 Aug 1986, 35 - The Sentinel at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=8 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-13/entertainment/ca-58244_1_innocence-mission |title=Innocence Regained : Cacophony Was Silenced When the Mission of Dreamy, Intelligent Introspection Was Heard |work=[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |first=Mike |last=Boehm |date=April 13, 1996 |access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> Before being signed to a record label, the band was originally called ''Masquerade'' and played covers at local clubs, events and at [[Lancaster Catholic High School]] (the alma mater of the band members).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-12-17/news/26202611_1_innocence-mission-karen-peris-chestnut-cabaret |title=Innocence Mission Is Catching On |first=Steven |last=Rea |work=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] |date=December 18, 1987 |access-date=June 19, 2013}}</ref> Within a few years, the band began to write original music and released a self-funded EP titled ''Tending the Rose Garden'' in 1986, of which only 1,000 copies were produced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15828180/the-philadelphia-inquirer/|title=Clipped From The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=17 December 1987|pages=84|access-date=8 October 2021|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The song "Shadows" from the EP was recorded by [[Amy Grant]] on her 1988 album ''[[Lead Me On (Amy Grant album)|Lead Me On]].

Their [[The Innocence Mission (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in 1989 on [[A&M Records]] and was produced by [[Larry Klein]], then-husband of [[Joni Mitchell]]. Recorded in Mitchell's Los Angeles studio, the album spent 10 weeks on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts, peaking at #167 in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the innocence mission|chart=Billboard 200}} |title=The Innocence Mission - Album Chart History |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |access-date=June 19, 2013}}</ref>  Klein also produced their 1991 follow up, ''[[Umbrella (The Innocence Mission album)|Umbrella]].''

Their third A&M album, ''[[Glow (The Innocence Mission album)|Glow]]'' (1995), was produced by [[Dennis Herring]], who had previously produced two records for [[Camper Van Beethoven]]. This album is a departure from Klein's heavier production style. Herring's lighter touch gave more emphasis to the group's guitar work and to Karen's vocals and lyrics. ''Glow'' contains songs that appear on the soundtracks of the films ''[[Empire Records]]'' and ''[[Dream for an Insomniac]]'', as well as the television series ''[[Party of Five]]''. The album's second track, "Bright as Yellow," peaked at #33 on Billboard’s Modern Rock Tracks.<ref name="billboard singles">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the innocence mission|chart=Alternative Songs}}|title=The Innocence Mission - Singles Chart History|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=June 19, 2013}}</ref> After the band completed the recording of a follow-up album to ''Glow'', A&M Records was bought by [[Universal Music Group]]. The group decided to mutually part ways with the label, shortly before it was merged with other companies to form [[Interscope-Geffen-A&M]].

1999's ''[[Birds of My Neighborhood]]'' inaugurated The Innocence Mission as they are today, following three albums as a quartet that drew comparisons to [[The Sundays]] and [[10,000 Maniacs]]. When drummer Steve Brown left, Karen Peris (guitars, piano, pump organ, accordion, voice), Don Peris (guitars, drums, voice) and Mike Bitts (upright bass) forged ahead with an orchestral and sometimes cinematic folk-pop sound, a sound rich in atmosphere, innately sad, but ultimately hopeful. The album was followed by the release of ''[[The Lakes of Canada]]'' EP, which contains a remix of "Snow" by Icelandic electronic group [[GusGus]], the band's only remix thus far.

The 2000 release, ''[[Christ Is My Hope]]'', featuring folk songs and hymns that had inspired them over the years, was independently distributed by their own label, LAMP, with all proceeds from sales of the record being donated to hunger relief charities. An exclusive one-album deal signed with independent label WhatAreRecords? saw ''[[Small Planes]]'' following a year later.

Their first album on Badman Records in the US and Agenda in Europe, ''[[Befriended]]'', was released in 2003 and was followed a year later by a collection of lullabies, standards, traditional and classical songs called ''[[Now the Day Is Over]]''. Recorded over two weeks in August 2004, the album contained their well-known cover of [[Henry Mancini]]'s "[[Moon River]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4487500 |title=The Innocence Mission: Lullabies for All Ages |work=[[NPR]] |date=February 5, 2005 |access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> Badman Records acquired license to re-master and re-issue the then-out-of-print ''Birds of My Neighborhood'' album in 2006.

''[[We Walked in Song]]'' was released in 2007 and included the song "Brotherhood of Man", which appeared in two acclaimed films: the documentary ''[[The Human Experience]]'' and the short film ''[https://vimeo.com/140006083 Weathered]'', starring [[Tony Hale]] and [[Nicole Parker]], which also featured a new version of the song "Our Harry". Also on this album are "Happy Birthday" and closing song "Over the Moon", both of which are featured in the [[Julia Roberts]] film ''[[Fireflies in the Garden]]''.

On June 6, 2008, "Bright as Yellow" was played as the official [[NASA]] wake-up call for the crew of Space Shuttle mission [[STS-124]] on flight day 7.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/audio/shuttle/sts-124/html/ndxpage1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604000507/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/audio/shuttle/sts-124/html/ndxpage1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 4, 2008 |title=STS-124 Wakeup Calls  |work=Audio Wakeup Call Index |publisher=NASA |access-date=November 27, 2015}}</ref>
