'''The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band''' (WCPAEB) was an American [[psychedelic rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1965. The group created music that possessed an eerie, and at times sinister atmosphere, and contained material that was bluntly political, childlike, and bizarre. Representing different musical backgrounds among band members, the group, at times, resembled a traditional [[The Byrds|Byrds]]-esque [[folk rock]] ensemble, but the WCPAEB also, within the same body of work, recorded [[avant-garde music]] marked by multi-layered [[vocal harmonies]].

Aspiring musician and scenester [[Bob Markley]] managed to join the group the Laughing Wind in exchange for his connections in the music industry and substantial bankroll. The original five-piece line-up consisted of [[Michael Lloyd (music producer)|Michael Lloyd]] ([[rhythm guitar]], [[vocals]]), [[Shaun Harris]] ([[bass guitar]], vocals), Danny Harris ([[lead guitar]], vocals), [[John Ware (musician)|John Ware]] ([[drums]]), and Markley ([[tambourine]], vocals).

The band debuted with the [[album]] ''[[Volume One (The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band album)|Volume One]]'' in 1966 on the small [[FiFo Records|FiFo]] [[record label]]. In the early years of the group, much was made of the WCPAEB's elaborate psychedelic [[Liquid light show|light shows]], which became the focal point of their live performances in Los Angeles. Following the release of ''Volume One'', the WCPAEB signed with [[Reprise Records]], recording three albums with the company, including arguably their most accomplished work ''[[Volume 3: A Child's Guide to Good and Evil]]'' in 1968. Two additional albums, ''[[Where's My Daddy?]]'' and ''[[Markley, A Group]]'', were distributed on independent labels before the group disbanded in 1970.

==History==

===Formation and first album (1966)===

The group was formed in August 1965 when Los Angeles [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] [[Bob Markley]], a wealthy law graduate and adopted son of an oil tycoon, organized a party at his home in [[Beverly Hills]]. Markley previously hosted the television program ''Oklahoma Bandstand'' in 1958, until he was signed by a [[Warner Bros. Records]] executive, and purchased a luxury mansion in Los Angeles.<ref name=dream>{{cite web|url=

Lloyd began his music career in 1962 in an instrumental [[surf rock]] band which included [[Jimmy Greenspoon]], known as the New Dimensions and later the AlleyKats. The group entered Stereo Masters studio to record three [[album]]s, during which time Lloyd first became acquainted with Fowley.<ref name=companion/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/new-dimensions-mn0000891589|title=The New Dimensions - Biography|website=allmusic.com|author=Unterberger, Richie|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.unet.nl/kesteloo/newdimensions.html|title=The New Dimensions|website=home.unet.nl|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref> While attending the [[Hollywood Professional School]], Lloyd befriended the Harris brothers, who recorded the regional hit "Ski Storm" with rival act the Snowmen. In early 1965, Shaun Harris collaborated with Lloyd in his newly formed band the Rogues, releasing the Harris-Lloyd composition "Wanted: Dead or Alive", on Fowley's Living Legend label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garagehangover.com/rogues/|title=The Rogues|website=garagehangover.com|author=Bishop, Chris|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, with Danny Harris and drummer John Ware in the fold, Lloyd and Shaun formed the Laughing Wind, which recorded the single "Good to Be Around" for [[Tower Records (record label)|Tower Records]] later that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.chello.nl/cvanderlely/wcpaeb/disco/disco10.html|title=Singles & Other Stuff|website=members.chello.nl|access-date=August 28, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031409/http://members.chello.nl/cvanderlely/wcpaeb/disco/disco10.html|archive-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref> Recordings made or produced by these pre-WCPAEB acts were collected years later on the [[compilation album]], ''[[The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band Companion]]'' in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/companion-mw0002113760|title=Companion - Review|author=Allen, James|website=allmusic.com|access-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref>

Markley became motivated by the large crowd a rock band like the Yardbirds attracted, particularly the number of teenage girls, and proposed he would finance and secure a [[recording contract]] for the Laughing Wind, in exchange for his inclusion into the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.chello.nl/cvanderlely/wcpaeb/articles/godpan.htm|title=The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band|website=members.chello.nl|author=Bluhm, Erik|access-date=October 12, 2016}}</ref> Impressed and slightly seduced by the much older Markley's wealth and entourage, the band accepted his offer. The decision to record as the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, rather than the Laughing Wind, was made by Markley, who envisioned the band as a west coast counterpart to [[the Velvet Underground]].<ref name=part1>{{cite AV media notes|title=Part One|type=CD booklet|year=2001|publisher=Sundazed Records|author=Forster, Tim|id=SC 6173}}</ref> Looking to have something tangible to represent the band, in 1966, the WCPAEB released their debut album on Markley's [[FiFo Records|FiFo]] label, ''[[Volume One (The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band album)|Volume One]]''. Much of the album was recorded at Lloyd's personal studio and a rented store-front on [[La Cienega Boulevard]], before Markley joined the group; however, tracks such as "Don't Break My Balloon" and "If You Want This Love" indicate he had some influence over the later sessions for the album's development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.chello.nl/cvanderlely/wcpaeb/disco/disco1.html|title=Vol. 1|website=members.chello.nl|access-date=October 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=vol1>{{cite AV media notes|title=Volume One|type=CD booklet|year=1997|publisher=Sundazed Records|author=Cost, Jud|id=SC-11047}}</ref> While ''Volume One'' did feature a small selection of original material, the majority of the album was [[cover version]]s including "[[Louie Louie]]", "[[You Really Got Me]]", and "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/west-coast-pop-art-experimental-band-vol-1-mw0000615660|title=Volume One - Review|website=allmusic.com|author=Unterberger, Richie|access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

===Reprise years (1967â€“1968)===

The WCPAEB embarked on their first tour in June 1966, establishing themselves as a live favorite with Los Angeles [[hippy|hippies]] at venues such as the Other Place and Wild Thing. The group shared the bill with [[the Mothers of Invention]], [[the Seeds]], [[Iron Butterfly]], and the Yardbirds, among others. According to Ware, the group's performances were "the ultimate street happening for a while"; highlighted by their ambitious [[Liquid light show|psychedelic light show]], which was operated by Buddy Walters, who also arranged light shows for [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[the Animals]].{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=2}} In a review of a gig in 1967, the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' commended the WCPAEB's musicianship, but was critical of Markley for his "hypster" attitude and non-rhythmic tambourine playing.{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=2}} Although his bandmates did not like his pretentious on and off-stage antics, Markley did manage to negotiate a three-album deal with [[talent scout]]s of [[Reprise Records]] who had attended WCPAEB's performances.<ref name=vol1/>

In May 1967, the band recorded and released their first album for Reprise, ''[[Part One]]''. By the time recording sessions began, Markley had assumed absolute control of the WCPAEB's publishing rights, which explains his unusual selection for the [[A-side]] of the album's [[single (music)|single]]s: a "spoken rap" composition "1906", co-penned with session musician Ron Morgan, and a cover of [[the Mothers of Invention]]'s song "[[Help, I'm a Rock]]".{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=2}} The album itself featured songs that exhibited a wide-ranging stylistic variety, including [[Byrds]]-esque [[folk rock]], [[garage rock]], and [[Baroque pop]]. The song "I Won't Hurt You" was one of two compositions (the other being "If You Want This Love") from the group's debut album re-recorded for ''Part One'', where it was given a much more subdued atmosphere and a heartbeat rhythm.<ref name=part1/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Bizarre Story of the Greatest Cult Band of All Time|page=5|author=Watts, Peter|year=2008|publisher=Shindig! magazine}}</ref> Shaun Harris sang the reworked version of "I Won't Hurt You", rather than Lloyd, who, aside from some [[backing vocals]] on the album, would not sing lead on a WCPAEB release until the 1969 album ''[[Where's My Daddy?]]''.{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=2}}

Markley and Lloyd did not get on, which led to the latter leaving the group and Morgan joining full-time.{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=3}} According to Lloyd, Markley became increasingly overbearing on the WCPAEB's creative output, and "he started to believe that he was like, you know, the real deal, as opposed to the guy who doesn't sing and doesn't really have any musical thoughts and stuff like that. He wasn't content anymore just being the guy who ended up with the girls that he could get from it".{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=3}} Lloyd remained in Los Angeles and participated in a number of studio projects with Fowley and [[Mike Curb]] such as [[October Country]], the Smoke, [[St. John Green]], and [[the Fire Escape]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.chello.nl/cvanderlely/wcpaeb/articles/thesmoke.html|title=The Smoke|website=members.chello.nl|author=Irvin, John|access-date=October 10, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719065405/http://members.chello.nl/cvanderlely/wcpaeb/articles/thesmoke.html|archive-date=July 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://therisingstorm.net/the-smoke-self-titled/|title=The Smoke (self-titled) 1968|website=therisingstorm.net|access-date=October 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://popdiggers.com/the-fire-escape-psychotic-reaction/|title=The Fire Escape - Psychotic Reaction|website=popdiggers.com|access-date=October 10, 2016}}</ref>

In August 1967, just prior to recording sessions for the WCPAEB's second Reprise album, Shaun Harris took a hiatus from the band. His departure was partly due to his disillusionment with the group, primarily with the WCPAEB's lack of success, and it served as a waiting period while his brother, Danny, was being treated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name=archive>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/lysergia_2/blog/index.blog/2262337/west-coast-pop-art-california-spectrum-enigma/|title=The West Coast Pop Art & California Spectrum|website=members.tripod.com|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> He formed the California Spectrum with Danny, Lloyd, and Jimmy Greenspoon. The group toured the Midwest with Markley's state-of-the-art light show, and released two singles in its brief recording career, "Sassafras" (the same version featured on ''Volume One'') and a cover of [[the Left Banke]]'s "She May Call You Up Tonight", none of which were met with much attention.<ref name=companion/><ref name=archive/> When Harris returned to the WCPAEB in 1968, he touted a completely different line-up, and promoted the California Spectrum with his column in the teen zine ''Tiger Beat'' until the group disbanded sometime in early 1969.<ref name=companion/>

In late 1967, the WCPAEB released their third album, ''[[Vol. 2 (Breaking Through)]]'', which was the band's most ambitious, albeit less consistent than its predecessor, work to date.{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=3}} The album featured a peculiar cover photo of Markley and the Harris brothers sitting bare-chested in a silver bathroom, and a bold declaration on the backside: "Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got to say everything we wanted to say, in the way we wanted to say it".{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=3}} For the first time, each track was credited either in whole or in part to members of the WCPAEB; however, Markley's manic narratives and questionable lyrical content (particularly young girls) dominate the record. An edited version of the Morgan-Markley composition "[[Smell of Incense]]" was issued just ahead of ''Vol. 2 (Breaking Through)'', but it failed to chart.<ref name=vol2>{{cite AV media notes|title=Volume 2 (Breaking Through)|type=CD booklet|year=2001|publisher=Sundazed Records|author=Forster, Tim|id=SC-6174}}</ref> The Dallas [[psychedelic pop]] group [[Southwest FOB]] covered the song in 1968, which reached No.&nbsp;56 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ter5AgAAQBAJ&q=southwest+fob+band&pg=PA104|title=Backstage Pass|author=Coley, John|page=104|publisher=LuLu Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9780578031354}}</ref> Among its ten tracks, the album included the politically-satirical "In the Arena", possibly inspired by the [[Watts riots]].<ref name=vol2/> ''Vol. 2 (Breaking Through)'' also features the anti-war song "Suppose They Gave a War and No One Comes", the full version of "Smell of Incense", and a rare instance of Markley singing is found on "Unfree Child".<ref name=vol2/>

The WCPAEB's fourth album ''[[Volume 3: A Child's Guide to Good and Evil]]'' was released in July 1968. The album represented a creative leap forward for the band and is often considered their most accomplished work.<ref name=vol3>{{cite AV media notes|title=Volume 3: A Child's Guide to Good and Evil|type=CD booklet|year=2001|publisher=Sundazed Records|author=Forster, Tim|id=SC-6175}}</ref> Band biographer Tim Forster described ''Volume 3'' as the group's "most extraordinary achievement", one which utilized a "bizarre fusion of innocence and malice" heavily affected by the "exuberance of the [[British Invasion]], folk rock, and [[flower power]]-era" being "swept away in a tide of bad drugs, paranoia, and protest".<ref name=vol3/> The album also saw Morgan experimenting with the droning quality of the electric [[sitar]], featured prominently on "Ritual #1", "Until the Poorest of People Have Money", the title track, and "Ritual #2".<ref name=vol3/> In addition, ''Volume 3'''s front cover design showcased the "butterfly mind" artwork of [[John Van Hamersveld]], who also is credited with the covers of ''[[Crown of Creation]]'', ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'', and ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]''.{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=3}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tsovet.com/chronicle/vol-1-issue-2/%EF%BF%BC%EF%BF%BC%EF%BF%BCjohn-van-hamersveld|title=John Van Hamersveld|website=tsovet.com|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> Like the WCPAEB's earlier albums, ''Volume 3'' failed to sell in sufficient quantities to reach the U.S. charts, and Reprise dropped the band.<ref name=vol3/>

===Independent labels (1969â€“1970)===

Late in 1968, [[Jimmy Bowen]] established his label [[Amos Records]] and signed the group the following year. While the band worked on the ''[[Where's My Daddy?]]'' album, Danny Harris rejoined and Lloyd returned to provide backing vocals and co-write "Where's My Daddy?", "Where Money Rules Everything", and "Coming of Age in L.A." with Markley.<ref name=where>{{cite web|url=http://members.chello.nl/cvanderlely/wcpaeb/disco/disco5.html|title=Where's My Daddy?|website=members.chello.nl|access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/la/amos/amos.html|title=Amos Album Discography|website=bsnpubs.com|access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref> It became apparent on the album, however, that the echoing vocal harmonies found on the band's preceding works were replaced by a [[close miking|closely-miked]] sound.{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=4}} The album loosely possessed the components of a [[concept album|concept piece]], narrated through the eyes of a young homeless girl named "Poor Patty" as she journeys through the chaos of post-[[Summer of Love]] Los Angeles. However, ''Where's My Daddy?'', as well as its accompanying single "Free as Bird", failed to reverse the WCPAEB's commercial fortunes, and it is regarded by critics and fans as the group's most lackluster album release.<ref name=where/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/wheres-my-daddy-mw0000845309|title=Where's My Daddy? - Review|website=allmusic.com|author=Mason, Stewart|access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref>

Lloyd negotiated with Curb to distribute the group's fifth and final album on Forward Records. Released in 1970, Markley insisted the album, originally self-titled, should be released under the name ''[[Markley, A Group]]''. The album benefited from the full involvement and production experience of Lloyd, who sang the majority of the lead vocals, provided [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], and organized the orchestral arrangements. Danny Harris was a key influence on the album, writing half of its tracks.{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=5}} However, although the album is generally considered an improvement over ''Where's My Daddy?'', the group could no longer cope with Markley's erratic behavior, and disbanded soon after the album's release.<ref name=dream/>

==Aftermath==

Markley continued his playboy lifestyle at a beach house he purchased in Los Angeles. He produced [[Jim Stallings]]' (J. J. Light) European hit "[[Heya (J.J. Light song)|Heya]]" and the album of the same name before vanishing from the music business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychedelicfolk.com/JJLight.html|title=J.J. Light|website=psychedelicfolk.com|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> According to various accounts by band members and Fowley, in 1972 Markley had evaded imprisonment and kept a low-profile after an incident involving two underage girls.{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=6}} Markley sporadically contacted his former bandmates; however, Fowley recollected a conversation with Stallings in 1992: "He [Stallings] told me that Bob had been sitting in this rowing boat on a lake near Las Vegas - he was like a recluse. It got loose from its moorings and he drifted off alone for a day and a half. He was already pretty messed up, but he got very badly dehydrated. When they eventually found him he was taken to some hospital and placed on a life-support system, unable to speak or think".{{sfn|Forster|1999|p=6}} Markley died on September 9, 2003 in a hospital in [[Gardena, California]]; he was 68.<ref name=companion/>

At age 20, Curb appointed Lloyd vice-president of [[MGM Records]]. In the 1970s, he became a successful record producer for [[teen idol]]s, including [[the Osmonds]], [[Shaun Cassidy]], and [[Leif Garrett]]. In 1986, he was [[music supervisor]] for the [[soundtrack]] of the film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', and has been involved in several other movie soundtracks well into the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxi.com/transmitter/1012/michael-lloyd-taxi-award.html|title=Michael Lloyd, Lifetime Achievement Award Recipient|website=taxi.com|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> Shaun Harris collaborated with Lloyd to release Harris's self-titled debut solo album in 1973, which explored his [[country rock]] influences. Later on, he became the president of [[Barry Manilow]]'s publishing company and most recently Harris has written a play about his life.<ref name=after>{{cite web|url=http://members.chello.nl/cvanderlely/wcpaeb/epilogue/wcepilogue.html|title=After the WCPAEB|website=members.chello.nl|access-date=October 16, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023420/http://members.chello.nl/cvanderlely/wcpaeb/epilogue/wcepilogue.html|archive-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref> Although Danny Harris was initially disillusioned with the music industry, he recorded the [[gospel music|gospel]] album ''Thank Him Every Day'' in 1980. He also worked as a [[folk music|folk]] musician and actor before dying on the set of ''[[Saving Mr. Banks]]'' from a heart attack on October 1, 2012.<ref name=after/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.legacy.com/obituaries/sanluisobispo/obituary-archived.aspx?n=daniel-duffey-harris&pid=161513874|title=Daniel Duffy Harris|website=legacy.com|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> Morgan helped found [[Three Dog Night]] (though left before they found commercial success) and joined [[the Electric Prunes]] for their album ''[[Just Good Old Rock and Roll]]''.
