===2015–16: ''55''===
In November 2015, it was reported that The Knocks' debut album, titled ''55'', was to be released in January 2016, but was delayed to a later date sometime within the early months of the year. ''55'' features collaborations with [[Fetty Wap]], [[Cam'ron]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Carly Rae Jepsen]], [[Matthew Koma]], [[Magic Man (band)|Magic Man]], [[Alex Newell]], POWERS, [[Phoebe Ryan]], [[Justin Tranter]], [[Walk the Moon]], and [[X Ambassadors]].

Work for the album began to show in August 2015, when the single "Classic", released for their ''So Classic'' EP, was re-mastered and released as a 2015 re-release, adding new feature vocals from Fetty Wap along with POWERS. Afterwards, the duo went on to uploading a brand new music video for their collaboration with Alex Newell, titled "Collect My Love" and was classed as the second re-release from their ''So Classic'' EP. Both songs from the EP were considered to be a part of the new album at the time.

In the late months of 2015, The Knocks released a new single which was the first song outside of the ''So Classic'' EP and other projects that they had previously work on, which sparked much interest about whether or not the duo was working on a new project. It was titled "I Wish (My Taylor Swift)" and was collaborated with Matthew Koma. It was eventually released in September 2015. The trailer for their debut album was released on their YouTube channel in November 2015, announcing it under the title ''55''. This teased the release of another single, titled "New York City", featuring vocals from Cam'ron, and was released the following month. Also in the same month, they re-released their official video for their 2013 single "Comfortable", featuring vocals from X Ambassadors, which was originally released under their 2013 ''Comfortable'' EP, and was classed as being another 2015 re-release.

Afterwards, in 2016, other projects also began to take place, such as their American "Route 55" Tour, which started on 15 January and ended on 13 February. Also, their first remix of the year was also released which was of [[Taylor Swift]]'s single "Welcome to New York", taken from her album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]''. This was made the last bootleg of their "Summer Bootleg Series" which was released on SoundCloud. Remixes included Carly Rae Jepsen and her single "All That", and [[Skrillex]] and [[Diplo]]'s collaborative single "[[Where Are Ü Now]]", featuring [[Justin Bieber]].

Away from the announcements of such projects, before the release of their collaboration with Wyclef Jean, they announced further that the duo were made executive producers for Jean's 2016 album. Their first single of the year, titled "Kiss The Sky", featuring vocals from Wyclef Jean, was released in January 2016. During the premiere of the track, it was reported afterwards that the release date for the debut album ''55'' was confirmed to be 4 March 2016. This was followed on by the track listings from the album being released with single "Comfortable", featuring X Ambassadors, confirmed to also be on the album. This was also among all tracks from the ''So Classic'' EP being confirmed as songs on the album, as well as the collaborations with Matthew, Cam'ron and Wyclef.

During their tour in late January, the duo were interviewed by ''The Daily Nebraskan'', stating news about the album ''55''. B-Roc, who makes up one half of the duo, stated, "I think the new album is similar to our ''So Classic'' EP. That's a good representation of what the album will be like." He also added that, "We didn't get to meet Fetty Wap, but Carly Rae was cool. Every artist we featured we previously had worked with or knew someone who knew them. The label didn't put them on our record; we wanted them on there."<ref name=nebraskan>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/arts_and_entertainment/edm-group-the-knocks-to-play-in-lincoln-friday/article_b7a11e00-c3c4-11e5-8b52-b7e8a023bf64.html|title=EDM group The Knocks to play in Lincoln Friday|work=The Daily Nebraskan|date=January 26, 2016|access-date=January 26, 2016|last=Finn|first=Keith}}</ref> After the tour in February, they announced that the duo is hoping to arrange some shows in Europe, but details of that are yet to be revealed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Brien|first1=Brittany|title=Photos & Interview: The Knocks at the Independent, a story of fate, dance, and wild shows|url=http://thebaybridged.com/2016/02/12/photos-interview-knocks-independent-story-fate-dance-wild-shows/|website=The Bay Bridged|access-date=February 14, 2016|date=February 12, 2016}}</ref>

In mid-February 2016, the duo then released their next song from ''55'', titled "Best for Last", which features vocals from Walk the Moon. In just under a week after that song was released, the song "Love Me Like That", which features vocals from Carly Rae Jepsen, was made the next single from the album. The day after it was released, one of Carly Rae Jepsen's labels known as "SB Projects", which was run by [[Scooter Braun]], signed the duo under their label to which afterwards they stated that they are "looking forward to this new chapter in our career."

Starting in the turn of the month, the duo launched a video series called "New York Knocks", which features the passers by reactions with songs off of the album ''55''. The episodes also revealed snippets or teasers of songs from the album.

''55'' was eventually released on 4 March 2016. On the day of its release, the duo uploaded every remaining unreleased song from the album onto their digital streaming profiles on [[SoundCloud]], [[Spotify]] and [[YouTube]].
