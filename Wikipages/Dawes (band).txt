The band made their television debut on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' on April 14, 2010. Dawes released their second album, ''[[Nothing Is Wrong (Album)|Nothing Is Wrong]]'', on June 7, 2011 and toured the US co-headlining with [[Blitzen Trapper]]. Original keyboardist Tay Strathairn did not appear on ''Nothing Is Wrong'' due to other commitments and was temporarily replaced by Alex Casnoff.

In February 2013, the band released the single "From a Window Seat" from the 2013 album ''[[Stories Don't End]]'' on Red General Catalog and their own Hub Records.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dawestheband.com/2013/02/new-song-from-a-window-seat/ | title=New Song: "From A Window Seat" | publisher=Official Dawes band homepage | date=2013-02-08 | access-date=2013-02-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217060332/http://dawestheband.com/2013/02/new-song-from-a-window-seat/ | archive-date=2013-02-17 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dawes-face-fears-on-from-a-window-seat-song-premiere-20130207 | title=Dawes Face Fears on "From a Window Seat"&nbsp;– Song Premiere | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=2013-02-07 | access-date=2013-02-10}}</ref>

The song "Just Beneath the Surface" from ''Stories Don't End'' was featured in the episode "Independent Movie" of the animated series ''[[American Dad!]]''

On April 22, 2015, Dawes performed on [[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show with David Letterman]], paying tribute to [[Warren Zevon]] with their cover of [[Desperados Under the Eaves|"Desparados Under the Eaves"]].  They also performed the song "Things Happen" on the show.

[[Duane Betts]] joined the band as a member of their touring ensemble in June 2015, performing as an auxiliary guitarist.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2015/05/09/duane-betts-is-now-a-member-of-dawes-touring-band | title=Duane Betts Is Now A Member of Dawes Touring Band | publisher=[[Jam Bands]] | date=2015-05-09 | access-date=2016-01-05}}</ref> Taylor and Duane alternated playing lead guitar on songs. The band's fourth album, ''[[All Your Favorite Bands]]'', was released on June 2, 2015. Three months later, the departure of keyboardist Tay Strathairn was announced in a Facebook post. Lee Pardini began playing keyboards on the band's winter 2015/2016 tour and became a permanent member of the band in July 2016.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.relix.com/reviews/detail/dawes_in_delaware | title=Dawes in Delaware | magazine=[[Relix]] | date=2015-12-21 | access-date=2016-03-27}}</ref> Betts also left the touring ensemble, and was replaced by guitarist Trevor Menear.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.relix.com/articles/detail/dawes_the_unexpected_and_the_inevitable|title=Dawes: The Unexpected and the Inevitable|magazine=Relix|last=Sutton|first=Larson|date=2016-12-16|access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref>

Dawes' fifth album, ''We're All Gonna Die'' was released on September 16, 2016, on HUB Records. The record marked a distinct change of style, building on the band's previous Laurel Canyon folk rock sound with a sonic twist, adding in more synthesized keyboard sounds, heavier bass, and an overall different sound for the group (while still staying true to their roots). ''We're All Gonna Die'' was produced by former founding member of Simon Dawes, [[Blake Mills]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://diffuser.fm/dawes-were-all-gonna-die-announced/ | title=Dawes Announce New 'We're All Gonna Die' Album, Release 'When the Tequila Runs Out' Single | publisher=[[diffuser.fm]] | date=2016-08-17 | access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> In November 2016, they announced their "An Evening with Dawes" tour, which began in January 2017. The "Evening With" tour is distinct from past tours because, instead of having an opening act, they perform 2-3 hour shows with a small intermission.

''[[Passwords (album)|Passwords]]'', Dawes' sixth studio album, released on June 22, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/04/dawes-announce-their-forthcoming-album-passwords.html|title=Dawes Announce Their Sixth Album, Passwords, Due out in June|date=April 27, 2018|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|last=Vallejo-Lopez|first=Abdiel|access-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref> The album saw the return of producer Jonathan Wilson, and is "for and about the modern age: the relationships that fill it, the politics that divide it, and the small victories and big losses that give it shape."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meaww.com/dawes-music-video-living-in-the-future-new-album-passwords|title=Dawes debut music video for 'Living in the Future,' first single from upcoming 'Passwords'|last=Prabhu|first=Suraj|website=Meaww.com|date=2018-05-15|access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref> The band launched a marketing campaign for the album that encouraged fans to search for "passwords" posted throughout the Internet. Once a password was found, it could be entered onto a page of the band's official website where each part of the password represented a musical note. When entered correctly, these musical notes played various musical refrains from Dawes songs and unlocked exclusive content, including the singles "Never Gonna Say Goodbye" and "Telescope," as well as a [[Spotify]] playlist curated by Griffin Goldsmith.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/06/exclusive-dawes-share-new-single-never-gonna-say-g.html|title=Exclusive: Dawes Launch ''Passwords'' Site, Share New Single "Never Gonna Say Goodbye"|last=Johnson|first=Ellen|magazine=Paste Magazine|date=2018-06-07|access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref> In 2020, the members of Dawes played a few shows with [[Phil Lesh]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] after connecting through Jason Crosby.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dawes Covers Grateful Dead: Live at Relix |url=https://relix.com/video/dawes-covers-grateful-dead-live-at-relix/ |website=[[Relix]] |access-date=August 19, 2020 |date=March 18, 2020}}</ref>
