==History==
Prior to the formation of City Morgue in 2017, Junius Rogers, professionally known as ZillaKami, worked extensively with [[6ix9ine]] in the underground hip-hop scene in New York City and allegedly [[Ghostwriting|ghostwrote]] many of 6ix9ine's early songs. His other collaborator was his older half-brother Peter Rogers, known professionally as Righteous P, the CEO of music label Hikari-Ultra.<ref name="No Jumper"/> The brothers had a falling out with 6ix9ine after he allegedly refused to pay back money owed and ripped instrumentals from the group. In response, ZillaKami and other detractors publicly circulated information about 6ix9ine's child sexual performance charge.<ref name="No Jumper"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/08/rundown-public-beef-6ix9ine/|title=Here's a Rundown of Every Public Beef Involving 6ix9ine|last=Preezy|website=XXL|date=August 15, 2018|accessdate=October 9, 2018}}</ref>

ZillaKami had met Vinicius Sosa, known professionally as SosMula, on his first day out of jail, and started creating songs some time after meeting with record producer Bouabdallah Sami Nehari, known professionally as Thraxx. Together, the trio had made many projects since then under their names, such as the tracks with visuals Shinners 13, 33rd Blakk Glass, and Sk8 Head, numerous singles, and an album ''City Morgue Vol 1: Hell or High Water''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}
