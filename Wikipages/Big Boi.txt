He released his second studio album ''[[Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors]]'' in 2012. ''[[Boomiverse]]'', his third studio album, was released in June 2017.

== Early life ==
Patton was born and spent the first half of his childhood in [[Savannah, Georgia]], attending [[Jenkins High School|Herschel V. Jenkins High School]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flixster.com/actor/big-boi|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731101556/http://www.flixster.com/actor/big-boi|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 31, 2012|title=Antwan 'Big Boi' Patton|publisher=Flixster.com|access-date=April 28, 2012}}</ref> before moving to [[Atlanta]] with his aunt Renee. He decided to pursue his interest in music at [[Tri-Cities High School]], a visual and performing arts [[magnet school]].

== Career ==

=== Outkast ===
Patton met André Lauren Benjamin (stage name [[André 3000]]) while attending Tri-Cities High School. The two joined forces as [[Outkast]] in 1992 and signed with [[LaFace Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.wbez.org/agill/2010/07/big-boi-does-the-wikipedia-files/26775|title=Big Boi does the Wikipedia Files|author=Andrew Gill|date=July 20, 2010|work=wbez.org|publisher=Chicago Public Radio|access-date=September 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825191409/http://music.wbez.org/agill/2010/07/big-boi-does-the-wikipedia-files/26775|archive-date=August 25, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Solo career ===
After four successful albums, Big Boi and André 3000 chose to make two solo albums, and release it as a double album under the Outkast name, as ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'' in 2003; Big Boi recorded ''Speakerboxxx'', André 3000 recorded ''The Love Below''. ''Speakerboxxx'' featured a style similar to Outkast's previous efforts, while ''The Love Below'' explored a more offbeat territory, with André 3000 mainly singing rather than his usual rapping.

Big Boi released two of his songs as singles. "[[The Way You Move]]", featuring [[Sleepy Brown]], was originally supported by urban radio, but crossed over to pop charts, where it supplanted André 3000's "[[Hey Ya!]]" as the #1 song. The second single from Big Boi was "Ghetto Musick", which featured both members of Outkast and a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from [[Patti LaBelle]]'s "[[Love, Need and Want You]]".{{cn|date=January 2020}}

In November 2005, Big Boi released a mixtape/compilation album, ''[[Got Purp? Vol 2]]'', in conjunction with the [[Purple Ribbon All-Stars]] through [[Purple Ribbon Records]]. The first single from the album was "Kryptonite", which reached 35 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Outkast was also featured on the song "[[International Players Anthem (I Choose You)]]", the first single from [[UGK]]'s album ''[[Underground Kingz]]''.

In 2007, after ''[[Idlewild (OutKast album)|Idlewild]]'', the sixth official OutKast duo album, Big Boi announced plans to release a proper solo album. ''Speakerboxxx'' had been seen by many as a solo album (and in fact it effectively was one), but it was still released under the OutKast name, which made ''[[Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty]]'' his first "full-fledged" solo album. The album's first promotional single, "Royal Flush", was released in 2007, and featured [[Raekwon]] and André 3000. Over the next few years the album was delayed many times, but multiple promotional and video singles were released, such as "Shine Blockas" (featuring [[Gucci Mane]]), "For Yo Sorrows" (featuring [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Too Short]]), and "General Patton" (featuring [[Big Rube]]). The first official single was "[[Shutterbugg]]", featuring Cutty, and the second was "Follow Us", featuring Vonnegutt. The album was formally released in July 2010. Guest artists included alternative urban singer [[Janelle Monáe]], who went on to be a famed actor and entertainer in her own right, as well as [[T.I.]], [[B.o.B.]], and, on a hook, Big Boi's old Dungeon Family friend [[Khujo]].<ref>[http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/559/boi_o_boi/ Big Boi interview by Pete Lewis, ''Blues & Soul'', July 2010]</ref> ''Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty'' was warmly received by most music critics, earning praise for its inventive sound, varied musical style, and Big Boi's lyricism.<ref name="Metacritic">[https://www.metacritic.com/music/sir-lucious-left-foot-the-son-of-chico-dusty ''Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty'' (2010): Reviews].
