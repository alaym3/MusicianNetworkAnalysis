'''Paul Francis Gadd''' (born 8 May 1944),<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave "[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gary-glitter-mn0000660401/biography Gary Glitter Biography]", [[AllMusic]], [[TiVo Corporation]]</ref> known professionally as '''Gary Glitter''', is an English former [[glam rock]] singer who achieved success in the 1970s and 1980s, known for his extreme glam image of glitter suits, make-up and [[platform boot]]s, and his energetic live performances. He sold over 20 million records, had 26 hit singles which spent a total of 180 weeks in the [[UK Singles Chart]]; twelve reaching the Top 10, with three charting at number-one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polyhex.com/music/chartruns/chartruns.php/chartruns.php |title=polyhex.com UK Singles Chart runs |access-date=18 June 2007 }}</ref> He is listed in the Top 100 UK most successful chart acts.<ref>{{cite book|author=Giulio D'Agostino|title=Glam Musik: British Glam Music '70 History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdDZeCqeQwsC&pg=PA199|date=1 January 2001|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-16563-6|pages=199–}}</ref> He was imprisoned for downloading [[child pornography]] in 1999, and [[child sexual abuse]] and attempted rape in 2006 and 2015. In 2015 Glitter was described by [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "public hate figure".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/01/gary-glitter-fans-paul-gadd-facebook|work=The Guardian|title=The Gary Glitter fans who still follow the leader|author=[[Alexis Petridis]]|date=1 March 2015}}</ref> His performances on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' are not repeated.

After performing under the name Paul Raven in the 1960s, he changed his stage name to Gary Glitter in the glam rock era of the early 1970s, with a sustained solo UK chart run of hits including "[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2]]", "[[Do You Wanna Touch Me]]", "[[I Love You Love Me Love]]", "[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]", and "[[Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again]]". Glitter's popularity waned in the late 1970s, followed by a successful comeback as a solo artist again from the 1980s. His 1984 song "[[Another Rock and Roll Christmas]]" is one of the most played [[Christmas music|Christmas]] hits of all time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/12/christmas_without_glitter.html |title=Christmas without Glitter? |access-date=18 June 2007 |author=Dave Simpson |date=14 December 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK }}</ref> In 1998, his recording of "Rock and Roll" was listed as one of the top 1,001 songs in music history.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHWL2eWgjaYC&pg=PA539 |title=The Heart of Rock & Soul |isbn=9780306809019 |access-date=31 January 2009 |last1=Marsh |first1=Dave |date=7 May 1999 }}</ref> Glitter also released seven studio albums, and at least fifteen [[Compilation album|compilation]] or live albums.

Later, Glitter faced criminal charges and [[deportation]] from several countries in connection with actual and suspected [[child sexual abuse]]. He was deported from [[Cambodia]] on suspected child sexual abuse charges in 2002.

==Early life==
Paul Francis Gadd was born on 8 May 1944 in [[Banbury]], Oxfordshire, England.<ref name="Gaddfather">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/517863.stm | title=All that Glitters isn't gold | work=BBC News | date=12 November 1999 | access-date=28 January 2015}}</ref> His mother, a cleaner, was unmarried, and initially brought him up with the help of her mother; he never knew his father.<ref name=Gaddfather/> Gadd was hard to control and at the age of 10, along with his brother, was taken into local authority care.<ref name=Gaddfather/> Although nominally a [[Protestant]], he was educated at a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] school.<ref name="Gary Glitter 1991">Gary Glitter ''Leader: The Autobiography of Gary Glitter'' ([[Ebury Publishing|Ebury Press]], 1991). {{ISBN|0-85223-977-7}}.</ref> Gadd frequently ran away to London, visiting the [[nightclub|clubs]] that were to be the launching ground of his career.<ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/>

==Career==

===Early work===
By the time he was 16, Gadd was already performing at London clubs. His career grew as he appeared at such venues as the [[The 2i's Coffee Bar|Two I's]], in [[Soho]], and the Laconda and Safari Clubs. His repertoire consisted of early rock and roll [[Standard (music)|standard]]s and gentle [[ballad]]s.<ref name="Thompson"/> Gadd gained his first break when film producer [[Robert Hartford-Davis]] discovered him and financed a recording session for [[Decca Records]]. In January 1960, at 15, under the stage name Paul Raven, he released his first single, "Alone in the Night".<ref name="timesonline.co.uk">{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4573311.ece |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |title= Nowhere to call home |date= 21 August 2008 | first=Valentine | last=Low | access-date=3 May 2010}}</ref> <!-- The exact timings here need to be tightened up -->

A year later, with a new manager, Vic Billings, Raven signed a new recording contract with [[Parlophone]] and worked with record producer [[George Martin]], before Martin's association with [[the Beatles]]. Martin produced two singles, "Walk on Boy" and "[[Tower of Strength (Gene McDaniels song)|Tower of Strength]]", but neither sold very well and Raven's recording career stalled. By 1964, Raven was reduced to working as an assistant, and playing the warm-up for the British music television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''. He did numerous television commercials and film auditions, and in the course of those activities met arranger and record producer [[Mike Leander]], who eventually helped revive his career. Raven auditioned for the role of the protagonist in the film ''[[Privilege (film)|Privilege]]'' (1967), which was written and directed by [[Peter Watkins]], known for the television drama ''[[The War Game]]''.

===Gary Glitter===
[[File:Gary Glitter - TopPop 1973 3.png|thumb|Glitter in 1973, during an appearance on ''[[TopPop]]'']]
Raven joined the Mike Leander Show Band in early 1965. He was then deputised to produce a few recording sessions by such artists as Thane Russell and a Scottish [[freakbeat]] band, [[the Poets]]. After Leander's group disbanded, Raven formed Boston International with saxophonist John Rossall, and spent the following five years touring the UK and [[West Germany]], recording occasionally. From 1968 to 1970, several singles including "Musical Man", "Goodbye Seattle" and a cover version of the Beatles' "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" were released, his name briefly changed to Paul Monday. He sang the role of a priest in the original 1970 concept album of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (album)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.<ref>[http://www.jesuschristsuperstarzone.com/knowledge-base/discography/original-concept-recording/ "Original Concept Recording (1970) – ''Jesus Christ Superstar''], recording information, Jesus Christ Superstar Zone (reference for this and subsequent sections)</ref> As the [[Glam rock|glam]] movement took off in 1971, Raven adopted the new stage name Gary Glitter, which he devised by playing alliteratively with letters of the alphabet, working backwards from Z. Other options included Terry Tinsel, Stanley Sparkle and Vicky Vomit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4766890.stm|title=Profile: Gary Glitter|work=BBC News|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref>

The song that made Gary Glitter's name began as a 15-minute [[jam session]]; whittled down to a pair of three-minute extracts it was released in 1972 as the [[A-side and B-side]]s of a single called "[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2]]". Part 2 proved to be the more popular side in many countries, although it took about six months before it made its full impact, going to No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reaching the Top Ten in the United States, one of the few British glam rock records to do so. "Rock and Roll Part 1" was also a hit: in France it made number-one, and in the UK both sides were listed together on the charts.

===Mainstream success===
"Rock and Roll" was followed by other successes over the next three years. Glitter, backed by the [[Glittermen]]/[[the Glitter Band]] on stage, competed with [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Slade]] and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] for domination of the charts. To reinforce his image, he reportedly owned 30 glitter suits and fifty pairs of silver [[platform boot]]s. He also released several singles which became UK Top 10 hits, with "[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]" being his first single to reach the number-one position in the summer of 1973, and "[[I Love You Love Me Love]]", its follow-up, his second. Even an atypical ballad, "[[Remember Me This Way (Gary Glitter song)|Remember Me This Way]]", went to No. 3. He had eleven consecutive Top 10 singles, from "Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2" in 1972 to "[[Doing Alright with the Boys]]" in the summer of 1975.<ref name="UKcharts">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/gary%20glitter/ | title=UK Charts – Gary Glitter | publisher=officialscharts.com | access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref> "Rock and Roll (Part 2)" caught on as a popular [[Stadium anthem|sports anthem]] in North America.<ref name=yahoo/>

Despite his success in the UK, Glitter never made the same impact in America where, at best, glam rock was seen as a curiosity. Glitter had one more entry on the US charts with "[[I Didn't Know I Loved You (Till I Saw You Rock and Roll)]]"; after that, the closest chart success for Glitter was a cover recording of "[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]" by [[Brownsville Station (band)|Brownsville Station]].

After "Doing Alright with the Boys", Glitter won the award for Best Male Artist at the ''Saturday Scene'' music awards hosted by [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]. His next release was a cover of [[the Rivingtons]]' novelty [[Nonsense|nonsensical]] doo-wop song "[[Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow]]", but it got no higher than No. 38 on the British charts.<ref name=UKcharts/> After subsequent releases stalled in similar fashion, Glitter announced his retirement from the music industry to start a family life with his new partner in early 1976. That same year, his first hits package, simply titled ''Greatest Hits'', was released. It entered the UK Top 40 best-seller charts. A similar budget album, entitled ''I Love You Love Me Love'', was issued by [[Sonar Entertainment|Hallmark Entertainment]] the following year.

===Comeback and business interests===
In 1976, Glitter faced declining record sales. He took a two-year-long exile, living in France and Australia, before returning to the UK, and beginning his comeback.

Glitter's career took a downturn towards the end of the 1970s, leading him to declare bankruptcy in 1977, though he later blamed the high [[tax rate]] in the UK at the time.<ref name=Russell/><ref name=feb15>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31111208|title=Gary Glitter: Glamour rock star to paedophile|work=BBC News|date=5 February 2015|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> He entered bankruptcy a second time over unpaid tax in the 1990s. Under financial pressure, not even a pair of Top 40 hit singles ("[[It Takes All Night Long]]" and "[[A Little Boogie Woogie in the Back of My Mind]]") could lift him all the way back. It took the [[post-punk]] audience, and some of its artists who still respected Glitter's work, to do that; he had been an influence on post-punk, [[new wave music|new wave]], [[Britpop]] and [[glam metal]], as well as early [[punk rock]] itself.<ref>{{cite web | title = Punk History | publisher = The Punk Music Scene | url = http://www.caughtoffguard.co.uk/punk_history.html | quote = individuals such as Gary Glitter have all been honoured as strong influences in [[Punk rock]] evolution | access-date = 25 April 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314231819/http://www.caughtoffguard.co.uk/punk_history.html | archive-date = 14 March 2012 | url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first = Christopher | last = Duda | title = The Vibrators – Interview with Knox | publisher = SugarBuzz Magazine | url = http://www.sugarbuzzmagazine.com/bands/vibrators/vibrators.html | quote = I liked Gary Glitter, Hello, Slade; they were all laying the roots to punk. | access-date = 25 April 2013}}</ref> Around this time, Glitter settled into being a performer with a niche following that continued until his conviction for downloading [[child pornography]] in 1999. This helped provide the opportunity for Glitter to cut a dance medley of his greatest hits, "All That Glitters", which charted in 1981. Within three years, he was playing 80 shows a year at colleges and [[nightclub]]s and had chart hits "[[Dance Me Up]]" (UK No. 25) and "[[Another Rock and Roll Christmas]]" (UK No. 7).<ref name=UKcharts/>

Glitter's comeback was boosted in the 1980s by various guest spots and collaborations. In 1982, he appeared on the [[British Electric Foundation]] album ''Music of Quality and Distinction Volume One'' (UK No. 25) along with fellow pop/rock luminaries [[Sandie Shaw]] and [[Tina Turner]]. In 1988, [[The KLF|the Timelords]]' "Doctoring the Tardis", a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' tribute that sampled "Rock and Roll (Part 2)", reached the number-one spot. In due course, Glitter re-cut "Rock and Roll" with producer [[Trevor Horn]] and also "I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)" with [[Girlschool]]. In the late 1980s, his hit singles were used to compile the Telstar-released ''C'mon... C'mon – The Gary Glitter Party Album''. In 1989, [[Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers]] put a large sample of "Another Rock and Roll Christmas" on their number-one UK hit "[[Let's Party (Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers song)|Let's Party]]". In 1987 Glitter received a ten-year driving ban and narrowly escaped imprisonment after a third conviction for [[Drunk driving law by country|drunk driving]].<ref name="Glitter profile"/>

During the 1980s Glitter became a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and a vegetarian.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30779121 | title=Profile: Gary Glitter | date=5 February 2015 | work=BBC News | access-date=27 February 2015}}</ref> He opened a restaurant in [[Leicester Square]] in 1991, with Gary's Glitter Bar being promoted under the slogan "Leader of the Snack", but the restaurant closed a few years later.<ref name="Leaderofthesnack">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/garyglitter/2603054/Gary-Glitter-his-personal-wealth.html | title=Gary Glitter: his personal wealth | work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London | date=22 August 2008 | access-date=8 March 2015}}</ref><!--- "Garry's Glitter Bar" was, in fact a "tiny sandwich shop" on the corner of Leicester Square. "It went out of business very quickly: see [http://yukioyung.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/exhibit-7-garys-glitter-bar-leader-of.html] ---> Glitter also launched his own record label in the early 1990s, Attitude Records, after he lost his deal with [[Virgin Records]]. He had signed to Virgin after leaving [[Arista Records]] in 1984 after twelve years with the label. Attitude records was merged into Machmain Ltd later in the 1990s, a music company owned by Glitter.

Glitter spent the next decade mostly as an in-demand live performer, and his back catalogue of recordings proved durable enough for several compilations to be successfully released. He appeared in billboard and poster advertisements for [[British Rail]], in one of which he was shown attempting to look younger to obtain a [[16–25 Railcard|Young Persons Railcard]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.advertisingarchives.co.uk/detail/39611/1/Magazine-Advert/Young-Persons-Railcard/1990s | title=Young Persons Railcard | publisher=advertisingarchives.co.uk | access-date=28 January 2015}}</ref> He also released a new studio album ''[[Leader II]]'' in 1991.

''The Leader'', his best-selling autobiography, was published in 1991.<ref name="leader">{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/302611/gary-glitter/biography | title=Gary Glitter – Biography | work=Billboard| access-date=9 March 2015}}</ref> He was a surprise hit at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] concert in Chicago, which was telecast live to forty-six countries.<ref name=leader/> He played the Godfather in the 1996 [[The Who Tour 1996–1997|revival tour]] of [[the Who]]'s ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.<ref name="Talevski2010">{{cite book|author=Nick Talevski|title=Rock Obituaries – Knocking on Heaven's Door|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DykffzkFALoC&pg=PA158|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Omnibus|isbn=978-0-85712-117-2|pages=158–}}</ref> He also released a new single, a cover version of "[[The House of the Rising Sun]]". The English rock band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] used a sample from Glitter's 1973 chart hit "[[Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again]]" on their 1995 multi-million-selling album ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', one of a number of acts that borrowed from his songbook.

===Career moves since 2000===
In 2002, [[Snapper Music]] re-promoted ''[[The Ultimate Gary Glitter – 25 Years of Hits]]'', a two-disc compilation album of Glitter's music initially released in 1997, days after his arrest, which covers his commercial breakthrough in 1972 through to 1984 while also including a song that was later released on ''On'', and singles by his former backing band [[the Glitter Band]] without him; again it was moderately successful.

In September 2001 he released a new studio album, ''[[On (Gary Glitter album)|On]]'', which included material written before his 1999 British conviction. That material was to have been part of a project called ''Lost on Life Street'' until that album's release was cancelled following his arrest. By December 2004, after releasing a new single, "Control", Glitter was in the news again concerning his behaviour; NGOs had been petitioning the government with their own evidence aimed at arresting Glitter. He moved to Vietnam.

In 2005 ''[[Remember Me This Way (film)|Remember Me This Way]]'', the documentary filmed at Glitter's career peak in 1973 (and originally released in 1974), was issued for the first time on DVD. Glitter's music itself still had an audience, further demonstrated by three new album releases, although all of them contained past recordings from the vaults, rather than new product. The first two new albums were issued at the same time, ''The Remixes'' and ''Live in Concert'' (the latter of which was a 1981 recording). These were only for sale on the Internet. A new collection of Glitter's chart hit singles followed, ''The Best of Gary Glitter''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/glitter_gary/958559/album.jhtml |title= Gary Glitter Album Download|publisher=[[VH1]]}}</ref> In 2006 his back catalogue was made available via the Internet from sites such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] and [[eMusic]].

In 2011 a collection of hits and B-sides was issued under the title ''All that Glitters''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Glitters-Best-Glitter/dp/B005PYFQ14/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1350605736&sr=8-8 |title=All That Glitters – The Best of Gary Glitter: Amazon.co.uk: Music |access-date=11 November 2012}}</ref>

News reports stated that, as of late July 2013, Glitter may have earned a total of £1,000,000 from royalties derived from the Oasis song "Hello" that sampled "Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again". Music industry lawyer Craig Brookes cited this monetary sum in addition to the royalties from his back catalogue of songs—£300,000 a year or more—and the estimated £200,000 Glitter was awarded for [[copyright infringement]] after he enacted legal action against Oasis in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gary Glitter may earn £1m from Oasis royalties |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/29/gary-glitter-royalties-oasis-1m |access-date=30 July 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 July 2013 |author=Gibsone, Harriet}}</ref> In 2014, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that "Rock and Roll Part 2", co-written by Glitter with [[Mike Leander]], was earning an estimated $250,000 a year in royalties due to its use in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/6273999/why-convicted-child-sex-offender-gary-glitters-hey | title=Why Convicted Child-Sex Offender Gary Glitter's 'Hey Song' Is Still Getting Played | work=Billboard| date=3 October 2014 | access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref>

In October 2019 there was controversy over the use of "Rock and Roll Part 2" in the commercially successful film ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' due to the possibility of Glitter, as co-writer of the song, receiving a lump sum and royalties for its use.<ref>{{cite news |last=Meredith |first=Sam |date=7 October 2019 |title=Convicted pedophile Gary Glitter set to earn big royalties from 'Joker' movie |url= https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/joker-convicted-pedophile-gary-glitter-set-to-earn-big-royalties.html|publisher= CNBC|access-date= 7 October 2019}}</ref> According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Glitter does not receive payment when the song is used as he has sold the rights, and the US rights to the song are now owned by [[Universal Music Publishing Group]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2019-10-11/joker-gary-glitter-rock-and-roll-part-2 | title=Will a convicted pedophile make a fortune from a 'Joker' song? | first=Steve|last=Appleford|work=Los Angeles Times | date=11 October 2019 | access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref>

==Concert tours and live performances==
During his long career as a singer, Glitter undertook many tours to various venues around the world. His first tour was of the Middle East, as Paul Raven and the Boston International in 1967. He toured amongst other places, Cyprus, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Armenia.

In 1973, Glitter appeared at the [[London Palladium]]. It was a sell-out concert.<!-- Many previous rock & roll acts in the ''Sunday Night at the Palladium'' programme. --><ref name="bb">{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/302611/gary-glitter/biography | title=Gary Glitter | work=Billboard| access-date=8 January 2015}}</ref> In the same year his performance at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] was recorded and released as a live album, ''[[Remember Me This Way (album)|Remember Me This Way]]''.<ref name=bb/> Glitter undertook a world tour, performing in Europe, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand. He continued to tour until 1976, and his temporary retirement from music.

During his comeback period of the 1980s, he did fewer tours, and mainly toured Britain. He did shows in Ireland, Germany, France, America and Bahrain. During the 1990s, he toured America several times, finally gaining the significant popularity he sought in the 1970s. His final tour, entitled "A Night Out with the Boys: Could This Be for the Last Time?" took place in 1997.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1429555/gary-glitters-last-stand/ | title=Gary Glitter's Last Stand? | publisher=[[MTV]] | date=22 December 1997 | access-date=8 January 2015}}</ref> In 2005, Glitter had been living in Vietnam without the knowledge of the authorities.

==Influence on other musicians==
Glitter was an influence on a number of musicians and genres from the 1970s onwards, especially [[List of punk bands from the United Kingdom|British punk]], [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[gothic rock]], [[Britpop]] and [[glam metal]].

*[[Mark E. Smith]] was a Glitter fan. "I was really into Gary Glitter, and I used to get bad-mouthed for it. It was like 'You've got to be into [[David Bowie]] or [[Yes (band)|Yes]]&nbsp;– Gary Glitter's just tripe'. And I was going 'It's fuckin' great. It's [[avant-garde]]... Well, two drummers and all that&nbsp;– it was really percussive. It was the only decent thing around", the [[The Fall (band)|Fall]] frontman said in 1993, speaking to ''[[NME]]''.<ref name="harris_93">{{cite web | author=Harris, John | date=3 April 1993 | url=http://www.visi.com/fall/gigography/93apr03.html | title=Mark E.

*[[Knox (musician)|Knox]] from [[the Vibrators]] cited glam rock acts, including Glitter, as an influence on punk, stating that "Glam was fairly good at the time; also it was almost all we had. It could look ridiculous but musically it was often alright. Sometimes when you listen back bits of it sound quite punk. I liked Gary Glitter, [[Hello (band)|Hello]], [[Slade]]; they were all laying the roots to punk. Some of Bowie and [[Lou Reed]] were very good and [[Marc Bolan|[Marc] Bolan]] of course. I suppose it had a bit of influence, but not a lot."
*[[CeeLo Green]] has been influenced by Glitter's music, telling ''NME'' in 2014, "I'm very aware of the crimes (Glitter) committed so I would not like to have this misconstrued. But I appreciate the musical contribution and (what he did) sonically."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/cee-lo-green/74711 | title=Cee Lo: 'I'm aware of Gary Glitter's crimes, but I appreciate his music' | date=4 January 2014 | work=NME| access-date=12 March 2015}}</ref>

Glitter was banned from driving for 10 years in 1986, following a conviction for [[Drink driving (United Kingdom)|drink-driving]]. This was his third drink-driving conviction, and he narrowly avoided being sent to prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/13/geoffreygibbs1|title=The sordid downfall of a glam icon|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs|date=13 November 1999|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/517863.stm|title=BBC News – UK – All that Glitters isn't gold|publisher=BBC|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref>

On 20 January 2008, the ''[[News of the World]]'' reported that Glitter had suffered a severe heart attack. These reports were denied, although it was confirmed that he had been diagnosed with heart problems. "Glitter was admitted to our hospital with acute diarrhoea", said Nguyen Huu Quang, the director of the hospital in [[Bình Thuận Province]], near the prison where Glitter was serving out his sentence. "While we were treating him, we found out that he also has a [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular disorder]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=125329 |work=[[Bangkok Post]] |title=Breaking News}}{{dead link|date=May 2016}}</ref>

==Sex offences==

In November 1997, Glitter was arrested after a technician discovered pornographic images of children on the hard drive of a laptop that he had taken to a computer retailer in Bristol for repairs. Further images were discovered by police in searches of his homes in London and Somerset.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1997/nov/20/alexbellos|title=Gary Glitter facing child porn inquiry|first=Alex|last=Bellos|date=20 November 1997|website=The Guardian|access-date=16 June 2018}}</ref> He was castigated in the media over the allegations; additionally, his appearance in the [[Spice Girls]]' musical comedy film ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'' was cut, though a truncated edit of the scene, featuring a version of Glitter's "I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)", was left in the film.

At [[Bristol Crown Court]] on 12 November 1999, Mr Justice Butterfield sentenced Glitter to four months in prison and placed him on the [[sex offender]] register in the UK after he admitted downloading more than 4,000 items of [[child pornography]].<ref name="Glitter jailed over child porn"/> He was cleared of a charge of having sex with a 14-year-old girl with whom he had a relationship in the late 1970s.<ref name="Gary Glitter 1991"/> It was later revealed that the woman sold her story to the ''[[News of the World]]'' and stood to earn more money from the newspaper should Glitter be convicted.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/550343.stm |work=BBC News  |title= Press warned over witness payments | date=5 December 1999 | access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref>

Following rejection by the British public and facing scrutiny from the press following his arrest and conviction, Glitter fled on his yacht ''Voyageur'' to Spain.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/garyglitter/2603054/Gary-Glitter-his-personal-wealth.html | title=Gary Glitter: his personal wealth | work=The Daily Telegraph| date=22 August 2008 | access-date=21 January 2015}}</ref> He lived at [[Sotogrande]] in [[Andalusia]] for six months, in his yacht, which was moored at the marina. He told the locals that his name was Larry Brilliante, and spent his time frequenting local bars and surfing the Internet. After his real identity became known in Sotogrande, he moved to [[Cuba]] and later to [[Cambodia]], where he rented an apartment in [[Phnom Penh]]. In late 2002, he was detained over his previous sex offences and spent four days in jail before being released on bail. In January 2003, he was deported from Cambodia to [[Thailand]] on a flight to [[Bangkok]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/cambodia/1418206/Cambodia-throws-out-Gary-Glitter.html|title=Cambodia throws out Gary Glitter|first=Hugh Davies, Entertainment|last=Correspondent|date=18 September 2018|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1959604.stm|title=Glitter faces expulsion from Cambodia|date=30 April 2002|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Graham |last=Tibbetts |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2583174/Gary-Glitter-released-from-prison-and-heading-back-to-Britain.html | title=Gary Glitter released from prison and heading back to Britain | work=The Daily Telegraph| date=19 August 2008 | access-date=21 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2635489.stm |title=Glitter deported from Cambodia |access-date=18 June 2007 |date=7 January 2003 |work=BBC News  }}</ref> He subsequently settled in [[Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4451992.stm |title=Gary Glitter arrested in Vietnam |access-date=18 June 2007 |date=19 November 2005 |work=BBC News  }}</ref>

From March 2005, Glitter resided in [[Vũng Tàu]], Vietnam, where he rented a luxury seaside villa, and applied for permanent Vietnamese residency. He came to the attention of Vietnamese authorities after being banned from a nightclub for allegedly groping a teenage waitress; eyewitnesses also reported seeing him take two young girls into his home. On 12 November 2005, he fled his home. A 15-year-old girl was found living in his flat and was questioned by authorities. Police began searching for Glitter, and he was arrested on 20 November at [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]] in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] while trying to board a flight to Bangkok. Six Vietnamese girls and women, aged from 11 to 23, claimed that Glitter had had sex with them.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4454486.stm | title= Glitter 'had sex with girl, 12' | work=BBC News| date=21 November 2005 | access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/20/arts.childprotection|title=Glitter arrested over child sex as he tries to flee Vietnam|first1=Antony|last1=Barnett|first2=John|last2=Aglionby|date=20 November 2005|website=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-11-20/gary-glitter-arrested-in-vietnam-reports/744212|title=Gary Glitter arrested in Vietnam: reports|date=20 November 2005|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>

After his arrest, Glitter was turned over to provincial police from Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu and returned to Vũng Tàu and held on suspicion of having sex with the two underage girls. Glitter was held in jail throughout the criminal investigation, which was completed on 26 December 2005. The charge of rape was dropped for "lack of evidence" (according to Glitter's lawyer), although Glitter admitted that an 11-year-old girl had slept in his bed. Glitter could have faced [[Capital punishment in Vietnam|execution by firing squad]] if found guilty of child rape.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/glitter-may-face-firing-squad-over-child-sex-allegations-516355.html|title=Glitter may face firing squad over child-sex allegations|date=22 November 2005|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=16 June 2018}}</ref> After having received compensatory payments from Glitter, the families of the girls appealed for clemency for him.<ref name="bbc4559658">{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4559658.stm |work=BBC NEWS  |title= Glitter police 'drop rape charge' | date=26 December 2005 | access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref>

On 2 March 2006, Glitter was tried on charges of committing obscene acts with two girls, aged 10 and 11, facing up to 14 years in prison if convicted. The following day, he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. The sentence included mandatory deportation at the end of his sentence, and payment of five million [[Vietnamese đồng]] (US$315) to his victims' families.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4769164.stm |publisher=BBC News Asia-Pacific |title= Glitter jailed for abusing girls | date=3 March 2006 | access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> Judge Hoàng Thanh Tùng said: "He sexually abused and committed obscene acts with children many times in a disgusting and sick manner."<ref name=yahoo>AP, {{cite web |url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/ap/20051227/113570502000.html |title=Vietnamese Complete Probe of Gary Glitter |access-date=10 September 2016}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}{{dead link|date=May 2016}} [[Yahoo!

In an interview with [[BBC News]] in May 2006, Glitter denied that he was a [[Pedophilia|paedophile]], and claimed not to have knowingly had sex with anyone under 18. He said that he had hoped to put his life back on track and have a career after he left prison in England. He continued to blame the press for his downfall and called them "the worst enemy in the world," alleging that they had paid girls in a bar to arrange a photo scoop. Glitter did not comment about his previous conviction for downloading child pornography several years earlier.<ref name=denies>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4964292.stm |publisher=BBC News Asia-Pacific |title= Gary Glitter denies abusing girls | date=2 May 2006 | access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> Christine Beddoe, director of [[ECPAT|End Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking]], criticised Glitter and said that he was trying to "minimise what he has done ...

===Imprisonment and release===
Glitter served his sentence in Thủ Đức Prison in southern [[Bình Thuận Province]]. He shared a cell with 18 other foreign inmates, and was exempted from hard labour because of his age. In 2007, he suffered from high blood pressure, and was put on medication and told to stop buying beer from the prison canteen. In January 2008, after being taken to a prison clinic for treatment of intestinal problems, tests showed that Glitter also had an irregular heartbeat. Later that month, he suffered a heart attack and collapsed in his cell, and was taken to a hospital in [[Phan Thiết]], where he was kept under police guard. He was visited in hospital by officials from the British embassy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7200542.stm|title=Gary Glitter in Vietnam hospital|date=21 January 2008|work=BBC News|access-date=16 June 2018}}</ref>

Glitter's Vietnamese lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, said that his client intended to return to the UK, although he had also expressed interest in moving to either [[Hong Kong]] or [[Singapore]].<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?main&20080819&56&515555 |publisher=[[RTHK]]|date= 19 July 2008 |title=Rock star sex offender released}}</ref> In the UK, it was reported that he would be placed on the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|Sex Offenders Register]] on his return.

Glitter was released on 19 August 2008. He was escorted under police guard to [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]] in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and put on a flight to London via Bangkok. In Bangkok, he claimed that he had [[tinnitus]] and a heart condition, and refused to board the flight to London despite the efforts of British police sent to escort him, although they had no jurisdiction to take action. A doctor attending to him airside diagnosed Glitter with [[costochondritis]], prescribed him painkillers, and declared him fit for travel. Glitter continued to refuse to leave. He booked himself into a transit lounge room and claimed he was a "free man." He was refused admission to Thailand as a threat to domestic morality.
