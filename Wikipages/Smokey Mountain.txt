'''''Smokey Mountain''''' was the term coined for a large landfill once located in [[Tondo, Manila]].

== History ==
''Smokey Mountain'' operated for more than 50 years,<ref name="smokey"/> consisting of over two million metric tons of waste. The flammable substances on decomposing waste led  fires which has resulted in many deaths.<ref name="Medina 2007 189">{{cite book|last=Medina|first=Martin|title=The world's scavengers : salvaging for sustainable consumption and production|year=2007|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=978-0759109414|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daCm1Eck0pkC&q=smokey+mountain+landfill&pg=PA189}}</ref>

In 1969, a joint venture agreement, between the National Housing Authority (NHA) and R-II Builders Inc. (RBI) was made to build a low-cost housing project at Smokey Mountain. On 15 August 2007, this agreement was declared valid by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Philippine Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Tetch|title=SC upholds Smokey Mountain contract between NHA, R-II|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20070815-82744/SC_upholds_Smokey_Mountain_contract_between_NHA,_R-II|access-date=22 May 2013|newspaper=Inquirer.net|date=15 August 2007|archive-date=25 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725044017/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20070815-82744/SC_upholds_Smokey_Mountain_contract_between_NHA,_R-II|url-status=live}}</ref> The area was officially closed in 1995.<ref name="Medina 2007 189"/> The site was turned into public housing for the impoverished people living in the slums surrounding the landfill. The slums were also cleared, which was the home of 30,000 people that make their living from picking through the landfill's rubbish.<ref name="smokey">{{cite web|title=Smokey Mountain Remediation and Development Project: Philippines|url=http://povertyenvironment.net/phi-smokey|publisher=Poverty Environmenps://web.archive.org/web/20130718084509/http://povertyenvironment.net/phi-smokey|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1990s [[Jane Walker (charity founder)|Jane Walker]] arrived in the Philippines on holiday and her taxi took her by Smokey Mountain. She was intrigued by the [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] slums and she returned back to Southampton where her plan to do something took place. In time she would raise money, raise funds and build businesses that transformed rubbish into products like handbags. She was awarded an MBE in 2006 and in 2012 she was living in the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web|title=‘Angel of the dump’ Jane Walker transforming lives in Philippines|url=https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/philippines/angel-of-the-dump-jane-walker-transforming-lives-in-philippines-1.1036524|access-date=2021-10-23|website=gulfnews.com|language=en}}</ref>

=== Migration to The Payatas Dump ===
{{Further|Payatas}}
When Smokey Mountain closed down in 1995, many scavengers migrated to the [[Payatas dumpsite]], where another large scavenging community arose.<ref name="Medina 2007 189"/> In 2000, a landslide at the Payatas dump killed over two hundred scavengers.<ref name="Medina 2007 189"/> As of 2007, approximately 80,000 people live at the Payatas dump.<ref name="Medina 2007 189"/>
