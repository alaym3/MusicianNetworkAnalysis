'''Hladno pivo''' ({{IPA-sh|xlǎːdno pîːʋo|hr}}; trans. "[[Cold beer]]") is a Croatian [[punk rock]] band. The recording act, fronted by Mile Kekin, remains one of the most popular [[Rock music|rock]] bands in Croatia.

==Early history==
The band was formed in 1987 in [[Zagreb]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]].<ref name="JL">{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/arhiva/dvadeset-godina-putovanja-od-gajnica-do-jaruna/3896964/|title=Dvadeset godina putovanja od Gajnica do Jaruna|date=19 September 2008|work=Jutarnji.hr|access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref> It initially consisted of five members: Zok, Tedi, Suba, Stipe and Mile. In their beginnings, the band largely played covers of the [[Ramones]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[AC/DC]], [[Motörhead]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Beatles]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Azra]], [[Zabranjeno pušenje]] and [[Električni orgazam]].<ref name="JL"/>

On May 21, 1988 the band held their first concert in [[Kumrovec]]. In 1988 band has also held an unsuccessful concert at lake [[Jarun]] in [[Zagreb]], due to the drummer of the band which played before them refusing to leave the drums for Hladno pivo.

In 1989 Stipe left the band (to form [[Falschspieler]]). This year was also important because Zok, Tedi, Suba and Mile recorded their first [[Demo (music)|demo]]. The demo consisted of six songs: "Für immer Punk" (a [[Die Goldenen Zitronen|Goldene Zitronen]] cover), "Bonzo", "Savršeni marginalci", "Niemals", "Buntovnik" and "Čelične zavjese". The demo was recorded at Jozo in [[Trešnjevka]], Zagreb. One week later, Mile and Zok were sent to do their military service.

When they returned from military service in 1990 they started playing again. The result were songs: "Princeza", "Heroin", "Dobro veče", "Trening za umiranje", "Buba švabe", "Zakaj se tak' oblačiš", "Pjevajte nešto ljubavno". These songs were recorded in 1991 at Denis (a.k.a. Denyken) in [[Sopot, Zagreb|Sopot]], Zagreb.<ref name="JL"/> These songs, along with modified "Marginalci" were published as a [[Compact cassette|cassette]] in production of Megatherium rec.

==Road to fame==
Soon after Hladno pivo held their concerts in [[KSET (student association)|KSET]] and Video-teatar, they were accepted by the public. They soon recorded a music video of the song "Buba švabe" (remake of [[Toy Dolls]]' song "[[Spiders in the Dressing Room]]") in Mile's house for 200 [[German mark]]s. This music video was broadcast as a part of a television music show called ''Hit-depo'' in April 1992. This allowed the band to be introduced to whole of Croatia. The same year A. Dragaš and T. Šunjić offered the band to make a record as T.R.I.P. records. T.R.I.P. records had in that time negotiated with [[Croatia Records]]. The result of the collaboration was the ''T.R.I.P. zone'' compilation where Hladno pivo appeared with two songs. On December 17, 1992 in [[Ljubljana]], Slovenia Hladno pivo opened for [[KUD Idijoti]]. The band also appeared on the Tivoli festival with Dr. Nele Karajlić and his fraction of [[Zabranjeno pušenje]]. The same year in November the band makes its first album – ''Džinovski'' at the ''Best Music'' studio, in Vrbik, [[Zagreb]].

''Džinovski'' was published in 1993 and was a hit. After ''Džinovski'', Hladno pivo held about ten concerts in Croatia and Slovenia. In June 1993 Tedi left the band and was replaced by Hadžo from [[grindcore]] group [[Patareni]]. (Remark: Some informed sources claim that none of the former members of Hladno pivo had not left the group, i.e. each of them was pushed out of the band in a very unfair and non-friendly way, leaving the bitter taste for years after the event). After that the band started practicing a lot. While they were preparing for their next album, they held about 40 concerts across Croatia, Slovenia and a concert in [[Bregenz]], [[Austria]]. In 1993 Hladno pivo was awarded with the [[Porin (music award)|Porin music award]] for best alternative rock album.

On October 11, 1994 Hladno pivo performed in [[Dom sportova]], [[Trešnjevka]] opening for the [[Ramones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.total-croatia-news.com/lifestyle/2711-more-than-just-a-cold-beer-hladno-pivo-on-tour|title=More than Just a Cold Beer, Hladno Pivo on Tour|date=3 March 2016|last=Mac Donald|first=James B.|work=Total Croatia News|access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref> In February 1995 the band records their second album called ''G.A.D.'' under T.R.I.P. records – Croatia Records. The album ''G.A.D.'' appeared on the market in May 1995. On January 19, 1996 Hladno pivo held a concert in [[Skopje]], Republic of Macedonia. In March 1997 the band chose ''Jabukaton'' as their recording studio and recorded their third album ''Desetka''.

After the December 12, 1998 concert in [[Celje]], Slovenia,  Hadžo left the band, and was replaced by Šokec (bass guitar). In 1999 Suba had to do his military service and was temporary replaced with Matko from [[Makarska]], Croatia. Their fourth album ''Pobjeda'' was recorded from August 16 till August 23, 1999, this time under Gajba Records in collaboration with Dancing Bear. Gajba Records was founded because of the band's need to have a better control of the recording of the album. The band had two new members: Stipe (trumpet) from Makarska, Croatia and Milko (keyboards).

On 20 September 2008 they performed in front of 20,000 people on the band's 20th birthday in Zagreb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mojtv.hr/magazin/1015/trijumf-hladnog-piva-na-jarunu.aspx|title=Trijumf Hladnog piva na Jarunu|date=20 September 2008|work=mojtv.hr|language=hr|access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>
