==History==

===Formation, style===
The group was formed on February 14, 1992. Although based in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and active during the [[grunge]] movement in rock music, Hazel's music was different from most grunge in that it featured both male and female vocals as well as a more melodic sound that could be described as [[noise pop]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Hazel's music was not particularly intricate musically, relying on a few chords, sheer energy (many songs being played at breakneck speed), and vocal intensity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Rather than singing together in harmony, Krebs and Bleyle often sang completely different parts that answered or intertwined with one another. The majority of lyrics dealt with problems regarding relationships, including the regret and resentment following a breakup ("Everybody's Best Friend") or the anxiety felt while attempting to begin a relationship ("Day Glo").

The group was also notable for featuring the dancer Fred Nemo as a full member. Often dressed in fanciful costumes, Nemo, a tall, bearded man, cavorted crazily about the stage, climbing atop speaker cabinets and swinging heavy objects through the air.

===Albums===
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
[[Cavity Search Records]] was founded as a small, independent [[record label]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] in [[1992 in music|1992]]. The founders released the first single on the label, "JHell b/w Dayglo/Joe Louis Punchout" by Hazel, later in 1992.<ref name="csrc"/>

The group released two full-length albums, ''Toreador of Love'' and ''[[Are You Going to Eat That]]'' on the [[Sub Pop]] label. A 5-song EP on CandyAss/Caroline titled ''[[Airiana]]'' was their last release in 1997. Intermittently plagued by personality conflicts,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Hazel formally broke up on February 13, 1997{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}, following their last show in their hometown of Portland, Oregon, though they generally have played a couple of shows a year since then.

Bleyle, now based in [[Los Angeles]], continues to perform around the United States, including reunion shows with girl punk band [[Team Dresch]], a duo with her brother Allen called Family Outing, touring with [[Amy Ray]] of the [[Indigo Girls]], and singing jazz standards in L.A. [[Dive bar|dives]]. Smith was the founding principal of [[Validus Preparatory Academy]], a public high school in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]].
