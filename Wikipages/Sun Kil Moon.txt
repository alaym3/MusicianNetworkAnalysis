'''Sun Kil Moon''' is an American [[folk rock]] act from [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], founded in 2002. Initially a continuation of the defunct [[indie rock]] band [[Red House Painters]], Sun Kil Moon is now the primary recording moniker of vocalist and guitarist [[Mark Kozelek]]. The project is named after the Korean [[super flyweight]] boxer [[Moon Sung-kil|Sung-Kil Moon]].<ref>{{citation |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050219233857/http://www.rockpile.net/features.php?action=view&id=118 |url= http://www.rockpile.net/features.php?action=view&id=118 |work= Rockpile |title= Mark Kozelek |first= Andrea |last= Bussel |archive-date= February 19, 2005 }}</ref>

Following the delayed release of Red House Painters' final studio album, ''[[Old Ramon]]'' (2001), vocalist and guitarist Kozelek began recording new material under the name Sun Kil Moon with bandmates Anthony Koutsos (drums) and Jerry Vessel (bass), alongside Geoff Stanfield and [[Tim Mooney]]. The resulting album, ''[[Ghosts of the Great Highway]]'', was released in 2003 to critical acclaim. The project's second studio album, ''[[Tiny Cities]]'' (2005), was composed entirely of [[Modest Mouse]] cover songs.

In 2008, the band released its third studio album, ''[[April (Sun Kil Moon album)|April]]''. Recorded as a three-piece by Kozelek, Koutsos and Stanfield, the album was well received and featured guest vocal appearances from noted indie rock musicians [[Will Oldham]] and [[Ben Gibbard]].

Inspired by [[classical guitar]] music, Kozelek recorded Sun Kil Moon's fourth studio album, ''[[Admiral Fell Promises]]'' (2010), as a solo act, and continued to record mostly alone on its follow-up, ''[[Among the Leaves]]'' (2012). In 2013, Kozelek released three studio albums under his own name before releasing Sun Kil Moon's sixth studio album, ''[[Benji (album)|Benji]]'', in February 2014, to widespread critical acclaim and increased exposure, with the band releasing their seventh studio effort, ''[[Universal Themes]],'' in 2015. Sun Kil Moon's eighth studio album, ''[[Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood]]'', was released in February 2017, which was followed by their ninth studio album, ''[[This Is My Dinner]],'' in November 2018. The tenth Sun Kil Moon studio album, ''[[I Also Want to Die in New Orleans]]'', was released digitally on March 1, 2019, and on CD on April 12, 2019.

== History==
Following the dissolution of [[Red House Painters]] after the tumultuous release of their last album, ''[[Old Ramon]]'', Kozelek released a handful of solo recordings before forming Sun Kil Moon in 2002. The band's debut album, ''[[Ghosts of the Great Highway]]'', was released in November 2003 by [[Jetset Records]]. It contains several songs concerned with true-life stories of deceased boxers, such as Mexican featherweight champion [[Salvador Sánchez]], Filipino flyweight champion [[Pancho Villa (boxer)|Pancho Villa]], and also Korean boxer [[Duk Koo Kim]], two of the three boxers died at the age of 23 as Kim died at 27. The album was well received by critics, garnering an overall rating of 84/100 on [[Metacritic]].com.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/music/ghosts-of-the-great-highway/sun-kil-moon |title= Ghosts Of The Great Highway Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |work= Metacritic |publisher= CBS Interactive Inc. }}</ref>

The band's follow-up ''[[Tiny Cities]]'' was released in November 2005 on Kozelek's own label [[Caldo Verde Records]]. The album covers eleven songs by the indie/alternative group [[Modest Mouse]]. ''Ghosts of the Great Highway'' was re-issued as a double CD in February 2007 on Caldo Verde. The second disc features six bonus tracks, including a cover of "Somewhere" written by [[Leonard Bernstein]].

Sun Kil Moon's third studio album ''[[April (Sun Kil Moon album)|April]]'' was released in April 2008<ref name="SKM">{{cite web |url= http://www.sunkilmoon.com |title= Sun Kil Moon: The Official Website for Sun Kil Moon }}</ref> and features guest vocals from [[Will Oldham]] and [[Ben Gibbard]]. The album was issued as a double CD, featuring a bonus disc of alternate recordings of album tracks. The album was met with further critical acclaim, including a 4.5/5-star rating from [[AllMusic]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/april-mw0000783392 |title= April – Sun Kil Moon: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |work= AllMusic |publisher= Rovi Corp |first= Thom |last= Jurek }}</ref> and 4-star reviews from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', and ''[[Drowned in Sound]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/music/april/sun-kil-moon |title= April Reviews, Ratings, and Credits and More |work= Metacritic |publisher= CBS Interactive Inc. }}</ref>

On November 1, 2018, Sun Kil Moon released their ninth studio album, ''[[This Is My Dinner]]''. The following year, their tenth studio album was released, titled ''[[I Also Want to Die in New Orleans]]'', named after the [[Suicideboys|$uicideboy$]] album ''[[I Want to Die in New Orleans]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/mark-kozelek-retitles-collab-lp-to-i-also-want-to-die-in-new-orleans-after-seeing-suicideboys-poster/ |title=Mark Kozelek sees $uicideboy$ poster for ‘I Want To Die In New Orleans,’ retitles his LP ‘I Also Want To Die In New Orleans’ |website=Brooklynvegan.com |date=2018-11-30 |access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> This album saw Kozelek working with Donny McCaslin and Jim White, the former being heavily present on [[David Bowie]]'s 2016 album, ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]''.

== Boxing references==
Kozelek is fascinated with the sport of boxing, and the name Sun Kil Moon was inspired by that of boxer [[Moon Sung-kil]]. Kozelek discussed boxing and the murder of [[Agapito Sánchez]] four years after a fight he witnessed in a 2012 interview:
{{quote|Their backgrounds are extremely harsh and they work very hard to move up in their careers. I was in attendance at the [[Manny Pacquiao]]-[[Agapito Sánchez]] fight in San Francisco in 2001. When I heard Sánchez was murdered shortly after, it had a profound effect on me. It hurts when anyone dies young, but when you see the backgrounds of these guys and the path they've taken to try to find some light in their lives, it hurts to see them die young.<ref name= TQR />}}

Several of the band's songs are inspired by the sport, such as "[[Duk Koo Kim]]".<ref name=TQR>{{cite web |title= Famous Fight Fan: Mark Kozelek |work= The Queensberry Rules |first= Mark |last= Ortega |date= February 11, 2012 |url= http://queensberry-rules.com/2012-articles/february/famous-fight-fan-mark-kozelek.html }}</ref> Duk Koo Kim was a Korean boxer who died after a nationally televised bout with [[Ray Mancini]] on November 13, 1982. Mancini is from Youngstown, Ohio, which is very close to Kozelek's hometown of Massillon. The triumph of the local hero soon turned into a tragedy that included the suicide deaths of both Kim's mother and the bout's referee, [[Richard Green (referee)|Richard Green]].<ref>[http://www.lvrj.com/sports/11232441.html "25 Years Later: The Death Of Duk Koo Kim"], ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', November 13, 2007</ref> The song "Pancho Villa" is named after [[Francisco Guilledo|the Filipino boxer known by that name]], and also mentions [[Salvador Sánchez]] and [[Benny Paret]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858563333/|title=Sun Kil Moon – Pancho Villa Lyrics – SongMeanings|website=SongMeanings|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>
