==Career== 
===2015–2016: Breakthrough with ''Swaay''===
Joe Jonas originally rose to fame as a member of the pop trio the [[Jonas Brothers]], alongside his brothers Nick and Kevin. Both Lee and Lawless were, for varying tenures, a part of the Jonas Brothers' live backing band, playing guitar and drums respectively. The idea for DNCE first came about while Jonas and Lawless were living together, although the project was put on hold due to the duo's respective busy schedules.<ref name=interviewmag /> Jonas, Lawless, and Lee officially came together to form DNCE in 2015, with work on their debut studio album beginning shortly afterwards.<ref name=iHeartRadio>{{cite web|url=http://news.iheart.com/articles/trending-104650/interview-who-is-dnce-everything-you-14026503/|title=INTERVIEW: Who Is DNCE?

This led to Jonas and Whittle, the former bassist in Tranter's band [[Semi Precious Weapons]], becoming friends. Ultimately, Whittle was added as a full-time member of the group.<ref name=formation /> The group named themselves DNCE after the name of a song written for the album, which lyrically spoke of being too drunk to spell the word "dance".<ref name=iHeartRadio /> Jonas later added that the group decided on the name as it described the "imperfect awesome[ness] of the four of [them] together."<ref name=iHeartRadio /> Lee later added that "much like the spelling of the word, you don't have to be a perfect dancer to dance in life."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.instyle.com/news/joe-jonas-new-band-dnce-interview-video|title=8 Questions with Joe Jonas's New Band, DNCE|magazine=InStyle|date=October 16, 2015}}</ref> The group began performing secret shows in [[New York City]] to rehearse for their upcoming tour and promotional performances.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/joe-jonas-on-new-funk-pop-party-band-dnce-second-chances-20151023?page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028040856/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/joe-jonas-on-new-funk-pop-party-band-dnce-second-chances-20151023?page=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 28, 2015|title=Joe Jonas on New Funk-Pop Party Band DNCE, Second Chances|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 23, 2015}}</ref> DNCE made an official [[Instagram]] account in September 2015; Joe later posted a teaser video for the band on his account, tagging the band's official page, on September 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2267657/joe-jonas-teases-new-band/|title=Joe Jonas Teases New Band|publisher=MTV|date=September 11, 2015}}</ref>
