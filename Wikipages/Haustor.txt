'''Haustor''' ({{lang-hr|Hallway or front door}}) was a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[rock band]] from [[Zagreb]], [[SR Croatia]], a member of the [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|new wave]] movement, and an important act of the former [[Popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav rock scene]].<ref name="menart-rundek">{{cite web | url = http://www.menart.hr/index.php?performer_id=37 | language = Croatian | publisher = [[Menart Records]] | title = Izvođači - Darko Rundek | quote = Početak glazbene karijere Darka Rundeka vezan je uz grupu Haustor, jednu od najvažnijih pojava zagrebačke glazbene scene.

== History ==
The basis of the band was formed in 1977, when singer and occasional guitarist [[Darko Rundek]] met [[bassist]] Srđan Sacher. Two years later they formed Haustor, together with Ozren Štiglić ([[guitar]]) and Boris Leiner ([[Drummer|drums]]), who also played in another prominent Yugoslav rock band [[Azra]]. During 1980 they added Zoran Vuletić ([[Keyboardist|keyboard]]) and a [[Brass instrument|brass section]]. The group was mostly influenced by [[Caribbean music]].

Haustor released its self-titled debut album in 1981. All of the songs were written by either Sacher or Rundek. Sacher's [[reggae]] song "Moja prva ljubav" (''My First Love'') became a hit, and it still remains popular in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav]] countries.

After a pause, which was caused by the members' conscription in the former [[Yugoslav People's Army]], their second album, titled ''Treći svijet'' (''Third World''), was released in 1984. However, soon afterwards Sacher left the band, leaving Rundek as the sole composer and lyricist of the band.

Haustor released two more albums, ''Bolero'' (1985) and ''Tajni grad'' (1988), before breaking up in 1990. The group gathered again during the 1990s for a temporary reunion and later finally disbanded.<ref name="menart-rundek"/>

The group is featured in the 2003 Croatian [[rockumentary]] ''[[Sretno dijete]]'' along several other eminent former [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav new wave]] artists.

A [[cover version]] of their song "Moja prva ljubav" in [[Polish language|Polish]] is included in the 2001 [[tribute album]] ''[[Yugoton]]''.
