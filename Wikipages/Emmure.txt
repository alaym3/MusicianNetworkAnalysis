'''Emmure''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|'|m|juː|r}}) is an American [[metalcore]] band formed in 2003.  Originally based in [[New Fairfield, Connecticut]], before moving to [[Queens, New York]], the group has [[Emmure discography|released eight albums]], with their first public release being a 2006 EP entitled ''[[The Complete Guide to Needlework]]''.

[[Victory Records]] has worked with the band throughout most of their career, starting with ''[[Goodbye to the Gallows]]'' (2007). Their second, third and fourth albums ''[[The Respect Issue]]'' (2008), ''[[Felony (album)|Felony]]'' (2009) and ''[[Speaker of the Dead]]'' (2011) were all distributed through Victory as well. After the band's initial four-album contract with Victory [[Recording contract#Termination|expired]], they signed again with Victory to distribute their fifth and sixth studio albums, ''[[Slave to the Game]]'' (2012) and ''[[Eternal Enemies]]'' (2014). However after nine years of being signed to the label, Emmure would leave Victory in 2016 to sign with [[SharpTone Records|SharpTone]]. The seventh and eighth Emmure albums, titled ''[[Look at Yourself (Emmure album)|Look at Yourself]]'' and ''[[Hindsight (Emmure album)|Hindsight]]'' were released on March 3, 2017 and June 26, 2020 respectively.

The band's vocalist, Frankie Palmeri (born 1986), is the only remaining original member and has been subject to [[Emmure#Controversy|some controversy]] over the years. His personality has made the band unique from other acts in the genre, and critics have described his "no-fucks-given" attitude as an entertaining standpoint for the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/no-amount-of-drugs-and-graffiti-fulfill-emmures-frankie-palmeri-like-music-does-8818930|title=No Amount of Drugs and Graffiti Fulfill Emmure's Frankie Palmeri Like Music Does|first=Justin|last=Criado|date=February 27, 2017|website=Westword}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/emmures-frankie-palmeri-doesn-t-care-if-you-hate-his-music-or-not-9262835|title=Emmure's Frankie Palmeri Doesn't Care If You Hate His Music or Not|first=Kristy|last=Loye|date=March 10, 2017|website=Houston Press}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years===
Emmure was started in 2003. Frankie Palmeri (from [[Queens, New York]]) met Joe and Ben Lionetti (from [[New Fairfield, Connecticut]]) through an internet message board. Palmeri then traveled to Connecticut to begin rehearsals together. Bassist Dan Steindler and guitarist Jesse Ketive, residents of New Fairfield and Queens, respectively, then joined when the three began another recruiting search for members. The band named themselves "Emmure", being a reference to the act of [[immurement]], which is a form of [[execution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://empireunderground.com/blog1/2011/04/21/emmure-interview/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131110013727/http://empireunderground.com/blog1/2011/04/21/emmure-interview/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-11-10 |title=Emmure Interview &#124; |publisher=Empireunderground.com |date=2011-04-21 |access-date=2011-10-27 }}</ref>

In 2004, bassist Steindler left the band and was later replaced by Mark Davis, which marked the first ever lineup change in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmure.com/main.php?pageID=bio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811074303/http://www.emmure.com/main.php?pageID=bio |archive-date=2007-08-11 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2007-08-11 |access-date=2012-10-03}}</ref> Ketive was formerly in the band Warfix, in which he played guitar alongside Sean Murphy and Mike Kaabe of Endwell (Kaabe eventually joining Emmure himself in April 2009) and Bryan Goldsman of Southside Panic (and co-producer of ''Felony'').

The band recorded some demo tapes and played local gigs around the New York area from 2003 - 2005. Palmeri proclaimed that in 2005, the band "started becoming more serious”.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFexChij95A|title=Frankie Palmeri of EMMURE Screams...|last=TV3DOTMAG|date=6 August 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref>

===Victory Records signing and touring (2007-2012)===
In 2008, the band finished a tour in the lower 48 US states supporting [[Misery Signals]], [[August Burns Red]], and Burn Down Rome. That summer was spent on their headlining tour with [[Endwell (band)|Endwell]], [[On Broken Wings]], [[Ligeia (band)|Ligeia]], Recon, Unite and Conquer, [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex]] and others.

Nasso previously directed the video to "Sound Wave Superior" as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victoryrecords.com/emmure |title=Emmure |publisher=Victory Records |access-date=2011-10-27}}</ref> Emmure completed their third studio album, ''[[Felony (album)|Felony]]'', released on August 18, 2009 on Victory Records. The album, of which, is allegedly inspired by a real event in which vocalist Frankie Palmeri [[assault]]ed his best friend by "[hitting] him in the head with a bottle", which resulted in Palmeri being [[arrest]]ed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockfeed.net/2017/01/29/founding-emmure-members-respond-frankie-palmeri-diss-nobody-takes-f-kin-seriously/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427184242/http://www.rockfeed.net/2017/01/29/founding-emmure-members-respond-frankie-palmeri-diss-nobody-takes-f-kin-seriously/ |archive-date=2018-04-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following the release of the album, Emmure was announced as one of the groups to be featured on 2010's [[Warped Tour]] as well as [[The Bamboozle]].

''Slave to the Game'' was positively received by criticts, however, Palmeri has heavily panned the album insisting that it's a [[commercial failure]]. In a 2017 interview, he stated “The songs suck. It’s just not good. None of the riffs are good. I just don’t like it. I feel bad ‘cause I let that record happen.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/frankie-palmeri-dislikes-30-of-emmures-music-former-co-founders-say-nobody-takes-him-fuckin-seriously|title=Frankie Palmeri Dislikes 30% Of EMMURE's Music, Former Co-Founders Say "Nobody Takes Him Fuckin' Seriously."|date=30 January 2017}}</ref>

The band was also featured on the entire Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival in 2014 with bands like [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Korn]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Suicide Silence]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]], [[Asking Alexandria]], [[Miss May I]], [[Veil of Maya]], [[Upon a Burning Body]] and [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]].

On November 20, 2014, Emmure began their headline US tour, the Eternal Enemies Tour. In support were [[The Acacia Strain]], [[Fit for a King (band)|Fit for a King]], Kublai Khan, and Sylar. The tour ended on December 21, 2014 in New York. [[Stray from the Path]] was originally slated to also appear on the tour, but dropped off weeks before its commencement to allow them to finish an upcoming album. It was simultaneously announced that Sylar would take their place on the tour. The Eternal Enemies Tour was much anticipated due to the fact that Emmure and The Acacia Strain once had a well publicized feud back in 2009, which has since cooled, and both co-headlined the tour. The two bands' former feud was often parodied by promotional posters for the tour, including a bill and a teaser video both advertising that the tour was "Emmure vs. The Acacia Strain".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQsniB2UXwA |title=Emmure vs The Acacia Strain - Eternal Enemies Tour |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-11-18 |access-date=2015-07-27}}</ref>

In February 2015, Emmure and [[Suicide Silence]] did a co-headlining tour in the United States with support from [[Within the Ruins]] and [[Fit for an Autopsy]]. However, vocalist Palmeri [[oversinging#Vocal damage|damaged his voice]] and was unable to perform for a leg of the tour. He was, however, able to return to singing again on March 13. A European tour with [[Caliban (band)|Caliban]], [[Thy Art Is Murder]] and [[Sworn In (band)|Sworn In]] was also announced. But it was canceled since Palmeri still had severe acute and chronic reflux [[laryngitis]] and a weak left vocal cord. Emmure began to tour again in September with [[Hatebreed]] at the UK's GhostFest. As well as two headlining shows in Russia with [[Born of Osiris]] as support. In October 2015, Emmure was originally going to support [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]] and [[We Came as Romans]] on the Hardrive Live Fallout tour. But due to personal issues within the band, Emmure dropped off the tour.

=== Line-up departure, new members, and ''Look at Yourself'' (2015-2018) ===

On December 22, 2015, it was reported by mass sources including [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] and Lambgoat that all members apart from vocalist Frankie Palmeri had departed from the group.
