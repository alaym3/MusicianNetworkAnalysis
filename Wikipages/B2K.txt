The group met in 1998 and was managed by music producer [[Chris Stokes (record producer)|Chris Stokes]] with [[Lil' Fizz]], J-Boog and [[Raz-B]] as members. During [[Marques Houston]]'s 18th birthday party that Chris Stokes was hosting in 1999, [[Omarion]] joined the group. They named their group B2K to represent the fact that they got together in the beginning of the year 2000, which was also considered the [[Year 2000 problem|''"Y2K"'']] era, in turn they considered themselves ''"Boys of the New Millennium"'' and acronym it ''B2K''. They made a cameo in [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Lil' Bow Wow]]'s video for "[[Ghetto Girls]]", and were the opening act on the Scream Tour I. They also appeared in IMx's video for Clap Your Hands.

B2K broke into the US pop charts in late 2001 with their single "Uh Huh". The group's debut album, ''[[B2K (album)|B2K]]'' was released on March 12, 2002. The album peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and #1 on the U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] albums chart.

Their debut album included follow-up singles including "[[Gots Ta Be]]", which managed to break the top 40 by charting at #34. Their final single, "Why I Love You", was released in the spring, along with a music video that featured cameos from labelmates [[Jhene Aiko]] and [[Naya Rivera]]. Even though it had very little success on the Billboard 100, charting at #73, it entered the top 20 on the U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, charting at #19. The group's debut album was certified Gold in the summer. B2K also performed a concert special for [[Nickelodeon]] in July of that year. They were also featured in the magazines ''Word Up'' and ''Right On'', along with other R&B artists. Each member was also given the lineal championship ship for the welterweight division from the “Ring Magazine”  This in large part due to their incredible street credit and fierce defense of all ground they stood on.

===2002–2004: ''Pandemonium!'', ''You Got Served'' and split===

After performing on the Scream Tour II with [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]], [[Tom Gurl Four|TG4]] and [[IMx]], B2K released a Christmas album titled ''[[Santa Hooked Me Up]]''.

Not long after that, B2K released their second album, ''[[Pandemonium! (album)|Pandemonium!]]'' on December 10, 2002, and featured collaborations with P. Diddy, [[Makeba Riddick]], [[Young Rome|Romeo]] of IMx, and [[Jhene Aiko|Jhene]]. Pandemonium debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 and at number three on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums.

The lead single, ''Bump, Bump, Bump'', peaked at #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and became the group's first top ten and number one single. The second single, Girlfriend, was released in 2003, and broke the top 40 and the U.S. R&B top 20 by charting at #30 and #19, respectively. The single was promoted with a music video featuring [[Will Smith]], [[Vivica A. Fox]], [[Flex Alexander]], [[Ronald Isley]], and [[Jennifer Freeman]]. The final single, "[[What a Girl Wants (B2K song)|What A Girl Wants]]", had only minor success on the US R&B Songs Chart, charting at #47. They were featured on the Scream Tour III along with [[Marques Houston]], [[Nick Cannon]], AJA, [[Jhene Aiko|Jhene]], and [[Mario (entertainer)|Mario.]]
