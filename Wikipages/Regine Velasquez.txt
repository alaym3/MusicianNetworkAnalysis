'''Regina Encarnacion Ansong Velasquez ''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|n|_|v|ə|ˈ|l|æ|s|k|ɛ|z}} {{respell|rih|JEEN|_|veh|LAS|kez|}}; born April 22, 1970) is a Filipino singer, actress, and producer. She is known for her [[vocal range]] and [[Belting (music)|belting technique]], and notably for the unorthodox voice training she received during her childhood, a method where she was immersed neck-deep at sea. Velasquez rose to prominence after winning the television talent show ''[[Ang Bagong Kampeon]]'' in 1984 and the [[ABU Song Festivals|Asia Pacific Singing Contest]] in 1989. Under the name Chona, she signed a recording contract with [[PolyEast Records|OctoArts International]] in 1986 and released the single "Love Me Again", which was commercially unsuccessful. The following year, she adopted the stage name Regine Velasquez for her debut studio album, ''[[Regine (album)|Regine]]'' (1987), under the guidance of [[Viva Records (Philippines)|Viva Records]] executive [[Viva Entertainment|Vic del Rosario]] and producer [[Ronnie Henares]]. She explored [[Manila sound]] and [[Kundiman|kundiman]] on her second and third studio albums, ''[[Nineteen 90]]'' (1990) and ''[[Tagala Talaga]]'' (1991).

After signing an international record deal with [[Polygram|Polygram Records]], Velasquez achieved commercial success in some Asian territories with her fifth album ''[[Listen Without Prejudice (Regine Velasquez album)|Listen Without Prejudice]]'' (1994). Aided by the lead single "In Love With You", it sold more than seven hundred thousand copies and became her highest-selling album to date. She experimented further with [[Jazz|jazz]] and [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] genres on ''[[My Love Emotion]]'' (1995), while she recorded [[Cover version|covers]] on ''[[Retro (Regine Velasquez album)|Retro]]'' (1996). Parting ways with Polygram to sign with [[Mark J. Feist]]{{'}}s MJF Company in 1997, she released the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]-influenced album ''[[Drawn (album)|Drawn]]'' (1998). Velasquez's follow-up record, ''[[R2K]]'' (1999), was supported by remakes of "[[On the Wings of Love (song)|On the Wings of Love]]", "[[I'll Never Love This Way Again]]", and "[[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing]]", and was subsequently [[Music recording certification|certified]] twelve-times platinum.

Velasquez ventured into acting, playing leading roles in the romantic comedies ''[[Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw]]'' (2000) and ''Pangako Ikaw Lang'' (2001), receiving the [[Box Office Entertainment Award for Box Office Queen]] for the latter. Her performance as a mentally challenged woman in an episode of the anthology series ''[[Maalaala Mo Kaya]]'' (2002) earned her a [[16th PMPC Star Awards for Television|Star Award for Best Actress]]. She also took on starring roles in the prime time television series ''[[Forever in My Heart]]'' (2004), ''[[Ako si Kim Samsoon]]'' (2008), ''[[Totoy Bato]]'' (2009), ''[[Diva (2010 TV series)|Diva]]'' (2010), ''[[I Heart You, Pare!]]'' (2011),  and ''[[Poor Señorita]]'' (2016). Velasquez also won the [[Golden Screen TV Awards|Golden Screen Award for Best Actress]] for playing a document forger in the comedy film ''[[Of All the Things (film)|Of All the Things]]'' (2013). She expanded her career into reality television talent shows, serving as a presenter on ''[[Star for a Night (Philippine TV series)|Star for a Night]]'' (2002), ''[[Pinoy Pop Superstar]]'' (2004), and ''[[The Clash (TV series)|The Clash]]'' (2018); and as a judge on ''[[StarStruck (season 6)|StarStruck]]'' (2015) and ''[[Idol Philippines]]'' (2019).

Having sold more than seven million records domestically and a further million and a half in Asia, Velasquez is the {{nowrap|[[List of best-selling albums in the Philippines|best-selling music artist of all time]]}} in the Philippines. Her [[List of awards and nominations received by Regine Velasquez|accolades]] include two [[Asian Television Awards]], two [[MTV Asia Awards]], 21 [[Awit Award]]s, 15 [[Aliw Awards]] (including three Entertainer of the Year wins), 22 [[Box Office Entertainment Awards]], and 12 [[7th PMPC Star Awards for Music|Star Awards for Music]]. Referred to as "Asia's songbird", she has consistently been credited with inspiring a generation of Filipino singers.
