He attended a series of schools in [[east London]], including [[Langdon Park School]], and was expelled from four of them, including [[St Paul's Way Trust School|St Paul's Way Community School]].

==Career==
[[File:Dizzie2009Rascal.jpg|thumb|left|Rascal in 2009]]

===2000–2003: Early career===
Around the age of 14, Dizzee Rascal became an amateur [[drum and bass]] DJ, also rapping over tracks as customary in [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] culture, and making occasional appearances on local [[pirate radio]] stations.<ref name=":1">{{citation|last=DJ Vlad|title=Dizzee Rascal on Growing up in the Projects & Raw Gun Culture in the U.K.|date=17 March 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3hugcCt6b0&t=244|access-date=10 August 2016|archive-date=30 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330080937/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3hugcCt6b0&t=244|url-status=live}}</ref> Aged sixteen, he self-produced his first single, "[[I Luv U (Dizzee Rascal song)|I Luv U]]".<ref name="Indp1"/> In 2002, he jointly formed the [[Roll Deep Crew]], a 13-piece garage collective, with former school friends. He also signed a solo deal with the [[record label]] [[XL Recordings|XL]].<ref name="BBC1">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3055770.stm|title=Garage star stabbed in Cyprus|work=BBC News|date=8 July 2003|access-date=8 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512160847/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3055770.stm|archive-date=12 May 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

During his early career, Rascal worked with his mentor [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]] to create the still-unreleased song "We Ain't Having It" and rapped on some Sidewinder recordings. He made some instrumentals including "Go" and "Ho" and "Streetfighter". Rascal had an ongoing feud, from late 2003, with fellow underground grime artist [[Crazy Titch]], which began when a fight broke out between the pair during a set on a guest show on the pirate radio station Deja Vu FM. The set, which features many seminal early grime artists, was filmed, and has accumulated over a million views on YouTube<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Hancox |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/dizzee-rascal-grime |title=Grime's 100 Club Moment &#124; Music |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 June 2011 |access-date=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218220056/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/dizzee-rascal-grime |archive-date=18 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> and resulted in the two exchanging [[Diss (music)|diss tracks]].

After winning a Sidewinder Award for Best Newcomer MC in 2002, Dizzee was a judge on the [[Sky1]] show ''[[Must Be The Music (TV series)|Must Be The Music]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sky1.sky.com/music |title=Dizzee, Jamie and Sharleen to judge Must Be The Music - Sky1 HD |publisher=Sky1.sky.com |access-date=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113075244/http://sky1.sky.com/music |archive-date=13 January 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

He also did a verse on the Roll Deep remix of "Let's Push Things Forward" on the 2002 album ''[[Weak Become Heroes]]'' and 12" single by [[The Streets]].

===2003–2004: ''Boy in da Corner''===
Dizzee's first solo album, ''[[Boy in da Corner]]'', was released to universal critical acclaim in August 2003, entering the UK [[Top 40]] at #40. The album would peak at #23. In the same week the album was released, whilst performing with Roll Deep Crew in Cyprus, Dizzee was stabbed six times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.38053/title.dizzee-rascal-recalls-brutal-stabbing |title=News |publisher=HIPHOPDX |access-date=25 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328173802/http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.38053/title.dizzee-rascal-recalls-brutal-stabbing |archive-date=28 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="CBC"/><ref name="BBC1"/> Many tabloids suggested that this event was connected to an apparent feud between Dizzee and garage act [[So Solid Crew]], and his pinching [[Lisa Maffia]]'s buttocks.<ref name="Guard1"/> After Dizzee was hospitalised, So Solid Crew member "Megaman"&nbsp;– real name Dwayne Vincent&nbsp;– was questioned about the incident, but was released by Cypriot police.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3054875.stm |title=So Solid star quizzed over attack |work=BBC News |date=10 July 2003 |access-date=8 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806145038/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3054875.stm |archive-date=6 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Following the success of single "I Luv U" and the album, the second single from ''Boy in da Corner'' was "[[Fix Up, Look Sharp]]". The single, released in August 2003, gave Dizzee his first UK [[Top 20]] single and also became the biggest hit from his debut album. In September, Dizzee was awarded the prestigious [[Mercury Prize]] for the best album of 2003.<ref name="CBC"/> He was the youngest person at 19 years old to do so and the second rapper, after [[Ms. Dynamite]] the previous year. The album was also chosen as the No. 1 album of the year by [[Planet Sound]], and as one of the top 50 albums of the year by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6768041/the_top_50_albums_of_2004 |title=News |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/668MpLjdH?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news |archive-date=13 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His unique style, as "words pour out at a high pitch and pace, as if syllables are the only thing that can hold back a scream", have given him a sound that hip hop heads can embrace as something new and original in the hip hop scene.<ref name="autogenerated2">Chang, Jeff. "Future Shock." ''[[The Village Voice]]'', 19 January 2004.</ref> Later in the year he collaborated with the [[Basement Jaxx]] on their third album, ''[[Kish Kash]]'' on the track "Lucky Star". The track was released as a single in November 2003 and gave Dizzee his third top 30 hit. The third and final single, taken from his debut album, was "[[Jus' a Rascal]]", which became his fourth top 30 success. The song was also featured in the film ''[[Kidulthood]]'' released in 2006.

"Jezebel" was not a single from the album, but was well received, gaining exposure and popularity on the underground scene. The song told the tale of a young London girl, who through years of going to parties, getting drunk, doing drugs and having sex earned herself the title [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]]. He made his US concert debut on 7 February 2004 at Volume in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Brooklyn]].

===2004–2007: ''Showtime''===
[[File:Dizzee Rascal - Ilosaarirock 2009 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Dizzee Rascal performing at the 2009 [[Ilosaarirock]] festival]]
In 2004, Dizzee Rascal won the [[NME Awards|NME Award for Innovation]]. His second album, ''[[Showtime (Dizzee Rascal album)|Showtime]]'', was released in September of the same year, eclipsing the peak of his debut album by entering the [[UK Albums Chart]] at #8. The first single from the album, released two weeks earlier in August 2004, was titled "Stand Up Tall"; it was written and produced by grime producer DJ Youngstar of Pulse-X. The title track was featured on the soundtrack for the first ''[[FIFA Street (2005 video game)|FIFA Street]]'' video game.

The second single "[[Dream (Dizzee Rascal song)|Dream]]", another top 20 hit, was released in November 2004. It sampled (and used the chorus of) [[Captain Sensible]]'s song "Happy Talk", originally from the makers of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. The "Dream" music video consisted of a mock 1950s style children's [[marionette]] show depicting scenes corresponding to the lyrics about Dizzee's youth: street culture, crime, single teenage mothers, pirate radio and garage clubs.

Later in 2004, Dizzee Rascal was part of [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid 20]], a group of British musicians who re-recorded "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" He did not sing in the song; rather, he rapped two lines of it ("Spare a thought this yuletide for the deprived, if the table was turned would you survive?" and "You ain't gotta feel guilt just selfless, give a little help to the helpless"). Dizzee Rascal was the first person to add to the song since the original was released;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} this would mark the first time that Dizzee reached the [[Number one hit record|number one]] spot in the [[UK Singles Chart]], albeit as part of the ensemble.

In 2004, Dizzee Rascal made an international endorsement deal with urban brand [[Eckō Unltd.]] and designed his own shoe with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in 2005.<ref name="CBC"/>

In March 2005, the [[double A-side]] single "Off 2 Work" / "Graftin'" was released. "Graftin'" was the third and final single from the ''Showtime'' album, whilst "Off 2 Work" was a new track that did not appear on either of his albums. The accompanying music video featured Rascal in various ordinary workplace situations (as a policeman, a fast food vendor, a businessman, etc.) and as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], announcing his engagement to [[Cherie Blair]]. It would prove to be Dizzee's lowest charting single to date, peaking outside the Top 40 at #44.

===2007–2009: ''Maths + English''===
Dizzee's third album, ''[[Maths + English]]'', was released on 4 June 2007. He stated in an interview before the album's release that "Maths" refers to producing, in terms of beats, deals and money<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=https://www.myspace.com/dizzeerascal |title=DIZZEE RASCAL |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208025512/http://www.myspace.com/dizzeerascal |archive-date=8 February 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> and "English" to writing lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlion.co.uk/articles.cfm/id/1001 |title=Dizzee Rascal Interview - Nottingham Culture |publisher=LeftLion.co.uk |access-date=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415113542/http://www.leftlion.co.uk/articles.cfm/id/1001 |archive-date=15 April 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first single off this album, "Sirens", was released on 21 May.

The album was one of the 12 nominees for the 2007 [[Mercury Prize]], which ultimately went to [[Klaxons]]' album ''[[Myths of the Near Future (album)|Myths of the Near Future]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Beech |first=Mark |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&sid=ak1CuHOGlhqs&refer=home |title=Klaxons Are Winners of Britain's Mercury Music Prize (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=4 September 2007 |access-date=6 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930072030/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&sid=ak1CuHOGlhqs&refer=home |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> During the year, Dizzee worked with cross-genre artist [[Beck]] on a remix of the song "[[Hell Yes (EP)|Hell Yes]]", and provided guest vocals on an [[Arctic Monkeys]] track, the B-Side to their single "[[Brianstorm]]" named "Temptation Greets You Like Your Naughty Friend". Dizzee's version of the same song was featured as "Temptation" on his third album.

The official US album was released on 29 April 2008; it contained two tracks not on the European release, but it did not include the track "Pussyole'". It was Dizzee's first album to be released under the [[Definitive Jux]] label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hhworlds.com/f11/01-21-08-dizzie-rascal-s-maths-english-gets-u-s-release-date-11632.html |title=''HHWorlds.com'' – Dizzee Rascal's Maths + English Gets US Release Date (January 21, 2008) |publisher=Hhworlds.com |access-date=22 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925022212/http://www.hhworlds.com/f11/01-21-08-dizzie-rascal-s-maths-english-gets-u-s-release-date-11632.html |archive-date=25 September 2013 }}</ref>

In 2008, Rascal recorded a song for suicide charity [[Campaign Against Living Miserably|CALM]]; the song "Dean" was about a friend of Dizzee's who took his own life. In December of that year, he was arrested following an alleged incident involving a baseball bat in southeast London. He was released on bail to return to a police station later in December.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7781151.stm |title=Online – Dizzee Rascal held in 'bat' probe |work=BBC News |date=13 December 2008 |access-date=22 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220101523/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7781151.stm |archive-date=20 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2009–2012: ''Tongue n' Cheek''===
[[File:Dizzee Rascal 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Dizzee Rascal performing with [[Muse (band)|Muse]] on their Stadium Tour in 2013]]
Rascal released his fourth studio album, ''[[Tongue n' Cheek]],'' on 21 September 2009. It included his four number-one hits "[[Dance wiv Me]]", "[[Bonkers (song)|Bonkers]] (with [[Armand Van Helden]]), "[[Holiday (Dizzee Rascal song)|Holiday]]" and "[[Dirtee Disco]]". Its release was announced on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'', where Dizzee Rascal revealed some details about the album, including track information and production. In a collaboration track with [[Chase & Status]] titled "Heavy", Dizzee Rascal said, "Grime had a little time without me still no grime without me, No life without me, no Risky Roadz, no [[GRM Daily|Grime Daily]]" seemingly seeking to create the impression that grime had petered out since he left the scene. On 23 May 2008, [[Calvin Harris]], whom he collaborated with on the number-one hit "Dance Wiv Me", revealed on his Twitter{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} that he was producing a Dizzee track; at the [[Evolution Festival]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], and when on tour supporting [[The Prodigy]], he confirmed that two new singles called "Road Rage" and "[[Dirtee Cash]]", both of which featured on the album, would be released. "Dirtee Cash" peaked at No. 10 and Road Rage was never released as a single.

At the 30th annual [[Brit Awards]], Dizzee Rascal won the award for Best British Male. He later performed a mash-up entitled "[[You Got the Dirtee Love]]" with [[Florence and the Machine]]. This collaboration was released as a charity single the following day and peaked at number 2 in the UK charts.

On 31 May 2010 Dizzee re-released the album ''Tongue n' Cheek'' with a few new tracks including "[[Dirtee Disco]]", which was released on 24 May 2010. The track went to number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

==Music and style==
When starting to make music in his teenage years, Dizzee Rascal "learned to rap fast" over drum and bass tracks with 170-180 bpm, in contrast to the slower tempos of UK Garage.<ref name=":1" /> He also recalls being influenced by [[crunk]] ([[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Lil Jon]]), grunge music, [[Black Sabbath]] and by [[Timbaland]]'s work around that time.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Hancox|first=Dan|date=5 May 2016|title=Track By Track: Dizzee Rascal's Boy in Da Corner|url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/05/track-by-track-dizzee-rascal-s-boy-in-da-corner|work=[[Red Bull Music Academy]]|access-date=17 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117233805/http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/05/track-by-track-dizzee-rascal-s-boy-in-da-corner|archive-date=17 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Rascal once told author Ben Thompson in an interview with [[The Observer|''The Observer'' magazine]] that "everything I do is for the music&nbsp;– I want to master it like [[Bruce Lee]] mastered martial arts".<ref name="Thompson, Ben. Observer's">Thompson, Ben. Observer's Music Monthly. 17 April 2007.</ref>

Rascal worked closely with his mentor [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], who created one of the first grime tracks, called "[[Wiley discography|Eskimo]]".<ref name="autogenerated3">[https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/03/21/050321crmu_music True Grime: The New Yorker<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308182928/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/03/21/050321crmu_music |date=8 March 2008 }}. ''[[The New Yorker]].''</ref> In 2005, music critic [[Sasha Frere-Jones]] observed that despite Rascal's large mainstream exposure, grime still was not having a commercial breakthrough in the US, although it was "becoming familiar".<ref name="autogenerated3" /> Rascal's DJ, DJ Semtex, said in 2004, "the biggest conflict I have is with major labels because they still don't get it".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3299204 |title=Collective - will grime pay? |publisher=BBC |access-date=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227170824/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3299204 |archive-date=27 February 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Andy Bennett and Jon Stratton highlight in the book ''Britpop and the English Music Tradition'' (2010) how Rascal alongside [[Sway (musician)|Sway]] and [[M.I.A.

The chart success of grime-influenced artists like Rascal is heralded as a signal in the way that white Britons are adapting to a new multicultural and plural musical mix in contrast to previous bands.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Andy |last1=Bennett|first2= Jon |last2=Stratton|title=Britpop and the English Music Tradition|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7546-6805-3 |oclc=663973447|pages=6–7}}</ref>

Dizzee Rascal has created his own record label, called Dirtee Stank. Dizzee Rascal's explanation of the name is, "The name came from one of the first lyrics I had: 'going on dirty/going on stank...' So I thought 'yeah, Dirtee Stank.'"<ref name="stankmyspace">{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/dirteestankrecordings|title=DirteeStankRecordings at MySpace|work=Myspace|access-date=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129030045/https://myspace.com/dirteestankrecordings|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Dizzee has stated "I had Dirtee Stank before I had my record deal."<ref name="stankmyspace"/> The first white label release of "I Luv U" was made on Dirtee Stank, released when he was 16,<ref name="first single">{{cite news |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/celebrity/article3945201.ece |title=Dizzee Rascal, Rebel with a Cause |work=The Times |location=London |access-date=23 July 2008 | first=Ed | last=Marriott | date=17 May 2008}}</ref> although both of his albums and their subsequent singles have been released under [[XL Recordings]]. It was not until 30 September 2005, that Dizzee Rascal 'revived' the label and made his first signings, Klass A<ref name="Simpson">{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,1472012,00.html| title=Dizzee Rascal seeks new urban artists| work=The Guardian| location=London| date=2 May 2005| first=Dave| last=Simpson| access-date=1 May 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222162155/http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,1472012,00.html| archive-date=22 February 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Newham Generals]]. The label's MySpace page states that the ethos of the company is "about bridging the gap between indie, majors and the street. Stank is the way forwards". The label's alternative logo is a picture of flies circling faeces – when asked why this logo was chosen, Dizzee stated that it was the "streetest thing I could think of".<ref name="stankmyspace"/>

The label was formed and is owned by Dizzee Rascal, and is co-run by Dizzee's manager, Cage, label manager, Laurence Ezra, tour manager Paddy Stewart and executive producer Teriy Keys. According to Cage, Dirtee Stank exists to promote gifted artists with "social problems" that might scare off other labels. "People who, through the conditions they live in, might not be stable."<ref name="Simpson"/> The label should also help artists overcome hurdles such as access to studios that "take something from a raw demo to something people will get excited about on the street".

The single "[[Dance Wiv Me]]", featuring [[Calvin Harris]] and Chrome, was released through the label on 7 July 2008; the track became [[Jo Whiley]]'s Pet Sound for the Week beginning 2 June 2008, thus gaining a large amount of radio airtime. The single charted at Number 1 on download sales alone, a week before its physical release. Dizzee's next two singles, "[[Bonkers (song)|Bonkers]]" and "[[Holiday (Dizzee Rascal song)|Holiday]]", were also released under the record label, and these two again charted at Number 1. Dizzee then released his 4th album on the label (Tongue N' Cheek) which along with three number ones spawned the top 10 hit [[Dirtee Cash]].

As of August 2011, the Newham Generals (D Double E & Footsie), [[Teriy Keys|Smurfie Syco]] and Pepper are signed to the label.<ref name="Dirtee Stank Official Website">{{cite web |url=http://www.dirteestank.com |title=Dirtee Stank |publisher=Dirtee Stank |access-date=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405203854/http://www.dirteestank.com/ |archive-date=5 April 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2014, [[Merky ACE]] was added to the Dirtee Stank line up.<ref>{{cite web |last=Patterson |first=Joseph |url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2015/06/premiere-merky-ace-cuss-match-produced-by-footsie |title=Premiere: Merky Ace Makes His Dirtee Stank Debut With "Cuss Match" (Prod.

===Politics===
Around 2004, tabloid newspapers were quoting one particular lyric by Rascal: "I'm a problem for [[Tony Blair|Anthony Blair]]."<ref name=villagevoice>[http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0403,chang,50366,22.html village voice > music > Future Shock by Jeff Chang<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328234033/http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0403%2Cchang%2C50366%2C22.html |date=28 March 2008 }}. 19 January 2004.

During the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 US presidential elections]], Dizzee gave a live interview to [[Newsnight]] presenter [[Jeremy Paxman]], in which he described [[Barack Obama]] as "an immediate symbol of unity". Addressed by Paxman as "Mr Rascal" at one point, he said he felt that hip-hop played an important part in encouraging young voters and humorously suggested that he could well one day become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. In the same interview Rascal stated that, "If you believe you can achieve, innit", thus showing his agreement with Paxman's humorous remark.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dizzee Rascal on Obama's win |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/us_elections_2008/7713237.stm |work=BBC News |date=5 November 2008 |access-date=6 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109140029/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/us_elections_2008/7713237.stm |archive-date=9 November 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Personal life==
In February 2008, Rascal's ex-girlfriend, model Kaya Bousquet, whom he had dated for two years, died in a high-speed crash on the [[M1 motorway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/dizzee-rascal-mourns-ex_1075511 |title=Dizzee Rascal Mourns Ex |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=27 July 2008 |access-date=6 February 2013 |archive-date=30 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330081012/https://www.contactmusic.com/dizzee-rascal/news/dizzee-rascal-mourns-ex_1075511 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Rascal revealed in 2010 that he plans not to use drugs or alcohol at all in the future. He told ''[[The Independent]]'', "I'm not having any alcohol. No weed. I'm not doing anything – except some boxing to release energy."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a214192/dizzee-rascal-gives-up-drugs-alcohol.html |title=Dizzee Rascal gives up drugs, alcohol – Showbiz News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=13 April 2010 |access-date=6 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528113406/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a214192/dizzee-rascal-gives-up-drugs-alcohol.html |archive-date=28 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2011, however, when asked what his favourite drink was during an interview with ''[[GQ]]'', he answered "Do I drink [alcohol] now?
