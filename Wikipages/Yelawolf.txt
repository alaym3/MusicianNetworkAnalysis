==Early life==
Michael Wayne Atha was born on December 30, 1979, in [[Gadsden, Alabama]]. He has described himself as "[representing] the people that are the core of America".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Macpherson |first=Alex |date=November 24, 2011 |title=Yelawolf interview: 'I represent the people who are the core of America' |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/24/yelawolf-rapper-interview |access-date=July 28, 2019 |ref=g01}}</ref> Yelawolf said his stage name was inspired by his father.<ref name="ICTMN">{{Cite web |date=June 7, 2012 |title=Yelawolf Addresses Cherokee Heritage |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/06/07/yelawolf-addresses-cherokee-heritage-116969 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231035310/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/06/07/yelawolf-addresses-cherokee-heritage-116969 |archive-date=December 31, 2014 |access-date=May 22, 2016 |website=Indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com |publisher=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=January 16, 2011 |title=Eminem Signs Cherokee Rapper Yelawolf |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/article/eminem-signs-cherokee-rapper-yelawolf-11976 |access-date=August 25, 2013 |website=Indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com}}</ref>  Throughout his childhood, Atha moved often.

The album debuted #3 on the American [[Billboard 200]]<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Yelawolf Love Story Chart History |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/yelawolf |access-date=February 12, 2019 |magazine=Billboard}}</ref> with 61,000 copies sold in its first week.<ref>{{Cite web |title=First Week Sales For Yelawolf's "Love Story" |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/first-week-sales-for-yelawolfs-love-story-news.15138.html |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=HotNewHipHop|date=April 29, 2015 }}</ref> The album is considered Yelawolf's most celebrated release among his fan base, but was found to be polarizing with critics due to the mixture of country and hip hop.<ref>{{Citation |title=Love Story by Yelawolf |url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/love-story/yelawolf |access-date=February 12, 2019}}</ref> Two singles from the album, "Till It's Gone" and "Best Friend" featuring [[Eminem]] have amassed over 100 million views on [[YouTube]], and eventually received a [[Gold certification]]s from the RIAA.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=Gold & Platinum |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=RIAA}}</ref> On June 8, 2018, ''Love Story'' also received a Gold certification for 500,000 units sold.<ref name="auto" />

=== 2016–2017: ''Trial by Fire'' and ''Hotel'' ===
{{main|Trial by Fire (Yelawolf album)}}
On August 25, 2015, Yelawolf was mired in controversy when he decided to defend the [[Confederate flag]]<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 25, 2015 |title=Yelawolf Defends The Confederate Flag |url=https://www.stereogum.com/1826620/yelawolf-defends-the-confederate-flag/news/ |access-date=February 21, 2019 |website=Stereogum.com}}</ref> before reconsidering his stance and entirely rejecting the flag with a non-album track titled "To Whom It May Concern" on October 30, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 30, 2015 |title=YelaWolf "To Whom It May Concern"c |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_kpJtu4gxc |access-date=February 21, 2019 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The single addressed his upbringings and his disgust with the [[Charleston church shooting]], a racially motivated mass shooting. After the controversy was settled on September 22, 2015, Yelawolf announced his fourth studio album, ''Trial by Fire''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 23, 2015 |title=Yelawolf Announces "Trial By Fire" Album |url=https://www.thisishiphopmusic.com/yelawolf-announces-trial-by-fire-album/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=Thisisihiphopmusic.com}}</ref> He alluded to the record being much darker than its predecessor, and also being produced entirely by himself and constant collaborators [[DJ Klever]] and Bones Owens, which were also members of his tour band.

Towards the end of 2016, Yelawolf was seen working with South Florida-based producer and constant collaborator [[Jim Jonsin]], although what they worked on remained a secret. October 10, 2016, the surprise free [[Extended play|EP]], ''Hotel'' was released.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf - Hotel - Download & Listen [New Mixtape] |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-hotel-new-mixtape.116570.html?song-117729 |access-date=November 29, 2016 |website=Hotnewhiphop.com|date=October 10, 2016 }}</ref> Hotel is an acronym for "House Of The Endless Life"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Persaud |first=Navi |date=October 11, 2016 |title=EP Review: Yelawolf's 'Hotel' EP Is A Glimpse Into His Past, Present and Future |url=https://emptylighthouse.com/ep-review-yelawolfs-hotel-ep-glimpse-his-past-present-and-future-111249 |access-date=February 21, 2019 |website=Empty Lighthouse Magazine}}</ref> with the production being entirely handled by Jonsin and Yelawolf.

The first two singles from ''Trial by Fire'', "Daylight" and "Shadows" featuring country singer [[Joshua Hedley|Joshua Headley]] were released in late 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 23, 2016 |title=Yelawolf Is Surrounded By Whiskey And Steel Guitar In 'Daylight' Video |url=https://uproxx.com/music/yelawolf-daylight-new-video-the-magnificent-seven/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=Uproxx}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Freeman |first=Jon |date=October 28, 2016 |title=Watch Yelawolf and Joshua Hedley's Haunting 'Shadows' Video |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/watch-yelawolf-and-joshua-hedleys-haunting-shadows-video-115208/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> In order to support ''Trial By Fire'', a tour was announced on July 18, 2016, and was due to run from October 13 to December 4.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf Trial By Fire Tour: Tickets On Sale |url=https://shadyrecords.com/2016/07/22/yelawolf-trial-by-fire-tour-tickets-on-sale/ |access-date=February 21, 2019 |website=Shady Records}}</ref> However, during the Oregon show, Yelawolf was seen [[Instrument destruction|destroying equipment]] belonging to Bones Owens, which subsequently caused Owens to fallout with Yelawolf and quit the band indefinitely (DJ Klever also left the band but would reunite with Yelawolf the following year). The incident was followed by an altercation with a fan at the Sacramento show resulting in Yelawolf leaving the stage and cancelling the remaining seven dates.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 28, 2016 |title=Yelawolf Cancels Tour Following Fight With Fan & Stage Meltdowns |url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.41450/title.yelawolf-cancels-tour-following-fight-with-fan-stage-meltdowns |access-date=February 21, 2019 |website=HipHopDX.com}}</ref> After the cancellation of the tour, Yelawolf seemed to suffer an apparent mental breakdown and was admitted to a mental ward. After his release towards the end of December, Yelawolf announced via social media that he was dropping the "Yelawolf" stage name in favor of his birth name, the removed Instagram post announced "I decided to sober up and rebrand my new music as Michael Wayne Atha MWA".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf Changes Name to MWA, Opens Up About Psych Ward Stay and Sobriety |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/yelawolf_changes_name_to_mwa_opens_up_about_psych_ward_stay_and_sobriety |access-date=February 21, 2019 |website=Exclaim.ca}}</ref> This came as a result of the death of long-time friend and collaborator Shawty Fatt and his break-up with fiancé [[Fefe Dobson]]. During this time, Yelawolf also drastically changed his country style to a contemporary hip hop image, before retreating from public life for over six months.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} During this period, the status of the unreleased ''Trial by Fire'' album and Yelawolf's involvement with [[Shady Records]] were left undetermined.

On June 6, 2017, Yelawolf announced a return to the music scene with the release of the third single for ''Trial by Fire'' titled "Row Your Boat",<ref>{{Cite web |last=India |first=Lindsey |title=Yelawolf Gives Preview of New Song and Video for 'Row Your Boat' - XXL |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/video/2017/05/yelawolf-preview-new-song-video-row-your-boat/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=XXL Mag}}</ref> with his "Yelawolf" moniker once again in use. Yelawolf launched another tour to support the album titled the "51/50" tour,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Yelawolf gears up for his 51/50 Tour |work=AXS |url=https://www.axs.com/yelawolf-gears-up-for-his-51-50-tour-120820 |access-date=February 12, 2019}}</ref> with the name alluding to the term police or doctors use towards patients that are an endangerment to themselves and others, referencing his mental breakdown from the previous year. During the tour, Yelawolf would re-visit all the venues that were cancelled during his previous tour, free of charge to those who had bought a ticket for the former. After multiple delays, ''Trial by Fire'' was finally released on October 27, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Berry |first=Peter A. |title=Yelawolf Releases 'Trial by Fire' Album - XXL |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/10/yelawolf-trial-by-fire-album-release/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=XXL Mag}}</ref> During this time, he also reunited with long-time fiancé [[Fefe Dobson]].

=== 2018–present: ''Trunk Muzik III'' and ''Ghetto Cowboy'' ===
{{main|Trunk Muzik III|Ghetto Cowboy (Yelawolf album)}}

''[[Trunk Muzik III]]'', the third major project in the ''Trunk Muzik'' series, was first hinted at in mid-2017, following Yelawolf's return to the music scene after a prolonged break.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 4, 2018 |title=WLPWR Details His Work On Yelawolf's "Trunk Muzik 3" & Big K.R.I.T.'s Double LP |url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.46115/title.wlpwr-details-his-work-on-yelawolfs-trunk-muzik-3-big-krits-double-lp |access-date=February 21, 2019 |website=HipHopDX.com}}</ref> Three months after the October release of ''Trial By Fire'', Yelawolf announced he had begun work on the project with long-time producer [[WLPWR]] , who also handled some of the production in 2010's ''[[Trunk Muzik]]'' and its re-release ''Trunk Muzik 0-60'', as well as producing the entirety of the second entry in the series, ''[[Trunk Muzik Returns]]''. The project also features production contributions from [[DJ Paul]] and [[Jim Jonsin]]. It was revealed that unlike the previous two ''Trunk Muzik'' projects, ''Trunk Muzik III'' would be his fifth studio album released under [[Shady Records]]. On July 27, Yelawolf began a 25-date tour to support the album.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 8, 2018 |title=Yelawolf Announces 'Trunk Muzik III' Tour 2018 Dates - Tickets on Sale |url=http://www.tickethub.co/yelawolf-trunk-muzik-iii-tour-2018-dates-tickets/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=Tickets at Ticket Hub}}</ref> During the tour, he premiered the then-planned first single for the album titled "Catfish Billy (Part 2)",<ref>{{Cite web |title=M.W.A YELAWOLF GHETTOCOWBOY on Instagram: "Just out here flexin that LOWFASHION son !! ..

During one of the shows, he announced that ''Trunk Muzik III'' would be his final album under [[Eminem]]'s label [[Shady Records]], and after its release.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mojica |first=Nick |title=Yelawolf's 'Trunk Muzik 3' Will Be Last Album With Shady Records - XXL |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/08/yelawolf-trunk-muzik-3-last-album-with-shady-records/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=XXL Mag}}</ref>

The album features a collaboration from [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] on the track titled "Rowdy", marking the end to a feud between Yelawolf and Machine Gun Kelly that began in 2011. A move many of his fans and fellow Eminem associates considered treacherous and unloyal. However, the song gained attention when it was mentioned in another publicized feud between Kelly and Yelawolf's record label boss, Eminem. On the diss track "[[Rap Devil]]", Machine Gun Kelly states "And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you".<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Decoding Machine Gun Kelly's Scathing Eminem Diss Track 'Rap Devil' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8473471/machine-gun-kelly-rap-devil-lyrics-decoded-eminem-diss-track-feud |access-date=February 12, 2019 |magazine=Billboard}}</ref> In anticipation for the release of the album, Yelawolf began a weekly freestyle series similar to the one leading up to his 2015 release ''Love Story'', claiming he would "release a freestyle every week until the album comes out".<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 1, 2019 |title=Yelawolf's Live 01/31/2019 about release TM3 & New Freestyle's |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGpUrH-mTzQ&t=1s |access-date=February 12, 2019 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The album was supported by the singles "TM3" featuring [[DJ Klever]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf Previews First "Trunk Muzik 3" Single "TM3" |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-previews-first-trunk-muzik-3-single-tm3-news.74478.html?_amp |access-date=September 10, 2019 |website=Hotnewhiphop.com}}</ref> and "Catfish Billy 2",<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf Drops "Catfish Billy 2" From Upcoming Album |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-drops-catfish-billy-2-from-upcoming-album-new-song.1982372.html?_amp |access-date=September 10, 2019 |website=Hotnewhiphop.com}}</ref> a sequel to the song from ''[[Trunk Muzik Returns]]''.

Following the period between the completion of ''Trunk Muzik III'' and its release, Yelawolf hinted he was beginning work on his sixth studio album, titled ''[[Ghetto Cowboy (album)|Ghetto Cowboy]]''. This would mark his first album to not be released under the [[Shady Records]] label, but instead under his own independent label, Slumerican.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gelenidze |first=Remy |date=March 17, 2018 |title=BREAKING: YelaWolf to drop "Ghetto Cowboy" shortly after release of "Trunk Muzik 3" |url=https://www.southpawer.com/2018/03/17/yelawolf-ghetto-cowboy/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=Southpawer}}</ref> During this time, Yelawolf dyed his hair red, which he claims is homage to [[Opie Taylor]], a character from [[The Andy Griffith Show]]. The first single from the record, titled "Unnatural Born Killer" was released on August 9, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf Reemerges With 'Unnatural Born Killer" Single |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-reemerges-with-unnatural-born-killers-single-new-song.1984054.html?_amp |access-date=September 10, 2019 |website=Hotnewhiphop.com}}</ref> In late 2019, Yelawolf launched his second tour of the year in support of the album, appropriately titled "The Ghetto Cowboy Tour".
As of October 2020, YELAWOLF has written four albums that are still set to be released titled MILE 0, MUDMOUTH, SOMETIMES Y, and Yelawolf Blacksheep.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf Ghetto Cowboy Tour |url=https://m.facebook.com/events/sokol-auditorium-and-underground/yelawolf-ghetto-cowboy-tour/392218261638071/ |access-date=September 10, 2019 |website=m.facebook.com}}</ref>

=== 2021: ''Yelawolf Blacksheep'', ''TURQUOiSE TORNADO'', ''Slumafia'', ''Mile Zero'' and ''Mud Mouth'' ===

On February 19, 2021, Yelawolf released ''Yelawolf Blacksheep'', an 11-track mixtape with fellow rapper [[Caskey (rapper)|Caskey]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf and Caskey spit bars on "Blacksheep" |date=February 19, 2021|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-and-caskey-spit-bars-on-blacksheep-new-mixtape.121248.html}}</ref> The first single from the record, titled "Been a Problem" was released on February 5, 2021.

In an Instagram post on March 23, 2021, Yelawolf revealed his upcoming ''April Onslaught'' event, in which the rapper announced four album releases in the month of April 2021, to be released weekly.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf announces weekly albums in April |date=March 23, 2021|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-announces-weekly-albums-in-april-news.128903.html}}</ref> In order, the releases were as follows:

==Public image==
''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that "In contrast to the gilded cage of privilege inhabited by Jay-Z and Kanye West, Yelawolf depicts everyday rural poverty with the evocative precision of a master storyteller". He is noted for his distinct style that ranges from [[Southern Gothic|American gothic]] to gore, the "richness and invention of his language" and range of his vocal style "from beer-swilling rowdiness to a crawling, contemptuous sibilance". He has said that he feels he represents "not the ideal American" but those Americans that he calls the core: "I love the grit of who we really are."{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

==Influences==
Yelawolf's early introduction to hip-hop came as a result of his mother's boyfriend being a sound designer for [[Aerosmith]] around the time that the [[Run-DMC]] version of "[[Walk This Way]]" was released, and made friends with the trio. Yelawolf recalls Run-DMC visiting his childhood home and giving him some [[Beastie Boys]]' [[Licensed to Ill]] cassette tapes.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=June 16, 2012 |title=Yelawolf Talks New Projects at Bonnaroo |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/yelawolf-talks-old-influences-and-new-projects-at-bonnaroo-242166/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> He has cited [[Outkast]] as his biggest influence when it comes to a "blend of sounds". He has stated on multiple occasions that the group's two seminal albums, ''[[ATLiens]]'' and [[Aquemini|''Aquemeni'']], are among his favorite hip-hop records of all time. He has also shared that the hip-hop and [[R&B]] collective [[Dungeon Family]] has had a major influence on his production style, as well as [[J Dilla]], [[Pete Rock]], [[CL Smooth]], [[Black Star (rap duo)|Black Star]], [[Hieroglyphics (group)|Hieroglyphics]], and the Brooklyn-based trio [[Digable Planets]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baltin |first=Steve |title=Yelawolf Is Taking His Music Stardom Into The Business World |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2016/11/07/yelawolf-is-taking-his-music-stardom-into-the-business-world/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=Forbes}}</ref>

Some of Yelawolf's other musical influences include: [[Johnny Cash]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[The Doors]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Metallica]], [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]], and [[N.W.A]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yelawolf's 25 Favorite Albums |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2011/11/yelawolfs-25-favorite-albums/25 |access-date=February 12, 2019 |website=Complex}}</ref> Yelawolf has also shown appreciation for Detroit-based recording artist [[Kid Rock]] and his mixing of [[country music]], [[rock music]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lacy |first=Eric |date=November 19, 2014 |title=Yelawolf on Shady XV contribution, Eminem's loyalty: 'It's an honor ...
