'''Rise Against''' is an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Chicago]], formed in 1999. The group's current line-up comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist [[Tim McIlrath]], lead guitarist [[Zach Blair]], bassist [[Joe Principe]] and drummer [[Brandon Barnes]]. Rooted in [[hardcore punk]] and [[melodic hardcore]], Rise Against's music emphasizes [[melody]], catchy [[Hook (music)|hooks]], an aggressive sound and playstyle, and rapid [[tempo]]s. Lyrically, the band is known for their outspoken [[social commentary]], covering a wide range of topics such as political injustice, [[animal rights]], [[humanitarianism]], and [[environmentalism]].

The band spent its first four years signed to the independent record label [[Fat Wreck Chords]], on which they released two studio albums, ''[[The Unraveling (Rise Against album)|The Unraveling]]'' (2001) and ''[[Revolutions per Minute (Rise Against album)|Revolutions per Minute]]'' (2003). Both the albums were met with underground success, and in 2003 the band signed with the [[major label]] [[DreamWorks Records|Dreamworks]], which was absorbed by [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]. Rise Against's major label debut ''[[Siren Song of the Counter Culture]]'' (2004) brought the band mainstream success, largely in part to the popularity of the singles "[[Give It All]]" and "[[Swing Life Away]]". The band's next album, ''[[The Sufferer & the Witness]]'' (2006), peaked at number ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States, and was Rise Against's first album to chart in countries outside of North America.

With the release of ''[[Appeal to Reason (album)|Appeal to Reason]]'' (2008), Rise Against's music shifted toward a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The album's third single, "[[Savior (Rise Against song)|Savior]]", broke the record for the most consecutive weeks spent on both the [[Hot Rock Songs]] and [[Alternative Songs]] charts. Rise Against's popularity grew with the release of ''[[Endgame (Rise Against album)|Endgame]]'' (2011), which peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200, and charted highly worldwide. The band's 7th and 8th albums, ''[[The Black Market (Rise Against album)|The Black Market]]'' (2014) and ''[[Wolves (Rise Against album)|Wolves]]'' (2017) continued the trend of commercial success, and both peaked with the top ten on the ''Billboard'' 200.

Rise Against is also known for their advocacy of [[progressivism]], supporting organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] and the [[It Gets Better Project]]. The band actively promotes [[animal rights]] and most of the members are [[straight edge]], [[PETA]] supporters and [[vegetarian]]s.

===Lyrics===
Rise Against is known for their outspoken [[social commentary]], which often permeates their lyrics.<ref name="PopMatters Lyrics">{{cite web|last=Hauck|first=Kiel|url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/158465-a-day-to-remember-rise-against-5-may-2012-cincinnati-oh/|title=A Day to Remember + Rise Against 5 May 2012 - Cincinnati, OH|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=May 20, 2012|access-date=December 1, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6fFa1yYm3?url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/158465-a-day-to-remember-rise-against-5-may-2012-cincinnati-oh/|archive-date=February 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Throughout the years, the band has discussed a wide range of topics, including [[animal rights]], economic injustice, [[environmental disaster]]s, [[forced displacement]], [[homophobia]], and modern warfare.<ref name="AllMusic SAW Review"/><ref name="PopMatters Lyrics"/><ref name="Post Gazette Lyrics">{{cite web|last=Mervis|first=Scott|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music-reviews/2012/05/07/Rise-Against-deep-Marilyn-Manson-worn/stories/201205070153|title=Rise Against deep; Marilyn Manson worn|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=May 7, 2012|access-date=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Political corruption is another subject commonly found in their lyrics, and as a result, Rise Against is often labeled as a "political band".<ref name="Political Band">{{cite web|url=http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2012/05/29/rise-againsts-tim-mcilrath-we-got-into-punk-rock-because-we-were-the-black-sheep/|title=Rise Against's Tim McIlrath: 'We Got Into Punk Rock Because We Were The Black Sheep'|publisher=[[KROQ-FM]]|date=May 29, 2012|access-date=May 7, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170501092912/http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2012/05/29/rise-againsts-tim-mcilrath-we-got-into-punk-rock-because-we-were-the-black-sheep/|archive-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref> Some journalists have stated that the band has specifically targeted the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] administrations of [[Presidency of George W.

As the band's primary [[lyricist]], McIlrath is wary of the political label. "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that's where we get the tag '[[protest song|protest music]]' or 'political punk rock'".<ref name="Political Band"/> He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss these topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics.<ref name="Post-Gazette 2006">{{cite news|last=Mervis|first=Scott|title=Rise Against Rises To The Occasion|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=July 27, 2006|page=W-15|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania}}</ref> In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: "I think that a lot of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [our music] 10 years from now."<ref name="Post-Gazette 2006"/> Principe noted the band does not attempt to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rauschert|first=Jeff|title=Rise Against continues its 'Appeal to Reason' through live show|work=[[The Flint Journal]]|date=November 1, 2008|page=F11|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/flint/index.ssf/2008/11/rise_against_continues_its_app.html}}</ref>

===Videography===
Rise Against will often produce an accompanying [[music video]] for a single. These videos typically either tell a narrative or feature documentary-like footage. This documentary style of filming can be seen in the music videos for "Ready to Fall", "Re-Education (Through Labor)", "[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]", and "I Don't Want to Be Here Anymore". These videos juxtapose footage of the band playing the song and footage of a certain societal issue such as gun violence or animal abuse, overlaid with damning facts about the issue.<ref name="Kerrang">{{cite web|last=Garner |first=George |title=The Ultimate Rise Against Videography |url=http://www.kerrang.com/24423/ultimate-rise-against-videography-by-tim-mcilrath/ |work=[[Kerrang!]] |date=February 15, 2015 |access-date=May 20, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gbBoGjsy?url=http://www.kerrang.com/24423/ultimate-rise-against-videography-by-tim-mcilrath/ |archive-date=April 7, 2016 }}</ref> For example, the video "Ballad of Hollis Brown" is about the dangers of [[intensive farming|industrialized farming]] and [[poverty in the United States]], and features interviews with farmers who are struggling to stay afloat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/rise-against-the-ballad-of-hollis-brown-20120113|title=Rise Against 'The Ballad of Hollis Brown'|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=January 13, 2012|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>

Rise Against's narrative videos are also usually political in nature.<ref name="Kerrang"/> In the video for "Prayer of the Refugee" the band destroys products in a retail store, with intermittent shots of foreign workers making the store products. The goal was for the video to showcase how conventional business models allow for various [[human rights]] violations.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR8lrI_UmOM | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/wR8lrI_UmOM| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Rise Against - Prayer Of The Refugee (Behind The Scenes) |publisher=Vevo |people=Petrossian, Tony (director) |medium=Behind the scenes video}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Some narrative videos follow the song's lyric thread, such as in the [[Hurricane Katrina]] based video for "Help Is on the Way", while other videos are used to enforce the song's message, such as the band's anti-homophobic stance in the "Make It Stop (September's Children)" video.<ref name="Kerrang"/>

Discussing the "Ready to Fall" video and need for politicized music videos, McIlrath said: "We looked at it from the perspective of hijacking the airwaves. If they're gonna give us three and a half minutes of airtime on TV that means we can play anything, we can make a video that would be intense even on mute".<ref name="Kerrang"/> Rise Against has garnered some controversy for their music videos, particularly for perceived violent themes. The video for "Re-Education (Through Labor)" features the Chicago sect of the [[Moped Army]] planting and detonating bombs throughout the city. Some viewers saw this as an act of condoning terrorism.<ref name="Kerrang"/> The video for "The Violence", which was to feature the detonation of [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of the forty-three United States Presidents on a plot of farmland, was prohibited by the farm's board of directors for "anti-government themes".<ref>{{cite web|last=Stutz|first=Colin|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7783506/rise-against-video-shoot-permit-pulled-anti-american|title=Rise Against Says 'The Violence' Video Shoot Permit Pulled Because It Was Deemed 'Anti-Government'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 2, 2017|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>

==Politics and ethics==
Their video for the single "[[Ready to Fall]]" contains footage of factory farming, rodeos, and sport hunting, as well as deforestation, melting ice caps, and forest fires. The group has called the video the most important video they have ever made. In February 2012 the band released a cover of the [[Bob Dylan]] song "[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]" as part of a benefit for [[Amnesty International]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Rise Against : Now Playing : Ready To Fall |url=http://www.riseagainst.com/player/default.aspx?mid=3460 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217132618/http://riseagainst.com/player/default.aspx?mid=3460 |archive-date=February 17, 2009 |date=June 16, 2006 |access-date=March 21, 2009}}</ref>{{secondary source needed|date=August 2020}} In addition to being vegetarians, all the members of Rise Against, with the exception of Brandon Barnes, are [[straight edge]]; that is, they refrain from consuming alcohol or using drugs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Munro |first=Kelsey |title=Rise Against prove you can be vegetarian and hardcore |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/gig-previews--reviews/rise-against/2006/11/28/1164476174601.html |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=November 28, 2006 |access-date=March 31, 2009}}</ref>

All VANS shoes, including the RISE AGAINST VEGAN shoe are manufactured in factories that follow strict guidelines that are designed to protect the workers involved in this process. The right to fair compensation, the right to associate freely and bargain collectively, the right to work free from discrimination and harassment, and the right to a safe clean workplace are among many of the guidelines that VANS and the factories that produce VANS are committed to. We are proud to work with such a progressive and legendary company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rise Against Vegan Shoe Manufacturing|url=http://riseagainst.com/blog/default.aspx?&in=74|publisher=RiseAgainst.com|date=27 August 2007|access-date=3 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208081231/http://www.riseagainst.com/news/default.aspx/nid/11769|archive-date=8 December 2007}}</ref>}}
