{{nihongo|'''Jun Seba'''|瀬葉 淳|Seba Jun|February 7, 1974 – February 26, 2010|lead=yes}}, better known by his stage name {{nihongo|'''Nujabes'''|ヌジャベス|Nujabesu}}, was a Japanese record producer, audio engineer, DJ, composer and arranger best known for his atmospheric instrumental mixes sampling from [[Japanese hip hop|hip hop]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[jazz]]. He released two studio albums during his lifetime: ''[[Metaphorical Music]]'' (2003) and ''[[Modal Soul]]'' (2005), while the album ''[[Spiritual State]]'' was released posthumously in 2011. Seba was the founder of the independent label [[Hydeout Productions]] and released two collection compilations: ''[[Hydeout Productions 1st Collection]]'' (2003) and ''[[Hydeout Productions 2nd Collection|2nd Collection]]'' (2007).<ref>{{cite web |title=Nujabes, Spiritual State |url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/46909/Nujabes-Spiritual-State/ |date=December 6, 2011 |website=[[Sputnikmusic]] |access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, Seba collaborated on the soundtrack for [[Shinichirō Watanabe]]'s [[anime]] series ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'' (''[[Samurai Champloo Music Record: Departure|Music Record: Departure]]'' and ''[[Samurai Champloo Music Record: Impression|Impression]]'') in 2004.

Although relatively niche during his music career, Nujabes has since achieved posthumous acclaim and been referred to as the "godfather" of [[lo-fi hip hop]], although his music also incorporates elements of [[trip hop]], [[breakbeat]], [[downtempo]], and [[ambient music]]. Credited with predating the genre's popularity in the 2010s, Seba has inspired numerous subsequent producers and imitators.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cortez |first=Kevin |url=https://genius.com/a/youtube-chill-a-glimpse-into-the-world-of-lo-fi-hip-hop |title=YouTube & Chill: A Glimpse Into The World Of Lo-Fi Hip Hop |date=April 24, 2018 |website=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref> On February 26, 2010, aged 36, Jun Seba died in a traffic collision.<ref name=tribute2015>{{cite news |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2015/02/24/music/nujabes-friends-remember-soulful-hip-hop-producer |title=Nujabes' friends to pay tribute to the soulful hip-hop producer on the fifth anniversary of his death |date=February 24, 2015 |last=Hadfield |first=James |website=[[The Japan Times]] |access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref>

==Biography==
Seba was born on February 7, 1974, in the [[Nishi-Azabu, Minato, Tokyo|Nishi-Azabu]] district of [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]] in central [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Seba was the owner of two [[Shibuya]] record stores, T Records and Guinness Records, and in 1998 founded the independent record label [[Hydeout Productions]].

==Career==
Seba adopted the [[stage name]] Nujabes (his name spelled backwards) and became notable for his approach to producing hip hop beats, often blending jazz influences into his songs creating a mellow, nostalgic and atmospheric sound. He is considered a pioneer of [[chillhop]] and [[lo-fi music]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Dayman |first=Lucy |url=https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/nujabes-the-japanese-icon-who-shaped-the-future-of-hip-hop/ |title=Nujabes: The Japanese Icon Who Shaped the Future of Hip Hop |date=September 10, 2018 |website=Culture Trip}}</ref> Seba collaborated with Japanese artists like [[Uyama Hiroto]], [[Shing02]], L-Universe, and [[Minmi]], and with various underground [[United States|American]] hip hop acts such as [[CYNE (hip hop group)|CYNE]], Cise Starr (as a solo apart from the hip-hop collective CYNE), [[Apani B]], [[Five Deez]], [[Substantial (rapper)|Substantial]], [[CL Smooth]], [[Fat Jon]], [[Terry Callier]] as well as [[United Kingdom|British]] rapper Funky DL. Seba was also a member of the production duo Urbanforest, an experimental collaboration with Nao T.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hydeout.net/inside/news.html |title=Hydeout Productions Information on Nujabes' Metaphorical Music and other works |website=[[Hydeout Productions]] |language=ja}}</ref> Seba collaborated with Shing02 on the critically acclaimed ''Luv(sic)'' [[hexalogy]], making the parts 1-3 together, but after Seba died unexpectedly many doubted that the series could ever be completed. However, parts 4 and 5 had already been completed, which were released shortly after Seba's death. Part 6 was not among the previously completed tracks, but it was released on February 26, 2013, on the third anniversary of Seba's death. According to Shing02's official Facebook page, the instrumental to what would eventually be part 6 was discovered on Seba's [[cell phone]] a few weeks after his death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614215818/https://m.facebook.com/ShingoAnnen/posts/10150679906628702 |title=History and future of Luv(sic) series |website=Shing02's official Facebook page |author=Shing02 |date=April 2, 2012 |access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref>

Seba was one of the most prolific contributors to the soundtrack of the critically acclaimed anime series ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'', which blends a [[feudal Japan]]ese setting with modern [[anachronisms]], especially in regard to [[Hip hop|hip hop culture]] such as [[graffiti]] and rapping.<ref>{{cite book |title=Roman Album: Samurai Champloo |last1=Watanabe |first1=Shinichiro |author-link1=Shinichiro Watanabe |last2=Kazuto |first2=Nakazawa |date=March 13, 2007 |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]] Inc. |isbn=978-1-59307-642-9 |page=55 }}</ref>

==Death==
On February 26, 2010, Seba was involved in a traffic collision upon exiting the [[Shuto Expressway]] at 22:14. He was pronounced dead at a hospital in Shibuya Ward after efforts to revive him failed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inquisitr.com/67021/nujabes-dead/ |title=Japanese Hip-Hop producer Nujabes dies |website=Inquisitir |date=March 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://thefindmag.com/news/news-nujabes-died-in-fatal-car-accident/ |title=News: Nujabes died in fatal car accident |website=The Find Mag |date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> His grave is located within the Japanese section of [[Tama Cemetery]].
