In a posting on his Myspace blog, Skinner noted that the group's upcoming LP would contain "peaceful, positive vibes" in comparison with 2006's "weird guilt-ridden indulgence" that was ''The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living.''<ref name=musicradar.com>{{cite web |author=Ben Rogerson |url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/the-end-of-the-streets-158121 |title=The end of The Streets? |publisher=musicradar.com |date=3 June 2008 |access-date=7 July 2020 }}</ref>

In a blurb about the album on Skinner's Myspace, he says, "This album started off life as parables but then I realised that it might get a bit cheesy so I got rid of the alien song and the devil song replaced them with more straight up songs. I've pretty much kept my promise that I made to myself not to reference modern life on any of them though which is hard to do and keep things personal at the same time."{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}
