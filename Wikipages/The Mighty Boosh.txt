'''The Mighty Boosh''' is a British comedy troupe featuring comedians [[Julian Barratt]] and [[Noel Fielding]]. Developed from three stage shows and a six-episode [[The Boosh (radio series)|radio series]], it has since spanned a total of 20 television episodes for [[BBC Three]] which aired from 2004 to 2007, and two live tours of the UK, as well as two live shows in the United States. The first television series is set in a zoo operated by Bob Fossil, the second in a flat and the third in a secondhand shop in [[Dalston]] called Nabootique.

Various members of The Mighty Boosh have appeared in a number of different comedy series including ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', ''[[Snuff Box]]'' and ''[[Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy]]'', and regular Boosh collaborators included [[Richard Ayoade]] and [[Matt Berry]]. The troupe is named after a childhood hairstyle of co-star [[Michael Fielding]].<ref name="naming">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ0Gondz_0g&feature=relmfu |title=How The Mighty Boosh got its name&nbsp;– Exclusive Mike Fielding Interview&nbsp;– BBC |via=YouTube |date=25 June 2009 |access-date=7 December 2012}}</ref>

==History==
Fielding first met Barratt after seeing him perform his solo stand-up routine at the Hellfire Comedy Club in the [[Wycombe Swan]] Theatre,<ref name=booshnight>{{cite episode| title = The Mighty Boosh: A Journey Through Time and Space| series = The Mighty Boosh| series-link = The Mighty Boosh (TV series)| airdate = 22 March 2008}}</ref> in [[High Wycombe]], Buckinghamshire. The pair soon found that they shared comic interests, formed a [[double act]], and "decided to be the new [[The Goodies|Goodies]]".<ref>{{cite news| last = Raphael | first = Amy | title = Boys from the Boosh | newspaper = [[The Observer]] | date = 21 October 2007 | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,,2193898,00.html | access-date = 29 March 2008 }}</ref> After their first performance together at a bar, De Hems, in London in April 1998, Barratt and Fielding developed their [[zookeeper]] characters – [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Howard Moon|Howard Moon]] and [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Vince Noir|Vince Noir]], respectively – in a series of sketches for [[Comedy Central (British TV channel)|Paramount Comedy]]’s ''[[Unnatural Acts (TV series)|Unnatural Acts]]''. Here they also met American [[Rich Fulcher]], who became [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Bob Fossil|Bob Fossil]]. Fielding's friend [[Dave Brown (comedian)|Dave Brown]] and Fielding's brother [[Michael Fielding|Michael]] also became regular collaborators. [[Richard Ayoade]] was another original cast member, playing adventurer [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Dixon Bainbridge|Dixon Bainbridge]], but [[Matt Berry]] replaced him in the first television series, since Ayoade was under contract with [[Channel 4]].<ref>''Inside the Zooniverse'', The Mighty Boosh: Series 1, BBCDVD1553.</ref> Ayoade returned in the second and third series as a belligerent [[shaman]] named [[List of recurring The Mighty Boosh characters#Saboo|Saboo]].
Noel Fielding and Michael Fielding have each separately stated that the name "Mighty Boosh" was originally a phrase used by a friend of Michael's to describe the hair that Michael had as a child.<ref name="naming" /><ref>Interview with Noel Fielding on [[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]] on 10 November 2006</ref>

The Boosh produced 3 stage shows – ''[[The Mighty Boosh (1998 stage show)|The Mighty Boosh]]'' (1998), ''[[Arctic Boosh]]'' (1999) and ''[[Autoboosh]]'' (2000) – all of which were taken to the [[Edinburgh Fringe]]. With the success of ''Autoboosh'', a [[The Boosh (radio series)|radio series]] was commissioned by the [[BBC]]. Produced by [[Danny Wallace (humorist)|Danny Wallace]], ''The Boosh'' was first broadcast in 2001 on [[BBC London 94.9|BBC London Live]], later transferring to [[BBC Radio 4]], from which the team were given a half-hour television pilot of the same name.

The [[The Mighty Boosh (series 1)|first 8-part series]], directed by [[Paul King (director)|Paul King]], was then commissioned for BBC Three and broadcast in 2004, with a [[The Mighty Boosh (series 2)|second]] of 6 episodes the next year. The second series moved away from the zoo setting to show [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Howard Moon|Howard]], [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Vince Noir|Vince]], [[Naboo the Enigma|Naboo]] the shaman and [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Bollo|Bollo]] the talking [[ape]] living in a [[apartment|flat]] in [[Dalston]].<ref>[[BBC]]. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/mightyboosh/interviews/ Where is series two set?], [[bbc.co.uk]].</ref> In 2006, the Boosh returned to theatre with ''[[The Mighty Boosh (2006 stage show)|The Mighty Boosh Live]]'', which featured a new story entitled "The Ruby of Kukundu".

After two years away from television, the Boosh returned in November 2007. Set in Naboo's second-hand shop below the flat, the [[The Mighty Boosh (series 3)|third series]] drew approximately 1 million viewers with its first episode,<ref>{{cite news | last = Barber | first = Nicholas | title = Noel Fielding: The comedian is returning to his first love&nbsp;– painting | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | date = 9 December 2007 | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article3229391.ece | access-date = 29 March 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071220022255/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article3229391.ece | archive-date = 20 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> and in light of its success, BBC Three broadcast an [[The Mighty Boosh#The Mighty Boosh Night|entire night]] of ''The Mighty Boosh'' on 22 March 2008, which included a new documentary and 6 of Barratt and Fielding's favourite episodes from all 3 series. [[J. G. Quintel]] has said that The Mighty Boosh was a large influence on his animated series ''[[Regular Show]]''.

In June 2013, it was confirmed that The Mighty Boosh would reunite for a US festival called [[Festival Supreme]] in October 2013.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-mighty-boosh/70791/.|title=The Mighty Boosh reunite to play Tenacious D's US festival |magazine=NME |date=11 June 2013 |access-date=12 June 2013}}</ref>

On 1 January 2020, Fielding posted an image of himself and Barratt on Instagram with the caption, "There really wasn't enough Boosh this decade ! let's try and rectify that in the next one ;) x".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B6yVsg2B9vW/ | title=Noel Fielding on Instagram | date=1 January 2020 | website=instagram.com | access-date=10 January 2020}}</ref>

==Theatre==
===Original stage shows===
====''The Mighty Boosh'' (1998)====
{{Main|The Mighty Boosh (1998 stage show)}}
The Boosh, then consisting of only Barratt and Fielding, conceived ''The Mighty Boosh'' whilst working on [[Stewart Lee]]'s [[Edinburgh Festival]] show ''King Dong vs. Moby Dick'' in which they played a giant [[Human penis|penis]] and a whale respectively.

In 1998, they took ''The Mighty Boosh'' to the [[Edinburgh Festival]], recruiting fellow comedian Rich Fulcher, whom the pair had met while working on ''[[Unnatural Acts (TV series)|Unnatural Acts]]''. The show won the [[Perrier Award]] for Best Newcomer.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-12-14|title=Profile: Noel Fielding|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/14/comedy.arts|access-date=2020-09-30|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> During their residency at North London's [[Hen and Chickens Theatre]] the following year, they built up a cult following, introducing new characters whilst developing old ones.

====''Arctic Boosh'' (1999)====
{{Main|Arctic Boosh}}
[[File:Mightyboosh2008tour.jpg|thumb|right|Poster used in magazines and venues around the UK to promote the Boosh's nationwide 2008 tour.]]
In 1999, the Boosh returned to the Edinburgh Festival with a new show, ''Arctic Boosh'', with [[Dave Brown (comedian)|Dave Brown]] acting as choreographer and photographer, as well as playing a variety of characters. ''Arctic Boosh'' sold out every night and was nominated for the [[Perrier Award]]. The show was directed by [[Stewart Lee]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/mar/14/comedian-stewart-lee The Guardian Interview – The Barnacle of British Comedy]</ref>

====''Autoboosh'' (2000)====
{{Main|Autoboosh}}
In 2000, the Boosh premiered their third stage show, ''Autoboosh'', at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, adding Fielding's younger brother Michael to the cast. ''Autoboosh'' won the festival's [[Barry Award (for comedy)|Barry Award]].

===Nationwide tours===
====''The Mighty Boosh Live'' (2006)====
{{Main|The Mighty Boosh (2006 stage show)}}
The Boosh returned to the stage in 2006, touring the UK for the first time. Though drawing heavily from their earlier material, the main story combined these elements into a new narrative. A recording of this show at the [[Brixton Academy]] was later released on DVD, before being broadcast on BBC Three on [[Boxing Day]], 2007.

====''The Mighty Boosh Live: Future Sailors Tour'' (2008/09)====
{{Main|The Mighty Boosh Live: Future Sailors Tour}}
The Boosh toured the UK and Ireland for a second time from September 2008 to February 2009.  The show featured characters from all three series as well as the Boosh Band.

They made appearances throughout the UK after their live shows, at after-parties held in different places in each city. The events were called "Outrage", after the catchphrase by [[List of recurring characters from The Mighty Boosh#Tony Harrison|Tony Harrison]].

==Radio==
===''The Boosh'' (2001)===
{{Main|The Boosh (radio series)}}
From the success of ''Autoboosh'', the BBC commissioned a six-part radio series for the Boosh. In October 2001 ''The Boosh'' radio series, produced by [[Danny Wallace (humorist)|Danny Wallace]], was broadcast on BBC London Live, then BBC Radio 4, and later on [[BBC 7]]. The show focuses on the adventures of a pair of zookeepers at "Bob Fossil's Funworld": socially awkward, jazz enthusiast Howard TJ Moon, and ultra-vain, fashion-obsessed Vince Noir. This also included voices from Lee Mack, playing such characters as the Plumber or the Gardener.

===Further appearances===
The Mighty Boosh returned to radio on 22 October 2004, in a one-off comedy special for ''[[The Breezeblock]]'', a show on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>Susie T. [http://themightyboosh.blogspot.com/2004/11/radio-1-breezeblock-mighty-boosh.html ''Radio 1 Breezeblock – The Mighty Boosh''], The Mighty Boosh News Updates, 17 November 2004.</ref> Instead of the plot driven nature of their own series, this show featured improvised conversational comedy with Barratt, Fielding and Fulcher, combined with the show's usual mix of electronic music.

On 15 November 2007, as part of the publicity for the premier of their third series the same day, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding returned to Radio 1, this time on [[Jo Whiley]]'s [[Live Lounge]].<ref>[[Jo Whiley]]. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/jowhiley/galleries/2673/1/ ''Mighty Boosh in the Live Lounge''], [[BBC Radio 1]], 15 November 2007.</ref>

On 9 April 2019, it was announced that The Mighty Boosh will be the UK ambassadors for the Record Store Day at 13 April 2019, a show on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-47854788''BBC Record Store Day 2019:The Mighty Boosh named UK ambassadors''] BBC news, 9 April 2019.</ref>

==Television==
===''The Mighty Boosh'' (2004–07)===
{{Main|The Mighty Boosh (TV series)}}
[[File:MightyBooshTitles.png|thumb|Opening titles of The Mighty Boosh on TV & film]]

In May 2004, after the success of a Boosh pilot, [[Steve Coogan]]'s company, [[Baby Cow Productions]], produced the first television series of ''The Mighty Boosh'' for BBC Three, before it moved to [[BBC Two]] in November that same year. Though each episode invariably starts and ends in Dixon Bainbridge's dilapidated zoo, the "Zooniverse", the characters of Vince and Howard often depart for other locations, such as the [[Tundra#Arctic tundra|Arctic tundra]] and [[limbo]].

A second series, shown in July 2005, saw Howard and Vince sharing Naboo's flat in [[Dalston]] with previously minor characters Naboo and his [[familiar spirit|familiar]], Bollo, a gorilla living at the "Zooniverse". This series had an even looser setting as the four characters leave the confines of the flat in every episode, travelling in their van to a variety of surrealistic environments, including Naboo's home planet "Xooberon".

Series three started in November 2007, still set in Dalston, but this time the foursome are selling 'Bits & Bobs' in their shop, the Nabootique.  Their adventures and outings in this series focused more on the involvement of new characters (e.g. Sammy the Crab, or Lester Corncrake etc.) rather than just the two of them.

Although BBC America originally aired only series 1 in the U.S (all episodes in their entirety), ''The Mighty Boosh'' began airing in North America on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] block (with up to 6 minutes cut from each episode), starting 29 March 2009 with the third series.<ref>Dragoncon08. [http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=25742 Adult Swim Panel Highlights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124182645/http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=25742 |date=24 January 2009 }}.</ref> In February 2016 series 1 of ''The Mighty Boosh'' was made available to watch via the online service BBC iPlayer for six weeks; this included every episode minus the final episode of the first series 'Hitcher'.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/group/b007wds5|title = BBC iPlayer – The Mighty Boosh|website = bbc.co.uk|access-date = 10 March 2016|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160309050146/http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/group/b007wds5|archive-date = 9 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

===''The Mighty Boosh'' Night===
On 22 March 2008, BBC Three broadcast a whole night of ''The Mighty Boosh'' from 9:05&nbsp;pm, starting with a new documentary titled ''The Mighty Boosh: A Journey Through Time and Space'', documenting the history of the Boosh from their first amateur performances to their then-upcoming 2008 tour. This was followed by six of Barratt and Fielding's favourite episodes from the three series: "[[Party (The Mighty Boosh)|Party]]", "[[The Power of the Crimp]]", "[[The Nightmare of Milky Joe]]", "[[The Priest and the Beast]]", "[[The Legend of Old Gregg]]", and "[[Tundra (The Mighty Boosh)|Tundra]]". The pair also appeared in live links throughout the night, in a similar style to the openings of Series 1 episodes.  On 23 December 2008, BBC3 held a Merry Booshmas Party featuring the entire series 3 as well as a broadcast of ''[[The Mighty Boosh (2006 stage show)|The Mighty Boosh Live]]''.<ref>[[BBC]].

On 8 February 2012, whilst sledging, Noel Fielding said that he and Barratt had discussed plans to make a Mighty Boosh film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/889746-noel-fielding-confirms-mighty-boosh-movie-is-on-the-way|title=Noel Fielding confirms Mighty Boosh movie is on the way|access-date=8 February 2012|date=8 February 2012|author=Christopher Hooton|publisher=Metro}}</ref>
