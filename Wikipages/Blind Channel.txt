==Career==
===Formation and early years (2013‚Äì2014)===
The band was initially formed in mid-2013 by classmates Joel Hokka and Joonas Porko who at the time were in as they describe it ‚Äúrival bands‚Äù and decided to join forces. They quickly recruited Olli Matela (who played previously with Joonas in other bands) and Tommi Lalli to play bass and drums respectively. Joel Hokka has stated that shortly after he was at a house party when he spotted Niko Vilhelm rapping and was so impressed that he asked him to join the band. Now a five-piece, whilst selecting a band name Niko suggested Blind Channel in reference to television channels such as MTV which they all grew up watching and wanting to be on as musicians, however by the time the band formed these channels were only showing reality shows and not so much music based. The band released their debut single "Save Me" (and accompanying music video) in October 2013 which was picked up by Finnish music outlet Ylex radio within one week and the band were selected as Ylex's "basement band of the week". Iltalehti, one of Finland‚Äôs biggest newspaper media‚Äôs also noticed the band‚Äôs first music video for "Save Me" and within a couple months the video had amassed over 20,000 views. They performed their first live show in a small rock club in Oulu, Finland in late 2013 before releasing follow-up EP "Antipode" on March 21st 2014, featuring singles "Naysayers" and "Calling Out" produced by Mikko M√§kitalo. The single‚Äôs B-side ‚ÄúNaysayers‚Äù saw daylight one week before the actual release, and the A-side ‚ÄúCalling Out‚Äù premiered on a local radio station Radio City one day before the release.  

===''Revolutions'' and ''Blood Brothers'' (2014‚Äì2018)===
In Summer 2014 the band performed at Finnish festivals J√§√§liCityRock, Provinssirock, Ilosaarirock, Qstock & Nummirock where they won the Wacken Metal Battle in Finland, securing a chance to perform at the European rock festival - Wacken Open Air in Germany on The Wet Stage. This was the band‚Äôs first show outside of Finland and the largest show they had played to date. Upon winning this competition, Finnish record label Ranka Kustannus also signed the band and they began recording their new material, later releasing the "Foreshadow" EP on October 4th 2014. Their debut studio album ''Revolutions'' was later released on September 29th 2016 and includes the singles "Unforgiving", "Don't", "Darker Than Black", "Deja FU‚Äù and "Enemy for Me". The band proceeded to tour throughout Finland and surrounding countries following this release. Huge pop music fans, in March 2017 they released a cover of American hip-hop duo [[Macklemore & Ryan Lewis discography|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's]] hit single "[[Can't Hold Us]]". 

They released their second studio album ''Blood Brothers'' on April 20th 2018. The album includes the singles "Alone Against All", "Sharks Love Blood", "Wolfpack" and "Out of Town" and track "Elephant In The Room" featuring fellow Finnish rapper Spaz Caroon. They also embarked on several tours both as headliners and supporting acts such as Amaranthe, Royal Republic, Simple Plan, Enter Shikari and in late 2018 completed their first UK tour supporting All That Remains and Sevendust. 

===''Violent Pop'' and Eurovision Song Contest (2020‚Äìpresent)===
The band‚Äôs third studio album,''Violent Pop'', was released on March 6th 2020. The album includes the singles "Over My Dead Body", "Timebomb (feat. Alex Mattson)", "Snake (feat. GG6 of Amaranthe)", "Died Enough for You", "Fever" and "Gun". The band had pre-booked a tour in Autumn/Winter 2020 around Sweden/Finland and festival slots as part of a touring cycle for ''Violent Pop'' which were cancelled as the Coronavirus pandemic came into effect. In May 2020 the band performed an acoustic livestream from 45 Oulu, the oldest rock bar in Oulu, Finland which included the live debuts of ''Violent Pop'' album tracks ‚ÄúFeel Nothing‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnemies with Benefits‚Äù. Additionally, they performed a tribute cover of Linkin Park‚Äôs ‚ÄúNumb‚Äù in honour of the late Chester Bennington. In July 2020, they released a studio version of Anastacia‚Äôs ‚Äú[[Left Outside Alone]]" and accompanying music video to critical success. {{cn|date=July 2021}}

After meeting DJ and producer Aleksi/Alex Mattson several years prior when Joel approached him to potentially remix a Blind Channel track, the band soon after discovered they had a lot of similar musical tastes and began collaborating, eventually releasing ‚ÄúTimebomb‚Äù together which featured as a single on the band‚Äôs third studio album Violent Pop. After a live festival show in October 2020 where the band featured Aleksi on samples/percussion, they officially asked Aleksi to join Blind Channel as a full-time member and became a six-piece.{{cn|date=July 2021}} 

In February 2021 the band participated in the [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021|Finnish national selection]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2021]] with the modern nu-metal track "[[Dark Side (Blind Channel song)|Dark Side]]".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Will Finland send a metal act to Eurovision 2021?|url=https://alterock.net/will-finland-send-a-metal-act-to-eurovision-2021/|url-status=live|website=Alterock |date=27 January 2021|accessdate=22 May 2021}}</ref> They won the selection with 54.3% of the vote (the highest in UMK history) and in May 2021 represented Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing in sixth place with a total of 301 points. Blind Channel received 218 of their total points from [[televoting]], while 83 points were received from juries. The band painted their middle fingers red for their performance of "Dark Side," after being informed that they could not lift a middle finger to the audience on the Eurovision stage due to the show's family friendly nature.<ref>{{Citation|title=LookLab Blind Channel ‚Äì Finland üá´üáÆ with NikkieTutorials|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFpNsQm6LzI|language=en|access-date=2021-06-17}}</ref> On 19 May 2021, days before they had even performed live in Eurovision, the band signed to [[Century Media]]/[[Sony Music]].<ref><nowiki>{{cite web|title=Blind Channel sign to Sony Music / Century Media|url=</nowiki>https://twitter.com/BlindChannelFIN/status/1395026359475449857</ref>

In June 2021 the band recorded a collaboration of their song ‚ÄúDark Side‚Äù with fellow Finnish artist [[Lauri Yl√∂nen]] of [[The Rasmus]]. The band stated that a follow-up single to ‚ÄúDark Side‚Äù had been mixed and would be released late Summer 2021. On July 4th 2021, the band announced via social media that ‚ÄúDark Side‚Äù is currently the most streamed Finnish song of 2021 with over 700,000 streams to date, beating out larger Finnish bands such as The Rasmus, Nightwish and HIM. The band also announced a 15-date Finnish headline tour taking place in July-August 2021. 

In early 2021 the band shared that they had already began writing new material and in June 2021 shared footage from their studio showing them recording material for a currently untitled fourth studio album set for release in Spring 2022.

They released new singles "Balboa" on 13 August 2021, and "We Are No Saints" on 12 November 2021.
