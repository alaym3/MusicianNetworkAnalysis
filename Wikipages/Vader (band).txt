'''Vader''' is a Polish [[death metal]] band from [[Olsztyn]]. Formed in 1983, the group was founded by then-bassist [[Piotr Wiwczarek|Piotr "Peter" Wiwczarek]] and guitarist Zbigniew "Vika" Wróblewski. Vader went through several lineup changes over the years, with Wiwczarek as the only constant member. Since 2011, the band has comprised Wiwczarek on guitars and vocals, guitarist [[Marek Pająk|Marek "Spider" Pająk]], bassist [[Tomasz Halicki|Tomasz "Hal" Halicki]], and British drummer James Stewart.

Starting as a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] group, Vader eventually went to [[thrash metal|thrash]], [[speed metal|speed]], and then in the late 1980s became a [[death metal]] band. It would not be until nine years after forming that they managed to release their debut album ''[[The Ultimate Incantation]]'' (1992); Vader has released eleven more studio albums since then. The band's name was inspired by [[Darth Vader]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Piotr Wiwczarek |language=pl |work=Kinofilia |url=http://www.film.com.pl/filmzycia.php |access-date=27 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503043205/http://www.film.com.pl/filmzycia.php |archive-date=3 May 2006 |quote=Piotr Wiwczarek: Ale, oczywiście, to Darth Vader był naszą inspiracją: postać tajemnicza, brutalna, pełna mroku, inteligentna, zgorzkniała, ale czasem romantyczna.

Vader was formed in 1983, the same year as the very first death metal pioneers [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] and [[Death (metal band)|Death]]. However, at this time Vader was a heavy/speed metal band, later evolving into thrash metal and then finally death metal for the band's first [[demo (music)|demo]], ''Live in Decay'', in 1986. Vader released another demo, ''Necrolust'', in 1989, but it was not until the band's third demo, ''Morbid Reich'', in 1990, that Vader gained international attention. ''Morbid Reich'' sold nearly 10,000 copies, making it one of the most sold metal demos ever. This success earned the group a contract with [[Earache Records]]. The songs from ''Morbid Reich'' would appear later on Vader's full-length debut album in 1992, ''[[The Ultimate Incantation]]''.

Due to communication breakdowns, the contract with Earache was terminated and the release of ''[[Sothis (EP)|Sothis]]'' and ''[[The Darkest Age: Live '93]]'', both in 1994, had to be released on different labels. In the meantime, Vader toured relentlessly, and in 1995, the band signed a [[recording contract|contract]] with [[Impact Records]]. Vader then released ''[[De Profundis (Vader album)|De Profundis]]'', ''[[Future of the Past (Vader album)|Future of the Past]]'', and ''[[Black to the Blind]]''. Then, [[Hammerheart Records]] re-released two early demos, ''[[Necrolust]]'' and ''Morbid Reich'', as the compilation ''Reborn in Chaos''. In August 1998, Vader released ''[[Live in Japan (Vader album)|Live in Japan]]''. Vader also recorded the ''Kingdom'' [[Extended play|EP]] and a VHS video entitled ''Vision and Voice'' around this time; both were released in December. In October 1998, Vader opened for [[Slayer]] during a show in [[Poland]]. At the end of 1998, Vader signed a contract to [[Metal Blade Records]].

Vader spent most of 1999 touring. In March, Vader embarked on their first headlining US tour, the International Extreme Music Festival 1999, and in May Vader played at [[Metalmania]]. In June, the band went on another European tour, and the rest of the summer was filled with numerous appearances at festivals in Central Europe. Vader concluded touring by embarking on a European tour with [[thrash metal]] band [[Testament (band)|Testament]].

In November and December 1999, Vader recorded the album ''[[Litany (album)|Litany]]'', which was released in March 2000, and recorded a music video for the song "Cold Demons," which appeared on a special-edition digipack. The release of the album was also supported by live shows, including April's [[No Mercy Festival]] 2000, and in June, the band embarked on a 30-date European tour with [[Vital Remains]], [[Fleshcrawl]], and [[The Crown (band)|The Crown]].

In April 2001, Vader released the EP ''Reign Forever World'', featuring re-recorded songs, cover songs, and live tracks. The band promoted the album intensively, touring Poland, Russia and Ukraine, and again in the US. In September 2001, they did another European tour with [[Cryptopsy]], [[Dying Fetus]], Catastrophic, and several other bands. This was followed by ten Polish appearances as part of the Thrash'em All Festival 2001, along with [[Krisiun]], [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]] and several Polish death metal and [[black metal]] bands.

In 2002, Vader released ''[[Revelations (Vader album)|Revelations]]'', and toured England, Scotland, and Ireland during the No Mercy Festival's dates. In May, the band released its first DVD, ''More Vision and the Voice''. In 2004, the band started recording ''[[The Beast (Vader album)|The Beast]]''. Recording sessions for the album were postponed in May due to an accident which injured the drummer, [[Krzysztof Raczkowski|Doc]]. He was replaced with Daray from the Polish band [[Vesania]]. Recording was finished in mid-July, and to support the album, the band toured again, appearing at over 170 concerts. The Europe-wide tour saw Vader's first trip to the [[Balkans]]. The most important gig of 2004 was at the [[Silesian Stadium]] in [[Chorzów]], where the band opened for [[Metallica]] in front of 50,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |date=1 July 2004 |title=Metallica w Chorzowie |url=http://muzyka.interia.pl/wiadomosci/news/metallica-w-chorzowie,507525,1842 |access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref>

In March 2005, long-time drummer, Doc, left the band due to struggling with alcoholism. Five months later, he died unexpectedly from heart failure. He was 34 years old.<ref>{{cite web |date=20 August 2005 |title=Former VADER Drummer DOC Dead At 35 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-vader-drummer-doc-dead-at/ |access-date=27 January 2006}}</ref>

In 2008, Novy decided to leave Vader after five years; Marcin Rygiel (ex-[[Decapitated (band)|Decapitated]]) replaced him on bass for the U.S. [[The Summer Slaughter Tour|Summer Slaughter Tour]] 2008. Reyash would join as a permanent bassist later in the year.<ref name="martinlive">{{cite web |date=16 June 2008 |title=VADER Parts Ways With Bassist, Announces Temporary Replacement |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vader-parts-ways-with-bassist-announces-temporary-replacement/ |access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
The name of American rock band [[Eagles of Death Metal]] was influenced by Vader. When a friend was trying to introduce [[Queens of the Stone Age]] frontman [[Josh Homme]] to the death metal genre, he played Vader's music. Homme called them "The [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] of death metal." After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. Afterwards, the phrase became the name of his band.<ref>{{cite web |last=Borufka |first=Sarah |date=12 March 2009 |title=Putting some fun in death metal |url=http://www.praguepost.com/night-and-day/stage/793-putting-some-fun-in-death-metal.html |access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref>
