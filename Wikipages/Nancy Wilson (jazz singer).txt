'''Nancy Sue Wilson''' (February 20, 1937 – December 13, 2018) was an American singer and actress whose career spanned over five decades, from the mid-1950s until her retirement in the early 2010s. She was especially notable for her single "[[(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am]]" and her version of the standard "[[Guess Who I Saw Today]]". Wilson recorded more than 70 albums and won three Grammy Awards for her work. During her performing career, Wilson was labeled a singer of [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[soul music|soul]]; a "consummate actress"; and "the complete entertainer". The title she preferred, however, was "song stylist".<ref name="nw-npr-bio">{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/people/2101390/nancy-wilson |title=Nancy Wilson, NPR Biography |publisher=NPR.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120125235/http://www.npr.org/people/2101390/nancy-wilson |archive-date=January 20, 2014 |access-date=January 29, 2012}}</ref> She received many nicknames including "Sweet Nancy", "The Baby", "Fancy Miss Nancy" and "The Girl With the Honey-Coated Voice".<ref name="nw-ebony-bio">{{Cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-159391748 |title=Nancy Wilson (Center Stage) (Biography) |date=March 1, 2007 |publisher=Ebony Magazine |url-access= |access-date=}}{{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref>

When Wilson met [[Cannonball Adderley|Julian "Cannonball" Adderley]], he suggested she move to New York City for career opportunities.

[[John Levy (musician)|John Levy]] sent demos of "[[Guess Who I Saw Today]]", "[[Sometimes I'm Happy (Sometimes I'm Blue)|Sometimes I'm Happy]]", and two other songs to Capitol. Capitol Records signed her in 1960.

Wilson's debut single, "[[Guess Who I Saw Today]]", was so successful that between April 1960 and July 1962 Capitol Records released five Nancy Wilson albums. Her first album, ''Like in Love,'' displayed her talent in [[Rhythm and Blues]]. Adderley suggested that she should steer away from her original pop style and gear her music toward jazz and ballads.<ref name="Nancy Wilson Biography" /> In 1962, they collaborated, producing the album ''[[Nancy Wilson and Cannonball Adderley]]'', which propelled her to national prominence with the hit R&B song, "[[Save Your Love For Me]]", and Wilson would later appear on Adderley's live album ''[[In Person (Cannonball Adderley album)|In Person]]'' (1968). Between March 1964 and June 1965, four of Wilson's albums hit the Top 10 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top LPs chart.

She was signed by Capitol Records in the late 1970s and in an attempt to broaden her appeal she cut the album ''Life, Love and Harmony'', an album of soulful, funky dance cuts that included the track "Sunshine", which was to become one of her most sought-after recordings (albeit among supporters of the rare soul scene with whom she would not usually register). In 1977 she recorded the theme song for ''[[The Last Dinosaur]]'', a made-for-TV movie which opened in theaters in [[Japan]].
