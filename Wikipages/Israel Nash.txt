'''Israel Nash''' (born January 5, 1981) is the recording and performing stage name moniker of American singer, songwriter, and guitarist '''Israel Nash Gripka'''.

==Career==
Originally from Missouri, Nash moved to [[New York City]] in 2006. Nash performed in clubs on the [[Lower East Side]] such as [[The Living Room]] and Rockwood Music Hall. In 2009, he independently released his debut solo album, ''New York Town'', which was recorded at The Magic Shop in New York's Soho neighborhood. ''New York Town'' was eventually picked up by Dutch label Continental Records Services in Europe and the UK.

His second album, ''Barn Doors and Concrete Floors'', was released on March 29, 2011. The album was recorded during the summer of 2010 on a small farm located in the [[Catskill Mountains]] in upstate [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]]. Nash recruited [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Steve Shelley]] to co-produce the album and play drums on all the tracks. Ted Young engineered the album. For this album, Nash drew from his circle of friends to form his backing band including [[Joey McClellan]] ([[Midlake]], [[The Fieros]]) on lead guitar, Aaron McClellan ([[The Fieros]]) on bass guitar, and Eric Swanson on bass, [[mandolin]], and banjo. Released by Continental Record Services, the album garnered further attention in Europe and the UK and received positive reviews in publications like [[The Independent]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Coleman|first=Nick|title=Album: Israel Nash Gripka, Barn Doors and Concrete Floors (Continental Song City)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-israel-nash-gripka-barn-doors-and-concrete-floors-continental-song-city-2265971.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=9 August 2013|location=London|date=10 April 2011}}</ref> ''Barn Doors and Concrete Floors'' was also chosen as the top album of 2011 by the Euro Americana Charts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yearlist 2011|url=http://www.euroamericanachart.eu/index.php/layout/2011|publisher=EuroAmericana Chart|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref> Extensive touring in Europe in support of ''Barn Doors'' helped Nash gain greater exposure.<ref>{{cite web|last=Persson|first=Joacim|title=Ackorden är på liv och död för Gripka|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/recensioner/article14461504.ab|publisher=Aftonbladet|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Östnäs|first=Magnus|title=Starka sånger ur myllan|url=http://norrteljetidning.se/kulturnoje/1.1364460-starka-sanger-ur-myllan.ab|publisher=Norrtelje Tidning|accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>

In late 2011, Nash left New York City and moved to [[Dripping Springs, Texas]]. His third record, Israel Nash's ''Rain Plans'', was recorded in the summer of 2012. ''Rain Plans'' was produced by Nash and again engineered by Ted Young. The album was tracked on a Studer 16-track 2" analog tape machine intentionally avoiding the use of modern digital recording technology. Nash's house outside of Dripping Springs served as the studio and residence for the band during the recording session. The band consisted of Nash's touring lineup from the Barn Doors album cycle, including drummer Josh Fleischmann, Joey and Aaron McClellan on guitar and bass (respectively), and Eric Swanson on [[pedal steel]]. Released by the London label [[Loose Music]] on September 30, 2013, the album received generally positive reviews from the European press.<ref>{{cite web|title=Israel Nash Gripka, Welcome to Loose!|url=http://loosemusic.com/israel-nash-gripka/israel-nash-gripka-welcome-to-loose|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-review-israel-nash-gripka-rain-plans-loose-8844788.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Holly | last=Williams | title=Album review: Israel Nash Gripka, Rain Plans (Loose) | date=29 September 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, ''Rain Plans'' was released in the US by [[Loose Music]] through Nashville based label services company [[Thirty Tigers]]. It quickly became a favorite on [[NPR]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/08/28/343414038/heavy-rotation-10-songs-public-radio-cant-stop-playing |title=Heavy Rotation: 10 Songs Public Radio Can't Stop Playing |publisher=NPR.org |date=2014-08-28 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}</ref> and several non-commercial radio stations such as [[KEXP-FM|KEXP]] in Seattle,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.kexp.org/2014/04/09/song-of-the-day-israel-nash-rain-plans/ |title=Song of the Day: Israel Nash – Rain Plans |publisher=Blog.kexp.org |date=2014-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Beckmann |first=Jim |url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/390142116/kexp-presents-israel-nash |title=KEXP Presents: Israel Nash |publisher=NPR.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}</ref> [[WXPN]] in Philadelphia, [[KUTX]] in Austin,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kutx.org/features/artist-of-the-month-israel-nash |title=Artist of the Month: Israel Nash |publisher=KUTX.org |date=2014-09-17 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}</ref> and [[KCMP|The Current]] in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

Nash and his band recorded ''Silver Season'' on tape at Nash's Texas ranch in 2015 which was released October 2015 to critical acclaim. ''Classic Rock'' magazine considered it "even more exquisite" than ''Rain Plans''. ''Q'' magazine highlighted its "subtly political messages", while ''Uncut'' called it "a terrific album". ''Mojo'' praised its "cosmic poetry, crunching guitars and swooning pedal steel".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/silver-season/israel-nash|title=Silver Season by Israel Nash |publisher=metacritic.com |date=2015-10-09 |accessdate=2018-01-05}}</ref>
