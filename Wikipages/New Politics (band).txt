It currently consists of [[David Boyd (New Politics)|David Boyd]], Søren Hansen, and Louis Vecchio.<ref name="Monger">Monger, James Christopher "[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p2124023/biography|pure_url=yes}} New Politics Biography]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved 2010-09-08</ref><ref name="Ryan">Ryan, Chris (2011) "[http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2011/01/21/posted-new-politics-new-drummer-video/ New Politics Get A New Drummer]", MTV Buzzworthy Blog, 21 January 2011, retrieved 2011-01-23</ref> The band's sound has been described as a blend of "punk, pop, and electronically induced dance rock".<ref name="Monger" /> They have released five albums: ''[[New Politics (album)|New Politics]]'' in 2010, ''[[A Bad Girl in Harlem]]'' in 2013, ''[[Vikings (album)|Vikings]]'' in 2015, ''[[Lost in Translation (New Politics album)|Lost in Translation]]'' in 2017 and ''An Invitation to an Alternate Reality'' in 2019 and are best known for their singles "[[Yeah Yeah Yeah (New Politics song)|Yeah Yeah Yeah]]" and "[[Harlem (New Politics song)|Harlem]]".

==History==
After writing songs together for three years for their respective solo albums (which were never produced), Boyd and Hansen realized they had a group forming. In 2009, the duo sent two of their songs ("Stress" and "Money") in to the Danish National Radio P3's Karriere Kanonen ("Career Cannon") competition. Of the 973 bands that entered, New Politics was one of 42 selected to perform—despite not yet being an official band, and not having selected the final line-up.  Boyd and Hansen hired Poul Amaliel to play drums.  The new trio were among the top four winners and went on to play in a major music festival in Denmark.<ref name= blast>{{cite web

On August 2, 2017, New Politics announced that their fourth studio album [[Lost in Translation (New Politics album)|Lost in Translation]] would be released on October 6, 2017 and released a new single "CIA" the day after.
