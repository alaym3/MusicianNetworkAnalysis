==Career==

Monáe appeared on the [[Purple Ribbon All-Stars]] album ''[[Got Purp?

Monáe signed to the label, Bad Boy, in 2006. The label's chief role was to facilitate her exposure on a much broader scale rather than developing the artist and music, because in the words of Mitchell, "She was already moving, she already had her records{{snd}}she had a self-contained movement." Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment."<ref name= "hitquarters.com"/>

===2007–2011: ''Metropolis'' and ''The ArchAndroid''===

[[File:Janellemonae (300dpi).jpg|thumb|right|Monáe performing at the Austin Music Hall in 2009]]

In 2007, Monáe released her first solo work, ''Metropolis.'' It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or "suites", which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, ''[[Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase)]]'' in mid-2007, these plans were altered following signing with [[Sean Combs]]'s label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled ''Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition)'' and included two new tracks. The EP was critically acclaimed, garnering Monáe a 51st Annual Grammy Awards [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance|Best Urban/Alternative Performance]] for the single "[[Many Moons (song)|Many Moons]]",<ref name="grammy">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729112653/http://blogs.grammy.com/_Janelle-Mone-Interview/blog/179134/84386.html |archive-date=July 29, 2010 |url=http://blogs.grammy.com/_Janelle-Mone-Interview/blog/179134/84386.html |title=Janelle Monáe Interview – 51st Grammy Awards Blog post |work= Grammy.com |access-date=October 5, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> festival appearances and opening slots for [[indie pop]] band [[of Montreal]].

<blockquote>Cindy is an android and I love speaking about the android because they are the new "other". People are afraid of the other and I believe we're going to live in a world with androids because of technology and the way it advances.

The website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective asserts "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk."<ref name="Valnes2017" /> Monáe has also referred to herself as a "funkstress".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=English|first=Daylanne K.|date=2013|title=Now We Want Our Funk Cut: Janelle Monáe's Neo-Afrofuturism|journal=American Studies|volume=52|issue=4|pages=217–230|doi=10.1353/ams.2013.0116|s2cid=145307593|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/528301}}</ref>

Monáe's roots in [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], Kansas, where she was born and raised, are evident in her lyrics and style. According to Carrie Battan's [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] feature on Monáe, the song "Ghetto Woman" directly addresses Monáe's working-class K.C., Kansas mother{{snd}}as well as the portrayal of working-class black women in U.S. culture{{snd}}with the line "Carry on, ghetto woman, even when the news portrays you less than you could be."<ref name="Pitchfork cover story">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/janelle-monae/ |title=Cover Story: Janelle Monáe &#124; Features |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |access-date=February 11, 2014}}</ref> Monáe also told the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' she has internalized her KCK (K.C., KS) roots by wearing the working-class uniform of her parents and expressing concern that she cannot let "her community down".<ref name="Evening Standard">{{cite news|last=Gardner |first=Jasmine |date=July 4, 2011 |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/rnb-sensation-janelle-mone-is-here-because-we-need-her-6418158.html |title=RnB sensation Janelle Monáe is here because we need her |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |location=London |access-date=June 9, 2013}}</ref> On the album ''The ArchAndroid'', especially in songs like "Cold War" or "BabopbyeYa", Monáe relates "the dystopian cityscapes depicted in Metropolis to the boarded-up projects of poverty-wracked Kansas".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04889-janelle-mon-e-the-archandroid-afrofuturism |title=Janelle Monáe: A New Pioneer of Afrofuturism |first=John |last=Calvert |work=[[The Quietus]] |date=September 2, 2010 |access-date=June 24, 2014}}</ref> Kansas City, therefore, not only represents Monáe's physical roots within her hometown, but also serves as an important influence on the lyrics and science-fictional setting.

Monáe's signature style is her [[tuxedo]] wardrobe. She said "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could be buried in it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing.

==Personal life==

During a 2011 interview with ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', Monáe said she "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter-ego found in many of her songs. She also said, "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a black woman{{nbsp}}... what I want is for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'other' to connect with the music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation "in due time".<ref name="Evening Standard"/> In 2013, Monáe said she wants both men and women to "still be attracted to [her]" and expressed support for the [[LGBTQ community]].<ref name="okayplayer">{{cite web| url= http://www.okayplayer.com/news/janelle-monae-sway-in-the-morning-interview-sexuality.html|title=Janelle Monáe on Dating and Sexuality – Sway in the Morning |work=[[Okayplayer]]|author=Dayfloat|date=September 24, 2013 |access-date=June 25, 2015}}</ref>

Monáe has said she identifies with both [[bisexuality]] and [[pansexuality]].<ref name= "frees" /> On January 10, 2020, she tweeted the [[hashtag]] #IAmNonbinary, along with a quoted tweet, which trended on Twitter that day.<ref>{{Cite tweet |number=1215782996965355521 |user=JanelleMonae |title=#IAmNonbinary |date=January 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/carmineieroway/status/1215677098179751938|title=There is absolutely nothing better than living outside the gender binary. #IAmNonbinary pic.twitter.com/1ttgRBeRdm|last=Carmine|date=January 10, 2020|website=@carmineieroway|language=en|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Street |first1=Mikelle |title=Janelle Monáe Just Tweeted 'I Am Nonbinary' |url=https://www.out.com/celebs/2020/1/10/janelle-monae-just-tweeted-i-am-nonbinary |website=Out |access-date=January 11, 2020 |date=January 10, 2020}}</ref> Monáe said in an interview with [[New York (magazine)#The Cut|The Cut]] a month after the tweet that "I tweeted the #IAmNonbinary hashtag in support of Nonbinary Day and to bring more awareness to the community.
