Over a career spanning {{Age|1968|1|1}} years, UFO have released 22 studio albums, 14 live recordings, 16 compilation albums and one [[The Salentino Cuts|album of cover songs]].

==History==
===Beginning (1968–1972)===
{{more citations needed|date=May 2012}}
Lead singer [[Phil Mogg]], guitarist Mick Bolton, bassist [[Pete Way]] and drummer [[Andy Parker (musician)|Andy Parker]] formed the band in 1968.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Having originally called themselves Hocus Pocus, the group changed their name in October 1969 to UFO,<ref name="LarkinHM">{{cite book |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal]] |publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]] |edition=second |date=1995 |pages=372–373 |isbn=0-85112-656-1}}</ref> in honour of the London club where they were spotted by Noel Moore, who signed them to the Beacon Records label, headed by Antiguan-born Milton Samuel. Their first album, ''[[UFO 1]]'', released in 1970, is a typical example of early [[hard rock]]; it includes a heavy version of the [[Eddie Cochran]] classic "[[C'mon Everybody]]". Neither their first nor their second album, ''[[UFO 2: Flying]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Flying - UFO &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/flying-mw0000710435 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> was successful, but the song "Boogie For George" from the first album reached No. 30 on the German singles chart, and "Prince Kajuku" from ''Flying'' reached No. 26. At this time UFO attracted little interest in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and America.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> Some of their early work was strongly influenced by [[space rock]] (their second album, featuring a 26-minute title track and a 19-minute-long track "Star Storm", was subtitled ''One Hour Space Rock'') that was modestly popular at the time, but the band soon realised the style was somewhat limited. Mick Bolton left the group in January 1972, and UFO set out to find a guitarist who could provide the band with a more standard rock sound.

===International success (1973–1978)===
After brief trial runs with [[Larry Wallis]] (February – October 1972) and [[Bernie Marsden]] (who toured with UFO in Europe and recorded a pair of demos, "Oh My" and "Sixteen") the band recruited [[Michael Schenker]] from the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] in June 1973.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> Schenker was only 18 at the time but was already a well-respected guitarist. On a new label, [[Chrysalis Records]], the revamped UFO recorded a non-LP single in 1973, "Give Her the Gun" and "Sweet Little Thing" with producer [[Derek Lawrence]]. In 1974, under producer [[Leo Lyons]] (formerly of [[Ten Years After]]), UFO recorded ''[[Phenomenon (UFO album)|Phenomenon]]'', which highlighted the band's harder-edged guitar sound.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> ''Phenomenon'' contains many fan favourites such as "[[Doctor Doctor (UFO song)|Doctor Doctor]]" (later a minor hit single as a live track) and "Rock Bottom" (which was extended live to provide a showcase for Schenker).<ref name="LarkinHM"/> By the time of the ''Phenomenon'' tour, ex-[[Skid Row (Irish band)|Skid Row]] guitarist [[Paul Chapman (musician)|Paul "Tonka" Chapman]] joined the group, but he left in January 1975 to form [[Lone Star (band)|Lone Star]].

Two subsequent albums, ''[[Force It]]'' (July 1975) and ''[[No Heavy Petting]]'' (May 1976; recorded with ex-[[Heavy Metal Kids]]' [[Danny Peyronel]], who served as a regular keyboardist as well as harmony vocalist and songwriter),<ref name="LarkinHM"/> and extensive touring brought UFO increased visibility with American audiences and increased their following in the UK. The song "Belladonna" from ''No Heavy Petting'' was very popular in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], owing to a cover version by [[Alexander Barykin]].

In July 1976, the band recruited [[keyboardist]] and rhythm guitarist [[Paul Raymond (musician)|Paul Raymond]] from [[Savoy Brown]] to make 1977's ''[[Lights Out (UFO album)|Lights Out]]''.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> This album, the pinnacle of UFO's studio career, includes among others the songs "Too Hot to Handle", "Lights Out", and the seven-minute opus "Love to Love". With ''Lights Out'', the band received substantial critical acclaim,<ref name="LarkinHM"/> and the album saw the band playing at arenas and theaters across the United States and Europe, opening for bands like [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[AC/DC]].<ref name="cygnus x1">{{cite web |url=https://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/tourdates.php |title=Rush Concert Tour Dates Listing |access-date=May 19, 2021 |publisher=cygnus-x1.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ac-dc.net/archive/acdc_tour_history.php?subcategory_tour_id=6 |title=AC/DC Tour History - 1977 "Let There Be Rock" World Tour |access-date=May 19, 2021 |publisher=ac-dc.net}}</ref> With their new-found success, the band went back into the studio to record their next album ''[[Obsession (UFO album)|Obsession]]'' (1978). While ''Obsession'' was not as successful as ''Lights Out'', the band still maintained their arena status while touring for the album, playing with AC/DC and Rush again,<ref name="cygnus x1"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ac-dc.net/archive/acdc_tour_history.php?subcategory_tour_id=7 |title=AC/DC Tour History - 1978 "Powerage" World Tour |access-date=May 19, 2021 |publisher=ac-dc.net}}</ref> and other bands like [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Foghat]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[REO Speedwagon]] and [[Molly Hatchet]];<ref name="concertarchives">{{cite web |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/ufo?page=6#concert-table |title=UFO's Concert & Tour History |access-date=May 19, 2021 |publisher=concertarchives.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/drugs-drink-and-disorder-ufo-look-back-at-the-making-of-strangers-in-the-night |title=UFO's Strangers In The Night: how the album was made |access-date=May 19, 2021 |publisher=loudersound.com}}</ref> as part of the ''Obsession'' tour, UFO recorded the live album, ''[[Strangers in the Night (UFO album)|Strangers in the Night]]'', which was released in January 1979.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> ''Strangers'' was a critical and commercial success, reaching Number 7 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] in February 1979,<ref name="LarkinHM"/> and a tour to support the live album followed, playing with bands like AC/DC, [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]] and [[Judas Priest]],<ref name="concertarchives"/><ref>{{cite web |title=UFO's Concert & Tour History |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/ufo?page=5#concert-table |access-date=May 19, 2021 |publisher=concertarchives.org}}</ref> and appearing at the California World Music Festival with [[Aerosmith]], [[Van Halen]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]] and [[April Wine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vhnd.com/2014/04/08/35-years-ago-van-halen-plays-the-california-world-music-festival/ |title=Backstage with Van Halen at the CaliFFornia World Music Festival |access-date=May 19, 2021 |publisher=vhnd.com}}</ref>

===Post-Schenker era and hiatuses (1978–1990)===
Tensions began to grow between Mogg and Schenker in the late 1970s, possibly from Schenker often leaving before or during shows. Soon after UFO's show in [[Palo Alto, California]], on 29 October 1978, Schenker left the band.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> He made a brief return to the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] before going on to form his own [[Michael Schenker Group]].<ref name="Music Legends">{{cite web |last=Saulnier |first=Jason |title=Michael Schenker Interview |url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/michael-schenker-interview/ |publisher=Music Legends |date=23 January 2009 |access-date=6 May 2013}}</ref>

After Schenker's exit, UFO rehired Paul Chapman on guitar,<ref name="LarkinHM"/> who brought over unused track ideas from Lone Star's drummer Dixie Lee. Shortly afterward they released their next LP, ''[[No Place to Run (album)|No Place to Run]]'', in January 1980. Produced by former [[Beatles]] producer [[George Martin]], ''No Place To Run'' failed to match up to the success of its predecessors,<ref name="LarkinHM"/> though it fractionally missed the UK Top 10. Paul Raymond left the band at the end of the ''No Place To Run'' tour, and was replaced by [[John Sloman]] from [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] on keyboards for a couple of months and then by former [[Wild Horses (British band)|Wild Horses]] guitarist and keyboardist [[Neil Carter (musician)|Neil Carter]], who helped fill the void in the songwriting left by Schenker's departure.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> Carter debuted with UFO on stage at the three-day [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]] on 23 August 1980, when the band played as the Saturday night headline act.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book |last=Tobler |first=John |title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |publisher=Reed International Books Ltd |location=London |edition=1st |year=1992 |page=345 |id=CN 5585}}</ref> At the beginning of the following year, UFO released the self-produced ''[[The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent]]'', which had a lighter [[pop rock]] sound, which was popular at the time. The album achieved mild success in the UK, reaching the UK Top 20, and the single "Lonely Heart" was released.

In February 1982, the band released ''[[Mechanix (album)|Mechanix]]''. It was successful in the UK, where it reached No. 8, the band's highest ever placing. Later that year, founding member Pete Way left the band to form [[Fastway (band)|Fastway]] with [[Motörhead]] guitarist "Fast" [[Eddie Clarke (musician)|Eddie Clarke]] and then his own band, [[Waysted]]. He was replaced by Talas bassist [[Billy Sheehan]]. UFO released ''[[Making Contact (album)|Making Contact]]'' in 1983, but the album was a critical and commercial failure.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> Thus, that March, UFO decided to disband.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2">{{cite book |last=Tobler |first=John |title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |publisher=Reed International Books Ltd |year=1992 |page=378 |id=CN 5585}}</ref> The band played a UK farewell tour with [[Paul Gray (English musician)|Paul Gray]] (former bassist with [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]] and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]]). However, there was a hint that this might not be permanent when UFO released a [[compilation album]] featuring songs by UFO (as well as other groups featuring ex-members of UFO) entitled ''Headstone'', the [[Record sleeve|sleeve]] of which showed a headstone, denoting UFO with their formation date but an incomplete end date.

This proved to be a short hiatus; just short of two years later, in late 1984, Mogg assembled a new UFO line-up, featuring Paul Gray on bass again, ex-[[Diamond Head (English band)|Diamond Head]] drummer [[Robbie France]] (replaced in 1985 by former [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]] drummer Jim Simpson), and [[Tommy McClendon|Atomik Tommy M]] (Tommy McClendon), a former roadie who also wrote lyrics for [[Loudness (band)|Loudness]], on guitar, with Paul Raymond rejoining shortly afterward,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beatsworking.tv/UFO/family80to89.html |title=UFO – Family Tree – 1980 to 1990 |website=Beatsworking.tv |access-date=28 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016005501/http://www.beatsworking.tv/UFO/family80to89.html |archive-date=16 October 2012}}</ref> and released ''[[Misdemeanor (UFO album)|Misdemeanor]]''. Raymond left again in 1986 and was replaced by David Jacobson, who along with Gray would leave in 1987, and Pete Way rejoined on bass. Before Gray's departure, the band recorded the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Ain't Misbehavin' (UFO album)|Ain't Misbehavin]]'' which was released in 1988. Despite the renewed activity of the band, neither release was financially successful and they officially disbanded again in 1989 after a string of guitarists replacing McClendon: Myke Gray of [[Jagged Edge (rock band)|Jagged Edge]] in late 1987,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beatsworking.tv/UFO/articles_dec_87.html |title=UFO – Press Articles – 1987 |website=Beatsworking.tv |access-date=28 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524093403/http://www.beatsworking.tv/UFO/articles_dec_87.html |archive-date=24 May 2016  }}</ref> former [[Starfighters (band)|Starfighters]] guitarist Rik Sandford and Tony Glidewell  in 1988, and finally in 1989 future [[Marc Ferrari|Cold Sweat]] guitarist Erik Gamans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://soniclibrarian.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415010434/http://www.soniclibrarian.net/about.html|url-status=dead|title=About|archive-date=15 April 2013|website=Soniclibrarian.com}}</ref>

===Reunion(s) (1991–2003)===
In 1991, Mogg and Way decided to put a new UFO line-up together with former Wild Horses members [[Clive Edwards]] on drums and [[Laurence Archer]] on guitar joining the band and released ''[[High Stakes & Dangerous Men]]''. While only released on a small independent label, ''High Stakes'' was enough to generate serious interest in a full-blown reunion. The following year, the classic late-1970s UFO line-up – Mogg, Schenker, Way, Raymond and Parker – reunited, and the resulting album was ''[[Walk on Water (UFO album)|Walk on Water]]'' (1995). This line-up (barring Parker's replacement by [[AC/DC]]'s [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]] on drums) went on a world tour. However, tensions arose again, and Schenker left the band only four shows into the tour, walking off stage mid-set in the very same city, of Palo Alto, CA, where their October 1978 tour died. Thereafter, the other members again went their separate ways. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} However, Schenker returned to the fold in 1998 and the band embarked on another tour, with Parker again replaced by a new drummer. They played at the Astoria, Charing Cross Road, London in 1998.

Phil Mogg and Pete Way continued working together throughout this fluctuating band membership, releasing two albums under the Mogg/Way name in the late 1990s, ''Edge of the World'' and ''Chocolate Box''.

In 2000, Schenker rejoined UFO again and the band released the double CD ''[[Covenant (UFO album)|Covenant]]'' (with [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums), which contained a disc of new material and a disc of live classics. In 2002, the band recorded ''[[Sharks (album)|Sharks]]''; shortly after ''Sharks'' was released, Schenker left the band yet again and was replaced with [[Vinnie Moore]].<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5725/biography|pure_url=yes}} UFO on AllMusic]</ref> and the official announcement was made in July 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-vinnie-moore-jason-bonham-join-ufo/ |title=It's Official: Vinnie Moore, Jason Bonham Join Ufo |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=29 July 2003 |access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref> In 2003, Michael Schenker and Pete Way released ''The Plot'' with drummer Jeff Martin.

===Vinnie Moore-era and return to chart success (2004–2017)===
In 2004, UFO released their 17th studio album ''[[You Are Here (UFO album)|You Are Here]]'' with their new permanent guitarist [[Vinnie Moore]] and [[Jason Bonham]] on drums (intermittently). UFO recorded their live set and released a double-DVD recording titled ''Showtime'' (2005) along with a double live CD on SPV in November 2005, mixing a number of re-recorded studio songs. In November 2005, Andy Parker returned to the band to play in the ''Piorno Rock Festival'' in [[Granada]], Spain. UFO's eighteenth studio album, titled ''[[The Monkey Puzzle (UFO album)|The Monkey Puzzle]]'', was released in 2006.

Andy Parker returned in early 2007, after recovering from leg surgery. On the 2008 tour, Pete Way was unable to get a work visa to enter the United States, [[Rob De Luca]] ([[Sebastian Bach]]'s band, [[Of Earth]], [[Spread Eagle (band)|Spread Eagle]]) filling in.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103232150/http://sebastianbach.proboards31.com/index.cgi?board=band&action=display&thread=2265] {{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref>

UFO released their 19th studio album, ''[[The Visitor (UFO album)|The Visitor]]'', in June 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=114611|title=UFO To Release 'The Visitor' In The Spring|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618091050/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=114611|archive-date=18 June 2009}}</ref> and followed with a tour of the UK, but without Pete Way, who was suffering from a medical condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufo-music.info/news.htm|title=UFO|website=Ufo-music.info|access-date=28 June 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718153557/http://www.ufo-music.info/news.htm|archive-date=18 July 2014}}</ref> Bass tracks on ''The Visitor'' were played by Peter Pichl, and Pete Way was not credited as a band member on ''The Visitor'' cover, nor was any other bassist. However, the album saw UFO's return to the UK Albums Chart for the first time in almost 15 years.

In July 2009, UFO released a six-CD live concert [[box set]], containing recordings of six concerts between 1975 and 1982, as well as previously unreleased live songs.

On their 2011 tour, they were accompanied by [[Barry Sparks]] playing bass.

By December 2010, UFO had been working on a twentieth studio album, which was supposed to be released in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=150215 |title=Ufo Announces Initial Batch Of 2011 North American Tour Dates - Blabbermouth.net |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=1 December 2010 |access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref> Titled ''[[Seven Deadly]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=166015 |title=Ufo: New Album Title Announced |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=11 November 2011 |access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref> was released on 27 February 2012, with Lars Lehmann on bass, to almost universally good reviews and a higher chart position than The Visitor also charting in Germany, Sweden, and the Billboard indie charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=165738 |title=Ufo: New Album Release Date Announced  |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=7 November 2011 |access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref>

In 2011, former band members [[Danny Peyronel]], [[Laurence Archer]], and [[Clive Edwards]] teamed up with bassist Rocky Newton (ex-[[McAuley Schenker Group]]) to form a band entitled X-UFO.

===50th anniversary tour and retirement (2018–present)===
In May 2018, vocalist [[Phil Mogg]] announced that UFO's 50th anniversary tour in 2019 would be his last one as the frontman of the band, who may also either split up or move on with a replacement for him. Mogg explained, "This decision has been a long time coming. I've considered stepping down at the end of UFO's previous two tours. I don't want to call this a farewell tour as I hate that word, but next year's gigs will represent my final tap-dancing appearances with the band." He added that "the timing feels right" for him to quit, and that "there will be a final tour of the U.K. and we will also play some shows in selected other cities that the band has a strong connection with. But outside of the U.K. this won't be a long tour."<ref name="UFO retire"/> Despite earlier reports that Mogg had intended to leave the band in 2019, he is still a member of UFO as of June 2021, and the band will resume their touring activities in the summer and fall of 2022, which had been pushed back from a year earlier due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="2022 tour"/> UFO's last-ever show will take place on October 29, 2022 in [[Athens|Athens, Greece]], where the band performed first its show with current guitarist [[Vinnie Moore]] eighteen years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ufo-to-play-last-ever-concert-in-october-2022/|title=UFO To Play Last-Ever Concert In October 2022|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=September 4, 2021|date=September 3, 2021}}</ref>
