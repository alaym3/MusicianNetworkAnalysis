'''Unto Uuno Mononen'''  (23 October 1930 in [[Pravdino, Krasnoselskoye Settlement Municipal Formation, Vyborgsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Muolaa]] – 28 June 1968 in [[Somero]]) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] songwriter and musician. He is best known for his numerous [[tango music|tango]] compositions including the famous Finnish tango song, ''"[[Satumaa]]".'' His first name was originally Uuno.

== Biography ==
Mononen is often said to come from [[Somero]], but was actually from [[Muolaa]] and did not come to Somero until the [[Second World War]] was over and Muolaa was conquered by the [[Soviet Union]]. Mononen studied [[church music]] in the [[University of Turku]]. He quit these studies since he felt he did not learn anything important. As a composer he was self-taught. Mononen began his musical career by singing with local dance groups while he was under 20. After a failed operation to his [[adenoids]] damaged his voice, Mononen started to compose.

In 1950, Mononen first successfully sold his songs to a record company. The first song recorded was ''"Pieni laulu"'' ("A small song"), a [[waltz]] sung by [[Pentti Halme]]. In 1955 [[Henry Theel]] recorded the famous ''"Satumaa"'' to some success, but the song's status wasn't cemented until seven years later, in 1962, when [[Reijo Taipale]] recorded it.

Other famous tangos by Mononen include ''"Tähdet meren yllä"'' ("Stars above the Sea"), ''"Lapin Tango<nowiki>''</nowiki>'' ("The Tango of [[Lapland (region)|Lappland]]"), ''"Erottamattomat"'' ("Inseparables"), ''"Kangastus"'' ("The Mirage"), ''"Kaipuuni Tango"'' ("The Tango of my Longing"), ''"Kohtalon Tango"'' ("The Tango of Destiny") and ''"Yön Hiljaisuudessa"'' ("In the Silence of Night"). The last two of these became better known when another famous musician from Somero, singer [[Rauli Somerjoki|Rauli "Badding" Somerjoki]], recorded them. Singer [[Esko Rahkonen]] also worked with the composer in the 1960s.

One of the most well known figures in Finnish popular culture, provocative entertainer [[M. A. Numminen]] had played drums in Mononen's band. Later Numminen asked Mononen to compose a humorous tango to his lyrics. Mononen answered that for Numminen, he would write a tango even to the words of a phone book. From this collaboration, the song ''"Naiseni kanssa eduskuntatalon puistossa"'' ("With my Woman at the Park of the Parliament House") was born.

During his later years, Mononen suffered from [[alcoholism]] and eventually shot himself with a [[pistol]] on 28 June 1968. He was 37 years old.
