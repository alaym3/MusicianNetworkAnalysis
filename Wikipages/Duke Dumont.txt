Dumont was inspired by the original recording of the song by [[Whitney Houston]], saying: "It's one of my favourite Whitney songs, especially the later Whitney period. It got to a point [during the recording process] where I thought maybe it might be worth bringing a singer in and changing it but I thought you know what, out of respect as [the track] started off working the song around "[[My Love Is Your Love (song)|My Love Is Your Love]]" I kept it in."<ref name="mtv-whitney">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/duke-dumont/news/duke-dumont-kept-original-whitney-houston-sample-in-i-got-u-out-of-respect|title=Duke Dumont Kept Original Whitney Sample 'Out of Respect'|publisher=MTV News UK|date=19 March 2014|access-date=28 September 2020}}</ref>

In February 2015, "[[I Got U]]" was nominated for "[[Best Dance Recording]]" at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees |title=57th Annual GRAMMY Awards Winners and Nominees |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/63bRXv6ZA?url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees |archive-date=1 December 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

At the end of July 2015, he released "[[Ocean Drive (Duke Dumont song)|Ocean Drive]]", from the EP, ''Blasé Boys Club Pt. 1''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://earmilk.com/2015/07/31/duke-dumont-embraces-the-80s-on-ocean-drive/|title=Duke Dumont embraces the 80s on "Ocean Drive" - EARMILK|date=2015-07-31|work=EARMILK|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-US}}</ref>

===2020: Debut album===
Dumont's debut album, ''Duality'', was released on 17 April 2020. In an interview with Billboard, Dumont said he waited so long into his career to release his first album because "it gave me an opportunity to make an album and a body of music that has an emotional impact."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/9360509/duke-dumont-duality-interview|title=Duke Dumont Interview on New Album 'Duality'|date=2020-04-17|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> He continued, "There's a reason there's strings on a lot of the tracks. That's to give it a sense of longevity. There's a reason why the songs have chords and not just beats and synth lines. You've got to aspire to that long game."<ref name=":0" />
