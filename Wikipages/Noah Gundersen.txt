'''Noah Gundersen''' (born May 31, 1989) is an American [[indie folk]] singer-songwriter from [[Seattle]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Olympia, Washington]], Gundersen is the oldest of five biological and three adopted siblings, in a family that moved to [[Centralia, Washington]] to homestead when he was five. Gundersen was home schooled in a conservative Christian household.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nodepression.com/the-seeker-noah-gundersen-is-coming-to-terms-with-the-gray/|title=The Seeker: Noah Gundersen Is Coming to Terms with the Gray|date=2015-08-20|newspaper=No Depression|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> He took piano lessons at age 13 and later learned to play the guitar.<ref name=Spokesman>{{cite news|last1=Weinbender|first1=Nathan|title=Folk Approach: Singer-Songwriter Noah Gundersen Draws on Gospel, Embraces 'Rough Edges'|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-35595769|accessdate=October 17, 2014|publisher=The Spokesman-Review via High Beam (|url-access=subscription|date=January 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2010-09-08/music/an-incomplete-history-of-how-noah-gundersen-became-the-courage/|title=An Incomplete History of How Noah Gundersen Became The Courage|publisher=Seattle Weekly|work=Paige Richmond|date=September 7, 2010|access-date=April 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922120249/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2010-09-08/music/an-incomplete-history-of-how-noah-gundersen-became-the-courage/|archive-date=September 22, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the age of 18, Gundersen left home to pursue a career in music and began to play at venues around Seattle.<ref name=":0" />

As a teenager, Gundersen formed his first band, Beneath Oceans, with a few friends from his high school. The band included Gundersen, Michael Porter on lead guitar, and Keelan O’Hara on drums.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theclause.org/collide/2016/04/high-school-band-reunion-beneath-oceans-becomes-young-in-the-city/|title=High School Band Reunion: Beneath Oceans becomes Young in the City – COLLIDE|website=www.theclause.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref>

==Career==
In 2008, Gundersen produced his first EP, ''[[Brand New World (album)|Brand New World]]''.<ref name=Spokesman/> Early in his career, he began to perform in Seattle. Among others, Gundersen is said to be influenced by [[Ryan Adams]], [[Dashboard Confessional]], and [[Neil Young]].

In 2008, Gundersen collaborated with friends and his then-16-year-old sister to form the band [[The Courage]]. The group served as his backing band as he performed songs from ''Brand New World'' at clubs and cafes around Washington state. The group later recorded a live album, ''[[Live at The Triple Door (The Courage album)|Live at the Triple Door]]'', under the name Noah Gundersen & The Courage in 2008. The band performed at the [[Sisters Folk Festival]] in both 2008 and 2010 and evolved further, recording their debut album, ''[[Fearful Bones]]'', under the name The Courage in 2010.<ref name="tsweekly.com">{{cite web |last=Bookey |first=Mike |url=http://www.tsweekly.com/sound/music-features/the-passionate-life-getting-philosophical-and-sun-tanned-with-noah-gundersen-and-the-courage.html |title=The Passionate Life: Getting philosophical (and sun tanned) with Noah Gundersen and The Courage |work=The Source Weekly |date=February 24, 2010 |accessdate=December 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303201927/http://www.tsweekly.com/sound/music-features/the-passionate-life-getting-philosophical-and-sun-tanned-with-noah-gundersen-and-the-courage.html |archive-date=March 3, 2012 }}</ref>

While also performing and recording with The Courage, Gundersen remained focused on his solo career. His second EP, ''[[Saints & Liars]]'', was released in 2009. A rough recording of the EP originally circulated, landing on the desk of producer Daniel Mendez, who mixed the EP for a full release. Mendez then worked with Gundersen to release a follow-up EP, ''[[Family (Noah Gundersen album)|Family]]'' in 2011.

Launching his career further into the mainstream, Gundersen's title song "Family" was hand-selected by producer [[Kurt Sutter]] for the hit [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] TV show, ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2011/music/news/anarchy-keeps-humming-with-eclectic-cues-1118045895/|title=‘Anarchy’ keeps humming with eclectic cues|last=Morris|first=Christopher|date=2011-11-16|newspaper=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> Sutter again looked to Gundersen and [[The Forest Rangers (band)|The Forest Rangers]] to create an original song for the show in 2014, and the song "Day Is Gone" was later nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for Original Music and Lyrics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/07/10/emmys-sons-anarchy-kurt-sutter|title=Kurt Sutter: 'Sons of Anarchy' would lose fans if it got Emmy noms|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> The song "Family" also appeared on ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' on the [[The CW|CW]].<ref name="Spokesman" /> The track "David" was also later used in a 2015 episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV series ''[[The Following]]''.<ref name="AL.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/sloss_fest_2015_lineup_things_6.html|title=Sloss Fest 2015 lineup: Things to know about Noah Gundersen before his set at Birmingham festival|last=Colurso|first=Mary|date=June 28, 2015|work=AL.com|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, Gundersen self-produced his debut album, ''[[Ledges (album)|Ledges]]'',<ref name="Spokesman" /> at Seattle’s Studio Litho, owned by [[Pearl Jam]] guitarist [[Stone Gossard]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/noah-gundersen-is-one-old-soul-20140414|title=Noah Gundersen Is One Old Soul|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> The album addressed themes like faith, death, and past relationships.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spin.com/2014/02/noah-gundersen-ledges-stream-poor-man-son-video/|title=Stream Noah Gundersen’s Powerful Debut Album ‘Ledges’ {{!}} SPIN|date=2014-02-05|newspaper=Spin|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> The debut album propelled Gundersen's career further into indie folk stardom, with his song "Poor Man's Son" - which was originally recorded for the ''Live at the Triple Door'' album with The Courage - receiving a feature on ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]''. While touring his debut album, Gundersen also exclusively sold a five-song EP titled "Twenty-Something" to concertgoers. Tracks from the EP were later available online through the deluxe edition release of ''Ledges''.

Following up his breakthrough album ''Ledges'', Gundersen returned to the studio to record his second LP, ''[[Carry the Ghost]]'', which was released in 2015. The album deals with the challenges of success, failed relationships, religion, and sexuality. Gundersen has said he took inspiration from [[Neil Young]]'s album ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/08/17/noah-gundersen-carry-the-ghost-album/|title=Noah Gundersen Wrestles With Uncertainty on ‘Carry the Ghost’ (Exclusive Album Premiere)|last=Ayers|first=Mike|newspaper=WSJ|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> Later in 2015, Gundersen helped to produce the David Ramirez album ''Fables'', which released on August 28.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://davidramirezmusic.com/full-biography|title=David Ramirez Bio|last=Ramirez|first=David|access-date=2016-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207213924/http://www.davidramirezmusic.com/full-biography|archive-date=2016-12-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Returning to his hometown during a lull in his tour schedule, Gundersen reunited with friends from his high school band, Beneath Oceans. Originally reuniting as a joke, the group began to play old songs from their early days. Gundersen said of the reunion, "we reconnected to see if the old songs were still any good. They weren’t, so we started writing new ones.”<ref name=":1" /> On December 1, 2015 the group released their first album, an EP titled ''Young in the City''. The release was then followed up with live performances in the Seattle area and a second EP titled ''II'' on October 7, 2016.

In July 2017, Gundersen announced the completion of a new solo LP, ''White Noise'', which was released on September 22, 2017. It was a departure from the style of his previous albums, with a much heavier, more rock-inspired sound. The final track of the LP, Send the rain (to everyone), featured in [[The Good Doctor (TV series)|The Good Doctor]] season three [[List of The Good Doctor episodes|finale]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Music from The Good Doctor S3E20|url=https://www.tunefind.com/show/the-good-doctor/season-3/96899|access-date=2021-04-25|website=Tunefind}}</ref> and in [[Station 19]] first season third episode.<ref>{{Citation|title=S1E3 - Station 19 (Contain The Flame) List of Songs {{!}} WhatSong|url=https://www.what-song.com/Tvshow/100320/Station-19/e/111219|language=en|access-date=2021-04-25}}</ref>

On June 21, 2019, Gundersen announced the forthcoming release of another solo LP, ''Lover,'' which was released on August 23, 2019. On the same day, he released a single from the album titled "Robin Williams."

On July 7, 2021, Gundersen announced via Instagram that he had been engaged, bought a house, and that his new record would be out "later in the year," also revealing that a new Young in the City EP "is done and will be out soon."

On August 30, Gundersen posted a blue and white graphic to Instagram, teasing what appeared to be lyrics paired with the number "11," which fans quickly figured out was a countdown. On September 10, Gundersen released a new song, titled "Sleepless in Seattle," which had previously been played during his "Songs and Conversations" livestream series that aired during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gundersen further revealed that the song would appear as the eighth track on his upcoming solo LP "A Pillar of Salt," which was set for release on October 8 via his label, Cooking Vinyl.
