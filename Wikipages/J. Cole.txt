"I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless." "My favorite rapper was [[Tupac Shakur|Pac]]," he said. "He was my favorite rapper before I even started rapping. Before I even thought of–It went from [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bobby Brown]] as a kid and artists like that. Even [[Kool Moe Dee]]. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from–I don't know if he was back from [[Desert Storm]]...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With '[[Brenda's Got a Baby]]'. It was ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]''. And since then–When I was too young to know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight–Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15889/title.j-cole-talks-storytelling-working-with-jay-z-kendrick-lamar |title=J.

Upon the release of ''Eyez'' documentary in 2016, the songs "Everybody Dies" and "False Prophets" caused controversy within the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] community, as many assumed that "Everybody Dies" contained shots aimed at fellow rappers [[Lil Uzi Vert]] and [[Lil Yachty]].

===The Dreamville Foundation===
In October 2011, Cole established The Dreamville Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The Foundation says that it was "created to 'bridge the gap' between the worlds of opportunity and the urban youth" of Cole's hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina. With volunteers, the Foundation conducts philanthropic activities, such as an annual "Back To School Supply Giveaway" to provide supplies to schoolchildren.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.fayobserver.com/article/20150829/news/308299941|id = {{ebscohost|2W62412357094}}|title = J.

In 2014, Cole purchased his childhood home in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for $120,000 through the Dreamville Foundation. The home had been repossessed from his mother years earlier, while Jermaine was attending college in New York.

On July 31, 2020, PUMA and J. Cole released their debut collaboration shoe, the PUMA RS-Dreamer. Cole commented on the signature shoe saying: "Over the years, basketball shoes have progressed greatly in their level of technology and comfort but have strayed too far away from designs stylish enough for cultural relevancy. The Dreamer hopes to change that reality. The highest level of on-court performance meets the highest level of aesthetic design for daily wear. Once again, you can hoop in the same shoes you wore outside."<ref>{{cite web |title=RS-Dreamer – PUMA Releases Debut Collaboration with J.
