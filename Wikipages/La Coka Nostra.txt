'''La Coka Nostra''' (short '''LCN''') is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group composed of [[DJ Lethal]], [[Danny Boy (rapper)|Danny Boy]], [[Everlast]], [[Ill Bill]] and [[Slaine (rapper)|Slaine]].

== Biography ==
Founded in late 2004 with no intention to record an album, La Coka Nostra was more a loose collective of artists connected through [[Danny Boy (rapper)|Danny Boy]] than a group. Having taken time off from rap after the break-up of [[House of Pain]], Danny Boy took to working in video production and fashion as well as mentoring other artists. He met [[Slaine (rapper)|Slaine]] in Boston and, impressed with his writing, brought him to L.A. to record some tracks. Eventually it turned into more of a group effort including the former members of House of Pain and [[Ill Bill]], as well as associates from [[Psycho Realm]], [[Special Teamz]] and others.<ref name="HipHopDX Interview with Danny Boy">[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/features/id.1385/title.underground-report-la-coka-nostra-soulstice HHDX Interview], HipHopDX Interview with Danny Boy</ref>  It was not until early 2006 that an actual line up solidified. Plans to release an album were first voiced later the same year.<ref name="Urb Magazine Interview with Everlast">[http://www.urb.com/features/1555/LACOKANOSTRAInterview.php Urb Magazine Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716033421/http://www.urb.com/features/1555/LACOKANOSTRAInterview.php |date=July 16, 2009 }}, Urb Magazine Interview with Everlast.</ref>

In late 2008, the group signed to [[Suburban Noize Records]] and released the long delayed debut album ''[[A Brand You Can Trust]]'' on July 14, 2009.  The album took so long to complete due to Danny Boy's refusal to have the members collaborate via e-mail; instead, he would gather everyone at the studio.<ref name="HipHopDX Interview with Danny Boy" /> This took time due to the recording of Ill Bill and Everlast's solo albums as well as various tours and other commitments. ''A Brand You Can Trust'' features fifteen tracks and guest appearances from [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Bun B]], [[Psycho Realm|Sick Jacken]], [[B-Real]], [[Sen Dog]], [[Immortal Technique]], Big Left and [[Q-Unique]]. Though similar stylistically to the group's prior online releases, it features songs grounded more in reality. Subjects touched upon include politics, death, drug addiction, raising a child and terrorism.<ref name="Urb Magazine Interview with Everlast"/>

On March 2, 2012, it was announced that Everlast would be leaving La Coka Nostra due to his daughter's medical issues.{{cn|date=November 2017}}
