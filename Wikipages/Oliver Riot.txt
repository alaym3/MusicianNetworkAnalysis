'''Oliver Riot''' is a [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[Soul music|Soul]] duo composed of Benjamin and Alexander Moore, [[Twin|identical twins]] from [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], [[United States|USA]].

== Early life ==
Ben and Alex Moore lived in [[Peru]] until the age of 5, when their family moved to New Mexico. When they were 14, they started playing Gypsy Jazz together in the style of [[Django Reinhardt]] at restaurants, coffee shops, bars, breweries, and street corners in Albuquerque. They purchased their first car, a green [[Ford Explorer]], with the money they received from gigs and began writing their own music at the age of 16. Two years later, the brothers drove to [[Los Angeles]] in that Ford Explorer to play music.

== Career ==
Shortly following their move to LA, Oliver Riot took home first place in the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]'s annual "Rock The Mic Competition",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musiccreatesus.com/2017/01/20/feature-friday-oliver-riot/|title=Feature Friday: Oliver Riot|last=Us|first=Music Creates|date=2017-01-20|website=Music Creates Us|access-date=2017-03-07}}</ref> showcasing emerging [[California]] artists, and were awarded studio time with legendary producer, [[Mike Clink]] ([[Guns N' Roses]], [[Metallica]], [[Eddie Money]], etc.).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.magneticmag.com/2017/01/interview-familial-and-musical-ties-make-oliver-riot-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/|title=Interview: Familial and Musical Ties Make Oliver Riot a Force to Be Reckoned With|work=Magnetic Magazine|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en-us}}</ref>
