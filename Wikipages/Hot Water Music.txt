'''Hot Water Music''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Gainesville, Florida]], in 1993. The group consists of founding members [[Chuck Ragan]] and [[Chris Wollard]] on shared lead vocals and guitar, bassist Jason Black, and drummer George Rebelo, along with later addition [[Chris Cresswell]].

==Early history==
[[File:Hot Water Music - Rock am Ring 2019-4836.jpg|thumb|Hot Water Music live at [[Rock am Ring]] 2019]]
[[Image:Hot Water Music at Stone Pony Summer Stage Asbury Park NJ LHCollins 06222013.jpg|thumb|200px|Ragan and Black on [[The Stone Pony]]'s Summer Stage in [[Asbury Park, NJ]], June 22, 2013.|alt=]]
Ragan, Black, and Rebelo initially met while living in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]].<ref name="auto">[https://www.westword.com/music/chuck-ragan-of-hot-water-music-on-finally-being-able-to-record-at-the-blasting-room-5675661 "Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music on finally being able to record at the Blasting Room"] Westwood, February 1, 2013.</ref> Black and Rebelo had played together in jazz bands in school. Ragan and Rebelo met while working at eateries on the same street, with the corner becoming a frequent gathering place for Sarasota musicians. As Wollard was based in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]] at the time, he met the other three at a storage facility which was frequently used as a rehearsal space for both Sarasota and Bradenton bands. Frustrated by the lack of musical opportunities in their respective hometowns, Black, who had been attending [[Florida State University]] for a year, recommended that the other three join him in Gainesville, a city known for its historic and contemporary music scene. Upon moving to Gainesville and variously filling in as performers in each others' bands Fossil and Thread, the four joined together as Hot Water Music. The band's name was taken from the [[Hot Water Music (book)|collection of short stories]] by [[Charles Bukowski]] of the same name.

After rapidly releasing a series of singles splits, and EPs, the band released their first two LPs in 1997, ''[[Fuel for the Hate Game]]'' and ''[[Forever and Counting]]'', the latter of which was released under the temporary moniker The Hot Water Music Band due legal concerns on the part of the band's label [[Doghouse Records]] regarding an unrelated record titled ''Hot Water Music'' by [[Elektra Records]] band Hot Water that same year.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grubbs |first1=Eric |title=Post |date=2008 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=978-0595518357 |page=208}}</ref> After two years of rigorous touring had exhausted the band's members and strained their relationships, they announced that they would be breaking up following a farewell show at the Hardback Cafe in Gainesville. Their intention to disband was evidently short-lived, as, during the show, Ragan announced to the audience, "I'm sure a lot of people here came a long way tonight because they heard this was our last show. I don't know what to tell you guys...we're trying to keep it going."<ref>[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kqab8/hot-water-music-forever-and-counting-1997-the-year-emo-broke "Hot Water Music Bookended 1997 with Two Seminal Albums"] Noisey (Music by [[Vice Media|Vice]]), October 27, 2017.</ref> The performance from this show was recorded and released as the live album ''Live at the Hardback''. 

After releasing ''[[No Division]]'' on [[No Idea Records]] in 1999, Hot Water Music signed to [[Epitaph Records]], releasing three more albums, 2001's ''[[A Flight and a Crash]]'', their commercial breakthrough ''[[Caution (Hot Water Music album)|Caution]]'' in 2002, and their final record ''[[The New What Next]]'', before disbanding in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.singoutloudfestival.com/event/hotwatermusic/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-06-17 |archive-date=2020-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200618100019/https://www.singoutloudfestival.com/event/hotwatermusic/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Hiatus==
In late 2005, Hot Water Music announced through the No Idea Records website that they would be going on a hiatus following Chuck Ragan's departure, citing "family" reasons.<ref>[https://www.punknews.org/article/12588/hot-water-music-on-extended-break-new-band-forms "Hot Water Music on "extended break" / new band forms"] Punknews.org, 2005.</ref> While this was initially intended as a temporary hiatus, the band announced in 2006 that the break would be permanent.<ref>[https://www.punknews.org/article/17480/breakups-hot-water-music-1994-2006 "Hot Water Music (1994-2006)"] Punknews.org, May 13, 2006.</ref> The three remaining members then started a new project, [[The Draft (band)|The Draft]], whose first album, ''[[In a Million Pieces]]'', was released on September 12, 2006. Chuck Ragan continued with a primarily-acoustic solo project, releasing his debut record ''[[Feast or Famine (Chuck Ragan album)|Feast or Famine]]'' in 2007.

==Reunion==

Less than two years after announcing their hiatus, the band announced that they would be reuniting for a handful of shows in 2008 to commemorate the release their B-sides compilation record ''[[Till the Wheels Fall Off (Hot Water Music album)|Till The Wheels Fall Off]]''.<ref>[http://epitaph.com/news/article/hot-water-music-reunite-for-mini-tour "Hot Water Music Reunite For Mini Tour"] Epitaph Records, November 7, 2007.</ref> The band continued to be semi-active, sporadically performing and touring over the next few years.

In 2011, the band announced that, after releasing a 7" single to support their European tour with [[Make Do and Mend]], they would be releasing a new LP of original material through [[Rise Records]].<ref>[https://noisecreep.com/hot-water-music-signs-with-rise-records/ "Hot Water Music Sign With Rise Records, Announce New Releases"] Noisecreep, July 1, 2011.</ref> Hot Water Music released the album, ''[[Exister]]'', in 2012.

After the release of their 2017 record ''Light It Up'', Wollard announced that he was taking a break from the band to focus on his health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chorus.fm/news/chris-wollard-taking-break-from-hot-water-music/|title=Chris Wollard Taking Break From Hot Water Music • chorus.fm|date=23 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123131605/https://chorus.fm/news/chris-wollard-taking-break-from-hot-water-music/|access-date=20 September 2020|archive-date=2018-01-23}}</ref> The band continued to play previously booked shows with [[The Flatliners]]' [[Chris Cresswell]] and [[Chris DeMakes]] of [[Less Than Jake]] filling in for Wollard at several dates. Cresswell also filled in for Wollard for the band's 25th anniversary tour in 2019. While Wollard is not currently performing live with the band, he is still involved in their studio endeavors, playing and singing on their 2019 ''Shake Up The Shadows'' EP, with Cresswell joining the recording on backing vocals.<ref>[http://epitaph.com/artists/hot-water-music/release/shake-up-the-shadows "About ''Shake Up The Shadows'' by Hot Water Music"] Epitaph Records, May 24, 2019.</ref> In 2021, the band signed with [[Equal Vision Records]] for their ninth LP ''Feel The Void'', the band's first album featuring Cresswell as a permanent member, with Cresswell performing lead vocals on the track "Turn the Dial."<ref>https://www.brooklynvegan.com/hot-water-music-reunite-with-brian-mcternan-for-new-lp-new-song-exclusive-vinyl/</ref>

==Other projects==
Prior to founding Hot Water Music, the band's members played in several other groups, including Yellow Section (Ragan), Burial (Rebelo), Kelly Green (Black and Rebelo), Thread (Black and Wollard), and Fossil (Ragan and Rebelo).<ref name="auto"/> Between 1996 and 1998 Wollard and Rebelo, along with Jack Bailey and Heather Ann Parker, formed The Blacktop Cadence and released their album ''Chemistry for Changing Times'' in 1997. From 1998 through 1999, Ragan and Wollard joined Samantha Jones for the acoustic side-project [[Rumbleseat]], which released four 7" singles and contributed several songs to compilations, later releasing an eponymous compilation in 2005 after their breakup.

Following Hot Water Music's 2005 hiatus announcement, Chuck Ragan began a solo career, releasing several records, as well as various collaborative efforts with other artists, including a collaborative live acoustic project called The Revival Tour, featuring several punk rock, bluegrass, and alt-country performers with Ragan's goal to "sharing music together" and "bringing it to people in an extremely honest and grassroots fashion."<ref name="therevivaltour.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.therevivaltour.com/?page_id=8 |title=About The Tour |website=Therevivaltour.com |access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref> During this hiatus, Black, Rebelo, and Wollard formed [[The Draft]], which released an LP and two EPs before disbanding, returning for a reunion tour in 2013. Wollard's first solo effort, ''Chris Wollard and the Ship Thieves'' was released in 2009. Jason Black joined [[Senses Fail]] in 2008, playing on their record ''[[The Fire (Senses Fail album)|The Fire]]'' before departing in 2012. Rebelo joined [[Against Me!]] in 2009, playing on their 2010 LP [[White Crosses (album)|White Crosses]], leaving the band that same year. Rebelo has been a member of [[The Bouncing Souls]] since 2013, playing on their 2016 record ''[[Simplicity (The Bouncing Souls album)|Simplicity]]''.
