'''Yangyang County''' (''Yangyang-gun'') is in [[Gangwon (South Korea)|Gangwon]] Province, [[South Korea]].  The county is located in the northeast of the country in [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon-do]]. Its population is about 31,000 (2004).

The Yangyang area is well known for its pine mushrooms (''song-i''), its fish&mdash;particularly salmon&mdash;and its sunrises.

==Overview==
In 2002, Yangyang opened its [[Yangyang International Airport|own airport]], serving [[Gangneung]] to the south and [[Sokcho]] to the north. It was intended for the many tourists attracted by the [[Seorak-san]] national park. But the airport was closed in 2009 due to a lack of passengers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sudworth |first=John |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8055957.stm |title=World &#124; Asia-Pacific &#124; South Korea's abandoned airports |publisher=BBC News |access-date=2009-05-19 | date=2009-05-18 | location=London}}</ref>

The county is proud to unite the five major religions of Korea: [[Confucianism]], [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Korean shamanism|Shamanism]], [[Protestantism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]]. There are sites for all these faiths in Yangyang. ''Seonghwangsa'' is a shamanistic altar which was traditionally used for sacrificial rites. ''Yangyang Hyanggyo'' is a Confucian school built in 1340. Today the school mainly serves as a shrine, but classes are still held there. In 1921, ''Yangyang Cathedral'' was built. During the [[Korean War]] it was burnt to the ground but rebuilt afterwards.

The county is also proud of its five-day market. It is the largest traditional market in the area and renowned for the quality of its produce. The market is held on days ending in 4 and 9.
