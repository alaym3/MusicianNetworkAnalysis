In October 2018, The Okee Dokee Brothers released ''Winterland'', an exuberant yet introspective collection of 16 original songs exploring the wonders and beauty of winter. A voyage from autumn to spring, ''Winterland'' presents secular winter music the entire family can enjoy while cozying up around the fire. This album also received a GRAMMY nomination in November of 2019. 

Most recently, in May 2020, they released, ''Songs for Singin'', a 2-disc 27-song album full of inclusive songs so fans can join in and belt out. In the spirit of American folk legends, Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, ''Songs for Singin'' presents timeless messages of hope and unity. The album includes an illustrated 32-page book with the lyrics and chords to every song to inspire living room sing-alongs. 

==History==
[[File:2019JustinLansing.jpg|thumb|left|Justin Lansing playing banjo in 2019]]
Bandmates and childhood best friends, Joe Mailander and Justin Lansing, grew up in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and toured the midwest with their bluegrass band before settling in Minneapolis and starting their family music band, The Okee Dokee Brothers.

In 2011, Joe and Justin began a canoe trip at the headwaters of the Mississippi River, and ended at the St. Louis Gateway Arch. During their month-long journey on the Mississippi, they camped, canoed, filmed and composed the songs that make up their album ''Can You Canoe?'' This CD-DVD is the first release in their Adventure Album Series. Produced by [[Dean Jones (musician)|Dean Jones]] in his Rosendale, NY, straw-bale studio, the record highlights guest appearances from [[Garth Hudson]] of [[The Band]], [[Elizabeth Mitchell (musician)|Elizabeth Mitchell]] of [[You Are My Flower]] as well as [[Morgan Taylor]] and [[Rachel Loshak]] of [[Gustafer Yellowgold]]. The album received praise from NPR,<ref>{{cite web|author=Author Interviews |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/07/154534866/music-review-can-you-canoe |title=Music Review: 'Can You Canoe' |publisher=NPR |date=2012-06-07 |accessdate=2016-01-16}}</ref> won a [[Parents' Choice Award]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=30847&StepNum=1&award=aw |title=Can You Canoe? |publisher=Parents-choice.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-16}}</ref> and USA Today called it their "...favorite album of 2012".<ref>{{cite web|author=Korina Lopez, USA TODAY 2:07 p.m. EST January 8, 2013 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/01/04/best-new-kids-music/1801325/ |title=If you just can't hear it again, try these kids' albums |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2016-01-16}}</ref>  ''Can You Canoe?'' also won the GRAMMY Award for Best Children's Album of the Year in early 2013.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In 2013, The Okee Dokee Brothers embarked on their second adventure, a month-long trek on the Appalachian Trail.  They hiked, camped, met mountain musicians, and wrote the songs that make up their second CD/DVD in their Adventure Album Series, entitled ''Through the Woods''.  Also produced by Dean Jones, this album emulates the instruments and styles heard in traditional old-time Appalachian music. The record features [[Hubby Jenkins]] of the [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]], 4-time GRAMMY winner [[David Holt (musician)|David Holt]], and 2-time GRAMMY winners [[Cathy Fink & Marcy Marxer|Cathy Fink and Marcy Marxer]]. ''Through the Woods'' was nominated for a GRAMMY Award for Best Children's Album of the Year in early 2015.

In June 2015, The Okee Dokee Brothers went out West for a month-long horsepacking trip along the Continental Divide. They rode horses, camped out, told stories, and wrote songs. Featuring a diverse collective of musicians -- [[John Sebastian]] ([[The Lovin' Spoonful]]), [[Carlos Medina]] ([[Norteño (music)|Norteño]] accordion), [[Cindy Cashdollar]] ([[Asleep At The Wheel]]), [[Jim Campilongo]] ([[The Little Willies]]), and The Benally Family (Navajo style singing/[[Blackfire (band)|Blackfire]]) -- ''Saddle Up'' covers tales of western wildlife, Navajo stories, Southwest-style Spanglish, the issue of guns in western lore, friendship, and more. In 2016, “Saddle Up” was nominated for a Grammy in the best children’s album category.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Prince, KING, Okee Dokee Brothers Are MN Grammy Nominees |url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/12/06/prince-king-okee-dokee-brothers-are-mn-grammy-nominees/ |website=[[WCCO-TV|WCCO]] |publisher=CBS Local Media |date=December 6, 2016|access-date=December 6, 2016}}</ref>

They celebrate the spirit of the winter season on their full-length studio album, Winterland (October 2018). It's an exuberant yet introspective collection of 16 original songs exploring the wonders and beauty of winter. A voyage from autumn to spring, Winterland presents secular winter music the entire family can enjoy while cozying up around the fire. The Okee Dokee Brothers released five winter music videos to accompany the music.

''Songs for Singin'': Stepping away from their outdoor adventure-themed albums (Can You Canoe?, Through the Woods, Saddle Up, and Winterland), The Okee Dokee Brothers engage their fans through meaningful social conversations in the form of call and response tunes, sea shanties, church hymns, campfire songs, all-ages social songs, and protest songs. ''Songs for Singin''' invites family members to strengthen their bonds by experiencing music together amidst the backdrop of an increasingly divided world. To capture the free-spirit and imperfections of sing-alongs, the recordings feature an array of tunes tracked live with choruses sung by kids and parents alike. 

The band tours nationally, performing at such venues as [[Austin City Limits]], [[Lincoln Center]], [[The Getty Museum]], National Geographic Live, Orchestra Hall with the [[Minnesota Orchestra]], [[Winnipeg Folk Festival]], and [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts]], among many other performing art centers and theaters.

On August 20, 2013, [[Minnesota Governor]] [[Mark Dayton]] proclaimed "Okee Dokee Brothers Day" in the State of [[Minnesota]].<ref>[http://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/pressreleasedetail.jsp?id=102-74500 "Grammy Award-Winning Okee Dokee Brothers Honored by Governor Dayton"].

==Video productions==
Each Okee Dokee Brother Adventure Album has an accompanying film that documents Joe and Justin's songwriting trip. These movies tell the story of The Okee Dokee Brothers' travels while including educational segments, camping shenanigans, music videos, interviews with locals, pristine nature scenes, and comprehensive tomfoolery. All the horseback riding, hiking, canoeing, camping, and songwriting footage is filmed on location in the setting of each adventure's theme (The Mississippi River, The Appalachian Trail, and the Great American West). The footage is filmed by Alex Johnson, and Jed Anderson (percussionist for the band) directs and edits the films (JedEditedIt Productions and InTents Studios). The films can be purchased on iTunes and Amazon, seen on the DVDs that come with their CDs, and can be found on YouTube.

The Okee Dokee Brothers released five winter music videos to accompany their album, Winterland, and continue to release music videos for songs on each of their following albums. 

==Picture books==
Joe and Justin are working with [[Sterling Publishing]] (Sterling Children's) to publish two picture books that come with CDs of their songs. 

In March of 2017, they released a new picture book, ''Thousand Star Hotel'', with Sterling  Publishing. Inspired by the folktale "The Fisherman and His Wife," The Okee Dokee Brothers have "created a fanciful story about the things we wish for... and the things we really need." The accompanying CD features 11 nighttime songs and a fully dramatized audiobook of the story, read by The Okee Dokee Brothers. 

Their first book, titled ''Can You Canoe? And Other Adventure Songs'', was illustrated by Brandon Reese. The book "invites you to journey cross-country with The Okee Dokee Brothers through twelve of their irresistible, boot-stompin' tunes. You'll encounter hungry black bears and tall-tale spinners; quiet canoes and cozy camping tents; a jumpin' jamboree and a bullfrog opera. As you listen to the songs and follow along with the illustrated lyrics in this collection, you might even be inspired to head out on some outdoor adventures of your own!"
