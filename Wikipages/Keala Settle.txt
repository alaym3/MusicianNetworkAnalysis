==Career==
===Broadway===
Settle made her Broadway debut in 2011 in ''[[Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (musical)|Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' as Shirley and in the ensemble.<ref name=champion/><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=488747 " 'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' Listing' "] ibdb, accessed May 11, 2013</ref>

Settle originated the role of Norma Valverde in ''[[Hands on a Hardbody (musical)|Hands on a Hardbody]]'', a musical which ran briefly on Broadway in 2013, and is based on the 1997 documentary about real people competing to win a new truck. The ''TheatreMania'' reviewer wrote: "Settle, as Norma, steals every scene she's in. The spectacularly bizarre lead-in to her big number, 'Joy of the Lord,' is more difficult to pull off than most Shakespearean monologues, and her solo vocals reveal a soulful, oversized gospel range that drives the Holy Spirit straight to the back of the theater. When she tearfully realizes what her faith in God may have wrought, it stings like a chigger bite. Settle's touching performance should go on the shortlist for every Best Featured Actress prize in town."<ref>Kaye, Kimberly.[http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/03-2013/hands-on-a-hardbody_64662.html "Review.
