'''Nephew''' is a Danish [[Orchestra|Orchestra]] formed in 1996 in [[Aarhus|Aarhus, Denmark]].  The band consists of [[Simon Kvamm]] (lead vocals, keyboards, songwriting), [[Kristian Riis]] (guitar, backing vocals), [[Søren Arnholt]] (drums, backing vocals), [[Kasper Toustrup]] (bass guitar), [[René Munk Thalund]] (keyboards), and [[Marie Højlund]] (vocals, keyboards, guitar).

The band uses a mixture of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[English language|English]] in their lyrics; most of the band's early songs were in English with minimal Danish lyrics, but the band has since moved to primarily Danish vocals. In 2009, when interviewed about the band's mixture of languages, frontman Simon Kvamm said: "It's important for me to use the Danish kind of English that I speak...my mother tongue Danish, and my second language English, are very present to me in thinking and talking and speaking with others, and writing. Also in songwriting. And things just take form in one of those languages, or a mixture in between them. I can't really find a system to what goes the English way and what goes the Danish."<ref>{{cite web

==History==
===Early Days and ''Swimming Time'' (1996-2004)===
The band was formed in 1996 by Simon Kvamm, Kristian Riis, Jonas Juul Jeppesen, and Søren Arnholt, all of whom were studying [[musicology]] at the [[university of Aarhus]]. In 1997 they participated in DM i Rock (Danish Championships in Rock), where they reached the semi-finals but did not win. In 1998 Nephew released two early demo albums, ''Tunes'' and ''Things to Do.'' After the release of these, they got some airtime on the Danish radio station [[DR P3|P3]].<ref>{{cite web

The band's first studio album, ''[[Swimming Time]]'', was released on 3 May 2000, on the small label [[Martian Records]]. The album was well received by both critics and fans, peaking at #15 on the charts for 1 week.<ref name="acharts">{{cite web|title=Nephew - Music Charts|url=http://acharts.co/artist/nephew#albums|access-date=12 May 2016|website=Acharts|publisher=acharts.co}}</ref> The band's [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]] calendar became even busier than it already was, and the band performed both on Camp Stage at [[Roskilde Festival]] and several venues in Germany. In spite of the band's success, the band members lost their enthusiasm and decided to disband in 2001, but during their farewell concert in Germany, they rediscovered their passion for music and decided to stay together.

===''USADSB'' and Breakthrough (2004-06)===
Nephew's second studio album, named ''[[USADSB]]'', was released 30 June 2004. The name comes from the abbreviation for the [[United States of America]], and the abbreviation for the [[DSB (railway company)|Danske Statsbaner]]. ''USADSB'' sold far more copies than Swimming Time, and was certified double platinum in Denmark and spawned six hit singles. It peaked at #1 and held that position for 7 weeks.<ref name="acharts" /> It was very well received and is seen as their "breakthrough" album in Denmark and elsewhere. While the success of the album was propelled by [[Simon Kvamm]]'s participation in the Danish satire show [[Drengene Fra Angora]],<ref>{{cite web

He had previously been in the [[Electronic music|electronic]] trio Shanks.dk with Nephew's producer, Carsten Heller, and Jesper Birk. With the addition of Thalund, Nephew proceeded to make the song "Byens Hotel" for ''Værsgo 2'', the 2005 Danish tribute album to [[Kim Larsen]]'s [[1973 in music|1973]] album ''[[Værsgo]]''. Sometime in 2005, a mix of Nephew's "Movie Klip" and [[Depeche Mode]]'s "[[Personal Jesus]]" appeared. It was later revealed that the mix was made by [[René Munk Thalund]].

===''Interkom Kom Ind'' (2006-09)===
On 6 October 2006, Nephew released their third studio album, ''[[Interkom Kom Ind]].'' It was received well by critics and fans alike, and was certified 3x platinum in Denmark.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hitlisten.NU|url=http://www.hitlisten.nu/|access-date=2021-04-12|website=Hitlisten.NU}}</ref> The singles, "Igen & Igen &", "Science Fiction & Familien", and "Mexico Ligger i Spanien" rotated heavily on Danish radio.

At the 2006 [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], the band met [[Timbaland]], who wanted them to work on his forthcoming [[Timbaland Presents Shock Value]] album. Due to other commitments, Nephew couldn't contribute to the album, but they did produce a remix of the song "[[The Way I Are]]". Nephew frontman Simon Kvamm delivered new vocals for the song, which were included on the single release. The remix sampled the melody from "Igen & Igen &", as well as translated-to-English lyrics from the song which were then incorporated throughout the remix. It was released in most of Europe as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to the original single, but in [[Scandinavia]], was played often as the main single.

On 5 November 2007, Nephew released a live performance box-set (Live-CD/2DVD) entitled ''[[Roskilde 07.07.07]]'' based upon a much-acclaimed live performance at Orange Scene at the 2007 [[Roskilde Festival]]. The Live CD features songs from the albums ''USADSB'' and ''Interkom Kom Ind'', including a special version of "Hospital" which features a guest performance by Danish rapper [[Liam O'Connor (Danish rapper)|L.O.C.]] The Special Edition of the box also includes the band's remix of the [[Timbaland]] track "The Way I Are". The album peaked at #2 for 1 week.<ref name="acharts" />

In September 2008, a Nephew remix of the song "Allein Allein" by [[Germany|German]] band [[Polarkreis 18]], entitled "Allein Alene", began to play on the Danish radio. It was mixed by the keyboardist of the band, [[René Munk Thalund]], and [[Carsten Heller]], who both mixes and produces for Nephew. It topped the charts for 8 weeks.<ref name="acharts" />

===''Danmark/Denmark'' (2009-12)===

When asked what this single was meant to convey, Kristian Riis said: "The album's title track is a tribute to the [[North Sea]].
