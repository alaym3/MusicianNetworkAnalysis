'''Nicolet Aleta Logan''' ({{née}} Heaton; born December 4, 1994), better known by her stage name '''Niykee Heaton''', is an American singer, songwriter and model. She was discovered through her [[YouTube channel]] after uploading acoustic guitar covers of contemporary hits, most notably [[hip hop]] songs, that went viral. In 2014, Heaton released her debut single "Bad Intentions" and [[Bad Intentions (EP)|an extended play of the same name]]. The single charted on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and became gold-certified by the RIAA.

Heaton embarked on her first headlining concert tour, The Bedroom Tour, in late 2015, and released the similarly titled [[mixtape]], ''The Bedroom Tour Playlist'', on March 18, 2016. The mixtape compiled [[remastered]] material she had previously shared online for free [[Streaming media|streaming]] and debuted for her live shows during the tour. Her follow-up EP, ''Starting Over'', was released in 2018 through Capitol Records.

==Early and personal life==
Nicolet Aleta Logan was born on December 4, 1994,<ref name="RapUp">{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2016/06/13/niykee-heaton-day-in-the-life-photos|title=Exclusive: A Day in the Life of Niykee Heaton|work=[[Rap-Up]]|date=June 13, 2016|access-date=July 3, 2016}}</ref> in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and grew up in [[Geneva, Illinois]], but she has noted she has a stronger connection to the time she spent in her mother's native [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/2016/04/niykee-heaton-interview/|title=Interview: Niykee Heaton Takes Us On Her Journey From The 'Net To A National Tour|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=April 27, 2016|access-date=July 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9cxKuy4Q1o|title=Niykee Heaton's Sexy Image, In Tears Over Sister's Passing + Performs on Ladies First|publisher=Youtube.com HOT 97 (11:40)|date=April 20, 2016|access-date=July 3, 2016}}</ref>

After writing her first song at age five and teaching herself to play guitar at nine, Heaton dedicated her childhood years to making music. Despite realizing early on that she wanted to be a musician, she never saw herself as a performer and just wanted to make music, developing a [[stage fright]]. She gave herself vocal training by singing along to a [[Diana Ross]] greatest-hits CD, since her family couldn't financially support her musical education. Heaton has an older brother and also had a sister Rachel, who beat liver cancer but died in 2007 at age 21 while waiting for a second liver transplant, whom she regularly notes taking inspiration from. Heaton also struggled with [[bullying]] throughout her school years. She married actor, model, personal trainer and entrepreneur Jeff Logan on July 14, 2019, and gave birth to their first son on May 1, 2020.<ref name="niykeebio">{{cite web|url=http://www.niykeeheatonmusic.com/biography/|title=Niykee Heaton Biography|publisher=Niykeeheatonmusic.com|archive-date=July 4, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Zm7JiMgx?url=http://www.niykeeheatonmusic.com/biography/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="redeye">{{cite web|url=http://www.redeyechicago.com/entertainment/music/redeye-niykee-heaton-interview-redeye-20141117-column.html|title=Niykee Heaton's 'Bad Intentions' come from a good place |date=November 17, 2014|publisher=Redeyechicago.com|access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name="hometown">{{cite web|url=http://www.mysuburbanlife.com/2014/09/25/pop-star-niykee-heaton-stops-in-hometown-geneva/a4ptzu9/|title=Pop star Niykee Heaton stops in hometown Geneva|date=September 24, 2014|publisher=Mysuburbanlife.com|access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name="billboardint"/>

In 2011, while still enrolled in high school, Heaton began uploading clips recorded in her bedroom on YouTube, including covers of contemporary hit songs along with occasional originals, for which she accompanied herself on acoustic guitar. In December 2012, her cover of [[Chief Keef]]'s "[[Love Sosa]]" particularly was featured on the website ''[[WorldStarHipHop]]'', promptly helping to propel Heaton to prominence, and subsequently taking meetings with several [[record label]]s.<ref name="complex1">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/12/meet-niykee-heaton-the-white-girl-who-covered-love-sosa|title=Meet Niykee Heaton, the White Girl Who Covered "Love Sosa"|date=December 10, 2012|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/niykee-heaton-mn0003266922/biography|title=Niykee Heaton - Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref> Heaton graduated high school six months early and self-financed the recording of a host of her own songs, opting to take a step back and build "a catalog that we were proud of" with her manager Lauren, eventually signing with All Def Digital in 2014, a YouTube-based label founded by [[Steve Rifkind]] and [[Def Jam]]-founder [[Russell Simmons]], in partnership with [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="niykeebio"/><ref name="allmusic1"/><ref name="vh1">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/29601/niykee-heaton-kanye-west-instagram-music/|title=Niykee Heaton Recalls the Random Time Kanye West Sang for Her, Talks Instagram + Music to Come|date=June 22, 2015|publisher=[[VH1]]|access-date=July 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name="nypsigning">{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/07/20/universal-music-looking-to-cater-to-the-youtube-crowd/|title=Universal Music looking to cater to the YouTube crowd|date=July 20, 2014|work=[[New York Post]]|access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref> She topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Next Big Sound]] chart on April 24, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nextbigsound.com/charts/2311/2311|title=Next Big Sound - Analytics and Insights for the Music Industry|date=April 24, 2014|publisher=[[Next Big Sound]]|archive-date=July 7, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZqZYURc9?url=https://www.nextbigsound.com/charts/2311/2311|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Artistry==
While talking about her songwriting, Heaton said, "My music is a direct reflection of who I am. My writing is everything to me because that's all I had growing up. I had a really tough childhood and at a point when I was very young, I sort just stopped speaking because I stuttered," mentioning her inability to have friends, causing her to always be alone due to her mother staying with her sister in the hospital, her father being drunk and the rest of her family living in South Africa, so she "would just write all the time."<ref name="huffpost">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/01/niykee-heaton-bad-intentions_n_5913212.html|title=Niykee Heaton's 'Bad Intentions' Reveal The Struggles Behind Her Best Intentions |date=October 1, 2014|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref> "Even when I'm not writing literally about things that have happened to me, all the pain of my childhood and losing my sister ends up getting pushed into my music," she adds about her creative inspiration and wanting to be proud of the message in her music, "It shapes my songs and builds this deeper meaning under everything, which is one of the most important things to me."<ref name="niykeebio"/> She has mentioned being heavily influenced by [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Tom Waits]] and is also a fan of hip hop, pointing out rappers like [[Kanye West]], [[2 Chainz]], [[Jay Z]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] and [[Nicki Minaj]] as other inspirations.<ref name="huffpost"/><ref name="elitedaily">{{cite web|url=http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/niykee-heaton-bad-intentions/804816/|title=Bad Intentions: Meet 19-Year-Old YouTube Sensation Niykee Heaton|date=October 23, 2014|publisher=Elitedaily.com|access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref>

Heaton addressed claims regarding her social media presence in platforms such as [[Instagram]] overshadowing her music saying, "If I can use what I have aesthetically to draw people in, then why not use it? I'm not going to put on a turtleneck just to prove a point, or to make people feel more comfortable according to society's standards."<ref name="complex3">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2015/04/niykee-heaton-crush-on-you-april-may-2015|title=Niykee Heaton Has Everyone on Their Thirst Behavior|date=April 1, 2015|work=Complex|access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/who-niykee-heaton-singer-ignites-instagram-bikini-pictures-photos-1567270|title= Who Is Niykee Heaton?
