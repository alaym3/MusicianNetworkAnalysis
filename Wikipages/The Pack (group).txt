==Music career==

===''Skateboards 2 Scrapers'' EP and ''Based Boys'' (2006–2008)===
Soon after, The Pack created 2006's sneaker anthem, "Vans" and released it via their MySpace page. The song was heard by veteran Oakland rapper [[Too Short]] who then signed them to his Up All Nite Records imprint via [[Jive Records]]. The Pack's hit song "Vans" was number 23 on the top 30 hip hop charts, played on 65 hip hop stations nationwide on 35 pop stations nationwide. It was also listed at No.5 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s "Best songs of 2006".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061214062224/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12769472/the_100_best_songs_of_2006 Best songs of 2006], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', retrieved on 2008-10-12</ref> The song featured a chorus of "Got my Vans on, but they look like sneakers; (You) wearing coke whites but my Vans look cleaner." The music video for "Vans" aired on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], but [[MTV]], and [[MTV Jams]], refused to show the video because it promoted a consumer product. However, MTV aired an edited version of the video, in which the word "Vans" was censored throughout the song.<ref name="Music Filter">{{cite web|title=The Pack's "Vans" Banned From MTV.|url=http://musicfilter.com/Blog/cns!1E13828BC4057369!9028.entry|publisher=Music Filter|year=2007|access-date=2008-08-24}}</ref> The Pack released a seven track EP in 2006 entitled ''[[Skateboards 2 Scrapers]]'', which included hits such as "Vans" and "I'm Shinin".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Skateboards-2-Scrapers-Pack/dp/B000KB48O8/|title=Amazon.com: Pack: Skateboards 2 Scrapers: Music|work=amazon.com|year=2006}}</ref> In 2007, The Pack put out their debut album ''[[Based Boys]]'', which included the single "In My Car".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Based-Boys-Pack/dp/B000VR013I/|title=Amazon.com: Pack: Based Boys: Music|work=amazon.com|year=2007}}</ref> In early 2008, it was announced that The Pack was dropped from [[Jive Records]]/[[Zomba Label Group]] due to their album's lackluster sales. The Pack recently signed with Los Angeles-based Indie Pop which is home to other artists such as [[The Cataracs]], [[Dev (singer)|Dev]], and Bobby Brackins. In November 2010, Lil B and Young L were featured on the cover of the publication The FADER, in its 71st issue.<ref>{{cite news
