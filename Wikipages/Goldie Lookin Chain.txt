'''Goldie Lookin Chain''' are a Welsh [[comedy hip hop]] group from [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Wales]]. The group produces humorous, controversial and often explicit songs that satirise hip hop, today's consumer society, the "[[chav]]" culture and life in Newport and [[South Wales]] in general.

==History==
The group recorded six albums prior to securing a major record deal. They signed to [[East West Records]], the home of rock band [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]]. The band came to the attention of label executive [[Korda Marshall]], who heard the group's music played by members of The Darkness whilst on tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/goldie-lookin-chain-the-chain-gang-530844.html|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Goldie Lookin Chain: The chain gang|first=Simon|last=Price|date=3 April 2005|access-date=16 October 2021}}</ref> GLC went on to support The Darkness in the latter stages of their UK tour. The group form part of an era known as [[Cool Cymru]] for the popularity of Welsh music and arts internationally in that period.

GLC's first UK chart entry was "[[Half Man Half Machine]]", which reached the Top 40 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> When group member Rhys Hutchings was phoned by [[BBC]] chart presenter [[Wes Butters|Wes]] on the Official Chart Show to be informed of this, Xain informed the rest of the band that they had reached number 1, much to the shock of the DJ.<ref name=copter/> "[[Half Man Half Machine]]" was a surreal song about Eggsy believing he was a robot, dressing up in [[aluminium foil|foil]], and going to the shops to buy [[cigarette]]s and [[potato chip|crisps]]. The song [[name-dropping|namechecks]] many well-known 1980s 8-bit computer systems including [[Binatone]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX81]] and [[BBC Micro]].

In August 2004, the group reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart with "Guns Don't Kill People, Rappers Do".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Their first nationally released album was called ''[[Greatest Hits (Goldie Lookin Chain album)|Greatest Hits]]'', the name a play on both the group's previous lack of commercial success and their "stoner" image; it compiled a mixture of new material and selections from their previous six unofficial albums. It was released in September 2004, and debuted at number 5 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The album was released in May 2005 in the US with the title ''Straight Outta Newport,'' with cover art similar to [[N.W.A]]'s album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]''. However, this version of the album was missing two tracks – "Maggot" and "You Knows I Loves You".

Their next single release was "[[Your Mother's Got a Penis]]", with an accompanying video based on a supermarket theme. "Your Mother's Got a Penis" first appeared on their album ''The Manifesto'', and reached No. 14 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

The band – informally known as "the Chain" or simply "the GLC" – released "You Knows I Loves You Baby", a parody of 1980s love songs from the albums ''Greatest Hits'' and ''The Manifesto'', on 13 December 2004; this reached number 22 in the UK chart.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> "Your Missus Is a Nutter" was the first single from second album ''[[Safe as Fuck]]''. The album was originally going to be called "Safety in Numbers", a tribute to the album ''[[Power in Numbers]]'' by alternative L.A. rap group [[Jurassic 5]]. The single reached No. 14 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

On 17 October 2011, GLC released the album ''Blue Waffle'', featuring new songs including "Biscuit", "I Seen Your Mother", "K Hole" and "If I Told You". Later that year, group member and [[Doctor Who]] fan Adam Hussain contributed a memory about "How a first date was interrupted by The Doctor"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doctorwhobook.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/adam-hussain|work=Doctor Who Book|title=Adam Hussain|date=24 May 2011|access-date=16 October 2021}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=October 2021}} to a forthcoming Doctor Who charity book, designed to raise money for [[Alzheimer's Research UK]].

GLC released the follow up to their album ''Greatest Hits'', titled ''Greatest Hits 2,'' in 2015.

==Controversy==
In 2005, GLC were invited by the [[Football Association of Wales]] to perform before the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifying match against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Cardiff]]'s [[Millennium Stadium]]. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the nature of the band's music and the participation of England star [[David Beckham]], the band dedicated "[[Safe as Fuck|Your Missus Is a Nutter]]" to the footballer about his wife, who was present at the match. The ensuing furore, with the [[Wales national football team|Welsh]] [[association football|football]] authorities having to apologise to the Beckhams,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4222600.stm|work=BBC News|title=Beckham apology for rapper insult|date=7 September 2005|access-date=16 October 2021}}</ref> (despite David Beckham appearing to take the joke in good humour) as well as expressing outrage at the band's perceived lack of respect, prompted many people to question why the organisers, knowing their reputation, had hired them to play in the first place. In January 2009, GLC appeared on This Feeling TV, and revealed more about the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisfeeling.co.uk/tftv/5/GLC_@_This_Feeling|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306083458/http://www.thisfeeling.co.uk/tftv/5/GLC_%40_This_Feeling|work=This Feeling|title=TFTV January 2009 {{!}} GLC @ This FeelingGLC @ This Feeling|archive-date=6 March 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Sponsorship of Newport County Football Club==
Since their inception in the early 2000s, the group have maintained a close affiliation with their hometown football club, [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]]. GLC sponsored the team's kit during the team's 2004-05 season. Originally intended only for wear in matches in the [[FAW Premier Cup]], County were drawn away to similarly colour shirted [[Caernarfon Town F.C.|Caernarfon Town]] in the competition, leading to the club's GLC sponsored shirt being worn for two league matches, away to [[Maidenhead United F.C.|Maidenhead United]] and at home against [[Redbridge F.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/newportcounty/2642270685|work=[[Flickr]]|title=GLC kit|author=Jon Curtis|date=6 July 2008|access-date=16 October 2021}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=October 2021}} In 2021, they designed Newport’s 3rd kit in collaboration with [[Hummel International|Hummel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newport-county.co.uk/news/2021/september/exiles-glc-third-kit|work=Newport County AFC|title=
