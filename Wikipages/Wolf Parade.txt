'''Wolf Parade''' is a Canadian [[indie rock]] band formed in 2003 in Montreal. The band released three full-length albums before taking a five-year hiatus in 2011. They announced their return in 2016, releasing a [[Wolf Parade (2016 EP)|self-titled EP]] in May of that year, and a fourth studio album, ''[[Cry Cry Cry (Wolf Parade album)|Cry Cry Cry]]'', in October 2017. Their fifth studio album, ''[[Thin Mind]]'', was released on January 24, 2020.

==History==
Wolf Parade began in April 2003, when former [[Frog Eyes]] member [[Spencer Krug]] was offered a gig by [[Grenadine Records]]' Alex Megelas. With only a three-week deadline to form a band, Krug contacted a fellow Canadian guitarist [[Dan Boeckner]] (formerly of [[British Columbia]] band [[Atlas Strategic]]) and began writing songs in Krug's apartment.<ref name="Sub Pop">{{cite web| url= http://www.subpop.com/artists/wolf_parade |title= Wolf Parade Bio| website= [[Sub Pop|SubPop.com]]| access-date= August 13, 2007}}</ref> Initially using a [[drum machine]] for their rhythm section played through computer speakers, Krug later invited Arlen Thompson to the lineup as the drummer;<ref name="ICEAIR">{{cite web| first= Arlen| last= Thompson| url= http://www.icelandairwaves.com/artists.asp?pageID=&artistID=280 | url-status= dead| title= Wolf Parade at Iceland Airwaves| website= icelandairwaves.com| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070427061347/http://www.icelandairwaves.com/artists.asp?pageID=&artistID=280| archive-date= April 27, 2007| access-date= October 23, 2017}}</ref> however, the newly formed trio rehearsed as a full band only the day before their first show.<ref name="ICEAIR" /> During the tour, Wolf Parade recorded and released their self-titled debut EP (also known as their ''[[Wolf Parade (2003 EP)|4 Song EP]]'').

In September 2003,<ref name="exclaim.ca">{{cite web|last=Barclay |first=Michael |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid2=778&fid1=408&csid1=74 |title=Hungry Like the Wolf Parade |publisher=Exclaim.ca |access-date=2011-03-09}}</ref> Hadji Bakara joined Wolf Parade, contributing his synthesizer and sound manipulation skills to the lineup.<ref name="Sub Pop" /> By the summer of 2004 the band released its second independent, self-titled EP, commonly referred to as the ''[[Wolf Parade (2004 EP)|6 Song EP]]''.

In September 2004, the band traveled to [[Portland, Oregon]] to record with [[Modest Mouse]]'s [[Isaac Brock (musician)|Isaac Brock]]. Brock had recently signed the band to [[Sub Pop]] when he was an [[A&R]] man for the label at the time. He had known Dan Boeckner from his days in [[Atlas Strategic]], who had toured with Modest Mouse and were offered a Sub Pop signing just before the band split up. Wolf Parade spent two and a half weeks working 14-hour days in Portland. After some remixing, the band returned to Montreal to finish recording. The album was scheduled for a May release, but then pushed back.<ref name="exclaim.ca" /> On its new record label, the band released its first widely distributed EP, ''[[Wolf Parade (2005 EP)|Wolf Parade]]'', in July 2005.

In September 2005, the band's debut album ''[[Apologies to the Queen Mary]]'' was released on Sub Pop Records to critical acclaim,<ref>[http://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/17548/cohen-gould-buffy-25-best-canadian-debut-albums "25 best Canadian debut albums ever"].

Wolf Parade reconvened in November 2009 to begin work on their third album, ''[[Expo 86 (album)|Expo 86]]''. In an interview with ''[[Exclaim!]]'' magazine, Dan Boeckner stated that the album may be released as a double album or as an LP and an EP, given the sheer number of quality songs to come out of the sessions. The five members realized they had all been at Vancouver's World Fair in the same week when they were kids, which is how the album got its name.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carlick |first=Stephen |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/points.aspx?csid1=145 |title=Wolf Parade The Pack Reunited |publisher=Exclaim.ca |access-date=2011-03-09}}</ref> The album was produced by [[Howard Bilerman]] and was released in the United States on June 29, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=141&csid2=844&fid1=45174 |title=Exclusive: Wolf Parade Talk New LP - "This Is Not a Fussed-Over Computer Record" |website=Exclaim.ca |date=2010-03-19 |access-date=2011-03-09}}</ref>
