'''Mr. Bungle''' is an American [[experimental rock]] band from [[Northern California]]. Having gone through many incarnations throughout their career, the band is best known for their experimental rock period. During this time, they developed a highly eclectic style, cycling through several musical genres, often within the course of a single song, including [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[avant-garde jazz]], [[ska]], [[disco]], and [[funk]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bukszpan |first=Daniel |year=2012 |title=The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal: Completely Revised and Updated |publisher=Sterling |page=167 |isbn=978-1402792304}}</ref><ref name=Huey/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-01-12-ca-7039-story.html|title=POP MUSIC REVIEW : Mr. Bungle and Mike Patton of Faith No More at Lingerie|date=January 12, 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> This period also saw the band utilizing unconventional song structures and [[Sampling (music)|samples]]; playing a wide array of instruments; dressing up in masks, jumpsuits, and other costumes; and performing a diverse selection of [[cover song]]s during live performances.

The band was founded in [[Eureka, California]] in 1985 as a [[death metal]] project while the members were still in high school. They named themselves after a character in the 1959 children's [[educational film]] ''Beginning Responsibility: Lunchroom Manners'',<ref name=LunchroomManners>{{cite AV media |year=1959 | title=Lunchroom Manners | medium=Motion picture | location=United States | publisher=Coronet Films | url=https://archive.org/details/lunchroom_manners}}</ref> later featured in the 1981 [[HBO]] special ''The Pee-wee Herman Show''.<ref name=MrBungleFAQ>{{cite web |url=http://www.bunglefever.com/faq.html |title=Mr. Bungle Frequently Asked Questions |website=Bunglefever.com |access-date=September 2, 2012}}</ref> Mr. Bungle released four [[Demo (music)|demo tapes]] in the mid-to-late 1980s. They signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1990 on the back of lead vocalist [[Mike Patton]]'s success as frontman of [[Faith No More]], and released three full-length studio albums between 1991 and 1999, which featured the eclectic, experimental style they became known for. The band toured in 1999 and 2000 to support their third album before going on hiatus; ultimately revealing that they had dissolved.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6659786/mr_bungle_go_kaput |title=Mr. Bungle Go Kaput |work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |last=Prato |first=Greg |date=December 8, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503101857/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6659786/mr_bungle_go_kaput |archive-date=May 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |access-date=September 2, 2012}}</ref> They reunited as a [[thrash metal]] band for a series of shows in February 2020 to perform their 1986 demo album ''The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny'' with [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] guitarist [[Scott Ian]] and [[Slayer (band)|Slayer]] drummer [[Dave Lombardo]].<ref name="reunion">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mr-bungle-to-reunite-for-first-shows-in-nearly-20-years/|title=MR.

==History==
=== Formation (1985–1989)===

Mr. Bungle emerged after its members were kicked out of their respective previous bands. "It was kinda like a merger between two bands," Mike Patton recalled. "One really horrible [[gothic metal]] band, which our guitarist and original drummer were in, and one really horrible metal band which did [[Metallica]] covers, which is the one Trevor and me came from."<ref name="Bungle Bungle Rock Jaega 1991">''Bungle Bungle Rock'' Jaega, Trish (September 2, 1991). [[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]], Vancouver, United Kingdom.</ref> Mr. Bungle initially described themselves as a [[death metal]] band, but also dabbled in [[speed metal]], [[thrash metal]], and [[hardcore punk]]. The members came very close to naming the band Summer Breeze before settling on the name Mr. Bungle. The Mr. Bungle name was inspired by a [[Propaganda film|1950s propaganda film]] that they had seen as a segment of ''[[The Pee-wee Herman Show]]''. The members previously used the name to refer to a fellow classmate that they thought to be "a total goober" before adopting it as the band name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com/2015/08/mr-bungle-24.html|title=KIM EDWARDS MR. BUNGLE INTERVIEW|website=Faithnomorefollowers.com|access-date=February 2, 2021}}</ref>

Within a year of formation, the band expanded their sound to include ska. Trevor Dunn noted that,  "After about a year we got tired of playing speed metal and wanted to do something a little more creative. So we just stopped and started writing our own style of music, which was influenced by bands like [[Camper Van Beethoven]], [[Oingo Boingo]], [[Bad Manners]] and kind of [[funk]]y, ska-oriented stuff. Then we added a two-piece horn section and a new drummer, so now we don't really have any kind of limit on the music we play."<ref name="Bungle Bungle Rock Jaega 1991"/> Trey Spruance corroborated this. "When I was 15, I was in a death metal group," Spruance reminisced. "We had this idea that we were going to play a bunch of ska tunes for a bunch of metalheads. We just had this idea, you know: ‘Okay, we’re going to play this ska music, and that’ll be amazing.’ Half of the audience hated us, but there was definitely a joy in confronting that wall between styles.”<ref>''Freeform Mayhem'' Varty, Alexander (January 5, 2006). [[The Georgia Straight]], Vancouver, British Columbia.</ref>

Given that the band's background was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton had to teach him to play the [[ska stroke]] for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't know how to do that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these [[Camper Van Beethoven]] songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played [[The Specials]], but that's what we were listening to."<ref name="culturecreature.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.culturecreature.com/trey-spruance-interview-faith-no-more-mr-bungle/|title=Interview with Trey Spruance of Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Secret Chiefs 3 – Culture Creature|date=August 30, 2016|website=Culturecreature.com|access-date=January 3, 2017}}</ref>

Mr. Bungle played their first show during November 1985 at the Bayside Grange Hall.<ref name="trey"/> The band's first demo, ''The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny'', was recorded during Easter of 1986. It featured a fast, lo-fi [[death metal|death]]/[[thrash metal|thrash]] sound, with touches of ska.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2014/02/14/trey-spruance-of-secret-chiefs-3-on-slayer-stravinsky-and-the-possibility-of-reuniting-mr-bungle|title=Trey Spruance of Secret Chiefs 3 on Slayer, Stravinsky, and the Possibility of Reuniting Mr. Bungle|first=Dave|last=Pehling|website=Archives.sfweekly.com}}</ref> Instruments utilized on the album included a [[train whistle]], saxophone, [[Bongo drum|bongos]] and a [[kazoo]]. ''The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny'' was followed in 1987 by the ''Bowel of Chiley'' demo; it featured a much greater ska presence, as well as the sounds of [[jazz]], [[swing music|swing]] and [[funk]]. Bradley Torreano noted at [[AllMusic]] that the recording was "essentially the sound of some very talented teenagers trying to make their love of jazz and ska come together in whatever way they can."<ref name="Torreano"/> In 1988, Mr. Bungle released their third demo, ''Goddammit I Love America!'', which was musically similar to ''Bowel of Chiley''. Mike Patton described its style as "funkadelic, thrashing, circus, ska."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com/2016/03/mr-bungle-raging-wrath-of-easter-bunny.html|title=MR BUNGLE – Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny – 30 Years|website=Faithnomorefollowers.com|access-date=June 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bunglefever.com/images/flyers/GDILA-Ad.jpg|format=JPG|title=Advertisement image|website=Bunglefever.com|access-date=September 1, 2019}}</ref> In 1988, Mike Patton became the lead vocalist for San Francisco's [[Faith No More]], getting the job after the band heard him on the first two Mr. Bungle demos.<ref name=FNM>{{cite web |url=http://www.fnm.com/bio.shtml |title=::Official Faith No More Site:: Biography |website=Fnm.com |access-date=September 2, 2012}}</ref> Patton continued to be a member of both bands simultaneously and Mr. Bungle released ''OU818'', their final demo tape, in 1989. ''OU818'', was the first release to feature both tenor sax player Clinton "Bär" McKinnon and drummer Danny Heifetz and contained re-recorded songs from the earlier demos, as well as several new tracks. At the time of this release, Mike Patton described Mr. Bungle as a "weirdo [[funk]] band".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QNyNBNazzE|title=Mike Patton [Fantômas] Canadian TV 2001 Interview|date=April 8, 2010|access-date=March 2, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

During 1990, the band members left Eureka for San Francisco, in search of greater musical opportunities. Trey Spruance said the change in location influenced the band's style, remarking "[we were interested in] [[Slayer]] and [[Mercyful Fate]]. Later it was [[The Specials]] and [[Fishbone]].

Mr. Bungle were assumed to be in another period of self-described "[[hibernation]]",<ref name="MrBungleFAQ"/> with Patton optimistically stating in October 2001 to ''[[Kerrang!]]'' that "it's gotta take a rest.

===Post-breakup events (2000–2019)===
After the dissolution of Mr. Bungle, the members went on to numerous different projects. Mike Patton co-founded the record label [[Ipecac Recordings]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Ipecac Recordings: About | publisher = Ipecac Recordings Official Site | url = http://www.ipecac.com/about.php | access-date = May 25, 2007}}</ref> and is involved with several other ventures, including various works with composer [[John Zorn]], and most notably the bands [[Fantômas (band)|Fantômas]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Fantômas Biography | publisher = Ipecac Recordings Official Site | url = http://www.ipecac.com/artists/fantomas | access-date = May 25, 2007}}</ref> [[Tomahawk (band)|Tomahawk]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Tomahawk Biography | publisher = Ipecac Recordings Official Site | url = http://www.ipecac.com/artists/tomahawk | access-date = May 25, 2007}}</ref> and [[Peeping Tom (band)|Peeping Tom]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Peeping Tom Biography | publisher = Ipecac Recordings Official Site | url = http://www.ipecac.com/artists/peeping_tom | access-date = May 25, 2007}}</ref> In 2004, he was called upon by Icelandic singer-songwriter [[Björk]] to provide vocal work on her album ''[[Medúlla]]''.

Spruance joined Patton and Faith No More onstage for the first time to perform the ''King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime'' album in its entirety in Santiago in November 2011.<ref name="culturecreature.com"/> Mike Patton sang on the [[Secret Chiefs 3]] song "La Chanson de Jacky" in 2012 giving further speculation by fans on the chance of a reunion. Despite this, Trevor Dunn stated in a February 2013 interview with ''[[SF Weekly]]'' that there will be no Mr. Bungle reunion, saying, "I've heard the faintest murmurings about it, but honestly I don't think anyone is interested. It's nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again. It would take a pant-load of money to make it happen, and honestly, I don't want to do it for that reason.

===Reunion and ''The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny Demo'' (2019–present)===
On August 13, 2019, it was announced that Mr. Bungle would reunite in February 2020 for three shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco and [[Brooklyn]]. The reunion was promoted as featuring Patton, Spruance and Dunn, as well as guitarist [[Scott Ian]] and drummer [[Dave Lombardo]], performing the 1986 demo album ''The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny'' in its entirety. On August 15, after a strong demand for tickets for all three shows, the band added an additional show to each city. A third L.A. show was added on August 21, bringing the total number of reunion shows to seven. The band stated on their Facebook page that they were not going to perform any songs from their Warner Bros. albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MrBungle/status/1218700607353229312|title=Gentle reminder: we're playing nothing from any of our WB records.

During the reunion shows, Mr. Bungle covered songs of various metal and hardcore punk bands such as [[Slayer]], [[Corrosion of Conformity]], [[Circle Jerks]], [[Crumbsuckers]] and [[Cro-Mags]] in addition to performing three previously unreleased songs which were written during the era of ''The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny'' demo: "Glutton For Punishment", "Methamatics", and "Eracist". Although the entire recording was promoted as being performed, non-metal songs from the demo (such as "Grizzly Adams" and "Evil Satan") were absent from the performances. The only exception was "Hypocrites", albeit with the ska sections eliminated.<ref>[https://www.trevordunn.net/copia-verborum/85ghgm6g09rdi69x0kr8lnbb4vfls1]</ref>

The choice of songs received a mixed reaction from certain portions of the band's fanbase. In their review of the Los Angeles gig, ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' wrote "One of the most quietly influential bands in metal reunited last night in Los Angeles ... to play zero of the songs that made them influential."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/review-mr-bungle-astound-and-antagonize-first-show-nearly-20-years|title=Review: Mr. Bungle Astound and Antagonize at First Show in Nearly 20 Years|date=February 6, 2020|website=Revolver|access-date=July 16, 2020}}</ref>

Alongside the announcement, they released an animated music video for the single "Raping Your Mind" directed by Eric Livingston. Dunn described re-recording their earliest material with Lombardo and Ian like "we were finally utilizing our Ph.Ds in Thrash Metal. All we had to do was go back to our original professors for some additional guidance and talk them into joining us. Turns out we were A+ students... We were haunted for 35 years by the fact that this music wasn't given it's [sic] due respect.

==Style and influence==
Prior to the release of their first album in 1991, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that the band "performs oddball music one critic has described as [[Bugs Bunny]]-type jazz."<ref name="latimes91"/> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' referred to the band as "[[Frank Zappa|Zappa]]-esque [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] pranksters" in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2000/music/reviews/sno-core-2000-1117775594/|title=Review: 'Sno-Core 2000'|first=Troy J.|last=Augusto|date=January 25, 2000|website=Variety|access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> Allmusic's Greg Prato described Mr. Bungle's music as a "unique mix of the experimental, the abstract, and the absurd",<ref name=allmusic.com/> while Patrick Macdonald of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' characterized their music as "harsh, grating, unstructured, blasting, squeaky, speedy, slow, eerie and strangely compelling".<ref name=Macdonald/> Distinctive features of the music were the use of numerous different instruments, unusual vocals, and the use of unpredictable song formats along with a number of different musical genres. Greg Prato stated they "may be the most talented rock instrumentalists today, as they skip musical genres effortlessly, while Mike Patton illustrates why many consider him to be the best singer in rock".<ref name="DV Rev"/> Not all have agreed, with one reviewer calling the band the "most ridiculously terrible piece of festering offal ever scraped off the floor of a slaughterhouse".<ref name=GRP/> Journalist [[Geoffrey Himes]] criticized the band by stating "the vocals are so deeply buried in the music that the words are virtually indecipherable" and described the music as "aural montages rather than songs, for short sections erupt and suddenly disappear, replaced by another passage with little connection to what preceded it".<ref name=himes/>

The majority of the band's music and lyrics were written by Patton, Dunn, and Spruance, with McKinnon and Heifetz occasionally contributing.<ref name=MBAC/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Mr. Bungle | title = Disco Volante Album Credits | publisher = Warner Bros.

You bring some ideas and if you're not 100 percent firm about bringing a certain idea to this group, you can watch it get kicked aside and die really quickly."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqc5KIriYqA|title=Mr. Bungle- BTS Interview Part 2- Bär McKinnon & Danny Heifetz|date=September 6, 2011|access-date=January 7, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

It has been noted that the band were given an unusual amount of artistic freedom during their tenure with the major label [[Warner Bros. Records]]. In a 2016 interview, Trevor Dunn reflected —
{{cquote|I seem to remember that they always left us alone. Patton was a big asset to them financially and in that regard it gave us some power because they had to appease him. That, for one, meant giving him the freedom to work with us as he always had. I don't believe any of our records ever recouped which isn't that big of a deal for a major label who have much larger fish to fry. For them it is just another tax write-off. And I have a sneaking suspicion that they possibly believed we would 'grow up' musically some day and make them some money.|author=Trevor Dunn<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com/2016/10/trevor-dunn-disco-volante-interview.html|title=TREVOR DUNN – Disco Volante Interview|website=Faithnomorefollowers.com|access-date=January 5, 2017}}</ref>}}

Trey Spruance claimed that Warner Bros. cared so little about the band that they at one point were considering delivering an entire album of blank static noise, knowing that the label wouldn't listen to it in the first place.<ref name="culturecreature.com"/> He said, "We could’ve delivered them static, literally. We thought about it. We almost did it, we were thinking about doing that. Then we realized – actually it doesn't matter to them; that would seem like a big statement but they would just shrug. They don't care about that shit."<ref name="culturecreature.com"/>

Mr. Bungle's style has influenced many acts from the [[alternative metal]] genre,<ref name=nu/> most notably [[Korn]], who have utilized what they have dubbed the "Mr. Bungle [[Guitar chord|chord]]"<ref name=rollingstone/> (A flat fifth chord or "[[Tritone]]"). [[James Shaffer|James "Munky" Shaffer]], one of Korn's guitarists, stated in a 2015 interview that Mr. Bungle's self-titled debut "set the tone for us and what we went on to do creatively".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/opinion/under-the-influence-korns-james-munky-shaffer|title=Korn's James 'Munky' Shaffer – Under the Influence |website=Theskinny.co.uk|access-date=January 5, 2017}}</ref> [[Brandon Boyd]] of [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]<ref name=revolver>{{cite news | last=Azerrad | first=Mike | title=Mike Patton Interview | newspaper=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] | date=March–April 2002}}</ref> similarly cites early Mr. Bungle as an influence, with Incubus's 1995 debut album ''[[Fungus Amongus]]'' mentioning them in the liner notes.

==Stage shows and image==
[[Image:91SantaClaraMike.jpg|thumbnail|150px|Mike Patton in costume live in 1991]]
Mr. Bungle were known for their characteristically unconventional stage shows, where the band members would dress up in costumes and masks. In the early stages of their career they would often wear a uniform of mechanic's jumpsuits along with masks such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Darth Vader]], an executioner's hood or plastic clown or [[Bondage hood|gimp]] masks.<ref name=Joost>{{cite web |url=http://sonic.net/~goblin/8bunghole.html |title=Mr. Bungle Have No Bungholes |last=Joost |first=Wesley |website=Sonic.net|access-date=September 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225172927/http://sonic.net/~goblin/8bunghole.html |archive-date=February 25, 2012  }}</ref> Bassist Trevor Dunn claimed that initially the reason for the dressing up was to assure anonymity.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=G. |date=March 20, 1992 |title=Mr. Bungle to Show Its Face at Gothic |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |page=3–E}}</ref> Regarding their heavy usage of clown and carnival themes, Trey Spruance explained "The thing is, every now and then while driving around aimlessly as teenagers blasting [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]]’s ''[[Obsessed by Cruelty]]'' album at 3&nbsp;am, Patton and I would run across these redneck carnivals popping-up overnight on the periphery of town, in the middle of nowhere. We called them "Satanic Carnivals" due to their unexplained phantasmic arrival, and their pointless neon lights no one was around to appreciate as they sparkled up against the dreary fog. The next night, when they'd be open, we'd actually go to these god-damned things. There was certainly a malice to the toothless [[meth]]-heads running the barely-functioning rides, and the fights that would break out among drunken loggers, but it was all pretty standard fare – no evil clowns."<ref name="fnmf16">{{cite web|url=http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com/2016/11/trey-spruance-halloween-interview.html|title=TREY SPRUANCE HALLOWEEN INTERVIEW|website=Faithnomorefollowers.com|access-date=January 7, 2018}}</ref>

The band simply wore stockings to cover their faces during at least portions of the "Disco Volante" tour. The 1999–2000 shows in support of the ''California'' album usually featured Dunn dressed as a blonde girl resembling [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] or The [[St. Pauli Girl]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/mr-bungle-beats-queen-neil-young-under-the-stars/|title=Mr. Bungle Beats Queen; Neil Young Under the Stars – Manhattan, New York, NY |website=Nypress.com|access-date=February 17, 2017}}</ref> although for the other members this period was largely devoid of masks and outfits due to the increased demands of the music.<ref name=CNN/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Gadino |first=Dylan |title=Leap from Faith: Mike Patton Strikes Again with Mr. Bungle |journal=Rockpile |url=http://nirrosive.tripod.com/articles/article21.txt |access-date=September 2, 2012}}</ref> Mike Patton explained, "This stuff is much harder to play, I was trying to do piano lines and I'm completely fumbling them because the leather bondage mask is stretching my face so tight that my eyes weren't lining up with the eye holes."<ref name=rose>{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Lisa |date=November 5, 1999 |title=Mike Patton Interview |newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]] |page=9}}</ref> Often the theme was related to California, with palm tree props and the band members wearing beach party outfits, including [[Hawaiian shirt]]s and [[khaki]] pants.<ref name=CNN/> Occasionally, the band would simply appear in black suits with white dress shirts or dress up in chef costumes, cowboy suits or as the [[Village People]].<ref name=GRP>{{cite news |last=Serba |first=John |date=February 8, 2000 |title=Sno-Core Tour Smacks the Fans Silly |newspaper=[[The Grand Rapids Press]] |page=C4}}</ref>

Throughout their career, Mr. Bungle also performed numerous [[Cover version|covers]] in their live shows, ranging from tiny snippets to whole songs. The covers drew from a wide variety of artists and genres encompassing hardcore punk and heavy metal songs by the [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Van Halen]] and [[Slayer]], movie scores by [[Ennio Morricone]], [[Henry Mancini]] and [[John Williams]], ska tunes by [[Camper Van Beethoven]],<ref name="culturecreature.com"/> pop songs by [[Elton John]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]], as well as hip hop by [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. They frequently covered [[Billy Squier]]'s "[[The Stroke]]".<ref name=MrBungleFAQ/>
