'''Impetigo''' was an American [[deathgrind]]/[[goregrind]] band. They were among the first bands to use clips from [[films]] and other media as intros for their songs.

== Overview ==
Their lyrical themes mostly include 1970s and '80s [[splatter films]], [[cannibal films]] and gore.

In 2010 they released a DVD entitled ''Defiling the Stage'' which includes four live acts, one in 1987, two in 1990 and one reunion show from 2007.

In 2003, Razorback Records released ''[[Wizards of Gore]]'', an Impetigo tribute album, featuring [[Blood Duster]], [[Mortician (band)|Mortician]], [[Machetazo]], [[Impaled (band)|Impaled]], [[Haemorrhage (band)|Haemorrhage]], [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]], [[Cock and Ball Torture (band)|Cock and Ball Torture]], Lymphatic Phlegm, [[Last Days of Humanity]], [[Gore Beyond Necropsy]], Lord Gore, and more. Razorback Records has also released the "ultimate" reissues of the ''[[Ultimo Mondo Cannibale (album)|Ultimo Mondo Cannibale]]'' and ''[[Horror of the Zombies]]'' albums, which include the original artwork, liner notes by bassist/vocalist Stevo Dobbins, and bonus tracks.
