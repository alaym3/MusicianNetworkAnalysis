'''People Under the Stairs''' was an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo from [[Los Angeles, California]], formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2019. Since their inception, the group consisted solely of Christopher Portugal ([[Thes One]]) and Michael Turner ([[Double K (American musician)|Double K]]). The group employed a [[DIY ethic|DIY work ethic]] of [[Sampling (music)|sampling]], [[Rapping|MCing]], [[Disc jockey|DJing]], and [[Music production|producing]] all of their output.<ref>{{cite web|last = Anderson |first = Rick |work=[[Allmusic]] |date=2003-08-19 |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/or-stay-tuned-mw0000599663 |title=''...Or Stay Tuned'' Album Review |access-date=2014-02-26}}</ref>

Despite difficulties achieving mainstream or chart successes, the group rejected the label of [[underground hip hop]]. They achieved prominence and acclaim, along with praise from fellow musicians.<ref name="Edwards">{{cite book|last=Edwards |first=Paul |title =[[How to Rap|How To Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC]] |year=2009 |isbn=1-55652-816-7 |publisher= [[Chicago Review Press]] |pages=316}}</ref>

==History==

=== 1996–1999: Formation, ''The Next Step'' ===
While attending high school in [[Mid-City Los Angeles]], group members [[Thes One]] and [[Double K (American musician)|Double K]] were independently [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] music, creating beat tapes, and [[Disc jockey|DJing]] local events. Thes One attended [[Loyola High School (Los Angeles)|Loyola High]], and Double K attended [[Alexander Hamilton High School (Los Angeles)|Hamilton High]] and was a part of the Log Cabin Crew, a hip hop collective that also included fellow Hamilton High students [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]], [[Eligh]] and [[Scarub]] (of [[Living Legends (group)|Living Legends]]). They met while looking for sample material in a record store and were impressed by each other's work, forming a friendship.<ref name="LA Weekly">{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Weekly]] |last = Jeff |first = Weiss |date=2009-01-07 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-01-08/music/up-with-people-under-the-stairs-a-hip-hop-duo-celebrates-a-decade-in-la/ |title=Up with People Under the Stairs |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref>

The group decided to use the name "People Under the Stairs" because they felt it represented their music aesthetic; during a time when most other hip hop artists were forming large crews or collectives, they wanted to stay out of the spotlight and concentrate on the music, only coming out from "under the stairs" to perform before they went back again.<ref name="urbansmarts.com">{{cite web|work=Urban Smarts |date=2002-03-22 |url=http://www.urbansmarts.com/interviews/puts.htm |title=People Under the Stairs' Double K |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> The group's name does not originate from the 1991 [[Wes Craven]] film ''[[The People Under the Stairs]]'', as they were not aware of it when conceiving the group.<ref name="urbansmarts.com"/>

In 1998, while Thes One was attending the [[University of Southern California]], People Under the Stairs used Thes One's [[student loan]] funds to create, package and release their first [[12-inch single]], entitled ''The Next Step II''. Nearly 500 copies were pressed, and the record sold well.<ref name="SF Bay Guardian">{{cite web|work=[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]] |last = Nicholson |first = Peter |date=2002-08-21 |url=http://www.sfbg.com/36/47/art_music_om.html |title=Keep on keepin' Om |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> They would go on to release their first album, ''[[The Next Step (People Under the Stairs album)|The Next Step]]'', in 1998. The album was recorded on an 8-track [[ADAT]] digital recorder, mostly at Thes One's home in Los Angeles, and was engineered entirely by Thes One and Double K. This album failed to make an impact in the Los Angeles hip hop scene,<ref name="The Urb">{{cite web |work=The Urb |last=Ma |first=David |date=2009-11-27 |url=http://www.urb.com/2009/11/27/out-from-under-interview-with-thes-one-of-puts/ |title=Out From Under: Interview With Thes One of PUTS |access-date=2014-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223094029/http://www.urb.com/2009/11/27/out-from-under-interview-with-thes-one-of-puts/ |archive-date=2014-02-23 }}</ref><ref name="Metrojolt">{{cite web |work=Metrojolt |last=Deejmeister |date=2011-04-14 |url=http://metrojolt.com/people-under-the-stairs-review-and-interview |title=People Under The Stairs – Show Review+Interview |access-date=2014-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116041537/http://www.metrojolt.com/people-under-the-stairs-review-and-interview |archive-date=2012-01-16 }}</ref> though the group found a larger fan base in Europe, embarking on a tour in August 1999. They signed to [[Om Records]], a music label generally known at the time for [[electronic music]] and [[club music]], for a four-album deal.<ref name="SF Bay Guardian"/> The European leg of the tour, though it began as an Om Records tour, evolved into a solo act for People Under the Stairs.

=== 2000–2003: ''Question in the Form of an Answer, O.S.T'', ''and ...Or Stay Tuned'' ===
Their sophomore album, ''[[Question in the Form of an Answer]]'', was released in June 2000. Like ''The Next Step'', the album was self-recorded and used an eclectic and diverse range of beats rooted in [[jazz]] and [[psychedelic rock]], as well as [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering techniques]] learned from studying analog sound equipment. The album was supported by singles "Youth Explosion", "The Cat" and "We'll Be There". People Under the Stairs embarked on a second world tour to support the record, including performances at the 2000 [[Glastonbury Festival]] and Essential Music Festival, alongside [[Biz Markie]], [[Ice-T]], [[Gerry Mulligan|Gerry "Jeru" Mulligan]], [[Masta Ace]] and [[De La Soul]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Songkick]] |url=http://www.songkick.com/festivals/899-essential-music/id/2319171-essential-festival-2001 |title=Essential Music Festival 2001 |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> During this tour, the group released their first compilation album, ''[[American Men Vol. 1]]'', sold at concert venues, while Om Records also re-released ''The Next Step'' in 2001.

The group enjoyed a degree of success in the Los Angeles hip hop scene, including Thes One's participation in a beat battle against fellow Los Angeles recording artist [[will.i.am]] on April 25, 2002. Their third album, ''[[O.S.T. (album)|O.S.T.]]'', was released in June 2002. The album was again produced in Thes One's home by the duo and released on Om records. ''O.S.T.'' proved to be more complex than the group's first albums; the track "Montego Slay" used over 20 minuscule sections of music from Jamaican tourist souvenir records. The group also used live instrumentation for the first time on a release, enlisting Headnodic (of the [[Crown City Rockers]] and [[The Mighty Underdogs]]) to play electric bass. People Under the Stairs supported the release of ''O.S.T.'' by playing at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]],<ref>{{cite web |work=Reading Festival official website |url=http://www.readingfestival.com/history/reading-festival-2002 |title=Reading Festival 2002 |access-date=2014-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227083410/http://www.readingfestival.com/history/reading-festival-2002 |archive-date=2014-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> was well as the US Cali-Comm hip hop tour with [[Del the Funky Homosapien]], [[KutMasta Kurt]], [[Planet Asia]], and the [[Lifesavas]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=October 2002 |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73915/west-coast-rappers-set-for-cali-comm-trek |title=West Coast Rappers Set For Cali-Comm Trek |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> 

The group's final album released under Om Records was 2003 ''[[...Or Stay Tuned]]'', though it was originally marketed and labeled as an [[Extended play|EP]] release, due to contractual issues. The group would later reclassify the record a full-length release.

===2004–2006: Side projects and ''Stepfather''===
In 2004, the group concluded their contract with Om Records. Thes One began work on a number of side projects, including co-founding [[Thes One#Tres Records|Tres Records]] with Chikara Kurahashi from [[Giant Panda (group)|Giant Panda]], and two [[12-inch single]]s on the label, ''Noonen'' (an ode to the 1980 comedy film ''[[Caddyshack]]'') and ''Doin' It'' (with Raashan Ahmad of [[Crown City Rockers]]). In May 2004, he coordinated the ''[[Bloquera]]'' project, a trip to southernmost Baja California to record an EP with members of Giant Panda and shoot a video on [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]]; he also produced and mixed ''[[Fly School Reunion]]'', the debut album of Giant Panda.

In 2005, People Under the Stairs signed a deal with a smaller, local Los Angeles label, Basement Records, for domestic release of their next album, with overseas distribution by Tres Records. Just before the release of the album, the group grew annoyed by internet music piracy and peer-to-peer file sharing. In a move that was equal parts a precautionary measure and a joke aimed at over-eager fans, People Under the Stairs decided to leak a fake version of the album onto the internet in the month preceding the album's release in 2006. When the real album was released in April, ''[[Stepfather (album)|Stepfather]]'' debuted at #32 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'']] Heatseaker Chart and #35 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart,<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=people under the stairs|chart=all}} "Stepfather Billboard Chart History"]</ref> and the album was met with widespread positive reviews and received more coverage than the group's previous efforts.<ref name="TinyMixTapes">{{cite web|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/people-under-stairs-stepfather|title=Music Review: People Under The Stairs&nbsp;-&nbsp;Stepfather}}</ref><ref>[http://www.okayplayer.com/reviews/index.php/weblog/more/stepfather/ Okayplayer Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609235706/http://www.okayplayer.com/reviews/index.php/weblog/more/stepfather/ |date=2008-06-09 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r828428|title=Stepfather - People Under the Stairs {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref> The group made an effort to expand beyond sample-based hip.hop, using a broader, less-jazzy sound palate and inviting [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] to perform on an album interlude.

They toured the US through spring 2006, taking along the rock-rap group [[Gym Class Heroes]] as their opening act. In the summer and fall of 2006, the group embarked on another world tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Europe. For the Europe leg of the tour, they were accompanied by Giant Panda.

=== 2007–2010: ''Fun DMC'', ''The Om Years'', and ''Carried Away'' ===
Following the release of ''Stepfather'', Thes One released his debut solo album, ''[[Lifestyle Marketing]]'', on Tres Records. The album was well received in the hip hop community.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=lifestyle-marketing-mw0000478369}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=[[URB (magazine)|URB]] |date=2007-04-17 |url=http://www.urb.com/2007/04/17/thes-one-lifestyle-marketing/ |title=Thes One - Lifestyle Marketing (Review) |access-date=2014-02-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228093151/http://www.urb.com/2007/04/17/thes-one-lifestyle-marketing/ |archive-date=2014-02-28 }}</ref> Double K also released a solo instrumental track, "Face to Face", on a [[Split album|split single]] with Los Angeles producer Olde Soul. In 2008, the group worked with director [[Matt Bird]] to film a video for "The Wiz", a song about their experiences touring in Australia, while on location in [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi Beach]]. This was the group's first music video.<ref>{{cite web|work = Chesterfilm |date=2008-09-30 |url=http://www.chesterfilm.com.au/latestnews/?p=4 |title=Latest News, 20 Sept 2008 |access-date=2014-02-27}}</ref> Om Records released a retrospective album, ''[[The Om Years]]'', including a bonus CD of B-sides and rarities.

People Under the Stairs finished recording in fall 2008 and released their new album, ''[[FUN DMC]]'', in September. Like the previous album, ''FUN DMC'' was released under an independent record label, [[Studio !K7|Gold Dust Media]], receiving positive reviews and debuting at #6 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] Heatseekers chart.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=people under the stairs|chart=all}} Fun DMC ''Billboard'' Chart History].</ref> The name of the album is an homage to the group [[Run-DMC]]; the album itself is a [[concept album]] involving the daily life of someone living and enjoying themselves in the Los Angeles neighborhoods where they grew up. They brought recording equipment to a [[South Central Los Angeles|South Central]] house party and barbecue, and used the ambient noise from the party to supplement the "daytime" songs on the new album.<ref name="Soul Sides">{{cite episode|title=#15: Thes One of People Under The Stairs|url=http://soul-sides.com/2011/09/the-sidebar-15-thes-one-of-people-under-the-stairs/|series=The Sidebar|credits=Presenter: Oliver Wang|airdate=2011-09-13}}</ref>

Following a nationwide tour of the US in support of the album, People Under the Stairs celebrated their 10-year anniversary with a sold-out show at the historic [[El Rey Theatre]] in Los Angeles. The performance was released on DVD the following year. The group would return to Om Records for their next record, ''[[Carried Away (People Under the Stairs album)|Carried Away]]'', which debuted at #5 on the iTunes hip hop charts and at #23 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'']] Heatseeker Charts.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=people under the stairs|chart=all}} ''Billboard Chart History for Carried Away''].</ref>

=== 2011–2012: ''Highlighter'', ''12 Step Program'' and ''The Gettin' off Stage'' ===
Unsatisfied with their past record labels, Thes One made the decision after ''Carried Away'' to take complete control of the production process for the group's albums, releasing all new material under a new business entity, Piecelock 70. Thes One constructed a new recording facility in downtown Los Angeles.<ref name="PopBreak">{{cite web|last = Barna |first = Maxwell |work=Pop Break |date=2012-01-06 |url=http://pop-break.com/2012/01/06/interview-people-under-the-stairs/ |title=Interview: People Under The Stairs |access-date=2014-03-05}}</ref> Piecelock 70 released all subsequent People Under the Stairs albums, as well as material by other artists, including Headnodic, [[DJ Day]] and Doc Delay. Thes One made the decision to run Piecelock 70 under a [[worker cooperative]] business model, allowing associate artists to retain complete control over their output while sharing resources and using the label's facilities.<ref name="KNcom">{{cite web |last=Justin |work=KevinNottingham.com |date=2011-10-17 |url=http://www.kevinnottingham.com/2011/10/17/thes-one-discusses-aging-in-hip-hop-highlighters-hd-release-and-piecelock-70-part-1/ |title=Thes One Discusses Aging In Hip Hop, Highlighter’s HD Release And Piecelock 70, Part 1 |access-date=2014-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306090921/http://www.kevinnottingham.com/2011/10/17/thes-one-discusses-aging-in-hip-hop-highlighters-hd-release-and-piecelock-70-part-1/ |archive-date=2014-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On June 17, 2011, People Under the Stairs joined a large and eclectic group of musicians, including [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]], [[Big Boi]], [[Pretty Lights]], [[Mac Miller]], and [[Empire of the Sun (band)|Empire of the Sun]], to kick off the inaugural Governor's Ball Music Festival in NYC.<ref>{{cite web|last = Bojalad |first = Alec |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=2011-06-20 |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/photos/live/470377/girl-talk-big-boi-ring-in-nycs-inaugural-governors-ball |title=Girl Talk, Big Boi Ring In NYC's Inaugural Governors Ball |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> While on stage at the show, they announced their subsequent album, ''[[Highlighter (album)|Highlighter]]'', released on September 30, 2011. This was the first album on the new Piecelock 70 label, Like ''Stepfather'', the album was one of the more experimental releases for the group, employing alternate time-signatures, live instrumentation, and a string section.

==Musical style and influences==
Before the inception of People Under the Stairs, the group's members attended many [[West Coast hip hop]] shows in Lost Angeles. In numerous interviews, the group has cited many of these groups as influences, including [[Freestyle Fellowship]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[Jurassic 5]], and [[The Beatnuts]]. The group paid direct homage to [[A Tribe Called Quest]] on the song "Check the Vibe" on 2009's ''[[Carried Away (People Under the Stairs album)|Carried Away]]''. Other cited influences include [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], and West Coast [[gangsta rap]] such as [[DJ Quik]] and [[Eazy-E]].

For the most part, the group avoided sociopolitical or activist themes, [[gangster rap]], [[battle rap]], and material wealth. Instead, they focused on personal experiences and enjoyment, including life in (and pride for) [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[video game|video gaming]], [[barbecue]]s and food, [[recreational drug use]], and relaxing. A small portion of songs have dealt with more serious themes. People Under the Stairs drew on a wide array of record samples to create their work, including jazz, funk, rock, and spoken word. Thes One made an extensive study of the history of [[electronic musical instruments|electronic instrumentation]], eventually giving college lectures on the subject.<ref name="tPotR UO">{{cite web|last = Portugal |first = Christopher |date=2011-10-27 |url=http://www.thepointoftherhyme.com/UOlecture.htm |title=University of Oregon lecture, October 27, 2011 |work=The Point of the Rhyme |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Despite being considered underground and never having achieved breakout mainstream success, they have been lauded by many other acclaimed artists, including [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[Biz Markie]],<ref name="HipHopDX">{{cite web|last = Meara |first = Paul |date=2011-12-28 |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.18100/title.people-under-the-stairs-speak-on-touring-with-mac-miller-wonderful-radio |title=People Under The Stairs Speak On Touring With Mac Miller, "Wonderful Radio" |work=Hip Hop DX |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> and [[Trey Anastasio]] of the rock band [[Phish]].<ref name="Subsoniq">{{cite episode|title=People Under The Stairs interview|url=http://subsoniqradio.com|series=Subsoniq Radio|network=[[XM Satellite Radio]]|credits=Presenters: KB and Murdoch|airdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> The group was chosen, alongside other artists, to appear in and remix the main theme for ''[[The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice!]]''. The group also had music featured in [[Run's House]], [[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]], and the feature film [[Street Dreams (film)|Street Dreams]].

In October 2011, [[Mac Miller]] released a mixtape entitled ''I Love Life, Thank You'' which included a homage to the group on the song "People Under the Stairs". People Under the Stairs opened for Miller during several shows on his ''[[Blue Slide Park]]'' tour that year.
