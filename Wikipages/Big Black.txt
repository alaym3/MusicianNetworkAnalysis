'''Big Black''' was an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Evanston, Illinois]], active from 1981 to 1987. Founded by singer and guitarist [[Steve Albini]], the band's initial lineup also included guitarist [[Santiago Durango]] and bassist [[Jeff Pezzati]], both of [[Naked Raygun]]. In 1985, Pezzati was replaced by [[Dave Riley (musician)|Dave Riley]], who played on Big Black's two full-length [[studio album]]s, ''[[Atomizer (album)|Atomizer]]'' (1986) and ''[[Songs About Fucking]]'' (1987).

Big Black's aggressive and abrasive music was characterized by distinctively clanky guitars and the use of a [[drum machine]] rather than a [[drum kit]], elements that foreshadowed [[industrial rock]]. The band's lyrics flouted commonly held [[taboo]]s and dealt frankly—and often explicitly—with politically and culturally loaded topics including [[murder]], [[rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[arson]], [[racism]], and [[misogyny]]. Though the band's lyrics contained controversial material, the lyrics were meant to serve as a commentary or a display of distaste for the subject matter. They were staunchly critical of the commercial nature of rock, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career. At the height of their success, they booked their own tours, paid for their own recordings, refused to sign contracts, and eschewed many of the traditional corporate trappings of rock bands. In doing so, they had a significant impact on the aesthetic and political development of [[independent music|independent]] and [[underground music|underground]] rock music.

In addition to two studio albums, Big Black released two [[live album]]s, two [[compilation album]]s, four [[extended play|EPs]], and five [[single (music)|singles]], all through [[independent record label]]s. Most of the band's catalog was kept in print through [[Touch and Go Records]] for years following their breakup.

==History==
===1981–1982: Formation and ''Lungs''===
Big Black was founded by [[Steve Albini]] in 1981 during his second year of college at [[Northwestern University]].<ref name="Azerrad, 314">{{cite book |last=Azerrad |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Azerrad |title=[[Our Band Could Be Your Life|Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981–1991]] |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |year =2001 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |page=314 |isbn=0-316-78753-1}}</ref><ref name="Deming">{{cite web |last=Deming |first=Mark |title=Big Black Biography |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p10143|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=March 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Touch and Go">{{cite web |title=Big Black: Info |publisher=[[Touch and Go Records]] |url=http://www.touchandgorecords.com/bands/band.php?id=34 |access-date=March 24, 2010}}</ref> Albini had become a fan of [[punk rock]] during his high school years in [[Missoula, Montana]], and taught himself to play [[bass guitar]] in the fall of 1979, his senior year, while recuperating from a badly broken leg resulting from being struck by a car while riding his motorcycle.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 313-314">Azerrad, pp. 313–314.</ref> Moving to [[Evanston, Illinois]] the following year to pursue a [[journalism]] degree and [[fine art]] [[academic minor|minor]] at Northwestern, Albini immersed himself in the fledgling [[Chicago]] punk scene and became a devoted fan of the [[post-punk]] band [[Naked Raygun]].<ref name="Azerrad, 314"/><ref name="Deming"/> He also [[Disc jockey|DJ]]'d for the campus radio station, from which he was repeatedly fired for playing loud and abrasive music during the morning time slot as well as not completing the required logs.<ref name="Azerrad, pp. 314–315">Azerrad, pp. 314–315.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Albini|first1=Steve|title=Steve Albini Interview - 2/5/16 - For WUSB Stony Brook |url=https://soundcloud.com/peterjaskkoo/steve-albini-interview-2516-for-wusb-stony-brook|publisher=WUSB}}</ref> He also wrote a controversial [[Column (newspaper)|column]] titled "Tired of Ugly Fat?" for the Chicago [[zine]] ''Matter'', publishing confrontational rants about the local music scene which polarized readers into either respecting or hating him.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, pp. 314–315"/>

[[File:Roland TR-606.jpg|right|thumb|A Roland TR-606 drum machine, the model Albini used to create Big Black's drum sound]]
Albini began playing in college bands, including a short-lived "arty [[New wave music|new wave]]" act called Stations that featured a [[drum machine]]. Seeing the advantage in a machine that could play incredibly fast without tiring, always kept a steady beat, and would follow commands exactly, he purchased a [[Roland TR-606]] drum machine and began writing what would become the first Big Black songs.<ref name="Deming"/><ref>Azerrad, p. 315.</ref> However, he was unable to find other musicians who could play the songs to his satisfaction, later stating in ''[[Forced Exposure]]'' that "I couldn't find anybody who didn't blow out of a pig's asshole."<ref>Azerrad, pp. 315-316.</ref> Instead, in the spring of 1981, he bought a [[guitar]], borrowed a four-track [[Multitrack recording|multitrack recorder]] from a friend in exchange for a case of beer, and spent his [[spring break]] week recording the ''[[Lungs (EP)|Lungs]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in his living room, handling the guitar, bass, and vocals by himself and programming the Roland TR-606 to provide the drum sound.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Touch and Go"/><ref name="Azerrad, 316">Azerrad, p. 316.</ref> Influenced by bands like [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Killing Joke]], and [[the Cure]], the EP is described by ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'' author [[Michael Azerrad]] as "cold, dark, and resolutely unlistenable", with the lyrics describing [[child abuse]]rs and other controversial topics, and Albini later regarded the effort as one of his few artistic regrets.<ref name="Azerrad, 316"/>

Albini named his new musical project Big Black, calling the moniker "just sort of a reduction of the concept of a large, scary, ominous figure. All the historical images of fear and all the things that kids are afraid of are all big and black, basically."<ref name="Azerrad, 316"/> He used the ''Lungs'' tape to try to enlist other musicians to the project, briefly recruiting [[Minor Threat]] guitarist [[Lyle Preslar]] who was attending Northwestern, but the two proved incompatible as musicians.<ref name="Azerrad, 316"/> Albini passed ''Lungs'' on to John Babbin of the small local label [[Ruthless Records (Chicago)|Ruthless Records]], who released 1,500 copies of the EP in December 1982 with random objects such as dollar bills, used [[condom]]s, photographs of [[Bruce Lee]], and bloody pieces of paper thrown into the insert.<ref name="Deming"/><ref>Azerrad, pp. 316–317.</ref>

===1983: Full lineup and ''Bulldozer''===
In early 1983 Albini met Naked Raygun singer [[Jeff Pezzati]] through mutual friends and convinced him to play bass guitar with Big Black. Pezzati recalled that Albini "knew a heck of a lot about, right from the start, how to release a record and get the word out that you have a record", and that "He jumped at the chance to have a band play his stuff."<ref>Azerrad, p. 317.</ref> The two practiced in Pezzati's basement, and one day Naked Raygun guitarist [[Santiago Durango]] came downstairs and asked to play along.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 317-318">Azerrad, pp. 317–318.</ref> The trio clicked as a unit, Durango's ability to rework arrangements and tweak sounds helping to refine Albini's song ideas. According to Albini, "He ended up being absolutely crucial to Big Black."<ref name="Azerrad, 317-318"/>

Albini "sorta conned" small local label Fever Records into financing the next Big Black EP, bringing in drummer Pat Byrne of [[Urge Overkill]] to play on the sessions as accompaniment to the drum machine, which they dubbed "Roland" for album credits.<ref name="Touch and Go"/><ref name="Azerrad, 318-319">Azerrad, pp. 318–319.</ref> Albini achieved a signature "clanky" sound with his guitar by using metal [[guitar pick]]s notched with sheet metal clips, creating the effect of two guitar picks at once.<ref name="Azerrad, 319">Azerrad, p. 319.</ref> The ''[[Bulldozer (EP)|Bulldozer]]'' EP was recorded with [[recording engineer|engineer]] [[Iain Burgess]] and released in December 1983, with the first two hundred copies packaged in a [[Hot-dip galvanizing|galvanized]] [[sheet metal]] sleeve in [[homage (arts)|homage]] to [[Public Image Ltd.]]'s ''[[Metal Box]]''.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Touch and Go"/><ref>Azerrad, pp. 318–321.</ref> Many of the EP's lyrics depicted scenarios drawn from Albini's midwest upbringing, such as "Cables", which described the slaughtering of cows at a Montana [[slaughterhouse|abattoir]], and "Pigeon Kill", about a rural [[Indiana]] town that dealt with an overpopulation of [[pigeon]]s by feeding them poisoned corn.<ref name="Azerrad, 320-321">Azerrad, pp. 320–321.</ref>

===1984: Touring and label signing===
Even with ''Bulldozer'' released, Big Black drew very small crowds in their native Chicago.<ref name="Azerrad, 322">Azerrad, p. 322.</ref> They began venturing outside of Illinois to play shows in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Detroit]], and [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]], transporting themselves and their equipment in a cramped car and sleeping on people's floors.<ref>Azerrad, pp. 321–322.</ref> Albini handled much of the band's logistics himself, setting up rehearsals, booking studio time, and arranging tours.<ref name="Azerrad, 322"/> With their reputation growing through small tours, he was able to set up a run of East Coast dates including performances in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Boston]] and at [[New York City]]'s [[Danceteria]], followed by a European tour on which they won acclaim in the [[United Kingdom]]'s music press.<ref name="Azerrad, 322"/> Big Black simultaneously found themselves gaining popularity in their hometown, but felt embittered that the same locals who had snubbed them just months before were suddenly interested now that they had built a reputation outside the city, and the band actually refused to play in Chicago for some time.<ref name="Azerrad, 322"/>

Part of Big Black's local unpopularity stemmed from Albini and the vitriol he regularly directed at Chicago's rock scene: by 1985, the [[Metro Chicago]] was the only club in the city that was booking punk rock shows and was also large enough to accommodate Big Black, but after performing there Albini badmouthed the club in an interview and found himself banned from it permanently.<ref name="Azerrad, 322"/> Compounding the problem were the band's aggressive, noise-driven sound and Albini's confrontational lyrics, which tested the tolerance of his white liberal audience by mercilessly satirizing [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[chauvinism]], and stereotypes of [[homosexuality]], sometimes using [[pejorative]]s like "darkie" and "[[Faggot (slang)|fag]]" to drive home the point; this led some listeners to consider him a [[bigotry|bigot]].<ref name="Azerrad, 324-326">Azerrad, pp. 324–326.</ref>

Looking for better distribution of their records, Big Black negotiated a deal with [[Homestead Records]].<ref name="Touch and Go"/><ref name="Azerrad, 326-327">Azerrad, pp. 326–327.</ref> [[Gerard Cosloy]], who had befriended Albini through writing for ''Matter'' and gone on to work at Homestead, negotiated an unorthodox deal for the band: Big Black merely licensed their recordings to Homestead for specific lengths of time, rather than the label retaining the rights to the recordings as was typical.<ref name="Azerrad, 326-327"/> Further, the band took no [[advance payment]]s, paid for their own recordings, and signed no contracts.<ref name="Azerrad, 326-327"/> Durango later remarked that "We came from a punk perspective — we did not want to get sucked into a corporate culture where basically you're signing a contract because you don't trust the other person to live up to their word. We had ideals, and that was one of our ideals."<ref name="Azerrad, 327">Azerrad, p. 327.</ref> The band members figured that if a record company were going to cheat them, they would be able to do so with or without a contract because the band could not afford to defend themselves.<ref name="Azerrad, 327"/>

Albini believed that Big Black had nothing to gain by adopting the usual corporate trappings of rock bands: "If you don't use contracts, you don't have any contracts to worry about. If you don't have a tour rider, you don't have a tour rider to argue about. If you don't have a booking agent, you don't have a booking agent to argue with."<ref name="Azerrad, 327"/> Handling the tour booking, equipment hauling, setup, and breakdown of shows themselves also meant that the band did not have to hire a booking agent or [[road crew]] with whom they would have to share profits.<ref name="Azerrad, 328">Azerrad, p. 328.</ref> The lack of a drummer also meant one less member to split profits with, and since there was no [[drum kit]] the band did not have to rent a tour van to fit all of their equipment.<ref name="Azerrad, 328"/> Thus Big Black was able to profit from most of their tours.<ref name="Azerrad, 328"/> They embarked on a 1984 national tour of the United States in preparation for their forthcoming Homestead EP, utilizing the close-knit network of independent rock bands to learn of cities and venues to play.<ref name="Azerrad, 328"/>

===1985–1986: ''Racer-X'' and ''Atomizer''===
In late 1984, following the recording of the ''[[Racer-X]]'' EP, Pezzati amicably left the band due to his increasingly demanding job, the need to devote time to his fiancée, and the increasing popularity and busy schedule of Naked Raygun, of which he was still a member.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 328-330">Azerrad, pp. 328–330</ref> Durango, meanwhile, opted to leave Naked Raygun to commit full-time to Big Black.<ref name="Deming"/> Pezzati was replaced by [[Dave Riley (musician)|Dave Riley]], who joined Big Black the week of ''Racer-X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release in April 1985.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 328-330"/> Riley had moved to Chicago in 1982 from Detroit, where he had worked at a studio where [[funk]] artists [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Sly Stone]] had recorded (he is credited as a recording engineer on [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]s ''[[Trombipulation]]'' and [[Funkadelic]]'s ''[[The Electric Spanking of War Babies]]'').<ref name="Grow">{{cite web |last=Grow |first=Kory |title=Dave Riley, Bassist for Noise Rockers Big Black, Dead at 59 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dave-riley-big-black-dead-at-59-931315/ |date=December 26, 2019 |access-date=March 8, 2020}}</ref> In Chicago he joined a band called Savage Beliefs, and his playing style impressed Albini and Durango, who invited him to join Big Black as they were recording the songs that would make up the band's first full-length album.<ref name="Grow"/>

Albini claimed to be aiming for a "big, massive, slick rock sound" with ''Racer-X'', which was less frantic than ''Bulldozer'', but ultimately felt that the EP was "too samey and monolithic."<ref>Azerrad, pp. 328–329.</ref> The band had already begun writing new songs by the time ''Racer-X'' was released, stating in the last sentence of the EP's [[liner notes]] that "The next one's gonna make you shit your pants."<ref name="Azerrad, 330">Azerrad, p. 330.</ref> Big Black's first [[LP album|LP]], 1986's ''[[Atomizer (album)|Atomizer]]'', found the band at their most musically developed and aggressive level yet.<ref name="Azerrad, 330"/> Riley's funk background brought a slightly greater sense of [[melody]] and danceability to the band, while Albini and Durango's guitar work was more violent than ever before.<ref name="Azerrad, 330"/> [[Michael Azerrad]] comments that "by this time Big Black had both refined the ideas first suggested on ''Lungs'' and exploded them into something much huger than anyone but Albini had ever imagined", while Mark Deming of [[Allmusic]] states that the album "upped the ante on the musical and lyrical ferocity of Big Black's previous body of work, an unrelenting assault of guitar sounds and imagined violence of all sorts."<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 330"/> Albini later remarked that "we just had a higher-than-average percentage of really good songs."<ref name="Azerrad, 330"/> The lyrics on ''Atomizer'' presented [[psychopathy|sociopaths]] committing evil acts that most people only sometimes contemplate: "Big Money" deals with a corrupt police officer, "Bazooka Joe" profiles a [[combat stress reaction|shell-shocked]] [[veteran]] who becomes a [[contract killing|contract killer]], "Stinking Drunk" describes a violent [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], and "Fists of Love" presents a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]].<ref name="Azerrad, 331">Azerrad, p. 331.</ref> One of the album's most controversial songs was "Jordan, Minnesota", about the 1983 scandal in [[Jordan, Minnesota]] that saw a large number of the rural town's adults indicted on charges of involvement in a huge child sex ring.<ref name="Azerrad, 331"/>

"Kerosene", one of ''Atomizer''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s standout tracks, is viewed by both Azerrad and Allmusic's Andy Kellman as the band's peak performance. Azerrad remarks on its "powerful rhythm ripped straight from [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and guitars that sound like shattering glass", while Kellman calls it "undeniably Big Black's brightest/bleakest moment, an epically roaming track that features an instantly memorable guitar intro, completely incapable of being accurately described by vocal imitation or physical gesture [...] It's Big Black's '[[Light My Fire]],' literally."<ref name="Azerrad, 331"/><ref name="Kellman Atomizer">{{cite web |last=Kellman |first=Andy |title=Review: ''Atomizer'' |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1833|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=March 20, 2010}}</ref> Riley explained that the song was about the effects of boredom in rural America: "There's only two things to do: Go blow up a whole load of stuff for fun, or have a lot of sex with the one girl in town who'll have sex with anyone. 'Kerosene' is about a guy who tries to ''combine'' the two pleasures."<ref name="Azerrad, 331"/>

''Atomizer'' was a polarizing record that was praised in the national press and became an underground success, surpassing the band's expectations by selling three thousand copies soon after its release.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 332">Azerrad, p. 332.</ref> Big Black secured a European distribution deal for their records through [[Blast First]], a label recommended to Albini by [[Sonic Youth]], and met enthusiastic responses to their shows on a 1986 European tour.<ref name="Azerrad, 334">Azerrad, p. 334.</ref>

The [[compilation album]] ''[[The Hammer Party]]'', combining ''Lungs'' and ''Bulldozer'', was also released through Homestead Records in 1986, but later that year Big Black had a falling out with the label and its distributor, Dutch East India Trading.<ref name="Touch and Go"/><ref name="Kellman The Hammer Party">{{cite web |last=Kellman |first=Andy |title=Review: ''The Hammer Party'' |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1834|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=March 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Azerrad, 335">Azerrad, p. 335.</ref> According to Albini, Dutch East India's accounting practices were "always fucked. They would do every sleazy, cheap trick to avoid paying you, like send you a check that wasn't signed or send you a check that had a different numeral and literal amount."<ref name="Azerrad, 335"/> Homestead then asked to make five hundred copies of a [[12-inch single]] of "Il Duce" for free distribution to radio stations. The band agreed on the condition that the single was not to be offered for sale, since the song had already been released as a [[Single (music)|7-inch single]] in 1985 and, according to Albini, "We didn't want our audience milked for extra money to buy an alternate format."<ref name="Azerrad, 335"/> A few weeks after the single's release, Albini began seeing copies for sale in record stores outside of Chicago. He soon found out that the 12-inch single was being sold both in the United States and abroad as a high-priced "collector's item". Though Homestead claimed not to be selling copies, Albini telephoned one of the label's salespeople posing as a record buyer and was told that they would sell him copies, but not in Chicago.<ref name="Azerrad, 335"/> As a result of the deception, Albini and Big Black severed ties with Homestead and Dutch East India.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 335"/> Though the band was receiving lucrative offers from major labels, they chose to remain independent and signed to [[Touch and Go Records]], Albini being good friends with label head Corey Rusk.<ref name="Deming"/><ref>Azerrad, pp. 335–337.</ref>

===1987: ''Headache'', ''Songs About Fucking'', and breakup===
Big Black's first release for Touch and Go was the ''[[Headache (EP)|Headache]]'' EP in spring 1987.<ref name="Touch and Go"/> The cover artwork for the limited original edition of the EP was a pair of forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic "body bag" to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 337">Azerrad, p. 337.</ref> A sticker on the EP's cover read "Not as good as ''Atomizer'', so don't get your hopes up, cheese!"<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 337"/> According to Durango, "We didn't want to sit there and screw people. If we felt it wasn't as good, then we should just be honest about it."<ref name="Azerrad, 337"/> Indeed, ''Headache'' recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on ''Atomizer'', showing signs that the band was lagging creatively.<ref>Azerrad, pp. 337–339.</ref> Durango later remarked that "I was feeling tapped out ideawise. At that point I think we had tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio."<ref name="Azerrad, 339">Azerrad, p. 339.</ref>

{{Quote box |quote=The members of Big Black have often been asked why we chose to break up (the end of the band having been announced well in advance) just when we were becoming quite popular.

Tensions were also mounting within the band. Albini did not drink alcohol, so Riley and Durango became drinking buddies on the road while Albini was doing interviews and handling the band's logistics.<ref name="Azerrad 338">Azerrad, p. 338.</ref> Riley, however, was drinking to excess, and his behavior ruined several of the band's performances.<ref name="Azerrad 338"/> During a key show at [[CBGB]], he drunkenly smashed the drum machine.<ref name="Azerrad 338"/> Albini also accused Riley of a number of other shortcomings including lateness to rehearsals, always needing rides, and "flashes of brilliance offset by flashes of belligerence."<ref name="Azerrad 338"/> However, though he made a number of threats, Albini never fired Riley.<ref name="Azerrad 338"/> Another problem facing the band was that Riley was now in college and both Albini and Durango had to keep day jobs, which limited Big Black's ability to tour.<ref name="Azerrad 338"/> When Durango announced that he intended to enter [[law school]] beginning in the fall semester of 1987, the band decided to keep going until he began school and then call it quits.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 339"/> Despite enjoying increased press, radio airplay, record sales, and concert fees, the band did not regret their decision and eschewed the idea of commercial success.<ref name="Azerrad, 340">Azerrad, p. 340.</ref> According to Riley, "Big Black was never about that. For Big Black to make any money, it wouldn't have been Big Black anymore."<ref name="Azerrad, 340"/><ref name="Grow"/> Being a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] band was also liberating, as the members no longer had to be concerned with the group's future.<ref name="Azerrad, 340"/> Albini wrote that he was happy to be breaking up the band before it grew too big:

<blockquote>
I am now quite happy to be breaking up. Things getting much too big and uncontrollable. All along we've wanted to keep our hands on everything, so nothing happened that we didn't want to. With international and multi-format/multi-territorial shit, that's proving elusive. I prefer to cut it off rather than have it turn into another Gross Rock Spectacle.<ref name="Azerrad, 341">Azerrad, p. 341.</ref>
</blockquote>

With their breakup announced well in advance, Big Black recorded their final album, ''[[Songs About Fucking]]'', half in London and half at Albini's home studio.<ref name="Deming"/> Their final tours began in June 1987, taking them to Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and across the United States.<ref name="Azerrad, 341"/> They performed at the [[Pukkelpop]] festival in [[Belgium]] with Sonic Youth on July 22, Albini's 25th birthday.<ref name="Azerrad, 341"/> At a sold-out show in London for 1,300 people, [[Bruce Gilbert]] and [[Graham Lewis]] of [[Wire (band)|Wire]] joined Big Black onstage to play an [[encore (concert)|encore]] of Wire's "[[Heartbeat (Wire song)|Heartbeat]]" (Big Black had released a [[cover version]] of the song as a single in conjunction with ''Headache'').<ref name="Azerrad, 341"/> Albini wrote of the experience that "If I die right now it will all have been worth it."<ref name="Azerrad, 341"/> In the United States the band played in [[San Francisco]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Boston]], [[New York City]], and Newport, Kentucky, concluding with their final performance on August 9, 1987, at the [[Georgetown Steam Plant]] in [[Seattle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jivetimerecords.com/northwest/big-black-at-the-georgetown-steamplant-poster/|title=BIG BLACK AT THE GEORGETOWN STEAM PLANT POSTER|date=December 16, 2017|website=Jive Time Records|access-date=September 20, 2020}}</ref> At the end of this show the band smashed their instruments onstage.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 341"/>

Following Big Black's breakup, Albini formed and fronted [[Rapeman]] from 1987 to 1989 and [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]] from 1992 onward.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Touch and Go"/> He also began work as a [[recording engineer]], working with artists such as [[Slint]], the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[the Breeders]], [[Pegboy]], [[Urge Overkill]], [[the Jesus Lizard]], [[the Wedding Present]], [[Superchunk]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Bush (British band)|Bush]], and [[Page and Plant]].<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 343-345">"Azerrad, pp. 343–345.</ref> Some of his most well-known recordings include the Pixies' ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' (1988), Nirvana's ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' (1993), Bush's ''[[Razorblade Suitcase]]'' (1996), and Page and Plant's ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'' (1998). In 1997 he opened his own [[recording studio]], [[Electrical Audio]], in Chicago.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Touch and Go"/><ref name="Azerrad, 343-345"/> Albini's recording style is characterized by the use of vintage [[microphone]]s placed strategically around the performance room, keeping vocals very low in the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]], and using few special effects.<ref name="Azerrad, 344">Azerrad, p. 344.</ref> He is also known for recording almost any artist who requests his services (usually at very low rates but deliberately charging high amounts to artists on major record labels), disliking being credited on the albums he works on (insisting on being credited as a recording engineer rather than a [[record producer|producer]], if at all), and refusing to take [[royalties]] for his work (calling them "an insult to the band").<ref name="Azerrad, 344"/><ref name="Heylin">{{cite book |last=Heylin |first=Clinton |author-link=Clinton Heylin |title=The Penguin Book of Rock & Roll Writing |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |year=1992 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/penguinbookofroc00heyl/page/410 410] |isbn=0-670-84559-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/penguinbookofroc00heyl/page/410 }}</ref>

Durango, meanwhile, continued to play music during his law school years, releasing two EPs on Touch and Go as [[Arsenal (American band)|Arsenal]] and recording with [[Boss Hog]].<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Touch and Go"/> He then became a practicing [[lawyer]], with clients including Touch and Go Records and [[Cynthia Plaster Caster]].<ref name="Deming"/> Riley recorded tracks with the groups Algebra Suicide, Bull, and [[Flour (band)|Flour]] before being incapacitated by a [[stroke]] in 1995, which was initially erroneously reported as a suicide attempt.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Grow"/> Having lost the ability to walk, he authored a [[blog]] about his experiences titled "Worthless Goddamn Cripple".<ref name="Grow"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Riley |first=Dave |author-link=Dave Riley (musician) |title=Worthless Goddamn Cripple |url=http://worthlesscripple.com/ |access-date=March 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227034010/http://worthlesscripple.com/ |archive-date=February 27, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2004 he participated in a musical project called Miasma of Funk, releasing the album ''Groove on the Mania!'', and in 2006 published the book ''Blurry and Disconnected: Tales of Sink-or-Swim Nihilism''.<ref name="Grow"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Miasma of Funk |publisher=Top Scrap Recordings |url=http://www.topscrap.com/starting_lineup/miasma/of_funk.html |access-date=March 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Riley |first=Dave |author-link=Dave Riley (musician) |title=Blurry and Disconnected: Tales of Sink-or-Swim Nihilism |publisher=Contortmedia |year=2006 |location=[[Warsaw, Illinois]] |isbn=0-9777353-0-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaEJw9GsYKYC}}</ref> Riley died December 24, 2019 at the age of 59, from [[squamous cell carcinoma]] that began in his throat and spread to his lungs.<ref name="Grow"/>

In 1992 Big Black's catalog reverted to Touch and Go Records, who re-released their entire discography and kept their records in print long after the band's breakup.<ref name="Deming"/> That October the label released the live album and video ''[[Pigpile]]'', recorded in [[London]] during the band's final tours, as well as the compilation album ''[[The Rich Man's Eight Track Tape]]'', which combined tracks from ''Atomizer'', ''Headache'', and the "[[Heartbeat (Wire song)#Big Black version|Heartbeat]]" single in [[compact disc]] format.<ref name="Touch and Go Pigpile">{{cite web |title=''Pigpile'' |publisher=[[Touch and Go Records]] |url=http://www.touchandgorecords.com/bands/album.php?id=132 |access-date=March 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Touch and Go 8 Track">{{cite web |title=''The Rich Man's Eight Track Tape'' |publisher=[[Touch and Go Records]] |url=http://www.touchandgorecords.com/bands/album.php?id=138 |access-date=March 26, 2010}}</ref> The re-released version of ''The Hammer Party'' was expanded to include the tracks from ''Racer-X''.<ref name="Kellman The Hammer Party"/>

==Style==
===Music===
Big Black's music challenged convention, pursuing an abrasive sound that was more aggressive than contemporary [[punk rock]]. Albini explained that the band strove for intensity, stating that their goal was to make "something that felt intense when we went through it, rather than something that had little coded ''indicators'' of intensity. [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] and stuff like that didn't really seem intense to me, it seemed comical to me. [[Hardcore punk]] didn't really seem intense most of the time — most of the time it just seemed childish. I guess that's how I would differentiate what we were doing from what other people were doing."<ref name="Azerrad, 320">Azerrad, p. 320.</ref> Both Albini and Riley described Big Black as a punk rock band.<ref name="Pigpile"/><ref name="Azerrad, 326">Azerrad, p. 326.</ref><ref name="Azerrad, 336">Azerrad, p. 336.</ref> [[AllMusic]] has associated their sound with both hardcore and [[post-punk]] and described them as influential to [[indie rock]]<ref name="Deming"/> as well as pioneers of [[noise rock]]<ref name="AllMusicNR">{{cite web|title=Noise Rock|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/noise-rock-ma0000004455|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 11, 2017}}</ref> and [[post-hardcore]].<ref name="Effigies">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/effigies-p23913/biography |title=Effigies – Biography |last=Huey|first=Steve |work=AllMusic |access-date=May 12, 2011}}</ref>

A major component of Big Black's music was the [[drum machine]]. Rather than attempt to make it emulate the sound of a normal [[drum kit]], the band chose to exploit the idiosyncrasies of its synthetic sounds.<ref name="Azerrad, 319"/> On many songs Albini programmed it to accent the first and third [[beat (music)|beats]] of the [[bar (music)|bar]], rather than the second and fourth beats typically accented in rock music.<ref name="Azerrad, 319"/> "The effect was a monolithic pummeling, an attack", says [[Michael Azerrad]], "their [[Groove (music)|groove]], normally the most human aspect of a rock band, became its most inhuman; it only made them sound more insidious, its relentlessness downright tyrannical."<ref name="Azerrad, 319"/> On tour, the sound engineers at many rock clubs were befuddled by the drum machine, afraid that it would not work with their sound system or would blow out their speakers, and the band would have to coerce the club owner or threaten to cancel the show in order to get them to put the drum machine through the [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitors]].<ref name="Azerrad, 332"/>

The band's guitar sound was also unconventional. Albini was determined to avoid the "standard rock stud guitar sound", and achieved a signature "clanky" sound by using metal [[guitar pick]]s notched with sheet metal snips; the notch causing the pick to hit each string twice, creating the effect of two simultaneous guitar picks.<ref name="Azerrad, 316"/><ref name="Azerrad, 319"/> Durango remarked: "I always thought that our guitar playing was not so much playing guitars, but assembling noises ''created'' by guitars."<ref name="Azerrad, 319"/> He and Albini respectively billed their guitars as "vroom" and "skinng" in the liner notes for ''Atomizer''.<ref name="Azerrad, 330"/> Mark Deming of [[Allmusic]] remarks that "The group's guitars alternately sliced like a machete and ground like a dentist's drill, creating a groundbreaking and monolithic dissonance in the process."<ref name="Deming"/>

Big Black's music was influenced by a number of genres and artists. Albini was a fan of punk rock bands including [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], the [[Ramones]], [[the Stooges]], and [[Naked Raygun]].<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 313-314"/> When Riley joined the band in 1985 he brought with him a [[funk]] background, having worked at a [[Detroit]] studio where [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Sly Stone]] had recorded.<ref name="Azerrad, 329-330">Azerrad, pp. 329–330.</ref> During their career Big Black recorded [[cover version]]s of songs from a number of styles including [[post-punk]], [[New wave music|new wave]], funk, [[hard rock]], [[synthpop]], and [[R&B]]; these included [[Rema-Rema]]'s "Rema-Rema", [[James Brown]]'s "[[The Payback]]",<ref name="Kellman Racer-X">{{cite web |last=Kellman |first=Andy |title=Review: ''Racer-X'' |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r164082|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=March 28, 2010}}</ref> [[Wire (band)|Wire]]'s "[[Heartbeat (Wire song)|Heartbeat]]",<ref name="Kellman Heartbeat">{{cite web |last=Kellman |first=Andy |title=Review: 'Heartbeat' |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r368799|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=March 28, 2010}}</ref> [[Cheap Trick]]'s "He's a Whore",<ref name="Kellman Songs About Fucking"/> [[Kraftwerk]]'s "[[Das Model|The Model]]",<ref name="Kellman Songs About Fucking"/> and the [[Mary Jane Girls]]' "[[In My House]]".<ref name="Kellman Racer-X"/><ref name="Kellman Pigpile video"/> The sound that Big Black forged for themselves, however, was wholly original: Azerrad remarks that "the band's music — jagged, brutal, loud, and nasty — was original to a downright confrontational degree. Big Black distilled years of post-punk and hardcore down to a sound resembling a singing saw blade mercillesly tearing through sheet metal. No one had made records that sounded so harsh."<ref name="Azerrad, 312">Azerrad, p. 312.</ref>

===Lyrics===
Big Black's songs explored the dark side of American culture in unforgiving detail, acknowledging no [[taboo]]s.<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 312-313">Azerrad, pp. 312–313.</ref> Albini's lyrics openly dealt with such topics as [[mutilation]], [[murder]], [[rape]], [[child abuse]], [[arson]], [[death by burning|immolation]], [[racism]], and [[misogyny]].<ref name="Deming"/> "That's just what was interesting to me as a postcollegiate bohemian", he later remarked. "We didn't have a manifesto. Nothing was off-limits; it's just that that's what came up most of the time."<ref name="Azerrad, 329">Azerrad, p. 329.</ref> Many of his songs told miniature short stories of [[psychopathy|sociopaths]] doing evil things that the average person might merely contemplate.<ref name="Azerrad, 331"/><ref name="Azerrad, 320"/> Some, such as "Cables", "Pigeon Kill", and "Jordan, Minnesota", were based on real events, or things that Albini had witnessed during his midwest upbringing.<ref name="Azerrad, 320-321"/><ref name="Azerrad, 331"/> He compared the stories to ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'', saying that "If you stumble across something like this, you think 'This can't be!' But it turns out to be true, and that makes it even wilder."<ref name="Azerrad, 320"/>

{{Quote box |quote=It seems preposterous now, but at the time, people seemed overly concerned about the literal meaning of our lyrics. I know we never discussed it amongst ourselves. Lyrics seemed a necessity, so we had them, but the subject matter was an extension of our interests — not part of a political or aesthetic battle plan. The lyrics were subject to change at whim once the subject had been decided on anyway. Anybody who thinks we overstepped the playground perimeter of lyrical decency (or that the public has any right to demand "social responsibility" from a goddamn punk rock band) is a pure mental dolt, and should step forward and put his tongue up my ass. What we sing about is none of your business anyway.<ref name="Pigpile"/><ref name="Azerrad, 326"/> |source=–[[Steve Albini]] |align=right |width=30% |salign=right}}
Albini's lyrics drew criticism for apparent racism and [[homophobia]]. Racism was a frequent theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time.<ref name="Azerrad, 324">Azerrad, p. 324.</ref> The word "darkie" appeared in the first line of the ''Lungs'' EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know."<ref name="Azerrad, 324"/> He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word "[[Faggot (slang)|fag]]": "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — [[Phonetics|phonetically]] — like the words '[[Puck (sports)|hockey puck]],' '[[mukluk]]s,' '[[gefilte fish]],' and 'Canada.{{' "}}<ref name="Azerrad, 325">Azerrad, p. 325.</ref> Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction:<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 324-326"/> "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak."<ref name="Azerrad, 325-325">Azerrad, pp. 324–325</ref>

Albini also emphasized that the songs' lyrics were not the focal point of Big Black, and that the vocals were only there out of necessity: "It seemed like, as instrumental music, it didn't have enough emotional intensity at times, so there would be vocals. But the vocals were not intended to be the center of attention — the interaction within the band and the chaotic nature of the music, that was the important part."<ref name="Azerrad, 329"/> However, he did enjoy testing the tolerance of the white liberal [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] in his audience and provoking reactions out of listeners, stating that one of the band's goals was "to have pointedly offensive records".<ref name="Azerrad, 326"/><ref name="Azerrad, 336"/><ref name="Azerrad, 324"/> Terri Sutton of ''Puncture'' magazine wrote that the band's stark presentation of evil, deep-seated human impulses bolstered their work against criticism: "The topics are so deliberately loaded that you can't criticize their 'art' without looking like some fucking [[puritan]]."<ref name="Azerrad, 331"/>

===Live performances===
Onstage, Big Black presented an intense spectacle to match their music. Albini would set off a brick of [[firecracker]]s onstage before the band played, a tradition he carried on from their earliest performances through their dissolution and revived for their 2006 reunion set, and would count in most songs by yelling "One, two, fuck you!"<ref name="reunion video"/><ref name="Azerrad 332-333">Azerrad, pp. 332–333.</ref> While playing, the band members would slam their hands against their steel [[Strings (music)|guitar strings]] so hard that they would draw blood, often needing to put [[adhesive bandage]]s on their fingers.<ref name="Azerrad, 332"/> Albini used a specially-made hip-slung [[guitar strap]] worn around his waist like a belt, and would "prowl the stage like a spindly gunslinger", according to Azerrad.<ref name="Azerrad, 333">Azerrad, p. 333.</ref> [[Gerard Cosloy]] recalls that "It looked like someone had plugged Steve into the amp [...] he was pretty scary to watch onstage."<ref name="Azerrad, 333"/>

During performances of "Jordan, Minnesota", the band would reach a point where they would prolong a discordant, creepy noise while Albini would perform an intense [[pantomime]] as though he were one of the children from the song's lyrics being [[rape]]d.<ref name="Azerrad, 333"/> "It was actually very disturbing to watch", says Durango, "It would really get people unsettled."<ref name="Azerrad, 333"/> The band would respond to [[heckler]]s with acidic comebacks or deliberately offensive jokes.<ref name="Azerrad, 333"/> Describing the intensity of a January 1987 Big Black performance in ''Forced Exposure'', [[Lydia Lunch]] remarked that "I was pulverized into near oblivion as wall after wall of frustration, heartache, hatred, death, disease, dis-use, disgust, mistrust, & maelstrom stormed the stage waging war with military precision insistently invading every open orifice with the strength of ten thousand bulls".<ref name="Azerrad, 340"/>

==Influence==
{{Quote box |quote=Musically, Big Black's insistent drum machine rhythms, abrasive textures, and obsessively repeated riffs provided a major part of the blueprint for so-called industrial rock. Their bracingly intense music aside, the saving grace of the band's often obnoxious approach was that it was thought-provoking. Big Black set a standard for freedom of expression and forthrightness that has been emulated to varying degrees ever since.<ref name="Azerrad, 313">Azerrad, p. 313.</ref> |source=–[[Michael Azerrad]] |align=right |width=30% |salign=right}}
Through their aggressive guitar playing and use of a drum machine, Big Black's music served as a precursor to [[industrial rock]].<ref name="Deming"/><ref name="Azerrad, 313"/> Aesthetically, the band's firmly-held ideals, staunch independence, insistence on creative control, and stark lyrical topics had a significant impact on the developing independent rock community.<ref name="Deming"/> "Big Black was a band that went where few bands dared to go (and where many felt bands shouldn't go)," writes Mark Deming, "and for good or ill their pervasive influence had a seismic impact on indie rock."<ref name="Deming"/> Albini summed up several of the band's core ideals in his notes to the ''[[Pigpile]]'' album:

<blockquote>
Organizationally, we were committed to a few basic principles: '''Treat everyone with as much respect as he deserves''' (and no more), '''Avoid people who appeal to our vanity or ambition''' (they always have an angle), '''Operate as much as possible apart from the "music scene"''' (which was never our stomping ground), and '''Take no shit from anyone in the process'''.<ref name="Pigpile"/><ref name="Azerrad, 313"/>
