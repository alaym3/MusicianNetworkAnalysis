'''Kyle Allen''' (born March 8, 1996) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[Washington Football Team]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). A native of [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], he played high school football at [[Desert Mountain High School|Desert Mountain]] and was among the top football players of his class. He played [[college football]] at [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] before transferring to [[Houston Cougars football|Houston]] in 2016.

Allen signed with the [[Carolina Panthers]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] following graduation in 2018. That same year, he started the final game of the season following injuries to both [[Cam Newton]] and [[Taylor Heinicke]], as well as for the majority of the 2019 season after Newton suffered another injury. He was traded to Washington in 2020 and started four games for them before breaking his ankle and missing the rest of the season.

Against [[2015 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], Allen said he suffered an AC sprain in his throwing shoulder but told the coaching staff he was well enough to face Ole Miss.
