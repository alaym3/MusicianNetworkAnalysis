'''Kate Marie Nash''' (born 6 July 1987) is an English singer, songwriter, musician, and actress.

Nash launched her music career in 2005. Her 2007 single "[[Foundations (song)|Foundations]]" became a hit and brought her to public attention in the UK. Her debut album, ''[[Made of Bricks]]'', peaked at No. 1 in the UK and was a moderate international success. Nash subsequently won the award for [[Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist|Best British Female Artist]] at the [[2008 Brit Awards]]. Her second studio album, ''[[My Best Friend Is You]]'', was released in 2010 and reached the top 10 in the UK and Germany. After her departure from a major label, Nash self-released her third studio album, ''[[Girl Talk (Kate Nash album)|Girl Talk]]'', in 2013, but it failed to match the commercial success of her previous records. Her fourth and most recent studio album, ''[[Yesterday Was Forever]]'', was also released independently in 2018, funded by her fans via a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.

Aside from music, Nash has starred in films such as the drama ''[[Greetings from Tim Buckley]]'' (2012), the comedy ''[[Powder Room (film)|Powder Room]]'' (2013), and the comedy-drama ''[[Syrup (film)|Syrup]]'' (2013).  She played Rhonda "Britannica" Richardson in the [[Netflix]] comedy-drama series ''[[GLOW (TV series)|GLOW]]'' (2017–2019). She is also a [[feminism|feminist]] activist who campaigns against gender inequality.

==Career==
===2005–08: Career beginnings and ''Made of Bricks''===
[[File:KateNash.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nash performing in 2007]]
Nash embarked on a musical career in 2005, when she started recording after falling down the stairs and breaking her foot, which left her homebound.<ref name="Kate Nash's fall to fame"/> She started performing live, holding her first shows in pubs, at [[open mic]] nights, and an anti-folk festival in [[Brighton]].<ref name="moshimoshimusic.com"/> After several gigs, she uploaded her music to [[MySpace]] where she secured a [[Talent manager|manager]] and found exposure thanks to support from [[Lily Allen]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|title=Full Exposure|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/01/14/full-exposure|date=7 January 2008|work=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=15 January 2014}}</ref> Her debut [[Single (music)|single]], featuring songs "Caroline's a Victim" and "Birds", was recorded and produced in [[Iceland]] by [[Valgeir Sigurðsson]], and released through [[Moshi Moshi Records]] in February 2007. The release was limited to 2,000 copies and available only on [[7-inch vinyl]]. Due to demand, another 1,000 copies were made and these also sold out. CD promo copies were produced for distribution to the press and DJs and are occasionally available for sale. The [[music video]] for "Caroline's a Victim" was directed by Kinga Burza and received airplay on [[MTV2]]. The song was then included on the CD ''Moshi Moshi Singles Compilation'' and the single's [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], "Birds", later featured on Nash's debut album. Both tracks have also been released on [[Online music store|digital music platforms]].

In April 2007, Nash was signed to the [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] offshoot [[Fiction Records]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1814726|title=You couldn't make it up: Kate Nash signs with Fiction|last=Diver|first=Mike|date=30 March 2007|publisher=[[Drowned in Sound]]|access-date=16 August 2016|archive-date=9 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709015834/http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1814726|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the following month made her official TV performance debut on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''. Her second single, "[[Foundations (song)|Foundations]]", which she co-wrote with producer [[Paul Epworth]], was released by Fiction on 18 June 2007 and reached number two in the official [[UK Singles Chart]]. Following this success, the label announced plans to bring forward the release of Nash's debut album ''[[Made of Bricks]]'' to 6 August 2007. Produced by Paul Epworth, the album included many of the tracks she had been performing during her two nationwide tours. ''Made of Bricks'' was leaked to [[Peer-to-peer|filesharing networks]] a few days before its official commercial release and subsequently received mixed reviews; ''[[The Independent]]'' described it as being in "pole position for worst album of the year", while a [[BBC]] review called it "an album of surprising verve and variety".<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The Independent]] |title=Reviews: Album – Kate Nash |url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/reviews/article2849635.ece |date=17 August 2007 |access-date=17 August 2007 |location=London |first=Andy |last=Gill |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165408/http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/reviews/article2849635.ece |archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tagoe|first=Roman|title=Kate Nash Made Of Bricks Review|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/nbvr|website=BBC Music|access-date=21 November 2014}}</ref> It proved, however, to be commercially successful when it entered and peaked on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number 1, and stayed in the chart for over forty consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Albums Chart Top 100: 12 August 2007 – 18 August 2007 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/20070812/7502/ |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=23 December 2019}}</ref>

During mid-2007, Nash performed at numerous festivals, including the [[Wireless Festival]], [[Bestival]], [[Electric Gardens]], [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[Latitude Festival|Latitude]], [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading and Leeds]], [[Oxegen]] and [[T in the Park]]. Throughout late 2007 and early 2008, she released three more singles from ''Made of Bricks''. "[[Mouthwash (song)|Mouthwash]]" and "[[Pumpkin Soup]]" both made the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. Although her fifth single "[[Merry Happy]]" didn't chart well in the UK, the song enjoyed minor success in other countries, including the United States and Canada. ''Made of Bricks'' peaked at number 36 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/kate-nash/chart-history/TLP/song/559859 |title=Kate Nash Made Of Bricks Chart History |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=23 December 2019}}</ref> It would later be [[Music recording certification|certified]] Platinum in the UK and Gold in Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/award/10779-3272-2 |title=Award: Kate Nash - Made Of Bricks |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |access-date=23 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musikindustrie.de/nc/datenbank/ |title=Gold-/Platin-Datenbank |publisher=[[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] |language=de |access-date=23 December 2019}}</ref> In February 2008, Nash was honoured with the [[Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist|Best British Female Solo Artist]] award at the [[2008 Brit Awards]].<ref name="BBC News 2008">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7187992.stm|title=Brit Awards 2008: The winners|date=20 February 2008|publisher=BBC News|access-date=4 June 2009}}</ref> She also won the [[Q Awards|Q Award]] for Breakthrough Artist and the [[NME Awards|NME Award]] for Best Solo Artist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7033815.stm |title=Winners in full: Q Awards 2007 |date=28 October 2007 |publisher=BBC |access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/nme-awards-61-1321576 |title=Shockwaves NME Awards 2008: Winners' list |date=29 February 2008 |publisher=NME |access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref> Nash embarked on her first tour in Australia and the US in 2008 and opened the [[Glastonbury Festival 2008|2008]] [[Glastonbury Festival]].
