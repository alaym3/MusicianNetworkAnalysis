==Career==
Based in [[Albion, Michigan]], The War and Treaty was formed in 2014. In 2016, Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount released the duet album ''Love Affair'' as Trotter & Blount.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blackandmarriedwithkids.com/2013/06/power-couple-michael-tanya-trotter-blount/|title=Power Couple: Michael & Tanya Trotter (Blount)|work=Black and Married With Kids|first=Christine|last=St. Vil|date=13 June 2013|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> In the same year, the duo released the single "Hi Ho" as The War and Treaty. "Hi Ho" was described by ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' writer Chris Estey as 'the break out soul hit'. In 2017, The War and Treaty released the EP ''Down to the River'', described as a mix of 'blues, gospel, soul, bluegrass, country' and heralded by Estey as 'a splendidly made immediate classic about conflict and redemption'.<ref name="Soul Bounce EP">{{cite web|url=http://www.soulbounce.com/2017/07/the-war-and-treaty-down-to-the-river-video/|title=The War & Treaty "Down To The River" A Sight To Behold|work=Soul Bounce|date= July 17, 2017|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref><ref name="Paste">{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/07/the-war-and-treaty-down-to-the-rivermp4.html|title=The War & Treaty "Down To The River" A Sight To Behold|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|first=Chris |last=Estey|date= July 17, 2017|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> Estey describes 'in songs about personal turmoil and the dread at the end of time, every kind of fear and joy is addressed through gut-stirring and feet-moving anthems like "Hit Dawg Will Holla", "Set My Soul On Fire", and the title track. Yet the two can sensually help heal the wounds from those confessional blasts with a sweet ballad like "Till The Mornin’" — they truly live up to the dynamic tension of their moniker.'<ref name="Paste"/>

In 2018, ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' reported The War and Treaty's debut album ''[[Healing Tide]]'' is due for release on August 10, 2018, describing the lead single as a 'joyfully relentless title track, reminiscent of classic [[Ike and Tina Turner]] rock-infused soul'.<ref name="RS"/>

On September 25, 2020, The War and Treaty released their sophomore studio album, ''Hearts Town'', on [[Rounder Records]]. On April 18, 2021 they joined [[Dierks Bentley]] for a performance of [[U2]]'s "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" for the 56th [[Academy of Country Music Awards]].<ref>http://www.cmt.com/news/1832840/see-all-the-performers-and-presenters-for-the-2021-academy-of-country-music-awards/</ref>
