'''Inner Circle''', also known as '''The Inner Circle Band''' or '''The Bad Boys of Reggae''',<!-- This article is written is British English, which uses plural verbs when referring to rock bands. Please see WP:ENGVAR for more info. --> are a Jamaican [[reggae]] band formed in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] in 1968. The band first backed [[The Chosen Few (reggae group)|The Chosen Few]] in the early 1970s before joining with successful solo artist [[Jacob Miller (musician)|Jacob Miller]] and releasing a string of records. This era of the band ended with Miller's death in a car crash in 1980.

The group reformed in 1986. During this period, they released several international hit singles, including "[[Sweat (A La La La La Long)]]" and "[[Bad Boys (Inner Circle song)|Bad Boys]]," the theme from the American television show ''[[Cops (TV program)|Cops]]''. The group continued to record and tour thereafter.

Brothers Ian and Roger Lewis have remained the group's consistent members, playing bass and guitar, respectively. Other long-term members include keyboardist Bernard "Touter" Harvey, a member since 1973, and drummer Lancelot Hall, who joined during their 1986 reformation. The band's lineup is completed by singer Trevor "Skatta" Bonnick and lead guitarist Andre Philips.

==Career==

===Early history (1968-1974)===
Inner Circle was formed in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1968, by the [[sibling|brothers]] Ian Lewis and Roger Lewis with then 12-year-old Stephen "Cat" Coore and Michael Cooper.<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2002) ''Reggae & Caribbean Music'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}, p. 121-4, 442</ref> They appeared on record in 1970, backing [[The Chosen Few (reggae group)|The Chosen Few]] on the [[Derrick Harriott]]-produced single "Why Can't I Touch You", with the Inner Circle Band credited with the instrumental version on the B-side. This was one of several singles on which they backed the Chosen Few.<ref name="Thompson" /> In 1970 the band was expanded when they were joined by drummer William Stewart, percussionist Irvin "Carrot" Jarrett, and singer William "[[Bunny Rugs]]" Clarke.<ref name="Thompson" /> The band played on [[Eric Donaldson]]'s hit single "Cherry Oh Baby" and recorded their own version as "Red Cherry".<ref name="Thompson" />

Jarrett left the band in 1972, with singer Clarke leaving the following year when he moved to New York.<ref name="Thompson" /> Clarke's replacement was Milton "Prilly" Hamilton, but this line-up was short-lived as the band split in two with Coore, Cooper, and Hamilton leaving to form [[Third World (band)|Third World]] in 1973.<ref name="Thompson" /> Coore and Cooper were then students of the University of the West Indies, studying for various degrees{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and were soon joined in Third World by fellow Inner Circle departees Clarke and Jarrett. Meanwhile, Inner Circle re-tooled the lineup by recruiting keyboard players Charles Farquharson and Bernard Harvey (aka "Touter"), as well as drummer Calvin McKenzie as a replacement for Stewart (who would also go on to play with Third World).<ref name="Thompson" /> The band played the hotel and club circuit in Kingston, playing a mixture of reggae, pop and soul hits, and released their first album, ''Dread Reggae Hits'', in 1973 on Ian Lewis's Top Ranking label.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Lane">Lane, Sarah (1980) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=3SQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT26&lpg=PT26&dq=%22inner+circle%22+reggae&source=bl&ots=R-946hBIno&sig=XVLzY5Y0kGAswp1JqtKi9GLyEww&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Jd5MUKcUycrQBZ3LgNAN&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22inner%20circle%22%20reggae&f=false Florida Challenge for Jamaicans: Top Ranking Sounds Struggling for U.S. Recognition]", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 6 December 1980, p. 27, retrieved 9 September 2012</ref>

===The Jacob Miller years===
After recording with singer Funky Brown, they recruited [[Jacob Miller (musician)|Jacob Miller]] as a permanent vocalist (although he continued to record as a solo artist), and had a hit single with a version of [[The Stylistics]]' "You Make Me Feel Brand New".<ref name="Thompson" /> Some of Miller's work with the band was credited to Miller alone, including the "Tenement Yard" single.<ref name="Thompson" /> The band was signed by [[Capitol Records]], who issued the albums ''Reggae Thing'' (1976) and ''Ready for the World'' (1977).<ref name="Thompson" /> They toured the United States with American guitarist, Ed Elizalde. In 1978 they moved on to [[Island Records]] who released the ''Everything Is Great'' album in 1978, which included the UK hit singles "Everything Is Great" and "Stop Breaking My Heart", and ''New Age Music'' the following year.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The band was joined by New York [[session guitarist]] Joe Ortiz, dubbed 'Gitzy' by the band; who added the first touches of hard rock, jazz, and blues to the group and to Reggae in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Ortiz recorded at [[Compass Point Studios]] for the ''Everything Is Great'' album on Island Records, and later joined the group for their European tour in 1978–1980. He was also the lead guitarist on the title track 'New Age Music' on the album of the same name. Lester Adderley joined the group for the ''New Age Music'' album on guitar. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Also released in the late 1970s were two dub albums based on Miller's solo albums ''Killer Miller'' and ''Wanted'' but credited to Inner Circle.<ref name="Thompson" /> The band gained further exposure via their performance in the film ''[[Rockers (1978 film)|Rockers]]'', playing a hotel house band.<ref name="Thompson" /> At his peak in the 1970s, only [[Bob Marley]] was more popular in Jamaica than Miller, and as a live act, nobody equalled their popularity.<ref name="Barrow">Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) ''The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd ed.'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-329-4}}, p. 200, 242</ref>

Miller's death in a car crash on 23 March 1980 led the band to split up, with the Lewis Brothers and Touter Harvey moving to Miami, where they opened a studio in a warehouse, later opening their own Circle House recording studio, and the band has been based in Miami since then. After Miller's death in 1980, the band had one more American tour, inviting Norman Grant from the Twinkle Brothers for vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reggaelicious.pbworks.com/w/page/8800240/Twinkle%20Brothers |title=Reggaepedia / Twinkle Brothers |publisher=Reggaelicious.pbworks.com |access-date=9 March 2014}}</ref>

===Reformation and US success===
In 1981, with Bay Area lead guitarist, Mark Castro, they recorded the album ''Something So Good''. Due to the loss of Jacob Miller, the members asked Mark Castro to help them find a new vocalist. Mark brought Rick Hunt to the band. "Something So Good" includes the memorable signature lead guitar solos that only Mark Castro can produce, especially When a Man Loves a Woman and World 2000."Something So Good" was released in 1982. They reformed in 1986 with the Lewis Brothers and Harvey joined by singer [[Calton Coffie]] and drummer Lancelot Hall, and this line-up released the ''Black Roses'' album (released in 1986 on [[RAS Records]]).<ref name="Thompson" /> The band's next album, ''One Way'' in 1987, included one of their biggest hits, "[[Bad Boys (Inner Circle song)|Bad Boys]]", which was re-recorded for their 1989 album ''Identified'' and became the theme music for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox TV]] series ''[[Cops (TV program)|Cops]]'' that year.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Walker">Walker, Klive (2005) ''Dubwise'', Insomniac Press, {{ISBN|978-1894663960}}, p. 203</ref> California guitarist Dave Gonzales, by Mark Castro's recommendation, joined the band for a tour in 1989.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} "Bad Boys" was reissued as a single in 1990 and charted in several countries in Europe, but it was its 1993 re-release in the United States that achieved the greatest success.<ref name="Walker" /> The 1992 album ''Bad to the Bone'' was picked up by [[Atlantic Records]] and reissued as ''Bad Boys'' in 1993 to capitalize on the success of the single.<ref name="Thompson" /> It sold more than half a million copies in the United States and more than four million worldwide.<ref name="Benarde">Benarde, Scott (1993), "Reggae in music's inner circle: Boys of 'COPS' TV theme start to make it big", ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'', 16 December 1993, p. 14</ref> The band received a [[Grammy Award]] in 1993 for 'Best Reggae Album by Duo or Group' for ''Bad Boys'' and the album also spawned the international hit single "[[Sweat (A La La La La Long)]]", which was a #3 hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and topped the chart in 10 countries, selling over a million copies in Europe, while "Bad Boys" peaked at #52.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book
