'''Stuart Daniel Baker''' (November 7, 1954), better known by his stage name '''Unknown Hinson''', is an American singer, musician, songwriter, comedian, and actor.<ref>{{cite web |title= Squidbillies Characters  |url= http://www.adultswim.com/shows/squidbillies/indexpage.html#characters |publisher = AdultSwim.com |access-date= 2009-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= It's good to be King: Unknown Hinson is a legend of his own making  |url= http://www.thedailytimes.com/article/20080815/ENT/20211794 |publisher = TheDailyTimes.Com |access-date= 2008-08-14}}</ref>

==Origins==
Stuart Daniel Baker, a music teacher and studio musician from [[Albemarle, North Carolina]], created his alter-ego for ''The Wild Wild South'', a Charlotte-area public-access program that featured comedy sketches and concert footage. Baker and co-star Don Swan played the characters of Unknown Hinson and Rebel Helms, respectively. After Swan's death in 1995, Baker created ''The Unknown Hinson Show'', a direct spin-off of ''The Wild Wild South''. ''The Unknown Hinson Show'' won [[Creative Loafing|Creative Loafing Charlotte's]] "Best Of" poll for Best Public-Access Television Show four years in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainx.com/ae/1999/1027unknown.php |title=Into the Unknown &#124; Asheville Arts and Entertainment &#124; Mountain Xpress |publisher=Mountainx.com |access-date=2011-08-13}}</ref> After the series ended, Baker continued in his role as Unknown Hinson, performing live concerts and releasing several recordings.

==Music==

===Live performer===
Hinson has shared the stage with many notable [[rockabilly]], [[country music|country]], and [[psychobilly]] acts such as [[The Reverend Horton Heat]], [[Marty Stuart]], [[Hank III]], and [[Ed King]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Hank III]], grandson of [[Hank Williams]], has Hinson's face tattooed on his biceps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/inside-the-heathen-mind-of-hank-iii/Content?oid=929012 | title=Inside the Heathen Mind of Hank III: An interview with country music's self-exiled prince |publisher=[[Boise Weekly]] | date=2006-08-09| access-date=2015-11-18}}</ref>
In late 2008, working under his real name of Stuart Baker, Hinson was hired to play bass as well as lead guitar in Billy Bob Thornton's band The Boxmasters. For this  gig, Baker appears without the familiar Unknown Hinson wardrobe and makeup, instead appearing in a vintage '60s suit, white shirt, and black pencil tie. His manager and booking agent was his wife, Margo Baker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/charlotte/obituary.aspx?pid=163309087#fbLoggedOut |title=Margo Elizabeth Cogan Baker Obituary: View Margo Baker's Obituary by Charlotte Observer |publisher=[[Legacy.com]] |access-date=2013-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/unknown-hinson |title=Unknown Hinson: Information from |publisher=[[Answers.com]] |access-date=2013-09-04}}</ref>

According to a November 10, 2012, post on his Facebook page, Hinson decided to quit touring after 17 years. His last three shows were [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], on November 17 in [[Covington, Kentucky]]. He cited rising costs and indicated his plans to find something new to do. After the death of his wife, Margo Baker, Unknown Hinson resumed touring again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unknownhinson.com |title=Home |publisher=Unknown Hinson |access-date=2013-09-04}}</ref>

On June 3, 2020, Baker announced on his Facebook page that he wouldn't be playing any more shows.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hinson|first=Unknown|date=June 3, 2020|title=My dear friends, Unfortunately I don't...|url=https://www.facebook.com/Officialunknownhinsonstuartbaker/photos/a.250536291967520/1159941584360315/?type=3&theater|publisher=Facebook.com}}</ref> He wrote:
{{blockquote|"My dear friends,
Unfortunately I don’t think I’ll be playing anymore Shows. My hands are absolutely shot with Osteoarthritis. I love you all and I am grateful to you for supporting me for 50 plus years.
God bless you,
-Stuart Baker/Unknown Hinson"}}

===Recording artist===
Unknown Hinson writes his own music, performs live, and produces all of his own recordings.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} His music often parodies the dark elements of today's country and redneck culture. In early 2009, Hinson's "Torture Town" won in The 8th Annual Independent Music Awards and Vox Pop vote for Best Alternative Country Song "Torture Town".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Dolly Parton controversy and fallout===
On August 13, 2020, Hinson received backlash after posting controversial remarks about [[Dolly Parton]], calling her a "bimbo" and "slut" on his Facebook page in response to a recent news article concerning Parton's support of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement. Not long after this post, the Facebook page went offline, but returned on the following day with the posts concerning Parton removed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facebook Post About Dolly Parton|url=https://www.facebook.com/jay.maynard.562/posts/1424179344436309|access-date=August 13, 2020|website=[[Facebook]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Enis|first=Eli|date=August 13, 2020|title=Dolly Parton Backs Black Lives Matter: "Do We Think Our Little White Asses Are the Only Ones That Matter?"|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/08/dolly-parton-black-lives-matter-writing-will-interview/|access-date=August 13, 2020|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]}}</ref>  Hinson subsequently posted a response to those who were upset, saying “Leave Liberals”, calling them “UN-AMERICAN”, stating that they “bow down to the ALL-KNOWING-MINORITY”, and telling them to have fun “forsaking your own race, culture, and heritage.”<ref>{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Andrew|title= Unknown Hinson, 'Squidbillies' Star, Goes on Tirade About Dolly Parton's Black Lives Matter Support |url= https://popculture.com/country-music/news/unknown-hinson-squidbillies-star-tirade-dolly-parton-black-lives-matter-support//|date=August 19, 2020|access-date=August 19, 2020|website=Pop Culture}}</ref>

[[Reverend Musical Instruments|Reverend Guitars]] of Ohio abruptly stopped marketing their Stuart Baker signature series guitars on August 14, 2020 and posted, "we are no longer associated with Unknown Hinson. We have stopped production on his guitars and we have removed him from our website."<ref name="clodfelter">{{Cite web|last=Clodfelter|first=Tim|date=14 August 2020|title=Unknown Hinson in hot water over Dolly Parton comments|url=https://journalnow.com/entertainment/unknown-hinson-in-hot-water-over-dolly-parton-comments/article_31259b90-de62-11ea-8220-576201cd4789.html|access-date=2020-09-01|website=Winston-Salem Journal|language=en}}</ref> Many Adult Swim fans began urging Adult Swim to fire Baker the following day.

==Voice acting==
Hinson, credited as Baker, provided the voice of Early Cuyler, a balding hillbilly squid from [[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]], on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night [[Adult Swim]] program ''[[Squidbillies]]''. After 15 years voicing Early Cuyler on the show [[Squidbillies]], Baker was cut from production for extremely offensive and derogatory social media posts regarding an article in which Dolly Parton showed her support for the Black Lives Matter movement.<ref name="yasharoff" />
