== History ==

=== ''All Work and No Play'' and ''Relient K'' (1998–2000) ===

After Relient K was founded by [[Matt Thiessen]], [[Matt Hoopes]] and [[Brian Pittman]] in 1998,<ref>{{cite web|last=Steve|first=Huey|title=allmusic ((( Relient K > Biography )))|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p425426/biography|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=August 11, 2008}}</ref> Todd Frascone joined for a short time in 1998 as a drummer. However, Frascone left the band after recording the [[demo (music)|demo]] ''[[All Work & No Play]]''. The demo was recorded by [[Mark Lee Townsend]], the former live guitar player for [[dc Talk]]. Townsend had met the band members because his daughter, Danielle, was friends with the band. Danielle eventually married guitarist Matt Hoopes.<ref name="Special K">{{cite web|title=The Real Special K |url=http://www.crosswalk.com/culture/music/the-real-special-k-1302673.html|access-date=November 6, 2011}}</ref>

''All Work & No Play'' caught the attention of [[dc Talk]]'s [[Toby McKeehan]] (tobyMac), who later signed the band to his label, [[Gotee Records]]. With the label Relient K released its debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[2000 A.D.D.]]'' in 2000, with Stephen Cushman on drums. Soon after, the band released ''[[Relient K (album)|Relient K]]'', the group's first full-length CD. It was distinctly [[Christian rock]] and featured lyrics with a wide range of pop-culture references.<ref name="Powell_Fe">{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark Allan |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |year=2002 |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |location=[[Peabody, Massachusetts]] |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |edition=First printing |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/750 750–751] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/750 }}</ref> Cushman left later that year to join the [[Christian metal]] band [[Narcissus (band)|Narcissus]]. Brett Schoneman of Christian rock band [[Philmore]] filled in temporarily,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-xB4vCGlyE Relient K - Hello McFly] at [[YouTube]]{{unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJfiEnWw0IQ Relient K - Marilyn Manson Ate My Girlfriend] at YouTube{{unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSE8GTrNNX4 Relient K - Charles In Charge] at YouTube{{unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}</ref> followed by [[Jared Byers]], drummer of the Christian rock band [[Bleach (American band)|Bleach]], until [[Dave Douglas (drummer)|Dave Douglas]] joined in December 2000.<ref name="Board Message"/>

In an interview, Matt Thiessen said that when the band started, he was the only one who sang, but he knew Matt Hoopes could sing as well. Hoopes was reluctant, but Thiessen said he "got it out of him". As a result, Hoopes became the primary back-up vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Relient K - Interview|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=93263|access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

=== ''The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek'' (2001–02) ===

The band released its second album, ''[[The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek]]'', in 2001. Though there were still plenty of pop-culture references on this album,<ref name="Powell_Fe"/> it contained many more softer songs and slightly lighter guitars.<ref name="amazon anatomy">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005NNE6 Amazon.com: The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek: Relient K: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{failed verification|date=January 2011}}</ref> The band would continue chords through tracks in order to fluidly transition in between songs, a trend that continued on the group's later albums.<ref name="amazon anatomy" />

''Anatomy'' landed them in the Christian rock limelight, and Relient K was offered a clothing deal with [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] in 2001.<ref name="Powell_Fe"/> [[Gotee]], the band's label, accepted the offer on Relient K's behalf; Pittman recalls, "The choice was never really given to us. The label made the choice."<ref>[http://www.tollbooth.org/2001/features/relientk.html Relient K - a Feature of The Phantom Tollbooth<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{self-published inline|date=January 2011}}</ref> After significant pressure from [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] organizations such as [[Focus on the Family]], Gotee backed out of the contract.

Relient K was then asked to do a rendition of the popular ''[[VeggieTales]]'' song "[[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything (song)|The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything]]" for the 2002 feature length ''VeggieTales'' movie ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]''. The song was released on three different albums, two in single form. The first version also included Relient K's "Breakdown" being sung by [[Larry the Cucumber]]. There was also a promotional version which included the original version of "Breakdown". A cut-down version (missing the bridge) was included on the Christian rock compilation ''[[Veggie Rocks!]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Forefront Records|title='Veggie Rocks!': This is VeggieTales?|url=http://www.cbn.com/entertainment/music/veggie_rocks.aspx|publisher=CBN.com|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> This song mixes the sounds of ''The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek'', and the band's third album, ''Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=== ''Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do'' (2003) ===

In 2003, Relient K released ''[[Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do]]''. The album had multiple covers of different colors, each depicting a vehicle in some kind of wreck. As pop-culture references became less specific, sound and vocals became far more defined.<ref name="amazon left">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000654YZ6 Amazon.com: Two Lefts Don't Make a Right... But Three Do: Relient K: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{failed verification|nothing about pop culture references or definition of vocals|date=January 2011}}</ref> ''Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do'' (often called ''Two Lefts'' by fans) combined the soft, meaningful songs of ''The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek'' and threw in fast-paced songs with deep lyrics.<ref name="amazon left" /> It was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in the category of "[[Best Rock Gospel Album]]"<ref name="Grammy03"/> and won the [[Dove Award]] for "Modern Rock Album of the Year" in 2004.<ref name="DOVE04"/>

During this time, Relient K also released a limited edition red [[gramophone record|vinyl]] [[Extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[The Vinyl Countdown]]'', only released in one printing. The EP included two versions of the song, "Five Iron Frenzy is Either Dead or Dying."  The album was dedicated to Jesse Alkire, contest winner and friend of Matthew Thiessen, who inspired the song "The Vinyl Countdown."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/news/July03.asp |title = Music News: July 2003 |access-date =March 26, 2007 |date = July 24, 2003 |publisher = Jesus Freak Hideout}}</ref>

Since ''Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do'' was released in March 2003, Relient K released a bonus disc for Christmas, entitled ''[[Deck the Halls, Bruise Your Hand]]''. The album was packaged with ''Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do'' from November 2003 to December 2003.<ref name="amazon left"/>

=== ''Mmhmm'' (2004–06) ===

[[File:Matt T and Matt H.jpg|thumb|Matt Thiessen (left) and Matt Hoopes (right), two of the band's founders, performing at Purple Door in 2005.]]
The group released its fourth album, ''[[Mmhmm]]'', in late 2004.  Pop-culture references were even less specific than on the band's third album, if present at all. The album was significantly more on the serious side with very few of the silly songs the band was known for.<ref name="amazon mmhmm">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000641ZOK/ Amazon.com: MMHMM: Relient K: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{failed verification|nothing about silly|date=January 2011}}</ref> The album had the band experimenting with its sound a bit more, which included incorporating piano, [[hardcore punk]] and some [[pop music]].<ref name="amazon mmhmm" /> In July 2005, the album was [[gold album|certified gold]] for shipping over 500,000 copies. It is reported that it has sold approximately 796,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://au.launch.yahoo.com/070209/11/13cj8.html |title = Relient K draws fans in Christian, mainstream markets |access-date =March 21, 2007 |date = February 10, 2007 |work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070715215127/http://au.launch.yahoo.com/070209/11/13cj8.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = July 15, 2007}}</ref> Driven by newfound recognition from ''Mmhmm'', ''Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do'' was also certified gold in spring 2005.

Retrieved December 13, 2008.</ref>

Shortly before ''Mmhmm''{{'}}s release, longtime bassist [[Brian Pittman]] left the band, citing that he was tired of touring and wanted to start a landscaping company.<ref name="USAToday">{{cite web |url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-11-29-otv-relientk_x.htm |title = Can this punk-pop band make it big?

Matt Thiessen announced Pittman's departure in fall 2004, saying:
"After almost seven years of being in Relient K, our cherished and lifelong friend, Brian Pittman has decided to move on to other things. That IS crazy, huh? Brian decided to leave the band in July, so we've had plenty of time to let the initial shock die down. We're aware that a lot of you already knew, so we apologize for not announcing this sooner. There were many reasons. He thought long and hard about his decision, and he came to the conclusion that he would like to do other things than play bass for the band. We respect him for it. We'd be lying to say that we're not all completely bummed that Brian won't be a part of Relient K anymore. And though we know things won't be the same without him, it must be said that we have always valued our friendships with him more than our on-stage relationship.

[[File:RelientKAtPurpleDoor.jpg|thumb|left|Relient K, live at the [[Christian rock]] festival, Purple Door 2006]]
"Anyway, all of us still hang out, and its like nothing is different at all. I feel like that's how you know that you've made a friend that will be there for the rest of your days. We want to thank Brian for all the years he gave the band. You're the best, buddy."<ref name="Special K" />

Pittman reunited with the band for one final show, which was the release party for "Mmhmm" at the Newport Music Hall in [[Columbus, Ohio]] on November 1, 2004. [[John Warne]], lead singer and guitarist of [[Ace Troubleshooter]], filled in as bassist for the remainder of 2004 and became full-time bassist in 2005. Also in 2005, Jon Schneck joined as a third guitarist, as well as a banjo and bell player, to create a fuller, more distinctive sound. This was also because the band planned to add more piano, and having another guitarist gave Matt Thiessen the freedom to do that.<ref>{{cite web|title=Relient K: Something So Right|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/culture/music/relient-k-something-so-right-11540243.html|access-date=November 6, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Relient K.jpg|thumbnail|Relient K performing in 2005]]
Relient K provided the first track, "[[Manic Monday]]" originally recorded by [[The Bangles]], to the various artist CD, ''[[Punk Goes 80's]]'', released on June 7, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/punk-goes-80s-mw0000208592 |title=''Punk Goes 80s'' on AllMusic |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=December 28, 2014}}</ref>

''Mmhmm'' features two [[Top 40]] hits which both made it on [[MTV]]'s Top Ten. The music video for the track [[Be My Escape]] entered MTV's Top Ten, and landed them an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. "Be My Escape" is also featured on ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!|Now! 19]]'', a popular secular and quasi-annual compilation series.

=== ''Five Score and Seven Years Ago'' (2006–08) ===

[[File:Matt Hoopes and Matt Thiessen at Sonar Baltimore May 2007.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Matt Hoopes]] (left) and [[Matt Thiessen]] (right) performing at the Sonar in Baltimore, MD in 2007]]
Recording sessions for another studio album, ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]'', started on June 18, 2006 and continued for parts of July and August. Some tracks on the album were produced by [[Howard Benson]], ([[The All-American Rejects]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[P.O.D.]]). "Four score and seven years ago" is the first line of the [[Gettysburg Address]], the famous speech delivered by [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Thiessen had said that the title of the album comes from the fact that it's the band's fifth album, it is the first time all five of them are on a record together, and the band had been seven years since the release of ''[[Relient K (album)|Relient K]]''.<ref name="Montgomery_VH1">Montgomery, James.

On March 2, 2007 the entire album (except the last track, "Deathbed") was made available for streaming on the band's [[MySpace]]. ''Five Score and Seven Years Ago'' debuted at No.&nbsp;6 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling about 64,000 copies in its first week.<ref>[http://www.coolfer.com/blog/archives/2007/03/chart_recap_dea_1.php Chart Recap: Dead Rapper Tops Chart With Less Than 100,000<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{self-published inline|date=January 2011}}</ref>

In the early morning of June 28, 2007, Relient K's bus caught on fire from an oil spill from the engine. Everyone escaped safely, but the band lost many instruments, laptops, cameras, phones, iPods, clothes, and merchandise. Matt Thiessen said he lost a laptop that had roughly 100 unfinished songs on it, and Dave Douglas lost his Battlefield drum set. In the midst of it, the band still laughed at the situation, calling it "cinematic".<ref>Kane, Dan.

== Tours and live performances ==
{{main article|List of Relient K Tours and Live Performances}}

== Other projects ==

=== ''The Complex Infrastructure Known as the Female Mind'' ===

In 2004, Relient K released a book, ''The Complex Infrastructure Known as the Female Mind''. Though the band is listed as the author of the book, the band members contributed very little to the content of the book.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs-Y3JxF2O8|title=Relient K Interview 2013 - Easterfest |access-date=May 17, 2013}}</ref> The book clues in the confused male Relient K fans on the thoughts of female fans, and clues in the confused female Relient K fans on some of the thoughts of males.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/entertainment/Books/non_RelientK.aspx |title=Relient K: The Complex Infrastructure Known as the Female Mind, at CBN |publisher=Cbn.com |date=September 28, 2011 |access-date=October 4, 2011}}</ref> The band gives advice on the opposite sex through personal experience, stereotypes (including The Rock Chick and Vanilla Pudding), and [[Bible|Biblical]] advice—presented in the attitude found in the group's music. The title of the book is taken from the last line of the song "Mood Rings," which is found on the band's third album, ''[[Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do]]''.

=== Woodland Forest ===

In June 2006, Relient K released the first episode of the group's own [[flash cartoon]]. The cartoon features all five band members, and takes place in a fictional land known as Woodland Forest. It is animated by bassist [[John Warne]]. There have only been two episodes thus far, and can be found on YouTube.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGlnQ-PPOqc YouTube - Woodland Forest - Episode 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88YuojPzBcs YouTube - Woodland Forest - O Holy Nightmare<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{unreliable source?|date=January 2011}}</ref> The cartoons also feature "Merle the Squirrel," singing the Woodland Forest theme song, as well as "Crosby the Reindeer," singing [[O Holy Night]].

=== Podcasts ===

Relient K has made a total of nine audio [[podcast]]s and eleven video podcasts. The nine audio podcasts were made during the band's time on the Matt Hoopes Birthday Tour. The band included interviews with the band members, the group's guitar technicians, and along with others involved in the group's touring. There were also interviews with the other touring bands, [[The Rocket Summer]] and [[Maxeen]].

The five video podcasts include various scenes in the studio, as well as the band doing things outside the studio, much like the video podcasts made by Switchfoot. The first two video podcasts showed the band in the studio preparing for the recording of ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]'', and Dave Douglas recording the [[drum]] parts, respectively. The third video podcast was a collection of footage and discussions from the Nintendo Fusion Tour, and a ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' Tournament between the five band members. The fourth video podcast showed Jon Schneck and Dave Douglas preparing for a boxing match (which is also included and completed in the Wal-Mart "Devastation and Reform" video), and the fifth video podcast showed the completion of the battle. There is a sixth unreleased video podcast including John Warne fulfilling his lifelong dream of walking into a room with the [[AutoZone]] Theme Song playing. It shows Warne recording the song with the assistance of Dave Douglas and Jon Schneck. It can be found on YouTube at the present time, and it is currently unofficially released on the site, as it has not made it to the band's official site. The eighth video podcast is about the band going to see millions of bats fly at sundown. The last podcast is a short video showing the band playing a game called "Gum Golf" created during the release of ''Let it Snow, Baby... Let it Reindeer''.

=== Related projects ===

Outside of Relient K, Matt Thiessen has a piano-focused solo project called [[Matthew Thiessen and the Earthquakes]]. He started it in 1998, around the time Relient K was started. He released a full album, "Wind Up Bird", under the project in 2018.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://open.spotify.com/album/5bI4WqPfoNGj4Cv6Qqn3dT?si=tehwd-XPQpKHmhe7GcLUxg&utm_source=copy-link | title="Wind Up Bird" by Matthew Thiessen and the Earthquakes on Spotify | access-date=May 6, 2021}}</ref>

The band made a cover of the song, "[[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything (song)|The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything]]" for the soundtrack to the movie [[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]. It was also featured in the [[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie|movie adaptation]] of the song.

Former drummer Dave Douglas created a project called [[Agnes (band)|Agnes]], a solo rock project that somewhat resembles the sound of Relient K's earlier music with his own twist. Douglas also started a project called Gypsy Parade, a softer project that he started with his wife, Rachel. They have released two demo songs on their MySpace with more expected.  Douglas amicably left Relient K to further pursue this project.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Gypsy Parade has since disbanded, Attack Cat taking its place.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/artistdetail.php?artist_id=3066 | title=Gypsy Parade Artist Profile | access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

Ethan Luck, the former drummer, was involved with the [[Christian metal]] band [[Demon Hunter]] until late 2009, but he also has a side project called My Red Hot Nightmare{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} which included drummer Josh Abbott, who was the drummer for Bassist John Warne's band, Ace Troubleshooter for the band's entire existence. Luck also played guitar in the Christian Ska band [[The O.C. Supertones]] and is featured on a few of the band's albums, including [[Loud and Clear (The O.C. Supertones album)|Loud and Clear]] and [[Live! Volume One]].

Three tracks were featured on the compilation album ''My Other Band, Vol. 1'' on Mono vs Stereo records in 2006, from Matt Thiessen's side project Matthew Thiessen and the Earthquakes, Dave Douglas' side project Agnes, and Ethan Luck's My Red Hot Nightmare project.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Relient K was part of a fundraiser called "Habitat for Humanity" with other Christian bands. Matt Thiessen and Jon Foreman (Switchfoot's lead singer and guitarist) wrote a song called "Rebuild" to help raise even more money.

In 2011, John Warne became a member of [[Yellow Second]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eastscene.com/2011/08/15/relient-k-warped-interview/ | title=Relient K – Interview | access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

Matt Thiessen co-wrote the song "Longshot" along with [[Katy Perry]] for [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s CD, ''[[All I Ever Wanted (album)|All I Ever Wanted]]''.

=== Philanthropy ===

Relient K starred in the educational drug abuse prevention film, "Natural High 4".<ref name="naturalHigh">{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalhigh.org/|title=Natural High A Drug Prevention Program Inspiring and Helping Youth|access-date=November 19, 2014}}</ref> The band members provided advice to young adults to stay off of drugs and to pursue their personal best.
