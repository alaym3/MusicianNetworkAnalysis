'''The Dead South''' is a [[Folk music|folk]]-[[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] musical ensemble based in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], Canada. The band was initially formed in 2012 as a quartet by Nate Hilts (vocals, guitar, mandolin), Scott Pringle (guitar, mandolin, vocals), Danny Kenyon (cello, vocals) and Colton Crawford ([[banjo]]). Crawford left the band in 2015 and was replaced by studio musician Eliza Mary Doyle for several years. Crawford re-joined the band starting with the Voices In Your Head tour in mid-2018.<ref name="DS.com">{{cite web|url=http://thedeadsouth.com/#about|title=About|website=Thedeadsouth.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913040643/http://thedeadsouth.com/#about|archive-date=13 September 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref>

The band played live venues before releasing their debut five-song 2013 [[Extended play|EP]], ''The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame''. Their 2014 album ''Good Company'' was released by German label Devil Duck Records, and led to significant overseas touring for the next two years. ''Good Company's'' single "In Hell, I'll Be in Good Company", produced by Orion Paradis at SoulSound studio, was created along with a video on YouTube, and is credited as contributing to the breakthrough release for the band.

To date, The Dead South have released one [[Extended Play|EP]] - ''The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame (2013)'', and three studio albums: ''Good Company (2014)'', ''Illusion and Doubt (2016)'', and ''Sugar & Joy (2019)''.

== History ==
Nate Hilts and Danny Kenyon came up with the idea for a "rockin' stompin' bluegrass band"<ref name="SputM">{{cite web|title=The Dead South|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/The-Dead-South/81194/|website=SputnikMusic.com|publisher=Sputnik Music|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref> in 2012 while playing together in a short-lived alternative grunge band. After the grunge band's demise, Colton Crawford and Scott Pringle joined what would become the Regina-based band The Dead South.<ref name="Lead">{{cite web|last1=DeDekker|first1=Jeff|title=Life is full of Illusion and Doubt for The Dead South|url=https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/life-is-full-of-illusion-doubt-for-the-dead-south|website=Leaderpost.com|publisher=Leader Post|accessdate=28 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328223710/http://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/life-is-full-of-illusion-doubt-for-the-dead-south|archive-date=28 March 2017}}</ref> Crawford learned [[banjo]] and Pringle learned how to play the [[mandolin]] to supplement his [[guitar]]. They ended up with their own version of the bluegrass genre. They strive for a satirical view of the genre while remaining true to it.<ref name="SputM"/>

The band toured extensively and repeatedly in Canada and Europe.  Crawford left the band in 2015, and Eliza Mary Doyle, a noted solo and studio musician, was hired to fill the vacancy. 
After almost 2 years of absence from the band, Colton "Crawdaddy" Crawford returned to the lineup, replacing Doyle as banjoist.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Dead South on Instagram: "Fall is here in Canada!

While the band played various venues, they would sell what would eventually become their [[Self publishing|self-released]] EP ''The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame''.

In his review of the EP, Jamie Funk of Divide and Conquer Music was initially unsure if he could handle banjo picking in every song, but ended up enjoying it. The five songs offered in the EP reminded Funk of alternative bands attempting to play bluegrass music and succeeding beyond expectations. While most of the songs are classically "knee-slapping [[hoedown]]" bluegrass, other songs bear some similarities to alternative songs from the 90's.<ref name="DaC">{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Jamie|title=THE DEAD SOUTH – THE OCEAN WENT MAD WE WERE TO BLAME|url=http://www.divideandconquermusic.com/indie-music-album-reviews/the-dead-south-the-ocean-went-mad-we-were-to-blame|website=divideandconquer.com|publisher=Divide and Conquer|accessdate=27 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228034435/http://www.divideandconquermusic.com/indie-music-album-reviews/the-dead-south-the-ocean-went-mad-we-were-to-blame|archive-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>

The Dead South's debut studio album ''Good Company'' was released in 2014 through the German record label Devil Duck Records, and led to extensive touring in Canada and Europe.<ref name="DS.com"/> The album contains a total of 14 tracks, including a rendition of ''Banjo Odyssey'', which previously appeared on ''The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame''.

Additionally, The Dead South received in 2015 the "Road Gold" certification from Canadian Independent Music Association (CIMA) for over 25,000 ticket sales in a 12-month period.<ref name="CIMA">{{cite web|title=THE DEAD SOUTH EARN CIMA'S ROAD GOLD CERTIFICATION|url=https://cimamusic.ca/news/recent-news/read,article/6884/the-dead-south-earn-cima-s-road-gold-certification|website=cimamusic.ca|publisher=Canadian Independent Music Assiciation|accessdate=27 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144853/https://cimamusic.ca/news/recent-news/read,article/6884/the-dead-south-earn-cima-s-road-gold-certification|archive-date=28 December 2017}}</ref> In presenting the award, CIMA President Stuart Johnston noted that the certification was given to recognize the talent and hard-working nature of the touring band.

In October 2016, a music video for "In Hell, I'll Be in Good Company" was released onto [[YouTube]], retroactively fueling interest in ''Good Company''. Though the song and respective album were released in 2015, they appeared in the Top 50 on the ''Billboard'' music charts and on the Top 20 on US iTunes overall chart during December 2017.<ref name="DS.com"/> It is The Dead South's most viewed video by a considerable margin, with over 273 million views.

Rachel Freitas of MusicExistence notes that the album's second track, ''Achilles'', "has the signature banjo sound that The Dead South are known for, but the instrumentation is a bit lighter. What one will find quickly while listening to the LP is that The Dead South are master storytellers that really know how to bring a song to life".<ref name="MEx">{{cite web |last1=Freitas |first1=Rachel |title=Album Review.

Amanda Hathers, of CanadianBeats, opines that, while the album provides "the traditional folk/country experience, chock full of banjo plucking, twang and impressive harmonies, the band's ability to make the music entertaining and engaging is impressive. ''Boots'', the album's first track, begins soft and quiet before picking up speed before its end. ''Miss Mary'' in particular, serves as an atypical and surprising example of [[folk music]] as interpreted by The Dead South and ''Hard Day'' showcases Hilts' grit and power as vocalist."<ref name="CB">{{cite web|last1=Hather|first1=Amanda|title=Review – The Dead South|url=http://canadianbeats.ca/2016/11/18/review-the-dead-south-2/|website=CanadianBeats.ca|publisher=Canadian Beats|accessdate=27 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144854/http://canadianbeats.ca/2016/11/18/review-the-dead-south-2/|archive-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>

Apart from ''Illusion and Doubt'' peaking at number five on the US ''Billboard'' Bluegrass [[Record chart|chart]], it also entered the top 30 on the US Country iTunes Chart.<ref name="DS.com"/>

''Sugar & Joy'' is The Dead South's most recent album to date, which expanded upon the imagery and unconventional composition in ''Illusion and Doubt''. The album was very well received critically, reaching #1 on the American bluegrass charts.
Peter Churchill of Americana UK gave the album a 9/10, writing "There is a feeling, when first listening to the album, of anticipation, of wondering in what direction these bunch of outrageously talented musicians might head with the next track. The only consistent here is the quality and the sheer infectiousness of the music."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Churchill |first1=Peter |title=The Dead South "Sugar & Joy" |url=https://americana-uk.com/the-dead-south-sugar-joy-six-shooter-records-2019#:~:text=Home-,The%20Dead%20South%20“Sugar%20%26%20Joy”%20(Six%20Shooter%20Records,album%20%27Sugar%20%26%20Joy%27. |website=Americana UK |accessdate=1 September 2020}}</ref>

Chris Conaton of PopMatters gave it an 8/10, praising the diversity of the themes and the manner in which it incorporated different styles of music: "''Sugar and Joy'' shows there's a lot of life in the corner of roots music where playing loud and fast while also leaving room for slower, more nuanced songs is considered a great combination. It's nice to hear an album that embraces the core tenets of 21st-century [[Americana (music)|Americana]] (or Canadiana, in the Dead South's case) while still doing their own thing. ''Sugar and Joy'' is one of the most entertaining albums I've heard in 2019."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Conaton |first1=Chris |title=The Dead South's 'Sugar and Joy' Is One of 2019's Most Entertaining Albums |url=https://www.popmatters.com/dead-south-sugar-and-joy-2640782517.html |website=PopMatters |accessdate=1 September 2020}}</ref>

== Musical style and influence ==

The band refers to themselves as "[[Mumford & Sons|Mumford and Sons]]' Evil Twins", a nod to their dark and often violent interpretation of the "aesthetic of old western pioneers".<ref name="MEx" /> Freitas of MusicExistence notes the "evil twin" comparison, but considers that, with ''Good Company'', the band stands on its own merit in the folk world. Hilts and Kenyon had been listening to bluegrass bands [[Trampled by Turtles]] and [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] before forming their own band. They agreed that they wanted to perform their own version of traditional folk and bluegrass. ''AllMusic'' reviewer Timothy Monger considers that tradition to be "a gritty punk ethos with traditional bluegrass and old-time string band music"<ref name="Allm">{{cite web|last1=Monger|first1=Timothy|title=The Dead South|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-dead-south-mn0003469519/biography|website=Allmusic.com|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=27 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144854/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-dead-south-mn0003469519/biography|archive-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>

In their review of ''Good Company'', Sputnik Music notes that the band includes songs about the usual: lovin', cheatin', killin' and drinkin'." Sputnik Music also points out that the band's clothing style of ordinary white shirts, black trousers, black [[suspenders]] and the occasional flat-brimmed hat is often mimicked by their fans. RJ Frometa, of Vents Magazine, notes the odd clothing style – referred to by the band itself as "their distinctive hillbilly cum pioneer look"<ref name="TDSab">{{cite web|title=About|url=http://thedeadsouth.com/#about|website=The Dead South|publisher=The Dead South|accessdate=28 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913040643/http://thedeadsouth.com/#about|archive-date=13 September 2017}}</ref> – as well, considering them "fun, modern-day hillbillies who marry an incredible stage presence with their distinct country twang that includes banjos, mandolins, a cello, guitars, whistles, finger snapping and occasionally some head banging." Frometa opines that The Dead South strive to create a sarcastic sound all their own.<ref name="VM">{{cite web|last1=Frometa|first1=AJ|title=Canadian Bluegrass Band The Dead South Release New Album Illusion And Doubt|url=http://ventsmagazine.com/2016/09/19/canadian-bluegrass-band-dead-south-release-new-album-illusion-doubt/|website=VentsMagazine.com|publisher=Vents Magazine|accessdate=27 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144854/http://ventsmagazine.com/2016/09/19/canadian-bluegrass-band-dead-south-release-new-album-illusion-doubt/|archive-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>

Sarah Murphy of Exclaim.ca says that the band's injection of folk and bluegrass sounds with a "punk rock ethos (not to mention a banjo player who's a self-proclaimed metalhead), the band bring a fresh perspective to classic genres."<ref name="Exc">{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Sarah|title=The Dead South 'Illusion & Doubt' (album stream)|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/the_dead_south-illusion_and_doubt_album_stream|website=Exclaim.ca|publisher=Exclaim|accessdate=27 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331154629/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/the_dead_south-illusion_and_doubt_album_stream|archive-date=31 March 2017}}</ref>

MusicCrowns.org reviewer James Cooke suggests that the band's "gritty vocals, aggressive guitar strumming, mandolin chops, banjo licks and a steady kick drum to fuse it all together" deliver a unique sound that doesn't exactly fit the traditional definition of bluegrass.<ref name="MCr">{{cite web|last1=Cooke|first1=James|title=Is The Dead South's 'In Hell I'll Be In Good Company' bluegrass or not?|url=https://www.musiccrowns.org/emerging-talent/dead-souths-hell-ill-good-company-bluegrass-not/ |website=Musiccrowns.org|publisher=Music Crowns |accessdate=27 December 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228035732/https://www.musiccrowns.org/emerging-talent/dead-souths-hell-ill-good-company-bluegrass-not/ |archive-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>

Cooke notes that The Dead South's release of "In Hell, I'll Be in Good Company" is labelled as bluegrass, but has caused fans to question whether the label is appropriate or not. He argues that since bluegrass has been influenced by [[Irish folk music|Irish]], [[Scottish folk music|Scottish]], and [[African-American music|African American]] music, the definition of bluegrass as a genre has become blurred.<ref name="MCr"/>

The lyrical content of The Dead South's song "Banjo Odyssey" off their 2014 album ''Good Company'' has been in question since its release, but became more so following the allegations being published.<ref name=sexualmisconduct1/>  In an August 2014 Facebook post, the band said: "The song is a satirical, tongue-in-cheek reference to the bluegrass genre and tells a story about two cousins who engage in a relationship.  We sincerely apologize to anyone who has been hurt or offended by these lyrics, as the last thing we would want to do is offend anyone.  Obviously, we do not condone rape or violence, and "Banjo Odyssey" (like many of our songs) is written as a story, and not as something to be taken literally."<ref name=sexualmisconduct1/>

[[Six Shooter Records]], who represent The Dead South, released a statement on 19 August saying they are discussing the song "Banjo Odyssey" and "our responsibility as a record label with respect to both artistic expression and social responsibility. We feel it is important to allow the time for a thoughtful and thorough process before taking action."  The band also said on 19 August that it "is opposed to, and does not condone, harmful behaviour of any kind."<ref name=sexualmisconduct1/>

The Dead South said they were taking steps to be "part of the solution", including supporting victims organizations, discussing the impact of their song "Banjo Odyssey", implementing training for band and team members and creating a code of conduct to adhere to.<ref name=sexualmisconduct2/>  The band began training the band and crew on consent, professional conduct, and creating safer spaces for their fans and the team.  Six Shooter's first training session on consent took place 25 and 26 August.  All staff, artists, crew, and agents were invited and encouraged to participate.<ref name=sexualmisconduct1/>
