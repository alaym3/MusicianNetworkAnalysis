He is best known for his musical comedy. He has released six CDs, five DVDs, and live comedy shows that he has performed internationally. He has appeared on television in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

A documentary film about Minchin, ''Rock N Roll Nerd'' (directed by Rhian Skirving), was released theatrically in 2008 and broadcast by [[ABC1]] in 2009. He is the composer and lyricist of the [[Olivier Award]]-winning, [[Tony Award]]-winning and [[Grammy Award]]-nominated show ''[[Matilda the Musical]]'' and the Olivier Award-winning and Tony Award-nominated show ''[[Groundhog Day (musical)|Groundhog Day The Musical]]''.

He was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] in the 2020 [[Australia Day honours]].

==Early life==
Timothy David Minchin was born in [[Northampton]] on 7 October 1975, the son of Australian parents Ros and David Ellison Minchin.<ref>Chain Reaction – Series 8 – 4.

Minchin started learning piano at the age of eight, but gave it up after three years because he did not enjoy the discipline. He developed a renewed interest in the instrument after he started writing music with his brother Dan, a guitarist, but still describes himself as a "hack pianist ... a 'more you practise, the better you get' kind of guy".<ref name="void" /> He was educated at [[Christ Church Grammar School]],<ref name="void" /> an [[independent school]] in Perth. He graduated from the [[University of Western Australia]] (UWA) in 1996 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English and theatre, and from the [[Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts]] in 1998 with an Advanced Diploma in contemporary music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5RBG1PadWI |title=Tim Minchin Occasional Address and Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters – YouTube |access-date=24 February 2014}}</ref>

==Musical comedy==
[[File:Tim Minchin piano.jpg|thumb|Minchin playing the piano on stage]]
Minchin describes his act as a "funny cabaret show" and sees himself primarily as a musician and songwriter as opposed to a comedian; he has said that his songs "just happen to be funny."<ref name="just funny" /> His reasoning for combining the disciplines of music and comedy was revealed in one interview when he said: "I'm a good musician for a comedian and I'm a good comedian for a musician but if I had to do any of them in isolation I dunno."<ref name="sheffieldinterview">{{cite web |author=Linzy | url=http://angry-feet.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=114473#p114473 | title=Interview One – 11th October 2007 at Fagan's, Sheffield, UK |date=15 March 2009 | access-date=8 January 2010}}</ref>

He draws on his background in theatre for his distinctive onstage appearance and persona.<ref name="looney" /> In his performances, he typically goes barefoot with wild hair and heavy eye makeup, which is juxtaposed with a crisp suit and tails, and a grand piano. According to Minchin, he likes going barefoot in his shows because it makes him feel more comfortable. He considers the eye makeup important because while he is playing the piano he is not able to use his arms and relies on his face for expressions and gestures; the eyeliner makes his features more distinguishable for the audience.<ref name="void">{{cite web |author=Minchin, Tim | url=http://the-void.co.uk/interview/comedian-tim-minchin/ | title=INTERVIEW: Tim Minchin |work=The Void |date=5 June 2007 | access-date=8 May 2012}}</ref> He has said that much of his look and persona is about "treading that line between mocking yourself and wanting to be an iconic figure. Mocking the ridiculousness and completely unrealistic dream of being an iconic figure."<ref name="nerd">{{cite web|last=Low|first=Lenny Ann| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/rocknroll-nerd/2007/11/07/1194329300055.html | title=Rock'n'roll nerd |work=[[The Age]]|date=8 November 2007 | access-date=20 August 2008}}</ref>

The shows consist largely of Minchin's comedic songs and poetry, with subjects including social satire, inflatable dolls, sex fetishes, and his own failed rock star ambitions. In between songs, he performs short stand-up routines.<ref name="just funny" /> Several of his songs deal with religion, a subject with which Minchin—an [[atheist]] and a fan of [[Richard Dawkins]]—says he is "a bit obsessed".<ref name="time out">{{cite web |author=Arthur, Tim | url=https://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/features/5586/Tim_Minchin-interview.html | title=Tim Minchin: interview |work=Time Out London |date=1 September 2008 | access-date=13 September 2008}}</ref> He argues that, as one of the most powerful and influential forces in the world, religion should never be off-limits to satirists. He says that his favourite song to perform is "Peace Anthem for Palestine", which reflects his feelings about religious conflict.<ref name="groggy">{{cite web|author=Taylor, Darlene |url=http://www.thegroggysquirrel.com/articles/2007/02/12/tim-minchin2/ |title=Interview: Tim Minchin interview |work=The Groggy Squirrel |date=12 February 2007 |access-date=13 September 2008 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506182359/http://www.thegroggysquirrel.com/articles/2007/02/12/tim-minchin2/ |archive-date=6 May 2012 }}</ref> His comedy also deals with [[taboo]]s more broadly.<ref>{{cite web |author=Minchin, Tim | url=http://www.angry-feet.com/fans/interview/11.php | title=Interview |work=Angry (Feet) |date=December 2007 | access-date=13 September 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625042656/http://www.angry-feet.com/fans/interview/11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 25 June 2008}}</ref> A prime example of this is the song "Prejudice", which parodies the power awarded to something as simple as a word. In October 2010 he was made a Distinguished Supporter of the [[British Humanist Association]].

===Early career (1998–2007)===
[[File:Tim Minchin singing.jpg|thumb|right|Minchin performing in April 2007]]
After graduating from WAAPA in 1998, Minchin started out composing music for documentaries and theatre. In 2000, he wrote and starred in the musical ''Pop'' at the Blue Room Theatre in Perth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/ArchivedStatements/Pages/CourtCoalitionGovernmentSearch.aspx?ItemId=111490&minister=Board&admin=Court&page=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418135936/http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/ArchivedStatements/Pages/CourtCoalitionGovernmentSearch.aspx?ItemId=111490&minister=Board&admin=Court&page=2|url-status=dead|title=Major survey of WA youth gets underway: Theatre|archivedate=18 April 2012}}</ref> He released a CD titled ''Sit'' with his band Timmy the Dog in 2001 but achieved little success.<ref name="stateline" /> In 2002, after only one professional acting job, he moved from Perth to Melbourne to pursue work.<ref name="norwich">{{cite web |author=Saltmarsh, Abigail | url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/GoingOut/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=GoingOutComedy&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=GoingOutComedy&itemid=NOED22%20Aug%202008%2011%3A40%3A27%3A820 | title=Interview: Tim Minchin |work=Norwich Evening News |date=22 August 2008 | access-date=12 September 2008}}</ref> Minchin struggled initially; he could not get an agent for a year and had been unable to find any acting work.<ref name="stateline" /> While several record companies gave him positive feedback, they were not sure how his music—a mixture of satirical songs and more serious pop songs—could be marketed. He decided to compile all of his humorous songs into a single live show to "get the comedy stuff off my chest" before going back to more serious music.<ref>{{cite web |author=Minchin, Tim | url=http://www.abc.net.au/dig/tv/episodes/20060807_2100.htm | title=7&nbsp;August Episode |work=Dig TV |date=7 August 2006 | access-date=13 September 2008}}</ref>

Minchin says he entered into comedy "naively", having never even attended a live comedy gig before performing one himself.<ref name="time out" /> His break-out show ''Darkside'' (co-produced by Laughing Stock Productions) achieved critical success at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, where it won the inaugural Festival Directors' Award and attracted the notice of Karen Koren, the manager of the well-known [[Gilded Balloon]] venues.<ref>{{cite web|last=Woodhead|first=Cameron| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts-reviews/tim-minchin/2006/04/19/1145344122118.html | title=Tim Minchin |work=[[The Age]]|date=19 April 2006 | access-date=20 August 2008}}</ref> Koren backed the show's run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where Minchin received the [[Perrier Comedy Award]] for Best Newcomer.<ref name="looney" /><ref name="bestnewcomer">{{cite web |agency=Reuters/AAP| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/minchin-best-newcomer/2005/08/28/1125167538808.html | title=Minchin best newcomer |work=[[The Age]]|date=29 August 2005 | access-date=20 August 2008}}</ref> His 2006 show ''So Rock'' was nominated for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival's top prize, the [[Barry Award (for comedy)|Barry Award]], and in 2007 he was given the award for Best Alternative Comedian at the [[HBO US Comedy Arts Festival]].<ref name="just funny">{{cite web |author=Maxwell, Tom | url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/theguide/Tim39s-just--funny-that.3734007.jp| title=Tim's just funny that way |work=Edinburgh Evening News |date=1 February 2008 | access-date=21 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Platt|first=Craig| url=http://blogs.theage.com.au/lastlaugh/archives/2006/05/last_laugh_barr.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912212933/http://blogs.theage.com.au/lastlaugh/archives/2006/05/last_laugh_barr.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=12 September 2007| title=Barry Award nominees announced |work=[[The Age]]|department=Last Laugh blog|date=1 April 2006 | access-date=21 August 2008}}</ref>

Live recordings of his 2005 and 2006 shows, ''[[Darkside (Tim Minchin album)|Darkside]]'' and ''[[So Rock]]'', have been released as CDs. In 2007, he released a DVD titled ''So Live'', featuring a live recording in the [[Sydney Opera House]] Studio with material from both of his previous shows.<ref name="nerd" /> As this DVD was only released in Australia, he released a DVD in 2008 entitled ''[[So F**king Rock Live]]'' in the UK, containing largely the same material as ''So Live''.

===''Ready for This?'' (2008–2010)===
In August 2008, Minchin debuted his third solo show, ''Ready for This?'', at the Edinburgh Fringe and subsequently took it on tour across the UK. During the Edinburgh run, he contributed to ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper's podcasts,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/audio/2008/aug/14/comedy.podcast.10|title=Edinburgh festival podcast: The Guardian Live at the Gilded Balloon, with Tim Minchin|author=Miles Jupp|author-link=Miles Jupp|work=The Guardian}}</ref> despite his new show containing a song about a ''Guardian'' critic who once gave his show a negative review.<ref>{{cite news |title= Edinburgh festival: Tim Minchin|author= Brian Logan |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 14 August 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/13/edinburghfestival.timminchin |access-date=3 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Tim Minchin, Gilded Balloon|author= Phil Daoust |newspaper= The Guardian|date= 16 August 2005|url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/16/comedy|access-date=3 November 2010}}</ref> Responding to the song, which contains graphic violence, the critic laconically remarked that he had not yet had time to listen to it: "Life's too short and I've already done my bit by sitting through that show in Edinburgh."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/28/tim-minchin-interview-matilda-jesus |title=Tim Minchin: 'I really don't like upsetting people' |last=Kellaway |first=Kate |author-link=Kate Kellaway|date=29 September 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=4 October 2015 }}</ref>

A live recording of this at [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London, was released as an album for download via [[iTunes]] on 20 July 2009. An Australian recording was released in Australia on DVD on 9 September 2009, and then as a United Kingdom release in the second half of 2010.

It was announced at the end of 2009 that one of Minchin's beat poems, "Storm", was to be made into a short animated movie. A blog was launched to accompany the film-making process, and a short trailer was released on 8 January 2010.<ref name=Storm-YT>{{cite web |url=http://www.timminchin.com/2011/04/08/storm/ |title=Storm!!!!!!!! | work=TimMinchin.com, News and Blog | date=8 April 2011 | access-date=12 February 2017 | last=Minchin | first=Tim http://www.timminchin.com/2011/04/08/storm/}}</ref><ref name="stormtrailer">{{cite web |author=Tracy King | url=http://www.stormmovie.net/blog/2010/01/tim-minchins-storm-official-trailer/#content | title=Tim Minchin's Storm – Official Trailer |work=Storm Production Blog |date=8 January 2010 | access-date=11 January 2010 | archive-date=2 March 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302112408/http://www.stormmovie.net/blog/2010/01/tim-minchins-storm-official-trailer/}}</ref> The full movie was launched on YouTube on 7 April 2011.<ref name="stormmovie">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U | title= Tim Minchin's Storm the Animated Movie |website=[[YouTube]] |date=7 April 2011 | access-date=27 November 2011}}</ref>

Minchin was the subject of the winning entry, by painter [[Sam Leach (artist)|Sam Leach]], in the 2010 [[Archibald Prize]], Australia's most important portraiture competition.<ref name=archibald>{{cite web |author=Antonette Collins |title=Leach stares down Archibald competition |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/26/2857006.htm?section=justin |work=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=28 March 2010 |access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref>

===''Tim Minchin and the Heritage Orchestra'' (2010–2012)===
Minchin embarked on a new arena tour called ''[[Tim Minchin and the Heritage Orchestra Tour|Tim Minchin and the Heritage Orchestra]]'' starting at the [[National Indoor Arena|NIA, Birmingham]] on Wednesday 8 December 2010. A departure from the structure of his previous live shows, his act was scaled up to be performed with the [[Heritage Orchestra]]. It contained a mixture of material, including new songs on the subject of prayer and of rationality (themes which often appear in his previous work). Minchin stated that the aim of incorporating the orchestra into his act was to create a comedy show that would not be ruined by being performed in arenas, as stated in the special features of the DVD and Blu-ray. The show toured the UK and Australia, and was filmed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London for a Blu-ray and DVD that was released in November 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timminchin.com/2011/10/28/a-big-juicy-tim-minchin-and-the-heritage-orchestra-dvd-announcement/|title=Tim Minchin · A Big, Juicy Tim Minchin and The Heritage Orchestra DVD Announcement!|work=Tim Minchin}}</ref>

The show also toured Australia under the title ''Tim Minchin vs. The Orchestras'', where he performed with the city state orchestra in each location.

=== ''BACK'' tour and ''Apart Together'' album (2019–present) ===
On 30 August 2018, Minchin announced he would be returning to touring his musical comedy  in a new tour called ''[[BACK Tour|BACK]]'', also billed as Old Songs, New Songs, Fuck You Songs. It marked the first time Minchin returned to touring since 2012 (with the exception of a micro tour of Los Angeles in October 2017 called ''Leaving LA'').

The tour started in Adelaide, touring Australia and New Zealand in March and April 2019, followed by a tour of the UK in October and November 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timminchin.com/2018/08/29/2019-tour-back-old-songs-new-songs-fuck-you-songs/#more-22026|title=2019 TOUR – BACK (Old Songs, New Songs, Fuck You Songs)|work=Tim Minchin|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref> The tour featured new comedic songs such as "Fuck This", "Leaving LA", and "If This Plane Goes Down", as well as songs from his recent musical works such as "When I Grow Up" from ''Matilda the Musical'' and "Seeing You" from ''Groundhog Day''. The show also saw Tim reveal a new band that played alongside him for the rest of the night. This band played throughout the show, performing with Minchin for songs ranging from "Cheese" (first introduced in ''Tim Minchin and the Heritage Orchestra''), "Prejudice" and new song "I'll Take Lonely Tonight" to a modified version of "If I Didn't Have You". A new song called "15 Minutes (of Shame)" was also performed with the live band.

An Encore tour of ''BACK'' began touring in Australia in March 2020, however dates were postponed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timminchin.com/2020/03/14/my-upcoming-shows-in-sydney-newcastle-melbourne-brisbane-are-being-postponed/|title= My upcoming shows in Sydney, Newcastle, Melbourne & Brisbane are being postponed|date=14 March 2020|website=Tim Minchin.com|access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> The tour resumed in Australia in June and July 2021, followed by a tour in the UK in October, November and December 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tim Minchin · Gig Info|url=https://www.timminchin.com/gigs/|access-date=2021-11-14}}</ref>

In March 2020 it was announced that Minchin had signed a record deal with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] and would release his debut studio album, ''[[Apart Together (album)|Apart Together]]'', in November 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=5 March 2020|title=Tim Minchin Announces the Release of His Long-Awaited Debut Album|url=https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tim-minchin-announces-debut-album-8251/|access-date=17 June 2020|website=Rolling Stone Australia}}</ref> Two songs from the album (also performed on the Back tour) have been released: "Leaving LA" and "I'll Take Lonely Tonight".

In 2008, Minchin was commissioned by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] to write the music and lyrics for ''[[Matilda the Musical]]'', adapted by [[Dennis Kelly]] and based on the [[Matilda (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]].

The director [[Matthew Warchus]] approached Minchin after seeing his ''[[Ready for This?]]'' tour and hearing his song ''[[White Wine in the Sun]]''. The musical premiered at the [[Courtyard Theatre]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], running from 9 November 2010 to 30 January 2011, and it began its [[West End of London|West End]] run at the [[Cambridge Theatre]] on 25 October 2011 to great critical acclaim, winning a record-breaking 7 [[Laurence Olivier Awards]] including Best New Musical.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/event/227033/matilda-the-musical | publisher = [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] | title = Matilda the Musical | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929190633/http://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/event/227033/matilda-the-musical | archive-date = 29 September 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15886443 | work = BBC News | date=25 November 2011 | title = Matilda the Musical proves a hit with West End critics | access-date =4 December 2011 }}</ref> In 2013, ''Matilda'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]],<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/04/01/130401fa_fact_schulman "A problem Like Matilda"] by Michael Schulman, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', p. 32, 1 April 2013</ref> and earned 12 Tony Award nominations, winning 4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/shows/201302211361466191429.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505103738/http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/shows/201302211361466191429.html|url-status=dead|title=tonyawards.com|archivedate=5 May 2013}}</ref> The musical has subsequently been presented worldwide winning numerous awards.

In October 2017 during a Facebook Live Q&A with The Guardian discussing ''Matilda'' with Dennis Kelly, Minchin expressed interest in the idea of adapting the [[Neil Gaiman]] novel ''[[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|Stardust]]'' into a stage musical, but also revealed it's unlikely he would ever do a family musical again.<ref>{{Citation|last=MatildaTheMusical|title=Tim Minchin and Dennis Kelly Q&A with The Guardian's Hannah Ellis-Petersen|date=11 October 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT8toc52Ues|access-date=17 April 2018}}</ref>

==Atheism and skepticism==
During his 2009 interview for [[Australian Skeptics]]' podcast ''The Skeptic Zone'', Minchin addressed his performance style as one that allows bringing up issues that can be upsetting or judgemental to others, such as the "moral hypocrisy about the idea that the Bible is perfect, the only place that you need to go to for your moral guidance&nbsp;... and about, obviously, prejudice in the church, its role in ostracising homosexuals&nbsp;... your defences are down when you're laughing as well and it's couched in music. All I'm doing is making things consumable that are otherwise difficult to consume."<ref name="SkepticZone26">{{cite podcast |title=The Skeptic Zone #26 |date=17 April 2009 |website=skepticzone.tv |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the_skeptic_zone_26_17_april_2009 |access-date=6 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220144036/http://ec.libsyn.com/p/9/6/9/969ee23bc7d9ba91/the_skeptic_zone_26_090417.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d06cd8731d3c05c4a83&c_id=1882109 |archive-date=20 December 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

As the son and grandson of medical surgeons, Minchin addressed [[alternative medicine]] claims by relating that unbiased tests for efficacy are the key:
<blockquote>
You're in such a strong position when you understand the scientific process because all you say is, "Do you understand that the great breakthrough of humanity was figuring out how to make decisions about things whilst discarding human foibles? So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity—if we do it like this we don't have that anymore. Why, surely do you understand how ''powerful'' that is?" And if they don't, then that's what you have to explain to them. It's an extremely powerful thing and a very basic thing.<ref name="SkepticZone26" /></blockquote>

Minchin further explained his [[Skepticism|skeptical]] outlook:
<blockquote>
I've always been an atheist; I've always been an empiricist really. I've never believed in ghosts or psychics or anything like that 'cause it's quite simple—you don't have to know much to go, "''Really''?" Or, to just apply [[Occam's Razor]], to go, "Is it more likely that souls do circus tricks, or more likely that they're talking to dead people? And if the latter, by what process? What do you mean talking to dead people? Aren't their voice boxes rotten? So without a voice box, how do they talk, and by what means?" It doesn't take much to be skeptical about that. But really understanding, as I'm still learning, why science is powerful, is a new step towards being boring at dinner parties.<ref name="SkepticZone26" /></blockquote>

When asked if he thought the universe is full of life, Minchin summarised: "The chances of this happening might be one in infinity. Put it this way: the chance that there being intelligent alien life are, for me, infinitely higher than the chance there being a creator god."<ref name="SkepticZone26" />

In an interview with [[Independent Investigations Group]] member John Rael, Minchin explains that what upsets him most about paranormal beliefs is "[[special pleading]]" by people who say vague things such as "there is no harm in it". Minchin states that there is very little harm in something like [[reiki]], but asks "where do you draw the line?" when it comes to needing real evidence if a therapy works or not. He states that he is an atheist as well as a skeptic, and cannot understand how someone can be a skeptic and still be religious. "If you apply doubt to anything&nbsp;... the whole religion thing is obviously a fantasy."<ref>{{cite interview |interviewer=John Rael |subject=Tim Minchin |title=Be Skeptical, episode #1 |date=10 July 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YGbsQkeMsA |access-date=10 July 2011 }}</ref>

In 2012, Minchin appeared in a video hosted on the homepage of the British Humanist Association, describing humanism as important "because having a non-superstitious worldview allows you to go about your own business, making ethical decisions based on a general desire to do the most possible good."<ref name="humanistvideo">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=49&v=DZN8Ne1nmr4 |title=Humanism Intro Part 1 |date=30 July 2012 |publisher=[[British Humanist Association]] |access-date=12 November 2016 }}</ref>
