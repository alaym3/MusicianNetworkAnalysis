==History==
===Early years===
As a band, Mint Condition came into being during the early 1980s. At first, the band consisted of lead singer and (in-studio) drummer Stokley Williams, lead guitarist Homer O'Dell, and  keyboardist Larry Waddell. Keyboardist/saxophonist Jeff Allen, keyboardist/percussionist/rhythm guitarist Keri Lewis, and bass guitarist Rick Kinchen completed the original lineup.<ref name=Allmusic /> 
They were discovered by music producers [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] in 1989, during a performance at the downtown Minneapolis nightclub [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue]]. Jam and Lewis signed Mint Condition to [[Perspective Records]] soon afterward.<ref name=Allmusic />
Their debut album, ''[[Meant to Be Mint]]'', was released on June 11, 1991 by Perspective. Despite the band's musical versatility, they attempted to attract [[new jack swing]] listeners with their dance cut "Are You Free", but it wasn't successful (the song hit #55 on the R&B charts). However, they did enjoy major success with the ballad "[[Breakin' My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes)]]"; it stayed on the charts for 34 weeks, hitting the [[R&B]] top 5 (#3), and the [[Pop music|Pop]] Top 10 (#6) and was certified gold by the RIAA. Their third single, "Forever In Your Eyes", was also a successful Top 10 R&B hit (#7 R&B). 
Two years later, they released their second album, ''[[From The Mint Factory]]'' (1993). They enjoyed success with the single "[[U Send Me Swingin']]" which peaked at #2 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart for four weeks straight in the spring of 1994. The song was also a smash on the Rhythmic Top 40 charts where it reached #14. The band's next two singles, "Someone to Love" and "So Fine", were Billboard Top 30 R&B hits, reaching the #28, and #29 spots respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mintconditionmusic.com/about |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071300/http://mintconditionmusic.com/about |archive-date=2014-04-07 }} Mint Condition.

The single crept up to the number 2 spot on the Billboard R&B charts in a matter of weeks and received a Gold certification by the RIAA that December. "What Kind Of Man Would I Be?" was so popular that it stayed on the Billboard R&B Charts for a total of 41 weeks before it finally fell off. "You Don't Have to Hurt No More", the second single released from ''Definition of a Band'', was also a Top 10 R&B hit. (#10 R&B, #32 pop). The success of these two singles, along with positive reviews of the album, allowed ''Definition of a Band'' to reach Gold status as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elton, Fugees Score Big In October RIAA Certifications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6QkEAAAAMBAJ&q=mint+condition+definition+of+a+band&pg=RA1-PA81|work=Billboard Magazine|date = 15 November 1997|access-date=2012-08-27}}</ref>
