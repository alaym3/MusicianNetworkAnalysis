'''''Peppa Pig''''' is a British [[preschool]] [[animated]] [[television series]] by [[Astley Baker Davies]]. The show revolves around Peppa, an [[anthropomorphic]] female [[pig]] and her family and peers. The show originally aired on 31 May 2004. The seventh season began broadcasting on 5 March  2021. ''Peppa Pig'' has been broadcast in over 180 countries.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8645658.stm | work=BBC News | title=Peppa Pig moved from Labour event | date=27 April 2010| access-date=10 April 2012}}</ref>

Peppa herself has been [[Voice acting|voiced]] by several different actresses through the years. Lily Snowden-Fine provided her voice in season one and Cecily Bloom in season two,  then [[Harley Bird]], five years old when she started, acquired the role for thirteen years until stepping down after season six.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/31/peppa-pig-voice-actor-harley-bird-quits-after-13-years|title=Peppa Pig voice actor Harley Bird quits after 13 years|last=Davies|first=Hannah J.|date=2020-01-31|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-31|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> She was replaced by Amelie Bea Smith.  [[John Sparkes]], [[Morwenna Banks]], [[Richard Ridings]], Oliver May and Alice May also provide voices.

On 31 December 2019, [[Hasbro]] acquired Entertainment One, including the ''Peppa Pig'' franchise, for a US$3.8 billion deal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/12/31/hasbro-closes-deal-takeover-studio-peppa-pig/|title=Hasbro Closes Deal of Takeover of Studio Behind Peppa Pig|website=TV Shows|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> On 16 March 2021, it was announced that the series was renewed until 2027, with the original creators and studio (Astley Baker Davies) replaced by Karrot Entertainment (producers of ''[[Sarah & Duck]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2021/03/peppa-pig-creators-step-back-eone-2027-1234715448/|title = 'Peppa Pig' Creators Step Back as eOne Kids Phenomenon is Renewed Until 2027|date = 16 March 2021}}</ref>

== Background ==
Taking place in a world where all characters are animals, ''Peppa Pig'' revolves around the titular character and her family and friends. Each episode is approximately five minutes long. Each of her friends is a different [[species]] of animal. Peppa's friends are her age, and Peppa's younger brother George's friends are his age. Episodes tend to feature everyday activities such as attending [[pre-school playgroup|playgroup]], going swimming, visits with their [[grandparent]]s, [[cousin]]s, and friends, going to the [[playground]] or riding [[bicycle|their bikes]].

The characters wear clothes, live in houses, and drive cars, but still display some characteristics of the animals on which they are based. Peppa and her family snort like pigs during conversations in which they are speaking English, and the other animals make their respective noises when they talk, with some exhibiting other characteristics, such as the Rabbit family's squeaking sounds and enjoyment of carrots. The Rabbit and Mole families are the exceptions to the rule of human-like habitation, as they live in a [[burrow]] in a hill, though it has windows and is furnished in the same way as the other houses. The characters blush when embarrassed, and their mouths express other emotions such as sadness, happiness, irritation, bewilderment, and confusion. Although the main characters—mostly mammals—are anthropomorphic, other animal characters are not, such as Tiddles the tortoise, Polly Parrot, and the ducks. The narrator of the series, [[John Sparkes]], reinforces the action and humour, saying things like "Oh, dear" when something unfortunate happens (such as George starts crying) or "Look out!" when a character is doing something unsafe (such as Peppa riding her bicycle without looking where she's going).

==Production and airing==
''Peppa Pig'' is a children's programme telecasting on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and [[Nick Jr. (UK & Ireland)|Nick Jr.]] (UK) in the UK, [[Nickelodeon]]/[[Nick Jr.]] (US) in the US, [[ABC 4 Kids]] in Australia and [[Discovery Kids]] in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking Latin America.

The first series of 52 five-minute episodes started on Channel 5 on 31 May 2004, and had its first run in the US as part of [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Tickle-U]] preschool television programming block from 22 August 2005 to 2007, redubbed with US actors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/cartoon-network-launches-tickle-u-humor-preschoolers |title=Cartoon Network Launches Tickle U To Humor Preschoolers |publisher=Animation World Network |date=22 August 2005 |access-date=23 May 2017}}</ref> However, there were no other official releases of this dub, and every US airing since 2008 uses the original British soundtrack.<ref name="LicenseGlobal">{{Cite web|url=https://www.licenseglobal.com/archive/peppa-pig-track-us-success|title = Peppa Pig: On Track for U.S. Success|date = June 2011}}</ref>

In 2008, ''Peppa Pig'' moved to [[Noggin (brand)#Television channel|Noggin]] in the US as part of ''Noggin Presents'' (a series of interstitial shorts). Since February 2011, the series airs as a half-hour show on the Nick Jr. US channel, and on the separate [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr. block on Nickelodeon]] as of November 2013. For each episode, 5 segments are put together (though for the special containing "Golden Boots" and the episode containing "Around the World", only 3 segments are used) to make the run time 25 minutes.<ref name="LicenseGlobal"/> As of June 2021, there were 9 seasons (and 1 standalone special) of ''Peppa Pig'' in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/peppa-pig/listings/|title=Shows A-Z - peppa pig on nick jr &#124; TheFutonCritic.com|website=www.thefutoncritic.com}}</ref>

It can also be seen on Nick Jr. in the UK, Portugal, Italy, Benelux, Scandinavia, Australia. In Taiwan the show aired on [[Playhouse Disney]]. 

The second series of 52 episodes began on Channel 5 on 4 September 2006, with Cecily Bloom replacing Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa, among other cast changes. The third series started telecasting on Channel 5's preschool-targeted block ''[[Milkshake!]]'' on 4 May 2009 with [[Harley Bird]] replacing Cecily Bloom and Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa.

==Criticism, controversy, concerns and influence==
[[File:Peppa Bicycles.jpg|thumb|left|Comparison of identical frame in original (top) and re-edited versions of the Series 1 episode "''Bicycles''", with cycle helmets added.]]
Peppa and her family did not wear [[seat belt]]s in cars in the first two series. After receiving several complaints, Astley Baker Davies announced that all future animation would include characters wearing seat belts, and that the relevant scenes in the first two series would be re-animated to include them.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8460753.stm| title=Peppa Pig in seatbelt safety row| publisher=BBC|date=15 January 2009}}</ref> Similar changes were also made to add [[cycle helmet]]s to early episodes with characters riding bicycles.<ref>{{cite web |last=Loveday |first=Samantha |url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/6467/ABD-adds-seatbelts-to-Peppa-Pig-episodes |title=ABD adds seatbelts to Peppa Pig episodes &#124; Latest news from the licensing industry |publisher=Licensing.biz |date=14 December 2010 |access-date=26 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930075250/http://www.licensing.biz/news/6467/ABD-adds-seatbelts-to-Peppa-Pig-episodes |archive-date=30 September 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Peppa was used to promote the pre-2010 Labour government's [[Sure Start]] programme, which had the aim of "giving children the best possible start in life".<ref name="BBC">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8645658.stm | work=BBC News | title=Peppa Pig moved from Labour event | date=27 April 2010}}</ref> In April 2010, during the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election]] campaign, E1 Entertainment said that Peppa would not attend the launch of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party's]] families manifesto "in the interests of avoiding any controversy or misunderstanding".

In 2012, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] received a complaint that the Series 1 episode "Mister Skinnylegs" was not appropriate for Australian audiences, as it encouraged befriending spiders;  deadly venomous spiders are prevalent in Australia. The complaint was upheld, and the episode was restricted from airing on the ABC network.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://about.abc.net.au/complaints/peppa-pig-received/|title=Complaint: Peppa Pig, (received), 6th August 2012|website=ABC|date=24 September 2012}}</ref>

In late May 2014, the ABC's Mark Scott expressed fears about the future of Peppa on Australian television, given Australian federal budget cuts to ABC funding that were said to affect its ability to pay for, and broadcast, overseas media products such as ''Peppa Pig''. Australian media noted the character's appeal to Australian toddlers and echoed concerns about the future of her Australian distribution rights. Australian Federal Agriculture Minister [[Barnaby Joyce]] made reference to the character as a menu item at a Thai restaurant, while conservative columnist [[Piers Akerman]] thought that Peppa "pushes a weird [[Feminism|feminist]] line".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/peppa-pig-held-aloft-as-sacrifice-to-god-of-prosperity-20140528-394ml.html|title=Peppa Pig held aloft as sacrifice to god of prosperity|last=Maley|first=Jacqueline|date=28 May 2014|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=29 May 2014}}</ref> On 28 May 2014, [[Minister for Communications (Australia)|Minister for Communications]] [[Malcolm Turnbull]] tweeted: "Contrary to media rumours, Peppa's is one snout we are happy to have in the ABC trough".<ref>{{cite tweet|user=TurnbullMalcolm|author=Malcolm Turnbull|number=471569648610078720|date=28 May 2014|title=Contrary to media rumours,  Peppa's is one snout we are happy to have in the ABC trough.}}</ref>

In 2015 [[Norman Lamb]], a former UK health minister, said that programmes such as ''Peppa Pig'' should include gay characters, because having arbitrary boundaries as to what relationships are acceptable in children's television was "not equitable".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Kids' shows like Peppa Pig should have gay characters, says Liberal |last=Murphy |first=Joe |newspaper=Evening Standard |date=1 July 2015 |url= https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/kids-shows-like-peppa-pig-should-have-gay-characters-says-liberal-democrat-leadership-contender-norman-lamb-10357170.html}}</ref>

The ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' carried a light-hearted article in its Christmas 2017 edition, which suggested that although the programme includes numerous "positive public health messages, encouraging healthy eating, exercise, and road safety", it ran the risk of "contributing to unrealistic expectations of [[primary care]]" by depicting [[general practitioner]] Doctor Brown Bear as making out-of-hours home visits as soon as contacted about apparently trivial illnesses, and dispensing medicines rather too freely.<ref name="bmj1">{{cite journal  |last=Bell|first=Catherine |title=Does Peppa Pig encourage inappropriate use of primary care resources? |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |issue=Christmas 2017 |year=2017 |volume=359 |pages=j5397 |doi=10.1136/bmj.j5397|pmid=29229662 |s2cid=3479066 }}</ref> The media company responsible for Peppa Pig offered no comment when contacted about the article by the BBC.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42322216|title=Peppa Pig's GP visits copied by fans, says doctor|last=Westbrook|first=Ian|date=12 December 2017|access-date=14 December 2017|work=BBC News}}</ref>

Since 2019, it has been observed that children in the US, where ''Peppa Pig'' had become an extremely popular program, had been [[Language acquisition|acquiring]] some specifically English<!--not Scottish, or Welsh-->, rather than American pronunciation and vocabulary. For example, tomato and zebra are pronounced in the English, rather than American way; words such as satnav, petrol, mummy and "biscuit" (instead of "cookie") are used; and comments such as "how clever", "Oh dear", and "can I have a go?" picked up.<ref name=yang>{{Cite news |title=Having a go: US parents say Peppa Pig is giving their kids British accents |last=Yang |first=Maya |work=The Guardian |date=19 July 2021 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jul/19/peppa-pig-american-kids-british-accents}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Brunetti|first=Nic|date=2019-02-12|title=Children in U.S. 'are talking with British accent because of Peppa Pig'|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/12/children-in-u-s-are-talking-with-british-accent-because-of-peppa-pig-8559038/|website=Metro|language=en}}</ref><ref name="WSJ">{{Cite news|last1=Rana|first1=Preetika|last2=Meghan|first2=Bobrowsky|date=18 July 2021|title=Peppa Pig, a Pandemic Favorite, Has American Children Acting British|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/peppa-pig-a-pandemic-favorite-has-american-children-acting-british-11626627266|access-date=20 July 2021|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> This phenomenon was not an issue for many parents; it trended with the [[hashtag]] "#PeppaEffect".<ref name=yang/> Linguistics experts find those conclusions to be "likely exaggerated".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Horton|first=Adrian|date=14 February 2019|title=Telling porkies: no, Peppa Pig is not giving American kids British accents|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/14/peppa-pig-american-children-british-accents|access-date=20 July 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> A written statement by Entertainment One Ltd. when asked of this phenomenon went on saying: "Young Peppa fans see her as a friend…and, as we do with friends that we admire, pick up some of their characteristics...imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."<ref name="WSJ" />
