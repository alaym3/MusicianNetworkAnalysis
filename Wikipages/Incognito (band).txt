==History==
[[File:Incognito - Leverkusener Jazztage 2016-AL3944.jpg|thumb|left|Incognito live at Leverkusener Jazztage (Germany) in November 2016]]
Incognito was founded by Paul "Tubbs" Williams & [[Jean-Paul "Bluey" Maunick]] in 1979, as an offshoot from [[Light of the World (band)|Light of the World]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=642}}</ref> Light of the World was a substantially sized group and following various changes to the lineup, the founding members Breeze Mckrieth, Kenny Wellington & David Baptiste – inspired by American [[funk]] bands such as [[Funkadelic]] forming offshoot bands like [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] – formed [[Beggar & Co]]. Bluey & Tubbs went on to form Incognito. However, there has seen a re-connection over the years in Light of the World with various former members, alongside their other commitments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Incognito - About Us|url=https://www.incognito.london/incognito|access-date=6 November 2021}}</ref>

Incognito has had intermittent success in the [[UK Singles Chart]], with their breakthrough 1991 [[Chart-topper|hit]] a [[cover version]] of the [[Ronnie Laws]] tune "[[Always There (Side Effect song)|Always There]]", featuring Jocelyn Brown,<ref name="Larkin"/> which made No. 6 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /> The group's 1992 single, "[[Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing#Incognito version|Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing]]" saw similar success, reaching No. 19 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /> They have also been a favourite of various re-mixers, including [[Masters at Work]], [[David Morales]], [[Roger Sanchez]] and [[Jazzanova]], and have released several albums consisting almost entirely of [[remix]]es.

In 1994, Incognito appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s [[compilation album]], ''[[Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool]]''.  The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as 'Album of the Year' by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. In 1996, the band contributed "[[Water to Drink]]" to the AIDS-benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Rio]]'', also produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Their song "Need to Know" is the theme song for progressive radio and television news program ''[[Democracy Now!]]''.
