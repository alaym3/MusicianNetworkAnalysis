In 2009, the band released their debut album, '' In the Dream of the Sea Life'', which was inspired by [[Rachel Carson]]'s book ''[[The Sea Around Us]]''.

In 2010, the Twosyllable Records released the band's follow-up album, ''Hidden Lands'', which was inspired by [[Richard M. Ketchum]]'s ''The Secret Life of the Forest''.
