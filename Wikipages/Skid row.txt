{{short description|Impoverished urban area in North America}}A '''skid row''' or '''skid road''' is an impoverished area, typically urban, in English-speaking [[North America]] whose inhabitants are mostly poor people "[[wikt:on the skids|on the skids]]". This specifically refers to poor or homeless, either considered disreputable, downtrodden or forgotten by society.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Skid Row | journal=Collins English Dictionary – Complete & Unabridged | edition=2012 Digital | year=2012 | publisher=HarperCollins | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/skid%20row?s=t}}</ref> A skid row may be anything from an impoverished urban district to a [[red-light district]] to a gathering area for homeless people and drug addicts. In general, ''skid row'' areas are inhabited or frequented by individuals [[marginalized]] by poverty and also drug addicts. Urban areas considered skid rows are marked by high [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]], dilapidated buildings, and drug dens, as well as other features of [[urban blight]]. Used figuratively, the phrase may indicate the state of a poor person's life.

The term ''skid road'' originally referred to the path along which timber workers skidded logs.<ref name=AMHER1>{{cite web|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=skid+row&submit.x=0&submit.y=0|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition|title=Skid road|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|access-date=23 September 2015|quote=A squalid district inhabited chiefly by derelicts and vagrants.

==Origins==
The term "skid road" dates back to the 17th century, when it referred to a [[log road]], used to skid or drag logs through woods and bog.<ref name="NYTs">{{cite news|title=A Clash Over Aid Effort on the First 'Skid Row'|last=Turner|first=Wallace|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/02/us/a-clash-over-aid-effort-on-the-first-skid-row.html|newspaper=The [[New York Times]]|date=December 2, 1986|access-date=23 September 2015|page=A20}}</ref> The term was in common usage in the mid-19th century and came to refer not just to the [[corduroy road]]s themselves, but to logging camps and mills all along the [[Pacific Coast]].

The source of the term "skid road" as an urban district is heavily debated, and is generally identified as originating in either [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] or [[Vancouver]].

Henry Yesler acquired land from [[Doc Maynard]] at a small point of land at what is today near the intersection of 1st Avenue and [[Yesler Way]]. He also acquired a swath of land {{convert|450|ft}} wide, from his property up [[First Hill]] to a box of land about {{convert|10|acre}} in size, full of timber, spanning what is today 20th to 30th avenues.

The Skid Road became the demarcation line between the affluent members of Seattle and the mill workers and more rowdy portion of the population.<ref>William C. Speidel, "Sons of the Profits, The Seattle Story 1851 to 1901"</ref> The road became Mill Street, and eventually Yesler Way, but the nickname "Skid Road" was permanently associated with the district at the street's end.<ref name=SPS /> The street's end near the mill attracted [[cookhouse]]s and inexpensive hotels for itinerant workers, along with several establishments that served beer and liquor.<ref name=SPS />

==Vancouver==
{{Main article|Downtown Eastside}}
[[File:DTES Alley Culture 02.jpg|thumb|[[Downtown Eastside]]]]
The 100-block of East Hastings Street in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], the heart of that city's "skid road" neighbourhood, lies on a historical skid road.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The Vancouver Skid Road was part of a complex of such roads in the dense forests surrounding the [[Hastings Mill]] and adjacent to the settlement of Granville, Burrard Inlet ([[Gastown]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualvancouver.com/gastown.html |title=Gastown|publisher=Virtual Vancouver|access-date=2008-02-10}}</ref>

The city began as a sawmill settlement called Granville, in the early 1870s.<ref name="AVan">{{cite web |url=http://vancouver.ca/aboutvan.htm|title=About Vancouver |publisher=City of Vancouver |year=2007 |access-date=2007-01-27}}</ref> By at least the 1950s, "Skid Road" was commonly used to describe the more dilapidated areas in the city's [[Downtown Eastside]],<ref>"Demolish City's Skid Road, Murder Protest Demands." Vancouver Sun. April 6, 1962. p. 1.</ref> which is focused on the original "strip" along East Hastings Street due to a concentration of [[single room occupancy]] hotels (SROs) and associated drinking establishments in the area. The area's seedy origins date back to the early concentration of saloons in pre-Canadian Prohibition (1915–1919) and its popularity with loggers, miners and fishermen whose work was seasonal and who spent their salaries in the area's cheap accommodations and public houses.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Opium]] and [[heroin]] use became popular early on; Vancouver was for many years the main port-of-entry for the North American opium supply. During the Great Depression, the railway rights-of-way and other vacant lots in the area were thronged by the unemployed and poor, and the pattern of social decay became well-established. In the 1970s, the endemic alcohol and poverty problems in the area were exacerbated by the expansion of the drug trade, with [[crack cocaine]] becoming high-profile in the 1980s as well as a reconcentration of the prostitution trade in the area because of the relocation of hooker strolls in conjunction with city policy for [[Expo 86]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

A portion of Vancouver's Skid Row, [[Gastown]], has also been [[Gentrification|gentrified]]; however it is in a difficult coexistence with the nearby impoverished [[Downtown Eastside]] along East Hastings Street.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Downtown Eastside is deemed to be one of the poorest urban areas in [[Canada]].<ref name="Poorest">{{cite news |url=http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/909 |title=The Poorest Postal Code Vancouver's Downtown Eastside in Photos |last=Kalache |first=Stefan |publisher=The Dominion |date=January 12, 2007 |access-date=2007-10-15}}</ref> It is wedged between popular tourist destinations such as Downtown, [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]] and Gastown. East Hastings Street is also a major thoroughfare. These avenues of exposure make the Downtown Eastside a highly visible example of a skid row.

The Downtown Eastside (sometimes abbreviated D.T.E.S.) is also home to [[Insite]], the first legal [[intravenous drug]] safe injection site in North America, part of a [[harm reduction]] policy aimed at helping the area's drug addicted residents. Additional sites have been established with approval from Health Canada in 2017 and 2018 as part of the strategy for dealing with the epidemic of lethal opioid (primarily [[fentanyl]]) overdoses.

Today, the neighborhood still experiences problems with people dealing with addiction and mental health problems, as well as homelessness and public crime.<ref name="bull98">{{cite news |title= Chinatown: A bike city waiting to be reborn |last=Wagner |first=Peter |date= September 29, 1998 |work= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/98/09/29/news/story3.html |access-date= 2010-04-09 }}</ref>

==Los Angeles==
{{Main article|Skid Row, Los Angeles}}[[File:Tenting in Los Angeles Skid Row.jpg|thumb|Tents of the homeless  on the sidewalk in [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]]]]The Los Angeles Skid Row is an area on the East side of Downtown Los Angeles, roughly bounded by Los Angeles Street on the West, Central Avenue on the East, 4th Street on the North, and 8th Street on the South. The area was originally home to many cheap, low-quality hotels, popular with itinerant laborers and new arrivals to the city owing to its proximity to the train station and central location.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 24, 2021|title=History of Downtown Los Angeles|url=http://www.lachamber.com/clientuploads/LUCH_committee/102208_History_of_Skid_Row.pdf|url-status=live|website=Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce}}</ref> In an attempt to rehabilitate the area in the 1960's, most of the run-down single room occupancy hotels were demolished. This led to major reduction in the amount of very low-cost, bare minimum housing available to the area's extremely low-income population, contributing to the severe homelessness problem in the area. Skid Row was once located at the industrial periphery of Los Angeles' often neglected downtown area. As downtown has been revitalized since the 1990's and the adjacent Arts District area has gone from a desolate industrial wasteland to a major center for tourism, entertainment, and upscale housing development, Skid Row has become increasingly hemmed in by bustling, populated neighborhoods. This has contributed to a substantial increase in the density of homeless residents living on the streets in Skid Row, since many of the new residents and businesses in the surrounding areas do not want the encampments to spread.

The area is known for its high rates of open-air recreational drug use, poverty, and homelessness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiddencityphila.org/2017/09/skid-row-deaths-of-1963-echoes-todays-opioid-crisis/|title=Skid Row Deaths Of 1963 Echoes Today's Opioid Crisis|website=Hidden City Philadelphia}}</ref> A long-time camp largely hidden from public view in a gulch alongside Conrail tracks, spanning an area roughly from N 2nd Street to Kensington Avenue, was cleared in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whyy.org/articles/cleanup-work-along-philly-conrail-tracks-reaches-notorious-heroin-haven-el-campamento/|title=Cleanup work along Philly Conrail tracks reaches 'El Campamento' heroin haven}}</ref>  In late 2018, the city cleared a series of large homeless camps along Kensington Avenue, Emerald Street, Tulip Street, and Frankford Avenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inquirer.com/philly/health/addiction/philly-clears-another-kensington-heroin-encampment-20181115.html|title=As snow falls, Philly clears another Kensington heroin encampment|first=Aubrey|last=Whelan|website=inquirer.com}}</ref> The homeless population in the Kensington neighborhood alone is estimated to be over 700 individuals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inquirer.com/health/homeless-count-opioids-kensington-philadelphia-20190127.html|title=Philadelphia's annual homeless count reveals new realities about the opioid crisis|first=Aubrey|last=Whelan|website=inquirer.com}}</ref>

[[File:HoustonWards1920.jpg|thumb|<!--left-->right|1920 map of the [[six wards of Houston]]]]  In the 1800s much of what was the [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]], the present day south side of Downtown Houston. According to some, the eastern boundary is a low rent group of houses near [[Texas Southern University]] referred to as "Sugar Hill." and among musicians, the Third Ward's boundaries are usually thought of as extending southward from the junction of [[Interstate 45]] (Gulf Freeway) and [[Interstate 69]]/[[U.S. Route 59]] (Southwest Freeway) to the Brays Bayou, with Main Street forming the western boundary. The Third Ward was what Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who lectured at Rice University, referred to as "the elite neighborhood of late 19th-century Houston." Ralph Bivins of the Houston Chronicle said that Fox said that area was "a silk-stocking neighborhood of Victorian-era homes." Bivins said that the construction of Union Station, which occurred around 1910, caused the "residential character" of the area to "deteriorate." Hotels opened in the area to service travelers. Afterwards, according to Bivins, the area "began a long downward slide toward the skid row of the 1990s" and the hotels were changed into flophouses. Passenger trains stopped going to Union Station. The City of Houston abolished the ward system in the early 1900s, but the name "Third Ward" was continued to be used to refer to the territory that it used to cover.<ref name="Wood72">Wood, Roger.
