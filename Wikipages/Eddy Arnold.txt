'''Richard Edward Arnold''' (May 15, 1918 – May 8, 2008) was an American [[country music]] singer who performed for six decades. He was a [[Nashville sound]] (country/popular music) innovator of the late 1950s, and scored 147 songs on the ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' country music charts, second only to [[George Jones]]. He sold more than 85 million records. A member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] (beginning 1943) and the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] (beginning 1966), Arnold ranked 22nd on [[Country Music Television]]'s 2003 list of "The 40 Greatest Men of Country Music."

== Early years ==
Arnold was born on May 15, 1918, on a farm near [[Henderson, Tennessee]]. His father, a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]], played the [[fiddle]], while his mother played guitar. Arnold's father died when he was just 11, forcing him to leave school and begin helping on the family farm. This led to him later gaining his nickname, the '''Tennessee Plowboy'''. Arnold attended [[Pinson High School]] in [[Pinson, Tennessee]], where he played guitar for school functions and events. He quit before graduation to help with the farm work, but continued performing, often arriving on a mule with his guitar hung on his back. Arnold also worked part-time as an assistant at a [[mortuary]].<ref name="cmenc">{{cite book|last=Stambler|first=Irwin|author2=Grelun Landon |author3=Lyndon Stambler |title=Country Music: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Macmillan Publishers|year=2000|pages=17–19|isbn=978-0-312-26487-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RjfB6-nVHZIC&q=Eddy+Arnold&pg=PA17|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref>

In 1934, at age 16, Arnold made his debut on WTJS-AM in [[Jackson, Tennessee]]. He began performing at local nightclubs and was hired permanently by WTJS in 1937. In 1938, he was hired by WMPS-AM in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he was one of its most popular performers. He soon left WMPS for KWK-AM in [[St. Louis, Missouri]],<ref name="Streissguth1997">{{Cite book|first=Michael|last=Streissguth|title=Eddy Arnold: Pioneer of the Nashville Sound|publisher=Schirmer Books|location=New York|year=1997|isbn=0-02-864719-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/eddyarnoldpionee0000stre}}</ref> followed briefly by a spot at WHAS-AM in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

He performed for [[WSM (AM)]] on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] during 1943 as a solo artist.<ref name="cmenc" /> In 1944, Arnold signed a contract with [[RCA Victor]], and with manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] who would later manage [[Elvis Presley]]. Arnold's first single was little noticed,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ask.com/music/artist/Eddy-Arnold/1507 |title=What's Your Question? |publisher=Ask.com |access-date=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110013108/http://www.ask.com/music/artist/Eddy-Arnold/1507 |archive-date=January 10, 2010 }}</ref> but the next, "[[Each Minute Seems a Million Years]]", scored number five on the country charts in 1945.<ref name="cmenc" /> Its success began a decade of unprecedented chart performance; Arnold's next 57 singles all ranked in the top 10, including 19 number-one successes.<ref>"Heartaches By the Number", Cantwell, David & Friskics-Warren, Bill, 2003, Vanderbilt University Press, pg. 146</ref>

In 1946, Arnold scored his first major success with "[[That's How Much I Love You (Eddy Arnold song)|That's How Much I Love You]]". In 1948, he had five successful songs on the charts simultaneously. That year, he had nine songs in the top 10; five of these were number one and scored there for 40 of the year's 52 weeks. With Parker's management, Arnold continued to dominate, with 13 of the 20 best-scoring country music songs of 1947–1948.<ref name="cmenc" /> He became the host of [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual Radio]]'s Purina-sponsored segment of the ''Opry'' and of Mutual's ''Checkerboard Jamboree'', a midday program shared with [[Ernest Tubb]] that was broadcast from a Nashville theater.<ref name="tubb">{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=Ronnie|title=Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8223-2190-3}}<!--|access-date=July 15, 2009--></ref> Recorded radio programs increased Arnold's popularity, as did the [[CBS Radio]] series ''Hometown Reunion'' with the [[Duke of Paducah]]. Arnold quit the Opry during 1948, and his ''Hometown Reunion'' briefly broadcast in competition with the Opry on Saturday nights. In 1949 and 1950, he performed in the Columbia movies ''[[Feudin' Rhythm]]'' and ''[[Hoedown (film)|Hoedown]].''

Arnold began working for television in the early 1950s, hosting ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]''. The summer program was broadcast successively by all three television networks, replacing the [[Perry Como]] and [[The Dinah Shore Show|Dinah Shore]] programs.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Tim|last1=Brooks|first2=Earle|last2=Marsh|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1992|isbn=0-345-37792-3}}</ref> He also performed as a guest and a [[guest host]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] show ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' from 1955 to 1960.<ref>Weekly program listings (1955–1960), Triangle Publications ''[[TV Guide]]'', Vols. 3–8</ref> Arnold featured in the syndicated ''[[Eddy Arnold Time]]'' from 1955 to 1957.<ref name="Streissguth1997" /> From 1960 to 1961, he hosted [[NBC|NBC-TV]]'s ''[[Today on the Farm]]''.<ref>

== Second career: The Nashville sound ==
With the rise of [[rock and roll]] in the mid 1950s, Arnold's record sales began to decline, though fellow RCA Victor country recording artist [[Jim Reeves]] found a greater audience with popular-sounding string-laced arrangements. Arnold annoyed many in the country music establishment by recording with [[Hugo Winterhalter]] and his Orchestra at the RCA Victor studios in New York. Winterhalter's pop-oriented arrangements of "[[The Cattle Call]]" and "The Richest Man (in the World)", however, helped to expand Arnold's appeal beyond its country music base.<ref name="encm">{{cite book|last=Rumble|first=John|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00coun|url-access=registration|editor=Paul Kingsbury|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-511671-7}}</ref> This style, pioneered by Reeves and Arnold, became known as the "[[Nashville Sound]]".<ref name="encm" /> During 1953, Arnold and Tom Parker had a dispute, and Arnold fired him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Ed |date=2016 |title=The History of Rock & Roll, volume one, 1920–1963

Arnold embarked on a second career that brought his music to a more diverse audience. In the summer of 1965, he had his first number-one country song in 10 years, "[[What's He Doing in My World]]" and struck gold again six months later with the song that became his most well-known, "[[Make the World Go Away]]", accompanied by pianist [[Floyd Cramer]] on piano and featuring the [[Anita Kerr Singers]]. As a result, Arnold's rendition became an international success. "Make The World Go Away" became his only top ten pop hit.<ref name="encm" />

Bill Walker's orchestra arrangements provided the lush background for 16 continuous successes sung by Arnold in the late 1960s. Arnold performed with [[orchestra|symphony orchestras]] in New York City, Las Vegas, and Hollywood. He performed in [[Carnegie Hall]] for two concerts, and in the Coconut Grove in Las Vegas.<ref name="encm" /> In 1966, Arnold was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], the youngest performer to receive the honor.<ref name="country music">{{cite news|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/norwich/entertainment/music/x647002031/Country-star-Eddy-Arnold-dies|title=Country legend Eddy Arnold dies|agency=Associated Press|date=May 8, 2008|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|access-date=July 15, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The following year, Arnold was voted the first-ever awarded [[Country Music Association]]'s Entertainer of the Year.<ref name="cmaawards">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cma/archives/1967.jhtml|title=CMA Awards Ceremonies|year=2009|publisher=Country Music Association|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> Two years later, he released an autobiography named ''It's A Long Way From Chester County''.<ref name="autobio">{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Eddy|title=It's A Long Way From Chester County|url=https://archive.org/details/itslongwayfromch00arno|url-access=registration|publisher=Hewitt House|location=Old Tappan, New Jersey|year=1969}}</ref>

Having been with RCA Victor since 1944, Arnold left the label in 1973 for [[MGM Records]], where he recorded four albums, which included several top-40 successes. He returned to RCA in 1976 and recorded for the company for the remainder of his career.<ref name="cmenc" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html | title = List of famous freemasons | website = freemasonry.bcy.ca | access-date = September 30, 2018 | language = en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20011004153632/http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html | quotation = East Nashville No. 560, TN [19]| archive-date = October 4, 2001 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author1 = al Manhal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Qc5aDwAAQBAJ&q=%22Lodge+No.+560+Nashville+TN.+%22%2BAcuff%2BRoy&pg=PA231 | title = Initiation in Freemasonry | language = ar | year = 2009 | access-date = September 30, 2018 | page = 231 |isbn = 9796500150710}}</ref>

== Later years and death ==
During the 1980s, Arnold declared himself semiretired, but he continued recording. In 1984, the [[Academy of Country Music]] awarded Arnold its Pioneer Award. His next album, ''You Don't Miss A Thing'', was not released until 1991.<ref name="cmenc" /> Arnold performed road tours for several more years.<ref name="1991return">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RTEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3056,1023370&dq=eddy+arnold|title=Eddy Arnold resumes his singing career|date=February 7, 1991|publisher=Saint Petersburg Times|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> By 1992, he had sold nearly 85 million records, and had a total of 145 weeks of number-one songs, more than any other singer.<ref name="cmenc" />

In 1996, RCA issued an album of Arnold's main successes since 1944 as part of its 'Essential' series.<ref name="cmenc" /> Arnold, then 78 years old, retired from active singing, though he still performed occasionally.<ref name="encm" /> On May 16, 1998, the day after his 80th birthday, he announced his final retirement during a concert at the Hotel Orleans in Las Vegas.<ref name="retire">{{cite news|title=Calling It Quits|last=Paskevich|first=Michael|date=May 14, 1999|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}</ref> That same year, the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] inducted the recording of "Make The World Go Away" into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].

Arnold died from natural causes on May 8, 2008, in a care facility in Nashville, one week before his 90th birthday. His wife of 66 years, Sally Gayhart Arnold, had preceded him in death by two months. They were survived by two children (Richard E. Arnold, Jr., and JoAnn Arnold Pollard), two grandchildren (K. Michelle Pollard and R. Shannon Pollard, Jr.), and four great-grandchildren (Katie E.

On May 31, 2008, RCA released "To Life" as a single from the album ''After All These Years''. It debuted at number 49 on the Hot Country Songs charts, Arnold's first entry in 25 years and the recording by the oldest person to chart in ''Billboard'' magazine. It set the record for the longest span between a first chart single and a last: 62 years and 11 months ("Each Minute Seems Like a Million Years" debuted on June 30, 1945), and extended Arnold's career chart history to seven decades.<ref name="arnold">{{cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1587711/eddy-arnolds-to-life-stretches-into-seventh-decade.jhtml|title=Eddy Arnold's "To Life" Stretches Chart Success Into Seventh Decade|date=May 19, 2008|publisher=Country Music Television|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref>
