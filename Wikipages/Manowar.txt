'''Manowar''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ryeberg.com/curated-videos/heavy-metal-case-study-1-manowar/|title=Heavy Metal Case Study #1: Manowar by Ernest Hilbert|website=Ryeberg Curated Video}}</ref> band from [[Auburn, New York]]. Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] (particularly [[sword and sorcery]]) and mythology (particularly [[Norse mythology]] and [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]]), as well as numerous songs celebrating the genre and [[Heavy metal subculture|its core audience]]. The band is also known for a loud and emphatic sound. In an interview for [[MTV]] in February 2007, bassist [[Joey DeMaio]] lamented that "these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and [[choir]]s and [[orchestra]]s... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that".<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Chris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1552016/20070208/manowar.jhtml |title=MTV interview, February 2007 |website=Mtv.com |date=February 9, 2007 |access-date=October 10, 2011}}</ref> In 1984, the band was included in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] for delivering the [[Loudest band|loudest performance]], a record which they have since broken on two occasions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/who-loudest-band/|title=who-loudest-band|website=Ultimateclassicrock}}</ref> They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for five hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria (at [[Kavarna Rock Fest]]) in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=100401 |title=Manowar Attempts To Break Guinness Record With Five-Hour Concert |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812230851/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=100401 |archive-date=August 12, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/news.php?newsid=6798 |title=Manowar Play Longest Show Ever |website=Sputnikmusic.com |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> They also have been known for their slogan "Death to false metal".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wong |first=David |url=http://www.cracked.com/funny-3701-manowar/ |title=Manowar |website=Cracked.com |access-date=November 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manowar.com/news_body.php?idnews=567 |title=The Kingdom Of Steel |website=Manowar.com |date=January 13, 2012 |access-date=November 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419154325/https://www.manowar.com/news_body.php?idnews=567 |archive-date=April 19, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tbns.net/manowar/me.html |title=Me |website=Tbns.net |access-date=November 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127233323/http://www.tbns.net/manowar/me.html |archive-date=November 27, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although the band has never been a mainstream commercial success in the United States{{fact|date=November 2021}}, they maintain a strong cult following.

==Biography==
[[File:2002.11.18 manowar bercy eric adams 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Frontman Eric Adams in 2002]]

===Origins (1980–1981)===
Manowar's history began in 1980 when [[Joey DeMaio]], the future bassist of the band, met guitarist [[Ross the Boss]] while working as a bass tech and fireworks manager for [[Black Sabbath]] on the [[Heaven & Hell Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbloodysabbath.it/curiosita/Page-4.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071227102841/http://www.blackbloodysabbath.it/curiosita/Page-4.html |archive-date=December 27, 2007 }}</ref> Ross the Boss, a former member of the [[punk rock]] band [[the Dictators]], was the guitar player in Black Sabbath's support band, Shakin' Street. The two bonded over their shared musical interests, became friends and decided to form a band with the suggestion and advice of [[Ronnie James Dio]] during the tour.
At the end of the tour with Black Sabbath, the duo got together to form Manowar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/wheretostartwith/artists/manowar |title=Manowar - Where to Start with |publisher=Kerrang |date=July 8, 2008 |access-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629150216/https://www.kerrang.com/wheretostartwith/artists/manowar |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref> To complete the roster, they hired drummer [[Donnie Hamzik]] and singer [[Eric Adams (musician)|Eric Adams]], a former classmate and friend of DeMaio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DdVSPVgowW0/T5LSB5-sBdI/AAAAAAAAAHI/LzCyaqv2Iuo/s640/81.jpg |format=JPG |title=Shell Shock : Battle Hymn : Demo 1981 |website=3.bp.blogspot.com |access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref> The name Manowar was suggested to Joey DeMaio and Ross the Boss by their instrument designer, John "Dawk" Stillwell.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 13, 2021|title=Intervista Ross The Boss (Ross "The Boss" Friedman) - truemetal.it|url=https://www.truemetal.it/heavy-metal-news/intervista-ross-the-boss-ross-the-boss-friedman-1065250|access-date=September 13, 2021|website=True Metal|language=it-IT}}</ref>

===''Battle Hymns'' (1981–1982)===
On the strength of their debut demo, Manowar secured a recording contract with label [[Liberty Records]] in 1981. The label pressured the band to produce a good number of songs in a short time towards a debut album. The resultant album, ''[[Battle Hymns (Manowar album)|Battle Hymns]]'', was released the following year. The legendary actor and director [[Orson Welles]] served in the role of narrator on "Dark Avenger".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |url={{AllMusic|class=album |id=r12378 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Battle Hymns - Manowar |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

Soon after the album's release, Manowar engaged in their first tour. The band played support for hard rocker [[Ted Nugent]], but their collaboration lasted only a few months.
Manowar then decided to put together a short tour by themselves and all the arrangements were made in a few weeks by their manager. Despite these setbacks, the band gained domestic fame on this short tour and also began to get their first European fans, particularly in the United Kingdom and in Germany. Stressed from the strain of the continuing performances, Hamzik decided to leave the band at the end of this tour and was replaced with [[Scott Columbus]].

===''Into Glory Ride'' and mainstream success (1983–1988)===
By 1983, the band left Liberty Records and struck a deal with [[Megaforce Records]] in the US and [[Music for Nations]] in Europe—signing the contract in their own blood. The signing was a cover story in the 1983 July–August issue No. 47 of ''[[Kerrang!]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Male Orientated Rock |journal=[[Kerrang!]] |date=July 28, 1983 |last=Bonutto |first=Dante |issue=47 |url=http://www.gillyon.com/manowar_k47.htm |access-date=May 1, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110141/http://www.gillyon.com/manowar_k47.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>

When Manowar returned home, they immediately went into a recording studio to produce what, in the intentions of the group, would have been a simple [[Extended play|EP]], but came out instead, due to the quantity and quality of the tracks made in that period, as the band's second album, ''[[Into Glory Ride]]''. An EP was actually published in 1983 with the title ''Defender'' containing, as its main track, the eponymous song, which included more work by Orson Welles. The atmosphere of the album evoked classical [[heroic fantasy]] and mythology, and served as a predecessor to [[Viking metal]]. It contained several innovative features,{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} both in style and sound, and led to a huge increase{{Vague|date=December 2016}} in the number of fans of the group, particularly in the United Kingdom, where the band planned a long tour that was ultimately canceled. The song "Defender" was later re-recorded and included in the ''[[Fighting the World]]'' album of 1987.

To apologize for the failure of their UK tour, Manowar decided to dedicate their next album to the United Kingdom. The album, ''[[Hail to England]]'', was recorded and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in just six days and was released in early 1984. Its promotional tour, "Spectacle of Might", had a large number{{Vague|date=December 2016}} of dates in England. The tour saw Manowar initially as support band for [[Mercyful Fate]], but soon the group led by DeMaio was put in the headline slot.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Manowar soon returned to work in the recording studio. After leaving Music for Nations, the quartet released ''[[Sign of the Hammer]]'' ten months after their previous album. The new record presented stark changes in rhythm, with very technical tracks characterized by a slow pace, like the epic "Mountains", and quick ones, as the eponymous "Sign of the Hammer". Its success enabled band to embark on a two-year world tour, after which they took 1986 off.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Following further disagreements with their new label, the group changed record label to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1987. Via Atlantic, they released ''[[Fighting the World]]'', which enjoyed more extensive distribution and increased the band's prominence in the international heavy metal scene. Album art was designed by [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Voger |title=Criss eager to meet television idol Zacherley |work=[[Asbury Park Press]] |page=6E |date=October 22, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Manowar truck to make its debut in Austria this weekend |work=Austria Today |date=September 8, 2006}}</ref>

In 1988, Manowar released the album ''[[Kings of Metal]]'', which is the band's best known work. Songs like "Heart of Steel", "Kings of Metal" and "Hail and Kill" are performed regularly in concerts. ''Kings of Metal'' is Manowar's highest-selling album worldwide.

Manowar embarked on a world tour, for a period of approximately three years, with stops in almost all European nations. During that tour, Joey DeMaio "fired" Ross the Boss. According to a 2008 interview with the guitarist, "Joey felt that Manowar would be better without me".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=2400&type=1&lang=EN |title=Interviews - Ross The Boss |website=Rockpages.gr |access-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211614/https://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=2400&type=1&lang=EN |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[David Shankle]], who was chosen by members of the band after a search among about 150 candidates. Scott Columbus later also decided to leave the band during the Kings of Metal tour. Columbus himself picked his replacement [[Kenny Earl|Kenny Earl Edwards]] (soon nicknamed 'Rhino').

===New albums, first video, and live publications (1992–2002)===
[[File:2002.11.18 manowar bercy karl logan 1.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Karl Logan in 2002]]
A new musical unit after the recent changes, Manowar released ''[[The Triumph of Steel]]'' in 1992. It gained some success and was particularly famous for the presence of a suite lasting no less than 28 minutes entitled "Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts", inspired by the events of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the hero [[Achilles]]. After this release, the band went on a world tour for two years. After the expiration of their contract with Atlantic, the band signed with [[Geffen Records]]. In 1994, Shankle unexpectedly left the band to form his own group. He was replaced by [[Karl Logan]], a musician met by DeMaio during a motor meeting.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.metalinsider.net/columns/remember-when-manowars-karl-logan-was-in-a-hair-metal-band |title=Remember when Manowar's Karl Logan was in a hair metal band? |last=Uricheck |first=Mark |date=May 17, 2017 |website=Metalinsider.net |language=en-US |access-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref> The same year saw the unexpected return of Scott Columbus, who replaced Edwards.

In 1996, they released ''[[Louder Than Hell (Manowar album)|Louder Than Hell]]'', their first new studio album in four years. Despite good sales the album was criticized for its simple style.

Despite such criticisms, Manowar released a new collection, called ''[[Anthology (Manowar album)|Anthology]]'', and their first live album, ''[[Hell on Wheels (album)|Hell on Wheels]]'', released by [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG International]] in the guise of a double CD containing all the most popular songs of the group. Not having the time to record a new studio album because of the ongoing promotional tour, Manowar released a second live album, ''[[Hell on Stage]]''.

===''Warriors of the World'', ''Hell on Earth'', and Magic Circle Music (2002–2005)===

In 2002, six years after the last studio album, Manowar released the ''[[Warriors of the World]]'' album. ''Warriors of the World'' presented a sound somewhat renewed in style, but maintained the usual energy and power. The most famous tracks from the album became "Warriors of the World United", "House of Death" and "Call to Arms", in addition to [[Puccini]]'s aria "[[Nessun Dorma]]", covered in honor of the Italian fans and sung live for the first time in a concert in [[Milan]], Italy.

Manowar then began a long world tour, called "Warriors of the World United Tour" that kept them busy and away from a recording studio for a long time. To compensate for the lack of studio albums, the band released several DVDs: in 2002 the video ''[[Fire and Blood (Manowar)|Fire and Blood]]'', in 2003 ''Hell on Earth Part III'' and in 2005 ''Hell on Earth Part IV''. These (and all DVDs since the year 2000) were directed by [[Neil Johnson (director)|Neil Johnson]], and have all been certified Gold in Germany.

In 2003, DeMaio founded his own record label, [[Magic Circle Music]], which became the official home of the band, having been created to fit the needs of Manowar, and other bands of similar genre. Under the label Magic Circle were also released the EP ''[[The Sons of Odin]]'' with footage taken during the Earthshaker Fest 2005.

===''Gods of War'' and ''Thunder in the Sky'' (2006–2009)===
[[File:manowar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Manowar in [[Hamburg]] during their 2007 tour]]
Manowar released ''[[Gods of War (Manowar album)|Gods of War]]'' through Magic Circle Music in 2007. After playing numerous shows in Europe, including a concert that spanned the course of two nights, they worked on a new EP, entitled ''[[Thunder in the Sky]]'', which was released in 2009. The EP consisted of two discs: the first playing the regular track list; the second playing the song "Father" in fifteen different languages.

===Scott Columbus' death, ''Battle Hymns MMXI'', and ''The Lord of Steel'' (2010–2013)===
On June 1, 2010, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine published an interview with drummer Scott Columbus who said that he had not worked with the band since April 2008 and had left the band. He also said that statements made in the past, regarding his break in 1990 and 2008 because of an illness and a personal tragedy, were largely untrue and were made without his agreement.<ref name="example web reference">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/scott-columbus-why-i-left-manowar/ |title=Scott Columbus: Why I Left Manowar &#124; Features, News, Top Posts |work=Classic Rock |access-date=November 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119023918/https://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/scott-columbus-why-i-left-manowar/ |archive-date=November 19, 2012 }}</ref> On October 15, 2010, Joey DeMaio announced on [[Facebook]] that Hamzik was officially a member of Manowar again after a 26-year absence.

On April 4, 2011, Columbus died at the age of 54.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=156340 |title=Former Manowar Drummer Scott Columbus Dead At 54 |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823131839/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=156340 |archive-date=August 23, 2011 }}</ref> On April 5, 2020, Columbus' daughter Teresa publicly announced that her father's cause of death was suicide, and urged for more awareness on mental illness and depression.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Remembering-Scott-Columbus-137145279691831/ |title=Remembering Scott Columbus Facebook Page |website=[[Facebook]] |access-date=April 21, 2020 }}</ref>

Manowar's subsequent release was a re-recording of their 1982 debut album ''Battle Hymns''. This album was released on November 26, 2010, with the narration of [[Sir Christopher Lee]] and formally entitled ''[[Battle Hymns MMXI]]''. On July 21, 2011, the band embarked on a UK tour for the first time in 16 years in November and performed the ''Battle Hymns'' album in its entirety.

Manowar's next studio album, ''[[The Lord of Steel]]'', was released worldwide on June 16, 2012, exclusively on [[iTunes]] and on the band's own online store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asgard-saga.com/ |title=The web community dedicated to the first interactive fantasy adventure by Manowar and Wolfgang Hohlbein! |website=Asgard-saga.com |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> The album sees a reversion from the symphonic elements present on the ''Gods of War'' album back to a more straightforward, heavy metal sound. The song "El Gringo" is featured in the soundtrack to the film [[El Gringo|of the same name]].

After the Lord of Steel tour was over in 2013, Manowar released a live EP, titled ''[[The Lord of Steel Live]]'', which included six live tracks recorded during the tour.

===''Kings of Metal MMXIV'' (2013–2014)===
On July 28, 2013, Manowar announced that they would be re-recording their 1988 release ''Kings of Metal'' with an expected release date of late 2013. [[Brian Blessed]] recorded his narration for the track "The Warrior's Prayer" at Circle (Recording) Studios in [[Birmingham]], England. Like the re-recording of ''Battle Hymns MMXI'', this album allowed the band to use modern day technology.

''[[Kings of Metal MMXIV]]'' was released through iTunes as a digital download on February 4, 2014. Hard copies of the album were released on February 28.

== The Faceless Warrior ==
The Faceless Warrior, also known as "The King of Metal", is the band's mascot. The character first appeared in 1988 on the cover of the album ''[[Kings of Metal|Kings Of Metal]]'', and has since appeared in the cover artwork of almost every following Manowar album, as well as on merchandise and in almost every Manowar live show to follow.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Post- The Faceless Warrior |url=https://www.facebook.com/120910203516/posts/the-faceless-warrior-also-known-as-the-king-of-metal-first-appeared-on-the-kings/10156719149413517/  |website=Facebook.com|access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref>

In a May 2002 interview with Metal-Rules.com, vocalist [[Eric Adams (musician)|Eric Adams]] was asked, "Who is that guy in your album cover? Do you have any name for him?". He replied, "No because he is you, he is her, he is this person he is that person and so on. He has no face and that was in [sic] purpose because everyone needs a heroes [sic] in their life and our music is all about heroes and you know being the leader not the follower. It's picture [sic] of hero and you being that hero is that what it is all about. So there is no real name for it. It's a fantasy world man. Put your face there are you are the hero!"<ref>{{cite web  |title=Interview With Eric Adams of Manowar - A True King of Metal |url=https://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/Manowar-WarriorsInFinland.htm |website=Metal-rules.com|access-date=May 12, 2002}}</ref>

== The Sign of the Hammer ==
"The Sign of the Hammer" is a cultural gesture developed in the early years of the band, after the release of their [[Sign of the Hammer|fourth album]] of the same name, and serves as a signature of the band. The sign is most likely to have been shaped from the vocalist [[Eric Adams (musician)|Eric Adams]].  It is formed by raising a right fist above the head, while using the left hand to grab the back of the right wrist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Heilbronner Stimme |first1=Heilbronner Stimme |title=The Loudest band in the world |url=https://www.stimme.de/heilbronn/kultur/Die-lauteste-Band-der-Welt;art11930,980646 |website=stimme.de |publisher=Heilbronner Stimme |access-date=April 2, 2007}}</ref> The Media Company "Heilbronner Stimme" published an article describing the Sign of the Hammer as, "the striking greeting. A gesture that unites. A gesture that fits the pathos of the self-proclaimed [[Kings of Metal|kings of metal]]. A gesture that has become the [[trademark]] of the group founded in 1980".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Heilbronner Stimme |first1=Heilbronner Stimme |title=The loudest band in the world |url=https://www.stimme.de/heilbronn/kultur/Die-lauteste-Band-der-Welt;art11930,980646 |website=stimme.de |publisher=Heilbronner Stimme |access-date=April 2, 2007}}</ref>

The first official appearance of the gesture was on the front cover of the band's fifth album, ''[[Fighting the World|Fighting the world]]'', where vocalist Eric Adams is shown making the gesture in a drawing of the band members.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Manowar – The Official Manowar Website |first1=Fighting The World |title=Manowar- Records |url=https://manowar.com/music/fighting-the-world/ |website=Manowar – The Official Manowar Website |publisher=Manowar – The Official Manowar Website}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ken Kelly |title=Manowar art |url=https://www.kenkellyfantasyart.com/manowar.html |website=Ken Kelly Art.com - The Homepage of Fantasy Artist Ken Kelly |publisher=Ken Kelly Art.com - The Homepage of Fantasy Artist Ken Kelly}}</ref>  The gesture then appeared in the official music video for ''[[Blow Your Speakers|Blow your speakers]]'', shown being made by the band members and crowd during a concert, as well as in the full cover art of the album ''[[The Triumph of Steel|The triumph of steel]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=All Music- Manowar |first1=The Triumph Of Steel |title=Manowar- Album: The Triumph Of Steel |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/the-triumph-of-steel-mr0005032991 |website=All Music |publisher=All Music}}</ref> Since then, the sign has been featured in almost every official music video of the band.<ref>{{cite web |last1=METAL MUSIC ARCHIVES |title=Manowar- Blow your speakers- Online video |url=http://www.metalmusicarchives.com/video/manowar/18565 |website=METALMUSICARCHIVES.COM |publisher=METALMUSICARCHIVES.COM}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Manowar – The Official Manowar Website |title=War Chest: 'Blow Your Speakers' Video |url=https://manowar.com/war-chest-blow-your-speakers-video/ |website=Manowar – The Official Manowar Website |publisher=Manowar – The Official Manowar Website}}</ref>
