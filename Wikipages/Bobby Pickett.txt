'''Robert George Pickett''' (February 11, 1938 &ndash; April 25, 2007), known also by the name '''Bobby "Boris" Pickett''', was an American singer, songwriter, actor and comedian known for co-writing and performing the 1962 [[Chart-topper|hit]] [[novelty song]] "[[Monster Mash]]".<ref name="BPS"/>

==Early life==
Pickett was born in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], on February 11, 1938.<ref name="BBP"/> His family lived in the [[Winter Hill, Somerville, Massachusetts|Winter Hill]] neighborhood and he attended Somerville High School.<ref>{{cite news| title=Bobby "Boris" Pickett remembered on our first Halloween without him| url=https://www.pjstar.com/article/20071031/NEWS/310319971| last=Guha| first=Auditi| date=October 31, 2007| newspaper=[[Journal Star (Peoria)|Journal Star]]| location=Peoria, Ill| access-date=June 25, 2020}}</ref> His father was a theater manager and as a nine-year-old, he watched many horror films. He would later incorporate impressions of them in his [[Hollywood]] [[nightclub]] act in 1959. An aspiring actor, Pickett began his musical career as a vocalist for a local swing band, Darren Bailes and the Wolf Eaters. Pickett served in the [[United States Army]] from March 9, 1956 to March 13, 1959, and was stationed in [[Korean War|Korea]] for an unknown period of time.<ref>{{cite report |title=Robert Pickett, 11 February 1938 |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |series=Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem }}</ref>

==Career==
Pickett co-wrote "[[Monster Mash]]" with Leonard Capizzi in May 1962. The song was a spoof on the dance crazes popular at the time, including the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]] and the [[Mashed Potato (dance)|Mashed Potato]], which inspired the title. The song featured Pickett's impersonations of veteran horror stars [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Bela Lugosi]] (the latter with the line "Whatever happened to my [[Transylvania]] Twist?"). Every major record label declined the song, but after hearing it, [[Gary S. Paxton]] agreed to produce and engineer it; among the musicians who played on it was pianist [[Leon Russell]]. Issued on Paxton's [[Garpax Records]], the single became a million seller, reaching number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for two weeks before [[Halloween]] in 1962.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first=Joseph| last=Murrells| year=1978| title=The Book of Golden Discs| edition=2nd| publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location=London| page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/150 150]| isbn=978-0214204807| url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/150}}</ref> It was styled as being by "Bobby (Boris) Pickett and the Crypt-Kickers". The track re-entered the U.S. charts twice, in August 1970, and again in May 1973, when it reached the #10 spot. In [[Great Britain|Britain]] it took until October 1973 for the tune to become popular, peaking at number 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first=David| last=Roberts| year=2006| title=British Hit Singles & Albums| edition=19th| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited| location=London| isbn=978-1904994008| page=426}}</ref> For the second time, the record sold over one million copies.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book| first=Joseph| last=Murrells| year=1978| title=The Book of Golden Discs| edition=2nd| publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= ≠[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/333 333]| isbn=978-0214204807| url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/333}}</ref> The tune remains a Halloween perennial on [[radio]] and on [[iTunes]]. A [[Christmas]]-themed follow-up, "Monster's Holiday", (with "Monster Motion" on the B side) was also released in 1962 and reached number 30 in December that year. "Blood Bank Blues" (with "Me and My Mummy" on the B side) did not chart. This was followed by further monster-themed recordings such as the album ''[[The Original Monster Mash]]'' and such singles as "Werewolf Watusi" and "The Monster Swim". In 1973, Pickett rerecorded "Me and My Mummy" for a Metromedia 45 (it did not chart). Another of Pickett's songs, "Graduation Day", made number 80 in June 1963. In 1985, with American culture experiencing a growing awareness of rap music, Pickett released "Monster Rap", which describes the mad scientist's frustration at being unable to teach the dancing monster from "Monster Mash" how to talk. The problem is solved when he teaches the monster to rap.

===Further parodies===
In 1975, Pickett recorded a novelty [[parody|spoof]] on ''[[Star Trek]]'' called "Star Drek" with Peter Ferrara, again performing some of the various voices, which was played on [[Dr. Demento]]'s radio show for many years. He also performed a duet with Ferrara in 1976 titled "King Kong (Your Song)" spoofing the movie by the same name that was released that year.

In the early 1980s a musical "sequel" to "Monster Mash" called "Monster Rap" was released, which featured Pickett teaching the creature to speak through "rapping". Though not nearly as popular as the original "Monster Mash", it once again found a reasonable following with the Dr. Demento fanbase.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1993, Pickett wrote and performed "It's Alive", another sequel of sorts to the original "Mash" song. It did not chart but was played occasionally on the Demento show.

In 2004 and 2005, Pickett provided vocals for two Flash cartoons, "Monster Slash" and "Climate Mash", featuring new versions of his hit single. The cartoons protested inaction on the [[United States]] government's part towards [[deforestation]] and [[climate change|global warming]].

==Record label venture==
In 1962, it was reported in the December 1 issue of ''Cashbox'' that Pickett along with Ned Ormand and R.B. Chris Christensen had formed Nico Records. Christensen had been a partner and professional manager in [[Buck Owens|Buck Owens']] Bluebook Music Publishing co.<ref name=cashbox/><ref>{{cite magazine| magazine=[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]| date=December 26, 1960| page=36| title=Folk Talent and Tunes| first=Bill| last=Sachs| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nB0EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22R.+B.+Chris+Christensen%22&pg=PA36}}</ref> They had acquired an instrumental from the Daco label which was to be their first release. The instrumental was by [[The Revels]] of "[[Church Key]]" and "Six Pak" fame.<ref name=cashbox>{{cite magazine| magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]| date=December 1, 1962| url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox24unse_10/page/n31?q=%22The+Revels%22Church+Key%22| page=30B| title=Pickett A Partner In New Disk Firm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Real Life Rock: The Complete Top Ten Columns, 1986-2014| first=Greil| last=Marcus| date=20 October 2015| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XWhCgAAQBAJ&q=%22The+Revels%22Church+Key%22Six+Pak%22&pg=PA403| page=403| isbn=9780300218596| quote=9.
