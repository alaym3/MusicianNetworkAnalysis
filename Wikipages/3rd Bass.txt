'''3rd Bass''' was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group that was active in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Formed by [[MC Serch]], [[Pete Nice]], and [[DJ Richie Rich]], the group was notable for being one of the first successful interracial hip hop acts. Along with fellow [[Beastie Boys]] and producer [[Rick Rubin]], both MC Serch and Pete Nice were one of the very few white hip hop artists who were widely respected in the community.<ref name="AllMusic Cactus"/> The group dissolved in 1992 and again in 2000 and 2013 after short reunions. The group released two studio albums in their initial career and both of them were certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/?s=3rd+bass| title= 3rd Bass |work=Gold & Platinum Database| publisher= Recording Industry Association of America| via= RIAA.com| access-date= June 1, 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
[[MC Serch]] ('''Michael Berrin'''), [[Pete Nice|Prime Minister Pete Nice]] ('''Peter J. Nash'''), and [[DJ Richie Rich]] ('''Richard Lawson''') were the three founding members of the group. Richie Rich was a local D.J., while Nice was an English major at [[Columbia University]] and hosted a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] show on Columbia's student radio station, [[WKCR-FM]]. Serch performed at clubs and block parties, and released a single called "Hey Boy" on independent label Idlers.

The two first performed as '3 the Hard Way', a name referenced in the song "Wordz of Wisdom" but later redubbed themselves '3rd Bass' before recording their first album. Sever, [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]], and [[the Bomb Squad]] produced their 1989 debut, ''[[The Cactus Album]]'', a critically acclaimed LP that went gold and contained a minor hit in "The Gas Face."<ref name="AllMusic Cactus">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-cactus-album-mw0000202624 |title=The Cactus Album – 3rd Bass |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |last=Swihart |first=Stanton}}</ref> The accompanying video, which featured a bevy of humorous cameo appearances that included a young [[MF Doom]], [[DJ Subroc]], [[Gilbert Gottfried]], [[Flavor Flav]], [[Salt-n-Pepa]], [[Kid 'N Play]] and [[EPMD]], garnered respectable MTV airplay and the single peaked at #5 on Billboard's [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Top Rap Singles]], though it did not chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The video also contained insults aimed at rapper [[MC Hammer]] and record executive [[Lyor Cohen]].

As reported in many interviews, Serch had tried (unsuccessfully) to join up with fellow New Yorkers the [[Beastie Boys]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Upon signing with [[Def Jam]], 3rd Bass inherited their label's feud with the Beasties. ''The Cactus Album'' was released shortly after the Beastie Boys—riding high on the success of ''[[Licensed to Ill]]''—walked out of their contract with the label.<ref name="Year">{{cite web|author=Stereo Williams|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-year-that-changed-hip-hop-forever|title=The Year That Changed Hip-Hop Forever|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=2018-02-28|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref> In addition to containing multiple potshots directed at [[M.C. Hammer]] (referred to as "M.C. Household Tool" in the liner notes), ''Cactus'' also attacked the Beastie Boys and their defection to [[Capitol Records]].

3rd Bass's 1991 follow-up, ''[[Derelicts of Dialect]]'', had a new target in fellow white rapper [[Vanilla Ice]], who was the focal point of several tracks on the album, most notably "[[Pop Goes the Weasel (3rd Bass song)|Pop Goes the Weasel]]". The track depicted Ice as a culture thief who watered down the sound of rap in order to pander to a mainstream audience, while depicting 3rd Bass as more respectful of the genre's traditions. Ice was also criticized for his refusal to credit artists whose music he had sampled for his 1990 smash "[[Ice Ice Baby]]." The video featured [[punk rock]] icon [[Henry Rollins]] dressed up as Ice, who received a "beatdown" by 3rd Bass at the end.

Fueled by the heavy backlash against Vanilla Ice at the time of its release, "Pop Goes the Weasel" reached #1 on Billboard's Top Rap Singles chart, gave the group their only Top 30 single (peaking at #29 on the Hot 100), and helped propel the album to [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] status. The track was described by Allmusic as "much-needed damage control in the hip-hop community," in part because it featured Caucasian rappers openly distancing themselves from one of their peers.<ref name="allmusic">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p50061|pure_url=yes}} 3rd Bass Biography] - Allmusic.com</ref> Vanilla Ice answered back with 'The Wrath' and 'Hit 'em Hard' which he played at concerts in 1992, though the songs weren't officially released until 1994.

3rd Bass's final collaboration was the title track to the soundtrack of the 1992 film ''[[Gladiator (1992 film)|Gladiator]]'' before the group called it quits. That same year—three years after ''The Cactus Album''—the Beastie Boys retaliated against 3rd Bass on ''[[Check Your Head]]''; the track "Professor Booty" contained the lyric "dancing around like you think you're [[Janet Jackson]]," which was interpreted as a swipe at Serch's dancing in 3rd Bass's videos.

==Breakup==
In 1992, Serch co-wrote and produced several tracks for Detroit rapper [[Boss (rapper)|Boss]]'s only album, ''[[Born Gangstaz]].'' He released a solo record, ''[[Return of the Product]]'', in August of that year, which included the second major label recording of [[Nasir Jones|Nas]] (credited in the liner notes as "Nasty Nas") and featured the single "Back To The Grill Again." Meanwhile, Nice and Rich teamed up as Prime Minister Pete Nice & Daddy Rich, and released their only album, ''[[Dust to Dust (Pete Nice and DJ Richie Rich album)|Dust to Dust]]'' in 1993. The leadoff single, "Rat Bastard," contained voice samples from ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' and was rumored to reflect bad blood between the pair and Serch, though it was not confirmed. The follow-up was "Kick the Bobo," which received light airplay on [[MTV]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] but was unable to become a sizeable hit. Neither Nice nor Serch were able to achieve much popularity on their own after 3rd Bass disbanded.

Around the time of the split, Serch was involved with the production of the movie ''[[Zebrahead (film)|Zebrahead]]''. As recalled by actor [[Michael Rapaport]], Serch originally wanted to star in the film but was unable to secure the role, and ended up producing the film's soundtrack instead. After serving a stint at now-defunct [[Wild Pitch Records]], he founded Serchlite, a record label and publishing company responsible for signing another group of white New York hip-hop artists, [[Non Phixion]] (who broke up in 2006).

3rd Bass reunited for a gig at the birthday party of Andy Hilfiger (brother of [[Tommy Hilfiger]]) in 1998. They also performed at [[Woodstock 1999]], and released a non-charting single, "Hail to the Chief." There had also been talks of a new album entitled ''Ichabod’s Cranium'', but any long-term reunion and album plans were ultimately scrapped.

Nice retired from the music business and opened a baseball [[sports memorabilia|memorabilia]] store in [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He published a book, ''Baseball Legends of Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery,'' under his real name in 2003,<ref name="arcadia">[http://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=arcadia&Product_Code=0738534781&Product_Count=&Category_Code= Arcadia Publishing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025055442/http://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=arcadia&Product_Code=0738534781&Product_Count=&Category_Code= |date=October 25, 2007 }}
</ref> in addition to attempting to secure property for an official gravesite of [[Negro league]] players. Serch hosted the [[VH1]] reality TV series ''Ego Trip's [[The White Rapper Show]]''. Nash also produced a documentary about the [[Royal Rooters|Rooters]], with interviews filmed in an old gas station in Cooperstown that he was turning into a museum of baseball fan history stocked with much of the memorabilia he was gathering.<ref name="rtr">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/the_bonus/12/09/nash/index.html Sports Illustrated "From rapper to baseball collector, the wild tale of Peter Nash"]</ref> In 2007 Nice, along with [[Dropkick Murphys]] member Ken Casey, opened ''McGreevy's 3rd Base Saloon'', a baseball history-themed sports bar, in Boston in April 2008.<ref name="mcg">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mcgreevysboston.com/ |title=McGreevy's - Official Site |access-date=2008-06-08 |archive-date=2016-06-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619073853/http://www.mcgreevysboston.com/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2009 MC Serch was featured on rapper [[Kurious]]'s album ''II'' and music video by [[Amalgam Digital]].<ref name="Kurious">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAJT5E48jn0 Kurious - Benetton ft MC Serch & MF DOOM]</ref>

On April 6, 2013, MC Serch announced on Facebook that 3rd Bass would reunite after over 20 years to tour in celebration of The Cactus Album's 25th anniversary.  However, they only did two shows that year: a reunion show at a club in Brooklyn in July, and a cameo appearance on Labor Day at a festival in Indianapolis, which has proven to be their last known performance.
