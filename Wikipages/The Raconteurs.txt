'''The Raconteurs''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|æ|k|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|ɜr|z}}, also known as '''The Saboteurs''' in Australia) is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Detroit, Michigan]], formed in 2005. The band consists of [[Jack White]] (vocals, guitar), [[Brendan Benson]] (vocals, guitar), [[Jack Lawrence (musician)|Jack Lawrence]] (bass guitar), and [[Patrick Keeler]] (drums). Lawrence and Keeler were originally members of [[the Greenhornes]], while White and Lawrence went on to become members of [[the Dead Weather]].

==History==
The band is based in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. According to the band's official website, "The seed was sown in an attic in the middle of a hot summer when friends Jack White and Brendan Benson got together and wrote a song that truly inspired them. This song was '[[Steady, As She Goes]]' and the inspiration led to the creation of a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler." The band came together in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] during 2005 and recorded when time allowed for the remainder of the year. Due to the various members' success in other bands, they were quickly dubbed a [[Supergroup (bands)|supergroup]]. The band, however, asserted they were not, saying that the term implies something pre-planned or temporary, whereas they are actually "a new band made up of old friends."<ref name=MTV2>JH (2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060602163000/http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv2/music/article.jhtml?articleId=75132981 "Jack White and chums drop an album"] MTV2.co.uk (accessed May 18, 2006)</ref>

The band are known as "The Saboteurs" in the [[Australia]]n market, due to a [[Queensland]] band already using the name "Raconteurs". The Queensland band refused to give up their name for the amount of money they were offered, and instead asked for a higher price from The Raconteurs' record company, who refused to pay the greater amount.<ref name="HeraldSunNameChange">[http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,18734967%255E28957,00.html Double-up forces switch], ''[[Herald Sun]]'', 2006-04-07  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418091324/http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0%2C5478%2C18734967%5E28957%2C00.html |date=April 18, 2006 }}</ref> A member of the Queensland band said that they had not been informed of who was trying to buy their name and asked for the larger sum of money to see what would happen.<ref name="TripleJNameChange">[http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s1613948.htm Saboteurs of Raconteurs], ''[[Triple J|Triple J Music News]]'', 2006-04-11 {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref>

The band has played a number of music festivals in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[North America]] (including [[Oxegen]] in [[Ireland]]; [[Reading Festival]], [[Leeds Festival]], [[Glastonbury Festival]], and [[T in the Park]] in the [[United Kingdom]]; [[Heineken Open'er Festival]] in [[Poland]]; [[Vegoose]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]; [[Lollapalooza]] in [[Chicago]]; [[Bonnaroo]] in [[Manchester, Tennessee]]; [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] in [[Austin, Texas]]; [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] in [[Indio, California]]; and [[Orlando Calling]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]), headlining many.

===2005–2007: ''Broken Boy Soldiers''===
[[File:Raconteurs, Stockholm.jpg|thumb|left|Brendan Benson and Jack White, of the Raconteurs in [[Stockholm]], 2006]]

The Raconteurs' full-length debut, ''[[Broken Boy Soldiers]]'', was recorded at Brendan Benson's in-home studio located in Detroit. The first single was "[[Steady, As She Goes|Steady, As She Goes/Store Bought Bones]]" and was released as a limited-edition 7-inch, 45 rpm [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] in Europe on January 30, 2006,<ref name="NMEfirstsingle">[https://www.nme.com/news/white-stripes/22043 The Raconteurs confirm first single] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001023531/http://www.nme.com/news/white-stripes/22043 |date=October 1, 2007 }}, ''[[NME]]'', 2006-01-24</ref> and in North America on March 7, 2006. A CD version of "Steady, As She Goes" was released on April 24, 2006, with the B-side "Bane Rendition".

The Raconteurs first performed live at the Academy in [[Liverpool]], UK, on March 20, 2006, launching a short British tour. Their first American date was the following month, on April 20, at [[New York City]]'s [[Irving Plaza]]. Nearly nonstop touring followed, bringing the band to audiences around North America and Europe. The high profile of Jack White meant that even though the band was new, they were able to sell out mid-size venues—a rarity for a band's first tour.

''Broken Boy Soldiers'' was released on May 15, 2006, in the UK on [[Third Man Records|Third Man Recordings]]/[[XL Recordings]] and May 16 in the U.S. on Third Man Recordings/[[V2 Records]]. It entered the UK charts at No.&nbsp;2 and the U.S. charts at No.&nbsp;7.

In November 2006, the Raconteurs played eight dates as the opening act for [[Bob Dylan]] on the north-eastern leg of his U.S. tour. On November 3, 2006, the Raconteurs performed the song "Store Bought Bones" and the title track, "Broken Boy Soldier" on ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]''. According to ''[[Planet Sound]]'' (who had reporters in attendance), during "Store Bought Bones", White's guitar malfunctioned and they had to re-play the song. This eventually happened four times, with the band breaking up in laughter by the fourth take. The TV airing used edited pieces from all four performances and cut out any laughter. The band's cover of "[[Teenage Kicks]]" by [[The Undertones]] appeared on a 40-year anniversary of the [[BBC]] live compilation. They played it live on a [[John Peel]] tribute.

The band has performed a number of covers during live shows. For instance, the set list usually includes renditions of "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]" (a song written by [[Sonny Bono]] and popularized by both [[Cher]] and [[Nancy Sinatra]]) and "Headin' for the Texas Border" by The [[Flamin' Groovies]]. Other songs the band has covered include [[Gnarls Barkley]]'s "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]", [[Bo Diddley]]'s "[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]", [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' "[[It Ain't Easy (Ron Davies song)|It Ain't Easy]]", [[Love (band)|Love]]'s "A House Is Not a Motel", and [[Charley Jordan]]'s "Keep It Clean". The band has also covered the song "Floating" by the Irish band [[Jape (band)|Jape]], and "Send Me a Postcard", by Dutch band [[Shocking Blue]]. They have also performed an old Blues song written by Big Joe Williams in 1935 (popularized by Van Morrison's "Them" in 1964), "Baby, Please Don't Go."

In December 2006, the band's debut album, ''Broken Boy Soldiers'', was awarded the title Album of the Year by Britain's [[Mojo (magazine)|''Mojo'' magazine]]. In 2007, the album was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album]]. The Raconteurs were nominated for two awards at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|49th Annual Grammys]]: one for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] for ''Broken Boy Soldiers'', and another for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for "Steady, As She Goes" although they did not win in either category.<ref>GRAMMY.COM – 49th Annual Grammy Awards Nominee List, {{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-06-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061220160454/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx |archive-date=December 20, 2006 }}</ref>
The intro and ending of Steady As She Goes is often used to play out Saturday Live, a long running radio programme on BBC Radio4.

===2008–2009: ''Consolers of the Lonely''===
[[Image:Jack White of the Raconteurs shot by Kris Krug.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jack White performing with the band in 2008]]
The Raconteurs released their second album, ''[[Consolers of the Lonely]]'', on March 25, 2008. The first single, "[[Salute Your Solution]]", was released the same day.

The band also played tour dates including: Coachella on April 25, the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]] on May 4, Bonnaroo on June 13,<ref>Sisario, Ben (February 6, 2008), "Metallica And Pearl Jam and Kanye West and".

They played "The Eden Sessions" at the Eden Project in Cornwall on June 29. The band also toured the U.S. during summer 2008. In [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|2009]], ''Consolers of the Lonely'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album]] but lost to Coldplay's album Viva La Vida, or Death and All His Friends but the band did win the [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Jack White|url = http://www.grammy.com/artist/jack-white|website = The GRAMMYs|access-date = 2016-02-08}}</ref>

===2010–2018: Dormancy and recording hiatus===
In an interview in February 2010, Brendan Benson stated that the future of The Raconteurs was ambiguous, stating "I think we're all just really focused on other things." He went on to add that "it will come around and we'll get together again and hang out and maybe make a record or maybe not."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/2008-12-6-the-beat-goes-on/posts/sundance-interview-brendan-benson-reveals-what-s-next-with-the-raconteurs|title=Singer songwriter Brendan Benson talks Ranconteurs, Jack White, solo work|work=HitFix}}</ref> On April 17, 2010, Benson and Keeler performed Raconteurs songs as The Racontwoers at Jack White's Third Man Records venue to coincide with a repressing of ''Broken Boy Soldiers'' on copper-colored vinyl.<ref>Rodgers, D.

The Raconteurs announced an additional American show to play at The Tabernacle in Atlanta, Georgia on November 13, 2011. In April 2012, Third Man Records released two songs that were supposed to appear on Consolers of the Lonely: "Open Your Eyes" and "You Make a Fool Out of Me". The songs were re-recorded for Brendan Benson's next solo album 'My Old, Familiar Friend'.<ref>{{cite web |author=...posted by Swank |url=http://thirdmanrecords.com/news/view/vault-12 |title=Vault 12 |publisher=Third Man Records |date=May 24, 2010 |access-date=2012-09-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721012025/http://thirdmanrecords.com/news/view/vault-12 |archive-date=July 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In February 2013, Jack White announced that the band was back in the studio recording new music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audioinkradio.com/2013/02/jack-white-new-music-the-raconteurs/|title=Jack White Working on New Music with the Raconteurs – Audio Ink Radio|work=audioinkradio.com|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref> In March 2014, in an interview in [[The Guardian]] newspaper, Brendan Benson announced that a new album was "kind of off the table", suggesting that a new album was not currently in the works, and that the band's hiatus was more like a split.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/19/brendan-benson-raconteurs-album-jack-white|title=Brendan Benson: a new Raconteurs album is off the table|author=Sean Michaels|work=The Guardian|date=March 19, 2014}}</ref>
