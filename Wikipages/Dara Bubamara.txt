==Life and career==
Born on May 21, 1976, in [[Novi Sad]], Radojka Adžić was raised in a working-class family as the oldest child to her brother. She demonstrated her music abilities from an early age, appearing on popular televised [[variety show]]s and competing in children's music festivals such as [[Zmaj Children Games]], where she took first prize.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kurir.rs/stars/3154873/bila-je-dete-iz-radnicke-klase-a-sad-ne-zna-koliko-je-teska-dara-bubamara-uterivala-je-strah-u-kosti-ako-joj-neko-samo-uradi-ovo-cekala-ga-je-brutalna-kazna-foto|title=Bila je dete radničke klase, a asada ne zna koliko je teška!|website=[[Kurir (Newspapers)|Kurir.rs]]|date=November 14, 2018|access-date=November 5, 2021|language=sr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://avaz.ba/showbiz/jet-set/332405/nema-silikone-i-plavu-kosu-dara-bubamara-prije-29-godina|title=Nema silikona i plavu kosu: Dara Bubamara prije 29 godina|website=[[Dnevni avaz|avaz.ba]]|date=17 December 2017|access-date=2 December 2020|language=bs}}</ref>

Adžić debuted on the music scene in 1989 as a member of [[Vojvodina]] based Dara Bubamara Show band, from which she got her stage name. As her popularity with the band grew, Dara eventually decided to pursue a solo career in 1994 when she released her fist album under [[PGP-RTS]]. With stand-out hits like: "Ja neću da ga vidim", "Polje jagoda", "Vero nevero", "Javite mi, javite" and "Zidovi" she became one of the most popular Serbian [[turbo-folk|pop-folk]] singers. Her 2007 album, titled ''Dodirni me'', was sold in close to 300,000 copies. During the 2010s, she rebranded herself to a more urban image by collaborating with [[hip hop music|hip hop]] producers [[Rasta (singer)|Rasta]] and [[Slobodan Veljković Coby|Coby]] on her singles such as "Opasan", "Karera" (2014) and "Nevolja" (2016). To celebrate close to thirty years of career, in April 2018 Dara held a concert in [[Štark Arena|Belgrade Arena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tracara.com/dara-bubamara-napravila-spektakl-u-areni/|title=Dara Bubamara napravila spektakl u Areni|website=tracara.rs|language=sr|date=16 April 2018|access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref>
