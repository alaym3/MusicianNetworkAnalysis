'''Teenage Bottlerocket''' is an American [[punk rock]] and [[Pop-punk|pop punk]] band formed in [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]], [[Wyoming]] in 2000.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Aubin|first=Paul|date=2006|title=Interviews: Teenage Bottlerocket|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/14108/interviews-teenage-bottlerocket|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-28|website=Punknews|language=en}}</ref> The band was formed by twin brothers Ray and Brandon Carlisle, following the dissolution of their previous band, Homeless Wonders. The band's music is heavily influenced by guitarist and co-vocalist Kody Templeman's other band, [[The Lillingtons]], and punk rock acts such as [[Ramones]], [[Screeching Weasel]], [[Green Day]], [[Bouncing Souls|The Bouncing Souls]], and [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]; Their music has been referred to as "[[Ramones]]-core", "[[Screeching Weasel|Weasel]]-core" and "leather jacket punk".<ref name=":0" />

In a 2006 interview with the band, Punknews described Teenage Bottlerocket as "the last decent band around playing Ramones-y pop punk", stating that Teenage Bottlerocket "certainly owe[s] nothing to the trends" and naming the band "the best punk band from the Cowboy State since The Lillingtons".<ref name=":0" />

On November 3, 2015, Brandon Carlisle was found unresponsive in his [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] home by his roommate. On November 7, the remaining band members confirmed via [[Twitter]] that Carlisle had died in his sleep the night before, after being taken off life support.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bazley|first=John|date=2015-11-07|title=Teenage Bottlerocket drummer Brandon Carlisle passes away|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/teenage_bottlerocket_drummer_brandon_carlisle_passes_away/|access-date=2021-01-28|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Brandon Carlisle (1978-2015)|url=https://fatwreck.com/blogs/news/brandon-carlisle-1978-2015|access-date=2021-01-28|website=Fat Wreck Chords|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ozzi|first=Dan|date=November 7, 2015|title=Teenage Bottlerocket Drummer Brandon Carlisle Has Died|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/ryzq8x/teenage-bottlerocket-drummer-brandon-carlisle-has-died|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-28|website=Vice|language=en}}</ref>

==History==

=== Formation and early releases (2000–2004) ===
Originally consisting of Ray Carlisle (on vocals and bass guitar), Brandon Carlisle (on drums), and Zach Doe (on guitar), the band released its debut EP, ''A Bomb'' (sometimes spelled ''A-Bomb'')'','' on a Laramie communal label, One Legged Pup, and distributed through Lost Cat Records, in 2002. Soon after, Doe left and went back to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], leaving the twins without a guitarist until they found [[University of Wyoming]] Music Major Joel Pattinson. In 2003, the band members wrote and recorded their first full-length LP ''Another Way'', also released on One Legged Pup. The release was vinyl only (the first 500 on pink vinyl), released on Halloween night 2003. The band continued to play and promote numerous local shows, even landing some opening spots in Laramie with [[All (band)|All]] and [[The Ataris]]. The band was to embark on a short summer tour of the midwest in 2004. When Pattinson could not make the trip due to his obligations to the University Orchestra, the Carlisles called up their old friend Kody Templeman (lead singer in [[The Lillingtons]]) to play guitar on the tour. The tour went well, and the band ended up playing some of the new songs that Kody had written. By the end of the tour, he was a permanent member of the band, although he has continued living in his hometown of Newcastle, 246 miles away from the rest of the band.

=== ''Total,'' touring, and ''Warning Device'' (2004–2007) ===
In late 2004 and early 2005, the band recorded its [[Red Scare Industries|Red Scare]] debut full length, ''Total'' which contains dual vocals from Ray and Kody. After ''Total'' was released, the [[Groovie Ghoulies]] took notice of the band, and offered the group a spot on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222908/http://www.mattersville.net/1568.html Space Station] stage at the [[Vans Warped Tour]]. Soon after, the Ghoulies decided to drop Warped Tour, and embark with Bottlerocket, and The Teenage Harlets on the Teen Kicks Tour 2005.<ref name=":0" /> The band would go on to play shows with [[The Methadones]], [[Chixdiggit]], and [[The Mr. T Experience]]. In late 2005 and early 2006 the group embarked on its European Vacation Tour. In mid-2006, Bottlerocket embarked on another nationwide tour, this time with [[Fat Wreck Chords]] [[New wave music|new wave]] act, the [[Epoxies]]. Also in 2006, Ray moved over to second guitar when Miguel Chen joined on as bassist.

On December 28, 2007, the band filmed its first music video, for the song "In the Basement" from the new album ''Warning Device'' out on Red Scare Industries.

=== ''They Came From The Shadows'', ''Another Way'', ''Mutilate Me'', and ''Freak Out!'' (2008–2013) ===
On February 10, 2009, Teenage Bottlerocket was signed to Fat Wreck Chords. The group's first album for the label, titled ''[[They Came from the Shadows]]'', was released on September 15, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/34695 |title=Music: Teenage Bottlerocket: "Skate or Die" |publisher=Punknews.org |date=September 15, 2009 |access-date=November 7, 2015}}</ref> The group followed up the release with tours with [[NOFX]], the [[Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], and [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]].

Two releases came in 2011. In March, Red Scare released the band's first album, ''[[Another Way (album)|Another Way]]'', on CD for the first time in a deluxe edition with other previous vinyl-only tracks. In April, Fat Wreck Chords released an EP, ''[[Mutilate Me]]'', the group's second release on Fat Wreck which includes a [[Bad Religion]] cover. In 2012, the band released its fifth studio album, ''[[Freak Out! (Teenage Bottlerocket album)|Freak Out!]]'', again on Fat Wreck Chords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/news/detail/470 |title=TEENAGE BOTTLEROCKET Freak Out!! - News: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |access-date=November 7, 2015}}</ref> and in 2013 after a long euro tour with Danish metal band Volbeat, and Florida band Iced Earth, the band released a German themed EP named 'American Deutsch Bag'. [[Volbeat]] covered the band's song Rebound on their album ''Seal the Deal & Let's Boogie''.

In June 2014, the band members announced that the group had signed with [[Rise Records]]. In 2015, the band released ''Tales From Wyoming'' on Rise Records with two singles including "Haunted House" and "They Call Me Steve".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teenagebottlerocket.com/2014/06/24/teenage-bottlerocket-signs-to-rise-records/ |title=Signs to Rise Records! |publisher=Teenage Bottlerocket |date=June 24, 2014 |access-date=November 7, 2015}}</ref>

=== Brandon Carlisle's death, ''Stealing the Covers'', ''Goin' Back to Wyo'', ''Stay Rad!'', and ''Sick Sesh!'' (2015–present) ===
On November 3, 2015, drummer Brandon Carlisle was found unresponsive in his Fort Collins home by his roommate. On November 7, the band's Twitter page confirmed he had died in his sleep the night before after being taken off life support.<ref>{{cite web|title = Teenage Bottlerocket (@teenbottlerock) {{!}} Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/teenbottlerock?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor|website = twitter.com|access-date = November 7, 2015}}</ref>

On January 18, 2016, it was announced that Darren Chewka, of Canadian band The Old Wives, would become Teenage Bottlerocket's new drummer. The band returned to Fat Wreck Chords in 2017, releasing ''Stealing the Covers'', a full-length album consisting entirely of cover songs by obscure bands. A 7-inch single, ''Goin' Back to Wyo''', was released in conjunction with the album, and consisted of two new original songs.

In early 2019 the band announced the release of the first new studio album since the death of drummer Brandon Carlisle. The album, ''Stay Rad!'', is due for release on [[Fat Wreck Chords]] on March 15, 2019. The band released music videos for the two singles, "I Wanna Be a Dog" on Aug 22, 2019 and "Everything to Me" on Feb 21, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title= Teenage Bottlerocket announce new LP 'Stay Rad!|url= https://www.brooklynvegan.com/teenage-bottlerocket-announce-new-lp-stay-rad-share-song-touring/|access-date= August 3, 2021}}</ref>
