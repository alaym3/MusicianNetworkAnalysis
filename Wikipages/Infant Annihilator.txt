== History ==
===Formation and ''The PLOP'' debut album (2012–2013)===
Infant Annihilator were formed in 2012 in [[Hessle]] near [[Kingston upon Hull]] by guitarist Eddie Pickard and drummer Aaron Kitcher.<ref name="AllMusic bio"/> The name "Infant Annihilator" came from a song bearing the same title that was composed by Kitcher's previous band As the Blessed Fall, and was chosen as a parody of death metal band name [[stereotype]]s.<ref name="MMM"/> In a 2016 interview, they explained "We wanted the song names and band name to be as completely over-the-top as our music..."<ref name="MMM"/>

Pickard and Kitcher wrote and created [[home recording|homemade recordings]] together using a form of recording software on Pickard's computer. They wrote, recorded and edited the [[instrumental]] tracks for their debut album, ''The Palpable Leprosy of Pollution'' (abbreviated ''The PLOP''). After releasing instrumental songs online, the pair met American vocalist Dan Watson from [[Indiana]] online, who discovered Infant Annihilator on [[Facebook]].<ref name="APinterview">{{cite web |last1=Pecoraro |first1=Andrew |title=Enterprise Earth Interview 9.02.17 // New Album // Religion // Stay Sick // Infant Annihilator |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llB1dIICvBE |website=YouTube |access-date=21 February 2019 |archive-date=7 October 2017 |format=Video |date=2 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="KPinterview1">{{cite web |last1=Powell |first1=Kevin |title=INFANT ANNIHILATOR/ENTERPRISE EARTH Interview - Dan Watson Part I - March 2016 - YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkDrCmZ9C4 |website=YouTube |access-date=20 February 2019 |format=Video |date=18 March 2016}}</ref> Pickard and Kitcher were impressed with his performance, and asked of him to perform vocals for the album.<ref name="DWEG">{{cite web|author=hammer|title=Interview with Dan Watson (Infant Annihilator): A Christian Missionary Family child crucifies Christ &#124; Everything Guttural|url=http://everythingguttural.blogspot.com/2013/05/interview-with-dan-watson-infant.html|website=Everything Guttural|publisher=Blogspot|access-date=15 April 2018|language=en, sk|date=27 May 2013}}</ref><ref name="MMM"/><ref name="KPinterview1"/> They soon began garnering [[viral video|viral]] popularity online—growing to around 20,000 "likes" within a month<ref name="APinterview"/>—with the release of the music video for their song "Decapitation Fornication".<ref name="Hysteria"/><ref name="KPinterview1"/>

Following the release of the video, the group promoted the release for their debut album ''The Palpable Leprosy of Pollution'', which was released on 12 December 2012 (12/12/12). The idea to release the album on 12/12/12 was an idea pitched by Watson, which the band loved. However, Watson retrospectively has expressed regret for such a release date as it caused him to rush his work in order to get the album released on time, leaving him ultimately unhappy with the end result of his vocals.<ref name="KPinterview1"/>

Watson left the band in late 2013<ref name="MMM"/> and publicly announced his departure from the band 22 February 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author1=erizen 826|title=Infant Annihilator Vocalist Leaves &#124; Sputnikmusic|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/news/30217/Infant-Annihilator--Vocalist-Leaves/|website=Sputnikmusic|access-date=15 April 2018|date=22 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Ty A.

=== Dickie Allen and ''The EGG'' (2014–2017) ===
In late 2014, while he was drumming for fellow UK band Desolated during their first US tour, Kitcher met vocalist Dickie Allen in person for the first time. The tour line-up included the band Traitors, who had brought Allen, a close friend, along with them on the tour. Hearing Allen's vocals in person convinced Kitcher that he was a good fit for the band.<ref name="MMM"/><ref name="DA Djent"/> Infant Annihilator announced via social media on 1 June 2016 that they had brought on Dickie Allen as their new vocalist.

Infant Annihilator's second album ''[[The Elysian Grandeval Galèriarch]]'' (abbreviated ''The EGG'') was officially released 29 July 2016. The album was Infant Annihilator's first to [[Record chart|chart]], making it onto several [[Billboard charts]], including the [[Top Heatseekers]], [[Independent Albums]], [[Top Album Sales]], [[Top Rock Albums]], and [[Top Hard Rock Albums]] charts.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.billboard.com/music/infant-annihilator |title=Infant Annihilator &#124; Billboard|work=Billboard|access-date=9 May 2018}}</ref>

=== Third album ''The BOY'' (2019–present) ===
On 25 July, Infant Annihilator posted a music video for their first single "Three Bastards" to YouTube, along with the upcoming album’s release date, title, art, track list, and preorder information. ''[[The Battle of Yaldabaoth]]'' (abbreviated ''The BOY'') was released on 11 September.<ref>{{cite web |title=NEWS: Infant Annihilator detail third album, 'The Battle Of Yaldabaoth'! |url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-infant-annihilator-detail-third-album-the-battle-of-yaldabaoth |website=DEAD PRESS! |access-date=27 July 2019}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Infant Annihilator is a [[deathcore]]<ref name="Hysteria"/> and [[technical death metal]] band.<ref name="AllMusic bio"/><ref name="MMM"/> Their lyrical content is intentionally extreme and covers controversial topics such as [[rape]], [[paedophilia]], [[murder]], [[infanticide]], "[[Brainwashing|mass programming]]", [[religion]], [[cult]],<ref name="MMM"/> and the [[Catholic Church]]. These topics are derived from the history of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sexual abuse in the Catholic Church]].<ref name="Hysteria"/> At one point, their music was deemed "too [[obscenity|offensive]]" and was removed from [[Spotify]] and [[iTunes]] as a result,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Greg Kennelty|title=Spotify Removes INFANT ANNIHILATOR Catalog, Deem The Band Too Offensive|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/metal-in-the-mainstream/spotify-removes-infant-annihilator-catalog-deem-the-band-too-offensive|website=Metal Injection|access-date=19 April 2018|date=14 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="Spotify">{{cite web|author1=Tommy Gimler|title=Spotify Has Removed 'Infant Annihilator' From Its Site|url=http://www.mandatory.com/culture/1323529-spotify-removed-infant-annihilator-site-dying-fetus-fans-can-rest-easy|website=Mandatory|publisher=Evolve Media|access-date=19 April 2018|date=18 September 2017}}</ref> but was soon returned to both platforms three days later.<ref name="Spotify"/>
