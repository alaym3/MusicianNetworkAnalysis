'''Alabama Shakes''' was an American rock band formed in [[Athens, Alabama]], in 2009. The band maintained a consistent lineup of lead singer and guitarist [[Brittany Howard]], guitarist Heath Fogg, bassist Zac Cockrell, and drummer Steve Johnson. The group rose to prominence in the early 2010s and has sold over 1.5 million albums in the US.

The band began its career touring and performing at bars and clubs around the Southeast for two years while honing its sound and writing music. They recorded their debut album ''[[Boys & Girls (Alabama Shakes album)|Boys & Girls]]'' with producer Andrija Tokic in [[Nashville]] while still unsigned. Online acclaim led [[ATO Records]] to sign the band, which released ''Boys & Girls'' in 2012 to critical success. The album's [[hit single]] "[[Hold On (Alabama Shakes song)|Hold On]]" was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s. After a long touring cycle, the band recorded its second record ''[[Sound & Color]]'', which was released in 2015, debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and won four Grammy Awards.

==History==

===Early years (2004–09)===
Brittany Howard grew up interested in music, filling notebooks with lyrics and teaching herself to play drums, bass, and guitar.<ref name="nyt"/> 
Howard, from East Limestone High School, played in multiple bands growing up that helped to formulate and craft her taste in music. Her most serious band in her early years was Kerosene Swim Team, a rock band that consisted of Owen Whitehurst and Jonathan Passero. They went on to have a single titled "Coffins and Cadillacs" featured on a compilation track from now defunct indie label Volital Records. They would practice daily after school in Passero's garage, Whitehurst's garage, and Howard's house. They mainly played house parties, and their songs consisted of a mix of covers and originals penned by Howard. Both Whitehurst and Passero went on to continue playing backup for Howard, with Whitehurst playing with Howard and Shakes' bassist Zac Cockrell in what would eventually become The Shakes. Whitehurst would play drums and piano, with Howard and Cockrell playing their current respective instruments.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/07/alabama-shakes-boys-and-girls |title=Boys & Girls, meet the Alabama Shakes |first=David |last=Whitehouse |date=7 April 2012 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=November 21, 2017}}</ref>

===Formation (2009–11)===
Howard met Heath Fogg in junior high when he played guitar at house parties.<ref name="nyt"/> She met classmate and bassist Zac Cockrell in a psychology class some time later, and they soon began to spend time listening to their favorite music together and writing their own.<ref name="cbs"/> After graduation, Howard hosted twice-weekly jam sessions at her great-grandparents' former home. Drummer Steve Johnson, who had heard Howard singing at a party years prior, began attending the jam sessions at the suggestion of Cockrell.<ref name="usa12"/> They began making music together and recording homemade demos<ref name="usa12"/> having little  else to do in the small town.<ref name="nyt"/>

The group made its live debut in May 2009 under the name "The Shakes."<ref name="usa12"/> Fogg, by this point a guitarist in the [[Tuscaloosa]]-based Tuco's Pistol, invited the group to open for his band at Brick Deli & Tavern in [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]].<ref name="cbs">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alabama-shakes-fearless-and-free/ |title=Alabama Shakes: Fearless and free |first=Jan |last=Crawford |date=May 3, 2015 |website=[[CBS News]] |access-date=June 30, 2015}}</ref> The band was nervous to perform for an audience, as they felt "vulnerable." Their set included covers of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[James Brown]], [[Otis Redding]], and [[AC/DC]].<ref name="usa12"/> The show went over well, and Fogg soon joined the group.<ref name="nyt"/> During this time the band members held other day jobs: Howard as a fry cook and then a postal worker, Johnson at the [[Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant]], Cockrell at an animal clinic, and Fogg painting houses.<ref name="rs15"/> For much of their early years, the Shakes performed shows on weekends at "sports bars and country dives."<ref name="npr12">{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/11/150445845/alabama-shakes-full-of-southern-soul |date=April 11, 2012 |title=Alabama Shakes: Full Of 'Southern Soul' |website=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=June 30, 2015}}</ref> They also began recording their debut album at Tokic's Bomb Shelter—the home of producer Andrija Tokic—in [[Nashville]], funding the recordings themselves.<ref name="nyt"/> The band chose Tokic's over other studios because they recorded mostly live to tape, and they believed it would spur a livelier performance. The band would complete arrangements in their hometown and drive an hour and a half north to Nashville to record in intervals over the course of 2011.<ref name="sos">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul12/articles/alabama-shakes.htm |title=Andrija Tokic: Recording Alabama Shakes' Boys & Girls |date=July 2012 |magazine=[[Sound on Sound]] |first=Matt |last=Frost |access-date=June 30, 2015}}</ref>

Their breakthrough came when Justin Gage, a Los Angeles music blogger and [[SiriusXM]] host, found a photo of Howard performing online. After contacting the band, he posted an [[MP3]] of their song "You Ain't Alone" on his music blog, [[Aquarium Drunkard]], in July 2011.<ref name="nyt"/><ref name="ad">{{cite news |url=http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2011/07/25/the-shakes-you-aint-alone/ |title=The Shakes: You Ain't Alone |first=Justin |last=Gage |date=July 25, 2011 |website=Aquarium Drunkard |access-date=June 30, 2015}}</ref> By the next morning, the group was awash in offers from record labels and management companies.<ref name="nyt"/> Gage also contacted [[Patterson Hood]], vocalist of the band [[Drive-By Truckers]], who attended a show not long after. He arranged to set the band up with his managers, Christine Stauder and Kevin Morris.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/29/alabama-shakes-interview-sound-color-festivals |title=Alabama Shakes: from small-town bar band to titans of rock |first=Tom |last=Lamont |date=March 29, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=June 30, 2015}}</ref> Alabama Shakes released a four-song EP, ''Alabama Shakes'', in September 2011, which gained media attention (including [[NPR]])<ref name="Powers">{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/10/14/141355733/how-to-keep-it-real-when-making-new-soul-three-attempts |title=How To Keep It Real When Making New Soul: Three Attempts |last=Powers |first=Ann |date=14 October 2011 |website=The Record: Music News from [[NPR]] |access-date=October 29, 2012}}</ref> and earned an invitation to play at the CMJ Music Marathon industry showcase in New York.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Alabama Shakes: Right At Home with Newfound Fame |date=January 18, 2012 |last=Ramsey |first=Jan |url=http://www.offbeat.com/2012/01/18/the-alabama-shakes-right-at-home-with-newfound-fame/ |magazine=[[OffBeat (music magazine)|OffBeat]] |access-date=January 27, 2012}}</ref> The band began negotiating a record deal with ATO Records and added "Alabama" to their name after Joseph Hicks, of Halo Stereo, noticed how many groups shared the name "The Shakes".<ref name="nyt" /><ref name="mongillo">{{cite news |url=http://www.austin360.com/music/once-a-cover-act-alabama-shakes-rock-and-2104304.html |title=Once a cover act, Alabama Shakes rock and soul band draws notice |last=Mongillo |first=Peter |date=February 8, 2012 |newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |access-date=May 12, 2012}}</ref> They began to open for the [[Drive-By Truckers]].<ref name="peisner">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/muscle-shoals-revival-alabama-shakes-take-off-20120124 |title=Muscle Shoals Revival: Alabama Shakes Take Off |last=Peisner |first=David |date=February 2, 2012 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=May 12, 2012}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Early critical reviews of their debut, ''Boys & Girls'' (2012), noted that the band borrowed from mid-20th century rhythm and blues.<ref name="vul15"/><ref name="rs12">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/boys-girls-20120410 |issue=1155 |title=The Alabama Shakes – 'Boys & Girls' |first=Jon |last=Dolan |date=April 10, 2012 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=June 30, 2015 |publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media LLC]] |location=[[New York City]] |issn=0035-791X}}</ref> Alongside Howard's voice, the songs were compared to artists such as [[Janis Joplin]], [[Otis Redding]], and [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name="npr12"/> Howard herself took inspiration from [[Bon Scott]] of [[AC/DC]] in her vocal style, praising his "soulful" way of singing.<ref name="usa12">{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/ontheverge/story/2012-04-25/alabama-shakes-on-the-verge/54560144/1 |title=Meet the Alabama Shakes |first=Brian |last=Mansfield |date=April 27, 2012 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |access-date=June 30, 2015}}</ref> As the acclaim mounted, "reviewers speculated" that their sound was in homage to the music produced in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama|Muscle Shoals]], Alabama nearly five decades prior.

The success of debut single "[[Hold On (Alabama Shakes song)|Hold On]]" led some to believe the group "[was] trying to pass themselves off as revivalists, something they never aspired to be."<ref name="nyt"/>

Their second record, ''Sound & Color'' (2015), is steeped in several different genres, and touches on everything from [[shoegaze]] to bands such as [[MC5]].<ref name="vul15">{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/06/alabama-shakes-theres-no-way-to-be-original.html |title=Alabama Shakes: 'There's No Way to Be Original' |first=Lauretta |last=Charlton |date=June 12, 2015 |website=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] |access-date=June 30, 2015}}</ref>
