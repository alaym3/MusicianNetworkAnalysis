===Early years and ''When Broken Is Easily Fixed'' (2000–2004)===
Silverstein formed in February 2000.<ref name="silversteinmusic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.silversteinmusic.com/db/faq.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218160537/http://www.silversteinmusic.com/db/faq.html |archive-date=18 December 2007 |title=Silverstein |publisher=Silversteinmusic.com |access-date=13 May 2015}}</ref> They self-released their first EP, ''[[Summer's Stellar Gaze]]'', in August that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silversteinmusic.com/releases.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021105224821/http://www.silversteinmusic.com/releases.html |title=Silverstein |archive-date=5 November 2002 |work=silversteinmusic.com |access-date=13 May 2015}}</ref> After several lineup changes, the band acquired Billy Hamilton, a local fan who learned of the band's need for a bassist on the Internet [[message board]] "The 905 Board" (an Ontario area outreach board which used to be for local musicians). In December 2000, he joined the band after Told helped him learn the music for the songs. Following a rehearsal on [[Boxing Day]] (26 December) in 2000, he officially debuted with Silverstein. The next spring, original guitarist Richard McWalter left the band to move to [[Victoria, British Columbia]] to study engineering. He was then replaced by Neil Boshart, childhood friend of Shane Told. The new lineup recorded a second EP, ''[[When the Shadows Beam]]'', in preparation for their first tour in Eastern Canada. The band signed to [[Victory Records]] in October 2002 with a complete lineup as Hamilton attempted to complete his secondary education one semester early.

The following January the band went into the studio to record their first full-length debut album, ''[[When Broken Is Easily Fixed]]''. It was recorded at Unity Gain and Mount Fairview studios, with producer Justin Koop and was released on 20 May 2003 through [[Victory Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorymerch.com/merch/cds/9350/silverstein-when-broken-is-easily-fixed-cd |title=Silverstein - When Broken Is Easily Fixed CD Album |access-date=3 March 2011}}</ref> Six songs were re-recorded versions from Silverstein's previous EP's; ''Summer's Stellar Gaze'' and ''When The Shadows Beam''.

{{quote|Silverstein's Victory debut is a jarring mixture of emo's earnest determination, elements of hardcore, and the heaviest of heavy metal. While vocalist Shane Told delivers lines like "How can I say I love you back, you never made me happy" in a cracked, soaring singing voice, When Broken Is Easily Fixed actually begins with a ragged scream that's as arresting as his singing is plaintive. Musically, the LP is dominated by the dynamic shifts and driving melodies of emo. But Silverstein's membership was derived from existing hardcore, metal, and punk squads, and these fragiles are never very far from view. "Last Days of Summer" begins as a June day ends, with shuffling percussion and gently strummed guitars. But just as the fragile strains of a violin drift in, Told's growling, scarred alter ego appears behind his singing self.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,2563251,00.html |title=When Broken Is Easily Fixed by Silverstein at ARTISTdirect.com - Shop, Listen, Download |publisher=Artistdirect.com |date=May 27, 2003 |access-date=March 3, 2011}}</ref>}}

===''Discovering the Waterfront'' (2005–2006)===
In August 2005 the band's second studio album, ''[[Discovering the Waterfront]]'', was released through [[Victory Records]]. It was the first album to be produced by Cameron Webb, and marked the beginning of a long relationship between the band and the American [[Record producer|producer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nettwerk.com/producer/cameron-webb |title=Retrieved 2010-10-08 |publisher=Nettwerk.com |access-date=4 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113042522/http://www.nettwerk.com/producer/cameron-webb |archive-date=13 November 2009}}</ref><ref>"The Making of A Shipwreck in the Sand" featurette from [[A Shipwreck in the Sand]] DVD.

Told's clean and unclean vocals had matured since their previous effort.

In 2005, the band performed on the Never Sleep Again Tour with bands such as [[Aiden]], [[Hawthorne Heights]] and [[Bayside (band)|Bayside]]&mdash;a tour during which Bayside's drummer John "Beatz" Holohan was then killed in a road accident. The song, ''Here Today, Gone Tomorrow'', on their following album, ''[[Arrivals and Departures]]'', was written about Holohan's death, and his relationship with the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=9398 |title=Here Today, Gone Tomorrow by Silverstein Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |access-date=16 October 2012}}</ref> In January–February 2006, they toured with fellow Canadians [[Simple Plan]] in [[Europe]]. They then toured Canada with the [[Taste of Chaos]] Tour, and also toured Europe, Japan, and Australia. They also performed at the [[Give It A Name]] festival at [[Earls Court]] & [[MEN Arena]] in Britain, opening the main stage.

The band also toured on the 2006 [[Vans Warped Tour]], debuting on the main stage in support of ''Discovering the Waterfront'' and a compilation album, ''[[18 Candles: The Early Years]]''. ''The Early Years'' compiles the band's first two self-financed EPs along with various alternate versions of songs from their first two studio albums, including a dance remix of "Smile In Your Sleep" and an acoustic version of "My Heroine". ''Discovering the Waterfront'' was re-released in September 2006 with an extra song, the band's cover of [[Lifetime (band)|Lifetime]]'s "Rodeo Clown" and a DVD including [[music video]]s, a making of [[featurette]] and a live set from the Never Sleep Again Tour, in [[Chicago]].

In 2006, Silverstein was nominated for a [[Juno Award]] in the "Best New Band" category, but lost to [[Bedouin Soundclash]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/2005-juno-awards.html |title=2005 Juno Awards |publisher=Metrolyrics.com |date=1 April 2005 |access-date=3 March 2011}}</ref>

In addition, they completed a U.S. tour with [[A Day to Remember]], Protest the Hero and The Devil Wears Prada, during which Protest the Hero dropped off the tour and [[Pierce the Veil]] took over for them on a few show dates. After heavy touring for their album, ''Arrivals and Departures'', in Canada, the US, the UK, and other areas in Europe during late 2007 and early 2008, which included the band's 1000th show in Paris, France, the band took the summer off. In a news post on their site, Silverstein's Paul Koehler said the band was "taking a bit of downtown time to write a new album!"

In October and November 2008, the band toured the United States (with a final show in Toronto) with [[Chiodos]], [[Escape the Fate]], [[Alesana]], and [[A Skylit Drive]], during which they performed the newly written song "Broken Stars", also made available as a demo on their [[Myspace]] page.
