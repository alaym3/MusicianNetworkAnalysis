'''Os Mutantes''' (meaning '' the mutants''; {{IPA-pt|uz muˈtɐ̃tʃis|br}}) are an influential Brazilian [[Rock music|rock]] band that were linked with the [[Tropicalismo|Tropicália]] movement, a dissident musical movement during the [[Brazilian dictatorship]] of the late 1960s. They released their acclaimed [[Os Mutantes (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1968.

The band is considered to be one of the main groups of [[brazilian rock]]. Like many groups from the 60s, Os Mutantes were heavily influenced by [[The Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Sly & the Family Stone]].<ref>[http://www.luakabop.com/os_mutantes/cmp/sergio2.html Sérgio Dias Interview]</ref> But they were also deeply submerged in their local culture, exercising their own creativity in the use of ''feedback'', [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], and studio tricks of all types, as it was done by the Liverpool quartet and by [[The Beach Boys]]. In this sense, Os Mutantes were pioneers in the mixture of [[rock and roll]] with Brazilian musical and thematic elements. Another characteristic of the group was their irreverence. Because like Os Mutantes, there came to exist a mix of foreign music with Brazilian music and the addition of new ideas, with doses of [[Experimental Music|experimentalism]], opening way to a new musical hybrid.

Os Mutantes debuted their work in [[1966]], as a trio, when they presented themselves in the program ''O Pequeno Mundo de Ronnie Von'' of [[TV Record]]. The group was baptized as ''Mutantes'' by [[Ronnie Von]] himself, right before their first TV appearance. The group until then used call themselves ''Os Bruxos'' (meaning ''The Witches'', in Portuguese) and the suggestion came from the book ''Emperor of the Mutants'', by Stefan Wul (the book's original title in french is ''La Mort Vivante''). The group quickly became one of the main figures of the "new MPB" (popular brazilian music), influenced by [[Tropicália]], until their breakup in [[1978]], only with Sérgio Dias as an original member. Throughout these twelve years, nine albums were recorded, although two of them - ''[[O A e o Z]]'' and ''[[Tecnicolor]]'' - were only released in the [[90's]]. It was during this decade that the importance of Os Mutantes was recognized, by both national and international rock, as one of the most creative dynamic, radical and talented groups of the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] era.

Although the original line-up ([[Rita Lee]], [[Arnaldo Baptista]] and [[Sérgio Dias]]; and later with [[Liminha]] and Dinho Leme) made the most notable breakthrough for the group, it has gone through numerous personnel changes throughout its existence. After a hiatus from the late 1970s to the early 2000s, the band reunited in 2006, touring and recording new material.

==History==
===Origins===
Os Mutantes was formed in [[São Paulo]] in 1966 by two brothers: [[Arnaldo Baptista]] (bass, keyboards and vocals) and [[Sérgio Dias|Sérgio Dias Baptista]] (guitar and vocals), and lead singer [[Rita Lee]]. They were originally named Six Sided Rockers.<ref name=amg>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p312117/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography |access-date=2008-03-29 |last=Bush |first=John |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[All Media Guide]] }}</ref> The Baptistas' father was a poet and mother a pianist,<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |first=Will |last=Hodgkinson |author-link=Will Hodgkinson |title='Why be normal?' |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1777371,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2006-05-18 |access-date=2008-03-29 }}</ref> and the two had previously had an all-male band called The Wooden Faces, while Lee was in an all-female band called The Teenage Singers. Sérgio Dias' guitar, the Golden Guitar (Guitarra de Ouro), was created by Arnaldo and Sérgio's brother, Cláudio César Dias Baptista, who built many of their instruments and electronic effects.<ref name=LB-Sergio-2>[http://www.luakabop.com/os_mutantes/cmp/sergio2.html Interview with Os Mutantes guitarist Sérgio Dias], Luakabop.com</ref><ref name=LB-Rita>[http://www.luakabop.com/os_mutantes/cmp/rita.html Interview with Os Mutantes singer Rita Lee], Luakabop.com</ref> Their current name was settled upon immediately before a performance on a Brazilian television program.<ref name=clique>{{cite web |url=http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/en/Artists/Artists.asp?Status=ARTISTA&Nu_Artista=414 |title=Mutantes |access-date=2008-03-29 |work=AllBrazilianMusic |publisher=CliqueMusic Editora |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210129092159/http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/artistas/ver/mutantes |archive-date=2021-01-29}}</ref>

===Tropicália===
{{See also|Tropicalismo}}

Through other TV performances, the band was able to meet [[Gilberto Gil]], an influential musician in the [[Tropicalismo|Tropicália]] movement, who brought them into the movement's circle.<ref name=clique/> Os Mutantes released two albums heavily influenced by Tropicália, which blended [[psychedelic rock]] with other forms of art. They performed and recorded with many artists of this period, including [[Caetano Veloso]] and Gilberto Gil, before Veloso and Gil were arrested and subsequently exiled by the [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|military government of Brazil]] in early 1969. During this period, Os Mutantes was also threatened by the [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|military government of Brazil]] of that time.<ref name=trip>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Rohter |author-link=Larry Rohter |title=Brazil's Musical Mutants Resume Their Strange Trip |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/arts/music/15roht.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]] |date=2007-07-15 |access-date=2008-03-29 }}</ref>

In 1967 Os Mutantes backed Gilberto Gil when he competed in the third annual Festival of Brazilian Popular Music, making Brazilian music history by being one of the first two rock groups to participate, and Gil won second prize in the song competition with his song "Domingo no Parque" ("Sunday in the Park"). Gil's friend Caetano Veloso also performed with a rock group, São Paulo band Beat Boys, and although his unorthodox performance met with some initial resistance, he eventually won over the crowd with his song "Alegria, Alegria", which was awarded fourth place in the competition. The next year Os Mutantes collaborated with Gilberto Gil on his [[Gilberto Gil (1968 album)|second solo album]], and they also contributed to the manifesto work of the Tropicália movement, the landmark 1968 album ''[[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis]]'' (''Tropicália: or Bread and Circuses'') a collaborative album recorded by all the major figures in the movement, including Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gll, Caetano Veloso, [[Gal Costa]], and [[Tom Zé]], with orchestrations by [[Rogerio Duprat]] and lyrical contributions from [[Torquato Neto]].

In sharp contrast to their well-received festival appearance in 1967, the group famously met with intense hostility when they backed Caetano Veloso for his two now-legendary performances at the third International Song Festival in Rio, which caused a near-riot. In the first round of the festival's song competition on 12 September 1968, Veloso and Os Mutantes were loudly jeered, booed and insulted by a large group of students in the audience, who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalists' musical experiments, and who were further infuriated by Veloso's outlandish costume, and his provocatively sexual stage movements. In the second round of the competition on 15 September, Veloso and Os Mutantes performed a wild new psychedelic piece that Veloso had written for the occasion, called "É proibido proibir" ("It Is Forbidden to Forbid"); this was recorded live and an excerpt was later released as the b-side of the studio recording of the single. The students began heckling even before the ensemble took the stage, and throughout the song, the anti-Tropicalist faction in the audience jeered and booed so loudly that the performers could barely be heard. The students also began throwing eggs, fruit, vegetables and paper balls and a section of the audience stood up and turned their backs on the performers, to which Os Mutantes responded by turning their backs to the audience. Os Mutantes continued playing, but Veloso stopped singing and spontaneously launched into an impassioned diatribe, denouncing the student faction for their conservatism, which provoked even louder howls of disapproval from the audience. Although the ensemble was joined on stage by [[Gilberto Gil]], who came out to show his support, the jeering continued unabated, so Veloso angrily declared that he would no longer participate in the competition; he then finished the song deliberately out of tune, and he, Gilberto and Os Mutantes left the stage arm-in-arm.<ref>Victoria Langland, "Il est Interdit d’Interdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil", ''Estudios Interdisciplinarios de América Latina y el Caribe'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006)</ref>

===Mid-seventies===
In 1971, bassist Arnolpho Lima Filho ("Liminha") and drummer Ronaldo Leme ("Dinho") officially joined the band. They released five albums together before Lee departed in 1972 to start a solo career.<ref name=trip/> Rita Lee's 1972 album ''[[Hoje É o Primeiro Dia do Resto da Sua Vida]]'' was actually recorded with Os Mutantes but credited to Rita Lee due to record company disagreements.  Subsequently, the band moved in a [[progressive rock]] direction with the album ''[[O A e o Z]]'', recorded in 1973 but released only in 1992 due to disagreement with the record company. Arnaldo left the band in that year to pursue a solo career due to differences with other band members and problems with the abuse of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], followed by Dinho and, a year later, Liminha. Arnaldo subsequently was institutionalized and jumped from the building's window, causing a six-week coma.<ref name=guardian/> Sérgio Dias, the only remaining original member, led the band until its dissolution in 1978. During this time, they released one more studio album, a live album and an EP. Two unreleased albums were released many years later, the aforementioned ''O A e o Z'' and ''[[Tecnicolor]]'' recorded in 1970 and released in 2000.

===Reunion===
Os Mutantes (Arnaldo, Sérgio and Dinho, ''sans'' Rita Lee and Liminha&mdash;Lee was replaced with Zélia Duncan on vocals) played live for the first time since 1978 at the Tropicalia exhibition at [[London]]'s [[Barbican Arts Centre]] on May 22, 2006. This performance was followed by shows in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]] (with [[the Flaming Lips]]), [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Chicago]], and [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]. Was the first concert of drummer Dinho Leme since the end of Mutantes.

They have also collaborated with British DJ JD Twitch, in a Britain/Brazil culture project in 2007, called [[Trocabrahma]]. In September 2007, both Arnaldo Baptista and Zélia Duncan left the band.<ref>{{cite news |author=G1 |title=Arnaldo Baptista e Zélia Duncan saem dos Mutantes |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Musica/0,,MUL107798-7085-4470,00.html |work=[[Rede Globo|G1]] |date=2007-09-21 |access-date=2008-03-29 |location=[[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]] |language=pt}}</ref> Both expressed wishes to continue with their respective solo projects. Sérgio Dias, however, vowed to keep the reformed band alive, not wanting to let "the giant sleep again", as he put it.

In November, it was reported that Liminha would return to the fold, while Karina Zeviani was said to replace Duncan as the band's female vocalist.<ref>{{cite web |author=iG |url=http://igpop.ig.com.br/principal/2007/11/13/baixista_liminha_volta_a_integrar_os_mutantes_1078993.html |title=Baixista Liminha volta a integrar os Mutantes |access-date=2008-04-28 |date=2007-11-13 |work=iG |language=pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517055650/http://igpop.ig.com.br/principal/2007/11/13/baixista_liminha_volta_a_integrar_os_mutantes_1078993.html |archive-date=2008-05-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Neither is part of the new band lineup.

In June 2008, "A Minha Menina" was the featured audio track for the [[McDonald's]] commercial "Victory."

In 2009, the band announced their first new release in 35 years, ''[[Haih Or Amortecedor]]'', which was released on September 8, by [[ANTI-]] Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/35642-os-mutantes-sign-to-anti-ready-new-album/ |title=Os Mutantes Sign to Anti- &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2009-06-16 |access-date=2014-08-22}}</ref>  They did an extensive North American tour in support of the album in the fall of 2009<ref>[http://www.tinymixtapes.com/Os-Mutantes-Announce-North ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802015223/http://www.tinymixtapes.com/Os-Mutantes-Announce-North |date=August 2, 2009 }}</ref> and played at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 2010. The band also toured North America in the fall of 2010.

In 2011, they collaborated with [[Of Montreal]] on the song "Bat Macumba" for the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s most recent charitable album "[[Red Hot Organization#Red Hot + Rio 2|Red Hot+Rio 2]]." The album is a follow-up to the 1996 "[[Red Hot + Rio]]." Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues.

On April 30, 2013, ''[[Fool Metal Jack]]'' was released. Unlike ''Haih Or Amortecedor'', the album's lyrics are mostly in English. The album features a slightly different lineup than ''Haih'', with Ani Cordero replacing Dinho Leme on drums and [[Amy Crawford (musician)|Amy Crawford]] replacing Henrique Peters on keyboards.<ref>[http://www.mutantes.com/#!gallery/cff9]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331111020/http://www.mutantes.com/#!gallery/cff9 |date=March 31, 2013 }}</ref> The band toured North America in support of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/04/os-mutantes-fool-metal-jack-new-album-song-premiere-interview/ |title=Hear Os Mutantes' New, Anguished 'Fool Metal Jack' &#124; SPIN &#124; Premieres |publisher=SPIN |date=2013-04-02 |access-date=2014-08-22}}</ref>

==Legacy==
When Os Mutantes was formed, it combined influences from rock acts from the English-speaking world like [[The Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Sly & the Family Stone]], [[the Ventures]], and [[Duane Eddy]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.furious.com/perfect/osmutantes.html |title=Os Mutantes - Dois Mil e Um |access-date=2008-03-29 |last=Cross |first=Dave |date=April 2000 |work=[[Perfect Sound Forever (magazine)|Perfect Sound Forever]] }}</ref> with [[bossa nova]], [[tropicália]], [[samba]] and the cultural legacy of the Brazilian art vanguards from the modernist movement.

Os Mutantes is one of the most well-known and influential rock bands in Brazil. In addition, many contemporary underground or independent bands in the United States and Europe cite Os Mutantes as a major influence. [[Kurt Cobain]] publicly requested a reunion tour from the trio in 1993, writing a letter to Arnaldo Baptista.<ref>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Rohter |author-link=Larry Rohter |title=Ignored for Decades, They're Suddenly a Hot Band |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E4DF1631F936A25757C0A9679C8B63 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-04-15 |access-date=2008-03-29 }}</ref> Cobain was introduced to them by Pat Fear from [[White Flag (band)|White Flag]] (whose collaboration with [[Redd Kross]] and other friends under the name The Tater Totz was the first American band to cover or even cite Os Mutantes on their 1988 LP ''Alien Sleestaks from Brazil'').
