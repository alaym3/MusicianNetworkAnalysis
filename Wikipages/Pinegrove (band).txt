'''Pinegrove''' is an American rock band formed in [[Montclair, New Jersey]] in 2010. The band's lineup is variable, with singer-songwriter [[Evan Stephens Hall]] and drummer Zack Levine representing its core members. The two met as children and played in various bands before founding Pinegrove. The band's musical style, which uses instruments such as the [[banjo]] and [[pedal steel guitar]], is commonly described as a mix between [[alternative country|alt-country]] and [[emo]]. Pinegrove's early years were spent [[Self-publishing|self-releasing]] music—including their debut album, ''[[Meridian (album)|Meridian]]'' (2012)—and performing [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) [[House concert|house show]]s.

After signing to [[independent record label]] [[Run for Cover Records|Run for Cover]], the group issued an anthology of their early work, titled ''[[Everything So Far]]'' (2014). Their second studio album, ''[[Cardinal (Pinegrove album)|Cardinal]]'' (2016), represented a breakthrough, gathering a devoted fan listenership and appearing on many [[music journalism|music critics]]' top-10 year-end lists. After recording its successor, ''[[Skylight (Pinegrove album)|Skylight]]'', Pinegrove took a year-long hiatus after Hall was accused of "sexual [[coercion]]" by a person with whom he toured. The album saw proper release independently in 2018, and was followed by several sold-out tours. The band signed to British label [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] for their next efforts, including ''[[Marigold (Pinegrove album)|Marigold]]'' (2020) and the forthcoming ''[[11:11 (Pinegrove album)|11:11]]'' (2022).

Pinegrove are known for their [[Literature|literary]] lyricism and [[cult following|loyal following]] of fans, which refer to themselves as "Pinenuts". The band's name comes from a prominent [[pine tree]] row on a [[nature reserve]] at [[Kenyon College]], where Hall attended college. They are known for their [[geometry|geometric]] iconography, specifically using [[square]] shapes, and usage of the [[ampersand]] (&) in artwork and merchandise. Pinegrove are also recognized for their alignment with [[Progressivism|progressive]] causes, including charitable contributions to [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] organizations.

===Early years (2010–2014)===

Pinegrove was formed in [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]], a township in [[New Jersey]], in 2010.

One spot contained a region of [[pine tree]]s, referred to as the "pinegrove" by students, that Hall felt was particularly important; its grid was visually geometrical, a concept often explored by Hall, as well as repetitious, which Hall related [[Repetition (music)|back to music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.btrtoday.com/read/tuneup/tune-up-52/|title=Pinegrove|date=July 31, 2015|first= Samantha|last=Spoto|work=BTRtoday|publisher=BreakThru Radio, LLC|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref>

Pinegrove spent its early years performing DIY concerts in [[basement]]s around Montclair and surrounding areas.<ref name="ny20"/> Many of their early tours were [[Talent agent|booked]] by the members themselves and performed to "no one," according to the band.<ref name="p4k-18"/> Hall posted the band's debut [[extended play]] (EP), titled ''Mixtape One'', on online music platform [[Bandcamp]] in January 2010. Bandcamp was instrumental in the band's early career, with the group using it as an official website and merchandise store. The group followed it up with ''[[Meridian (album)|Meridian]]'', their first album, released in February 2012. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' contributor Rachel Brodsky writes that the LP was received "breathlessly in their microcosm of listeners," prompting the band to relocate east of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] to [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], New York City, in hopes of garnering more notoriety.<ref name="spin16"/> Hall spent nine months in the [[Boroughs of New York City|borough]] and returned home to Montclair, viewing it a more peaceful space to write music.

The band followed the release with ''&'' (2013), then ''Mixtape Two'' in 2014, upon which Hall observed listeners began to connect more strongly with the band.<ref name="p4k16"/> All of the aforementioned releases were re-configured into the track listing for their 2014 compilation, ''[[Everything So Far]]'', which serves as an anthology of the band's early material. That same year, Pinegrove re-recorded their song "Problems" for [[Topshelf Records]]' 2014 digital sampler.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mehalick|first1=Mike|title=Montclair’s Pinegrove Drop In With A New Recording Of Single "Problems"|url=http://speakimge.com/montclairs-pinegrove-drop-in-with-a-new-recording-of-single-problems/|publisher=Speak into My Goodbye|access-date=October 14, 2015}}</ref> After several years of self-releasing their music, the band signed to [[Boston]]-based independent label [[Run for Cover Records]] (RFC) in October 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2015/10/pinegrove-new-friends-stream-everything-so-far-run-for-cover/|title=Pinegrove Sign to Run for Cover, Reinvent Optimist Rock on ‘New Friends’|date=October 6, 2015|work=Spin|access-date=September 30, 2018}}</ref> The group were connected with the label by Cam Boucher of the band [[Sorority Noise]].<ref name="spin16">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2016/02/pinegrove-cardinal-new-album-interview-all-eyes-on/|title=Pinegrove: Getting By With a Little Help From Their Friends|first=Rachel|last=Brodsky|date=February 18, 2016|access-date=February 27, 2019|work=Spin}}</ref> In addition, the group received help from booking agent Greg Horbal, whom the group met through Dexter Loos, a drummer who had worked with fellow Montclair acts Tawny Peaks and [[Alex G]].<ref name="swal"/> RFC re-released ''Everything So Far'' with updated cover art that same month.<ref name="spin">{{cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2015/10/pinegrove-new-friends-stream-everything-so-far-run-for-cover/|date=October 6, 2015|title=Pinegrove Sign to Run for Cover, Reinvent Optimist Rock on ‘New Friends’|first=Colin|last=Joyce|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=March 3, 2019}}</ref>
