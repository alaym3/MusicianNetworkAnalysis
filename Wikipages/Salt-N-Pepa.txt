==History==
===1985–1987: Formation and early years===
In mid-1985, Brooklyn native Cheryl James met Queens resident Sandra Denton, both studying nursing at Queensborough Community College. The pair became close friends and co–workers at Sears. Co-worker [[Hurby Azor|Hurby "Luv Bug" Azor]] was studying record production at the Center of Media Arts and asked James and Denton to record for him as a class project.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYFv3ifE0f4C&q=Pamela+Greene+salt+n+pepa&pg=PA297 |title=Big Bang, Baby: Rock Trivia |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2000 |publisher=Dundurn|isbn=9780888822192 |access-date=November 30, 2017 }}</ref> This resulted in the single "The Showstoppa",  an [[answer record]] to [[Doug E. Fresh]]'s hit single "The Show"<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> by the duo, who originally called themselves Super Nature, along with DJ [[Latoya Hanson]] in late 1985, produced by Azor. The single used a melody from the 1984 film ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]''. The finished recording garnered some airplay on a New York City rap radio program. The independent Pop Art Records gave it an official release, and "The Show Stoppa (Is Stupid Fresh)" became a modest R&B hit.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The single reached No. 46 on the Billboard R&B chart. In September 1985, the group signed to [[Next Plateau Entertainment]] (formerly Next Plateau Records), adopting the stage name Salt-N-Pepa and released their debut album ''[[Hot, Cool & Vicious]]'' in December 1986.

In 1987, the group recruited Deidra Roper, a 15-year-old high school student (a.k.a. [[Spinderella]]) after the departure of Hanson. The group entered the music industry at a time when hip hop was believed to be a fad, and major record companies were very reluctant to sign hip hop artists.{{sfn|Elafros|2007|p=195}} Many early hip hop artists recorded for independent labels. Salt-N-Pepa made their impact on hip hop by being one of the first all-female rap groups. Concerned about sexist lyrics and video clips that objectified women's bodies in hip hop, many [[feminism|feminists]] disliked rap and hip hop because of its bad portrayal of women. However, Salt-N-Pepa changed the look of hip hop. They were scantily clad in sexy clothing and were not afraid to talk about sex and their thoughts about men. Their song "[[Let's Talk About Sex]]" was a huge hit.<ref>{{cite book|last=White, Bay, Martin Jr.|first=Deborah, Mia, Waldo E.|title=Freedom on My Mind: a History of African Americans with Documents|date=2013|publisher=Bedford St. Martins|pages=767}}</ref>

With the success of "The Show Stoppa," the group's name was changed to Salt-N-Pepa. The group changed their name because in "The Show Stoppa" they rap the lines "Right now I'm gonna show you how it's supposed to be 'Cause we, the Salt and Pepa MCs". This resulted in radio stations getting phone calls requesting "The Show Stoppa" by Salt & Pepper. They signed to the independent [[Next Plateau Entertainment|Next Plateau]] Records to record a full-length album.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The group's first album ''[[Hot, Cool & Vicious]]'' was released in 1986 with the original DJ Latoya Hanson, who was later replaced by Deidra "Spinderella" Roper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/1999-04-01/music/seasoned-performers/|title=Seasoned Performers|author=Roberts, Michael|publisher=[[Denver Westword]]|date=April 1, 1999|access-date=October 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Appiah|first=Kwame Anthony|author-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|author2-link=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanaencyclop00appi/page/1661 1661]|isbn=0-465-00071-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/africanaencyclop00appi/page/1661}}</ref> The album was produced by [[Hurby Azor]], Salt's boyfriend at the time and the group's manager.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Years later, the women found themselves with legal issues with Azor as they accused him of paying unfair royalties. ''Hot, Cool & Vicious'' provided some moderate R&B hits with the singles "My Mic Sound Nice", "Tramp", and "Chick On The Side". But when San Francisco DJ and producer Cameron Paul created a remix to "[[Push It (Salt-n-Pepa song)|Push It]]", the B-side of the "Tramp" single, it gave the group their first major hit.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> "Push It" (US #19, UK #2) became a platinum single in the United States, and a hit in several other countries, and was added to subsequent pressings of ''Hot, Cool & Vicious''. It was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], and the strength of that single catapulted the album to platinum sales in the U.S. with over 1 million copies sold, making Denton, James, and Roper the first female rap act to go platinum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/salt-n-pepa-our-life-in-15-songs-w500728/push-it-1987-w500791| title=Salt-N-Pepa: Our Life in 15 Songs| date=September 5, 2017|publisher=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=February 22, 2018}}</ref> The album ultimately sold 1.4 million copies worldwide.<ref name="RIAA">{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?share=4686| title=Gold and Platinum certifications earned by Salt 'n' Pepa|publisher=RIAA|language=en-US|access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref>

===1988–1992: ''A Salt with a Deadly Pepa'' and breakthrough===
Salt-N-Pepa's next album ''[[A Salt with a Deadly Pepa]]'' was released on July 26, 1988, contained the top 10 R&B hit "[[Shake Your Thang]]", featuring the [[go-go]] band [[Experience Unlimited|E.U.]] A top 20 R&B hit and a minor pop hit were seen in "Get Up Everybody (Get Up)" and "[[Twist and Shout]]", respectively; with "Twist and Shout" becoming a major hit in the UK (#4),<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=480}}</ref> and several European countries. The album became certified gold-status, for excess sales of 600,000 copies sold in the U.S. and a total of 800,000 copies sold internationally.<ref name="RIAA" />

The group's third album ''[[Blacks' Magic]]'' was released on March 19, 1990. Azor produced some songs on the album. As he was producing other acts, he agreed to let the artists work with different producers to finish the album. Salt and Spinderella took on some producing assignments themselves, and the trio hired different producers, such as Invincible's producer Dana Mozie. This was the first album to feature Roper on vocals as well as DJing. The result was six singles released by Next Plateau Records, several of which became hits: "Expression" (US #26, UK #40 in ''1990'', UK #23 in ''1992''), a platinum single that had been #1 on the R&B Chart for 8 weeks, and produced by Salt; "Independent"; "I Don't Know" (featuring [[Kid 'n Play]]); "[[Do You Want Me]]" (US #21, UK #5), certified gold; "[[Let's Talk About Sex]]" (US #13, UK #2), certified gold, and later re-recorded as "Let's Talk About AIDs"; and "You Showed Me" (UK #15). The album ultimately sold 1.5 million copies worldwide with 1 million of those sold in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} A greatest hits album called ''A Blitz of Salt-N-Pepa Hits'', featuring some remixed versions of songs from the group's first three albums later was released.{{fact|date=May 2021}}

===1993–1996: Groundbreaking success, ''Very Necessary''===
Salt-N-Pepa's fourth studio album ''[[Very Necessary]]'' was released on October 12, 1993 on [[London Records]]/[[PolyGram]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The album featured songwriting and production by Salt, Pepa, Spinderella, and Azor. Buoyed by the hits "[[Shoop (song)|Shoop]]" (U.S. #4, UK #13), co-produced by Pepa; "[[Whatta Man]]" (U.S. #3, UK #7) (featuring [[En Vogue]]); and "[[None of Your Business]]", a top 40 U.S. hit and a top 20 UK hit, the album eventually sold 7 million worldwide, with 5 million in the U.S. (5x platinum), making them the first female rap act (solo or group) to have a multi-platinum selling album. The group toured, and Salt co-starred in the movie ''[[Who's the Man?]]''. Pepa co-starred in the movie ''[[Joe's Apartment]]''. Pepa had been romantically involved with [[Treach]] of the rap group [[Naughty By Nature]]. The trio won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] in 1995 for the single "None of Your Business",<ref name="auto"/> making them the first female rap act to win Grammy. The album is the best-selling album by a female rap act.<ref name="medium"/>

===1997–2004: ''Brand New'' and hiatus===
By the time of their next album release, Salt-N-Pepa had gone through the legal process of completely breaking away from Azor, whom they accused of unfair royalty payments. Salt had stopped being romantically involved with him due to their many ups-and-downs. The trio also left London Records after one album and signed with Red Ant Records, though still distributed by [[PolyGram|PolyGram Records]] through its [[Island Records]] label. Red Ant offered the trio a $15 million signing bonus to sign. The group undertook production duties once again, but without Azor involved in any part of the album. The result was ''[[Brand New (Salt-n-Pepa album)|Brand New]]'', released on October 21, 1997, which hit stores a few months later. However, Red Ant filed for bankruptcy soon afterward, halting promotion on all its releases, including Salt-N-Pepa's album. The group toured in support of the album, but without any promotion or marketing from the now-defunct Red Ant, they only scored minor hits with "[[R U Ready]]" and "[[Gitty Up (song)|Gitty Up]]". The album was certified gold in the U.S. for sales of over 500,000 and sold approximately another 200,000 worldwide. Although not as big a seller as its predecessor, it kept intact an unbroken string of platinum and gold studio albums by the trio.{{fact|date=May 2021}}

In March 1999, Salt-N-Pepa embarked on a tour. Pepa married Treach of [[Naughty by Nature]] on July 27 of the same year. Salt-N-Pepa's greatest-hits album, titled ''[[The Best of Salt-N-Pepa]]'', was released in Europe on January 25, 2000. Pepa and Treach remained married for two years, but their tumultuous marriage ended in divorce on July 31, 2001. With no albums contractually due at the time, Salt decided to quit the group, stating she had enough of the music industry and no longer wanted to be involved in it. They officially disbanded in 2002. Some time later, Salt announced that she would release her first solo album, but never ended up doing so. She was featured on the remix version of the Salt City Six's "Shine" on the album ''[[Holy South Worldwide]]'', a compilation of Christian rap and Christian R&P (Rhythm & Praise) songs. The album was produced by ex-[[Three 6 Mafia]] member-turned-Christian rapper [[Mr. Del]]. Salt also revealed in later interviews{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} that she had suffered from [[bulimia]] "many years ago". Pepa appeared on the fifth season of VH-1's ''[[The Surreal Life]]''. Spinderella became a radio personality on [[KKLQ (FM)|KKBT 100.3]] in Los Angeles. She hosted ''The Backspin'' (with DJ Mo'Dav), a nationally syndicated weekly radio show featuring [[Old school hip hop|old school]] [[hip hop music]]. She also periodically DJs at various clubs. The trio was disbanded for a total of five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thesource.com/2016/03/10/first-ladies-of-rap-salt-n-pepa/|title=First Ladies Of Rap: Salt-N-Pepa|last=Orcutt|first=K.

Later in 2008, the trio performed at the [[BET Hip Hop Awards]]. Pepa released an autobiography titled ''Let's Talk About Pep'' in August 2008. The book was co-written by Karen Hunter. It features an introduction by [[Queen Latifah]], and an epilogue by [[Missy Elliott]].
