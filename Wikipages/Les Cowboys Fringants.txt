'''Les Cowboys Fringants''' are a [[Quebec]] [[folk rock]] music group formed in 1995 in [[Repentigny, Quebec]]. The French word ''fringant'' can be translated as "dashing", or "frisky".<ref>https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/les-cowboys-fringants-emc</ref>

They perform ''[[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]]'' [[néo-trad]] music (modernized Quebec [[folk music]] with a rock flavour) and draw on [[country music]]. They have an international underground following, especially in France, French-speaking [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]]. Band members hail from the [[Montreal]] suburbs of Repentigny and L'Assomption. The entire band collaborates on the lyrics, although guitarist Jean-François Pauzé often contributes more than the others.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160914035533/http://www.impudique.net/2006/05/interview-les-cowboys-fringants/</ref> The band are known for their live performances, captured on the ''[[Attache ta tuque!]]'' live album and the ''Centre Bell 30 décembre 2003'' DVD.

The band has won 17 [[Félix Awards]], including five at the [[42nd Felix Awards|2020 edition]] of the ceremony.<ref>https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/cowboys-fringants-louis-jean-cormier-among-winners-at-adisq-gala {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}</ref><ref>https://journalmetro.com/culture/2554611/gala-de-ladisq-lamerique-pleure-mais-pas-les-cowboys-fringants/</ref>

==Overview==
''Les Cowboys'' represent an important part of modern [[Music of Quebec|''Québécois'' music]]. They are part of the [[néo-trad]] movement that appeared in Quebec around the turn of the 21st century, and they embody a resurgence of [[Politics of Quebec|political]] songwriting. As the néo-trad movement adapts Quebec folklore into contemporary crafts, the political message of the band is a re-occurrence of 1970s [[chansonnier]] activist messages of left-wing [[Social democracy|solidarity]] and, recently, [[Quebec sovereignism|sovereignism]].<ref>http://www.mcgilltribune.com/a-e/les-antipodes-100819/</ref> They also sometimes adopt a [[minimalism|minimalist]] and [[dadaism|dadaesque]] style, a trend of the Quebec music scene of the 2000s – a decade of voluntary simple yet nonetheless quite intelligent and [[joual]] lyrics, therefore [[subversive]] and akin to a sort of lyrical [[naïve art]].

The group's songs cover environmentalism, and poverty, as well as the denouncing of [[consumerism]], [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[Gambling|state-controlled gambling]], and [[political apathy]]. While some of those subjects are serious in appearance, they are often treated in a light manner, sometimes even in a fun or ironic way. The band also deals with themes of [[History of Quebec|Quebec history]], [[Quebec independence]], suburban life, childhood and adolescence, [[kitsch]], relationships and sports. Their songwriting is renowned for having woven an elaborate tapestry of fictional characters with [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonal]] relationships, and sometimes a number of these characters appear in more than one song. Much like their writing, the clothes of the male members of the band are quite unique, sometimes purposely ''normal'' or ''kitsch'' and something of a [[postmodern]], second degree artistic statement.

The band themselves are noted fans of ''[[Passe-Partout]]'' composer Pierre F. Brault and have performed shows in his honour. They have also been influenced by French singer [[Renaud]], and his songs with political messages and local popular language.

Many of the idiosyncrasies of their music stem from Marie-Annick Lépine, a versatile musician, who makes the band line-up distinct from the conventional guitar-bass-drums-singer. Her talents contribute to the vivacious sounds of instruments like the violin, [[mandolin]] and [[accordion]].

The band went on tour in summer of 2011, visiting cities in Quebec, France and Switzerland.
