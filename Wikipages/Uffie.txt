Uffie studied [[fashion]] in Paris and attended the [[International School of Paris]]. In 2005 Uffie booked [[Feadz|DJ Feadz]] for a party she was organizing, and the two began a relationship shortly after. Feadz constantly pressured Uffie to provide vocals for some of his tracks and finally in late 2005 Uffie wrote "[[Pop the Glock]]" while on holiday and released it as a [[Myspace]] demo. Record label Arcade Mode gave the song a limited promo release in January 2006 with the B-side "Ready to Uff" which Feadz's labelmate [[Mr. Oizo]] produced. Soon after the release Uffie was signed to the French electronic music label [[Ed Banger Records]] by [[Busy P]]. Uffie then began dating graffiti artist and photographer [[André (artist)|André Saraiva]], and the two were married in August 2008.

==Career==

===2005–2008: Early years===
[[File:Uffie 2.jpg|thumb|left|Uffie, 2007]]
In early 2005, DJ Feadz, who was Uffie's boyfriend at the time, convinced her to provide vocals on his track "Uffie & Me" for his EP ''Forward 4'', which was when she began to develop an interest in making music. Later that year she wrote and recorded "Pop the Glock", which was produced by Feadz and began to shop the demo around to various record labels. "Pop the Glock" became her first single and was given a limited promo release on Arcade Mode in January 2006. Busy P, the owner of Ed Banger Records, heard the single and quickly signed both Uffie and Feadz to the label. "Pop the Glock" and its B-side "Ready to Uff" were both given an official release titled ''[[Pop the Glock/Ready to Uff]]'' on February 27, 2006 through Ed Banger Records. Both songs contained elements of [[electro (music)|electro]] and [[hip hop music|rap]]. The release also featured a remix by [[Sebastian (French electro artist)|SebastiAn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pop-the-glock-mw0000408421 |title=Pop the Glock – Uffie |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=October 14, 2011}}</ref>

===2009–2010: ''Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans''===
Uffie's record label Ed Banger Records first stated in late 2006 that her debut album would be released mid-to-late 2007, then sometime in 2008.<ref name="threedworld"/> Her debut album, titled ''[[Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans]]'', was eventually released June 15, 2010 in Europe and June 22, 2010 in the United States.

The title track "Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans" heavily samples [[The Velvet Underground]]'s 1970 song "[[Rock & Roll (The Velvet Underground song)|Rock & Roll]]"; during an interview with [[The Quietus]] in July 2010, Uffie claimed that it was "fucking difficult" to deal with [[Lou Reed]] while getting the sample cleared. When asked if he had heard the song, she stated, "Yes he has, he had to clear it. And it was a very not nice experience dealing with him, I have to say [...] I don't know what this guy's problem is but on the credits I think it even says something like he wrote it. He gets everything."<ref>{{cite web |last=Doran |first=John |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04630-uffie-interview-ed-banger-sex-dreams-and-denim-jeans |title=Kicking Against The Pricks: Uffie On Sex Dreams & Denim Jeans |publisher=[[The Quietus]] |date=July 15, 2010 |access-date=August 21, 2012}}</ref>
