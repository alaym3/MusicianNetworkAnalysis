'''Bright Eyes''' is an American [[indie rock]] band founded by singer-songwriter and guitarist [[Conor Oberst]]. It consists of Oberst, multi-instrumentalist and [[record producer|producer]] [[Mike Mogis]], arranger, composer and trumpet and piano player [[Nate Walcott]], and a rotating line-up of collaborators drawn primarily from [[Music of Omaha#Indie rock music|Omaha's indie music scene]]. Between 1998 and 2011, the band's albums were released through [[Saddle Creek Records]], a Nebraska-based label founded by Justin Oberst (Conor's brother) and Mogis. In January 2020, the band announced their return, having signed with [[Dead Oceans]].

==History==

===Early years (1995–1997)===
A founding member of [[Commander Venus]] – which disbanded in 1997 – guitarist/vocalist Conor Oberst turned to focus on his new project, Bright Eyes. In 1998, he released 20 of the songs he had been stockpiling as the first official Bright Eyes album, ''[[A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995–1997]].''<ref>

 }}</ref> The album saw Oberst beginning to experiment with [[drum machines]], keyboards and other instruments. The sound of the album ranges from bleating vocals to acoustic guitar songs and [[techno]]-style synthesizer instrumentals. Critical reaction was negative, with [[AllMusic]] saying that many of "the songs disintegrate as his vocals are reduced to the unintelligible babbling of a child. Any balance the music maintained up to that point, however fragile, is lost and so, more than likely, is the listener."<ref>{{cite web

===''Letting Off the Happiness'' (1998)===
On November 2, 1998, Saddle Creek released ''[[Letting Off the Happiness]]'', a ten-track album that displayed a more focused and clearer sound than the previous album. According to the Saddle Creek press release, it features members of [[Lullaby for the Working Class]], [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], and [[of Montreal]]. [[Park Ave.]] bandmate [[Neely Jenkins]] also contributed vocals. It was predominantly recorded in the Oberst family basement in Omaha on an analog eight track [[reel to reel]]; with some work also done at keyboardist [[Andy Lemaster]]'s [[Athens, Georgia]] studio.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Although almost all of the tracks feature a full band, "June on the West Coast" is performed with only acoustic guitar and vocals. "Padraic My Prince" gives a dramatic fictional account of the death of his baby brother, a story with a multitude of symbolic meanings. Oberst has referenced the song "Padraic My Prince" more than once in his music. The song "An Attempt To Tip the Scales" on the album ''[[Fevers and Mirrors]]'' has a faux-interview near the end of the track. Oberst is voiced by [[Todd Fink]], who was a label-mate and had played in other bands with Oberst.) The interviewer is [[Matt Silcock]], another labelmate on [[Saddle Creek Records]]. The interview was meant to be somewhat sarcastic and most of what the Oberst impersonator said was not true. At one point the interviewer asks the question: "So some of these references like babies in bathtubs are not biographical?" The Oberst impersonator replies: "Well I did have a brother who died in a bathtub . . . he drowned. Well actually I had five brothers that drowned." "No, I'm serious. My mother drowned one every year for five consecutive years. They were all named Padraic, and that's why they only got one song. It's kind of like walking out a door and discovering that it's a window."<ref>{{cite web

===''Every Day and Every Night'' EP (1999)===
In November 1999, Bright Eyes released the five-song ''[[Every Day and Every Night]]'' EP, which included "Neely O'Hara" and "A Perfect Sonnet."

===''Fevers and Mirrors'' and ''Lifted'' (2000–2002)===
In 2000, Bright Eyes released ''[[Fevers and Mirrors]],'' with new instruments such as the flute, piano, and [[accordion]] introduced into the song arrangements. After "An Attempt to Tip the Scales", there is a mock radio interview that features [[Todd Fink]] of [[The Faint]] doing an impression of Oberst while reading a script that Oberst wrote. In this interview, the fake Oberst presents a strange, contradictory explanation of his attitude towards his music. It acknowledges criticisms of his [[lyrics]] as overblown and insincere, which had begun to appear as the popularity of the band increased, but responds by stating that the lyrics are meant for personal interpretation. Oberst later commented that "It was a way to make fun of ourselves because the record is such a downer. I mean, that's one part of who I am but I also like laughing."<ref name="kittymagik">{{cite web

With ''[[Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground]]'' in 2002, Bright Eyes became one of the year's most celebrated "new" artists, despite having been recording under that [[moniker]] for a few years. They received national attention, including in several notable pieces in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', and ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', many of which proclaimed Conor Oberst to be a significant new artist.

Oberst stated that, before making this record, both he and Mike Mogis had an idea for a "sort of grandiose sound" that neither could really put into words. This was also the first album made after Oberst's break to play with [[Desaparecidos (band)|Desaparecidos]].

In November 2004, two Bright Eyes singles, "[[Lua (song)|Lua]]" and "[[Take It Easy (Love Nothing)]]", reached the two top spots on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] [[Hot 100 Single Sales]]. This was the first time this had happened on the list in seven years.

January 25, 2005 saw the release of two distinctly different Bright Eyes albums: the folk-influenced ''[[I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning]]'' and the electronic-pop inflected ''[[Digital Ash in a Digital Urn]]''. An extensive world tour followed the release of those albums. Part one of the tour was in support of ''I'm Wide Awake'' and the second part was in support of ''Digital Ash''. The first part was more similar to past tours with an intimate band setting. The decision to split the tour this way was practical as it would have been a "logistical nightmare" in terms of equipment and staff to perform songs from both albums simultaneously.<ref name="Faint">{{cite news |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/63515/bright-eyes-sets-tour-with-the-faint |title= Bright Eyes Sets Tour with the Faint |author= Jonathan Cohen |work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= March 28, 2005 |access-date= January 29, 2008 |url-status = live |archive-url = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20080129073751/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/63515/bright-eyes-sets-tour-with-the-faint |archive-date = January 29, 2008}}</ref> By the end of January 2005, ''I'm Wide Awake'' was No.&nbsp;10 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' charts while ''Digital Ash'' was No.&nbsp;15.

Bush. A 7" vinyl single of the song was sold at concerts soon after and was also released as a free track on iTunes. In November 2005, Bright Eyes performed "True Blue" on the children's television show ''[[Pancake Mountain]].''

Bright Eyes has actively protested against the [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] media company. Oberst has vocally advocated the boycotting of all [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] events, venues, and radio stations, perhaps most publicly at the Shortlist Awards show at the [[Wiltern Theatre]] in Los Angeles on October 5, 2003.<ref>{{cite web
