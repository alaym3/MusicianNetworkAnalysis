He continued making amateur games, and even began creating digital music to feature in them; he soon shared his music online through [[MP3.com]] under the name Trapezoid, which was later renamed to the anagram "Deporitaz" at the behest of another band already named Trapezoid. He also began composing [[MIDI]] music fragments that were referenced in his later works.<ref name="xoxo">{{cite web|title=Neil Cicierega, Internet Person – XOXO Festival (2016)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB7fqT1uAII|publisher=XOXO Festival|access-date=January 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206172904/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB7fqT1uAII|archive-date=February 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
===Animutation===
{{main|Animutation}}
Cicierega was first known for a series of [[dadaist]] or [[surrealist]] [[Flash animation]]s he termed "[[Animutation]]".<ref name="Salon">{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2001/04/26/animation_4/ |title=All hail Neil Cicierega |first1=Katharine |last1=Mieszkowski |first2=Amy |last2=Standen |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=April 26, 2001 |access-date=March 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704093451/https://www.salon.com/2001/04/26/animation_4/ |archive-date=July 4, 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Animutations feature arbitrary, nonsensical scenes and [[Popular culture|pop culture]] imagery and are typically set to novelty or foreign music, often from the Japanese version of ''[[Pokémon]]''.

===''Potter Puppet Pals''===
{{main|Potter Puppet Pals}}
Cicierega's ''Potter Puppet Pals'' is a comedy series which parodies the book series ''[[Harry Potter]]''. It originated as a pair of Flash animations on [[Newgrounds]] in 2003, and later resurfaced in the form of a series of live action [[puppet show]]s released onto YouTube and PotterPuppetPals.com, starting in 2006. The central characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series are portrayed simply by puppets. The most successful ''Potter Puppet Pals'' video, ''The Mysterious Ticking Noise'', currently has over 195 million views ({{as of|2021|March|df=US|lc=y}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx1XIm6q4r4|title=Potter Puppet Pals: The Mysterious Ticking Noise|last=Cicierega|first=Neil|date=March 23, 2007|via=YouTube|access-date=January 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110223945/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx1XIm6q4r4|archive-date=January 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Cicierega has done puppetry live at ''Harry Potter''-themed events.

An updated recording of the song was released to the [[Rock Band Network]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockband.com/songs/artists/Lemon+Demon |title=Lemon Demon on Rock Band Network |access-date=May 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715194151/http://www.rockband.com/songs/artists/Lemon+Demon |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In April 2009, Cicierega released his first four albums as free downloads on his site "neilcic.com", however they are now currently hosted on "lemondemon.com".

[[File:Neil Cicierega at ROFLCon II.jpg|thumb|Cicierega in 2010]]
Cicierega has also created [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] music under his own name. He released two mashup albums, ''[[Mouth Sounds]]''<ref name=avclub>{{cite news|first=Katie|last=Rife|date=April 29, 2014|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/mouth-sounds-punishing-90s-nostalgia-mixtape-world-203927|title="Mouth Sounds" is the punishing '90s nostalgia mixtape the world deserves|newspaper=[[The A.V.

All four albums are linked by their usage of [[Smash Mouth]]'s [[All Star (song)|"All Star"]], which is repeated frequently throughout ''Sounds'' and ''Moods'', and appears through Easter Eggs and references in ''Silence''. In ''Mouth Dreams'' "All Star" only makes one appearance in the track "Mouth Dreams (Extro)", where a heavily distorted edit of the lyrics can be heard.

===Windows 95 Tips, Tricks, and Tweaks (2012–2015)===
In October 2012, Cicierega created the darkly satirical "Windows 95 Tips, Tricks, and Tweaks" blog, located at windows95tips.com. In the blog's telling, [[Windows 95]] is a brooding, evil presence bent on dominating humanity. Most of the posts are faked error messages, with disturbing messages like "Windows needs a lock of your hair to continue," but presented in the exact graphical style of Windows 95. The blog has received favorable press attention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/messages-from-your-old-abandoned-computer-which-has-ac-1613188448|title=Messages From Your Old Abandoned Computer, Which Has Achieved AI|last=Trendacosta|first=Katharine|website=io9|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204505/https://io9.gizmodo.com/messages-from-your-old-abandoned-computer-which-has-ac-1613188448|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wirefresh.com/windows-95-tips-tricks-and-tweaks-a-lovely-parody-of-system-messages/|title=Windows 95 Tips, Tricks, and Tweaks – a lovely parody of system messages|last=Fletcher|first=Tony|date=November 14, 2012|website=wirefresh|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107015756/http://www.wirefresh.com/windows-95-tips-tricks-and-tweaks-a-lovely-parody-of-system-messages/|archive-date=January 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://technabob.com/blog/2012/11/19/windows-95-tips-tricks/|title=I Don't Remember Windows 95 Being This Terrifying|date=November 19, 2012|website=Technabob|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204544/https://technabob.com/blog/2012/11/19/windows-95-tips-tricks/|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Video games===
On February 26, 2015, Cicierega announced his first [[point-and-click adventure]] game, ''Icon Architect 1.0'', with themes similar to his "Windows 95 Tips, Tricks, and Tweaks" blog.

===Other works===
In February 2019, Cicierega created Endless Jeopardy, a Twitter account that automatically posts a bot-generated ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' prompt every hour and awards points to the most-liked responses within 15 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/18/18229785/twitter-bot-endless-jeopardy-launch|title=The best new Twitter bot is an endless game of Jeopardy where the winners are good at puns|first=Ashley|last=Carman|date=February 18, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=August 24, 2020}}</ref> In March 2019, he created "Bot Pops" (@BotPops), a Twitter account that writes setups for jokes on popsicle sticks, then finishes them with a punchline from the replies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/neilcic/status/1112170108472963072| title=Bot Pops |website=twitter.com |access-date=27 July 2020}}</ref> In April 2019 he created "4:3" (@FullscreenDream), a Twitter account that randomly makes GIFs from old commercials and CGI shorts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fullscreen Dream |url=https://twitter.com/neilcic/status/1247257116202713093 |website=twitter.com |access-date=27 July 2020}}</ref>

Cicierega was commissioned to make three songs for the TV series ''[[Gravity Falls]]'': a theme song, a musical number for [[Bill Cipher]] titled "It's Gonna Get Weird", and the song "Goat and a Pig" (a parody of [[Natalie Cole]]'s "[[This Will Be]]").<ref>{{Cite web|title=Neil Cicierega Tumblr.|url=https://neilblr.com/post/142982667678|access-date=2020-10-20|website=Neil Cicierega Tumblr.|language=en}}</ref> Both of Cicierega's theme songs and "It's Gonna Get Weird" were unused, but "Goat and Pig" appeared during the credits sequence of season 2 episode "The Love God".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Neil Cicierega Tumblr.|url=https://neilblr.com/post/103685262408|access-date=2020-10-20|website=Neil Cicierega Tumblr.|language=en}}</ref> One of the two unused openings appeared as a bonus track on the 2016 Lemon Demon album ''Spirit Phone'', titled "Gravitron".<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Spirit-Phone-Lemon-Demon/dp/B01CB5SHD8 Spirit Phone by Lemon Demon on Amazon Music - Amazon.com]</ref>
