==History==
===Formation and ''Up-Lifted EP'' (2009–2010)===
Fortunate Youth was formed in 2009 in [[Hermosa Beach, California]] by Travis Walpole, Dan Kelly, Jered Draskovich, Corey Draskovich and Greg Gelb during the birthday party of their friend and longtime manager, Jared Segawa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://showbams.com/2012/11/28/fortunate-youth-bring-their-reggae-stylings-to-saint-rocke/|title=Fortunate Youth bring their reggae stylings to Saint Rocke|date=November 28, 2012|publisher=showbams.com}}</ref> Gelb, Walpole, and Gonzales, along with Jered and Corey Draskovich, attended [[Mira Costa High School]] together prior to the band’s formation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tbrnews.com/entertainment/hermosa-beachs-fortunate-youth-reggae-band-celebrates-10-years-of-perpetual-motion/article_09ef00aa-ad64-11e9-b239-4fd4b7b8aec4.html|title = The Beach Reporter}}</ref> While in Rude Boy Roots Travis Walpole & Manager Jared Segawa witnessed singer Dan Kelly perform at an Open Mic Night in Hermosa Beach and recruited him to join the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepier.org/interview-fortunate-youth/|title=Fortunate Youth - Interview|publisher=thepier.org}}</ref> After their disbandment the remaining members (Walpole, Draskovich and Kelly) brought on Jered's younger brother Corey and Greg Gelb, who were members of the band Irie State of Mind, to play bass. They also added Ryan "Gonzo" Gonzales on guitar and Myles Poydras on drums.

Ever since the band's formation, Fortunate Youth is devoted to its roots with one simple mission; "spread peace, love, and unity with music". They released their first EP, ''Up-Lifted'', on January 8, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamsspace.com/music/f/fortunate-youth/up-lifted-ep|title=FORTUNATE YOUTH -UP-LIFTED (EP)|publisher=Jams Space}}</ref>

One year later on July 11, 2011, Fortunate Youth released their debut album ''Irie State of Mind'', premiering at #2 on the [[iTunes]] reggae charts and peaking at #13 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]] Top 100 Reggae Albums Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://first-avenue.com/performer/fortunate-youth|title=Performer - Fortunate Youth|publisher=first-avenue.com}}</ref>

In 2012, Fortunate Youth toured with [[The Expendables (American band)|The Expendables]] and Tribal Seeds while heavily promoting ''Irie State of Mind''. In September that year, Fortunate Youth performed a stripped down acoustic set featuring songs from both the ''Up-Lifted EP'' and ''Irie State of Mind'' during a Moboogie Loft Session.

The band released a six song extended play, ''The Dub Collections, Vol. 1'' that same year and began recording their third album, ''Don't Think Twice'', which was released on May 5, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Think-Twice-Fortunate-Youth/dp/B00W4IPL00|title=Fortunate Youth - Don't Think Twice|publisher=Amazon Music}}</ref> The album hit the #1 spot on both the Billboard and iTunes Reggae charts at the time of its release, and kicked off a "Don't Think Twice Fall Tour" that October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortunate-youth.com/fortunate-youths-dont-think-twice-fall-tour-2015/|title=Fortunate Youth - Don't Think Twice Tour 2015|publisher=Fortunate Youth}}</ref> While discussing the album, Kelly stated the meaning behind the record was, "Don't think twice, we all end up at the same place. If you look at the back of the album, two roads come back into each other. Y'know, no matter what you think, it's all gonna be...alright."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2016/01/exclusive-interview-fortunate-youth|title=Exclusive Interview: Fortunate Youth|publisher=The Bottom Line}}</ref>

In 2016, the band released their first official music video entitled "Burn One". The video was filmed at the members' place of residence in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]].

That same year, they released ''Love Is The Most High'', a compilation of love songs near [[Valentine's Day]].

In 2019, they collaborated with reggae musician [[Half Pint]] to record on their instrumental of "Pass the Herb". The collaboration was released as a limited edition [[vinyl record|vinyl]] during their subsequent tour, in addition to a music video being released. The band added Hawaii's Revelation Kalauli on drums after the departure of Jordan Rosenthal.

The band held an annual Thanksgiving show at Hermosa Beach venue Saint Rocke as a tribute to their city of origin from 2011 to 2019. Saint Rocke closed in 2020 as a result of statewide closures during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

On May 22, 2020, Fortunate Youth released a live album titled, ''Live From California'', a 20-song live performance set featuring the band's greatest hits.

In January 2021, Fortunate Youth was one of several reggae and punk bands on ''The House That Bradley Built'', a charity compilation honoring [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]'s lead singer [[Bradley Nowell]], helping musicians with substance abuse. They covered Sublime's song "Jailhouse" on Disc 2 of the Deluxe Edition.

===''Good Times (Roll On)'' (2021)===

Fortunate Youth recorded their fifth album, ''Good Times (Roll On)'', which released on September 30, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortunate-youth.com/music|title = MUSIC}}</ref> Starting in July 2020, mid-lockdown during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the album went through pre-production recordings at Kona Town Studio in [[Redondo Beach, California]] and then they tracked key essentials at the legendary [[Total Access Recording]] ([[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]]). The band also worked with reggae producer Lewis Richards at 17th Street Studios in [[Costa Mesa, California]] and tracked the horns remotely at Kromatic Sound recording studio on the east coast.

Jered Draskovich describes the album's title, "We are all living through this global event and to me we chose the title to help ensure that 'Good Times' are indeed going to 'Roll On' regardless of all the hardships that our recent environment has provided for everyone." Instead of 3 to 4 weeks, they worked on the album for nine months. Cory Draskovich adds, "2020 was a tough year, especially for the touring music industry. With the down time at home, we were able to spread out the sessions and take our time."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gratefulweb.com/articles/fortunate-youth-announces-new-album-good-times-roll|title = Fortunate Youth Announces New Album "Good Times (Roll On)"}}</ref> 

The 12 track album features special guests including, FY's touring horn section (trumpet and saxophone), Nathan Feinstein of [[Iya Terra]], former FY guitarist, Gonzo currently of [[Tribal Seeds]] on background vocals, Italy's reggae twins [[Mellow Mood (band)|Mellow Mood]], and [[Josh Heinrichs|Skillinjah & Dread Kennedy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://topshelfmusicmag.com/news/world-track-premiere-fortunate-youth-good-times-roll-on/|title=Fortunate Youth releases title track "Good Times (Roll On)" off forthcoming album}}</ref>

According to FY's [[Facebook]] page, ''Good Times (Roll On)'' is being considered for the [[64th Annual Grammy Awards]] for Best Reggae Album.

==Musical Influences==
The band has incorporated a wide variety of influences, including [[blues]], [[ska]], [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] into their sound, and cite acts such as [[Bob Marley]], [[Katchafire]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[The Grateful Dead]] as various influences.

==Other projects==
Since 2013, Fortunate Youth teamed up with L.A. Ale Works to create a special beer and 40-ounce can; first starting with a double-dry [[pale ale]] named "Sweet Sensi" after their song from ''It's All A Jam'' album. Next they developed a dry-hopped [[lager]] called "Live Life" from their 2019 EP of the same name. Then to commemorate the band's 2021 album, the brewing company came out with "Let the Good Times Roll On", a hazy [[Indian pale ale|IPA]] infused with pineapple and guava juice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craftbeerkings.com/products/la-ale-works-good-times-roll-on-fortunate-youth|title=LA Ale Works Good Times (Roll On) Fortunate Youth &#124; Craft Beer Kings}}</ref>

In October 2021, Fortunate Youth teamed up with The Wine Boss ([[Paso Robles]]) for a limited edition and hand numbered bottles of [[Cabernet Franc]] and [[Chenin Blanc]], both named after their latest album, "Good Times Roll On".
