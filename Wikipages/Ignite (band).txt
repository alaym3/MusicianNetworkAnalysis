'''Ignite''' is a [[melodic hardcore]] band from [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[California]]. Formed in 1993, their commercial breakthrough album, ''[[A Place Called Home (album)|A Place Called Home]]'', was released in 2000 on [[TVT Records]]. Prior to this release, they were well regarded among [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] fans, thanks in part to constant touring and having visited over 40 countries.

Much of the band's music is socially and politically aware. Ignite actively supports, and has given proceeds to, organizations such as [[Earth First]], [[Doctors Without Borders]], [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|Sea Shepherd]], and Pacific Wildlife. Former lead singer [[Zoltán Téglás|Zoltán "Zoli" Téglás]] has taken account of such issues as environmental concerns and vegetarianism—common topics found on ''A Place Called Home''. The legacy of [[Soviet Communism]] in Eastern Europe is another recurring theme, in part because of Teglas' Hungarian background.<ref>Band web site, [http://www.igniteband.com/bio.php "Bio" page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217052113/http://www.igniteband.com/bio.php |date=February 17, 2010 }}</ref>

== History ==
On May 9, 2005, they filmed a live DVD at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] with [[A Dying Dream]] and [[Eightyonedays]] in [[West Hollywood, California]]. The DVD was never released due to some technical problems with the quality, but on April 20, 2008, they gathered footage for an upcoming live DVD of their show in [[Leipzig]], Germany.<ref>Band web site, [http://www.igniteband.com/2008/08/27/dvd-update.html "DVD Update"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014223604/http://www.igniteband.com/2008/08/27/dvd-update.html |date=October 14, 2008 }}</ref>

On July 20, 2005, a deal was announced with Abacus Recordings, a subsidiary label of [[Century Media Records]]; the band's album ''Our Darkest Days'' was released on the label in May 2006.<ref>[http://noisefull.com/interviews/ignite-brett-rasmussen "Ignite (Brett Rasmussen)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719234549/http://noisefull.com/interviews/ignite-brett-rasmussen |date=July 19, 2018 }}.
