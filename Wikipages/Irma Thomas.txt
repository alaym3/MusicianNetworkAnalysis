==Life and career==
Born '''Irma Lee''', in [[Ponchatoula, Louisiana]], United States,<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1175}}</ref> as a teenager she sang with a Baptist church choir. She auditioned for [[Specialty Records]] at the age of 13. By the time she was 19, she had been married twice and had four children. Keeping her second ex-husband's surname, she worked as a waitress in New Orleans, occasionally singing with bandleader [[Tommy Ridgley]], who helped her land a record deal with the local [[Ric Records|Ron]] label. Her first single, "Don't Mess with My Man",<ref name="Larkin"/> was released in late 1959, and reached number 22 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart.<ref name="AMG"/>

She then began recording on the [[Minit Records|Minit]] label, working with songwriter and producer [[Allen Toussaint]] on songs including "[[It's Raining (Irma Thomas song)|It's Raining]]" and "Ruler of My Heart", which was later reinterpreted by [[Otis Redding]] as "Pain in My Heart".<ref name="Larkin"/> [[Imperial Records]] acquired Minit in 1963, and a string of successful releases followed. These included "Wish Someone Would Care", her biggest national hit;<ref name="Larkin"/> its B-side "[[Breakaway (Irma Thomas song)|Breakaway]]", written by Jackie DeShannon and Sharon Sheely (later covered by [[Tracey Ullman]], among others).

"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)" was co-written by a young [[Randy Newman]] and future country star [[Jeannie Seely]]. This song has gained renewed appreciation as a result of its inclusion in numerous episodes of the science fiction anthology television series ''[[Black Mirror]]'', stretching back to the first season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/black-mirror-anyone-who-knows-what-love-is-charlie-brooker/|title=Here's Why You Hear That One Song Over and Over in 'Black Mirror'|date=February 11, 2018|website=Thewrap.com|access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref> On its B-side is "[[Time Is on My Side]]",<ref name="Larkin"/> a song previously recorded by [[Kai Winding]] and later by the [[Rolling Stones]].<ref name="AMG"/>

Her first four Imperial singles all charted on ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop chart, but her later releases were less successful.<ref name="AMG"/> Unlike her contemporaries Aretha Franklin, [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Dionne Warwick]], she never managed to cross over into mainstream commercial success. She recorded for [[Chess Records]] in 1967–1968 with some success; her version of the Otis Redding song "Good to Me" reached the R&B chart.<ref name="Larkin"/><ref name="AMG"/> She then relocated to California, releasing records on various small labels, before returning to Louisiana, and in the early 1980s opened the Lion's Den Club.<ref name="AMG"/>

''[[Down by Law (film)|Down by Law]]'', the 1986 independent film by [[Jim Jarmusch]] featured "It's Raining" in the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090967/soundtrack|title=Down by Law (1986) : Soundtracks|website=IMDb.com |access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> The film's actors [[Roberto Benigni]] and [[Nicoletta Braschi]], whose characters fell in love in the movie, danced to the song.

After several years' break from recording, she was signed by [[Rounder Records]], and in 1991 earned her first [[Grammy Award]] nomination for ''Live! Simply the Best'', recorded in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulexpress.net/irmathomas.htm|title=Irma Thomas – Soul Express 4/1994|website=Soulexpress.net|access-date=September 21, 2015}}</ref> She subsequently released a number of traditional gospel albums, together with more secular recordings. The album ''Sing It!'' (1998) was nominated for a Grammy in 1999.<ref name="AMG"/>
