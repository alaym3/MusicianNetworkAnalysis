'''Edwin Starr''' (born '''Charles Edwin Hatcher'''; January 21, 1942 – April 2, 2003)<ref name="Obit"/> was an American singer and songwriter. Starr was famous for his [[Norman Whitfield]]-produced [[Motown]] singles of the 1970s, most notably the number-one hit "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]".

Starr was born in [[Nashville]] and raised in [[Ohio]], and later lived in [[Detroit]] while singing for [[Ric-Tic Records|Ric-Tic]] and [[Motown]] Records. He was backed by the band that would become known as "[[Black Merda]]". Hawkins and Veasey of the group played on most of his early hits on the Ric Tic Label. Starr's songs "25 Miles" and "Stop the War Now" were also major successes, in 1969 and 1971 respectively.  In the 1970s Starr's base shifted to the United Kingdom, where he continued to produce music, and resided until his death.

==Early life==
Charles Edwin Hatcher was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1942.  He and his cousins, soul singers Roger and Willie Hatcher, moved to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where they were raised.

In 1957, Starr formed a [[doo-wop]] group, the Future Tones, and began his singing career. Starr lived in Detroit in the 1960s and recorded at first for the small [[Ric-Tic Records|Ric-Tic]] label, part of the [[Golden World Records|Golden World]] recording company, and later for [[Motown]] Records (under the Gordy Records imprint), after the latter absorbed Ric-Tic in 1968.

The song that launched his career was "Agent Double-O-Soul" (1965), a reference to the [[James Bond]] films, already popular at the time. Other early hits included "Headline News", "Back Street", and "S.O.S. (Stop Her on Sight)". While at Ric-Tic, he wrote the song, "Oh, How Happy", a #12 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit in 1966 for [[The Shades of Blue]] (he would go on to release a version of the song with [[Blinky (singer)|Blinky]] in 1969) and sang lead for the Holidays on their #12 R&B hit, "I'll Love You Forever". At Motown he recorded a string of singles before enjoying international success with "25 Miles", which he co-wrote with producers Johnny Bristol and Harvey Fuqua. It peaked at #6 in both the Hot 100 and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B Charts]] in 1969.

It was when Motown's [[Berry Gordy]] became frustrated with smaller labels like Ric-Tic stealing some of the success of his company that he bought out the label. Many of Starr's Ric-Tic songs (subsequently owned by Motown) like "Back Street" and "Headline News" became favored [[northern soul]] classics. His early Ric-Tic hit "Stop Her On Sight (S.O.S.)" was reissued in Britain (with "Headline News" as its [[B-side]]) in 1968, and it performed better than the original release on the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Chart]], surpassing the original #35 and peaking at #11. His 1970 song "Time" also helped to establish him as a prominent artist on the northern soul scene.

==Career==
The biggest hit of Starr's career, which cemented his reputation, was the [[Vietnam War]] [[protest song]] "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]" (1970). Starr's intense vocals transformed a [[The Temptations|Temptations]] album track into a number one chart success, which spent three weeks in the top position on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, an anthem for the [[antiwar movement]] and a cultural milestone that continues to resound in movie [[soundtrack]]s and [[hip hop]] music samples. It sold over three million copies, and was awarded a [[Music recording certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

''Involved'' also featured another song of similar construction titled "Stop the War Now", which was a minor hit in its own right. Music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called the latter album "[[Norman Whitfield]]'s peak production".<ref name="CG"/>

Starr continued to record, most notably the song "Hell Up in Harlem" for the 1974 film ''[[Hell Up in Harlem]]'', which was the sequel to ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]'', an earlier hit with a soundtrack by [[James Brown]]. In 1979, Starr reappeared on the charts with a pair of [[disco]] hits, "[[Contact (Edwin Starr song)|(Eye-to-Eye) Contact]]" and "[[H.A.P.P.Y. Radio (song)|H.A.P.P.Y. Radio]]". "Contact" was the more successful of the two, peaking at #65 on the US pop charts, #13 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart, #1 on the dance chart, and #6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. "H.A.P.P.Y. Radio" was also a top ten hit in the UK, reaching #9 on the chart in mid-1979. By now, he had joined the well-established disco boom and had further singles on [[20th Century Records]]. Over the years, he released tracks on a variety of labels, including Avatar, Calibre, 10 Records, Motown (a return to his former label for a 1989 [[remix]] of "25 Miles"), Streetwave and Hippodrome. His Starr café empire still enjoys success in and around Essex.

In 1985, Starr released "It Ain't Fair". Despite garnering the attention of many in the soul and dance clubs, it fell short of becoming a major hit (managing a #56 on the UK Charts). "It Ain't Fair," along with several other singles released around the same time, would later appear on Starr's ''Through the Grapevine'' album, which was not released until 1990.  Starr appeared on the charity number one single [[Let It Be (Beatles song)#Ferry Aid version|"Let It Be" by Ferry Aid]] in 1987. Later that year, Starr teamed up with the [[Stock, Aitken and Waterman]] production company for the club hit "Whatever Makes Our Love Grow". In 1989, a number 17 UK hit by the [[Cookie Crew]] called "Got to Keep On" [[sampling (music)|sampled]] a portion of "25 Miles".<ref>{{cite book|last=Warwick|first=Neil |author2=Kutner, Jon|others=Brown, Tony|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts: Singles and Albums|publisher=Omnibus Press|page=261|isbn=1-84449-058-0}}</ref> This track was then featured on a 1990 dance [[Medley (music)|medley]] made for the [[BRIT Awards]], which made number 2 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/retrocharts/1990-March.html |title=Retrochart for March 1990 |publisher=everyHit.com |access-date=2015-08-25}}</ref> A club mix of various artists, it included the previous years remix of "25 Miles".

In 1989, Starr also joined [[Ian Levine]]'s [[Motorcity Records]], releasing six singles and the album ''Where Is the Sound'', as well as co-writing several songs for other artists on the label. Starr resurfaced briefly in 2000 to team up with the UK band [[Utah Saints]] to record a new version of "[[Funky Music Sho' 'Nuff Turns Me On]]". He appeared again in 2002 to record a song with the British musician [[Jools Holland]], singing "Snowflake Boogie" on Holland's compact disc ''More Friends''; and to record another track with Utah Saints, a so-far-unreleased version of his number one hit "War"—his last recording.

In 1995, Starr featured in [[Blue Juice]]''''',''''' a 1995 British [[drama film]] as a soul singer named Ossie Sands. The songs featured were recorded by Starr for the film. The film has the added attraction of being possibly the first film to include [[Northern soul|Northern Soul]] as a sub-plot.<ref>{{cite web|date=6 December 1997|title=Soul Source, "Blue Juice Review from 90s"|url=https://www.soul-source.co.uk/articles/soul-articles/blue-juice-review-from-90s-r211/|url-status=live|access-date=25 February 2021}}</ref>

In late 2002, Edwin Starr appeared with many R&B stars on the "Rhythm, Love, and Soul" edition of the PBS series American Soundtrack. His performance of "25 Miles" was included on the accompanying live album that was released in 2004.

Starr remained a hero on England's [[northern soul]] circuit and moved to England in 1983, continuing to live there for the remainder of his life. He based himself in the [[Midlands|English Midlands]], living for many years at [[Pooley Hall]] at [[Polesworth]], [[Warwickshire]], before moving to [[Bramcote]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]<ref name="Obit">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/apr/04/guardianobituaries.politics|title=Obituary: Edwin Starr|first=Dave|last=Laing|date=April 4, 2003|access-date=December 5, 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref><ref name="BMES">{{cite web |title=Soul legend Edwin Starr’s band and brother Angelo coming to The Night Owl in Birmingham |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/soul-legend-edwin-starrs-band-9769508 |publisher=Birmingham Mail |access-date=30 January 2021 |date=31 July 2015}}</ref>

Edwin Starr was inducted into the inaugural class of the Official Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame at [[Cleveland State University]] in August 2013.
