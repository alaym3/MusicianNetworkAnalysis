'''Fayyaz Hashmi''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|فیاض ہاشمی}}}}; 1920 {{endash}} 2011) was a [[Pakistan]]i [[poet]] and screenwriter who worked both in the [[Cinema of India|Indian]] and [[Cinema of Pakistan|Pakistani film industry]]. He penned some memorable songs such as the famous ghazal [[Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo]]<ref name=TheHindu>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/11/13/stories/2006111300340800.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203053307/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/11/13/stories/2006111300340800.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 December 2013 |title=When mood and melody merged |date=13 November 2006 |newspaper=The Hindu (newspaper) |accessdate=13 July 2021}}</ref><ref name=outlook/> and ''Tasveer teri dil mera behela nah sake gi''. The latter made the singer [[Talat Mahmood]] famous in India back in 1941 and was instrumental in introducing him to the Calcutta film industry.<ref name=IndianExpress>{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/remembering-talat-mahmood/947227/ |newspaper=The Indian Express (newspaper) |title=Remembering Talat Mahmood |author=Muhammad Zulqarnain Zulfi|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=13 July 2021}}</ref>  

A little known fact about him is that he wrote the famous 'Na tum mere na dil mera', that was sung by Kamla Jharia, among many others. One of the couplets from this ghazal became popular that reads:
 
'aye bas naadaniyon par apni naaz karte hain,
abhi dekhi kahan hain aapne naadaniyan meri' 

and then

"Yeh Raatein, Yeh Mausam, Yeh Hansanaa Hansaana, 
Mujhe Bhool Jana, Inhein Na Bhulana" sung by [[Pankaj Mullick]] (a non-film song).<ref name=outlook/>
