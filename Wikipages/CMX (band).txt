[[File:CMX Suomi Pop -festivaaleilla Jyväskylässä.jpg|thumb|CMX (band)]]
'''CMX''', originally '''Cloaca Maxima''', is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[rock music|rock]] band. They originally played [[hardcore punk]], but soon expanded to play a wide variety of rock formats, including [[progressive rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and mainstream rock 'n' roll. Throughout their career, they have been influenced by progressive rock bands such as [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[King Crimson]]. The progressive influence is most evident on their albums ''[[Dinosaurus Stereophonicus]]'' (2000) and ''[[Talvikuningas]]'' (2007).

CMX have gradually gained large-scale mainstream following in Finland. They are especially known for the poetic lyrics of [[A. W. Yrjänä]] that often contain references to [[mythology]] and [[religion]]. Finnish rock magazines, particularly ''[[Rumba (magazine)|Rumba]]'', have named them Best Band of the Year multiple times, and even Best Band of All Time on one occasion.

== History ==
=== Early years 1985-1990 ===
CMX was founded on [[Good Friday]] 1985 in [[Tornio]], [[Finland]] by [[A. W. Yrjänä]] (18 at the time) and Pekka Kanniainen.<ref name="finpop">{{cite web | url=http://www.finpop.net/?p=32 | title=Janne Halmkrona's interview | publisher=finpop.net | accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref> The band's original name, [[Cloaca Maxima]], [[Latin]] for the "Greatest Sewer", was taken from a footnote of [[H. P. Blavatsky]]'s book [[Isis Unveiled]].<ref name="bio1">{{cite web | url=http://www.cmx.fi/bio/index.php?bio=1 | title=CMX Biography 1985-1989 | publisher=The band's official website | accessdate=January 30, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107203847/http://cmx.fi/bio/index.php?bio=1# | archive-date=2013-11-07 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Over the next six months Kanniainen became the drummer, Yrjänä the bassist and singer, and Kimmo Suomalainen the guitarist. The band played mainly fast [[hardcore punk]] with the vocals sung in English; the language, however, soon changed into Finnish. The band shortened its name to CMX in 1986.

The first [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Johannes Kastaja]]'' was recorded 1987 in [[Kemi]] and released in 1988. The same year CMX performed for the first time outside of Tornio and its neighbouring areas, at [[Lieto]] punk rock festival. In 1989 the EP ''[[Raivo (album)|Raivo]]'' was released on a small label Bad Vugum. The band's first appearance at the [[Tavastia Club]] in [[Helsinki]] followed.<ref name="bio1"/>

The first full-length album ''[[Kolmikärki]]'' was released in January 1990. The album received practically no radio airplay and sold less than 2,000 copies during the first year. During the spring Pasi Isometsä was brought on as a second guitarist, however he would only stay in the band for less than a year. As the band moved south to [[Helsinki]] in late 1990, guitarists Isometsä and Suomalainen weren't willing to leave Tornio and eventually quit the band. They were replaced by [[Janne Halmkrona]] and, in early 1991, Timo Rasio.<ref name="bio2">{{cite web | url=http://www.cmx.fi/bio/index.php?bio=2 | title=CMX Biography 1990-1994 | publisher=The band's official website | accessdate=January 30, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818173654/http://cmx.fi/bio/index.php?bio=2# | archive-date=2013-08-18 | url-status=dead }}</ref> This lineup would remain the same for the following six years. In early 1991 they recorded another EP, ''[[Tanssitauti]]'', and later that year the band's second full-length album, ''[[Veljeskunta]]''. The aggressive hardcore approach of the album was generally well received by the press.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r429083|pure_url=yes}} CMX's ''Veljeskunta'' reviewed] by [[Allmusic]]</ref><ref>[http://desibeli.net/arvostelu/391 ''Veljeskunta Gold'' reviewed] by [http://desibeli.net Desibeli.net]</ref>

=== Mainstream success ===
1992's ''[[Aurinko]]'', released by the international [[EMI]] [[record label]], won CMX both the Album of the Year and Band of the Year awards in a poll by Finnish ''[[Rumba (magazine)|Rumba]]'' music magazine.<ref name="bio2"/> The album saw CMX largely abandon the hardcore style in favor of more accessible mainstream rock songs.

In 1994, ''[[Aura (CMX album)|Aura]]'' was released. The album continued the trend towards mainstream audiences, which was criticized by the band's early hardcore fan base. Aura contained some of the band's best known songs to date, including the etheric ballad "Ruoste" and the radio-friendly (though lyrically hardly traditional) love song "[[Kultanaamio]]".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r429085|pure_url=yes}} ''Aura'' reviewed] by [[Allmusic]]</ref>

The trend continued with ''[[Rautakantele]]'', released in 1995 and produced by Yrjänä. [[Essi Wuorela]] appeared as a guest artist.<ref>[http://www.finnmusic.net/main.php?60565c55480775535112 ''Rautakantele'' reviewed] by [http://www.finnmusic.net Finnmusic.net]</ref> "[[Pelasta maailma]]", the only single from the album, received some radio airplay and would later be covered by both [[Antti Tuisku]] and [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]].<ref>[http://www.findance.com/arvostelut.php?id=2115 Antti Tuisku: ''Minun jouluni'' reviewed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025080441/http://www.findance.com/arvostelut.php?id=2115 |date=2007-10-25 }} at [http://www.findance.fi Findance.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?addvote=4&nid=358  Vesa-Matti Loiri: ''Ivalo'' reviewed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526101300/http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?addvote=4&nid=358 |date=2011-05-26 }} by [http://www.soundi.fi Soundi.fi]</ref>

=== Changes ===
For their next album, the band changed radically their approach to recording. ''[[Discopolis]]'' (1996) was engineered with [[Pro Tools]] in the studio and made heavy use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] to edit the songs together from a set of short [[guitar]] [[riff]]s. The album received mixed reviews: [[Allmusic]] wrote that "friends of the modern music will find ''Discopolis'' very attractive",<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r429087|pure_url=yes}} ''Discopolis'' reviewed] by [[Allmusic]]</ref> while Tero Valkonen, on his analysis of "[[Kultanaamio]]", expressed his dislike for the album, and called the song "Paha" a "rotten bad joke".<ref>[http://www.cmx.fi/arkisto/reader.php?file=kultanaamio_analyysi "Kultanaamio eli viha on kaunis sana"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224094622/http://www.cmx.fi/arkisto/reader.php?file=kultanaamio_analyysi |date=2008-02-24 }} by Tero Valkonen. Originally published in ''[[Rumba (magazine)|Rumba]]'', 24/98</ref> ''Discopolis'' was the first CMX album to enter the Finnish album [[Record chart|charts]], peaking at No 3.<ref name="finnishcharts">[http://finnishcharts.com/search.asp?search=CMX&cat=s CMX chart statistics] at [http://www.finnishcharts.com finnishcharts.com]</ref> In 1997, drummer Kanniainen left CMX saying that the band had become too professional for him. Tuomas Peippo was hired to replace him. The same year CMX released a three-CD [[compilation album]], ''[[Cloaca Maxima (album)|Cloaca Maxima]]''.

=== 1998-2003 ===
The first album with new drummer Tuomas Peippo, ''[[Vainajala]]'' (1998), was recorded in a [[Log cabin|cabin]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] and produced by [[Faith No More]] bassist [[Billy Gould]]. According to the band the deliberately minimalistic sound of the album was largely thanks to Gould.<ref>[http://www.melankolia.net/musiikki/levyt/cmx.html#vaina ''Vainajala'' reviewed] by [http://www.melankolia.net Melankolia.net]</ref> ''Vainajala'' was the first CMX album to top the Finnish album charts.<ref name="finnishcharts"/> At the [[Provinssirock]] festival 1999, CMX announced that they intended to stop playing live in order to concentrate on their studio work.<ref>[http://www.turunsanomat.fi/ajassa/?ts=1,3:1007:0:0,4:7:0:1:1999-06-20,104:7:29380,1:0:0:0:0:0 "Ultra Bra ja Don Huonot Provinssin suosikkeja"], [[Turun Sanomat]], 20 June 1999</ref>

''[[Dinosaurus Stereophonicus]]'' (2000) was CMX's nod toward 1970s [[progressive rock]] bands, such as [[King Crimson]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Yes (band)|Yes]].<ref>[http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=5088 ''Dinosaurus Stereophonicus'' reviewed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526101346/http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=5088 |date=May 26, 2011 }} by [http://www.soundi.fi Soundi.fi]</ref> A two-hour [[double album]], it contains progressive elements not before associated with CMX: Three [[instrumental]] pieces, an emphasis on [[Musical keyboard|keyboards]], long [[solo (music)|solos]], and song lengths exceeding 10 minutes. CMX's first number 1 single, the peaceful and melodic "Myrskyn ratsut" was released before the album and featured [[string instrument|strings]] and [[steel guitar]].<ref>[http://www.melankolia.net/musiikki/levyt/cmx.html#myrskyn ''Myrskyn ratsut'' reviewed] by [http://www.melankolia.net Melankolia.net]</ref>

By the time ''[[Isohaara]]'' (2002) was released, CMX had already abandoned the idea of becoming a full-time studio band and started touring again.<ref>[http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=3958 ''Isohaara'' reviewed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414011746/http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=3958 |date=April 14, 2011 }} by [http://www.soundi.fi Soundi.fi]</ref> The album was considered slightly [[heavy metal music|heavier]] than its predecessor, and the guitar riffs of "Minne paha haudattiin" were compared to the music of [[Timo Rautiainen & Trio Niskalaukaus]] and [[Kotiteollisuus]].<ref>[http://www.noise.fi/levyarvostelut/?id=42 "Minne paha haudattiin" reviewed] by [http://www.noise.fi Noise.fi]</ref> The album's lyrics concentrated less on [[mythology]] and [[religion]] and were closer to traditional rock lyrics, albeit keeping a dark, melancholy tone. Although less present than on ''[[Dinosaurus Stereophonicus]]'' (2000), progressive influences hadn't been totally abandoned: The band uses a child [[choir]] on the title track and the [[uptempo]] rocker "Pohjoista leveyttä" contains a [[harmonica]] solo.<ref>[http://www.noise.fi/levyarvostelut/?id=44 ''Isohaara'' reviewed] by [http://www.noise.fi Noise.fi]</ref>

Bad Vugum re-released the first two CMX albums in 2002 as "Gold" versions that also included their early EPs. ''[[Kolmikärki]] Gold'' included EPs ''[[Johannes Kastaja]]'' (1987) and ''[[Raivo (album)|Raivo]]'' (1989), and ''[[Veljeskunta]] Gold'' contained EPs ''[[Tanssitauti]]'' (1990) and ''[[Musiikin ystävälliset kasvot]]'' (1998).

A year after ''Isohaara'', ''[[Aion (CMX album)|Aion]]'' (2003) followed. The album was put together around a common theme of the essence and [[symbol]]ism of [[evil]].<ref>[http://desibeli.net/arvostelu/796 ''Aion'' reviewed] by [http://www.desibeli.net Desibeli.net]</ref> It was both a critical and commercial success and was described as a highly [[experimental music|experimental]] album for such an established band. Guitarist Halmkrona plays [[trumpet]] on the first track of the album, and [[violin]]s and [[synthesizer]]s are heard on several songs.<ref>[http://www.noise.fi/levyarvostelut/?id=1556 ''Aion'' reviewed] by [http://www.noise.fi Noise.fi]</ref> Both "Melankolia" and, four months later, "Palvelemaan konetta" peaked the singles chart.<ref name="finnishcharts"/>

=== 2004-present ===
[[Image:CMX-yrjänä.jpg|thumb|A. W. Yrjänä in 2006.]]
The band's second three-CD compilation [[Cloaca Maxima II]], released in 2004, followed the format of the 1997 ''[[Cloaca Maxima]]'' closely. Both consisted of 44 songs on three CDs, the first one concentrating on faster rock songs, the second on ballads and the third on B-sides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=2091 |title=Levyarvostelu: CMX - Cloaca Maxima II |publisher=Soundi.fi |accessdate=2009-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414012124/http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=2091# |archive-date=2011-04-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The compilation covered four albums from ''[[Vainajala]]'' (1998) to ''[[Aion (CMX album)|Aion]]'' (2003) and also featured three previously unreleased songs.<ref name="desibeli_cm2">{{cite web|url=http://desibeli.net/arvostelu/1594 |title=Levyarvio: CMX: Cloaca Maxima II |publisher=Desibeli.net |date=2005-03-19 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref> The band had originally intended the compilation to only include the B-sides, and indeed the third disc was the one that received some praise from the press.<ref name="desibeli_cm2"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noise.fi/levyarvostelut/?id=3027 |title=CMX - Cloaca Maxima II -arvostelu |publisher=Noise.fi |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref>

''[[Pedot]]'' (2005) showed some influences from contemporary rock bands such as [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[A Perfect Circle]] and [[System of a Down]], and combined straight rock songs with heavier and lighter elements, such as the minimalistic ballad "Eteläisen tähtitaivaan kartoitus" and the aggressive [[Bass drum#Double bass drum|double bass drum]] sound of the title track.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=1170 |title=Levyarvostelu: CMX - Pedot |publisher=Soundi.fi |accessdate=2009-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801030129/http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=1170 |archivedate=2010-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noise.fi/levyarvostelut/?id=4999 |title=CMX - Pedot -arvostelu |publisher=Noise.fi |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref> "Uusi ihmiskunta" was a number one hit, the sixth one for CMX in just over five years.<ref name="finnishcharts"/>

On the Tuuliajolla 2006 tour on lake [[Saimaa]], CMX recorded a song in collaboration with fellow rock bands [[Kotiteollisuus]] and [[51Koodia]]. Ambiguosly named "Vapaus johtaa kansaa" ("[[Liberty Leading the People]]") was written by Yrjänä and released in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |author=www.findance.com |url=http://www.findance.com/arvostelut.php?id=2547 |title=Arvostelu / Review - CMX & Kotiteollisuus: Vapaus johtaa kansaa - Findance.com - Suomen suvaitsevaisin musiikkimedia |publisher=Findance.com |accessdate=2009-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711003115/http://www.findance.com/arvostelut.php?id=2547 |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref> It reached number one on the Finnish singles chart.<ref name="finnishcharts"/>

CMX's following album, ''[[Talvikuningas]]'' (2007), was a [[science fiction|space-themed]] [[rock opera]] and contains only one song, divided onto 12 tracks without pauses. Originally, the story about the power and fall of the Winter King (Talvikuningas in Finnish) was going to be the story of a [[novel]] by Yrjänä. The first edition of the album was soon sold out despite being much more expensive than a regular album.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ilkka Mattila Helsingin Sanomat |url=http://www.hs.fi/viihde/artikkeli/CMX+s%C3%A4velsi+rockoopperan/1135229922544 |title=CMX sävelsi rockoopperan - HS.fi - Viihde |publisher=HS.fi |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref> The press reviews were largely positive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desibeli.net/arvostelu/3152 |title=Levyarvio: CMX: Talvikuningas |publisher=Desibeli.net |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noise.fi/levyarvostelut/?id=8068&r=1 |title=CMX - Talvikuningas -arvostelu |publisher=Noise.fi |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref> ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' newspaper called the album CMX's "third [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]]" after ''[[Aura (CMX album)|Aura]]'' and ''[[Aion (CMX album)|Aion]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyt.hs.fi/musiikki/artikkeli/1135230090538 |title=CMX: Talvikuningas - nyt.hs.fi - Musiikki |publisher=nyt.hs.fi |date=2009-10-03 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref> while ''Soundi'' music magazine argued that the album will probably be a mere curiosity in the CMX saga.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=6671&levyarvostelu=CMX_Talvikuningas |title=Levyarvostelu: CMX - Talvikuningas |publisher=Soundi.fi |accessdate=2009-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015832/http://www.soundi.fi/arvostelut?nid=6671&levyarvostelu=CMX_Talvikuningas# |archive-date=2008-04-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

CMX's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Iäti]]'', was released by [[EMI]] on 29 September 2010. The singles released before the album were called "Sateenkaaren pää" and "Linnunrata".

Drummer [[Tuomas Peippo]] left the band in 2012 due to his job as a dentist. The fourteenth studio album, ''[[Seitsentahokas]]'', was released in February 2013. The drummer for the album was [[Olli-Matti Wahlström]], known for bands [[Kumikameli]] and [[51koodia]], who later in the spring became the official member of the band. The first single released from the album was "Kusimyrsky" in November 2012, followed by "Rikkisuudeltu" in February 2013.

Fifteenth studio album [[Mesmeria]] was released in 2015. It was produced by [[Arto Tuunela]] and first without producer Rauli Eskolin since Isohaara released in 2002.

== Popularity ==
CMX are practically unknown outside Finland. However, [[Billy Gould]] of [[Faith No More]] produced their 1998 album ''[[Vainajala]]''.

Their early EPs and albums up until ''[[Veljeskunta]]'' (1991) have been mainly [[hardcore punk|hardcore]], although combining a variety of styles. From ''[[Aurinko]]'' (1992) onwards, hardcore has been merely an ephemeral element in their varied expression. Progressive rock elements are always present in the band's music, most evidently on ''[[Dinosaurus Stereophonicus]]'' (2000) and ''[[Talvikuningas]]'' (2008). Many of the band's best known songs are [[ballad]]s, such as "Ruoste" and "[[Pelasta maailma]]".
