'''Os Tincoãs''' were a [[Brazil]]ian popular music band from [[Bahia]], primarily active in the 1960s and 1970s. They are named after the Tincoã bird, a subspecies of the [[Squirrel Cuckoo]] native to Brazil. The music of Os Tincoãs was heavily influenced by Bahia's [[Candomblé]] tradition.

Surviving member [[Mateus Aleluia]] is still very active in singing and songwriting. Aleluia moved to [[Angola]] in 1983 where he began to develop a cultural research project for the Angolan government. In 2002 he returned to Brazil and in 2010 he debuted with "Cinco Sentidos", his first solo album, produced by the Garimpo label and sponsored by [[Petrobrás]]. In 2017 he released "Fogueira Doce", a new album produced independently.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Compositores|first=União Brasileira de|title=Mateus Aleluia lança segundo disco solo|url=http://www.ubc.org.br/publicacoes/noticias/7282|language=pt-br}}</ref>
