'''Upchurch''' is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Borough of Swale|Swale]] district of [[Kent]], England. It is situated just off the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2 road]], between [[Rainham, Kent|Rainham]] and [[Sittingbourne]].

==History==
Upchurch lay on a pre-Roman trackway; the many linking roads are the result of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] occupation, which had built a community of ex-soldiers who wanted to settle in England. A Roman cemetery has been discovered here. There were also several Roman [[pottery]] works sited here. It is probable that, although today the land is low-lying and marshy, it was once higher than it is today.

The [[Upchurch Hoard]] is a hoard of well worn coins which date from the first and second century A.D. which were found close to Upchurch in 1950.<ref name=mccabe>[http://andrewmccabe.ancients.info/Hoards.html#Upchurch  Upchurch Hoard], Andrew McCabe, ancients.info, accessed June 2010</ref> A more recent pottery was established here in 1909 called the [[Upchurch Pottery]]. Although it is now closed it became well known and could be found  retailing through such outlets as [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty & Co.]].

The [[Anglican]] [[parish church]] of St Mary's originally was linked to the [[:fr:Abbaye de l'Isle-Dieu|Abbey of Lisle Dieu]], in [[Normandy]] and was founded by Reginald de Paveley in 1187.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-kent/vol6/pp24-34#h3-0003|title = Parishes: Upchurch &#124; British History Online}}</ref> It is a [[Grade I listed building]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-176207-church-of-st-mary-the-virgin-upchurch-ke|title = Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Upchurch, Kent}}</ref> Under the church is a small [[crypt]], a [[charnel house]] where bones were kept when the churchyard was full. It was discovered in 1877 and the bones re-interred. The church is also notable for its very unusual 'candle-snuffer' steeple where an octagonal pyramid appears to have been stacked on top of a square one, resembling a couple of inverted ice-cream cones. It is believed that the distinctive shape was chosen to serve as a navigational aid for shipping on the [[River Thames]]. The wall surrounding the church also falls within the Grade I status listing. The village has a connection with [[Sir Francis Drake]] whose father became its vicar in 1560, after having been prayer-reader to the Medway fleet.<ref>[http://www.historic-kent.co.uk/ Notes on Upchurch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010201153400/http://www.historic-kent.co.uk/ |date=1 February 2001 }}</ref>

In 2008 residents with the aid of a National Lottery grant collected and published a book Upchurch in old picture postcards. The project was to collect and maintain photographs that reflected changing village life. The project published most of the collected images.<ref>[http://www.upchurch-village.co.uk]</ref>  The book, published by Meresborough Books/ was produced by resident Mike Gunnill. The project to retain old photographs of the area continues under the heading, the Upchurch Collection.

The settlement of '''Otterham Quay''' lies a mile west of the village at the head of Otterham Creek. This small port gave young Francis Drake his first experience of the sea.<ref>''Kent'', Vol.1 County History by Bushell, 1976</ref> When the last brick field was given planning permission for development, a publication ''Otterham, Kent: Your Heritage'' was produced.  The book wanted to record and save the heritage of the area ahead of new housing.
