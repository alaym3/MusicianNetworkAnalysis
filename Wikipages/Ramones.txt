The '''Ramones'''{{efn|The band is often referred to as '''the Ramones''', though most of the band's releases refer to them as simply "Ramones". Some compilation albums use "The Ramones".}} were an American [[punk rock]] band that formed in the [[New York City]] neighborhood of [[Forest Hills, Queens]], in 1974.

All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname "Ramone", although none of them were biologically related; they were inspired by [[Paul McCartney]] of [[the Beatles]], who would check into hotels as "Paul Ramon". The Ramones performed 2,263&nbsp;concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22&nbsp;years.<ref name="HallofFame"/> In 1996, after a tour with the [[Lollapalooza]] music festival, they played [[We're Outta Here!|a farewell concert]] in Los Angeles and disbanded.<ref name=Schinder559/> By 2014, all four of the band's original members had died &ndash; lead singer [[Joey Ramone]] (1951–2001), bassist [[Dee Dee Ramone]] (1951–2002), guitarist [[Johnny Ramone]] (1948–2004) and drummer [[Tommy Ramone]] (1949–2014).<ref name="AP"/><ref name="nytimes"/><ref name="Sisario"/><ref name=guardian>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/12/tommy-ramone-dies-aged-65 |title=Tommy Ramone dies aged 62 |work=[[The Guardian]] |agency=Australian Associated Press |date=July 12, 2014 |access-date=July 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712075737/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/12/tommy-ramone-dies-aged-65 |archive-date=July 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The remaining surviving members of the Ramones—bassist [[C.

===Formation (1974–1975)===
[[File:ForestHillsHS.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Forest Hills High School (New York)|Forest Hills High School]], attended by the four original members of the Ramones]]
The original members of the band met in and around the middle-class neighborhood of [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] in the New York City borough of [[Queens]]. [[Johnny Ramone|John Cummings]] and [[Tommy Ramone|Thomas Erdelyi]] had both been in a high-school [[Garage rock|garage band]] from 1965 to 1967 known as the Tangerine Puppets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Laitio-Ramone, Jari-Pekka|url=http://kauhajokinyt.fi/~jplaitio/story/tange.html|title=Tangerine Puppets (Interview with Richard Adler)|year=1997|publisher=Jari-Pekka Laitio-Ramonen Henkilökohtainen Kotisivutuotos|access-date=November 5, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104182247/http://kauhajokinyt.fi/~jplaitio/story/tange.html|archive-date=January 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They became friends with [[Dee Dee Ramone|Douglas Colvin]], who had recently moved to the area from Germany,<ref name=eotc>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/endofthecentury/ramones.html|title=End of the Century: The Ramones|work=Independent Lens|publisher=PBS|access-date=November 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110225615/http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/endofthecentury/ramones.html|archive-date=November 10, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Joey Ramone|Jeffrey Hyman]], who was the singer for the [[glam rock]] band [[Sniper (American band)|Sniper]], founded in 1972.<ref name="Time">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,107146-2,00.html|title=Pal Joey|last=Enright|first=Michael|date=April 20, 2001|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=October 20, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205234544/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,107146-2,00.html|archive-date=December 5, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>McNeil and McCain (1996), pp.&nbsp;181, 496.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://garagehangover.com/ageofreason/|title=The Age of Reason |website=Garagehangover.com|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>

The Ramones began taking shape in early 1974 when Cummings and Colvin invited Hyman to join them in a band. Colvin wanted to play guitar and sing, Cummings would also play guitar and Hyman would play drums. The lineup was to be completed with their friend Richie Stern on bass. However, after only a few rehearsals it became clear that Richie Stern could not play bass, so in addition to singing, Colvin switched from guitar to bass and Cummings became the only guitarist.<ref name="Commando">{{cite book|last1=Ramone|first1=Johnny|author-link1=Johnny Ramone|title=Commando: The Autobiography of Johnny Ramone|date=April 2012|publisher=[[Abrams Image]]|location=New York City, New York|isbn=9780810996601|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBZlyEn5H1gC&q=richie+stern&pg=PT47|access-date=7 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208073533/https://books.google.ca/books?id=dBZlyEn5H1gC&pg=PT47&dq=richie+stern&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGmcu_3pbXAhVm34MKHWFaDi4Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=richie%20stern&f=false|archive-date=December 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Colvin was the first to adopt the name "Ramone", calling himself Dee Dee Ramone.

A friend of the band, Monte A. Melnick (later their tour manager), helped to arrange rehearsal time for them at Manhattan's Performance Studios, where he worked. Johnny's former bandmate Erdelyi was set to become their manager. Soon after the band was formed, Dee Dee realized that he could not sing and play his bass guitar simultaneously; with Erdelyi's encouragement, Joey became the band's new lead singer.<ref name="MM32"/> Dee Dee would continue, however, to count off each song's tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of "1-2-3-4!" Joey soon similarly realized that he could not sing and play drums simultaneously and left the position of drummer. While auditioning prospective replacements, Erdelyi would often take to the drums and demonstrate how to play the songs. It became apparent that he was able to perform the group's music better than anyone else, and he joined the band as Tommy Ramone.<ref name=MM33>Melnick and Meyer (2003), p.&nbsp;33.</ref>

The Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios.<ref name="HallofFame"/> The songs they played were very fast and very short; most clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was emerging in New York centered on two clubs in [[downtown Manhattan]]—[[Max's Kansas City]] and, more famously, [[CBGB]] (usually referred to as CBGB's). The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16, 1974.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/JohnnyRamone/photos/a.10150703813846521.491576.43468756520/10153036882146521/?type=1&theater Johnny Ramone - Timeline Photos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202080559/https://www.facebook.com/JohnnyRamone/photos/a.10150703813846521.491576.43468756520/10153036882146521/?type=1&theater |date=February 2, 2016 }}.

The band swiftly became regulars at the club, playing there seventy-four times by the end of the year. After garnering considerable attention for their performances—which averaged about seventeen minutes from beginning to end—the group was signed to a recording contract in late 1975 by [[Seymour Stein]] of [[Sire Records]]. Sire [[A&R]] man [[Craig Leon]]<ref name=MM101>Melnick and Meyer (2003), p.&nbsp;101.</ref> saw the band and brought them to the attention of the label. Stein's wife, [[Linda S.

Tommy, tired of touring, left the band in early 1978. He continued as the Ramones' record producer under his birth name of Erdelyi.

Later that year, the band released their fourth studio album, and first with Marky, ''[[Road to Ruin (Ramones album)|Road to Ruin]]''. The album, co-produced by Tommy with [[Ed Stasium]], included some new sounds such as acoustic guitar, several ballads, and the band's first two recorded songs longer than three minutes. It failed to reach the [[Billboard Top 100|''Billboard'' Top 100]]. However, "[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]", which appeared both on the album and as a single, would become one of the band's best-known songs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Boldman, Gina | url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t4297980|pure_url=yes}} | website=Allmusic | access-date=November 5, 2009| title=I Wanna Be Sedated}}</ref> The artwork on the album's cover was done by ''Punk'' magazine cofounder [[John Holmstrom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=5901|title=John Holmstrom: Floating in a Bottle of Formaldehyde|last=Morgan|first=Jeffrey|date=February 4, 2004|work=[[Metro Times]]|publisher=[[Times-Shamrock Communications]]|access-date=November 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605180207/http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=5901|archive-date=June 5, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the band's movie debut in [[Roger Corman]]'s ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'' (1979), renowned producer [[Phil Spector]] became interested in the Ramones and produced their 1980 album ''[[End of the Century]]''. There is a long-disputed rumor that during the recording sessions in Los Angeles, Spector held Johnny at gunpoint, forcing him to repeatedly play a riff.<ref>{{cite news| author = Harlow, John| title = Spector Calls Ex-Wife for Murder Defence| work = Sunday Times| date = March 18, 2007| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article1530531.ece| access-date = November 5, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100604024438/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article1530531.ece| archive-date = June 4, 2010| url-status = live}}</ref> Though it was to be the highest-charting album in the band's history—reaching number 44 in the United States and number 14 in Great Britain—Johnny made clear that he favored the band's more aggressive punk material: "''End of the Century'' was just watered-down Ramones. It's not the real Ramones."<ref>Leigh and McNeil (2009), p. 201.</ref> This stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny later oversaw, ''[[Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits]]''. Despite these reservations, Johnny did concede that some of Spector's work with the band had merit, saying "It really worked when he got to a slower song like '[[Danny Says]]'—the production really worked tremendously.

''[[Pleasant Dreams]]'', the band's sixth album, was released in 1981. It continued the trend established by ''End of the Century'', taking the band further from the raw punk sound of its early records.

===Aftermath and deaths===
On July 20, 1999, Dee Dee, Johnny, Joey, Tommy, Marky, and C. J. appeared together at the [[Virgin Megastore]] in [[New York City]] for an autograph signing.

On March 18, 2002, the Ramones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], which specifically named Dee Dee, Johnny, Joey, Tommy, and Marky. At the ceremony, the surviving inductees spoke on behalf of the band. Johnny spoke first, thanking the band's fans and blessing [[George W. Bush]] and his presidency. Tommy spoke next, saying how honored the band felt, but how much it would have meant for Joey. Dee Dee humorously congratulated and thanked himself, while Marky thanked Tommy for influencing his drum style. [[Green Day]] played "Teenage Lobotomy", "Rockaway Beach", and "[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]" as a tribute, demonstrating the Ramones' continuing influence on later rock musicians. The ceremony was one of Dee Dee's last public appearances, as he was found dead on June 5, 2002, from a [[heroin overdose]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|author=Pareles, Jon|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E4D9143DF934A35755C0A9649C8B63|title=Dee Dee Ramone, Pioneer Punk Rocker, Dies at 50|work=The New York Times|date=June 7, 2002|access-date=November 3, 2009}}</ref>

==Style==

===Musical style===
The Ramones' loud, fast, straightforward musical style was influenced by [[pop music]] that the band members grew up listening to in the 1950s and 1960s, including [[classic rock]] groups such as [[Buddy Holly and the Crickets]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[the Who]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Kinks]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Doors]] and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]; [[Bubblegum music|bubblegum]] acts like the [[1910 Fruitgum Company]] and [[Ohio Express]]; and girl groups such as [[the Ronettes]] and [[the Shangri-Las]]. They also drew on the harder rock sound of the [[MC5]], [[Black Sabbath]],<ref>{{cite book |last= Millard|first= André |date= 2004|title= The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon |publisher= JHU Press|page= 206|isbn= 0-8018-7862-4}}</ref> [[the Stooges]] and the [[New York Dolls]], now known as seminal [[protopunk]] bands.<ref>Bessman (1993), pp.&nbsp;17–18; {{cite web| author =Morris, Chris| title =Joey Ramone, Punk's First Icon, Dies| work =Billboard| date =April 29, 2001| url =http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4638922-1.html| access-date =November 5, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090104141935/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4638922-1.html| archive-date =January 4, 2009| url-status =live}} {{cite news| title = The Musical Misfits| publisher = BBC| date = April 16, 2001| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1279856.stm| access-date = November 5, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090115112303/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1279856.stm| archive-date = January 15, 2009| url-status = live}}</ref> The Ramones' style was in part a reaction against the heavily produced, often bombastic music that dominated the pop charts in the 1970s. "We decided to start our own group because we were bored with everything we heard," [[Joey Ramone|Joey]] once explained. "In [[1974 in music|1974]] everything was tenth-generation [[Elton John]], or overproduced, or just junk. Everything was long jams, long [[guitar solos]]&nbsp;...&nbsp;. We missed music like it used to be."<ref>Edelstein and McDonough (1990), p.&nbsp;178.</ref> [[Ira Robbins]] and Scott Isler of ''[[Trouser Press]]'' describe the result:

J.]] when preparing for his first live performances with the group were to play facing the audience, to stand with the bass slung low between spread legs, and to walk forward to the front of stage at the same time as he did.

===Visual imagery===
The Ramones' art and visual imagery complemented the themes of their music and performance. The members adopted a uniform look of long hair, [[leather jackets]], T-shirts, torn jeans, and [[sneakers]]. This fashion emphasized [[minimalism]]—a powerful influence on the [[punk rock|New York punk scene of the 1970s]]—and reflected the band's short, simple songs.<ref name=CS67>Colegrave and Sullivan (2001), p.&nbsp;67.</ref> [[Tommy Ramone]] recalled that, musically and visually, "We were influenced by comic books, movies, the [[Andy Warhol]] scene, and [[avant-garde films]]. I was a big ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine fan myself."<ref name=CS67/>

[[File:Ramones logo.jpg|thumb|right|The band's logo, based on the [[Seal of the President of the United States]]]]

The band's logo was created by [[New York City]] artist [[Arturo Vega]], with the Ramones. Vega, a longtime friend, had allowed [[Joey Ramone|Joey]] and [[Dee Dee Ramone|Dee Dee]] to move into his loft.<ref name="McCain & McNeil, 211">McNeil and McCain (1996), p.&nbsp;211.</ref> He produced the band's T-shirts—their main source of income—basing most of the images on a black-and-white self-portrait photograph he had taken of his American bald eagle belt buckle, which appeared on the back sleeve of the Ramones' first album.<ref name=B40>Bessman (1993), p.&nbsp;40.</ref> He was inspired to create the band's logo after a trip to [[Washington, D.C.]]:
<blockquote>I saw them as the ultimate all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression&nbsp;...&nbsp;. I thought, 'The Great [[Seal of the President of the United States]]' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the [[eagle]] holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression that would be used against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as [[apple pie]]. And since Johnny was such a [[baseball]] fanatic, we had the eagle hold a [[baseball bat]] instead of the [Great Seal]'s arrows.<ref name=B40/></blockquote>
The scroll in the eagle's beak originally read "Look out below", but this was soon changed to "Hey ho let's go" after the opening lyrics of the band's first single, "[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]". The arrowheads on the shield came from a design on a polyester shirt Vega had bought. "Ramones" was spelled out in block capitals above the logo using plastic stick-on letters.<ref name="Bessman, 211"/> Where the presidential emblem read "Seal of the President of the United States" clockwise in the border around the eagle, Vega placed the pseudonyms of the band members: [[Johnny Ramone|Johnny]], Joey, Dee Dee, and Tommy. Over the years the names in the border would change as the band's line-up fluctuated.<ref>{{cite web| author =Vega, Arturo| title =My Ramones World| publisher =RamonesWorld.com| url =http://www.ramonesworld.com/unofficial/unofficial.html| access-date =November 5, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20101128203602/http://ramonesworld.com/unofficial/unofficial.html| archive-date =November 28, 2010| url-status =dead| df =mdy-all}}</ref>

"It's the American presidential seal—anyone can use it," said [[Marky Ramone]] of the logo's ubiquity. "We share the [[royalty payment|royalties]] on the t-shirt and on the merchandise. A lot of the kids wearing that shirt might not even have heard of the Ramones' music. I guess if you have the shirt, your curiosity might bring you to buy the music. Whatever, it is a strange phenomenon."<ref>Fortnam, Ian: "Heavy load"; ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' #216, November 2015, p138</ref>

==Legacy and influence==
The Ramones had a broad and lasting influence on the development of [[popular music]]. Music historian [[Jon Savage]] writes of their [[Ramones (album)|debut album]] that "it remains one of the few records that changed pop forever."<ref>Savage (1992), p.&nbsp;553.</ref> As described by [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], "The band's first four albums set the blueprint for punk, especially American punk and hardcore, for the next two decades."<ref>{{cite web|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5223|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Ramones: Biography|website=Allmusic|access-date=November 5, 2009}}</ref> ''Trouser Press''{{'s}} Robbins and Isler similarly wrote that the Ramones "not only spearheaded the original new wave/punk movement, but also drew the blueprint for subsequent hardcore punk bands".<ref name="TP"/> Punk journalist Phil Strongman writes, "In purely ''musical'' terms, the Ramones, in attempting to re-create the excitement of pre-Dolby rock, were to cast a huge shadow—they had fused a blueprint for much of the indie future."<ref name=St62/> Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in 2001, [[Douglas Wolk]] described the Ramones as "easily the most influential group of the last 30 years."<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Wolk, Douglas|url=http://www.slate.com/id/104580/|title=I Wanna Be Joey|magazine=Slate|date=April 18, 2001|access-date=November 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131093321/http://www.slate.com/id/104580/|archive-date=January 31, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

The next night, members of both bands attended the Ramones' gig at the Dingwall's club. Ramones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and Clash bassist [[Paul Simonon]] (which he mislocates at the Roundhouse): "Johnny asked him, 'What do you do? Are you in a band?' Paul said, 'Well, we just rehearse. We call ourselves the Clash but we're not good enough.' Johnny said, 'Wait till you see us—we stink, we're lousy, we can't play.
