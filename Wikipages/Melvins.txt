'''Melvins''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1983,<ref name="gibson">{{cite web |url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/the-melvins-king-buzzo-lays-do |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626094453/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/the-melvins-king-buzzo-lays-do/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 26, 2008 |title=The Melvins' King Buzzo Lays Down the Rules on Guitar Playing, "Hot Topic" Punk, and What You Ought to Know About Music |publisher=Gibson.com |access-date=July 17, 2011 }}</ref> in [[Montesano, Washington]]. Their early work was key to the development of both [[grunge]] and [[sludge metal]].<ref>{{cite magazine|date=August 2009|title=Sludge Special|magazine=[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]|issue=187|page=44|issn=1350-6978}}</ref> They originally performed as only a trio but later also sometimes appeared as a quartet with either two drummers or two bassists. Since 1984, vocalist and guitarist [[Buzz Osborne]] and drummer [[Dale Crover]] have been constant members. The band was named after a supervisor at a [[Associated Wholesale Grocers|Thriftway]] in Montesano, where Osborne also worked as a [[clerk]]; "Melvin" was disliked by other employees, and the band's members felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yH7u3V-Uk0| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/1yH7u3V-Uk0| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Melvins Buzz Osborne - Wikipedia Fact Or Fiction |publisher=youtube.com |access-date=June 14, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

==History==

===Early years (1983–1987)===
Melvins were formed in early 1983 by Buzz Osborne (guitar, vocals), [[Matt Lukin]] (bass) and [[Mike Dillard]] (drums) who all went to Montesano Jr./Sr. High School in Montesano, Washington.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/4800-the-melvins|title=The Melvins - Artist Profile|website=eventseeker.com|language=en|access-date=December 13, 2019}}</ref> In the beginning they played [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Who (band)|Who]] covers,<ref>Azerrad, Michael. ''Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana''. Doubleday, 1994. page 25 {{ISBN|0-385-47199-8}}</ref> and also began playing fast [[hardcore punk]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/4087 |title=Melvins – Mangled Demos From 1983 |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=July 17, 2011}}</ref> When Dillard left the band, Dale Crover took his place, and the band's rehearsals moved to a back room of Crover's parents' house in [[Aberdeen, Washington]]. Soon afterward, they started to play songs slower and "heavier" than nearly anyone else at the time.

In 1985, [[C/Z Records]] was created to document the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] music scene. The label released ''[[Deep Six (album)|Deep Six]]'', featuring four songs by the Melvins. In 1986 the band released their debut, the ''[[Melvins! (album)|Six Songs]]'' EP, on [[C/Z Records]] (later releases expanded and retitled this as ''8 Songs'', ''10 Songs'', and eventually ''26 Songs'' in 2003 on [[Ipecac Recordings]]). The album was recorded live to a two track at the now closed Ironwood Studio in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] on February 8, 1986.<ref>album back cover, [[C/Z Records]] CZ002</ref>

In October 1986, they recorded their first full-length album, ''[[Gluey Porch Treatments]]'', at Studio D in [[Sausalito, California]]. The album was released in 1987 on [[Alchemy Records (US)|Alchemy Records]]. ''Gluey Porch Treatments'' was later coupled with their second album ''Ozma'' for the [[Boner Records]] CD release. It was expanded again for the 1999 re-release on [[Ipecac Recordings]] with some garage demos.

===Boner Records era (1988–1992)===
Crover played drums with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] (billed as "Ted Ed Fred") when they recorded a ten-song demo on January 23, 1988 in Seattle, which later formed part of their debut LP ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', and played a live show in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] later that day. Osborne would later introduce [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Krist Novoselic]] to [[Dave Grohl]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Later that year Osborne and Crover relocated to [[San Francisco, California]]. Lukin stayed and formed the band [[Mudhoney (band)|Mudhoney]]. [[Lori Black (bassist)|Lori "Lorax" Black]] (daughter of [[Shirley Temple]]) replaced Lukin on bass. The band recorded ''[[Ozma (album)|Ozma]]'' in May 1989, and released it later that year. The album was produced by [[Mark Deutrom]], who later joined the band on bass.

In 1990, the band recorded ''[[Bullhead (album)|Bullhead]]'', which marked a slower, more [[drone music]] style for the band. The band then toured Europe; their show of January 23, 1991 in [[Alzey]], Germany was released by [[Your Choice Records]] as ''[[Your Choice Live Series Vol.12]]''. When they returned to the U.S., they recorded the ''[[Eggnog (album)|Eggnog]]'' EP, which was released the same year on [[Boner Records]].

Lorax left the band, and was replaced by [[Joe Preston (bassist)|Joe Preston]]. Preston appears on the ''[[Salad of a Thousand Delights]]'' (1992, Box Dog Video). The Melvins then released three "solo" EPs,<ref name="Melvins blazing new trails">{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Lewis|date=May 17, 2002|title=Melvins blazing new trails|journal=The Register-Guard|pages=5–6|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NXUVAAAAIBAJ&dq=mike-dillard%20melvins&pg=4260%2C4656921|access-date=November 27, 2009}}</ref> following the concept and imitating the cover artwork inspired by the four [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] members' solo albums released in 1978.  ''[[King Buzzo (album)|King Buzzo]]'', ''[[Dale Crover (album)|Dale Crover]]'', and ''[[Joe Preston (album)|Joe Preston]]'' were all released in 1992 on [[Boner Records]]. Later in 1992, they released the full-length album, ''[[Lysol (album)|Lysol]]'', which had to be renamed ''Melvins'' because [[Lysol]] was a trademarked name. Preston departed from the band, and Lorax briefly rejoined.

===Atlantic Records era (1993–1997)===
When Nirvana's ''[[Nevermind]]'' became a massive and unexpected success, Melvins were one of many groups to benefit from Nirvana's support. Melvins were signed by [[Atlantic Records]], and its first major label release, 1993's ''[[Houdini (album)|Houdini]]'', entered the ''Billboard'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart at 29. Mark Deutrom replaced Lorax on bass shortly after the album's release, as she was facing trial for drug possession and was struggling with heroin addiction.{{cn|date=April 2020}} [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] played bass with the Melvins in 1993 in a concert with [[Primus (band)|Primus]], on the song "[[Goin' Blind]]", a Kiss song that the Melvins had covered on ''Houdini''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themelvins.net/wiki/index.php?title=Melvins_Bassist_Morgue |title=The Melvins "Bassist Morgue" |publisher=Themelvins.net |date=October 17, 2007 |access-date=July 17, 2011}}</ref>

Melvins released its second album for Atlantic in 1994, ''[[Stoner Witch]]''. Due to its experimental nature,  Melvins took its next album, ''[[Prick (Melvins album)|Prick]]'', to [[Amphetamine Reptile Records]]. Record label conflicts prevented the band from releasing any records under the name "Melvins", so the album was released with the band name [[Mirror writing|written in mirror]]. The band returned to Atlantic one last time for 1996's ''[[Stag (Melvins album)|Stag]]'', which entered the Heatseekers chart at number 33. Melvins were dropped by [[Atlantic Records]] in 1997 after three albums.

===Switching labels and continued experimentation (1997–2004)===
The band signed with Amphetamine Reptile Records and released their next full-length album, ''[[Honky (album)|Honky]]'', in 1997. They recorded an August 1997 concert in Richmond, [[Melbourne, Australia]] as ''[[Alive at the Fucker Club|Alive at the F*ckerclub]]'' in 1998. The same year, Melvins opened for [[Tool (band)|Tool]].  (A picture on the Tool website depicts the Melvins along with the words "Melvins say...Tool Sux!" spelled out in [[lunch meat]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toolband.com/melvinsuck.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021006171546/http://www.toolband.com/melvinsuck.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 6, 2002 |title=Melvins photo on the Tool website |publisher=Toolband.com |access-date=July 17, 2011 }}</ref> The photo was taken while on tour with Tool in 2002 in Australia.) In 1998, Melvins played the second stage at [[Ozzfest]].

1999 saw the beginning of a partnership with [[Mike Patton]]'s [[Ipecac Recordings]], which began remastering and reissuing much of the band's back catalog. The band also released three full-length albums dubbed (and later packaged together as) ''The Trilogy'': ''[[The Maggot (album)|The Maggot]]'', ''[[The Bootlicker (album)|The Bootlicker]]'', and  ''[[The Crybaby (album)|The Crybaby]]''. The latter featured a number of guest vocalists and musicians. [[Kevin Rutmanis]], formerly of [[The Cows]], was bassist during this era.

In 2001, the band returned to their experimental tendencies for ''[[Colossus of Destiny (album)|Colossus of Destiny]]'', a live set of synthesizer and sampler experiments presented as two tracks (one clocking in at 59:23 and the other at five seconds). The album was described approvingly by one critic as "more like [[avant-garde]] [[Electro-acoustic music|electro-acoustic]] than anything else."<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|last=Schulte |first=Tom |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r525643 |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Colossus of Destiny - Melvins |website=AllMusic |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

In 2002 [[Ipecac Recordings]] released [[Hostile Ambient Takeover]], a record that was not in fact ambient music at all. Metal Archives said: "Overall, this album is charged with brilliance and it deserves a place in every collection. ".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Melvins/Hostile_Ambient_Takeover/11727/ |website=metal-archives.com |title=Hostile Ambient Takeover, a must have!}}</ref> This album is also notable as it is the first instance of Melvins working with long time producer and engineer [[Toshi Kasai]].

In 2003 [[Atlantic Records]] (UK) released ''[[Melvinmania (album)|Melvinmania: The Best of the Atlantic Years 1993–1996]]'', a compilation of recycled tracks from the band's three major label releases. This release was unsanctioned by the band who had no input into the track selection or (occasionally inaccurate) liner notes.

In 2004, Osborne and Crover toured to celebrate their 20th anniversary as a band, and also released an art book ''[[Neither Here Nor There (book)|Neither Here Nor There]]''. The book is a collection of art by creators of their cover art as well as friends of the band, and also contained retrospectives on the past twenty years of the Melvins. The book included a CD with selected tracks from their albums.

===Later period and collaboration albums (2004–2010)===
[[File:King buzzo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Frontman Buzz Osborne performing in 2006]]
In 2004, Melvins collaborated with ambient artist [[Lustmord]] for ''[[Pigs of the Roman Empire (album)|Pigs of the Roman Empire]]'' and with [[Dead Kennedys]] singer [[Jello Biafra]] for ''[[Never Breathe What You Can't See]]'' and  ''[[Sieg Howdy!]]'' released in 2004 and 2005 respectively. ''[[Never Breathe What You Can't See]]'' was supported by a mini-tour with [[Jello Biafra]] and [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] from [[Tool (band)|Tool]]. A planned European tour was canceled in early October 2004 reportedly due to unknown complications involving Rutmanis. Following the tour cancellation, Melvins finished the year playing a few shows with [[David Scott Stone]]<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://www.radioneutron.com/2020/06/02/ep176-david-scott-stone-lcd-soundsystem-melvins-unwound-slug-get-hustle-etc/ |title=Protonic Reversal Ep176: David Scott Stone (LCD Soundsystem, Melvins, Unwound, Slug, Get Hustle, etc.) |publisher=radioneutron.com |access-date=June 2, 2020}}</ref>  supporting the work of filmmaker Cameron Jamie in Europe and the United States. 

When asked about Rutmanis and the canceled portion of the tour. Osborne and Crover stated that Rutmanis had "disappeared". Fans feared that Rutmanis had departed like so many bassists before him; however, Rutmanis returned temporarily in early 2005. In June 2005, Rutmanis officially left the band. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radioneutron.com/2020/01/31/ep144-kevin-rutmanis-hepa-titus-the-cows-melvins-tomahawk/ |title=Protonic Reversal Ep144: Kevin Rutmanis (hepa.titus, The Cows, Melvins, Tomahawk) |publisher=radioneutron.com |access-date=June 2, 2020}}</ref>  When Melvins toured with Jello Biafra in October and November 2005, [[David Scott Stone]] filled in on bass for both sets. He{{clarify|date=June 2020|reason=Rutmanis or Scott Stone? I assume Rutmanis, but source is a 2-hour audio interview w/o transcript...}} did not leave the live lineup on good terms, waiting until 9 days before a tour to back out and saying in an interview: "It was unprofessional and a betrayal of a friendship," <ref name="auto"/> 

In early 2006, Crover confirmed rumors of both members of the bass-drums duo [[Big Business (band)|Big Business]] joining the Melvins. Commenting on adding another drummer, Crover said this about Big Business drummer [[Coady Willis]]: "He's left-handed, so we want to do this 'mirror image' type of thing. We've kind of fused our two drum sets together, and we're going to try and do some crazy thing with it. We're sharing these big toms in between us."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radioneutron.com/2020/04/14/ep155-dale-crover-melvins/ |title=Protonic Reversal Ep155: Dale Crover (Melvins) |publisher=radioneutron.com |access-date=June 2, 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.radioneutron.com/2019/04/21/ep132-coady-willis-big-business-murder-city-devils-melvins/ |title=Protonic Reversal Ep132: Coady Willis (Big Business, Murder City Devils, Melvins) |publisher=radioneutron.com |access-date=June 2, 2020}}</ref> 

The band toured the U.S. in the fall of 2006 in support of their album, ''[[(A) Senile Animal]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=55257 |title=Blabbermouth article on the release of ''(A) Senile Animal'' |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223014927/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=55257 |archive-date=December 23, 2008  }}</ref>  The Melvins also toured briefly the United Kingdom in mid-December 2006. Two new songs entitled "Suicide in Progress" and "Billy Fish" were played during the 2007 tour, and appear on their next album ''[[Nude With Boots]]''.

On June 16 and 17, 2008, a lineup of Osborne, original drummer Mike Dillard, and Dale Crover (playing bass) played two shows at the [[Great American Music Hall]] in San Francisco in honor of [[Jello Biafra]]'s 50th birthday. Both sets were composed of songs from The Mangled Demos, a collection of early material released on the [[Alternative Tentacles]] record label in 2005.<ref name="ATBiafra">{{cite web | url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/page.php?page=biafra50 | title=Biafra Five–O | publisher=Alternative Tentacles | access-date=August 23, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403121541/http://www.alternativetentacles.com/page.php?page=biafra50 | archive-date=April 3, 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="AllMusicMangled">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mangled-demos-from-1983-mw0000208795/releases | title=Mangled Demos from 1983 | website=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=August 23, 2012}}</ref>

In July 2008, their new album entitled ''[[Nude with Boots]]'' was released.  In December 2008, along with [[Mike Patton]], the Melvins co-curated an edition of the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] Nightmare Before Christmas festival. They chose half of the lineup and also performed themselves.

The long rumored (since 2003) remix CD ''[[Chicken Switch]]'' was released on September 29, 2009 via [[Ipecac Recordings]]. Unlike usual remix CDs where the remixer is given a single track to work with, for ''Chicken Switch'' each remixer was given a full album to work with and pull from to create their track. Melvins joined with New Orleans' super group [[Down (band)|Down]] and [[Weedeater (band)|Weedeater]] for a North American tour in the summer and fall of 2009. Melvins released their follow up to ''Nude with Boots'', entitled ''[[The Bride Screamed Murder]]'', on June 1, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=136333 |title=MELVINS To Release 'The Bride Screamed Murder' In June |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606070510/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=136333 |archive-date=June 6, 2011  }}</ref>

===Melvins Lite, reunion with Mike Dillard and more albums (2011–present)===

Melvins started 2011 with a series of unique shows. Four of the shows were every Friday at [[Spaceland]]'s in California. January 7 featured the current line-up playing ''[[Colossus of Destiny]]'', ''[[Lysol (album)|Lysol]]'', and ''[[Eggnog (album)|Eggnog]]''. Jan 14 featured a Melvins 1983 set followed by the band playing ''[[Houdini (album)|Houdini]]''.
