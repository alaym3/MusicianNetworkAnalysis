'''Oberhofer''' is a band from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] formed in 2008 to perform the music of its founder and frontman Brad Oberhofer. Current members are Brad Oberhofer on synths, guitar and vocals, Zoe Brecher on drums, Dylan Treleven on bass, and Ben Roth on guitar.

In July 2011, Brad Oberhofer signed with [[Glassnote Records]], which released Oberhofer's debut album ''Time Capsules II'' on March 27, 2012, an EP entitled, "NOTALGIA" (2013), and their second album, "Chronovision" (2016) in the [[United States]] and worldwide.

Oberhofer's sound is largely described as Surf Pop Revival, joining the ranks of such bands as [[Best Coast]], [[Allah-Las]], [[Bleached]], [[Surfer Blood]], [[Cayucas]], [[Howler (band)|Howler]], and [[Dum Dum Girls]], but is also known for its cinematic and orchestral qualities.

==History==
'''Oberhofer''' started in 2008 as the recording project of Brad Oberhofer. After moving from his native [[Tacoma, Washington]] to [[New York City]], Oberhofer attended [[New York University]] to study music composition.<ref name="bare_url">{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/oberhofer/biography|title=News, Sports, Weather, Entertainment, Local & Lifestyle - AOL|last=AOL|access-date=26 July 2016}}</ref> After using several different names, the young singer adopted his own name as the title of the project. Although the band has since gone through various lineup formations, the name has remained the same because Oberhofer writes all the music himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mydallasmusic.com/spotlight.php?page=oberhofer-2.19|title=mydallasmusic.com|access-date=26 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032940/http://www.mydallasmusic.com/spotlight.php?page=oberhofer-2.19|archive-date=2 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2010, Oberhofer self-released his first single ''o0Oo0O0o'' and was soon asked to go on tour with bands like [[Sleigh Bells (band)|Sleigh Bells]], [[Neon Indian]], and [[Matt and Kim]].<ref name="bare_url" /> After hitting the road for a year, Oberhofer released ''Away Frm U'' ([[sic]]) and ''I Could Go'' in 2011. The two singles brought the attention of independent label White Iris Records who released the band's next single ''Gotta Go/Mahwun'' in the summer of 2011. Soon after, Oberhofer signed with [[Glassnote Records]] to release their debut album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicscoop.com/2011/08/29/oberhofer-signs-to-glassnote-records-releases-single-via-white-iris/|title=Oberhofer Signs to Glassnote Records, Releases Single Via White Iris|date=29 August 2011|access-date=26 July 2016}}</ref> [[Stereogum]] ranked the band as the No.&nbsp;39 most anticipated album of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/910902/the-50-most-anticipated-albums-of-2012/franchises/listomania/|title=The 50+ Most Anticipated Albums Of 2012|date=22 December 2011|access-date=26 July 2016}}</ref>
