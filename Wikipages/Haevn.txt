'''Haevn''' (stylized as '''HAEVN''') is a Dutch band from [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], founded in 2015 by singer-songwriter Marijn van der Meer and film soundtrack composer Jorrit Kleijnen, who began writing music together in their studio in [[Amsterdam]]. The band currently also includes guitarist Bram Doreleijers (Ape Not Mice, [[Celine Cairo]]), bass player Mart Jeninga ([[Celine Cairo]]), and drummer David Broeders.

==History==
===Beginnings===
HAEVN was formed when film soundtrack composer Jorrit Kleijnen and singer-songwriter Marijn van der Meer met while working on a film score. This collaboration resulted in the songs "Where the Heart Is" and "Finding Out More", which appeared in a [[BMW]] commercial. The songs reached the international charts through [[Shazam (application)|Shazam]], after which the duo decided to work out full songs with Tim Bran of [[Dreadzone]], who has also produced music for the British band [[London Grammar]] and the artist [[Birdy (singer)|Birdy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

The addition of guitarist Tom Veugen and drummer David Broeders rounded out the band, and on 17 September 2015, they held their first performance at the Dutch travelling music festival Popronde. In October 2015, the radio station [[NPO 3FM]] proclaimed the band a "Serious Talent". Following this, the band's concert at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)]] on 21 May 2016 sold out in 4 days.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://beehy.pe/haevn-bright-lights-netherlands/ |title=Things have gotten a little crazy for Marijn van der Meer and Jorrit Kleijnen since they started their band HAEVN last year |publisher=beehype |date=2016-10-12 |accessdate=2019-04-25}}</ref> They were nominated for an [[Edison Award]] in 2016 and a 3FM Award for Best Newcomer. Both "Finding Out More" and "Bright Lights" ended up in the top 20 of the Song of the Year chart and at the end of December 2016, "Finding Out More" entered the [[Top 2000]], placing at number 1,321. The song made the list again in 2017.

HAEVN have played at major Dutch festivals such as [[Eurosonic Noorderslag]], Paaspop (Schijndel), Dauwpop, Retropop, Indian Summer Festival, [[Concert At Sea]], Huntenpop, [[Appelpop]], and Royal Park Live at [[Soestdijk Palace]].

On 2 April 2017, the band sold out the [[Carré Theatre]] in Amsterdam with a new band member, bassist Mart Jeninga, together with the Red Limo String Quartet. At the end of 2017, the new track "Fortitude" was released and it could be heard in the television series [[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blog.stingray.com/concert-review-haevn |title=In heaven with HAEVN |publisher=blog.stingray.com |date=2018-09-03 |accessdate=2019-04-25}}</ref>

===''Eyes Closed''===
HAEVN was signed by [[Warner Music Group]] in 2018, and they launched that year with two shows at Eurosonic Noorderslag with new guitarist Bram Doreleijers. On 23 February 2018, during their sold-out performance in the Grote Zaal of the Paradiso, a Gold Record for "Finding Out More" was presented to them by Dutch radio DJ [[Giel Beelen]]. In May of that year, the single "Back in the Water" was released and followed by the ''Eyes Closed'' tour in April, which saw the band playing in the nation's six major music halls.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spotgroningen.nl/programma/haevn/ |title=HAEVN - City Lights Tour 2019 |publisher=spotgroningen.nl|date=2019-05-03 |accessdate=2019-05-26}}</ref>

Due to the band's overseas success, their debut album ''Eyes Closed'' was released internationally on 25 May 2018 and entered at number 1 on the iTunes chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mydailyjournalonline.com/haevn-out-with-their-album-eyes-closed/ |title=HAEVN out with their album Eyes Closed |publisher=mydailyjournalonline.com |date=2018-07-02 |accessdate=2019-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/het-nieuwe-album-van-haevn-moet-je-luisteren-met-gesloten-ogen-neem-er-de-tijd-voor~b815d4ab/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F |title=You should listen to the new Haevn album with your eyes closed - take your time |publisher=volkskrant.nl|author=Cabenda, Pablo|date=2018-05-21 |accessdate=2019-05-26}}</ref> This was followed by international shows in [[Paris]] and [[Göttingen]], and the group played two days in a sold-out Carré Theatre in October 2018.

===Symphonic Tales===
In 2019, the band announced the release of the live album ''Symphonic Tales'' on their website. The album consists of six songs recorded with a 50-piece orchestra. Four of the tracks are taken from the debut album ''Eyes Closed'' and two are original compositions. It was released in late April 2019.

===Unfold Tour===
HAEVN conducted a tour of the Netherlands in May and June 2020, during which they revealed new material from their upcoming album. A German/Swiss tour is set to follow starting in September 2020.
