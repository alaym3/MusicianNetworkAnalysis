The Neighbourhood was formed in August 2011 by singer Jesse Rutherford, guitarists Zachary Abels and Jeremiah Freedman, bass guitarist Michael Margott and drummer Bryan "Olivver" Sammis. The members of The Neighbourhood chose the [[American and British English spelling differences|British spelling]] of "neighbourhood" on the advice of their manager, in order to distinguish themselves from a band already using the American spelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/the-neighbourhood-announce-2018-tour-dates-127344|title=The Neighbourhood announce 2018 tour dates|work=[[AXS (company)|AXS]]|author=Kareem Gantt|date=January 18, 2018}}</ref>
