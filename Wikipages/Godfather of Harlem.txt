Cheryl Kahla of ''[[The South African]]'' said: "''The Godfather of Harlem'' is an excellent example of what modern television is capable of today. Whitaker’s character Bumpy is a drug kingpin but also just a man trying to make sense of the world and connect with his family".<ref>{{cite news|title=Godfather of Harlem: In conversation with Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker|first=Cheryl|last=Kahla|date=November 11, 2019|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/forest-whitaker-interview-godfather-harlem//|work=thesouthafrican.com|access-date=May 9, 2020|archive-date=November 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115151636/https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/forest-whitaker-interview-godfather-harlem//|url-status=live}}</ref>
