'''Ebba Tove Elsa Nilsson''' (born 29 October 1987), known professionally as '''Tove Lo''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈtûːvɛ ˈluː}}), is a Swedish singer and songwriter, who has been called "Sweden's darkest pop export" by ''[[Rolling Stone]].''<ref name="Rolling Stone" /> She is known for her raw, [[grunge music|grunge]]-influenced take on [[pop music]]. Her honest, complex and [[autobiography|autobiographical]] lyrical content has led to her being dubbed "the saddest girl in Sweden".<ref name="Out" />

Raised in the [[Djursholm]] district of [[Danderyd Municipality|Danderyd]], Lo is an alumna of the music school Rytmus Musikergymnasiet. She formed the rock band Tremblebee in 2006. After it disbanded, Lo pursued a career in songwriting and earned a publishing deal with [[Warner/Chappell Music]] in 2011. Working with producers [[Alexander Kronlund]], [[Max Martin]], and [[Xenomania]], she became a successful songwriter, while also recording and releasing her own compositions independently.

In 2013, Lo was signed to [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]], [[Island Records|Island]] and [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]. The following year, Lo rose to prominence with her debut album, ''[[Queen of the Clouds]]'', which opened at number 14 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in October 2014. It spawned the [[sleeper hit]] single "[[Habits (Stay High)]]", which peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as "[[Talking Body]]". Her second album, ''[[Lady Wood]]'', was released in October 2016 and debuted at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Its lead single, "[[Cool Girl]]", became an international hit. Her follow-up records, ''[[Blue Lips]]'' (2017) and ''[[Sunshine Kitty]]'' (2019), also performed well, the latter spawning the song "[[Glad He's Gone]]", which was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Music Video.

In addition to her solo work, Lo has co-written songs for other artists, including: [[Lorde]]'s "[[Homemade Dynamite (Lorde song)|Homemade Dynamite]]" (2017) and [[Ellie Goulding]]'s "[[Love Me like You Do]]" (2015), a song that garnered her [[Grammy Award]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations. She has collaborated with many artists, including [[Alesso]], [[Flume (musician)|Flume]], [[Nick Jonas]], [[Seven Lions]], [[Broods]], [[Urban Cone]], [[Ava Max]], [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Coldplay]].

Lo's debut EP, ''Truth Serum'', documents one of her failed relationships in the order it took place.<ref name="Out" /><ref name="BBC" />  ''Queen of the Clouds'', her debut studio album, is a [[concept album]] that describes the stages of her relationships in three sections: "The Sex", "The Love" and "The Pain".<ref name="Paste" /><ref name="Billboard" /><ref name="Daily News" /> Jason Lipshutz of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' described the album as "blisteringly honest" and "unapologetically uncensored".<ref name="Billboard" /> Her second studio album, ''Lady Wood'', talks about "different kinds of rushes in life" and is divided into two chapters, "Fairy Dust" and "Fire Fade".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/tove-lo-on-losing-control-exploring-rushes-on-lady-wood-w441207 |title=Tove Lo on Going to Extremes: 'I'm Never as Happy as When I Lose Control' |last1=Spanos |first1=Brittany |date=14 October 2016 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |access-date=5 February 2017 }}</ref> The singer's third studio record, ''Blue Lips'', is a sequel to ''Lady Wood'' and is split into two chapters: "Light Beams" and "Pitch Black".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/music/2017/11/17/tove-lo-blue-lips-interview/ |title=Tove Lo on her new album and pushing the limits of censorship: 'When are they going to stop me?' |last1=Feeney |first1=Nolan |date=17 November 2017 |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> Lo's lyrics often contain [[profanity]]<ref name="Paste" /> and [[drug]] [[metaphor]]s.<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite news|author=Murray, Nick|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/how-tove-lo-became-swedens-darkest-pop-export-20141015|title=How Tove Lo Became Sweden's Darkest Pop Export|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=15 October 2014|access-date=10 May 2015}}</ref> Discussing the process of writing for other artists, the singer told ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' that she avoids drawing from her own experiences so that the songs do not become personal. She also said: "My main goal is to say something how they would say it, even if I might say it in a different way that makes more sense to me".<ref name="Paste" /> In an interview with ''Coup De Main'', Lo explained the songwriting process for her own songs:

<blockquote>Sometimes it starts with a random lyric idea that sets the tone for the whole song. Chords and sounds build from the lyric and rhythm, kind of. Sometimes it's a track I fall in love with... but writing my own songs, I rarely write on tracks. Then it's pretty much always 'the story' first. Then I add some chords and melody on my piano, or do a minimal production to get the sound right.<ref name="Coup De Main" /></blockquote>

=== Influences ===
Lo grew up idolising [[Courtney Love]] and was inspired by grunge culture and the polarising lyrics of her music and her band, [[Hole (band)|Hole]].<ref name="Vogue" /><ref name="Elle" /> She also became fascinated with Love's romantic relationship with [[Kurt Cobain]], as well as the rawness and honesty of his music with his band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref name="BBC" /><ref name="Popjustice" /><ref name="Interview" /> While in high school, Lo developed a passion for pop music and songwriting, influenced mainly by the output of Swedish singers [[Robyn]] and [[Lykke Li]].<ref name="Paper" /> She says the simplicity and quirky lyrics of French singer [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]'s album ''[[IRM (album)|IRM]]'' (2009) is the main inspiration behind her career in music and said that it "opened a new world" for her sonically.<ref name="Interview" /> She models her singing on the vocal stylings of [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Jeff Buckley]], and [[Mikky Ekko]].<ref name="Coup De Main" /> Other artists she has cited as musical influences include [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]],<ref>{{cite news|first=Sal|last=Cinquemani|title=Tove Lo: Lady Wood|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/tove-lo-lady-wood|access-date=17 May 2017|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=27 October 2016}}</ref> [[the Weeknd]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Cathy Applefeld Olson|title=Tove Lo Says The Weeknd Is 'A Big Inspiration' for Her Second Album|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6812867/tove-lo-the-weeknd-second-album|work=Billboard|access-date=26 March 2017|date=16 December 2015}}</ref> and [[Silverchair]].<ref name="BBC2" />
