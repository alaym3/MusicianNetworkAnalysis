He is increasingly recognised for his classical works including concertos, oratorios, ballets, operas and many instrumental pieces.<ref name="musicrec">{{cite web |author=Rob Barnett |title=Howard Blake – A survey of his music on CD |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classRev/2009/Sept09/Blake_survey.htm |work=Musicweb-International |year=2009 |access-date=9 April 2013}}</ref>

==Early life==
Howard Blake was born in London and grew up in [[Brighton]]. His mother played piano and violin, and his father sang [[tenor]] in the church choir. At [[Brighton Hove & Sussex Sixth Form College|Brighton, Hove and Sussex Grammar School for Boys]],<ref name="musicweb">{{cite web |author=Bob Briggs |title=Seen and Heard interview with Howard Blake |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/SandH/2008/Jul-Dec08/blake_part1.htm |work=Musicweb-international |year=2008 |access-date=25 December 2012}}</ref> from the age of 11 he sang lead roles in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas and was recognised as a good pianist, but few were aware that he was also writing music.<ref name="Howard Blake Autobiography">{{Cite web|url=https://www.howardblake.com/music/Verse-Prose/662/Snowman-autobiography-Walking-In-The-Air-Can-Be-Dangerous.htm|title=Howard Blake AUTOBIOGRAPHY in Verse & Prose|website=Howardblake.com|access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref><ref name="Midweek 4Dec2007">{{cite episode |title=Midweek |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/midweek.shtml |series=Midweek |series-link=Midweek (BBC Radio 4) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Radio 4]] |airdate=5 December 2007}}</ref>

At the age of 18, he won the [[Hastings Musical Festival]] Scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Music]], where he studied piano with [[Harold Craxton]] and composition with [[Howard Ferguson]]; however, he found himself at odds with his contemporaries in regard to musical style. He virtually stopped composing, instead becoming interested in film, and on leaving the Academy briefly worked as a film projectionist at the [[National Film Theatre]].

==Music career==
Missing music, Blake played piano in pubs and clubs for a couple of years until being discovered and signed by [[EMI]] to make a solo album and work as a session musician on many recordings. This led to work as an arranger and a composer, employment that gradually became his full-time occupation.<ref name="Howard Blake Autobiography"/><ref name="Midweek 4Dec2007"/>

In the late 1960s, on the recommendation of [[Bernard Herrmann]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howardblake.com/music/Film-TV-Scores/267/MY-WILDEST-DREAM.htm|title=Howard Blake MY WILDEST DREAM in Film & TV Scores|website=Howardblake.com|access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref> Blake began working as a keyboard player and arranger with veteran screen composer [[Laurie Johnson]] on music for the hit [[ITV (network)|ITV]] television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. During the program's sixth and final season in 1968–1969, Johnson was commissioned to write the soundtrack music for the feature film ''[[Hot Millions]]''; to enable him to work on the film score, Johnson recruited Blake to take over composing duties for him, and Blake composed the incidental music for ten complete episodes of that series. In 1970, shortly after the series finished, he lived in a beach hut in [[Cornwall]] for about two months, "to get away from it all".<ref name="Midweek 4Dec2007"/>

Over an active career he has written numerous film scores, including ''[[The Duellists]]'' with Sir [[Ridley Scott]] and [[David Puttnam]], which gained the Special Jury Award at the [[Cannes Festival]] in 1977; ''[[A Month in the Country (film)|A Month in the Country]]'' with [[Kenneth Branagh]] and [[Colin Firth]], which gained him the British Film Institute Anthony Asquith Award for musical excellence in 1989; and ''[[The Snowman]]'', which was nominated for an Oscar after its first screening on [[Channel 4]] in 1982, and has won many other prizes internationally. From this, his famous song "[[Walking in the Air]]", for which he also wrote the lyrics, was the success that launched [[Aled Jones]] in 1985 (although Jones only recorded the song three years after the release of the film, while the song on the soundtrack is sung by the St Paul's chorister [[Peter Auty]]. Blake's concert version of ''The Snowman'' for narrator and orchestra is now performed worldwide, as is the full-length ballet of the same name, launched in 1997, which in 2013 celebrated its 16th consecutive Christmas season for [[Sadler's Wells]] at the [[Peacock Theatre]] in London.

In 1980, Blake was commissioned to write an orchestral music score for ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'', in collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He was given only 10 days to produce the results, and after completion fell ill with [[pneumonia]] brought on by exhaustion. He recovered, and he and Queen were jointly nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. It was, however, a disappointment to him that the makers of ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' did not use much of his score.

Blake has composed many concert works, including the Piano Concerto commissioned by the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] for the 30th birthday of [[Princess Diana]] in 1991, in which he also featured as soloist; the Violin Concerto to celebrate the centenary of the City of Leeds in 1993; the cantata to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations in 1995, performed in the presence of the Royal Family in [[Westminster Hall]]; and the large-scale choral/orchestral work ''Benedictus'', championed by [[Sir David Willcocks]] and the [[Bach Choir]], which was given its London premiere in [[Westminster Cathedral]] in 1989 with Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] as narrator, and which has been widely performed ever since.

More recent works are ''Lifecycle'' – 24 pieces for solo piano – recorded for ABC Classics in 2003; ''Songs of Truth and Glory'', the Elgar Commission for the [[Three Choirs Festival]] in 2005; and a first recording of ''The Land of Counterpane'' a song-cycle to words by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], recorded at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, with the [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]] in March 2007, which he conducted.

He is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music and, in 1994, received the OBE for services to music. On 20 October 2010 Blake was presented a [[BASCA]] Gold Badge Award for outstanding work within the music industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles//1198863/gold-badges-for-heather-small-john-paul-jones|title=Gold Badges For Heather Small, John Paul Jones|date=20 October 2010|website=Billboard.com|access-date=7 August 2020}}</ref>
