While their early records moved through heavy metal into dark [[indie rock]], their recent efforts for which they have received the most attention have been strongly influenced by the [[electronica]] scene, along with the other groups on the record label, [[Morr Music]].

== History ==
The Acher brothers and Messerschmid formed the group in 1989,<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=325/6}}</ref> in [[Weilheim in Oberbayern]], near [[Munich]]. In 1990, they recorded their self-titled debut, a grunge-metal oriented LP. 1992 saw the release of ''Nook'', which has an indie rock sound, while their 1995 album ''12'', contains their first flirtation with electronics.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>  Martin Gretschmann then joined the group in 1997. ''Shrink'', released in 1998, is a jazz-electro-rock album. In 1998, [[Cynthia Dall]] did the vocals for a remix of "Torture Day" by The Notwist. The album ''Neon Golden'' (released in 2002) put them on the map for [[United States|American]] listeners, with its heartfelt sentiment and more pop-oriented sound.

Messerschmidt left the group in 2007, and was replaced by Andi Haberl. The band's sixth album, ''The Devil, You + Me'', was released in Europe in May 2008.<ref>Thiessen, Brock.[https://archive.today/20120630114234/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=123&csid2=4&fid1=32041 "The Demonic Minds of the Notwist"], ''[[Exclaim!]]'', July 2008.</ref> On June 17, 2008 the album was released in North America on Domino Records.

In 2009, the Notwist recorded ''Storm'', the soundtrack to the [[Storm (2009 film)|film of the same name]] by director [[Hans-Christian Schmid]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howe|first1=Brian|title=The Notwist: Sturm album review|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13856-sturm/|publisher=Pitchfork|access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref> In late 2012 they began playing songs from a new album on tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musikexpress.de/magazin/gewinnen/article340796/maifeld-derby-mannheim-festival-tickets-zu-gewinnen.html |title=MAIFELD DERBY MANNHEIM: FESTIVAL-TICKETS ZU GEWINNEN |work=Musikexpress |date=December 11, 2012}}</ref> The album, ''[[Close to the Glass]]'', was released on February 24, 2014 under Sub Pop Records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53055-the-notwist-announce-new-album-close-to-the-glass-share-title-track/ |title=The Notwist Announce New Album ''Close to the Glass'', Share Title Track |date=November 19, 2013 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]}}</ref>

In 2014, [[Martin Gretschmann]] left the group.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/indie-rockband-the-notwist-wir-machen-keine-kompromisse.2588.de.html?dram:article_id=378867|title=Indie-Rockband The Notwist - "Wir machen keine Kompromisse"|work=Deutschlandfunk|access-date=2018-01-05|language=de-DE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.demorgen.be/muziek/the-notwist-in-de-vooruit-sie-schaffen-das-bfa97ff3/|title=The Notwist in de Vooruit: Sie schaffen das|last=Coupé|first=Pieter|work=De Morgen|access-date=2018-01-05|language=nl-BE}}</ref>
