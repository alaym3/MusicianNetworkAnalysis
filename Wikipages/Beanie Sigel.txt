==Music career==
===Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam years (1999–2006)===
[[Roc-A-Fella Records]] released Beanie Sigel's debut album, ''[[The Truth (Beanie Sigel album)|The Truth]]''  on February 29, 2000, to critical and commercial success.

In 2002, Sigel and much of the Roc-A-Fella roster starred in ''[[State Property (film)|State Property]]''. Its release coincided with the creation and promotion of [[State Property (group)|State Property]], a group of Philadelphia artists signed to Roc-A-Fella, who were organized by Sigel and [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]]. Its members included [[Peedi Crakk]], the [[Young Gunz]] ([[Neef Buck]] & [[Young Chris]]), Oschino and [[Omillio Sparks]]. Their first collaboration was for the movie's soundtrack, an eponymous release that featured the original "[[Roc the Mic]]" by Sigel and Freeway. 2003's ''[[The Chain Gang Vol. 2]]'' followed, featuring the single "[[Can't Stop, Won't Stop (Young Gunz Song)|Can't Stop, Won't Stop]]" by the Young Gunz. The record was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1480933/20031204/jay_z.jhtml "Jay-Z, Beyonce, Outkast, Pharrell Nab Most Grammy Nominations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911092552/http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1480933/20031204/jay_z.jhtml |date=2009-09-11 }}, Jon Wiederhorn, [[VH-1]], December 4, 2003.</ref>

In 2005, before serving a one-year prison sentence stemming from an earlier arrest, Sigel shot multiple videos, directed by Joe Briscella, and finished his third album ''[[The B. Coming]]''. During this time, Sigel's label head at Roc-A-Fella, [[Jay-Z]], became president of its parent label, [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]], which caused former business partners Damon Dash and Kareem "Biggs" Burke to leave and form the Dame Dash Music Group. Dame Dash Music Group and Def Jam released Sigel's ''The B. Coming'' rather than Roc-A-Fella, but it still contained production from a slew of Roc/Jay Z-affiliated producers including Chad West, [[The Neptunes]], Just Blaze, [[Alrad Lewis|Boola]], and [[Buckwild]]. Sigel recruited cross–label MC talent for his album as well, including [[Cam'ron]] and [[Jay-Z]]. Sigel's record produced a hit track, "Feel it in the Air", and sold 131,000 copies in its first week.<ref>{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Chris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1499645/20050406/50_cent.jhtml |title=50 Cent on top for 5th week |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2005-04-06 |access-date=2011-08-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003081137/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1499645/20050406/50_cent.jhtml |archive-date=2010-10-03 }}</ref>

Advertising his friendship with the incarcerated Sigel, Dash publicly claimed that he was leaving the Roc-A-Fella roster to join him. Sigel's group, State Property was thrown into turmoil, but eventually chose to remain at Roc-A-Fella—apparently against Sigel's wishes. On his release, Sigel questioned the loyalty of his group and said that he was signing with Dame and Biggs due to a stronger relationship with the pair than with [[Jay-Z]]:

<blockquote>I've never been around Jay on an off day. It ain't like I made a choice of running with Dame and Biggs or 'Dame and Biggs held me down through my whole trial.' It's not that. I would be a sucker if I said I [signed with the Damon Dash Music Group] because they did that for me. It's love. You see how we chillin' now, this ain't about no business.<ref name="Disloyal"/></blockquote>

Soon after, he clarified his comments, saying he simply did not want to be involved in the conflict, and elected to re-open talks with Roc-A-Fella instead of moving to Dame Dash Music Group.<ref name="Disloyal">{{cite web |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1510706/20050930/sigel_beanie.jhtml |title=Beanie Sigel Signing With G-Unit?

Accessed 2007-11-21.</ref> On October 29, 2007, Sigel released the first single from ''[[The Solution (Beanie Sigel album)|The Solution]]'' entitled "All The Above" which featured [[R. Kelly]].

===Post Roc-A-Fella (2007–present)===
In 2009, Sigel released his first independent album ''[[The Broad Street Bully]]'' after his contracts with Roc-A-Fella Records and [[Def Jam Records]] had expired.

Sigel announced in 2010 he was working on his sixth studio album entitled ''The Closure'' which was to be released on [[Universal Republic]] and [[G-Unit Records]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Ryon |first=Sean |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.11447/title.beanie-sigel-prepares-the-closure-for-universal |title=Beanie Sigel Prepares "The Closure" For Universal &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2010-06-10 |access-date=2011-08-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010204448/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.11447/title.beanie-sigel-prepares-the-closure-for-universal |archive-date=2011-10-10 }}</ref> However, on May 31, 2011, Sigel cancelled the album and retired from the music industry for two weeks before deciding to return and work on the album again, re-titling it ''The Classic''.

On March 30, 2012, Sigel told [[Statik Selektah]] on [[Shade 45]] that he would be working on a collaborative album with southern veteran, and long-time friend, [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] titled ''Mac and Brad''. Scarface also tweeted the announcement at the same time via mobile. On that same day, while distribution deals with [[E1 Entertainment Distribution|E1]], [[The Orchard (company)|The Orchard]], and [[Asylum Records|Asylum]] were on the table, Sigel also decided to sign a distribution deal with [[EMI]] after one of his mutual friends garnered the interest of Chris Schwartz.
