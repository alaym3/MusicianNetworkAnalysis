She say she chose the six-second video service because it took less effort to upload short clips, compared to other popular services like [[YouTube]].<ref name=":0" />

Berhe graduated from [[Ross Sheppard High School]] in 2013. She attended [[MacEwan University]], but took time off her studies to focus on music.<ref name="CBC" />

==  Career ==
Berhe posted her first Vine video in May 2013, and started making singing Vines about a year later.<ref name=CBC /><ref name="Edmonton Journal" /> Her singing Vines, typically six second covers of popular songs, helped her grow a following.<ref name="Edmonton Journal" /> In November 2014,<!-- They say "November of last year" in the CBC video at 0:52 --> she posted a Vine of herself singing a line that she had made up, which was inspired by the television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''.<ref name=CBC /> It garnered around 84,000 likes within a week, which was unusual for her at the time. She took note of its popularity, with some of her followers commenting that she should make it into a full song.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.andpop.com/2015/11/30/ruth-b-talks-vine-the-intro-getting-inspired-by-once-upon-a-time/|title = Ruth B Talks Vine, The Intro & Getting Inspired By 'Once Upon A Time'|date = November 30, 2015|access-date = December 6, 2015|website = ANDPOP|last = Khan|first = Sarah}}</ref> It became  "Lost Boy", which she posted on [[YouTube]] on January 18, 2015 and which was released on [[iTunes]] on February 12, 2015.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Berhe entered the studio in early 2016 to begin recording her debut full-length album with [[Joel Little]], a New Zealand producer who helped [[Lorde]] create her first album. She say she was writing songs long before the album went into production, so she had many songs to pick from when her label told her it was time to start putting something together.<ref name=":0" />

She honored National Arts Centre Award winner Michael Buble at the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards gala by performing his song "Home." Later, at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, she performed Neil Young's song "Heart of Gold" to honor his induction into the Canadian Songwriters Hall Of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruthbofficial.com/news/|title=News|website=Ruth B.|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref>

At the [[Juno Awards of 2017|2017 Juno Awards]] Berhe was nominated for the Juno Fan Choice Award and Songwriter of the Year, and won Breakthrough Artist of the Year. She later performed her single "Lost Boy."{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The following year at the [[Juno Awards of 2018|2018 Juno Awards]], she was nominated for three awards including Artist of the Year, Album of the Year, and Pop Album of the Year.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In 2018, the [[CBC Kids]] television series ''[[Addison (TV series)|Addison]]'' debuted, with a theme song performed by Berhe. In May 2018, her song "Shadows" appeared in the second season of the Netflix series ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]''.

In the summer of 2020, she issued a new song called "If I Have a Son," and on August 28, 2020, the song and video for "Dirty Nikes" through new label "Downtown Records.
