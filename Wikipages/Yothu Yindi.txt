==Career==
===1986–1990: Early years===
Swamp Jockeys were formed in 1985 by ''balanda'' (European/non-Aboriginal people) Andrew Belletty on drums, Stuart Kellaway on bass guitar and Cal Williams on lead guitar.<ref name="ARDb"/> On their tour of [[Arnhem Land]], in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], they were supported by a [[Yolngu]] band composed of Witiyana Marika on ''manikay'' (traditional vocals), ''bilma'' (ironwood [[clapstick]]s) and dance, Milkayngu Mununggurr on ''yidaki'' ([[didgeridoo]]), [[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu|Gurrumul 'The Guru' Yunupingu]] on keyboards, guitar and percussion, and [[Mandawuy Yunupingu|Bakamana Yunupingu]] on vocals and guitar.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> They united to form Yothu Yindi (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|j|ɒ|θ|uː|_|ˈ|j|ɪ|n|d|iː}}), ''yothu yindi'' is a [[Yolngu Matha|Yolngu ''matha'']] (Yolngu language) kinship term for "child and mother". The band combines aspects of both musical cultures. Their sound varies from traditional Aboriginal songs to modern pop and rock songs in which they blend the typical instruments of pop/rock bands, such as guitars and drums, with the traditional ''yidaki'' and ''bilma''.They have adapted traditional Yolngu dance performances to accompany their music. More broadly they promote mutual respect and understanding of different cultures.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/>

Bakamana Yunupingu was a tertiary student studying to become a teacher. He became principal at his own [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] Community School, and touring by Yothu Yindi was restricted to school holidays in the band's early years.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/> In August 1988 they performed in [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]], at the South Pacific Festival of Arts. The next month they represented Australia in [[Seoul, South Korea]] at the Cultural Olympics. [[Bart Willoughby]] (ex-[[No Fixed Address (band)|No Fixed Address]], [[Coloured Stone]]) joined on drums in late 1988 and Yothu Yindi toured USA and Canada as support act to [[Midnight Oil]]. Upon their return to Australia, they were signed to [[Mushroom Records]], and with Leszek Karski (ex-Supercharge) producing, recorded their debut single "Mainstream", released in March 1989. It was followed by debut album ''[[Homeland Movement (album)|Homeland Movement]]'' in May; a second single "[[Djäpana|Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)]]" was released in August.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> Neither their singles nor album had any major chart success.<ref name="AusCharts"/> Yothu Yindi toured with [[Neil Young]] in Australia, then head-lined in Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong. In 1990 they toured New Zealand with [[Tracy Chapman]], and then performed in festivals in the UK.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/> In 1990 five clans of the Yolngu formed the Yothu Yindi Foundation to promote Yulngu cultural development.<ref name="YYF"/> Chairman of the foundation is [[Galarrwuy Yunupingu]],<ref name="Heal"/> Mandawuy's older brother, a Yolngu clan leader and sometimes a member of Yothu Yindi on ''bilma'' and guitar.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/><ref name="YYF"/> Galarrwuy had been named [[Australian of the Year]] in 1978 for his work for Aboriginal communities.<ref name="Heal"/> Around this time, a relative of Bakamana who bore the same name died, and he therefore changed his first name to Mandawuy, in line with Yolngu tradition.

The band commissioned their friend and relative (married to Gurrumul's sister), master yiḏaki-maker [[Djalu Gurruwiwi]],  to make their didgeridoos, which also brought his skills to the attention of the world.<ref>{{cite web | title=Djalu Gurruwiwi | website=iDIDJ Australia | url=https://www.ididj.com.au/djalu-gurruwiwi/ | access-date=20 January 2020}}</ref>

===1991–1992: "Treaty" and ''Tribal Voice''===
In 1988, as part of [[Australian Bicentenary#1988|Bicentennial]] celebrations, Australian Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] visited the Northern Territory for the Barunga festival where he was presented with a statement of Aboriginal political objectives by [[Galarrwuy Yunupingu]] and [[Wenten Rubuntja]].<ref name="Barunga">{{cite web|url=http://www1.aiatsis.gov.au/exhibitions/treaty/barunga.htm |title=Barunga Statement |last=Howie-Willis |first=Ian |year=2001 |publisher=The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) |access-date=4 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717022315/http://www1.aiatsis.gov.au/exhibitions/treaty/barunga.htm |archive-date=17 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Hawke responded to the Barunga Statement with a promise that a treaty would be concluded with [[Indigenous Australians]] by 1990.<ref name="Barunga"/> By 1991, Yothu Yindi were Hughie Benjamin on drums, Sophie Garrkali and Julie Gungunbuy as dancers, Kellaway, Marika, Mununggurr, Gurrumul Yunupingu, Makuma Yunupingu on ''yidaki'', vocals, ''bilma'', Mandawuy Yunupingu, Mangatjay Yunupingu as a dancer.<ref name="McF"/> Mandawuy, with his older brother Galarrwuy, wanted a song to highlight the lack of progress on the treaty between Aboriginal peoples and the federal government. Mandawuy recalls:

{{quote|Bob Hawke visited the Territory. He went to this gathering in Barunga. And this is where he made a statement that there shall be a treaty between black and white Australia. Sitting around the camp fire, trying to work out a chord to the guitar, and around that camp fire, I said, "Well, I heard it on the radio. And I saw it on the television." That should be a catchphrase.
