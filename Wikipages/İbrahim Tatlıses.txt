===Musical career===
İbrahim Tatlıses is often regarded as one of the best-known singers of Turkey, being so famous that he has the nicknames "İbo" and "İmparator". He has had a critically acclaimed and illustrious music career in genres such as [[Turkish folk music]] and [[Arabesque (Turkish_music)|Arabesk]], beginning in 1970 at the age of 18 with his first tape ''Kara Kız/Beni Yakma Gel Güzelim''. He sold tapes and sang at weddings/restaurants until a producer discovered him in 1976. The following year his album Ayağında Kundura, featuring songs such as ''Ayağında Kundura'', ''İndim Gülüm Bağına'' and ''Kırmızı Kurdele'', was a smash hit and propelled him to fame. Some of his earlier songs have Kurdish origin and were translated into Turkish. From then on, the hit albums came one after another, such as the 1983 album ''Yalan'',
the 1985 album ''Mavi Mavi'', and the 1987 album ''Allah Allah''. He has recorded a total of 42 albums from 1970 to 2014.

===Film and television===
İbrahim Tatlıses has appeared in a total of 37 movies/TV shows, beginning in 1978 with ''Sabuha''. In Turkey, well-known singers star in movies with the same name as the album they recently released, and thus the movies include songs from said albums. This is also seen in the 1975 ''Ayağında Kundura'', its namesake being his smash-hit album. From there he appeared in numerous movies in the 1980s and 1990s, further cementing his colossal fame as the most famous singer and a quite well-known actor in Turkey. Aside from the cinema industry, Tatlıses hosted the critically acclaimed and highly successful [[İbo Show]], which aired from 1993 to 2011. It was one of the most-watched and loved shows in Turkey.

===Marriages===
Tatlıses married his first wife, Adalet Sara, in Urfa. The couple had three children, a son named Ahmet Salim, and two daughters named Gülşen Sara and Gülden Ferrah. In 1979, he began a relationship with his ''Kara Yazma'' co-star [[Perihan Savaş]]. From his marriage to Savaş, he has a daughter named Melek Zübeyde. Savaş and Tatlıses later got divorced. In 1984, it was reported in the media that claims were made by Savaş that she was beaten for seven hours after being kidnapped by İbrahim Tatlıses, following which she applied to the prosecutor's office and asked for his arrest. Tatlıses said in his interrogation by the police, "Savaş is the mother of my child. To let her wonder around would make it feel beneath me."<ref name="candundar">{{cite web | url = http://www.candundar.com.tr/_old/index.php?Did=2688 | title = İbo hedefi vurdu! | accessdate = 15 March 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081310/http://www.candundar.com.tr/_old/index.php?Did=2688 | archivedate = 29 November 2014}}</ref> From his relationship with his ''Günah'' co-star, Derya Tuna, he has a son, named İbrahim "İdo" Tatlıses.

===Kurdish issue===
