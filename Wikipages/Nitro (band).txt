'''Nitro''' was an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. Formed in 1988, the group originally featured vocalist [[Jim Gillette]], guitarist [[Michael Angelo Batio]], bassist [[T. J. Racer]] and drummer Bobby Rock. Nitro released its debut album ''[[O.F.R. (album)|O.F.R.]]'' in 1989, which reached number 140 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Rock was replaced by K. C. Comet for the album's tour and Racer would leave the band thereafter. ''[[Nitro II: H.W.D.W.S.]]'', released in 1992, featured Ralph Carter on bass and Johnny Thunder on drums. The group broke up in 1993, with a number of previously unreleased demo recordings issued on the 1999 album ''[[Gunnin' for Glory]]''.

In late 2016, it was announced that Gillette and Batio had reformed the band, with [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] drummer [[Chris Adler]] added to the group's lineup. Plans were made to record a third album – which would have been the band's first full-length studio album since 1992 – with [[Victor Wooten]] on bass and [[Kane Churko]] producing. [[Matt DeVries]] performed in place of Wooten at live shows. In 2017, "It Won't Die" was released as the lead single from the album. However, Batio announced in May 2019 that the band had once again split up, but added that some of the material from the abandoned third album would surface on his next solo release.

After Nitro's breakup, a number of previously unreleased demo recordings were issued on the compilation ''[[Gunnin' for Glory]]'', released on Batio's record label [[M.A.C.E. Music]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://angelo.com/products/nitro-gunnin-for-glory-cd |title=Nitro Gunnin' for Glory CD |publisher=[[M.A.C.E.

In 2008, when asked at [[Rocklahoma]] festival about the possibility of a return for the group, Gillette commented that "It would be great to do; maybe next year", adding that "It would take about six months to get back to where I would like it to be vocally."<ref name="08reunion"/> However, Batio responded later in the year by revealing that he did not want to reform the band as Gillette was only interested in writing new material, not performing the band's old songs, which the guitarist explained would "not be the same".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/michael-angelo-batio-rules-out-nitro-reunion/ |title=Michael Angelo Batio Rules Out Nitro Reunion |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=December 24, 2008 |access-date=July 18, 2017 }}</ref>

===2016–2019: Return and cancelled third album===
On November 30, 2016, it was announced that Gillette and Batio were set to reform Nitro with then-[[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] drummer [[Chris Adler]].<ref name="16reunion">{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/lamb-of-god-chris-adler-joins-michael-angelo-batio-jim-gillette-in-reunited-nitro/ |title=Lamb Of God's Chris Adler Joins Michael Angelo Batio, Jim Gillette In Reunited Nitro |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=November 30, 2016 |access-date=July 18, 2017 }}</ref> Speaking about the potential style of the band's new material, Adler commented that "I'm blown away by the modern sound and groove in the material.

In a May 2019 interview, Batio announced that Nitro had once again broken up. When asked about the status of the band's slated third album, he said, "It's gone ... we just can't go back ... after we did a few songs, we did a tour together, we all realized".<ref name="2019breakup">{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nitro-reunion-is-over-we-just-cant-go-back-says-michael-angelo-batio/ |title=Nitro Reunion Is Over: 'We Just Can't Go Back,' Says Michael Angelo Batio |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=May 13, 2019 |access-date=May 13, 2019 }}</ref> The guitarist later added, "I'm best friends with Jim Gillette – we're like brothers. We never had an argument, even back in the old days", as well as assuring fans that some of the material recorded with Adler and Wooten would surface on his next solo release, due later in the year.<ref name="2019breakup"/>
