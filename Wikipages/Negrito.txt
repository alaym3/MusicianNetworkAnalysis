The term '''Negrito''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|t|oʊ}}) refers to several diverse ethnic groups who inhabit isolated parts of [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Andaman Islands]]. Populations classified as Negrito currenty include: the [[Andamanese peoples]] (including the [[Great Andamanese]], the [[Onge]] and [[Jarawas (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]] and the [[Sentinelese]]) of the Andaman Islands, the [[Semang]] peoples (among them, the [[Batek people]]) of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the [[Maniq people]] of [[Southern Thailand]], as well as the [[Aeta people|Aeta]] of [[Luzon Island]], [[Ati people|Ati]], and [[Suludnon|Tumandok]] of [[Panay Island]], [[Agta]] of [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] and [[Mamanwa]] of [[Mindanao Island]] and about 30 other officially recognized [[ethnic groups in the Philippines]].

Based on perceived physical similarities, Negritos were once considered a single population of closely related people. However genetic studies suggest that they consist of several separate groups, as well as displaying genetic heterogeneity. The Negritos form the indigenous population of Southeast Asia, but were largely absorbed into the more recent [[Austronesian peoples]]. The remainders form minority groups in geographically isolated regions.<ref>S.

==Etymology==
The word ''Negrito'' is the Spanish [[diminutive]] of ''[[negro]]'', used to mean "little black person." This usage was coined by 16th-century Spanish [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery|missionaries]] operating in the Philippines, and was borrowed by other European travellers and colonialists across Austronesia to label various peoples perceived as sharing relatively small physical stature and dark skin.<ref name=Manickham-2009>{{cite book|last=Manickham|first=Sandra Khor|editor=Hägerdal, Hans|title=Responding to the West: Essays on Colonial Domination and Asian Agency|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Onr3-thtL2MC&pg=PA69|year=2009|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-8964-093-2|pages=69–79|chapter=Africans in Asia: The Discourse of 'Negritos' in Early Nineteenth-century Southeast Asia}}</ref> Contemporary usage of an alternative Spanish epithet, ''Negrillos'', also tended to bundle these peoples with the [[pygmy peoples]] of [[Central Africa]], based on perceived similarities in stature and complexion.<ref name=Manickham-2009/> (Historically, the label ''Negrito'' has also been used to refer to African pygmies.)<ref>See, for example: ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition, 1910–1911: "Second are the large Negrito family, represented in Africa by the dwarf-races of the equatorial forests, the [[Aka (Pygmy tribe)|Akkas]], [[Batwa]]s, [[Wochua]]s and others..." (p. 851)</ref> The appropriateness of using the label "Negrito" to bundle peoples of different [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] based on similarities in stature and complexion has been challenged.<ref name=Manickham-2009/>

Many online dictionaries give the plural in English as either "Negritos" or "Negritoes," without preference. The plural in Spanish is "Negritos."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Negrito|title=Definition of NEGRITO|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Negrito|title=Negrito|via=The Free Dictionary}}</ref>

== Culture ==
Most Negrito groups lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s, while some also used [[agriculture]]. Today most Negrito groups live assimilated to the majority population of their homeland. Discrimination and [[poverty]] are often problems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rutufoundation.org/hunting-gathering-in-the-tropical-rainforest-something-for-children/|title=The {{sic|succ|esful|nolink=y}} revival of Negrito culture in the Philippines|date=2015-05-06|website=Rutu Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>

==Origins==
=== Origin and genetic relations ===
Negrito peoples descend from a Basal-East Asian source population, which expanded from Mainland Southeast Asia into Insular Southeast Asia between 50,000BC to 25,000BC, and also gave rise to [[Andamanese peoples]] and [[East Asian people]] as well as ancestral [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americas]]. Despite being isolated, the different peoples do share [[population genetics|genetic similarities]] with their neighboring populations.<ref name="Thangaraj2002">{{citation|first=Kumarasamy|last=Thangaraj|title=Genetic Affinities of the Andaman Islanders, a Vanishing Human Population|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(02)01336-2|pmid=12546781|journal=Current Biology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=86–93|date=21 January 2003|s2cid=12155496|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="Stock-2013">{{cite journal|last=Stock|first=JT|year=2013|title=The skeletal phenotype of "negritos" from the Andaman Islands and Philippines relative to global variation among hunter-gatherers|url=http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2052&context=humbiol|journal=[[Human Biology (journal)|Human Biology]]|volume=85|issue=1–3|pages=67–94|doi=10.3378/027.085.0304|pmid=24297221|s2cid=32964023}}</ref><ref name="Larena"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Tianyi|last2=Wang|first2=Wei|last3=Xie|first3=Guangmao|last4=Li|first4=Zhen|last5=Fan|first5=Xuechun|last6=Yang|first6=Qingping|last7=Wu|first7=Xichao|last8=Cao|first8=Peng|last9=Liu|first9=Yichen|last10=Yang|first10=Ruowei|last11=Liu|first11=Feng|date=2021-07-08|title=Human population history at the crossroads of East and Southeast Asia since 11,000 years ago|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421006358|journal=Cell|language=en|volume=184|issue=14|pages=3829–3841.e21|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.018|issn=0092-8674}}</ref>

The Andamanese Onge show the highest affinity towards some Southeast Asian Negrito ethnic groups, such as the [[Aeta people]], but also ancient remains of [[Hoabinhian]]s, which split from a Basal-East Asian source population. It was found that Andamanese (Onge) split from the common ancestor of modern day East Asians, before becoming isolated on the [[Andaman Islands]]. Recent genetic evidence suggest that an Basal-East Asian population (close or ancestral to Andamanese and East Asians) was widespreaded in [[Asia]] but already distinct from West-Eurasians and Australo-Melanesians (such as [[Papuans]]) since approximately 50,000BC to 62,000BC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlhoff|first=Selina|last2=Duli|first2=Akin|last3=Nägele|first3=Kathrin|last4=Nur|first4=Muhammad|last5=Skov|first5=Laurits|last6=Sumantri|first6=Iwan|last7=Oktaviana|first7=Adhi Agus|last8=Hakim|first8=Budianto|last9=Burhan|first9=Basran|last10=Syahdar|first10=Fardi Ali|last11=McGahan|first11=David P.|date=2021|title=Genome of a middle Holocene hunter-gatherer from Wallacea|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387238/|journal=Nature|volume=596|issue=7873|pages=543–547|doi=10.1038/s41586-021-03823-6|issn=0028-0836|pmc=8387238|pmid=34433944|quote=The qpGraph analysis confirmed this branching pattern, with the Leang Panninge individual branching off from the Near Oceanian clade after the Denisovan gene flow, although with the most supported topology indicating around 50% of a basal East Asian component contributing to the Leang Panninge genome (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Figs. 7–11).}}</ref><ref name="Afri, Vallini 2021"/> A recent genetic study on Philippene groups found Papuan affinities in Negritos, and a clear distinction between them and non-Negrito groups of East Asian origin, stating that there was "a clear dichotomy between Negritos and non-Negritos, indicating the deep divergence between Basal East Asian ancestry best represented by Cordillerans [descedants of Austronesian settlers from Taiwan] and Basal Australasian ancestry represented by Negrito-AustraloPapuans".
