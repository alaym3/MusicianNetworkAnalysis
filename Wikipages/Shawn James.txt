'''Shawn James''' (born September 10, 1983) is a Guyanese-American former professional [[basketball]] player who last played for [[Cariduros de Fajardo]] of the [[Baloncesto Superior Nacional]] (BSN). Standing at {{height|ft=6|in=10}}, he played at the [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] and [[center (basketball)|center]] positions. In 2010–11, he was the [[Israeli Basketball Premier League Statistical Leaders|top rebounder in the Israel Basketball Premier League]].  In 2013 he was the [[Israeli Basketball Premier League Defensive Player of the Year]], and named to the [[All-EuroLeague Team|All-EuroLeague Second Team]].

==College career==
After playing in  Brooklyn's Redirection High School, he transferred to [[Notre Dame Preparatory School (Fitchburg, Massachusetts)|Notre Dame Prep]] in Massachusetts to develop his game under coach Bill Barton, who would become his assistant coach later in college.

After a decent season, only two [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] schools believed in his potential, hometown's [[St. Francis College|St. Francis]] and Boston's [[Northeastern University]], he chose the latter.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Axelrod|first1=Phil|title=Dukes' James on record-setting trail|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/2008/01/18/Dukes-James-on-record-setting-trail/stories/200801180242|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=post-gazette.com|date=18 January 2008}}</ref> This proved to be a wise pick for the Huskies, James' 136 blocks in [[2004–05 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2004-2005]] broke the school's season record, also ranking him second in the nation. His scoring, field goal accuracy and rebounding allowed him to record two [[Double (basketball)#Triple-double|triple doubles]] on the way to [[America East Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|America East]] Rookie and Defensive Player of the Year awards.

The [[2005–06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|next season]] he did even better, breaking the [[List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season blocks leaders|NCAA record for blocks per game in a season]] with 6.53, he had more blocks than 316 of 326 Division I teams, also averaging 12.4 points and 7.9 rebounds (with two more triple doubles) he was again Defensive Player of the Year, this time in the [[Colonial Athletic Association]].

When coach [[Ron Everhart]] moved to [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]] for the next season, James followed him there, under NCAA transfer rules he had to sit out the 2007 season, which he would have had to do in all cases as he was injured following the [[#Duquesne shootings|shooting (see above)]].

He came back the following season having seemingly shrugged off his injury, breaking the school record for blocks in a season with 111 (for perspective he beat [[Derrick Alston]]'s previous record of 60) and led the team in scoring and rebounding as part of the Duke's first winning season in 14 years, earning a spot on the [[Atlantic 10 Conference|Atlantic 10]] Defensive Team. At the end of the season he declared himself for early entry in the [[2008 NBA draft]] and later signed with an agent, forfeiting his senior year at a university<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/draft2008/news/story?id=3387703 "Center set to enter NBA draft after hiring agent."]''[[ESPN]]'', Pittsburgh, 8 May 2008. Retrieved on 18 March 2015.</ref> that he left under acrimonious circumstances after his [[#Duquesne shootings|lawsuit and accusations towards Everhart (see above)]].

He finished his college career with 443 blocks that put him 9th in the all time [[List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaders|ranking for blocks]], his five triple doubles were one short of tying the NCCA record.

===Duquesne shootings===
On 17 September 2006, James and four other [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]] teammates Sam Ashaolu, Stuart Baldonado, [[Aaron Jackson (basketball)|Aaron Jackson]] and Kojo Mensah were the victims of an unprovoked shooting on the university's Pittsburgh campus. 
Ashaolu was shot in the head and neck, Mensah in the shoulder and arm, Baldonado through his back into his elbow, James in his left foot whilst Jackson was only grazed on the wrist by a bullet.<ref>Katz, Andy [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2593080 "James: Woman, boyfriend argued before shootings."]''[[ESPN]]'', 21 September 2006. Retrieved on 18 March 2015.</ref>

The shooter William B. Holmes II pleaded guilty to the shootings and was sentenced to up to 40 years in prison whilst the other gunman, Derek Lee, was sentenced to up to 14 years in prison, former university student Brittany Jones was sentenced to two years of probation for helping her armed friends enter the student dance where the shootings took place. The altercation started after a woman who came to the party with them flirted with one of the players.

James later sued [[Duquesne University]] in June 2008, alleging that they failed to provide adequate security on campus and that coach Everhart had made him play injured, all of which restricted his professional career opportunities. The lawsuit, as the similar ones lodged by Ashaolu, Baldonado and Mensah, was dismissed by a federal judge.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-Duquesne players shot at 2006 dance sue university|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3457290|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=sports.espn.go.com|date=23 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Judge tosses lawsuits by Duquesne basketball players who were shot on campus|url=http://www.wtae.com/sports/Judge-tosses-lawsuits-by-Duquesne-basketball-players-who-were-shot-on-campus/19543980|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=wtae.com|date=1 April 2013}}</ref>

==Professional career==

===2008–11: Bnei Hasharon===
After going [[undrafted]] in the [[2008 NBA draft]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Andy|title=Disappointing night for many early entrants|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/columns/story?id=3462999|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=sports.espn.go.com|date=30 June 2008}}</ref> on 9 June 2008, he signed his first professional contract, a two-year deal with [[Israeli Basketball Premier League|Israeli League]] side [[Bnei Hasharon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Shawn James Profile|url=http://data.shamsports.com/content/pages/playerProfiles/profileDisplay.jsp?id=1976|website=data.shamsports.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>

Having started the season injured, he slowly started to adapt to the European game and despite limited playing time he led the league in blocks in a team that was eliminated in the first round of the [[2008–09 Israeli Basketball Super League#Playoff|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Israel Basketball - Statistics Leaders 2008–09 season|url=http://www.basket.co.il/StatsPage_Leaders.asp?StatsBoard=0&cYear=2009&lang=en|website=basket.co.il|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> 

After repeating the feat the next season, and improving his stats in all areas to have the third-best [[Performance Index Rating|valuation]] in the league, he signed a one-year extension to his contract. The next season, he exploded into the spotlight, again dominating the league for blocks but also for rebounds, which, coupled with good shooting accuracy and solid scoring, made him the best valued player in the league, although not being named MVP. In 2010–11, he was the [[Israeli Basketball Premier League Statistical Leaders|top rebounder in the Israel Basketball Premier League]]. 

===2011–14: Maccabi Tel Aviv===
In May 2011, he signed a two-year contract with [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]], moving from the club that never passed the first match up in the playoffs to league champion and European powerhouse. The contract was reportedly worth $350,000 per season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Basketball / American center inks deal with Maccabi Tel Aviv|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/sports/basketball-american-center-inks-deal-with-maccabi-tel-aviv-1.365051|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=haaretz.com|date=31 May 2011}}</ref>

His first season with Maccabi allowed him to play against Europe's best in the [[2011–12 Euroleague|EuroLeague]] where they reached the quarter finals. On a team level it was a good season, winning the [[2011–12 ABA League|Adriatic League]], his first trophy, the [[2011–12 Israeli Basketball Super League|Israeli League]] and the [[2012 Israeli Basketball League Cup|Israeli Cup]]. On a personal level his playing time diminished as did his stats, although he still managed to top the league in blocks.

He had yet another good 2012–13 season, once again he led the Israeli league in blocks which led to being named the [[Israeli Basketball Premier League Defensive Player of the Year]]. He was also part of the [[Israeli Basketball Premier League Quintet|All-BSL 1st team]], even whilst Maccabi lost their title for the first time in 3 years. However, it was in the [[2012–13 Euroleague|EuroLeague]] that he would shine, starting in the majority of his team's games, leading the completion in blocks per game, second in rebounding and fourth in [[Performance Index Rating|PIR]] on the way to an [[All-EuroLeague Team|All-EuroLeague Second Team]] selection.<ref>{{cite news|title=2012-13 All-Euroleague First and Second Teams announced|url=http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/113030/2012-13-all-euroleague-first-and-second-teams-announced|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=euroleague.net|date=6 May 2013}}</ref>

Signing a new four-year deal, fan favorite James was even appointed captain, the first non-Israeli captain in the history of the club.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sinai|first1=Allon|title=Mac TA’s roster highlights concern surrounding local hoops development|url=http://www.jpost.com/Sports/Mac-TAs-roster-highlights-concern-surrounding-local-hoops-development-328821|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=jpost.com|date=16 October 2013}}</ref> In a cruel twist of fate, he got injured halfway through the next season, the ruptured disk in his back requiring surgery and ending his season,<ref>{{cite news|title=Surgery recommended for Maccabi's James|url=http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/131125/surgery-recommended-for-maccabi-s-james|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=euroleague.net|date=27 January 2014}}</ref> he had to watch from the sidelines as Maccabi won the [[2013–14 Euroleague|European title]] for the first time in nearly 10 years.

With the departure of coach [[David Blatt]] to the [[NBA]] and in all probability because of his injury history, he was released by the club on 28 July 2014, ending a fruitful three-year collaboration.<ref name=Released />

===2014–15: Olimpia Milano===
A few days later, on 31 July 2014, he signed a two-year deal with rival EuroLeague team [[Olimpia Milano|EA7 Emporio Armani Milano]] of the Italian [[Lega Basket Serie A|Serie A]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Intimidator is coming: Shawn James|url=http://www.olimpiamilano.com/en/the-intimidator-is-coming-shawn-james/|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=olimpiamilano.com|date=31 July 2014}}</ref> Throughout the season he struggled to regain his past form, seeing limited playing time and generally coming short of the expectations from team and fans: in August he reached an agreement with EA7 Emporio Armani Milano for the early termination of his contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/italy/serie-a/172840/shawn-james-parts-ways-with-olimpia-milano.html|title=Shawn James parts ways with Olimpia Milano}}</ref>

===2015–18===
In August 2015, he signed a one-year deal with [[Bilbao Basket]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Shawn James, poderío interior para el Dominion Bilbao Basket|url=http://www.acb.com/redaccion.php?id=115267|website=acb.com|language=Spanish|date=August 17, 2015}}</ref> On December 4, 2015, he parted ways with [[Bilbao Basket]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Shawn James no seguirá en el Dominion Bilbao Basket|url=http://www.acb.com/redaccion.php?id=118349|website=acb.com|language=Spanish|date=December 4, 2015}}</ref> Two days later [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos Piraeus]] signed James, paying his release fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/6ix7s5haijs6766i|title=Olympiacos adds former All-Euroleague center and champ James|work=euroleague.net|date=December 6, 2015}}</ref> His contract was terminated by mutual consent on January 23, 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.contra.gr/Basketball/Hellas/A1Basket/olympiacos/telos-o-son-tzeims-apo-ton-olympiako.3874379.html | title=Τέλος ο Σον Τζέιμς από τον Ολυμπιακό | publisher=contra.gr | date=23 January 2016 | accessdate=28 January 2016 | language=Greek}}</ref> On February 27, 2016, he signed with [[Eskişehir Basket]] in Turkish [[Turkish Basketball First League|TBL]] (second division) for the rest of the season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/europe/turkey/192344/shawn-james-inks-with-eskisehir-basket.html|title=Shawn James inks with Eskisehir Basket}}</ref>

On September 3, 2016, James signed with Montenegrin club [[KK Budućnost Podgorica|Budućnost Podgorica]] for the 2016–17 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/europe/montenegro/211024/shawn-james-signs-with-buducnost-voli.html|title=Shawn James signs with Buducnost VOLI}}</ref> On December 28, 2016, he parted ways with Budućnost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportando.com/en/europe/montenegro/221600/buducnost-shawn-james-part-ways.html|title=Buducnost, Shawn James part ways}}</ref>
