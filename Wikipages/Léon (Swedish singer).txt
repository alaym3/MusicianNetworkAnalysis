=== 2015–2017: First EPs ===
Her first single, "Tired of Talking", off her debut release, ''Treasure'' (EP), gained immediate attention earning praise from the music executive and producer [[Chris Anokute]] and getting a mention by the singer [[Katy Perry]], who tweeted "she's one to watch!" The song went viral clocking up millions of plays on streaming platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Léon, Sweden's Next Big Thing, Is Ready for Her Album to Drop|language=en|newspaper=Vogue|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/leon-interview-new-album-tired-of-talking|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Swedish singing sensation Léon isn't tired of talking about music, touring and ABBA|url=https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/local-arts/swedish-singing-sensation-leon-isnt-tired-of-talking-about-music-touring-and-abba|access-date=2021-07-31|website=vancouversun|language=en-CA}}</ref>

=== 2018–2019: Debut album ===
Léon's first full-length album, titled ''[[LÉON  (album)|LÉON]]'', was released in March 2019 via her own LÉON Recordings in partnership with [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]]. The album's release was preceded by the singles "Baby Don't Talk", "Falling" and the breakout song "You And I".

Produced by the production teams ELECTRIC and [[Captain Cuts]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-02-21 |title=LÉON releases debut album & video for 'You And I' |url=https://www.totalntertainment.com/music/leon-releases-debut-album-video-for-you-and-i/ |access-date=2021-03-20 |website=TotalNtertainment |language=en-GB}}</ref> the album blends modern electronic production values and more intimate stripped down sounds, with varied styles ranging from [[synth-pop]] to retro-pop and soul.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-03-04 |title=LÉON Talks Colorful Debut Album, "Want You Back," & More: Interview |url=https://www.idolator.com/7714495/leon-interview-album-touring?view-all |access-date=2021-03-20 |website=idolator}}</ref> 

The album was met with positive reviews from the critics, who praised its intricate melodies and intimate feel,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-04-05 |title=Léon by Léon – Album Review.

=== 2020–Present: ''Apart'' ===
After a series of singles, including "And It Breaks My Heart" and "Chasing a Feeling", Léon released her sophomore studio album, ''Apart'', in October 2020. Created in the midst of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the album was recorded and produced from start to finish in her hometown of Stockholm, with an old time collaborator, Martin Stilling.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sahai|first=Fred|date=2020-10-30|title=LÉON Faces Isolation on 'Apart'|url=https://www.papermag.com/leon-apart-2648552455.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-26|website=PAPER|language=en}}</ref>

Though overall similar in sound to the debut album, ''Apart'' features a more stripped-back production and is more personal in nature.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Pegg|first=Sam|date=2020-10-30|title=Not Life-Changing, But Worth the Listen; A Review of LEON's Apart|url=https://www.theedgesusu.co.uk/records/albums/2020/10/30/not-life-changing-but-worth-the-listen-a-review-of-leons-apart/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-26|website=The Edge|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Davies|first=Jeffrey|date=2020-11-04|title=LÉON's 'Apart' is her most directly personal work|url=https://www.popmatters.com/leon-apart-review-2648587445.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-26|website=PopMatters|language=en-US}}</ref> It has been characterized as a break-up album<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Jayswal|first=Palak|date=2020-12-01|title=Review: LÉON – Apart|url=https://www.slugmag.com/music/reviews-music/national-music-reviews/leon-apart/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-26|website=SLUG Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref> with songs filled with a sense of longing and nostalgia.<ref name=":0" /> The album received generally favourable reviews. Although critics noted that the album may be not as accomplished as Léon's first record – nor distinctly recognizable from it – they praised her song-writing abilities, and, like on her debut outing, her mature vocals.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

In May 2021, Léon collaborated with [[Jonas Blue]] on the dance house single "Hear Me Say", which quickly amassed 18 million plays on streaming platforms. The video for the song, directed by Alex Nicholson, was released in July 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-06-03|title=Jonas Blue Teams Up With LÉON To Share Uplifting House Single "Hear Me Say"|url=https://www.cultr.com/news/jonas-blue-teams-up-with-leon-to-share-uplifting-house-single-hear-me-say/|access-date=2021-07-31|website=CULTR|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bhanawat|first=Akshay|date=2021-07-04|title=Jonas Blue & LÉON Share Music Video For 'Hear Me Say'|url=https://themusicessentials.com/music/jonas-blue-leon-share-music-video-for-hear-me-say/|access-date=2021-07-31|website=T.H.E - Music Essentials|language=en-GB}}</ref>
