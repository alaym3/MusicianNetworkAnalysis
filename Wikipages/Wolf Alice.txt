==History==
===2010–2016: Formation, EPs and ''My Love Is Cool''===
Wolf Alice were formed in 2010 and began as an acoustic duo between Ellie Rowsell and Joff Oddie. Their name came from a [[The Bloody Chamber#Wolf-Alice|short story]] by [[Angela Carter]].<ref name="French">French, Matthew (2013) "[http://www.clashmusic.com/features/otw-481-wolf-alice OTW #481: Wolf Alice]", ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'', 26 February 2013.

Retrieved 9 March 2013</ref> Eventually deciding to add electric elements to their sound, they recruited Rowsell's childhood friend Sadie Cleary to play bass and Oddie's friend James DC to be their drummer. They self-released an EP called ''Wolf Alice'' that year, featuring three songs: "Every Cloud", "Wednesday", and "Destroy Me".<ref name="Flood">{{cite web |last=Amorosi |first=AD |url=http://floodmagazine.com/25874/what-is-real-wolf-alice/ |title=What Is Real?: Wolf Alice |work=Flood Magazine |date=10 February 2016 |access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref>

When James DC broke his wrist in 2012, Joel Amey joined the band as a temporary replacement drummer, but later became a permanent member. In that same year, Cleary left to focus on her studies.
