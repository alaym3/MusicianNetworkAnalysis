==Career==
Tommy Lee Sparta began deejaying in late 2007 at Snipa Studios in Flanker, where he recorded his first song, "Spartan Story."  During this time, he performed as an [[opening act]] for local shows, including several from [[Portmore, Jamaica|Portmore]] artist Vybz Kartel.  Kartel, noticing that the artist was receiving positive responses from the crowd, invited him to move to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and become a part of the Portmore Empire, Kartel's music crew.  Tommy Lee Sparta, however, was reluctant to leave his family and neighborhood, and declined the offer.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Tommy Lee Sparta |series=Noisey Jamaica |author1=Snoop Lion |author-link=Snoop Lion |author2=Andy Capper |author2-link=Andy Capper |author3=Codine Williams |author4=Trevor Silmser |network=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=5 February 2013 |number=3 |url=http://noisey.vice.com/noisey-jamaica/tommy-lee-sparta |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>

According to Tommy Lee Sparta, it wasn't until his performance at Vybz Kartel's Birthday Bash on 7 January 2010 that he decided to take the idea of being a musician seriously, and he soon accepted the offer to become an official member of the Portmore Empire crew.<ref name="pree">Russell, Leroy (8 September 2012).

Tommy Lee Sparta's breakthrough hit came with "Some Bwoy (Link Pon Wi Chain)" on the 2011 So Bad Riddim.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tommy Lee eyes int'l market |first=Curtis |last=Campbell |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20130118/ent/ent4.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=10 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121082122/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20130118/ent/ent4.html |archive-date=21 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, it wasn't until well after [[Vybz Kartel#Arrest and imprisonment|Kartel's arrest]] and the release of the music video in 2012, under new management from Junior "Heavy-D" Fraser, that the single gained traction.  The single worked its way to the number one spot of many of Jamaica's informal music charts, including Pree Dis and Entertainment Report, and the video was in heavy rotation on [[Caribbean]] stations such as RETV, Hype TV, and [[Tempo Networks]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Tommy Lee, Khago to headline Ochi Seafood Festival August 6 |url=http://northcoasttimesjamaica.com/2012/07/tommy-lee-khago-to-headline-ochi-seafood-festival-august-6/ |newspaper=North Coast Times |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>  "Some Bwoy," along with follow-up singles such as "Psycho," "Buss a Blank," We want paper  and "Shook (Uncle Demon)," gave Tommy Lee Sparta significant exposure locally as well as internationally and in 2012 he was not only the headlining artist for both the International  [[Reggae Sumfest]] show  in Montego Bay and the Sting music festival in Portmore but he was also the first full blown dancehall artist from the second city Montego Bay to do he was 23 years old at the time.<ref name="bare">{{cite news |title=Tommy Lee with 'bare' badness |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Tommy-Lee-with--bare--badness_12523006 |newspaper=[[The Jamaica Observer|Jamaica Observer]] |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tommy Lee to headline Sting |first=Basil |last=Walters |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Tommy-Lee-to-headline-Sting_12581345 |newspaper=Jamaica Observer |date=21 September 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dancehall Night Brings Out A Galaxy Of Stars |first=Adrian |last=Frater |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120721/ent/ent1.html |newspaper=[[Gleaner Company|Jamaica Gleaner]] |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>

In May 2012, Adidjahiem Records was shut down, citing the legal issues of owner Vybz Kartel and lack of ability to represent/promote artists as reasons for the closure.  Since then Tommy lee sparta has been an independent artist with his own record label Guzu musiq and his musical group the SPARTA Camp which consist of artistes like Dre x Sparta and more.<ref>{{cite news |title=Portmore Empire is no more |first=Davina |last=Henry |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20120524/ent/ent1.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=24 May 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231100725/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20120524/ent/ent1.html |archive-date=31 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Russell, Leroy (15 June 2012).

In September 2012, Tommy Lee announced that he would be changing his stage name to Tommy Lee Sparta for [[trademark]] purposes, and to differentiate himself from [[Mötley Crüe]] drummer [[Tommy Lee]] and actor [[Tommy Lee Jones]].  The element "Sparta" was derived from an informal name given to the part of Flankers where he grew up.  The move was suggested by his lawyer as a way to thwart potential copycat musicians from impersonating the artist.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tommy Lee trademarks name |first=Davina |last=Henry |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20120928/ent/ent1.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=28 September 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230214242/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20120928/ent/ent1.html |archive-date=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Bounty Killer feud===
In September 2012, a feud formed between Tommy Lee Sparta and [[The Alliance (dancehall)|Alliance]] leader [[Bounty Killer]] over a series of [[Twitter]] posts that were perceived as an insult to Tommy Lee Sparta.  One such message from Bounty Killer on 8 September said, "Christmas is 4 christ so nuh demon or devil cyaah win we a [[wiktionary:bloodclat|bloodclaat]] all a dem a dead a sting!!!"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/GrungGaadZillA/status/244556967375417345 |title=Tweet by @GrungGaadZillA |last=Price |first=Rodney |date=8 September 2012 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>  This was widely believed to be a reference to Tommy Lee Sparta's "Uncle Demon" persona and a threat against the artist regarding the upcoming Sting music festival on [[Boxing Day]].  Bounty Killer, however, denied that the tweet was directed towards Tommy Lee Sparta, stating that the message was against [[Devil in Christianity|the devil]] and not any artist in particular. Tommy Lee Sparta said of the slight that he had great respect for the artist as an elder dancehall musician, and that as the statement was probably made to garner publicity, he would not respond with any disrespect.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bounty lashes out at Tommy Lee - Others also voice concern about demonic songs |first=Curtis |last=Campbell |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20120911/ent/ent1.html |newspaper=Jamaica Star |date=11 September 2012 |accessdate=9 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103135606/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20120911/ent/ent1.html |archive-date=3 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="bounty">Price, Rodney (8 December 2012).

However, just a little over a week later, Tommy Lee Sparta released the music video for a new [[diss track]] directed towards Bounty Killer entitled "Goat Head."  Bounty Killer responded the next month with two diss songs of his own, "Di Gaad" and "Nyammy Lee."  As a result of the growing feud, the two artists were slated to [[sound clash|clash]] at the 2012 Sting music festival, with Bounty Killer comparing the matchup as equivalent to "a giant and an ant."<ref name="bounty"/>  However, when Sting's lead promoter, Isaiah Laing, implied that Tommy Lee Sparta might have a chance of defeating the veteran artist, Bounty Killer saw the remark as an insult and cancelled his performance.  During Tommy Lee Sparta's performance at Sting, he expressed his support and respect for Bounty Killer, and both artists have since stated they consider the feud to be over.<ref>Price, Rodney (Jan 2012).
