'''F4''' ('''Flower Four''') or '''JVKV''' was a Taiwanese [[boy band]] consisting of [[Jerry Yan]], [[Vanness Wu]], [[Ken Chu]], and [[Vic Chou]]. The group F4 was formed in 2001 after the [[Taiwanese drama]] ''[[Meteor Garden (2001 TV series)|Meteor Garden]]'' that they starred in was widely successful. Together they have starred in several Taiwanese drama series and released three albums, ''[[Meteor Rain (album)|Meteor Rain]]'' (2001), ''[[Fantasy 4ever]]'' (2002), and ''[[Waiting for You (F4 album)|Waiting for You]]'' (2007).

According to ''[[Forbes]]'', F4 has sold 3.5 million copies of their first two albums all over Asia as of July 2003.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alexandra Kirkman|date=July 7, 2003|title=Big--But Not Here|url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2003/0707/094.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030812175747/https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2003/0707/094.html|archive-date=August 12, 2003|access-date=May 18, 2020|work=[[Forbes]]}}</ref> In 2007, due to copyright issues, the group changed its name to JVKV, using the descending age of the initials of its members.<ref name="nameinitials" /> Other than their country of origin, Taiwan, they have also attained popularity in other parts of Asia, such as the Philippines, mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, and South Korea.

==History==
===2001: Formation and ''Meteor Garden''===
The group formed as a result of the success of a Taiwanese drama series, ''[[Meteor Garden (2001 TV series)|Meteor Garden]]''. The series is an adaptation of the Japanese [[shōjo]] [[manga]] series ''[[Boys Over Flowers|Hana Yori Dango]]''. Yan plays the lead role of Dao Ming Si, an extremely arrogant and rich university student who meets his match in the poor but proud girl, Shan Cai. Chou, Wu and Chu play as his friends Hua Ze Lei, Mei Zuo, and Xi Men, respectively. In the series, the four guys identify themselves as a group called "Flower Four", or often shortened as F4.

''Meteor Garden'' was released in Taiwan in 2001 and turned the leads into stars virtually overnight.<ref>{{cite web|date=June 16, 2006|title=CNN.com – F4 Talkasia Transcript – Jun 16, 2006|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/06/16/talkasia.f4.script/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628033915/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/06/16/talkasia.f4.script/index.html|archive-date=June 28, 2006|access-date=July 10, 2012|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=Edition.cnn.com}}</ref> In 2002 ''Meteor Garden'' was released in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines in 2003. The series was aired on Xing Kong channel, and was later remade in China. A sequel, ''[[Meteor Garden II]]'', was shot in Spain later and released in 2002.

===2001–03: Musical venture, ''Meteor Rain'', and ''Fantasy 4ever''===
In 2001, F4 became a boy band and signed a record deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Taiwan]]. In the same year they released their debut album, ''[[Meteor Rain (album)|Meteor Rain]]'', and in the following year they released ''[[Fantasy 4ever]]''. The album includes the [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] version of "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]" that they recorded for the Asian version of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' soundtrack,<ref>{{cite news|title=F4主唱《星际宝贝》横袭好莱坞 F4 singers hit Hollywood in ''Lilo & Stitch'' |url=http://www.netandtv.com/newspage/htm2002-6/200262695110716233.htm |publisher=NETandTV.com |date=June 26, 2002 |access-date=December 15, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627093714/http://www.netandtv.com/newspage/htm2002-6/200262695110716233.htm |archive-date=June 27, 2007 |language=zh |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> a Mandarin version of "Yo Te Amo" by [[Chayanne]], and a Pepsi advertisement theme song "Ask For More".

In 2003, they embarked on an Asian tour to support ''Fantasy 4ever'', and went on an unannounced hiatus afterwards as the members began to focus on their solo careers.

===2007–08: ''Waiting for You'' and name change to JVKV===
On April 29, 2007, ''Meteor Garden'' producer Angie Chai announced that the group would no longer be known as F4. The change in name stemmed from copyright-related issues. Japanese publisher [[Shueisha]], who owns the copyright to ''Hana Yori Dango'' allowed the group to use F4 as its band name in 2001. However, as Japan had filmed and aired its own live action versions of the popular manga, with its own cast of four, the publisher felt that there may be confusion over the name in different countries.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wang|first=Vivien|date=April 29, 2007|title=Boy band changes name F4 into JVKV|publisher=[[China Daily]]|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/lifestyle/2007-04/29/content_863824.htm|url-status=live|access-date=May 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602113218/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/lifestyle/2007-04/29/content_863824.htm|archive-date=June 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=May 14, 2007|title=''Boys over Flowers'' Forces F4 Idol Band to Rename Itself|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-05-14/boys-over-flowers-forces-f4-idol-band-to-rename-itself|url-status=live|access-date=June 5, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516040919/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-05-14/boys-over-flowers-forces-f4-idol-band-to-rename-itself|archive-date=May 16, 2007}}</ref> Due to this conflict, the group was renamed JVKV using the first initials of each of the group's members. According to the producer, the members are listed in the new name by the order of their birth dates from oldest to youngest, thus Vanness Wu's name appears before Vic Chou's.<ref name="nameinitials">{{in lang|zh}} [http://ent.163.com/07/0502/09/3DFROM19000327RF.html F4嫌新称呼JVKV绕口 合体宣传用回本名].
