==Early life==
Rosenfeld was born and grew up in [[East Germany]] in 1989, the son of a Soviet-born father of German descent working as a goldsmith and a German mother. He learned to create music on early versions of Schism Tracker and [[Ableton Live]] in the early 2000s, both rudimentary tools at the time.<ref name="Guardian">Keith Stuart, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/07/how-daniel-rosenfeld-wrote-minecraft-music How Daniel Rosenfeld wrote Minecraft's music] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616203842/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/07/how-daniel-rosenfeld-wrote-minecraft-music |date=16 June 2018 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 7 November 2014.</ref> It was his brother, Harry Rosenfeld, who introduced him to music composition through Ableton Live, commenting that "even an idiot" can successfully create music with it.<ref name="pcg"/> His brother was also known as C818, from which he chose the name C418, claiming that the name is "really cryptic and doesn't actually mean anything".<ref>{{cite web|author=BebopVox|title=C418 INTERVIEW, Minecraft Music & Sound Composer|work=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3DAAbwT6ak&t=75s|access-date=26 March 2018|archive-date=15 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215171356/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3DAAbwT6ak&t=75s|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History and career==

=== 2002–2009: Career beginnings ===

After being introduced to music production by Rosenfeld's brother, Daniel started releasing music on [[Bandcamp]] after [[Danny Baranowsky]] suggested releasing his music on the site.<ref>{{Citation|title=Minecon 2012 - The Music of Minecraft & Minecraft Documentary at 17:34|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDI2rHG1Xsc|language=en|access-date=2021-07-07}}</ref>

In 2007, Rosenfeld started a blog known as "Blödsinn am Mittwoch" (<small>English: "Silliness on Wednesday"</small>),<ref name=":0a">{{Cite web|last=Rosenfeld|first=Daniel|date=27 January 2017|title=Bushes and Marshmallows|url=https://c418.org/albums/bushes-and-marshmallows/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107004955/https://c418.org/albums/bushes-and-marshmallows/|archive-date=7 November 2017|access-date=2 November 2017|website=C418.org}}</ref> where he posted a new song every week. This was around the same time when he became interested in game development and audio, which resulted in him joining the indie game development forum [[TIGSource]], where he became involved with numerous smaller games and game developers<ref name=":1" /> (among them, Rosenfeld unofficially released the soundtracks of ''Zombie Dog in Crazyland'' and ''Mubbly Tower'' on his site<ref>{{Citation|title=Zombie Dog in Crazyland soundtrack by C418|url=https://discord.com/channels/275358751630819328/275734771575816194/733504312566874223|language=en|access-date=2021-10-20}}</ref> and old blog<ref>{{Citation|title=Mubbly Tower soundtrack on C418 old blog|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120171138/http://c418.org/archives/76|language=en|access-date=2021-10-20}}</ref>). Later, Rosenfeld started making albums and releasing them on the blog and also Bandcamp, as a hobby.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|title=Who is Daniel?|language=en-US|work=C418|url=https://c418.org/2017/01/25/who-is-daniel/|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020456/https://c418.org/2017/01/25/who-is-daniel/|archive-date=7 November 2017}}</ref>

His first release was the 2007 EP ''BPS'', and shortly thereafter, in 2008, he challenged himself to make a studio album as quickly as possible, for fun, prioritizing quantity over quality, ''The Whatever Director's Cut'' was released on his blog as BAM #30 and on his Bandcamp,<ref>{{Citation|title=The Whatever Director's Cut on Bandcamp.|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120205539/http://c418.org/archives/58|language=en|access-date=2021-10-20}}</ref> where it was available until it was removed in 2013, due to Rosenfeld's dislike of the album.

Also in 2008, Rosenfeld released ''Mixes'', a 25-minute medley containing remixes of songs previously posted on the blog, also were released the EP ''Sine'', and his second studio album ''Zweitonegoismus'', the album expressed his feelings working in an assembly line factory. Rosenfeld showed the album to his co-worker prior to releasing it, in which they asked "why the hell [he was] still working there".<ref>{{Cite web|title=zweitonegoismus|url=https://c418.org/albums/zweitonegoismus/|access-date=2021-07-15|website=C418|language=en-US}}</ref>.

His third studio album, ''Bushes and Marshmallows'', is loosely related to his blog, titled Blödsinn am Mittwoch. It is not a translation to English, as that loosely translates to "silliness on Wednesday".<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Untitled Minecraft album – C418 Wiki|url=https://c418wiki.absolutelywhizzer.co.uk/index.php?title=Untitled_Minecraft_album|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026032443/https://c418wiki.absolutelywhizzer.co.uk/index.php?title=Untitled_Minecraft_album|archive-date=26 October 2020|access-date=2020-08-27|website=c418wiki.absolutelywhizzer.co.uk}} {{unreliable source?|date=March 2021}}</ref> It was also his first album not to be released on the blog.

=== 2009–2013: Minecraft, becoming a freelance composer, and One ===

In early 2009, Rosenfeld began collaborating with the ''[[Minecraft]]'' creator [[Markus Persson|Markus "Notch" Persson]] through an internet forum called TIGSource. Rosenfeld was responsible for the sound effects and music in Persson's work-in-progress video game ''Minecraft''. The sound engine in the still young [[Java language|Java]] game was not very powerful, so Rosenfeld had to be creative in his approach to creating sound effects and music.<ref name="Guardian" />

In January 2010, fourth studio album ''A Cobblers Tee Thug'', a collaborative work with Rosenfeld's friend Sohnemann was released.<ref name=":1b">{{Cite web|title=A Cobblers Tee Thug, by C418|url=https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/a-cobblers-tee-thug|access-date=2021-10-20|website=C418}}</ref> Made in the few days they spent together in the New Year, and they challenged each other, for fun, to make a full-length LP together in those days.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=A Cobblers Tee Thug on C418.org.|url=https://c418.org/albums/a-cobblers-tee-thug/|access-date=2021-10-20|website=C418}}</ref>

That year was also released the album ''Circle'', the soundtrack for a 2008 unreleased indie game bearing the same name, created by an unknown developer.<ref>{{Cite news|title=circle|language=en-US|work=C418|url=https://c418.org/albums/circle/|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107024705/https://c418.org/albums/circle/|archive-date=7 November 2017}}</ref>

In August 2010, Rosenfeld released ''Life Changing Moments Seem Minor in Pictures''. The album was recorded while Rosenfeld was still residing within Germany,<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=life changing moments seem minor in pictures|url=https://c418.org/albums/life-changing-moments-seem-minor-in-pictures/|access-date=2021-07-17|website=C418|language=en-US}}</ref> and at the time of releasing the album, Rosenfeld was requested to work for military services after quitting his job, in which he instead did other labour.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1416057262616059909|user=C418|title=As I released the album, as if it was cursed or something, the German government forced me to join the military (wh…<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.

In 2011 a series of compilation albums with songs from various projects were released on Bandcamp for free, including ''Little Things'',<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=little things, by C418|url=https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/little-things|access-date=2021-10-20|website=C418}}</ref> ''I Forgot Something, Didn't I.''<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=I forgot something, didn't I., by C418|url=https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/i-forgot-something-didnt-i|access-date=2021-10-20|website=C418}}</ref> (this one specifically is a B-side to ''72 Minutes of Fame'') and ''Seven Years of Server Data''.<ref name=":1c">{{Cite web|title=Seven Years of Server Data, by C418|url=https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/seven-years-of-server-data|access-date=2021-10-20|website=C418}}</ref>

While still working on ''Minecraft'' as a freelance artist, Rosenfeld was not on staff at [[Mojang Studios]],<ref name="kotaku">Luke Plunkett, [http://kotaku.com/5779319/the-soothing-sounds-of-minecraft The Soothing Sounds Of...Minecraft?], Kotaku.com, 9 March 2011.</ref> the company behind ''Minecraft''. Rosenfeld still owns the rights to all his music in the game,<ref name="Polygon">Charlie Hall, [http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/18/6351607/minecrafts-composer-discusses-mojang-unreleased-game-notchs-departure Minecraft's composer discusses Mojang's unreleased game, Notch's departure] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629155227/http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/18/6351607/minecrafts-composer-discusses-mojang-unreleased-game-notchs-departure|date=29 June 2018}}, Polygon.com, 18 September 2014.</ref> and has released two albums featuring songs from the [[Minecraft (soundtrack)|''Minecraft'' soundtrack]].<ref name="kotaku" /> The first soundtrack, ''[[Minecraft (soundtrack)#Minecraft – Volume Alpha|Minecraft – Volume Alpha]]'', was digitally released on 4 March 2011 on his Bandcamp page.

Later that year, when ''Minecraft'' became available to the general public as an early access title, it rapidly became popular. Rosenfeld, who up until that point had worked at an assembly line, could now pursue music as his primary source of income.<ref name=":1" /> This inspired his 2011 studio album, ''72 Minutes of Fame''. The content of this album mostly revolves around this lifestyle-defining moment in Rosenfeld's life.<ref>{{Cite news|title=72 Minutes Of Fame|language=en-US|work=C418|url=https://c418.org/albums/72-minutes-of-fame/|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828203258/https://c418.org/albums/72-minutes-of-fame/|archive-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> This album was the first of Rosenfeld's works to have a (limited) physical release. ''[[The Guardian]]'' has compared his compositions to those of [[Brian Eno]] and [[Erik Satie]] because of their minimalistic, ambient quality.<ref name="Guardian" />

Almost half a year later, production on a documentary of the development of ''Minecraft'' started, titled ''[[Minecraft: The Story of Mojang]]''. Rosenfeld was requested to create the soundtrack for this documentary, which was included on his 2012 album, ''One''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Daniel|title=one – C418|url=http://c418.org/albums/one/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617154845/http://c418.org/albums/one/|archive-date=17 June 2020|access-date=17 June 2020|website=C418.org}}</ref>

=== 2013–2016: ''Minecraft - Volume Beta'', ''0x10<sup>c</sup>,'' and other independent projects ===

On 9 November 2013, Rosenfeld released the second album of the official soundtrack for ''Minecraft'', titled ''[[Minecraft (soundtrack)#Minecraft – Volume Beta|Minecraft – Volume Beta]]''. Many of the new songs were being added into features of the game that were not present when the first batch of music was produced; i.e. the Nether or the End.<ref name="Bandcamp2">{{cite web|url=http://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta|title=''Minecraft'' Volume Beta on Bandcamp|date=9 November 2013|access-date=9 November 2013|archive-date=9 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109190435/http://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2020, the soundtrack was released in physical format with [[Ghostly International]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Minecraft Volume Beta|url=https://ghostly.com/products/minecraft-volume-beta|access-date=2021-05-01|website=ghostly.com|language=en}}</ref> and reprints of the ''Minecraft - Volume Alpha'' physical releases were also released. The ''Volume Beta'' releases consisted of a double CD edition of the album, a vinyl record which came in black and a red "fire" splatter color, and a limited edition of the vinyl pressed on a magenta translucent material<ref>{{Cite web|title=Minecraft - Volume Beta, by C418|url=https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-beta|access-date=2021-05-01|website=C418}}</ref> which was at first exclusive to [[Europe]] but was later re-pressed internationally.

Persson and Rosenfeld worked together again after ''Minecraft''{{'}}s success on the creation of a new game, titled ''[[0x10c|0x10<sup>c</sup>]].'' The game was never released, with Persson halting production indefinitely in August 2013. 

In 2014, Rosenfeld released an EP containing the music made for ''0x10<sup>c</sup>''. It was released digitally with little publicity; Rosenfeld simply sent out a [[Twitter|tweet]] stating that it was available.<ref name="PC Gamer">Andy Chalk, [http://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-composer-releases-0x10c-tracks-muses-on-notchs-departure-from-mojang/ Minecraft composer releases 0x10c tracks, muses on Notch's departure from Mojang] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023172300/http://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-composer-releases-0x10c-tracks-muses-on-notchs-departure-from-mojang/ |date=23 October 2019 }}, PC Gamer, 17 September 2014.</ref>

In 2015, Rosenfeld released ''148'', which much like ''72 Minutes of Fame'' carried a significant amount of personal content, albeit slightly more hidden under lyrics and effects.<ref>{{Cite news|title=148|language=en-US|work=C418|url=https://c418.org/albums/148/|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107024906/https://c418.org/albums/148/|archive-date=7 November 2017}}</ref> 

Later that year, ''Minecraft - Volume Alpha'' soundtrack was released on a physical format on [[Ghostly International]].<ref name="ghostly.com" /> This release consisted of a regular CD edition of the album, a vinyl edition which came with a code for a digital copy of the album, and a limited edition of the album pressed on green translucent vinyl.<ref>{{cite web|title=C418 Bandcamp|url=https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726000924/https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/minecraft-volume-alpha|archive-date=26 July 2018|access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref>

In the same year, Rosenfeld hinted at a potential upcoming third album for ''Minecraft''{{'s}} soundtrack, stating "I'll still work on Minecraft, so there’ll probably be another album".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.factmag.com/2015/09/05/minecraft-c418-interview/ |title=Can You Dig It: FACT meets Minecraft composer C418 |last=Fenwick |first=Tom |date=September 5, 2015 |publisher=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact magazine]] |access-date=March 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224011657/https://www.factmag.com/2015/09/05/minecraft-c418-interview/ |archive-date=February 24, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, Rosenfeld confirmed the future release, claiming the album is "still far from done".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/C418/status/829667788897783809 |title=Daniel on Twitter: 'I’m still far from done, but I tallied up a few numbers, and the third Minecraft soundtrack is gonna be longer than Alpha and Beta combined.' |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date=February 9, 2017|access-date=March 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308183610/https://twitter.com/C418/status/829667788897783809 |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 2016–2021: ''2 Years of Failure'', ''Excursions'', and further independent music ===

Rosenfeld released ''2 Years of Failure'' in 2016, a Bandcamp exclusive compilation album of music made for failed projects or songs that could not fit anywhere else.<ref name="2yrs">{{Cite web|title=2 years of failure|url=https://c418.org/albums/2-years-of-failure/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520061512/https://c418.org/albums/2-years-of-failure/|archive-date=20 May 2019|access-date=2019-01-14|work=C418|language=en-US}}</ref> Several songs in this album were made for an abandoned game Rosenfeld described as having a "...Japanese puzzle exchange..." vibe. This album also contains the original soundtrack for Crayon Physics.<ref name="2yrs" /> Most notably, this album contains C418's remix of the [[Stranger Things]] theme song, which had staggering popularity in 2018. It was the most played song on Rosenfeld's personal [[SoundCloud]] page until it was removed<ref>{{Cite web|title=u/SkyPG24 on r/C418 - Reddit|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/C418/comments/hu59wj/hey_err_what_happened_to_c418s_soundcloud_and_why/fym0par|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-14|website=reddit|language=en-US}}</ref> along with several other tracks due to a lapsed SoundCloud Pro subscription.<ref>{{Cite web|title=C418|url=https://www.soundcloud.com/C418|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508135548/https://soundcloud.com/c418|archive-date=8 May 2019|access-date=15 January 2019|website=Soundcloud}}</ref>

After the "Update Aquatic" update of 2018, three new songs were added to the game as underwater music.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Music|url=https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Music|access-date=2020-08-27|website=Minecraft Wiki|language=en|archive-date=14 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814042157/https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Music|url-status=live}}</ref> These songs – "Dragon Fish", "Shuniji", "Axolotl" – were released by Rosenfeld respectively on August 9, November 10, and December 12, 2018, on [[Spotify]] as singles. All of them are to be included in the third album.
