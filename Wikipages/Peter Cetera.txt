===History===
====Tenure in Chicago====
In December 1967, Cetera arrived early for a show to watch a band called The Big Thing. Impressed by their use of a [[horn section]] combined with rock and roll, Cetera left The Exceptions to join The Big Thing within two weeks.<ref name= Ruhlmannp1/> The Big Thing, which soon changed its name to The Chicago Transit Authority (and eventually shortened it to [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]), released its self-titled debut album ''[[Chicago Transit Authority (album)|Chicago Transit Authority]]'' on [[Columbia Records]] in 1969. Cetera shared lead vocals on three of the eleven songs on the album: "Questions 67 & 68", "I'm a Man"<ref>{{cite album-notes |title=Chicago Group Portrait (Box Set) |year=1991 |url=http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Group_Portrait.html |work=aln3.albumlinernotes |access-date=July 4, 2018 |archive-date=December 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201229045301/http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Group_Portrait.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and "Someday",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://somethingelsereviews.com/2016/05/28/chicago-someday-chicago-transit-authority/ |title=Chicago, "Someday" (1969): Saturdays in the Park |last=Perplexio |date=May 28, 2016 |work=Something Else! |access-date=July 4, 2018 |archive-date=July 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704182818/http://somethingelsereviews.com/2016/05/28/chicago-someday-chicago-transit-authority/ |url-status=live }}</ref> his [[tenor]] voice complementing the [[baritone]] voices of the two other lead singers in the group, keyboardist [[Robert Lamm]] and guitarist [[Terry Kath]].

The follow-up album, ''[[Chicago (album)|Chicago]]'', vaulted the band to popular status throughout the world. The song "[[25 or 6 to 4]]" was the first major hit single with Cetera singing lead vocals. ''Chicago'' is also notable for featuring Cetera's first songwriting effort with the group, "Where Do We Go From Here?"<ref name=Ruhlmannp4>{{cite album-notes |title=Chicago Group Portrait (Box Set) |year=1991 |url=http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_4.html |page=4 |access-date=January 29, 2016 |first=William James |last=Ruhlmann |format=CD booklet archived online |publisher=Columbia Records |location=New York City |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20171112155002/http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_4.html |archive-date=November 12, 2017 }}</ref>

As the 1970s progressed Cetera became a more prolific songwriter for the group, contributing the songs "[[Wishing You Were Here]]" and "Happy Man" to the 1974 album ''[[Chicago VII]]''. "Wishing You Were Here" featured vocals by members of [[The Beach Boys]],<ref name=Ruhlmannp7>{{cite album-notes |title=Chicago Group Portrait (Box Set) |year=1991 |url=http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_7.html |page=7 |access-date=January 29, 2016|first= William James|last= Ruhlmann|format= CD booklet archived online |publisher=Columbia Records |location=New York City |url-status= live|archive-url= http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160129011030/http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_7.html|archive-date= January 29, 2016|df= mdy-all}}</ref> and reached number eleven on the charts.<ref name= ChicagoChartsHot100 /> "Happy Man" was, according to Chicago producer [[James William Guercio|James Guercio]], {{" '}}a Number 1 record that was never released as a single.{{' "}}<ref name= Ruhlmannp7 /> Cetera's biggest singing and songwriting accomplishment with Chicago came in 1976 with the ballad "[[If You Leave Me Now]]", from ''[[Chicago X]]''.

The song featured him on lead vocals and made it to number four on the record charts.<ref name= ChicagoChartsHot100 />

During this time Cetera also worked with other recording artists. He, along with a group of other well-known musicians, appears on the 1976 self-titled debut album by singer-songwriter Angelo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Angelo-Angelo/release/1995356 |title=Angelo (21) – Angelo |website=Discogs |language=en |access-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-date=December 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201229045340/https://www.discogs.com/Angelo-Angelo/release/1995356 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Can You Spot Angelo? |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Record-World/70s/76/RW-1976-06-12.pdf#page=19 |magazine=Record World| publisher=Bob Austin |page=15 (Full page advertisement for album) |date=June 12, 1976 |volume=32 |number=1512 |via=AmericanRadioHistory.com|access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Top Album Picks: First Time Around: Angelo |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1976/Billboard%201976-06-05.pdf#page=70 |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Lee Zhito |page=70 |date=June 5, 1976 |volume=88 |number=23 |via=AmericanRadioHistory.com |access-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-date=December 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201229045243/https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/70s/1976/Billboard%201976-06-05.pdf#page=70 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1977 Cetera provided background vocals on ''Beached'', an album by Ricci Martin (son of [[Dean Martin]]), which was produced by Ricci Martin's brother-in-law, [[Carl Wilson]] of the [[Beach Boys]].

By the end of the 1970s, with the rise of [[Disco|disco music]], Chicago's popularity declined, culminating in the release of the band's poorest-selling album to that point, ''[[Chicago XIV]]'', which peaked at number 71 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299102/chicago/chart?page=2&f=305|title=Chicago – Chart history Billboard 200 p3|magazine=Billboard|access-date=January 22, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202050217/http://www.billboard.com/artist/299102/chicago/chart?page=2&f=305|archive-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref> in 1980.

In 2018 on the [[AXS TV]] show, ''Top 10 Revealed'', he was rated as number nine of the show's top ten "high note hitters."<ref>{{cite episode |title=High Note Hitters |series=Top 10 Revealed |series-link=AXS TV|first=Katie (host) |last=Daryl |network=[[AXS TV]] |date=August 19, 2018 |season=1 |number=14 |language=En}}</ref>

Cetera's trademark singing style would develop as a result of having to sing for a period of time with a wired-shut jaw after getting into a brawl at a [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] game in 1969.<ref name="Seraphine" />{{rp|107–108}}<ref name=Ruhlmannp4/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-cetera-attacked-marines/|title=45 Years ago: Chicago's Peter Cetera Attacked by Marines|last1=Reiff|first1=Corbin|date=May 20, 2014|publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=January 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126042724/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-cetera-attacked-marines/|archive-date=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/chicago.html|title=Chicago|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=classicbands.com|publisher=classicbands.com|access-date=January 29, 2016|quote=Four marines didn't like a long-haired rock 'n' roller in a baseball park," Cetera recounts, "and of course I was a Cub fan, and I was in Dodger Stadium, and that didn't do so well.

The only funny thing I can think about the whole incident," he says, "is that, with my jaw wired together, I actually went on the road, and I was actually singing through my clenched jaw, which, to this day, is still the way I sing.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204030930/http://www.classicbands.com/chicago.html|archive-date=February 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Chicago Clobbered at Ball Game|date=June 28, 1969|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Straight Ahead Publishers|issue=36|location=San Francisco, California, USA|page=10}}</ref>

In 2009 an interviewer noted that Cetera had been around for four decades, called him "one of the most enduring singers around", and asked him how he takes care of his voice. Cetera responded: "'I don't smoke and I don't drink. I try to exercise as much as I can. I do warm-up vocal exercises regularly.'"<ref name="Lo2009"/>

For Cetera, recording the vocals with members of [[The Beach Boys]] for "[[Wishing You Were Here]]" from ''[[Chicago VII]]'' was satisfying on a personal level, according to William James Ruhlmann. He writes that Cetera said, {{" '}}There's two people that I always wanted to be, and that was a [[The Beatles|Beatle]] or a Beach Boy. …I got to do the background harmonies – myself and [[Carl Wilson]], [[Dennis Wilson]] and [[Al Jardine]]. For a night, I was a Beach Boy.{{' "}}<ref name="Ruhlmannp7" /> Cetera had the opportunity, of sorts, to be both a Beatle and a Beach Boy. During a radio interview in 2015, he recalled as one of the highlights of his life a joint concert of Chicago and The Beach Boys when the two groups, who were performing on stage together, were joined by former Beatles drummer [[Ringo Starr]] for a rendition of the Beatles song, "[[Got to Get You into My Life]]."<ref>{{cite interview |last=Cetera |first=Peter |subject-link=Peter Cetera |interviewer=Howard Glassman and Fred Patterson |title=Peter Cetera/September 28 |url=http://www.humbleandfredradio.com/listen-to-humble-and-fred/2015/09/peter-cetera-september-28.html |format=audio |work=Humble & Fred Radio.Com |publisher=Humble and Fred Radio |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |date=September 28, 2015 |time=1:07:04 |access-date=October 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804214429/http://www.humbleandfredradio.com/listen-to-humble-and-fred/2015/09/peter-cetera-september-28.html |archive-date=August 4, 2017 }}</ref>

====Recognition, popularity and influence as singer====
Cetera's former Chicago bandmates had high regard for his voice and singing ability.  In his autobiographical book, ''Street Player: My Chicago Story'', Danny Seraphine, the original drummer for the band Chicago, recollects that when the group was being formed in the city of Chicago in the 1960s it needed someone who could sing in the high range. Seraphine says Cetera was, at that time, "the best singer in the city."<ref name="Seraphine" />{{rp|58–59}} In a 1992 interview, seven years after Cetera had left the group, original band member and woodwinds player Walt Parazaider called Cetera, "one of the finest singers in the world" and rated Cetera among his choice of top five singers.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = [[Joe Mantegna|Mantegna, Joe]] (Host)| date = July 3, 1992 | title = [[ABC in Concert]] | medium = Television | publisher = [[American Broadcasting Company]] | quote = YouTube title: Chicago – the Peter Cetera Years (3:55 minutes in)}}</ref> In a 2009 interview, former Chicago member [[Bill Champlin]] said of Cetera, {{" '}}I think he's one of the major voices of our time.{{' "}}, and that he thought Cetera was one of, {{" '}}maybe the two best tenors on the Earth.{{' "}}<ref>{{Cite interview|last=Champlin|first=Bill|subject-link=Bill Champlin|interviewer=Wendell Neeley|url=http://addictedtovinyl.com/blog/2009/09/29/bill-champlin-the-atv-interview/|title=Bill Champlin:  The ATV Interview|date=September 9, 2009|website=Addicted To Vinyl|access-date=February 17, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919043541/http://addictedtovinyl.com/blog/2009/09/29/bill-champlin-the-atv-interview/|archive-date=September 19, 2016}}</ref> In a 2016 documentary about the history of the group, original band member and keyboard player Robert Lamm says, "There were and are a lot of tenor voices in rock, and none of them sound like Cetera."<ref name="Pardini documentary">{{cite AV media |people=Peter Pardini (Director) |year=2016 |title=Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago |medium=film documentary  |location=USA }}</ref>

The music recording industry has recognized Cetera for his singing with Grammy nominations. Five songs on which Cetera sang lead or shared lead vocals were nominated in pop vocal performance categories – "[[If You Leave Me Now]]", "[[Hard to Say I'm Sorry]]", "[[Hard Habit to Break]]", "[[Glory of Love]]", and "[[The Next Time I Fall]]", with "If You Leave Me Now" winning its category.<ref name=PCGrammys/>

Although Cetera has not had a song on the ''Billboard'' charts since the 1990s, songs he performed as a member of Chicago and as a solo act continue to pop up in the soundtracks of movies, television programs and commercials, and live stage plays. Cetera's composition from the 1976 album ''[[Chicago X]]'', "If You Leave Me Now" has appeared in the movies, ''[[Three Kings (1999 film)|Three Kings]]'' (1999),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://music.avclub.com/eleven-songs-in-search-of-a-soundtrack-1798211775|title=Eleven songs in search of a soundtrack|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=June 10, 2007|work=AV/Music|access-date=November 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720081312/https://music.avclub.com/eleven-songs-in-search-of-a-soundtrack-1798211775|archive-date=July 20, 2018|url-status=live|publisher=The A.

====Bass equipment and playing style====
Cetera, a mainly self-taught musician who started playing bass guitar during his teen-age years, has said he's not the most "knowledgeable" bass player, that he doesn't "really" read music, and that his knowledge of chords "[doesn't] go much past 'Is it major or minor?' "<ref name="Bass Player" /> He cites [[James Jamerson]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Andy Fraser]] among his bass influences and says that he was aware of [[John Entwistle]] and [[Jack Bruce]].<ref name="Bass Player" /> Writing for ''Bass Player'' magazine, Stevie Glasgow says, " ... Peter Cetera's bass (and vocals) were key to Chicago's sound. His tasty 4-string style was forged through a deep knowledge of early rock & roll and R&B, bolstered by a keen melodic sense, astute rhythmic prowess, and a dexterous technique capable of issuing graded nuance and fervent ''oomph'' in equal measure."<ref name="Glasgow">{{Cite journal|last=Glasgow|first=Stevie|date=September 7, 2018|title=Chicago's "What's This World Comin' To"|url=https://www.bassplayer.com/lessons/chicagos-whats-this-world-coming-to|url-status=live|journal=Bass Player|publisher=NewBay Media LLC|issue=September 2018|pages=56|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912022205/https://www.bassplayer.com/lessons/chicagos-whats-this-world-coming-to|archive-date=September 12, 2018}}</ref> [[Jeff Coffey]] gained a new respect for Cetera's bass lines when he took over as Chicago's bass player (2016–2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://somethingelsereviews.com/2018/03/28/jeff-coffey-chicago-interview/|title=Jeff Coffey, formerly of Chicago: Something Else!

Cetera's first bass guitar was a [[Danelectro Shorthorn]]. He switched to a [[Höfner 500/1]] to use with The Exceptions. When the Höfner sound was deemed not "bassy or ballsy" enough for Chicago, he replaced it with a 1963 [[Fender Precision Bass]]. The Fender became his favorite and it was his usual choice of instrument throughout his 17-year tenure with the band.<ref name="Bass Player"/><ref name="uberproaudio.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.uberproaudio.com/who-plays-what/178-peter-ceteras-bass-gear-rig-and-equipment-chicago|title=Peter Cetera's Bass Gear Rig and Equipment – Chicago|last=Administrator|website=uberproaudio.com|access-date=May 2, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909151640/http://www.uberproaudio.com/who-plays-what/178-peter-ceteras-bass-gear-rig-and-equipment-chicago|archive-date=September 9, 2017}}</ref>

====Recognition and influence as bass player====

About the process of writing songs, Cetera has said, {{" '}}I'm like the very bad student who only studies the day before a test! I only tend to write songs when I have a purpose – I need to know that I'm going to do a new album, and then I would start writing.

According to William James Ruhlmann, in 1969 the moon landing, [[Walter Cronkite]], and convalescence after having his jaw broken provided Cetera with the right mix of inspiration and available time for him to write his first song with Chicago, "Where Do We Go from Here", which was included on Chicago's second album. Up until that time he did not perceive himself as a songwriter, telling Ruhlmann, {{" '}}I came from a band that did Top 40 [The Exceptions], …and as far as I was concerned, especially when the Beatles came along, number one, all melodies had already been taken, and, number two, certain people were songwriters and certain people were singers, and I didn't consider myself to be a songwriter.{{' "}}<ref name=Ruhlmannp4 />

Cetera also tells Ruhlmann that songs can come to people in {{" '}}flashes,{{' "}} but without a recording device at hand they’re apt to {{" '}}disappear just exactly the way they come, into thin air.{{' "}} He says about the song, "Happy Man", from ''Chicago VII'': {{" '}}[It] was a song I wrote about midnight driving down the San Diego Freeway on my motorcycle, ...It was the one and only song that I ever remembered, words and music, and I went home and sang it into a tape a day later, and that's how that song came out.{{' "}}<ref name= Ruhlmannp7 />
