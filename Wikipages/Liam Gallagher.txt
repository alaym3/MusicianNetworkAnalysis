'''William John Paul Gallagher''' (born 21 September 1972) is an English singer and songwriter. He achieved fame as the lead singer and frontman of the rock band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] from 1991 to 2009, and later fronted the rock band [[Beady Eye]] from 2009 to 2014, before starting a solo career in 2017. Oasis had various line-up changes, though Gallagher and his older brother [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]] remained as the staple members.

Gallagher was interested in joining a band called The Rain, which they agreed to rename. It became Oasis, and they invited Noel to join them as the lead guitarist. The band's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994), was a critical and commercial success. Their second album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries, and their third studio album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. [[Britpop]] eventually declined in popularity and Oasis failed to revive it, though all of their subsequent albums topped the UK charts and their final two albums, ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' (2008) were hailed as being their best efforts in over a decade. In August 2009, following Noel's departure from Oasis, Gallagher and the remaining band members would go on to form Beady Eye, with whom he released two studio albums before they disbanded in 2014.

In 2017, Gallagher began his solo career with the release of his debut solo album, ''[[As You Were (Liam Gallagher album)|As You Were]]'' (2017), which proved to be a critical and commercial success. It topped the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-fastest-selling-debut-albums-of-the-decade-so-far__18207/|title=The fastest-selling debut albums of the decade so far|publisher=Official Charts Company|access-date=14 October 2017|archive-date=6 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206034422/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-fastest-selling-debut-albums-of-the-decade-so-far__18207/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2018, the album was certified platinum with over 300,000 units sold in the UK.<ref name="BPI" /> His second album, ''[[Why Me? Why Not.|Why Me? Why Not]]'', received mostly positive reviews and topped the UK charts upon its release in September 2019. This made it his tenth chart-topping album including eight with Oasis, and it also became the fastest-selling vinyl of 2019.<ref>{{cite news |title=Liam Gallagher scores second solo Number 1 album, fastest-selling vinyl album of 2019: "Now that's what I call biblical!" |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/liam-gallagher-scores-second-solo-number-1-album-fastest-selling-vinyl-album-of-2019-now-that-s-what-i-call-biblical-__27351/ |access-date=28 September 2019 |agency=Official Charts Company |archive-date=26 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191226213359/https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/liam-gallagher-scores-second-solo-number-1-album-fastest-selling-vinyl-album-of-2019-now-that-s-what-i-call-biblical-__27351/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

One of the most recognisable figures in music, Gallagher is noted for his distinctive singing style and his outspoken, brash, and abrasive personality. His attitude during Oasis' commercial peak in the mid-1990s garnered much attention from the British [[tabloid press|tabloids]], which often ran stories concerning his drug use and destructive behaviour. In March 2010, he was voted the greatest frontman of all time in a reader poll by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine.<ref name=":1" /> In 2019, he received the [[MTV Europe Music Award]] for "Rock Icon".

==Early life==
William John Paul Gallagher was born in the [[Longsight]] area of [[Manchester]] on 21 September 1972, the son of Irish immigrant parents Peggy and Thomas Gallagher. The family later moved to the city's [[Burnage]] area. Liam was physically abused by his father as a child, although not as badly as his older brothers Paul and [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]] were. He has said that the abuse affected him deeply and inspired him to become an artist.<ref name="abuseartist">{{cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/gallagher%20abuse%20made%20me%20a%20better%20artist_1051199|title=Gallagher: 'Abuse Made Me a Better Artist'|work=[[Contact Music]]|access-date=15 December 2007|date=23 November 2007|archive-date=14 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214085625/http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/gallagher%20abuse%20made%20me%20a%20better%20artist_1051199|url-status=live}}</ref> When he was 10, Peggy took him and his brothers and left Thomas, whom she divorced four years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopcryingyourheartoutnews.blogspot.com.au/2006/07/liam-noels-secret-oa-sis.html |title=Liam & Noel's Secret Oa-sis |access-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406194410/http://stopcryingyourheartoutnews.blogspot.com.au/2006/07/liam-noels-secret-oa-sis.html |archive-date=6 April 2016}}</ref> Although Liam maintained sporadic contact with his father throughout his teens, their issues remain unresolved; notably, while drinking at a pub after an [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] show in Ireland during the height of their fame, Liam noticed his father from across the room and had to be calmed down by Noel. A leaked phone call later revealed that he subsequently called his father and threatened to break his legs if he ever saw him again.<ref name=":0">''[[Oasis: Supersonic]]'' (2016)</ref> The Gallagher brothers were troubled, especially in their mid-teens, and Liam often shoplifted bicycles from local shops.

Gallagher attended St. Bernard's RC Primary School and the [[The Barlow Roman Catholic High School|Barlow Roman Catholic High School]] in [[Didsbury]]. Despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, he was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term and gained four [[GCSEs]] in 1990.<ref name="brothers">Gallagher, Paul & Terry Christian. Brothers: From Childhood to Oasis.

==Career==
===Oasis (1991–2009)===
{{main|Oasis (band)}}
[[File:Oasis Noel and Liam WF.jpg|thumb|right|The Gallagher brothers performing with Oasis in September 2005]]
When school friend [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan]] invited Gallagher to join his band The Rain as a vocalist, he agreed. He was the band's co-songwriter, along with guitarist [[Paul Arthurs|Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs]]. Noel has since openly mocked this writing partnership, describing them as being "just awful", and Liam also admitted that they were "shit".<ref name="behind"/> The band only rehearsed once a week and did not get many gigs. It was at one of their rare shows in 1991 at [[Boardwalk (music club)|the Boardwalk]] in Manchester that Noel, having recently returned from touring internationally as a roadie for  [[Inspiral Carpets]], saw them perform. In 1993, Oasis played a four-song set at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] in [[Glasgow]], where [[Alan McGee]] of [[Creation Records]] discovered them and signed them for a six-album deal. The band's debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' was released on 28 August 1994, and went on to become the fastest-selling British debut album of all time. Liam was praised for his vocal contributions to the album, and his presence made Oasis a popular live act. Critics cited influences from [[the Beatles]] and [[Sex Pistols]]. Liam's attitude garnered attention from the British [[tabloid press]], which often ran stories concerning his alleged drug use and behaviour. In 1997, ''Definitely Maybe'' was named the 14th greatest album of all time in a "Music of the Millennium" poll conducted by [[HMV]].<ref>"[http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/channel4.htm Channel 4/HMV best music of this millennium] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222821/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/channel4.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}".

The differing styles of the bands now leading the Britpop movement—Oasis a working-class northern band, and Blur a middle-class southern band—made the media perceive them as natural rivals. In August 1995, Blur and Oasis released new singles on the same day; Blur's "[[Country House (song)|Country House]]" outsold Oasis' "[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll with It]]" by 58,000 copies during the week.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/indie/blur-vs-oasis/|title=Blur and Oasis singles sales|work=[[Seven Ages of Rock]]|publisher=BBC|access-date=3 October 2011|archive-date=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404125710/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/indie/blur-vs-oasis/|url-status=live}}</ref> When the band mimed the single on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', Liam pretended to play Noel's guitar and Noel pretended to sing, taking a jibe at the show's lip-syncing format.

2008 saw the release of the band's final album ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'', which featured three Liam-written songs: "[[I'm Outta Time]]", "Ain't Got Nothin'", and "Soldier On".

In the UK, the album sold 90,000 copies on its first day of release, making it the second-fastest selling album of 2008, behind [[Coldplay]]'s ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends|Viva la Vida]]''. It debuted on the UK Albums Chart at No. 1 with first-week sales of 200,866 copies, making it the 51st fastest selling album ever in the UK.

The band's second studio album ''[[BE (Beady Eye album)|BE]]'' was released on 12 June 2013. It was recorded with [[Dave Sitek]] between November 2012 and March 2013. The band embarked on a corresponding tour playing a "secret gig" at Glastonbury. In contrast to his headlining spot with Oasis, Beady Eye featured as one of the first bands to open the festival. Gallagher stated it was a "refreshing" change. BE was not as successful in the United States as Gallagher and the rest of the band had hoped. This hindered their American popularity and it was announced there would be no tour dates scheduled for the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/be-mw0002543365|title=Be – Beady Eye {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=3 September 2018|archive-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903045859/https://www.allmusic.com/album/be-mw0002543365|url-status=live}}</ref> ''BE'' received a mixed critical reception.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/be/beady-eye|title=Metacritic – Beady Eye|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=23 November 2013|archive-date=24 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124151750/http://www.metacritic.com/music/be/beady-eye|url-status=live}}</ref> Many positive reviews complimented the band's progression from their debut album, while negative reviews criticised the album's lyrics and production.

Simon Harper of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' magazine said, "Shades of light and dark ripple throughout and keep the listener guessing... (On 'Soul Love') Liam Gallagher's cosmic vibe is matched by the first distinct stamp of producer David Sitek's ambient adventuring, which commandeers the second-half of the song, letting it drift dreamily skywards.

==Controversies==
With the appearance of Oasis on the music scene in 1994, Gallagher quickly made a public name for himself with his "loutish" behaviour.<ref name="banned"/> By 2000, his reputation and confrontational persona saw him feature in a [[Channel 4]] documentary ''Hellraisers'' along with actors [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Oliver Reed]] and [[Richard Harris]] and musicians [[Keith Moon]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]].<ref>"Hellraisers". Channel 4. 2000. Retrieved 7 May 2020.</ref>

After an argument on a flight to [[Australia]] in 1998 that apparently involved a [[scone]], Gallagher was banned for life from [[Cathay Pacific]] airlines; he responded that he would "rather walk".<ref name="banned">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/64844.stm|title=Oasis singer banned by airline|work=BBC News|date=12 March 1998|access-date=12 March 2015|archive-date=17 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817012633/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/64844.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDYPxl8IdLo|title=Liam Gallagher – I'd Rather Walk|publisher=YouTube|date=24 November 2007|access-date=3 October 2011|archive-date=23 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523202934/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDYPxl8IdLo|url-status=live}}</ref> During the band's Australian tour at the time, he was arrested and charged with assault after allegedly headbutting a 19-year-old fan who claimed he was only asking Gallagher for a photo.

On an early U.S. tour, Gallagher made derogatory remarks about Americans, as well as his brother Noel, which led to an ultimatum from the latter, who briefly left the band in 1994. When addressing their muted reception in the U.S. (especially in comparison with their home country), Gallagher said, "Americans want [[Grunge|grungy]] people, stabbing themselves in the head on stage. They get a bright bunch like us, with deodorant on, they don't get it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-o/oasis_main.htm|title=Oasis|work=Rock on the Net|access-date=3 October 2011|archive-date=12 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612124140/http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-o/oasis_main.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

On receiving an award at the [[2010 Brit Awards]] for the best album of the past 30 years, Gallagher swore while he thanked all the former members of Oasis except for his brother. He then dropped the microphone and gave the award to a member of the crowd.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gallagher |first1=Liam |title=Oasis win BRITs Album of 30 Years presented by Noddy Holder {{!}} BRIT Awards 2010 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vLeDzvd3cw |website=YouTube |access-date=16 August 2018 |date=26 November 2012 |archive-date=20 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220043956/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vLeDzvd3cw |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Musical style==
[[File:2017 RiP - Liam Gallagher - by 2eight - 8SC1562.jpg|upright|thumb|Gallagher's singing pose, with his arms behind his back and head arched up towards the microphone]]
Gallagher's voice has been compared to a blend of [[John Lennon]] and [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]]. He has stated he has no clear influence other than Lennon and "music" itself, though he has been known to incorporate many different forms such as punk, indie, new wave, and jazz.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Albums of the 90's| magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|page=78|issue=260|date=March 2008|quote=Most British Moment: Gallagher's brilliantly untutored drawl – one part John Lennon, one part John Lydon.}}</ref> On his singing, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine states that he "twists vowels to the stretching point Johnny Rotten-style — 'sun-shee-ine'".<ref>{{cite news |title=Classic Reviews: Oasis '(What's the Story) Morning Glory' and Blur's 'The Great Escape' |url=https://www.spin.com/2015/10/reviews-oasis-whats-the-story-morning-glory-blur-the-great-escape-1995/ |access-date=17 September 2019 |work=Spin magazine |archive-date=30 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730093850/https://www.spin.com/2015/10/reviews-oasis-whats-the-story-morning-glory-blur-the-great-escape-1995/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On the ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' DVD, Gallagher revealed that the reason he sings with his arms behind his back is because it allows him to project more power through his voice.

In 2017, Gallagher admitted that had it not been for pop singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], he would have never entered the music industry. Recalling a childhood anecdote, he said he was "blown away" the first time he heard her song "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/music/news/madonna-inspired-liam-gallagher-to-become-a-musician/articleshow/60321286.cms |title=Madonna inspired Liam Gallagher to become a musician |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=1 September 2017 |access-date=13 February 2018 |archive-date=15 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215222220/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/music/news/madonna-inspired-liam-gallagher-to-become-a-musician/articleshow/60321286.cms |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Relationship with Noel Gallagher===
During Oasis's American tour in 1994, Liam frequently changed the words of Noel's songs so that they were offensive to both Americans and Noel. In September 1994, Oasis played at [[Whisky a Go Go]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The day of the show Oasis had been using [[methamphetamine]] that they believed was [[cocaine]]. The band made several mistakes and tensions arose on stage between Liam and Noel, eventually leading to Liam hitting Noel in the head with his tambourine. After the show, Noel shortly left the tour and went to [[San Francisco]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-01-03|title=The worst Oasis gig ever: Crystal meth at The Whisky-A-Go-Go in 1994|url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/oasis-liam-gallagher-noel-gallagher-whisky-a-go-go-1994-la/|access-date=2020-07-13|website=[[Far Out Magazine]]|archive-date=13 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200713121136/https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/oasis-liam-gallagher-noel-gallagher-whisky-a-go-go-1994-la/|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the 1995 recording sessions for ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', the brothers had a fight when Liam invited everyone from a local pub back to the studio while Noel was trying to work, culminating in Noel hitting Liam over the head with a cricket bat. Noel later described this event as "possibly the biggest fight we ever had".<ref>''Definitely Maybe'' DVD Interview.</ref><ref name=":0" />

In August 1996, after a record-breaking [[Concerts at Knebworth House|pair of shows at Knebworth]], tension mounted between the Gallaghers when Liam backed out of Oasis's ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' set minutes before it was due to start. Noel was forced to fill in at the last minute. Liam said that he had been struck down with a "sore throat" and that he does not like performing acoustically, though Noel has claimed he was [[Hangover|hungover]].<ref>Noel Interview on ''MTV Unplugged – Behind The Scenes''</ref>  Noel was further angered when Liam heckled him from the balcony while the band performed.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJSJ7ZQshrI&feature=youtu.be&t=236 |title=BBC 2 Zoe Ball Breakfast Show |access-date=13 July 2020 |archive-date=13 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200713122543/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJSJ7ZQshrI&feature=youtu.be&t=236 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJanARjwq6g |title=The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X |access-date=13 July 2020 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801000102/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJanARjwq6g |url-status=live }}</ref> Four days after, Noel was again forced to fill in for Liam on the first show of their American tour, when Liam refused to travel to America with the rest of the band claiming he needed time to buy a house. He was back on stage with Oasis for their next show three days later in [[Detroit]]. Tension between Noel and the rest of the band mounted and Noel left the tour, causing several media outlets to question the future of the band.

While on tour in [[Barcelona]] in May 2000, Oasis were forced to cancel a show when drummer Alan White's arm seized up; the band spent the evening drinking instead. During the night Liam made a crude remark about Noel's wife, Meg Mathews (apparently questioning the legitimacy of Noel's baby daughter Anais), leading to a fight.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher/|title=Born to feud: how years of animosity finally split Oasis boys|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=30 August 2009|access-date=28 November 2011|location=London|first=Gareth|last=Grundy|archive-date=2 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002210036/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher|url-status=live}}</ref> Following this, a press release was put out declaring that Noel had decided to quit overseas touring with Oasis.

In 2009, prior to the group's break, Noel characterized Liam as "rude, arrogant, intimidating and lazy. He's the angriest man you'll ever meet. He's like a man with a fork in a world of soup".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.qthemusic.com/2009/04/noel_no_new_oasis_album_for_fi.html|title=Noel: no new Oasis album for five years?|publisher=Bauer Media Group|work=[[Q (magazine)|qthemusic.com]]|access-date=9 March 2012|date=21 April 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130190718/http://news.qthemusic.com/2009/04/noel_no_new_oasis_album_for_fi.html|archive-date=30 January 2013}}</ref> The final straw for the band came at [[Rock En Seine]] in [[Paris]], when an altercation between the brothers (subsequently described by Noel as "no physical violence but there was a lot of [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] stuff") prior to their performance resulted in the destruction of Noel's guitar and saw him announce his departure from the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/noel-gallagher/57811|title=Noel Gallagher on Oasis split: 'Liam nearly took my face off with a guitar'|work=NME|date=6 July 2011|access-date=9 March 2012|archive-date=15 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315065934/http://www.nme.com/news/noel-gallagher/57811|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="paris">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/6128065/Oasis-v-the-Beatles-we-wont-look-back-in-wonder.html|title=Oasis v the Beatles: we won't look back in wonder|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=2 September 2009|access-date=9 March 2012|location=London|first=Neil|last=McCormick|archive-date=2 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302154629/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/6128065/Oasis-v-the-Beatles-we-wont-look-back-in-wonder.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Liam later claimed he "messed the first one up" when questioned about his 2019 MTV Unplugged performance and has since claimed he missed the show because he "accidentally got drunk again".<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" />

Liam has stated he does not speak much with Noel and that they "don't really have a relationship".
