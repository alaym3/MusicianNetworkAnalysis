=== ''Eternal Endless Infinity'' and lineup changes (2000–2004) ===

Fascinated by the myth of [[Atlantis]], Werner Fiedler, Thomas Caser, Christian Stani, and Chris Kamper decided in August 2000 to work out a concept inspired by the secret of Atlantis. Late in summer mezzo-soprano Nicole Bogner joined the project, and this was the birth of Visions of Atlantis. A first demo, ''Morning in Atlantis'' was released in 2000.

In 2001 they signed with TTS Media Music/Black Arrow Productions, and in 2002 their first album, ''[[Eternal Endless Infinity]]'' was released.

In 2003, the band saw some changes in lineup, replacing Christian Stani with Mario Plank and Chris Kamper with Miro Holly.

=== ''Cast Away'' and Nicole's departure (2004–2005) ===
Now with [[Napalm Records]], which released the band's second studio effort "Cast Away" worldwide in November 2004. To mark the release, Visions of Atlantis produced their first official music video to the track "Lost", which received significant airplay on VIVA and MTV, and made it possible for the band to present the album. In early 2005, Visions of Atlantis did their tour across Europe, while being supported by labelmates [[Elis (band)|Elis]] and [[Celtic rock]] based band [[Lyriel]].

In late 2005, Bogner left the band due to commitments elsewhere.

=== New singer and third studio album (2005–2007) ===
After Nicole left the band, she was replaced by American [[soprano]] singer [[Melissa Ferlaak]] (formerly with [[Aesma Daeva (band)|Aesma Daeva]]) and Wolfgang Koch replaced Werner Fiedler. In 2006, Martin Harb, who already played with VoA on their tour in Mexico in 2003, replaced Miro Holly. In May 2007, VoA released their 3rd album ''[[Trinity (Visions of Atlantis album)|Trinity]]'', mastered at [[Finnvox Studios]] and recorded at Bavarian Dreamscape Studio<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionsofatlantis.com/english/disc.htm |title=Visions Of Atlantis discography |access-date=27 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610082744/http://www.visionsofatlantis.com/english/disc.htm |archive-date=10 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>). The following autumn brought Visions of Atlantis to the United States, where the band toured together with [[Epica (band)|Epica]] for 6 weeks and won numerous new fans.

=== Departure of Melissa Ferlaak and Wolfgang Koch (2007–2008) ===
Upon returning, the band went through changes in the lineup. On 28 November 2007, a message was posted on the official VoA website saying that Melissa Ferlaak and Wolfgang Koch had left the band, both citing personal reasons. Following this Visions of Atlantis announced a few days later that their ex guitarist, Werner Fiedler, had rejoined the band.

=== Joanna Nieniewska and Maxi Nil (2008–2009) ===
After Melissa's departure, Visions of Atlantis not only looked for a replacement for a singer, but also wrote the material for the fourth album. The band advertised on their website the position for a female vocalist for several months, and on 3 September 2008, they finally announced that they had found a new female singer; however, her identity was not revealed until 1 February 2009, as the 20-year-old Austrian soprano vocalist Joanna Nieniewska.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=8125|title=Visions Of Atlantis – New Female Singer Announced – Metal Storm|website=metalstorm.net}}</ref>

On 29 July 2009, VoA announced that because of health problems, Joanna Nieniewska is no longer in the band but will continue to support VoA behind the scenes.

The band announced the replacement vocalist, [[Maxi Nil]] from Greece, and was also known for her work with [[On Thorns I Lay]], guest with [[Moonspell]] and her former band [[Elysion (band)|Elysion]].

=== ''Delta'' and ''Maria Magdalena'' EP (2010–2011) ===
On 3 December 2010, VoA announced the new title of their 4th studio album ''[[Delta (Visions of Atlantis album)|Delta]]'' which was released on 25 February 2011 worldwide.

On 18 July 2011, bass player Mario Lochert left the band due to crucial internal differences. In a recent interview Harb said that the band is not planning on replacing him. Instead, they will continue without a bassist as a fixed band member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-trails.com/interviews/visions-of-atlantis/martin-harb/2011-08-04.html | title=Metal-Trails.com: Interview mit Martin Harb from August 4th 2011 at the Wacken Open Air 2011 | date=26 August 2011}}</ref>

In August 2011, the band announced the title of their first EP ''Maria Magdalena''. It was released on 21 October 2011.

=== Death of Nicole Bogner and ''Ethera'' (2012–2013) ===
On 6 January 2012, Visions of Atlantis announced on their Facebook and MySpace pages that former singer Nicole Bogner had died at the [[27 Club|age of 27]] after suffering from a severe disease over a long period of time. The band said that they were saddened to have lost their first vocalist, and expressed their gratitude to Bogner for her time with the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=75767 | title=Former Visions Of Atlantis Singer Nicole Bogner Passes Away}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2012.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] – accessed 8 January 2012</ref>

On 27 January 2012, the band announced the title ''[[Ethera]]'' for their upcoming album, which was scheduled to be released in 2012. ''Ethera'' was released on 22 March 2013. It was the first album with guitarist Christian Hermsdörfer and with no official bassist. It was dedicated to Bogner's memory.

=== Lineup changes and ''The Deep & the Dark'' (2013–2019) ===

On 6 December 2013, Visions of Atlantis announced on their Facebook page that most of the lineup was parting ways with Visions of Atlantis, leaving the only remaining and founding member Thomas Caser on drums. This decision was mostly because of a desire from the parting members to play their own style of music, whilst the band was orientating to go back to its classic style. Thus, it welcomed back some of its old members: Werner Fiedler (guitars), Chris Kamper (synths), and Michael Koren (bass). [[Maxi Nil]] was replaced by [[Clémentine Delauney]], and Mario Plank by Siegfried Samer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/visions-of-atlantis-announces-new-lineup/ | title=Visions Of Atlantis Announces New Lineup|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=11 January 2014}}</ref> Michael Koren was replaced by Herbert Glos on bass in late 2017, and Werner Fiedler by Christian Douscha at the same time. Chris Kamper left the band in 2015.

Their new album ''[[The Deep & the Dark]]'' was released on 16 February 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/visions-of-atlantis-to-release-the-deep-the-dark-album-in-february/|title=VISIONS OF ATLANTIS To Release 'The Deep & The Dark' Album In February|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=1 December 2017|access-date=16 February 2018}}</ref>

=== ''Wanderers'' (2019) ===
After extensive tours with Serenity and Kamelot as well as several festival shows in 2018, the band released their first live album ''The Deep & the Dark Live @ Symphonic Metal Nights'' on 16 February 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/visions-of-atlantis-to-release-the-deep-the-dark-live-symphonic-metal-nights-in-february/|title=VISIONS OF ATLANTIS To Release 'The Deep & The Dark Live @ Symphonic Metal Nights' In February|date=29 November 2018|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref> which featured new male lead singer Michele Guaitoli (from Italian symphonic metal band [[Temperance (Italian band)|Temperance]]) sharing lead vocal duty with Siegfried Samer, the former having permanently replaced the latter at the end of the Symphonic Metal Nights IV tour in late 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://femmezin.com/line-up-change-in-visions-of-atlantis/|title=Line-up change in Visions of Atlantis|date=30 October 2018|website=Femmezin}}</ref>

The band then announced on 1 July 2019 that their seventh album ''Wanderers'' will be released on 30 August 2019 via Napalm Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhard.de/artikel/visions-of-atlantis-wanderers-album-erscheint-ende-august_460232.html|title=VISIONS OF ATLANTIS: "Wanderers"-Album erscheint Ende August|website=ROCK HARD Heavy-Metal-Magazin}}</ref> The album again featured Clémentine Delauney and Michele Guaitoli sharing lead vocal duties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/visions-of-atlantis-vocalist-says-next-studio-album-will-be-continuation-of-the-deep-the-dark/|title=VISIONS OF ATLANTIS Vocalist Says Next Studio Album Will Be 'Continuation' Of 'The Deep & The Dark'|date=25 February 2019|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref>
