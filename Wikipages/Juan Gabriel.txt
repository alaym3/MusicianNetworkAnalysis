===BMG copyright dispute===
Between 1986 and 1994, Juan Gabriel refused to record any material because of a dispute with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] over [[copyrights]] to his songs. He continued his career in live stage performances, setting attendance records throughout [[Latin America]]. By 1994 the copyright dispute reached a resolution under an agreement whereby ownership of the songs reverted to Juan Gabriel over a specified time period.<ref name=enotes/> After this dispute, which lasted 8 years, he released an album titled, "[[Gracias por Esperar|Gracias Por Esperar]]," which in English, translates to, "Thank You For Waiting". The record label then selected eleven previously released tracks from Juan Gabriel's catalog in order to release "[[Debo Hacerlo (song)|Debo Hacerlo]]", the last new song recorded by the artist.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
