'''Yasmine Hamdan''' ({{lang-ar|ياسمين حمدان}}; born 1976) is a Lebanese singer, songwriter and actress, now based in [[Paris]]. She became known with [[Soapkills]], the duo she founded with [[Zeid Hamdan]] (no relation) while she was still living in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The first album released by Soapkills was  ''Bater'' (1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://farklimuzik.com/yasmine-hamdan |title=Yasmine Hamdan - Farklı Müzik |publisher=Farklimuzik.com |access-date=2013-05-26}}</ref> Soapkills was one of the first independent electronic bands in the [[Middle East]], and its innovative approach exerted a lasting influence. To this day, Yasmine Hamdan is considered an icon of underground music across the [[Arab world]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstoneme.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=907 |title=Yasmine Hamdan Collaborates With Marc Collin |publisher=Rollingstoneme.com |date=2011-12-07 |access-date=2013-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/arts/13iht-hamdan13.html|title=Arabic Music's Modern Voice|date=13 April 2012|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

After moving to Paris, Hamdan collaborated with [[CocoRosie]]. She teamed up with [[Mirwais Ahmadzaï|Mirwais]] (who was part of French electronic new wave band [[Taxi Girl]] in the 80s, and produced/co-wrote some of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s albums),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/arts/13iht-hamdan13.html|title=Arabic Music's Modern Voice|last=Mulholland|first=Tara|date=2012-04-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> with whom she recorded the ''Arabology'' album (2008), under the [[Y.A.S.]] moniker.

Hamdan then joined forces with [[Marc Collin]] (of [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]]) to write and produce her first, self-titled solo album, which came out in [[France]] and Lebanon in 2012 on [[Kwaidan Records]]), and was released internationally (in a revised version with five new tracks) in 2013 by [[Crammed Discs]] under the title ''Ya Nass''. In this album, which blends pop, folk and electronic sounds with melodies and lyrics inspired by various Middle-Eastern traditions, Hamdan "has undertaken the challenge of affirming and rewriting Arabic musical heritage", according to the Al-Akhbar paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/6720 |title=Yasmine Hamdan: Musical Tradition With an Attitude |publisher=Al Akhbar English |date=2012-04-27 |access-date=2013-05-26}}</ref> Her personal life (she has lived in Lebanon, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Greece and France) and her curiosity have enabled Hamdan to playfully use various dialects of Arabic in her lyrics, which alternate between [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese]], [[Kuwaiti Arabic|Kuwaiti]], [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]], [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] and [[Bedouin]], as well as some of the code-switching which is so typical of Middle-Eastern humour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondomix.com/fr/news/lecon-de-geographie-interieure-avec-yasmine-hamdan |title=Leçon de géographie intérieure avec Yasmine Hamdan |website=Mondomix.com |date=2012-06-18 |access-date=2013-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Par Marie Ottavi |url=http://next.liberation.fr/musique/2012/05/21/yasmine-hamdan-l-envol-pop_819662 |title=Yasmine Hamdan, l'envol pop Next |publisher=Next.liberation.fr |date=2012-05-21 |access-date=2013-05-26}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120516004541/http://www.brownbook.me/yasmine-hamdan/]</ref>

Hamdan had a cameo in Jim Jarmusch's film<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reorientmag.com/2013/01/yasmine-hamdan/|title=REORIENT - Middle Eastern Arts and Culture Magazine|website=Reorientmag.com}}</ref> ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' alongside [[Tilda Swinton]] and [[Tom Hiddleston]]. She has written an original soundtrack for the [[theatre]] play ''Rituel pour une métamorphose'' by [[Syria]]n playwright [[Saadallah Wannous]] for a production at [[Comédie Française]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedie-francaise.fr/spectacle-comedie-francaise.php?id=517&spid=373&p=1|title=Rituel pour une métamorphose|website=Comedie-francaise.fr}}</ref>

Entitled ''Al Jamilat'' ('The Beautiful Ones'), Yasmine Hamdan's second solo album came out in 2017. Recorded in Beirut, Paris and London, it was produced by herself, co-produced by [[Leo Abrahams]] and [[Luke Smith (session musician)|Luke Smith]], and features performances by [[Shahzad Ismaily]], [[Steve Shelley]] and more. An album of reworks by the likes of [[Acid Arab]], [[Matias Aguayo]], [[Brandt Brauer Frick]] and several others came out in 2018 (''Jamilat Reprise'').

Yasmine Hamdan is married to the Palestinian film director and actor [[Elia Suleiman]] and lives in Paris.<ref name="national">{{cite news|last1=Saad|first1=Shirine|title=Childhood wanderings influence Yasmine Hamdan's third album|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/childhood-wanderings-influence-yasmine-hamdans-third-album#full|access-date=25 March 2016|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=3 August 2013}}</ref>
