This album also represents the artist's first independent release following his release from the Machete Crew, which occurred due to different visions on a musical level.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-10-13|title=Il rap di En?gma oltre Machete si tinge di Indaco|url=https://www.lastampa.it/spettacoli/musica/2016/10/13/news/il-rap-di-en-gma-oltre-machete-si-tinge-di-indaco-1.34786868|access-date=2021-01-16|website=lastampa.it|language=it-IT}}</ref> The real reason for the exit is still unknown, but Enigma's former colleague and friend [[Hell Raton]], notable Sardinian rapper with Ecuadorian origins, said this in an interview with Rockit in 2019:<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-07-31|title=Perché En?gma ha lasciato Machete?|url=https://www.rebelmag.it/2019/07/31/perche-engma-ha-lasciato-machete/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Rebel Mag|language=it-IT}}</ref>

{{Blockquote|text=“I no longer have relations with En?gma, I don't think I would be able to go on stage with him again. People often ask us questions about him, some even insult us, but do you know why?

The discussion between Enigma and the Machete Crew its still active today: in fact, to celebrate the 10 years of the crew in 2020 many artists among which [[Jack the Smoker|Jack The Smoker]], [[Nitro (rapper)|Nitro]] or [[Hell Raton]] himself shared photos or phrases to thank people that helped this project and to celebrate this event on their [[Instagram Stories]], but cutting the photos concerning Machete so that Enigma was not visible. Only the rapper [[Salmo (rapper)|Salmo]] posted a complete photo in which the Sardinian rapper was visible and he also wrote in another story without directly mentioning him: "THANKS TO WHO, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WAS PART OF THIS FAMILY. MACHETE ONE LOVE.".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-06|title=Machete festeggia 10 anni, ma qualcuno si è dimenticato di En?gma|url=https://www.rebelmag.it/2020/12/06/machete-festeggia-10-anni-ma-qualcuno-si-e-dimenticato-di-engma/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Rebel Mag|language=it-IT}}</ref>
