'''Randy''' is a Swedish [[punk rock]] band from [[Hortlax]], Sweden, formed in 1992. They were first inspired by skate punk bands like [[NOFX]] and [[Propagandhi]] but after the release of ''[[The Rest Is Silence (Randy album)|The Rest Is Silence]]'' and the departure of their bass player Patrik Trydvall, they radically changed their musical style and adopted an older sound reminiscent of [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]] and [[Ramones]], heavily leaning on a fusion of [[garage punk (fusion genre)|garage punk]] and [[pop punk]] to form their new sound. Their first album after the transition in style, ''[[You Can't Keep a Good Band Down]]'', earned praise from [[MaximumRockNRoll]], which called it "the best melodic punk CD since [[Bad Religion]]'s ''[[No Control (Bad Religion album)|No Control]]''."<ref name="Spotify-Bio">{{cite web |last1=Prato |first1=Greg |title=Randy |url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Qote9MpqMZluWzYGifZUg/about |website=Spotify |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref> After his departure, Patrik went on to contribute lead vocals in his now-disbanded punk rock group, Diefenbaker.<ref name="Diefenbaker-Interpunk">{{cite web |title='Los Muertos' by Diefenbaker |url=https://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=53168& |website=Interpunk |accessdate=6 April 2020 |date=1 January 2002}}</ref><ref name="Diefenbaker-Discogs">{{cite web |title=Diefenbaker - Discography - Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1259882-Diefenbaker |website=Discogs |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>

While never achieving mainstream success, Randy have developed a cult following in the punk community over the years and were particularly successful in their homeland. They were particularly well-known for writing catchy songs with politically conscious messages, often broaching topics like [[income inequality]], [[socialism]], [[Revolutionary socialism|working-class revolutions throughout European history]], and [[Karl Marx]] and [[Marxism]].<ref name="Tidal-Bio">{{cite web |title=Randy – Tidal |url=https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3517955 |website=Tidal |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="HumanAtomBombs-Review" /> The albums ''[[Welfare Problems]]'' and ''[[The Human Atom Bombs]]'', both released after the band's transition to garage-influenced punk, are especially well regarded by punk fans and music critics.<ref name="HumanAtomBombs-Review">{{cite web |last1=Greene |first1=Jo-Ann |title=Randy - The Human Atom Bombs |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-human-atom-bombs-mw0000005832 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=6 April 2020 |date=7 August 2001}}</ref><ref name="WelfareProblems-Review">{{cite web |last1=Loftus |first1=Johnny |title=Randy - Welfare Problems |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/welfare-problems-mw0000019884 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=6 April 2020 |date=6 May 2003}}</ref>

Randy were signed by [[Burning Heart Records]], a sub-label of [[Epitaph Records]], in the early 2000s. So far, they have released six studio albums. The latest album, ''[[Randy the Band]]'', was released in January 2006 on Burning Heart and [[Fat Wreck Chords]].<ref name="Spotify-Bio" />

==Recognition and accolades==
During the early to mid-2000s, music journalists often compared Randy to similar garage punk and garage rock bands, including fellow Swedish bands [[The Hives]] and [[The (International) Noise Conspiracy]].<ref name="Exclaim">{{cite web |last1=Ferraz |first1=Rob |title=Cheater by Randy |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/randy-cheater |website=Exclaim |accessdate=8 September 2020 |date=1 July 2002}}</ref><ref name="BedlamSociety">{{cite web |last1=O'Toole |first1=Chris |title=Read a Great Review of the Latest Randy Album |url=http://epitaph.com/news/article/read-a-great-review-of-the-latest-randy-album |website=Epitaph |accessdate=8 September 2020 |date=17 February 2004}}</ref><ref name="Spin">{{cite web |last1=Gaston |first1=Peter |title=Spotlight - Randy |url=https://www.spin.com/2006/01/randy/ |website=Spin |accessdate=8 September 2020 |date=6 January 2006}}</ref> In a review of Randy's fifth album ''[[Welfare Problems]]'', Chris O'Toole of the Bedlam Society identified Randy as "being the forefront of popularising the recent garage influenced Rock N' Roll revival." O'Toole also called Randy "one of the overshadowed acts" of that movement considering the relatively higher popularity of their peers.<ref name="BedlamSociety" />

In 2002, Randy were invited to perform at Club Debaser in [[Stockholm, Sweden|Stockholm]] to honor the memory of the recently-deceased [[Joe Strummer]] from [[The Clash]]. Other noteworthy bands and artists that performed at the event included [[Infinite Mass]], [[Weeping Willows]], and Dregen and Nicke Borg from [[Backyard Babies]].<ref name="ItsATrap-JoeStrummer">{{cite web |title=Joe Strummer Memorial Concert |url=http://www.itsatrap.com/n/19246 |website=It's a Trap!: Scandinavian Music Journal |accessdate=6 April 2020 |date=23 January 2003}}</ref>

In Sweden, Randy were nominated for the prestigious Golden Microphone award in 2004 for Best Live Act; they were nominated for the same by the independent Manifest Awards.<ref name="Spotify-Bio" /> They were also nominated for a Swedish Grammy for Best Rock Performance.<ref name="Tidal-Bio" /> In addition, their song "X-Ray Eyes," from ''Welfare Problems'', received moderate airplay in Sweden.<ref name="Spotify-Bio" />

In July 2020, the band's song "The Exorcist," featured on ''[[You Can't Keep a Good Band Down]]'', was featured on the [[British Broadcasting Company|BBC]]'s flagship film podcast, ''Kermode & Mayo's Film Review."<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-07-24|title=Kermode & Mayo's film review 200724|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000l300|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-30|website=BBC}}</ref>
