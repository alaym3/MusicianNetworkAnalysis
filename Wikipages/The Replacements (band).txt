'''The Replacements''' were an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], in 1979. Initially a [[punk rock]] band, they are one of the main pioneers of [[alternative rock]]. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist [[Paul Westerberg]], guitarist [[Bob Stinson]], bass guitarist [[Tommy Stinson]] and drummer [[Chris Mars]] for most of its existence. Following several acclaimed albums, including ''[[Let It Be (The Replacements album)|Let It Be]]'' and ''[[Tim (The Replacements album)|Tim]]'', Bob Stinson was kicked out of the band in 1986, and [[Slim Dunlap]] joined as lead guitarist. [[Steve Foley (drummer)|Steve Foley]] replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band's career, Westerberg exerted more control over the creative output. The group disbanded in 1991, with the members eventually pursuing various projects. A reunion was announced on October 3, 2012.<ref name="reunion">{{cite magazine|author=Greenwald, David|title=The Replacements Reuniting for Covers Set|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474799/the-replacements-reuniting-for-covers-set|date=October 3, 2012|magazine=Billboard|access-date=October 3, 2012}}</ref> The band is referred to by their nickname "The 'Mats" by fans, which originated as a truncation of "The Placemats," a mispronunciation of their name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/08/20/the-currents-guide-to-the-replacements|title=The Current's Guide to The Replacements|website=Thecurrent.org|access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>

The Replacements' music was influenced by [[Rock music|rock]] artists such as [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Beatles]], [[Faces (band)|Faces]], [[Big Star]], [[Slade]], [[Badfinger]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], and [[Bob Dylan]] as well as [[punk rock]] bands such as the [[Ramones]], the [[New York Dolls]], the [[Buzzcocks]], [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]], and the [[Sex Pistols]]. Unlike many of their underground contemporaries, the Replacements played "heart-on-the-sleeve"<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=196}}</ref> rock songs that combined Westerberg's "raw-throated adolescent howl"<ref name="a202">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=202}}</ref> with self-deprecating lyrics. The Replacements were a notoriously wayward live act, often performing under the influence of alcohol and playing fragments of covers instead of their own material.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1978–1980)===
The Replacements' history began in Minneapolis in 1978, when nineteen-year-old Bob Stinson gave his eleven-year-old brother Tommy Stinson a [[bass guitar]] to keep him off the streets.<ref name="a198-9">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=198–9}}</ref> That year Bob met Mars, a high school dropout. With Mars playing guitar and then switching to drums, the trio called themselves "Dogbreath" and began covering songs by [[Aerosmith]], [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Yes (band)|Yes]]<ref name="a198">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=198}}</ref> without a singer.<ref>Heibutzki, Ralph (October 29, 1993). "Brats in Babylon". ''Goldmine''.</ref> One day as Westerberg, a janitor in U.S. Senator [[David Durenberger]]'s office,<ref>Valania, Jonathan. [http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2002/08/16/paul-westerberg-the-man-who-wasnt-there/ "Paul Westerberg: The Man Who Wasn't There,"] ''[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]]'' (August 16, 2002).</ref> was walking home from work, he heard a band playing in the Stinsons' house.<ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|pp=56–57}}</ref> After being impressed by the band's performance, Westerberg regularly listened in after work. Mars knew Westerberg and invited him over to jam. Westerberg was unaware Mars drummed in Dogbreath.<ref name="a198" />

Dogbreath auditioned several vocalists, including a hippie who read lyrics off a sheet.<ref>Ayers, Dave (December 1983). "The Replacements: Getting No Place?". ''Matter''.</ref> The band eventually found a vocalist, but Westerberg wanted to be the singer and took him aside one day to say, "The band doesn't like you." The vocalist soon left and Westerberg replaced him.<ref name="a198" /> Before Westerberg joined the band, Dogbreath often drank and took various drugs during rehearsals, playing songs as an afterthought.<ref name="a198-9" /> In contrast to the rest of the band, the relatively disciplined Westerberg appeared at rehearsals in neat clothes and insisted on practicing songs until he was happy with them.<ref name="a199">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=199}}</ref>

"They didn't even know what punk was. They didn't like punk. Chris had hair down to his shoulders," Westerberg chortled to an interviewer.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Gumprecht |first=Blake |date=December 1983 |title=The Replacements: 'I Feel Lonely In A Crowd' |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/the-replacements-i-feel-lonely-in-a-crowd |magazine=Matter |location=Chicago |access-date=August 14, 2019 |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> But after the band members discovered first-generation English punk bands like the [[The Clash|Clash]], the [[The Jam|Jam]], the [[The Damned (band)|Damned]] and the [[The Buzzcocks|Buzzcocks]], Dogbreath changed its name to the Impediments and played a drunken performance without Tommy Stinson at a church hall gig in June 1980.<ref name="a200">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=200}}</ref> After being banned from the venue for disorderly behavior, they changed the name to the Replacements.<ref>{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5255|pure_url=yes}} | title=The Replacements: Biography | access-date=February 3, 2008 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> In an unpublished memoir, Mars later explained the band's choice of name: "Like maybe the main act doesn't show, and instead the crowd has to settle for an earful of us dirtbags....It seemed to sit just right with us, accurately describing our collective 'secondary' social esteem".<ref name="a199" />

===Demo tape and Twin/Tone Records (1980–1981)===
The band soon recorded a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement<ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=56}}</ref> and handed it to [[Peter Jesperson]] in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of [[Oar Folkjokeopus]], a [[punk rock]] record store in Minneapolis,<ref>"Rock's Rudder Works at the Oar". ''[[Minneapolis Star]]''. September 11, 1979.</ref> and had also founded [[Twin/Tone Records]] with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at [[Jay's Longhorn Bar]], a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey.<ref name="w61">{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=61}}</ref> (The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.)<ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=11}}</ref> He eavesdropped as Jesperson put in the tape, only to run away as soon as the first song, "Raised in the City", played.<ref name="a199" /> Jesperson played the song again and again. "If I've ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping that tape in", said Jesperson. "I didn't even get through the first song before I thought my head was going to explode".<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=199–200}}</ref>

Jesperson called Westerberg the next day, asking, "So do you want to do a single or an album?"<ref name="a200" /><ref name="w61" /> With the agreement of Stark and the rest of the band, the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone Records in 1980.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thereplacements/biography | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204939/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thereplacements/biography | url-status=dead | archive-date=September 30, 2007 | title=The Replacements: Biography | access-date=February 4, 2008 | magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Jesperson's support of the band was welcomed, and they asked him to be their manager after their second show. Later that summer they played at the Longhorn on a Wednesday "New Band Night". They also played several club gigs to almost empty rooms. When they finished a song, apart from the low hum of conversation, the band would hear Jesperson's loud whistle and fast clapping. "His enthusiasm kept us going at times, definitely," Mars later said. "His vision, his faith in the band was a binding force."<ref name="a200" />

After the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone, Westerberg began to write new songs and soon had a whole album's worth of material. Mere weeks after their live debut, the band felt ready to record the album. Jesperson chose Blackberry Way, an eight-track home studio in Minneapolis. However, as the band had no clout there, time spent in the studio was intermittent, and it took about six months to record the album.<ref name="a201">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=201}}</ref> Although not important at the time, Twin/Tone could not afford to release the album until August 1981. Because they were suspicious of the music business in general, the Replacements had not signed a written contract with Twin/Tone Records.<ref name="a202"/>

===Early releases (1981–1982)===
When the band's first album, ''[[Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash]]'', was released in August 1981, it received positive reviews in local fanzines. ''Option''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Blake Gumprecht wrote, "Westerberg has the ability to make you feel like you're right in the car with him, alongside him at the door, drinking from the same bottle."<ref name="a201" /> The album contained the band's first single, "[[I'm in Trouble]]", Westerberg's "first truly good song".<ref name="a201" /> ''Sorry Ma'' included the song, "Somethin to Dü", a homage to another Minneapolis punk band, [[Hüsker Dü]].<ref>{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t806154|pure_url=yes}} | title=Somethin to Dü | access-date=February 3, 2008 | author=Mason, Stewart | publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> The Replacements had a friendly rivalry with the band, which started when Twin/Tone chose the Replacements over Hüsker Dü,<ref name="a205">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=205}}</ref> and Hüsker Dü landed an opening slot at a [[Johnny Thunders]] gig that the Replacements had wanted.<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=204–5}}</ref> Hüsker Dü also influenced the band's music. The Replacements began playing faster and became more influenced by [[hardcore punk]]. Despite this, the band did not feel part of the hardcore scene. As Mars later stated, "We were confused about what we were."<ref name="a205" />

Sometime in late 1981, the Replacements played a song called "Kids Don't Follow".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Jesperson was convinced the song sounded like a hit<ref name="a206">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=206}}</ref> and pleaded with the Twin/Tone co-owners Stark and Hallman, "I will do anything to get this out. I will hand-stamp jackets if I have to."<ref name="w89">{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=89}}</ref> The partners agreed to fund the recording, but Jesperson and virtually everyone he knew had to hand-stamp ten thousand white record jackets.<ref name="w89" /> The band recorded eight tracks within a week, with Jesperson as producer. Their "balls-to-the-wall hardcore punk attempt",<ref name="a206" /> their first EP ''[[Stink (album)|Stink]]'', containing "Kids Don't Follow" and seven other songs, was released in June 1982, six months after the Chicago show.<ref name="a206" />

The Replacements began to distance themselves from the hardcore punk scene after the release of ''Stink''. "We write songs rather than riffs with statements,"<ref name="a208" /> Westerberg later stated. Inspired by other rock subgenres, he had been writing songs that incorporated a wide range of musical styles. He even wrote an acoustic ballad, "You're Getting Married One Night", but when he played it to the rest of the band, it was met with silence. "Save that for your solo album, Paul," Bob Stinson said. "That ain't the Replacements".<ref name="a208" /> The track remained unreleased for years. Westerberg realized his toughest audience was the band itself, later saying, "If it doesn't rock enough, Bob will scoff at it, and if it isn't catchy enough, Chris won't like it, and if it isn't modern enough, Tommy won't like it."<ref name="a208" />

===''Hootenanny'' and ''Let It Be'' (1983–1984)===
With a batch of new songs, the Replacements entered a warehouse in [[Roseville, Minnesota]], to record their next album, with Twin/Tone co-owner Stark engineering. Westerberg wrote songs in stops and starts, so it took several sessions of recording to finish the album. Stark's meticulous approach to recording contrasted with that of the Replacements, often frustrating the band. In one session, Mars and Westerberg switched instruments, and the band began to improvise, with Westerberg repeatedly shouting, "It's a hootenanny." The band then declared it to be "side one, track one" of the new album.<ref name="a209">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=209}}</ref> According to Stark, the recording "was a complete joke from their point of view—they did not care what they delivered".<ref name="a209" />

''[[Hootenanny (The Replacements album)|Hootenanny]]'', the band's second studio album, was released in April 1983. ''Hootenanny'' saw Westerberg expand his songwriting capabilities, In songs such as "Willpower", with echoed vocals and a sparse arrangement, and "Within Your Reach", which features Westerberg on all instruments, he revealed a more sensitive side.<ref name="a209" /> It was a more mature album than ''Stink'' and ''Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash''. ''Hootenanny'' was played on over two hundred radio stations across the country, with critics acclaiming the album. [[Robert Christgau]], writing in the ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'', deemed it "the most critically independent album of 1983".<ref name="a210">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=210}}</ref>

By ''Hootenanny''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, the Replacements had begun to attract a following outside of Minneapolis. The band embarked on its first tour of the United States in April 1983, joined by Bill Sullivan, a young security guard, as roadie, who approached the band after a show at the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis.<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=207}}</ref> Tommy Stinson dropped out of the tenth grade to join the rest of the band on tour. The Replacements toured venues on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], including a tense gig at [[City Gardens]], in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], where numerous punks lined the edge of the stage as the band played.<ref name="a208">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=208}}</ref> The band performed in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Philadelphia]], but its intended destination was [[New York City]], where they played at [[Gerde's Folk City]]; they also performed at [[Maxwell's]], in Hoboken, New Jersey.<ref name="a216">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=216}}</ref>

The Replacements returned to New York in June 1983, playing at [[CBGB]]. The gig was a failure; the band were almost refused entry, Bob Stinson was thrown out as soon as he walked in the door, and the Replacements were the last of five bands, which meant they played in the early morning on a Monday night. The show at Folk City was not a success, because "The Replacements were so loud and obnoxious that the people just cleared right out," according to manager Jesperson.<ref name="a216" /> The band supported [[R.E.M.]] on an eight-date tour later that summer, deciding that they should alienate the audience as much as possible. It was not a successful tour; by the end, various members had threatened to leave the Replacements. Band morale was low, and Westerberg later stated, "We'd much rather play for fifty people who know us than a thousand who don't care."<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=218}}</ref>

For the recording of their next studio album, the Replacements decided to return to Blackberry Way Studios in late 1983. The band considered R.E.M.'s guitarist [[Peter Buck]] as producer, but when they met him in [[Athens, Georgia]], they did not have enough material to begin recording. Instead, Jesperson and Steve Fjelstad co-produced the album.<ref>Gray, Marcus (1997). ''It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. Companion'' (2nd ed.). Da Capo. {{ISBN|0-306-80751-3}}, p. 356–357</ref> By this time, the Replacements had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively; Westerberg stated, "Now we're softening a little where we can do something that's a little more sincere without being afraid that someone's not going to like it or the punks aren't going to be able to dance to it."<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=221}}</ref>

The new material placed more of a focus on songwriting, and the music was influenced by [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[arena rock]] and [[Chicago blues]]. Instruments such as [[piano]], [[twelve-string guitar]] and [[mandolin]]  were featured throughout the album.<ref name="a222">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=222}}</ref> The new album included songs such as "[[I Will Dare]]", which featured Buck playing lead guitar;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/11518071.html |title=An excerpt from Jim Walsh's book "The Replacements: All Over but the Shouting" |access-date=January 23, 2009 |newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune |date=November 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426110734/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/11518071.html |archive-date=April 26, 2009 }}</ref> "Androgynous", with Westerberg on piano; and "Unsatisfied", in which, according to writer Michael Azerrad, Westerberg "had hit upon a moving new way to declare that he [[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|can't get no satisfaction]]."<ref name="a222"/> The band's album ''[[Let It Be (The Replacements album)|Let It Be]]'' was released in October 1984 to critical acclaim.<ref name="a223">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=223}}</ref> Robert Christgau gave the album an A+,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=the+replacements | title=CG: the replacements | access-date=February 13, 2008 | last=Christgau | first=Robert | author-link=Robert Christgau |website=Robertchristgau.com}}</ref> the first and only A+ Tommy
Stinson would receive in his life, and the ''Seattle Rocket'' critic [[Bruce Pavitt]] called ''Let It Be'' "mature diverse rock that could well shoot these regional boys into the national mainstream".<ref name="a223" /> In 1989, ''Let It Be'' was ranked number 12 on ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine's list of the "25 Greatest Albums of All Time"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/spin100.html|title=Rocklist.net...Spin Magazine (USA) Lists...Page 2..|website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk|access-date=April 18, 2015}}</ref> and number 15 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s".

===Early major-label releases (1985–1988)===
''Let It Be'' attracted the attention of major record labels, and by late 1984 several had expressed an interest in signing the Replacements.<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|pp=226–7}}</ref> Financially, the band was not doing well; they were not selling enough records to recoup their expenses, and money from shows went to recording costs, hotels, travel, food and instrument repairs. Bob Stinson worked a day job as a pizza chef.<ref name="a226">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=226}}</ref> Twin/Tone was not being paid reliably by distributors,<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=225}}</ref> and the sales of ''Let It Be'' were not high enough to justify extra promotion. "It was time for a major label to take over," according to the label's co-owner Stark.<ref name="a226" /> The band was close to a major-label contract but often alienated label representatives by intentionally performing badly in concert;<ref name="w165">{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=165}}</ref> their 1985 live album, ''[[The Shit Hits the Fans]]'', was an example of their concert performances at the time.

One label, the [[Warner Bros. Records]] subsidiary [[Sire Records]], eventually signed the Replacements.<ref name="a227">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=227}}</ref> The band admired the label head, [[Seymour Stein]], who had managed the [[Ramones]], and Stein recruited [[Tommy Ramone]] as producer for their first major-label album,<ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2007|p=167}}</ref> ''[[Tim (The Replacements album)|Tim]]'', released by Sire in October 1985.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/tim-mw0000191462 |title=The Replacements, ''Tim'': Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=December 22, 2012}}</ref><!-- expand, Walsh -->

The band spent the remainder of 1985 and the first half of 1986 touring behind ''Tim''. In mid-January 1986 the Replacements received a last-minute request to appear as the musical guests on the edition of January 18 of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', replacing the scheduled act, the [[The Pointer Sisters|Pointer Sisters]], who had been forced to cancel only days before the show. The invitation was partly thanks to the show's musical director of the time, [[G.E. Smith]], who was a Replacements fan but, as a result of their shambolic and profanity-laced performance during the late-night live broadcast, SNL producer [[Lorne Michaels]] banned them from ever returning to the show (although Westerberg returned as a solo artist in 1993.) They performed "Kiss Me on the Bus" while completely intoxicated, and after playing an out-of-tune "[[Bastards of Young]]" (during which Westerberg audibly called out "Come on fucker" just off-mic) they returned to stage wearing mismatched iterations of each other's clothing. In a 2015 interview recorded for the [[Archive of American Television]], G.&nbsp;E. Smith recalled that although the band had performed well for the early evening pre-taped dress rehearsal performance, one of the band's crew then smuggled alcohol into their dressing room and they spent the next few hours drinking (with the guest host, [[Harry Dean Stanton]]) and taking drugs. According to Smith, by the time of the late-night live broadcast they were so intoxicated that on their way to the stage to perform, Bob Stinson tripped in the corridor, fell over onto his guitar and broke it, and Smith had to hurriedly loan him one of the SNL house band's spare instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/ge-smith|title=G.E. Smith|date=October 23, 2017|website=Television Academy Interviews}}</ref> 

A few weeks later, on February 4, 1986, the band returned to the New York City area to perform at [[Maxwell's]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. That show was professionally recorded by a crew hired by the band's label [[Sire Records]], for use in a possible [[live album]]. Over 30 years later, the recordings were finally released as the [[double album]] ''[[For Sale: Live at Maxwell's 1986]]''.<ref name="strib-2017">{{Cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/first-proper-replacements-live-album-from-1986-coming-out-in-october/435204743/ |title=First proper Replacements live album from 1986 coming out in October |last=Riemenschneider |first=Chris |date=July 17, 2017 |work=[[Star Tribune]]}}</ref>
The tour ended abruptly in June 1986 because Westerberg injured his finger during a show at [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York City.

In August 1986, the Replacements either fired Bob Stinson from the band which he had founded, or he chose to leave, or a little of both.  In either case, it was due to creative and personal differences between Stinson and the remainder of the band, aggravated by Stinson's alcohol and drug abuse issues. They also fired Jesperson the same year. "It was like being thrown out of a club that you helped start," Jesperson later commented. "Everybody was drinking and doing more drugs than they needed to."<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=228}}</ref>

Bob Stinson preferred the louder, faster style of the band's early music, while Westerberg was exploring new territory in ballads like "Here Comes a Regular" and "Swingin' Party". The remaining Replacements carried on as a trio for ''[[Pleased to Meet Me]]'' (1987), recorded in Memphis with [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]] producer [[Jim Dickinson]]. Minneapolis guitarist [[Slim Dunlap]] took over on lead guitar for the subsequent tour and soon became a full member of the band.

===''Don't Tell a Soul'' and ''All Shook Down'' (1989–1990)===
The band's next album, ''[[Don't Tell a Soul]]'', was a quieter, less punky affair, largely considered an attempt at mainstream success. While the move cost the Replacements the appreciation of some hardcore fans, the album had some notable songs, such as "Achin' to Be" and "[[I'll Be You]]", the latter of which topped the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock chart. The band then made a second appearance on network television, on the short-lived ABC program ''[[International Rock Awards]]'', for which they performed a typically energetic version of "Talent Show" and caused a minor controversy when Westerberg responded to the network's censoring of the "feeling good from the pills we took" line by inserting an uncensored "It's too late to take pills, here we go" at the end of the song. The band appeared on the cover of ''Musician'' magazine in February 1989, in which it was described as "the last, best band of the 80s".<ref name="Musician">{{cite news|url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/paul-westerberg-on-how-to-write-an-ending/|title=The Last Best Band of the 80s|work=Musician|date=February 1989}}</ref>

But there was trouble within the band following a disastrous tour opening for [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. Westerberg recorded a new album largely with session musicians but was persuaded to release it as a Replacements album. ''[[All Shook Down]]'' won critical praise and more mainstream attention and its debut single "[[Merry Go Round (The Replacements song)|Merry Go Round]]" again topped the Modern Rock charts. However, the album's many guest players and Mars's quick departure from the band following the album's release led many to wonder about the band's future. They also received a nomination for a [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]].

===Breakup (1991–2011)===
Steve Foley was recruited as Mars's replacement in 1990, and the band toured with [[Elvis Costello]] in June 1991, the final show being at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The band then embarked on a long farewell tour, which lasted into the summer of 1991. On July 4, 1991, the band played their last show for 22 years, with the Chicago power-pop trio [[Material Issue]] at [[Taste of Chicago]] in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], referred to by fans as "It Ain't Over 'Til the Fat Roadie Plays", because each member disappeared during the set, their respective roadies taking their places. This show was broadcast live by the Chicago radio station [[WXRT]]. Several bootlegs are available on the [[Internet]].

Bob Stinson, after leaving the Replacements in 1986, played in local Minneapolis bands such as [[Static Taxi]] and the Bleeding Hearts. After several years of drug and alcohol abuse, he died in 1995, at the age of 35.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB5DEC2C70BF9E9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Replacements' 'Lunatic Guitarist,' Bob Stinson, Dies|last=Walsh|first=Jim|date=February 20, 1995|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|access-date=April 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIasFLkTWIQC&q=%22who+gained+national+notoriety+as+the+madman+guitarist+for%22&pg=PT243|title=The Replacements: All Over but the Shouting: An Oral History|last=Walsh|first=Jim|date=November 30, 2009|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-3494-2|page=240}}</ref> Tommy Stinson quickly followed his time in the Replacements with the short-lived bands [[Bash & Pop]] and [[Perfect (American band)|Perfect]]. He was the bass guitarist for [[Guns N' Roses]] beginning in 1998, replacing [[Duff McKagan]] from the band's "classic lineup" until leaving the band in 2016. In 2004, he released a solo CD, ''[[Village Gorilla Head]]'', followed in 2011 by ''One Man Mutiny''.

Westerberg is a successful singer-songwriter signed to [[Vagrant Records]] and, under his alias Grandpaboy, to [[Fat Possum Records]]. His album ''Folker'' was released in September 2004, marking a return to the melodic low-fi of the Replacements. Dunlap kept a low national profile but remained active in the Twin Cities music scene until suffering a massive stroke in 2012, which left him without the ability to move or eat.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Replacements' Slim Dunlap loses speech after stroke|url=https://blog.seattlepi.com/people/2015/03/25/the-replacements-slim-dunlap-loses-speech-after-stroke/|website=Celebrities and Entertainment News|access-date=February 28, 2018|date=March 25, 2015}}</ref> Mars primarily works as a visual artist.

In 1997, [[Reprise Records]] released the two CD set ''[[All for Nothing / Nothing for All]]''. The ''All for Nothing'' disc collected cuts from ''Tim'' through ''All Shook Down''; the ''Nothing for All'' disc is a collection of B-sides and tracks not previously released on albums.

In 2002, in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Westerberg mentioned that the Replacements had been considering a reunion. He said, "We'll get together again one day. It will take a while, or it might take a few legal swipes of the pen, but we ain't over." A partial reunion nearly occurred in March 2002, when Tommy Stinson planned to join Westerberg on a tour of the Midwest, but Stinson's prior commitments with Guns N' Roses prevented it from happening.<ref name="rsreunion">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thereplacements/articles/story/5934315/replacements_mull_reunion | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709024915/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thereplacements/articles/story/5934315/replacements_mull_reunion | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 9, 2008 | title=Replacements Mull Reunion | access-date=February 4, 2008 | author=Devenish, Colin | magazine=Rolling Stone | date=March 29, 2002}}</ref>

On June 13, 2006, [[Rhino Records]] released the compilation album ''[[Don't You Know Who I Think I Was?]]'', consisting of songs from the Twin/Tone and Sire-Reprise years and including two new songs, "Pool & Dive" and "Message to the Boys". The new songs were written by Westerberg and recorded by the band (Westerberg, Tommy Stinson and Mars) at [[Flowers Studio]] in Minneapolis. Session musician [[Josh Freese]] (the [[The Vandals|Vandals]], ex-[[A Perfect Circle]], ex-[[Guns N' Roses]]) played drums on the two tracks; Mars contributed backing vocals. Neither [[Slim Dunlap]] nor [[Steve Foley (drummer)|Steve Foley]] participated in the sessions.

On April 22, 2008, Rhino released remastered deluxe editions of the band's four Twin/Tone albums with rare bonus tracks. On September 24, 2008, Rhino similarly released the four Sire albums in deluxe editions. Material recorded with [[Tom Waits]] in 1988 was released on the Westerberg solo album ''[[3oclockreep]]'' in 2008.

Foley died in 2008 from an accidental overdose of a prescription medication.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite news|author=Cohen, Jonathan|title=Replacements Drummer Steve Foley Dies|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044337/replacements-drummer-steve-foley-dies|date=August 27, 2008|work=Billboard|access-date=September 5, 2008}}</ref>

===Reunion (2012–2015)===
On October 3, 2012, it was announced that the Replacements had re-formed and that Westerberg and Tommy Stinson were in the studio recording an EP containing song cover versions. Titled ''[[Songs for Slim]]'', the EP was sold in a 250-copy edition of 10" vinyl and auctioned online to benefit former bandmate Dunlap, who had suffered a stroke.<ref name="reunion" />

In November 2012, the documentary filmmaker [[Gorman Bechard]] released ''[[Color Me Obsessed]]'', a film which tells the band's story through the eyes of their most ardent fans.

On June 5, 2015, Westerberg announced onstage at the Primavera Sound festival in [[Porto|Porto, Portugal]], that it was the band's final show.

In a September 2015 interview, Stinson discussed the band working on new studio material, stating, "it was one of those things: We dipped our toe in the water, and it didn't feel so good." Stinson stated that he had reworked songs he wrote for the Replacements as material for his solo career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/tommy-stinson-replacements-run-was-special-but-it-s-time-to-move-on/323903361/ |title=Stinson: Replacements Run Was 'Special' but It's Time to Move On |work=Star Tribune |date=September 5, 2015 |access-date=April 10, 2016}}</ref>

==Live performances==
The Replacements gained local notoriety following their first live performance, because of Tommy Stinson's young age. Early shows were consistently tight and became more aggressive following the release of the ''Stink'' EP in 1982. As their stylistic repertoire began to expand with the writing and recording of ''Hootenanny'' the following year, the band's increasingly antagonistic stage show left them with a reputation for their rowdy, often drunken live shows. The band frequently went on stage too intoxicated to play. They were famously banned permanently from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' after performing drunk before a national television audience on January 18, 1986. As one reviewer succinctly observed, the band could quite often be "mouthing profanities into the camera, stumbling into each other, falling down, dropping their instruments, and generally behaving like the apathetic drunks they were."<ref>{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Noel |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/inventory-ten-memorable-saturday-night-live-musica,1525/ |title=Inventory: Ten Memorable Saturday Night Live Musical Moments |work=The A.V. Club |date=August 5, 2011 |access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> There emerged an element of unpredictability, as The Replacements—when sober—gained critical praise for their live shows. Part of the mystique of The Replacements was the fact that the audience never knew until the start of a concert if the band would be sober enough to play. It was not uncommon for the group to play entire sets of cover versions, ranging anywhere from [[Bryan Adams]]'s "Summer of '69" to [[Dusty Springfield]]'s "The Look of Love" to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "Black Dog."
