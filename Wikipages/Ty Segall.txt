==Recording career==

===Early career (2008–2011)===
Segall began his recording career as a part-time musician in various [[underground music|underground]] bands in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] including Epsilons and Evil Robots, before beginning a solo career in 2008. Segall's first solo release was the [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] ''Horn The Unicorn'' released on the Wizard Mountain label (later re-released by HBSP-2X on [[vinyl record]]). Around the same time, Wizard Mountain also released a split cassette featuring Segall and the band Superstitions entitled ''Halfnonagon''.

After Segall befriended [[John Dwyer (musician)|John Dwyer]], of [[Thee Oh Sees]] and [[Coachwhips]], Dwyer offered to release Segall's debut solo album, ''[[Ty Segall (2008 album)|Ty Segall]]'' (2008), on his label, [[Castle Face Records]]. The two became firm friends, with Segall noting: "The music community is amazing here, super-tight, and John Dwyer's like the Mayor of San Francisco. Come down here, you'll see him riding his bike, drinking a beer, and he'll probably take you out to get a taco. He's the nicest guy in the world.".<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/aug/02/ty-segall-john-dwyer-san-franscisco-psychedelia |title=Ty Segall and John Dwyer: putting San Francisco back on the psychedelic map |first=Stevie |last=Chick |work=theguardian.com |access-date=17 November 2015|date=August 2, 2012 }}</ref> In a recent interview, Larry Hardy, creator of [[In the Red Records|In The Red Records]], talked about the possibility of a band with Segall and Dwyer.<ref>Interview by [http://www.stillinrock.com/2016/03/interview-larry-hardy-in-the-red-records.html Still in Rock.com]</ref>

===''Emotional Mugger'' and The Muggers (2016)===

Subsequently a website was also created, www.emotionalmugger.com, that would feature a short video of Segall explaining the concept of emotional mugging and a video of Segall and his band wearing baby masks and playing a live version of a song from the new album.

The video also introduces The Muggers,<ref name="pitchfork.com"/> which, upon the album's release, Segall formed as a backing band. The band consisted of [[Mikal Cronin]] (bass, sax), [[King Tuff|Kyle Thomas]] (guitar), [[Emmett Kelly (musician)|Emmett Kelly]] (guitar), and [[Wand (band)|Wand]]'s Cory Hanson (keyboards, guitar) and Evan Burrows (drums).

[[File:2021 Shaky Knees - Ty Segall and Freedom Band (3).jpg|thumb|Segall performing with the Freedom Band in 2021]]
In November 2016, Segall announced the release of his ninth studio album, ''[[Ty Segall (2017 album)|Ty Segall]]''. The album was to be his second self-titled release, following the release of [[Ty Segall (2008 album)|his eponymously titled debut album]] in 2008.<ref name=Pitchnews>{{cite web|last=Yoo|first=Noah|title=Ty Segall Announces New Self-Titled Album, Shares New Song "Orange Color Queen"|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/69833-ty-segall-announces-new-self-titled-album-shares-new-song-orange-color-queen-listen/|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|access-date=15 November 2016|date=15 November 2016}}</ref> It was preceded by the release of the single "Orange Color Queen" in November 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/11/ty-segall-announces-new-album-shares-orange-color-queen-listen/|title=Ty Segall announces new album, shares "Orange Color Queen" — listen|date=2016-11-15|newspaper=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-19}}</ref> Later, the song "Break A Guitar" was released to streaming platforms on January 19, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2017/01/ty-segall-shares-shredding-new-single-break-a-guitar-listen/|title=Ty Segall shares shredding new single "Break A Guitar" — listen|date=2017-01-19|newspaper=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-19}}</ref> Also following the album's release, Segall began touring with the [[backing band]] that recorded the album, which was now named The Freedom Band.<ref name=jankysmooth>{{cite web|last=Silva-Espinosa|first=Aria|title=Ty Segall & The Freedom Band Blow Minds at Secret Show at The Griffin|url=http://www.jankysmooth.com/ty-segall-freedom-band-blow-minds-secret-show-griffin-los-feliz-01-16-2017/

In the album, Segall displays his ability to play the full repertoire of rock; in one album he goes from [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] style glam rock, to [[Bob Dylan]]-esque country rock, to the breadth and social commentary of [[Pink Floyd]], to hardcore punk, to a jam band sound.<ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=http://floodmagazine.com/42695/fuzzbox-liturgy-of-ty-segall/|title=Freedom Rock: The Fuzzbox Liturgy of Ty Segall|website=FLOOD|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> Segall describes the record as a "song album"—one without a singular concept or sound.<ref name="auto2"/> The ten-minute-long centerpiece of the album is "Warm Hands (Freedom Returned)", which starts with Segall's characteristic punk-inspired thrashing guitar, but becomes open and spacey around the five-minute mark, before reprising the melody from "Freedom" (the second track on the album).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/25/510577610/first-listen-ty-segall-ty-segall|title=Review: Ty Segall, 'Ty Segall'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en}}</ref> Comparisons have been drawn between this most recent album and Segall's 2012 release [[Twins (Ty Segall album)|''Twins'']], which was also a compilation of Segall's various influences and styles up to that point in his career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22819-ty-segall/|title=Ty Segall: Ty Segall Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> Segall released the album ''[[Freedom's Goblin]]'' on January 26, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/ty-segall-announces-new-album-freedoms-goblin/|title=Ty Segall Announces New Album Freedom's Goblin|work=Pitchfork|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=December 5, 2017|access-date=December 5, 2017}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Segall's music has been described as [[garage rock]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/ty-segall/ | title=No Tomorrow: Ty Segall | publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | access-date=February 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name="emotionalmugger-popmatters">{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/ty-segall-emotional-mugger/ | title=Ty Segall - Emotional Mugger | publisher=[[PopMatters]] | date=January 19, 2016 | access-date=2 February 2016 | author=Fitzgerald, Colin}}</ref> [[garage rock revival]], [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ty-segall-mn0000718184/biography | title=Ty Segall biography | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | access-date=February 2, 2016 | author=Roach, Pemberton}}</ref> [[indie rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]].<ref name="emotionalmugger-popmatters"/> Segall has stated in interviews that his favorite band of all time is [[Hawkwind]].<ref>{{cite news|title=You Spin Me Round – 5 records with Ty Segall|url=http://musicbloodline.info/artist/MN0000758520/spotify|publisher=Musicbloodline.info|date=October 22, 2013}}</ref> Notable glam rockers [[David Bowie]] and [[Marc Bolan]] heavily influenced Segall's early career, as well as heavy rock and punk bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[The Stooges]], and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] (especially in the Ty Segall Band).<ref>{{cite news|title=Cover Story – Ty Segall|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/ty-segall/|publisher=Pitchfork.com|date=November 26, 2012}}</ref> However, over time Segall's output has gotten mellower on albums such as ''Goodbye Bread'' and ''Sleeper'', taking cues from [[Neil Young]], [[The Byrds]], [[The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band]], [[The Beatles]] (even being compared to John Lennon vocally on some of his albums), and early [[T.
