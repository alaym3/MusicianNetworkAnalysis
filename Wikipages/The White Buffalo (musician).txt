'''The White Buffalo''' is the professional moniker and stage name of American musician and singer/songwriter Jake Smith, who was heavily influenced by Irish Traveller, Manor Donohue.<ref name=jurek>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/shadows-greys-evil-ways-mw0002567482 " The White Buffalo Shadows, Greys & Evil Ways"] review by Thom Jurek, ''AllMusic''</ref><ref>Maine, David.

== Early life and career ==
Born in [[Oregon]] in 1974/1975, and raised in [[California]], Jake Smith grew up listening to country music and [[punk rock]]. He studied history at university. The largest influences on his songwriting are [[American folk music|folk]] singers such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Leonard Cohen]].

A baritone, Smith is known for his wide range in pitch within his singing, incorporation of whistling into his music (in place of the harmonica often used in roots music) and his lyrical references to [[God]] and [[war]]. His singing style has been compared<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.easyreadernews.com/the-white-buffalo-hermosa-beach/|title = Long ride atop the White Buffalo|date = December 6, 2012}}</ref> to that of late singer-songwriter [[Richie Havens]].

The White Buffalo's first full-length album, ''Hogtied Like a Rodeo'', debuted in 2002. This was followed by ''The White Buffalo EP'', produced by Eels' Koool G Murder, which Smith states is about "relationships, love, loss and booze with a little murder mixed in." This EP was musically grounded in acoustic folk and country blues. In a friend's living room in 2008, he re-recorded the first album, dubbing it ''Hogtied Revisited''. Musically, this 2008 album was a blend of folk, modern rock, and alternative country.

When a bootleg tape of Smith's music made it into the hands of pro surfer Chris Malloy, one of his songs, "Wrong," was featured in his popular surf movie, ''Shelter''. This eventually led to further film scoring and composing work, with many of his songs featured in FX's hit show ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and Showtime's ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''.

In 2010, a second EP, ''Prepare for Black and Blue'',<ref>[http://www.hearya.com/2010/10/21/the-white-buffalo-prepare-for-black-and-blue-album-review/ "The White Buffalo Prepare For Black and Blue (Album Review)"]. ''Hear Ya''.</ref> was recorded in six days by producer Jimmy Messer and released through Chad Stokes' Ruffshod imprint via [[Nettwerk Records]] earlier that year. Again, this was musically grounded in folk. The music and the artist captured the attention of Unison Music's [[Bruce Witkin]] and Ryan Dorn, who then signed The White Buffalo and co-produced ''Once Upon a Time in the West''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quickcritmusic.com/2012/03/white-buffalo-once-upon-time-in-west.html|title=quickcrit – music reviews: The White Buffalo – Once Upon a Time in the West (2012)|work=quickcritmusic.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/music/article.jsp?essid=127029|title=KQED Public Media for Northern CA – KQED Arts|work=KQED Arts}}</ref> This album transitioned to a more roots rock sound, whilst some songs still retained a folk style.

In 2013, a fourth LP, ''Shadows, Greys, and Evil Ways'',<ref>[http://www.americansongwriter.com/2013/09/the-white-buffalo-shadows-greys-evil-ways/ "The White Buffalo Shadows, Greys And Evil Ways"]. ''American Songwriter''.</ref> was released on Unison Music Group. This was musically a mixture of folk rock and some blues rock. The LP saw positive reviews including NY1 which stated, "Not since [[Neil Young]]'s ''[[Living with War]]'' has there been so strong an artistic statement about this country's occupations."<ref>[https://thepreludepress.squarespace.com/news/2014/8/22/the-white-buffalo-makes-his-late-night-debut-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-on-aug-26 "The White Buffalo Makes His Late Night Debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Aug 26"]. ''Prelude Press''.</ref>

Jake Smith performed several songs on the  crime drama television series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''. Most notably, in 2014, he and [[The Forest Rangers (band)|The Forest Rangers]] performed the Season 7 finale song, "Come Join The Murder", written by the show's creator [[Kurt Sutter]].<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/premieres/hear-sons-of-anarchy-finale-song-20141209 |title=Hear the Dark Swan Song From the 'Sons of Anarchy' Finale |date=December 10, 2014 |publisher=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Other songs appearing on ''Sons of Anarchy'' include "Matador", "Damned", "Wish It Was True", "[[House of The Rising Sun]]" (with The Forest Rangers), "The Whistler", "Set My Body Free", "Sweet Hereafter", "Oh Darling, what have I done" and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" (with The Forest Rangers).<ref name="itunes">{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/songs-anarchy-music-from-sons/id483007515 |title=Songs of Anarchy: Music from Sons of Anarchy Seasons 1–4 |date=December 6, 2011 |publisher=iTunes}}</ref>

In 2015, the album ''Love and the Death of Damnation'' was released. Musically this was very varied, with several songs being grounded in roots rock, whilst the song "Chico" incorporated Latin music, "Last Call To Heaven" fused folk, blues and jazz, and "Come On Love, Come On In" was a soul song.

In August 2017 Smith released two tracks from his then-upcoming album ''Darkest Darks, Lightest Lights'', the singles "Avalon" and "The Observatory".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7905008/the-white-buffalo-avalon|title=The White Buffalo Shares Latest Alt-Country Track 'Avalon': Premiere|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thewhitebuffalo.com/home/|title=The White Buffalo » Home|website=thewhitebuffalo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-30}}</ref> The single "Avalon" was described by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as an "expansive country-tinged rock song" and tells the story of a wayward man's trip to peace.<ref name=":0" /> "The Observatory" was a blend of soft-rock and country-folk.

''Darkest Darks, Lightest Lights'' was released in October 2017 to positive reviews, and was Smith's most electrified rock album yet. Musically, the album was a blend of alternative rock, blues, country and folk. The song “The Observatory” was featured in ''[[This Is Us]]'' episode “The 5th Wheel”.
