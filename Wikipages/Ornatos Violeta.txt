==History==
In 1997, Ornatos Violeta released their first album ''[[Cão!]]'' (''Dog!''), which included the song "Letra S"'','' a duet with [[Manuela Azevedo]], vocalist of Portuguese band [[Clã]]. In the following year, during the [[Expo 98]], they collaborated on the compilation ''Tejo Beat'' alongside [[Boss AC]], [[Blasted Mechanism]], [[Zen (Dutch band)|Zen]] and Flood with the song "Tempo de Nascer".

Their second and last album, ''[[O Monstro Precisa de Amigos]]'' (''The Monster Needs Friends'') was released in 1999, with a more carefully thought production and a more mellow style. The album contained the singles "Ouvi Dizer", a duet with Portuguese musician Vitor Espadinha, and "Capitão Romance", with [[Gordon Gano]], vocalist of the American band [[Violent Femmes]]. During 1999 they helped to produce ''XX Anos XX Bandas'', a tribute to the Portuguese band [[Xutos & Pontapés]], with a cover their song "Circo de Feras".

After some speculation about their future, Ornatos Violeta split up in 2002.<ref name=pub2002>{{cite news| url=https://www.publico.pt/2002/10/01/culturaipsilon/noticia/ornatos-violeta-o-fim-da-cancao-183522 |title=Ornatos Violeta: o fim da canção|language=portuguese|newspaper=[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]|date=1 October 2002 |last=Pereira |first=Sílvia|accessdate=13 March 2019}}</ref> The band members went on to work independently on several other projects in the following decade, while a [[cult following]] started to grow around Ornatos, in particular around the work of Manel Cruz, author of most of the lyrics, and protagonist of newer projects such as [[Pluto (Portuguese band)|Pluto]], Foge Foge Bandido and SuperNada.<ref>{{cite news|date=10 November 2011|title=Reedições e inéditos para os 20 anos dos Ornatos Violeta|language=Portuguese|newspaper=[[Diário de Notícias]]|URL=https://www.dn.pt/artes/musica/interior/reedicoes-e-ineditos-para-os-20-anos-dos-ornatos-violeta-2113992.html|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>
