==Biography==
===Early life===
Van McCoy was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], the second child of Norman S. McCoy, Sr. and Lillian Ray.<ref name="McCoy">{{cite web|url=http://vanmccoymusic.com/van/bio.htm |title=The Story of Van McCoy |website=Van McCoy Music, Inc |access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref> He learned to play piano at a young age and sang with the Metropolitan Baptist [[Church choir]] as a youngster.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=van-mccoy-mn0000312522 |tab=biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Van McCoy Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=June 5, 2017}}</ref>

By the age of 12, he had begun writing his own songs, in addition to performing in local amateur shows alongside his older brother, Norman Jr.  The two brothers formed a [[doo-wop]] combo named the Starlighters with two friends while in [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Washington, D.C.)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]]. In 1956, they recorded a single entitled, "The Birdland",<ref name="McCoy"/> a novelty dance record. It gained some interest, resulting in a tour with saxophonist [[Vi Burnside]]. In 1959, the Starlighters produced three singles for [[End Records]] that included "I Cried". Marriage and other commitments eventually caused the group to disband during the mid-1950s. Van also sang with a group called the Marylanders.

During 1961, McCoy met [[Kendra Spotswood]] (also known as Sandi Sheldon) who lived near his family. For the next five years, they sang and recorded music together professionally. Their relationship ended when McCoy delayed their wedding plans because of a work contract he had signed with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="McCoy"/>

===Career===
In September 1958, McCoy entered [[Howard University]] to study [[psychology]] but dropped out after two years in order to relocate to Philadelphia, where he formed his own recording company, Rockin' Records, releasing his first single, "Hey Mr. DJ", in 1959.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]] |date=1993 |edition=first |isbn=0-85112-733-9 |page=173}}</ref> This single gained the attention of [[Scepter Records]] owner [[Florence Greenberg]], who hired McCoy as a staff writer and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative for the label.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> As a writer there, McCoy composed his first success, "Stop the Music", for the popular female vocal group, [[The Shirelles]], in 1962. He was co-owner of Vando Records with Philly D.J. [[Jocko Henderson]]. He owned the Share record label and co-owned the Maxx record label in the mid-1960s, supervising such artists as [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]], [[Chris Bartley (singer)|Chris Bartley]] and [[The Ad Libs]].

He came into his own after first working for top producers [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]] as a writer, and then signing with the major April-Blackwood music publishing concern, connected with [[Columbia Records]]. McCoy went on to write a string of hits as the 1960s progressed. He penned "[[Giving Up]]" for [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]] (later a hit for both [[The Ad Libs]]<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=the-ad-libs-mn0000752470 |tab=songs|pure_url=yes}} |title=Ad Libs Songs |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=June 5, 2017}}</ref> and [[Donny Hathaway]]), "[[The Sweetest Thing This Side of Heaven]]" for [[Chris Bartley (singer)|Chris Bartley]], "[[When You're Young and in Love]]" for [[Ruby & the Romantics]] (later a hit for [[The Marvelettes]]), "[[Right on the Tip of My Tongue]]" for [[Brenda & the Tabulations]],<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "[[Baby I'm Yours (Barbara Lewis song)|Baby I'm Yours]]" for [[Barbara Lewis]],<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "Getting Mighty Crowded" for [[Betty Everett]], "Abracadabra" for [[Erma Franklin]], "You're Gonna Make Me Love You" for [[Sandi Sheldon]], and "[[I Get the Sweetest Feeling]]" for [[Jackie Wilson]]. He also put together the hit-making duo of [[Peaches & Herb]], arranging and co-producing their first hit, "Let's Fall in Love", for the Columbia subsidiary Date in 1966.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In the same year McCoy recorded a solo [[LP (format)|LP]] for Columbia entitled ''Night Time Is Lonely Time'', and a year later started his own short-lived label, Vando, as well as his own production company VMP (Van McCoy Productions).<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

Van wrote or produced most consistently for [[The Presidents (U.S. soul band)|The Presidents]] ("[[5-10-15-20 (25-30 Years of Love)]]"), [[The Choice Four]], recording as The Finger Pointers ("Come Down to Earth"), [[Faith Hope and Charity (US band)|Faith, Hope & Charity]] ("[[To Each His Own (Faith, Hope & Charity song)|To Each His Own]]" and "Life Goes On") and [[David Ruffin]] ("[[Walk Away from Love]]"). In the early 1970s, McCoy began a long, acclaimed collaboration with songwriter/producer, Charles Kipps, and arranged several hits for the soul group [[The Stylistics]] as well as releasing his own solo LP on the [[Buddah Records|Buddah]] label, ''Soul Improvisations'', in 1972.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The album included a minor hit, "Let Me Down Easy", but it was not a success following poor promotion. Following his success with ''The Hustle,'' it was re-released in abridged form (two songs less) as ''From Disco to Love.'' He formed his own orchestra, Soul City Symphony<ref>{{cite web |url=https://everything2.com/title/Van+McCoy |title=Van McCoy Profile |website=[[Everything2]] |access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref> and, with singers Faith, Hope and Charity, produced several albums and gave many performances.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

===Television and film===
Van McCoy appeared on the ''[[Mike Douglas Show]]'' and was a regular guest on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.<ref name="wpobit">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1979/07/07/van-mccoy-39-composer-of-the-hustle-dies/9f7639a5-0f72-40f4-b97e-9b8f43e5a427/ |title=Van McCoy, 39, Composer of 'The Hustle,' Dies |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 7, 1979}}</ref> He wrote and sang the theme song for the 1978 movie ''[[Sextette]]'' that starred [[Mae West]] and [[Timothy Dalton]] and made a cameo appearance in it, playing a delegate from Africa. He also contributed some music for ''[[A Woman Called Moses]]''.<ref name="McCoy"/> Along with Faith Hope & Charity, [[Brass Construction]] and Johnny Dark, he appeared in episode 4.20 of [[Don Kirshner]]'s ''[[Rock Concert]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title | id= 1417464 | title= Rock Concert | description= (Episode #4.20) }}</ref>

===Mainstream success===
In 1975, McCoy released to low expectations the mostly instrumental LP ''[[Disco Baby]]'' for the [[Avco Records|Avco]] (later H&L) label. The title song, "Disco Baby", was written by George David Weiss, [[Hugo Peretti]] and [[Luigi Creatore]], and was also performed by [[The Stylistics]] for their 1975 album ''Thank You Baby''. Unexpectedly, a single called "[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]" from the album, written about the dance of the same name and recorded last for the album, went to the top of both the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop and R&B charts (also No. 3 in the UK)<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

McCoy, then regarded as a [[disco]] hitmaker, never repeated the success of the song, although the singles "Party", "That's the Joint" and "Change with the Times" got significant airplay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/nyc/avco/avco.html |title=Van McCoy Avco Recordings |website=Avco Embassy Discography |first1=Patrice |last1=Eyries |first2=Mike |last2=Callahan |first3=Dave |last3=Edwards |access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref> The latter reached No. 6 in the ''Billboard'' R&B chart and was a Top 40 hit in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> There were no further major sellers in the US, despite a series of follow-up albums, ''From Disco to Love'' (the abridged 1975 reissue of ''Soul Improvisations''), ''The Disco Kid'' (1975), ''The Real McCoy'' (1976), ''Rhythms of the World'' (1976), ''My Favorite Fantasy'' (1978), ''Lonely Dancer'' (1979) and ''Sweet Rhythm'' (1979).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> However, he scored the UK top 5 again during 1977 with the instrumental success "The Shuffle".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> which became the theme tune for [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Sport on Four]].''

McCoy also had success with [[David Ruffin]]'s comeback album, ''Who I Am'', featuring "[[Walk Away from Love]]", (US number 9, US number 1 R&B) in the US and a UK Top 5 success. He went on to produce the next two albums for Ruffin, which spawned further successes. McCoy produced [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]]' ''Still Together'' LP, and for [[Melba Moore]] ("[[This Is It (Melba Moore song)|This Is It]]" and "Lean on Me"). He discovered [[Faith Hope and Charity (US band)|Faith, Hope And Charity]], whose major success in 1975, "To Each His Own", was another R&B chart-topper.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In 1975, he also arranged two of his compositions "My Heart's Too Big For My Head" and "You've Got to Tell Her" for the [[Asha Puthli]] album ''She Loves to Hear the Music''.

==Death==
McCoy died from a heart attack in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], on July 6, 1979, at the age of 39.<ref name="nytobit">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/07/archives/van-mccoy-composed-the-hustle-hit-in-75.html|title=Van McCoy, Composed 'The Hustle,' Hit in '75 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=24 |date=July 7, 1979}}</ref> He is buried in the McCoy family plot at Lincoln Cemetery, [[Suitland, Maryland]], a suburb of Washington, D.C.
