== History ==

=== 1986–89: Formation and early releases ===
[[File:Maná - Rock in Rio Madrid 2012 - 65.jpg|thumb|Fher, lead singer]]
Maná was formed in 1986 by [[Fernando Olvera|José Fernando "Fher" Olvera]] (vocals), Ulises (guitars) and Juan Calleros (bass guitar), who had been performing together in a band called Sombrero Verde since the mid-1970s and disbanded in 1983.<ref name="Handsome">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/21/entertainment/ca-15058|title=In Any Language, Mana Is a Handsome Hit|last=Doss|first=Yvette C.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=21 August 1998|access-date=23 March 2012}}</ref> The three placed an advertisement in the local [[Guadalajara]] newspaper looking for a drummer to complete a new band, to which fifteen-year-old [[Alex González (musician)|Alex González]] applied and soon joined the group.<ref name="Handsome" /> Maná's first album was titled "Maná released on 12 May 1987 on A& M Records. Maná signed to [[PolyGram]], but became unhappy with the direction the label was taking the band and switched to [[Warner Music]] shortly before the release of the group's 2nd album, ''[[Falta Amor]]''.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/man-p34260/biography|title=Maná – Biography|last=Brown|first=Marisa|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=28 March 2012}}</ref>

A year passed before the album garnered its first hit single, "Rayando el Sol". The group toured heavily in support of the album performing more than 250 times throughout Latin America, including shows in Mexico, [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Colombia]].{{cn|date=October 2021}}

=== 1990–96: Commercial success ===
[[File:Maná - Rock in Rio Madrid 2012 - 51.jpg|thumb|left|Rock in Rio Madrid 2012.]]

In 1991, they added two new members to the group, Iván González on keyboards and César "Vampiro" López on guitar. Ulises Calleros no longer performed with the group, but became one of their managers. On 27 October 1992, the band released  ''[[¿Dónde Jugarán Los Niños?]]'', an album that spawned several hits (including "Vivir Sin Aire", "Oye Mi Amor", and "De Pies a Cabeza").  The record sold over 3 million copies worldwide and became the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time.<ref name="Burden">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/19/entertainment/ca-47944|title=The Burden of Success|last=Valdes-Rodriguez|first=Alisa|date=19 June 1999|access-date=28 March 2012|work=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company}}</ref> The band undertook an international tour with 268 concerts in 17 countries.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

In 1994, López and Iván González left the group due to musical and personal disputes.<ref name="Reshaped">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-02/entertainment/ca-64097_1_rock-band|title=Reshaped, Tougher Mana Fights Back With 'Angeles'|last=Lopetegui|first=Enrique|work=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=2 November 1995|access-date=29 March 2012}}</ref> Fher Olvera and [[Alex González (musician)|Alex González]]  felt that their departure offered an opportunity to reinvent the group's sound, and searched throughout Mexico, Spain and Argentina to find a new guitarist.<ref name="Reshaped" />

In the meantime, Maná released the live album ''[[Maná en Vivo]]'' before choosing Mexican guitarist [[Sergio Vallín]] to replace Calleros and López.<ref name="Allmusic" /> In 1995, the band recorded a Spanish version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Fool in the Rain]]" for the tribute album ''[[Encomium: A Tribute to Led Zeppelin|Encomium]]''.<ref name="Reshaped" />
[[File:Maná - Rock in Rio Madrid 2012 - 38.jpg|thumb|Lead singer Fher Olvera and Juan Calleros performing at Rock in Rio Madrid 2012.]]
On 25 April 1995, the group released ''[[Cuando los Ángeles Lloran]]''.  The album was noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work, which saw the group experimenting with [[funk]] and [[soul music]] genres.<ref name="Reshaped" /> Olvera explained shortly after the release of the album, "Basically, we're still the same Maná, but we're going through a funky, soulish stage. We want to have some fun and be a little louder."<ref name="Reshaped" /> The initial reaction to ''Cuando los Ángeles Lloran'' was mixed and the first single, the funk-influenced "Déjame Entrar", failed to reach the top ten on the [[Mexican Singles Chart]].<ref name="Reshaped" />  However, the album later caught on and sold 500,000 copies in the United States alone within five months of release.<ref name="Reshaped" />

=== 1997–2007: ''Sueños Líquidos'', ''Revolución de Amor'', and ''Amar es Combatir'' ===
In 1997, the group released ''[[Sueños Líquidos]]'', an album about the highs and lows of love, with songs like "Clavado en un bar" and "En el Muelle de San Blás", recorded in [[Puerto Vallarta]] and released simultaneously in 36 countries. The recording received a [[Grammy Award]] as Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The group performed acoustically in [[Miami]] for Latin America's ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' program. A final version of the performance was mixed at [[Conway Recording Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], and the band released ''[[Maná MTV Unplugged]]'' on 22 June 1999.<ref name="Burden" />

In the summer of 1999, the band co-headlined an 18-city tour of the United States with [[Carlos Santana]].<ref name="Burden" />  Maná also appeared on Santana's 1999 album ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]'' on the song "[[Corazón Espinado]]".<ref name="Allmusic" />

In 2002, in an effort to blend their sound with that of rock and roll from the sixties and seventies, the band recorded ''[[Revolución de Amor]]''. They won their fourth Grammy for the album. The band released a new version of "Eres mi Religión" for the Italian market in 2003, as a duet with Italian musician [[Zucchero]], and also performed with Zucchero in a new recording of his "[[Baila morena (Zucchero and Maná song)|Baila Morena]]". This same year they participated in the annual [[Luciano Pavarotti|Pavarotti]] & Friends concert, along with [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Ricky Martin]], [[Andrea Bocelli]], Zucchero and [[Bono]].

[[File:Maná - Rock in Rio Madrid 2012 - 06.jpg|thumb|220px|Fher Olvera performing at Rock in Rio Madrid 2012.]]
