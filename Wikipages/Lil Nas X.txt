== Career ==
===2015–2017: Internet personality===
Hill said he began to isolate himself from "outside-of-class activities" during his teenage years. He spent large amounts of time online in hopes of building a following as an [[internet personality]] to promote his work, but was unsure what to focus on creatively. In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview he stated, "I was doing Facebook comedy videos, then I moved over to Instagram, and then I hopped on Twitter ... where I really was a master. That was the first place where I could go viral."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1060868/why-lil-nas-x-breaking-billboard-records-is-such-a-big-deal|title=Why Lil Nas X Breaking Records Is Such a Big Deal|last=Nilles|first=Billy|date=August 2, 2019|website=E!

During this period, he reportedly created and ran [[Nicki Minaj]] fan accounts on Twitter, including one called "@NasMaraj", according to a [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' Magazine]] investigation.<ref name="NYMag">{{cite web|last=Feldman|first=Brian|url=http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/lil-nas-x-was-a-popular-twitter-user-before-old-town-road.html|title=Before 'Old Town Road,' Lil Nas X Was a Tweetdecker |work=New York Magazine |date=April 5, 2019 |access-date=April 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Reinstein |first1=Julia |title=Lil Nas X Used To Be A Tweetdecker |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/lil-nas-x-tweetdecker-old-town-road |website=BuzzFeed News |access-date=September 3, 2019 |date=April 5, 2019}}</ref> In 2017, this account gained attention for its [[flash fiction]]-style interactive "scenario threads" popularized on Twitter using dashboard app [[TweetDeck]].<ref>{{cite web|last=N/A|first=Mix|url=https://thenextweb.com/twitter/2017/07/10/twitter-storyteller-interactive-fiction/ |title=One cryptic storyteller is using Twitter to craft thrilling interactive fiction |work=The Next Web |date=July 10, 2017 |access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Montero|url=https://www.reddit.com/user/nasmaraj |title=nasmaraj (u/nasmaraj) – Reddit |work=Reddit |date=August 4, 2017 |access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref name="NYMag" /> The investigation linked @NasMaraj to the practice of "Tweetdecking", or using multiple accounts in collaboration to artificially make certain tweets go viral.

On June 17, 2020, Minaj responded to Nas, tweeting "It was a bit of a sting when you denied being a barb, but I understand. Congratulations on building up your confidence to speak your truth".

In late 2018, Lil Nas X landed on music as a path to success, and started writing and recording songs in his closet.<ref name=":8" /> He adopted the name Lil Nas X, which is a tribute to the rapper [[Nas]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Prahl |first1=Amanda |title=His Name Pays Tribute to a Famous Rapper |url=https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/photo-gallery/46339586/embed/46339575 |website=[[PopSugar]] |publisher=[[Group Nine Media]] |access-date=November 1, 2019 |date=July 2, 2019}}</ref> In late October 2018, he happened to hear the beat that would become "[[Old Town Road]]".<ref name=":8" />
