Gill attended high school at Oklahoma City's [[Northwest Classen High School]].

Afterwards he spent a brief amount of time in [[Ricky Skaggs]]'s Boone Creek band before moving to Los Angeles to join Sundance, a bluegrass group fronted by fiddler [[Byron Berline]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Career ==

Gill debuted on the national scene with the [[country rock]] band [[Pure Prairie League]] in 1979, appearing on that band's album ''[[Can't Hold Back (Pure Prairie League album)|Can't Hold Back]]''.

[[File:Albert Lee, Vince Gill + hosts in Australia, February 1988.jpg|thumb|Gill (right) with [[Albert Lee]] (left) and Australian tour promoters Ann and Andrew Pattison in Australia, 1988]]
Gill left Pure Prairie League in 1981 to join [[The Notorious Cherry Bombs|Cherry Bombs]], the stage band that backed [[Rodney Crowell]]. There he worked with Tony Brown and Emory Gordy Jr., both of whom would later produce many of his albums.<ref name=Official/> He recorded a bluegrass album, ''Here Today'', with [[David Grisman]] and friends before signing a solo deal with [[RCA Records|RCA]] with whom he achieved some success including the singles, "Victim of Life's Circumstance" (U.S. Country Top 40) and Country Top Ten with "If It Weren't for Him", "Oklahoma Borderline" and "Cinderella". However his albums achieved only moderate sales and in 1989, Gill left RCA to sign with [[MCA Records]]. Here, reunited with Tony Brown as producer, he sold over a million copies of his label debut, 1989's ''When I Call Your Name'', of which several songs, including the title track, made the U.S. Country charts' Top Ten / Top Twenty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vince-gill-mn0000214162/biography|title=Vince Gill - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref> This was followed by the similarly successful albums, ''Pocket Full of Gold'' (1991) and ''I Still Believe in You'', of which the title track went to U.S. Country No. 1.
