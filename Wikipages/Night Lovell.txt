'''Shermar Cuba Paul''' (born May 29, 1997),<ref>{{Cite web|title=Night Lovell – The Vogue|url=https://thevogue.com/artists/night-lovell/|access-date=2021-08-20|website=The Vogue|language=en}}</ref> known professionally as '''Night Lovell''', is a Canadian rapper, songwriter and record producer. His old record producer name was under the alias KLNV, standing for Killanov. He initially gained fame after his song ''Dark Light'' went viral in 2014. He has released four studio albums named ''Concept Vague'' on December 21, 2014, ''Red Teenage Melody'' on June 13, 2016, ''Goodnight Lovell'' on February 22, 2019, and recently ''Just Say You Don't Care'', released May 6, 2021. He was a featured artist on American YouTuber and musician [[Corpse Husband]]'s "[[Hot Demon B!tches Near U!!!|Hot Demon Bitches Near U ! ! !]]", which released on September 3, 2021.

As of 2021, Night Lovell had been streamed over 650 million times on Spotify.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-02-26|title=Night Lovell|url=https://audibletreats.com/night-lovell/|access-date=2021-08-20|website=Audible Treats|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
His musical style is often categorized by its dark and atmospheric sound. He has been described as "effortlessly conjur[ing] darkness".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Night Lovell returns from the shadows|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/02/22/night-lovell-returns-from-the-shadows|access-date=2021-08-19|website=[[The Fader]]|language=en}}</ref>

His songs have a brooding atmosphere, with the subject matter often revolving around themes of introspection and angst. This results in the pervasive dark tone that populates both the lyrics and instrumentation, which itself incorporates elements of drill, trap, and cloud rap, as well as ambient elements.
