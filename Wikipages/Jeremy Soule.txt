'''Jeremy Soule''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|oʊ|l}}) is an American composer of soundtracks for film, television, and video games. He has composed soundtracks for over 60 games and over a dozen other works during his career, including ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'', ''[[Guild Wars]]'', ''[[Icewind Dale]]'', and the ''[[Harry Potter video games|Harry Potter]]'' series.

He became an employee of [[Square (video game company)|Square]] in 1994 after several years of private composition studies. After finishing the soundtrack to ''[[Secret of Evermore]]'' in 1995, he left to join [[Humongous Entertainment]], where he composed for several children's games as well as ''[[Total Annihilation]]'', his first award-winning score. In 2000, he left to form his own music production company, Soule Media, now called Artistry Entertainment. In 2005, he founded DirectSong, a record label that published digital versions of his soundtracks as well as those of classical composers. DirectSong was subject to a class action lawsuit in 2015 but remained active until the late 2010s.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/jeremy-soule-kickstarter-northerner-symphony-release |title=Why is Skyrim composer Jeremy Soule’s $121,227 Kickstarter symphony still not finished five years later? {{!}} VG247<!-- Bot generated title --> |date=January 14, 2019 |access-date=October 23, 2021 |archive-date=October 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211023140044/https://www.vg247.com/jeremy-soule-kickstarter-northerner-symphony-release |url-status=live }}</ref>

Soule's works have been played in several live concerts such as the [[Symphonic Game Music Concert]] in Germany and the international ''[[Play! A Video Game Symphony]]'' concert series. While many of his works are [[orchestral]], he considers himself someone who creates more than just one type of music. Several of Soule's soundtracks have been created with the help of his brother, Julian.

==Early life==
Soule was born in [[Keokuk, Iowa]] to a public school music teacher father and a graphic designer mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras at the age of five.<ref name="SOULEsite"/><ref name="IGNint"/><ref name="GBJSoule">{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/jeremy-soule/72-17632|title=Jeremy Soule|publisher=Giant Bomb|access-date=January 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909214530/http://www.giantbomb.com/jeremy-soule/72-17632/|archive-date=September 9, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from [[Western Illinois University]] when he was in sixth grade.<ref name="GSint"/><ref name="GWVint"/> He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in [[Musical composition|composition]] before completing high school; however, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree.<ref name="GSint"/> He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how difficult it would be to do both.<ref name="IGNint"/>

While playing video games as a child, Soule came to believe that the experience they created could be greatly enhanced by having a better musical score.<ref name="IGNint"/> After completing high school, he took a year to create a portfolio showcasing what he felt video game scores should sound like. Soule sent the tape to [[LucasArts]] and [[Square (video game company)|Square]]. Square very much appreciated the portfolio; he does not believe that LucasArts ever listened to his tapes as they had a "no unsolicited package" policy.<ref name="GSint"/> Soule began working at Square in [[Seattle]] only two weeks after first submitting his demo tapes.<ref name="IGNint"/>

==Career==
===1990s===
Soule was promptly given the task by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] to score ''[[Secret of Evermore]]''. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) into the music and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound.<ref name="GSint"/> Part of the reason for this was that the sound program used in ''Evermore'' was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations.<ref name="M4Gint"/> When [[Ron Gilbert]] of LucasArts left to form his own company, [[Humongous Entertainment]], and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit Square to score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, ''[[Putt-Putt (game character)|Putt-Putt]]''; he was the company's third employee.<ref name="UGOint"/> Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the ''Putt-Putt'', ''[[Pajama Sam]]'', ''[[Freddi Fish]]'' and ''[[Spy Fox]]'' series.<ref name="SOULEsite"/>

While working at Humongous, Soule met fellow employee and video game designer [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]], and signed on to compose the soundtrack to his major project, ''[[Total Annihilation]]''. Soule convinced Taylor that, given the large number of other [[real-time strategy]] games coming out at the same time as ''Total Annihilation'' with [[techno]] scores, that to separate themselves they needed to do a large orchestral score. He went so far as to bet a year's worth of reduced pay that it would pay off; Gilbert felt that it did after the first sentence of the first review of the game he read was about the music.<ref name="M4Gint"/><ref name="GSint"/> Given the software limitations at the time, to make the sound work correctly required a full live orchestra, the first that Soule had ever worked with; the orchestral tracks in ''Evermore'' had been performed by Soule and his brother by themselves, two instruments at a time.<ref name="M4Gint"/> The soundtrack earned Soule his first award, that of "Best Music" of 1997 from [[GameSpot]] in their year-end awards.<ref name="GS1997award"/> Soule spent the next two years composing music for the game's two expansion packs and for children's games.<ref name="SOULEsite"/>

===2000s===
In February 2000, Jeremy and his brother, Julian, formed Soule Media as an independent music production company; its name has since been changed to Artistry Entertainment.<ref name="SOULEpageold"/> Julian works as a sound engineer and composer for the company, and has assisted Jeremy in several projects throughout his career, both credited and uncredited.<ref name="M4Gint"/><ref name="IGNint"/> The first large project that Jeremy Soule worked on through the company was 2000's ''[[Icewind Dale]]'', which won the best music of the year award from both [[IGN]] and [[GameSpot]].<ref name="IGN2000award"/><ref name="GS2000award"/>

In 2001, Soule scored the first of five ''[[Harry Potter]]'' games that he would work on between then and 2005. His first game, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] award for Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition, while ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' won and were nominated, respectively, for a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy of Film & Television Arts]] award for Best Score in the Game Music Category.<ref name="AIAS2001"/><ref name="BAFTA2003"/><ref name="BAFTA2004"/> The other games he composed for that year include ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]'' and ''[[Azurik: Rise of Perathia]]'', which he later described as a bad game lifted up in the eyes of testers and reviewers by good music.<ref name="GSUKint"/> He was responsible for composing the soundtracks to three top-selling role-playing games in 2002, those of ''[[Dungeon Siege]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'', and ''[[Neverwinter Nights (2002 video game)|Neverwinter Nights]]''; ''Morrowind'' earned him his second Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award nomination.<ref name="AIAS2002"/>

Soule was in a major car accident in the mid 2000s, during which he had a momentary realisation that life is precious. In interview, he described a vision of "Native American warriors" that he saw during the crash. The highway patrolman who arrived at the scene also invited him to meet a chief of the nearby [[Lummi Nation]] reservation who composed music. Soule stated that the experience provided inspiration during his subsequent compositions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-12-capturing-the-dragon-the-music-of-jeremy-soule |title=Capturing the dragon: the music of Jeremy Soule • Eurogamer.net<!-- Bot generated title --> |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=April 12, 2013 |access-date=May 14, 2020 |archive-date=May 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200520205525/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-12-capturing-the-dragon-the-music-of-jeremy-soule |url-status=live }}</ref>

Artistry Entertainment scored a string of highly successful games through the remainder of the decade, including the ''[[Guild Wars]]'' series, ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (video game)|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War]]'', and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]''.<ref name="SOULEsite"/> ''Oblivion'' was an award-winning soundtrack by Soule. It was nominated for the 2006 British Academy of Film & Television Arts and Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awards, and won the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video Game Score|MTV Video Music Awards]] and [[Official Xbox Magazine]] soundtrack awards.<ref name="BAFTA2006"/><ref name="AIAS2007"/><ref name="MTVVMA2006"/><ref name="OXM2006"/> Soule also worked on another of Chris Taylor's real-time strategy titles in 2007, with the launch of ''[[Supreme Commander (game)|Supreme Commander]]''.<ref name="SOULEsite"/>

In 2005, Jeremy and Julian Soule founded DirectSong, a company which sold [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free downloads of compositions as well as works by dozens of classical composers. By 2007 the company had grown to over one million registered customers, though Soule noted that not all of those customers resulted in a sale of a non-free product.<ref name="M4Gint"/>  Soule says that the traffic numbers for DirectSong had surpassed some major record labels at times.<ref name="GSUKint"/> Soule also used DirectSong to sell "expansion packs" of music for games such as ''Guild Wars'' that could be played in game like the rest of the soundtrack. He estimates that at least 10% of the players of ''Guild Wars'' bought his musical expansion for the game, ''Battle Pak 1''. DirectSong struggled to fulfill orders or provide timely support, resulting in an "F" rating by the [[Better Business Bureau]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Better Business Bureau | title = DirectSong Business Review in Lake Stevens, WA | url = http://www.bbb.org/western-washington/business-reviews/compact-discs-tapes-and-records-retail/directsong-in-lake-stevens-wa-22685930 | access-date = November 28, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005508/http://www.bbb.org/western-washington/business-reviews/compact-discs-tapes-and-records-retail/directsong-in-lake-stevens-wa-22685930 | archive-date = December 3, 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===2010s===
Soule worked on several major titles in the early 2010s, including ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars 2]]''. The ''Skyrim'' soundtrack in particular is among Soule's most critically acclaimed pieces of work, receiving a BAFTA nomination as well as numerous other awards from organizations such as the Game Audio Network Guild.<ref name="BAFTA2012"/> Soule would also go on to compose the music for two of the official DLC packs for the game, ''Dragonborn'' and ''Dawnguard'', both released in 2012. The ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'' soundtrack was released a four-disc box set collection and well received.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/unboxing-the-four-disc-guild-wars-2-soundtrack/ |title=Unboxing the four-disc Guild Wars 2 soundtrack |date=September 28, 2012 |access-date=October 23, 2021 |archive-date=October 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211023203442/https://www.destructoid.com/unboxing-the-four-disc-guild-wars-2-soundtrack/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Soule was replaced as lead composer on the project later that year, with subsequent releases (such as expansions) being composed by [[Maclaine Diemer]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://dynamedion.com/services/live-recording/maclaine-diemer/ |title=Maclaine Diemer – DYNAMEDION |access-date=October 23, 2021 |archive-date=October 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211023202630/https://dynamedion.com/services/live-recording/maclaine-diemer/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 2013, Soule launched a [[Kickstarter]] project to fund a classical music album called ''The Northerner: Soule Symphony No. 1'', seeking $10,000 for the album.<ref name="kickstarter"/> The campaign ultimately raised a total of $121,227.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1|title=From the Composer of Skyrim – Soule Symphony No. 1|work=Kickstarter|access-date=March 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306152712/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The project features vocals in [[Old Norse]], with Soule citing the successful use of the similar [[Icelandic language]] by [[Malukah]] in one of her own projects during development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1/posts/835364|title=From the Composer of Skyrim – Soule Symphony No. 1 by Max Steiner Agency Inc. — Kickstarter|work=Kickstarter|access-date=March 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307192940/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1/posts/835364|archive-date=March 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> For the project, Soule indicated that his company were developing new audio technology.<ref name="kickstarter.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1/posts/1500157|title=From the Composer of Skyrim – Soule Symphony No. 1 by Max Steiner Agency Inc. — Kickstarter|work=Kickstarter|access-date=March 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401131501/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1/posts/1500157|archive-date=April 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Soule began accepting refunds in 2016– with the project releasing an album of "sketches" in 2017.

The soundtrack was available as part of the ''Compendium'', a pack of digitally-distributed content that funded the prize pool for [[The International 2015]] tournament, which took place in August 2015 and ultimately featured the largest prize-pool in e-sports history, with over $18,000,000 in total.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dota2.com/international/compendium/|title=Dota 2 – The International Compendium|work=Dota2.com|access-date=March 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322195528/http://www.dota2.com/international/compendium|archive-date=March 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the late 2010s, Soule composed soundtracks for several indie titles. This included the episodic virtual reality game ''[[The Gallery (video game)|The Gallery]]'' (2016–17).<ref name=galleries>{{cite web|access-date=March 18, 2020|url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/101705/vr-adventure-the-gallery-heart-of-the-emberstone-gets-launch-trailer|publisher=Shack News|date=October 13, 2017|title=VR Adventure The Gallery: Heart of the Emberstone Gets Launch Trailer|author=Singletary Jr, Charles|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723041754/http://www.shacknews.com/article/101705/vr-adventure-the-gallery-heart-of-the-emberstone-gets-launch-trailer|archive-date=July 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''[[Consortium: The Tower]]'' (2018). In 2015 Soule's DirectSong service was targeted by a class-action lawsuit, brought by members of the ''Guild Wars 2'' community, due to long wait times- with some users waiting four years for albums to arrive after purchase.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In August 2019, Soule was accused of rape by game designer [[Nathalie Lawhead]].<ref>{{cite

distribution platform DirectSong was also seemingly taken offline around this time.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Legacy==
Soule's music has been played in several live concerts. His music from ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' was performed on August 20, 2003, at the first ''[[Symphonic Game Music Concert]]'' in Leipzig, Germany, and his music from ''Morrowind'' was performed at the third ''Symphonic Game Music Concert'' on August 17, 2005.<ref name="SymphProg"/> Selections of his pieces from ''Morrowind'' and ''Oblivion'' are played in the international concert series ''[[Play! A Video Game Symphony]]''. Jeremy Soule attended the world-premiere of Play! on May 27, 2006 in Chicago.<ref name="nsider"/> Music from ''Oblivion'' has also been played at the ''Press Start 2007 -Symphony of Games-'' concerts in September 2007 in Japan.<ref name="PressStart"/> The first live orchestral concert dedicated to Soule's music for "Skyrim" took place on November 16, 2016 at London's Palladium theater.<ref name="GamesRadar">[http://www.gamesradar.com/a-live-skyrim-concert-with-bonus-oblivion-and-morrowind-music-is-coming-to-london-on-nov-16 "A live Skyrim concert with bonus Oblivion and Morrowind music is coming to London on Nov. 16"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724064129/http://www.gamesradar.com/a-live-skyrim-concert-with-bonus-oblivion-and-morrowind-music-is-coming-to-london-on-nov-16/ |date=July 24, 2017 }} GamesRadar.com.  Accessed November 3, 2016.</ref> Soule's music has been featured in numerous top-selling games; he once estimated in an interview that around 10 million games with his music in them were sold in 2006 alone.<ref name="Pronounce"/>

Selections of remixes of Soule's work appear on English remixing websites such as [[OverClocked ReMix]].<ref name="OCR"/> Soule is a supporter of the game music arrangement community, even going so far as to submit his own [[arrangement]] to OverClocked ReMix. He did so to help promote and inspire younger and newer composers. The track, "Squaresoft Variation", arranges the ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' piece "Terra"; Soule has said that he chose the piece to remix because when he first started at Square he spent some time debugging the game before his composition duties for ''Evermore'' started.<ref name="M4Gint"/><ref name="Squaresoft Variation"/>

==Musical style and influences==
Soule rarely gets to see the game he is composing for in any sort of completed state before he begins work; as a result he bases many of his musical decisions on the company's previous games. He credits his success with this strategy to the fact that many of the games he works on come from studios that have created several successful games in the past.<ref name="GSint"/> He finds it much easier to compose a soundtrack to a game that is very visual in nature, such as a [[role-playing game]].<ref name="IGNint"/> He also likes to see the storyboards and concept art for the game, as he considers them a good provider of "pure emotional intent" for the game.<ref name="GWVint"/> When composing a soundtrack, the first thing that he decides is the tempo and the amount of energy the music will have; this decision is as much based on the genre of the game as it is the artistic style of the game.<ref name="GSint"/> After that, Soule starts composing smaller tracks in the soundtrack, to make sure that they match up with the vision of the game before he starts on the major themes.<ref name="M4Gint"/> Soule tries to compose all of a game's soundtrack himself rather than in a team, though he sometimes collaborates with his brother.<ref name="GWVint"/>

Although many of his works are orchestral in nature, Soule has denied that it is his "style", as he feels that the term boxes him into only creating one type of music. He prefers to call himself a "music practitioner", or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music as he is capable of many styles, such as [[J-pop|Japanese pop]], which he has written along with [[Jeff Miyahara]]. Soule considers music to be like a language, which can be arranged in many different ways if you understand the structure.<ref name="RPGFint"/> He does not have a favorite genre of game to compose for, preferring instead to compose for "ambitious" games by people with "new ideas".<ref name="GSUKint"/>

Soule's greatest musical influences are "[[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s exploration of harmony", "[[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s grand operas", and "[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s form and composition".<ref name="IGNint"/> While many of his orchestral works are based on [[Film score|movie scores]] in terms of scope, he does not often listen to movie scores, though he names his favorite composer as [[John Williams]].<ref name="IGNint"/><ref name="GSint"/> The influence has been noted by critics, who have termed Soule "the John Williams of video game music".<ref name="M4Gint"/> Among [[video game music]] influences, he has cited [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for providing him "with the education for what quality means to this business" and [[Nobuo Uematsu]] in particular.<ref name="RPGFint"/> His favorite style of music to listen to is [[Britpop|British pop]] and rock music, while his favorite video games are the ones that he has written scores to, especially the ones made by [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]], though one of his all-time favorites is ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''. He has said that the games he would most like to work on that he has not already are ones by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], a ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game, and a ''[[Metroid]]'' game.<ref name="GSint"/>
