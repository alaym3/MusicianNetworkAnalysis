'''Gilberto Passos Gil Moreira''' (born 26 June 1942), known professionally as '''Gilberto Gil''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒiwˈbɛʁtu ˈʒiw|br}}), is a [[Brazil]]ian singer, guitarist, and songwriter, known for both his musical innovation and political activism. From 2003 to 2008, he served as Brazil's [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Minister of Culture]] in the administration of President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. Gil's musical style incorporates an eclectic range of influences, including rock, [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian genres]] including [[samba]], [[Music of Africa|African music]], and [[reggae]].

Gil started to play music as a child and was a teenager when he joined his first band. He began his career as a [[bossa nova]] musician and grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the [[Música popular brasileira]] and [[Tropicalismo|tropicália]] movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator [[Caetano Veloso]]. The [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|Brazilian military regime]] that [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|took power]] in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to [[Bahia]] in 1972 and continued his musical career, as well as worked as a politician and environmental advocate.

== Early life (1942–1963) ==
Gil was born in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and spent much of his childhood in [[Ituaçu]]. Ituaçu was a small town of fewer than a thousand people, located in the [[sertão]], or countryside, of Bahia.<ref name=katz>{{cite journal |last=Katz |first=David |author-link=David Katz (author) |author2=Gil, Gilberto |date=July–August 2009 |title=Truth to Power |journal=[[Wax Poetics]] |issue=36 |pages=48–60 |publisher=Wax Poetics, Inc. |location=[[Brooklyn]], New York City |issn=1537-8241 }}</ref> His father, José Gil Moreira, was a doctor; his mother, Claudina Passos Gil Moreira, an elementary school teacher.<ref name=katz/><ref name=tepel>{{cite web |url=http://www.culturebase.net/artist.php?3800 |title=Gilberto Gil |access-date=2008-03-15 |last=Tepel |first=Oliver |date=August 7, 2006 |work=The international artist database |publisher=culturebase.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120012716/http://www.culturebase.net/artist.php?3800 |archive-date=November 20, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As a young boy, he attended a [[Marist Brothers]] school.<ref>Veloso (2003), p. 180</ref> Gil remained in Ituaçu until he was nine years old, returning to Salvador for secondary school.

Gil's interest in music was precocious: "When I was only two or two and a half", he recalled, "I told my mother I was going to become a musician or president of my country".<ref name=quinn>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Quinn |title=Mixing Miami With Copacabana |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A73901 |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=September 17, 1999 |access-date=2008-03-24 }}</ref> He grew up listening to the [[forró]] music of his native northeast,<ref name=tepel/> and took an interest in the street performers of Salvador.<ref name=skelly>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p6573/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography |access-date=2008-03-16 |last=Skelly |first=Richard |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[All Media Guide]]}}</ref> Early on, he began to play the drums and the trumpet, through listening to Bob Nelson on the radio.<ref name=tourneen>{{cite web |url=http://www.ejn.it/mus/gil.htm |title=Gilberto Gil |access-date=2008-03-16 |last=Tourneen |first=Saudades |work=Europe Jazz Network |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321161024/http://www.ejn.it/mus/gil.htm |archive-date=March 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Gil's mother was the "chief supporter" in his musical ambitions; she bought him an [[accordion]] and, when he was ten years old, sent him to music school in Salvador which he attended for four years.<ref name=katz/><ref name=quinn/> As an accordionist, Gil first played classical music, but grew more interested in the folk and popular music of Brazil.<ref name=katz/> He was particularly influenced by singer and accordion player [[Luiz Gonzaga]]; he began to sing and play the accordion in an emulation of Gonzaga's recordings.<ref name=wald>Wald (2007), pp. 113–116</ref> Gil has noted that he grew to identify with Gonzaga "because he sang about the world around [him], the world that [he] encountered".<ref name="myers">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=Robert|author2=Gil, Gilberto|year=1990|title=Brazilian Popular Music in Bahia: 'The Politics of the Future': An Interview with Gilberto Gil|journal=Studies in Latin American Popular Culture|location=[[Austin, Texas]]|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|volume=9|pages=298–311|issn=0730-9139}}<!--|access-date=2010-07-27 --></ref>

During his years in Salvador, Gil encountered the music of songwriter [[Dorival Caymmi]], who he says represented to him the "beach-oriented" samba music of Salvador.<ref name=myers/> Gonzaga and Caymmi were Gil's formative influences.<ref name=katz/> While in Salvador, Gil was introduced to many other styles of music, including American [[big band]] jazz and [[tango music|tango]].<ref name=myers/> In 1950 Gil moved back to Salvador with his family. It was there, while in high school, that he joined his first band, Os Desafinados ("The Out of Tunes"), in which he played accordion and vibraphone and sang.<ref name=katz/> Os Desafinados was influenced by American rock and roll musicians like Elvis Presley, as well as singing groups from Rio de Janeiro.<ref name=katz/> The band was active for two to three years. Soon afterwards, inspired by Brazilian musician [[João Gilberto]], he settled on the guitar as his primary instrument and began to play bossa nova.<ref name=skelly/>

== Musical career (1963–present) ==

Gil met guitarist and singer [[Caetano Veloso]] at the [[Universidade Federal da Bahia]] (Federal University of Bahia) in 1963. The two began collaborating and performing together, releasing a single and EP.<ref name=tepel/> Along with [[Maria Bethânia]] (Veloso's sister), [[Gal Costa]], and [[Tom Zé]], Gil and Veloso performed bossa nova and traditional Brazilian songs at the Vila Velha Theatre's opening night in July 1964, a show entitled ''Nós, por Exemplo'' ("Us, for Example").<ref name=tourneen/> Gil and the group continued to perform at the venue and he eventually became a musical director of the concert series.<ref>Veloso (2003), p. 46</ref> Gil collaborated again with members of this collective on the landmark 1968 album ''[[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses]]'', whose style was influenced by The Beatles' ''[[Sgt.

Early on in the 1960s, Gil earned income primarily from selling bananas in a shopping mall and composing [[jingle]]s for television advertisements;<ref name=skelly/> he was also briefly employed by the Brazilian division of [[Unilever]], Gessy-Lever.<ref name=tourneen/> He moved to [[São Paulo]] in 1965 and had a [[hit single]] when his song "Louvação" (which later appeared on the [[Louvação|album of the same name]]) was released by [[Elis Regina]]. His first hit as a solo artist was the 1969 song "[[Aquele Abraço]]".<ref name=skelly/> Gil also performed on several television programs throughout the 1960s, which often included other "tropicalistas", members of the Tropicalismo movement.<ref name=tourneen/> One of these programs, ''Divino Maravilhoso'', which featured Veloso, gained attention from government television censors after it aired a satirical version of the national anthem in December 1968.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dunn |first=Christopher |author2=Veloso, Caetano |author-link2=Caetano Veloso  |year=1996 |title=The Tropicalista Rebellion |journal=Transition |issue=70 |pages=116–138 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=[[Bloomington, Indiana]] |issn=0041-1191 |jstor=2935353 }}</ref>

In February 1969 Gil and Veloso were arrested by the [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|Brazilian military government]], brought from São Paulo to [[Rio de Janeiro]], and spent three months in prison and another four under house arrest,<ref name=katz/><ref name=goodman/> before being freed on the condition that they leave the country. Veloso was the first to be arrested; the police moved to Gil's home soon afterward. Veloso had directed his then-wife Andréa Gadelha to warn Gil about the possibility of arrest, but Gil was eventually brought into the police van along with Veloso.<ref>Veloso (2003), pp. 219–220</ref> They were given no reason or charge for their arrest.<ref name=katz/> Gil believes that the government felt his actions "represent[ed] a threat [to them], something new, something that can't quite be understood, something that doesn't fit into any of the clear compartments of existing cultural practices, and that won't do.

The appointment was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism.<ref name=rohter>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Rohter |author-link=Larry Rohter |title=A Government Gig for Brazilian Pop Star; Gilberto Gil Becomes Culture Minister, But Not Everyone Sings His Praises |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFD8143FF932A05751C1A9649C8B63 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716110817/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFD8143FF932A05751C1A9649C8B63 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 16, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 31, 2002 |access-date=2008-04-11 }}</ref> Gil had not been a member of Lula's [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] and had not participated in creating its cultural program.<ref name=rohter/> Shortly after becoming Minister, Gil began a partnership between Brazil and [[Creative Commons]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/2008/06/25/gilberto-gil-on-democracy-now/ | publisher = Creative Commons | title = Gilberto Gil on Democracy Now | date = June 25, 2008 | access-date= 21 February 2021}}</ref> In 2003, he gave a concert in the UN General Assembly in honour of the victims of the [[Bombing of UN Headquarters in Baghdad|bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2003/note5812.doc.htm|title = MEMORIAL TRIBUTE CONCERT BY GILBERTO GIL TO BE HELD AT UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS &#124; Meetings Coverage and Press Releases}}</ref> In that concert, he played together with Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/31/music-language-human-rights-political-diplomacy|title=How music is the real language of political diplomacy|date=October 31, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5-33YIVYC4| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/C5-33YIVYC4| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=Toda menina baiana|access-date=October 22, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Gil has been married four times. He had two daughters Nara and Marilia, with first wife Belina Aguiar, he was then married to famous singer [[Nana Caymmi]], they had no children. His third wife was Sandra Gadelha with whom he had three children: Pedro, Preta and Maria. Sandra inspired one of his most beloved songs Drao, she was with him during the very hard times of Brazilian dictatorship and they both were exiled. His fourth wife is Flora Giordano. The couple has three children: Bem, Isabella and Jose.  His first son Pedro Gil, [[Egotrip (band)|Egotrip]]'s drummer&nbsp;– died in a car accident in 1990.<ref name=astor>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Astor |title=Brazilian pop star Gil tours U.S. |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2007-03-16-2248300129_x.htm |work=[[Associated Press]] via [[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |location=[[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] |date=March 16, 2007 |access-date=2008-05-17 }}</ref> [[Preta Gil]], an actress and singer, is his daughter with Sandra Gadelha.

Gil's religious beliefs have changed significantly over his lifetime. Originally, he was a Christian, but was later influenced by [[Eastern philosophy]] and religion, and, later, explored African spirituality. He is an agnostic.<ref name=astor/> He practices yoga and is a vegetarian.<ref name=goodman/>

Gil has been open about the fact that he has smoked [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] for much of his life. He has said he believes "that drugs should be treated like pharmaceuticals, legalized, although under the same regulations and monitoring as medicines".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/12873 |title=Brazilians Reject Marijuana Legalization |author=Staff |access-date=2008-03-23 |date=August 22, 2006 |work=Angus Reid Global Monitor |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306134420/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/12873 |archive-date=March 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

== Musical style and influences ==
{{Listen
|filename     = Gilberto_Gil_-_Oslodum_sample.ogg
|title        = "Oslodum"
|description  = Gil recorded "Oslodum" for the 2004 compilation album ''[[The Wired CD]]'', an album composed of songs licensed under the [[Creative Commons]]. The song is heavily influenced by [[samba reggae]], one of the many elements of Gil's style. The title is a play on the name [[Olodum]], a major [[samba reggae]] cultural group based in [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], Bahia, Brazil.}}
Gil is a [[tenor]], but he sings in the [[baritone]] or [[falsetto]] register, with lyrics and/or scat syllables. His lyrics are on subjects that range from philosophy to religion, folktales, and [[word play]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Rohter |author-link=Larry Rohter |title=Gilberto Gil, Bahia's Most Beloved Export |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDB113AF93BA35752C1A964958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 8, 1992 |access-date=2008-03-24 }}</ref> Gil's musical style incorporates a broad range of influences. The first music he was exposed to included The Beatles and street performers in various metropolitan areas of Bahia. During his first years as a musician, Gil performed primarily in a blend of traditional Brazilian styles with [[two-step (dance move)|two-step]] rhythms, such as [[Baião (music)|baião]] and [[samba]].<ref name=quinn/> He states that "My first phase was one of traditional forms. Nothing experimental at all. Caetano [Veloso] and I followed in the tradition of [[Luiz Gonzaga]] and [[Jackson do Pandeiro]], combining samba with northeastern music."<ref name=quinn/> American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] said that along with [[Jorge Ben]], Gil was "always ready to go further out on a beat than the other samba/bossa geniuses".<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=6 April 1993|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv393-93.php|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=12 August 2018}}</ref>

As one of the pioneers of tropicália, influences from genres such as rock and [[punk rock|punk]] have been pervasive in his recordings, as they have been in those of other stars of the period, including Caetano Veloso and Tom Zé. Gil's interest in the [[blues]]-based music of rock pioneer [[Jimi Hendrix]], in particular, has been described by Veloso as having "extremely important consequences for Brazilian music".<ref name=veloso>Veloso (2003), p. 191</ref> Veloso also noted the influence of Brazilian guitarist and singer [[Jorge Ben Jor|Jorge Ben]] on Gil's musical style, coupled with that of traditional music.<ref name=veloso/> After the height of tropicália in the 1960s, Gil became increasingly interested in black culture, particularly in the Jamaican musical genre of [[reggae]]. He described the genre as "a form of democratizing, internationalizing, speaking a new language, a [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]] form of passing along fundamental messages".<ref name=behague>{{cite journal |last=Béhague |first=Gerard |author-link=Gerard Béhague |date= Spring–Summer 2006 |title=Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985–95) |journal= Latin American Music Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages= 79–90 |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/latin_american_music_review/v027/27.1behague08.html |doi=10.1353/lat.2006.0021 |s2cid=191430137 }}</ref>

Visiting [[Lagos]], Nigeria, in 1976 for the Festival of African Culture (FESTAC), Gil met fellow musicians [[Fela Kuti]] and [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref name=katz/> He became inspired by African music and later integrated some of the styles he had heard in Africa, such as [[juju]] and [[highlife]], into his own recordings.<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff |title='Brazil has a new energy' |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/07/01/bmgil01.xml |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041210094748/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2003%2F07%2F01%2Fbmgil01.xml |url-status= dead |archive-date= December 10, 2004 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=July 1, 2003 |access-date= 2008-05-03 }}</ref> One of the most famous of these African-influenced records was the 1977 album ''Refavela'', which included "No Norte da Saudade" (''To the North of Sadness''), a song heavily influenced by reggae.<ref>Crook (2005), p. 82</ref> When Gil returned to Brazil after the visit, he focused on Afro-Brazilian culture, becoming a member of the Carnaval afoxé group Filhos de Gandhi.

Conversely, his 1980s musical repertoire presented an increased development of dance trends, such as [[disco]] and [[soul music|soul]], as well as the previous incorporation of rock and punk.<ref name=behague/> However, Gil says that his 1994 album ''Acoustic'' was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/multi/interview/ID/6 |title=Interview: Gilberto Gil (1995) |access-date=2008-05-03 |last=Eyre |first=Banning |author2=Gil, Gilberto |date=June 3, 1995 |work=Afropop Worldwide |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513214850/http://www.afropop.org/multi/interview/ID/6 |archive-date=May 13, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.<ref name=behague/>
