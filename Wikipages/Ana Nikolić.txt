==Life and career==
Ana Nikolić was born in [[Jagodina]] on September 27, 1978, but was raised in [[Paraćin]] where she graduated from [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. She rose to prominence in the national selection festival for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]], called [[Beovizija 2003|Beovizija]] with the song 'Januar' (''January''), finishing seventh. However, Nikolić managed to sign a recording contract with [[City Records]] and to release her debut album of the same title in August the following year. She then returned for [[Beovizija 2006]], finishing as the runner-up with 'Romale, romali', which was later included to her sophomore release, ''[[Devojka od čokolade]]'' (''Girl Made Of Chocolate''). Nikolić also reached final of [[Beovizija 2009]] with 'Bili smo najlepši' (''We Were the Most Beautiful''), but following a suspicious voting process decided not to take part further more. In 2010, she saw great commercial success with the forthcoming album, titled ''Mafia Caffe''.

In April 2012, Nikolić released single "Baksuze" (''Jinx''). In July 2013, she released ''Milion dolara'' (''Million Dollars''). In July 2015, Nikolić released single "Voli me, voli me" (''Love Me, Love Me'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hellomagazin.rs/celebrity-news/domace-vesti/posle-severine-i-natase-na-redu-je-ana-nikolic-premijera-pesme-voli-me-voli-me-video/|title=Posle Severine i Nataše na redu je Ana Nikolić!
