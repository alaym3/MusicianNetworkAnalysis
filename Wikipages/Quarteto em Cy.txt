'''Quarteto em Cy''' (a play on words of the Portuguese for ''Quartet in B'' by poet and lyricist [[Vinicius de Moraes]]) is a Brazilian [[girl group]] originally composed of four sisters hailing from [[Ibirataia]], a town located in the Brazilian state of [[Bahia]]: Cybele, Cylene, Cynara and Cyva – their real first names.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/quarteto-em-cy-mn0000859045 ''ALLMUSIC, Quarteto em Cy'']</ref>

== History ==

They started performing in 1959, appearing on local television in that year. Cyva, the leader of the group, then moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]], and persuaded her three sisters to join her there. They then started to make regular appearances in the ''boates'' (small nightclubs) of Rio, particularly ''Bottle's bar'' and the legendary ''Zum-Zum'', where they caught the attention of de Moraes and other prominent figures of the [[bossa nova]] scene. Their first album was released in 1964, and was to be followed by regular releases up to the late '90s, at the frequency of one a year, and sometimes more. Connoisseurs of [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] and [[tropicalia]] have a particular regard for the first few years of their recording career, when they were signed to Brazil's most daring label, [[Elenco]].

The Quarteto em Cy, noted for the extraordinary precision of the vocalists' intonation and delivery, performed and recorded with almost every single major Brazilian artist of the '60s and '70s; their popularity exceeded and still exceeds the borders of their native country. They met with great success in America in the mid-sixties, and have a considerable following in Japan, where they still tour regularly.

The line-up of the quartet (which briefly split up, from 1970 to 1972) has changed a great deal over the years. However, the current formation (Cyva, Cybele, Cynara and Sonya) has been active since 1980, by far the most stable period in the group's history<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://gianzinho-culturabrasil.blogspot.it/2013/06/il-quarteto-em-cy-festeggia-i-50-anni.html ''Il Quarteto em Cy festeggia 50 anni di carriera con un libro e un CD curato da Dori Caymmi'']</ref>

On 21 August 2014 Cybele died of a [[lung]] [[ischemia]] at her home in Rio de Janeiro. She was 74.
