'''Eddie James Kendrick''' (December 17, 1939<ref name=rockandrollroadmap/> – October 5, 1992),<ref name="AllMusic"/> best known by the stage name '''Eddie Kendricks''', was an American singer and [[songwriter]]. Noted for his distinctive [[falsetto]] singing style, Kendricks co-founded the [[Motown Records|Motown]] singing group [[the Temptations]], and was one of their lead singers from 1960 until 1971. He was the lead voice on such famous songs as "[[The Way You Do the Things You Do]]", "[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]", and "[[Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)]]".  As a solo artist, Kendricks recorded several hits of his own during the 1970s, including the number-one single "[[Keep On Truckin' (song)|Keep On Truckin']]".

==Life and career==
===Early years: 1939–1960===
Kendricks was born to Johnny and Lee Bell Kendrick<ref name=nytimes>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/07/obituaries/eddie-kendricks-52-sang-with-the-temptations.html|title=Eddie Kendricks, 52; Sang With the Temptations|date=October 7, 1992|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 12, 2020}}</ref> in [[Union Springs, Alabama]] on December 17, 1939.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=145/6}}</ref> He had one sister, Patricia, and three brothers, Charles, Robert, and Clarence.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} His family moved to the [[Ensley (Birmingham)|Ensley]] neighborhood of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], where he met and began singing with his best friend [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]] in their church choir in the late 1940s. In 1955, Kendricks, Williams, and friends [[Kell Osborne]] and Jerome Averette formed a doo-wop group called the Cavaliers, and began performing around Birmingham. The group decided to move for better opportunities in their musical careers, and in 1957 the group moved to [[Cleveland]], Ohio on E 123rd and Kinsman. In Cleveland, they met manager Milton Jenkins, and soon moved with Jenkins to [[Detroit]], Michigan, where the Cavaliers renamed themselves the Primes.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Under Jenkins' management, the Primes were successful in the Detroit area, eventually creating a female spin-off group called the Primettes (later [[the Supremes]]). In 1961, Osbourne moved to California, and the Primes disbanded. Kendricks and Paul Williams joined forces with members Elbridge “Al” Bryant, [[Otis Williams]] and [[Melvin Franklin|Melvin "Blue" Franklin]] of Otis Williams and the Distants after two members quit and became the Elgins, who on the same day changed their name to the Temptations and signed to Motown.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===The Temptations: 1960–1971===
{{main|The Temptations}}
The Temptations began singing background for [[Mary Wells]]. After an initial dry period, the Temptations quickly became the most successful male vocal group of the 1960s. Although technically Kendricks was [[tenor|first tenor]] in the group's harmony, he often sang in the falsetto register.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Among the Temptations songs Kendricks sang lead on were "[[(You're My) Dream Come True|Dream Come True]]" (1962), the group's first charting single; "[[The Way You Do the Things You Do]]" (1964),<ref name="LarkinSM"/> the group's first US Top 20 hit; "[[I'll Be in Trouble]]" (1964); "[[The Girl's Alright With Me]]" (1964), a popular [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] that Kendricks co-wrote; "[[Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)]]" (1964); "[[Get Ready (1966 song)|Get Ready]]" (1966);<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "[[Please Return Your Love to Me]]" (1968); and "[[Just My Imagination]]" (1971).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> He was also allowed to sing a few leads in his lower registers such as "[[May I Have This Dance]]" (1962). He shared lead vocal duty on other records, including "[[You're My Everything (The Temptations song)|You're My Everything]]" (1967) (shared with [[David Ruffin]]), and a long string of [[Norman Whitfield]] [[record producer|produced]] [[psychedelic soul]] records where all five Temptations sang lead, such as the Grammy winner "[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations song)|Cloud Nine]]" (1968), "[[I Can't Get Next to You]]" (1969), and "[[Ball of Confusion]]" (1970). He also leads on "[[I'm Gonna Make You Love Me]]" (1968), a popular duet with [[The Supremes|Diana Ross and the Supremes]], and on the Temptations' version of the Christmas classic "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]" (1968).

In the Temptations, Kendricks was responsible for creating most of the group's vocal arrangements, and also served as wardrobe manager, including the now famous purple suits the group wore for one performance. Though Whitfield had chief responsibility for writing, Kendricks co-wrote and received credit for several Temptations songs apart from "[[The Girl's Alright With Me]]" including "[[Isn't She Pretty]]" (1961) and "Don't Send Me Away" (1967). His favorite food was [[cornbread]], and as a result he was nicknamed "Cornbread" (or '''"Corn"''' for short) by his groupmates. According to [[Otis Williams]], Kendricks romantically pursued [[Diana Ross]], lead singer of the Supremes, and he was said to have been close friends with [[Martha Reeves]] of the Vandellas. In her second book, ''Supreme Faith'', Supremes singer [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] writes that she and Kendricks were lovers "briefly," but remained close friends.

Kendricks remained in the group through the rest of the decade, but a number of issues began to push him away from it in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was uncomfortable with singing the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] style that Whitfield was now crafting for the group as opposed to the romantic ballads they had sung under the direction of Smokey Robinson;<ref name="LarkinSM"/> his friend Paul Williams was often too ill to perform with the group; and Kendricks often found himself at odds with bandmates [[Otis Williams]] and [[Melvin Franklin]]. As he grew away from the group, Kendricks began to rekindle his friendship with ex-Temptation [[David Ruffin]], who convinced him to leave.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In a 1991 interview with a [[Chicago]] television series called ''Urban Street'', Kendricks said he had actually considered leaving the group as early as 1965, even though that was when the band was finally starting to take off, because of things that "weren't quite proper." He explained that they were working with people that "didn't have their best interests at heart." Kendricks, however, initially decided to stay in the group because he was worried he would not get the support he needed if he left. He also stated that his relationship with [[Berry Gordy]] was less than cordial. "Berry Gordy is a man I don't know, I only met him about three times," he said, but "I know he didn't particularly care for me." Kendricks stated that he did not agree with many decisions that were made.

Following one final altercation with Williams and Franklin during a run at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] nightclub in November 1970, Kendricks walked off after the first night and did not return, and it was mutually decided he would leave the group.<ref name="Otis book">[[Otis Williams|Williams, Otis]] and Romanowski, Patricia (1988, updated 2002). ''Temptations''. Lanham, MD: Cooper Square. {{ISBN|0-8154-1218-5}}.</ref> While working on his first solo album, Kendricks recorded one last hit single with the Temptations, 1971's "[[Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)]]". By the time the record reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]] in April 1971, Kendricks had signed a solo deal with Motown's Tamla imprint and was preparing the release of his first solo album, ''All By Myself''.<ref name="AllMusic">{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-kendricks-mn0000170211/biography|title=Artist Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2017-09-25|first=Alex|last=Henderson}}</ref> However, many of his problems with Motown would reoccur.

===Solo career and later years: 1971–1992===
Kendricks' solo career began slowly; he endured two years of singles that missed the Top 40, while the Temptations continued with their string of Norman Whitfield-helmed hits (one of which, "[[Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)]]", was written as a jab towards Kendricks and Ruffin). Despite enjoying only a modicum of commercial success and radio airplay, Kendricks's 1972 album ''People... Hold On'' (recorded with his touring group, the Young Senators, composed of Jimi Dougans, Frank Hooker, LeRoy Fleming, [[Wornell Jones]], David Lecraft, James Drummer Johnson and John Engram) was a cornerstone of DJ playlists in downtown New York's nascent [[disco]] scene. The expansive, eight-minute take on "Girl, You Need A Change Of Mind", which peaked at number 13 on the soul chart,<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=319}}</ref> was a particular favorite at [[David Mancuso]]'s Loft. The single was later remade by R&B singer [[D'Angelo]] for the ''[[Get on the Bus]]'' soundtrack. As the dance craze seeped through into other cities, Kendricks scored a number one pop hit in 1973 with the [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]]-produced "[[Keep on Truckin' (song)|Keep on Truckin']]",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> becoming the only member of the Temptations to register a number one hit in the U.S. as a solo artist. As well as reaching number 18 in the UK, it sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978
|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/329 329]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/329}}</ref> Further hits included 1974's "[[Boogie Down]]" (US number 2, UK number 39) and another million selling release,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> "Son of Sagittarius" (US number 28) from the same year, 1975's "Shoeshine Boy" (US number 18), and 1976's "He's a Friend" (US number 36). Another notable song is "Intimate Friends" (1977), which was [[sampling (music)|sampled]] for the [[Alicia Keys]] song "[[Unbreakable (Alicia Keys song)|Unbreakable]]", "A Penny for My Thoughts" by [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Sparkle (singer)|Sparkle]]'s "Time to Move on" on her [[Sparkle (Sparkle album)|self-titled first studio album]], and for [[Ceybil Jefferies|Sweet Sable]]'s "Old Time's Sake" from the [[soundtrack]] for the 1994 [[2pac]] film, ''[[Above the Rim]]''. [[Erykah Badu]] also sampled "Intimate Friends" for her song "Fall in Love (Your Funeral)", as well as his song "My People... Hold on" for her song "My People" on her album ''[[New Amerykah Part One (4th World War)]]''.

Exasperated by a lack of creative and financial control, Kendricks left Motown in 1978.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  He moved first to [[Arista Records]], and later to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> By this time, his popularity had waned, and he was also gradually losing his upper range as a result of [[chain smoking]].

Kendricks and Ruffin re-joined the Temptations for a well-received 1982 reunion tour.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|date=October 26, 1992|title=Singer Eddie Kendricks Mourned By Music World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMIDAAAAMBAJ&q=eddie+kendricks+|journal=Jet|pages=53–54, 60}}</ref> The group, then a seven-piece act, also recorded a [[reunion (The Temptations album)|reunion album]], and enjoyed a hit with the [[Rick James]]-written-and-produced "[[Standing on the Top]]". Kendricks sang a few lead lines on the song but had no leads on any of the LP's other tracks. In an interview with Tom Meros, [[Dennis Edwards]], Kendricks' former Temptations bandmate, claimed that Kendricks had issues hitting the higher notes during recording sessions for the album. Because of his singing difficulty, Edwards said that Kendricks went to a physician to examine his vocal ability. The physician discovered a "pin drop" of [[cancer]] on one of his lungs. However, Kendricks reportedly refused to undergo [[chemotherapy]] at the time because of fear that he would lose his hair.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meros|first=Tom|title=Dennis Edwards (Interview)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjZtVCRBQk|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref>

Ruffin and Kendrick (Kendricks dropped the "s" from his stage name during the 1980s) reportedly met up one night when Ruffin went to watch Kendrick perform in a nightclub; Kendrick spotted Ruffin in the crowd, pointed him out, and invited him to come up on stage and perform with him. Afterward they talked about touring on their own and recorded an album as a duo for [[RCA Records|RCA]] in 1988.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

Earlier, in 1985, they participated in the [[Hall & Oates]] live album, ''Live at The Apollo'', recorded at a benefit at New York City's [[Apollo Theater]]; and sang with the duo at [[Live Aid]] in [[Philadelphia]]<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in New York. Hall & Oates have cited Kendrick and Ruffin specifically, and the Temptations in general, as a major influence. Ruffin started touring with Kendrick as a duo act in 1985. The live medley of "[[The Way You Do the Things You Do]]" and "My Girl" was released as a single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, number 12 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and number 40 on the R&B chart.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=October 12, 1985|title=Billboard Hot 100|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/80s/1985/BB-1985-10-12.pdf|journal=Billboard|pages=75}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/daryl-hall-john-oates/chart-history/HSI|title=Daryl Hall & John Oates Chart History|website=Billboard}}</ref> The single earned them a Grammy nomination.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/eddie-kendricks|title=Eddie Kendricks|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards}}</ref>

In 1989, Kendrick, Ruffin, and their Temptations bandmates were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. There, Kendrick and Ruffin made plans with fellow former Temptation [[Dennis Edwards]] to tour and record as "Ruffin/Kendrick/Edwards, Former Leads of the Temptations". The Ruffin/Kendrick/ Edwards project was cut short in 1991, when Kendrick was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and David Ruffin died of a [[drug overdose]],<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|date=November 9, 1992|title=Friends, Fans Pay Tribute To Late Temptations Singer Eddie Kendricks Ar Concerts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcIDAAAAMBAJ&q=eddie+kendricks+|journal=Jet|volume=83|issue=3|pages=60}}</ref> although Kendrick and Edwards continued to tour for the remainder of 1991. After having surgery in late 1991, Kendricks resumed touring through the summer of 1992.

==Death==
In late 1991, Kendricks, by now living in his native Birmingham, Alabama, underwent surgery to have one of his lungs removed in hopes of preventing the spread of cancer.<ref name=":0" /> He believed the disease was caused by his 30 years of smoking.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-eddie-kendricks-1555932.html|title=Obituary: Eddie Kendricks|date=1992-10-07|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-GB}}</ref> He continued to tour through the summer of 1992, when he fell ill again and was hospitalized. Kendricks died of lung cancer at Baptist Medical Center-Princeton in Birmingham on October 5, 1992 at age 52.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12|title=Billboard|date=1992-10-17|page=12|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref> He was survived by his three children: Parris, Aika, and Paul Kendricks. Funeral services were held at the First Baptist Church in [[Ensley (Birmingham)|Ensley, Alabama]]. He was buried in Elmwood Cemetery, Birmingham, Jefferson County, Alabama.
Friends and fans paid tribute to Kendricks during four concerts held at the Strand in Los Angeles on October 16 and October 17, 1992. Performers including [[Bobby Womack]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], and [[Vesta Williams|Vesta Willams]] sang Temptations songs as well as some of their own.<ref name=":2" />

==Legacy==
Kendricks was nominated for four Grammy Awards, winning one for "Cloud Nine" with the Temptations in 1969.<ref name=":1" /> The Temptations received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/lifetime-achievement-award-temptations|title=Lifetime Achievement Award: The Temptations|date=January 28, 2013|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|language=en}}</ref>

In 1998, [[NBC]] aired ''[[The Temptations (miniseries)|The Temptations]]'', a four-hour television miniseries based upon an autobiographical book by Otis Williams. Kendricks was portrayed by actor [[Terron Brooks]].

On October 16, 1999, Eddie Kendrick Memorial Park, located on the corner of 18th Street and 4th Avenue North, was dedicated to Birmingham native Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. The park uses Kendricks' family name sans the "s", which was added early in his career. The memorial features a bronze sculpture of Kendricks by local artist Ron McDowell as well as sculptures of the other Temptations, set into a granite wall. Inscribed on the granite are the names of Temptations' hit songs. Recorded music can be heard throughout the park, featuring songs by Kendricks and the Temptations.

Rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]] was named by his mother after Kendricks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Did You Know Kendrick Lamar Was Named After One Of The Temptations? - XXL|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/09/know-kendrick-lamar-named-one-temptations/|last=Miranda J|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref> In 2019, Kendricks was inducted as a solo artist into National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame.
