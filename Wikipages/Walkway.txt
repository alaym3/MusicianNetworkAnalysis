In [[American English]], '''walkway''' is a composite or umbrella term for all engineered surfaces or structures which support the use of [[trails]].

''[[The New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' also defines a walkway as "a passage or path for walking along, esp. a raised passageway connecting different sections of a building or a wide path in a park or garden." The word is used to describe a [[footpath]] in New Zealand, where "walkways vary enormously in nature, from short urban strolls, to moderate coastal locations, to challenging tramps [hikes] in the high country [mountains]".<ref>[http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/getting-involved/nz-conservation-authority-and-boards/nz-conservation-authority/007-nz-walkway-system.pdf Government of New Zealand]</ref> Similarly in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], Canada the "[[Grand Concourse (St. John's)|Grand Concourse]]", is an integrated walkway system that has over {{convert|160|km|mi|sp=us}} of walkways, which link every major park, river, pond, and green space in six municipalities.<ref>Grand Concourse Authority: [https://www.google.ca/#q=grand+concourse].</ref>

In [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, the [[SkyWalk]] is an approximately {{Convert|500|m|adj=on}} enclosed and elevated walkway ([[skyway]]) connecting [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] to the [[CN Tower]] and the [[Rogers Centre|Rogers Centre (SkyDome)]]. It is part of the [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] network. The SkyWalk passes above the York Street '[[Subway (underpass)|subway]]' and the [[Simcoe Street Tunnel]]. It opened in 1989 and it was built  to reduce the need for additional parking spaces near the Skydome stadium by providing a direct transportation link to the [[Yonge-University line|subway]] and [[GO trains]]. PATH is a {{convert|adj=on|29|km|mi|0}} [[underground city|network of pedestrian tunnels]] beneath the office towers of [[Downtown Toronto]], and the largest underground shopping complex in the world.<ref>[http://www.toronto.ca/path/ City of Toronto â€“ PATH facts]</ref>

In [[British English]], a walkway more specifically refers to a covered or raised passage in a building, typically connecting separate buildings.<ref>[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/walkway?view=uk Compact Oxford English Dictionary]</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88919&dict=CALD&topic=pedestrian-routes Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]</ref>
