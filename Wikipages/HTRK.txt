'''HTRK''' (formerly '''Hate Rock Trio''') is an Australian band formed in 2003.

==Biography==
===Emergence===

Originating from [[Melbourne]], and previously based in [[Berlin]] and [[London]], HTRK (pronounced Hate Rock) started playing in November 2003 when guitarist Nigel Yang and bassist Sean Stewart invited vocalist Jonnine Standish to create music inspired by the surrealistic films of [[David Lynch]], along with [[protopunk]] and [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]] ideas. Using a very slow [[Roland TR-808|808]] [[drum machine]], minimal bass grooves and highly textured noise, their attitude clashed with the "rock and roll" status quo in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p892797|pure_url=yes}}|title=HTRK Overview|first=Jason|last=Lymangrover|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=2009-12-18}}</ref> HTRK's first release was the ''Nostalgia'' EP in 2004, originally intended as a demo but later self-released in a limited 500-disc run.

Their live shows soon caught the attention of underground icon [[Rowland S. Howard]] and popular Australian producer Lindsay Gravina, who invited them to record their debut album at Gravina's Birdland Studios. Titled ''[[Marry Me Tonight]]'' and considered something of a pop effort by the band, the album was held in limbo for several years due to a protracted rights dispute. In August 2005, the band performed as a support act for Howard at the premiere party for [[Scott Crary]]'s film, ''[[Kill Your Idols (film)|Kill Your Idols]]'', in Melbourne.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jo Roberts |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/sticky-carpet/2005/07/27/1122143909909.html |title=Sticky Carpet |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=2005-07-25 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>

===Breakthrough===

In 2006, a few months after recording ''Marry Me Tonight'', the trio relocated to [[Berlin]], toured with fellow expatriates [[Devastations]] and played their first UK gig at the 20jazzfunkgreats club in [[Brighton]]. Upon witnessing a show at the [[Brixton]] Windmill, UK label [[Fire Records (UK)|Fire Records]] signed HTRK to give ''Nostalgia'' a wider international release. A 27-date European tour supporting [[Liars (band)|Liars]] and a performance at [[Glasgow]]'s [[Optimo]] followed in 2007.

In 2008, they began to be managed by [[Paul Smith (music industry)|Paul Smith]], who organised London shows with [[Lydia Lunch]] and [[Alan Vega]]. Stewart and Standish spent part of the year in Melbourne recording as guests on Howard's final album, ''[[Pop Crimes]]'', including a duet by Howard and Standish, "(I Know) a Girl Called Jonny".

''Marry Me Tonight'' was finally released in 2009 on Smith's independent label [[Blast First|Blast First Petite]], receiving critical favor from the UK press, scoring 8 out of 10 in ''[[NME]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourcomicbookfantasy.com/presspress%20nme%20mmt%20review.html|title=NME review of ''Marry Me Tonight''|website=NME|accessdate=2011-05-22}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> making ''[[Artrocker]]''s best of 2009 list and an office ambience listing in ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]''. Artist and former porn actress [[Sasha Grey]] also listed ''Marry Me Tonight'' in her top three albums in a ''[[Stereogum]]'' end-of-year poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stereogum.com/104471/celebrity_ballots_2009/gummy-awards|title=Stereogum Celebrity Gummy Ballots 2009|publisher=stereogum.com|accessdate=2011-05-22}}</ref>

That year, HTRK were invited by [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], [[the Horrors]] and [[Fuck Buttons]] to embark on various European tours. Their increased profile led to a headline show at Cargo in London in January 2010, which coincided with the release of the first of a series of free [[mixtapes]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cargo-london.com/blogs/2010/01/htrk-interviewmixtape/|title=HTRK Interview and Mixtape|publisher=cargo london|access-date=2011-05-22|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927235227/http://www.cargo-london.com/blogs/2010/01/htrk-interviewmixtape/|archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> and appearances in US magazines ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' and ''[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]''.

===Re-organisation===

Tragedy struck on 18 March 2010, when Stewart was found dead in his London home from [[suicide]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imposemagazine.com/features/hrtk-address-sean-stewarts-death|title=HTRK address Sean Stewart's death - Features|website=Imposemagazine.com|date=7 September 2011}}</ref> Speculation on the Australian music website ''[[Mess+Noise]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/discussions/650696|title=HTRK - Marry Me Tonight|publisher=Mess+Noise|accessdate=2010-03-23}}Mess+Noise</ref> was later confirmed in a statement sent to the media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/htrk/50591|title=HTRK founding member Sean Stewart dies|website=NME|accessdate=2011-05-22}}</ref> ''NME'' published an obituary on 24 April 2010 with tributes from Yeah Yeah Yeahs' [[Nick Zinner]] and the Horrors' [[Faris Badwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourcomicbookfantasy.com/presscopy.html|title=HTRK's Sean Stewart RIP|website=NME|accessdate=2011-05-22}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Standish and Yang have remained active, beginning with a comeback show at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] in London on 29 November 2010. They have since released three further albums on [[Ghostly International]], ''Work (Work, Work)'' on 12 September 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/news/4255686|title=Forthcoming-HTRK|publisher=Mess+Noise|access-date=2011-05-22|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515161605/http://www.messandnoise.com/news/4255686|archive-date=15 May 2011}}</ref> ''Psychic 9–5 Club'' on 1 April 2014 (co-produced by Nathan Corbin) and ''Venus in Leo'', September 2019.
