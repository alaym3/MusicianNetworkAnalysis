== Publications ==
Hilborn's first [[chapbook]], ''Clatter,'' was self-published in 2012 before being picked up by Button Poetry and re-published in 2013.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Hilborn's second book, ''Our Numbered Days'', was released on May 14, 2015. The book is a collection of 45 poems. The book is divided into six different sections spanning the entire collection. ''Our Numbered Days'' features some of Hilborn's most well-known poetry, including "Joey" and "OCD". Arianna Miller is cited in her critical review as stating, "Hilborn wants readers to question his work, to use his pieces as a means of learning not only about oneself, but also about the world around him/her/them".<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=http://narmo.milne-library.org/our-numbered-days/|title=Our Numbered Days |last=Miller|first=Arianna|date=March 5, 2017|website=narmo.milne-library.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-21}}</ref>  The book is an [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] bestseller with more than 50,000 copies in print.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://buttonpoetry.com/product/our-numbered-days/|title=Our Numbered Days by Neil Hilborn|work=Button Poetry|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Our-Numbered-Days-Neil-Hilborn/dp/0989641562/|title=Our Numbered Days|last=Hilborn|first=Neil|date=2015-04-01|publisher=Button Poetry|isbn=9780989641562|language=en}}</ref>

== Influences ==
In an interview with ''The Triangle'', Hilborn cites [[Paul Guest]], [[Sherman Alexie]], and poets [[Patricia Smith (poet)|Patricia Smith]] and Michael Mlekoday as influencing his work. Mlekoday had a particularly strong influence as Hilborn's teacher, and is someone Hilborn says taught him "how to construct an image and how to speak precisely".<ref name=":4" />

Much of Hilborn's work is autobiographical, frequently referencing people and events from his own life. His work often references the topic of living with mental illness, and how his diagnoses of OCD and bipolar disorder have impacted him.<ref name=":0" />

Hilborn's work has inspired readers to create their own versions, videos, and interpretations of his poetry, particularly of his poem "OCD".<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Van der Starre|first=Kila|date=January 2015|title=How Viral Poems are Annotated: On 'OCD' by Neil Hilborn|journal=Performance Research|volume=20|pages=58–64}}</ref>
