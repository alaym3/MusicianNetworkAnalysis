Tei Shi released her debut extended play, ''Saudade'', in November 2013,<ref name="tsb"/> which [[Noisey]] described as a "layered masterpiece of melodies... expertly entwined vocal loops, and shivery sonics."<ref name="tsh"/>

In 2014, she released two singles: "Adder(f)all" and a cover of [[Beyoncé]]'s "[[No Angel (Beyoncé song)|No Angel]]". She was also a guest artist on the track "Holiest" by [[Glass Animals]], an English [[indie rock]] band.<ref name="tsn"/> Her second extended play, ''Verde'', was released in 2015.

==Music career==

===2013–2014: First singles and ''Saudade''===

In the summer of 2013 Tei Shi released her first single, which she announced would later appear on her upcoming debut EP. Titled "M&Ms," ''Dummy Magazine'' called the single "transportive and exceedingly gorgeous," stating "minimal background instrumentation is limited to an echoing drum track, [[mouth organ]]s and a few lonely guitar bits, but they provide a solid framework for her soft, cooing [[a cappella]]."<ref name="tsa"/> A video was released along with the song,<ref name="tsb"/> and directed by singer-songwriter [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]]' brother Mac Boucher.

She performed her first shows in the fall of 2013, playing at [[CMJ]]. According to [[Noisey]], she loops live vocals during her set to create a layered effect.<ref name="tsfnoiseybest"/>

}}
On November 1, 2013 she released the second promo song for the EP, titled "Nevermind the End."<ref name="tsb"/> ''[[The Fader]]'' called the track "slinky" and "more traditionally structured" than her first song.<ref name="tsb"/> Kim Taylor Bennett of [[Noisey]] described the track as one of the "best seven songs" of 2013, and praised her lyrics, harmonies, and tonal buildup.<ref name="tsfnoiseybest"/> Hypetrak wrote that Tei Shi's "airy" vocals "contrastingly bump well with the heavy production and hints of charming synth pop."<ref name="tschypet"/>

A third promo single, "Nature Vs. Nurture," was released on November 5, 2013. ''[[Stereogum]]'' wrote that the track is  a "cascading bedroom-[[R&B]] and [[future pop]] track that evolves from quiet, but dizzying layers of harmonies into fleshed out vocal rounds with a Tropcalía-tinged backbone."<ref name="tsd"/>

|style="text-align: left;"|"''Saudade'' tips the scales to the sad side, but is all the more soul-crushingly beautiful for it... Tei Shi range is tonally akin to [[Feist (singer)|Feist]] and [[Lianne La Havas]], and what's so goosebump-inducingly awesome about this EP is its range... Elegant, elegiac, and sensual, ''Saudade'', is both excellently titled and the best thing we've heard all fall."

Tei Shi released her six-track debut EP ''Saudade,'' on November 12, 2013.<ref name="tsb"/> Among her collaborators was her friend Luca (Gianluca Buccellati), who she had met while a student at Berklee.<ref name="tsl"/> The word "[[saudade]]" is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], describing a sentimental yearning for someone or for the happiness of a former place or time. Her previous singles were included on the EP, as well as several new tracks. According to Noisey, it is a "layered masterpiece of melodies that duck and dive, expertly entwined vocal loops, and shivery sonics."<ref name="tsh"/> ''Saudade'' later received a physical release in 2015 through the indie label [[Turntable Kitchen]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.turntablekitchen.com/2015/01/tk040-tei-shi-saudade-ep/|title=TK040: Tei Shi - Saudade EP - Turntable Kitchen|date=2015-01-05|newspaper=Turntable Kitchen|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref>

In January 2014, Tei Shi released her first single from ''Saudade'', Adder(f)all", as a free [[mp3]] . She told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that the song resulted from three different song ideas joined together. "Instead of making a really structured song I just looped these three sections/melody lines over one another, building them up and layering with harmonies. It was originally a capella and when the instrumentals were added it really came into its own."<ref name="tsg"/> In the same month a remix of "Closer (Heart Shaped Birthmark Remix)" by Spirals hit the blogosphere with the prominent blog [http://kickkicksnare.com/ Kick Kick Snare] stating, "SPIRALs has found a way to make something already so smooth into a beautifully jagged juxtaposition of a mixture.  A robotic end to a beautiful romance."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kickkicksnare.com/2014/01/12/tei-shi-closer-spirals-heart-shaped-birthmarkremix/|title=Kick Kick Snare - Tei Shi: Closer (SPIRALs "Heart Shaped Birthmark"remix)|last=kinzie0|date=2014-01-12|website=Kick Kick Snare|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref>

|style="text-align: left;"|"We originally wanted to work with Tei Shi because she has an amazing voice and this modern New York R&B thing. We sent her a couple beats... and she sent back the great vocal you hear in the song, about both loving and hating something all at the same time.”<ref name="tsivogue"/>

She released her second music video in March 2014 for the track "Nevermind the End."<ref name="tsh"/> Also in March 2014 she was a featured guest on the track "Holiest" by [[Glass Animals]], an English [[indie rock]] band. She sings a duet with Glass Animals' Dave Bayley, with both voices representing the perspectives of different characters.<ref name="tsn"/> ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'' called her vocal performance "delicate,"<ref name="tsn"/> with ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' describing them as "airy and minimalist [and] R&B-inflected."<ref name="tsivogue"/>

In summer of 2014 she collaborated with Gianluca Buccellati, and together they arranged and recorded a cover of "[[No Angel (Beyoncé song)|No Angel]]" by Beyoncé.<ref name="tsl"/> Wrote ''Stereogum'', "In her cover, Tei Shi keeps the song's lovesick drift intact but adds all these trickly little bloop-pop flourishes."<ref name="tsj"/> ''[[The Fader]]'' described the cover as an "'80s-leaning take," stating that "breezy vocals and glowing synths were made for this role."<ref name="tsm"/>

===2015: ''Verde'' EP ===

Tei Shi's second EP, ''Verde'', was released digitally on April 14, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/verde/id964606265|title=Verde by Tei Shi on Apple Music|website=iTunes|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref> ''Verde'' later received a physical release on May 5, 2015 through Mermaid Avenue<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mermaidavenue.nyc/|title=mermaid avenue.|website=mermaidavenue.nyc|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tei-shi.com/|title=*~* Tei Shi *~*|website=*~* Tei Shi *~*|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref> and internationally via [[Double Denim Records]] and Caroline Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://carolineaustralia.com.au/|title=caroline australia {{!}} Caroline Australia is a label services company dedicated to working with quality labels and artists for Australia and New Zealand.|last=Australia|first=Caroline|website=carolineaustralia.com.au|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref> The EP's first single, "Bassically", was released on February 11, 2015.

Tei Shi explained "I wanted the video to look like what the song sounds like – fun and empowering without taking itself too seriously. So we created a fun fictional comic world with a troop of bad ass girls.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hypebeast.com/2015/2/tei-shi-bassically-2|title=Tei Shi - Bassically|newspaper=Hypebeast|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref>

Speaking about shooting the video, the artist explained "It was a combination of the familiar and the new for me. More than just being a music video, it was an experience that tied in really fittingly with the song for me personally.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/08/20/tei-shi-see-me-video/|title=Tei Shi Retraces Her Bogotá Childhood in 'See Me' Video (Exclusive)|last=Danton|first=Eric R.|newspaper=WSJ|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref>
