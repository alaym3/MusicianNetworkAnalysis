==Biography==
===Childhood and early beginnings (1963–1981)===
Ramazzotti was born in Cinecittà Est, a suburb of Rome. He is the son of Rodolfo Ramazzotti, a construction worker and Raffaela Molina, a housewife. His father originated from the province of [[Viterbo]] in [[Lazio]] and his mother from the province of [[Vibo Valentia]] in [[Calabria]]. He was named after [[Eros]], the Greek god of love. He began playing the guitar at age seven.<ref name="Eros Ramazzotti's biography on Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490553/Eros-Ramazzotti|title=Eros Ramazzotti's biography on Britannica|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=2009-06-07}}</ref> As a teenager, he wrote songs with the help of his father who was a music lover and played piano. He wanted to attend a musical conservatory but failed the admission examination, and started training in bookkeeping, but dropped out.<ref name="Biography: Eros Ramazzotti on Sony Music Germany"/> He occasionally appeared as an extra in films while dreaming of having a career as a pop-star.<ref name="Biography: Eros Ramazzotti on Sony Music Germany"/>

In 1981, Ramazzotti took part in a music contest, ''[[Castrocaro Music Festival|Voci Nuove di Castrocaro]]'' (New Voices of [[Castrocaro Terme]]) with the song "Rock 80", which he wrote, performing in front of various record label representatives. Although the contest was won by [[Zucchero]] and Fiordaliso, Ramazzotti reached the final and received two votes from Roberto Galanti and Baron Lando Lanni, who represented the recently launched Italian Label DDD (Drogueria di Drugolo). DDD gave Eros his first contract. He moved to [[Milan]] with his brother Marco and his mother Raffaella, and they initially lived in the same building as the record label company.<ref name="Biography: Eros Ramazzotti on Sony Music Germany"/>

===Career breakthrough (1982–1986)===
Ramazzotti's first single, "Ad un amico" (To a Friend), was released in 1982, and was not particularly well received.<ref name="Biography: Eros Ramazzotti on Chart King.de">{{cite web |url=http://www.chart-king.de/include.php?path=content/news.php&contentid=1157|title=Biography: Eros Ramazzotti on Chart King.de|publisher=chartking.de|access-date=2008-02-06|language=de}}</ref> Soon after, Eros met Renato Brioschi,<ref name="Biography: Eros Ramazzotti on Sony Music Germany"/> who mentored the young artist toward his first success in 1984 at the highly regarded [[Festival della canzone italiana|Sanremo Festival]]. His song, "Terra promessa" (Promised Land) won the Newcomers' category, and was subsequently released widely throughout Europe.

In 1985, Ramazzotti took part in the Sanremo Festival again with the song "Una storia importante" (An Important Story), taken from his debut album ''[[Cuori agitati]]'' (Troubled Hearts). While only placing sixth at the festival, "Una storia importante" was released as a single and became a huge hit in many European countries, including France where it sold a million units.<ref name="Biography: Eros Ramazzotti on Sony Music Germany"/>
His second album ''[[Nuovi eroi]]'' (New Heroes), released in 1986, earned two Platinum-awards in Switzerland with over 100,000 sales, and Gold status in Germany with over 250,000 sales.<ref name="Switzerland's certification for 1998">{{cite web|url=http://www.swisscharts.com/awards.asp?year=1998 |title=AWARDS 1998 |publisher=Hung Medien |access-date=2010-12-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716232621/http://www.swisscharts.com/awards.asp?year=1998 |archive-date=16 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="Eros Ramazzotti's German Certifications">{{cite certification|region=Germany|artist=Eros Ramazotti|access-date=2010-11-03}}</ref> At his second Sanremo Festival appearance in 1986 his memorable single, "[[Adesso tu]]" (Now You) from ''Nuovi eroi'' won the overall competition.<ref name="Biography: Eros Ramazzotti on Chart King.de"/>

==Personal life==
[[Image:Eros ramazzotti cd perfetto gira 2015.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.9|Eros Ramazzotti (2015)]]
Ramazzotti is very private about his personal life, keeping a small circle of friends.<ref name="Latin Lover Eros Ramazzotti">{{cite web |first=Irmgard |last=Hochreither|url=http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/leute/:Latin-Lover-Eros-Ramazzotti/559137.html|title=Latin Lover Eros Ramazzotti |publisher=[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]|date=2006-04-18|access-date=2007-10-05|language=de}}</ref> Ramazzotti had a poor childhood, and recalls growing up:

{{quote|text=As a child growing up, there were no books in my parents' home, no suggestions were ever made how to even have a decent conversation, no guidance was provided in search of oneself. The only source of information that I would get from my father was the inappropriate photos of women. The first thing as a support that I received from my father was a guitar after he recognized my passion for music. Nowadays, I try to self educate myself by purchasing good books which I almost never read because I become lazy after glancing at a football game on TV.<ref name="Latin Lover Eros Ramazzotti"/>}}

Ramazzotti recalls being extremely shy in the early 1980s before achieving fame:

{{quote|text=When I went to Milan to further develop my musical skills, I remember being so shy at the time that I would simply get terrified of going to restaurants all by myself, so I would go without eating throughout my time in Milan.<ref name="Latin Lover Eros Ramazzotti"/>}}

In spite of being born and raised in [[Rome]], he is famous for his loyal support of [[Juventus F.C.]]. On 26 March 2012, he was awarded a personal star by club legend [[Pavel Nedved]] as recognition of his importance as supporter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.juventus.com/juve/en/news/26mar2012_Ramazzotti|title=Juventus official website: A spectacular evening at Juventus Stadium|publisher=Juventus Football Club S.p.A.|access-date=2013-11-03}}</ref>

His 320-page autobiography, co-written by Luca Bianchini, was published on 13 April 2006.<ref name="Eros: Lo giuro">{{cite web|url=http://www.lucabianchini.it/portfolio/eros-lo-giuro|title=Eros: Lo giuro|publisher=lucabianchini.it|access-date=2011-02-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110214174630/http://www.lucabianchini.it/portfolio/eros-lo-giuro|archive-date=14 February 2011}}</ref>
