On May, Arjona released the music video for "[[Mi Novia Se Me Está Poniendo Vieja]]." However, "[[Te Quiero (Ricardo Arjona song)|Te Quiero]]" was released as third single in July 2012, and became the second song off the album to top the Latin Songs chart. This made ''Independiente'' Arjona's first album to ever have two number-one hits on that chart. The song also topped the Latin Pop Songs chart, becoming the third song off the album to do so. "[[Si Tu No Existieras]]" was released in November 2012, and managed to peak at number 14 in Mexico.

To promote the album, Arjona embarked on the [[Metamorfosis World Tour]]. The show, his first since 2009's [[Quinto Piso Tour]], comprised five legs across North and Latin America. It ran from January 2012 until March 2013 and included 102 shows in 18 countries, with an estimated attendance of over one million people.<ref name=prensalibre1/> The tour opened in [[Toluca]], where he had started all of his concert tours, and grossed more than $13.4&nbsp;million in the United States.

The tour, presented by Loud and Live, will kick off March 24, 2022 at the Kiva Auditorium in Albuquerque and conclude on June 11, 2022 at Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Roiz|first=Jessica|title=Ricardo Arjona Is Hitting the Road With Blanco y Negro Tour in 2022: See The Dates|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/9638081/ricardo-arjona-blanco-y-negro-2022-tour-dates/|date=September 29, 2021|access-date=September 29, 2021|website=Billboard}}</ref>

==Music and style==
[[File:Marc Anthony 2009 White House.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Marc Anthony]] sang alongside Arjona on the [[Salsa music|salsa version]] of "Historia de Taxi".]]
Arjona's primary musical style is [[Latin pop]]. He usually sings without the help of featured or additional singers. His style varied over the years, as Arjona took risks to keep his music from becoming stale. In contrast to the ballad-laden ''[[Déjame Decir Que Te Amo]]'', on the following two albums Arjona experimented with a range of pop/rock styles. ''Animal Nocturno'' intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the [[instrumentation]] is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, and drums.<ref>Birchmeier, Jason.

Retrieved 28 March 2012.</ref> On ''Historias'', each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and [[Hammond B-3]], and strings.<ref>Birchmeier, Jason.

Retrieved 28 March 2012.</ref> On ''[[Si El Norte Fuera El Sur]]'', he crafted a relatively low-key effort characterized by intimate songs about love, culture, and politics.

Besides a couple of rockers, the songs are fairly even in tone and tempo.<ref name=sielnorte/>

In ''[[Galería Caribe]]'', Arjona explored [[Afro-Caribbean music|Afro-Caribbean]] sounds, employing traditional rhythms such as [[guaracha]], [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], [[Merengue music|merengue]], and [[Salsa music|salsa]].<ref>Birchmeier, Jason.

"Puente", the lead single, is the only notable exception. It lasts eight and a half minutes and is divided in three parts. The first is sung mainly with a piano.
