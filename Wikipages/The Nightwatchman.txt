'''The Nightwatchman''' is the solo project of American musician [[Tom Morello]] ([[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Street Sweeper Social Club]] and former [[Audioslave]]). Morello began performing as the Nightwatchman in 2003 as an outlet for his political views while he was playing [[wikt:apolitical|apolitical]] music with Audioslave.

==Career==

===Early career===
Morello created the identity of the Nightwatchman, inspired by [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]'' album,<ref name="ghosttomjoad">{{Twitter|tmorello/status/376390129721417728|Bruce Springsteen as inspiration for The Nightwatchman}}</ref> when a desire to return to political activism in his music struck him in 2003, after over a year of playing non-activist rock in [[Audioslave]].<ref name="newmachine">{{cite web | last=Wiederhorn | first=Jon | title=Tom Morello Rages Against A New Machine on Solo Acoustic Tour | work=[[MTV News]] | date=October 22, 2003 | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1479880/20031022/audioslave.jhtml | access-date=2007-02-18}}</ref> Morello describes The Nightwatchman as "the black [[Robin Hood]] of 21st century music" and "a reaction against illicit wars, a reaction against [[preemptive war|first strike]]s, [[torture]], secret prisons, spying illegally on American citizens. It's a reaction against [[war crime]]s, and it's a reaction against a few corporations that grow rich [off] this illicit war while people beg for food in the city streets."<ref name="firedup"/> He later elaborated that the format was inspired by long-time social and political activist/musician [[Billy Bragg]]. Morello first saw him performing at a concert ''c.'' 1994, playing "fearlessly" before a crowd of 8,000 people in a tent alongside big-name rock bands of the time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donovan|first=Patrick|title=Maintaining the rage|work=[[The Age]]|date=January 25, 2008|page=Entertainment Guide supplement (p. 4)|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/maintaining-the-rage/2008/01/24/1201025043641.html|access-date=2009-02-03}}</ref> The Nightwatchman first began playing political acoustic [[folk music]] in a Los Angeles [[coffeehouse]] before a small crowd,<ref name="firedup">{{cite web | last=Harris | first=Chris | date=February 6, 2007 | title=Nightwatchman, Rage Reunion Have Morello Fired Up For Political Fights | work=[[MTV News]] | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1551733/20070206/morello_tom.jhtml | access-date=2007-02-18}}</ref> and soon after went on [[Billy Bragg]]'s ''Tell Us the Truth tour''.<ref name="newmachine"/>

{{cquote|"The Nightwatchman is my political folk alter ego. I've been writing these songs and playing them at open mic nights with friends for some time. This is the first time I've toured with it. When I play open mic nights, I'm announced as The Nightwatchman. There will be kids there who are fans of my electric guitar playing, and you see them there scratching their heads."|||Tom Morello }}

The ''Tell Us the Truth tour'' was supported by unions, environmental and media reform groups including [[Common Cause]], [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]] and [[A.F.L.-C.I.O.]] with the ultimate goal of "informing music fans, and exposing and challenging the failures of the major media outlets in the United States."<ref>Portner, Matt and Heller, Sarah. [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.thestudentunderground.org/article.php?id=91&issue=46 Tell Us the Truth Tour − Music as Motivation]. ''The Boston Underground'' at the [[Internet Archive]].</ref> His Nightwatchman persona has been compared to [[Woody Guthrie]],<ref name="newmachine"/> [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name="firedup"/> He initially had no plans to record,<ref>{{cite web | last=Moss | first=Corey | title=Audioslave's Morello Says New LP Feels Less Like Soundgarden + Rage | work=[[MTV News]] | date=July 29, 2004 | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489715/20040726/audioslave.jhtml | access-date=2007-02-18}}</ref> but later recorded the song "No One Left" for ''[[Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11]]''. At the Festival of Bonnaroo in 2007, The Nightwatchman performed Rage Against the Machine song "[[Guerrilla Radio]]" to protest [[George W. Bush]].

===''One Man Revolution''===
In February 2007, he announced a [[solo album]], ''[[One Man Revolution]]'', which was released on April 24, 2007 in the US and May 7 worldwide.<ref name="firedup"/> The Nightwatchman's first headlining gig was played June 17, 2007 at the House of Blues in Dallas, Texas. Morello has toured since the CD was released and said he plans to tour the U.S. again in the fall. After seeing an early screening of the [[Michael Moore]] film ''[[Sicko]]'' Morello wrote the song, "Alone Without You" which featured in closing credits of the film and also with a music video directed by Moore in the DVD release. The song was also made available as an [[iTunes]] bonus track for ''One Man Revolution''. Morello toured in support of the album as the opening act for [[Ben Harper]] During this tour, Morello joined Harper onstage on several occasions for a cover of Bob Dylan's "[[Masters of War]]", on which he plays the electric guitar in the style for which he's best known. Other prominent musicians who Morello shared the stage with during the ''One Man Revolution tour'' includes, [[Serj Tankian]], [[Perry Farrell]], [[Jon Foreman]] from [[Switchfoot]], [[Shooter Jennings]], [[Nuno Bettencourt]], [[Sen Dog]] from [[Cypress Hill]], [[Jill Sobule]], [[Boots Riley]], [[Alexi Murdoch]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] from [[MC5]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and many others.

===''The Fabled City''===
The album ''[[The Fabled City]]'' was released on September 30, 2008. Two songs off the record, "Midnight in the City of Destruction" (about New Orleans and [[Hurricane Katrina]]) and "King of Hell" (written about [[Guantanamo Bay]]), had previously been leaked on The Nightwatchman MySpace or performed during live sets.

{{cquote|"The template is half [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]] and half [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]]. It's going to be half acoustic and half electric. Not only will there be the no sell-out, acoustic, three chords and the truth part of the show, but also, with the band I put together called the ''Freedom Fighter Orchestra'', there will be more insane electric playing than I've ever done with Rage or Audioslave because it's not confined to a three-and-a-half-minute song"|||Tom Morello<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marqueemag.com/tag/freedom-fighter-orchestra/|title=Freedom Fighter Orchestra - Marquee Magazine|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref>}}

So far [[The Satellite Party]]'s [[Carl Restivo]] has been confirmed to be part of ''The Freedom Fighters'' as a second guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=112323421&blogID=436368237|title=Featured Content on Myspace|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref> To promote the new album Morello and the band appeared both on [[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]] and on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]] before heading out on 'The Fabled City tour', an eighteen stop tour in the United States.

===''World Wide Rebel Songs''===
To support the many unions affected by the anti-negotiation/bargaining laws due to the [[2011 Wisconsin budget protests]], Morello performed outside the Madison Capitol building on February 21, 2011, to rousing support. He also teamed up with fellow rock musician [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] in support of the protesters performing the title song of his upcoming album, ''[[World Wide Rebel Songs]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=32396|title=Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine galvanizes Wisconsin protesters|date=February 22, 2011|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref> Kramer appears on said song on the album, performing backing vocals.

On The Nightwatchman website, it was announced that Morello has signed with the label [[New West Records]] to release his third album as The Nightwatchman moniker, ''World Wide Rebel Songs'', due out on August 30, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nightwatchmanmusic.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227113053/http://www.nightwatchmanmusic.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 27, 2005|title=Home - Tom Morello: The Nightwatchman|first=Tom Morello: The|last=Nightwatchman|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref>

Before the release of the album, Morello released an EP entitled ''[[Union Town (album)|Union Town]]'' on May 17, 2011. All proceeds of the EP sales will go to benefit The America Votes Labor Unity Fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/tom-morello-to-release-union-town-ep/|title=TOM MORELLO To Release 'Union Town' EP|last=Blabbermouth|date=April 29, 2011|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref>
