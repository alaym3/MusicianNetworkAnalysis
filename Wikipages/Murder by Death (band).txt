'''Murder by Death''' is an American five-piece [[indie rock]] band from [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. Their name is derived from the 1976 [[Robert Moore (director)|Robert Moore]] [[Murder by Death|film of the same name]].<ref name="allmusic">Biography at [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p603608|pure_url=yes}} ''allmusic.com'']</ref>

Murder by Death released its first studio album (''[[Like the Exorcist, but More Breakdancing]]'') in 2002, and has since released seven more studio albums. The band's current lineup consists of two founding members, Adam Turla and Sarah Balliet. Balliet plays [[cello]] for the band, an instrument that has been present consistently throughout the band's evolution. Murder by Death's 2012 album ''[[Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon]]'' reached #76 on the [[Billboard 200]], making it the band's most successful release.

==History==

===Early years (2000–2002)===
Murder by Death was formed in 2000 in Bloomington, Indiana, by guitarist Adam Turla, cellist Sarah Balliet, percussionist Alexander Schrodt, keyboardist Vincent Edwards, and bassist Matt Armstrong. One of the group's first shows was at the Channing-Murray Foundation's cafe The Red Herring in Urbana, Illinois, with former [[American Football (band)|American Football]] drummer [[Steve Lamos]]' solo project [[DMS (band)|DMS]]. After the show, the head of the [[TEAM AV]] record label with which Lamos was working offered to help Turla and his bandmates secure additional shows. Around the same time the band met [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]] vocalist, [[Geoff Rickly]], when the two bands played on the same bill at a gig in their hometown of Bloomington. Rickly introduced the band, known at the time as Little Joe Gould, to his friend [[Alex Saavedra]] (owner of [[Eyeball Records]]), who also took an interest in the band.

In 2001 the band self-released the eponymous ''Little Joe Gould'' EP and early the next year contributed the song "I'm Afraid of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" to the [[TEAM AV]] compilation ''Foreign Nationals''. A short time later the group changed their name to Murder By Death, which they felt better represented their sound.

===First works (2002–2006)===
While still performing under the name Little Joe Gould, the band headed out on an 11-date tour stretching from California to Louisiana with the Chicago-based band [[Volta Do Mar (band)|Volta Do Mar]]. On this tour the band honed the songs for their debut album, which was recorded in several Chicago studios with [[Tim Iseler]], then a guitarist with the [[TEAM AV]]-affiliated band [[Re:Rec (band)|Re:Rec]]. Both the tour and the recording engineer were arranged by the [[TEAM AV]] label, and the resulting ''[[Like the Exorcist, but More Breakdancing|Like The Exorcist, But More Breakdancing]]'' was released on Eyeball in August 2002. The band extensively toured behind the album with bands such as [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]], [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], and [[The American Analog Set]]. In July 2003 the band released a split album with [[Volta Do Mar (band)|Volta Do Mar]] entitled ''[[Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Zimmer]]'' in honor of the grandfather of the [[TEAM AV]] label owner who appears on the cover. Along with the song "Canyon Inn, Room 16" from the ''Little Joe Gould'' EP, Murder By Death also contributed "Knife Goes In, Guts Come Out" and the instrumental track "We Watch a Lot of Movies" alongside an alternative version of "A Masters in Reverse Psychology". ''Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Zimmer'' was recorded with producer D. James Goodwin during sessions that would ultimately bear the release of ''[[Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them?]]'' in October. In December the band released a tribute 7" single for friend and musician [[Matt Davis (musician)|Matt Davis]] of the band [[Ten Grand (band)|Ten Grand]] who had died earlier that year, before continuing to tour nationwide with [[Lucero (band)|Lucero]], [[The Weakerthans]], [[William Elliott Whitmore]], and [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]].<ref name=allmusic /><ref name=mbddiscography>Discography at [http://www.murderbydeath.com/discography.php the band's official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827200900/http://www.murderbydeath.com/discography.php |date=2008-08-27 }}</ref>

"Those Who Left", from ''Like The Exorcist...'', is an eight-minute instrumental, often played live in total darkness.  This song is often paired with "Those Who Stayed," a shorter instrumental from the same album. This pairing, played during encores, is seen on setlists as "The Two Evils" or "Medley of Evil."

[[My Chemical Romance]] frontman [[Gerard Way]] provides guest vocals on ''Who Will Survive...'' track "The Devil in Mexico."
[[Thursday (band)|Thursday]] frontman [[Geoff Rickly]] provides guest vocals on the ''Who Will Survive...'' track "Killbot 2000."
William Elliott Whitmore provides guest vocals on the ''Who Will Survive...'' track "Until Morale Improves, The Beatings Will Continue." According to the band's website, he sang to them through a telephone while he was on the side of the road in Texas.

===''In Bocca Al Lupo'' (2006–2008)===
Pianist Vincent Edwards left the band in 2004 in order to return to [[academia]]. Cellist Sarah Balliet added keyboard duties to her cello playing. More touring was followed by a stint back at school, during which time the band wrote their third album, ''[[In Bocca al Lupo (album)|In Bocca Al Lupo]]'', which was released in May 2006 on their own label [[Tent Show Records]], an imprint of [[East West Records]]. Vocalist/guitarist Adam Turla described the records's inspiration as coming from "a basic idea—sin, in the Dante/[[Divine Comedy]] sense—and doing 12 songs that were very unique and about different people."<ref name=mbdwebsite /> The title is an Italian good luck wish, literally translating as "in the mouth of the wolf" and therefore a likely nod to the language and subject matter of Dante's epic poem, which Turla was reading during the writing of the album. The record also resembles the 1976 murder mystery from which the band takes its name - a pastiche of bad deeds and of good intentions, heroism and forgiveness. Like its predecessor, ''In Bocca Al Lupo'' is a [[concept album]], which also builds on the band's previous experimentation with unusual musical styles to include [[Waltz (music)|waltzes]], [[jig]]s and [[gospel music]]. The songs are presented in the same [[Spaghetti Western]] theme as previous works, but Turla's vocals are sung in a new baritone range, which has been likened by many{{Who|date=February 2021}} to that of [[Johnny Cash]]. The album was well received and touring continued through the summer of 2006, including headlining shows supported by [[Langhorne Slim]].<ref name=allmusic /><ref name=mbdwebsite /><ref name=punknews /><ref name=mammoth /><ref name=allmusicinbocca>Review of ''[[In Bocca Al Lupo]]'' at [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r832968|pure_url=yes}} ''AllMusic'']</ref>

===''Red of Tooth and Claw'' (2008–2010)===
''[[Red of Tooth and Claw]]'', Murder By Death's fourth album, and first with [[Vagrant Records]], was released in March 2008. Produced by [[Trina Shoemaker]] Recorded at Dark Horse Recording Studio and Mixed at East Iris Studios in Nashville, [[Tennessee]], the record features former keyboardist Vincent Edwards on the song "Ball & Chain" and is also the first album to feature new drummer Dagan Thogerson, who replaced founding member Alex Schrodt. It continues with the band's trademark themes: "lust, betrayal, and classical archetypes of good and evil."<ref name=mbdwebsite /> In Turla's words, the record is an "''Homer’s Odyssey'' of revenge, only without the honorable character at the center."<ref name=mbdwebsite /> The vocals are again sung in the same low, baritone range as ''In Bocca Al Lupo'' causing a few critics to speculate that ''Red of Tooth and Claw'' breaks less new ground than previous efforts, although in general the album has been well received. As described by ''allmusic.com'' the album "carries over some of the Old West outlaw feel of its predecessor, but it's more aggressive and freewheeling here. [...] [The album] isn't a departure for Murder By Death, but their ability to keep their sound fresh and vibrant speaks well of their musical abilities."<ref name="allmusicredoftooth">Review of ''Red Of Tooth And Claw'' at [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r666867|pure_url=yes}} ''AllMusic'']</ref> To celebrate the album's release, Murder By Death played two shows on the same night in their hometown of Bloomington.<ref name=allmusic /><ref name=mbdwebsite /><ref name=punknews /><ref name=mbdpress>Press clippings at [http://www.murderbydeath.com/press.php the band's official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430060346/http://www.murderbydeath.com/press.php |date=2008-04-30 }}</ref>

The song "Comin' Home" from ''Red of Tooth and Claw'' was featured in a trailer for Quentin Tarantino's award-winning film  ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]''. It was also used in an episode of Sons of Anarchy.

===''Good Morning, Magpie'' (2010–2012)===
On January 19, 2010, Murder by Death announced the pending release of their fifth full-length album, ''[[Good Morning, Magpie]]'', on April 6 of the same year. Many of its songs were written by vocalist/guitarist Adam Turla during a two-week solo camping trip in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]]. Although it is not built around a unifying concept, like several of the band's previous albums, ''[[Good Morning, Magpie]]'' continues to draw on [[folklore]] for inspiration. The title track, as explained by Turla in an interview, is a nod to the superstition that the [[magpie]] "has a bit of the devil in him -- and if you don't greet the devil before he sees you he can steal a part of your soul."<ref name=Spinner>{{cite web|last=Reilly|first=Dan|title=Murder by Death Brave Bears and Floods for 'Good Morning, Magpie'|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/19/murder-by-death-good-morning-magpie/|accessdate=December 11, 2012|date=January 19, 2010}}</ref>

After having been a touring member in the fall of 2010, multi-instrumentalist Scott Brackett (of Okkervil River fame) joined as a permanent member in May 2011.

===''Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon'' (2012)===
On July 2, 2012, the band announced that their sixth album, ''Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon'', would be released on September 25, 2012, on new label Bloodshot Records. The first single from the album, titled "I Came Around", was released on July 10. On July 11, they released a one-month project for $100,000 on [[Kickstarter]]. In total, it raised $187,048, making it the third highest music project on Kickstarter to date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2012/120817kickstarter|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025145012/http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2012/120817kickstarter|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 25, 2012|title=Digital Music News - A Detailed Interview With One of the Most Successful Kickstarter Artists Yet...|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref> The Canadian dates on the BDBM tour featured support from post-punk revival group [[Big John Bates]].

===''Big Dark Love'' (2015)===
On February 3, 2015 the band released their seventh album, ''Big Dark Love'', on Bloodshot Records. A pre-sale of the album through Kickstarter raised $278,486.

===''The Other Shore'' (2018)===
On June 1, 2018, the band announced that their eighth album, ''The Other Shore'', would be released on August 24, 2018, on Bloodshot Records. The first single from the album, titled "True Dark", was released on June 26. A Kickstarter for the album raised $327,407.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/murderbydeath/murder-by-deaths-new-album-the-other-shore|title=MURDER BY DEATH'S NEW ALBUM "THE OTHER SHORE"|website=Kickstarter.com|accessdate=2020-03-18}}</ref>

==Style==
Murder by Death plays a range of music including [[instrumental]]s, [[Rock music|rock]] and [[alt.country]]. The band uses cello (with an [[electric cello]] for live shows) to create a [[gothic rock|gothic]] sound with occasional [[Western (genre)|Western]] references.<ref name=mbdwebsite>Biography at [http://www.murderbydeath.com/bio.php the band's official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430031206/http://www.murderbydeath.com/bio.php |date=2008-04-30 }}</ref><ref name=punknews>Review of ''Red Of Tooth And Claw'' at [http://www.punknews.org/review/7166 ''punknews.org'']</ref>

The band often arranges themes such as [[whiskey]] and the [[Devil]] into [[concept album]]s. For example, the band's second album, ''[[Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them?]]'', describes a story in which the Devil wages war against a small village in Mexico.<ref name=allmusic /><ref name=mammoth>Review of ''[[In Bocca Al Lupo]]'' at [http://www.mammothpress.com/index.php?area=readreview&pid=772/ ''mammothpress.com''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215111148/http://www.mammothpress.com/index.php?area=readreview&pid=772%2F |date=2008-12-15 }}</ref>
