He began his professional career at the age of 19 as a [[jazz]] guitarist.

A former [[child prodigy]], Benson first came to prominence in the 1960s, playing [[soul jazz]] with [[Jack McDuff]] and others. He then launched a successful solo career, alternating between jazz, pop, [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] singing, and [[scat singing]]. His album ''[[Breezin']]'' was certified triple-[[music recording sales certification|platinum]], hitting no. 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] album chart in 1976.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited| location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 54}}</ref> His concerts were well attended through the 1980s, and he still has a large following.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Benson has been honored with a [[List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame#B|star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

== Biography ==

=== Early career ===
Benson was born and raised in the [[Hill District (Pittsburgh)|Hill District]] of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name="christianebird-bio">{{cite book |title=The Da Capo Jazz And Blues Lover's Guide to the U.s. |last=Bird |first=Christiane |year=2001 |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |isbn=0306810344 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dacapojazzbluesl0000bird/page/196 196] |access-date=September 8, 2012 |url=https://archive.org/details/dacapojazzbluesl0000bird|url-access=registration |quote=Hill District George Benson. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Faith, Health, and Healing in African American Life |last1=Mitchem |first1=Stephanie Y. |last2=Townes |first2=Emilie Maureen |year=2008 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=978-0275993757 |page=111 |access-date=September 8, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBVTH6F7iGAC&q=Hill+District+George+Benson&pg=PA111}}</ref> At the age of seven, he first played the ukulele in a corner drug store, for which he was paid a few dollars. At the age of eight, he played guitar<ref name="christianebird-bio"/> in an unlicensed nightclub on Friday and Saturday nights, but the police soon closed the club down. At the age of 9, he started to record. Out of the four sides he cut, two were released: "She Makes Me Mad" backed with "It Should Have Been Me",<ref name="ReferenceA"/> with [[RCA Victor]] in New York; although one source indicates this record was released under the name "Little Georgie",<ref name="christianebird-bio"/> the 45rpm label is printed with the name George Benson.  The single was produced by Leroy Kirkland for RCA's rhythm and blues label, [[Groove Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rootsvinylguide.com/ebay_items/r-b-45-george-benson-it-should-have-been-me-2-groove-hear|title=Roots Vinyl Guide|first=Will|last=Sulzer|website=rootsvinylguide.com}}</ref> As he has stated in an interview, Benson's introduction to showbusiness had an effect on his schooling. When this was discovered (tied with the failure of his single) his guitar was impounded. Luckily, after he spent time in a juvenile detention centre his stepfather made him a new guitar.

Benson attended and graduated from [[Schenley High School]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tribune-democrat.com/local/x519167276/NEW-Pittsburghs-Schenley-school-whose-alums-include-Andy-Warhol-and-George-Benson-to-close/print|title=NEW – Pittsburgh's Schenley school – whose alums include Andy Warhol and George Benson – to close|date=June 26, 2008|newspaper=[[The Tribune-Democrat]]|access-date=September 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Smydo|first=Joe|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hqokAAAAIBAJ&pg=3456,6978323&dq=george+benson+schenley&hl=en|title=Panel to study if Schenley High can survive|date=December 10, 2005|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|access-date=September 12, 2012}}</ref> As a youth he learned how to play straight-ahead instrumental jazz during a relationship performing for several years with organist [[Jack McDuff]].

Benson then signed with [[Creed Taylor]]'s jazz label [[CTI Records]], where he recorded several albums, with jazz heavyweights guesting, to some success, mainly in the jazz field. His 1974 release, ''[[Bad Benson]]'', climbed to the top spot in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' jazz chart, while the follow-ups, ''[[Good King Bad]]'' (#51 Pop album) and ''[[Benson & Farrell]]'' (with Joe Farrell), both reached the jazz top-three sellers. Benson also did a version of [[The Beatles]]'s 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]'' called ''[[The Other Side of Abbey Road]]'', also released in 1969, and a version of "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]", originally written and recorded by San Francisco rock group [[The Great Society (band)|Great Society]], and made famous by [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> Benson played on numerous sessions for other CTI artists during this time, including [[Freddie Hubbard]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]], notably on the latter's acclaimed album ''Sugar''.

|description=Title track sample from George Benson's ''Breezin′'' album
|format=[[Ogg]]}}

By the mid-to-late 1970s, as he recorded for [[Warner Bros. Records]], a whole new audience began to discover Benson. With the 1976 release ''[[Breezin']]'', Benson sang a lead vocal on the track "[[This Masquerade]]" (notable also for the lush, romantic piano intro and solo by [[Jorge Dalto]]), which became a huge pop hit and won a [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]].<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=19/20}}</ref> (He had sung vocals infrequently on albums earlier in his career, notably his rendition of "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" on ''[[The Other Side of Abbey Road]]'' album.)<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The rest of the album is instrumental, including his rendition of the 1975 [[Jose Feliciano]] composition "[[Affirmation (George Benson song)|Affirmation]]."

In 1976, Benson toured with soul singer [[Minnie Riperton]], who had been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer earlier that year and, in addition, appeared as a guitarist and backup vocalist on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s song "[[Another Star]]" from Wonder's album ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]''.

During the same year, 1976, the top selling album ''[[Breezin']]'' was released on the Warner Brothers label featuring the [[Bobby Womack]] penned title track and the [[Leon Russell]] penned "[[This Masquerade]]" which is now a jazz standard.  Both tracks won Grammy Awards that year and the album put Benson into the musical limelight both in the US and in Europe.  Ironically, Benson had been discouraged up until this time, from using his singing skills, mainly as the company decision makers felt he was not competent enough vocally, and he should stick to playing the guitar.

He also recorded the original version of "[[The Greatest Love of All]]" for the 1977 [[Muhammad Ali]] bio-pic, ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]'',<ref name="LarkinSM"/> which was later covered by [[Whitney Houston]] as "Greatest Love of All."<ref name="VH1 - Artists bio"/> During this time Benson recorded with the German conductor [[Claus Ogerman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjbear71.com/Ogerman/Claus.html |title=The Work of Claus Ogerman |website=Bjbear71.com |access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref> The live take of "[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]," recorded a few months later from the 1978 release ''[[Weekend in L.A.]]'', also won a Grammy.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> He has worked with Freddie Hubbard on a number of his albums throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

The Qwest record label (a subsidiary of Warner Bros., run by [[Quincy Jones]]) released Benson's breakthrough pop album ''Give Me The Night'', produced by Jones.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Benson made it into the pop and R&B top ten with the song "[[Give Me the Night (George Benson song)|Give Me the Night]]" (written by former [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]] keyboardist [[Rod Temperton]]). He had many hit singles such as "Love All the Hurt Away," "[[Turn Your Love Around]]," "Inside Love," "[[Lady Love Me (One More Time)|Lady Love Me]]," "20/20," "[[Shiver (George Benson song)|Shiver]]," "Kisses in the Moonlight."  More importantly, Quincy Jones encouraged Benson to search his roots for further vocal inspiration, and he rediscovered his love for [[Nat Cole]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Donny Hathaway]] in the process, influencing a string of further vocal albums into the 1990s. Despite returning to his jazz and guitar playing most recently, this theme was reflected again much later in Benson's 2000 release ''[[Absolute Benson]]'', featuring a cover of one of Hathaway's most notable songs, "[[The Ghetto (Donny Hathaway song)|The Ghetto]]." Benson accumulated three other platinum LPs and two gold albums.<ref name="VH1 - Artists bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/benson_george_1/bio.jhtml |title=Digital Videos &#124; Episodes (TV Series) |publisher=VH1 |date=2017-03-14 |access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref>
