==Early life==
Nkosi was born in [[Mpumalanga]], South Africa in 6 December 1983. He spent his childhood in Likazi, later moving to [[Klerksdorp]], and then [[Benoni, Gauteng|Benoni]]. His early love of music was fueled by artists his father listened to – the likes of The Spinners, [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Stimela]], and [[Hugh Masekela]].<ref name=Owen>{{cite web|author=Owen|url=http://www.owens.co.za/profile/173/Euphonik|title=Profile, Euphonik|accessdate=25 March 2014|location=South Africa|year=2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422034619/http://www.owens.co.za/profile/173/Euphonik|archive-date=22 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He started DJing during his late teens and quickly established himself in the club music scene. It wasn't long before his mixes achieved radio play, initially on regional station YFM. He was then offered the opportunity to host his own shows on national radio station 5FM.<ref>{{cite web|title=5FM unveils lineup changes |url=https://m.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/59/13962.html|work=Biz Community|date=28 March 2007}}</ref>

==Musical career==

=== Euphonik (2003–2016) ===
Euphonik first started remixing in 2003 and gained recognition in 2004 when he and South African DJ, DJ Kent joined forces and produced an album together, ''Kentphonik''. 

In 2004, Euphonik started his radio career on YFM, a regional radio station in South Africa, doing mixes on radio shows. He was signed by record label Soul Candi Records in 2006.<ref name="Soul Candi">{{cite web|author=Soul Candi|url=http://www.soulcandi.co.za/index.php/artists-board/euphonik/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505113040/http://www.soulcandi.co.za/index.php/artists-board/euphonik/|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2014|accessdate=25 March 2014|title=Euphonik|location=South Africa|year=2013}}</ref>

He was at YFM until 2006, when he moved to 5FM, where he had two weekly shows. His Saturday show, ''Ultimix Weekend Edition'', featured new music and mixes from DJs across South Africa and international borders. The three-hour show (18:00 – 22:00) was the brainchild from one of 5FM's most popular features, the Ultimix @6, which can be heard from Monday to Friday on the Roger Goode show. The show involves 30-minute mixes and is used as a platform to showcase DJ talent of some of the world's leading dance artists and musos. The Saturday night show was discontinued in 2014. His Sunday show, ''My House'', is a show dedicated to the latest and most popular house tunes from around the world.<ref name=5FM />

Euphonik has travelled the world and has played in places such as New York, Miami, Ibiza, Dubai, UK, Spain, and around Africa. He has shared stages with Tiesto, Swedish House Mafia, Avicii, [[Afrojack]], Hardwell, Skrillex, Nicky Romero, Deadmau5, Louie Vega, and Richie Hawtin.

In 2009, Euphonik and longtime friend DJ Fresh formed a brand together, called F.Eu. Since 2009, they have recorded a total of four albums together. The duo travel to Ibiza and Miami on a yearly basis to play at events such as the South African Miami Invasion and Ultra Fest Miami. In 2014 and 2015, they headlined Ultra Fest South Africa and also captained the "Oh Ship" party cruise from Durban, South Africa to the Portuguese Island.<ref name=MSC>{{cite web|url=http://www.msccruises.co.za/za_en/Special-Cruises/Theme-Cruises/Oh_ship.aspx|title=OH SHIP 3|publisher=MSC|accessdate=25 March 2014|location=South Africa|year=2014}}</ref>
