'''G.R.L.''' are an American-British-Canadian [[girl group]] formed by [[Robin Antin]]. The group consists of members [[Lauren Bennett]], Natasha Slayton, and [[Emmalyn Estrada]]. Past members included Jazzy Mejia and original members [[Simone Battle]] and Paula van Oppen.

The original line-up consisted of Slayton, Bennett, Estrada, Van Oppen, and Simone Battle. They made their debut appearance on the [[Smurfs 2|''Smurfs 2'' soundtrack]] with "[[Vacation (G.R.L. song)|Vacation]]". They would go on to appear on [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull's]] internationally successful track "[[Wild Wild Love]]", which peaked in the top 40 in the United States and top 10 in the United Kingdom, and was certified platinum by [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Their second single "[[Ugly Heart]]" gained international success shortly after the suicide of member Simone Battle. Leaving the group as a quartet, this inspired the group to release their next single "[[Lighthouse (G.R.L. song)|Lighthouse]]" in memory of Battle. The group disbanded shortly after its release, on June 2, 2015.

G.R.L. officially reformed on August 5, 2016, with the addition of new member Jazzy Mejia alongside Bennett and Slayton.

G.R.L. announced in their Instagram page that they are back with new music in 2021, with [[Emmalyn Estrada]] coming back to the group alongside original members Bennett and Slayton, making the group a trio.

=== 2020–present: Emmalyn's return and new music ===
On September 2020 member Natasha Slayton posted a video of herself, Lauren Bennett and former members Emmalyn Estrada and Paula van Oppen dancing to a song alongside the founder of the group, [[Robin Antin]], on her Instagram stories. Since then, fans started speculating that the group was reforming alongside member Jazzy Mejia. Later in October of the same year, Slayton, Estrada and van Oppen started posting [[TikTok]] videos with each other, making the rumors of the group reforming grow. By November 2020, posts from the group's Instagram and Twitter accounts during the time Mejia was a member of the group were unexpectedly deleted, a new profile picture with the group's logo was added. During the same month, a TikTok account by the group's name was made, posting clips from the music videos by the original lineup of the group.

In December 10, 2020, a few clips and pictures from what seemed to look like the set from the group's next music videos were posted by Bennett, Estrada and Slayton. The fans immediately noticed the absence of van Oppen. Later that day, the group's manager, Matt Ziedman, announced that van Oppen had decided not to rejoin the group.<ref>{{cite tweet |last=Ziedman |first=Matt |user=mz |number=1336936450932150272 |date=December 10, 2020 |title=GRL Fans: unfortunately, Paula has decided not to continue with us.

In January 2021, a few clips from what was rumored to be the group's next music video were posted to the group's Instagram, TikTok and Twitter accounts, the clips in fact were the members dancing and singing along to a medley of the group's singles. Later in the same month, the group did an Instagram live alongside Antin and Ziedman confirming their return and future new music. They also explained why Mejia was not invited to said return by saying that Estrada, van Oppen and management were only interested in reforming the group's original lineup.

By April 2021, Ziedman, the group's manager, responded to a fan of the group on Twitter explaining that he was not "involved" with the group's return anymore.<ref>{{cite tweet |last=Ziedman |first=Matt |user=mz |number=1383607882487255045 |date=April 17, 2021 |title=@tvdsddl Idk im not involved anymore 🤷🏻♂️ |language=en |access-date=June 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418030117/https://twitter.com/mz/status/1383607882487255045 |archive-date=April 18, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>
