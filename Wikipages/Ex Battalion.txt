==History==
[[File:Ex Battalion OfficialLogo.jpg|thumb|Ex Battalion official logo (white background)]]
In 2012, Ex Battalion was formed and founded by [[Bosx1ne]] and [[Emcee|rap battle emcees]] Jekkpot and Cent as a rap battle group. They had joined several [[barangay]] rap battles before being into music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ex Battalion: The Freshman Class|url=http://pinoyhiphopsuperstar.blogspot.com/2017/08/ex-battalion.html|website=Pinoy Hiphop Superstar|date=17 August 2017|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> In January 2016, the group was formed into a musical group and as a hip hop collective and released their first album entitled "X" on digital platforms. They eventually recruited several artists to join their group after the release. The first three members were former reality talent show participant JRoa, rapper [[Flow G]], singer and rapper [[Skusta Clee]], and their founder Bosx1ne. JRoa's vocals were included in the hook of their first single that became their first hit as a group entitled "Kakaiba" which was released on the same month. Singer and rapper Skusta Clee  started associating with the group since early 2016 and has collaborated in most of their singles until eventually becoming a member.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdWLrIMBIVY Video on YouTube]</ref>

On 25 September 2016, three months after the release of their first smash-hit single, they released another single called "No Games".<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/ph/album/no-games-feat-king-badger-skusta-clee/1157807641?i=1157807645 No Games (feat. King Badger and Skusta Clee) – Single on Apple Music]</ref> The track's music video was immediately uploaded on YouTube and subsequently garnering over 16 million views.

On 6 December 2016, they released "Tell Me" and the track's music video on YouTube.

In January 2017, the collective scored their first ''Billboard'' Philippine Top 20 hit entitled "No Games" which entered the local chart and peaked at number 10 after several weeks.<ref name=billboard />

However, on 7 November 2017, JRoa announced his intent to leave the group to focus on his solo musical career after releasing just one album in the label and appearing in several songs with the collective. Roa said that the group will still be the same "with or without him". Other members like [[Flow&nbsp;G]] and [[Bosx1ne]] accepted Roa's decision and pledged to support him on his future plans. (Roa (which renamed and reverted as John Roa, joined [[Viva Records (Philippines)|Viva Records]] days after his departure in the group. Meanwhile, during his departure, His participation in the track "Hayaan Mo Sila" as the main version remains.) On the same day, Ex Battalion released another single entitled "Hayaan Mo Sila" (lit. Let Them Be) along with its official video on YouTube. The track was inspired by [[DJ Khaled]]'s "[[I'm the One (DJ Khaled song)|I'm the One]]", and it immediately debuted in the Philippine Top 20 chart at number 2, their second hit single appearing on the chart.<ref name=billboard />

On 3 January 2018, the official music video of "Hayaan Mo Sila" was taken down by YouTube after hitting almost twenty million views due to a copyright claim by the producer of the beat, Diamond Style, who claims that Ex Battalion only purchased a $25 lease which covers up to 2,000 streams and up to 250,000 views only. After the event, speculations swirled online regarding the alleged use of the beat without permission; Ex Battalion explained and admitted that they have not purchased the exclusive rights of the beat by which they only got from the producer's YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why did YouTube take down Ex Battalion's hit song "Hayaan Mo Sila?"|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/showbiznews/news/36836/why-did-youtube-take-down-ex-battalions-hit-song-hayaan-mo-sila/story|website=gmanetwork.com|access-date=13 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Fallore|first1=Renuel|title=LOOK: EX BATTALION RELEASES OFFICIAL STATEMENT REGARDING "HAYAAN MO SILA" COPYRIGHT ISSUE!|url=https://myx.abs-cbn.com/features/13793/look-ex-battalion-releases-statement-regarding-h/|website=myx.abs-cbn.com|access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> After a few days, it was also removed from streaming services and digital stores. It was eventually restored in the stores including the music video on YouTube, after the issue was resolved two weeks later. Due to the massive attention, the track also rose up the charts, peaking at number 2 on the Philippine Top 20 and at number 10 on the Philippine Hot 100 in just one week. However, ''[[Billboard Philippines]]'' then ceased from publishing weekly charts.<ref name=billboard />
On 12 March 2018, the collective released their new single entitled "SouthBoys" on YouTube in another collaboration with O.C. Dawgs. Special appearances in the video included Huddass, Jnske, and Bullet-D. All of which are from O.C. Dawgs.

Choosing Nobody), after signing a management contract.

In early 2019, Delas Alas resigned as the group's manager. Delas Alas stated her reason as her inability to handle the ego of certain members who are "behaving unprofessionally".<ref>{{cite web|title=AiAi delas Alas, may payo sa Ex Battalion|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/showbiz/chikaminute/646452/aiai-delas-alas-may-payo-sa-ex-battalion/story/|website=gmanetwork.com|access-date=13 March 2018}}</ref> After Ex Battalion starred in their first box-office film, [[Sons of Nanay Sabel]] in May 2019, it was reported that [[Bosx1ne]] announced his separation from the group on 9 May 2019, citing personal reasons. However, Bosx1ne remaining with the collective was confirmed when he still appeared with his own verse in the music video of their single entitled "Pakinabang" which they released on 5 August 2019. Bosx1ne changed his screen name to Honcho in mid-2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gabinete |first1=Jojo |title=Mark Maglasang, aka Bosx1ne, kumalas na sa Ex Battalion |url=https://www.pep.ph/pepalerts/143153/mark-maglasang-aka-bosx1ne-kumalas-na-sa-ex-battalion-a734-20190509 |website=PEP.ph |access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>

In September 2020, Flow&nbsp;G released a track named "Deym" in a video advertisement for their clothing line "Brand for 199x", involving [[Skusta Clee]] as an ambassador of the brand. Netizens slam the two members for allegedly plagiarizing the song "Ddaeng" by [[BTS]], released on SoundCloud in 2018, and have made #SkustaCleeisGoingtoJailParty a trending topic on Philippine [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Two Ex Battalion members face plagiarism allegations of BTS 'Ddaeng' over 'Deym' |url=https://www.bandwagon.asia/articles/ex-battallion-flow-g-skusta-clee-accused-plagiarism-bts-j-hope-rm-suga-filipino-philippines-army-fans-ddaeng-deym-2020 |website=bandwagon.asia |date=5 October 2020 |access-date=5 October 2020}}</ref> However, a few weeks later, the group's management denied allegations and stated that the two pieces are 'inherently different' and claimed that they used a generic triplet flow. The management also added that "There will be no jail time involved even if there is a conviction of copyright infringement".<ref>{{cite web|title=Filipino ARMYs accuse Skusta Clee of plagiarizing a BTS song; Ex-Battalion management hits back with statement denying allegations |url=https://pop.inquirer.net/100801/filipino-armys-accuse-skusta-clees-deym-of-plagiarizing-bts-ddaeng-song-ex-battalion-management-hits-back-with-official-statement-denying-allegations | website=pop.inquirer.net |date=10 October 2020 |access-date=10 October 2020}}</ref>
