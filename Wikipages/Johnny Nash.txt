After a cover of Sam Cooke's "[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]" in 1976 and "Let's Go Dancing" in 1979, for many years Nash seemed to have dropped out of sight. He had a brief resurgence in the mid-1980s with the album ''Here Again'' (1986), which was preceded by the minor UK hit, "Rock Me Baby". Younger audiences were introduced to Nash's music with the appearance of [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s cover of "I Can See Clearly Now" in Disney's 1993 hit film ''[[Cool Runnings]]'', and Nash's original version appeared over the opening scene of [[John Cusack|John Cusack's]] 1997 film, ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank|Grosse Point Blank]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2020-10-07|title=I Can See Clearly Now singer Johnny Nash dies, aged 80|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2020/1007/1170051-i-can-see-clearly-now-singer-johnny-nash-dies-aged-80/|language=en}}</ref> In May 2006, Nash was singing again at [[SugarHill Recording Studios]] and at Tierra Studios in his native Houston. Working with SugarHill chief engineer Andy Bradley and Tierra Studios' Randy Miller, he began the work of transferring analog tapes of his songs from the 1970s and 1980s to [[Pro Tools]] digital format.<ref>[http://mixonline.com/mixline/johnny-nash-sugarhill-050406/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023904/http://mixonline.com/mixline/johnny-nash-sugarhill-050406/ |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mixonline.com/recording/projects/audio_clearly_houston/ |title=Clearly Houston |publisher=Mixonline |date=January 6, 2006 |access-date=August 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021163113/http://mixonline.com/recording/projects/audio_clearly_houston/ |archive-date=October 21, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
