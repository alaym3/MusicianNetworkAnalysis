'''Boys World''' is an American girl group that was formed in [[Los Angeles]] in April 2019. The group was formed by KYN Entertainment after the company directors contacted each of the members on social media, having seen their singing videos online. The group was kept a secret until January 2020, when they began posting on social media. They released their debut single "Girlfriends" in October 2020, which was followed by an extended play, ''While You Were Out'', in April 2021.

==History==
In 2019, the members of Boys World were scouted by KYN Entertainment after the company directors had seen their singing videos online. Each member was sent a direct message on [[Instagram]] about the opportunity to be in a girl group. Villaluz, the first member to be contacted, took over a month to respond to the message as she had doubts over the genuineness of the message. Kay added that it was also "hard to believe" and that they had a lot of conversations with KYN, but once it had come into motion, it felt right for her.<ref name="People">{{cite news |last1=Mier |first1=Tomás |title=Meet the Girls of Boys World!
