== Childhood and education ==
Before his school years Uusivirta moved with his parents first to [[Kotka]] and later to [[Karkkila]] due to his mother's work. At the end of elementary school he started guitar and piano lessons. He also attended art classes and a theatre club that his mother directed. In 1995 he attended the [[Mustikkamaa–Korkeasaari|Mustikkamaa]] [[midsummer]] festival in Helsinki where young Uusivirta saw [[Ismo Alanko]] perform. This performance inspired him and guided his life more towards music and performing. He also attended  [[Ruisrock]] in [[Turku]] in 1996. In the years 1997-1998 he also attended the [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde Rock Festival]] in [[Roskilde]], [[Denmark]]. When his family moved back to Helsinki in 1996 he started at the [[Kruununhaka]] secondary school in a music oriented class.[https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/suursuosittu-rock-tahti-ja-nayttelija-olavi-uusivirta-hittilevystaan-mtv-n-erikoishaastattelussa-ajattelin-etta-kaikki-uskottavuus-menee/6735732#gs.9yipj9] At the end of his secondary school years his main instrument was drums, but slowly he grew more interest in singing. He and his friends also had a cover-band in which he sung in.

During his high school years his cousin [[Jiri Kuronen]] encouraged him to try songwriting and asked him to provide lyrics to the songs he wrote. Inspired, Uusivirta started to write his own songs. He graduated from [[Kallio Upper Secondary School of the Performing Arts]] in 2002 and wrote a recording contract with [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] in the spring of his senior year.

In 2002 while working on his first album, Uusivirta auditioned for the [[Helsinki Theatre Academy]] and got into the last stage of auditions but didn't get in. He tried a second time in 2005 with the same result and got in on his third try in 2006. He graduated with a master's degree in acting in 2012.

== Career and productions ==

=== Musician ===
Uusivirta released his first album ''[[Nuoruustango]]'' at 20 years old. "Raivo Härkä", a single from that album was also featured in ''[[Bad Boys (2003 film)|Bad Boys]]'' (''Pahat Pojat'' in Finnish) a 2003 movie by [[Aleksi Mäkelä (director)|Aleksi Mäkelä]]. Two years later in 2005 Uusivirta released his second album titled ''[[Me ei kuolla koskaan]],'' which was certified [[Gold Record|gold]] nationally. From the album, two songs became radio hits: ”On niin helppoo olla onnellinen" and "Me ei kuolla koskaan".

In spring 2008 his third album ''[[Minä olen hullu]]'' was released. His fourth album ''[[Preeria]]'' was released in April 2010. Apart from CD's, Uusivirta also sold special, limited edition vinyl records of the album. Only 300 were made and they featured a photograph signed by Uusivirta. In 2012 Uusivirta released his fifth album, a [[Folk music|folk]] inspired record ''[[Elvis istuu oikealla]]''.

In February 2013 a bunch of the singer's hit songs and tracks were assembled onto a compilation album ''[[27 suosikkia]] (27 favourites).'' The album also featured five unreleased tracks.

His album ''[[Ikuiset lapset]]'' was released in February 2014 and another album ''[[Olavi (album)|Olavi]]'' two years later in 2016.

Uusivirta won the ''best rock album of the year award'' in 2016 at the Finnish music awards [[Emma-gaala|Emma gaala]] with his album ''Olavi.''

Uusivirta hosted ''Zulu'', a TV-series for youth together with actress [[Henna Vänninen]] on [[Yle TV2]] in 2003–2004. [[Yle]] would have liked to continue the program, but Uusivirta wanted to focus more on music and theatre. Since his appearance on the program Uusivirta has been asked to take part in many other music related programs but he has declined each one of them as his interests are really not on TV.

Uusivirta's first big role as an actor was in ''[[Keisarikunta]]'', a movie by director [[Pekka Mandart]]. The movie premiered in 2004 and Uusivirta played the role of [[Toni Wahlström]]. He also wrote and sung the movie's signature theme, "Ei oltu niin kuin muut".

Uusivirta played the role of [[Cisse Häkkinen]] in a 2007 movie ''Ganes'' about the [[Hurriganes]]. Uusivirta also took part in the movies ''[[Forbidden Fruit (2009 film)|Forbidden Fruit]]'' (''Kielletty hedelmä)'' and ''Rally On! (Ralliraita),'' both premiering in 2009.

He also tried voice acting dubbing in a Finnish version of the Danish animation ''Disco ormene, Discomadot'' in Finnish in 2008.

In 2010 Uusivirta played [[Rauli Somerjoki|Rauli Badding Somerjoki]] in a radio musical ''[[Rakkaudella, Rauli Badding]]'' produced by [[Radioteatteri]]. The musical was played on [[Yle Radio Suomi]] in the summer.

=== Other work ===
Uusivirta announced the recipient of the 2019 [[Finlandia Prize|Finlandia Junior Award]] for the best [[Children's literature|children's book]]. The award went to Marisha Rasi-Koskinen for her title ''Auringon pimeä puoli.''

== Personal life ==
Uusivirta supports liberal and [[left-wing politics]]. He has been seen many times actively supporting candidates in the Finnish president elections: In 2006 supporting [[Tarja Halonen]] from the social democratic party [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|SDP]] and in 2012 supporting [[Pekka Haavisto]] from the green party [[Green League|Vihreät]]. [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|SDP]] is a centre-left party and [[Green League|Vihreät]] prioritizes environment over profit-making, but has also economically liberal influencers.<ref>[https://www.vihreat.fi/ajankohtaista/antero-vartia-maailma-seisoo-kuilun-reunalla-emme-saa-paeta-vastuutamme-ilmastopolitiikassa/ Vihreat.fi Antero Vartian blogi – Jos panostaisimme reilusti puhtaisiin teknologioihin, Suomen vaikutus energiamarkkinoihin voisi olla samaa luokkaa kuin Nokian vaikutus kännyköiden maailmanlaajuiseen kehittymiseen.]
