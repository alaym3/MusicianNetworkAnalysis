===Linus Eklöw===
{{Main|Style of Eye}}
Style of Eye, Linus Eklöw's stage name, co-wrote and produced [[Icona Pop]]'s song "[[I Love It (Icona Pop song)|I Love It]]" featuring [[Charli XCX]]. Style of Eye, a Stockholm-born and based DJ and producer, resides in the [[techno]] genre and comes from the underground scene. He explores a range of musical styles, from [[techno]] to [[House music|house]] via distinct percussion and minimal, floating melodies. After growing up in a [[jazz]] and [[Soul music|soul]] oriented family and playing a drumkit at age 10, Eklöw transitioned to electronic music after getting his first computer aged 15 and making "weird downtempo dubbeat and trip hop". DJing upbeat drum and bass followed at 16, and Linus moved into studio production with releases and remixes on such labels as Classic Recordings, Tiny Sticks and Rabid Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/styleofeye/biography|title=Style of Eye|work=Resident Advisor|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref>

==History==
===2007–2012: Early career===
The duo initially met by chance at Karlsson's Robotberget studios in [[Stockholm]], sometime in 2007. In 2009, Karlsson's band [[Miike Snow]] asked Eklöw, who produces and DJs as [[Style of Eye]], to remix their song "Animal". After that, the two started hanging out in the studio together, playing each other songs and scraps of ideas. Explaining what drew him to Eklöw, Karlsson says, "He's an amazing programmer and designer of soundscapes. It was artsy, in a way. He was different."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Liz|title=Galantis – Official Bio|url=http://press.wearebigbeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Galantis-2015-Bio.pdf|website=BigBeatRecords.com}}</ref>

There were many unfinished ideas that the pair fiddled with and then abandoned, but it wasn't until sometime in 2012 that things really came together, when they stopped the loop-based and software- approach common in modern dance music and switched to Karlsson's usual method of beginning a song on guitar or piano. The duo figured out their own approach—once they create a foundation with a simple arrangement, they build it up with stirring keyboards, monumental drums, imploring vocals and inventive flourishes. "We keep the song naked, and when we feel like we have the right one, we put some clothes on it and see how it feels," says Karlsson.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Liz|title=Galantis - "Raveheart" [Video Premiere]|url=http://press.wearebigbeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Galantis-2015-Bio.pdf|website=BigBeatRecords.com}}</ref> "We realized, this is Galantis, this is our band," Karlsson adds.<ref name="auto1"/>

===2013–2014: "You", "Smile", ''Galantis'' EP, "Runaway (U & I)", and international breakthrough===
The duo signed to [[Atlantic Records Group|Atlantic Records]]' dance imprint [[Big Beat Records (American record label)|Big Beat Records]] in mid-2013. Recording in a studio in the Swedish archipelago in the [[Baltic Sea]], the duo began to focus heavily on their artistic direction. They opt to combine the excitement and big energy of electronic music with meaningful songwriting. The first composition they agreed upon was "Smile". After that, their direction became clear. "We felt the urge to fill the dance world up with songs and with songwriting that created our sound," says Eklöw.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Medved|first1=Matt|title=Official Galantis Bio|url=http://press.wearebigbeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Galantis-2015-Bio.pdf|website=BigBeatRecords.com}}</ref>

Karlsson has said: "We always start with the song. We use guitar, piano, and bass lines we don't keep to figure out which clothes we're going to put on each melody and lyric. I think that's different than a lot of others in the dance scene. They have a beat they love and then force a top line on top of it. I feel like that makes it sound like a remix. I'd rather do it our way, it's more fun too."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Medved|first1=Matt|title=Galantis Talks Songwriting, Touring, and Trying to 'Spice Things Up' with Dance|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/6077477/galantis-touring-spice-things-up-debut-album|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> The first single with Big Beat Records, "Smile", was released that following November.

Karlsson and Eklöw said: "When we started Galantis, we set out to challenge each other and experiment with all of the sounds and ideas that we find exciting. We built a studio on a small island in the Baltic Sea and our surroundings became a source of inspiration for the EP."<ref>{{cite web|year=2014|last1=Lipshutz|first1=Jason|title=Galantis EP Premiere: Stream The Duo's Debut Release|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6029379/galantis-ep-premiere-stream-the-duos-debut-release|website=Billboard}}</ref>

The first song, "Smile", has been featured by Kaskade, Diplo, Tiesto, Dada Life, Steve Angello, and Pete Tong, who featured it as an "Essential Tune", a feature on his [[BBC Radio 1]] show. Their single "You" follows with a piano and vocal hook with the custom "Galantis filter", which blends male and female vocals together. Their song "Revolution" contains synths and a beat with an intended message of never giving up on your ambitions. "Help" follows and builds a piano melody into an anthem of resiliency. "Friend (Hard Times)" pairs a vocal with a deep house groove, while "The Heart That I'm Hearing" contains synths and a skittering rhythm.<ref>{{cite web|year=2014|title=GALANTIS Self-Titled EP Out Today on Big Beat Records; Release EP Track "Revolution"; North American Tour Kicks Off at Coachella; Tickets On Sale Now at wearegalantis.com|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/01/idUSnMKWWJMQja+1fc+MKW20140401|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911081346/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/01/idUSnMKWWJMQja+1fc+MKW20140401|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-09-11|website=Reuters}}</ref>
