==Early life==
Born in [[Birkenhead]], [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], an only child, he was raised in nearby [[Meols]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Indie rocker Miles Kane and his mother Pauline on their special relationship|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/10/miles-kane-and-mother-special-relationship|publisher=theguardian.co.uk|access-date=10 April 2013|location=London|first=Shahesta|last=Shaitly|date=10 March 2013}}</ref> As a child, before learning the guitar, Kane played the saxophone. Kane's maternal cousins, James and Ian Skelly, two founding members of [[The Coral]], also had a great influence on his music taste whilst growing up.<ref>{{Citation|last=Fred Perry|title=Miles Kane in conversation with Rhys Webb|date=1 November 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AhOSqxa4lA|access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
===Band projects===
====The Little Flames====
Aged 18, Kane joined [[The Little Flames]] as guitarist alongside Eva Petersen (Vocals), Greg Mighall (Drums), Joe Edwards (Bass) and Matt Gregory (Guitar) in December 2004. The band signed to [[Deltasonic]] and were compared to label mates [[the Coral]] and high-profile bands such as the [[Arctic Monkeys]]. They also went on to tour with bands like [[the Coral]], [[the Zutons]], [[the Dead 60s]] and the [[Arctic Monkeys]]. The band split in 2007 prior to releasing their debut album, which was eventually released in 2016.

====The Rascals====
Kane, on vocals and lead guitar, was joined by [[Greg Mighall]] on drums and [[Joe Edwards (singer/bass player)|Joe Edwards]] on bass guitar and occasional backing vocals. Kane took on the main songwriting duties for the band. The band, who have known each other from childhood, continued where the Little Flames left off; they signed with Deltasonic Records again, only with fewer members this time. They were adamant to keep their own distinct sound of 'awesome rockin beats' with a 'psychedelic quirk' and a 'compelling and unique dark underlying spirit'<sup>1</sup>.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The Rascals released their debut EP in December 2007, just 7 months after they got together. Entitled ''Out of Dreams'' it featured 4 tracks but did not achieve chart success. Yet they soon became tipped to be one of ''the'' bands of 2008, championed in particular by ''[[NME]]'', following a well-received support slot on the Arctic Monkeys' 2007 tour. Their first album '[[Rascalize]]' was released on 23 June 2008. The Rascals have a small role in the film ''[[Awaydays]]'' playing an [[Echo & the Bunnymen]] cover.

The duo decided to travel to the West Coast of France with producer [[James Ford (musician)|James Ford]] where they recorded their debut album ''[[The Age of the Understatement]]'' in just two weeks.

They first played together live in the UK, doing a secret set at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] with a special guest appearance from [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], to whom Kane lent his [[iPod]] so White could learn the solo.
