'''Malice Mizer''' (stylized as '''MALICE MIZER''') was a Japanese [[visual kei]] [[Rock music|rock]] band active from August 1992 to December 2001. Formed by guitarists [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]] and [[Közi]], their earlier music and themes were characterized by their strong French and classical influences, later moving away from deliberate French romanticism and incorporating Gothic aspects after several difficulties befell the band.

Malice Mizer was as famous for their live shows as they were for their music, featuring lavish historical costumes and stage sets, short silent theater pieces preluding various songs, and even a particularly notable instance of the vocalist descending to Earth (the stage) as a fallen angel, only to ascend again at the end of the concert. Throughout their history, the band has gone through several different lineups and three drastic image changes. At their peak, they were considered one of "the big four of visual kei" alongside [[La'cryma Christi]], [[Fanatic Crisis]] and [[Shazna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ameba.jp/20121231-104/ |title=【V系】ヴィジュアル系はもう「終わり」?「2012年のV系を振り返る」第3回(ゲスト:NoGoD 団長) - |publisher= [[CyberAgent]] |access-date=2018-08-17 |date=2012-12-31}}</ref> On December 11, 2001, it was announced that Malice Mizer would go on an indefinite hiatus. Mana, Közi and bassist Yu~ki have performed together several times since 2010.

==History==

===1992–1994: Tetsu era===
[[File:Malice Mizer logo.svg|thumb|The Malice Mizer logo.]]
After leaving Matenrou, guitarists [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]] and [[Közi]] formed Malice Mizer in August 1992 with [[Tetsu Takano|Tetsu]] on vocals, Yu~ki on bass and Gaz on drums. The band's name is an abbreviation of "malice and misery", extracted from "Nothing but a being of malice and misery."  — their reply to the question "What is human?" From the outset, the band established their trademark "twin guitar"' sound, whereby two guitars play different melodies creating [[polyphony]]. Malice Mizer's sound during the Tetsu era was a mixture of early 1980s [[gothic rock]], [[progressive rock]] and strong classical influences. Their first official release was the song "Speed of Desperate" on the 1993 compilation ''Brain Trash''. Before this, they had released a demo tape called "Sans Logique" (a nod to French pop singer [[Mylène Farmer]]'s hit song "[[Sans Logique]]") which contained no vocals. Shortly after the release of ''Brain Trash'', Gaz left the band to join Kneuklid Romance, while Kneuklid Romance's drummer [[Kami (musician)|Kami]] in turn joined Malice Mizer. In 1994, after a couple more demos, the band released their debut album ''[[Memoire (album)|Memoire]]'' on Mana's newly founded [[independent record label]] [[Midi:Nette]]. It was re-released it at the end of the year with an additional bonus track, "Baroque", under the title ''Memoire DX''. Only days later, singer and lyricist Tetsu left the band after his last gig on December 27, 1994. While the exact reasons are unknown, Tetsu went on to take a different direction in his work. The band's continued use of his lyrics in songs they continued to perform with later vocalists suggest an amicable split.

===1995–1999: Gackt era===
[[File:Visual kei.jpg|right|thumb|Fans [[cosplay]]ing as Mana, Yu~ki and Közi in [[Shibuya]], October 1998]]
After almost a year of inactivity, Malice Mizer recruited [[Gackt]] as their new vocalist and released the single "Uruwashiki Kamen no Shoutaijou" on December 10, 1995. It was with this single that Malice Mizer started to actively differentiate themselves from other bands; when the song was performed live, Mana and Közi put down their guitars and instead performed a dance routine.<ref name="sessions">{{cite web|title=【インタビュー】Mana × Közi、MALICE MIZERを語る「Kamiの約束が実現できる」|url=https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000158491|work=Barks|language=ja|date=2018-08-29 |access-date=2021-01-02}}</ref> With a new concept, the band's music became more [[art rock]] and [[synthpop]], incorporating even stronger classical and electronic elements. Visually, the band abandoned their 1980s goth look for colorful historical costumes with a gothic feel.

Malice Mizer released their second album, ''[[Voyage ~Sans Retour~]]'', in 1996, and their first home video in 1997; ''Sans Retour Voyage "Derniere" ~Encoure Une Fois~'', a concert video recorded at [[Shibuya Public Hall]] featuring an elaborate stage and dance routines.<ref name="sessions"/> The band became increasingly popular and signed with major record label [[Nippon Columbia]] that same year, where they released a number of successful singles and a short film, ''Bel Air ~Kuuhaku no Shunkan no Naka de~ de L'image''. Their major label debut album, ''[[Merveilles (album)|Merveilles]]'', was released in 1998. The band even had their own radio show around this time and played a two-day live at the [[Nippon Budokan]], which involved a large building as a stage prop and elaborate theatrics; each member performing a skit with another member on their own (including [on "Le Ciel"] the aforementioned skit in which Gackt fell to the stage [to sing the song] and returned to "Heaven" by song's end). It was a massive success and was released on video as ''Merveilles l'espace''. In July 1998, the [[Yokohama Arena]]'s stage would be the last for Gackt as in January 1999, at the height of Malice Mizer's success, he would suddenly leave the band. No reason was given, but after just four months he would release his first solo EP. Malice Mizer left Nippon Columbia shortly after and returned to Midi:Nette.

A few months after Gackt's departure, drummer [[Kami (musician)|Kami]] died of a [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] on June 21, 1999. He left behind a handful of songs, which the band eventually released as part of the [[Extended play|EP]]/video boxset ''[[Shinwa (EP)|Shinwa]]'', which consists of two songs composed by him and the short track "Saikai" written by the band. Kami was never officially replaced; from that point on, Malice Mizer would only use support drummers (namely ex-[[Aion (Japanese band)|Aion]] member Shu, who is not shown in the band's later promotional material, nor credited) and Kami would be credited as "eternal blood relative" on all their future releases. Possibly due to Kami's death and other factors, the band shifted to a "darker" image and sound.

===2000–2001: Klaha era===
In the second half of 1999 and the beginning of 2000, Malice Mizer, still without an official vocalist, released a number of singles and began to work on a new album. Eventually, they recruited [[Klaha]] (vocalist of [[dark wave]] band Pride of Mind), officially inducted into the band as a full member in January. By then the band had abandoned the lighter pop music sound of the Gackt era for a dramatic mixture of [[European classical music|classical music]], [[dark wave]], with slight [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] elements, and adopted an elaborate funerary elegant gothic look. In the summer of 2000, they released what would be their last album, ''[[Bara no Seidou]]''. On August 31 and September 1, they gave a theatrical two-day live at the Nippon Budokan, featuring pyrotechnics, a choir of veiled nuns and a scaled-down cathedral as a stage prop. In 2001, Malice Mizer starred in a feature-length [[vampire]] movie (''[[Bara no Konrei ~Mayonaka ni Kawashita Yakusoku~]]''), and released three more singles: "Gardenia", "Beast of Blood" and "Garnet ~Kindan no Sono e~"; "Gardenia" and "Garnet" being of a considerably lighter tone than their previous album, suggesting another new era for the band. However, the band members decided to go their own separate ways in 2001, leaving messages on their official website, which can still be viewed today. The split was spoken of as a "hiatus", so as not to exclude the possibility of a future reformation.

===Post projects===
After his departure in 1994, [[Tetsu Takano|Tetsu]] released one solo album, and has subsequently taken part in a series of bands such as [[Zigzo]], Mega 8 Ball, [[Nil (band)|Nil]]; his most recent being The JuneJulyAugust.

After his departure in early 1999, [[Gackt]] started a solo career a year later which has been enormously successful; he is one of Japan's top musicians and TV personalities.<ref>{{cite book|title=Global Glam and Popular Music: Style and Spectacle from the 1970s to the 2000s|editor=Ian Chapman, Henry Johnson|date=2016|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781317588191|chapter=Visual Kei: Glamour in Japanese Pop Music|author=Henry Johnson, Akitsugu Kawamoto|page=202}}</ref>

[[Klaha]] started a solo career as well in December 2002, but in the middle of 2004 it was announced that his fan club would be closing down, and after that there have been long periods of silence, only broken by rare updates on his site. In 2007 he stated on his site that he would resume musical activity that year. But this did not happen and no information has been announced since.

Yu~ki has not been active on the music scene since 2004 when he wrote the song "[[Memento (single)|Memento]]", about [[Kami (musician)|Kami]], for Közi's solo project. In an informal conversation with Klaha, he said he would like to return to the music scene.

[[Közi]] formed the [[Industrial music|industrial]] duo [[Eve of Destiny]] with Haruhiko Ash (ex:The Zolge) and also started a solo career. As of Halloween 2008 he is part of the band Dalle. Around June 2010, Közi started to perform with a band called My Horror Revue. He has also formed the band XA-VAT, who held their first performance on November 16, 2010 and released their first single on December 2.<ref name="XA-VAT">{{cite web| title = XA-VAT Information| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/news-68636-kozi-s-new-band-xa-vat.html| access-date =November 27, 2010}}</ref> In 2012, he formed the band ZIZ with the musicians who supported him with his solo career.

Mana has formed his own solo project [[Moi dix Mois]], which has performed live concerts across Europe. In addition to the successful solo project, Mana is a designer for his fashion label [[Moi-même-Moitié]] (created in 1999), which focuses on the styles [[Elegant Gothic Aristocrat]] and [[Elegant Gothic Lolita]]. He also continues to run his indie record label [[Midi:Nette]], and has produced for artists such as [[Schwarz Stein]] and [[Kanon Wakeshima]].

Malice Mizer's song "Gekka no Yasoukyoku" was covered by [[D (band)|D]] on the compilation ''Crush! -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-'', which was released on January 26, 2011 and features current [[visual kei]] bands covering songs from bands that were important to the '90s visual kei movement.<ref>{{cite web| title = D covers Malice Mizer song| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/news-69786--90s-visual-kei-cover-album.html| access-date =November 26, 2010}}</ref> Their song "Illuminati" was covered by Moran on its sequel, ''Crush! 2 -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-'', that was released on November 23, 2011.<ref>{{cite web| title = Aoi, Moran, and more to release '90s Visual Kei cover album| work = tokyohive.com| url = http://www.tokyohive.com/2011/09/aoi-moran-and-more-to-release-90s-visual-kei-cover-album/| access-date = 2011-09-28}}</ref>

===Deep Sanctuary reunions===
[[File:MALICE MIZER session DSV.png|right|thumb|Közi, Yu~ki and Mana performing together at the Deep Sanctuary V event in 2016.]]
Since 2008, Mana's band Moi dix Mois has held a special event, most taking place every two years, which has had some sort of connection to Malice Mizer.<ref name="sessions"/> The first was Dis Inferno Vol.VI ~Last Year Party~ on December 27, 2008, where Malice Mizer's "Speed of Desperate" was played in a session by Mana on drums, Közi on guitar and Mana's cousin {{nihongo|Katsuo U.K|カツヲU.K|}} on vocals.<ref name="sessions"/> Közi said that this was the first time he and Mana had met since 2001.<ref name="sessions"/> In 2009, Moi dix Mois and Közi went on a short two-date tour called Deep Sanctuary, on July 17 in Osaka and the 19th in Tokyo.

A year later in July 2010, Közi once again went on a tour with Moi dix Mois, titled Deep Sanctuary II. This tour had six shows, but the gig at [[Akasaka Blitz]] on the 17th was special, as Yu~ki was a special guest.<ref name="sessions"/><ref name="Deep Sanctuary II Tour">{{cite web| title = Moi dix Mois tour with Közi and Yu~ki| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/news-59635-moi-dix-mois-album-and-coupling-tour-with-special-guests.html| access-date =November 26, 2010}}</ref> This was the first time in 9 years that the three original members of Malice Mizer played together, and they were supported by Hayato (Moi dix Mois) on drums. They played "Saikai no Chi to Bara" and "Beast of Blood", as well as a cover of [[Rob Zombie]]'s "What Lurks on Channel X?". In 2012, the three played together twice more for Deep Sanctuary III;<ref>{{cite web| title = Deep Sanctuary III| work = jame-world.com| url = https://www.jame-world.com/en/article/107697-deep-sanctuary-iii.html| access-date =2020-06-21}}</ref> once on September 12 at Akasaka Blitz and again on November 14, 2012 at Osaka Muse Hall.

In 2014, another reunion of the three original members happened for Deep Sanctuary IV at Akasaka Blitz on October 11. This marked the first time they performed under the Malice Mizer name since 2001. It was followed by Deep Sanctuary V at Akasaka Blitz on August 7, 2016. On September 8 and 9, 2018, Mana, Közi, and Yu~ki reunited as Malice Mizer to perform two shows for the band's 25th anniversary special at Tokyo Toyosu Pit.<ref name="sessions"/> Titled Deep Sanctuary VI, Moi dix Mois and ZIZ also performed. They were supported on drums by [[Sakura (musician)|Sakura]], who was Kami's drum mentor, and who used Kami's original drum kit for the show.<ref name="sessions"/> Mana tried reaching out to Tetsu, Gackt and Klaha regarding their participation, but the first two declined and he was unable to reach the third.<ref name="sessions"/> Instead, the band's former [[roadie]]s Shuji ([[Cali Gari]]), [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]], and Hitomi filled in as guest vocalists.<ref name="sessions"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000160448|title=【ライヴレポート】MALICE MIZER＜25th Anniversary Special＞、「Kamiも降臨しています」|website=BARKS|language=ja|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref> A [[Blu-ray]] of the concert was released on June 21, 2019.

Deep Sanctuary VII was scheduled to take place at [[Mynavi Blitz Akasaka]] on June 7, 2020, but was cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Japan]].

Mana stated that the {{nihongo|''Doyou Waido Gekijou''|[[:ja:土曜ワイド劇場|土曜ワイド劇場]]}} opening theme music scared him a lot in childhood and Malice Mizer's music has its roots in that experience.<ref name="PopBeat9802">{{cite journal |journal=Pop Beat |title=MALICE MIZER すべてはひとつの物語の中に… |pages=129–131 |date=1998-02-01 |author=増渕公子 |language=ja}}</ref>
