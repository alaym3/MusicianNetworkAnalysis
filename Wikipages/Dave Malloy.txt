== Career ==
Malloy grew up in [[Lakewood, Ohio]] and studied music composition and English literature at [[Ohio University]]. He began making theater in San Francisco in 2000.<ref>Schulman, Michael. [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/06/natasha-pierre-great-comet-rocking-out.html "Rocking Out to "War and Peace"]. The New Yorker, June 13, 2013</ref> Early work included pieces with [[Banana Bag & Bodice]], for whom he has been the composer since 2002.<ref>Cote, David. [http://www.timeout.com/newyork/theater/theater-in-new-york-q-a-with-dave-malloy "Theater in New York: Q&A with Dave Malloy"]. Time Out New York, March 26, 2013</ref>

In 2008 he composed music for ''Beowulf&nbsp;– A Thousand Years of Baggage'', a [[Banana Bag & Bodice]] SongPlay written by Jason Craig and commissioned by the [[Shotgun Players]] in Berkeley, California. ''Beowulf'' received the 2008 [[Will Glickman|Glickman]] Award and a 2011 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Herald Angel]], and has played a number of venues and festivals, including [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre|Berkeley Repertory]]'s Roda Theatre, ART's [[Club Oberon]], [[Joe's Pub]], and festivals in England, Ireland, Scotland and Australia.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://bananabagandbodice.org/show/beowulf/ | location=New York | work=Banana Bag & Bodice|title=Beowulf}}</ref>

After ''Beowulf'', he co-created and performed in ''Three Pianos'', a drunken romp through [[Schubert]]'s "[[Winterreise]]" (with Rick Burkhardt and [[Alec Duffy]], directed by [[Rachel Chavkin]]) that premiered in 2010 at the [[Ontological-Hysteric Theater]], winning a Special Citation [[Obie Award]], and had runs at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] and [[American Repertory Theater]].<ref>Soloski, Alexis.

His next work was ''Beardo,'' a Russian indie rock musical based on the life of [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], which Malloy wrote with ''Beowulf'' collaborator Jason Craig. It played in 2011 in San Francisco and had its New York premiere in February 2017 in a production by Pipeline Theater Company.
 
For ''[[Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812]]'', Malloy was the composer, lyricist, orchestrator, music director and performer in the role of [[Pierre Bezukhov]]. ''Comet'' was commissioned by [[Ars Nova (theater)|Ars Nova]] and premiered there in October 2012, directed by Chavkin; in May 2012 the show transferred to [[off-Broadway]] playing in Kazino, a tent custom-built for the piece, first erected in the Meatpacking District and then in Times Square. In December 2015 the show played a pre-Broadway run at the [[American Repertory Theater]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The show has won an [[Obie Award]], the 2013 Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theater, the Off Broadway Alliance's Best New Musical Award, three [[Elliot Norton Awards]], eight [[IRNE Awards]], eleven [[Lucille Lortel Awards]] nominations (winning three), five [[Drama Desk]] nominations, and two [[Drama League Award]] nominations.<ref>Weinert-Kendt, Rob.

Malloy reprised his role as Pierre multiple times throughout the run, and was the final Broadway Pierre.

''[[Ghost Quartet]]'' opened in October 2014 at the Bushwick Starr. After an extended sold out run, the piece transferred to the McKittrick Hotel, home of ''[[Sleep No More (2011 play)|Sleep No More]]'', and has since played in a number of cities, including Edinburgh, San Francisco, and Cambridge, where it won an [[Elliot Norton Award]]. The piece is a staged concept album, about love, death, and whiskey.<ref>Kozinn, Allan.

He worked with playwright Krista Knight to write "Don't Stop Me: A New Musical", a "danceathon to the death" centered on the high school experience. While the show was in performances, his next musical, ''[[Preludes (musical)|Preludes]]'', a piece about [[Rachmaninoff]] and hypnosis, premiered at [[Lincoln Center Theater]] in June 2015.
