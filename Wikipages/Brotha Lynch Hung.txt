==Music career==

===Musical style===

Although often credited as being a major pioneer and even the main creator of the [[horrorcore]] rap genre, Mann himself has claimed that his style is less literally “horrorcore” and instead falls more directly under his own distinct category or sub-category of rap called “Ripgut” which specifically emphasizes (usually graphic) violence.

The Ripgut genre itself reportedly stemmed from his love of [[meat]] but this lyrical style is also sometimes considered to be either associated with or connected to the common thoughts and feelings occasionally experienced during [[Mania|manic]] and/or violent states of mind brought on by the use of certain illicit drugs such as [[phencyclidine]] (PCP).{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

===Beginnings===
Mann was influenced by KZ appeared on and produced 11 of the 12 tracks on [[X-Raided]]'s 1992 debut album ''[[Psycho Active]]''. Brotha Lynch Hung, [[X-Raided]], and Sicx recorded the cassette ''Niggaz in Blacc'' in 1991. It is regarded by Mann as "some of my best work."<ref name="interview"/>
