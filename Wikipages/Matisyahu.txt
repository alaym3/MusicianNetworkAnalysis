In autumn 1995, Matisyahu attended a two-month program at the [[Alexander Muss High School]] in [[Hod Hasharon]], [[Israel]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/matisyahu.html| title= Matisyahu| work= Jewish Virtual Library| publisher= American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise| access-date= December 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Hap|last=Mansfield|url=http://smmercury.com/2013/01/26/qa-matisyahu-on-the-power-of-music-to-feel-understood/|title=Q&A: Matisyahu on music's power to make you feel understood|work=The San Marcos Mercury|date=January 26, 2013|access-date=May 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Nick|last=McGregor|url=http://www.staugustine.com/surf-drift/2011-08-22/matisyahu-mixes-hip-hop-hebrew-influences-blend-modern-music|title=Matisyahu mixes hip-hop, Hebrew influences into blend of modern music|work=[[The St. Augustine Record]]|date=August 22, 2011|access-date=May 1, 2018}}</ref> The program offers students first-hand exploration of Jewish heritage as a way of solidifying Jewish identity. After he finished Muss, he returned to New York, where he subsequently left high school after the first day of his senior year to travel throughout the U.S. . A stint in a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation center]] in upstate New York followed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Miller then attended a wilderness expedition trip in [[Oregon]] for teenagers. "It was not necessarily for drug rehabilitation, but that was part of the reason I was out there," he explained to a journalist of ''The Jewish Daily Forward'' in 2008.<ref name= Horn>{{cite news|last=Horn|first=Jordana|title=Evolution of an Icon: Matisyahu's Musical and Spiritual Journey| url= http://forward.com/articles/14743/evolution-of-an-icon-matisyahu-s-musical-and-sp/|access-date=16 April 2013| newspaper= [[The Jewish Daily Forward]] |date=Dec 18, 2008}}</ref> He finished high school at a wilderness program in [[Bend, Oregon]].<ref>{{cite news| last= Anderman| first= Joan| url= http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/06/20/jewish_mc_rocks_the_mike_and_keeps_it_kosher/?page=2 |title= Jewish MC rocks the mike and keeps it kosher| work= [[Boston Globe]]| date= June 20, 2004| access-date= December 13, 2016}}</ref> In Oregon, he identified himself as "Matt, the Jewish rapper kid from New York." Matisyahu has contrasted this time in Oregon to his life in New York City. "I was suddenly the token Jew. This was now my search for my own identity, and part of Judaism feeling more important and relevant to me."

He returned to New York and started developing his reggae, spending hours in his room, writing and practicing his style to the accompaniment of hip-hop tapes. He recounts that at the same time, he started praying, getting himself a [[siddur|prayer book]] and [[tallit|prayer shawl]]. He learned of the Orthodox Jewish Carlebach Shul [[synagogue]] on the [[Upper West Side]] of Manhattan in New York City, and he began attending religious services every [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], as well as wearing a [[yarmulke]] (head covering) and [[tzitzit]] (a fringed undergarment). <ref name= Horn />

==Career==
Miller performed for over a year as '''MC Truth''' in [[Bend, Oregon]]. In 2004, after having signed with [[JDub Records]], he released his first album, ''[[Shake Off the Dust...Arise]]''. At [[2005 Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo 2005]], [[Trey Anastasio]] of the band [[Phish]] invited him for a guest spot on his set.<ref>Serpick, Evan.

In 2005 and 2006, he toured extensively in the United States, Canada, and Europe; and made a number of stops in [[Israel]], including a performance as the supporting act for [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] in June 2006. In late 2006, he released ''[[No Place to Be]]'', a remix album featuring re-recordings and remixes of songs from all three of his earlier albums, as well as a cover of "[[Message in a Bottle (The Police song)|Message in a Bottle]]" by [[The Police]].

The accompanying video and album, ''Youth'', produced by [[Bill Laswell]], was released on March 7, 2006. On March 16, ''Youth'' was ''Billboard'' magazine's number-one Digital Album. In 2006, he appeared once again at Bonnaroo, this time performing a solo set.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonnaroo |website=Buzznet.com |url=http://www.buzznet.com/tags/bonnaroo/video/25802/matisyahu-sings-king-without-crown/ |access-date=2010-02-15 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

On March 1, 2006, right before the release of ''Youth'', he informed JDub that he no longer needed its management services. He has since been represented by former Capitol Records president Gary Gersh. JDub claims the artist has three years remaining on a four-year management contract. JDub managed his act, but was not his record label.<ref>Sisario, Ben.

In November 2009, NBC used Matisyahu's song "One Day" as background music for their advertisement of the Olympic games. This stirred up speculation that "One Day" might become the theme song for the 2010 Olympics.

==Artistry==

=== Musical style ===
[[File:Matisyahu at a concert.jpg|thumb|Matisyahu performance in 2005]]
Matisyahu fuses the African-influenced styles of reggae, rap, [[beatboxing]], and hip-hop with vocal disciplines of jazz's [[scat singing]] and Judaism's [[hazzan]] style of songful prayer.  The ''[[New York Times]]''{{'}} [[Kelefa Sanneh]] wrote that "His sound owes a lot to early dancehall reggae stars like [[Barrington Levy]] and [[Eek-a-Mouse]]."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/arts/music/08mati.html | work=The New York Times | title=Dancehall With a Different Accent | first=Kelefa | last=Sanneh | date=March 8, 2006 | access-date=May 12, 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025203848/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/arts/music/08mati.html | archive-date=October 25, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s Kevin Pang described a Matisyahu performance as "soul-shaking brand of [[dancehall reggae]], a show that captures both the [[jam band]] vibe of Phish and the [[ska]]-[[punk music|punk]] of Sublime."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-03-06/features/0603060009_1_matisyahu-reggae-hasidic| work= [[Chicago Tribune]] | title=Matisyahu rocks jammed Riviera with steady beats| first=Kevin | last=Pang | date=March 6, 2006 | access-date=March 14, 2013}}</ref> Coming from his Jewish beliefs and compounding his use of the hazzan style, Matisyahu's lyrics are mostly English with more than occasional use of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]].

In 2006, Matisyahu stated that "All of my songs are influenced and inspired by the teachings that inspire me. I want my music to have meaning, to be able to touch people and make them think. Chassidus teaches that music is 'the quill of the soul.' Music taps into a very deep place and speaks to us in a way that regular words can't."<ref>{{cite interview| author= Matisyahu|url=http://www.chabad.org/article.asp?AID=376771 |access-date=April 11, 2006 |url-status=dead |title= Matisyahu's Passover| year= 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070110040311/http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=376771 |archive-date= January 10, 2007 }}</ref>

In 2009, he said about his recently released album ''[[Light (Matisyahu album)|Light]]'', "I think the vast majority of people that respect what I do are willing to move with me. I think it's not so much about genres or styles of music as it is about expressing the emotion or the idea. ... Whatever allows you to do that, whatever style, as long as it's authentic." However, he has been criticized for cultural appropriation of Rastafarian, Jamaican and African American musical styles and imagery.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Liebovitz |first1=Liel |title=Matisyahu and race: Is it okay for a white Jew to sing reggae? |url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1606534/posts |website=Free Republic |publisher=Chicago Jewish News |access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref>

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
Matisyahu met [[NYU]] film student Tahlia (née Silverman) when she interviewed him for a documentary about men and women not touching each other. They were set up by Rabbi Dov Yonah Korn, NYU's Chabad chaplain,<ref>They were set up by Rabbi Korn ('You have to set up a date through the rabbi') and went through a dating process that Matisyahu admits would make a great premise for a sitcom. 'After the date she called the rabbi and told him what happened, and I called the rabbi and told him what happened. Then we decided if we wanted to go another date. By the third date, I knew this was the person I wanted to marry.'</ref> and they married in August 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/matisyahu.html |title=Matisyahu |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=2012-01-03}}</ref>  Together they have sons Laivy (2005), Shalom,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustream.tv/matisyahu |title=Matisyahu Live Chat – Monday 3/8 @ 4:30PM EST, Ustream.TV: Join Matisyahu on Monday 3/8 at 4:30pm EST for a live chat! |publisher=Ustream.tv |access-date=2010-10-19}}</ref> and Menachem Mendel (2011).<ref>December 11, 2011 episode of 'Chef Roble & Co' where he catered a Kosher Vegan Event for Matisyahu</ref>

In 2014, Matisyahu confirmed that he had divorced his wife approximately two years before, but they remain on good terms and were sharing parenting responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/matisyahu-on-akeda-his-religious-evolution-divorce-and-dealing-with-a-lot-of-rejection-6465978|title=Matisyahu on Akeda, His Religious Evolution, Divorce, and "Dealing With a Lot of Rejection"|author=David Rolland|work=Miami New Times|date=2014-04-22}}</ref>

Matisyahu has also fathered a child named Sasha Lillian, who was born while he was on tour with Adel Tawil in Germany. Former girlfriend Toma Danley gave birth to Sasha on April 2, 2014 in Portland, Oregon where the newborn was diagnosed with a rare heart defect. Sasha underwent open-heart surgery in May 2015, and another in January 2017. She has reportedly recovered well. 
Sasha has lived with Danley since their daughter's birth. Matisyahu and Danley met in 1997 while he was attending a wilderness program for drug and alcohol recovery in Bend, Oregon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/matisyahus-baby-gets-heart-surgery/|title=Matisyahu's baby gets heart surgery|work=The Times of Israel}}</ref>

Matisyahu became engaged to Talia Dressler on April 20, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bwf6oKlg_DI/|title=Login • Instagram}}</ref>

Matisyahu and Talia were married at a private wedding ceremony, held in Matisyahu's backyard, on May 19, 2019 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/263404|title=Watch: Daniel Zamir plays at Matisyahu's wedding}}</ref> They have one daughter,  born in 2020.{{cn|date=August 2021}}

=== Religion ===
From 2001 through July 2007, Matisyahu was affiliated with the [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] community in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], New York, whose rabbi officiated at his wedding in 2004. Soon after his adoption of Hasidism, Matisyahu began [[Torah study|studying Torah]] at [[Hadar Hatorah]], a [[yeshiva]] for returnees to Judaism where he wrote and recorded his first album. He counts [[Bob Marley]], [[Phish]],<ref>Rolling Stone.

As part of his faith, he strictly observed the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sundown on Friday; thus he did not perform in concert on Friday nights.  An exception to this rule occurred at a 2007 concert in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]; since the sun did not set until 2:00&nbsp;a.m., performing in the late hours was not a violation of Jewish observance.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jacobs |first=Cheryl |url=http://www.oychicago.com/article.aspx?blogmonth=6&blogday=17&blogyear=2008&blogid=132 |title=Articles |publisher=Oy!Chicago |date=2008-06-17 |access-date=2012-07-25}}</ref>

However, as of July 17, 2007, he told the ''Miami New Times'' in an interview that he no longer "necessarily" identifies with the Lubavitch movement. In the interview he stated that "...the more I'm learning about other types of Jews, I don't want to exclude myself. I felt boxed in."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2007/07/matisyahu_preview.php|title=Matisyahu Tonight at Sound Advice Amphitheatre|author=Jonathan Cunningham|date=July 17, 2007|work=Crossfade|access-date=December 29, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, in the fall of 2007, while on a family vacation spent primarily in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Nachlaot]] neighborhood, he expressed interest in another Hasidic group, that of [[Karlin (Hasidic Dynasty)|Karlin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/910759.html|title=The Bob and the Baba|date=October 9, 2007|work=Haaretz.com|access-date=December 29, 2014}}</ref> As of November 2007 he had confirmed a preference to pray at the Karliner synagogue in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]] where the custom is to ecstatically scream prayers; however he continued to reside in Crown Heights because of his wife's affinity for the community.<ref>Nussbaum Cohen, Debra.

{{quote|No more Chassidic reggae superstar. Sorry folks, all you get is me...no alias.

When I started becoming religious 10 years ago it was a very natural and organic process.  It was my choice.  My journey: to discover my roots and explore Jewish spirituality—not through books but through real life.  At a certain point I felt the need to submit to a higher level of religiosity...to move away from my intuition and to accept an ultimate truth.  I felt that in order to become a good person I needed rules—lots of them—or else I would somehow fall apart.  I am reclaiming myself.  Trusting my goodness and my divine mission.

Get ready for an amazing year filled with music of rebirth.  And for those concerned with my naked face, don’t worry...<br/>
you haven’t seen the last of my facial hair.}}

=== Origin of his name ===
''Matisyahu'' is an [[Ashkenazic Hebrew]] pronunciation of a [[Biblical Hebrew]] name (מתתיהו – ''Mattithyahu''; [[Israeli Hebrew]] pronunciation: ''Matityahu''; Greek: [[Mattathias]]/ [[Matthew (name)|Matthaios]], meaning "Gift of God"), the name of the 2nd-century BC Jewish leader of the [[Maccabees]]' revolt.

In an interview in ''Kosher Spirit Magazine'' (a publication by [[OK Kosher Certification]]), Matisyahu explained the origin of his use of the name as follows: while he, like most Jewish boys, received a Hebrew name at his [[brit milah]] (circumcision ceremony), when he was eight days old, Miller's family lost track of the names given. In Hebrew school, it was assumed to be Matisyahu because of the connection between Matthew and Matisyahu. The original certificate of bris was later located and Miller discovered that the actual name given at the bris was the Yiddish name "Feivish Hershel". He was advised by his rabbis to continue using the Hebrew name that he had grown up with.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kosherspirit.com/Article.asp?Issue=7&Article=88 |access-date=February 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110052057/http://www.kosherspirit.com/Article.asp?Issue=7&Article=88 |archive-date=January 10, 2016 |title=Fall 2005 - Kosher Spirit }}</ref>
