'''The 77s''' (alternatively spelled '''the Seventy Sevens''' or '''the 77's''') is an American [[rock music|rock]] band consisting of [[Michael Roe]] on vocals/guitar, [[Mark Harmon (musician)|Mark Harmon]] on bass guitar, and [[Bruce Spencer]] on drums.

==History==
The group was “formed at a church by a church” under the name Scratch Band in Sacramento, California, during the late 1970s according to Mike Roe.<ref name=Powell>{{cite book |last1=Powell |first1=Mark |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |date=2002 |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |location=Peabody, MA |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |pages=811-817 |edition=Second 2003}}</ref> Accompanying him were Mark Tootle on guitar and keyboards, Jan Eric Volz on bass guitar, and Mark Proctor on drums. They were occasionally joined by singer Sharon McCall and guitarist [[Jimmy A]]. Their repertoire included originals and songs by English poet [[Steve Scott (poet)|Steve Scott]] among others. The “church” that brought the players together was Sacramento's Warehouse Christian Ministries with the band being a part of the ministries artistic outreach, performing every weekend at the Warehouse.<ref name=Powell/><ref name=Alfonso>{{cite book |last1=Alfonso |first1=Barry |title=The Billboard Guide to Contemporary Christian Music |date=2002 |publisher=Billboard Books/Watson-Guptill Publications |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8230-7718-7 |pages=238-241 |edition=First}}</ref> The name of the band was changed to The Seventy Sevens before the release of their first album, ''[[Ping Pong Over the Abyss]]'' in 1982, on WCM’s own Exit label. While the meaning of the group's name has never been revealed, it is thought to be derived from either Matt 18:22, Daniel 9 or, simply, a year – possibly 1977 – which holds some significance to the band. In 1984, the group toured with labelmate [[Vector (band)|Vector]] and [[Resurrection Band]] with all 3 bands playing the very first Cornerstone festival.<ref name=Powell/>

When Proctor left the band, he was replaced by [[Aaron Smith (musician)|Aaron Smith]], who appeared on the album ''[[All Fall Down (The 77s album)|All Fall Down]]'' (1984) and remained with the band until 1995. Smith had been a former sideman with Ray Charles and The Temptations and a member of Vector.<ref name=Powell/><ref name=Alfonso/> The next album, ''The Seventy Sevens'', was released by [[Island Records]] in 1987. While the album received favorable reviews, it did not sell as well as it might; the reason being ''[[The Joshua Tree (album)|The Joshua Tree]]'' by labelmate [[U2]] was released that same year. In his article on the subject, John Thompson (True Tunes) thought it likely that Island put most of its resources into promoting ''The Joshua Tree'' while others on the label received less promotional support. The album received a positive review by Rolling Stone critic, Margot Mifflin: "the 77s have come up with a sound that suggests not only that they know where they’re coming from, but also that they’re going places". Mark Alan Powell called it "an artistic masterpiece – probably one of the ten best albums of the year not simply in the Christian market but in rock and roll, period".<ref name=Powell/> 

A compilation album – ''Sticks and Stones'' (1990) and a live album – ''88'' (1991) (which contained a manic version of ''Over, Under, Sideways, Down'') were released after their eponymous Island Records release. At some point in 1992 Tootle and Volz left the band which left Roe as the only original member. David Leonhardt (guitar) joined in early 1992 with Mark Harmon (bass) joining that year also, replacing Tootle and Volz.<ref name=Powell/>

''Pray Naked'' was released in 1992 but the title was changed by the label, [[Word Records]], to ''The Seventy Sevens''. The album title change would cause confusion in the minds of consumers and marketers since the 1987 album on Island bore the same name.<ref name=Powell/> This was followed by  ''[[Drowning with Land in Sight]]'' in 1994. Leonhardt and Smith left the band soon after, with Smith being replaced by former bandmate [[Bruce Spencer]] of [[Vector (band)|Vector]]. This change brought about a new version of the band, namely a power trio line up with Harmon, Roe and Spencer which started referring to itself as “the band that won’t go away”. It also brought the release of ''Tom Tom Blues'' (1995).<ref name=Powell/>  

At the end of the 1996, The 77s started the label ''[[Fools of the World]]'' and reissued some of its albums. New material was also released following the label's formation: ''[[Echoes o' Faith]]'' (1996 live acoustic material), ''EP'' (1999) and ''[[A Golden Field of Radioactive Crows]]'' (2001).<ref name=Alfonso/> Also, Scott Reams occasionally played in the band during concerts beginning in 2000.<ref name=Powell/>
 
In 2010, The 77's participated in the tribute album ''Mister Bolin's Late Night Revival'', a compilation of 17 unreleased tracks written by [[Tommy Bolin]]. <ref>[http://www.misterbolinslatenightrevival.com/ Mister Bolin's Late Night Revival, 2010]</ref>

Critically, the 77s are considered by fans and music critics; such as Dwight Ozzard (''Prism'' magazine), Brian Quincy Newcomb (''[[HM magazine|HM]]'') and John Thompson (''[[True Tunes News|True Tunes]]''), as the greatest – or “best” depending on whom one might quote, rock and roll band in the world.<ref name=Powell/>

==7&7iS==
Members of The 77s have used the moniker 7&7is to release projects that they do not see as fitting under their regular band name.  The name comes from the title of a [[7 and 7 Is|classic song]] by the 60s music group [[Love (band)|Love]], called "7 and 7 Is."

The name was first used for [[Alternative Records]]' 1989 collection of rarities and outtakes (later released as ''More Miserable Than You'll Ever Be''). The name was revived in 2004 for ''Fun with Sound'', a collaboration between lead singer [[Michael Roe]] and bassist [[Mark Harmon (musician)|Mark Harmon]]. Harmon and Roe also toured that year under the name.
