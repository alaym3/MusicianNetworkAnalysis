{{Main|The Voice: la plus belle voix (season 2)}}
In 2013, her first real breakthrough came with her taking part in ''The Voice: la plus belle voix'''s [[The Voice: la plus belle voix (season 2)|second season]]. She auditioned with "Un homme heureux" by [[William Sheller]] with all four coaches [[Florent Pagny]], [[Jenifer (singer)|Jenifer]], [[Louis Bertignac]] and [[Garou (singer)|Garou]] turning their chairs. She opted to be part of Team Louis Bertignac. Her "blind audition" episode was broadcast on 16 February 2013.

23 March 2013, during the Musical Battles round, she was picked by Bertignac against her rival Diana Espir, after both interpreted "[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]" by [[Natalie Imbruglia]]. During the live rounds, she sang "Les moulins de mon cœur" by [[Michel Legrand]] and was saved by public vote. On 27 April 2013 she performed "[[Call Me Maybe]]" by [[Carly Rae Jepsen]] and was saved by her mentor coach to go through. With Lennon's "Imagine" dedicated to her deceased father, she was saved yet again by public vote. But her luck ended in the semi-finals after her rendition of "Quelqu'un m'a dit" by Carla Bruni. She had a cumulative score of 74 while the other Team Bertignac semi-finalist Loïs had a composite score of 76. Accordingly, Louane was eliminated finishing 5th to 8th.

All semi-finalists and finalists, including Louane, took part in an after-season tour throughout France.
