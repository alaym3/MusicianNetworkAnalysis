'''Palar''' is a river of southern [[India]].

== Controversial dam ==
Andhra Pradesh Government is constructing an [[irrigation]] [[dam]] across Palar at Ganeshpuram, near [[Kuppam]], Andhra Pradesh which has caused agitation among the people of the five northern districts of Tamil Nadu, namely [[Vellore]], [[Kancheepuram]], [[Tiruvannamalai]], [[Thiruvallur]] and [[Chennai]] benefited by the river. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[J. Jayalalithaa|Jayalalitha]] voiced her opposition to this proposal and said "Palar is an inter-state river and was also one of the rivers mentioned in Schedule A annexed to the 1892 agreement<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cwc.gov.in/main/downloads/legal_instruments_3.pdf |title=1892 Agreement - pages 279 to 293 |access-date=19 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110160934/http://cwc.gov.in/main/downloads/legal_instruments_3.pdf |archive-date=10 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which is in force as per [[Interstate River Water Disputes Act]] 1956. As per a clause of the agreement, the upstream state should not build any new dam or any structure to obstruct, divert, or store waters of the rivers without the consent of the downstream state".<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/jan/06dam.htm TN against AP making dam on Palar river]</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/09/26/stories/2010092660370500.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001014333/http://www.hindu.com/2010/09/26/stories/2010092660370500.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date=1 October 2010| title=Ponnala defends dam across Palar | date=26 September 2010| work=[[The Hindu]]| access-date=21 May 2011}}</ref>

The average rainfall in entire Palar river basin is low. This river basin used to suffer from frequent droughts. There has been no full scale flow for the past 10 years. However, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have mitigated frequent recurrence of droughts by developing innumerable minor and medium irrigation tanks. This has improved the availability of water for surface as well as ground water irrigations. As per the wet land atlas of India.,<ref>[http://www.indiawaterportal.org/node/18315 Wet lands of India 2011]</ref> the manmade wet lands are covering extensive area (3% to 5%) in the districts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu covering Palar river basin. Whereas the Palar basin in Andhra Pradesh is not well covered by wet lands which implies that the river water usage in Andhra Pradesh is not up to the mark compared to Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In the year 1892 when the Palar waters agreement was made, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh were part of then Madras Presidency.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://hyderabad-india-online.com/2011/03/madras-presidence/|title=  Map of Madras Presidency in 1909|access-date=1 July 2016}}</ref> The 1892 agreement on Palar river water sharing is applicable between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh since the boundary line in Palar river basin between [[Madras Presidency]] and [[Mysore kingdom]] is now part of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh states.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

== Documentary ==
A [[Documentary film|documentary]] called ''En Peyar Palar'' produced by Social Action Movement and Water Rights Protection Group, [[Chengalpattu]] and released on 30 June 2008 chronicles the plight of the river from its origin in [[Karnataka]] till it joins [[Bay of Bengal]]. The 85-minute documentary delves into how activities such as sand [[quarrying]] and discharge of industrial effluents are sucking the life out of one of Tamil Nadu's prime sources of drinking water. It was directed by R.R. Srinivasan.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705231530/http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/03/stories/2008070353060500.htm A documentary charts the plight of Palar]</ref>

This river is so important for irrigation in the north and south Arcot districts of Tamil Nadu, but it flows a meager distance of {{convert|50|km|mi}} in Andhra Pradesh, where the Palar river had been seen dry for almost 20&nbsp;years. Palar has been home for mud robbery and other illegal activities.{{cn|date=July 2020}}
