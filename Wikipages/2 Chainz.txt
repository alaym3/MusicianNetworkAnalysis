The duo was signed to fellow Georgia-based rapper [[Ludacris]]' [[Disturbing tha Peace]] label, and are best known for their debut single "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]" (featuring [[Lil Wayne]]).

In February 2012, Epps signed a solo [[record deal]] with [[Def Jam Recordings]], an imprint of [[Universal Music Group]]. The following August, he released his debut studio album ''[[Based on a T.R.U. Story]]'' on August 14, 2012, to commercial success despite mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/based-on-a-tru-story/2-chainz/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Based on a T.R.U.

His second studio album ''[[B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time]]'' was released on September 11, 2013; supported by the lead single "[[Feds Watching]]" (featuring [[Pharrell Williams]]). Epps began working with TV network [[Viceland]] on a show called ''[[Most Expensivest]]'', which debuted on November 15, 2017, and aired for three seasons.

==Early life==
2 Chainz was born '''Tauheed Epps''' in [[College Park, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/2-chainz-might-run-for-mayor-of-college-park-georgia-2015281|title=2 Chainz Might Run for Mayor of College Park, Georgia: Rapper Gets Political|website=Us Weekly|first=Madeline|last=Boardman|date=January 28, 2015|access-date=November 8, 2016|archive-date=March 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329195052/https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/2-chainz-might-run-for-mayor-of-college-park-georgia-2015281/|url-status=live}}</ref> He attended [[North Clayton High School]], where he played basketball and graduated second in his class.<ref name=beast>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/27/2-chainz-is-no-donald-trump-fan.html|title=2 Chainz Is No Donald Trump Fan|website=The Daily Beast|first=Marlow|last=Stern|date=March 27, 2016|access-date=November 8, 2016|archive-date=May 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504193045/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/27/2-chainz-is-no-donald-trump-fan.html|url-status=live}}</ref> While in high school, he dealt [[marijuana]] and was arrested for felony [[cocaine]] possession when he was 15 years old.<ref name=beast/>

==College basketball career==
He later attended [[Alabama State University]] on a scholarship, and played on its basketball team from 1995 to 1997.<ref name=espn>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbooksounds/post/_/id/3120/how-good-was-2-chainz-at-basketball |website=espn.go.com |publisher=ESPN |title=How good was 2 Chainz at basketball? |access-date=December 10, 2012 |archive-date=November 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121035023/http://espn.go.com/blog/playbooksounds/post/_/id/3120/how-good-was-2-chainz-at-basketball |url-status=live }}</ref>

When asked by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' about longstanding rumors that he had graduated from Alabama State with a 4.0 GPA, which had been widely reported on many sources including [[Wikipedia]], 2 Chainz said: "Don't believe anything on Wack-ipedia. There's a lot of false stuff on there, to the point that every time I try to fix one thing, something else comes out."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-suddenly-2-chainz-is-everywhere-20120813 | title=Five Reasons Why 2 Chainz Should Make A Presidential Bid | work=The Observer | date=September 25, 2012 | access-date=January 10, 2016 | author=Vanessa Quilantan | archive-date=March 17, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317050103/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-suddenly-2-chainz-is-everywhere-20120813 | url-status=live }}</ref> In fact, he transferred to [[Virginia State University]] due to circumstances he was reluctant to speak about. "I got into some trouble, went somewhere else, and came back. But I graduated, and that's that. That was then," he said.<ref name=beast/>

==Musical career==

===1997–2010: Playaz Circle and Disturbing tha Peace===
Epps formed the hip hop duo [[Playaz Circle]] (the word "Playaz" being a [[bacronym]] for "Preparing Legal Assets for Years from A to Z")<ref name=dubmagazine>{{cite web|title=Playaz Circle|url=http://dubmagazine.com/stars/musicians/410-playaz-circle|work=Dub Magazine|publisher=Dub Publishing|access-date=May 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323231616/http://dubmagazine.com/stars/musicians/410-playaz-circle|archive-date=March 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> in [[College Park, Georgia]] in 1997, with his high school friend Earl Conyers (known as Dolla Boy), while Epps adopted "Tity Boi" as his [[moniker]].<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web|last=Cordor|first=Cyril|title=Playaz Circle – Biography|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/playaz-circle-p733429/biography|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|access-date=May 20, 2012|archive-date=December 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208024338/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/playaz-circle-mn0000548300|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the release of an [[Independent music|independent album]] titled ''United We Stand, United We Fall'' (2002),<ref name=dubmagazine/> the duo was introduced to fellow Atlanta rapper [[Ludacris]] when he moved into their College Park apartment complex while he was acting as a [[disc jockey|DJ]].<ref name=allmusicbio/> After taking interest in Playaz Circle, Ludacris began to record several songs with the group, playing some of them on his [[radio station]].<ref name=dubmagazine/>

Ludacris soon became one of the highest-selling rappers in the [[Southern United States]].<ref name=allmusicbio/> After hearing of their situation, Ludacris requested of Epps that the duo join his newly formed record label [[Disturbing Tha Peace]], a subsidiary of [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Epps agreed to sign, although Conyers did not officially join the label until his mother regained her health a year after the initial signing.<ref name=allmusicbio/>

The duo's debut album ''[[Supply & Demand (Playaz Circle album)|Supply & Demand]]'', was released on October 30, 2007. The [[lead single]] and the duo's debut single, "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]", became an urban [[hit single]]. The song features [[Lil Wayne]], and was performed by the duo at the [[BET Hip Hop Awards]]. The duo released its second studio album ''[[Flight 360: The Takeoff]]'', on September 29, 2009. In January 2010, Playaz Circle filmed a music video for the single "Big Dawg" [[featuring]] Lil Wayne and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] at Studio Space Atlanta. Shortly afterwards, Epps left Disturbing tha Peace, a move he claimed was taken in order to advance his career. Although Ludacris was initially reluctant to allow Epps to leave the label (as he felt Epps could still prove financially successful), he eventually accepted the decision.<ref name=albumtitle>{{cite web|last=Vasquez|first=Andres|title=2 Chainz Reveals Album Title, Speaks On Leaving Ludacris' Label|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.19019/title.2-chainz-reveals-album-title-speaks-on-leaving-ludacris-label|work=HipHopDX|publisher=Cheri Media Group|access-date=May 20, 2012|date=March 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426100207/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.19019/title.2-chainz-reveals-album-title-speaks-on-leaving-ludacris-label|archive-date=April 26, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{Main|Pretty Girls Like Trap Music|Rap or Go to the League}}
On January 27, 2016, Epps released an EP titled "Felt Like Cappin". It was released via online streaming sites and [[iTunes]]. The EP was promoted by the single "Back On That Bullshit" featuring [[Lil Wayne]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://listen.tidal.com/album/56705198 |title=TIDAL |website=Listen.tidal.com |access-date=May 7, 2016 |archive-date=May 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511131954/http://listen.tidal.com/album/56705198 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Epps began 2016 with the March release of a 12-record collaborative album with rapper Lil Wayne titled ''[[ColleGrove]]'', which was intended to be the debut album between 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne. However, Wayne's ongoing lawsuit with [[Cash Money Records]] prevented Wayne from being a primary artist on the album. Epps appears as the primary artist on the album with eight tracks featuring Lil Wayne. The album features prominent producers such as [[Honorable C.N.O.T.E.]], [[Mike Will Made It]], [[Zaytoven]], [[TM88]], [[Metro Boomin]], [[London on da Track]], and more. ''ColleGrove'' received decent reviews from critics and fans.

Epps continued his work in 2016 with the August 5 release of mixtape ''Daniel Son: Necklace Don'', a 9-track mixtape that Epps released independently. The mixtape originally featured [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[YFN Lucci]] on it, but Epps chose to move the song "Big Amount ft. Drake" to the 2017 studio album ''[[Pretty Girls Like Trap Music]]'' because of its mass appeal on the mixtape and star power performance. ''Daniel Son: Necklace Don'' received a 3-out-of-5-star review from [[XXL (magazine)|''XXL'']] magazine.

2016 was wrapped up by Epps's third mixtape, titled ''[[Hibachi for Lunch]]'', which was released October 28. The 7-track mixtape originally featured [[Quavo]], [[Gucci Mane]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], and [[Future (rapper)|Future]]. However, the song "Good Drank ft. [[Quavo]] and [[Gucci Mane]]" was moved to ''[[Pretty Girls Like Trap Music]]''. Notable production was done by [[Mike Will Made It]], K Swisha, and Buddah Bless.

In 2017, Epps released his fourth studio album titled ''[[Pretty Girls Like Trap Music]]'' on June 16 on [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album featured [[Travis Scott]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Swae Lee]], [[Migos]], [[Jhené Aiko|Jhene Aiko]], [[Pharrell Williams]], and more. Album production was done by [[Mike Will Made It]], Buddah Bless, [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], [[Murda Beatz]], and more. The album was supported by three official [[Single (music)|singles]]: "[[Good Drank]]", "[[It's a Vibe]]," and "[[4 AM (2 Chainz song)|4 AM]]". The album was also supported by a nationwide concert tour, as well as several [[Pop-up retail|pop-up shops]] in the US.<sup>[[Pretty Girls Like Trap Music#cite note-1|[1]]] [[Pretty Girls Like Trap Music#cite note-2|[2]]]</sup> 2 Chainz alluded to the album showing "growth and maturation." He stated the content would maintain its edginess while also elevating [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]] to a point where everyone could appreciate it. ''Pretty Girls Like Trap Music'' received widespread critical acclaim, with most critics citing the album as his best album yet.

On November 15, 2017, the first episode of ''[[Most Expensivest]]'' aired on the TV network [[Viceland]]. The show focused on 2 Chainz visiting different locations offering the "most expensivest" goods and services. Each show covers a particular theme, with shows ranging from personal health to extravagant indulgences. The show offered a unique insight into products and services that have been created with the explicit intent on being exclusive and expensive. 2 Chainz offered a unique and often humorous insight into the products, especially the ones that he personally found to be either amazing or ridiculous. The show was renewed for a 20-episode third season, which aired in early 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://premieredate.news/tv-series/4568-most-expensivest.html|title=Fans Can Enjoy Season 3 of Most Expensivest on Viceland in early 2019|website=premieredate.news|access-date=October 12, 2018|archive-date=October 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013014617/https://premieredate.news/tv-series/4568-most-expensivest.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Just before midnight on August 21, 2013, Epps' tour bus was pulled over in [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], because the passenger side taillights were out.  The arresting officer reported that he smelled [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and saw smoke through the open door of the bus after he had stopped and pulled over the bus. The driver of the bus shut the door and told officers he was not authorized to allow them on the bus. The officer said the [[marijuana]] smell gave him probable cause to search, but the driver refused to open the door. After many attempts to enter, the bus was towed with the men still aboard to the police training center in [[Oklahoma City]]. Officers obtained a search warrant and the 10 men, including Epps, got off the bus. Police discovered two semi-automatic pistols and a 12-gauge pump shotgun, along with some prescription painkillers and marijuana residue, on the tour bus according to papers filed [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma County]] district Court.<ref>{{cite web |author=MICHAEL MCNUTT mmcnutt@opubco.com • |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-city-police-found-weapons-painkillers-on-rappers-tour-bus-court-papers-show/article/3878935 |title=Oklahoma City police found weapons, painkillers on rapper's tour bus, court papers show |website=News OK |date=September 3, 2013 |access-date=October 26, 2013 |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205730/http://newsok.com/oklahoma-city-police-found-weapons-painkillers-on-rappers-tour-bus-court-papers-show/article/3878935 |url-status=live }}</ref>
