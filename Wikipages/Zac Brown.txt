==Early life==
Brown was raised on [[Lake Lanier]] by his mother, Bettye, and stepfather Dr. Jody Moses, a dentist in [[Cumming, Georgia]]. The eleventh of twelve children, Brown attended Mashburn Elementary School in Cumming; [[Lakeview Academy]] in [[Gainesville, Georgia]]; and [[South Forsyth High School]] in Cumming. He later moved to [[Dahlonega, Georgia]], at age 17, where he graduated from [[Lumpkin County High School]]. Brown was given his mother's guitar at age 8, and one of his stepfather's patients was enlisted to teach him classical guitar. He completed two years of lessons, but soon after developed a love for [[bluegrass music]] while playing with his father and brother on weekend visits. In his mid-teens, Brown spent almost a year being tutored by a vocal coach from his church in Cumming.

While still in high school, with [[James Taylor]] as his inspiration, Brown began playing solo gigs in local venues, performing country and pop [[cover version|cover]] songs. Brown attended the [[University of West Georgia]], where he became a member of the Zeta Kappa chapter of the [[Kappa Alpha Order]] fraternity. He was also a camp counselor at Camp Mikell in [[Toccoa, Georgia]], and Camp Glisson, a United Methodist summer camp and retreat center located in Dahlonega.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Alumni News| journal = The Kappa Alpha Order Journal| date = Summer 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ben-Yehuda|first=Ayala|title=Music: Happening Now - Zac Attack|journal=Billboard |date=Oct 25, 2008|volume=120|issue=43|page=36|id={{ProQuest|1020474}}}}</ref> Brown later founded Camp Southern Ground, a 501c3 non-profit camp in [[Fayetteville, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.littlekidsrock.org/friends/our-big-fans/zac-brown-band/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115014556/http://www.littlekidsrock.org/friends/our-big-fans/zac-brown-band/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 15, 2014|title=Zac Brown Band &#124; Little Kids Rock|date=January 15, 2014}}</ref>
