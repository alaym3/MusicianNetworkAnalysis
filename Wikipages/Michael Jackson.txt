'''Michael Joseph Jackson''' (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter and dancer.<!--DO NOT add more occupations per [[Talk:Michael Jackson/Archive 31#Lead sentence format]]--> Dubbed the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Pop]]", he is regarded as [[Cultural impact of Michael Jackson|one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century]]. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in [[popular culture]]. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the [[Moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]], to which he gave the name, as well as the [[Robot (dance)|robot]]. He is the [[List of awards and nominations received by Michael Jackson|most awarded music artist]] in history.

The eighth child of the [[Jackson family]], Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]] and [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] as a member of [[the Jackson 5]] (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at [[Motown|Motown Records]]. He became a solo star with his 1979 album ''[[Off the Wall]]''. His music videos, including those for "[[Beat It]]", "[[Billie Jean]]" and "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]" from his 1982 album ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'', are credited with breaking [[Anti-black racism in the United States|racial barriers]] and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of [[MTV]] and continued to innovate with videos for the albums ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' (1987), ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' (1991) and ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]'' (1995). ''Thriller'' became the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]], while ''Bad'' was the first album to produce five U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles.{{refn|group=nb|"[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]", "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", "[[Man in the Mirror]]" and "[[Dirty Diana]]".}}

From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his [[Health and appearance of Michael Jackson|changing appearance]], [[Personal relationships of Michael Jackson|relationships]], behavior and lifestyle. In 1993, he was [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|accused of sexually abusing the child]] of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was [[Trial of Michael Jackson|tried and acquitted]] of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. In both cases, the [[FBI files on Michael Jackson|FBI]] found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf in either case. In 2009, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, [[This Is It (concert residency)|This Is It]], Jackson [[Death of Michael Jackson|died]] from an overdose of [[propofol]] administered by his personal physician, [[Conrad Murray]], who was [[California v.

In his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview, Jackson said he had had two [[rhinoplasty]] surgeries and a [[cleft chin]] surgery but no more than that.

In 1984, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' pop critic [[Jay Cocks]] wrote that "Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever." He described Jackson as a "star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business.

Pop critic [[Robert Christgau]] wrote that Jackson's work from the 1970s to the early 1990s showed "immense originality, adaptability, and ambition" with "genius beats, hooks, arrangements, and vocals (though not lyrics)", music that "will stand forever as a reproach to the puritanical notion that pop music is slick or shallow and that's the end of it". During the 1990s, as Jackson lost control of his "troubling life", his music suffered and began to shape "an arc not merely of promise fulfilled and outlived, but of something approaching tragedy: a phenomenally ebullient child star tops himself like none before, only to transmute audibly into a lost weirdo".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Robert |last= Christgau |author-link= Robert Christgau |title= Michael Jackson: 'The Ultimate Collection' |magazine= [[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |date= December 2004 |access-date= March 12, 2019 |url= http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cdrev/jackson,m-ble.php}}</ref> In the 2000s, Christgau wrote: "Jackson's obsession with fame, his grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth, are such an offense to rock aesthetes that the fact that he's a great musician is now often forgotten".<ref>{{cite news|first= Robert |last= Christgau |title= Consumer Guide: Popstakes |newspaper= [[The Village Voice]] |date= January 15, 2002 |access-date= March 12, 2019 |url= https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv102-02.php}}</ref>

===Vocal style===
Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy [[soprano]] to high [[tenor]].{{sfn|Brackett|Hoard|2004|p=414}} He was known for his vocal range.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= 100 Greatest Singers of All Time |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= December 3, 2010 |access-date= April 14, 2019 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-147019/michael-jackson-18-223970/}}</ref> With the arrival of ''Off the Wall'' in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; ''Rolling Stone'' compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that "Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling [[falsetto]] that's used very daringly."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Stephen |last= Holden |author-link= Stephen Holden |title= Michael Jackson: Off The Wall |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= November 1, 1979 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/off-the-wall-19791101}}</ref> By the time of 1982's ''Thriller'', ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that Jackson was singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by sadness".<ref name="Thriller"/>

The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album ''Dangerous''. ''The New York Times'' noted that on some tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone".

I'll take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and that's what inspires the melody."

With ''Off the Wall'', Jackson's "vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides" vividly showed his maturation into an adult, [[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "oddball" music personas: "Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed."{{sfn|Christgau|1981|loc=Consumer Guide '70s: J}} With ''Thriller'', Christopher Connelly of ''Rolling Stone'' commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of [[paranoia]] and darker imagery.<ref name="Thriller"/> AllMusic's [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted this on the songs "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'".<ref name="AMThriller"/> In "Billie Jean", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child,<ref name="allmusic"/> and in "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" he argues against gossip and the media.<ref name="Thriller"/> "Beat It" decried gang violence in a homage to ''[[West Side Story]]'', and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="Bio"/> He observed that "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the [[supernatural]], a topic he revisited in subsequent years.
