'''Anti-Flag ''' is an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], United States. The band is well known for its [[left-wing]] political activism. The lineup includes singer/guitarist [[Justin Sane]] and drummer Pat Thetic, who founded the band together; later members are guitarist Chris Head, and singer/bassist Chris Barker (#2) who replaced Jamie "Cock" Towns, who had replaced original bassist Andy Flag in 1997 following his departure one year prior. Anti-Flag is known also for their advocacy of progressive political action groups such as [[Greenpeace]] and [[Amnesty International]], and the [[Occupy movement]].

==History==
===Early years (1988, 1992–1996)===
Anti-Flag was formed in 1988 by singer/guitarist Justin Sane and drummer Pat Thetic. During the band's early years, various guitarists and bassists moved in and out of the band, including Justin's sister, Lucy Fester formerly of Chicago band Toothpaste. The band failed to solidify, falling apart after playing just one show.<ref name="band history">{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-flag.com/AB10.php|title=Band History|website=Anti Flag|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429181121/http://www.anti-flag.com/AB10.php|archive-date=April 29, 2011}}</ref>
In 1992, Justin and Pat re-formed the band with Andy Flag on bass. A 17-song demo album called ''17 Songs'' was released the same year.

===First three albums (1996–1999)===
In 1996, the band released their first album, ''[[Die For the Government]]'', on [[New Red Archives]]. Andy Flag left the band in mid-1996 because of personal disputes between himself and Justin. For a brief time after Andy's departure in 1996, Sean Whelan of Pittsburgh band the Bad Genes filled in on bass. It was during this time that Sean was also playing in another band (57 Defective) with guitarist Chris Head, whom he introduced to the band.

In early 1997, Pittsburgh guitarist Chris Head began filling in on bass. In late 1997, Jamie Cock took over as the new bassist, moving Chris Head over to second guitar, which he preferred. The current lineup finalized in 1999 when Chris Barker, also known as Chris No. 2, replaced Jamie Cock on bass.

In 1998, the band released their second full-length release, ''[[Their System Doesn't Work for You]]''. The album contained all nine Anti-Flag songs from the 1996 Anti-Flag/[[d.b.s.]] split album ''North America Sucks'', as well as 10 new unreleased songs. The band decided to release the album independently, and ''Their System Doesn't Work for You'' became the debut release for the band's own [[A-F Records]].

In 1999, Anti-Flag released the album ''[[A New Kind of Army]]'' on [[Go-Kart Records]]/[[A-F Records]]. The album addressed topics such as abortion, [[political corruption]], [[racism]], [[fascism]], troubled youth, police brutality, and unity within the American youth. The cover art page unfolded into a poster featuring the phrase "Too smart to fight. Too smart to kill. Join now. A new kind of army." In addition to this, the band had a disclaimer at the bottom of its album cover saying,"Anti-Flag does not mean Anti-American. Anti-Flag means anti-war. Anti-Flag means unity."

===Fat Wreck Chords (2000–2004)===
In 2000, Anti-Flag was invited to participate in [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]]. During this time, the members of Anti-Flag met [[NOFX]]'s [[Fat Mike]], owner of the [[Fat Wreck Chords]] record label. This meeting spawned a friendship that would lead to Anti-Flag's release of two albums on the label.

[[File:Justin Sane 01.jpg|thumb|[[Frontman]] [[Justin Sane]] at [[Warped Tour 2006]]]]
In 2001, Anti-Flag teamed with punk music producer [[Mass Giorgini]] to record the album ''[[Underground Network]]'', released on [[Fat Wreck Chords]]. The release of the album is arguably the band's breakout from the hardcore underground to a more mainstream spotlight. The album continued to address the issues of [[fascism]] (specifically neo-Nazis infiltrating the "hardcore scene") and the United States' foreign policy. The album was the first to contain the now-commonplace booklet filled with essays from historians and political commentators, most notably Professor [[Howard Zinn]].

In February 2002, Anti-Flag released the album ''[[Mobilize (Anti-Flag album)|Mobilize]]'' on [[A-F Records]]. The album featured eight new studio tracks as well as eight live tracks of songs from other albums. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, Anti-Flag spoke out against the push for war with the album's title track "911 for peace". During this time, many music stores pulled Anti-Flag's records from shelves, as their music was labeled as "anti-American."<ref name="no usa">{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/afpunkrock/|title=Anti-Flag Fan Page|website=Alternative Communication|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719034513/http://membres.multimania.fr/afpunkrock/|archive-date=July 19, 2013}}</ref>
In 2003, Anti-Flag released the album ''[[The Terror State]]'' on [[Fat Wreck Chords]]. The album primarily focused on criticizing the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration's handling of the [[War on Terrorism]]. Again, the album contained a booklet full of essays from the band as well as other political commentators. The album contains a song whose lyrics were originally written by [[Woody Guthrie]] entitled "Post-War Breakout." The track's music was arranged by the members of Anti-Flag, as Guthrie had never committed the arrangements to paper.

On October 8, 2004, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Jim McDermott]] gave a speech in the House of Representatives, praising Anti-Flag for their work in encouraging young people to register and vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/mcdermott/sp041008a.shtml|title=Voting Is Going To be the in Thing in 2004|last=McDermott|first=Jim|date=October 8, 2004|website=Congressman Jim McDermott|publisher=United States House of Representatives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310105404/http://www.house.gov/mcdermott/sp041008a.shtml|archive-date=March 10, 2010}}</ref>

===RCA (2005–2009)===
In 2005, Anti-Flag signed a two-album record contract with [[List of record labels|major label]] [[RCA]]. In an interview with British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', Justin Sane explained the band's move to a major label:

{{quote|We've been approached by the major labels over the past seven or eight years but we thought we were having an impact where we were. They were never willing to give us complete control. This time they were willing to give us complete control over what we record, the artwork, who we tour with. We won't be censored. If there was ever a time to take a chance to be heard on a mass scale then this is the time. I feel like we've been a voice in the wilderness for too long.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/29/arts.politics|title=Anti-Flag to incite May Day masses|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=2006-04-29|website=The Guardian|access-date=2015-05-20}}</ref>}}

The first of these two albums, ''[[For Blood and Empire]]'', was released on March 21, 2006. The album's main focus is the band's criticism of the mishandling of the [[War on Terrorism]] by the United States Government. The album's lead single, "This Is The End (For You My Friend)" is featured in the video game [[Madden NFL 07]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/714/714060p1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703074144/http://music.ign.com/articles/714/714060p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 3, 2006 |title=Madden NFL 07 Soundtrack - Music News at IGN |publisher=Music.ign.com |access-date=August 17, 2012 }}</ref> and on [[NHL 07]], and strays from the theme of war and back towards troubled youth. They finished their "War Sucks, Let's Party" United States headlining tour in April and work on some side projects like [[African Well Fund]] and Start to Finish MS now.

Throughout Anti-Flag's career, many other bands have been added to the roster of the band's own label, [[A-F Records]]. These bands include [[The Code (band)|The Code]], [[Pipedown]], [[Much the Same]], The Vacancy, [[The Unseen (band)|The Unseen]], [[Modey Lemon]], Thought Riot, Tabula Rasa, and more.

On November 25, Anti-Flag revealed on their homepage that their newest album was titled ''[[The Bright Lights of America]]''. Produced by [[Tony Visconti]] (of [[David Bowie]], [[T. Rex (band)]] and [[Morrissey]] fame), it was released on April 1, 2008. The album's title single was released exclusively on iTunes on February 12, 2008. A video of the song was released some weeks later.

In 2008, on tour with Canadian band [[Billy Talent]] in Europe, [[Justin Sane]] and [[Chris Barker (bassist)|Chris#2]] joined [[Billy Talent]] singer [[Ben Kowalewicz]] and guitarist [[Ian D'Sa]], singing their new song "[[Turn Your Back]]" from their upcoming unreleased album. The two also play on the single version of the song.

In March 2009, Anti-Flag were forced to cancel a series of tour dates after Justin Sane broke his collarbone landing awkwardly whilst jumping off the stage at the UEA LCR in Norwich to stop a fan of another act throwing objects at the band.<ref name="Singer breaks collarbone in stage dive, Norwich Evening News, 7/3/09">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=News&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED06%20Mar%202009%2015%3A28%3A16%3A923|title=Evening News 24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602132943/http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=News&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=news&itemid=NOED06%20Mar%202009%2015%3A28%3A16%3A923|access-date=September 8, 2020|archive-date=June 2, 2009}}</ref>

===SideOneDummy (2009–2014)===
Beginning on September 30, 2008, [[Chris Barker (bassist)|Chris#2]] began to post on his blog, that the band had begun to work on their seventh studio album. On December 2, Anti-Flag began to record their record, starting with "The Economy is Suffering... Let It Die".

On March 31, 2009, Anti-Flag announced that their next CD, ''[[The People or the Gun]]'', would be released on [[SideOneDummy]] on June 9, 2009. The band recorded the album in a home studio they built themselves.  On Anti-Flag.com, the first track of the album "Sodom, Gomorrah, and Washington DC (Sheep in Shepherd's Clothing)" can be listened to. On May 1, 2009, the band performed a full set of [[The Clash]] covers at Hoodwink in East Rutherford, New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/05/11/hoodwink-east-rutherford-51/ |title = inTuneMusic Online: Hoodwink @ East Rutherford 5/1 |access-date = May 11, 2009 |author = Ambrose, Anthony |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090514134319/http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/05/11/hoodwink-east-rutherford-51/ |archive-date = May 14, 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

In September 2009, Anti-Flag was slated to play a show during a G-20 protest that was taking place in their home town of Pittsburgh, but the promoter canceled the show due to severe parking restrictions and police presence in the immediate vicinity of the venue. However the band continued to personally take part in the protests.

In November 2009, Anti-Flag showed their support to the protesting students in Vienna. They gave a speech at the main building of the Vienna University that the students had taken over and also had one of the student representatives speak at their two shows in Vienna.

In January 2010, Anti-Flag completed a full US tour supported by [[Aiden]] and [[Cancer Bats]] with various bands filling another supporting slot and local bands opening as many of the shows as possible. The tour was sponsored by Amnesty International, Peta 2, Greenpeace and Innes Clothing (who supported a clothing drive for local homeless and youth shelters). The band followed the US tour, with an Australian tour, playing the [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave Festival]] dates in February 2010, with bands such as [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Paramore]], [[Escape the Fate]], [[A Day to Remember]], [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] and more, as well as playing two headlining dates supported by [[Alexisonfire]] and [[Comeback Kid (band)|Comeback Kid]].

Throughout mid-2010, the band playing various festivals such as [[Ruisrock]] and [[Woodstock en Beauce]], as well as playing the few last dates of the [[Warped Tour 2010|Vans Warped Tour]] in August. September 2010 saw the band headlining a Canadian tour with support from [[the Menzingers]], which was followed by the European Vans Off the Wall Music Tour in October, with supporting acts [[The Swellers]] and [[Pulled Apart by Horses]].

The band made their live comeback in March 2011, while headlining a [[South American]] tour with [[This Is a Standoff]], and then supporting [[My Chemical Romance]] on two dates in the US in April. In May–June 2011, the band returned to Europe to play the [[Slam Dunk Festival]] dates, as well as supporting [[System of a Down]] on June 2 in [[Milan, Italy]].

On June 21, 2011, front-man [[Justin Sane]] announced that Anti-Flag is working on material for a new album, which they hoped would be to released later in the year, with working title of ''Magnum''. Sane has also announced plans to record a new solo album in the coming future, as he's been working on some [[folk music|folk]]-oriented solo material as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blaremagazine.com/2011/06/16/interview-anti-flag/ |title=INTERVIEW: Anti-Flag (NXNE 2011) « |publisher=Blaremagazine.com |date=June 16, 2011 |access-date=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

=== ''20/20 Vision'' (2019–present) ===
On October 7, 2019, the band released their song "Christian Nationalist", alongside the announcement of a European tour the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/anti-flag-christian-nationalist/|title=Listen To Anti-Flag's New Single, Christian Nationalist|last=Peacock|first=Tim|date=October 7, 2019|website=uDiscover Music|language=en-US|access-date=November 14, 2019}}</ref> On the band's website, the song's meaning was explained by a quote from Justin:{{quote|History is full of wealthy and powerful people using religion and cultism to justify policies of oppression and inequality. Invariably, these policies target the most vulnerable in society so that elites can maintain their dominance. Today we see this same strategy employed by right wing politicians all over the world. Just as the anti-fascists of the 1930s and 1940s rejected the fascist ideologies of their era, we reject the neo-fascists of this era. Theocracy is dangerous and inherently anti-democratic because it restricts individual choice and provides an avenue by which politicians can claim a moral superiority over "the other". It gives political cover and justification for policies and actions which might otherwise be deemed morally objectionable, inhuman, or adverse to the best interest of the country.|sign=|source=}}The website also provided a list of [[GOP|Republican]] politicians, along with sources indicating that said politicians had accepted large amounts of donations from the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] and gun lobbyists for their support of many of the concepts that are explained in the quote, along with a list of mass shooting incidents.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20191008055929/http://anti-flag.com/christiannationalist/] </ref>

Later that month, the band announced their twelfth studio album, ''20/20 Vision'', alongside the release of the song "Hate Conquers All" and the song's music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/anti-flag-album-20-20-vision/|title=Anti-Flag Announce New Album 20/20 Vision For January 2020|last=Peacock|first=Tim|date=October 29, 2019|website=Udiscovermusic.com Music|language=en-US|access-date=November 14, 2019}}</ref>

==Name and criticism==
Anti-Flag explained their name on the artwork for their 1999 release, ''[[A New Kind of Army]]'', saying "Anti-Flag does not mean Anti-American. Anti-Flag means anti-war. Anti-Flag means the common people of the world are better off living in unity and peace. Anti-Flag means to stand against corporate greed that hurts millions while benefiting a handful of extremely rich. Anti-Flag means to fight against mindless nationalism.
