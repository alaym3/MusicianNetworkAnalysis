===Controversy on director appointments===
MHRD issued a letter in September 2014 (DO 4/4/2013-TS.V)) addressed to Jamshed J Irani,<ref>{{cite news |title=Everonn Education Chairman Irani resigns; new CEO appointed |date=2 September 2011 |newspaper=The Economic Times |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-09-02/news/30105705_1_ceo-business-council-bribery-case |access-date=10 October 2014 |archive-date=26 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026130214/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-09-02/news/30105705_1_ceo-business-council-bribery-case |url-status=live }}</ref> chairman, board of governors, IIM-L. It reads: "Competent authority have directed to assign additional charge of director IIM-L to Prof Srivastava for a period of six months with effect from 09-09-2014 or till appointment of regular director or until further order, whichever is earliest."

The institute did not execute the order and incumbent director Devi Singh who completed his six months of extension period, on 8 September did not leave office even after receiving the letter. As a result, there was confusion at IIM-L campus for almost a week.<ref>{{cite news |author=Rajeev Mullick |title=Confusion after IIM-L brass sleep on MHRD order |date=12 September 2014 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |url=http://paper.hindustantimes.com/epaper/iphone/homepage.aspx#_article96f787e0-e048-4186-b5e9-796bbbec6f22/waarticle96f787e0-e048-4186-b5e9-796bbbec6f22/96f787e0-e048-4186-b5e9-796bbbec6f22//true |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608164900/http://paper.hindustantimes.com/epaper/iphone/homepage.aspx#_article96f787e0-e048-4186-b5e9-796bbbec6f22/waarticle96f787e0-e048-4186-b5e9-796bbbec6f22/96f787e0-e048-4186-b5e9-796bbbec6f22//true |archive-date=8 June 2017|access-date=12 September 2014 }}</ref> The allegations against Devi Singh, who served two term as director of IIM-L, ranges from nepotism to mismanagement of accounts. The Central Vigilance Commission also asked the HRD ministry to 're investigate' allegations of corruption against Devi Singh.

In a letter to the higher education secretary, CVC secretary KS Ramasubban has asked the ministry as to why the case against Singh is being closed when specific allegations have not been answered. The CVC has taken exception to the fact that the case is being closed on the basis of an "emotional reply" by Singh. CVC sources said the ministry had taken Singh's reply as final. "Without investigation how can general comments be taken as the final word?" a CVC official asked. CVC sources also said that the institute's Board of Governors had rejected allegations against Singh. "This is not how an investigation is conducted," the CVC official said, adding that the HRD ministry was to be blamed for not following the procedure.<ref>{{cite news |title=CVC wants HRD to 'reinvestigate' charges against IIM-L director |author=Akshaya Mukul |date=4 March 2010 |newspaper=The Times of India |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/CVC-wants-HRD-to-reinvestigate-charges-against-IIM-L-director/articleshow/5638148.cms |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112212109/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/CVC-wants-HRD-to-reinvestigate-charges-against-IIM-L-director/articleshow/5638148.cms |archive-date=12 November 2015}}</ref>
