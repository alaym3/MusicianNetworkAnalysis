'''Devin Garrett Townsend''' (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. He founded [[extreme metal]] band [[Strapping Young Lad]] and was its primary songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist from 1994 to 2007. He has also had an extensive solo career and has released a total of 25 albums across all of his projects as of 2020.

After performing in a number of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands in high school, Townsend was discovered in 1993 by a record label who asked him to perform lead vocals on [[Steve Vai]]'s album ''[[Sex & Religion]]''. After recording and touring with Vai, he was discouraged by what he found in the music industry and vented his anger on his 1995 solo album ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]'', which he released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band of the same name, with whom he released the critically acclaimed album ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]'' in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent HevyDevy Records label.

Townsend's solo albums have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians and are a mix of [[hard rock]], [[progressive metal]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[New-age music|new-age]]. In 2002, he formed the Devin Townsend Band, which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases. In 2007, he disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began recording again and soon announced the formation of the Devin Townsend Project. This band began with a series of four albums, released from 2009 to 2011 and each written in a different genre. Townsend continued to record and tour under the new moniker until January 2018.

Across all his bands and solo projects, Townsend has released 23 studio albums and four live albums. His trademark production style, featuring a heavily multi-tracked [[wall of sound]], has been compared to the styles of [[Robert Fripp]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. His vocal delivery ranges from [[Screaming (music)|screaming]] to an opera-esque singing, while his musical style is rooted in metal and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality.

Townsend recorded a Noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels. [[Relativity Records]] responded to Townsend with a record deal and Townsend began work on what was to be the first Noisescapes album, ''Promise''.<ref name="diperna-199309" /> Shortly afterward, the label introduced him to musician [[Steve Vai]]. Impressed with Townsend's vocal work, Vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album ''[[Sex & Religion]]''. After recording ''Sex & Religion'', Townsend accompanied Vai on a world tour in support of the album.<ref name="diperna-199309">{{cite journal |title=Shrieking Havoc |last=Diperna |first=Alex |date=September 1993 |journal=[[Guitar World]] |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=South San Francisco, California |issn=1045-6295 |oclc=7982091}}</ref> Townsend soon landed a second tour, this time with the opening band of Vai's tour, [[the Wildhearts]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Alex S. |date=January–February 2005 |title=Devin Townsend interrogated |journal=[[Zero Tolerance Magazine]] |issue=3 |publisher=Obdurate Ltd |issn=1742-9897 |oclc=266995054}}</ref> He played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in Europe, and appeared as a guest musician on their single [[Urge (Wildhearts)|Urge]].

While on tour with the Wildhearts, Townsend formed a short-lived [[thrash metal]] project with [[Metallica]]'s then-bassist [[Jason Newsted]]. The band, known as IR8, featured Newsted on vocals and bass, Townsend on guitar, and [[Tom Hunting]] of [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] on drums. The group recorded a few songs together, although Townsend says that they never intended to go further than that. "People heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a CD, which is absolutely not true," he explains. "People took this project way too seriously."<ref name="hard-rock-interview-1995" /> A demo tape was put together, but the material was not released until 2002, when Newsted published the IR8 vs. Sexoturica compilation.

Though Townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. "I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality," he later reflected. "This combination was appalling."<ref name="lageat-2001">

Despite touring with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music.<ref name="chronicles-interview-1995">{{cite web|title=Bracing for Success – CoC interviews Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad|publisher=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]|author=Bromley, Adrian|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-7_strapping_young_lad.aspx|access-date=January 31, 2008|date=January 10, 1995|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216062732/http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-7_strapping_young_lad.aspx|archive-date=December 16, 2007}}</ref> "I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve," he mused.<ref name="hard-rock-interview-1995" /> While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from [[Monte Conner]], then-[[A&R]] representative for [[Roadrunner Records]], expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him.

===''Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing'' through ''Infinity'' (1994–1998)===
In 1994, Century Media Records offered Townsend a contract to make "some extreme albums".<ref name="Devin Townsend interviewed by Tony on 3RRR FM, Melbourne" /> He agreed to a five-album deal with the record label,<ref>{{cite news|title=Devin Townsend: 'I Don't Have Anything To Say With Strapping Young Lad Anymore'|work=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54611|access-date=January 31, 2008|date=July 4, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202060936/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54611|archive-date=December 2, 2008}}</ref> and also provided much of the guitar work on the 1994 album ''[[Millennium (Front Line Assembly album)|Millennium]]'' and the 1995 album ''[[Hard Wired]]'' by Vancouver industrial band [[Front Line Assembly]]. Townsend began to record material under the pseudonym [[Strapping Young Lad]]. He avoided using his real name at this point in career, looking for a fresh start after his high-profile Vai gig. "At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn't the best publicity to have," he later explained. "I was playing somebody else's music and I was judged in respect to that music."<ref name="lageat-2001" /> Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]'', which was released in April 1995.

Following the release of the record, Townsend and several other musician friends he knew in Vancouver recorded a [[rock opera]] in 1996 entitled ''[[Punky Brüster – Cooked on Phonics]]''. Written and recorded in under a month, the album tells the fictional story of a [[death metal]] band from [[Poland]] that sells out becoming a [[punk rock]] band to achieve mainstream success. Townsend founded his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records, to release the album.

Townsend assembled a permanent lineup of Strapping Young Lad to record ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]'', including prolific metal drummer [[Gene Hoglan]], along with Townsend's former bandmates [[Jed Simon]] on guitar and [[Byron Stroud]] on bass. The [[industrial music|industrial]]-influenced<ref name="popoff-2003">{{cite journal |last=Popoff |first=Martin |date=Winter–Spring 2003 |title=Strapping Young Lad |journal=Lollipop Magazine |issue=61 |oclc=36854274}}</ref> album was released in 1997.

The album featured a mix of [[hard rock]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[progressive rock]].<ref name="maniacs-200309" />
Dating back to the ''Sex and Religion'' tour, Townsend had been writing solo material for a project called Ocean Machine. The album, initially entitled ''Biomech'', was recorded in 1995 and originally queued for release later that year in December on [[HevyDevy Records]], a label created by Townsend solely for material he releases on his own. Due to unknown reasons, ''Ocean Machine: Biomech'' was put off for release until late 1996, but when the time came to finally release it Townsend had become unsatisfied with the recordings, rerecorded the entire album, and finally released in Japan on July 21, 1997.

During this period, Townsend was also asked to audition for the lead vocalist spot in [[Judas Priest]] after [[Rob Halford]]'s departure. Though a fan of the band, he turned down the offer, explaining that: "No one would want to see Devin Townsend singing for Judas Priest. I mean, it's ridiculous."<ref>{{cite web |last1=(3RRR FM Melbourne) |first1=Tony |title=INTERVIEW WITH DEVIN TOWNSEND with Tony |url=http://www.axs.com.au/~vk3aaw/devhard1.htm |website=www.axs.com.au |publisher=Wayback Machine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213192716/http://www.axs.com.au/~vk3aaw/devhard1.htm |access-date=20 July 2021|archive-date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>

After the completion of ''City'' and ''Ocean Machine: Biomech'', Townsend began to approach a mental breakdown. He explained, "I started to see human beings as little lonesome, water based, pink meat life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand." In December 1997, he checked himself into a mental-health hospital, where he was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from; he felt his disorder "gave birth to the two extremes that are Strapping's ''City'' record and ''Ocean Machine: Biomech''."<ref>{{cite web |title=HevyDevy News for 1998 |url=http://members.home.net/hevydevy/news.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206124933/http://members.home.net/hevydevy/news.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 6, 1998 |website=members.home.net/hevydevy |access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref><ref name="fbm-interview">{{cite web| url=http://www.farbeyondmetal.com/index.php?page_id=1120  |title=Metal Hammer Interviews Devin |publisher=Far Beyond Metal |author=Ingham, Chris |year=1998 |access-date=November 21, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070522103216/http://www.farbeyondmetal.com/index.php?page_id=1120 |archive-date = May 22, 2007}}</ref> After being discharged from the hospital, Townsend found that "everything just clicked" and he was able to write his third solo album, ''[[Infinity (Devin Townsend album)|Infinity]]'', which he described as "the parent project" of ''City'' and ''Ocean Machine: Biomech'',<ref name="fbm-interview" /> with music influenced by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name="maniacs-200309" /> Townsend returned to the studio, accompanied by Hoglan, to work on the album, on which Townsend played most of the instruments. ''Infinity'' was released in October 1998. Later in his career, Townsend has cited ''Infinity'' as his favorite solo record.<ref name="popoff-2003">{{cite journal |last=Popoff |first=Martin |date=Winter–Spring 2003 |title=Strapping Young Lad |journal=Lollipop Magazine |issue=61 |oclc=36854274}}</ref>

With ''Infinity'', Townsend began to label all albums outside of Strapping Young Lad under his own name, dropping the Ocean Machine moniker, to reduce confusion. He wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects, they are all simply aspects of his identity.<ref name="lageat-2001">

Townsend's bandmates began to play two sets at their shows, one as Strapping Young Lad, and one as the Devin Townsend Band, playing songs from Townsend's solo albums.<ref name="hdr-biography" />

Townsend's next project took several years to come to fruition. After the creation of the IR8 demo tape, Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called ''Fizzicist'', which they described as "heavier than Strapping Young Lad". When the IR8 tape was leaked, Newsted's Metallica bandmates [[James Hetfield]] and [[Lars Ulrich]] learned of the project.

Feeling he had "ostracized a bunch of fans" with ''Physicist'', Townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record.<ref name="popoff-2003" /> Townsend was inspired one morning while driving across Canada with his band, and looked to write an "introspective" album dedicated to his homeland.<ref name="small-200111">{{cite journal |last=Small |first=Aaron |date=November 2001 |title=Devin Townsend: Diary of a Madman |journal=[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles]] |location=Toronto |issn=1705-3781 |oclc=57191652}}</ref> He produced and recorded ''[[Terria (Devin Townsend album)|Terria]]'', a "highly illustrated stream-of-consciousness" album,<ref name="popoff-2003" /> with Gene Hoglan on drums, Craig McFarland on bass and Jamie Meyer on keyboards.

Townsend's solo run lasted until 2002. After a five-year break from recording, Strapping Young Lad reunited to record a new album.

=== ''Order of Magnitude'' and upcoming projects (2020–present) ===

In April 2020, Townsend began uploading a chronological series of podcasts on his official [[YouTube]] channel, with each episode discussing one or two of the albums in his discography. These podcasts have been monologue discussions and reflections on the albums themselves, the influences, the personnel, and the state of Townsend's life during the times these albums were being written and recorded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8KIhclVaK0Des9uMrJlt1w|title=Devin Townsend official YouTube channel|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=September 11, 2020}}</ref>

In August 2020, Townsend announced the upcoming release of ''Empath Live Volume 1: Order of Magnitude'', a live concert recorded during the first Empath Tour, and ''Empath Live Volume 2: By Request'', a virtual concert for fans in lieu of the second tour, which was canceled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicplayers.com/2020/08/devin-townsend-announces-order-of-magnitude-empath-live-volume-1-will-stream-empath-live-volume-2-by-request-set-online/|title=Devin Townsend Announces "Order of Magnitude"|website=www.musicplayers.com|date=August 17, 2020}}</ref> On September 5, he hosted a streaming premiere of ''Empath Live Volume 2'', a prerecorded virtual show featuring Samus Paulicelli on drums, Wes Hauch on guitar, [[Liam Wilson]] on bass, and Townsend on guitar and vocals.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=July 24, 2020|title=DEVIN TOWNSEND Announces 'Revolutionary' Virtual Concert 'Empath Volume 2: By Request'|url=https://blabbermouth.herokuapp.com/news/devin-townsend-announces-revolutionary-virtual-concert-empath-volume-2-by-request/|access-date=November 22, 2020|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> Each of them performed separately in front of green screens, with eight different camera setups each, to enhance the virtual concert experience.<ref name=":0" /> During the stream, Townsend took questions from the virtual audience and indicated that since the concert had been shot and mastered in [[4K resolution|4K]], he would be open to the possibility of eventually releasing the show on [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Devin Townsend - Almost Again - Empath Live Vol 2 2020|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6jf4y8ikTQ&t=224| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/e6jf4y8ikTQ| archive-date=2021-11-17|url-status=live}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Townsend's next project will be a double release including the albums ''The Puzzle'' and ''Snuggles''.

{{BLP sources section|date=November 2020}}
Townsend played [[ESP Guitars|ESP]] six and [[seven-string guitar]]s from 1994 to 2009 during his endorsement with ESP. In the early days of [[Strapping Young Lad]], he was seen playing an ESP [[Flying V]]-style 6-string with a single [[EMG 81]] pickup and a custom graphic designed by Townsend. This was the guitar that was used during the shows in support of [[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]], and the shows in support of City. In addition to this guitar, Townsend also utilized an ESP EXP [[Gibson Explorer|Explorer]]-style guitar with two EMG 81 pickups. During the late 1990s and the 2000s, he was also seen with two ESP [[Telecaster]] models (one white, one black) with EMG 81 pickups, which were used for the majority of his six-string material. Townsend also utilized two ESP Custom Shop Horizon 7-string guitars with a 27" baritone scale and EMG 81-7 pickups, which closely resembled ESP's [[Stephen Carpenter]] signature model. He has also been seen with the Stephen Carpenter SC-607 and SC-607B. He was also occasionally seen playing what is believed to be a [[Fender Stratocaster|Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS]] during [[Accelerated Evolution]] and [[Synchestra]]-era shows (mainly for performing "Deadhead"). At the time, this was the only guitar Devin Townsend was seen with that did not have EMG pickups, but was modified with a [[Seymour Duncan]] STK-S2n Hot Stack in the neck.
 
After returning to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]], and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string [[baritone guitar]] with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup in the neck position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on [[Ziltoid The Omniscient]]. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a [[Floyd Rose]] vibrato unit (for [[Open C tuning|Open C]] and [[Open B tuning]], respectively).
 
In 2012, Townsend announced that he was using other guitars besides his [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]] models, including two [[Sadowsky]] Telecaster models and a number of [[Framus]] [[Semi-acoustic guitar|semi-hollow body guitar]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3BwXTb5_1o|title=Video: Devin Townsend on his Framus Guitar|publisher=Framus/Warwick|access-date=November 26, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522212608/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3BwXTb5_1o|archive-date=May 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz3CXJf-NQ4|title=Video: AK1974 "Mandelbrot" for Devin Townsend|publisher=Framus/Warwick|access-date=November 26, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522153838/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz3CXJf-NQ4|archive-date=May 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llTne4JqnyM|title=Video: Devin Townsend AK1974|publisher=Framus/Warwick|access-date=November 26, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523022023/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llTne4JqnyM|archive-date=May 23, 2014}}</ref> In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can't say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V's. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand."
 
For [[Strapping Young Lad]] and solo projects from 1996 – 2004, Townsend mainly used the [[Peavey 5150]] head, with [[Mesa Boogie]] and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] 4x12 cabinets, for his main sounds. Around 2005, Townsend began to utilize Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier and Stiletto amp heads, boosted with a [[Maxon Effects|Maxon]] OD808, running into Mesa/Boogie 2x12 cabinets, and Marshall 4x12 cabinets. He would also run a 3rd signal into a 1990s [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] GP-100, which would be amplified by a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp. He would still make use of the Peavey head for some solo recordings, such as Synchestra. He switched to a Fractal Audio AxeFx system in 2010, replacing his entire Mesa/Boogie and Marshall rig. He has been through a number of outboard modules that were mainly used for echo/reverb effects, something that Townsend is known for as a part of his signature sound. One of his favorites is the Roland GP-100, a unit that Townsend still uses along with his Fractal units. He also used a [[TC Electronic]] G-Force in tandem with his Mesa/Boogie rig. Townsend also utilizes [[D'Addario (manufacturer)|D'Addario]] Strings (.010-.052 and .010-.060) and Planet Waves Custom Series cables.
 
As of 2014, he reintroduced the Dual Rectifier into his rig using a wet-dry-wet setup with the Dual Rectifier being the center dry sound and the AxeFx being the stereo effected sounds using the model of the Dual Rectifier as a basis. In 2015, for live shows, the Dual Rectifier was replaced with a Kemper Profiler Amplifier, and the Roland GP-100 was retired in favor of effects in the Fractal Axe-FX.
 
At NAMM 2016, Townsend introduced a signature set of [[Fishman (company)|Fishman]] pickups in the Fluence line and a signature Framus guitar that features an original body shapes, the Fishman pickups and the [[Evertune]] Bridge.

In November 2017, Townsend posted to social media and forums that his equipment list had been reduced, explaining how he had eliminated a number of pieces of equipment from his setup. He wrote, "I was working with many amp companies, but I have made my choice and have settled on a single Axe Fx 2XL+ for my ENTIRE chain. I use Framus Guitars, Fishman Pickups, 
D'Addario strings, Fractal Axe Fx. One Rig to rule them all =)"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forum.fractalaudio.com/threads/my-journey-to-fractal-by-devin-townsend-part-1-2.132432/|title=Article: My Journey to Fractal|publisher=Fractal Audio Systems|access-date=November 15, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042324/https://forum.fractalaudio.com/threads/my-journey-to-fractal-by-devin-townsend-part-1-2.132432/|archive-date=December 1, 2017}}</ref>

In 2018 Mooer released the Devin Townsend signature Ocean Machine pedal, featuring twin delays, reverb and looper with infinite feedback in a genuine collaboration which Townsend enthusiastically recommended. The relatively unusual pedal design was received well, with 5 star reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicradar.com/reviews/mooer-ocean-machine|title=Article: Mooer Ocean Machine review Devin Townsend makes waves with this dual delay reverb and looper|publisher=MusicRadar|access-date=July 14, 2021}}</ref>
