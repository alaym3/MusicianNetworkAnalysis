'''Øystein Olaf Sunde''' (born 24 January 1947) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[folk music|folk]] singer and [[guitarist]]. He is known for his high-speed guitar and banjo style and his satirical lyrics. Although often regarded as a comedian, Sunde is a versatile guitarist who has played with several [[Dixieland]] bands and jazz combos over the years.

==Early years==
He was born 24 January 1947 in [[Oslo]], but his family moved to [[Skarnes]] in 1954 where Sunde went to school. In 1955, the family moved back to [[Lambertseter]] in [[Oslo]] and Sunde continued school there.
The same year he started playing piano, but he did not like this because he was forced to rehearse scales and partially because his teacher could play boogiewoogie and Sunde was not allowed to do so by his teacher.
Despite protests from his parents he ended his piano playing career at the age of 7.

The next instrument Sunde played was a [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] but he started to cry after one hour, so he got a big [[grapefruit]] to comfort him, but after eating it he started to cry again. It was at this point his mother realized that he was not fit for playing this kind of instrument and later he started to play a [[Cornet|B-Cornet]]. Even though Sunde did not quite find this instrument comfortable he played it for a few years mainly because he had failed so many times earlier.

When Sunde attended 6th grade his woodwork teacher made him make a [[mandolin]]laika without any drawings. When finished, the instrument was too big but sounded magnificent. This was what caused Sunde to find music fun mainly because he was not forced to practice this instrument. Later Sunde bought a used guitar, and the mandolin was never used again.

In 1960 Sunde heard the song "Apache" played by [[The Shadows]] and he was "hooked". Later, at his [[confirmation]], he got his first electric guitar. He dreamed of a Fender but it would take Sunde 11 years to get one.
He also met one of his 'heroes' [[Chet Atkins]] in late 1971 who taught him some valuable lessons for 45 minutes.

Sunde attended the obligatory military service in the Norwegian Air Force base at Kolsås after basic training at Gardermoen. During his military training he wrote one of his hits "Fire melk og dagbla' for i går" on a boring night shift. After a while Sunde was allowed to postpone his military training to attend to "Schous Tekniske Institutt" for education. In 1969 he had to serve the remainder of his military training at Kolsås.

At the end of the sixties Sunde was working on an education as engineer. However, during a Norwegian class Sunde was bored and instead of paying attention he wrote one of his greatest hits, named "Jaktprat." "Jaktprat" is one of Øystein Sunde's most famous songs ever. Due to many positive responses to this song it was at this point in his life that Sunde realized that he was "on track" of something that he should continue doing.

After a successful cooperation with Mikkel Aas in late 1970 after releasing the LP "1001 Fnatt", who sold over 25000 copies, Sunde decided to drop education and work full-time as an entertainer.

==The start of a career==
In 1976, Øystein Sunde moved back to [[Skarnes]] with his wife Gudrun, where he could pursue his hobbies, like model airplanes and garden golf.

Øystein Sunde became a part of the musician social environment in the [[Oslo|capital]], and he could often be found at the singer's club [[Dolphins (club)|Dolphins]] with talented people like [[Kari Svendsen]], [[Lillebjørn Nilsen]], [[Ole Paus]], [[Finn Kalvik]] and [[Hege Tunaal]]. He has played in bands like [[Hitch-Hikers]], [[Hi-Five]], [[Christiania Fusel & Blaagress]] and [[Gitarkameratene]] (with fellow guitarists [[Lillebjørn Nilsen]], [[Halvdan Sivertsen]] and [[Jan Eggum]]), and he has participated in [[wikt:matinée|matinée]]s, but he gained most fame as a solo artist. His lyrics are often about everyday situations from his own life, like [[diaper|nappy]] changing and [[model aircraft|model airplanes]]. He has said that he cannot write a song that contains no comic element. Expressions like "kjekt å ha" ("nice to have") have entered the Norwegian everyday language.

His recordings also include several instrumentals, like the folk tune [[Fanitullen]] or the high-speed, technical Ned Vøringsfossen (Down the Vøringsfossen Waterfall) and [[Lightning rod|Lynavleder'n]] and the challenging Kulingbarsel.

[[Andreas Diesen]] once described Sunde as "a master with words and a great musical talent". "When describing Øystein Sunde, I can quote [[André Bjerke]], who once said about himself that he 'was into words'. Sunde sings about the German [[travel trailer|caravan]] on Norwegian roads or about [[artisan]]s at their worst - all with a lot of [[irony]]."

==Recognition==
Øystein Sunde was the first Scandinavian to receive a signature model series from [[C. F. Martin & Company]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/kultur/1.6841549|title=Øystein Sunde med signaturgitar|date=29 October 2009}}</ref>

Sunde is by many considered one of Norway's finest guitarists, which has led to several myths about his skill. The most common is that [[Eric Clapton]] and/or [[Mark Knopfler]] is supposed to have said that Sunde is the world's best guitar player.<ref>http://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/klipp/600266/</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tv.nrk.no/serie/aapen-post/FUHA22001699/11-03-1999#|title = 11. Mars 1999}}</ref> Evidence of this myth is non-existent and it is similar to another myth involving [[Phil Keaggy]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Jimi Hendrix is supposed to have said that [[Terry Kath]] is better than himself.
