'''American Football''' (sometimes stylised in all lowercase as '''american football''' or '''americ anfootball''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Urbana, Illinois]], United States, originally active from 1997 until 2000, and again from 2014. Guitarist/bassist and singer [[Mike Kinsella]] (formerly of [[Cap'n Jazz]] and [[Joan of Arc (band)|Joan of Arc]] and currently of [[Owen (band)|Owen]]), drummer and trumpet player Steve Lamos (formerly of The One Up Downstairs, one-time member of [[The Firebird Band]] and [[Edward Burch]] & the Staunch Characters, and currently of The Geese and DMS), who has since left the band, and guitar player Steve Holmes (also of The Geese) formed the band.

Despite the group's short initial lifespan, their [[American Football (1999 album)|self-titled debut album]] became one of the most acclaimed [[emo]] and [[math rock]] records of its era. American Football reunited in 2014, with Kinsella's cousin [[Nate Kinsella]] joining the band, and have since released two more albums both bearing the same name as their debut; ''[[American Football (2016 album)|American Football]]'' (2016) and ''[[American Football (2019 album)|American Football]]'' (2019).

==History==
Mike Kinsella and Steve Holmes knew one another at an early age, as both were students at Wheeling High School in Wheeling, IL, where Kinsella played drums for [[Cap'n Jazz]]; Holmes played guitar in a variety of bands.  Kinsella and Lamos began playing together with David Johnson and Allen Johnson in 1997 under the name 'The One Up Downstairs', in which Kinsella was exclusively a vocalist. Three songs were recorded under this name, with the intention of releasing them as a 7" record on [[Polyvinyl Record Co.|Polyvinyl Records]]. However, the band splintered before the record could be pressed and the songs were shelved. The three tracks recorded by The One Up Downstairs would finally be released in 2006 as a digital download EP, and in 2009, as a 7" record through Polyvinyl.

David Johnson and Allen Johnson went on to form the band Very Secretary (and later Favorite Saints), while Kinsella and Lamos began working with Steve Holmes. American Football completed a total of two releases&mdash;a titular EP in 1998 and its [[American Football (1999 album)|debut album]] in 1999, both through Polyvinyl Records. Though the band did not record bass on the EP, Kinsella played bass guitar on some songs for the LP.

Within a year of the release of its full-length, American Football became a studio project. Shortly thereafter, the band mutually decided to stop recording together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polyvinylrecords.com/ |title=Polyvinyl Records |publisher=Polyvinyl Records |access-date=December 27, 2016}}</ref> Still, American Football gained critical acclaim for that album, which merged the plain-spoken, confessional lyrics and the varying [[time signature]]s of [[math rock]] with a softer musical sensibility. These characteristics carried on in Mike Kinsella's solo project [[Owen (band)|Owen]], and Kinsella would later re-record "Never Meant" as Owen in 2004.

On March 20, 2014, Polyvinyl Records announced<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/polyvinylrecords/posts/10202668367967014 |title=Pre-order American Football Deluxe... - Polyvinyl Record Company |publisher=[[Facebook]] |access-date=December 27, 2016}}</ref> a deluxe edition of the band's self-titled album, ''American Football'', which includes the original nine tracks from its 1999 release, as well as 10 additional unheard demos and live recordings. The deluxe edition is available as a 180-Gram Red 2xLP, 2xCD, cassette tape, and an MP3 download. Another version — limited to 2,000 copies of a 180-Gram Green/Yellow 2xLP — was also announced. All versions were released May 20, 2014.<ref>[https://www.polyvinylrecords.com/#product/american_football_deluxe]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213203937/https://www.polyvinylrecords.com/ |date=February 13, 2015 }}</ref>

On October 21, 2016, the band released their second album for purchase worldwide through Polyvinyl Records. The album's cover featured the same house photographed on the band's first full-length.
