== History ==

=== Formation, early years and breakthrough ===
The group played their first gig at 19 April 1968 at the Nag's Head pub, which was at the junction of York Road and Plough Road in [[Battersea]], London. All members were relatively young.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johns |title=York Rd Battersea |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/wandsworthheritageservice/10017654914/ |publisher=Wandsworth Heritage Centre |access-date=15 January 2015}}</ref> Bass player [[Andy Fraser]] was 15 years old, lead guitarist [[Paul Kossoff]] was 17, and both lead singer [[Paul Rodgers]] and drummer [[Simon Kirke]] were 18. By November of that year, having been given the name Free by [[Alexis Korner]], they had recorded their first album, titled ''[[Tons of Sobs]]'', for [[Island Records]] and, although it was not released until the following year, the album documents their first six months together and contains studio renditions of much of their early live set. To promote their forthcoming debut album they also opened some gigs at the end of 1968 for The Who, who played a short theatre tour with Arthur Brown.

Paul Kossoff and Simon Kirke first became friends in the R&B band [[Black Cat Bones]], but they wanted to move on. Paul Kossoff saw vocalist Paul Rodgers singing with the band Brown Sugar while visiting the Fickle Pickle, an R&B club in London's [[Finsbury Park]].<ref name="Free - The Official Website">{{Cite web|title=Free - The Official Website|url=https://freebandofficial.com/|access-date=2020-08-27|language=en-US}}</ref> He was immediately impressed and asked if he could jam with Rodgers onstage. Along with Kirke, they began the search for a fourth member. [[Alexis Korner]] recommended Andy Fraser to the band, who had already been playing with [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]]. Korner also provided the name "Free" to the newly formed band.

Unlike their previous albums, ''Tons of Sobs'' and ''Free'', their album ''[[Fire and Water (Free album)|Fire and Water]]'', released in 1970, was a huge success largely due to its hit single "[[All Right Now]]", which reached No.&nbsp;1 on the UK rock music charts, No.&nbsp;2 on the [[UK singles chart]] and No.&nbsp;4 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="Free - The Official Website"/> The album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK charts and No.&nbsp;17 on the U.S charts, making it the most successful Free album. "All Right Now" became a No.&nbsp;1 hit in over 20 [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]] and was recognised by [[ASCAP]] in 1990 for garnering 1,000,000 plus radio plays in the US by late 1989. In 2000 an award was given to Paul Rodgers by the [[British Phonographic Industry|British Music Industry]] when "All Right Now" passed 2,000,000 radio plays in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brianmay.com/queen/tour05/biog/biog_paul.html |title=QUEEN + PAUL RODGERS TOUR SPRING 2005 |publisher=Brianmay.com |date=17 December 1949 |access-date=21 July 2014}}</ref> In July 1970 the band, despite their name, were the only advertised band to decline to perform for free for the ailing [[Phun City]] festival - according to promoter [[Mick Farren]] they "heard the deal and fucked off without even getting out of the car."<ref>[[Mick Farren]] ''Give The Anarchist A Cigarette – Chapter: Phun City, Here We Come'' p271 Pimlico Press 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-7126-6732-6}}</ref>

''[[Highway (Free album)|Highway]]'' was their fourth studio album, recorded extremely quickly in September 1970. ''Highway'' performed poorly in the charts, reaching No.&nbsp;41 in the UK and No.&nbsp;190 in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=498800553631 |title=Free: Highway |publisher=newburycomics.com |access-date=21 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808063720/http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_viewupc.php?storenr=103&upc=498800553631 |archive-date=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== First break-up, reformation, and final break-up ===
The band disbanded in 1971 because of differences between Fraser and Rodgers, who felt he was not being listened to.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freetheband.co.uk/the-band/ |title=The Band &#124; Free (Band) Official Website |publisher=Freetheband.co.uk |access-date=21 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417131707/http://www.freetheband.co.uk/the-band/ |archive-date=17 April 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This led to the release of the live album called ''[[Free Live!]]''. In early 1972 the band set aside their differences and reformed in an effort to save Kossoff from his growing drug addiction,<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Snow|first=Mat|date=5 March 1991|title=Out Of It|journal=Q Magazine|volume=55|pages=15}}</ref> and released ''[[Free at Last (Free album)|Free at Last]]'' in June of the same year.<ref name="Paulkossoffofficial.com"/>

Fraser left the band in mid-1972, frustrated by Kossoff's unreliability at being able to perform at shows or even at showing up. The remaining members recruited Japanese bass player [[Tetsu Yamauchi]] and keyboardist [[John "Rabbit" Bundrick]], who had worked with Kossoff and Kirke during Free's initial split, recording ''[[Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu and Rabbit]]''<ref>{{cite web |author=James Chrispell |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/kossoff-kirke-tetsu-rabbit-mw0000763879 |title=Kossoff Kirke Tetsu & Rabbit – Kossoff/Kirke/Tetsu/Rabbit &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=20 November 2007 |access-date=21 July 2014}}</ref> and recorded what would be Free's final album, ''[[Heartbreaker (Free album)|Heartbreaker]]''. Kossoff was replaced by ex-[[Osibisa]] guitarist Wendell Richardson for a USA tour in 1973, but shortly thereafter Free disbanded for good. Rodgers and Kirke went on to form [[Bad Company]],<ref name="Bio - Paul Rodgers Official Site">{{cite web |url=http://paulrodgers.com/bio/ |title=Bio – Paul Rodgers Official Site |publisher=Paulrodgers.com |access-date=21 July 2014}}</ref> Fraser formed [[Sharks (band formed 1972)|Sharks]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freetheband.co.uk/the-band/andy-fraser/ |title=Andy Fraser &#124; Free (Band) Official Website |publisher=Freetheband.co.uk |date=3 July 1952 |access-date=21 July 2014}}</ref> and later the Andy Fraser Band, and Kossoff formed [[Back Street Crawler (band)|Back Street Crawler]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Back Street Crawler |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/back-street-crawler-mn0000073469 |title=Back Street Crawler &#124; Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=21 July 2014}}</ref>

=== After Free ===
With Kossoff in better health again in late 1975, he was delighted that ex-colleagues Rodgers and Kirke asked him to join them on stage for two nights. A British tour was set to begin on 25 April 1976 with Back Street Crawler headlining with Bad Company in support of Back Street Crawler's second album, but again Kossoff's drug addictions contributed to a drastic decline in the guitarist's health.<ref name=":0" /> On a flight from Los Angeles to New York City on 19 March 1976, Paul Kossoff died from a pulmonary embolism; he was 25.<ref>{{cite web |author=Artist Biography by Greg Prato |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-kossoff-mn0000019354/biography |title=Paul Kossoff &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=21 July 2014}}</ref>

After parting with Bad Company in 1982, Rodgers went on to explore the heavy blues stylings of Free again in his solo career during the 1980s and 1990s, and in the bands [[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]] and [[The Law (English band)|The Law]].<ref name="Bio - Paul Rodgers Official Site"/> Subsequently, he teamed up as vocalist with two of the three remaining members of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] ([[Brian May]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]]). In September 2008, Queen + Paul Rodgers released their first studio album ''[[The Cosmos Rocks]]''. Rodgers also performed Free and Bad Company songs whilst on tour with Queen, in addition to the traditional Queen songs and new cuts from their most recently released album.

Rodgers and Kirke toured again with Bad Company from 2012 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.badcompany.com/concerts.html |title=Bad Company Concerts |publisher=Badcompany.com |access-date=21 July 2014}}</ref> Andy Fraser died on 16 March 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teamrock.com/news/2015-03-17/free-bassist-andy-fraser-dead-at-62 |title=Free bassist Andy Fraser dead at 62 |publisher=TeamRock |access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref> In 2017, Paul Rodgers embarked on a Free Spirit UK Tour in May 2017 to celebrate the music of Free by performing songs strictly from the Free catalogue.<ref>{{Cite web|last=B|first=Best Classic|last2=News|first2=s StaffThe BCB team brings you the latest Breaking|last3=Contests|last4=stories|first4=On This Day rock history|last5=Videos|first5=Classic|last6=retro-Charts|last7=more.|date=2015-08-06|title=Paul Rodgers Opens 'Free Spirit' Tour|url=https://bestclassicbands.com/paul-rodgers-free-spirit-tour-5-6-17/|access-date=2020-06-18|website=Best Classic Bands|language=en-GB}}</ref> In 2019 Bad Company reformed to tour in support of the first leg on Lynyrd Skynyrd's Last Of The Street Survivors Tour.
