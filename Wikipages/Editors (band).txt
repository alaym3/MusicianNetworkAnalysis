'''Editors''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in 2002 in [[Birmingham]]. Previously known as '''Pilot''', '''The Pride''' and '''Snowfield''', the band currently consists of [[Tom Smith (musician)|Tom Smith]] (lead vocals, guitar, piano), [[Russell Leetch]] (bass guitar, synthesiser, backing vocals), Ed Lay (drums, percussion, backing vocals), [[Justin Lockey]] (lead guitar), and Elliott Williams (keys, synthesisers, guitars, and backing vocals).

Editors have so far released two [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] studio albums, and six in total, with several million combined sales. Their debut album ''[[The Back Room (album)|The Back Room]]'' was released in 2005. It contained the hits "[[Munich (song)|Munich]]" and "[[Blood (Editors song)|Blood]]" and the following year received a [[Mercury Prize]] nomination.

Their follow-up album ''[[An End Has a Start]]'' went to number 1 in the [[UK Album Chart]] in June 2007 and earned the band a [[Brit Awards]] nomination for best British Band. It also spawned another Top 10 hit single, "[[Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors]]". The band's third album, ''[[In This Light and on This Evening]]'', was released in October 2009 and went straight to number 1 in the [[UK Album Chart]]. The band released their fourth studio album, ''[[The Weight of Your Love]]'', in July 2013, followed by self-produced ''[[In Dream]]'' in October 2015. In 2018, the band released their sixth album ''[[Violence (Editors album)|Violence]]''.

Alongside their critical acclaim and strong success in the [[UK Singles Chart|charts]], Editors have consistently enjoyed sold-out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. Their brand of dark indie rock is commonly compared to the sound of bands such as [[Echo & the Bunnymen]], [[Joy Division]], [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], [[The Chameleons]] and [[U2]].

==History==
===Formation (2002–2004)===
The band met while studying [[Music Technology]] at [[University of Staffordshire|Staffordshire University]], but living in [[Birmingham]] and playing at venues such as the Jug of Ale and the Flapper & Firkin, the former of which bands such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] played in during their primitive years,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/moseleys-jug-of-ale-to-be-demolished-63087|title=Moseley's Jug of Ale to be demolished|first=Birmingham|last=Live|date=9 May 2008|work=Birmingham Mail}}</ref> helped the band obtain a record deal. In an interview in 2015, Tom Smith said, "Birmingham is very important. Looking back further it was where we all lived together in the early years, played all those Flapper and Jug of Ale shows, and then got our record deal. We've always said although only one of us was brought up there, Birmingham was the band's home".

The band was initially known as Pilot and played its first show under this name in 2002.<ref name="zeromag">{{cite web |url=http://www.zeromag.com/articles/article_view.php?id=949&pi=1&PHPSESSID= |title= EDITORS: All Sparks Won't Burn Out |access-date=2 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602195631/http://www.zeromag.com/articles/article_view.php?id=949&pi=1&PHPSESSID= |archive-date=2009-06-02}}</ref> While in college, the band constructed a marketing strategy which involved placing hundreds of promotional stickers across the walls of Stafford asking "Who's the Pilot?".<ref name=zeromag/> However, they realised the name was already taken by a [[Pilot (band)|1970s Scottish pop group]], so they changed their name to The Pride.<ref>[http://www.bigtakeover.com/interviews/interview-editors-part-iv-band-origins Interview: Editors (Part IV: Band Origins)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516124750/http://www.bigtakeover.com/interviews/interview-editors-part-iv-band-origins |date=16 May 2008 }}, www.bigtakeover.com, 5 September 2006.

They made a promo under this name with the tracks "Come Share the View" and "Forest Fire" and then uploaded them onto the [[internet]], making the songs available to listen to on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''Onemusic Unsigned''.<ref name="editorsmusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.editorsmusic.co.uk/index.php/Band/Band.html |title= The Story of Editors |access-date=2 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622085618/http://www.editorsmusic.co.uk/index.php/Band/Band.html |archive-date=22 June 2009}}</ref> A review of the songs reads "''The Pride'' keep things subliminally lo-fi. Refreshingly simple and restrained, "Come Share The View" is a lesson in welding hypnotic soundscapes with white noise while showing allegiance to the school of slo-mo on "Forest Fire"".<ref name=editorsmusic/> The band then took its music offline to create mystery and anxiousness and ensure that more "[[Artist and Repertoire|A&R]]" representatives came to see them perform.<ref name=zeromag/>

They then changed the line-up with Ed Lay replacing Geraint Owen on drums as he began to focus on his Welsh band ''The Heights''. Under this lineup they became known as Snowfield. They played their debut gig under this name at the request of [[Fused Magazine]] in March 2003. The following summer the band self-released a demo six-track EP, all of which went on to become future Editors songs. Then, as it was the home of their management and the nearest big city, the band relocated to Birmingham after graduation in the autumn of 2003.<ref>Ankeny, Jason, Allmusic

For the next year, the different band members then worked part-time jobs along with the rest of their work with the band.

On 26 March 2011, Editors performed their first tour date of the year at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] as the headline act for the penultimate show in the 2011 [[Teenage Cancer Trust]], during which they showcased two new songs, "Two Hearted Spider" and "The Sting".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/editors/2011/royal-albert-hall-london-england-63d25ef7.html |title=Editors Concert Setlist at Royal Albert Hall, London on March 26, 2011 |publisher=setlist.fm |access-date=7 December 2011}}</ref> In October 2011, Editors played their first shows ever in [[Latin America]] with two dates in [[Mexico City]].

In October 2011, Smith spoke to Q Radio about the new album. "It's still going to be fairly electronic, I think, compared to our earlier records. So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think we just need to, kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well. It's our fourth record and we don't want to feel like we're doing the same thing again."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.qthemusic.com/2011/10/tom_smith_new_editors_album_wi.html |title=Tom Smith: 'New editors album will have a swagger' - Q Radio - News - QTheMusic.com |publisher=News.qthemusic.com |access-date=7 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029124353/http://news.qthemusic.com/2011/10/tom_smith_new_editors_album_wi.html |archive-date=29 October 2011}}</ref>

On 16 April 2012, it was announced that [[Chris Urbanowicz]] had left the group due to a difference in musical direction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.editorsofficial.com/news/detail/editors_and_chris_urbanowicz_part_ways/ |title=Editors and Chris Urbanowicz part ways |publisher=Editors Official |date=16 April 2012 |access-date=16 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419193759/http://www.editorsofficial.com/news/detail/editors_and_chris_urbanowicz_part_ways |archive-date=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Following Urbanowicz's departure the band played their first shows as a five piece with new members Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams in Birmingham, UK on 26 and 27 June 2012. On 29 June, they played at Main Square Festival in Arras, France, and on 30 June they headlined Rock Werchter festival in Belgium. At the shows they played new versions of "Two Hearted Spider" and "The Sting" as well as two new songs, "Sugar" and "Nothing".

On 8 April 2013 Tom Smith stated, via his official Twitter account, that "the record is being mastered today. it's finished. done."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/THMSSMTH/status/321174907050397697 |title=Twitter / THMSSMTH: the record is being mastered |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=2013-07-03}}</ref>

In February 2014 the band released their fourth single, "Sugar".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indieshuffle.com/editors-sugar/|title=Editors - Sugar|publisher=IndieShuffle.com|date=2014-02-07}}</ref>

Editors' first album, ''The Back Room'', was described as having a wiry and raw sound, which led it to being famously dubbed 'dark disco' by the [[NME]].<ref>[http://www.montrealmirror.com/2006/072706/music2.html Cutting-room dancefloor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206024217/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2006/072706/music2.html |date=6 February 2007 }}, www.montrealmirror.com, 1 August 2006. Retrieved 23 May 2008</ref> This sound was created by the use of [[synthesiser]]s, catchy [[riff|guitar riffs]] and simple, ambiguous [[lyrics]]. ''An End Has a Start'' showed progression to a new 'bigger' sound. This new sound was created by adding more textured layers to the songs as well as incorporating new forms of music into them. These include the adding of a choir in "[[Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors]]" and the inclusion of the sounds of the band playing [[Hide-and-seek]] in the song "Spiders".

Lead singer Smith announced that the band would explore a new direction on their next [[album]], pursuing a new, rawer sound.<ref name=NME1/> The new sound materialised itself on the third album through the use of traditional [[synthesiser]]s instead of the band's previous use of guitars. The producer of ''[[In This Light and on This Evening]]'', [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] also increased the importance of "vibe" in the music's sound, making it darker than the previous two albums, while also attempting to make the album sound as if it had been recorded live.<ref>Radio Interview, Couleur 3, 11 June 2009</ref>

While Smith tends to write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a collaborative effort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.editorsmusic.co.uk/index.php/Interviews/Left-Lion.html |title=Left Lion Talks To Chris |work=editorsmusic.co.uk |date=21 July 2005 |access-date=20 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602074136/http://www.editorsmusic.co.uk/index.php/Interviews/Left-Lion.html |archive-date=2 June 2009}}</ref> The song writing starts with Smith on the [[piano]] or [[acoustic guitar]] where he [[Multitrack recording|records]] them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'. Smith has said that he purposely makes the lyrics ambiguous so people can draw their own conclusions.<ref name=interview/>

"To us, it's interesting if it has a darkness," said Smith in 2015. "Whatever that is. On the lyric side of things, if I was singing about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn't ring true for me. I don't know why that is. People quite often say, 'oh, you write these sad lyrics but you're not a sad person' - and I'm not... I don't think you need to be sad to write a sad song, everybody has a dark side."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gigwise.com/features/103036/editors-video-interview-on-in-dream-depression-chris-urbanowicz |title=EDITORS: 'EVERYBODY HAS A DARK SIDE' |work=Gigwise |date=29 September 2015 |access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref>
