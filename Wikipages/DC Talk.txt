'''DC Talk''' (stylized as '''dc Talk''') is a [[Christian hip hop|Christian rap]] and [[Christian rock|rock]] trio. The group was formed at Liberty University in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] in 1987 by [[tobyMac|Toby McKeehan]], [[Michael Tait]], and [[Kevin Max|Kevin Max Smith]]. They released five major studio albums together: ''[[DC Talk (album)|DC Talk]]'' (1989), ''[[Nu Thang]]'' (1990), ''[[Free at Last (DC Talk album)|Free at Last]]'' (1992), ''[[Jesus Freak (album)|Jesus Freak]]'' (1995), and ''[[Supernatural (DC Talk album)|Supernatural]]'' (1998). In 2002, the ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music'' called DC Talk "the most popular overtly Christian act of all time."<ref name="EncyclopediaofCCM">{{cite book |last = Powell |first = Mark Allan |title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |publisher = Hendrickson Publishers |year = 2002 |location = Peabody, Massachusetts |pages = [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/239 239–42] |isbn = 1-56563-679-1 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/239 }}</ref>

In 2001, the group released an EP, ''[[Solo (dc Talk album)|Solo]]'', which contained two solo songs from each member. Since that time, DC Talk has been on an indefinite hiatus, and the three band members all have led solo careers and two have joined other groups. They performed and recorded individual songs together several times during the 2000s, although the group never officially reunited or disbanded.

The group's musical style evolved significantly throughout its career. Its first two releases, ''DC Talk'' and ''Nu Thang'', were predominantly [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Their third album, ''Free at Last'', also mainly took influence from hip hop while the group's music began to incorporate [[rock music|rock]] and other influences. The trio's last two albums, ''Jesus Freak'' and ''Supernatural'', were predominantly [[pop rock]]. They are currently on hiatus and no announcements of new albums have been made. In 2017, the band reunited for a cruise, and did so again in 2019.

==History==

===Formation===
While attending [[Liberty University]], Toby McKeehan met Michael Tait, and the two began to perform together. Tait had previously been featured on [[Jerry Falwell]]'s ''[[The Old Time Gospel Hour]]'' and with the Falwell Singers.<ref name="Rap Finds God">{{cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=Steve|date=January 24, 1994|title=Rap Finds God|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20107361,00.html|journal=[[People Magazine]]|access-date=June 21, 2009}}</ref> He also performed solo, what TobyMac later described as a "kind of an R&B/church-oriented music".<ref name="CCM_12_10">{{cite journal |last=Newcomb |first=Brian Quincy |date=April 1990 |title=Rhythm, Rhyme, & The New World Music |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=38, 40–41}}</ref>

The two joined forces to record a song that McKeehan had written, "Heavenbound".<ref name="Rap Finds God" /> They performed the song before an audience of 8,000 Liberty students with McKeehan rapping and Tait singing the chorus.<ref name="Rap Finds God"/> The song was well received, selling out the approximately 3,000 copies<ref name="Rap Finds God"/> of their demo tape, ''Christian Rhymes to a Rhythm''. The tape included "Heavenbound" and was distributed by the group in the Washington D.C. area.<ref name="Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music">{{cite encyclopedia|year=2005|title=DC Talk|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music|publisher=[[Routledge]]|last=Gersztyn|first=Bob|edition=1|volume=1|pages=97–98|isbn=0-415-94179-2}}</ref>

Kevin Max Smith came from a campus rock band to join the group.<ref name="CCM_12_10" /> Max was approached by Tait after performing [[The Imperials]]'s "Lord of the Harvest" during a chapel session. The two became friends and Max was introduced to McKeehan. All three moved off campus to live together.<ref name="auto">{{Citation|title=DC Talk - Narrow Is The Road|url=http://archive.org/details/DCTalkNarrowIsTheRoad|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> 

The success of the group's demo tape eventually led to a recording contract with [[Forefront Records]] in January 1989.<ref name="Rap Finds God" /><ref name="auto"/> Shortly after the signing of the recording contract the trio moved to Nashville, Tennessee,<ref name="auto"/> and called themselves "DC Talk and the One Way Crew".<ref name="Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music" /> The name was later simplified to "DC Talk", which came to stand for "decent Christian talk", though originally "DC" was taken from [[Washington, D.C.]], where Toby McKeehan had formerly been rapping.<ref name="Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music" />

===''DC Talk'' (1989)===
After signing the recording contract with ForeFront, the trio released their self-titled debut album, ''[[DC Talk (album)|DC Talk]]'', in 1989 with Mike Valliere and [[Vic Mignogna]]. The music video for their first single, "Heavenbound", received airplay on the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] network.<ref name="DC TALK-Def, Not Dumb">{{cite journal|title=DC TALK-Def, Not Dumb |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/stories/11534591/page2/dc%20talk/ |access-date=June 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720203050/http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/stories/11534591/page2/dc%20talk/ |archive-date=July 20, 2010 }}</ref>

===''Nu Thang'' (1990–1992)===
Their follow-up full-length release, ''[[Nu Thang]]'', and a Christmas three-song EP titled ''Yo! Ho! Ho!'', were both released in 1990. ''Nu Thang'' had two successful singles: "I Luv Rap Music" and "Can I Get a Witness".<ref name="Group_site" /> Apart from dealing strictly with Christian themes, the band incorporated songs addressing social issues, such as [[racism]] in the song "Walls" and abortion in "Children Can Live Without It".<ref name="DC TALK-Def, Not Dumb"/> The hip hop/pop styling of the album earned the band attention, expanding the group's audience, and by 1991, ''Nu Thang'' had sold 200,000 copies.<ref name="Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music"/> The band became an opening act for [[Michael W. Smith]] and received a [[GMA Dove Awards|Dove Award]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music"/><ref name="Soupernatural">{{cite web|url=http://www.soupernaturalmovie.com/soundtrack.html#04 |title=Soupernatural Movie Soundtrack - dc Talk Bio |publisher=Soupernaturalmovie.com |access-date=September 21, 2011}}</ref> The release of their ''Rap, Rock, n' Soul ''video garnered a wider audience for the group, being certified gold for long form video.<ref name="EncyclopediaofCCM"/><ref name="Soupernatural" />

In 1992, a year after its release, ''Nu Thang'' sold more than 300,000 copies and gave the trio two more Dove Awards.<ref name="Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music"/> In addition to the increasing attention that the group began to receive, DC Talk appeared on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' that same year.<ref name="Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music"/> "Nu Thang" was eventually certified gold, selling over 500,000 copies, an impressive feat for a Christian artist at that time.<ref name="EncyclopediaofCCM"/>

===''Free at Last'' (1992–1994)===
In November 1992, the group released their third album, ''[[Free at Last (DC Talk album)|Free at Last]]'', which was eventually certified platinum by the [[RIAA]] in 1995.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum Searchable Database |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007}}</ref> In 2001, CCM ranked "Free at Last" as the ninth best album in Christian music.<ref>{{cite book

In 1994, the band released a Christmas single, "[[We Three Kings]]", on the album "Joyful Christmas".

====''Free at Last: The Movie''====
{{Main|Free at Last: The Movie}}
During the ''Free at Last'' tour, the band was followed around by camera crews to film a documentary. The documentary was planned to be released as a theatrical film, ''[[Free at Last: The Movie]]'', and was heavily promoted on Lightmusic TV, a Christian music video show. After months of teaser trailers, they abruptly stopped, because the movie could not find a distributor.<ref name="uas">{{cite web|url=http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/dctalk.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111215021/http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/dctalk.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 11, 2009|title=Film as Art: Danél Griffin's Guide to Cinema:DC Talk: Free at Last|publisher=University of Alaska Southeast|access-date=August 18, 2009|author=Danél Griffin}}</ref> Eight years after the film was to be released theatrically, the movie was finally released on DVD in unfinished form. Some of the footage used for the movie was shown in the music video for "The Hardway".

===''Jesus Freak'' (1995–1997)===
''[[Jesus Freak (album)|Jesus Freak]]'' was released in 1995, and it achieved the highest first-week sales of any Christian release at the time,<ref name="Group_site" />{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} reaching No.&nbsp;16 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Artist Chart History-dc talk">{{cite web

''Jesus Freak'' marked a milestone in the group's commercial career, as they signed a deal with [[Virgin Records]] in 1996 to distribute their music to the mainstream market.<ref name="Soupernatural" /><ref>{{cite journal|title=Supermen |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |date=October 2000 |url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/stories/11535356/dc%20talk/ |access-date=July 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720203120/http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/stories/11535356/dc%20talk/ |archive-date=July 20, 2010 }}</ref> It also earned dc Talk their second [[Grammy]].<ref name="EncyclopediaofCCM"/>

[[Jesus Freak (song)|The title track]] is also of historical importance. It is believed to be the first link between grunge and rapcore in Contemporary Christian music, and was the first non–Adult Contemporary song to win the Dove Award for Song of the Year. The song was also played on some secular stations.<ref name="EncyclopediaofCCM"/><ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p27907|pure_url=yes}}|title=dc Talk: Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 18, 2009 |author=John Bush}}</ref> "[[Between You and Me (DC Talk song)|Between You and Me]]" was a successful single, reaching No.&nbsp;24 and No.&nbsp;29 respectively on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Adult Contemporary and [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref name="Artist Chart History-dc talk" /> and No.&nbsp;12 on [[Casey's Top 40]], while the video received regular airtime on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]].<ref name="Group_site" />

With the release of the album, the group launched a massive tour titled the ''Freakshow Tour'',<ref name="Group_site" /> which took the trio across the United States, Canada, and Europe. The group released a live video titled ''Live in Concert: Welcome To The Freak Show'' which contained footage from the tour.<ref name="Soupernatural" /> An audio CD of the soundtrack from the video was also released under the same title, reaching No.&nbsp;109 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="Artist Chart History-dc talk" /> The CD ''Welcome to the Freakshow'' was certified gold and won dc Talk another Grammy award.<ref name="EncyclopediaofCCM" />

The album is looked at by many as one of the greatest and most important albums to be released in Christian music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breathecast.com/articles/breathecast-throwback-thursday-dc-talk-s-jesus-freak-changes-christian-music-forever-14002/ |title=BreatheCast Throwback Thursday: DC Talk's 'Jesus Freak' Changes Christian Music Forever with Most 'Overtly Christian Act' of All Time (VIDEO) |date=February 13, 2014 |access-date=July 8, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006082556/http://www.breathecast.com/articles/breathecast-throwback-thursday-dc-talk-s-jesus-freak-changes-christian-music-forever-14002/ |archive-date=October 6, 2016}}</ref>

===''Supernatural'' (1998–2000)===
''[[Supernatural (DC Talk album)|Supernatural]]'', released in 1998, was their last all-new studio album. Upon release, the album overtook ''Jesus Freak'' to set a new record for the highest first week sales for a Christian release.<ref name="Group_site" /> It debuted at No.&nbsp;4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 charts, a feat for a [[Christian rock]] album.<ref name="Soupernatural" /> ''Supernatural'' abandoned the hip hop/rap style found on the group's earlier releases to settle for the pop/rock sound.<ref name="Soupernatural" /> The group has stated in ''The Supernatural Experience'' video that this album was different; it was a collaborative effort of all three members.<ref name="Soupernatural" /> The singles for the album received their fair share of radio play on modern rock, [[contemporary Christian music|contemporary Christian]], and alternative outlets. The group then embarked on a 60-city tour across the United States titled, ''The Supernatural Experience''. Footage from the tour was combined with interviews and released as ''The Supernatural Experience'' video and was certified gold for long form video.<ref name="EncyclopediaofCCM"/>

In addition to touring and recording ''[[Supernatural (dc Talk album)|Supernatural]]'', the members of the group went on to co-author a book titled ''[[Jesus Freaks (book)|Jesus Freaks]]'' in collaboration with [[Voice of the Martyrs|The Voice of the Martyrs]] in 1999. The book contains the shortened biographies and incidents in the lives of famous and lesser-known Christians who stood up for their faith. Since then, the group has co-authored a series of other books.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In 2000, DC Talk hosted a show titled Intermission: A Decade of DC Talk.<ref name="Timeline">{{cite web|url=http://dctalkunite.com/dc_talk/dctalk_timeline.html|title=dc Talk Timeline|publisher=Dctalkunite.com|access-date=September 21, 2011}}</ref> A compilation album titled ''[[Intermission: The Greatest Hits]]'' was then released, containing many of their previously recorded songs either remixed or in their original formats. Two new songs, "Chance" and "Sugar Coat It", were recorded for the album. ''Intermission'' reached No.&nbsp;81 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="Artist Chart History-dc talk"/>

=== Hiatus period (2000–present) ===
In 2000, the members announced that they would be taking a break from the group to pursue solo efforts.

The group has a stance against [[racism]], with a [[Christianity|Christian]] message in its music. "We're very open about our [[Christianity|Christian]] faith," says McKeehan, "but when we make our records we want to create a musical experience that anyone can immerse themselves in." But still, he says, "one of our goals is to encourage listeners to question themselves and to seek out truth."<ref name="DC Talk Bio Page">[http://www.dctalk.com/bio.html] {{dead link|date=May 2021}}</ref>

''E.R.A.C.E.'' ('''E'''liminating '''R'''acism '''A'''nd '''C'''reating '''E'''quality) was launched in September 1997 when dc Talk participated in the "Racial Reconciliation Rally" in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. The rally was part of a week-long emphasis on racial reconciliation.<ref name=EHistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.erace.com/about/history.shtml |title=the E.R.A.C.E. foundation - our history |publisher=Erace.com |access-date=September 21, 2011}}</ref> In 1998, the group began the E.R.A.C.E. Foundation to combat racism.<ref name="EHistory" /> The foundation was started after four years of discussion and planning with manager Dan Pitts and [[Gotee Records]] President, [[Joey Elwood]]. The primary aim of the foundation is to educate and equip America's youth with "an understanding of the importance of interracial unity". The foundation works on healing historically divided groups and healing rifts within the society.<ref name="EHistory" />
