Webster formed a duo with his longtime friend Chris Holloway known as The Graduates. In 2008, the duo released their untitled first EP on social networking website [[Myspace]].

The following year, Scott and OG Chess, one of Scott's schoolmates, formed the group The Classmates. The Classmates released two projects, with ''Buddy Rich'' in 2009 and ''Cruis'n USA'' in 2010.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/travis-scott-mn0002998422/biography|title=Travis Scott|publisher=[[AllMusic.com]]|access-date=August 24, 2018|archive-date=August 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824135328/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/travis-scott-mn0002998422/biography|url-status=live}}</ref> Scott mainly handled production work on both projects. The duo remained together until late 2012, when personal conflicts and financial disputes led to the disbandment of the group.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Is Travi$ Scott?

After leaving college, Scott moved from Houston to [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] in New York City where Scott began working with friend Mike Waxx, who owned the music website Illroots. After moving to New York, Scott slept on the floor at his friend's house and spent most of his time at Just Blaze's studio.

In Los Angeles, Webster was abandoned by his friend who had promised to help him by providing housing. His parents cut him off financially and he eventually was forced to relocate back to Houston, where his parents kicked him out of their home. Webster moved back to Los Angeles once again and began to sleep on the couch of a friend who studied at [[University of Southern California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/10/who-is-travis-scott/meeting-kanye-for-the-first-time|title=Who Is Travi$ Scott?Meeting Kanye for the First Time|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=February 4, 2018|archive-date=February 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205074140/http://www.complex.com/music/2012/10/who-is-travis-scott/meeting-kanye-for-the-first-time|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Atlanta]]-based rapper and owner of [[Grand Hustle Records]], [[T.I.]] would later hear one of Webster's productions, titled "Lights (Love Sick)".
