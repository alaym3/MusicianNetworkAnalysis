They are a part of [[Amenra]]'s Church of Ra collective, alongside other bands such as [[The Black Heart Rebellion]],  Wiegedood, and DehnSora.

Following a self-titled EP, Oathbreaker have released three studio albums: ''Mælstrøm'' (2011), ''[[Eros/Anteros|<nowiki>Eros|Anteros</nowiki>]]'' (2013) and ''[[Rheia (album)|Rheia]]'' (2016).

== History ==
===Formation and Early Years===
Gilles and Caro were childhood friends, meeting when Caro was aged 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.echoesanddust.com/2017/01/oathbreaker/|title=(((O))) INTERVIEW: CARO TANGHE AND GILLES DEMOLDER FROM OATHBREAKER|website=Echoes and Dust|date=14 January 2017}}</ref> The duo eventually met Lennart Bossu, and formed a band which played in the Belgian Hardcore scene, performing live with bands such as [[Rise and Fall (band)|Rise and Fall]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blowthescene.com/interviews/rise-and-fall-with-oathbreaker-interview.html|title=EXCLUSIVE Rise and Fall with Oathbreaker Interview|website=Blow The Scene|date=19 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blowthescene.com/interviews/oathbreaker-interview.html|title=Oathbreaker Interview|website=Blow The Scene|date=15 August 2011}}</ref> Over time, their style progressively changed, before parting ways with their drummer.  In 2008, they had met Ivo Debrabandere, and evolved into what would become Oathbreaker, writing and releasing their debut EP in 2008.

===Debut Album and First Tours (2008-2012)===
Over the course of the next two years, the band had begun to gradually write what would become their debut album, ''Mælstrøm'', coming to rehearsal with small pieces and ideas for songs, combining them together. Before the release of the album, Lennart Bossu said in an interview, "It’s the only way we know how to write songs, even though there are faster ways I’m sure." In the Fall of 2010, the and had met with Michael Neyt, and Lander Cluyse, to engineer and record, and with Kurt Ballou to mix it. Lacking a singular recording location, the album had been recorded in a mix of several studios, and bedrooms. In July 2011, the album was released on Thirty Days To Nights Records, to small critical press, with above average to rave reviews. Most reviews had come to a general agreement that the band had a strong future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scenepointblank.com/reviews/oathbreaker/maelstrom/|title=Oathbreaker Maelstrom Review|website=Scene Point Blank}}</ref> They then spent the latter half of 2011 into 2012 touring throughout Germany with Italian band Hierophant, as well as Northern and Eastern Europe with Rise and Fall, and The Secret. In 2012 they began their first US tour, on the east coast, before returning to Europe to begin work on their sophomore album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaquarian.com/2012/09/19/interview-with-oathbreaker-breaking-borders/|title=Interview with Oathbreaker: Breaking Borders|website=The Aquarian}}</ref>
