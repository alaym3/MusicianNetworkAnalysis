==Biography==

===Youth and college===
Charles Thompson was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref name="pg3">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 3</ref> His father was a bar owner, and Thompson lived in Los Angeles, California, as a baby because his father wanted to "learn more about the restaurant and bar business."<ref name="pg4">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 4</ref> Thompson was introduced to music at a young age, as his parents listened to 1960s [[folk rock]]. His first guitar was his mother's, a [[Yamaha]] classical guitar bought with money from his father's bar tips, which he started to play at age "11 or 12."<ref name="pg3" />

Thompson's family moved around, first with his father, and then his stepfather, a religious man who "pursued real estate on both coasts"; his parents had separated twice by the time he was in first grade.<ref name="sp10">Sisario, 2006. p. 10</ref> When Thompson was 12, his mother and stepfather joined an evangelical church that was tied to the Pentecostal denomination [[General Council of the Assemblies of God in the United States of America|Assemblies of God]],<ref name="sp10" /> a move that influenced many of his songs written with the Pixies, which often refer to the Bible.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 11</ref>

He discovered the music of [[Christian rock]] singer-songwriter [[Larry Norman]] at 13 when Norman played at a religious [[summer camp]] that Thompson attended. Norman's music influenced Thompson to the extent that he titled the Pixies' first [[Extended play|EP]] and a lyric in the band's song "Levitate Me" after one of Norman's catchphrases, "[[Come On Pilgrim|Come on, pilgrim]]!" Thompson later described the music he listened to during his youth:<ref name="pg4" />

{{Blockquote|I used to hang out with some misfits. [...] We were the 'we listen to odd-ball music' kids. I wasn't hanging out at all-ages shows or trying to get into clubs to see bands, and I was buying records at used [[Record shop|records store]]s and borrowing them from the library. You just saw [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] records. So I didn't know [punk] music but I started to hear about it in high school. But it was probably a good thing that I didn't know it, that I instead listened to a lot of '60s records and this [[Contemporary Christian music|religious music]].}}

Thompson lived in an apartment in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]]. Just before his senior year, his family moved to [[Westport, Massachusetts]], where he received a ''Teenager of the Year'' award—the title of a later [[Teenager of the Year (album)|solo album]].<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 5</ref> During this time, Thompson composed several songs that appeared in his later career, including "[[Here Comes Your Man]]" from ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]],'' and "Velvety Instrumental Version."<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 88</ref>

After graduating from high school in 1983, Thompson studied at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], majoring in [[anthropology]].<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio">{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5149|pure_url=yes}} | title=allmusic (((Pixies > Biography))) | access-date=2006-10-27 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | work=Allmusic}}</ref> Thompson shared a room with another roommate for a [[semester]] before moving in with future Pixies guitarist [[Joey Santiago]].<ref name="pg9">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 9</ref> The two shared an interest in rock music, and Santiago introduced Thompson to 1970s punk and the music of [[David Bowie]]; they began to jam together.<ref name="officialprofile">{{cite web

}}</ref> It was at this time that Thompson discovered [[The Cars]], a band he described as "very influential on me and the Pixies."<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 10</ref>

In his second year of college, Thompson embarked on a trip to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], as part of an [[Student exchange program|exchange program]]. He spent six months in an apartment with a "weird, [[psychosis|psycho]] roommate," who later served as a direct inspiration for the Pixies song "[[Crackity Jones]];"<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 12</ref> many of the band's early songs refer to Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico. Thompson failed to learn to speak Spanish formally, and left his studies after debating whether he would go to New Zealand to view [[Halley's Comet]] (he later said it "seemed like the cool romantic thing to do at the time"),<ref>"No Time Wasters!" Q, No. 48, September 1990</ref> or start a rock band.<ref name="officialprofile" /> He wrote a letter urging Santiago, with the words "we gotta do it, now is the time, Joe,"<ref name="fgpg12">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 12</ref> to join him in a band upon his return to Boston.<ref name="fgpg11">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 11</ref>

===Pixies===
{{Main|Pixies (band)}}
Soon after returning to Massachusetts, Thompson dropped out of college, and moved to Boston with Santiago.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frank Black|url=http://www.frankblack.net/bio/?page=frank|access-date=20 June 2013}}</ref>  He spent 1985 working in a warehouse, "managing buttons on [[teddy bear]]s," composing songs on his [[acoustic guitar]], and writing lyrics on the [[MBTA subway|subway]].<ref name="fgpg11" /> In January 1986, Thompson formed the Pixies with Santiago. Bassist [[Kim Deal]] was recruited a week later via a classified advertisement placed in a Boston paper, which requested a bassist "into [[Hüsker Dü]] and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]." Drummer [[David Lovering]] was later hired on recommendation from Deal's husband.<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio" /><ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 18</ref>

In 1987, the Pixies released an 18-track [[Demo (music)|demo tape]], commonly referred to as ''[[Pixies (EP)|The Purple Tape]]''. Thompson's father assisted the band financially, lending $1,000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father "wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, so I think he was doing his best to make up for lost time."<ref>Sisario 2006. p. 16</ref> ''The Purple Tape'' led to a recording contract with the English independent record label [[4AD]].<ref name="officialprofile" /> For the release of the mini album ''[[Come On Pilgrim]]'', Thompson adopted the alias "Black Francis", a name inspired by his father: "he had been saving that name in case he had another son."<ref>Sisario 2006. p. 18</ref>

In 1988, the Pixies recorded their debut album ''[[Surfer Rosa]]''. Thompson wrote and sang on all the tracks, with the exception of the single "[[Gigantic (song)|Gigantic]]," which was co-written and sung by Deal. To support the album, the band undertook a European tour, during which Thompson met [[Eric Drew Feldman]],<ref>Feldman was a veteran of [[Experimental rock|avant-rock]] bands [[Pere Ubu (band)|Pere Ubu]], [[Captain Beefheart]]'s Magic Band, and [[The Residents]].</ref> a later collaborator on Pixies and solo albums.

The band reconvened in 1990, and recorded two further albums: 1990's ''[[Bossanova (Pixies album)|Bossanova]]'' and 1991's ''[[Trompe le Monde]]''; the latter was Thompson's first collaboration with Feldman. The later Pixies albums were characterized by Feldman's increasing influence on the band's output, as well as a focus on [[science fiction themes]], including [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s and [[UFOs]].<ref>Francis, Black. Lyrics. "[http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=43099 Planet of Sound]." (''[[Trompe le Monde]]''). [[Gramophone record|LP]]. [[4AD Records|4AD]] 1991.</ref> These themes would continue to be explored throughout his early solo work. ''Trompe le Monde'' includes the song "U-Mass," which was written about the university he attended as a youth, and due to the keyboard part played by Feldman, signified a move away from the band's alternative rock sound. Although Deal had contributed on the songs "Gigantic" (from ''Surfer Rosa'') and "Silver" (from ''Doolittle''), from ''Bossanova'' on, Thompson wrote all the band's original material. This contributed to the increasing tension between him and Deal,<ref name="4adpage3" /> and the Pixies broke up in 1992; this was not publicly announced until early 1993.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 173</ref>

===Early solo career===
While the Pixies' 1991 album ''Trompe le Monde'' was being recorded, Thompson had discussions with the album's producer, [[Gil Norton]], about a possible solo record.<ref>Gil Norton was the producer of the Pixies' records from ''Doolittle'' onwards.</ref> He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a [[Cover version|cover album]]. However, by the time Thompson visited a recording studio again in 1992, he had "plenty of tunes and musical scraps."<ref name="4adbio">{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/frankblack/profile/ | title=4AD&nbsp;— Frank Black | access-date=2006-11-29 | author=4AD | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123213948/http://www.4ad.com/frankblack/profile/ | archive-date=November 23, 2006 | url-status=dead}}</ref>

He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, [[The Beach Boys]]' "[[Hang On to Your Ego]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/frankblack/albums/album/112901/review/5942903/frank_black |title=Rolling Stone: Frank Black: Frank Black : Music Reviews |access-date=2006-11-29 |work=Rolling Stone |date=April 1, 1993 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213014007/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/frankblack/albums/album/112901/review/5942903/frank_black |archive-date=February 13, 2007 }}</ref> Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/albums/mbmembers/feldman.htm |title=The Captain Beefheart Radar Station&nbsp;— Eric Drew Feldman Discography |access-date=2006-11-29 |quote=Eric Drew Feldman (bass, keyboards, synthetics) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028173927/http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/albums/mbmembers/feldman.htm |archive-date=October 28, 2006 }}</ref> with Santiago featuring on lead guitar<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 187–8</ref> and [[Nick Vincent (musician)|Nick Vincent]] on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name "Frank Black" (inverting his old persona "Black Francis") and released the results as ''[[Frank Black (album)|Frank Black]]'' in March 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4ad.com/year/1993/releases/frankblack-0/ |title=4AD – 1993 Releases&nbsp;— Frank Black |access-date=2007-01-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706214240/http://4ad.com/year/1993/releases/frankblack-0/ |archive-date=July 6, 2006 }}</ref> ''Frank Black'' was characterized by a focus on [[UFO]]s and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in "I Heard Ramona Sing", a song about the [[Ramones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4ad.com/frankblack/profile/?page=2 |title=4AD&nbsp;— Frank Black (page 2) |access-date=2006-12-02 |publisher=4AD |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512184836/http://www.4ad.com/frankblack/profile/?page=2 |archive-date=May 12, 2006 }}</ref> The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums ''Bossanova'' and ''Trompe le Monde''. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with ''Trompe le Monde'', "but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did."<ref name="pg188">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 188</ref>

The following year, Black released his second solo record, a 22-song double album entitled ''[[Teenager of the Year (album)|Teenager of the Year]]''.<ref>Phares, Heather. "[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,197813,00.html Frank Black: Teenager of the Year]". Allmusic. Retrieved on 2006-12-12.</ref> ''Teenager'' included the song "Headache" ({{audio|FrankBlack-Headache.ogg|sample}}), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as "irresistible [[pop music|pop]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guypetersreviews.com/frankblack.php |title=Frank Black Album Reviews |access-date=2007-01-05 |author=Guy Peters |publisher=Guy's Music Review Site |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209055940/http://www.guypetersreviews.com/frankblack.php |archive-date=December 9, 2006 }}</ref> The production of ''Teenager of the Year'' was markedly different from ''Frank Black''; in the previous album, [[MIDI]] templates were used when writing songs, but in ''Teenager'', Black showed individual parts to band members, the core of which included drummer Vincent and [[Lyle Workman]] on lead guitar. Feldman noted that Thompson's songwriting became "a lot more spontaneous" while recording the album.<ref name="pg188" /> Thompson had begun to stray from his style with the Pixies, writing songs that covered a variety of genres and topics, and his new-found method of recording was closer to later albums than that of ''Frank Black'' and ''Trompe le Monde''.

Both ''Frank Black'' and ''Teenager of the Year'' were critically well received, although they enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels [[4AD]] and [[Elektra Records|Elektra]].<ref name="allmusicbio">{{cite web | author = Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | title = Frank Black / Artist [Full] Biography | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/frank-black-mn0000167287/biography | access-date=2019-05-30 | work = allmusic.com}}</ref> In 1996, he released ''[[The Cult of Ray]]'' on [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]; the album marked a turn away from the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few [[overdub]]s. His band for this album featured sole ''Teenager'' holdover [[Lyle Workman]] on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ubl.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,225711,00.html |title=Frank Black: The Cult of Ray |access-date=2007-01-02 |author=ArtistDirect |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208115237/http://ubl.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0%2C%2C225711%2C00.html |archive-date=December 8, 2008 }}</ref><ref>Both had previously played in the [[jangle pop]] band [[Miracle Legion]].</ref> Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods for the next several years.

===Frank Black and the Catholics===
Thompson dubbed his new band "Frank Black and the Catholics," and recorded their [[Frank Black and the Catholics (album)|eponymous first album]] in 1997. Recorded live-to-two-track initially as merely a demo, he was so pleased with the results that he decided to release the sessions with no further production.<ref name="cathreview">{{cite web | url=http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxvi/10.23.98/ae/record3.html | title=Black's first holy communion for post-Pixies fans | access-date=2006-10-28 | author=McGarry, Daniel | publisher=The Yale Herald | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917072626/http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxvi/10.23.98/ae/record3.html | archive-date=September 17, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The album was delayed for over a year by conflicts at American, both internal and over its production,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://quimby.gnus.org/html/interview/BlackFrank.article.battle.html | title=A Frank Black internet radio show!?!? | access-date=2006-10-23 | date=August 10, 1997 | author=Rutherford, Eric}}</ref> and was ultimately released in late 1998 by [[SpinArt Records]] in the US.

He would continue to eschew [[multi-track recording]] for the live-to-two-track technique for all subsequent releases under the group name. Live-to-two-track recording precludes the use of overdubs to correct errors or add texture; all takes are recorded continuously, and mixing is done "on the fly." On later albums, he incorporated more musicians into the sessions to allow for more varied instrumental textures. Explaining his rationale behind the method, he commented:<ref name="freew">{{cite web | url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/november_2002/frank-black.html | title=Frank Black | access-date=2006-10-23 | author=Kilian, Dan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208011113/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/november_2002/frank-black.html | archive-date=December 8, 2006 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

By this time, while dismissing the possibility of a Pixies reunion, Thompson had begun to incorporate an increasing number of the band's songs into Catholics concerts, as well as including Santiago in his solo work again.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.popmatters.com/music/concerts/b/black-frank.shtml | title=Frank Black and Catholics&nbsp;– Popmatters Concert Review | access-date=2006-12-11 | author=Thil, Scott | date=May 24, 2001}}</ref> Black and the Catholics continued to release records; two separate albums, ''[[Black Letter Days]]'' and ''[[Devil's Workshop]]'', were released simultaneously in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/blackfrankandthecatholics/blackletterdays/ | title=Frank Black and the Catholics | access-date=2006-12-11}}</ref> ''Devil's Workshop'' included the song "Velvety" ({{audio|FrankBlack-Velvety.ogg|sample}}), a version of the Pixies song "Velvety Instrumental Version" (written by Black as a teenager) with lyrics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/november_2002/frank-black.html | title=Frank Black | access-date=2006-12-13 | author=Kilian, Dan | publisher=Free Williamsburg | quote=It was an instrumental before.

A sixth album with the Catholics, ''[[Show Me Your Tears]]'', was released in 2003. ''Show Me Your Tears<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' title and many of the songs in it were inspired by Thompson's recent divorce and entry into [[psychotherapy|therapy]].<ref name="allmusicbio" />

===Pixies reunion, Nashville and the return of Black Francis===
In late 2003, following long-standing rumors, an official announcement was made that the Pixies were rehearsing for a reunion tour. The band played publicly for the first time in 12 years in April 2004, and went on to tour extensively throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe in the same year. They also recorded one of Deal's compositions, "[[Bam Thwok]]," which was released on the [[iTunes Music Store]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/pixies/17179 | title=New Pixies Song on iTunes | access-date=2006-09-03 |work=NME}}</ref> ''[[Frank Black Francis (album)|Frank Black Francis]]'', a double album bridging the gap between his two personas, was released to coincide with the Pixies reunion tour. The first disc consisted of solo demos of Pixies songs recorded the day before ''The Purple Tape'' was recorded, and the second contained studio collaborations, again of Pixies songs, with [[David Thomas and Two Pale Boys|Two Pale Boys]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,3068310,00.html | title=Frank Black: Frank Black Francis | access-date=2006-12-07 | author=Phares, Heather | author2=Allmusic}}</ref>

Also in 2004, Thompson began to collaborate with a group of [[Nashville]] [[session musician]]s, including [[Steve Cropper]], [[Spooner Oldham]], [[Reggie Young]], and [[Anton Fig]], as well as producer [[Jon Tiven]]. In July 2005, the collective released ''[[Honeycomb (album)|Honeycomb]]'' under the Frank Black name, to generally favorable reviews. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described the album as "spare, graceful, [and] in the pocket," while ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' noted it as "One of [Thompson's] finest hours."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/blackfrank/honeycomb?q=frank%20black | title=Frank Black: Honeycomb (2005): Reviews | access-date=2006-10-23}}</ref> A second volume of Nashville sessions, a double album entitled ''[[Fast Man Raider Man]]'', was released in June 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/59453/frank-black-fashions-double-album | title=Frank Black Fashions Double Album | access-date=2006-11-18 | author=Cohen, Jonathan.

Thompson continued to tour with the Pixies through 2005 and 2006. Though the Catholics were effectively defunct, they released two separate albums of [[B-side]]s and rarities, ''Snake Oil'' and ''One More Road for the Hit'', on [[iTunes]], with an eye towards a future CD release. Thompson was also working on more new solo material with Feldman in the first part of 2006, some of which they performed live. In the fall of 2006, Thompson began his first solo tour since 2003, taking Feldman, Billy Block, and [[Duane Jarvis]] along as his backing band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/Frank_Black_to_launch_fall_tour_with_new_band-10509.html |title=Frank Black Tour Dates: Frank Black to launch fall tour with new band |access-date=2006-12-06 |author=Madison, Tjames |date=August 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718033845/http://www.livedaily.com/news/Frank_Black_to_launch_fall_tour_with_new_band-10509.html |archive-date=July 18, 2007 }}</ref> In October 2006, Thompson announced plans for the Pixies to start rehearsing and recording a new album in January 2007, but it is believed that no recording took place because of the reluctance of another member of the Pixies to commit to the project.<ref name="nmepixies" /> In December 2006, he released the compilation ''Christmass'' album; a collection of new studio tracks, hotel room sessions, and live acoustic recordings from a solo tour the previous summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/42320/frank-black-wishes-you-a-merry-christmass |title=Frank Black Wishes You A Merry Christmass |access-date=2009-05-31 |date=December 6, 2006 |author=Chartattack.com staff |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607154226/http://www.chartattack.com/news/42320/frank-black-wishes-you-a-merry-christmass |archive-date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref>

A Frank Black "best of" compilation, ''[[Frank Black 93-03]]'', was released in June 2007. Concurrently with that release, Thompson undertook a European tour with a new band, featuring Salem's Guards of Metropolis members Jason Carter and Charles Normal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardsofmetropolis.com |title=Guards of Metropolis Website |publisher=Guardsofmetropolis.com |access-date=2010-10-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811072037/http://www.guardsofmetropolis.com/ |archive-date=August 11, 2010 }}</ref> as well as bassist Ding Archer. For this tour, Thompson eschewed his usual rhythm guitar role and performed solely as a frontman and singer. In September 2007, a new album entitled ''[[Bluefinger]]'' was released under his former stage name of Black Francis. For this album, he was inspired by the life and works of [[Herman Brood]], a Dutch musician and artist. He also released a new "mini-album" entitled ''[[Svn Fngrs]]'' as Black Francis in March 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beardedmagazine.co.uk/viewarticle.php?id=101 |title=When the country is in the brown, independent music gets BEARDED |publisher=Bearded Magazine |access-date=2010-10-14 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In February 2008, Thompson was taken away by the [[Garda Síochána|Irish police]] in Dublin, Ireland, after staging an impromptu "precore" acoustic solo gig at [[St. Stephen's Green]]. He was later released and performed that night in Vicar Street as planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/0211/blackf.html |title=RTÉ.ie Entertainment: Gardaí halt free Dublin gig by Pixies frontman |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date=February 11, 2008 |access-date=2010-10-14}}</ref> However, a similar event planned for London was prevented by police and had to be re-arranged for a small indoor venue.

In 2008, Black produced [[Art Brut]]'s third album, ''[[Art Brut vs. Satan]]'', which was released the following year. Black gave several joint interviews with frontman [[Eddie Argos]] about the album, and Art Brut supported the Pixies at their 2009 [[Brixton Academy]] show.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/pixies/47525 | title=Pixies announce support for upcoming London shows | access-date=2011-03-03}}</ref> In 2010, Black worked with the group a second time on their album ''[[Brilliant!

Black Francis released ''[[NonStopErotik]]'' in March 2010 and contributed the song "I Heard Ramona Sing" to the soundtrack for the film ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]'' released in August 2010.

In the fall of 2010 in Nashville, Thompson recorded an album of new songs written and performed with collaborator [[Reid Paley]], as [[Paley & Francis]] (Reid Paley & Black Francis). The debut [[Paley & Francis]] album (also titled [[Paley & Francis (Paley & Francis album)|''Paley & Francis'']]) was produced by [[Jon Tiven]], and features Reid Paley and Black Francis on guitars and vocals, accompanied by [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section|Muscle Shoals]] legends [[Spooner Oldham]] on piano and [[David Hood]] on bass. The album was released in October 2011 on [[Sonic Unyon]] in North America, and on [[Cooking Vinyl]] in the UK & Europe.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2011/10/reid-paley-francis/|title=Reid Paley & Black Francis: Paley & Francis|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|date=October 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/10/album-review-paley-francis-paley-and-francis/|title=Album Review: Paley & Francis&nbsp;– Paley and Francis|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=October 18, 2011}}</ref>

Paley & Francis debuted live in early September 2011 with club performances in Albany NY, Buffalo NY, and Hamilton, Ontario, and as one of the headliners of the [[Supercrawl]] Festival. The band for these performances consisted of Reid Paley and Black Francis on guitars and vocals, [[Eric Eble]] on bass, and [[Dave Varriale]] on drums. The pair toured again from February 8 to 22, 2013, with the shows including solo performances by each artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/black-francis-t/ |title=Black Francis touring with Reid Paley in February (dates) |author=Brooklynvegan.com |date=January 28, 2013}}</ref>

Black Francis contributed, in 2011, to the [[Ray Davies]] album of collaborations, "See My Friends," with his cover of the [[Kinks]] tune "This Is Where I Belong."

Black Francis performed at The Coach House Concert Hall in [[San Juan Capistrano, California]], on March 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Black Francis: 22 March 2013 - San Juan Capistrano, CA|first=J.C.|last=Maçek III|date=2013-04-03|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/169812-black-francis-22-march-2013-san-juan-capistrano-ca/}}</ref> The Pixies, minus original bassist Kim Deal, reunited for a United States and world tour in 2014 and have subsequently released three additional studio albums: ''[[Indie Cindy]]'' (2014), ''[[Head Carrier]]'' (2016) and ''[[Beneath the Eyrie]]'' (2019).

==Musical style==
[[File:The Pixies at Pohoda music festival 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|Thompson's singing style was instrumental in creating the sound of Pixies.]]
{{See also|Pixies (band)#Style|l1=Pixies' style}} <!-- Pixies' musical style looks nicer than Pixies (band)#Musical style -->

Over the course of his career, Thompson's musical style has grown to encompass a large number of genres; however, he is considered to produce rock or alternative rock compositions.<ref>{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p27207|pure_url=yes}} | title=allmusic ((( Frank Black > Overview ))) | access-date=2006-12-13 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | work=Allmusic}}</ref> Whereas songs such as "Here Comes Your Man" (''Doolittle''), "Velvety" (''Devil's Workshop'') and "Headache" (''Teenager of the Year'') expose a more [[Soft rock|light rock]] side, others such as "Something Against You" (''Surfer Rosa'') and "Thalassocracy" (''Teenager of the Year'') hint to a more [[Hard rock|heavy rock]] influence in his material. A strong [[country music]] influence is also increasingly evident in his style, most notably in his Nashville albums, ''Honeycomb'' and ''Fast Man Raider Man''.

Thompson has said that he acquired his vocal style as a teenager, when a [[Thai people|Thai]] neighbor asked him to sing "[[Oh! Darling]]" by [[The Beatles]] (from their album ''[[Abbey Road]]'') and to "Scream it like you hate that bitch!"<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 6</ref> Thompson's powerful screams were a signature of Pixies albums, along with the band's typical song structure of quietly paced [[Verse-chorus form|verses]] followed by thundering [[refrain|chorus]] lines and repetitive guitar [[staccato]].<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio" />

===Influences===
Thompson has drawn influence from a number of [[Music genre|musical genres]]. As a teenager, he mostly listened to 1960s folk and religious music, including the Christian singer-songwriter [[Larry Norman]]. For playing on his junior high baseball team, he was given [[Leon Russell]]'s [[Leon Russell (album)|1970 debut album]], which he says influenced some of his vocalizing. Later in high school and in college, he discovered [[Punk rock|punk music]] ([[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]), along with bands from other genres, such as the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[The Cars]] and the obscure [[Angst (American band)|Angst]]. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, he listened to [[Hüsker Dü]]'s ''[[Zen Arcade]]'', ''[[The Spotlight Kid]]'' by [[Captain Beefheart]], and ''I'm Sick of You'', an [[Iggy Pop]] bootleg.<ref name="fgpg11"/> Thompson was also greatly influenced by the [[The Beatles (album)|Beatles self-titled 1968 release]] with regards to the experimental nature of his compositions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/beatles-white-album-alt-rock-2619809240.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1 |title=Bleached: The Beatles' White Album Effect on the US Alt-rock Explosion of 1988-95 |last=Mason |first=Adam |date=November 19, 2018 |website=Pop Matters |publisher=Pop Matters |access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref>

Thompson's lyrics have also featured references to the Bible, especially in his career with the Pixies; most notably in the [[incest]]uous tale of [[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]] in "Nimrod's Son", the stories of [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]] and [[Bathsheba]] in "Dead", [[Samson]] in "Gouge Away" and references to the [[Tower of Babel]] in songs such as "Build High" and "Old Black Dawning".<ref name="bcinterview">{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2002/09/09/202154.php |title=The Blogcritics Frank Black Interview Is Here! |access-date=2006-12-15 |author=Olsen, Eric |date=September 9, 2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090715081106/http://blogcritics.org/music/article/the-blogcritics-frank-black-interview-is/ |archive-date=July 15, 2009 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> He cited [[surrealism|surrealist]] films ''[[Eraserhead]]'' and ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (as mentioned in "In Heaven" and "Debaser" respectively) as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dag.wieers.com/debaser/lyrics/Debaser.php | title=Pixies&nbsp;– Debaser | access-date=2006-10-01}}</ref> He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in the Pixies' ''Doolittle''), saying he "didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels", but found it easier to watch 20-minute films.<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 29</ref>

===Songwriting and lyrics===
During his stay in Puerto Rico, Thompson acquired a fairly fluent, although informal and at times incorrect, use of Spanish, which he has continued throughout his career. Several early Pixies songs, including "Isla de Encanta" and "Vamos", reference his experiences in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and the lyrics are often heavily seasoned with the island's slang. The island's influence in his work is most notable in the song "Isla De Encanta", named after the island's [[motto]], "Isla Del Encanto". Other Pixies songs drawn from his experiences there include "Vamos" (''[[Come On Pilgrim]]''), "Oh My Golly!", "[[Where Is My Mind?]]" (''[[Surfer Rosa]]''), "[[Crackity Jones]]" (''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'') and the B-side "Bailey's Walk". Several of his songs contain Spanish lyrics, most notably in the Pixies' first album, ''Come On Pilgrim'', and a Spanish translation of "Evil Hearted You" by [[The Yardbirds]].<ref>Francis, Black. Lyrics. "[http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=70947 Evil Hearted You (Corazon De Diablo)]".</ref> From his later works with the Pixies onwards, his use of Spanish drifted westward, reflecting places and aspects of the state of California and its culture.<ref name="freew" />

Thompson's lyrics are noted for their obscure references to off-beat topics such as [[outer space]], [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s, and [[The Three Stooges]]—the last of these being the subject of "Two Reelers", a song from ''Teenager of the Year''.<ref name="pg188" /> Lyrics with a focus on science fiction were particularly prominent on the later Pixies records, as well as his early solo albums.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.25.96/frank-black-9617.html | title=Metroactive Music > Frank Black | access-date=2006-12-15 | author=Baxter, Nicky | date=April 25, 1996}}</ref> With the Catholics, his lyrics have tended towards historical topics; for example, the song "St. Francis Dam Disaster" (from ''Dog in the Sand'') details the catastrophic collapse of the [[St. Francis Dam]] near Los Angeles in March 1928,<ref name="bcinterview" /> and the ''All My Ghosts'' [[Extended play|EP]] featured an account of the [[1860 Wiyot Massacre|Humboldt County Massacre]] of [[Wiyot people|Wiyot]] Indians in 1860 near [[Eureka, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frankblack.net/songs/db.asp?mode=release-song-details&releaseID=749&songID=136 |title=FrankBlack.Net Discopedia&nbsp;– Humboldt County Massacre |access-date=2007-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208205314/http://www.frankblack.net/songs/db.asp?mode=release-song-details&releaseID=749&songID=136 |archive-date=December 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Television appearances and videos==

Thompson has appeared on a range of television shows solo and as part of the Pixies, ranging from ''[[120 Minutes]]'' and ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/late-show-with-david-letterman/show-2286/episode/384246/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;65 | title=Late Show with David Letterman: Show #2286 | access-date=2007-04-25 | publisher=TV.com}}</ref> to ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]'' in the UK.<ref name="pixiesvideos">{{cite web | url=http://www.broszkowski.com/tv/pixies/pixiesvideodownload.html | title=Download Obscure Pixies TV appearances | access-date=2006-11-06 | author=Broszkowski, Matthew | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104121014/http://broszkowski.com/tv/pixies/pixiesvideodownload.html | archive-date=November 4, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

As part of the Pixies, he was reluctant to film music videos for singles. [[Elektra Records]]' Peter Lubin commented that "to get videos out of them was a major&nbsp;... undertaking and it only got worse over time", citing the fact that Thompson refused to [[lip-sync]];<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 140</ref> the video for "[[Here Comes Your Man]]" features Thompson and Deal opening their mouths as the vocals are being heard, mocking the practice.

In his early solo career as Frank Black, his videos were more professional; he became more willing to take part in them. "Los Angeles" is an example; the video features Thompson riding across a desert on a [[hovercraft]]. [[They Might Be Giants]]' [[John Flansburgh]], who directed the "Los Angeles" video, later commented on the change in Black's attitude to music videos:<ref name="pg188" />

{{Blockquote|I think the Pixies had made enough anti-videos that Charles was ready to do things that were more visually hopped up. The "Los Angeles" video that we did, the last minute and a half of the song is this open field of grey over which hovercrafts are floating. It's about as tripped up as any video I've ever been involved in, and it was also realizing a dream of Charles', getting him in a hovercraft.}}

Thompson has released few music videos since leaving 4AD, one being a low-budget video in Germany for ''Dog in the Sand''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Robert Onion". The last widely released video produced for his solo material was for "Men in Black", from ''Cult of Ray''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musictoday.com/interact/chat/fblack.asp |title=Musictoday&nbsp;— Frank Black online chat |access-date=2007-01-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218015226/http://www.musictoday.com/interact/chat/fblack.asp |archive-date=February 18, 2006 }}</ref><!-- A more reliable source would be better -->

In 2013, Thompson appeared in a [http://vimeo.com/68814648 video] promoting [[McSweeney's]] children's book ''Lost Sloth''.
