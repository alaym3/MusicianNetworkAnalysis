'''Le Tigre''' (French for "The Tiger", pronounced {{IPAc-en|pron|l|ə|ˈ|t|iː|ɡ|r|ə}}) was an American [[electronic rock]] band formed by [[Kathleen Hanna]] (of [[Bikini Kill]]), [[Johanna Fateman]] and [[Sadie Benning]] in 1998 in New York City. Benning left in 2001 and was replaced by [[JD Samson]] for the rest of the group's existence. Le Tigre are known for their [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] lyrics that often dealt with issues of [[feminism]] and the [[LGBT community]]. They mixed punk's directness and politics with playful samples, eclectic pop, and [[lo-fi (audio)|lo-fi]] electronics. The group also added multimedia and performance art elements to their live shows, which often featured support from like-minded acts such as [[The Need]].<ref>5 “Music for Everyone.” Contact - Spotify, www.spotify.com/.</ref>

==History==
Le Tigre were initially envisioned as a live backup band for Hanna's solo project [[Julie Ruin]]. They took their name from one of many hypothetical bands made up by Hanna circa 1994. After Benning left the band, Samson filled in for them during live performances and eventually became an official member. Samson had previously worked with the band as a roadie and the operator of the band's slideshow during the few live performances before Benning's departure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.letigreworld.com/sweepstakes/html_site/fact/fact.html|title=Just the Facts Ma'am}}</ref>
