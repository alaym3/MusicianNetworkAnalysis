Thorogood's demo ''Better Than the Rest'' was recorded in 1974, but was not released until 1979. His major recording debut came with the album ''[[George Thorogood and the Destroyers (album)|George Thorogood and the Destroyers]],'' which was released in 1977. In 1978, Thorogood released his next album with the Destroyers titled ''[[Move It On Over (album)|Move It on Over]]'', which included a remake of [[Hank Williams]]' "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]". He followed those recordings in 1979 with "Please Set a Date" and a reworking of the [[Bo Diddley]] song "[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love]]", both released in 1979. The band's early success contributed to the rise of folk label [[Rounder Records]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Never-Ending Revival |author=Scully, Michael F. |year=2008 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=107}}</ref>

During the late 1970s, Thorogood and his band were based in [[Boston]]. He was friends with [[Jimmy Thackery]] of the Washington, D.C.-based blues band, [[The Nighthawks]]. While touring in the 1970s, the Destroyers and the Nighthawks were playing shows in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] at venues across the street from each other. The Destroyers were engaged at the [[The Cellar Door|Cellar Door]] and the Nighthawks at Desperados. At midnight, while both bands played [[Elmore James]]' "[[Madison Blues]]" in the same key, Thorogood and Thackery left their clubs, met in the middle of M Street, exchanged guitar patch cords and went on to play with the opposite band in the other club.<ref>''Washington Post'' Op Ed May 15, 1993 – "M Street Shuffle" – fact-checked correction to Weekend section feature "Tune Town"; May 7, 1993</ref> The connection with the Nighthawks was extended further when Nighthawks bass player Jan Zukowski supported Thorogood's set with [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Albert Collins]] at the [[Live Aid]] concert in Philadelphia, PA, on July 13, 1985.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Thorogood gained his first mainstream exposure as a support act for [[the Rolling Stones]] during their 1981 U.S. tour.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1177/8}}</ref> He was also the featured musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (Season 8, Episode 2) on the October 2, 1982, broadcast.

In addition, he played Washington, D.C. on the same day that he performed a show in Maryland, thereby playing 51 shows in 50 days.[[File:George Thorogood MMP Music Award.jpg|thumb|George Thorogood receives the MMP Music Award and Hall of Fame Honors with William Lewis IV, Alexis Paige, Commander Joseph W.

With his contract with Rounder Records expiring, Thorogood signed with [[EMI America Records]] and, in 1982, released the single "[[Bad to the Bone]]" and [[Bad to the Bone (George Thorogood & The Destroyers album)|an album of the same name]] that went [[gold record|gold]].

There aren't many of us but you know, that's me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-george-thorogood-discusses-his-new-album-2120-south-michigan-ave |title=Interview: George Thorogood Discusses His New Album, '2120 South Michigan Ave.' |work=Guitar World |date=June 20, 2011 |access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref>
