'''David Darnell Brown''' (born March 15, 1981),<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p440844|pure_url=yes}}|title=Young Buck: Biography|last=Jeffries|first=David|publisher=allmusic|access-date=December 29, 2009}}</ref> best known by his stage name '''Young Buck''', is an American rapper. As a music executive, he heads his own record label, [[Cashville Records]], and was a member of the former hip hop group [[G-Unit]].

==Early life==
Brown was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Around the age of 12, he began rapping. A few years later, he performed for [[Birdman (rapper)|Brian "Baby" Williams]], co-founder of [[Cash Money Records|Cash Money]].<ref name="allmusic" />

==Music career==
Young Buck joined Cash Money Records in 1997 but left for [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]]'s UTP Records in 2000.<ref name="allhiphop1">{{cite web |url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2008/01/27/19198560.aspx |title=AHH Stray News: Young Buck Back With Cash Money? |publisher=AllHipHop.com |first=Ace |last=Cannon |date=January 27, 2008 |access-date=March 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129095631/https://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2008/01/27/19198560.aspx |archive-date=2008-01-29}}</ref> He released two albums with UTP, ''[[Born to Be a Thug]]'' and ''[[The Compilation (UTP album)|The Compilation]]'', before leaving the label in 2003 to join 50 Cent's record label G-Unit Records. 

His first recording with G-Unit Records was on rap group G-Unit's 2003 album ''[[Beg for Mercy (G-Unit album)|Beg for Mercy]]''. He replaced G-Unit member [[Tony Yayo]] who had been jailed on gun possession charges after recording only two songs for the album. 

His G-Unit Records debut album ''[[Straight Outta Cashville]]'' was released on August 24, 2004. The album's title alludes to the [[N.W.A]] album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' and is a [[neologism]] for [[Nashville]] (his hometown). The album produced three singles: "[[Let Me In (Young Buck song)|Let Me In]]", "[[Shorty Wanna Ride]]", and "Look at Me Now". The album received little promotion after November. Young Buck was arrested for assault after the [[Young Buck#VIBE Awards stabbing|VIBE award incident]] and wasn't able to promote the album for four months until the case was dropped. The album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and has since been certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the RIAA.<ref name="autogenerated2007">[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH Searchable Database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |date=June 26, 2007 }}. RIAA. Accessed August 24, 2007.</ref> His second solo album ''[[Buck The World]]'' followed in 2007.

He joined the rest of the label's roster on the 2005 collaboration album ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (soundtrack)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]''.

On June 1, 2014, Young Buck was seen at the Summer Jam Concert with 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, and Tony Yayo. It was confirmed later that the group had reformed, adding [[Kidd Kidd]] as a new member. The group released their debut EP ''[[The Beauty of Independence]]'' on August 25, 2014. Young Buck is again making new music with G-Unit and released his mixtape ''[[Before The Beast]]'' which contains seven songs featuring Kidd Kidd, [[Lil Boosie]], Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks and additional artists. After releasing the mixtape, he released G-unit's second EP ''[[The Beast Is G-Unit]],'' which sold approximately 20,000 copies in its first week.

==Personal life==
===Shooting===
In 2000, Young Buck was shot multiple times during a home invasion at his home in Nashville. The assailants were in search of narcotics. Buck required a blood transfusion at Vanderbilt hospital as a result of the life-threatening injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/young-buck-nashvilles-multi-platinum-rapper-talks-in-depth-about-his-new-music-the-50-cent-beef-and-the-rap-kingpin-trying-to-choke-off-h/Content?oid=1667666|title=Young Buck, Nashville's multi-platinum rapper, talks in depth about his new music, the 50 Cent beef, and the rap kingpin trying to choke off his career|work=Nashville Scene|access-date=March 19, 2015}}</ref>

===Financial problems===
Brown filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August 2010,<ref>{{cite news | last=Wood | first=E. Thomas | author-link=E.

His bankruptcy lawyer later told ''[[The City Paper]]'' that he was planning to sue Curtis Jackson ([[50 Cent]]) and other parties over the record contract dispute.<ref>{{cite news | last=Wood | first=E.

The IRS made plans to auction off Young Buck's seized property on October 28, 2010,<ref>{{cite news| last=Haas | first=Brian| author-link=Brian Haas | url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101014/NEWS03/101014046/IRS-to-auction-off-rapper-Young-Buck-s-property-on-Oct-28| title=IRS to auction off rapper Young Buck's property on Oct. 28 | publisher=[[The Tennessean]] Retrieved on October 14, 2010 | date=October 14, 2010}}</ref> but his legal counsel filed suit to halt the sale, while simultaneously re-filing a revised bankruptcy petition that no longer referenced a $5 million legal claim against 50 Cent and other parties associated with G Unit.<ref>{{cite news| last=Wood | first=E. Thomas | author-link=E.

In the lawsuit,<ref>[http://business.nashvillepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brown_v_IRS-USBC-22Oct2010-APcplt.pdf National post PDF re lawsuit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163057/http://business.nashvillepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brown_v_IRS-USBC-22Oct2010-APcplt.pdf |date=April 25, 2012 }}</ref> Young Buck said the studio equipment taken in the raid was "directly tied to" his "ability to generate income in order to reorganize the estate." He stated that the seizure of property that belonged to his children had "created great stress in the home" and "within the common law marriage of the debtor plaintiff." He told the court he needed to get back the property belonging to the family.

Young Buck's attorney was able to convince the court that he would be selling real estate worth $638,500 to begin paying the back taxes due. At a hearing on October 26, 2010, plans for the IRS auction were at least temporarily stopped. Young Buck announced the outcome with a [[Twitter#Tweets|tweet]].

Young Buck was under Chapter 7, Young Buck's assets were to be sold and distributed among his creditors.<ref>{{cite news| last=Palank | first=Jacqueline | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2011/10/10/young-buck-faces-liquidation/| title=Young Buck Faces Liquidation. | publisher=The Wall Street Journal Retrieved on October 10, 2010 | date=October 10, 2010}}</ref>

On July 25 and 26, a [[public auction]] was held at the estate that Young Buck owns. Property to be sold includes watches, a 50 Cent plaque, artwork, a soda machine, his studio equipment, and more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/auctions/irs/natn_anti_6125.htm |title=IRS Auction - Sales Ad for Nashville, TN |publisher=Treasury.gov |date=July 26, 2012 |access-date=December 12, 2012}}</ref>

===Drive-by shooting===
Early Sunday morning on March 4, 2012, Young Buck was targeted in a drive-by shooting. According to Nashville police, via [[WSMV-TV]] Channel 4, at approximately 3:30 am, a white [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] crept past the rapper's SUV and opened fire, hitting the vehicle 11 times, including a female passenger. Buck, who was back in his hometown to work on new music, was not injured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/502903/young-buck-survives-drive-by-shooting |title=Young Buck Survives Drive-By Shooting - The Juice |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref>

After a couple of days of silence, Buck took to his Twitter to address the situation. "We all go through things in life", he tweeted. "The things I'm experiencing are Truly making me a Better and Stronger man. #GodisGood."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2012/03/update-young-buck-drive-by-shooting-still-under-investigation/ |title=UPDATE: Young Buck Drive-By Shooting Still Under Investigation |publisher=Xxlmag.Com |date=March 12, 2012 |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2012/03/04/young-buck-escapes-drive-by-shooting-unscathed/ |title=Young Buck Escapes Drive-By Shooting Unscathed |publisher=Rapfix.mtv.com |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref>

===Legal issues===
After an IRS raid on Buck's Nashville home in 2010, authorities found a .40 caliber [[Glock 22]] as well as ammunition. The raid followed reports that the rapper had an outstanding $300,000 tax debt, and because he's a convicted felon, Buck is prohibited from possessing any firearms. Back in 2005, he pleaded no contest to assault with a chance to produce bodily injury after he stabbed a man while trying to defend [[Dr. Dre]] at the 2004 Vibe Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685601/young-buck-18-months-prison.jhtml |title=Young Buck Facing 18 Months In Prison |publisher=MTV.Com |date=May 22, 2012 |access-date=May 24, 2012}}</ref>

On July 13, 2012, Buck was sentenced to 18 months in prison on weapon charges, a sentence that he began on August 6, 2012. Until then, Buck had remained at his Nashville home on house arrest with a monitoring bracelet strapped around his ankle. He served his 18 months in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Yazoo City|Yazoo City Low Security Federal Prison]] in Southern Mississippi and was released on October 1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/10/young-buck-gets-out-of-prison/|title=Young Buck Gets Out Of Prison|work=XXL|access-date=March 19, 2015}}</ref>

On July 20, 2016, he sent a threatening text to his ex-girlfriend and showed up and kicked down her door. Buck was arrested on July 21, 2016, for threatening to burn down the ex-girlfriend's apartment. He was released on a $5,000 bond.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theboombox.com/young-buck-arrested-for-threatening-to-burn-down-ex-girlfriends-apartment/ |title=Young Buck arrested for threatening to burn down ex-girlfriend's apartment |last=Howard |first=Jacinta |date=July 22, 2016 |website=[[The Boombox]] |access-date=July 22, 2016}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===VIBE Awards stabbing===
On November 15, 2004, Jimmy James Johnson approached [[Dr. Dre]] at the VIBE Awards and reportedly asked for an autograph before Dr. Dre was about to go on stage. After Dr. Dre declined, Johnson punched him on the back of the head before running towards the nearest exit. A brawl ensued with several uniformed police officers attempting to break up the fight. Chairs were thrown, and it was alleged that Young Buck stabbed Johnson in the chest with a knife.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070427190428/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/youngbuck/articles/story/6845271/buck_pleads_not_guilty "Buck Pleads Not Guilty"].

However, in December 2005, a deal was reportedly struck that would see Young Buck avoid trial.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1517437/20051205/young_buck.jhtml "Young Buck strikes deal with prosecutors in Vibe Awards case"], [[MTV]].com, December 5, 2005</ref>

===The Game===
After [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] was kicked out of [[G-Unit]] allegedly for being disloyal, Young Buck as well as new West Coast G-Unit rapper [[Spider Loc]] who had signed to G-Unit Records in September 2004, called him to task for dissing the group and label. The Game then released a track entitled "300 Bars" which insulted both Spider Loc and Young Buck. Young Buck then released a track called "The Real Bitch Boy", which featured Spider Loc and used a beat from The Game's track, "Where I'm From". In the song, Young Buck talks about how he did not even know The Game when he mentions The Game's name on "[[Poppin' Them Thangs]]". Also, Young Buck talks about The Game being a male stripper and also how [[50 Cent]] helped The Game to be successful with his album ''[[The Documentary]]''.

The feud has continued to escalate, with there being an exchange of many tracks. In February 2007, The Game and Young Buck got into a non-physical altercation at a club, during the [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] in Las Vegas. The last time that they were seen together was when The Game was part of G-Unit.<ref>{{YouTube|FBDL8WCMUb0|Young Buck & Game Altercation 2007}}. YouTube. Accessed July 27, 2007.</ref>

After being dismissed from G-Unit, Young Buck appeared on a remix to The Game's song "[[Game's Pain]]",<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sixshot.com/news/11553/ |title=The Game Does Coastal Remixes Of 'Pain', Preps Mixtape With Young Buck |access-date=July 19, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102253/http://www.sixshot.com/news/11553/ |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as well as appearing in the music video to the song "[[My Life (The Game song)|My Life]]", which featured another former rival, [[Lil Wayne]].<ref name="mylife">[[DJ Skee]] (August 1, 2008) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCFtFySNqAA The Game ft.
