==Biography==
Corb Lund grew up in Southern Alberta living on his family's farm and ranches near [[Taber, Alberta|Taber]], [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] and [[Rosemary, Alberta|Rosemary]].<ref>Newton, Steve. (2008-02-13) [https://www.straight.com/article-132057/albertan-corb-lund-has-provincial-pride Albertan Corb Lund has provincial pride | Georgia Straight]. Straight.com. Retrieved on 2013-03-17.</ref> Lund left his hometown of Taber and moved to [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], where he enrolled in the [[Grant MacEwan College]] to study jazz guitar and bass.

Lund was a founding member of [[The Smalls]]. The band retired in the fall of 2001 but reunited in 2014 for a string of shows, the so-called "Slight Return" tour.<ref>{{cite news|last1=MACPHERS|first1=ALEX J|title=After 13 years, Edmonton's the smalls return to the stage with their innovative fusion of punk, rock, and metal|url=http://www.thesmalls.ca/news/verb-after-13-years-edmontons-the-smalls-return-to-the-stage-with-their-innovative-fusion-of-punk-rock-and-metal/|access-date=10 October 2014|publisher=The Verb|date=10 October 2014}}</ref>

Lund formed his country trio, the Corb Lund Band, in 1995.<ref name="mont">{{cite web|url=http://bozemanmagazine.com/articles/2014/11/01/24143_n-a-74|title=Corb Lund & The Hurtin Albertans|author=Pat Hill|date=2014-11-01|publisher=Bozeman Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005183600/http://bozemanmagazine.com/articles/2014/11/01/24143_n-a-74|archive-date=2017-10-05|access-date=2017-10-05}}</ref> He turned his attention to his own band exclusively when the Smalls broke up in 2001.<ref name="mont" /> The band changed its name to "Corb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans" in 2005<ref name=" mont" /> shortly after guitarist Grant Siemens joined the group, and has been touring and recording under that title ever since.

Lund currently lives in Lethbridge, Alberta, and spends much of his downtime at his family ranch south of Cardston, Alberta.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140814194202/http://www.cbc.ca/beetleroadtrip/blog/entry/corb-lund-performs-on-his-family-ranch-in-the-rocky-mountain-foothills-of-a] </ref>

Much of their time is spent in the [[Canadian Prairies]] and the American southwest.

The band's members are:
*Kurt Ciesla, bass
*Grant "Demon" Siemens, guitar and other strings
*Brady Valgardson, drums

Siemens is the only member who is not Albertan, hailing from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Farmer/drummer Valgardson and Lund are from Taber, Alberta.

The band has toured Europe, where they played the UK Glastonbury Festival, and Australia several times. The group was featured in the movie "Slither" (2006) and were part of the soundtrack to the 2008 documentary, "Holler Back: (Not) Voting in an American Town." They have also provided accompaniment for an NBC special in 2006, on which former world figure skating champion and fellow Albertan, [[Kurt Browning]], performed a routine to "Expectation and the Blues". Their music can also be heard in the ski film "Nine Winters Old."

Lund signed a three-album deal with [[New West Records]] (home of [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and other major artists) in 2009. His first record on New West, ''[[Losin' Lately Gambler]]'', was released in September 2009.

Corb Lund and the Hurtin Albertans played their 2009 single "Long Gone to Saskatchewan" in Ottawa for the 2011 [[Canada Day]] ceremonies in the presence of the newlywed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their Royal visit to Canada.<ref name=royal>{{cite news|last=McCoy|first=Heath|title=Alberta's Corb Lund ready to share his country with royal couple|url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/royal-visit/Alberta+Corb+Lund+ready+share+country+with+royal+couple/5033256/story.html|access-date=19 July 2011|newspaper=[[Calgary Herald]]|date=30 June 2011}}</ref>

It debuted at number 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Canadian Albums Chart]]. In June 2013, the album was longlisted for the [[2013 Polaris Music Prize]].

Corb Lund released ''Things That Can't Be Undone'' in 2015. Lund worked with producer [[Dave Cobb]] (Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell) to explore new styles and sounds on the album.<ref>from an interview on [https://americanamusicshow.com/episode274 Americana Music Show #274], published November 24, 2015.</ref> The album appeared on the !earshot National Top 50 Chart in December that year.<ref>[http://www.earshot-online.com/charts/index.cfm?intChartTypeID=101&dWeekOfID=2015-12-22 "The National Top 50 For the Week Ending: Tuesday, December 22, 2015"].

In March 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund announced that the band had donated the use of the song "Horse Soldier, Horse Soldier" as the theme song of UNICEF Team Canada, the Canadian national [[tent pegging|equestrian skill-at-arms]] team, to support the team's work with UNICEF to provide food and medical care to [[AIDS]] orphans and infants infected with [[HIV]] in the global south.

In March 2010, Lund appeared as part of [[Young Artists for Haiti]] to record a benefit version of [[K'naan]]'s song "[[Wavin' Flag]]".

On July 11, 2010, Lund headlined the Medicine Hat Flood Relief Show, which raised $68,000 for Canadian Red Cross 2010 Flood Relief campaign, which benefits those affected by the disastrous flooding in Southern Alberta.

Lund has supported the Centre for Family Literacy in Edmonton, Alberta since 2010.

Lund co-hosted and headlined the "Fire Aid" benefit concert supporting victims of the Fort McMurray wildfire at Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2721303/fire-aid-concert-for-fort-mcmurray-wildfire-victims-announced/ |title=Fort McMurray wildfire: Nickelback, Corb Lund, Randy Bachman among Fire Aid concert acts |website=Globalnews.ca|access-date=January 18, 2020}}</ref>
