'''Gary Puckett & The Union Gap''' (initially credited as '''The Union Gap featuring Gary Puckett''') was an American [[pop rock]] group active in the late 1960s.  The group, formed by Gary Puckett, Gary 'Mutha' Withem, Dwight Bement, Kerry Chater and Paul Wheatbread, who eventually named it The Union Gap, had its biggest hits with "[[Woman, Woman]]", "[[Young Girl (song)|Young Girl]]", "[[Lady Willpower]]", "[[Over You (Gary Puckett & The Union Gap song)|Over You]]", "[[Don't Give In to Him]], and "[[This Girl Is a Woman Now]]".  The members featured costumes that were based on the [[Union Army]] uniforms worn during the [[American Civil War]].  [[Jerry Fuller]] gave the act a [[recording contract]] with [[Columbia Records]].  The group eventually grew unhappy with doing material written and produced by others, leading them to stop working with Fuller.  The band eventually disbanded, and Puckett went on to do both solo work and collaborations.

==History==
The group's lead singer, Gary Puckett, was born on October 17, 1942, in [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], Minnesota, and grew up in [[Yakima, Washington]] – close to [[Union Gap, Washington|Union Gap]] – and [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], Idaho. He began playing guitar in his teens, graduated from [[Twin Falls High School]] {{nowrap|in 1960,<ref name=argui>{{cite news|url=https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/collection/argonaut/id/3429?_ga=2.130717455.1431491007.1548134055-2101260250.1525192126 |work=Idaho Argonaut |location=(Moscow)|agency=(University of Idaho)|title=Gary Puckett and the Union Gap in concert |date=April 15, 1969 |page=6}}</ref>}} and attended college in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. There, he dropped out of college and played in several local bands before joining the Outcasts, a local [[hard rock]] group, which produced two singles, but they were unsuccessful.

Following the breakup of the Outcasts, Puckett formed a new group he called Gary and the Remarkables, comprising bassist [[Kerry Chater]] (born August 7, 1945, [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada),<ref name="Musician">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003863/Gary-Puckett-and-the-Union-Gap.html |title=Gary Puckett and the Union Gap Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |access-date=2014-01-26}}</ref> keyboardist Gary 'Mutha' Withem (born August 22, 1944, San Diego),<ref name="ChildsMarch2011">''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qwOyZukEwD4C&pg=PT459 Echoes of the Sixties]''.

In 1966, the band [[concert tour|toured]] the [[Pacific Northwest]] without Wheatbread, who was recruited as the [[house band|house]] drummer on the television series, ''[[Where the Action Is]];'' he later rejoined the line-up. Under manager Dick Badger, the team was renamed The Union Gap in early 1967, and its members outfitted themselves in [[Union Army]]-style [[American Civil War|Civil War]] uniforms as a visual gimmick. They then recorded a demo, which was heard by [[CBS]] record producer and songwriter [[Jerry Fuller]]. Impressed by Puckett's tenor voice and the band's [[soft rock]] leanings, Fuller signed them to a [[recording contract]] with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gary-puckett-mn0000185084/biography |title=Gary Puckett &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2014-01-26}}</ref><ref name="oldies">[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Gary-Puckett-and-The-Union-Gap.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421075558/http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Gary-Puckett-and-The-Union-Gap.html |date=April 21, 2009 }}</ref>

The band recorded their first single "[[Woman, Woman]]", a song about a man's fears that his female partner might be considering infidelity, that had been written and composed by [[Jim Glaser]] and Jimmy Payne, in August 1967.<ref name="AMG"/> It became their first [[hit record|hit]], reaching No. 3 in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' and No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It was quickly certified as a million-selling [[RIAA Certification|Gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book | first= Joseph | last= Murrells | year= 1978 | title= The Book of Golden Discs | edition= 2nd | publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd | location= London | page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/232 232] | isbn= 0-214-20512-6 | url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/232 }}</ref>

This was followed during the next two years by "[[Young Girl (song)|Young Girl]]" (No. 1 in ''Cashbox'', No. 2 in ''Billboard''), "[[Lady Willpower]]" (No. 1 in ''Cashbox'', No. 2 in  ''Billboard''), "[[Over You (Gary Puckett & The Union Gap song)|Over You]]" (No. 5 in ''Cashbox'', No. 7 in ''Billboard''), and "[[Don't Give in to Him]]" (No. 15).<ref name="oldies"/> All were produced by Fuller, who also wrote and composed "Young Girl", "Lady Willpower" and "Over You". Although the band never had a ''Billboard'' No. 1 [[gramophone record|record]] in the United States, "Young Girl" hit No. 1 on the [[UK singles chart]] for four weeks in May/June 1968. "[[Young Girl (album)|Young Girl]]" was the second million selling [[gramophone record|disc]] for the band, which it reached less than two months after issue; "Lady Willpower" and "Over You" also won gold discs.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book | first= Joseph | last= Murrells | year= 1978 | title= The Book of Golden Discs | edition= 2nd | publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd | location= London | page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/250 250] | isbn= 0-214-20512-6 | url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/250 }}</ref> The band headlined at a [[White House]] reception for [[Prince Charles]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.garypuckettmusic.com/bio.htm |title=The Official Gary Puckett Union Gap Website Gary Puckett Bio |publisher=Garypuckettmusic.com |access-date=2014-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210223410/http://www.garypuckettmusic.com/bio.htm |archive-date=February 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in 1968, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] in 1969, losing out to [[José Feliciano]].

The band, however, wanted to write and produce its own material, and Puckett resented singing the [[power ballads]] written by Fuller. In 1969 Fuller prepared a 40-piece studio orchestra to record a new song he had written, but Puckett and the group refused to record it, the session was canceled, and Fuller never again worked with the group.<ref name="AMG"/> The band returned to the charts with "[[This Girl Is a Woman Now]]", produced by [[Dick Glasser]], but later releases failed to make the ''Billboard'' Top 40. Chater and Withem left the band; Bement took over on bass guitar and keyboardist, Barry McCoy, and horn player, Richard Gabriel, were added. In 1970 Puckett began recording as a solo act, but with limited success; the Union Gap remained his live backing band until they were dismissed following an appearance at the 1971 [[Orange County Fair (California)|Orange County Fair]]. Puckett's recording contract was terminated one year later.<ref name="AMG"/>

==Solo careers and personal lives==
[[File:Gary Puckett in Boston.jpg|thumb|120px|Gary Puckett in Boston, circa 2005]]
After the Union Gap was disbanded, Puckett had modest success as a solo artist with the 1971 album ''The Gary Puckett Album'' on Columbia, and later mostly performing and re-recording the band's songs. By 1973, he had essentially disappeared from music, opting instead to study acting and dance and performing in theatrical productions in and around Los Angeles. A comeback [[concert tour|tour]] engineered by [[music journalism|music writer]] Thomas K. Arnold brought him to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] in 1981, and from that point on he became a regular on the national oldies circuit.<ref name="AMG"/> Puckett was on the bill for the first major Monkees reunion tour in 1986, along with [[The Grass Roots]] featuring Rob Grill and the current version of [[Herman's Hermits]] (minus [[Peter Noone]]). He has also released some new material, including a 2001 holiday album entitled ''Gary Puckett at Christmas''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gary-puckett-mn0000185084/discography |title=Gary Puckett &#124; Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=October 17, 1942 |access-date=2014-01-26}}</ref> In 1994 and 2002 Puckett performed at the [[Moondance Jam]] near [[Walker, Minnesota|Walker]], Minnesota. As of 2010, Puckett continued to perform live concerts in venues across the US, including "package" oldies circuit tours with [[the Association]] and [[the Lettermen]]. On June 20, 2010, Puckett performed for the first time in [[Union Gap, Washington]], the namesake city of his former band.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100625014004/http://www.yakima-herald.com/stories/2010/06/20/reunion-gap-gary-puckett-performs-in-band-s-namesake-town ReUnion Gap: Gary Puckett performs in band's namesake town, Pat Muir], Web.archive.org</ref>

Chater moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] where he worked as a songwriter, and had a minor solo hit in 1977 with the song "Part Time Love" and the albums ''Part Time Love'' (1977) and ''Love on a Shoestring'' (1978).

Puckett's current band lineup (which is sometimes billed as The Union Gap) is Woody Lingle (bass and vocals), Jamie Hilboldt (keyboards and vocals) and Mike Candito (drums and vocals).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garypuckettmusic.com/band.php|title=Gary Puckett Music - The Union Gap|website=www.garypuckettmusic.com|access-date=December 16, 2018}}</ref> [[File:Union Gap present day.jpg|thumb|The Union Gap, ca. 2012]]
