'''Clan of Xymox''', also known as simply '''Xymox''', are a Dutch rock band formed in 1981 best known as pioneers of [[darkwave]] music. Clan of Xymox featured a trio of singers and songwriters – [[Ronny Moorings]], [[Anka Wolbert]], and [[Pieter Nooten]]<ref name="strong"/><ref name="4ad">{{cite web | url= http://www.4ad.com/artists/clanofxymox | title= 4AD – Clan of Xymox |publisher=[[4AD]] | access-date =31 October 2011}}</ref> – and gained success in the 1980s, releasing their first two albums on [[4AD]], before releasing their third and fourth albums on [[Wing Records]] and scoring a hit single in the United States.<ref name="imagination">{{cite web | url = {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=xymox|chart=all}} | title = Chart History Imagination |work=Billboard | access-date =2 August 2011}}</ref> Their 1980s releases included [[synthpop]]/[[electronic dance music]]. The band is still active, continuing to tour and release records with Moorings as the sole remaining original songwriter and singer.

==History==
===4AD and the Peel Sessions (1983–1988)===

Clan of Xymox were formed in [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands, in 1983<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Anka_Wolbert&oldid=404990171 --> by [[Ronny Moorings]] (vocals, guitar) and [[Anka Wolbert]] (bass, vocals). A year later, Moorings and Wolbert moved to Amsterdam, releasing the [[mini-album]] ''Subsequent Pleasures'' as ''Xymox''. The album was limited to 500 copies.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web |title=Clan of Xymox - Biography |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/299365/clan-xymox/biography |website=Billboard |access-date=21 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018042356/https://www.billboard.com/artist/299365/clan-xymox/biography |archive-date=18 October 2015 |quote=Clan of Xymox were formed in Nijmegen, Netherlands, in 1983 by Ronny Moorings (vocals, guitar) and Anka Wolbert (bass, vocals). A year later, Moorings and Wolbert moved to Amsterdam, releasing the LP Subsequent Pleasures as Xymox. (The album was limited to 500 copies.)}}</ref>

<blockquote>"Ronny and I met as students in Nijmegen and we connected over our taste in music. We started making music together and picked up some equipment to experiment with, like the [[Korg MS-10]] and a rhythm machine...We started to perform live, just the two of us, changing instruments in between songs. While I had a bass guitar strapped around my neck and simultaneously hit the monophonic keyboard, Ronny played guitar and sang. We combined our sound with tape loops, a Casio, plus a few weird instruments."<ref name="post-punk-anka">{{cite web |title=Subsequent Pleasures: An interview with Anka Wolbert of Xymox |url=https://post-punk.com/subsequent-pleasures-an-interview-with-anka-wolbert-of-xymox/ |website=Post-Punk.com |access-date=21 April 2021 |date=14 August 2014 |quote=After Pieter and Frank had joined and we started touring on a bigger scale, I mostly played bass and keyboard live, and would only sing one or two songs. I did not necessarily enjoy playing live, not yet anyway. I mostly enjoyed the music writing process itself, the programming and experimenting with structure and sound, by myself. We’d only start rehearsing as a band together after the songs had been worked on in our home studio, not the other way round. The three of us – Pieter, Ronny and I – would each come up with songs, we were all songwriters, and we’d take turns working by ourselves in the studio, or work on bits and pieces by ourselves at home. Pieter and I would also contribute to Ronny’s songs. This didn’t happen so much vice versa. In the end, and although a little fragmented, it always did feel we accomplished getting all the tracks together by team effort. On the first two 4AD albums we split royalties equally in three.}}</ref></blockquote>

Now abbreviated as Xymox, the band's third album, ''[[Twist of Shadows]]'', was released in 1989. This album, and its successor ''[[Phoenix (Clan of Xymox album)|Phoenix]]'', were released by [[Wing Records]], a subsidiary of [[Polydor Records]]/[[PolyGram]].

Xymox, without Nooten and Wolbert, left PolyGram to release the UK [[acid house]] inspired LPs ''Metamorphosis'' (1992) and ''Headclouds'' (1993) independently.<ref name="strong"/> These albums marked a break from the dark wave sound of the 1980s and met with poor record sales in the United States, which had moved towards a markedly different [[grunge]] sound at the time. Ronny Moorings toured under the banner of Xymox until 1994 with an evolving cast of live musicians, including girlfriend and future band member Mojca Zugna.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.premonition.org/premor.php3?lien=actu/actu.php3X1Xactuid=219003&ta=10 | title = Clan of Xymox | work = Premonition | date = August 2003 | access-date = 26 January 2011 | last = Labussière | first = Christophe | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724140005/http://www.premonition.org/premor.php3?lien=actu%2Factu.php3X1Xactuid%3D219003&ta=10 | archive-date = 24 July 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Frank Weyzig (the last of the original line-up) parted ways with Moorings after the 1994 tour, after which Moorings moved back to the Netherlands and took a three-year hiatus from music-writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unruhr.de/musik/revue/3022-clan-of-xymox-metamorphosis-biographie-teil-4|title=(Clan of) XYMOX – Metamorphosis 1992–2001 (Biography Part 4/5)|author=Michael Köchling|publisher=Unruhr.de|access-date=15 February 2015}}</ref>

Capitalizing on a resurgence in the popularity of [[gothic rock]] and the success of bands such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Rammstein]], 1997 saw Moorings reverting the name to Clan of Xymox and moving to Germany – then the center of the burgeoning [[industrial music]] scene – to resume songwriting.
