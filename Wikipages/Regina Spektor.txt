Traveling first to Austria and then Italy, the Spektor family was admitted to the United States as refugees with the assistance of [[HIAS]] (the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society). They settled in [[the Bronx]], where Spektor graduated from [[SAR Academy]], a [[Jewish day school|Jewish day middle school]] in the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] section of the Bronx. Since the family had been unable to bring their piano from Moscow, Spektor practiced on tabletops and other hard surfaces until she found a piano to play in the basement of her synagogue. In New York City, Spektor studied classical piano with Sonia Vargas, a professor at the [[Manhattan School of Music]], until she was 17; Spektor's father had met Vargas through Vargas' husband, violinist Samuel Marder.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roeschlein|first=Shane|date=25 March 2005|title=Regina Spektor: The Red Princess|url=http://www.themusicedge.com/moxie/news/featartist/regina-spektor-the-red-pr.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103170008/http://www.themusicedge.com/moxie/news/featartist/regina-spektor-the-red-pr.shtml|archive-date=2006-01-03|publisher=themusicedge.com}}</ref> Spektor attended high school for two years at the [[Frisch School]], a [[yeshiva]] in [[Paramus, New Jersey]], but transferred to a public school, [[Fair Lawn High School]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/magazine/regina-spektor-has-piano-will-travel.html|title=Regina Spektor Has Piano, Will Travel|last=Mason|first=Wyatt|date=2012-05-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> in [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey]], where she finished the last two years of her high school education.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Spektor was originally interested in classical music only, but she later grew interested in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], rock, and [[Punk rock|punk]] as well.<ref name="soundcheck"/> Although she had always made up songs around the house, she first became interested in more formal songwriting during a visit to Israel with the [[Nesiya|Nesiya Institute]] in her teenage years when she attracted attention from the other children on the trip for the songs she made up while hiking.<ref name="nypr"/>

Following this trip, Spektor was exposed to the works of [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Ani DiFranco]], and other singer-songwriters, which encouraged her belief that she could create her own songs.<ref name="nypr"/> She wrote her first [[a cappella]] songs around the age of 16 and her first songs for voice and piano when she was 17.<ref name="soundcheck"/>

Spektor completed the four-year studio composition program of the Conservatory of Music at [[State University of New York at Purchase|Purchase College]] within three years, graduating with [[Latin honors|honors]] in 2001.

==Career==
===2001–2005: Career beginnings and ''Soviet Kitsch''===
Spektor gradually achieved recognition through performances in the anti-folk scene in downtown New York City, most prominently at the East Village's [[SideWalk Cafe]]. She also performed at local colleges (such as [[Sarah Lawrence College]]) with other musicians, including the [[Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players]].

According to the statement given to the audience, Spektor was fine, but doctors said that she could not perform that night.

==Voice and style==
[[Image:Regina SpektorConcert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Spektor in concert, February 2006]]
Spektor's primary instrument is the piano, and she plays the guitar as a secondary instrument, primarily playing on a seafoam [[Epiphone]] Wildkat [[Archtop guitar|archtop]] [[Semi-acoustic guitar|hollow-body electric guitar]] for live performances.<ref>{{cite web|date=6 April 2005|title=Imagine A Female Singer Songwriter For The Strokes Generation|url=http://www.epiphone.com/news.asp?NewsID=259|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151433/http://www.epiphone.com/news.asp?NewsID=259|archive-date=28 September 2011|access-date=23 August 2015|website=Epiphone.com}}</ref><!--Note, although the Epiphone official site states that she plays an Alleykat guitar, an examination of both the Alleykat and Epiphone photos on the Epiphone website shows that it is actually a Wildkat guitar.-->

I want to write a classic like [[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]] but weird songs about meatballs in refrigerators come into my head&nbsp;– I can't help it."<ref>[[Rolling Stone magazine]] issue 694, September 2009. "New York Screwball Pop Queen" by [[Jenny Eliscu]], page18.</ref>

Spektor performs using a broad [[vocal range]], with a falsetto extension, but without any apparent break. She explores a variety of different and somewhat unorthodox vocal techniques, such as verses composed entirely of buzzing noises made with the lips and [[beatboxing|beatbox]]-style flourishes in the middle of ballads, and also makes use of such unusual musical techniques as using a drum stick to tap rhythms on the body of a chair.<ref name="nypr"/><ref name="block">{{cite web|last=Block|first=Melissa|date=28 June 2006|title=Stories in Song: Regina Spektor's ''Begin to Hope''|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5518985|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630154806/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5518985|archive-date=2006-06-30|publisher=[[National Public Radio]] – [[All Things Considered]]}} MP3 audio download linked from archived copy)</ref> Part of her style also results from the exaggeration of certain aspects of vocalization, most notably the [[glottal stop]], prominent in the single "[[Fidelity (song)|Fidelity]]". She also uses a strong [[New York accent]] on some words, which she has said is due to her love of New York and its culture.<ref name="soundcheck"/>

Spektor usually sings in English, though she sometimes includes a few words or verses of [[Latin]], Russian, French, or other languages. She plays with pronunciations, which she told NPR to be a remnant of her early years when she listened to pop in English without understanding the lyrics.

Her lyrics are equally eclectic, often taking the form of abstract narratives or first-person character studies, similar to [[short story|short stories]] or [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] put to song.<ref name="soundcheck"/><ref name="block"/> Some of Spektor's lyrics include literary allusions,<ref name="nypr"/> such as: [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]] in "Poor Little Rich Boy"; ''[[The Little Prince]]'' in "Baobabs"; [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] in "Paris"; [[Ezra Pound]] and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' in "Pound of Flesh"; [[Boris Pasternak]] in "Après Moi"; [[Samson]] and [[Delilah]] in "[[Samson (Regina Spektor song)|Samson]]"; ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' in "Oedipus"; Edith Wharton's ''[[Ethan Frome]]'' in "2.99¢ Blues". Recurring themes and topics in Spektor's lyrics include love, death, religion (particularly biblical and Jewish references), city life (particularly New York references), and certain key phrases which recur in different songs, such as references to [[gravedigger]]s, the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], and the name "Mary Ann". Spektor's use of satire is evident in "Wasteside", which refers to ''[[The Twelve Chairs]]'', the classic satirical novel by the Soviet authors [[Ilf and Petrov]], and describes the town in which people are born, get their hair cut, and then are sent to the cemetery.

Spektor's first album, ''[[11:11 (Regina Spektor album)|11:11]]'', was recorded and self-released while she was still in college. It differs from Spektor's later releases as she was heavily influenced by [[blues]] and [[jazz]] at the time of its recording. Her second album, ''[[Songs (Regina Spektor album)|Songs]]'', was recorded on Christmas Day, 2001. Each song was recorded with just one take and is entirely acoustic. The session from which the album was derived was not originally intended as an album recording session.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carátula Interior Frontal de Regina Spektor - 11:11 - Portada|url=http://www.coveralia.com/caratulas/Regina-Spektor-11-11-Interior1.php|website=Coveralia.com}}</ref> Her third album, ''[[Soviet Kitsch]]'', featured strings on several songs and was her first to feature a full rock band. Upon signing with a major label – which provided a bigger budget for production and studio time – Spektor began to emphasise production and more prominently use traditional pop and rock instruments.<ref name="thislondon"/>

Spektor says the records that most impact her are those of "bands whose music is really involved".<ref name="avclub">{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Noel|date=June 21, 2006|title=Interviews {{!}} Regina Spektor|newspaper=The A.V.

British singer [[Kate Nash]] said, "I related to her because she's a woman who plays the piano and writes imaginative songs. I've played the piano since I was about seven but I'd never seen it as an instrument for pop music. Regina Spektor made the piano cool… I love the fact that her accent shines through.
