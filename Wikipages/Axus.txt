The site of Axus is located near modern [[Axos, Crete|Axos]],<ref name=Barrington/><ref>{{Cite DARE|28861}}</ref><ref name=Poleis/> near [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]]. In the 19th century, remains belonging to the so-called [[Cyclopean walls]] were found, and in the church a piece of white marble with a sepulchral inscription in the ancient [[Doric Greek language]] of the island. On another inscription was a decree of a "common assembly of the Cretans," an instance of the well known Syncretism, as it was called. The coins of Axus present types of [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]], as might be expected in a city situated on the slopes of Mt. Ida, and the foundation of which was, by one of the legends, ascribed to a son of Apollo. The situation answers to one of the etymologies of the name: it was called Axus because the place is precipitous, that word being used by the Cretans in the same sense that the other Greeks assigned to ἀγμός, a crag.<ref>{{Cite DGRG|title=Axus}}</ref>
