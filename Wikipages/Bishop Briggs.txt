At the age of four, she moved to Tokyo with her family. She sang in public for the first time at a Tokyo [[karaoke]] bar, and realised she wanted to be a performer. Growing up with the city's karaoke bar traditions and hearing music ranging from [[Motown]] musicians to [[The Beatles]] at home also inspired her to pursue music. She started writing her own songs at the age of seven, and would perform them for her family. She moved to Hong Kong at the age of 10, where she lived until she was 18. She continued to pursue music throughout her youth, participating in a number of school talent shows and performances. After graduating from [[Hong Kong International School]], she moved to Los Angeles and attended college at [[Musicians Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bishop Briggs: iHeartRadio On The Verge Artist {{!}} iHeartRadio On The Verge {{!}} iHeartRadio|url=http://news.iheart.com/features/iheartradio-on-the-verge-28/articles/15/490150/bishop-briggs-iheartradio-on-the-verge-14774475|website=iHeartRadio|access-date=22 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008160751/http://news.iheart.com/features/iheartradio-on-the-verge-28/articles/15/490150/bishop-briggs-iheartradio-on-the-verge-14774475/|archive-date=8 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
