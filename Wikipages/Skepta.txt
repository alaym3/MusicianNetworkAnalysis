== Career ==
=== 2003–2006: Career beginnings and ''Greatest Hits'' ===
Skepta was originally a DJ from Tottenham-based grime collective Meridian Crew. The Meridian Crew performed 'sets' or sessions on [[pirate radio]] (most notably Heat FM 96.6) where fellow crew members sometimes referred to him as "Scoopa Daniels".<ref>{{YouTube|id=1uTnb6YcCZc|title=Old Meridian Crew Heat FM set Sept 2002 JME Skepta Big H Bossman|time=1m24s}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=OUcWFCIjfXw|title=MERIDIAN CREW ON HEAT FM, 2004|time=1h5m57s}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=n3UHmMSwwmE|title=Dj skepta meridian crew ft wood green mobb heat fm 2001|time=3m29s}}</ref> Early in his career, Skepta released instrumentals including "DTI (Pirate Station Anthem)" and "Private Caller".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ward|first=Billy|title=The Dummy guide to Skepta|date=26 June 2019|url=https://www.dummymag.com/features/the-dummy-guide-to-skepta/|access-date=2021-01-16|website=Dummy|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Skepta began MCing shortly before Meridian Crew disbanded in 2005, after which Skepta, alongside his brother [[Jme (musician)|Jme]], joined [[Roll Deep]] for a short period of time before becoming founding members of [[Boy Better Know]] in 2006. Skepta was convinced to begin MCing by [[Wiley (musician)|Wiley]] after his records were taken away from him by the police.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rinse:04 – Skepta - Rinse:04 – Skepta {{!}} Rinse FM|url=https://rinse.fm/releases/rinse04-skepta/|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027075054/https://rinse.fm/releases/rinse04-skepta/|archive-date=27 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the formation of [[Boy Better Know]], Skepta [[Sound clash|clashed]] with fellow MC Devilman for the DVD Lord of the Mics 2, in what is remembered as one of the biggest clashes in grime history.<ref name="yates" /><ref name="thefader.com" /> Shortly after the clash, Skepta released a [[mixtape]] entitled "''Joseph Junior Adenuga''". Skepta publicly released his debut album ''[[Greatest Hits (Skepta album)|Greatest Hits]]'' on 17 September 2007, on his label [[Boy Better Know]].

=== 2008–2011: ''Microphone Champion'' and ''Doin' It Again'' ===
Skepta self-released the first single "[[Rolex Sweep]]" in September 2008 and reached number 89 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Skepta then released the album ''[[Microphone Champion]]'' on 1 June 2009. He then also released single "Too Many Man" with Jme, Wiley, [[Frisco (rapper)|Frisco]] and Shorty, which went to chart at number 79. Skepta has released five singles off his third studio album ''[[Doin' It Again]]'' (first with a major label), titled "[[Bad Boy (Skepta song)|Bad Boy]]", "[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]", "[[Cross My Heart (Skepta song)|Cross My Heart]]" featuring [[Preeya Kalidas]], "[[So Alive (Skepta song)|So Alive]]" and "[[Amnesia (Skepta song)|Amnesia]]", as well as a video for the [[Hello Good Morning#Remixes|Hello Good Morning]] (Grime Remix). Three singles charted in the Top 40 of the [[UK Singles Chart]], with "[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]" being the most successful at number 14. "Cross My Heart" came in at number 31 and dropped out of the Top 40 a week later. ''Doin' It Again'' spent 3 weeks in the top 100 album charts and debuted and peaked at number 19 on its first week of release. In 2011, Skepta caused a controversy by releasing a [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]] music video of his single "All Over the House".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moir|first1=Sam|title=Skepta's new video: a step too far?|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/03/24/skepta%e2%80%99s-new-video-a-step-too-far-2/|website=The Independent|access-date=12 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922105707/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/03/24/skepta%E2%80%99s-new-video-a-step-too-far-2/|archive-date=22 September 2015|date=25 March 2011}}</ref>

=== 2012–present: ''Blacklisted'', ''Konnichiwa'' and ''Ignorance Is Bliss'' ===
In 2012, Skepta released two singles from his fourth forthcoming album. Both "[[Hold On (Skepta song)|Hold On]]" and "[[Make Peace Not War]]" were Top 40 charting singles in the UK but were a departure from Skepta's usual sound. Skepta's second major label album was intended to be released in the fourth quarter of 2011, entitled ''The Honeymoon'' but was delayed till 2012. After a disappointing response from the first two singles Skepta decided to release a purchasable mixtape, titled ''Blacklisted''. It was released on 2 December 2012 along with music videos to support the release prior to the release.
