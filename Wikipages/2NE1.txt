The group was introduced in March 2009 after appearing on the [[Promotional recording|promotional single]] "[[Lollipop (Big Bang and 2NE1 song)|Lollipop]]" alongside labelmate [[Big Bang (band)|Big Bang]]. 2NE1 rose to prominence with the release of their debut eponymous [[extended play]] ''[[2NE1 (2009 EP)|2NE1]]'' (2009), which featured the singles "[[Fire (2NE1 song)|Fire]]" and "[[I Don't Care (2NE1 song)|I Don't Care]]".

2NE1 followed up their debut EP with their first studio album, ''[[To Anyone]]'' (2010), and [[2NE1 (2011 EP)|their second EP]]; the latter produced four chart-topping singles: "Don't Cry", "[[Lonely (2NE1 song)|Lonely]]", "[[I Am the Best]]" and "Ugly".
