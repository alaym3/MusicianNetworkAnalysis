==Early life==

Oliver Tree Nickell was born on June 29, 1993, in [[Santa Cruz, California]],<ref name=allmusic/> where he was also raised. He has said he took "piano lessons at three years old, [began] songwriting the next year, and [had] an album written by age six."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/oliver-tree-do-you-feel-me-ep-868367/|title=Oliver Tree Is Outlandish, and It's Working|last=Leight|first=Elias|date=2019-08-16|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref> He sang and played guitar in a [[ska]] band called Irony, which was his first experience performing.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8504578/chartbreaker-oliver-tree-ugly-is-beautiful-debut-interview|title=Chartbreaker: Inside Oliver Tree's Retro, Meme-Friendly World And How He Turned 'Hurt' Into a Hit|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> In high school, Tree took an interest in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]], becoming a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and recording with the rap group Mindfuck. Under the pseudonym Kryph, Tree produced dubstep for a brief period of time and performed at festivals such as Wobbleland 2011 in San Francisco. He has performed shows opening for acts such as [[Tyler, the Creator]]; [[Nero (band)|Nero]], and [[Frank Ocean]], and has released music under his pseudonym, Tree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stubhub.com/oliver-tree-tickets/performer/100316750/|title=About Oliver Tree|website=StubHub|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20191202211927/https://www.stubhub.com/oliver-tree-tickets/performer/100316750/|archive-date=December 2, 2019|access-date=December 2, 2019}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>

By the age of 17, Tree had already made presentations for performances such as [[Skrillex]] and [[Zeds Dead]], and began releasing his music under his middle name, Tree.

At age 18, he signed up with London-based [[R&S Records]] and released his debut EP, ''Demons''. The EP gained some recognition after [[Radiohead]] lead singer [[Thom Yorke]] approved of his cover of their song "[[Karma Police]]".<ref>{{cite web |last=Weir |first=Mat |title=Branching Out With Oliver Tree |url=http://euphoric.net/blog/2017/09/01/branching-out-with-oliver-tree/ |website=euphoric.net}}</ref>

Tree studied business at [[San Francisco State University]] for two years<ref name="auto2"/> and Music Technology at the [[California Institute of the Arts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==Career==
Oliver launched his solo recording career as "Tree" in 2010. He initially self-released his music but signed with [[R&S Records]] in 2011. He eventually found himself on hiatus as he went back to school, studying music technology at the [[California Institute of the Arts]].<ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto2">{{cite web |last=Baine |first=Wallace |title=Branching Out With Oliver Tree |url=https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2016/06/22/with-a-new-music-video-santa-cruzs-oliver-nickell-takes-on-the-mainstream/ |date=2016-06-22 |website=santacruzsentinel.com}}</ref>

In November 2016, he returned to music with his television debut, performing with [[Getter (DJ)|Getter]] on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''.<ref name="owsla">{{cite web|url=http://owsla.com/uncategorized/getter-oliver-tree-carson-daly/|website=owsla.com|title=OWSLA Getter Oliver Tree Carson Daly|access-date=2018-07-31|date=2016-11-03}}</ref>

Shortly after the release of "When I'm Down", Tree signed to [[Atlantic Records]], and a month later, graduated from the [[California Institute of the Arts]].

Tree often writes, acts, and directs sketches in comedy videos, and has worked with companies such as Fuck Jerry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oliver Tree Releases New Single 'Upside Down' |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Oliver-Tree-Releases-New-Single-Upside-Down-20180105 |website=broadwayworld.com}}</ref>

In February 2018, Tree released his major-label debut EP, ''Alien Boy'', along with the double music video for "All That x Alien Boy". Tree wrote and directed the debut, which took over nine months to create.<ref name="auto1"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Tree |first1=Oliver |title=All That x Alien Boy |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ocfE8Ua-7U |website=YouTube}}</ref> He spent five months practising freestyle monster truck jumping at the [[Perris Auto Speedway]] and performed all his stunts in the music video.

Oliver Tree has played major festivals such as [[Lollapalooza]] and [[Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival]], and performed as a special guest at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] and EDC, most notably at Coachella, where he was subsequently named on ''[[LA Weekly]]''{{'}}s "The Best (and Weirdest) Fashion at Coachella" list in 2017.<ref name="auto3"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Lopes |first=Shane |title=The Best (and Weirdest) Fashion at Coachella 2017 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/slideshow/the-best-and-weirdest-fashion-at-coachella-2017-8136207/20 |website=LAWeekly}}</ref>

On December 7, 2018, Tree released his second music video, "Hurt", a single from his debut album, ''[[Ugly Is Beautiful]]''. He travelled to [[Ukraine]] to film the video, which he wrote and co-directed with Brendan Vaughan, an up-and-coming music video director.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tree |first=Oliver |title=Hurt |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqpnbSFprB4 |website=YouTube}}</ref> In the first week, the music video for "Hurt" reached one million views while the song received significant radio play.
On April 11, 2019, Tree released his third music video, "Fuck", with the single being released on the same day.<ref>{{Citation|last=Oliver Tree|title=Oliver Tree - Fuck [Official Music Video]|date=2019-04-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8QQHGupPrs|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>
[[File:OliverTree Oakland2019.jpg|thumb|Tree performing in 2019]]
His fourth music video and single, "Miracle Man", was released on June 7, 2019, with the video reaching 1.3 million views on the first day of release. On June 12, he announced that he would give his final tour.<ref>{{Citation|last=Oliver Tree|title=Oliver Tree final tour Twitter Announcement|url=https://twitter.com/Olivertree/status/1137030005249077249|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>

Tree released his second EP, ''Do You Feel Me?'' on August 2, 2019, to generally positive reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Oliver-Tree-Drops-Sophomore-EP-20190802|title=Oliver Tree Drops Sophomore EP|last=News Desk|first=BWW|date=2019-08-02|website=Broadway World|access-date=2019-09-16}}</ref>

Tree stumbled after jumping off the approximately 6-foot (1.8-metre) tall stage at a Coachella festival in 2019. This caused his lip, mouth, and nose to bleed live at one of the country's largest music festivals.

On December 6, 2019, Tree released "Cash Machine", a single accompanied by a music video. Together with the single, Tree announced his debut album, ''Ugly Is Beautiful'', with an initial release date of March 27, 2020.<ref>{{Citation|title=Oliver Tree - Cash Machine [Official Music Video]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1vGosMScjM|language=en|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>

On March 25, 2020, Tree posted a message to his Twitter page, stating that due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], ''Ugly Is Beautiful'' would not be released on time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Olivertree/status/1242973226919014400/photo/1|title=pic.twitter.com/e3d7SbO8Bu|last=Tree|first=Oliver|date=2020-03-25|website=@Olivertree|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> However, on May 19, the album's official release date was revealed to be June 12.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAZG6uvjpot/</ref>

On May 16, 2020, Tree set the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness world record]] for the world's largest [[kick scooter]], which he later uploaded a video of himself riding on July 17, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Largest kick scooter|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/597218-largest-kick-scooter|access-date=2021-10-01|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Oliver Tree Crashes The Worldâ€™s Biggest Scooter|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D2nCEv_9tY|language=en|access-date=2021-10-01}}</ref>

On May 26, 2020, Tree uploaded a music video for "Bury Me Alive" from ''Ugly Is Beautiful'' with a $6 budget.<ref>{{Cite web|title=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRiwYDwagvs&feature=youtu.be|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

On June 8, 2020, Tree announced his decision to delay ''Ugly Is Beautiful'' yet again, this time to July 17. He stated that, because of the issues of racism and police violence against black people going on during that time after the [[murder of George Floyd]], he "did not believe it was an appropriate time" to release the album when "much bigger things" deserved attention.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBMukuwjvV8/?igshid=1thoj5o1dv9sr</ref>

On July 15, 2020, Tree announced in a [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] interview with [[Anthony Fantano]] and the [[H3 Podcast]] that ''Ugly Is Beautiful'' would be his last album and that he would be retiring from his music career after its release. He cited the difficulties he had with his label and the industry in promoting and releasing the album as his reasoning. He has decided he will pursue filmmaking afterward. This most likely refers to the end of the "Turbo" character that Tree has been playing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Oliver Tree INTERVIEW - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPpsNTAhpUE&feature=youtu.be|access-date=2020-07-18|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=July 18, 2020|title=Oliver Tree - H3 Podcast #198|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnCV_5QVp4s|access-date=July 22, 2020|website=Youtube}}</ref>

On July 17, 2020, ''[[Ugly Is Beautiful]]'' was released. Most notably in this album is the song "1993", which features an alien-themed character named Little Ricky ZR3, who, in Oliver's words, is an "upcoming artist" and "long-term friend." On the album, it features American DJ [[Marshmello]] producing the song "Jerk". In the Fantano interview, Oliver states that Little Ricky had helped Oliver produce songs and had even done some vinyl scratching on his track ''Bury Me Alive''. Many fans speculate that Little Ricky is actually Oliver and that his vocals in "1993" are simply Oliver's voice pitched down. Along with this, fans speculate that even though Oliver's main character, Turbo/Oliver Tree would be gone, Oliver would continue to release music under the alias Little Ricky ZR3.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Oliver Tree - Anthony Fantano interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPpsNTAhpUE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Oliver Tree - 1993|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fszyzqIiF8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Lil Ricky Instagram profile|url=https://www.instagram.com/littlericky/}}</ref>

On July 18, 2020, [[YouTube]] star [[H3h3Productions]] posted a podcast starring and interviewing Oliver. In the interview, Oliver claims that [[Atlantic Records]] had forced him to release several singles from his debut album ''[[Ugly Is Beautiful]]'' against his will, comparing the experience to chapters being ripped out of a book and released separately. In addition to this, Oliver also stated that Atlantic had forced him to reach 1 million followers to be signed on their label, and then changed this number to 2 million when he reached 1 million.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Oliver Tree - H3 Podcast #198|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnCV_5QVp4s}}</ref>

Despite claiming that he was retired, he released the single "Out of Ordinary" on February 4, 2021, announcing the deluxe edition of ''Ugly Is Beautiful''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Diymag|title=Oliver Tree releases new track 'Out Of Ordinary' {{!}} News|url=http://diymag.com/2021/02/05/listen-oliver-tree-out-of-ordinary|access-date=2021-03-11|website=diymag.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=February 5, 2021|title=Oliver Tree Concocts A Belter For All The Outcasts With "Out Of Ordinary"|url=https://thissongissick.com/post/oliver-tree-out-of-ordinary/|access-date=March 10, 2021|website=This Song Is Sick|language=en-US}}</ref> Shortly afterward, Oliver announced a second album, entitled ''Cowboy Tears''.

On May 28, 2021, Tree uploaded a music video for "[[Life Goes On (Oliver Tree song)|Life Goes On]]" from ''[[Ugly Is Beautiful]].'' According to [https://www.songfacts.com/ songfacts.com], Oliver Tree sings in the song about a toxic relationship with a controlling, two-faced lover. Rather than let it grind him down, he carries on with his life and loses himself in his work. Tree originally wrote the song for his debut album, Ugly Is Beautiful, but it didn't make the final tracklist. Instead, he included it as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of the album Ugly Is Beautiful: Shorter, Thicker & Uglier on May 27, 2020.

He would later collaborate with Russian [[Rave music|rave]] band [[Little Big (band)|Little Big]] and release the single "Turn It Up", featuring [[Tommy Cash (rapper)|Tommy Cash]], from their collaborative EP ''Welcome To The Internet'', which was later released on September 30, 2021.
