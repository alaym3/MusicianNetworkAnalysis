'''Anonymous''' is a band from [[Andorra]] that in 2007 represented the country with the song "[[Salvem el món]]" in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] after being chosen by the internal national selection.  The song, however, failed to make it through past the semi-final stage.

The top ten acts are moved up to the finals, and Andorra came in 12th. The band was formed in 2004 and has had some success in Andorra and northern [[Spain]] (mainly [[Catalonia]]).
