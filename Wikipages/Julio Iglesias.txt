During his career, Iglesias has won many awards in the music industry, including the [[Grammy]], [[Latin Grammy]], [[World Music Award]], [[Billboard Music Award]], [[American Music Award]] and [[Lo Nuestro Awards|Lo Nuestro Award]]. He has been awarded the Gold Medal for Merit in the Fine Arts of Spain and the [[Legion of Honour]] of France. [[UNICEF]] named him Special Ambassador for the Performing Arts in 1989. He has had a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] since 1985.

==Early life==
Iglesias was born in [[Madrid]] to [[Julio Iglesias Sr.]], a [[medical doctor]] from [[Ourense]] who became one of the youngest [[gynecologist]]s in the country, and María del Rosario de la Cueva y Perignat. His paternal grandparents, Manuela Puga Noguerol and Ulpiano Iglesias Sarria, were of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite news |last=Murashko |first=Alex |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/09/local/me-1436 |title=Hands Across the Water, to Spain's Galicia |date=9 August 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=30 November 2013}}</ref> His maternal grandparents were José de la Cueva y Orejuela (1887–1955)<ref>{{cite book |last=Moral Roncal |first=Antonio M. |date=2003 |title=Cuba ante la Guerra Civil Española: la acción diplomática de Ramón Estalella |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ze2gAAAAMAAJ&q=Julio+Iglesias+Jose+de+la+Cueva+y+Orejuela |publisher=Editorial Biblioteca Nueva, S.L. |isbn=8497421671 |access-date=30 November 2013}}</ref> and Dolores de Perignat y Ruiz de Benavides,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elcorreogallego.es/tendencias/ecg/vips-julio-cumple-67-anos-plena-gira-mundial/idEdicion-2010-10-02/idNoticia-595712/ |title=''Julio cumple 67 años en plena gira mundial'' |date=10 February 2010|publisher=elcorreogallegos.es |access-date=30 November 2013}}</ref> who was a native of [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]], [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://peopleenespanol.com/article/julio-iglesias-tendra-una-estrella-en-el-paseo-de-la-fama-de-puerto-rico/ |title=Julio Iglesias tendrá una estrella en el Paseo de la Fama de Puerto Rico |access-date=11 September 2016}}</ref>

The name "''Iglesias''" translates as "churches", although Iglesias claims to be of Jewish ancestry on his maternal side. He has said that his mother's family name, "''de la Cueva''", meaning literally "of the cave" and referring to Jewish people in hiding, is a common Jewish name.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB4D22FCBF3DE06&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=FRONT |date=12 July 1995 |newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]] |access-date=30 November 2013}}</ref> He has proclaimed himself Jewish "from the waist up".<ref>{{cite news |last=Brinn |first=David |url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Arts/Julio-Iglesias-still-speaks-the-language-of-love-331514 |title=Julio Iglesias still speaks the language of love |date=12 November 2013 |publisher=jpost.com |access-date=30 November 2013}}</ref>

He alternated playing professional football with studying law at the [[CEU San Pablo University]] in Madrid. In his youth, he was a goalkeeper for [[Real Madrid Castilla]] in the ''[[Segunda División]]''. His professional football career was ruined when he was involved in a serious automobile accident in 1963 that left him unable to walk for two years.<ref name="ElSoldeCuervanaca">{{cite news |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldecuernavaca/notas/n1335699.htm |title=''El personaje de hoy'' |date=23 September 2009 |publisher=oem.com.mx |access-date=30 November 2013}}</ref> The accident smashed his lower spine and left his legs permanently weakened and requiring therapy for several years. He has said of those years, "I had more courage and attitude than talent". While he was in hospital after the accident, a nurse named Eladio Magdaleno gave him a guitar so that he could recover the dexterity of his hands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-4674151 |title=Julio Iglesias no se olvida de vivir |first=Casa Editorial El |last=Tiempo |date=10 July 2011 |website=El Tiempo}}</ref> In learning to play, he discovered his musical talent.<ref name="People-1988">{{cite news |last1=Dougherty |first1=Steve |last2=Gold |first2=Todd |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20099784,00.html

In September 2006, Iglesias released a new English-language album, which he titled ''[[Romantic Classics]].''

==Personal life==
On 29 January 1971, Iglesias married [[Isabel Preysler]], a [[Philippines|Filipina]] [[television host]].

In the 1970s, Iglesias and his family were extensively depicted on the front pages of international newspapers and magazines. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979. The couple also applied for marriage annulment by the Catholic Church which was granted in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.divinity.es/blogs/oteradas/Famosos-nulidad-eclesiastica-Divorciados-Iglesia-fran_rivera-lourdes_montes_6_1836015006.html|title = Famosos con nulidad eclesiástica: Divorciados por la Iglesia|date = 5 August 2014}}</ref>

Whenever Iglesias was not on tour, he spent his time at his Miami residence, purchased in 1978 for $650,000. The mansion on the private [[Indian Creek, Florida|Indian Creek Island]], whose interior design was made by Virginia Sipl, was placed on the market in 2006 for a quoted $28 million, making it one of the "Ten Most Expensive Homes in the South" in 2006 according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/realestate/2006/06/09/expensive-homes-south_cx_lr_0612home.html | title=Home Improvements - Most Expensive Home In The U.S. 2006: South | work=www.forbes.com | author=Lacey Rose | access-date=12 June 2006 | date=12 June 2006}}</ref>

After his divorce, Iglesias lived with Dutch model Miranda Rijnsburger, 22 years his junior, whom he married on 26 August 2010 in a small church in [[Marbella, Spain]]. They had five children: Miguel Alejandro Iglesias (born 7 September 1997), Rodrigo Iglesias (born 3 April 1999), twins Cristina and Victoria Iglesias (born 1 May 2001), and Guillermo Iglesias (born 5 May 2007).

On 19 December 2005, Iglesias's father died of a [[heart attack]] at the age of 90. A week before his father's death, it became known that Julio's 42-year-old wife, Ronna Keitt, was pregnant with their second child. Their first child, Jaime, had been born on 18 May 2004. The second child, Ruth, was born on 26 July 2006.

In 2008, after his house in Indian Creek did not sell at his asking price, he ordered it razed and said he planned to build another on the lot.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Christina S.

In 2019, a court in [[Valencia]] ruled that Iglesias is the father of Javier Sánchez, son of Portuguese former dancer Maria Edite Santos. Sánchez had been pursuing his [[paternity suit]] in court since 1992, arguing that he was conceived when his mother allegedly had an affair with Iglesias in the [[Catalonia]] region in July 1975. The singer, who rejected all those claims, had refused on several occasions to undergo a [[paternity test]]. The Sánchez legal team argued that DNA evidence obtained in the US by an investigator proved their case; however, the DNA sample did not come directly from the singer but was collected from "a bottle of water" used by his son, Julio Iglesias Jr, which he left on a [[Miami]] beach. The presiding judge, José Miguel Bort, rejected this DNA claim but ruled in favor of Sánchez. Delivering the verdict, judge Bort said his decision was reached in part because of the "resemblance between the two men" and on the basis of Edite's testimony.<ref name=javier>{{cite news  |date=10 July 2019 |title=Julio Iglesias ruled by court as father of Spaniard, 43|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48934334 |website=[[BBC]]|access-date=27 August 2021}}</ref> Iglesias appealed the verdict and the Provincial Court of Valencia reversed judge Bort's ruling, declaring it canot be proven that Sánchez is the son of Iglesias.
