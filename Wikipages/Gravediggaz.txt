'''Gravediggaz''' was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group from New York, known for its [[Black comedy|dark sense of humor]] and abrasive, menacing [[soundscape]]s. Gravediggaz blended [[hardcore hip hop]], [[gangsta rap]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] with horror elements to pioneer the hip-hop subgenre of [[horrorcore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gravediggaz-mn0000662067|title=Gravediggaz - Biography, Albums, Streaming Links - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite book |last=Hess |first=Mickey |title=Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXy2wTEsbCsC&q=Gravediggaz+horrorcore&pg=PA369 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2007 |page=369 |isbn=978-0-313-33904-2}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{cite book |last=Zuberi |first=Nabeel |title=Sounds English: Transnational Popular Music |url=https://archive.org/details/soundsenglishtra00zube |url-access=registration |quote=Gravediggaz horrorcore. |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |year=2001 |page=[https://archive.org/details/soundsenglishtra00zube/page/217 217] |isbn=978-0-252-02620-1}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{cite book |last=Kulkarni |first=Neil |title=Hip Hop: Bring the Noise : the Stories Behind the Biggest Songs |url=https://archive.org/details/hiphopbringnoise0000kulk |url-access=registration |quote=Gravediggaz horrorcore. |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |year=2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/hiphopbringnoise0000kulk/page/66 66] |isbn=978-1-56025-586-4}}</ref>

The group was formed in 1994, which brought together [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]] (The Undertaker), Frukwan (The Gatekeeper), [[Anthony Ian Berkeley|Too Poetic]] (The Grym Reaper) and [[RZA]] (The RZArector). It came about largely due to the efforts of Prince Paul. Frukwan and Prince Paul were previously together in the group [[Stetsasonic]].

==Biography==
[[File:Gravediggaz-01.jpg|thumb|Gravediggaz performing in 1997]]
The group's first album was originally titled ''Niggamortis''; however, this potentially risqué title was changed to ''[[6&nbsp;Feet Deep]]'' for the American market (European versions of the album retained the original title, and also included the bonus track "Pass the Shovel"); it was released on August 9, 1994. The four members adopted ''Gravedigga'' [[alter ego]]s for their work with the group: RZA became The RZArector; Poetic became The Grym Reaper; Prince Paul became The Undertaker; and Frukwan became The Gatekeeper. In 1995, the three rhyming members (without Prince Paul) released a collaborative [[extended play|EP]] titled ''[[The Hell E.P.]]'' with English [[trip hop]] artist [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]].

The second full-length Gravediggaz album ''[[The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel]]'' was less humorous, dealing more with social and political issues; it also used calmer and more conventional production. Prince Paul played a considerably smaller role in the making of this album, with many of the production duties eventually taken care of by RZA and his [[List of Wu-Tang Clan affiliates|Wu-Tang affiliates]] (including [[True Master]] and [[4th Disciple]]).

A bootleg Gravediggaz album, named ''Scenes From The Graveyard'', surfaced in 1998. It featured seven unreleased tracks plus some remixes from the first two albums.

Gravediggaz recruited DJ Diamond J. Poetic died of [[colon cancer]] in July 2001. Frukwan stated in an interview not long after Poetic's death that a new album using leftover Poetic material would be released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altrap.com/write/?p=552 |title=INTERVIEW: Frukwan |publisher=Altrap.com |date=August 1, 2001 |access-date=April 3, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Nightmare in A-Minor]]'', the third official album, came out in 2001; it featured two of the original members, Poetic and Frukwan. The album is considered to be the group’s darkest work yet, including many references to Poetic's struggle with cancer, as well as apocalyptic themes to do with the teachings of the [[Five-Percent Nation]]. Although RZA did not take part in the album, some Wu-Tang Clan affiliates such as 4th Disciple, True Master, [[Prodigal Sunn]], [[Wu-Tang Clan affiliates#Beretta 9|Beretta 9]], and Shogun Assason were involved. The album was mostly produced by Poetic and Frukwan. A different version of the album (minus the song "Better Wake Up") was released in 2002, for which some of the tracks created by Poetic were replaced or altered.

In 2003, Frukwan released his debut solo album, ''[[Life (Frukwan album)|Life]]''. Gravediggaz’ fourth album, ''[[6&nbsp;Feet Under (album)|6 Feet Under]]'', was released in 2004 by X-Ray/Cleopatra Records and featured songs from ''[[Nightmare in A-Minor]]'' and ''[[Life (Frukwan album)|Life]]''. According to Frukwan, he had nothing to do with the release and claimed that song titles were changed without permission, making it an unauthorized release.

In 2010, Gravediggaz recorded a new song, "2 More Cups of Blood".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kujundzic |first=Petar |url=http://hypebeast.com/2010/10/rza-featuring-gravediggaz-2-more-cups-of-blood/ |title=RZA featuring Gravediggaz – 2 More Cups of Blood |publisher=Hypebeast |date=October 28, 2010 |access-date=April 3, 2012}}</ref> In 2011, it was announced that the group had been recording new tracks involving [[Shabazz the Disciple]] & [[Killah Priest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2011/05/18/gravediggaz-working-on-reunion-album-set-to-reunite-onstage/ |title=Gravediggaz Working On Reunion Album, Set To Reunite Onstage At Cage Vs Cons L.A. |publisher=ballerstatus.com |access-date=May 18, 2011}}</ref>

In 2018, the Gatekeeper released "1 Cup of Blood" under the Gravediggaz name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.7thboro.com/gatekeeper-1-cup-of-blood-stream/|title=Gatekeeper 1 Cup Of Blood (Stream)|first=Leeps Isn't|last=Dead|website=7thboro.com|access-date=December 6, 2019}}</ref>

==Style and influence==
According to Frukwan, the group's name means "digging graves of the mentally dead, and it stood for resurrecting the mentally dead from their state of unawareness and ignorance."<ref>[http://www.wu-international.com/misc_albums/Interviews/Frukwan%20Interview.htm Frukwan (Gravediggaz) Interview - &#91;Gate Keeping With Frukwan&#93; - Wu-international.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120524232908/http://www.wu-international.com/misc_albums/Interviews/Frukwan%20Interview.htm |date=May 24, 2012 }}</ref> The group's lyrics mix [[Black comedy|black humor]] (regarding topics such as [[suicide]], death, killing, [[psychopathy]], [[hell]], etc.), criticism regarding the music industry, cartoonish violence reminiscent of the [[Geto Boys]], [[Insane Poetry]], or early [[Three 6 Mafia]], and esoteric references to the [[Five-Percent Nation|Nation of Gods and Earths]]. The group pioneered the [[horrorcore]] genre.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto2"/>

Gravediggaz' irony influenced [[hardcore techno]] through Mark Newland's sampling of the group's prose in [[Nasenbluten]].
