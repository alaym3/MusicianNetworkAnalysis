The song's hook would later be reworked into "[[Don't Stop! (ATB song)|Don't Stop!]]" in 1999 for his debut album, ''[[Movin' Melodies]]'', becoming a hit in its own right.

==Musical career==
Tanneberger started his music career with the dance music group Sequential One. In February 1993, Sequential One released their debut single "Let Me Hear You", followed by "Dance"/"Raving". Singles brought them small financial benefits; André gained the opportunity to organize a mini-studio. In 1994 the band added three new members: Ulrich Poppelbaum, Woody van Eyden and vocalist Morpha. In early 1995 the House Nation label released the group's first album, ''Dance''.

After great success in his native Germany, Sequential One gradually became known elsewhere in Europe. Their second album, ''Energy'' issued in Germany, was also released in the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and Hungary. Despite this success and growing popularity, two members of the project —Woody van Eyden and Morpha — left in 1998; only André and Ullrich remained in the group. In 1999 Sequential One ceased to exist. Shortly before the collapse, André managed to release the last single "Angels" and the compilation album ''Decades''.

===1998–1999: Formation of ATB and ''Movin' Melodies''===
In 1998, Tanneberger started a solo project named ATB. His first track under this name was "9 PM (Till I Come)", included on the ''Movin' Melodies'' album, which topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1999.<ref name="Larkin90"/> The track featured a synthesised slide [[guitar]] riff that became popular.<ref name="Larkin90"/> This guitar sound became the trademark of his early hits. ATB continues to evolve and change with every album. His current style involves more vocals and varied sounds, with frequent [[piano]]s.

Despite only releasing a few more singles in the UK, namely "Don't Stop!" and "Killer", he still regularly releases music in his native Germany and in other parts of [[Europe]], where he has scored big hits such as "I Don't Wanna Stop" and his cover of [[Olive (band)|Olive's]] 1996 hit "You're Not Alone".

===2000–2001: ''Two Worlds''===
[[Two Worlds (ATB album)|''Two Worlds'']] (released in 2000) was his second studio album. It is a two-disc album based upon the concept of different types of music for different moods. The titles of the two CDs are: "The World of Movement" and "The Relaxing World". This album includes two songs featuring [[Heather Nova]]: "Love Will Find You" and "Feel You Like a River". The song "Let U Go" featured on "The World of Movement" disc featuring the vocals of Roberta Carter Harrison from the Canadian pop band [[Wild Strawberries (band)|Wild Strawberries]]. The song "Enigmatic Encounter" features music from the music project [[Enigma (German band)|Enigma]].

===2001–2002: ''Dedicated'' and ATC lawsuit===
His third album, ''Dedicated'', was released in 2002. It includes two top hits: "Hold You" and "You're Not Alone". The title refers to the [[September 11 attacks]]. In 2002 ATB successfully took the [[A Touch of Class (band)|ATC]]'s record label to court and sued and were forced to change its name to 'A Touch of Class'.

===2003: ''Addicted to Music''===
In 2003, ATB released ''Addicted to Music'', which included hits such as "I Don't Wanna Stop" and "Long Way Home". The same year, ATB's first DVD [[Addicted to Music (DVD)|of the same name]] was released. It featured all his [[Music video|videos]], a tour documentary and [[photograph]]s.

===2004: ''No Silence''===
ATB's hits "Ecstasy" and "Marrakech", both featuring vocals by [[Tiff Lacey]], were included on the album ''No Silence'' (2004). "Marrakech" was also included on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Mindhunters]]''.

===2005–2006: ''Seven Years''===
In 2005, ATB released ''Seven Years'', a [[compilation album]] of 20 songs, including all his singles. Additionally, ''Seven Years'' includes six new tracks, including the single "Humanity" with Tiff Lacey and the 2005 rework of "Let U Go". Many of ATB's recent albums have featured vocals from Roberta Carter Harrison, singer for the Canadian band [[Wild Strawberries (band)|Wild Strawberries]].

===2007-2008: ''Trilogy''===
His next album, ''[[Trilogy (ATB album)|Trilogy]]'', was released on 4 May 2007. The single "Justify" was released from ''[[The DJ 4 in the Mix]]'' compilation. The single "Renegade" was released on 12 April 2007, and features [[Heather Nova]]. The third single was "Feel Alive", released in July the same year.

In a Trance.nu interview on 11 May 2007, ATB considered "[[Don't Stop! (ATB song)|Don't Stop!]]" to be his worst production to date, and he no longer stands by it, due to it being similar to his first hit, "[[9 PM (Till I Come)]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trance.nu/v4/interviews/andr-tanneberger-atb |title=Now I do know I have some productions I really hate... the second release of ATB, which was "Don't Stop" |website=Trance.nu |access-date=2012-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512043130/http://trance.nu/v4/interviews/andr-tanneberger-atb |archive-date=2012-05-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
