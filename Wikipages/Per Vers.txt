Per Vers started rapping in 1991 appearing in the finals of rap fight held in [[Jylland]]. In 1993, he won the freestyle competition against [[Clemens (rapper)|MC Clemens]] and the late Preacherman, resulting in a long feud between Per Vers and Danish rapper MC Clemens. From 1992 to 1994, he cooperated with DJ Møller producer Langemand forming the rap group '''Sund Fornuft'''. After the band's break-up, Per Vers worked as a solo act, winning the [[MC's Fight Night]] twice in 2000 and 2001 and later on served as judge in the same competition.

Releasing many mixtape collections, his first album ''Vers 1.0''. He also toured with various artists like DJ Noize, Nappion, Luco, DJ Static and Ayoe Angelica. In 2008, he formed '''Kinski''', a rap / spoken word formation with spoken word artist Ole Omkvæd and producer Turkman Souljah releasing the album ''Vi Taler dansk'' on Per Vers' own label Mixed Ape Music.

His more recent releases include ''Ego'' and ''DNA'', the latter a big commercial success reaching number 2 on [[Tracklisten]], the official Danish Albums Chart.

Abrams'' that he co-wrote and acted in.

Per Vers' album cover for the 2011 album ''Ego'' has been famously adapted by [[Lady Gaga]] in her video release for her 2014 release "[[G.U.Y.]]" both inspired by the work "Yellow" by Lego-brick artist [[Nathan Sawaya]].<ref>[http://gaffa.dk/nyhed/82416 Gaffa.dk: Lady Gaga kopierer Per Vers] {{in lang|da}}</ref>
