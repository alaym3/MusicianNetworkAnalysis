'''Harm's Way'''{{refn|name=Name|group=N|The band often drops the apostrophe and present their name as '''HARMS WAY''' on album art, merchandise and other promotional materials for "aesthetic reasons".<ref name="toiletovhell1"/><ref name="metalsucks2"/>}} is an American [[straight edge]] [[hardcore punk]] band from [[Chicago, Illinois]], formed in 2006. The band started as a side project, but ended up becoming a more serious and full-time band in their later years. Harm's Way has since released four studio albums: ''Reality Approaches'' (2009), ''Isolation'' (2011) and ''[[Rust (album)|Rust]]'' (2015) and several EP's. On February 9, 2018, the band released their critically acclaimed Metal Blade Records debut, titled ''[[Posthuman (Harm's Way album)|Posthuman]]''. They have been recognized for their unique blend of [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and hardcore music.

==History==
In 2006,<ref name="slugmag1" /> the members of a [[straight edge]] punk band called Few and the Proud started a "side project-slash-joke"<ref name="decibel1" /> band to have fun playing short-and-fast [[powerviolence]] songs influenced by [[Crossed Out]] and [[Infest (band)|Infest]].<ref name="noisey1" /> Harm's Way drummer Chris Mills commented on the band's early days and progression, stating: "We'd play super fast powerviolence songs, and our singer would put on a mask and sing silly lyrics about beating up frat boys or whatever. Then, later as the band became more serious, we retired a lot of those elements and went in a more death metal direction—darker and less ridiculous, even if some aspects of it still weren't 100 percent serious."<ref name="decibel1" /> Harm's Way released several albums, EPs and singles through Organized Crime Records and Closed Casket Activities in their early days.

After the release of their 2011 second studio album ''Isolation'', Harm's Way emailed [[Jacob Bannon]] ([[Converge (band)|Converge]]) and his label [[Deathwish Inc.]] after hearing that he was a fan of the band's music to ask if the label would be interested in signing them.<ref name="slugmag1" /> The band's signing to Deathwish was announced in March 2013.<ref name="punknews2" /> Harm's Way released the EP ''Blinded'' on July 23, 2013 featuring artwork by [[Florian Bertmer]],<ref name="slugmag1" /> and promoted it with a music video for the track "Mind Control" followed by a world tour.<ref name="punknews2" /><ref name="punknews1" /> Mills commented on their positive relationship with the label, stating: "It's been awesome—they've been really helpful, we have a bigger budget, we were able to do a music video.  They've been willing to do anything we've really wanted. They're really supportive."<ref name="slugmag1" /> The ''Blinded'' EP also saw the band incorporating more [[Godflesh]]-influenced [[industrial metal]] into their sound.<ref name="slugmag1" /><ref name="punknews3" />

Harm's Way released its third studio album ''[[Rust (album)|Rust]]'' through Deathwish on March 10, 2015 and promoted it with a music video for the track "Amongst the Rust."<ref name="revolver1" /><ref name="decibel2" /> Commenting on the band's musical and imagery changes with ''Rust'', Mills said: "We're still locked into these niches in people's minds—you know, meathead tough guy hardcore band, Satan-worshipping death metal band, whatever. We see ''Rust'' as not just a new musical phase—we're changing up the old logo and taking a different direction with the imagery to try to steer people away from generalizations and assumptions based on stuff that really doesn't represent who we are as people or musicians."<ref name="decibel1" /> The album was met with generally positive reviews. Writing for ''[[Rock Sound]]'', Chris Hidden gave the album an eight-out-of-ten, and said: "This new record finds them in formidable form, with the likes of 'Amongst The Rust' and 'Cancerous Ways' blending the down-tuned riff attack of nu metal with groove-led thrash and the crushing intensity of hardcore to produce a sound that references everyone from [[Sepultura]] to [[Trapped Under Ice]]."<ref name="rocksound1" /> Harm's Way began touring in support of ''Rust'' with a March/April 2015 North American tour with [[Code Orange (band)|Code Orange]] and others, a May/June European tour, the European leg of Deathwish Fest and US headlining tour in July, and touring North American with [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]] in October.<ref name="decibel2" /><ref name="exclaim1" /><ref name="metalsucks1" /><ref name="exclaim2" />

On 6 December 2017, the band announced their fourth studio album, and [[Metal Blade Records]] debut, titled ''[[Posthuman (Harm's Way album)|Posthuman]]''. The record was set for release on 9 February 2018, and was produced by [[Will Putney]] at Graphic Nature Audio.<ref name="Posthuman_release-announce" /> After the album release and a February–March US tour, Luca Cimarusti wrote for the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', "...they’ve finally fully realized their fascination with [Godflesh]. ...Posthuman is one of the darkest, heaviest records you’ll hear this year."<ref name="Posthuman_Cimarusti" /> A year later, Harm's Way released a four-song EP titled ''PSTHMN'' featuring industrial remixes of songs from ''Posthuman''.<ref name="decibel3" />
