'''Wire''' are an English rock band, formed in London in October 1976<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book |first=Martin C. |last=Strong |year=2000 |title=The Great Rock Discography |edition=5th |publisher=Mojo Books |location=[[Edinburgh]] |pages=1075–1076 |isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> by [[Colin Newman]] (vocals, guitar), [[Graham Lewis]] (bass, vocals), [[Bruce Gilbert]] (guitar) and [[Robert Grey (musician)|Robert Grey]] (drums). They were originally associated with the [[punk rock]] scene, appearing on ''[[The Roxy London WC2]]'' album, and were later central to the development of [[post-punk]], while their debut album ''[[Pink Flag]]'' was influential for [[hardcore punk]].<ref name="grow">{{cite web|last=Grow|first=Kory|title=Wire Reflect on 40 Years as Punk's Ultimate Cult Band |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/wire-reflect-on-40-years-as-punks-ultimate-cult-band-128633/|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=20 March 2017|access-date=11 November 2019}}</ref>

Wire are considered a definitive [[art punk]] and post-punk band, due to their richly detailed and atmospheric sound and obscure lyrical themes. They  steadily developed from an early [[noise rock]] style to a more complex, structured sound involving increased use of guitar effects and synthesizers (1978's ''[[Chairs Missing]]'' and 1979's ''[[154 (album)|154]]''). The band gained a reputation for experimenting with song arrangements throughout their career.<ref name="allmusic_bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/wire-p5856/biography |title=Wire |author=Wilson Neate |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=15 February 2012}}</ref>

==History==
Wire's debut album ''[[Pink Flag]]'' (1977) – "perhaps the most original debut album to come out of the first wave of British punk", according to [[AllMusic]]<ref name="Pink Flag Allmusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pink-flag-r22101/review |title=Pink Flag |author=Steve Huey |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=16 February 2012}}</ref> – contains songs that are diverse in mood and style, but most use a [[minimalism|minimalist]] punk approach combined with unorthodox structures.<ref name="Trouser Press">{{cite web |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=wire |title=Wire |author1=Jim DeRogatis |author2=Wilson Neate |publisher=TrouserPress.com |access-date=16 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204040037/http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=wire |archive-date=4 February 2012}}</ref> "Field Day for the Sundays", for example, is only 28 seconds long.

Their second album, ''[[Chairs Missing]]'' (1978) marked a retreat from the stark minimalism of ''Pink Flag'', with longer, more atmospheric songs and synthesizer parts added by producer [[Mike Thorne]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/chairs-missing-r22102 |title=Chairs Missing |author=Steve Huey |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=16 February 2012}}</ref> "[[Outdoor Miner]]" was a minor hit, peaking at number 51 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="Wire singles">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/wire/ |title=WIRE &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company |website=Officialcharts.com |access-date=3 June 2016}}</ref> The experimentation was even more prominent on ''[[154 (album)|154]]'' (1979).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Creative differences split the band in 1979, leading to the ''[[Document and Eyewitness]]'' LP (1981), a recording of a live performance that featured, almost exclusively, new material, which was described as "disjointed",<ref name="Trouser Press"/> "unrecognizable as rock music" and "almost unlistenable".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/document-and-eyewitness-r22090/review |title=Document and Eyewitness |author=Wilson Neate |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=16 February 2012}}</ref> The LP came packaged with an [[Extended play|EP]] of a different performance of more new material. Some of these songs, along with others performed but not included on the album, were included on Newman's post-Wire solo albums (''5/10'', ''We Meet Under Tables''), while others were released by Gilbert's and Lewis' primary post-Wire outlet [[Dome (band)|Dome]] (''And Then...'', ''Ritual View'').

Between 1981 and 1985, Wire ceased recording and performing in favour of solo and collaborative projects such as [[Dome (band)|Dome]], Cupol, [[Daniel Miller (music producer)#Duet Emmo|Duet Emmo]] and several Colin Newman solo efforts. In 1985, the group re-formed as a "[[Popular beat combo|beat combo]]" (a joking reference to early 1960s beat music), with greater use of [[electronic musical instrument]]s. Wire announced that they would perform none of their older material, hiring The Ex-Lion Tamers (a Wire [[cover band]] named after a song title from ''Pink Flag'') as their opening act. The Ex-Lion Tamers played Wire's older songs, and Wire played their new material.<ref name="Marc Riley">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xbbmz#segments |title=Wire |publisher=bbc.co.uk |access-date=16 February 2012}}</ref>

In June 1988, Wire were part of a lineup that included [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] and [[Thomas Dolby]] supporting [[Depeche Mode]] at the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] where they played to over 60,000 people.<ref>{{Cite web|last=ckuttimecapsule|date=1988-06-29|title=Interview with Colin Newman of WIRE circa 1988|url=https://ckuttimecapsule.wordpress.com/1988/06/29/interview-with-colin-newman-of-wire-circa-1988/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=CKUT TIME CAPSULE|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-06-17|title=Video: Depeche Mode, 'A Concert for the Masses' — rare footage from 1988's '101' concert|url=http://www.slicingupeyeballs.com/2013/06/17/depeche-mode-concert-for-the-masses-25th-anniverary/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=[[Slicing Up Eyeballs]]|language=en-US}}</ref> In 1989, Wire released ''[[It's Beginning to and Back Again|IBTABA]]'', a "live" album of mostly reworked versions of songs from ''[[The Ideal Copy]]'' and ''[[A Bell Is a Cup... Until It Is Struck|A Bell Is a Cup]]'', heavily rearranged, edited, and remixed. A new song from the album, "Eardrum Buzz", was released as a single and peaked at number 68 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="Wire singles" />

Gotobed left the band in 1990, after the release of the album ''[[Manscape]]''. After his departure, the band dropped one letter from its name, becoming "Wir" (still pronounced "wire"), and released ''[[The First Letter]]'' in 1991. There followed a further period of solo recordings, during which Newman founded the [[swim ~]] label, and later [[Githead]] with his wife (ex-[[Minimal Compact]] bassist [[Malka Spigel]]), while Wire remained an occasional collaboration. It was not until 1999 that Wire again became a full-time entity.

With Gotobed back in the line-up (now using his birth name, Robert Grey), the group initially reworked much of their back catalogue for a performance at [[Royal Festival Hall]] in 2000. Wire's reception during a short tour in early May of the US, and a number of UK gigs, convinced the band to continue. Two EPs and an album, ''[[Send (album)|Send]]'' (2003), followed, as well as collaborations with stage designer [[Es Devlin]] and artists [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.projectdark.demon.co.uk/DJK/wire.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031205113845/http://www.projectdark.demon.co.uk/DJK/wire.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 December 2003 |title=Wire + Jake & Dinos Chapman + ES Devlin with Kirsten Reynolds (Project Dark) |publisher=projectdark.demon.co.uk |access-date=16 February 2012}}</ref>
In 2006, Wire's 1970s albums were remastered and re-released with the original vinyl track listings. A third ''Read & Burn'' EP was released in November 2007.

[[File:Matt Simms sep 2013.jpg|thumb|Matt Simms, 2013]]A full-length album of new material entitled ''[[Object 47]]'' was released in July 2008. Bruce Gilbert was not involved in this recording, although, according to Newman, he did feature in a minimal capacity on the third ''Read and Burn'' EP.

In January 2011, Wire released ''[[Red Barked Tree]]'', which according to the band's press release "rekindles a lyricism sometimes absent from Wire's previous work and reconnects with the live energy of performance, harnessed and channelled from extensive touring over the past few years".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pinkflag.com (the official Wire website) - Press - Red Barked Tree|url=http://pinkflag.com/press/red-barked-tree/|access-date=2020-08-28|website=pinkflag.com}}</ref> The album was written and recorded by Newman, Lewis and Grey, but speaking to [[Marc Riley]] on the day of the release, Newman introduced as "a new boy" guitarist [[Matthew Simms|Matt Simms]] (from It Hugs Back), who had been a touring member with the band since April 2010.<ref name="Marc Riley"/>

In March 2013 the band released ''[[Change Becomes Us]]'', their 13th studio album, which was very well received.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/wire-change-becomes-us-pink-flag/ | title=Wire, ''Change Becomes Us'' (Pink Flag) | author=Gubbels, Jason | work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | date=28 March 2013 | access-date=30 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17720-wire-change-becomes-us/ | title=Wire – ''Change Becomes Us'' | publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] | date=2 April 2013 | access-date=2 April 2013 | author=Wolk, Douglas}}</ref> Their fourteenth album, eponymously titled ''[[Wire (2015 album)|Wire]]'', was released in April 2015. The following year, in April 2016, the band's 15th studio album, entitled ''[[Nocturnal Koreans]],'' was released on their label Pinkflag. It consisted of eight songs recorded during the sessions for their previous album, but were cut from the track listing. [[Stereogum]] named ''Nocturnal Koreans'' the Album of the Week. Reviews for the album were mostly positive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1872193/album-of-the-week-wire-nocturnal-koreans/franchises/album-of-the-week/|title=Album Of The Week: Wire Nocturnal Koreans|date=19 April 2016|access-date=12 August 2016}}</ref> In 2017 Wire celebrated 40 years since their debut gig on 1 April 1977 by releasing their 16th studio album ''[[Silver/Lead]]'' and headlining the Los Angeles edition of their DRILL : FESTIVAL.

==Influence==
Wire's influence has outshone their comparatively modest record sales. In the 1980s and 1990s, Big Black, [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://louderthanwar.com/mike-watt-stoogesminutemen-bass-genius-exclusive-interview/ |title=Mike Watt, Stooges/Minutemen Bass Genius, Exclusive Interview |last1=Adams |first1=Owen |date=26 June 2011 |publisher=Louder Than War|access-date=25 April 2013}}</ref> and [[Sonic Youth]]<ref name="soundci">{{cite web|title='Sound City Liverpool onstage interview|url=https://soundcloud.com/dave-8-2/thurston-moore-2|publisher=Soundcloud.com|access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> all expressed a fondness for the group. Minutemen bassist [[Mike Watt]] described their influence as key saying of ''Pink Flag'' "I don't know what we would have sounded like if we didn't hear it."<ref name="grow"/>

{{quote|"And the sound was incredible," he continues. "It was like that NYC band Richard Hell and the Voidoids without the studio gimmickry, but Wire was way more 'econo' with the instrumentation and the radical approach to song structure. And the way Wire wrote words were artistic without being elitist; some of the slang was trippy, too. All the 'old' conventions from all the other 'old' bands went out the window after we heard Wire. They were big-time liberating on us."<ref name="grow"/>}}

Wire were influential on American [[hardcore punk]]. Fans included [[Ian MacKaye]] of [[Minor Threat]] and [[Henry Rollins]],<ref name="grow" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://henryrollins.com/kcrw/detail/kcrw_broadcast_144_121011/|title=KCRW BROADCAST No. 144 12–10–11|author=Henry Rollins|author-link=Henry Rollins|publisher=henryrollins.com|access-date=16 February 2012}}</ref> formerly of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]].

Rollins, as Henrietta Collins & The Wife-Beating Childhaters, covered "Ex Lion Tamer" on the EP ''[[Drive by Shooting]]''. [[Michael Azerrad]] reported, in the book ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'', that at Minor Threat's second gig, each of the seven bands on the roster performed a version of a Wire song.<ref>{{cite book|title=Our Band Could Be Your Life|title-link=Our Band Could Be Your Life|author=Michael Azerrad|year=2001|isbn=0-316-78753-1|oclc=50483014|author-link=Michael Azerrad}}</ref> [[Big Black]] covered Wire's "Heartbeat" twice, once as a studio version that was released as a single (also included on ''[[The Rich Man's Eight Track Tape]]'' compilation) and also as a live version, featuring Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis, included on the VHS version of the live album ''[[Pigpile]]''.

[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] included Wire in their 1996 list of 100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years, stating that "as long as there are listeners equally lured by tough, intelligent riffs and fearless experimentalism, Wire will remain a crucial benchmark."<ref name="ap-11-100-1996">{{cite journal |last1=Kappes |first1=John |editor=Michael Shea |title=100 Underground Inspirations of the Past 20 Years |journal=Alternative Press |date=1996 |volume=11 |issue=100 |pages=39-56 |publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc. |location=Cleveland, OH |issn=1065 1667}}</ref>
