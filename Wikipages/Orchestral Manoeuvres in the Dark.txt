'''Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark''' ('''OMD''') are<!--OMD are an English band, so this article is written in British English. See [[WP:ENGVAR]].--> an English [[electronic music|electronic]] band formed in [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], [[Merseyside]], in 1978. The group consists of co-founders [[Andy McCluskey]] (vocals, bass guitar) and [[Paul Humphreys]] (keyboards, vocals), along with [[Martin Cooper (musician)|Martin Cooper]] (various instruments) and [[Stuart Kershaw]] (drums); McCluskey has been the only constant member. Regarded as pioneers of electronic music, OMD combined an [[Experimental music|experimental]], [[Minimal music|minimalist]] ethos with pop sensibilities, becoming central figures in the late-1970s/early-1980s emergence of [[synth-pop]].

McCluskey and Humphreys led precursor group [[The Id (band)|the Id]] from 1977–1978, and re-recorded their track "[[Electricity (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Electricity]]" as OMD's debut single in 1979. Weathering an "uncool" image and a degree of hostility from music critics, the band gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 [[List of anti-war songs|anti-war song]] "[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]", and achieved broader recognition via ''[[Architecture & Morality]]'' (1981) and its three hit singles. Although later reappraised, ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'' (1983) was seen as overly challenging, and eroded European support. The group embraced a more radio-friendly sound on ''[[Junk Culture]]'' (1984); this change in direction led to greater success in the United States, and yielded the 1986 hit, "[[If You Leave (song)|If You Leave]]".

In 1989, creative differences saw Humphreys and other members form the spin-off band [[the Listening Pool]], leaving McCluskey the only remaining member of OMD. The group returned with a new line-up and explored the [[dance-pop]] genre: ''[[Sugar Tax (album)|Sugar Tax]]'' (1991) and its initial singles were hits in Europe. By the mid-1990s, however, electronic music had been supplanted by [[alternative rock]], and both OMD and the Listening Pool disbanded in 1996. McCluskey later conceived pop [[girl group]] [[Atomic Kitten]], for whom he served as a principal songwriter, while Humphreys formed the duo [[Onetwo (band)|Onetwo]] alongside [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]] vocalist [[Claudia Brücken]].

In 2006, the band reformed with Humphreys and McCluskey working on material closer in sound to their early output; ''[[The Punishment of Luxury (album)|The Punishment of Luxury]]'' (2017) was the group's seventh top 10 entry on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. They have also achieved 12 top 20 hits on the [[UK Singles Chart]], as well as three top 20 hits on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. An influence on many later artists, OMD have sold over 40 million records worldwide.

In September 1977, McCluskey and Humphreys put together the seven-piece (three singers, two guitarists, bassist, drummer, and keyboard player) Wirral group [[the Id]], whose line-up included drummer [[Malcolm Holmes]] and McCluskey's girlfriend Julia Kneale on vocals. The group began to gig regularly in the [[Merseyside]] area, performing original material (largely written by McCluskey and Humphreys). They had quite a following on the scene, and one of their tracks ("Julia's Song") was included on a compilation record of local bands called ''Street to Street.''<ref name="faq2"/><ref name="familytree">''Pete Frame's Rock Family Trees'', 1993</ref> Meanwhile, Humphreys and McCluskey collaborated on a side project called VCL XI, whose name was adapted from a diagram on the back cover of Kraftwerk's ''[[Radio-Activity]]'' album, reading "VCL 11". This project allowed them to pursue their more obscure electronic experiments.<ref name="faq2"/>

In August 1978, the Id split due to musical differences. The same month, McCluskey joined Wirral electronic outfit [[Dalek I Love You]] as lead singer, but quit in September.<ref name="familytree"/> Later that month, he rejoined Humphreys and their VCL XI project was renamed Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The name was gleaned from a list of song lyrics and ideas that were written on McCluskey's bedroom wall;<ref name=Lindgren/> and was chosen so they would not be mistaken for a [[punk music|punk]] band.<ref>''Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to How Band Names Were Formed'', Dave Wilson, 2004, p. 58</ref><ref name="Rexroat1988">{{cite news|first=Dee Ann|last=Rexroat|title=OMD maneuvering its way to American success|work=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=13 May 1988|page=36 (''Weekend!'', p. 2C)}}</ref> Given that OMD intended to play only one gig, the duo considered their moniker to be inconsequential.<ref name="breakfast2010"/> McCluskey has since expressed regret over choosing "such a very silly name".<ref name="Rexroat1988"/> The contrasting personalities of Humphreys and McCluskey established the band's dynamic, with the former saying that "two Pauls wouldn't get anything done and two Andys would kill each other."<ref>{{cite news |first= Elisa|last= Bray|title= Our friends electric: Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/our-friends-electric-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-8560409.html|newspaper= [[The Independent]]|date= 5 April 2013|access-date=28 January 2016}}</ref> They have further described their creative roles as "The Surgeon" (Humphreys) and "The Butcher" (McCluskey).<ref name="Earls2020"/> As [[working class]] youngsters OMD had a limited budget, using second-hand "junk-shop" instruments including a left-handed bass guitar (which McCluskey would play upside-down).<ref name="HumphreysNeedle">{{cite episode|title=Paul Humphreys|series=Neil McCormick's Needle Time|network=[[Vintage TV (TV channel)|Vintage TV]]|date=21 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/omd-our-whole-raison-detre-try-ask-musical-questions-815155|title=OMD: 'Our whole raison d'etre is to try to ask musical questions'|last=Seaman|first=Duncan|date=17 October 2019|website=[[The Yorkshire Post]]|access-date=6 July 2021}}</ref> The pair also created their own devices, with Humphreys "making things out of his aunt's radios cannibalised for the circuit boards".<ref name="HumphreysNeedle"/><ref name="RC19">{{cite web|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/omd|title=OMD|last=Wilson|first=Lois|date=30 September 2019|website=[[Record Collector]]|access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> Eventually they acquired a basic [[Korg]] M-500 Micro Preset synthesizer, purchased via McCluskey's mother's mail-order catalogue for £7.76 a week, paid over 36 weeks.<ref name="1981CH5">{{Cite episode|title=1981|series=Britain's Favourite 80s Songs|network=[[Channel 5 (British TV channel)|Channel 5]]|date=5 March 2021|season=2|number=2|minutes=6–9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/80s-music-group-omd-no-7911483|title=Why 80s music group OMD are no museum pieces|last=Wright|first=Jade|date=10 October 2014|website=[[Liverpool Echo]]|access-date=6 July 2021}}</ref>

OMD began to gig regularly as a duo, performing to backing tracks played from a [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 4-track tape-recorder christened "Winston" (after the antihero of [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''). Their debut performance was in October 1978 at [[Eric's Club]] in Liverpool.<ref name="RC19"/> Finding themselves on the cusp of an electronic new wave in British pop-music, they released a one-off single, [[Electricity (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|"Electricity"]], with independent label [[Factory Records]]. The track was supposed to be produced by the Factory Records producer [[Martin Hannett]]. However, the A-side was the band's original demo produced by their friend, owner of Winston and soon to be manager, Paul Collister<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd-messages.co.uk/electricity/|title=Electricity|last=Browne|first=Paul|date=15 November 2011|website=Messages|access-date=30 April 2021}}</ref> under the pseudonym Chester Valentino (taken from a nightclub called Valentino's in the nearby city of [[Chester]]). The single's sleeve was designed by [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]], whose distinctive graphics contributed to OMD's public image into the 1980s.<ref name="faq2"/><ref name="Lindores"/> The success of "Electricity" led to the band receiving a seven-album record deal with [[Dindisc]], worth over £250,000.<ref name=Lindgren/><ref name="RC19"/>

In 1979 they were asked to support [[Gary Numan]] on his first major British tour. Humphreys noted, "[Numan] gave us our first big break. He saw us opening for [[Joy Division]] and he asked us to go on tour with him... we went from the small clubs to playing huge arenas.

Rather than hire studio time to record their eponymous [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (album)|debut album]] (1980), McCluskey and Humphreys used their [[advance payment]] from Dindisc to build their own Liverpool [[recording studio]], The Gramophone Suite. They predicted that they would be dropped by the label due to disappointing sales, but would at least own a studio.<ref name="RC19"/> The album showcased the band's live set at the time, and included some guest drums from Id drummer [[Malcolm Holmes]] and saxophone from Wirral musician [[Martin Cooper (musician)|Martin Cooper]].

The second album ''[[Organisation (album)|Organisation]]'' (a reference to the band which preceded Kraftwerk,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2010/09/28/omd-history-of-modern-album-release/|title=Synthesized Past: 'History of Modern,' OMD|last=Porter|first=Christopher|date=28 September 2010|website=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=12 June 2021}}</ref> founded by Kraftwerk's original members Florian Schneider-Esleben and Ralf Hütter) followed later that year, recorded as a three-piece with Humphreys, McCluskey and Holmes. It was again produced by Howlett, and had a moodier, dark feel largely inspired by the passing of former Factory label-mate, and [[Joy Division]] singer, [[Ian Curtis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.omd.uk.com/discography/organisation/|title=Organisation|publisher=OMD|access-date=30 April 2021}}</ref> The album included the hit single "[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]", named after [[Enola Gay|the plane that dropped an atomic bomb]] on Hiroshima.<ref name="AMbio"/> The song was intended to be included on the debut album, but was left out at the final selection. The tour for this album had a four-piece band line-up, with saxophonist Martin Cooper (another [[Dalek I Love You]] alumnus) recruited for keyboard duties and enlisted as an official group member.<ref name="Lindores"/> The McCluskey/Humphreys/Cooper/Holmes unit came to be regarded as the band's classic line-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/04/04/omd-tour-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-on-the-road-again/2049903/|title=On the Road Again: Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|author-link=Brian Mansfield|date=4 April 2013|website=[[USA Today]]|access-date=10 June 2021}}</ref> In early 1981, readers of ''[[Record Mirror]]'' voted OMD the fourth-best band and eigth-best live act of 1980;<ref>{{cite magazine|date=10 January 1981|title=1980 Poll Results|magazine=[[Record Mirror]]|page=16}}</ref> ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' readers named the group the eighth and 10th best new act of the year, respectively.<ref>West, p. 26</ref> In ''[[Smash Hits]]'', they were voted both the fifth-best band of 1980 and the eighth-hottest new act for 1981.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5–18 March 1981|title=The Smash Hits Readers' Poll Results|magazine=[[Smash Hits]]|volume=3|number=5|page=20}}</ref>

Howlett then presided over the recording of a further hit single, "[[Souvenir (song)|Souvenir]]", co-written by Cooper & Humphreys. It ushered in a lush choral electronic sound.

The album's sound saw OMD's original synth-pop sound augmented by the [[Mellotron]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electricityclub.co.uk/tag/paul-humphreys/|title=Paul Humphreys Archives - Page 4 of 5|website=Electricityclub.co.uk|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref> an instrument previously associated with [[prog rock]] bands. They used it to add atmospheric swatches of string, choir, and other sounds to their palette. Two more hit singles "Joan of Arc" and "[[Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)|Maid of Orleans]]" (which became the biggest-selling single of 1982 in Germany<ref name="stanley">Stanley, Bob.

In 1983 the band lost commercial momentum somewhat, with the release of their more experimental ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'' album, produced by Rhett Davies. The record mixed melancholy synth ballads and uptempo synth-pop with [[musique concrète]] and short wave radio tape collages. Its relative commercial failure caused a crisis of confidence for Humphreys and McCluskey and brought about a deliberate move towards the mainstream.<ref name="stanley"/> 1984's ''[[Junk Culture]]'' was a shift to a more pop-style sound and the band used digital sampling keyboards such as the [[Fairlight CMI]] and the E-mu Emulator. The album was a success, reassuring the group about their new direction.<ref name="AMbio"/> The "[[Locomotion (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Locomotion]]" single returned the group to the top five in the UK and was an indicator of the group's newfound sound, notably the adoption of a classic [[verse–chorus form]], which is something the group had often previously avoided. ''Record Mirror'' readers named OMD the eighth-best live act of 1984.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5 January 1985|title=Readers Poll Winners: 1984|magazine=[[Record Mirror]]|page=15}}</ref> In 1985, the band expanded to a sextet, adding brothers Graham Weir (guitar, keyboards, trombone) and Neil Weir (trumpet, bass guitar), and released ''[[Crush (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark album)|Crush]]'', produced by [[Stephen Hague]] in Paris and New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1985-12-14-2494435-story.html|title=OMD: British Synth Band Maneuvers Its Way Onto American Radio|last=Righi|first=Len|date=14 December 1985|website=[[The Morning Call]]|access-date=30 April 2021|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210427140657/https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1985-12-14-2494435-story.html|archive-date=27 April 2021|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The success of the single "[[So in Love (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|So in Love]]" in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] also led to some success for the [[LP album|LP]] which entered the [[American Top 40]], establishing the group in the US. During this period, the band also recorded a version of "So in Love" in duet with the French pop singer [[Etienne Daho]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXMBXgKpkcg|title=OMD & Etienne Daho - So in love|website=Etienne Daho at YouTube}}</ref>

Later in 1985 the band were asked to write a song for the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] film ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''. They offered "Goddess of Love", although the ending of the film was re-shot due to a negative response from test audiences. OMD then wrote "[[If You Leave (song)|If You Leave]]" in less than 24 hours<ref name=Lindgren/> and it became a top 5 hit in the US, Canada, and New Zealand in 1986. At the end of this year, the same six piece line-up also released ''[[The Pacific Age]]'', but the band began to see their critical and public popularity wane notably in the UK. The album's first single, "[[(Forever) Live and Die]]", was a top 10 hit across Europe<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/song/OMD-(Orchestral-Manoeuvres-In-The-Dark)/(Forever)-Live-And-Die-1517|title=OMD (Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark) - (Forever) Live And Die|website=Hitparade.ch}}</ref> and entered the top 20 in both the UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/(forever)-live-and-die/|title=(forever) live and die &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref> and US. Journalist [[Hugo Lindgren]] argued that the success of "If You Leave" has concealed from US audiences the group's history of making innovative music.<ref name=Lindgren/>

During 1988 OMD played a support slot for [[Depeche Mode]]'s [[Music for the Masses Tour]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California on 18 June 1988. They also released the top 20 US hit "[[Dreaming (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Dreaming]]" and a successful greatest hits album, ''[[The Best of OMD]]''. Graham and Neil Weir left the band at the end of the 1988 US tour.

As OMD appeared poised to consolidate their US success, the group continued to fracture. Humphreys departed in 1989 amid personal and creative dissension with McCluskey.<ref name="Majewski2014"/> Cooper and Holmes then left OMD to join Humphreys in founding a new band called [[the Listening Pool]].<ref name="AMbio"/><ref name="Fisher2013">{{cite web|url=https://www.prsformusic.com/m-magazine/features/omd-english-electric/|title=OMD, English Electric|last=Fisher|first=Kyle|date=8 April 2013|website=[[PRS for Music]]|access-date=30 April 2021}}</ref> McCluskey recalled, "We were all in agreement that something was wrong. How to fix it was where we disagreed."<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Pendras|title=Former Blasters' guitarist finds his own success|work=[[North County Times|North County Blade-Citizen]]|date=4 October 1991|page=64 (13A)}}</ref>

This left only McCluskey to carry on, essentially becoming a solo artist working under the OMD banner. McCluskey's first album from the new OMD was the [[dance-pop]] ''[[Sugar Tax (album)|Sugar Tax]]'' album in May 1991, which charted at No.&nbsp;3 in the UK. McCluskey recruited in 1989 Liverpool musicians Raw Unlimited (Lloyd Massett, [[Stuart Kershaw]], Nathalie Loates) as collaborators for the making of ''Sugar Tax'': writing credits carefully distinguished between songs written by OMD (i.e., McCluskey) and songs written by OMD/Kershaw/Massett.<ref>''Sugar Tax'' liner notes. 1991. Virgin Records.</ref> This iteration of the group was initially successful with hits like "[[Sailing on the Seven Seas]]" and "[[Pandora's Box (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Pandora's Box]]", with lesser success on fellow chart entries, "[[Call My Name (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Call My Name]]" and "[[Then You Turn Away]]". McCluskey's live band was then formed by [[Nigel Ipinson]] (keyboards), Phil Coxon (keyboards), and Abe Juckes (drums) from late 1990. ''[[Smash Hits]]'' readers voted OMD the sixth-best British group of 1991.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=30 October 1981 – 12 November 1991|title=The Smash Hits Readers Poll 1991|magazine=[[Smash Hits]]|volume=13|number=21|page=12}}</ref>

The album ''[[Liberator (album)|Liberator]]'', which ventured further into dance territory, was released in 1993.<ref name="Evans2004"/> It peaked at No. 14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Lead single "[[Stand Above Me]]" peaked at no. 21 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], with follow-up "[[Dream of Me (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Dream of Me]]" charting at no. 24. Paul Humphreys, while no longer part of the group, co-wrote the single "[[Everyday (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Everyday]]" (a No. 59 UK chart entry). The fifth track from ''Liberator'', "[[Dream of Me (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Dream of Me]]", was built around a sample from "[[Love's Theme]]" by [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]], a track which was written and produced by [[Barry White]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.omd.uk.com/discography/liberator/ |title=Liberator |website=Omd.uk.com |access-date=18 May 2017 }}</ref> To release the "Dream of Me" track as an OMD single, however, McCluskey had to agree that the single release of the track would remove the actual "Love's Theme" sample, but still be officially titled "Dream of Me (Based on Love's Theme)", and furthermore would still give a writing credit to White.<ref>''Liberator'' liner notes. 1993. Virgin Records.</ref>

Also in 1993, McCluskey made contributions to the ''[[Esperanto (Elektric Music album)|Esperanto]]'' album, a project by former [[Kraftwerk]] member [[Karl Bartos]] (then working under the moniker of Elektric Music).<ref>{{Cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r251361/review|pure_url=yes}} |title= Esperanto > Review |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |first=Alex |last=Henderson |accessdate=30 April 2021}}</ref>

McCluskey returned with a rotating cast of musicians for the more organic ''[[Universal (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark album)|Universal]]'' (1996),<ref name="RC19"/> which featured two songs co-written by Humphreys as well as a holdover from the ''Esperanto'' sessions, co-penned by Bartos. The record spawned OMD's first Top 20 hit in five years, "[[Walking on the Milky Way (song)|Walking on the Milky Way]]".

Though both ''Liberator'' and ''Universal'' produced minor hits, McCluskey retired the OMD name in late 1996, due to waning public interest. A particular source of frustration was the modest commercial response to "[[Walking on the Milky Way (song)|Walking on the Milky Way]]", over which McCluskey said he "sweated blood", considering it "about as good a song as I could write". [[BBC Radio 1]] refused to playlist the song, which in turn led to high street store [[Woolworths Group (United Kingdom)|Woolworths]] refusing to stock it. McCluskey said, "I just thought: 'Screw this, I'm not going to bang my head against a brick wall'."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/nov/23/artsfeatures2|title=The power behind pop|author=Alexis Petridis|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=30 August 2016}}</ref> A second [[The OMD Singles|singles album]] was released in 1998, along with an [[Extended play|EP]] of remixed material by such acts as [[Sash!]] and [[Moby]].

Post-1996, McCluskey decided to focus on songwriting for such Liverpool based acts as [[Atomic Kitten]] and the Genie Queen, and trying to develop new Merseyside artists from his Motor Museum recording studio. With McCluskey focusing his talents elsewhere, Humphreys decided to work with his new musical partner [[Claudia Brücken]], of the [[ZTT]] bands [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]] and [[Act (band)|Act]], as [[Onetwo (band)|Onetwo]]. He also undertook a US live tour under the banner of "Paul Humphreys from OMD".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Electropop (no. 5: Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark)|series=Top Ten|station=[[Channel 4]]|date=7 April 2001}}</ref>

===2006–2012: Reformation and comeback===
[[File:20180728_Köln_Amphi_Festival_OMD_0100.jpg|thumb|right|200px|McCluskey performing the "Trainee Teacher Dance"]]
An unexpected request to perform from a German television show led the group to reunite.<ref name=Lindgren/> On 1 January 2006, Andy McCluskey announced plans to reform OMD with the McCluskey, Humphreys, Holmes, and Cooper line-up. The original plan was to tour the album ''[[Architecture & Morality]]'' and other pre-1983 material, then record a new album set for release in 2007. In May 2007, the ''Architecture & Morality'' remastered CD was re-released together with a DVD featuring the Drury Lane concert from 1981 that had previously been available on VHS. Through May and June, the band toured with the "classic" line up of McCluskey, Humphreys, Holmes and Cooper. They began their set with a re-ordered but otherwise complete re-staging of the ''Architecture & Morality'' album. The second half of each concert featured a selection of their best known hits.<ref>''OMD Live: Architecture & Morality & More''. 2008. Eagle Records.</ref>

In Spring 2008, a live CD and DVD of the 2007 tour, ''[[OMD Live: Architecture & Morality & More]]'', recorded at the London Hammersmith Apollo, was released as was a 25th anniversary re-release of ''Dazzle Ships'', including six bonus tracks. At the same time, a brief October 2008 tour was announced, partly to tie-in with the ''Dazzle Ships'' album's 25th anniversary. [[China Crisis]] supported OMD on this tour.

In June 2009, an orchestral concert with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]] was given in Liverpool. A recording of this concert was released on DVD in December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd.uk.com/html/news.html|title=OMD News: December 2009|access-date=9 December 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209072424/http://www.omd.uk.com/html/news.html|archive-date=9 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In November and December, the band returned to arena touring as support for [[Simple Minds]]. OMD had performed with [[Night of the Proms]] in December 2006 in Germany and renewed the experience again in Belgium and the Netherlands that year. They were the headline act at Britain's first [[Vintage Computer Festival]] at [[The National Museum of Computing]], Bletchley Park, in June 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10364135 | work=BBC News | title=Vintage computers inspire next generation of scientists | date=21 June 2010}}</ref> On 9 September 2010, [[Trevor Horn]] announced that OMD would perform as a special guest at the "first ever gig" of [[the Buggles]].<ref name="Horn10">{{cite web|url=http://www.trevorhorn.com/news/omd_to_support_the_buggles_on.html|title=OMD to support The Buggles on 28.09.10|date=8 September 2010|website=TrevorHorn.com|access-date=13 December 2010}}</ref> Their 11th studio album, ''[[History of Modern]]'', was released in September, reaching No.&nbsp;28 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].

In March 2011, OMD played their first North American tour as the original line up since 1988. In September, the band appeared at the [[Electric Picnic]] 2011 festival in Stradbally, Co Laois, Ireland. In November 2011, OMD announced they were getting back to the studio to start work on their latest album, ''[[English Electric (album)|English Electric]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd.uk.com/entry/next_album|title=OMD Blog: Next Album|access-date=25 April 2012|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206052122/http://www.omd.uk.com/entry/next_album|archive-date=6 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 12 March 2012, the band played a concert at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Quezon City]], Philippines. In August, OMD performed to South African audiences in Cape Town and Johannesburg.
