==Film==
Hill was said to be working on an original feature film in 2013, which was confirmed to feature late actress [[Karen Black]] in a leading role.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151022211654/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=susTeQpgR9k] </ref> However, she had died before the film could come into full fruition. A shortened excerpt of the footage was posted on the Death Grips YouTube account in October 2015 in a 15-minute video entitled Bottomless Pit.
