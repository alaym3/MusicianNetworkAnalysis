The single was one of the year's biggest radio hits, after being played first in the UK on the [[Dermot O'Leary]] Show on [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], along with their first live radio session.

Their debut album ''[[Twelve Stops and Home]]'' was released in the UK on 5 June 2006 and on 27 February 2007 in the [[United States|US]].

==History==
===1995–2005: Formation and early years===
[[File:TheFeeling.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Dan Gillespie Sells]] with The Feeling at the [[Marquee Club]], [[Leicester Square]], London, February 2005]]
The majority of the band are from [[Horsham]], [[Sussex]], with the exception of [[lead vocalist]] [[Dan Gillespie Sells]], who is from London, and bassist [[Richard Jones (bassist)|Richard Jones]], who is from [[Forest Row]], in [[Sussex]]. The Jeremiahs and Stewart met while attending [[St Wilfrid's Catholic School, Crawley]], [[Sussex]]. Sells and Jones met as music students at the [[BRIT School]] in [[Croydon]] in 1995. They were members of one of the school's most popular bands. Other past students of the BRIT school include [[Jessie J]], [[Adele]], [[Tara McDonald]] and [[The Kooks]].

The band members worked as [[session musician]]s for several years before coming together as a group.<ref name="Loundras">Loundras, Alexia (2006) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104083101/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-feeling-a-band-with-a-passion-for-pop-525890.html The Feeling: A band with a passion for pop]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 February 2006, retrieved 6 September 2009</ref>  The Feeling has its roots in a covers band called ''Superfly'', which Paul Stewart and Ciaran and Kevin Jeremiah played in, and which also acted as the house band on the [[Richard Blackwood]] show. They spent a lot of time performing as resident band at the [[La Tania]] ski resort in the [[Alps]] before their début doing covers (such as "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]" by [[The Buggles]] and "[[Raining Blood]]" by [[Slayer]]), and after the line-up of The Feeling had been completed, they continued to use the name ''Superfly'', as it was easier to get bookings.<ref name="Leahy">Leahy, Andrew "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p818964/biography|pure_url=yes}} The Feeling Biography]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefeeling.com/blog/index.php?id=509|access-date=11 November 2008|title=Blog entry|publisher=thefeeling.com}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> 

It was later revealed in a [[podcast]] for ''[[The Times]]'' that the band had "blagged" their way into the La Tania residency, saying they could perform fifty songs when in fact they only knew six.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article720521.ece|title=That loving Feeling|work=[[The Times]]|date=27 January 2006|access-date=11 November 2008|last=Paphides|first=Pete|location=London}}</ref> The last gigs in the Alps were in the winter of 2004. After these gigs they would sell demo CDs, which included the tracks "Funny Cigarette", "Sun Is Shining", "Still You Want More", "[[Never Be Lonely]]" and "[[Join with Us (song)|Join with Us]]". Most of these tracks have since been released as singles, album tracks, or B-sides.

===2006–2007: ''Twelve Stops and Home''===
According to Island A&R, Louis Bloom, a particularly underwhelming industry showcase gig prompted various record company representatives in attendance to pass on the band.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Bloom.html |title=Interview With Louis Bloom |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=4 April 2011 |access-date=18 April 2011}}</ref> However, following the performance their manager Adrian Jolly phoned up Bloom and persuaded him to ignore the disastrous gig and instead listen to the band's demos. The demos - which featured all the eventual singles from the debut album - convinced the Island A&R to sign the band, who singled out the songwriting in particular as being "fantastic".<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>   

On 5 June 2006, The Feeling released their debut album, ''[[Twelve Stops and Home]]'', which reached #2 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="CS" /> To celebrate the release, the band's record company, [[Island Records]], took 120 British music journalists on the [[Eurostar]] to [[Paris]] for the day, where the band performed live in a restaurant. This was in recognition of the fact the band took their name from a Parisian bar.

The first single, "[[Sewn (song)|Sewn]]" reached #7 on the UK charts in March 2006, followed by the top ten hit "[[Fill My Little World]]" in May 2006.<ref name="CS">{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/|title=The Feeling|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> The release spent four consecutive weeks at #16 and outsold the band's debut single. "[[Never Be Lonely]]" was released in August 2006 and became their third top ten hit, peaking at #9, where it stayed for two weeks.<ref name="CS" />

In 2006, The Feeling toured the United States, opening for [[The Fray (band)|The Fray]] and strengthening their following across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. They sold an [[Extended play|EP]] named ''[[Four Stops and Home]]'' along the way. It consisted of two album tracks "Sewn" and "Helicopter" and two future B-sides "When I Return" and "All You Need To Do". In November 2006, just days after returning from the US, the band headed off on their first major UK and Ireland tour, playing at [[Birmingham]], [[London]], [[Cambridge]], [[Brighton]], [[Oxford]], [[Southampton]], [[Cardiff]], [[Bristol]], [[Manchester]], [[Nottingham]], [[Liverpool]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Glasgow]], [[Leeds]], [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Colothan, Scott | year = 2006 | title = The Feeling announce UK tour | url = https://www.gigwise.com/news/19584/The-Feeling-Announce-UK-Tour | publisher = Gigwise | access-date = 2021-01-29}}</ref>{{cn|date=April 2018}}

"[[Fill My Little World]]" was used in the farewell montage on the last ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'' on New Year's Day 2007 and an edited version of "Love It When You Call" appeared in the 2007 film ''[[Good Luck Chuck]]''. At the end of March 2007, the band went Stateside once again, taking part in [[VH1]]'s first ever "You Oughta Know" tour alongside [[Mat Kearney]] and [[Rocco DeLuca|Rocco DeLuca and The Burden]]. The tour lasted approximately two months, and finished with The Feeling playing the 2007 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] festival in Indio, California.

The band also headlined a mini-tour of the UK's forests around June 2007. They played at large clearings and forest activity sites, near their own homes, leading Gillespie-Sells to quip about playing to elves.<ref>"[http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-6y8kzq Forestry Commission - The Feeling live at Westonbirt Delamere and Cannock Chase]", Forestry Commission</ref>

In an e-mail newsletter released on 11 January 2007, it was announced that The Feeling was the most played band on UK radio in 2006. Their four singles received a total of 97,436 plays, which meant that, on average, a song by The Feeling was played 267 times every day, or once every 5 minutes.<ref name="Mulholland">Mulholland, Garry (2008) "[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/17/popandrock.shopping14 The Feeling, Join With Us]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 17 February 2008, retrieved 6 September 2009</ref>

===2007–2008: ''Join with Us''===
[[File:Kevin Jeremiah.jpg|thumb|240px|Kevin Jeremiah in 2008]]
Their second album, entitled ''[[Join with Us (album)|Join with Us]]'' was released on 18 February 2008, with the first single "[[I Thought It Was Over]]" entering the UK charts at #12 on 10 February 2008 on the strength of downloads alone.<ref name="CS" /> The album debuted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref name="CS" />

The majority of the album was recorded at the [[Maiden Bradley#Bradley House|Bradley House]]—a stately home in [[Maiden Bradley]] near [[Warminster]], [[Wiltshire]] (home of the [[Duke of Somerset]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradleyhouse.org/home|title=Bradley House|publisher=Bradleyhouse.org|access-date=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405153300/http://www.bradleyhouse.org/home|archive-date=5 April 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> whilst most mixing was carried out in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

The band performed at the 2008 ''V Festivals'' in Chelmsford and Staffordshire in August. On 7 March 2008, they embarked on a mini-tour of the UK, starting in Birmingham Academy and ending at London. On 1 April 2008, it was confirmed that they would support [[Bon Jovi]] at four of their seven dates on the UK leg of ''Bon Jovi's Lost Highway World Tour''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowNews.asp?nItemID=18520&bPrint=1|title=The Feeling confirmed as Bon Jovi support (Music-News.com) 1 April 2008|publisher=Music-news.com|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref>

On 27 June 2008, the band played the pyramid stage at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], which was their first appearance at the legendary festival. During the performance, they covered [[The Buggles]]' "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]" and [[A-ha]]'s "[[Take On Me]]". In November 2008, the band embarked on one of their biggest UK and Irish tours to date, performing at 21 different venues.

The song was released on 1 May. They performed "Set My World on Fire" on ITV1's ''[[Paul O'Grady Live]]'' on 6 May 2011.

They were set to do a UK tour in April 2013 promoting their fourth studio album ''[[Boy Cried Wolf (album)|Boy Cried Wolf]]'', but had to delay it to October 2013 to synchronise with the release of the album. As an apology for rescheduling the tour, the band did a small show at The Doghouse (Dan's house) at which they played songs from the fourth album, including "Rescue" and "Boy Cried Wolf".

The band played a final UK tour of sellout gigs towards the end of 2016, announcing that the last show of the tour would mark a hiatus until at least 2018. 

===2017–2019: end of hiatus and ''Everybody's Talking About Jamie''===
The hiatus announced in 2016 only lasted until 2017 after a surprise return on Chris Evans' Radio 2 Breakfast Show and an announcement they would be playing Carfest 2018.

As part of the hiatus, Dan Gillespie Sells collaborated with writer and lyricist [[Tom MacRae]] to create the music for the musical ''[[Everybody's Talking About Jamie]]'', which premiered in Sheffield in February 2017 and moved to the [[West End theatre|West End]] in November 2017. The musical was very successful, and in 2018 Gillespie Sells received a nomination for a [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Original Score or New Orchestrations]]. A film version was announced in May 2018, with Gillespie Sells collaborating again with MacRae on the soundtrack.  

===2020–present: ''Loss. Love. Hope.'' and 2022 tour===

Hope. Love'' with a release date set for early May 2022. In September 2021, as a taster for the new album, they released their version of "This Was Me", which [[Dan Gillespie Sells]] wrote for the film adaptation of the West End musical ''[[Everybody's Talking About Jamie]]''.<ref name="xsnoize">{{cite web |last1=Millar |first1=Mark |title=THE FEELING open up a new chapter with brand new album 'Loss.
