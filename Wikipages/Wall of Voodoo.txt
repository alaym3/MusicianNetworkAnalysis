'''Wall of Voodoo''' was an American [[rock music|rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States,<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1228}}</ref> best known for its 1983 hit "[[Mexican Radio]]". The band had a sound that was a fusion of [[synthesizer]]-based [[new wave music]] with the [[spaghetti Western]] [[soundtrack]] style of [[Ennio Morricone]].

==History==
===Formation===
Wall of Voodoo had its roots in Acme Soundtracks, a [[film score]] business started by [[Stan Ridgway]], later the vocalist and harmonica player for Wall of Voodoo. Acme Soundtracks' office was across the street from the [[Hollywood]] punk club [[The Masque]] and Ridgway was soon drawn into the emerging punk/new wave scene. [[Marc Moreland]], guitarist for [[The Skulls (U.S. Band)|the Skulls]], began jamming with Ridgway at the Acme Soundtracks office and the soundtrack company morphed into a new wave band.<ref name="Monterey">{{cite web|url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/local_news/twenty-years-after-mexican-radio-stan-ridgway-still-finds-his/article_ff9234ba-a518-5306-a9f1-685b9c15777c.html |title=Montereycountyweekly.com |publisher=Montereycountyweekly.com |access-date=2010-12-22}}</ref> In 1977, with the addition of Skulls members [[Bruce Moreland]] (Marc Moreland's brother) as bassist and Chas T. Gray as keyboardist, along with [[Joe Nanini]], who had been the drummer for the [[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]], the Eyes, and [[Black Randy and the Metrosquad]], the first lineup of Wall of Voodoo was born.<ref name="AMG">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wall-of-voodoo-mn0000191175/biography|title=Wall of Voodoo &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

The band was named Wall of Voodoo before their first gig in reference to a comment made by Joe Berardi, a friend of Ridgway's and member of [[the Fibonaccis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.noncredo.com/bio/joe-berardi/|title=Non Credo » Joe Berardi|website=Noncredo.com}}</ref> Berardi was listening to some of the Acme Soundtracks music Ridgway and Moreland had created in their studio. When Ridgway jokingly compared the multiple-drum-machine- and [[Farfisa]]-organ-laden recordings to [[Phil Spector]]'s [[Wall of Sound]], Berardi commented it sounded more like a "wall of ''voodoo''" and the name stuck.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}

Wall of Voodoo released a self-titled [[Extended play|EP]] in 1980 which featured a synthesizer-driven cover of "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]." The second half of "Ring of Fire" features a dissonant guitar solo covering the theme to the 1966 film ''[[Our Man Flint]].'' The band's first full-length album, ''[[Dark Continent (album)|Dark Continent]]'', followed in 1981.<ref name="Larkin"/> Much of the material from this record would feature in live shows over the next few years, such as "Red Light", "Animal Day" and fan favorite "Back In Flesh". Bruce Moreland left the band for the first time soon after this, and Chas Gray performed both bass and synthesizers during this time. The band recorded their biggest-selling album, ''[[Call of the West]]'', in 1982. A single, "[[Mexican Radio]]," about [[border blaster]] radio stations, became an international hit, peaking at #18 in Canada, #21 in New Zealand and #33 in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=https://charts.nz/search.asp?cat=s&artist=wall+of+voodoo&artist_search=starts&title=&title_search=starts |title=New Zealand charts portal |publisher=charts.nz |access-date=2014-03-08}}</ref> It also reached #64 in the UK,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Bill Noland was added as a keyboardist soon after the release of ''[[Call of the West]]''.<ref name="AMG"/> That same year, Wall of Voodoo opened for [[the Residents]] on the cult band's inaugural tour, "the Mole Show," at Perkins Palace in Pasadena, Halloween 1982, and for [[Devo]]'s [[Oh, No! It's Devo#Tour|ill-fated]] televised 3-DEVO Concert in October.

Wall of Voodoo opened for [[Oingo Boingo]] on their ''[[Nothing to Fear (Oingo Boingo album)|Nothing to Fear]]'' tour at the [[Arlington Theater]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in March 1983. Stan Ridgway claims that the situation around the band was increasingly chaotic during this era, with a great deal of drug use and out-of-control behavior on the part of the band members, as well as shady behavior by the band's management and [[record label]]. Wall of Voodoo appeared at the second [[US Festival]] on May 28, 1983 (the largest concert the band had performed), immediately after which Ridgway, Nanini, and Noland all left the band.<ref name="Monterey"/> Stan Ridgway soon went on to a successful solo career. He appeared as a guest vocalist on a track on the ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' score and released his critically acclaimed debut solo album ''[[The Big Heat (album)|The Big Heat]],'' which included the single "[[Camouflage (Stan Ridgway song)|Camouflage]]", a top ten hit across Europe, in 1986. Joe Nanini soon resurfaced in the [[country rock]] band Lonesome Strangers.

===1983–1988===
The remainder of the band, Marc Moreland, Chas T. Gray and a returning Bruce Moreland, carried on under the name Wall of Voodoo. Soon after, [[Andy Prieboy]], formerly of the San Francisco new wave band Eye Protection, joined as singer and Ned Leukhardt was added as drummer.<ref name="Larkin"/> They issued a UK-only single "Big City" in 1984, and contributed a track to the film ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'' in 1985.  Later that year, they released ''[[Seven Days in Sammystown]]''. The first single, "Far Side of Crazy", did well in Australia, reaching number 23 on the ARIA charts. The song is still heard today on the Austereo Triple M network.

In 1987, the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Happy Planet (Wall of Voodoo)|Happy Planet]]''. The album, their second with Andy Prieboy as frontman, saw ''Call of the West'''s [[Richard Mazda]] returning as producer. ''Happy Planet'' spawned another hit in Australia: a cover of [[the Beach Boys]]' "Do It Again," which charted at #40 there. The video for the song featured the Beach Boys' own [[Brian Wilson]]. Bruce Moreland left the band prior to the subsequent tour.  In 1988, Wall of Voodoo split up and Andy Prieboy and Marc Moreland went on to solo careers.

===After 1988===
In 1989, a post-breakup live album entitled ''[[The Ugly Americans in Australia]]'' was issued, which documented their 1987 tour of Melbourne, Australia. (Additional performances from a date in Bullhead City, Arizona, were also included.) Stan Ridgway, Andy Prieboy and Marc Moreland all embarked on solo careers throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Joe Nanini released an EP under the name Sienna Nanini in 1996.

Two former members died in the early 2000s; Joe Nanini died of a [[Stroke|brain hemorrhage]] on December 4, 2000, and Marc Moreland died of kidney and [[liver failure]] on March 13, 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1452928/for-the-record-quick-news-on-tool-eminem-godsmack-coldplay-big-daddy-kane-wall-of-voodoo-more/|title=For The Record: Quick News On Tool, Eminem, Godsmack, Coldplay, Big Daddy Kane, Wall Of Voodoo & More|website=[[MTV News]]}}</ref>

On July 18, 2006 a Stan Ridgway-fronted Wall of Voodoo performed at the [[Pacific Amphitheatre]] in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] as an opening band for [[Cyndi Lauper]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pacamp.com/pa/schedules/pastshows-2008.asp|title=You are being redirected...|website=Pacamp.com}}</ref> However, other than Ridgway, none of the surviving Wall of Voodoo members were included in this lineup; Joe Berardi and Voodoo producer [[Richard Mazda]] were in this lineup.  Ridgway's album ''Snakebite: Blacktop Ballads and Fugitive Songs'' (2005), features the narrative song, "Talkin' Wall of Voodoo Blues Pt. 1," a history of the band in song.

A remastered coupling of ''Dark Continent'' and ''Call of the West'' was released by [[Raven Records]] on November 10, 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jbhifionline.com.au/music/pop-rock/dark-continent-call-of-the-west-2-for-1/465183|title=Dark Continent / Call Of The West (2-for-1) &#124; CD & DVD Music, Music Genres, Pop/Rock : JB HI-FI|date=19 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019185214/http://www.jbhifionline.com.au/music/pop-rock/dark-continent-call-of-the-west-2-for-1/465183|access-date=2 October 2020|archive-date=2012-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ravenrecordscomau.melbourneitwebsites.com/cat/index.cgi/shopfront/view_product_details?category_id=3306&product_id=375665|title=Raven Records: Wall Of Voodoo|website=Ravenrecordscomau.melbourneitwebsites.com}}</ref> On October 2, 2012, Raven issued a companion two-disc set containing all three albums from the Andy Prieboy era (''Seven Days in Sammystown'', ''Happy Planet'' and ''Ugly Americans in Australia''), all remastered, including three bonus tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ravenrecordscomau.melbourneitwebsites.com/cat/index.cgi/shopfront/view_product_details?category_id=3306&product_id=444411,,|title=''Seven Days in Sammystown/Happy Planet/Ugly Americans in Australia''|website=Ravenrecordscomau.melbourneitwebsites.com}}</ref>
