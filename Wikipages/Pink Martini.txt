'''Pink Martini''' is a band that was formed in 1994 by pianist [[Thomas Lauderdale]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Group members call it a little orchestra that crosses several styles, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[Traditional pop music|traditional pop]], [[Latin music|latin]] and [[jazz]].<ref name="officialbio">{{cite web |url=http://pinkmartini.com/about/bio/ |title=Pink Martini Bio |website=Pinkmartini.com |access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> The co-lead vocalists of Pink Martini are [[China Forbes]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/15/arts/music/15pink.html?_r=0 |title=Grab a Cocktail and Listen to the Vintage-Chic Band |author=Nate Chinen |date=15 June 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> and [[Storm Large]].

==History==
Thomas Lauderdale worked in politics in 1994 in his hometown of Portland, Oregon. He considered the music at most fundraisers loud and boring. He founded Pink Martini as a remedy, crossing the genres of [[jazz]], [[classical music]], and [[traditional pop]] to appeal to a broad audience. During the following year, he called [[China Forbes]], a classmate from Harvard, and invited her to join the band. Their first single, "Sympathique", was nominated for Song of the Year at the [[Victoires de la Musique]] Awards in France.

Forbes is monolingual but sings in 15 languages. "All of us in Pink Martini have studied different languages as well as different styles of music from different parts of the world," says Lauderdale. "So inevitably, our repertoire is wildly diverse. At one moment, you feel like you're in the middle of a samba parade in Rio de Janeiro, and in the next moment, you're in a French music hall of the 1930s or a palazzo in Napoli. It's a bit like an urban musical travelogue. We're very much an American band, but we spend a lot of time abroad and therefore have the incredible diplomatic opportunity to represent a broader, more inclusive America… the America which remains the most heterogeneously populated country in the world… composed of people of every country, every language, every religion."<ref>{{cite episode |title=Pink Martini |series=CBS Sunday Morning |network=CBS|date=1 January 2012}}</ref> Featuring 10–12 musicians, Pink Martini performs its multilingual repertoire on concert stages and with symphony orchestras throughout the world.

Since then, the band has gone on to play with more than 50 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], the [[Boston Pops]], the National Symphony at the [[Kennedy Center]], the [[San Francisco Symphony]], and the BBC Concert Orchestra at [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.
