==History==
===Early years and musical style===
Angus (b. 1986) and Julia (b. 1984) Stone were born in Sydney to Kim and John Stone, both of whom influenced their children's interest in music. Along with their older sister, Catherine, Julia and Angus grew up in the suburb of [[Newport, New South Wales|Newport]] on Sydney's [[Northern Beaches]]. They attended Newport Primary School and then [[Barrenjoey High School]].<ref name="Murfett">{{cite news | last = Murfett | first = Andrew | date = 3 September 2010 | title = Stone Hearts Renewed | url = http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/stone-hearts-renewed-20100902-14r1y.html | work = [[The Age]]  | access-date = 9 December 2012 }}</ref> During their teen years, Angus started writing pop songs.<ref name="Murfett"/><ref name="Murfett2007">{{cite news | last = Murfett | first = Andrew | title = Angus & Julia Stone | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/gig-previews--reviews/angus--julia-stone/2007/10/16/1192300745813.html?page=fullpage | work = [[The Age]]  | date = 16 October 2007 | access-date = 9 December 2012 }}</ref> After finishing school, Angus worked as a labourer and learned guitar while recuperating from a [[snowboarding]] accident.

====Gap year====
After travelling abroad, when she returned to Australia, Julia encouraged Angus to start performing.<ref name="ABCPerformer"/> By 2005 Angus was playing at [[open mic]] nights with Julia occasionally performing backing vocals. For their first such gig, at the Coogee Bay Hotel, they performed Angus' song, "Tears".<ref name="Treuen2">{{cite news | url = http://jasontreuen.wordpress.com/2007/10/24/frankie-first-and-last-times-with-julia-stone/ | title = First and Last Times with Julia Stone | work = [[Frankie (magazine)|frankie]] | publisher = Morrison Media | last = Treuen | first = Jason | date = 24 October 2007 | access-date = 10 December 2012 }}</ref> By that time, Julia was writing her own material and they played split sets, with each providing backing vocals for the other's material.<ref name="Murfett2007"/>

====Collaboration====
The siblings decided to collaborate on their musical endeavours as a duo in early 2006.<ref name="Murfett2007"/> In terms of composing material, they each write on their own, then work together on structure and harmonies.<ref name="Nimmervoll2">{{cite web | archive-url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/14231/20120727-0512/www.howlspace.com.au/en5/StoneAngusAndJulia/StoneAngusAndJulia.htm | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en5/StoneAngusAndJulia/StoneAngusAndJulia.htm | title = Angus and Julia Stone | last1 = Nimmervoll | first1 = Ed | author-link1 = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = Howlspace – The Living History of Our Music (Ed Nimmervoll). White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd | archive-date = 27 July 2012 | access-date = 30 January 2014 }}</ref> Australian music journalist, [[Ed Nimmervoll]], described their songwriting as: "Julia with her highly romantic confessional relationship songs, Angus with his more guarded lyrically, more directly pop-oriented songs".<ref name="Nimmervoll2"/>

They have distinctive vocal styles, according to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''{{'}}s Bernard Zuel, "[h]er voice has a fractured feel like [[Jolie Holland]]; his has a smoke-on-the-beach drawl". While Nimmervoll offered, "Angus has a [[Paul Simon]] style voice, in the high register, equally as suited to lead and harmony. Julia's is one of those girly, fragile theatrical voices very much in vogue in alt-folk these days. She'd struggle to distinguish herself against the competition, but alternating with Angus gives her the necessary platform of variety, and just as well, because the songs she takes charge of are such wonderful tales of forlorn reflection".<ref name="Nimmervoll">{{cite web | archive-url =http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/14231/20120727-0512/www.howlspace.com.au/en2/stoneA&J/StoneA&J.htm | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/stoneA&J/StoneA&J.htm | title = Feature Album – Angus and Julia Stone – ''A Book Like This'' | last1 = Nimmervoll | first1 = Ed | publisher = Howlspace – The Living History of Our Music (Ed Nimmervoll).

United Kingdom journalist Johnny Sharp of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' stated, "[m]ost impressive, though, are the songs – simple but blindingly effective acoustic compositions, warm boy-girl harmonies and delicate, less-is-more arrangements. Resistance is surely futile". Lewis Bazley of inthenews.co.uk felt they had a "winning mix of Angus' Damien Rice-like lilting vocals and Julia's Bjork-esque warbling creating a sonic combination that lulls the listener into wistful contentment".<ref name="Bazley">{{cite web | url = http://www.inthenews.co.uk/inconversation/entertainment/music/whos-next/angus-and-julia-stone-simplicity-beats-sibling-troubles-$1217610.htm | title = Angus and Julia Stone: Simplicity beats sibling troubles | last = Bazley | first = Lewis | publisher = inthenews.co.uk | date = 7 April 2008 | access-date = 17 December 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120210210709/http://www.inthenews.co.uk/inconversation/entertainment/music/whos-next/angus-and-julia-stone-simplicity-beats-sibling-troubles-$1217610.htm | archive-date = 10 February 2012 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===2006: ''Chocolates and Cigarettes'' and ''Heart Full of Wine'' EPs===
In March 2006 Angus & Julia Stone began recording their debut extended play, ''[[Chocolates and Cigarettes]]'', with Julia on vocals, guitar and trumpet; Angus on vocals and guitar; Mitchell "Mitch" Connelly ([[The Beautiful Girls]]) on drums and percussion; Clay MacDonald (The Beautiful Girls) on bass guitar; and Hanna Oblikov guested on cello.<ref name="Murfett2007"/><ref name="Choc">{{cite AV media notes |title=Chocolates & Cigarettes |title-link=Chocolates and Cigarettes |others=Angus & Julia Stone |year=2006 |publisher=[[EMI Music]] |id=0946 3 74832 2 0 }}</ref> The EP's title was provided by Julia, "I really like both ... But I'm trying to not like cigarettes. I only smoke now after I play gigs".<ref name="Murfett2007"/> Connelly, who was Julia's then-boyfriend, and MacDonald had permanently left their band, The Beautiful Girls, to back the duo for live performances.<ref name="Murfett2007"/> Their first single, "Paper Aeroplane", from the EP was played on Australian radio<ref name="rage"/> in April including on [[FBi Radio|FBI]]. That same month Angus & Julia Stone played at [[The Great Escape Festival]].<ref name="NLAChoc">{{cite web | author1=Angus & Julia Stone Performer | title=''Chocolates & Cigarettes'' &#91;album&#93; |year=2006 | publisher=destra Media (Distributor) | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/37156963 | access-date=14 December 2012 }}</ref> At the end of July, the siblings played to two hundred people packed in a tiny tent at the [[Splendour in the Grass]] festival in [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]].<ref name="NLAChoc"/>

By August they had signed a two-EP distribution deal with EMI Music in Australia and independent label [[Independiente Records]] in the United Kingdom and relocated to London.<ref name="Carne">{{cite news | last = Carne | first = Lucy | date = October 2006 | title = The Stones take off | work = [[The Courier-Mail]] | publisher = [[Queensland Newspapers]] ([[News Corp Australia|News Corporation]]) }}</ref> On 26 August that year the six-track EP was officially released by [[EMI Music]] with Ian Prichett (The Beautiful Girls) producing.<ref name="Murfett2007"/><ref name="Choc"/> While in the UK, they were invited into [[Chris Potter (producer)|Chris Potter]]'s studio ([[The Verve]], [[Richard Ashcroft]]) to record. [[Fran Healy (musician)|Fran Healy]] from UK band [[Travis (band)|Travis]] had also heard their debut EP and invited them to his house to record.<ref name="Nimmervoll2"/> The result of these two matchups was the duo's second EP, ''[[Heart Full of Wine]]'', which also had six tracks, appeared on 3 February 2007. Again Connelly provided drums and percussion, but on bass guitar was James Perryman and on cello was Bethany Porter – both Angus and Julia also played harmonica.<ref name="Heart">{{cite AV media notes |title=Heart Full of Wine |title-link=Heart Full of Wine |others=Angus & Julia Stone |year=2007 |publisher=[[EMI Music]] |id=0946 3 83084 2 3 }}</ref><ref name="NLAHeart">{{cite web | author1=Angus & Julia Stone Performer | title=''Heart Full of Wine'' &#91;album&#93; |year=2007 | publisher=destra Media (Distributor) | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/37158517 | access-date=14 December 2012 }}</ref> At the end of 2006, the duo signed a worldwide publishing deal with [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] and [[Creative Artists Agency]] came on board as their UK-European agent.
