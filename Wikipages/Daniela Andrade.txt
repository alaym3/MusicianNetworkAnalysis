== Personal life ==

Andrade was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], in a financially difficult household<ref name="Andrade June 2011"/><ref name="Poitras 2016"/><ref name="Aghbali 2020"/> as the youngest of four siblings.<ref name="Billboard 2020"/> Her father, Necthaly (Nick) Andrade, was a former choir director and guitarist who immigrated from [[Honduras]] to Canada in 1987 and established a construction business in precast supply in 2003 in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], which is where Andrade grew up in her childhood.<ref name="Andrade June 2011"/><ref name="Sperounes 2014"/><ref name="Aghbali 2020"/> Andrade's family belonged to a [[Seventh-day Adventist]] church, and keeping with the faith's prohibition of dance and music except in praise and service to God, Andrade's mother controlled the music in the family's house, even disapproving of Andrade's father's favourite music in mariachi and [[Sentimental ballad|balladeers]] like [[Jose Luis Perales]] and [[Julio Iglesias]].<ref name="Poitras 2016"/><ref name="Aghbali 2020"/> Nevertheless, many of Andrade's siblings sang, her father played guitar and so did she at age 13 being taught chords by her father, and she enjoyed singing growing up being inspired by her father.<ref name="Sperounes 2014"/><ref name="Aghbali 2020"/> She joined the praise team at her church and she had her first choir solo at age 6.<ref name="Aghbali 2020"/> Andrade would listen to classic 2000s bands online in her spare time like Metric and Linkin Park, and she also listened to Latina musicians like [[Selena]], [[Shakira]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]], which her parents did not always approve of.<ref name="Aghbali 2020"/> These early musical influences led to conflicted visions of her femininity and Latina heritage, where one path "promoted a sense of devotion to the church, to selflessness and to domesticity", while the other path was secular and involved "the dancing, the skin, the topic of being very open about your sexuality, [which] just seemed very far-fetched" to her.<ref name="Aghbali 2020"/>

Andrade was first exposed to YouTube while learning from it to improve her guitar playing.<ref name="Poitras 2016"/> She started her YouTube channel in high school in October 2008 with a video covering "Say It's Possible" by YouTuber and musician [[Terra Naomi]],<ref name="Andrade 2008"/><ref name="Sperounes 2014"/> as a way to calm herself before an audition the next day for a singing competition in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], which she ultimately did not win; nevertheless she continued to post videos to YouTube of her playing covers around her family home.<ref name="Sperounes 2014"/><ref name="Aghbali 2020"/> Andrade gained followers with songs like [[Coldplay|Coldplay's]] "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]", and [[Frank Sinatra|Frank Sinatra's]] "[[Fly Me To The Moon]]", and in 2009, she increased the frequency of her posts and quickly grew in popularity.<ref name="Aghbali 2020"/>

In 2011, she graduated from [[Queen Elizabeth High School (Edmonton)|Queen Elizabeth High School]] in Edmonton, and thereafter, she applied to the [[University of Alberta]] to eventually be an English teacher.<ref name="Sperounes 2014"/> She abandoned applying to university after she won $10,000 in September 2011 due to overwhelming fan votes in an online competition about musical inspirations with a video of herself & her father covering ''[[Chiquitita]]'' by [[ABBA]], but in Spanish.<ref name="Andrade 2010"/><ref name="Andrade Sept 2011"/><ref name="Sperounes 2014"/> Andrade used the money to record and release an [[Extended play|EP]] of her own original songs, ''Things We've Said'', in 2012 with producer and YouTuber [[Jesse Barrera]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].<ref name="Sperounes 2014"/> She then released a collection ''Covers, Vol. 1'', as well as ''The Christmas [[Extended play|EP]]''. Her low-key cover of [[Gnarls Barkley]]'s "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]" went viral in 2014 and was featured in the second season of the Netflix show ''[[Umbrella Academy]]''.<ref name="Aghbali 2020"/> Her acoustic cover of [[Edith Piaf|Edith Piaf's]] "[[La Vie en Rose]]" also went viral.

She moved to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] in December 2014, but then moved back to Montr√©al in the summer of 2015.<ref name="Poitras 2016"/> Andrade intended to produce a music video for her single "Genesis" in Honduras, but due to ongoing civil unrest, she produced the video in one week in [[Mexico]], where emotionally-moving experiences reminded her of her mother and connected her more deeply to her Latin identity.<ref name="Aghbali 2020"/>
