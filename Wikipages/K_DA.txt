'''K/DA''' is a [[virtual band|virtual]] [[K-pop]] [[girl group]] consisting of four themed versions of ''[[League of Legends]]'' characters: Ahri, Akali, Evelynn and Kai'Sa.<ref name="dazed">{{cite magazine |first=Lucas |last=Lockyer |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/science-tech/article/42207/1/k-pop-virtual-band-k-da-league-of-legends-riot-games |title=Meet K/DA, the virtual K-pop girl group taking the internet by storm |magazine=Dazed |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> American singers [[Madison Beer]], [[Jaira Burns]], and [[(G)I-dle]] members [[Cho Mi-yeon|Miyeon]] and [[Jeon So-yeon|Soyeon]] provide the voices of Evelynn, Kai'Sa, Ahri, and Akali respectively, though the characters have also been voiced by other artists. K/DA was developed by [[Riot Games]], the company behind ''League of Legends'', and unveiled at the [[2018 League of Legends World Championship]] with an [[augmented reality]] live performance of their first song, "[[Pop/Stars]]". A music video of the song uploaded to [[YouTube]] subsequently went viral, surpassing 100 million views in one month, and reaching 400 million views, as well as topping ''[[Billboard (Magazine)|Billboard]]{{'}}''s World Digital Song Sales chart. This would be followed up with the release of an EP in 2020, entitled ''[[All Out (EP)|All Out]]'' which featured 5 new songs including the pre-released single "[[The Baddest (K/DA song)|The Baddest]]" and the lead single "[[More (K/DA song)|More]]" which the later received a music video with over 100 million views as of July 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lee|first=Julia|date=2020-08-27|title=League of Legends' pop group K/DA does it again with new single, 'The Baddest'|url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/27/21395880/league-of-legends-k-da-the-baddest|access-date=2020-08-27|website=Polygon|language=en}}</ref>

The conception of K/DA was based on Riot's expressed desire to create more musical content in the future, with the characters chosen based on K-pop archetypes. The group was created to promote the [[League of Legends World Championship|''League'' World Championship]] and to sell in-game K/DA [[skin (video gaming)|skins]] of the characters in ''League of Legends''. K/DA has subsequently achieved significant popularity both within and beyond the ''League of Legends'' fandom, and received critical acclaim, especially for their performance during the World Championship and the impact of gaming on the music scene.

K/DA was unveiled in the [[2018 League of Legends World Championship]] Opening Ceremony in [[Incheon]] on November 3, 2018, with the release of their debut single, "[[Pop/Stars]]".<ref name="ceremony">{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Mickunas |url=https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-puts-on-an-augmented-reality-k-pop-concert-for-worlds-in-tandem-with-a-brand-new-music-video |title=Riot puts on an augmented reality K-Pop concert for Worlds in tandem with a brand-new music video |date=November 3, 2018 |publisher=Dot Esports |access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref> It is a bilingual song with both K-pop and American pop influences, with vocals in English by Beer and Burns, and in both English and Korean by Soyeon and Miyeon.<ref name="audience"/> During the ceremony, Beer, Burns, Miyeon and Soyeon performed "Pop/Stars" on-stage, whilst [[augmented reality]] versions of the characters they voiced sang and danced alongside them.<ref name="ceremony"/> The augmented reality versions of the characters could perform acts a human could not achieve, such as Ahri flying onto the stage, whilst a human singer has "a certain raw human element" that can't yet be captured by a virtual performer.<ref name="minds"/>

Viranda Tantula, the creative lead on the project, wrote that "we went into this really wanting to make [the ceremony] a dope ‘League’ moment for players – albeit one where the fantasy of the champs being in the real world played out in an authentic manner that could live alongside others in their verticals (ie song had to be able to stand up to other pop songs, performance had to stand up to other performances, etc.)."<ref name="variety"/> The official music video for the song was released on [[YouTube]] on the same day.<ref name="ceremony"/>

According to Sebastien Najand, who composed "Pop/Stars", an all-English [[demo (music)|demo]] was trialled at first, followed by a version with significantly more Korean.<ref name="minds"/> Ultimately, Najand said that "we wanted to make it a blend of western pop and K-Pop".<ref name="minds"/> Patrick Morales, the creative lead behind the "Pop/Stars" music video, said that he wanted K/DA to exist "somewhere between fantasy and reality".<ref name="interview"/> The team was initially uncertain of the type of music that would be most suitable for the group, due to amount of variety within the pop music genre. They eventually decided against a cuter, more-[[Japanese idol|idol group]] based theme in favour of something "modern and edgy" that combines a "bit of street style with a handcrafted feel."<ref name="interview"/>

=== In ''League of Legends'' ===
K/DA [[skin (video gaming)|skins]] of Ahri, Akali, Evelynn and Kai'Sa, depicting the characters as how they appear in the band, are available for purchase in ''League of Legends''.<ref name="dazed">{{cite magazine |first=Lucas |last=Lockyer |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/science-tech/article/42207/1/k-pop-virtual-band-k-da-league-of-legends-riot-games |title=Meet K/DA, the virtual K-pop girl group taking the internet by storm |magazine=Dazed |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> Skins in the game are for cosmetic purposes only, and the K/DA skins cost 1350 Riot points (Riot points are the League of legends ingame currency) which costs around [[United States dollar|US$]]10 to purchase.<ref name="polygon2">{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Julia|title=K/DA, Riot Games' pop girl group, explained|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/5/18064726/league-of-legends-kda-pop-stars-video-akali-ahri-evelynn-kai-sa|access-date=April 24, 2019|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=November 5, 2018}}</ref> The Prestige skins are only available by completing special missions in-game.<ref name="akali">{{cite web |first=Cass |last=Marshall |url=https://www.riftherald.com/lol-skins/2018/11/19/18103373/k-da-akali-prestige-edition-skin |title=K/DA Akali gets a Prestige Edition skin |date=November 19, 2018 |publisher=The Rift Herald |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> The popularity of K/DA in 2018 led Riot to release [[All Out (EP)|an EP consisting of five songs]], new skins inspired on its artwork, and music videos in 2020.<ref>{{cite web |first=Malcolm |last=Abbas |url=https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/k-da-set-to-receive-even-more-new-content-in-2019 |title=K/DA set to receive even more new content in 2019 |date=January 27, 2019 |publisher=Dot Esports |access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref>

== Conception and creation ==
The name "K/DA" is an in-game term in ''League of Legends'' that refers to a player's [[League of Legends#Gameplay|kills, deaths, and assists]].<ref name="audience"/> The creation of K/DA was based in part on the desire of [[Riot Games]], ''League''{{'}}s developers to "see their company more as a full-fledged music label in the future".<ref name="first"/> Toa Dunn, head of Riot's music division, claimed in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that "[K/DA] was the most involved music project we’ve ever done".<ref name="making">{{cite magazine |first=Brian |last=Crecente |url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/features/k-da-pop-stars-beat-saber-1203093283/ |title=The Making of 'League of Legends' Augmented Reality 'Pop/Stars' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref>

According to Tantula, "We believe there’s a huge overlap between ''League of Legends'', esports overall and the music industry", and as a result, they invested "in building [their] internal music team with both an artist focused creative studio full of composers, songwriters and producers, as well as people who can perform all the services that you would see at a standard music label, such as distribution, A&R and promo."<ref name="Billboard"/> Patrick Morales (creative lead behind the ''Pop/Stars'' music video), Janelle Jimenez (the lead designer behind the K/DA skins) and Toa Dunn (the head of the Riot Music Group) were the main creators of K/DA.<ref name="interview">{{cite web |first1=Donghyun |last1=Won |first2=Yudae |last2=Oak |url=https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/6859/interview-with-patrick-morales-janelle-jimenez-and-toa-dunn-the-creators-of-the-global-sensation-kda-popstars |title=Interview With Patrick Morales, Janelle Jimenez, and Toa Dunn; the Creators of the Global Sensation, K/DA-POP/STARS |date=November 28, 2018 |publisher=Inven Global |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> The dances were [[choreograph]]ed by Ellen Kim, Bailey Sok, Stevie Doré and Eileen Harman.<ref name="variety"/> [[4Minute]] also served as a source of inspiration behind K/DA.<ref name="minds"/> For singing "Pop/Stars", Madison Beer was brought on early, and Jaira Burns followed.<ref name="making"/> As many at Riot were fans of (G)I-dle and liked "the attitude they brought to the song, especially the rap section", Miyeon and Soyeon were brought on as well.<ref name="making"/>

== Members ==
The members of K/DA consist of four characters from the ''League of Legends'' video game:

* '''Ahri''' (voiced by [[Laura Post]], singing voices provided by [[Cho Mi-yeon|Miyeon]], [[Nayeon]], [[Sana (singer)|Sana]], [[Jihyo]], [[Chaeyoung]], [[Bekuh BOOM]], and Annika Wells) is a [[Fox spirit|nine-tailed fox]] mage in ''League of Legends'', and one of the most popular characters in ''League of Legends''. In lore she is a Vastaya, a chimeric race of humainoid beast creatures, in Ahri's case a fox Vastayan. In-game, she is a mage-assassin hybrid usually played in the mid lane. Her main weapon is her orb of deception, which she can command to damage enemies and then return to her. She can also heal herself by hurting others, launch 'foxfire' missiles towards her enemies, charm enemies to immobilize them and use her ultimate ability 'Spirit Rush'; to rapidly dash up to three times.<ref name="polygon2"/> In K/DA, Ahri serves as the leader and founder of K/DA, as well as one of the main vocalists along with Evelynn.<ref name="polygon2" /> Her solo song was "I'll Show You". According to Miyeon, she started learning more about ''League of Legends'' and actually played the game as Ahri to better understand her character.<ref name="Billboard2">{{cite magazine|last=Herman|first=Tamar|title='League of Legends' Unveils Virtual K-Pop Girl Group K/DA, Looks to Future of Music in Esports|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/tech/8483500/league-of-legends-virtual-k-pop-girl-group-kda-music-esports|magazine=Billboard|access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref> Miyeon was invited to visit Riot Headquarters in 2020 along with Soyeon to play ''League of Legends'' as their represented characters and skins (Soyeon as K/DA Akali, Miyeon as K/DA Ahri).
* '''Akali''' (voiced by [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] and Krizia Bajos, singing voice provided by [[Jeon So-yeon|Soyeon]]) is a [[Ninja]] assassin character usually played in either the mid lane or top lane. In lore, Akali hails from Ionia formerly as a part of the Kinkoku Order under its grandmaster Shen. After witnessing the atrocities committed by Noxus and the Kinkoku's restrained response to the invasion of Ionia led to her abandoning the Order to defend her homeland in a direct fashion, becoming a rogue ninja. In game, her abilities involve creating clouds of darkness to become invisible, as well as throwing [[kunai]] and shurikens at opponents. She is very mobile with abilities that allow her to dash rapidly and execute enemies with her ultimate. In K/DA, Akali is the main rapper of the group. Soyeon said she tried to "feel like Akali and move as if I were Akali" during the motion capture for "Pop/Stars". Akali is also a member of True Damage, another virtual group formed by ''League of Legends'' characters. Soyeon also played the game on two separate occasions; first alone on a livestream, and then a few months later with Miyeon at Riot Headquarters in 2020 as their represented characters and skins (Soyeon as K/DA Akali, Miyeon as K/DA Ahri)
* '''Evelynn''' (voiced by [[Mara Junot]], singing voices provided by [[Madison Beer]], [[Bea Miller]] and [[Kim Petras]]) is a sadistic [[Demon]] assassin usually played in the jungle. In lore, she is a primordial demon who takes on forms that attracts her victims. At the height of her target's pleasure, she unleashes her true form and preys on their suffering as a result. In game, her noteworthy ability involves her being permanently invisible to enemies (shadow form) when outside of combat or outside of a vision range. This allows her to sneak up on enemies and appear from her shadow-form, using her charm spell to immobilize them, followed by quickly eliminating them with her combo and execution-like ultimate spell. In K/DA, Evelynn serves as one of the main vocalists along with Ahri. Her solo song was "Villain". Some facts about Evelynn in the K/DA universe: She is known for her uncompromising vision, rich vocals, and "bad girl" attitude. Before K/DA, she had disagreements in other musical groups before working alone to write her own music before reconnecting with Ahri to create K/DA. Evelynn is very mysterious about her diet and workouts and usually declines to comment on her routine. She has a collection of very fast cars.  She is close to few people and very protective of them. She has been romantically linked with several missing male celebrities but never confirmed a relationship. Evelynn has stated she takes inspiration from Karthus (another playable character in ''League of Legends'' who stars in the music group [[Pentakill]])
* '''Kai'Sa''' (voiced by Natasha Loring, singing voices provided by [[Jaira Burns]], Wolftyla, [[AlunaGeorge|Aluna]] and [[Bekuh BOOM]]) is a burst marksman and usually played in the bottom lane. In lore, Kai'Sa is rumored to be the daughter of another champion, Kassadin, who was lost to the Void, an alternate plane of existence connected to Runeterra filled with many unspeakable horrors amidst the utter nothingness and darkness. To survive, she merged with a Voidborn, a creature of the Void, becoming an apex predator herself and has since returned to Runeterra not fully Voidborn, but remarkably less human. In game, Kai'sa can either snipe enemies from afar, or teleport close to them and fire missiles from magical cannons floating above her shoulders. She also has a dash ability to dodge attacks, which can also grant her invisibility once she is powerful enough. In K/DA, Kai'Sa is the main dancer of the group. She also rapped in "The Baddest" and "More", and sung in "Pop/Stars" and her solo song, "Drum Go Dum".

=== About the characters ===

The characters were chosen from ''League of Legend''{{'}}s character list based on whether players would realistically see them as "Pop Stars".<ref name="interview2">{{cite web|last1=Won|first1=Donghyun|last2=Oak|first2=Yudae|title=Interview With Patrick Morales, Janelle Jimenez, and Toa Dunn; the Creators of the Global Sensation, K/DA-POP/STARS|date=November 28, 2018|url=https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/6859/interview-with-patrick-morales-janelle-jimenez-and-toa-dunn-the-creators-of-the-global-sensation-kda-popstars|access-date=April 25, 2019|publisher=Inven Global}}</ref> According to Patrick Morales, Ahri was the first character to be chosen for K/DA, due to her previous appearances in ''League of Legends''-related music as "Pop Star Ahri" back in 2013.<ref name="interview2" /> Subsequently, with Ahri being a "beautiful, charming leader"-type character, Evelynn was chosen to contrast to that, by "being the wild and provocative [[diva]] of the group".<ref name="interview2" /> As Akali's character was being reworked at the time, Morales included her into the band as he liked the "rebellious spirit" of the character.<ref name="interview2" /> Kai'Sa was included due to a recommendation from [[Skin (video gaming)|skins]] lead Janelle Jimenez, as she wanted a "strong but silent loner who expressed herself on stage through her movements".<ref name="interview2" />

The team also wanted diversity in the characters chosen, where each character has a well-defined archetype that allows viewers to easily identify their favourite K/DA member.<ref name="interview2" /> According to Jimenez, "Pop groups tend to have a formula where each member has their own unique personality and style. I approached this like looking at classic [[anime]] team where you have the leader, the shy one, the feisty one, etc."<ref name="interview2" /> Furthermore, they also wanted to ensure that the characters chosen had [[Character class|differing roles in the game]].<ref name="interview2" /> "Pop/Stars" was written with these archetypes in mind. For example, a rap section was included in the song as Akali was envisioned to be the rapper, and the pre-chorus was designed to be sung by Ahri.<ref name="interview2" />
