'''Tyler Jordan Cassidy''' was a 15-year-old boy who was killed by [[Victoria Police]] officers in [[Australia]]. His death influenced changes in the way Victoria Police respond to people presenting as mentally ill, and in the use of tasers.

==Shooting==
Tyler Jordan Cassidy was shot by police and died on 11 December 2008 at [[Northcote, Victoria#All Nations Park|All Nations Park]] in [[Northcote, Victoria]]. Before the shooting, Cassidy had armed himself with two large knives which he had stolen from a nearby shopping centre and threatened members of the public, insisting that they call the police. In the park, police demanded that Cassidy drop the knives, but he did not. After attempting to subdue Cassidy twice with [[OC spray]],<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/just-shoot-me-i-want-to-die-inquest-told-of-tylers-final-moments-20101103-17dav.html | title='Just shoot me, I want to die': inquest told of Tyler's final moments | date=3 November 2010 | accessdate=16 December 2013 | first1=Farah | last1=Farouque | location=Melbourne | work=The Age}}</ref> three officers fired ten shots from their [[Smith & Wesson Model 10]] [[.38 Special]] revolvers, with five of these striking Cassidy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/the-fatal-police-shooting-of-tyler-cassidy-five-years-ago-still-haunts-all-involved/news-story/eb79285cd002665acb629eeb46412941|title = The night police opened fire on a boy|newspaper = Herald Sun|date = 11 January 2014|last1 = Anderson|first1 = Paul}}</ref><ref name="corin">{{cite web | url=http://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au/resources/cbd04294-9314-4f4a-804a-5c2b15e10e64/tylercassidypart1_554208.pdf | title=Court reference 5542/08 | publisher=Coroners Court of Victoria | work=Inquest into the death of Tyler Jordan Cassidy | date=23 November 2011 | access-date=27 May 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212233740/http://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au/resources/cbd04294-9314-4f4a-804a-5c2b15e10e64/tylercassidypart1_554208.pdf | archive-date=12 December 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Investigations==
The [[Coroners Court of Victoria]] found that there was much public commentary of the incident and that the death of "a 15-year-old boy at the hands of the Victoria Police both shocked and bewildered us as a community."<ref>[http://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au/resources/cbd04294-9314-4f4a-804a-5c2b15e10e64/tylercassidypart1_554208.pdf  ''Coroner's Report, Redacted Finding into Death with Inquest, Tyler Jordan Cassidy'', Summary of Findings. p. 10] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212233740/http://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au/resources/cbd04294-9314-4f4a-804a-5c2b15e10e64/tylercassidypart1_554208.pdf |date=12 December 2013 }} accessed 9 March 2017</ref> The competence and impartiality of the internal police investigation was questioned. The Coroner's Inquest heard 34 days of evidence from 63 witnesses and the brief of evidence was 3,710 pages long.<ref name="Coroners Court of Victoria">{{cite web | url=http://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au/home/coroners+written+findings/findings+-+inquest+into+the+death+of+tyler+cassidy | title=Court reference 5542/08 | publisher=Coroners Court of Victoria | work=Inquest into the death of Tyler Jordan Cassidy | date=23 November 2011}}</ref>

From the inquest: "He [Cassidy] had been capsicum-sprayed twice without effect and advanced on an officer who became trapped at the top of a skate park bowl, the coroner found. Three of the police fired at him after a warning shot and several shots at his legs failed to stop Tyler moving forward with the knives towards [Leading Senior Constable Colin Dods]. Tyler had been drinking excessively during the night and was found to have a post mortem blood alcohol level of between 0.09g/100ml and 0.11g/100ml."

State Coroner Jennifer Coate rejected a submission from Cassidy's family that the officers used disproportionate force worthy of criminal charges, or that Cassidy had been standing still when he was fatally shot.<ref name="Coroners Court of Victoria"/>

The incident was blamed on a lack of training and information gathering performed by Victoria Police. Subsequently, all police officers who might come into contact with individuals who appear to be mentally ill in the course of duty are required to undergo a two-day training course twice a year.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/file_uploads/Policing_people_who_appear_to_be_mentally_pyt8YbmN.pdf |page=32 |title=Policing people who appear to be mentally ill |date=November 2012 |first1=Ron |last1=Bonighton}}</ref>

==Family's appeal to the UN==
Following the closing of the case by Australian <!--or Victorian? they're different.-->police and determining that the officers acted within the bounds of their duty, Cassidy's mother, Shani Cassidy, appealed to the [[United Nations]] for a review of the process by which fatal police shootings are investigated by the Victoria Police Homicide Squad. The author of the UN submission, Anna Brown, expected no additional evidence regarding the investigation to be elicited.<ref name="Cassidy2013">{{Citation | last=Cassidy | first=Shani | url=https://www.hrlc.org.au/news/un-communication-lodged-by-shani-cassidy?rq=tyler%20cassidy | title= Complete statement from Shani Cassidy regarding UN Communication | publisher=Human Rights Law Centre | year=2013 | accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> Among the complaints were allegations of poor investigative police work. Three of the four police officers involved attended a police function where alcohol was served the night before the fatal shooting occurred, but no alcohol or drug testing was administered at the time of the incident. Ten shots were fired but no bullets were recovered from the crime scene. Dods received a private phone call from his commanding officer immediately after the event; an issue Dods himself was highly critical about when cross examined.<ref name="Coroners Court of Victoria"/> Gunshot residue testing was significantly delayed, possibly leading to inconclusive results. No reconstruction was requested of the officers.<ref name="Coroners Court of Victoria"/>

==Police integrity==
Shani Cassidy made complaints over the integrity of Victoria Police. She alleged that her son's name was disclosed to the media as well as a "demonising" report of the incident after less than three hours of it occurring.<ref>{{Citation | first1=Julie-Anne | first2=Milanda | last1=Davies | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/call-for-answers-after-cops-kill-boy/story-e6frg6of-1111118304499# | last2=Rout | title=Call for answers after cops kill 15-year-old Tyler Cassidy | accessdate=4 December 2013 | work=The Australian | date=13 December 2008}}</ref> Assistant Commissioner Cartwright, then the appointed officer for communicating with the media regarding the event, was accused of disclosing Cassidy's name by the family's counsel, but Victoria Police has strongly denied these accusations.

At one time Shani Cassidy was secretly recorded by homicide detectives during an interview. Her appeal to the UN raised her complaint that following the incident Victoria Police attempted to exculpate themselves.<ref name="Cassidy2013"></ref>

In June 2015, ''[[The Age]]'' reported that this Wikipedia page had been edited by Victoria Police at least 17 times up until November 2014, apparently to give a more favourable impression of the officers' conduct and the subsequent investigation.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-police-edits-wikipedia-page-of-police-shooting-victim-tyler-cassidy-20150601-gh9vt1.html Liam Mannix, "Victoria Police edits Wikipedia page of police shooting victim Tyler Cassidy," ''The Age,'' 1 June 2015] Accessed 27 March 2017</ref>

==Debate over use of Tasers==
Former [[Police commissioner|chief commissioner]] of [[Victoria Police]] [[Christine Nixon]] has suggested that Cassidy's death prompted further community debate about the use of Tasers by Victoria Police.<ref>Christine Nixon (2011) ''Fair Cop'' p. 258, Victory Books, {{ISBN|9780522862058}}</ref> In 2010 Tasers were trialed in Bendigo and Morwell "because of the high use of OC spray, incidents involving people with a mental illness, sieges and instances where offenders have used weapons."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/country-police-equipped-with-tasers-from-sunday-in-trial-run/news-story/639bcc5a0a8ddf73bdb317d4c9b643a6 | first=Wes | last=Hosking | newspaper=Herald Sun | date=30 June 2010 | title=Country police equipped with Tasers from Sunday in trial run | accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref> In 2016 Tasers were made more widely available to Victoria Police. Deputy Commissioner Wendy Steendam said "What Tasers do for our members is to actually offer them another option in resolutions of incidents where they're having violent confrontations or where people are attempting to self-harm."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-14/regional-victorian-police-to-get-tasers/7245208 ABC News "Regional Victorian police to get Tasers to stop violent offenders"] Accessed 27 March 2017</ref>

==Defamation case of 2016==
In May 2016, lawyer Michael McDonald was found to have defamed Sergeant Colin Dods and ordered to pay damages. Justice Kevin Bell described the defamatory comments, made online, as "very grave. The publication caused (Sergeant Dods) to suffer continuing intense distress, humiliation and embarrassment and thereby great harm in his reputation," the judge said.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lawyer-ordered-to-pay-150000-to-police-officer-after-claiming-teenager-tyler-cassidy-was-executed-20160506-gonuas.html | first1=Mark | last1=Russell | first2=Adam | last2=Cooper | title=Lawyer must pay police officer $150,000 over claim teenager Tyler Cassidy was 'executed' | newspaper=The Age | date=6 May 2016 | accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref>
