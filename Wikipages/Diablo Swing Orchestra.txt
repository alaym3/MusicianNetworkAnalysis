== History ==
[[File:Diablo Swing Orchestra at Global East Rock Festival 2010 (3).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Johannes Bergion]]'s [[cello]] is one of the defining sounds of the band.]]

=== Debuts and ''The Butcher's Ballroom'' (2006–2009) ===
The band was created in 2003 as a [[sextet]]. The original line-up consisted of singer Lisa Hansson, guitarists [[Daniel Håkansson]] and Pontus Mantefors, bass guitarist Anders "Andy" Johansson, cellist [[Johannes Bergion]], and drummer Andreas Halvardsson. They released their first EP, ''[[Borderline Hymns]]'', in 2003; two years later, Hansson left the band, and was replaced by AnnLouice Lögdlund.

With Lögdlund, the band released their first album, ''[[The Butcher's Ballroom]]'', in 2006. During recording, the band realized that some parts did not fit Lögdlund's voice; as such, Håkansson became the band's co-lead singer, with Mantefors also occasionally providing lead vocals.<ref name="femme-Hakansson">{{cite news|url=http://www.femmemetalwebzine.net/2012/07/15/interview-daniel-hakansson-diablo-swing-orchestra-2009/|title=INTERVIEW : DANIEL HÅKANSSON – DIABLO SWING ORCHESTRA (2009)|date=July 15, 2012|accessdate=December 7, 2017|publisher=Erwin Van Dijk}}</ref>

=== ''Sing Along Songs for the Damned & Delirious'' (2009–2011) ===
In early spring 2009, the band announced that they were returning to the studio, and made a number of cryptic video blogs to document their efforts. On June 30, 2009 they announced that the cover art for the album would be made by Swedish illustrator Peter Bergting, noted for being the author of ''[[The Portent]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=86177545&blogId=497806755|title=Sing Along Songs album art & special editions revealed|author=Diablo Swing Orchestra|publisher=[[MySpace]]|date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=January 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view|archive-date=February 7, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="blabber-artwork">{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122849|title=Diablo Swing Orchestra: new album artwork unveiled|date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=January 19, 2010|work=[[Blabbermouth]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720200726/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122849|archivedate=July 20, 2009}}</ref> The track "A Tap Dancer's Dilemma" was made available through the band's MySpace page on July 7, 2009.<ref name="blabber-dilemma" /><ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Ascendance Records]]|url=http://ascendancerecords.com/site/news/new-diablo-swing-orchestra-and-whyzdom-tracks-online-pre-order-info|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=January 19, 2010|title=New Diablo Swing Orchestra and Whyzdom tracks online + pre-order info|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713014607/http://ascendancerecords.com/site/news/new-diablo-swing-orchestra-and-whyzdom-tracks-online-pre-order-info/|archive-date=July 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> They also announced that two Special Edition prints of the album would be available to pre-order along with the regular album.

=== ''Pandora's Piñata'' (2011–2014) ===
On January 24, 2011, the band announced on Facebook that trumpetist Martin Isaksson and trombonist Daniel Hedin, which were both featured as guests on ''Sing Along Songs for the Damned & Delirious'', had joined Diablo Swing Orchestra as full-time members.

On October 9, 2011, the band revealed their 3rd album title: ''[[Pandora's Piñata]]''.
[[File:Diablo+Swing+Orchestra+fredrik+magnil+photo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|AnnLouice Lögdlund, the band's second female vocalist, was a part of the line-up from 2005 to 2014.]]
On March 29, 2012, the band announced on Facebook that Petter Karlsson was leaving the band; he was still featured on the upcoming album, as he had already recorded all his parts. The band publicly thanked him "for all the fun times together as well as for all the hard work he has put into the band". Karlsson stated "DSO is a band which foundation is made from a bunch of great guys, with great ideas, great enthusiasm and 100% motivation. I just feel that I can’t mobilize that amount of greatness and enthusiasm, without having a bigger share of the artistic creation and in addition to limited financial gain. I just have too much other things going in my life right now. And I really want to continue working on my own projects. So therefore I leave the drum throne to someone who can put the right amount of energy into it. DSO deserve that".<ref>https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10151425163395316&id=61680950315</ref> Johan Norbäck filled in as drummer for the rest of the ongoing tour, and eventually became a full-time member.

On April 9, 2012, the band released the new album's first single, "Voodoo Mon Amour" through their Facebook page.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=305872336149003&id=61680950315</ref>

''Pandora's Piñata'' was released on May 14, 2012 in Europe, and May 22 in North America. It received rave reviews from music critics.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/diabloswingorchestra/fr/Diablo-Swing-Orchestra-Pandoras-Pinata-Review.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-11-20 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AxDnv3WA?url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/diabloswingorchestra/fr/Diablo-Swing-Orchestra-Pandoras-Pinata-Review.htm |archive-date=2012-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Monger, James Christopher [http://www.allmusic.com/album/no-3-pandoras-pi%C3%B1ata-mw0002352213 Pandora's Pinata review.] Allmusic.com.

=== ''Pacifisticuffs'' (2014–2019) ===
On August 16, 2014, the band announced that AnnLouice Lögdlund was leaving Diablo Swing Orchestra as a mutual decision, as her opera career "exceedingly has taken up more and more of her time". They also announced Kristin Evegård as her replacement, and that she would be featured on their upcoming single, "Jigsaw Hustle", which was released later that year.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/61680950315/photos/a.10150598590430316.672691.61680950315/10154422415085316/?type=1</ref>

They immediately started working on their next album, ''[[Pacifisticuffs]]'', which was recorded between July and October 2016, and set for a late 2016 release; it was eventually postponed for a year due to [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] issues, and was eventually released on December 8, 2017.<ref name="ReleaseDate">{{cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/diabloswingorchestra/photos/a.10153378028355316.1073741825.61680950315/10159333138605316/?type=3&theater|title=So the moment is finally here!|date=July 12, 2017|accessdate=October 14, 2017|publisher=DSO's official [[facebook]]}}</ref> It was preceded by two singles, "Knucklehugs" on November 3 and "The Age of Vulture Culture" on December 1, and included a re-recorded version of "Jigsaw Hustle".

==Mythology==
The origin of the name of the band is related on their website. The tongue-in-cheek [[back-story]] recounts a historically questionable ancestral story beginning in [[History of Sweden|16th-century Sweden]]. Supposedly, [[ancestors]] of the band members performed orchestral works in defiance of the ruling church at the time (possibly in reference to the newly installed [[protestant]] [[Lutheran]] national church, in power during the mid- and late 16th century). The [[orchestra]] was forced to go into hiding, performing in secret, with the assistance of oppressed [[peasants]] during the era. After years of performing for the pleasure of these peasants, the story claims that the church put a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on the performers' lives, and that this bounty was so high that the orchestra knew they would soon be captured, and thus chose to play a spectacular final show before becoming [[martyred]] to the church.<ref name="candlelight" />
