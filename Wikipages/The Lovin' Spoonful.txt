'''The Lovin' Spoonful''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band popular during the mid- to late-1960s.  Founded in New York City in 1965 by lead singer/songwriter [[John Sebastian]] and guitarist [[Zal Yanovsky]], it is best known for a number of hits, including "[[Summer in the City (The Lovin' Spoonful song)|Summer in the City]]", "[[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe In Magic]]", "[[Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?]]", and "[[Daydream (The Lovin' Spoonful song)|Daydream]]".  The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2000.

==Career==
===Formation and early years (1964–1965)===
The band had its roots in the folk music scene based in the [[Greenwich Village]] section of lower Manhattan during the early 1960s. [[John Sebastian|John B. Sebastian]], the son of classical harmonicist [[John Sebastian (classical harmonica player)|John Sebastian]], grew up in the Village in contact with music and musicians, including some of those involved with the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1950s through the early 1960s. Sebastian formed the Spoonful with guitarist [[Zal Yanovsky]] from a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[folk music|folk]] group playing local coffee houses and small clubs called [[The Mugwumps (band)|The Mugwumps]], two other members of which, [[Cass Elliot]] and [[Denny Doherty]], later formed half of [[the Mamas & the Papas]].<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/the-mugwumps-the-mugwumps/ Pop Matters entry on the Mugwumps CD reissue]. Popmatters.com, Retrieved January 5, 2009.</ref> The formation of the Lovin' Spoonful during this period was later described in the lyrics of the Mamas & the Papas' [[name drop]]ping 1967 top ten hit, "[[Creeque Alley]]".<ref>Phillips, John and Michelle, [https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tqafuu2fcmf7h4afuhrdhfkxk2y?lyrics=1&pcampaignid=kp-lyrics "Creeque Alley" (song lyrics)] play.google.com. May 30, 2015.</ref>

Drummer Jan Carl and bassist Steve Boone rounded out the group, but Carl was replaced by drummer-vocalist [[Joe Butler]] after the group's first gig at The Night Owl in Greenwich Village. Butler had previously played with Boone in a group called The Kingsmen (not the hit group of "Louie Louie" fame). The group's first Night Owl performances were reportedly so bad that the club owner told them to go away and practice, so they practiced in the basement of the nearby Hotel Albert until they had improved enough to draw audience attention.<ref>Roxon, Lillian.

The group made its first recordings for [[Elektra Records]] in early 1965, and agreed in principle to sign a long-term deal with Elektra in exchange for a $10,000 advance. However, [[Kama Sutra Records]] had an option to sign the Lovin' Spoonful as recording artists as part of a previously signed production deal, and Kama Sutra exercised the option upon learning of Elektra's intent to sign the band.<ref>Holzman, Jac and Gavan Daws (1998). ''Follow the Music: The Life and Times of Elektra Records in the Great Years of American Pop Culture'', FirstMedia, {{ISBN|096612211-9}}, p. 124.</ref> The four tracks recorded for Elektra were released on the 1966 various artists compilation LP ''[[What's Shakin']]'' after the band's success on Kama Sutra.

===Pop success (1965–1966)===

The band worked with producer [[Erik Jacobsen]] to release their first single on July 20, 1965, "[[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]", written by Sebastian. Additionally, they wrote their own material (aside from a few covers, mostly on their first album),<ref name="RS">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071120175448/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thelovinspoonful/biography Rolling Stone Magazine entry for The Lovin' Spoonful.].

Retrieved January 5, 2009.</ref> including "[[Younger Girl]]" (which missed the Hot 100), which was a hit for [[The Critters]] in mid-1966.

"Do You Believe in Magic" reached #9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], and the band followed it up with a series of hit singles and albums throughout 1965 and 1966, all produced by Jacobsen.  The Lovin' Spoonful became known for such folk-flavored pop hits as "[[You Didn't Have to Be So Nice]]", which reached #10, and "[[Daydream (The Lovin' Spoonful song)|Daydream]]", which went to #2.<ref name="RS" /><ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the lovin' spoonful|bio=true}}|title=The Lovin' Spoonful Music News & Info|publisher=Billboard.com|access-date=October 14, 2010}}</ref>  Other hits included "[[Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?]]" (another #2 hit) and "[[Summer in the City (The Lovin' Spoonful song)|Summer in the City]]", their only song to reach #1 on the Hot 100 (August 13–27, 1966).  Later that year, the #10 hit "Rain on the Roof" and the #8 hit "Nashville Cats" (which went on to become a staple in the concerts of bluegrass legend Del McCoury) completed the group's first seven consecutive Hot 100 hits to reach that chart's top 10.<ref>[[Casey Kasem]], "[[American Top 40]]", 8 May 1976.</ref>  The only other 1960s act to achieve that feat is [[Gary Lewis & the Playboys]].

The Lovin' Spoonful was one of the most successful pop/rock groups to have [[jug band]] and folk roots, and nearly half the songs on their first album were modernized versions of blues standards. Their popularity revived interest in the form, and many subsequent jug bands cite them as an inspiration. The rest of their albums featured mostly original songs, but their jug band roots showed up again and again, particularly in "Daydream" and the lesser-known "Money" (which reached only #48, in 1968), featuring a typewriter as percussion.

Lovin' Spoonful members termed their approach "good-time music". In the liner notes of "Do You Believe in Magic," Zal Yanovsky said that he "became a convert to [[Reddy Kilowatt]] because it's loud, and people dance to it, and it's loud."  Soon-to-be members of the psychedelic rock band the [[Grateful Dead]] were part of the West Coast acoustic folk music scene when the Lovin' Spoonful came to town on tour. They credited the Lovin' Spoonful concert as a fateful experience, after which they decided to leave the folk scene and "go electric". {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

At the peak of the band's success, the producers of the television series that later became ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' initially planned to build their series around the Lovin' Spoonful, but dropped the band from the project due to conflicts over song publishing rights.<ref>Lefcowitz, Eric.

The Lovin' Spoonful's song "Pow!" was used as the opening theme of [[Woody Allen]]'s first feature film, ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily]]''; the band also composed and played instrumental music for the film and appeared in some live performance sequences in the film (reportedly added during post-production without Allen's knowledge or consent).<ref>Gubbels, Jason, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dujUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA130 "Wild Man Blues: Woody's Great American Songbook"], in ''The Ultimate Woody Allen Film Companion'' (Bailey, Jason), Voyageur Press, 2014, p. 130. {{ISBN|978-0-7603-4623-5}}.</ref><ref>Slifkin, Irv.

===Personnel changes (1967)===
In early 1967, the band broke with their producer Erik Jacobsen, turning to [[Joe Wissert]] to produce the single "Six O'Clock", which reached #18 in the U.S.

Yanovsky left the band after the soundtrack album ''You're a Big Boy Now'' was released in May 1967, primarily due to a drug bust in San Francisco, in which he was arrested for possession of marijuana and pressured by police to name his supplier. He was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizen and feared that he would be barred from re-entering the U.S., so he complied.<ref name="Sony">[http://sonylegacy.iventastage.com/The-Lovin-Spoonful/Biography.aspx Sony Legacy Recordings biography entry for the Lovin' Spoonful.

Yanovsky, Sebastian and Boone all independently concurred in interviews that Yanovsky's sacking was due to Yanovsky's open disenchantment with the band's direction and Sebastian's songwriting. Sebastian's music was becoming "more personal" while Yanovsky desired a (probably unachievable) return to their early years club scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTNakT7_Q6o&index=1&list=RDUTNakT7_Q6o|title=Zal Gets Canned From The Lovin' Spoonful|last=Zacky Dog|date=June 20, 2015|access-date=March 18, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

Yanovsky's replacement was [[Jerry Yester]], formerly of the [[Modern Folk Quartet]]. Around this time, perhaps coincidentally, the band's sound became more pop-oriented.

The new line-up of the Lovin' Spoonful recorded two moderately successful Wissert-produced singles ("She Is Still a Mystery" and "Money"), as well as the 11-cut ''Everything Playing'', issued in December 1967. Sebastian, whose final show may have been May 10, 1968, at Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, left the group by the end of the month to go solo.<ref> [https://www.newspapers.com/image/513092582/?terms=john%20sebastian%20lovin%20spoonful%20Susquehanna&match=1 "Rock and Roll Group Appears at Susquehanna"], The Daily Item newspaper, Sunbury, Pennsylvania, May 8, 1968. Retrieved November 20, 2020, from Newspapers.com</ref><ref name="Sony"/>

===Final years (1968–1969)===
The group was now officially a trio, and drummer Butler (who had previously sung lead on a few album tracks) became the group's new lead vocalist. Up to this point Sebastian had written (or co-written) and sung every one of the Lovin' Spoonful's hits; the band now turned to outside writers for their singles, and used a variety of outside producers. The band's last two Hot 100 entries, "Never Goin' Back (to Nashville)" written by [[John Stewart (musician)|John Stewart]] and "Me About You", were sung by Butler. In addition, "Never Goin' Back" only featured Yester and Butler's playing—the other musical parts were played by session musicians, which had not occurred since drummer [[Gary Chester]] played on ''Do You Believe In Magic.''<ref>Nicholls, Geoff. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9EVMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT128#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Drum Book: A History of the Rock Drum Kit'']. Backbeat Books, 2008, p. 128. {{ISBN|9781476854366}}.</ref> "Never Goin' Back" was the highest-charting single of the group's post-Sebastian career, topping out at #73.

With commercial success waning, the Lovin' Spoonful lasted only until early 1969. They split up following the release of their album ''Revelation: Revolution '69''. In 1969 Boone produced an album for Mercury Records by a group known as The Oxpetals, a cosmic rock band inspired by The Moody Blues' "[[In Search of the Lost Chord]]". When the album failed to chart Boone bought a sailboat and lived aboard for the next 4 years in the Caribbean. In 1973 he moved back to Baltimore, Maryland, took over a recording studio built by engineer George Massenburg, and renamed it Blue Seas after a ship that was salvaged in the Caribbean. Blue Seas went on to record many well known artists, among them Lowell George and Little Feat, who recorded "Feats Don't Fail Me Now" there, Robert Palmer and The Seldom Scene.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

In 1970, following John Sebastian's 1969 solo performance at [[Woodstock]], Kama Sutra issued the song "Younger Generation" as a single. Sebastian had closed his Woodstock set with the song.<ref>Perone, James E.

Greenwood Press, 2005, p. 149. {{ISBN|0-313-33057-3}}.</ref> The single version was taken from the two-year-old ''Everything Playing'' album and credited to "The Lovin' Spoonful featuring John Sebastian"; it failed to chart.

In 1976, however, a solo Sebastian scored another No. 1 Hot 100 hit with "[[Welcome Back (John Sebastian song)|Welcome Back]]", the theme song to the ABC sitcom, ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]''.  On this recording, Murray Weinstock (a current member of the Lovin' Spoonful) is playing piano.<ref>{{cite web |title=John Sebastian – Welcome Back |url=https://www.discogs.com/John-Sebastian-Welcome-Back/release/5640469 |website=Discogs |access-date=14 July 2019}}</ref>

===Reunions, revivals, and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction (1979–present)===
The original group (Sebastian, Yanovsky, Butler and Boone) reunited briefly in the fall of 1979 for a show at the Concord Hotel in the [[Catskills]] for an appearance in the [[Paul Simon]] film ''[[One-Trick Pony (film)|One Trick Pony]]'', which was released in October 1980.

In 1991, after a long-awaited settlement with their record company, Butler and Boone decided to start up the Lovin' Spoonful again with [[Jerry Yester]]. They were joined by Jerry's brother, Jim Yester (vocals and guitar), formerly of [[The Association]]. Sebastian and Yanovsky declined to participate. In March 1992 drummer John Marrella was added to the band to allow Joe Butler to concentrate on vocals. After a two-month rehearsal in the [[Berkshire Mountains]], the group started touring, with Joe Butler now the most common lead singer. Keyboardist David Jayco was added in June 1992. Jim Yester left this new grouping in March 1993 and was replaced by guitarist Randy Chance. Jerry's daughter, Lena Yester (vocals and keyboards), replaced David Jayco at the same time. Randy Chance was sacked in June 1993 and was not replaced. Mike Arturi replaced John Marrella on drums in March 1997 and Phil Smith joined on guitar in 2000 replacing Lena Yester.

The original four members of the Lovin' Spoonful were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on March 6, 2000.<ref name = "RRHOF">[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/lovin-spoonful/ Rock and Roll Hall of Fame entry for the Lovin' Spoonful]. Rockhall.com, Retrieved January 5, 2009.</ref> All four original members appeared at the ceremony and performed "[[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]" and "[[Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?]]".

Yanovsky died in 2002.<ref name="Independent" /> Sebastian has stated that he no longer wishes to perform with the remaining members of the group because he wanted to move on when he left the group.<ref>[http://www.classicbands.com/JohnSebastianInterview.html Interview with John Sebastian] Classic Bands web site.

Jerry Yester was fired from the group in 2017 after being arrested on 30 counts of child pornography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2017/10/11/the-lovin-spoonful-kicks-out-guitarist-jerry-yester-child-porn/|title=The Lovin' Spoonful Kicks Out Guitarist Jerry Yester After Child Porn Arrest|website=Tmz.com|access-date=March 18, 2018}}</ref>

In February 2020, the three surviving original members (Sebastian, Boone and Butler) performed together as The Lovin’ Spoonful for the first time in 20 years as part of the Wild Honey Orchestra’s all-star tribute to the band. The concert benefited the Autism Think Tank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/reviews/lovin-spoonful-tribute-reunion-john-sebastian-review-1203520407/|title=Lovin’ Spoonful Daydreams Come True as John Sebastian Goes All-In for Tribute Show|first=Chris|last=Willman|website=Variety.com|date=March 2, 2020|access-date=June 13, 2021}}</ref>

[[Paul McCartney]] has stated that "[[Good Day Sunshine]]" was "really very much a nod to The Lovin’ Spoonful's ‘Daydream,’ the same traditional, almost trad-jazz feel.

==Name==
The band's name was inspired by some lines in a song of [[Mississippi John Hurt]] called the "Coffee Blues". [[John Sebastian]] and others in the jug-folk scene of the time such as [[Geoff Muldaur]] credit [[Fritz Richmond]] for suggesting the name.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.locoloboevents.com/cgi-bin/locolobo/displaybio.pl?010 | title = Biography: John Sebastian – Book John Sebastian for Corporate Events, Private Parties, Fundraisers: | access-date = August 13, 2012 | date = December 13, 2011 | publisher = Locolobo Events | quote = Sebastian recalls, "I told him our sound was kind of like Chuck Berry meets Mississippi John Hurt and he immediately chimed in, 'Why not call it the Lovin' Spoonful?'&nbsp;}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnbsebastian.com/bio2.html |title=John Sebastian Biography (page 2) |work=John B.

The song "Coffee Blues" is a tribute to [[Maxwell House]] Coffee, which Hurt describes, "rapping" in the beginning of the song, as being two or three times any other brand, ergo, he only needs one spoonful to make him feel all right, what he describes as "my lovin' spoonful" in the song. The song is part of a group of songs with a long history in recorded blues that generally use the term "a spoonful" to suggest sex, and in some cases use of a drug such as cocaine.<ref>Komara, Edward, ed.

Haruki Murakami mentions them in [[What I Talk About When I Talk About Running]] as an "old favorite" stating: "Today I ran for an hour and ten minutes, listening on my Walkman to two albums by the Lovin’ Spoonful—Daydream and Hums of the Lovin’ Spoonful...I love listening to the Lovin’ Spoonful. Their music is sort of laid-back and never pretentious." [[Murakami, H. (2009). What I talk about when I talk about running. Vintage Books.]]
