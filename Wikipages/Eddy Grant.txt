In this period he also worked as a songwriter and producer for other artists, including [[Symarip|the Pyramids]] (producing their debut single "Train Tour to Rainbow City") and [[Prince Buster]], for whom he wrote "Rough Rider", and started the Torpedo record label, releasing British-made [[reggae]] singles.<ref name="Thompson" />

On 1 January 1971, Grant suffered a [[heart attack]] and [[collapsed lung]], leading to his departure from the Equals to concentrate on production, opening his own Coach House Studios in the grounds of his [[Stamford Hill]] home in 1972, and starting [[Ice Records]] in 1974, initially distributed by [[Pye Records]] and later by [[Virgin Records]].<ref name="Gregory" /><ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Lewis" /> He produced [[The Pioneers (band)|the Pioneers]]' 1976 album ''Feel the Rhythm'', as well as early recordings by his younger brother [[Rudy Grant|Rudy]], working under the name the Mexicano.<ref name="Thompson" /> During this time he also branched out of music, learning to [[tap dance]], and subsequently trying his hand at acting at the behest of fellow Guyanese immigrant, actor [[Norman Beaton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/03/how-we-made-eddy-grant-electric-avenue |title=How we made Eddy Grant's Electric Avenue |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=3 September 2018 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>

A self-titled solo album released in 1975 made little impact, as did the proto-[[soca music|soca]] ''[[Message Man]]'', completed and released in 1977, on which Grant played all the instruments himself.<ref name="Thompson" /> His breakthrough as a solo artist came two years later with the album ''[[Walking on Sunshine (Eddy Grant album)|Walking on Sunshine]]'', which spawned the UK top 20 hit "Living on the Frontline".<ref name="Thompson" /> He returned to the charts in 1980 with the top 10 hit "[[Do You Feel My Love]]", the opening track of ''[[Can't Get Enough (Eddy Grant album)|Can't Get Enough]]'', the 1981 album giving him his first entry in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="OCCGrant">"[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17701/eddy-grant/ Eddy Grant]", [[Official Charts Company]].

Grant returned to the charts in 1988 with the anti-apartheid single "[[Gimme Hope Jo'anna]]", a no. 7 hit in the UK.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Lewis" /><ref name="OCCGrant" /> The song was banned by the South African government.<ref name="Perry">Perry, Andrew (2008) "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3555191/How-Eddy-Grant-gave-hope-to-South-Africa.html How Eddy Grant gave hope to South Africa]", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 27 June 2008.
