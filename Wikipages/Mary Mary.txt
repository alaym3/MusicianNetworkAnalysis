Their followup album ''[[Incredible (Mary Mary album)|Incredible]]'' (2002), reached number one on the [[Billboard charts|Top Gospel Albums]] chart. Their self-titled third album, ''[[Mary Mary (album)|Mary Mary]]'' (2005), which contains themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, contains the worldwide hits "Heaven", "The Real Party", and "Yesterday". Their song “Can’t Give Up Now” was acknowledged by NBA Point Guard, Chris Paul after winning the NBA Western Conference Finals on the night of June 30th, 2021.

Their fourth album ''[[The Sound (Mary Mary album)|The Sound]]'' (2008) spawned the number-one singles "[[Get Up (Mary Mary song)|Get Up]]" and "[[God in Me]]". In 2011, they released their fifth studio album "[[Something Big (Mary Mary album)|Something Big]]" and followed up with a compilation album "[[Go Get It (album)|Go Get It]]" in 2012 before going on hiatus. In March 2012, they premiered their own television series, ''[[Mary Mary (TV series)|Mary Mary]]'', on [[WE tv]].

Mary Mary has sold more than eight million records worldwide to date. The duo have been nominated for eleven Grammy Awards, winning four times including once [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance|Best Gospel Performance]] and for [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Gospel Album|Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album]]. The duo are often credited for broadening the fan base of [[urban contemporary gospel]] in the 2000s by introducing elements of [[soul music]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]] and [[jazz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/3543955/Thankful |title= Thankful |publisher=Lyrics.com}}</ref> The group's name is inspired by two famous Marys from the Bible: [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], and [[Mary Magdalene]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelflava.com/reviews/marymary.html |title=Reviews&nbsp;– Mary Mary |publisher=GospelFlava.com |date=May 2, 2000 |access-date=April 15, 2012}}</ref> They also performed at the White House in 2005.

==Early years==
The Atkins sisters, born [[Erica Campbell (musician)|Erica Monique]] and [[Tina Campbell (musician)|Trecina Evette]], grew up in a large family with seven siblings in [[Inglewood, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tlcnaptown.com/180791/five-things-you-should-know-about-mary-mary/ |title= Five Things You Should Know About Mary Mary |publisher=tlcnaptown.com |date=March 2013}}</ref> Their mother, Thomasina Atkins, is an [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and [[choir director]] at the [[Church of God in Christ]]. Their father, Eddie A. Atkins, was also a member of the [[Church of God in Christ]], and a youth counselor, before he died in 2013.

Due to their proximity in age, the two sisters grew up closer to one another than to any of their siblings:<ref name="marymarybio"/> Darrell Atkins (born 1965, the only living boy- the second boy died as a child), Maliea Atkins (born 1967), Erica (born 1972), Tina (born 1974), Delisa Atkins-Brown (born 1977), Thomasina Atkins (born 1978), Alana Atkins-Jamison (born 1985), and Shanta Atkins (born 1986). Later, they would work creatively with over half of their siblings; Thomasina, Alana, Delisa and Shanta Atkins all sing background on Mary Mary's albums and during stage performances and Delisa was originally a member of the group but left before they started recording professionally due to pursuing college.<ref name="marymarybio"/> Eventually, all eight Atkins children united on the [[Bobby Jones Gospel]] show on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]].

During this time, Erica and Trecina entered the world of church choirs, traveling gospel shows, and television productions. The sisters enrolled at [[El Camino College]] to study voice. There they encountered the division between rigorous academic study of music versus the popular musical world. "We had to study classical and sing [[aria]]s, which was fine," Erica told Times, "but the teachers would tell us if we sang anything else it would damage our instrument."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/09/entertainment/ca-49907 |title= Making Gospel You Can Dance To |date=July 2000}}</ref> In 1995 the two toured with Michael Matthews' traveling gospel shows, ''Mama I'm Sorry'' and ''Sneaky''. Each sister subsequently toured as a backup singer for a variety of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] acts, including [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].

==Career==
===1999&ndash;2001: ''Thankful''===
{{Main|Thankful (Mary Mary album)|l1=Thankful}}
After meeting producer [[Warryn Campbell]], a publishing deal was reached with music conglomerate [[EMI Music Publishing|EMI]]. This led to a series of their songs being on movie soundtracks; they wrote "Dance" and performed it with [[Robin S.]] for the soundtrack to the 1998 film ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]],'' they performed "Let Go, Let God" for  ''[[The Prince of Egypt]],'' and several of their songs were recorded by [[702 (band)|702]]. However, the sister's profile really started to rise in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] industry when their songs "Time To Change" and "Yeah" were recorded by [[Yolanda Adams]] on ''[[Mountain High... Valley Low]]''. During this time, Mary Mary as a musical entity formed.

The duo was subsequently signed to [[Columbia Records]] and decided to perform under the name Mary Mary, honoring [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], and [[Mary Magdalene]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.player.listenlive.co/33641/en/artist/04_fcbee78e-efc5-41d6-aad1-fb38e4fee99a/biography |title=Mary Mary |date=2017 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> They were the first [[Gospel music|gospel]] act to record for the industry giant [[Columbia Records]] since [[Tramaine Hawkins]] in the mid-1990s. Their first single "[[Shackles (Praise You)]]" became a crossover hit; enticing gospel, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[Pop music|pop]] audiences. It ranked Top 5 in [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], Top 10 for [[Pop music|pop]] hit, and peaked at number 28 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It became the first gospel song in five years to crack the [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] top ten and gained wide exposure on [[MTV]]. Their debut album ''[[Thankful (Mary Mary album)|Thankful]]'' was released in May 2000; it peaked at number one on the [[Official Christian & Gospel Albums Chart|Gospel Album Chart]] and climbed to 59 on the overall Top 200 chart. Overall, the album was certified [[Platinum certification|Platinum]] for shipments of one million copies in the United States, it went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album]]. While the second single "[[I Sings]]" features rapper [[BB Jay]], both were hits in the UK and Europe. Their only Top 10 UK hit to date is "[[Shackles (Praise You)]]" which reached number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in June 2000. The follow-up "[[I Sings]]" peaked at UK number 32.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums

===2002: ''Incredible''===
{{Main|Incredible (Mary Mary album)|l1=Incredible}}
With their second album, ''[[Incredible (Mary Mary album)|Incredible]]'', the duo was able to maintain their success. Soon after its release in July 2002, it was number one on the [[Official Christian & Gospel Albums Chart|Gospel Albums Chart]] and entered the Top 20 of the Top 200 album chart. ''[[Incredible (Mary Mary album)|Incredible]]'' was later certified [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|Gold]] for selling 500,000 copies in the United States. The album's singles were "In The Morning" and "I Try". While this album charted higher than their debut, sales were lower. The duo attributed the lower sales to less aggressive promotion due to label switch-overs and the advent of [[music piracy]]. In November 2003, they released their biography ''Transparent''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transparent|first1=Tina|last1=Campell|first2=Sherri|last2=Mitchell|date=November 3, 2003|publisher=[[Taylor Trade Publishing]]|isbn = 1566251923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTtestYDbfQC}}</ref>
