==Music style and influences==
Many media outlets compare the band to [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Meat Loaf]] because of its use of theatrics and over-the-top lyrics. Andrew Winney stated, "If [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Freddie Mercury]] had a love child it would be Foxy Shazam vocalist Eric Sean Nally."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.purplerevolver.com/music/reviews/122039-the-darkness-live-review-and-pictures-(sheffield).html|title=The Darkness - live review and pictures (Sheffield) > Music Reviews > Music &#124; Purple Revolver|website=Purplerevolver.com|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref> The magazine ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' compared the band to bands like [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[My Chemical Romance]], and [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], while also believing that the band has a unique sound that should best be seen live.<ref>''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', issue #264, pp. 58–59.</ref>

==Origin of their name==
The band name was claimed to have originated from a slang phrase used by students at vocalist Eric Sean Nally's high school. "Foxy shazams" meant 'cool shoes'. (e.g. "Damn, those are some foxy shazams!").<ref name="apin">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=282785|title=Interview on November 27, 2007|work=[[Absolute Punk]]}}</ref> In a Rockline radio interview in March 2012, Nally stated that this was not the case; by saying that the truth is not as interesting as real life. He had been lying about it for five years and it just stuck. This was later confirmed by Alex Nauth and Aaron McVeigh in an interview with Norse Media in July 2012.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhO6Iz5lmss|title=Foxy Shazam (Bunbury Music Festival)|date=22 July 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>
