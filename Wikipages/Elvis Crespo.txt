'''Elvis Crespo Díaz''' (born July 30, 1971, in [[New York City]]) is a Puerto Rican singer and songwriter of the Merengue genre. He has won multiple awards, including a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and a [[Latin Grammy Award]] in [[Merengue music|merengue]].

==Early years==
Crespo was born in [[New York City]] and was named "Elvis" after [[Elvis Presley]]. He was raised in the city of [[Guaynabo]], [[Puerto Rico]], where he spent his childhood and adolescent years.

==Musical career==
He first gained fame in the mid-90s when he joined [[Grupo Mania]], in Puerto Rico. Eventually he decided to try to go solo in 1998. His debut album, Suavemente was a hit, both in Latin America and in the US. The single "[[Suavemente (song)|Suavemente]]" was a huge hit and eventually helped him earn the Best Male Tropical/Salsa Album of the Year from Billboard magazine. His album went platinum in the Venezuelan and Central American markets and gold in Chile. Released in 1998, Crespo's debut also earned a gold album for sales of over 500,000 copies in the first year after its release in the United States. "Suavemente" set a record for holding the top position on Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks chart for six weeks. Part of the song's success was its unexpected crossover appeal to English-speaking listeners, particularly in Miami and New York."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003179/Elvis-Crespo.html|title=Elvis Crespo Biography|website=Musician Guide}}</ref> His album was mostly merengue influenced, but his follow-up albums would venture from these roots eventually. ''Wow Flash!'' is Elvis Crespo's third solo recording for [[Sony Music]]. Elvis Crespo's latest album, ''Regresó el Jefe'', went on sale on 5 June 2007, with its first single being "La Foto Se Me Borró." He dedicated this album to his niece, Wilmarie Agosto Crespo, who died in a car accident on March 28, 2007. In 2016 Elvis was featured on [[Deorro]]'s number one hit song "Bailar" which was featured on a [[Target Corporation]] Commercial.
