In modern usage, an '''orgy''' is a [[Group sex#Types of sex party|sex party]] consisting of at least five members<ref>{{cite web |last=Stieg |first=Cory |date=2018-12-13 |title=When Does Group Sex Become an Orgy: An Investigation |url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-an-orgy |website=Refinery29 |access-date=2021-04-05}}</ref> where guests freely engage in open and unrestrained [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[group sex]].

[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinger]]s' parties do not always conform to this designation, because at many swinger parties the [[sexual partner]]s may all know each other or at least have some commonality among economic class, educational attainment or other shared attributes. Some swingers contend that an orgy, as opposed to a sex party, requires some anonymity of sexual partners in complete sexual abandon.<ref name="differences cited in Swinger Survey Results on Difference Between Orgies and Group Sex">{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/the-swinger-blog/orgies-and-group-sex/ | title=Swinger Survey Results on Difference Between Orgies and Group Sex | publisher=The Swingers Blog | date=October 2010 | access-date=April 26, 2012 | author=Wojick, Helen}}</ref> Other kinds of "sex party" may fare less well with this labeling.

Participation in an "orgy" is a common [[sexual fantasy]], and group sex targeting such consumers is a subgenre in [[pornographic film]]s. 

The term is also used metaphorically in expressions, such as an "orgy of colour" or an "orgy of destruction" to indicate excess, overabundance. The term "[[wikt:orgiastic|orgiastic]]" does not generally connote group sex and is closer to the [[orgia|classical roots]] and this metaphorical usage.

==Ancient ''orgia''==
{{Main article|Orgia}}

In [[ancient Greek religion]], ''[[orgia]]'' (ὄργια, sing. ὄργιον, ''orgion'') were [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic rites]] characteristic of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greek and Hellenistic mystery religions]]. Unlike public religion, or the private religious practices of a household, the mysteries were open only to initiates, and were thus "secret". Some rites were held at night. ''Orgia'' were part of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], the [[Dionysian Mysteries]], and the cult of [[Cybele]], which involved the [[Galli|castration of her priests]] in a frenzied trance. Because of their secret, nocturnal, and unscripted nature, the ''orgia'' were subject to prurient speculation and regarded with suspicion, particularly [[Religion in ancient Rome|by the Romans]], who attempted to [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|suppress the Bacchanals]] in 186 BC. ''Orgia'' are popularly thought to have involved sex,<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Shipley |first=Joseph T. |year=1963 |title=orgyan |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofearl0000ship_q7b8/page/472/mode/2up |url-access=registration |encyclopedia=Dictionary of Early English |location=Paterson, NJ |publisher=Littlefield, Adams & Co. |isbn=0-8065-2926-1 |pages=472–473}}</ref> but, while [[Religion and sexuality|sexuality]] and fertility were cultic concerns, the primary goal of the ''orgia'' was to achieve an ecstatic union with the divine.

==In films==
Orgy scenes are featured in various films, including ''[[Zoolander 2]]'', ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', ''[[Sausage Party]]'' and ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stern |first1=Marlow |date=27 December 2012 |title=The 21 Craziest Moments in 'The Wolf of Wall Street': Cocaine-Fueled Orgies and More |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/17/the-21-craziest-moments-in-the-wolf-of-wall-street-cocaine-fueled-orgies-and-more.html |work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref>
