'''Behemoth''' is a Polish [[extreme metal]] band from [[Gdańsk]], formed in 1991. They are considered to have played an important role in establishing the Polish extreme metal underground.<ref name=allmusicbiography>{{cite web | title = Biography | url = http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:anfexqegldhe~T1 | publisher = Allmusic.com | access-date = 2009-05-24 | archive-date = 2020-09-11 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200911080549/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/behemoth-mn0000789429 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Until the late 1990s, the band played a traditional [[black metal]] style with heathen lyrical content, but soon changed to that of [[occult]] and [[thelema|thelemic]] themes written by their lead vocalist [[Adam Darski|Nergal]] and Krzysztof Azarewicz. With the 1999 release of ''[[Satanica (album)|Satanica]]'', the band demonstrated their presence in the death metal scene, while retaining their own signature style characterized by the drum work of [[Zbigniew Robert Promiński|Inferno]] and multi-layered vocals. Despite Behemoth having been labeled as [[death metal]] or [[thrash metal]]-influenced, Nergal has mentioned that he does not like the band to be labeled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.guitarworld.com/metalkult/videos/behemoth-the-metalkult-interview/|title=BEHEMOTH: The Metal Kult Interview|last=Guitar World|publisher=[[Wayback Machine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921222423/http://blogs.guitarworld.com/metalkult/videos/behemoth-the-metalkult-interview/|archive-date=2008-09-21|access-date=2008-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalwarrants.com/interviews/behemoth.html|title=Interview with Nergal|publisher=[[Wayback Machine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112110701/http://www.metalwarrants.com/interviews/behemoth.html|archive-date=2007-11-12}}</ref>

==History==

===Early career and first five albums (1991–2000)===
Behemoth was formed in 1991 as a trio, with [[Adam Darski|Nergal]] on guitar and vocals, [[Adam Muraszko|Baal]] on the drums, and Desecrator on the guitar. They started with the demos ''[[Endless Damnation]]'', and ''The Return of the Northern Moon''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.behemoth.pl/site/index.php/eng#discography |title=Behemoth |publisher=Behemoth.pl |access-date=2011-10-19 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66kvA3ju2?url=http://www.behemoth.pl/site/index.php/eng#discography |archive-date=2012-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The most significant however, was the fourth demo—''[[...From the Pagan Vastlands]]'' (1994). This tape was released by Polish label [[Pagan Records]], and later on through [[Wild Rags]]. Their next release was ''[[Sventevith (Storming Near the Baltic)]]'' in 1995. A year later, they recorded their second album ''[[Grom (album)|Grom]]'', which was released in 1996. ''Grom'' features many different influences and musical styles, using female vocals as well as acoustic guitars and synthesizers. At the same time, Behemoth finally got a chance to play live shows in its native country and finally tour around Europe, gaining stage experience. Two years later, the band recorded a third album, titled ''[[Pandemonic Incantations]]''. The culmination of their increasing presence and metal media set a new standard for them.<ref>{{cite web | title = Behemoth - Pandemonic Incantations Review - sputnikmusic | url = http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=4196 | access-date = 2009-05-23 | archive-date = 2012-04-21 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/675A8rzra?url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/4579/Behemoth-Pandemonic-Incantations/ | url-status = live }}</ref> However, due to a lack of promotion, the album was not well publicized. After another extensive tour, Behemoth signed a two-album deal with Italy's [[Avantgarde Music]] in the fall of 1998. The first result of this new collaboration was the successful<ref>{{cite web | title = CoC : Behemoth - Satanica : Review | url = http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/reviews/albums/2-1382_behemoth_satanica.aspx | access-date = 2009-05-23 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090624182042/http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/reviews/albums/2-1382_behemoth_satanica.aspx| archive-date= 24 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> album ''[[Satanica (album)|Satanica]]'', on which the black metal sound had evolved into [[blackened death metal]].

The label also secured two European tours for the band in support of [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] and [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] respectively. During that period, Behemoth had to go through some line-up changes and had problems with their ex-Polish label. By the time ''Satanica'' came out, Inferno and Les were out of the band. Nergal began looking for new members but could not find a new drummer. Inferno returned to the band in early 2000, along with new members [[Marcin Nowak (musician)|Novy]] (formerly known from Devilyn, [[Vader (band)|Vader]] and Dies Irae), who handled the bass duties, and Havok, who became the band's guitarist. After the line-up changes Behemoth signed with the Polish label [[Mystic Production]]. The follow-up release to ''Satanica'' was ''[[Thelema.6]]''. Massive guitar parts and precise drumming, with influences from different sources, saw them progress further towards<ref>{{cite web | title = CoC : Behemoth - Thelema.6 : Review | url = http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/reviews/albums/2-1835_behemoth_thelema6.aspx | access-date = 2009-05-24 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090623095114/http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/reviews/albums/2-1835_behemoth_thelema6.aspx| archive-date= 23 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = MetalBite Thelema.6 Review by Chad on 2/17/2002 | url = http://www.metalbite.com/tracks.asp?album=714 | access-date = 2009-05-24 | archive-date = 2007-11-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071123001538/http://www.metalbite.com/tracks.asp?album=714 | url-status = live }}</ref> [[blackened death metal]].

''Thelema.6'' was supported by the worldwide press and media,<ref name=allmusicbiography/> including official releases in Russia and Brazil for the first time. Continuing the support for ''Thelema.6'', Behemoth appeared in several prestigious live events like [[Wacken Open Air]], [[With Full Force]], [[Inferno Metal Festival]], Mystic Festival, and Mind Over Matter Autumn. They started their first headlining tour alongside [[Carpathian Forest]] and [[Khold]], followed by a festival tour in Poland (Thrash em All Fest. with [[Vader (band)|Vader]] and [[Krisiun]], among others).

===''Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond)'', ''Demigod'' and ''The Apostasy'' (2001–2008)===
[[File:Behemoth @ 70000 tons of metal 2015 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Nergal in 2015]]
In 2001, Behemoth focused on writing new material for a sixth studio album. Meantime, they completed their second headlining tour in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Having completed the recording of their new songs, Behemoth entered Hendrix Studio for the second time, with help of their friend and sound engineer Arkadiusz Malczewski, and produced ''[[Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond)]]''.

In February 2003, the band started their first tour in Norway, playing in cities such as [[Bergen]], [[Oslo]] and [[Stavanger]]. On March 11, 2003, the American premiere, scheduled by [[Century Media]] Records, headlined Behemoth's first appearance in the American continent. The tour started on the 9th of March at the New Jersey's Metalfest and continued with a decent number<ref>{{cite web | title = The Coalition for Muzikal Armageddon North America Tour 2003 | url = http://behemoth.pl/en/main.php?src=archiwum#2003 | access-date = 2009-05-24 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> of shows across America and Canada, with the company of [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Revenge (Canadian band)|Revenge]], Vehemence and [[Amon Amarth]]. Shortly after doing their first US tour the band was invited to join the Blackest of the Black Tour by [[Glenn Danzig]].

In fall 2003, Behemoth flew to the US to complete their third tour with [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]], [[Skinless]] and [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]]. The band then played at the Tuska Festival in Finland with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Soulfly]], among others. At that time, due to some line up difficulties, Nergal parted his ways with Havok and Novy, who decided to focus on activities with their own bands. Eventually, the band resumed touring in the UK and Europe.

In 2004, their seventh studio album, ''[[Demigod (album)|Demigod]]'', was released to good critical response. Recorded at the Hendrix Studios, the album debuted at number 15 on the national Polish album charts. Music videos for the songs "Conquer All" and "Slaves Shall Serve" were also shot. In fall 2005, the band headlined the Demigod supremacy Canadian tour 2005 with Necronomicon.

In 2007, the band toured Europe alongside [[Napalm Death]], [[Moonspell]] and [[Dew-Scented]]. Behemoth released their eighth studio album ''[[The Apostasy]]'' in July of that year. It was recorded at Radio Gdańsk studio in December, 2006. Shortly after the release of ''The Apostasy'', the band was featured as one of [[Ozzfest]] 2007's second stage headliners, one of the four non-US bands playing that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=27576 |title=Ozzfest |publisher=Metalunderground.com |access-date=2011-10-19 |archive-date=2011-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606060227/http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=27576 |url-status=live }}</ref> In October/November 2007, they played their first US headlining tour alongside [[Job for a Cowboy]], [[Gojira (band)|Gojira]], and [[Beneath the Massacre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apeshit.org/2007/08/14/job-for-a-cowboy-behemoth-to-co-headline-radio-rebellion-tour/ |title=Radio Rebellion Tour |publisher=Apeshit.org |date=2007-08-14 |access-date=2011-10-19 |archive-date=2008-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513155625/http://www.apeshit.org/2007/08/14/job-for-a-cowboy-behemoth-to-co-headline-radio-rebellion-tour/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In October/November 2007 the band toured Europe alongside Canadian death metal combo [[Kataklysm]] and Belgium's [[Aborted]].

===Nergal's illness, recovery and ''The Satanist'' (2010–2016)===
In August 2010, Nergal was rushed to a hospital and was diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. It was reported that his leukemia was so advanced that [[chemotherapy]] couldn't help him; however, that has been proven false. [[Doda (singer)|Doda]], his girlfriend at that time, offered her bone marrow for a transplant but tests showed she wasn't a match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvp.info/informacje/ludzie/nergal-czeka-na-szpik/2378233 |title=Nergal czeka na szpik |publisher=Tvp.Info |access-date=2011-10-19 |archive-date=2011-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004125656/http://www.tvp.info/informacje/ludzie/nergal-czeka-na-szpik/2378233 |url-status=dead |language=pl |trans-title=Nergal is waiting for marrow}}</ref> A donor was subsequently found.

On January 17, 2011, Nergal left the hematology division of Uniwersyteckie Centrum Kliniczne, four weeks after he underwent a bone marrow transplant procedure.

He also announced that he was eager to resume playing the guitar again, its having been six months since he last played. He also said that he had a huge motivation and desire to continue his work with the band, thanking all people who helped him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.behemoth.pl/site/index.php/eng#calosc.377.NERGAL_RELEASED_FROM_HOSPITAL! |title=Behemoth |publisher=Behemoth.pl |access-date=2011-10-19 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66kvA3ju2?url=http://www.behemoth.pl/site/index.php/eng#calosc.377.NERGAL_RELEASED_FROM_HOSPITAL! |archive-date=2012-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Controversy==
In July 2007, the All-Polish Committee for Defense Against Sects distributed to many Polish officials a list of bands that allegedly promote [[Satanism]] and [[murder]]. Critics of this policy primarily see this as a violation of [[free speech]]. The list has not gone into effect, and Behemoth were allowed to play in Poland freely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/marilyn_manson_behemoth_banned_to_perform_in_poland.html |title=Marilyn Manson and Behemoth Banned to Perform in Poland: News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date=2007-06-18 |access-date=2011-10-19 |archive-date=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012173445/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/marilyn_manson_behemoth_banned_to_perform_in_poland.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=89919 |title=Behemoth banned to perform in Poland/Bible-tearing incident: News @ blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2011-10-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604131917/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=89919 |archive-date=2011-06-04 }}</ref> In October 2014 this changed when Behemoth was banned from performing in [[Poznań]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,16754011,Rektor_odwolal_koncert_Behemotha_w_Poznaniu___Czcza.html |title=Rektor odwołał koncert Behemotha w Poznaniu |access-date=2014-10-08 |archive-date=2014-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007223753/http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,16754011,Rektor_odwolal_koncert_Behemotha_w_Poznaniu___Czcza.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
