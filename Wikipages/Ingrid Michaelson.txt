Michaelson's bandmate, [[Allie Moss]] released a 2009 EP, ''Passerby''. Its song "Corner" was selected by [[British Telecommunications]] in the UK for their [[BT Infinity]] television commercials. Other past and present band members include Chris Kuffner (bass), [[Bess Rogers]] (guitar), Saul Simon MacWilliams (keys), Billy Libby (guitar), Sarab Singh (drums) and [[Elliot Jacobson]] (drums).

In 2010, Michaelson co-wrote the song "[[Parachute (Cheryl Cole song)|Parachute]]" with [[Marshall Altman]] which was covered by British singer [[Cheryl Cole]] on her debut solo album ''[[3 Words]]''; it peaked at #5 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Michaelson initially believed the track was "so [[pop music|poppy]]" that she could not release it herself. However, after the song was reworked by "[[Everybody (Ingrid Michaelson album)|Everybody]]" producer [[Dan Romer]] to make a more "interesting, funky production", Michaelson released the song as a personal single.<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenblatt|first=Leah|date=2010-10-18|title=Ingrid Michaelson's 'Parachute' video: An EW exclusive premiere |url= https://ew.com/article/2010/10/18/ingrid-michaelson-parachute-video-cheryl-cole/|access-date=2012-02-10|work= Entertainment Weekly| via= EW.com}}</ref> There are two different music videos for the song.

Of the release of "Parachute" and upcoming material, Michaelson explained in a 2010 interview with ''[[Billboard.com]]'', "I just felt like I wanted to put something out. I'm not ready to put a full album out, so we thought we'd put this out and see how people take it or don't take it." She said that she expects to release her next album, "probably in the middle of next year".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/956153/ingrid-michaelson-aims-for-less-ukulele-more-synths-on-new-single|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110531130409/http://www.billboard.com/#/news/ingrid-michaelson-aims-for-less-ukulele-1004116373.story|title=Ingrid Michaelson Aims for 'Less Ukulele, More Synths' on New Single| archive-date=May 31, 2011|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

In 2012, Michaelson and Laswell co-wrote and sang the duet "Landline", which appeared on his album of the same name.

Her 2014 album, ''Lights Out'', was a collaborative effort. "On all my previous records, I'd written all the songs myself. It was one producer and me locked in a room for months," she said. "Not that that was bad, but I think that everything has a season. I never wanted to kind of give up control. I think I'm letting go of a lot of things – embracing the idea of allowing people to help me in all facets of my life. I think that I was a bit of a control freak, and I'm just more open to letting people be part of things that they weren't part of before. It's really liberating. I had the best time ever on the last record. It was just really wonderful to be able to share the success with other people."<ref>{{cite web |last=Pound |first=Kara |url=http://staugustine.com/compass/2015-02-06/ingrid-michaelson-progresses-indie-sweetheart-bona-fide-pop-star#.VPN25vnF-So |title=Ingrid Michaelson progresses from Indie sweetheart to bona-fide pop star |work= [[The St. Augustine Record]] |date=February 6, 2015 |access-date=March 1, 2015}}</ref> Michaelson has also appeared on ''[[The Nerdist Podcast]]'' with [[Chris Hardwick]].
