'''Viktor Robertovich Tsoi''' ({{lang-ru|Ви́ктор Ро́бертович Цой}}; 21 June 1962 – 15 August 1990) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Russian singer and songwriter who co-founded [[Kino (band)|Kino]], one of the most popular and musically influential bands in the history of Russian music.

Born and raised in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (now [[Timeline of Saint Petersburg|Saint Petersburg]]), Tsoi started writing songs as a teenager. Throughout his career, Tsoi contributed a plethora of musical and artistic works, including ten albums. After Kino appeared and performed in the 1987 Soviet film ''[[Assa (film)|Assa]]'', the band's popularity surged, triggering a period referred to as "Kinomania", and leading to Tsoi's leading role in the 1988 [[Cinema of Kazakhstan#Late 1980s-early 1990s: Kazakh New Wave|Kazakh new wave]] [[art film]] ''[[The Needle (1988 film)|The Needle]]''. In 1990, after their high-profile concert at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]], Tsoi briefly relocated to Latvia with bandmate [[Yuri Kasparyan]] to work on the band's next album. Two months after the concert, Tsoi died in a car collision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rigathisweek.lv/event/cultural_agenda/heavy/cabaret-band-silver-wedding-bellorussia/381|title=Cabaret Band Silver Wedding /Bellorussia/|website=Cabaret Band Silver Wedding /Bellorussia/ - Riga This Week|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatchbox.net/index.php/2013/07/14/retour-en-urss-gloire-du-soviet-rock-et-de-viktor-tsoi/|title=Retour en URSS : gloire du Soviet Rock et de Viktor Tsoï|date=14 July 2013|website=Dispatchbox.net|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

He is regarded as one of the pioneers of [[Russian rock]] and is credited with popularizing the genre throughout the Soviet Union. He retains a devoted following in many ex-Soviet countries, such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Lithuania, where he is known as one of the most influential and popular people in the history of Russian music.

==Early life==
Viktor Robertovich Tsoi was born in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] on 21 June 1962. He was the only child of Valentina Vasilyevna Tsoi (born Guseva) (1939–2009), a Russian schoolteacher, and Robert Maximovich Tsoi (1938–), a [[Koryo-saram|Soviet-Korean]] engineer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7t0-nZ6KfU|title=Родители Виктора Цоя в пер.

Tsoi grew up in the vicinity of the [[Moskovsky Victory Park]]. He was born in a maternity hospital on Kuznetsovskaya Street (located inside the park). The family lived in the notable "general's house" at the corner of [[Moskovsky Avenue]] and Basseynaya Street (the building is now an architectural monument).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://petersburglike.ru/2015-08-23/dom-so-shpilem-ili-generalskij-dom/|title=Дом со шпилем или "Генеральский дом"|date=23 August 2015|website=Petersburglike.ru|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> For some time Tsoi studied at a nearby school in Frunze Street, where his mother worked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/piter/2012/06/21/994918.html|title=Здесь жил Цой|website=Rosbalt.ru|date=21 June 2012}}</ref>

From 1974 until 1977, Tsoi attended a secondary art school, where he was a member of the band Palata # 6 ({{lang-ru|Палата № 6}}, ''Ward # 6'').<ref>[[#Zhitinsky|Zhitinsky]], p. 50</ref> From 1977, he attended the [[Tavricheskaya Art School|Serov Art School]], until he was expelled in 1979 for poor performance.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} Afterwards, he attended SGPTU-61, where he was studying to become a wood carver.<ref>[[#Zhitinsky|Zhitinsky]], p. 64</ref> In his youth, he was a fan of [[Mikhail Boyarsky]] and [[Vladimir Vysotsky]], and later [[Bruce Lee]], after whom he started modelling his image.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lichnosti.net/people_60.html|title=Виктор Цой (Victor Tsoy).

==Career==
Tsoi began writing songs at the age of 17. In the 1970s and the 1980s, rock music was an underground movement limited mostly to Leningrad; [[Moscow]] pop stars, endorsed by the Soviet state, ruled the charts and received the most exposure from the media. However, rock music was not popular with the government, and rock bands received little to no funding and were given little exposure by the media. The [[Leningrad Rock Club]] was one of the few public places where rock bands were allowed to perform.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tsoi was a close friend of Alexei Rybin. Rybin, a member of the hard rock band Piligrimy ({{lang-ru|Пилигримы|lit=Pilgrims}}), and Tsoi, who played bass guitar in the group Palata # 6 ({{lang-ru|Палата № 6|lit=Chamber # 6}}), met at the house of Andrei "Svin" Panov, in whose apartment people and musicians often gathered, and also where his own punk band [[Avtomaticheskie udovletvoriteli]] rehearsed. By this time, Tsoi had begun to perform the songs he wrote at parties.

Tsoi and Rybin, as members of Avtomaticheskie udovletvoriteli, went to Moscow and performed punk-rock metal at [[Artemy Troitsky]]'s underground concerts. During a similar performance in Leningrad on the occasion of [[Andrei Tropillo]]'s anniversary, Tsoi and Rybin first met [[Boris Grebenshchikov]]. Later, after a solo concert by Grebenshchikov, they met up and Tsoi played two of his songs to him.<ref>[http://lichnosti.net/people_60.html Viktor Tsoi's biography] at the website lichnosti.net</ref> Grebenshchikov, who had already been a relatively established musician in the Leningrad underground scene, was very impressed by Tsoi's talent and helped him start up his own band.

===Beginnings of Kino===
At the Leningrad Rock Club, Tsoi played as a solo artist supported by members of the band [[Aquarium (band)|Aquarium]]. Tsoi's lyrics and music impressed the crowd. In the summer of 1981, Tsoi, Rybin, and Oleg Valinsky formed the band Garin i giperboloydy ({{lang-ru|Гарин и Гиперболоиды|lit=Garin and the hyperboloids}}). The name was a homage to the classic Russian novel ''[[The Garin Death Ray|The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin]]'' by [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy|Aleksey Tolstoy]]. In autumn of the same year, the band was admitted to membership of the Leningrad Rock Club. Not long after, Valinsky was conscripted into the army, leaving only Tsoi and Rybin, who renamed the band to Kino. Kino began recording its debut album in the spring of 1982.

===First albums===
Kino began recording its debut album, ''[[45 (Kino album)|45]]'', in the spring of 1982 at Andrei Tropillo's studio. Members of Aquarium also took part in the recording, with Boris Grebenshchikov directing the album. By the summer, the album was completely finished. Its duration was 45 minutes, after which the album was named ''45''. The album got some distribution and Kino performed in many apartment concerts in Moscow and Leningrad.

On 19 February 1983, a joint concert with Kino and Aquarium took place. After the concert, [[Yuri Kasparyan]] was invited to join the band as a guitarist. In the spring, Rybin left Kino due to disagreements with Tsoi. Tsoi and Kasparyan spent the summer on joint rehearsals. As a result, Kino recorded the album ''46'', which was initially thought of as a demo for ''[[Nachalnik Kamchatki]]'' ({{lang-ru|Начальник Камчатки|lit=Chief of Kamchatka}}). ''46'' was widely distributed and was considered to be a full-fledged album. In the fall of 1983, Tsoi went to a psychiatric hospital in Pryazhka, where he spent a month and a half. As a result, Tsoi was not conscripted into the army.<ref name="rockcult.ru">{{Cite web|url = http://rockcult.ru/viktor-coj-v-25-faktah-o-nem/|title = Виктор Цой в 25 фактах о нем – Rock Cult|website = Rock Cult|language = ru-RU|access-date = 9 March 2016}}</ref> After being discharged from the psychiatric hospital, he wrote the song "Trankvilizator" ({{lang-ru|Транквилизатор|lit=Tranquilizer}}).<ref>{{cite book| author = Tsoi, Marianna | chapter = Точка отсчета| title = Виктор Цой.

''[[Khochu peremen|"Peremen!/"My zhdyom peremen" ("Changes!"/"We are waiting for changes")]]'', first performed by Tsoi in the summer of 1986, quickly became an important political song, an embodiment of the spirit of the [[Perestroika]]. It remains a powerful political song, prominently used during [[2020–2021 Belarusian protests]].

===Rise to fame===
1987 was a breakthrough year for Kino. The release of [[Kino discography|their 6th album]] ''[[Gruppa krovi (album)|Gruppa Krovi]]'' ({{Lang-ru|Группа крови|lit=Blood Type}}) triggered what was then called "Kinomania". The open political climate under glasnost allowed Tsoi to make ''Gruppa Krovi'', his most political album, yet it also allowed him to record a sound of music that no one before him had been able to play. Most of the tracks on the album were directed at the youth of the Soviet Union, telling them to take control and make changes within the nation; some of the songs addressed the social problems crippling the nation. The sound and lyrics of the album made Tsoi a hero among Soviet youth and Kino the most popular rock band ever. In the diverse Soviet republics, fans translated his originally Russian lyrics into their native languages as well.

Over the next few years, Tsoi appeared in several successful movies and also travelled to the United States to promote his films at film festivals. Several more albums were released, their themes were once again mostly political, further fueling the band's popularity. Even though Tsoi was a huge star, he still lived a relatively ordinary life. He kept his old job in the boiler room of an apartment building, called Kamchatka, which is currently a museum/club dedicated to the singer. The fact that he worked at a boiler plant surprised many people. Tsoi said that he enjoyed the work and he also needed the money to support the band, as they still received no government support and their albums were copied and passed around the nation via ''[[magnitizdat]]'' free of charge. This made Tsoi even more popular among the people because it showed that he was down to earth and they could relate to him. He also went on tour in 1988–1989 to Italy, France, and Denmark. Kino's finest hour came in 1990 with a concert at Moscow's [[Luzhniki Stadium]]; 62,000 fans filled the stands to celebrate the triumph of the USSR's most successful rock group. It also was one of the four times the Luzhniki Olympic Fire was ever lit.

===Film appearances===
In 1987, the band Kino, along with other [[Russian rock]] bands, appeared as themselves in ''[[Assa (film)|Assa]]'' ({{Lang-ru|Асса}}), a film by [[Sergei Solovyov (film director)|Sergei Solovyov]]. However, the film as a whole has nothing to do with Rock, and Kino simply appears as a cameo in the end.

In 1988, Viktor Tsoi starred as the protagonist in ''[[The Needle (1988 film)|The Needle]]'' ({{lang-ru|Игла|translit=Igla}}), directed by [[Rashid Nugmanov]] and written by Aleksandr Baranov and Bakhyt Kilibayev. The plot is centered around the character Moro, who returns to [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, to collect money owed to him. While waiting out an unexpected delay, he visits his former girlfriend Dina and discovers she has become a morphine addict. He decides to help her kick the habit and fight the local drug mafia responsible for her condition. But Moro finds a deadly opponent in "the doctor," the mafia kingpin who is exploiting Dina.<ref>Written by Forrest Ciesol for IMDB</ref> Tsoi was nominated for an award for his role in the film.<ref name="rockcult.ru"/>

The film's soundtrack, including original music by Tsoi's band Kino, contributes to the overall feeling of the movie, in addition to the film's use of post-modern twists and surreal scenes.

The movie was officially released in February 1989 in the Soviet Union.

==Death==
[[File:Mourning ceremony Victor Choi.jpg|thumb|right|Tsoi's fans mourning in Leningrad]]
On 15 August 1990 in Latvia, Tsoi was driving on the [[Sloka, Latvia|Sloka]] – [[Talsi]] highway, near [[Tukums]] and [[Riga]]. At 12:28&nbsp;p.m., Tsoi died in a car collision. The investigation concluded that Tsoi had [[Sleep-deprived driving|fallen asleep while driving]], possibly due to [[fatigue]];<ref name="rian">[http://www.rian.ru/infografika/20070815/71713181.html Схема аварии на сайте РИА Новости].

''Sovetskaya Molodezh'', Latvia</ref> Tsoi was pronounced dead at the scene. The bus driver was not injured. Tsoi's car was completely destroyed to the point that one of its tires was never found.

The death of Viktor Tsoi was a shock to many fans, some even having committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ria.ru/20070815/71713181.html|title=Гибель Цоя: как произошла авария на трассе Слока-Талси. ИНФОграфика|date=15 August 2007|website=Ria.ru|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> On 17 August, ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', one of the main Soviet newspapers, had the following to say about Tsoi and his meaning to the youth of the nation:

{{Quotation|1=Tsoi means more to the young people of our nation than any politician, celebrity or writer. This is because Tsoi never lied and never sold out. He was and remains himself. It's impossible not to believe him... Tsoi is the only rocker who has no difference between his image and his real life, he lived the way he sang... Tsoi is the last hero of rock.}}

On 19 August, he was buried in a closed casket at the [[Bogoslovskoe Cemetery]] in Leningrad. Thousands of people came to the funeral.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Kasparyan left for Leningrad prior to the collision, with a tape containing the only recording of Tsoi's vocals for the band's next album. The remaining members of Kino finished and released the ''[[Black Album (Kino album)|Black Album]]'' in December. It later became the band's most popular creation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==Personal life==
Viktor lived with his wife, Marianna Tsoi, and his son Alexander (born 1985). Tsoi lived a poor life, with Marianna saying that they couldn't even afford a proper wedding dress. The apartment building boiler room he worked at was nicknamed "Kamchatka", and is now the site of a museum and rock club dedicated to Tsoi.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fedorova|first=Anastasiia|date=15 August 2017|title=Remembering Viktor Tsoi: why the rebellious rock poet is still a hero for our time|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/8741/viktor-tsoi-rockstar-soviet-music|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=[[The Calvert Journal]]}}</ref> He previously also worked in Kiev, Ukraine, however after the authorities found out he was working illegally, he was sent to Moscow.

During the filming of ''[[Assa (film)|Assa]]'', Tsoi met Natalia Razlogova, the director's assistant. Tsoi later fell in love with Razlogova and separated from Marianna. However, they did not divorce, for the sake of their son.<ref name="Биография Виктора Цоя">{{Cite web|url = http://ria.ru/spravka/20150815/1181465291.html|title = Биография Виктора Цоя|website = РИА Новости|date = 15 August 2015}}</ref>

In 2012, on what would have been Tsoi's 50th birthday, the remaining members of Kino gathered to record the song "Ataman" ({{Lang-ru|«Атаман»}}), with his vocals that were recovered from his car crash but never used because of its poor quality. The drummer [[Georgy Guryanov|Georgiy Guryanov]] died shortly after, making "Ataman" the last song recorded by Kino and its members.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
