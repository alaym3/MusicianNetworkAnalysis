'''Dirty Projectors''' is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], formed in 2002. The band is the project of singer-songwriter [[David Longstreth]], who has served as the band's sole constant member throughout numerous line-up changes. The band's current line-up consists of Longstreth, alongside Mike Daniel Johnson (drums), [[Bobby (band)|Maia Friedman]] (vocals, guitar, keyboards), [[Ava Luna|Felicia Douglass]] (vocals, percussion, keyboards) and Kristin Slipp (vocals, keyboards). 

Since its formation, Dirty Projectors has released eight full-length studio albums, with the project featuring major contributions from co-lead vocalist and guitarist [[Amber Coffman]] from 2006 to 2013.<ref>{{Cite news

}}</ref> Following the release of ''[[Rise Above (Dirty Projectors album)|Rise Above]]'' (2007), an album of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] songs as re-imagined from memory, Dirty Projectors released their break-through album, ''[[Bitte Orca]]'' in 2009. Featuring lead vocals from Longstreth, Coffman, and [[Angel Deradoorian]], the album received widespread critical acclaim and increased the band's exposure significantly. Its follow-up, ''[[Swing Lo Magellan]]'' (2012) was released to further acclaim.

The band is currently based in [[Los Angeles, California]] and released five EPs across 2020.

== History ==
=== Early years and ''Rise Above'' (2002–07) ===
While studying at [[Yale University|Yale]], Longstreth spent part of the years 2001 and 2002 working on a number of musical ideas, together with his brother [[Jake Longstreth|Jake]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> With the help of [[Adam Forkner]] of [[Yume Bitsu]], Longstreth recorded and released ''[[The Glad Fact]]'' on the [[Western Vinyl]] label under the name "The Dirty Projectors" in 2003. Two years later, the band released ''[[The Getty Address]]'', a concept album about the musician [[Don Henley]] that features extensive orchestral and choral accompaniment. The stripped-down ''[[New Attitude EP]]'' followed in 2006 and featured inklings of the band's later vocal interplay and guitar work.

In 2007, the band released ''[[Rise Above (Dirty Projectors album)|Rise Above]]'', an album of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] songs as re-imagined from memory. The album introduced the band's distinctive contrast between Longstreth's vocals and the [[hocket]]ed harmonies of [[Amber Coffman]] and Susanna Waiche, who was later replaced by [[Angel Deradoorian]]. In support of the album, the band performed songs for a Take Away Show acoustic video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].

=== Domino Records, ''Bitte Orca'', and ''Mount Wittenberg Orca'' (2008–11) ===
In April 2008, Dirty Projectors signed with [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]], and the label announced the release of their fifth full-length album, ''[[Bitte Orca]]'', for June 9, 2009. ''Bitte Orca'' introduced additional backing vocalist/auxiliary percussionist Haley Dekle as a new member and bassist [[Nat Baldwin]] returning to the band (he previously was a member of Dirty Projectors from 2005 to 2006). That year, the band also collaborated with [[David Byrne]] on the song "Knotty Pine" for the compilation album ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. Byrne joined the Dirty Projectors onstage to perform this song, along with "Ambulance Man," another collaborative track not included on the compilation, at the "Dark Was the Night Live" concert at New York City's Radio City Music Hall on May 3, 2009.

“Stillness Is the Move" was the first single released from ''Bitte Orca'', a [[West African music|West African]] and [[alternative R&B]]-influenced hybrid, sung by Coffman and inspired by the Wim Wenders film ''[[Wings of Desire]]''.<ref>{{cite news

On May 8, 2009, members of Dirty Projectors collaborated with [[Björk]] to perform an original composition by Longstreth, written for five voices and acoustic guitar, as part of a charity concert to benefit [[Housing Works]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing shelter for homeless men, women, and children suffering from AIDS. The concert was held at the Housing Works Bookstore & Café in downtown New York City.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> After the release of tracks "Keep Your Name", "Little Bubble" and "Up in Hudson", it was announced that the seventh, [[Dirty Projectors (album)|self-titled album]], would be released on February 24, 2017 via Domino. The album was ultimately released three days early, on February 21, 2017. It marked a return to the group's solo roots for Longstreth (who at this point relocated to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to build a recording studio called "[[Ivo Shandor]]"), introduced a more [[electronica|electronic-based]] [[alternative R&B]] sound, and addressed his breakup with Coffman, his former bandmate and girlfriend.<ref name=Breakup />

The following year, on July 13, 2018, Dirty Projectors released their eighth album, ''[[Lamp Lit Prose]]'', after teasing three singles, "Break Thru", "That's a Lifestyle", and "I Feel Energy". The touring of the album marked the revival of Dirty Projectors as a group project, with David Longstreth on lead vocals and guitar; returning members Nat Baldwin and Mike Daniel Johnson on bass/bass synth and drums, respectively; and introducing Maia Friedman on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals, Felicia Douglass on percussion, keyboards, and backing vocals, and Kristin Slipp on keyboards and backing vocals.

In late 2018, the band recorded a live in-studio album at New York City's Power Station to capture road-tested live arrangements of songs they had been performing on the ''Lamp Lit Prose'' tour. The album, ''Sing the Melody'' was released on December 10, 2019 on Domino Documents.

=== Five EPs (2020) ===
In 2020, the band announced that it would release five EPs throughout the year, with Longstreth noting: "For me, this cycle of EPs is about growth, transition, liminal space, shifting identity. [[Allen Ginsberg]] had a phrase, 'first thought, best thought,' to talk about a particular kind of writing — not [[automatic writing]] exactly, but quick, spontaneous, trusting. For me, these songs are about rediscovering that place, after the stereo [[ouroboros]] of the Ivo Shandor [Studio] era (''[[Dirty Projectors (album)|Dirty Projectors]]'' & ''[[Lamp Lit Prose]]''). And I think for us — Felicia, Maia, Kristin, Mike and me — it’s about finding it for the first time: playing, writing, learning together as a new band."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CB2_UNrDRPi/|title=Dirty Projectors Instagram Post|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2020-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Yoo|first=Noah|title=Dirty Projectors Announce New EP Series, Share Video for New Song|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/dirty-projectors-announce-new-ep-series-share-video-for-new-song-watch/|access-date=2021-04-24|website=Pitchfork|language=en-US}}</ref>

The first EP, ''Windows Open'' was released on March 27, 2020.
