==Childhood and early career==
Pedro Infante was the son of Delfino Infante García (24 December 1880 – 17 March 1955), who played the double bass in a band, and Maria del Refugio Cruz Aranda.<ref name=gob /> He was the third of fifteen children, of whom nine survived. Although the Infante Cruz family stayed for some time at [[Mazatlán]], in early 1919 they moved to [[Guamúchil]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Castaneda |first=Ulises Castaneda |date=14 April 2017 |title=Pedro Infante, el ídolo más humilde del mundo (Pedro Infante, the most humble idol in the world |url=https://encuadres.com.mx/nota/800/-pedro-infante-el-iacutedolo-maacutes-humilde-del-mundo |magazine=Revista Encuadres |location=Mexico City, Mexico |publisher=Revista Encuadres |access-date=10 November 2020}}</ref> In 1920 they moved to [[El Rosario, Sinaloa]]. As a teen, Infante showed talent and affection for music, and even made his own guitar in a carpenter shop, played in the Luis Ibarra Orchestra led by his father, and formed his own band called ''La Rabia'' (The Anger) in 1933.<ref name=rasmussen /><ref name=orozco>{{cite magazine |last=Orozco |first=Hector |date=16 November 2017 |title=Pedro Infante, el nacimiento de un ídolo (Pedro Infante, the birth of an idol) |url=https://cultura.nexos.com.mx/?p=14029 |magazine=Nexos |location=Mexico City, Mexico |access-date=5 November 2020}}</ref> He managed to learn strings, wind, and percussion instruments in a short time, having received music lessons from Carlos R.

In addition, he won a charro suit in an amateur contest at the Colonial Theater, singing ''[[Vereda Tropical]]''.<ref name=orozco /> In 1937 he became part of the Orquesta Estrella de Culiacán (Culiacán Star Orchestra), as a singer as well as violinist and drummer, for a year and a half.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gaytán Apáez |first=Leopoldo |date=15 April 2011 |title=La vigencia de Pedro Infante (The validity of Pedro Infante |url=http://correcamara.com/inicio/int.php?mod=noticias_detalle&id_noticia=2588 |work=Corre Camara |location=Mexico City, Mexico |access-date=5 November 2020}}</ref>

His wife, María Luisa León, who died of cardiac arrest on 27 October 1978, was somewhat well-off, economically. According to her memoir ''Pedro Infante en la intimidad conmigo'' (1961) (''Pedro Infante in intimacy with me''),<ref>{{cite book |last=León de Infante |first=María Luisa |date=1961 |title=Pedro Infante en la intimidad conmigo |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/pedro-infante-en-la-intimidad-conmigo/oclc/24130873 |location=Mexico |publisher=Mexico |oclc=24130873 }}</ref> she convinced him of the need to move to [[Mexico City]] to find better career opportunities in radio.<ref name=rasmussen /> In 1938, at the age of 21, he auditioned for a position at the radio station XEB with Julián Morán accompanying him on piano. Ernesto Belloc who was the station's artistic director at the time, advised him that he had better continue his career as a carpenter as Infante had been nervous during the audition. The following week they allowed him to audition again, this time being hired to sing three times a week on the air.<ref name=regio />

In Mexico City, he sang the songs of composers including Alberto Cervantes, [[José Alfredo Jiménez]], [[Cuco Sánchez]], [[Tomás Méndez]], [[Rubén Fuentes]], (some of the most renowned composers from the golden age of Mexican Cinema) [[Salvador Flores Rivera]] (Chava Flores) (better known for his humorous songs), [[René Touzet]] and others. His first musical recording ''El Soldado Raso'' (''The [[Private (rank)|Private]]'') was made on 19 November 1943, for the [[Peerless Records]] Company. Infante first appeared as an extra in the movie ''En un Burro Tres Baturros'' (''Three Men from Aragon on a Donkey''), or the more correct and succinct transliteration, "Three ''Baturros'' on a Burro". His career as an actor in leading roles started with ''La Feria de Las Flores'' (''The Fair of Flowers''), literally translated as "The Flower Carnival," in 1943.
In that same year, a friend and neighbor of Infante's wife, [[Carmen Barajas Sandoval]], offered to introduce them to [[Jorge Negrete]], a singer whom he admired. Barajas, who knew people in the business as she was the aunt of the child actress [[Angélica María]], worked then at the [[Union of Cinema Production Workers|Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Producción Cinematográfica]], S.T.P.C. (''Union of Cinema Production Workers''). She succeeded in convincing Negrete to recommend Infante to the producer Ismael Rodríguez, and others. As a result, he was invited to appear in different pictures, such as ''Vuelve el Ametralladora'' (''The Machine Gun Returns'').{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

While married to María Luisa León, Infante met the dancer Lupita Torrentera Bablot (b. 2 November 1931), with whom he had three children: Graciela Margarita (26 September 1947 – 20 January 1949, poliomyelitis), Pedro Infante Jr. (31 March 1950 – 1 April 2009, suicide), and Guadalupe Infante Torrentera (b. 3 October 1951). Irma Infante (b. 27 March 1955) was born from his marriage to young actress [[Irma Dorantes]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Los 5 amores del ídolo Pedro Infante (The 5 loves of idol Pedro Infante) |url=https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/celebridades/los-5-amores-del-idolo-pedro-infante-314383.html |work=El Sol de Mexico |location=Mexico City, Mexico |date=14 April 2018 |access-date=3 November 2020}}</ref><ref name=morales />

==Actor==
[[File:Estatua_del_Parque_Pedro_Infante_en_Mérida,_Yucatán_(01).jpg|thumb|right|A statue of Pedro Infante in Mérida Yucatán]]
Infante appeared in such motion pictures as:
* ''[[Tizoc (film)|Tizoc]]'', along with [[María Félix]], gained him the [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] at the [[7th Berlin International Film Festival]], posthumously.<ref name="berlinale 1957" /> The film itself won a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film (Mexico) in 1958.<ref name=gisela>>{{cite news |last=Orozco |first=Gisela |date=6 January 2019 |title='Roma' de Alfonso Cuarón gana en los Golden Globes Mejor Película Extranjera y Mejor Director (Alfonso Cuarón's 'Roma' wins Best Foreign Film and Best Director at the Golden Globes) |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/entretenimiento/ct-hoy-entretenimiento-roma-de-alfonso-cuarn-gana-en-los-golden-globes-20190106-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago, IL, USA |access-date=7 November 2020}}</ref> The Silver Bear and the Golden Globe are housed at the Museo API de Pedro Infante in Isla Arena, Campeche, Mexico, as well as the Ariel award.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Isla Arena, lugar que alberga un museo en honor a Pedro Infante (Isla Arena, a place that houses a museum in honor of Pedro Infante) |url=https://obras.expansion.mx/arquitectura/2014/04/15/isla-arena-lugar-que-alberga-un-museo-en-honor-a-pedro-infante |work=Revista Obras, Expansion |location=Mexico City, Mexico |date=14 April 2014 |access-date=7 November 2020}}</ref>
* The massive migration from the countryside to the cities (mostly to Mexico City) during the 1940s fed the required labor force for rising manufacturing industries. This urbanization created the "working neighborhoods" and the culture of "la vecindad" (group of small apartments around a common patio), and found in Pedro Infante an identifiable icon for these, the new urban working class, with his character ''Pepe el Toro'' (''Pepe the Bull'') in the melodramatic trilogy made up of ''[[Nosotros los Pobres]]'', ''[[Ustedes los ricos]]'', and ''[[Pepe the Bull|Pepe el Toro]]'' (''We the Poor'', ''You the Rich'', and ''Pepe the Bull''), costarring with [[Evita Muñoz]] "Chachita".<ref name=rasmussen />
* He worked with [[Sara García]] ("Mexico's grandmother") in many movies for [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]]. Sara Garcia frequently played the role of his loving but "no nonsense" grandmother in their movies together, in which she constantly tried to get him to behave, but never succeeded.<ref>{{cite news |last=Orozco |first=Gisela |date=16 November 2017 |title=10 películas de Pedro Infante que debes ver (10 Pedro Infante films you should see) |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/entretenimiento/ct-hoy-entretenimiento-10-pelculas-de-pedro-infante-que-debes-ver-20171116-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago Tribune |access-date=8 November 2020}}</ref>
* If that same urbanizing population had the nostalgia for the rural life, and with it the popularity of [[ranchera]] music and the idealized [[charro]], it was not until he played the poor carpenter with a strong [[chilango]] (Mexico City) accent that Pedro Infante achieved a status, at least in Mexico, at the same level of celebrity such as [[Cantinflas]], the Soler Brothers and even [[Jorge Negrete]] and [[María Félix]]. Despite that, he kept on playing the role of the charro and even the northern Mexican rancher (perhaps his most authentic character) in ''Ahí viene Martín Corona'' (''Here comes Martín Corona'') in 1951 and ''Los hijos de María Morales'' (''The Sons of María Morales'') in 1952. When Jorge Negrete died in 1953, Pedro was no longer in the shadow of the international idol, even though Pedro was very affected by the disappearance of his idol. During Negrete's burial service some saw him slightly inebriated, a rare sight given that Infante was not a drinker.
* The Mexican child star [[María Eugenia Llamas]], who was only four at the time, made her screen debut with him in the 1948 film ''[[Los tres huastecos]]'' (''The Three Men from Hausteca'') as "La Tucita", a screen name she used ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal2.dgi.uanl.mx/noticias/descripcion.php%3Fid_not%3D3271&usg=__1ltgJ5QYQOkiVhnjKLLfRYm6sz4=&h=369&w=300&sz=99&hl=en&start=4&um=1&tbnid=g-8pf1xtsLpHRM:&tbnh=122&tbnw=99&prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522Mar%25C3%25ADa%2BEugenia%2BLlamas%2522%2Bcuentos%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4SUNA_enUS266US266%26sa%3DG%26um%3D1|title=La Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León}}{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> She played with him again under the screen name La Tucita in his classic 1949 film comedy, "[[Dicen que soy mujeriego]]" ("They Say I am a Womanizer").<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title='La Tucita': de niña precoz a promotora cultural ('La Tucita': from precocious girl to cultural promoter) |url=https://www.milenio.com/estados/la-tucita-de-nina-precoz-a-promotora-cultural |work=Milenio |publisher=Grupos Multimedios|location=Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico |date=9 January 2014 |access-date=8 November 2020}}</ref>
* One of his better roles was that of Juventino Rosas in the movie "Sobre las Olas" ("''Over the Waves''"), based on the life of the Mexican waltz composer.

The world-famous song ''[[Bésame Mucho]]'' ("Kiss Me a Lot", or more loosely translated to get its elusive Spanish meaning closer to its English meaning, "Give Me a Lot of Kisses"), from the composer [[Consuelo Velázquez]], was the only melody that he recorded in English and he interpreted it in the movie ''A Toda Máquina'' (ATM) (''At Full Speed''), with [[Luis Aguilar (actor)|Luis Aguilar]].<ref name=regio>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Pedro Infante, el desentonado que se convirtió en el máximo intérprete de México (Pedro Infante, the out of tune one who became Mexico's top performer |url=http://elregio.com/Noticia/eece02d4-7c20-41f2-8465-a8f9d41facff |work=El Regio |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=15 April 2017 |access-date=5 November 2017}}</ref>

Infante's hobby was aviation, logging 2,989 flight hours, under the pseudonym Captain Cruz, which then led to his death on the morning of 15 April 1957. Infante had survived two prior plane crashes, the first one occurred in 1947, and another in 1949 in which he had received an injury to his forehead that left him with a metal plate. According to Wilbert Alonzo-Cabrera, his biographer, the actor was co-piloting a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated B-24D]], which had been converted from heavy bomber to freighter in San Diego, California. On the day of the crash, he was on his way to Mexico City from Mérida, Yucatán to challenge the ruling that annulled his marriage with Irma Dorantes. The air traffic controller, Carmen León, was the last person to hear Infante's voice.<ref name=fierro>{{cite news |last=Fierro T. |first=Leonel |date=15 April 1995 |title=Final y vigencia de Pedro Infante (Life and Death of Pedro Infante |url=https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-313517 |work=El Tiempo |location=Bogotá, Colombia |access-date=5 November 2020}}</ref> The plane crashed five minutes after taking off from [[Mérida, Yucatán]], in southeast Mexico.

Infante's death was announced by radio personality Húmberto Sánchez-Rodríguez, of radio station XEMH of Mérida,<ref name=morales /> after one of the firefighters discovered a bracelet engraved with the name "Pedro Infante", plus the winged insignia that symbolized his aviator license.

Two days later he was laid to rest at the Pateón Jardín cemetery amid 300,000 people who had come for the gathered to the closed casket funeral after tribute at the Jorge Negrete Theater.

In 1983, the radio state [[KWKW]], located in Los Angeles, CA, who was at the time broadcasting a Pedro Infante hour that aired songs as well as readings of fan letters, organized a campaign to change one of Boyle Heights street names to Pedro Infante Street. Later it was decided Euclid Heights would become Pedro Infante street, and the unveiling of the street sign was in August 1983.<ref name=rasmussen />

==Legacy==
[[File:Busto de Pedro Infante en Mérida, Yucatán 04.JPG|thumb|right|Pedro Infante's bust in the place he died]]
According to producer Jorge Madrid y Campos, who was also his legal representative, Pedro Infante's fame has increased greatly since his death. Infante attracts a great number of fans of every age to his shrine in the Panteón Jardín of [[Mexico City]], as well as the one at 54th and 87th streets in the historic center of Mérida. Singers of [[ranchera]] and [[mariachi]]{{which |date= June 2021}} have paid posthumous musical homage to him. [[Denise Chávez]], said in her book ''Loving Pedro Infante'': "If you're a [Mexican], and don't know who he is, you should be tied to a hot stove with a yucca rope and beaten with sharp dry corn husks as you stand in a vat of soggy fideos. If your racial and cultural background or ethnicity is other, then it's about time you learned about the most famous of Mexican singers and actors."<ref>Chavez, Denise, "Loving Pedro Infante", Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, (2001), pg. 5.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

In 2017, for what would have been Infante's 100th birthday, his life and career was celebrated with a [[Google Doodle]] that featured a slideshow with six graphics depicting Infante wearing [[Charro outfit|traditional Mariachi garb]], as a singer, a boxer as well as others.<ref>{{cite news |last=Moreno |first=Denisse |date=18 November 2017 |title=Who Is Pedro Infante?

Some fans have speculated that his death was faked.<ref>(Spanish) Jose Ernesto Infante Quintanilla, "Pedro Infante – El Idolo Imortal", Editorial Oceano de Mexico, S.A. De C.V.(2006) pg. 162.</ref> These rumors were fueled by, among other factors, the fact that Infante's body was burned beyond recognition in the airplane crash, and by the appearance, in the 1980s, of a man named Antonio Pedro, who was thought to have resemblance to Infante.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mitos de la muerte de Pedro Infante|url=http://www.aztecanoticias.com.mx/notas/mexico/218359/mitos-de-la-muerte-de-pedro-infante|website=Azteca Noticias|publisher=TV Azteca|access-date=24 October 2015|language=es|date=15 April 2015}}</ref>
