'''The Rascals''' (initially known as '''The Young Rascals''') was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Garfield, New Jersey]], United States, in 1965.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1285/6}}</ref>

Between 1966 and 1968 the [[New Jersey]] act embraced [[soul music]], reaching the top 20 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with nine singles, including the #1s "[[Good Lovin']]" (1966), "[[Groovin']]" (1967), and "[[People Got to Be Free]]" (1968), as well as big radio hits such as the much-covered "[[How Can I Be Sure?]]" (#4 1967) and "[[A Beautiful Morning]]" (#3 1968), plus another critical favorite "A Girl Like You" (#10 1967), becoming one of the best known examples of the [[blue-eyed soul]] genre, along with [[the Righteous Brothers]]. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-young-rascals |title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website |website=Rockhall.com |access-date=2011-11-02}}</ref>

The Rascals were inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010 and also reunited in 2012 for a series of shows in New York and New Jersey. The reunion continued in 2013 with shows on Broadway.

==History==
=== Origins ===
[[Felix Cavaliere]] was already trained in [[Classical music|classical]] piano by his mother when he founded a [[doo-wop]] group, the Escorts (not [[The Escorts (American R&B group)|the R&B group of the same name]]), while enrolled at [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Rascals {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/rascals|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Encyclopedia.com}}</ref>  In 1964, Cavaliere took a job with Joey Dee's backing band, [[Joey Dee and the Starliters|the Starliters]], of the "[[Peppermint Twist]]" fame, where he met Starliter [[David Brigati]]. When the group played the Choo Choo Club in [[Garfield, New Jersey]], Cavalier met Brigati's younger brother, [[Eddie Brigati|Eddie]], who wanted to follow in his brother's footsteps. Cavaliere, in an interview with journalist Don Paulson, spoke about his first encounter with the younger Brigati:<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=About The Rascals|url=https://www.therascalsarchives.com/history/essay.htm|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Therascalsarchives.com}}</ref>

{{Quote|text="I saw a little kid walk into the place. He didn't look old enough to go out of his house alone. He used to walk into the [Choo Choo] club and no matter who was singing, get on the stage, and bury them with his voice. We made an impression on each other. He used to come around every once in a while, and I loved to play behind his singing. I told him that someday we were going to get together. "}}

[[Canadians|Canadian]] guitarist [[Gene Cornish]] left his group, The Unbeatables, for which he acted as their frontman, to join the Starliters, in early 1965.<ref name=":0" /> After meeting Cornish, Cavaliere's interest in forming a band of his own led him to convince both Cornish and (Eddie) Brigati to depart from Dee's backing band to start a new one with an old acquaintance of his, [[jazz]] drummer [[Dino Danelli]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2017-05-12|title=Felix Cavaliere Interview - Writing The Rascals Classic Hits|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/felix-cavaliere-rascals-2017.htm|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Songwriter Universe {{!}} Songwriting News, Articles & Song Contest|language=en-US}}</ref> The group came up with the name "Rascals" at the Choo Choo Club.

Initially, the Rascals began rehearsing at Cavaliere's house and then, the Choo Choo Club, mostly because it was close to Brigati's home,<ref name=":0" /> and later other [[New Jersey]] clubs, like the Barge,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.27east.com/arts/felix-cavaliere-and-his-rascals-perform-in-westhampton-beach-august-28-1338711/|title=Felix Cavaliere And His Rascals Perform In Westhampton Beach August 28|website=27east.com|date=2016-08-23|access-date=2021-06-16}}</ref> a floating [[Long Island]] club, where they settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://backstageauctions.blogspot.com/2010/08/rascals-summer-of-65.html|title=ALL ACCESS: The Rascals: Summer of '65|website=Backstageauctions.blogspot.com|access-date=2021-06-16}}</ref> There they developed their mixed [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]-[[soul music|soul]] sound based on Cavaliere's organ and soulful vocals, mostly filled with traditional R&B covers.

The quartet did not have any official [[Bassist|bass player]], because of Brigati's inability to play musical instruments, other than percussion (even when the band bought him a [[Fender Mustang Bass]] in 1967) and the Rascals' wish of staying in the [[formula]] of [[Band (rock and pop)|four members]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cohen|first=Elliot Stephen|title=The Rascals' Gene Cornish {{!}} Vintage Guitar® magazine|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/32697/the-rascals-gene-cornish/|access-date=2021-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> Cavaliere's [[Pedal keyboard|organ pedals]] (and later, session bassists, like [[Chuck Rainey]], in studio recordings) filled the bass parts.

Manager Billy (Amato) Smith discovered them at the club and directed the Rascals to [[Sid Bernstein (impresario)|Sid Bernstein]], an impresario known at the time for helping to promote the [[British Invasion]], bringing famous [[United Kingdom|UK]] bands like [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] to [[United States|America]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=The Rascals {{!}} Way Back Attack|url=http://www.waybackattack.com/rascals.html|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Waybackattack.com}}</ref>

To promote the band, in August 1965, Bernstein famously posted the phrase "The Rascals are coming!" at the [[Shea Stadium]]'s scoreboard, at the same time that [[The Beatles|the Fab Four]] were doing the opening of their [[The Beatles' 1965 USA Tour|1965 North American tour]]. Beatles manager [[Brian Epstein]] ordered the post to be removed before his band arrived on the stage.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|date=2009-03-13|title=Sid Bernstein Facts|url=http://elviswade.com/quotable/faqs.asp|access-date=2021-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313042749/http://elviswade.com/quotable/faqs.asp|archive-date=2009-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Mills|first=Fred|title=GETTING INTO THE GROOVIN' AGAIN: The Rascals|url=https://blurtonline.com/feature/getting-into-the-groovin-again-the-rascals/|access-date=2021-04-09|website=Blurt Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref>

{{Quote|text="A lot of people who hadn't seen pictures of them thought they [the Rascals] were a black group. I sensed something big about them."|author=Sid Bernstein}}

This event helped the group to get a $15,000 contract with [[Atlantic Records]], a label which only had black artists, becoming the first white-only act to be signed at Atlantic.<ref name=":0" /> Sid Bernstein would manage them for the next five years.<ref name=":3" /> The contract also stipulated that the band could self-produce their records. But problems arose when they discovered that another group, [[Borrah Minnevitch]]'s and [[Johnny Puleo]]'s 'Harmonica Rascals', objected to their release of records under the name 'The Rascals'. To avoid conflict, Bernstein decided to rename the group 'The Young Rascals', possibly because all the members were under 25.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-07-27|title=August 17, 1968: Rascals 'People Got to Be Free' Hits #1|url=https://bestclassicbands.com/rascals-biggest-hits-8-17-155/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Best Classic Bands|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|date=2012-12-06|title=Soul Serenade: The Young Rascals, "Groovin'"|url=https://popdose.com/soul-serenade-the-young-rascals-groovin/|access-date=2021-04-09|website=Popdose.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Commercial success and songwriting development ===
The line-up of Brigati on vocals, Cavaliere on organ, Cornish on guitar and Danelli on drums would stay true in the Young Rascals' debut single, the [[Pam Sawyer]]/[[Lori Burton]] "[[I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore]]", which was performed in their first television performance on the program ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'' on February 24, 1966. But the track reached only #23 in [[Canada]] and did not reach the Top 40 of the [[Billboard charts|US charts]]. After "Eat Out My Heart Anymore"'s modest success, Cavaliere would assume the lead vocals on their subsequent records, starting with its follow-up "[[Good Lovin']]", originally recorded by [[Limmie Snell|Lemme B. Good]] and [[The Olympics (band)|The Olympics]] in 1965, with the same arrangement and different lyrics from the original. They performed "Good Lovin'" on [[the Ed Sullivan Show]].<ref>{{Citation|title=The Young Rascals "Good Lovin'" on The Ed Sullivan Show|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUNJbVFW5Pw|language=en|access-date=2021-03-30}}</ref> The Young Rascals version became their first Canada/USA #1.<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name=":2" /> Shortly after, their [[The Young Rascals (album)|eponymous debut album]] was released, mostly composed of [[garage rock]] renditions of [[folk rock]] ("[[Just a Little (The Beau Brummels song)|Just a Little]]" and "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]"), and [[Soul music|soul]] tunes ("[[Mustang Sally (song)|Mustang Sally]]" and "[[In the Midnight Hour]]"), with only one original, the Cavaliere/Cornish penned "Do You Feel It". ''The Young Rascals'' reached #15 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard Top LPs chart]] and #10 in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]''. The album was certified [[Music recording certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA.]]<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-11-13|title=Cratedigger: The Young Rascals, "The Young Rascals"|url=https://popdose.com/cratedigger-the-young-rascals-the-young-rascals/|access-date=2021-04-09|website=Popdose|language=en-US}}</ref>

From there, the songwriting partnership between Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati began to flourish. Cavaliere wrote the music and themes, and Brigati, the verses with the former's help.<ref name=":1" /> Their second album, [[Collections (The Young Rascals album)|''Collections'']], had four Cavaliere/Brigati songs and two Cornish originals in its eleven tracks. Follow-ups to their number one record, "[[You Better Run]]" – later covered by [[Pat Benatar]] in 1980 – and "Come On Up", did not do as well as their predecessor (peaking at #20 and #43, respectively).

In the meantime, Cavaliere started to date [[Secondary school|high school]] student  Adrienne Bechurri. His relationship inspired him to write several songs in 1967, including Top 20 "[[I've Been Lonely Too Long]]" and Top 10's "[[How Can I Be Sure]]", and "[[Groovin']]", their second #1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordtrope.com/blog/2013/07/07/a-groovin-reunion-with-a-rascal-and-a-hero-boston-globe-july-10-2003/|title=A Groovin' Reunion With A Rascal - And A Hero|author=Joyce Pellino Crane|work=The Boston Globe|date=2003-06-10|access-date=2015-05-15}}</ref> "Groovin'", having its laid-back sound and a [[Afro-Cuban music|Afro-Cuban]] groove, found some resistance with Atlantic's head [[Jerry Wexler]];<ref name=":4" /> "I've Been Lonely Too Long" and the [[jazz]]-influenced "A Girl Like You" talked about the advantages of a relationship against loneliness, but the  introspective "How Can I Be Sure", with Brigati's lead vocals, expressed the doubts about love, like Cavaliere's conflicting feelings about Bechurri.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-05-12|title=The backstory of making the 'Groovin'' album by The Young Rascals|url=https://vinyldialogues.com/VinylDialoguesBlog/the-backstory-of-making-the-groovin-album-by-the-young-rascals/|access-date=2021-03-30|website=The Vinyl Dialogues Blog|language=en-US}}</ref> All these songs were included at the ''[[Groovin' (The Young Rascals album)|Groovin'<nowiki/>]]''album, which had the majority of the tracks penned by Cavaliere/Brigati. Bruce Eder, writing for [[AllMusic]], rates ''[[Groovin' (The Young Rascals album)|Groovin'<nowiki/>]]'' as the Rascals' best, noting the record's soulful core and innovative use of jazz and Latin instrumental arrangements.<ref>{{Citation|title=Groovin' - The Young Rascals {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/groovin-mw0000202187|language=en|access-date=2021-04-09}}</ref>

''Groovin''' marked the first time that the Young Rascals used outside musicians, bringing some important collaborators like [[Chuck Rainey]], [[Hubert Laws]] and David Brigati to augment their sound. Particularly, D.Brigati would also help his brother's band in arranging [[Vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]] and [[Backing vocalist|singing background]] on many Rascals records.

The band, especially Cavaliere, wanted to depart from their "singles act" label to be more like an "albums act", something that would become common to more artists at the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Rascals {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-rascals-mn0000493122/biography|access-date=2021-03-30|website=AllMusic|language=en}}</ref> The album [[Once Upon a Dream (The Rascals album)|''Once Upon a Dream'']], released at 1968, is an example of this change, because it was the first Rascals album designed from conception as an album, rather than as a vehicle to package their singles (eight of ''Groovin<nowiki>''</nowiki>''s eleven songs had been released as single A or B sides, most in advance of the album).  "''Once Upon a Dream''" also incorporated [[Music of India|Indian music]] in its sound, adding Eastern instruments like [[sitar]], [[Tambouras|tamboura]] and [[tabla]]. David Brigati also makes a special appearance on the album, singing lead on the title track. The psychedelic "[[It's Wonderful]]" was released before the album, but its different style, in comparison with their earlier singles, hindered it's sales and the single only reached the #20. The album's song "My Hawaii" became a top of the charts hit in Hawaii.

The band would bill themselves as the Young Rascals for the last time with the single release of "It's Wonderful"; from that point on they were known as simply 'The Rascals'.<ref name="Larkin" />

Their first official single release as "the Rascals" was the optimistic 1968's "[[A Beautiful Morning]]", which reached #3. Internationally, the band was exceptionally popular in Canada where "A Girl Like You", "How Can I Be Sure?" and "A Beautiful Morning" all reached #1. But they struggled in the UK, where they only twice reached the top 75, with "Groovin'" (#8) and "A Girl Like You" (#35).

''[[Time Peace: The Rascals' Greatest Hits]]'', released in mid-1968, topped the [[Billboard 200|U.S. album chart]] and became the group's best-selling album.

The same year, "[[People Got to Be Free]]", a horn-punctuated plea for racial tolerance (the band was known for refusing to tour on [[racial segregation|segregated]] bills)<ref>Egan, Sean, ed. (2007). ''Defining Moments in Music'', Cassell, {{ISBN|1-84403-606-5}}, p. 360.</ref> just months after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] and of [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]], became their third and final U.S. #1 single,<ref name="Larkin" /> and their sixth and final Canadian #1. It was also their final U.S. Top Ten hit, although they remained a Canadian top 10 act for the next few years.

In 1969, the Rascals released the [[double album]] ''[[Freedom Suite (The Rascals album)|Freedom Suite]]''. An album with one [[LP record|LP]] dedicated to "conventional" songs and another to [[instrumental]]s, it should have been the band's definitive change to produce more ambitious albums, according to [[Richie Unterberger|Richie Urterberger]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Liner Notes for CD Reissue of the Rascals' "Once Upon a Dream"|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/rascals5.html|access-date=2021-03-30|website=Richieunterberger.com}}</ref> But ''Freedom Suite'' would be their last Top 40 album, peaking at #17.

Brigati's songwriting contributions diminished on this album, in favor of Cavaliere's solo compositions, as well his vocals, singing lead only on two songs on ''Freedom Suite''. His participation would decline even more in later albums.

=== Commercial waning and demise ===
The follow-ups "A Ray of Hope", "Heaven", "See", and "Carry Me Back" were all modest U.S. hits for the band during late 1968 and 1969; all entered the top 40, but none higher than #24. In Canada, however, the Rascals were still major stars; all these songs went top ten, completing a run of 11 straight Canadian top ten hits for The Rascals from 1967 to 1969. December 1969's "Hold On" broke the run of top 40 US singles for the Rascals, stalling at #51, as well as the run of Canadian top tens, peaking at #22.

Brigati left the group in 1970, followed by Cornish in 1971.<ref name="Larkin"/> Their last Rascals album was ''[[Search and Nearness]]'' (#198 U.S.), which featured Brigati's lead vocals on the Cornish-penned "You Don't Know", a cover of [[The Box Tops]]' hit "[[The Letter (Box Tops song)|The Letter]]", and drummer Danelli's composition "Fortunes". The only single release from the album to chart was the spiritually themed "Glory, Glory" (#58 U.S., #40 Canada), with backing vocals by [[The Sweet Inspirations]]. ''Search and Nearness'' would be the Rascals' last album for Atlantic Records, with Cavaliere and Danelli taking the band to [[Columbia Records]] in mid-1971.

Cavaliere shifted towards more jazz- and gospel-influenced writing for the Rascals' next two albums, the double disc ''[[Peaceful World (album)|Peaceful World]]'' (U.S. #122) and ''[[The Island of Real|The Island Of Real]]'' (U.S. #180), using [[Robert Popwell]] and [[Buzzy Feiten]] on bass and guitar respectively, and new singers Annie Sutton and Molly Holt.<ref name="Larkin"/> These albums did not sell as well as their earlier work, with none of their associated singles reaching higher than #95 on the U.S. chart. Towards the end of 1970 [[Danny Weis]] joined as a replacement for Feiten on guitar. Feiten then again replaced Weis before the group disbanded.

==Post break-up==
Cavaliere released several solo albums during the 1970s.<ref name="Larkin"/> Brigati, with his brother David, released ''Lost in the Wilderness'' in 1976. Cornish and Danelli worked together in Bulldog, who released two albums — one for [[MCA Records]] in 1973 with the minor hit single "No", the second for [[Buddah Records|Buddah]] in '74 — and [[Fotomaker]], who issued three albums on Atlantic in 1978–79.<ref name="Larkin"/> In 1982, Danelli joined [[Steve Van Zandt]] in [[Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul]] for the group's first two albums.

After appearing at [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] Celebration on May 14, 1988, the Rascals reunited (with Cavaliere, Cornish, and Danelli) for a brief reunion tour in 1988.<ref name="Larkin"/> The reunion group featured an expanded lineup that included Mel Owens (in Brigati's place) on vocals and percussion, [[Steve Mackey]] on bass, Ed Mattey on guitar, Dena Iverson & Cindy McCabe on backup vocals, and a horn section from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to beef up the sound. The reunion did not last beyond the end of the year.

After that, Cavaliere returned to his solo career and in the 1990s there were two factions touring: The New Rascals (featuring Cornish and Danelli) and Cavaliere, who sometimes called his grouping Felix Cavaliere's Rascals. The New Rascals lasted only a short time but toured again in 2006 with two new members, Bill Pascali (formerly of [[Vanilla Fudge]]) on vocals and keyboards and [[Charlie Souza]] on bass and vocals. The New Rascals released a concert DVD, shot at club Centro in New Jersey on Route 35.

In early 2009, Eddie Brigati put together a project of young musicians who played all the classics. Eddie performed with the group along with his brother David. Called The Boys From The Music House, the band consisted of Anthony Duke Claus, a cousin of Eddie's, on lead vocals and tambourine, Joseph Pomarico on lead guitar, harmonica and background vocals, Adam Sullivan on piano, organ, and background vocals, and Matt Gazzano on drums.

On April 24, 2010, all four members of The Rascals reunited for the Kristen Ann Carr benefit, which was held at New York's [[Tribeca Grill]]; [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Van Zandt]] joined the band for a closing "Good Lovin'".

The group's original lineup reunited in 2012 for their first public performances in over 40 years with ''[[The Rascals: Once Upon a Dream]]'', a combination concert/theatrical event that was produced and directed by [[Steven Van Zandt]] and [[Maureen Van Zandt]] with lighting/projection by [[Marc Brickman]].
