== History ==

=== Debut album and departure of vocalist Ronnie Radke (2004–2007) ===
{{Main|Dying Is Your Latest Fashion}}

Before forming Escape the Fate, the then vocalist [[Ronnie Radke]], lead guitarist [[Monte Money|Bryan Monte Money]], bassist [[Max Green (musician)|Max Green]], drummer Robert Ortiz, keyboardist [[Carson Allen]], and rhythm guitarist [[Omar Espinosa]] were in multiple bands all together. Later, in 2004, Monte Money created Escape the Fate with Max Green and Ronnie Radke, then inviting Robert Ortiz and Omar Espinosa, and later recruited [[Carson Allen]].

In September 2005, Escape the Fate won a local radio contest judged by [[My Chemical Romance]]. The gig awarded them the opportunity to open a show on the band's headlining tour with [[Alkaline Trio]] and [[Reggie and the Full Effect]]. As a result of their show on the tour and their self-released [[Escape the Fate discography#Extended plays|EP demo]], this subsequently led to Escape the Fate's record deal with Epitaph. Following their record deal, the band released their debut EP titled ''[[There's No Sympathy for the Dead]].'' in May 2006 which included two songs that were later on their full-length album, ''[[Dying Is Your Latest Fashion]]''. The EP was produced by Michael Baskette and helped earn the band attention from record labels and fans alike. After the EP's release, keyboardist [[Carson Allen]] left the band to join [[On the Last Day]], which he had also left to start another band called Me vs. Myself).<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1291902 |title=Announcing: Me Vs.

Later in September 2006, the band released their first full-length album, ''[[Dying Is Your Latest Fashion]]'', which charted moderately on ''Billboard'''s Heatseeker and Top Independent charts. On November 20, 2007, they released the ''[[Situations EP]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/situations-ep/id268054100|title=Situations - EP by Escape the Fate on iTunes|publisher=[[iTunes]] |access-date=May 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/archive/index.php?t-1059362.html|title=List of All Escape The Fate Songs Ever Made"section Situations (EP)"|publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar]]|access-date=May 24, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105174150/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/archive/index.php?t-1059362.html|archive-date=November 5, 2013}}</ref> it was also the last extended play that Ronnie Radke and Omar Espinosa made with the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abetterradio.com/ondemand/?l=album&id=268054100&t=Situations___EP|title=Situations - EP|publisher=abetterradio.com|access-date=May 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105181144/http://abetterradio.com/ondemand/?l=album&id=268054100&t=Situations___EP|archive-date=November 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{Better source |date=May 2013 |reason=prose would be preferred.}}

On November 6, 2007, rhythm guitarist [[Omar Espinosa]] left the band due to personal issues and started a band called Perfect Like Me (after leaving The Black and White City).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_2957 |title=Omar Espinoza leaves Escape The Fate - Alternative Press |publisher=Altpress.com |date=November 6, 2007 |access-date=May 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625205255/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_2957 |archive-date=June 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later, [[Ronnie Radke]] was involved in an altercation in Las Vegas that resulted in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Cook.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.lasvegascitylife.com/articles/2006/09/28/local_news/news03.txt |title=Las Vegas CityLife |publisher=Archives.lasvegascitylife.com |date=September 28, 2006 |access-date=September 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130216082616/http://archives.lasvegascitylife.com/articles/2006/09/28/local_news/news03.txt |archive-date=February 16, 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/archive/2008/feb/23/tragedy-murder-suicide-music-and-drugs/ |title=[Tragedy&#93; Murder, suicide, music and drugs |publisher=Lasvegasweekly.com |date=February 23, 2008 |access-date=April 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/blog/2008/01/escape_the_fate_singer_escapes.html |title=Escape The fate singer escapes jail |publisher=Kerrang.com |access-date=April 9, 2013}}</ref> While Radke did not shoot Cook, he was indicted on battery charges, while the man who shot Cook claimed self-defense.

Radke failed to report to his probation officer and was arrested in June 2008, where he was sentenced to two years in prison. Radke was officially fired from Escape the Fate in mid-2008.

=== Arrival of Craig Mabbitt (2008–2010)===
After Radke was fired from Escape the Fate, the band turned to [[Craig Mabbitt]], who was searching for a new band after leaving [[Blessthefall]]. Mabbitt had played with Escape the Fate on the Black on Black Tour, while with Blessthefall. After several trial shows he became the official new singer and they entered the studio to record their second full-length album, ''[[This War Is Ours]]''. The album was released on October 21, 2008. It was the first Escape the Fate release to feature [[Craig Mabbitt]] as the lead vocalist.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} On October 1, 2008, the band released "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)" for download.<ref name="Myspace">{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/escapethefate|title=Escape the Fate release another song for download|publisher=Myspace|date=October 1, 2008|access-date=April 26, 2011}}{{verify source|date=April 2011}}</ref> Copies of the album were made available to buy on their tour with [[Chiodos]] and [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], even before the album's official release date.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} The official video for "Something" was released to MTV on January 12, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} The video for the album's third single "10 Miles Wide" was released June 9, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)" is the fourth single off the album.

Before the tour for ''This War Is Ours'', the band had never completed a full tour. The band later went on the ''This War Is Ours'' tour with [[Attack Attack!]], [[Burn Halo]], [[William Control]], and [[Black Tide]]. The band then joined [[Hollywood Undead]] and [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]] on their 2008 tour and toured Europe during December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epitaphblog.com/?p=2613 |title=Epitaph Blog &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Escape The Fate on tour with Hollywood Undead and Atreyu! |publisher=Epitaphblog.com |date=August 26, 2009 |access-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref>

In 2010, Epitaph Records announced the re-release of the ''This War Is Ours'' album in deluxe CD/DVD edition with a bonus disc with many different features not seen before. The CD included two new never before heard songs, later identified to be "Bad Blood" and "Behind the Mask", an acoustic version of "Harder Than You Know", and an unreleased remix of "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)" called "This War Is Mine", remixed by the [[Shawn Crahan]]. It also came with a DVD that featured the new music video to "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine II)", as well as "Something", "The Flood", and "10 Miles Wide", as well as a world tour documentary and a behind the music feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://puregrainaudio.com/news/escape-the-fate-resume-the-battle-with-this-war-is-ours-deluxe-edition-on-april-27th |title=ESCAPE THE FATE to Release 'This War Is Ours' Deluxe Edition on April 27th " News " |publisher=Puregrainaudio.com |date=March 16, 2010 |access-date=June 24, 2010}}</ref> It released April 27, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.super-craig.net |title=Craig Mabbitt Fansite |publisher=Super-Craig.net |access-date=June 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803181906/http://www.super-craig.net/ |archive-date=August 3, 2010  }}</ref>

=== Departure of Max Green (2010–2012) ===

Escape the Fate began writing a third record in early 2010, which eventually became ''[[Escape the Fate (album)|Escape the Fate]]'', which was released in November 2010. For the album, the band left Epitaph and signed to major label [[Interscope]] and had the record produced by Don Gilmore. Max Green commented on the album, saying, "This record is the cure for the modern day music epidemic, We are wiping the slate clean and re-writing rock music as you know it." The album spawned four singles: "Massacre",<ref name="musicremedy.com">{{cite web |url=http://musicremedy.com/e/escape-the-fate/album/massacre-9356.html |title=Escape The Fate release Massacre album |publisher=Musicremedy.com |access-date=November 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907052015/http://musicremedy.com/e/escape-the-fate/album/massacre-9356.html |archive-date=September 7, 2011  }}</ref> "Issues",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloginity.com/blog/2010/09/09/escape-fate-issues-song-upcoming-selftitled-album|title=Escape The Fate – Issues New Song From Upcoming Self-Titled Album|author=Brian Willett}}</ref> "City of Sin", and "Gorgeous Nightmare".

The band had been working on the album since the release of ''[[This War Is Ours]]'' in 2008. Being able to completely form the writing and recording process with the current lineup for the first time, the band felt that the album would be a great representation for the band. This is due to the fact that when Mabbitt first joined the band, he felt very rushed to write a record and fit into an already established band. In addition, the debut on a major label also led to the band choosing to self-title the album. Lyrically, the album is heavier and darker than previous efforts, according to Mabbitt. In an interview, he explained the choice of direction for the album in that they were, "figuring out what we enjoy playing live, what we enjoy listening to on our record." Mabbitt feels that the past two albums have been working up to ''Escape the Fate'' and that this direction will continue with future releases. For writing, Craig Mabbitt expressed that he believes it is more important to focus on what the band enjoys doing rather than copying other bands for success. "[We] definitely could have been like, 'Oh, let's throw another minute-long solo, let's do a chugga-chug here, let's scream over this, and let's sound like every other band and put the same song on the record ten times so that we have a one song, ten different track album.'... we just like to be very diverse..." On working with producer Don Gilmore, the band said that he helped them "find themselves" and continue to push different parts of the song until they formed a record they were satisfied with. Mabbitt also praised Gilmore for his ability to perfect the album without affecting their music. Commenting on the album, Mabbitt feels that "This record has the heaviest song the band has ever written, it has the softest ballad the band has ever written, it has the craziest solo Monte has ever written. The whole record just has everything in it."<ref name="411 Music Interview: Craig Mabbitt of Escape The Fate"/>

For inspiration, Craig Mabbitt said that he drew experiences from many things, stating, "I wanted to write about every emotion that you can get from life, everything that kind of happens, every kind of story I've heard that really upset me." The track "Lost in Darkness" tells the story about one of Mabbitt's friends who was dragged out of her home and raped at gunpoint. Mabbitt stated that, "[She] was screaming for help and nobody helped her at all. Everybody just turned the other cheek. That was something that really struck me, and I see that happening a lot, just people not wanting to lend a helping hand to people when somebody is hurting... That's definitely where I went with that song." The second track, "Massacre", is about Mabbitt's past addictions and the things he did to overcome them. The ballad track "World Around Me" takes a broader view and was written about life in general. "[World Around Me is] about relationships with my ex and my child, everything accumulated into one song." The closing track, "The Aftermath (G3)", is the third song under the title of "The Guillotine" for Escape the Fate. The original Guillotine was sung by Ronnie Radke for ''[[Dying Is Your Latest Fashion]]'' and was about the video game series ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]''. When Mabbitt joined, a song entitled "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine Part II)" was included on ''[[This War Is Ours]]'' and was also about ''Halo''. However, the second ''Guillotine'' was written as well to relate to real-life soldiers in battle. For the self-titled album, Mabbitt wrote a third ''Guillotine'' track but did not want to base it off of ''Halo'' again. Instead, he wrote a more personal track about his father who was in the military when Mabbitt was a child. "[The] chorus, 'Now I'm coming home,' is an ode to my Dad and an ode to all the soldiers out there who are fighting a war for us and waiting to come home to their families." As a whole, Mabbitt feels that, "every track has a completely different underlying story to it."<ref name="411 Music Interview: Craig Mabbitt of Escape The Fate">{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/music/columns/165883/411-Music-Interview:-Craig-Mabbitt-of-Escape-The-Fate.htm|publisher=411 Mania|author=Dan Marsicano|title=411 Music Interview: Craig Mabbitt of Escape The Fate|date=December 13, 2010|access-date=December 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008043157/http://www.411mania.com/music/columns/165883/411-Music-Interview:-Craig-Mabbitt-of-Escape-The-Fate.htm|archive-date=October 8, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Vocally, Mabbitt experimented for the self-titled album. On both tracks "Lost in Darkness" and "Liars and Monsters", a track that appears on the Deluxe Edition of the album, he sang at the lowest pitch he has done yet for a track. On the track "Zombie Dance", Mabbitt described the recording process and that he recorded five layers of vocal harmony for the final mix in addition to little sound effects. He explained it was difficult to achieve the high harmonies and right pitches right for all of the tracks. Another difficulty he experienced while recording was boosting the endings of songs for an epic feels. Despite this, Craig stated he enjoyed experimenting and that he "can't wait to keep on going back into the studio and experimenting on a ton of different things."<ref name="411 Music Interview: Craig Mabbitt of Escape The Fate"/>

Rather than have eleven tracks for the regular version of the album, the band wanted to include both "Liars and Monsters" and "The Final Blow" from the deluxe edition on the album. The decision to put them as bonus tracks were encouraged to keep the length and tracks on the album to a manageable size. Mabbitt jokingly stated that the band recorded so much material, almost two albums worth, that he "just want[ed] to record everything and just release a 20 track album." There were at least six or seven tracks recorded that did not make the cut for the album. Two ballads and about five heavier songs were cut because the band had to decide "Which one is the strongest one? Which one do we have most vocals to? What's going to fit in the diversity of the record?" This was to give the fans variety rather than having a straight, one-genre record. On this, Mabbitt commented, "We could have thrown those songs on there and not put "World Around Me" or "Gorgeous Nightmare" or "Zombie Dance" or "Issues" or anything like that. It would have been more like a straightforward record. That's not what we like to do. We like to have a lot of that diversity in our sound." Another track, entitled "Dream" was fully recorded and mixed for the final cut of the album. Before finalizing, however, Monte Money decided to rerecord the guitar part with a lower tune to change the sound of the song. After rerecording, the band agreed they liked the original version better but the deadline for the record did not allow them to finish the song in time so they are going to keep it for a later release.<ref name="411 Music Interview: Craig Mabbitt of Escape The Fate"/>

In an interview during Warped Tour 2009, bassist Max Green stated that the album will feature a song co-written by [[Mick Mars]] of [[Mötley Crüe]], who approached Escape the Fate to collaborate on some songs,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thrashitoutonline.blogspot.com/2009/08/my-interview-with-max-green-of-escape.html |title=Interview with Max Green |publisher=Thrashitoutonline.blogspot.com |access-date=April 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106214515/http://thrashitoutonline.blogspot.com/2009/08/my-interview-with-max-green-of-escape.html |archive-date=November 6, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but later was revealed that they decided against putting the song on the album and saving for a future release. Max Green also confirmed through Formspring that there will be a song co-written by guitarist [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]] of [[Rob Zombie]], later seen to be "Liars And Monsters".

On April 23, vocalist Craig Mabbitt stated via Twitter, "off to vegas today to finish out last minute badass demos with monte, then off to bamboozle, then studio time", giving the notion that the band will begin recording their studio album directly after [[The Bamboozle]], and release it mid/late Summer 2010. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Soon after, Mabbitt stated through his Twitter account that the band had a few more songs to record, and that the new album will be coming sooner than expected. He has also hinted towards there being a "Guillotine III: The Aftermath" track on the album,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/caige/status/18148753690 |title=Twitter / craig mabbitt: Vocals for g3 the aftermat |publisher=Twitter.com |date=July 9, 2010 |access-date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> which was later confirmed as true.

During early recording, Max Green was questioned on Formspring about the band possibly changing record labels. Max responded by saying that he will reveal all of that at a later time. This would make the record the first to be released without Epitaph Records.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} On July 26, Escape The Fate confirmed that the new record will be released through major record label, DGC/Interscope Records. Craig Mabbitt stated that the band had no issues with Epitaph but the appeal to bring their music to a wider audience led to their signing with Interscope. The band was initially worried about switching but were pleased that neither the new label or the new producer wanted to change or control the band. "Interscope was hopping on board with us, instead of us hopping on board with Interscope."<ref name="411 Music Interview: Craig Mabbitt of Escape The Fate"/> In the same press release, they have listed Don Gilmore as the album's producer, who has worked with bands such as [[Linkin Park]], [[Bullet for My Valentine]], and [[Hollywood Undead]].

In May, Escape the Fate joined the second half of the Raid The Nation tour headlined by [[Papa Roach]] with the absence of Max Green on bass. With no statement by the band on his replacement, it was later recognized by many as TJ Bell, who was at the time the current rhythm guitarist for the band [[Motionless in White]]. In later interviews with the band after Green's departure, it was clear his absence from the tour was due to his addiction with drugs. Bell would go on to fill in for Green on many subsequent tours before replacing Green permanently in 2012.

On January 11, 2011, the band performed live in "Tues Show" (Fuel.tv) the songs "Issues" and "Gorgeous Nightmare" with the special collaboration of Kevin Thrasher (of [[Lovehatehero]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/escapethefate/posts/178670228830814 |title=Escape The Fate's... |publisher=Facebook |access-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref> On August 19, 2011, the band announced via Facebook that Monte Money would be taking a break from touring but will still be in the band. Thrasher, who had worked with the band in the past, substituted for Monte. It was also announced that Max Green returned to the band after taking a break through the first half of 2011 to recover from his addiction to drugs through rehab. "I'm feeling great and am glad to be back with my band. Escape The Fate is my life. This is where I belong," he said.<ref name="Escape the Fate announces touring line up!">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/escape-the-fate/escape-the-fate-announces-new-touring-lineup/10150346743230242 |title=Escape The Fate Announces New Touring Lineup |publisher=Facebook |access-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref> After they played a couple of shows on the 2011 Uproar Festival, Green, again, left the band and Zakk Sandler, from Black Tide (who was also playing Uproar), filled in for him. TJ Bell, currently{{when|date=June 2015}} bass guitarist of [[Get Scared]] once again filled in for Green in early 2012 on the band's UK tour with [[Funeral for a Friend]], who had previously filled in for Green on their tour with [[Papa Roach]].

In mid-December 2011, the band re-entered the studio to work on the production of their fourth album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsnjHfs94QA | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/qsnjHfs94QA| archive-date=2021-11-18 | url-status=live|title=Escape The Fate Interview 2011 Craig Mabbitt |publisher=YouTube |access-date=April 9, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Initially, the album was planned to be produced in full by [[John Feldmann]] and was scheduled for release some time in 2012.

Mabbitt commented that since they are recording their fourth album with John Feldmann again, who they worked with on their second album, ''[[This War Is Ours]]'', the style of the upcoming album would be similar to ''This War Is Ours'' but would also have elements of their ''[[Escape the Fate (album)|Escape the Fate]]'' album added. He also announced a tour, later revealed to be the ''This World is Ours Tour'' in South America with the metalcore band [[Attack Attack!]] as well as supporting acts [[The Word Alive]] and [[Mest]]. The tour would later be continued in the United States and Canada.<ref name="Escape the Fate announce tour with Attack Attack!, The Word Alive, and Mest">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisworldisourstour.com/|publisher=Escape the Fate|title=This World Is Ours tour|date=February 6, 2012|access-date=February 6, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209070758/http://www.thisworldisourstour.com/|archive-date=February 9, 2012}}</ref> He revealed on February 7 that Escape the Fate was working with [[Fall Out Boy]]'s lead singer [[Patrick Stump]].<ref name="Writing song with P-Stump">{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodwaste.com/music/music-hp-stream/craig-mabbitt-releases-new-solo-song/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624234108/http://hollywoodwaste.com/music/music-hp-stream/craig-mabbitt-releases-new-solo-song/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 24, 2017|publisher=Hollywood Waste|title=Escape the Fate working on song with Patrick Stump|date=February 7, 2012|access-date=February 7, 2012}}</ref> It was later revealed that they had made the song "Painting" together, which would be on the upcoming Escape the Fate album and actually titled "Picture Perfect".

On March 4, 2012, Green stated on his Twitter account that he was no longer playing in Escape the Fate. He did not give any specific reasons for his departure, but summarized that it was mainly due to personal and musical differences. He later announced that although he was no longer part of the band, he was still continuing to make music.<ref name="Max Green's departure from Escape the Fate">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/#!/max_the_ripper/status/176509185981292544|publisher=Hollywood Waste|title=Max Green departed from ETF|date=March 4, 2012|access-date=March 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Max Green continues music career">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/#!/max_the_ripper/status/176512238176321536|publisher=Hollywood Waste|title=Max Green continues music career|date=March 4, 2012|access-date=March 5, 2012}}</ref> Mabbitt hinted in an interview with ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' that Max Green's departure was due to drugs. Despite the sudden departure, Green and Escape the Fate remained on good terms, to the point where Green even attended a recent{{when|date=June 2015}} show by the band in Los Angeles. Green joined the band The Natural Born Killers and released their first song "Last Day".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://soundcloud.com/the-natural-born-killers/last-day |title=LAST DAY by The Natural Born Killers on SoundCloud - Hear the world's sounds |publisher=Soundcloud.com |access-date=April 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105180745/https://soundcloud.com/the-natural-born-killers/last-day |archive-date=November 5, 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/#!/max_the_ripper/status/191530750955368449|title=Twitter|work=twitter.com|access-date=August 16, 2015}}</ref>

The band announced that their South American tour with [[Attack Attack!]] would be delayed until June because of Attack Attack! member Andrew Wetzel being diagnosed with [[pneumonia]].

In the aforementioned interview with ''Alternative Press'', the band officially announced that touring members TJ Bell and Michael Money would join the band as official members. Mabbitt commented that Money would have already been an official member, but certain (and now former) members of the band refused to let him in. "When the band became a four-piece we still wanted rhythm so he was never officially given a spot in the band [because] some other members that aren't in the band anymore didn't want him to be," he said. "It got to the point where we were on a tour and he was playing behind the stage, then we got to Warped Tour and he was restricted to this little box and I'm sure it had some effect on Monte as well, [his brother] being in a band but not being an official part of it, so to see them happy and see that camaraderie, it's nice. We'll be stronger moving forward." Along with this, the band also revealed a possible September 2012 release date for their fourth studio album, and the band would be playing a new track from the album on the ''This World Is Ours'' tour, later to be revealed as "Live Fast, Die Beautiful".<ref name="Escape the Fate interview with Alternate Press">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/exclusive_interview_escape_the_fate_craig_mabbitt_robert_ortiz/|magazine=Alternative Press|title=Exclusive Interview: Escape The Fate on their new lineup and their make or break fourth album|date=April 4, 2012|access-date=April 4, 2012}}</ref>
