'''Modern Baseball''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Ian|title=Modern Baseball: You're Gonna Miss It All|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18984-modern-baseball-youre-gonna-miss-it-all/|publisher=Pitchfork|access-date=3 May 2014}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years and success (2011–2016)===
Bren Lukens and Jake Ewald met in High School, when Lukens was interested in Ewald's twin sister. They ran in different friend groups, but found common ground through music. Their name was inspired by a book that Lukens and Ewald found in Ewalds basement, titled “Modern Baseball Techniques".

Originally from [[Brunswick, Maryland]], they relocated to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] to attend college; Lukens at [[Chestnut Hill College]], and Ewald at [[Drexel University]]. In Philadephia, they met fellow music lover Ian Farmer, who helped them record their first album, ''Sports'', in Drexel's recording studios. ''Sports'' was released in 2012, and soon after the group left college temporarily to pursue music as their profession. <ref name="thefader-holy-ghost">
