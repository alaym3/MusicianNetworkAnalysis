'''The Format''' is an American [[indie rock]] band formed by [[Nate Ruess]] and [[Sam Means (musician)|Sam Means]]. Their style can be considered a mixture of indie, alternative, punk and folk music, with elements of 1960s and 1970s pop music.<ref>{{cite news| last =Iwasaki| first =Scott| title =The Format refuses to stick to a musical format| page =W11| newspaper =[[Deseret News]]| date =2003-11-07}}</ref> Though Means and Ruess are the foremost members of the band, they have played, toured, and recorded with Mike Schey, Mark Buzard, Don Raymond, and for the DVD recording and summer 2007 tour, [[The Honorary Title]]'s drummer Adam Boyd. The Format chose their name to make fun of the music industry's inclination towards a cookie-cutter "format" for a hit. Formed in 2000, the band announced a hiatus on February 4, 2008.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=2008-02-04|title=News Roundup: Arcade Fire, Gang of Four, Radiohead, the Format|url=https://www.spin.com/2008/02/news-roundup-arcade-fire-gang-four-radiohead-format/|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=2008-04-10}}</ref> On February 4, 2020, they announced a return from their hiatus for a tour of special shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/02/03/the-format-reunion-phoenix-live-at-the-mayan-concert-album-film/4650713002/|title=Here's what happened when the Format played a surprise reunion concert in downtown Phoenix|last=Masley|first=Ed|website=azcentral|language=en|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>

==History==

Before forming The Format in February 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theformat.com/05.html |title=theformat.com |date=19 February 2003 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030219051757/http://theformat.com/05.html |archive-date=19 February 2003 }}</ref> Means and Ruess, who had been friends since grade school,<ref>{{cite magazine| title =Band of the day: The Format| magazine =[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]| date =2006-07-14| url =http://www.spin.com/features/band_of_the_day/2006/07/060714_theformat/| access-date =2008-02-05 }}</ref> formed the band Nevergonnascore and released the EP "The Byron Sessions" which had generated some record label interest but not a deal.<ref name="NewTimes1">{{cite web| last =Laudig| first =Michele| title =Format Busters| website =[[Phoenix New Times]]| date =2006-07-06| url =http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2006-07-06/news/format-busters/| access-date =2008-02-05 }}</ref>

The duo's first single, aptly titled "[[The First Single]]" from their five-song demo, ''[[EP (The Format album)|EP]]'', became locally popular on [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] radio station [[KZON|KEDJ]] and led to the duo signing with [[Elektra Records]] in 2002.  Their first studio album, ''[[Interventions + Lullabies]]'', recorded and produced by [[R. Walt Vincent]] and released in October 2003, was very successful around the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] area. The band's fan base grew due to word of mouth, the Internet, and extensive touring. The album sold over 100,000 copies in the US.<ref name="NewTimes1" />
l
After Elektra folded, The Format released a second EP, ''[[Snails (The Format album)|Snails]]'', with sister label [[Atlantic Records]] in April 2005. As they began to work on their second full-length album, they drew on the influences of 1970s pop music, including [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[The Beach Boys]], and decided to collaborate with [[Redd Kross]] founder [[Steven Shane McDonald]] whom they brought on as record producer.<ref name="NewTimes1" /> But Atlantic Records executives were not impressed{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} by the 1970s-pop-influenced demos and released The Format from its contract. Upon completing the album, ''[[Dog Problems]]'', Ruess and Means, with help from their management company, decided to release it themselves through their newly established imprint label: The Vanity Label.<ref>{{cite news| last =Ferrucci| first =Patrick| title =Label 'Problems' not a big deal for The Format| page =W23| newspaper =[[New Haven Register]]| date =2006-10-27}}</ref> Two months prior to the album's release, an [[MP3]] version was leaked to the internet. In response, The Format decided to make the album immediately available digitally for only $7.99 via the [[Nettwerk]] Music Store, which led to the sale of over 2,000 digital copies prior to the album's official release.<ref name="NewTimes1" /> ''[[Dog Problems]]'' was released in stores on July 11, 2006. The day the album was released, an episode of [[MTV]]'s ''[[My Super Sweet 16]]'' featuring The Format aired, on which they performed at a birthday-graduation party for Priya and Divya Kothapalli from [[Nederland, Texas]].

Following the release of ''Dog Problems'', The Format gained more attention, receiving high marks from various publications{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, even topping some Best of 2006 lists. During this year, The Format toured near constantly, supporting their own album ''[[Dog Problems]]'' as well as supporting [[The All American Rejects]] in September in the UK.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Format, Motion City Tour with All American Rejects |url=https://www.spin.com/2006/08/format-motion-city-tour-all-american-rejects/ |magazine=Spin |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>

In 2007, The Format played a show in [[Tokyo, Japan]], were featured on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'' twice, co-headlined with [[Guster]] on their Campus Consciousness tour,<ref name="Telegram">{{cite news| last =McLennan| first =Scott| title =The Format not just another emo band| page =E3| newspaper =[[Telegram & Gazette]]| date =2007-04-10}}</ref> and toured with [[Reubens Accomplice]], [[Piebald]], [[Limbeck]], [[Steel Train]], and [[The Honorary Title]].

On June 25, 2007, celebrating the one-year anniversary of ''[[Dog Problems]]'', The Format offered the album in its entirety, including the liner notes in PDF form, for free on their official website. The offer was valid from June 25 to July 16, 2007. As of July 10, 2007, 36,000 people had downloaded the album.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Format "Dog Problems" FOR FREE! |url=http://www.powerpopaholic.com/2007/06/format-dog-problems-for-free.html |website=powerpopaholic.com |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>

On February 4, 2008, The Format announced that they would be putting the band on hiatus, with Nate Ruess posting the following message on the band's website:

{{quote|We have just put out word that we will not be making a new Format album. Please understand this was a tough decision and we're both upset about it. While we accept there will be false speculation as to why, understand that Sam and I remain extremely close and in fact are still passing the [[Twin Peaks]] box set back and forth in an attempt to figure out who REALLY killed [[Laura Palmer]]. We also want to thank everyone with and within the Format, particularly Mike, Don, and Marko, whom without, none of this would have ever even been fully realized. We both suggest you support their musical talents and whatever they decide to do. And lastly we want to thank the fans who made this the best 5 years of our lives.<ref>[http://www.theformat.com/index2.html News post, titled "Important."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210045655/http://www.theformat.com/index2.html |date=2008-02-10 }}  The Format's official website.

Means has completed solo work, including scoring the soundtrack to the film ''[[The Sinking of Santa Isabel]]'',<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091008020449/http://www.indierockcafe.com/2009/09/formats-sam-means-and-nate-nuess.html ]</ref> as well as forming [[Destry (band)|Destry]] with former [[Straylight Run]] singer Michelle DaRosa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/30711 |title=Sam Means (ex-Format) forms Destry with Michelle DaRosa (Straylight Run) |website=Punknews.org |date=2008-10-04 |access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>

When asked about the band getting back together, Ruess acknowledged that "every one of us like to remain optimistic and hopeful that it one day could happen."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://streetteams.nettwerk.com/thelivingroom/dearnate/welcome.action |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110163859/http://streetteams.nettwerk.com/thelivingroom/dearnate/welcome.action |archive-date=2008-11-10 }}</ref>

Following The Format's 2008 breakup, Ruess joined with [[Andrew Dost]] of [[Anathallo]] and [[Jack Antonoff]] of [[Steel Train]] to form [[Fun (band)|Fun]], a band that has gone on to more commercial success than any of its associated former acts, with the pop hits "[[We Are Young]]" and "[[Some Nights (song)|Some Nights]]" becoming some of the most popular songs of 2012. Fun began recording their debut album, ''[[Aim and Ignite]]'', in September 2008 with producer [[Steven Shane McDonald]] and arranger [[Roger Joseph Manning Jr.]]; it was released on August 25, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/fun |title=fun. &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos |website=Myspace.com |access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>

On February 3, 2020, the band formally re-released their 2007 concert film ''Live At The Mayan'' to streaming services and vinyl (previously only available on DVD.) The band also reunited for a live screening of the film and their first acoustic concert in over 12 years. The next day, the band announced a reunion in the spring of 2020 with concerts in [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-format-reunion-shows-947636/|title=The Format Reunite After 12 Years, Announce 2020 Tour Dates|last=Martoccio|first=Angie|date=2020-02-04|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>

In March 2020, their tour (originally scheduled for March and April 2020) was postponed to July 2020 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. In June 2020, it was postponed again to July 2021.
