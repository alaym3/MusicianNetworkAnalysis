==Life and career==
Chaka Chaka was born in [[Dobsonville]] in [[Soweto]].<ref name="BeyondMemory"/> Chaka Chaka had it tough growing up. Her father died when she was 11 and her mother, a [[domestic worker]], brought up three daughters on her meagre 40-[[South African rand|rand]]-a-month salary.

Chaka Chaka started singing at 19 in 1984 when Phil Hollis of Dephon Records discovered her in [[Johannesburg]].<ref name="BeyondMemory"/> Dubbed "the Princess of Africa", Chaka Chaka experienced a meteoric rise as a music star of infectious pop melodies and dance music during the height of apartheid. Her début album was called ''I'm in Love With a DJ''. Songs like "I'm Burning Up", "I Cry for Freedom", "Sangoma", "Motherland" and the ever-popular "[[Umqombothi (song)|Umqombothi]]" immediately ensured Chaka Chaka's status as a star on South Africa's [[mbaqanga]] music scene.

''Sangoma'' was released in 1987 on [[Mercury Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Yvonne-Chaka-Chaka-Sangoma/master/1095940|title=Yvonne Chaka Chaka - Sangoma|website=www.discogs.com|language=en|access-date=2020-09-29}}</ref> Its track listing was ''Sangoma'', ''Come a Little Bit Closer'', ''Private Lover'', ''Save Me'', ''Stimela'' and ''I'm Gonna Stop Loving You''.

"Mama Africa", [[Miriam Makeba]], said of her "She's my baby!"; [[Hugh Masekela]] adds that Chaka Chaka is "my mad niece". Legends [[Dolly Rathebe]] and [[Dorothy Masuka]] describe Chaka Chaka's music as "something that all should listen to".

When asked who she admired most, Chaka Chaka said,{{cquote|My mother because she has always been there for me. My mother raised three daughters single-handedly on a domestic worker's salary. That took great courage and strength. She is my mentor and hero. When I was born in 1965 in Soweto, it was during [[apartheid]], and those were extremely difficult times. My dad was a great musician who could never realise his dream. He died when I was 11 years old. I inherited my talent from both parents, so music has always been in my blood. When I was little I would strum an empty tin and blow into a broom stick pretending it was a microphone. I sang in [[church choir]]s. I loved singing. I am blessed that I achieved my destiny, and been able to accomplish what my father could not.}}Of the numerous world leaders Yvonne has met, she says her favourite is mentor and father figure, [[Nelson Mandela]]. He called her his "dear daughter". "Madiba", as he is affectionately known, recounted that it was Yvonne's music that helped sustain him and others while confined as prisoners on Robben Island. He said,{{cquote|"It is what we make of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another. Yvonne, you are a testament to my belief. Your generosity has benefited untold numbers of families and orphans facing the challenges of AIDS, terminal illness, abuse, poverty and illiteracy."}}

Chaka Chaka has four sons with her husband Tiny Mhinga,<ref name="BeyondMemory"/>She has a degree and diploma from the [[University of South Africa]], one in adult education, another in local government, management and administration.
