"'''Bodysnatcher'''" was a partly finished script that was written but unused for the first series of the BBC sci-fi sitcom ''[[Red Dwarf]]''. It was said to involve the now intangible Rimmer attempting to construct a body of his own using components of Lister's—such as hair.

== History ==

"Bodysnatcher" was one of the scripts to be handed around during the interview process for the main casting, although at this point it was unnamed.  This script allegedly caught the attention of Peter Ridsdale-Scott, the commissioner for [[BBC Manchester]] that he read on the train bound for [[BBC London]]. [[Alfred Molina]] and [[Alan Rickman]], who were auditioning<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/05/how-we-made-red-dwarf-doug-naylor-craig-charles-bbc|title=How we made Red Dwarf|author=Rich Pelley|date=5 March 2019|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> for Lister and Rimmer, performed their audition from this script. One of Cat's lines:

<blockquote>
"I've eaten five times, I've slept six times, and I've made a lot of things mine. Tomorrow, I'm gonna see if I can have ''sex'' with something!"
</blockquote>

was originally in this episode's script, but was moved to "[[Confidence and Paranoia]]" when the original script was dropped.

== Inconsistencies ==

Because this script was conceptualised and part-written at a very early stage of development, many areas of the script do not gel with the other episodes of Series I. For example, the [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]] does not speak to anyone but himself. The characters underwent minor development and back story elements were changed throughout Series I, and so the unnamed script would have had to undergo major changes to fit in with the rest of the series and the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] in general.

== Deletion ==
The original series finale involved Lister resurrecting Kochanski's hologram from the projection disc he found with Confidence. However, when the unnamed script was dropped, "[[Me²]]" was written to compensate for the missing episode and the ending of "[[Confidence and Paranoia]]" was similarly changed so that the disc in Kochanski's box was in fact Rimmer's.

== Home video release ==

To headline the release of [[Red Dwarf Remastered]] on DVD in November 2007, the same audio story board process used in recreating the lost episode of Series VII, "[[Identity Within]]", was used to create the "Bodysnatcher" episode.<ref name="Bodysnatcher">{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2007/11/09/the-bodysnatcher-collection | title =The Bodysnatcher collection | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =30 January 2008}}</ref> When the script was retrieved from the vaults of [[Grant Naylor]] offices, it was found to be without an ending. The writers [[Rob Grant]] and [[Doug Naylor]], who went their separate ways during pre-production on the ITV series ''[[The 10%ers]]'' in 1996, collaborated on bringing the script into line with the series' continuity and giving it an end.

"Bodysnatcher" became the title feature of the DVD release, due in part to its name and the potentially misleading quality of the "remastered" moniker (as the remastering was done in 1998, not 2007). The DVD set was then entitled "Red Dwarf: The Bodysnatcher Collection". The episode was also included on the [[Blu-ray]] release of ''Red Dwarf I-VIII.''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2018/10/26/were-covered/ | title =We're Covered | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =12 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.ganymede.tv/2019/01/red-dwarf-series-i-viii-bluray-review/|title=Red Dwarf: Series I-VIII Bluray Review|author=Ian Symes|date=18 January 2019|publisher=Ganymede & Titan}}</ref>
