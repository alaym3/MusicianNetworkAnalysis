== Background ==
The band is from [[Mount Vernon, Kentucky]]. They have released five full-length albums and two Christmas EPs. Their biggest radio single is "[[God Is on the Move (song)|God Is on the Move]]" which stayed at No. 1 for five weeks and was the #5 song of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/7eventh-time-down/chart-history/christian-airplay/song/936121|title=7eventh Time Down - God Is on the Move (Christian Airplay)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref> Their single Just Say Jesus remained on the charts for 52 consecutive weeks and was the #16 song of 2014. Their new album will release spring 2022.

== Reception ==
Mariah Secrest said "it only takes about two seconds to like the band members from 7eventh Time Down. These Kentucky boys will welcome you at once with their good-natured banter and laid-back persona. But don't let them fool you. On stage, they mean business."<ref name=WRECKED>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrecked.org/arts/mariah-secrest/|title=Voices in Culture: 7eventh Time Down|last=Secrest|first=Mariah|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=Wrecked|access-date=April 23, 2012}}</ref> They are "Straight up rock 'n rollers, they blend classic rock tactics to make their sound aggressive with enough melodic hooks to lodge their choruses into the mind long after the show is over. They pull from the best of timeless bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Who]], [[The Doors]], [[AC/DC]] and even [[Johnny Cash]], infusing a raucous yet {{Sic|?|hide=y|carefully|-}}crafted musical landscape with lyrics that shoot straight-from-the-hip."<ref name=WRECKED/>

== Philanthropy ==
The Band supports [[CURE International]], a nonprofit organization that assists kids who have physical disabilities.<ref>"[http://theundergroundsite.com/7eventh-time-down-talks-about-new-album-passion-for-god/ 7eventh Time Down talks about new album, passion for God] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625165114/http://theundergroundsite.com/7eventh-time-down-talks-about-new-album-passion-for-god/ |date=2014-06-25 }}."
