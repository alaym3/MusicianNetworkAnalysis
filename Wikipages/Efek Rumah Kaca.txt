==Career==

===2001–2007: Early years and first album===
The band formed in 2001 with five members, but in 2003 became a trio.<ref name="tmi">{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/opinion/article/efek-rumah-kaca-sebuah-band-pop-sosial-politik/ |title=Efek Rumah Kaca — sebuah band pop sosial politik |first=Zulhabri |last=Supian |date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103082823/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/opinion/article/efek-rumah-kaca-sebuah-band-pop-sosial-politik/ |archivedate=January 3, 2012 }} {{in lang|ms}}</ref> The band's name at first was ''Hush'', then ''Superego''. They finally chose the name ''Efek Rumah Kaca'' after the release of their first album in 2007.<ref name= "tjp1"/>

In 2007, they released ''[[Efek Rumah Kaca (album)|Efek Rumah Kaca]]'' and the album sold more than 5,000 copies.<ref name="tjg">{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/lifeandtimes/efek-rumah-kaca-keeps-getting-hotter-/309162 |title=Efek Rumah Kaca Keeps Getting Hotter |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=June 15, 2011 |first=Marcel |last=Thee |newspaper=The Jakarta Globe |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926192759/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/lifeandtimes/efek-rumah-kaca-keeps-getting-hotter-/309162 |archivedate=September 26, 2012 }}</ref> Two singles of this album are "Di Udara" ({{lang-en|In The Air}}) which tells the death of [[Munir Said Thalib]] and "Cinta Melulu" ({{lang-en|Always Love}}) as a criticism of the increasing prevalence of love-inspired songs in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/entertainment/jfcc-brings-back-its-jam-for-journalists/427708 |title= JFCC Brings Back Its Jam For Journalists |first= Marcel |last= Thee |date= March 9, 2011 |newspaper= The Jakarta Globe |accessdate= July 1, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110312053429/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/entertainment/jfcc-brings-back-its-jam-for-journalists/427708 |archive-date= March 12, 2011 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

===2008–2011: ''Kamar Gelap'' and major recognition===
In 2008, ''[[Kamar Gelap]]'' ({{lang-en|Dark Room}}), their second album, was released.<ref name= "tjp2">{{cite news |url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/09/efek-rumah-kaca-planning-a-coup.html |title= Efek Rumah Kaca planning a coup |first= Felix |last= Daas |date= May 9, 2011 |accessdate= June 13, 2011 |newspaper= The Jakarta Post |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100522101433/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/09/efek-rumah-kaca-planning-a-coup.html |archive-date= May 22, 2010 |url-status= live }}</ref> Among the tracks from this album are "Jangan Bakar Buku" ({{lang-en|Don't Burn Books}}), "Kenakalan Remaja di Era Informatika" ({{lang-en|Teenage Mischief in the Information Era}}) and "Mosi Tidak Percaya" ({{lang-en|Motion of no-confidence}}).<ref name= "tjp1"/> They were nominated for three awards in the same year: [[Anugerah Musik Indonesia]]'s "Best Alternative Production Work", "The Best Cutting Edge" in the [[MTV Indonesia Music Awards]],and [[Rolling Stone Indonesia]]'s "Editors’ Choice Awards: Rookie of the Year". Efek Rumah Kaca then went on to win the latter two.

In May 2010, they founded a [[record label]], ''Jangan Marah Records'' ({{lang-en|Don't Be Angry Records}}), hoping to accommodate creative bands that are not accepted by major labels.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/musik/2010/05/05/brk,20100505-245844,id.html |title= Band Efek Rumah Kaca Rilis |date= May 5, 2011 |accessdate= June 13, 2011 |newspaper= Tempo |language= id |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100507103815/http://www.tempointeraktif.com/hg/musik/2010/05/05/brk,20100505-245844,id.html |archive-date= May 7, 2010 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

===2012–2014: Hiatus and ''Pandai Besi''===
Efek Rumah Kaca used a more 'crowded formation' when they were playing at a festival in June 2012, thus the birth of a new project, called "Pandai Besi". A tight concert schedule and Adrian's health condition hampered the band on the completion of Efek Rumah Kaca's third album. Limitations of musical skills, routine office work and the health condition of Adrian became a trigger for Cholil and Akbar to find the right gap in order to continue working. They invited four musician friends who were deliberately selected for their different backgrounds and musical tastes to ‘recycle’ Efek Rumah Kaca's songs. They ended up re-arranging nine songs from their previous albums into a new album under the "Pandai Besi" name, titled ''Daur Baur''. In March 2013, Pandai Besi – with more members to the group – recorded the re-arranged songs at [[Lokananta]], [[Surakarta]], through crowdfunding method by the fans. Due to overwhelming requests from the public for a physical record, on June 29, 2013, Demajors Records officially released the physical copy of the album. ''Daur Baur'' received critical acclaim from music critics. [[Rolling Stone]] Indonesia wrote, "If Pandai Besi was a new band and this is a new song material, then the Daur Baur album will be Indonesia’s best debut album since the first album of Efek Rumah Kaca..." [[The Jakarta Globe]] said, "The whole album is littered with welcome surprises. Virtually every track ends up far from where it began. Perhaps the best thing to be said about Pandai Besi is that the band sounds like it exists as its own entity, without the baggage of its main, more famous, persona. The songs make their original versions feel like demos.."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://efekrumahkaca.net/pandaibesi/ |title=Pandai Besi, An Efek Rumah Kaca's Project |work=efekrumahkaca.net |date=November 3, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218130756/http://efekrumahkaca.net/pandaibesi/ |archive-date=February 18, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===2015–present: ''Sinestesia'' and another hiatus===
After Efek Rumah Kaca's hiatus, On July 10, 2015, the band released a new single titled "Pasar Bisa Diciptakan" ({{lang-en|Markets Can Be Created}}),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rollingstone.co.id/article/read/2015/07/13/140502847/1093/efek-rumah-kaca-rilis-single-terbaru-pasar-bisa-diciptakan- |title=Efek Rumah Kaca Rilis Single Terbaru, ‘Pasar Bisa Diciptakan’ |work=rollingstone.co.id |date=July 13, 2015 |accessdate=January 2, 2016 |language=id |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195833/http://www.rollingstone.co.id/article/read/2015/07/13/140502847/1093/efek-rumah-kaca-rilis-single-terbaru-pasar-bisa-diciptakan- |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> a fragment of the song "Biru" ({{lang-en|Blue}}) which was based on making a further elaboration of "Cinta Melulu", restlessness the band felt on the process of making art and its position in the market/industry. The full version of "Biru" – consisting of "Pasar Bisa Diciptakan" and "Cipta Bisa Dipasarkan ({{lang-en|Creations Can Be Marketed}}) – was then released a month later in August.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://efekrumahkaca.net/id/news/erk-s-latest-news/item/761-efek-rumah-kaca-kembali-dengan-eksperimentasi-lagu-melalui-biru#.VpKTUUChPIU|title=Efek Rumah Kaca Kembali dengan Eksperimentasi Lagu Melalui "Biru"|work=efekrumahkaca.net|date=August 11, 2015|accessdate=February 25, 2016|language=id|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305041352/http://efekrumahkaca.net/id/news/erk-s-latest-news/item/761-efek-rumah-kaca-kembali-dengan-eksperimentasi-lagu-melalui-biru#.VpKTUUChPIU|archive-date=March 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> On September 18, Efek Rumah Kaca held a concert titled "Pasar Bisa Dikonserkan" ({{lang-en|Markets Can Be Concerted}}) in Balai Sartika, [[Bandung]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mtv.id/news/efek-rumah-kaca-mempersembahkan-pasar-bisa-dikonserkan/ |title=EFEK RUMAH KACA Gelar Konser Tunggal |work=mtv.co.id |date=18 September 2015 |accessdate=2 January 2016 |language=id |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113513/http://mtv.id/news/efek-rumah-kaca-mempersembahkan-pasar-bisa-dikonserkan/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> but it drew a lot of disappointment from the crowd due to technical difficulties. A few days later the band apologized, while also releasing the single "Putih" ({{lang-en|White}}) on the same day. "Putih" is divided into two parts, "Tiada" ({{lang-en|Non-Existent}}) and "Ada" ({{lang-en|Existent}}), and tells the story about family. The idea for "Tiada" came from their conversation with a friend who later passed away before the song was finished, while "Ada" came from the happiness of the birth of their children.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://efekrumahkaca.net/en/news/erk-s-latest-news/item/763-press-release-single-putih-efek-rumah-kaca#.Vogh7UChPIU |title=Press Release Lagu 'Putih' - Efek Rumah Kaca |work=efekrumahkaca.net |date=23 September 2015 |accessdate=2 January 2016 |language=id |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229194142/http://efekrumahkaca.net/en/news/erk-s-latest-news/item/763-press-release-single-putih-efek-rumah-kaca#.Vogh7UChPIU |archive-date=29 December 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On December 18, the band finally released their third album, ''[[Sinestesia (album)|Sinestesia]]'', on [[iTunes]] for free. All of the songs in the album are named after colors, with each named after the color Adrian – who suffers from [[Behçet's disease]] that has caused his loss of sight – sees when he hears each song.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/01/22/albumreview-sinestesia-efek-rumah.html|last1=Widianto|first1=Shirley|title=AlbumReviews: 'Sinestesia' by Efek Rumah|work=The Jakarta Post|date=22 January 2016|accessdate=26 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224234756/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/01/22/albumreview-sinestesia-efek-rumah.html|archive-date=24 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
