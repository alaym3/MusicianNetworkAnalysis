'''Grant Lee Buffalo''' was an American [[rock music|rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States, consisting of [[Grant-Lee Phillips]] ([[singing|vocals]] and [[guitar]]), Paul Kimble ([[bass guitar|bass]]) and Joey Peters ([[drum]]s). All three were previously members of another Los Angeles band, Shiva Burlesque.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

==Shiva Burlesque==
Grant-Lee Phillips, Paul Kimble and Joey Peters started as a rock music formation called Shiva Burlesque.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=540–1}}</ref> The band was active in the late 1980s. It released two studio albums, the self-titled ''Shiva Burlesque'' in 1987 on Fundamental Records. The follow up album, the band's second and last album was ''Mercury Blues'' and was released in 1990 on Ripple Effect record label. Shiva Burlesque was reformed in 1991 as Grant Lee Buffalo.<ref name="Larkin"/>

==Career==
Grant Lee Buffalo released four [[album]]s: ''[[Fuzzy (album)|Fuzzy]]'' (1993), ''[[Mighty Joe Moon]]'' (1994), ''[[Copperopolis (album)|Copperopolis]]''  (1996) and ''[[Jubilee (Grant Lee Buffalo album)|Jubilee]]'' (1998).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  They toured with major bands including [[R.E.M.]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[the Smashing Pumpkins]], and [[The Cranberries]]. In the [[United States]], the band's 1998 [[single (music)|single]], "[[Truly, Truly]]", received extensive [[airplay (radio)|airplay]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Paul Kimble departed the band in 1997,<ref name="grantleebuffalo.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.grantleebuffalo.com/history4.html |title=History &#124; Part 4: The Search for Copperopolis |publisher=Grant Lee Buffalo |access-date=2012-05-15}}</ref> but Grant Lee Buffalo's next album ''Jubilee'' met with more success than the prior releases thanks to "Truly, Truly." But, as Phillips describes, a number of changes led to the dissolution of the band's time at their label and their time together.

:"The celebrational spirit of Jubilee actually brought a renewed optimism to me personally. The album was well received and understandably the expectations at the label were high, probably too high. Although the highly refined Jubilee had brought the band considerable success at radio with "Truly, Truly," a shift within the industry was well underway. The label's constant nagging about "Call-out Response" was both a new term and a bewildering concept to our ears. The basic strategy: a radio station arranges to call up a listener who is asked to consume about 30 songs over the phone, perhaps 20 seconds of each. From this remote encounter, the listener will then proceed to judge the material. Insufficient call-out response was a big reason that Jubilee hardly got a shot at Warners. Grant Lee Buffalo tunes are often like an old car or an old amp that needs a few seconds to get warmed up, but when it does... look out! Meanwhile, a new crop of young record buyers, the largest since the Baby Boomer era, were now being targeted to the exclusion of Gen-Xers, like myself, still waiting for the Pixies to reform.<ref name=quote>{{cite web|url=http://www.grantleebuffalo.com/history5.html |title=History &#124; Part 5: The Midnight Jubilee |publisher=Grant Lee Buffalo |access-date=2012-05-15}}</ref>

In 2001, a [[compilation album|compilation]] of singles, album tracks and rarities called ''Storm Hymnal'' was released.

Grant Lee Buffalo's sound is comparable to [[Neil Young]] and an electrified version of Americana songwriter John Stewart.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Phillips writes that their first album "would galvanize the sound of Grant Lee Buffalo, i.e., the acoustic feedback howl of overdriven 12-string guitars, melodic distorto-bass, tribal drum bombast, the old world churn of pump organs and parlor pianos."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grantleebuffalo.com/history2.html |title=History &#124; Part 2: The Fuzzy Era |publisher=Grant Lee Buffalo |access-date=2012-05-15}}</ref>

Lyrically, they reference American history as well as contemporary events.<ref name="Larkin"/> For instance, “Lone Star Song” from ''[[Mighty Joe Moon]]'' references the [[Branch Davidian|Waco siege]] and “Crackdown” from ''[[Copperopolis (album)|Copperopolis]]'' references the murder of [[Yoshihiro Hattori]] as well as the [[Oklahoma City bombing]].
In May 2011 the band returned on a limited tour, making stops in Los Angeles, Dublin, London, Brussels, Copenhagen  and Oslo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.josefpeters.com/2011/02/11/grant-lee-buffalo-special-reunion-tour-and-limited-dates/ |title=Grant Lee Buffalo Special Reunion Tour and Limited Dates |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Josef Peters |access-date=2014-06-26}}</ref> On August 8, 2011, the band performed at [[Folk Dranouter|Dranouter festival]] in Belgium, and on August 9 in Copenhagen. The band also played at the German [[Haldern Pop]] Festival in August 2012.

In October 2017, [[Chrysalis Records]] acquired Grant Lee Buffalo's back catalog from Slash Records. Chrysalis/Blue Raincoat CEO Jeremy Lascelles had previously signed the band to [[Chrysalis Music|the label's publisher]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/labels/read/chrysalis-acquires-parlophone-catalogues-under-divestment-deal/070316|title=Chrysalis acquires Parlophone catalogues under divestment deal|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en}}</ref>

==Solo careers==
{{Main|Grant-Lee Phillips}}
Lead singer [[Grant-Lee Phillips#Solo career|Phillips]] has had his own solo career as well. He explains:

:As for Grant Lee Buffalo, I sensed they were beginning to wonder if we'd ever get through finishing school. Before that could happen, band and label parted as did Peters and myself. The scenery was changing and I was looking for new explorations. I'm sure we all were. Perhaps we always will be."<ref name=quote/>

He was signed to the Boston-based indie label Rounder Records and launched a solo career, issuing ''[[Ladies' Love Oracle]]'' online in 2000. The recording was later more widely released. His first full-length album, ''[[Mobilize (Grant-Lee Phillips album)|Mobilize]]'', was released in 2001. Phillips has released ten albums between 2000 and 2020.
