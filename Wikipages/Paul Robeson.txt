'''Paul Leroy Robeson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|b|s|ən}} {{respell|ROHB|sən}};<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsr.cs.uchicago.edu/robeson/links/quotes.html |title=Paul Robeson Quotations |publisher=Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration |access-date=March 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=What's the Name, Please? |first=Frank H. |last=Vizetelly |author-link=Frank Horace Vizetelly |date=March 3, 1934 |journal=[[The Literary Digest]] |page=11 }}</ref> April 9, 1898&nbsp;– January 23, 1976) was an American [[bass (voice type)|bass baritone]] concert artist, stage and film actor, athlete, and activist who became famous both for his cultural accomplishments and for his political stances. 

In 1915, Robeson won an academic scholarship to Rutgers College. While at Rutgers, he was twice named a consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] in football and was the class valedictorian. He received his LL.B. from Columbia Law School while playing in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). After graduation, he became a figure in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] with performances in ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' and ''[[All God's Chillun Got Wings (play)|All God's Chillun Got Wings]]''.

Robeson performed in Britain in a touring melodrama, ''Voodoo'', in 1922, and in ''Emperor Jones'' in 1925. In 1928, he scored a major success in the London premiere of ''[[Show Boat]]''. Living in London for several years with his wife [[Eslanda Goode Robeson|Eslanda]], Robeson continued to establish himself as a concert artist and starred in a London production of ''[[Othello]]'', the first of three productions of the play over the course of his career. He also gained attention in ''[[Sanders of the River]]'' (1935) and in the film production of ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1936). Robeson's political activities began with his involvement with unemployed workers and anti-imperialist students in Britain, and it continued with his support for the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] cause during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and his involvement in the [[Council on African Affairs]] (CAA).

After returning to the United States in 1939, Robeson supported the American and Allied war efforts during World War II. However, his history of supporting civil rights causes and Soviet policies brought scrutiny from the [[FBI]]. After the war ended, the CAA was placed on the [[Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations]]. Robeson was investigated during the [[McCarthy era]]. Due to his decision not to recant his public advocacy, he was denied a passport by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]; his income, consequently, plummeted. He moved to [[Harlem]] and published a periodical called [[Freedom (American newspaper)|''Freedom'']],<ref>{{cite web |title=Freedom |url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/freedom/ |publisher=NYU Libraries |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> which was critical of United States policies, from 1950 to 1955. Robeson's right to travel was eventually restored as a result of the 1958 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Kent v. Dulles]]''. 

Between 1925 and 1961, Robeson recorded and released some 276 songs. The first of these were the [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] "[[Steal Away]]" (backed with "[[Were You There]]") in 1925. Robeson's recorded repertoire spanned many styles, including Americana, popular standards, classical music, European folk songs, political songs, poetry and spoken excerpts from plays.<ref>[http://www.cpsr.cs.uchicago.edu/robeson/links/discography.html "Resources About Paul Robeson (1898–1976)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622165600/http://www.cpsr.cs.uchicago.edu/robeson/links/discography.html |date=June 22, 2017 }}, Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration.

Robeson traveled to Moscow in June 1949, and tried to find [[Itzik Feffer]] whom he had met during World War II. He let Soviet authorities know that he wanted to see him.{{sfn|Duberman|1989|pp=352–53}} Reluctant to lose Robeson as a propagandist for the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Lustiger|2003|pages=210–11}} the Soviets brought Feffer from prison to him.

And we are resolved to share it equally.  We reject any hysterical raving that urges us to make war on anyone.  Our will to fight for peace is strong.  We shall not make war on anyone.  We shall not make war on the Soviet Union.  We oppose those who wish to build up imperialist Germany and to establish fascism in Greece.  We wish peace with Franco's Spain despite her fascism.  We shall support peace and friendship among all nations, with Soviet Russia and the people's Republics." He was blacklisted for saying this in the mainstream press within the United States, including in many periodicals of the Negro press such as ''The Crisis''.<ref>{{harvnb|Robeson|2001|pp=142–43}}</ref>

McCoy, Director of Publicity for Rutgers, and although this list says that Rutgers had two All-Americans at the time of the publishing of the book, the book only lists the other All-American and does not list Robeson as being an All-American. {{harvnb|Walsh|1949|p= 684}}</ref> Months later, NBC canceled Robeson's appearance on [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]'s television program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Roosevelt sees a 'Misunderstanding'|date=March 15, 1950|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/03/16/87147203.pdf|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 15, 2018|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728044554/https://timesmachine/1950/03/16/87147203.html?pdf_redirect=true&site=false|url-status=live}}</ref> Subsequently, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] denied Robeson a passport and issued a "stop notice" at all ports.

In 1950, Robeson co-founded, with [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a monthly newspaper, [[Freedom (American newspaper)|''Freedom'']], showcasing his views and those of his circle.  Most issues had a column by Robeson, on the front page.  In the final issue, July–August 1955, an unsigned column on the front page of the newspaper described the struggle for the restoration of his passport.  It called for support from the leading African-American organizations, and asserted that "Negroes, [and] all Americans who have breathed a sigh of relief at the easing of international tensions... have a stake in the Paul Robeson passport case." An article by Robeson appeared on the second page continuing the passport issue under the headline: "If Enough People Write Washington I'll Get My Passport in a Hurry."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Robeson |first1=Paul |title=If Enough People Write Washington I'll Get My Passport in a Hurry |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/vhhmgvws |access-date=September 26, 2020 |work=Freedom |volume=V |issue=6 |publisher=Freedom Associates |date=July–August 1955 |hdl=2333.1/vhhmgvws |archive-date=December 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201217104534/http://dlib.nyu.edu/freedom/books/tamwag_fdm000045/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In December 1951, Robeson, in New York City, and [[William L.

In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, in May 1952, labor unions in the United States and Canada organized a concert at the International [[Peace Arch]] on the border between Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia.{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p= 400}} Robeson returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p= 411}} and over the next two years, two further concerts took place. In this period, with the encouragement of his friend the Welsh politician [[Aneurin Bevan]], Robeson recorded a number of radio concerts for supporters in Wales.

In 1956, Robeson was called before HUAC after he refused to sign an affidavit affirming that he was not a Communist.

Still generally unable to perform abroad in person, on May 26, 1957 Robeson sang for a London audience at [[Camden Town Hall|St. Pancras Town Hall]] (where the 1,000 available concert tickets sold out within an hour) via the recently completed transatlantic telephone cable [[TAT-1]].<ref name="BBC: Hidden Histories of the Information Age 5 January 2016 9:50">{{cite episode|title=Hidden Histories of the Information Age: TAT-1|series=Hidden Histories of the Information Age|credits=Presenters: [[Aleks Krotoski]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04m3bcc|airdate=January 5, 2016|minutes=9:50|access-date=January 6, 2016|archive-date=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620062847/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04m3bcc|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="BBC: Hidden Histories of the Information Age 5 January 2016 0:55">{{cite episode|title=Hidden Histories of the Information Age: TAT-1|series=Hidden Histories of the Information Age|credits=Presenters: [[Aleks Krotoski]]|station=BBC Radio 4|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04m3bcc|airdate=January 5, 2016|minutes=0:55|access-date=January 6, 2016|archive-date=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620062847/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04m3bcc|url-status=live}}</ref> In October of that year, using the same technology, Robeson sang to an audience of 5,000 at [[Grand Pavilion, Porthcawl|Porthcawl's Grand Pavilion]] in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/explorefurther/images/robeson/|title=Showcase: Let Robeson Sing|last=Howard|first=Tony|date=January 29, 2009|publisher=[[University of Warwick]]|access-date=November 15, 2011|archive-date=February 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220112912/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/explorefurther/images/robeson/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Sparrow |first1=Jeff |title=How Paul Robeson found his political voice in the Welsh valleys |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/02/how-paul-robeson-found-political-voice-in-welsh-valleys |access-date=September 7, 2021 |date=July 2, 2017}}</ref>

[[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s denunciation of [[Stalinism]] at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|1956 Party Congress]] silenced Robeson on Stalin, although Robeson continued to praise the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p=437}}  That year Robeson, along with close friend [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], compared the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|anti-Soviet uprising in Hungary]] to the "same sort of people who overthrew the Spanish Republican Government" and supported the Soviet invasion and suppression of the revolt.<ref name="finger"/>

Robeson's passport was finally restored in 1958 as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court's 5 to 4 decision in ''[[Kent v. Dulles]]'' where the majority ruled that the denial of a passport without [[due process]] amounted to a violation of constitutionally protected liberty under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th Amendment]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Glass |first1=Andrew |title=Paul robeson loses passport appeal, Aug. 16, 1955 |journal=Politico |date=August 16, 2018 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/16/paul-robeson-loses-passport-appeal-aug-16-1955-774738 |access-date=September 7, 2017}}</ref>

On October 11, 1959, Robeson took part in a service at [[St. Paul's Cathedral, London|St.&nbsp;Paul's Cathedral]], the first black performer to sing there.{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p=471}}

On a trip to Moscow, Robeson experienced bouts of dizziness and heart problems and was hospitalized for two months while Essie was diagnosed with operable cancer.{{sfn|Robeson|1981|p=218}} He recovered and returned to the UK to visit the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].<!--disjointed-->

In 1960, in what was his final concert performance in Great Britain, Robeson sang to raise money for the [[Movement for Colonial Freedom]] at the [[Royal Festival Hall]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Daniel G. |date=April 15, 2015 |title=Wales Unchained: Literature, politics and identity in the American century |page=76 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=978-1783162147 |url={{google books |plain-url=y |id=378mDAAAQBAJ|page=76}} }}</ref>

====Australia and New Zealand====
In October&nbsp;1960, Robeson embarked on a two-month concert tour of Australia and New Zealand with Essie, primarily to generate money,{{sfn|Duberman|1989|pp=487–491}} at the behest of Australian politician [[Bill Morrow (Australian politician)|Bill Morrow]].{{sfn|Curthoys|2010|p= 171}} While in Sydney, he became the first major artist to perform at the construction site of the future [[Sydney Opera House]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/intothemusic/paul-robeson/4691690 |title=Paul Robeson: The singer who fought for justice and paid with his life |last=Steinke |first=Nicole |access-date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> After appearing at the [[Brisbane Festival Hall]], they went to Auckland where Robeson reaffirmed his support of [[Marxism-Leninism]],{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p=489}} denounced the inequality faced by the [[Māori people|Māori]] and efforts to denigrate their culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Curthoys|2010|p=168}}; {{harvnb|Duberman|1989|p=489}}</ref> Thereabouts, Robeson publicly stated "...&nbsp;the people of the lands of Socialism want peace dearly".<ref>{{harvnb|Robeson|1978a|pp= 470–71}}.<!-- "The People Must, If Necessary, Impose the Peace" -- I'm guessing a pamphlet put out by the Peace Conference which was based in Sydney, Australia. --></ref>

During the tour he was introduced to [[Faith Bandler]] and other activists who aroused the Robesons' concern  for the plight of the [[Australian Aborigines]].<ref>{{harvnb|Curthoys|2010|pp=164, 173–175}}; cf. {{harvnb|Duberman|1989|p=490}}</ref> Robeson subsequently demanded that the Australian government provide the Aborigines citizenship and equal rights.<ref>{{harvnb|Curthoys|2010|pp=175–77}}; cf. {{harvnb|Duberman|1989}}</ref> He attacked the view of the Aborigines as being unsophisticated and uncultured, and declared, "there's no such thing as a ''backward'' human being, there is only a society which says they are backward."<ref>{{harvnb|Duberman|1989}}</ref>

Robeson left Australia as a respected, albeit controversial, figure and his support for Aboriginal rights had a profound effect in Australia over the next decade.<ref>{{harvnb|Curthoys|2010|pp=178–80}}; cf. {{harvnb|Duberman|1989|p=491}}</ref>

===1961–1963: Health breakdown===

Back in London after his Australia and New Zealand tour, Robeson expressed a desire to return to the United States and participate in the [[civil rights movement]], while his wife argued that he would be unsafe there and "unable to make any money" due to 
government harassment. In March 1961 Robeson again traveled to Moscow.{{sfn|Robeson|2001|p=309}}

====Moscow breakdown====
During an uncharacteristically wild party in his Moscow hotel room, Robeson locked himself in his bedroom and attempted suicide by cutting his wrists.{{sfn|Duberman|1989|pp=498–99}} Three days later, under Soviet medical care, he told his son, who had traveled to Moscow at the news, that he felt extreme paranoia, thought that the walls of the room were moving and, overcome by a powerful sense of emptiness and depression, tried to take his own life.{{sfn|Nollen|2010|p=180}}

Paul Jr. has said that his father's health problems stemmed from attempts by the CIA and MI5 to "neutralize" his father.<ref name="Democracy Now">{{cite AV media |medium=radio broadcast |people=(presenter) Amy Goodman |date=July 1, 1999 |title=Did the U.S. Government drug Paul Robeson?

"[E]ven without an organic predisposition and accumulated pressures of government harassment he might have been susceptible to a breakdown."{{sfn|Duberman|1989|pp=498–99}}

====Repeated deterioration in London====
Robeson stayed at the [[Barvikha]] [[Sanatorium]] until September&nbsp;1961, when he left for London. There his depression reemerged, and after another period of recuperation in Moscow, he returned to London.

Three days after arriving back {{when|date=September 2021}}, he became suicidal and suffered a panic attack while passing the [[Embassy of Russia, London|Soviet Embassy]].{{sfn|Duberman|1989|pp=735–36}} He was admitted to the [[Priory Hospital]], where he underwent [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) and was given heavy doses of drugs for nearly two years, with no accompanying psychotherapy.{{sfn|Nollen|2010|pp=180–81}} During his treatment at the Priory, Robeson was being monitored by the British [[MI5]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/07/uk.race |title=Paul Robeson was tracked by MI5 |last=Travis |first=Alan |date=March 6, 2003 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |postscript=;}} cf. {{cite news |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tm_objectid=15246932&method=full&siteid=50082&headline=mi5-tracked-robeson-amid-communist-fears-name_page.html |title=MI5 tracked Robeson amid communist fears}}</ref>

Both British and American intelligence services were well aware of Robeson's suicidal state of mind: An FBI memo described Robeson's debilitated condition, remarking that his "death would be much publicized" and would be used for Communist propaganda, necessitating continued surveillance.{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p=509}} Numerous memos advised that Robeson should be denied a passport renewal, an obstacle that was likely to further jeopardize his recovery process.{{sfn|Duberman|1989|pp=498–499}}

====Treatment in East Germany====
In August&nbsp;1963, disturbed about his treatment, friends and family had Robeson transferred to the Buch Clinic in [[East Berlin]].{{sfn|Nollen|2010|p=182}}<ref name="Lamparski">{{cite book |last=Lamparski |first=Richard |year=1968 |title=Whatever Became of ... ? |volume=II |page=9 |publisher=Ace Books}}</ref> Given psychotherapy and less medication, his physicians found him still "completely without initiative" and they expressed "doubt and anger" about the "high level of [[barbiturates]] and ECT" that had been administered in London. He rapidly improved, though his doctor stressed that "what little is left of Paul's health must be quietly conserved."{{sfn|Duberman|1989|pp=516–18}}

===1963–1976: Retirement===
[[File:Robesonhouse.Philadelphia.JPG|upright|thumb|The [[Paul Robeson House (Philadelphia)|Paul Robeson House]] in Philadelphia (2009)]]
In December 1963, Robeson returned to the United States<ref>{{cite news |last1=Feron |first1=James |title=Robeson Will Return to the U.S. Monday to Retire ... |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/12/20/archives/robeson-will-return-to-us-monday-to-retire-he-stops-our-in-britain.html |access-date=September 14, 2021 |work=The New York Times |pages=10}}</ref> and for the remainder of his life lived mainly in seclusion.{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p=537}}
He momentarily assumed a role in the [[civil rights movement]],<ref name="Democracy Now"/> making a few major public appearances before falling seriously ill during a tour. Double pneumonia and a kidney blockage in 1965 nearly killed him.{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p=537}}

====Invitations to civil rights movement====
Robeson was contacted by both [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[James Farmer]] about the possibility of becoming involved with the mainstream of the Civil Rights Movement.{{sfn|Robeson|2001|p=346}}

Because of Rustin's past anti-Communist stances, Robeson declined to meet with him. Robeson eventually met with Farmer, but because he was asked to denounce Communism and the Soviet Union in order to assume a place in the mainstream, Robeson adamantly declined.{{sfn|Farmer|1985|pp=297–98}}

====Final years====
After Essie, who had been his spokesperson to the media, died in December&nbsp;1965,{{sfn|Duberman|1989|pp=162–63}} Robeson moved in with his son's family in New York City.{{sfn|Robeson|1981|pp=235–37}}<ref name=Lamparski/> He was rarely seen strolling near his Harlem apartment on [[Jumel Terrace Historic District|Jumel Place]], and his son responded to press inquiries that his "father's health does not permit him to perform, or answer questions."<ref name=Lamparski/>
In 1968, he settled at his sister's home in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Bell|1986|p=?}}<ref name=Lamparski/>

Numerous celebrations were held in honor of Robeson over the next several years, including at public arenas that had previously shunned him, but he saw few visitors aside from close friends and gave few statements apart from messages to support current civil rights and international movements, feeling that his record "spoke for itself".{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p=516}}

At a Carnegie Hall tribute to mark his 75th birthday in 1973, he was unable to attend, but a taped message from him was played that said: "Though I have not been able to be active for several years, I want you to know that I am the same Paul, dedicated as ever to the worldwide cause of humanity for freedom, peace and brotherhood."{{sfn|Nollen|2010|p=186}}

Biographer [[Martin Duberman]] said of news media notices upon Robeson's death:<blockquote>the "white <nowiki>[American]</nowiki> press ... ignored the continuing inability of white America to tolerate a black maverick who refused to bend, ... downplayed the racist component central to his persecution" <nowiki>[during his life, as they] "gingerly" [paid him]</nowiki> "respect and tipped their hat to him as a ‘great American’," while the black American press, "which had never, overall, been as hostile to Robeson" <nowiki>[as the white American press had,]</nowiki> opined that his life "&nbsp;‘...&nbsp;would always be a challenge to white and Black America.’"{{sfn|Duberman|1989|p=549}}</blockquote>
