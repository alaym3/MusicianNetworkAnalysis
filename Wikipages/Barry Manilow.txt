==Career==

===1960s===
In 1964, Manilow met Bro Herrod, a CBS director, who asked him to [[arrangement|arrange]] some songs for a musical adaptation of the [[melodrama]] ''The Drunkard''. Instead, Manilow wrote an entire original [[full score|score]].<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=Music Theatre International |title=The Drunkard |url=http://www.mtishows.com/show_history.asp?ID=000033 |access-date= March 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313055107/http://www.mtishows.com/show_history.asp?ID=000033 |archive-date=March 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> Herrod used Manilow's composition in the [[Off Broadway]] musical, which had an eight-year run at New York's 13th Street Theatre.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher= SouthCoastToday.com |title= A spirited musical: Clap, hiss and sing along as MAC stages historical temperance play scored by a young Barry Manilow |url= http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/07-06/07-27-06/02coastin.htm |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120909172238/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/07-06/07-27-06/02coastin.htm#!topic/alt.fan.barry-manilow/TS42l63Jyx0 |date= July 27, 2006 |location= New Bedford, Massachusetts |archive-date= September 9, 2012 |access-date= May 31, 2017 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Manilow then earned money by working as a pianist, producer and arranger.

During this time, he began work as a commercial [[jingle]] writer and singer, which continued through the remainder of the 1960s. Many of the TV jingles he composed he would also perform, including [[State Farm Insurance]] ("Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there") or [[Band-Aid]] ("I am stuck on Band-Aid, 'cause Band-Aid's stuck on me!"), for which he adopted a childlike voice and wrote the music (Donald B Wood wrote the lyrics). His singing-only credits include commercials for [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Pepsi]] ("all across the nation, it's the Pepsi generation"), [[McDonald's]] ("you deserve a break today"), and [[Dr Pepper]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Manilow |first= Barry |title= Barry Manilow letter to press regarding his jingle credits |work= [[Reno Gazette-Journal]]|location=Reno, Nevada|page=75|date=April 11, 1980 |access-date= September 11, 2017| url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/145418784/ |via=Newspapers.com|quote=I am about to give you a break down of which commercials I did what to.&nbsp;...

When accepting the award, he stated that he learned the most about making pop music by working for three or four years as a writer in the jingle industry.<ref name="adweek.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/clio-video-barry-manilow-99308/|title=CLIO Video: Barry Manilow}}</ref>

By 1967, Manilow was the musical director for the [[WCBS-TV]] series ''Callback'', which premiered on January 27, 1968. He next conducted and arranged for [[Ed Sullivan]]'s production company, arranging a new theme for ''The Late Show'', while writing, producing, and singing his radio and television jingles. At the same time, he and Jeanne Lucas performed as a duo for a two-season run at [[Julius Monk]]'s Upstairs at the Downstairs club in New York.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://phillipsphiles.blogspot.com/2008/05/scooter-talk-blog-manilow-flashback-mid.html |title= Barry Manilow Keeps Flying High Critics?

By 1969, Manilow was signed by Columbia/CBS Music vice-president and recording artist, [[Tony Orlando]], who went on to co-write with and produce Manilow and a group of studio musicians under the name "Featherbed" on the Columbia Pictures' newly acquired [[Bell Records]] label."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-tony-orlando-knock-three-times-arcada-theatre-20150723-story.html|title=Tony Orlando still hasn't needed that backup career option, despite his mother's advice|first=Steve|last=Knopper}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/02/15/knock-3-times-if-you-want-tony-orlando/|title=Knock 3 times if you want Tony Orlando|date=February 16, 2012}}</ref><ref name="45cat.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/nc470817us|title=Featherbed Featuring Barry Manilow{{Snd}} Could It Be Magic}}</ref><ref name="discogs.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Featherbed-Featuring-Barry-Manilow-Could-It-Be-Magic/release/9576277|title=Featherbed Featuring Barry Manilow{{Snd}} Could It Be Magic|website=Discogs}}</ref>

===1970s===
Manilow recorded and accompanied artists on the piano for auditions and performances in the first two years of the 1970s. He recorded four tracks as Featherbed, produced by Tony Orlando on Bell Records. Three of the tracks: "Morning", a ballad; "Amy", a psychedelic-influenced pop song; and an early, uptempo version of his own composition with Orlando as co-writer, "[[Could It Be Magic]]".<ref name="45cat.com"/><ref name="discogs.com"/> A fourth tune recorded was "Rosalie Rosie", which was to be the flip side of "Could It Be Magic", but Bell Records went with "Morning" as the flip for Featherbed's second release instead.  Neither of two singles released impacted on the charts.

[[Bette Midler]] saw Manilow's act in 1971 and chose the young musician as her pianist at the [[Continental Baths]] in New York City that year, and subsequently as a producer on both her debut and second record albums ''[[The Divine Miss M]]'' (1972) and ''[[Bette Midler (album)|Bette Midler]]'' (1973).<ref>[http://www.dilettantepress.com/barrymanilowstory.html Barry Manilow] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060629055803/http://www.dilettantepress.com/barrymanilowstory.html |date= June 29, 2006 }}</ref> He also acted as her musical director on the tour mounted for her first album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.betteontheboards.com/boards/tour-02.htm |title=Bette Midler: The Divine Miss M Tour (1972–73) |publisher= Betteontheboards.com |access-date= December 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101108215746/http://www.betteontheboards.com/boards/tour-02.htm |archive-date= November 8, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> In 1973, Manilow was nominated for the Album Of The Year Grammy Award for his production role on 'The Divine Miss M'.<ref name="grammy.com1">{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/barry-manilow|title=Barry Manilow|date=November 28, 2017}}</ref>  Manilow worked with Midler from 1971 to 1975.

After the Featherbed singles failed to impact on the music charts, in July 1973, Bell Records released the album, ''[[Barry Manilow (1973 album)|Barry Manilow]]'', which offered an [[Eclecticism in music|eclectic]] mix of piano-driven pop and guitar-driven rock music, including a song called "I Am Your Child", which Manilow had composed with Marty Panzer for the 1972 Vietnam War drama ''Parades''.

Among other songs on the album were [[Jon Hendricks]]' [[vocalese]] jazz standard "Cloudburst", most successfully recorded by his group [[Lambert, Hendricks and Ross]] in 1959, and a slower-tempo version of "Could It Be Magic". The latter's music was based on [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s "Prelude in C Minor, Opus 28, Number 20", and provided [[Donna Summer]] with one of her first hits. (It was also covered by [[Take That]] in the 1990s, as an up-beat disco version of the song. Take That have since performed Manilow's original version in their [[Beautiful World (Take That album)|Beautiful World]] Tour.)

In 1974, [[Clive Davis]] became temporary president of Bell with the goal of revitalizing Columbia Pictures's music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels ([[Colpix Records|Colpix]], [[Colgems Records|Colgems]], and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures' new record division, [[Arista Records|Arista]],<ref>{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQkEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22the+new+record+company%22%2B+arista&pg=PT25 |title=Billboard |date=November 23, 1974 |access-date=August 24, 2012}}</ref> in November 1974, with Davis himself owning 20% of the new venture.  Bell had its final number 1 hit in January 1975 with Manilow's breakthrough 1974 release of the single "[[Mandy (English and Kerr song)|Mandy]]" (Bell 45,613), followed shortly by the label's final hit, as well as its final single, "Look in My Eyes Pretty Woman" by [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]] (Bell 45,620—US #11) after which the more successful Bell albums were reissued on Arista. The final releases utilizing the Bell imprint have the designation "Bell Records, Distributed by Arista Records, 1776 Broadway, New York, New York 10019" around the rim of the label.

Davis' reorganization efforts continued to bear fruit in 1974, with the release of Manilow's second album, ''[[Barry Manilow II]]'', with "Mandy" as the lead single.  Manilow had not wanted to record the song, which had originally been titled "Brandy" when originally recorded by its co-writer [[Scott English]], but the song was included at the insistence of Davis. The title was changed to "Mandy" during the actual recording session on August 20, 1974, due to the fact that there had already been a song called "[[Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)]]" performed by [[Looking Glass (band)|Looking Glass]] and released in 1972 on Davis' Epic label.

"Mandy" was the start of a string of hit singles and albums that lasted through the early 1980s, coming from the multi-platinum and multi-hit albums ''[[Tryin' to Get the Feeling]]'', ''[[This One's for You (Barry Manilow album)|This One's for You]]'', ''[[Even Now (Barry Manilow album)|Even Now]]'', and ''[[One Voice (Barry Manilow album)|One Voice]]''. Following the success of ''Barry Manilow II'', the first Bell Records album was remixed and reissued on Arista Records as ''Barry Manilow I''. When Manilow went on his first tour, he included in his show what he called "A V.S.M.", or "A Very Strange Medley", a sampling of some of the commercial jingles that he had written, composed, and/or sung in the 1960s. The medley appeared later on his triple-platinum 1977 album [[Barry Manilow Live]].<ref name="telegraph-31Aug2018">{{cite news |title= Barry Manilow: his 10 best songs |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/barry-manilow-10-best-songs/strange-medley-vsm/ |access-date= January 5, 2018 |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date= August 31, 2018}}</ref>

Beginning with Manilow's March 22, 1975, appearance on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' to promote the second album, a productive friendship with [[Dick Clark]] started.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/american-bandstand/barry-manilow---minnie-riperton/episode/177909/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;23 TV.com ''American Bandstand'' with Barry Manilow/Minnie Riperton on March 22, 1975].

Despite being a songwriter in his own right, several of Manilow's commercial successes were songs written by others. In addition to "Mandy", other hits that he did not write or compose include "Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again" (by David Pomeranz), "[[Weekend in New England]]" (by [[Randy Edelman]]), "Ships" (by [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]]), "[[Looks Like We Made It]]" (by Richard Kerr and Will Jennings), "[[Can't Smile Without You]]" and "[[Ready to Take a Chance Again]]" (by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] and [[Norman Gimbel]]). His number 1 hit "[[I Write the Songs]]" was composed by [[Bruce Johnston]] of [[The Beach Boys]]. According to album liner notes, Manilow did, however, perform co-production as well as arrangement duties on all the above tracks along with [[Ron Dante]], most famous for his vocals on records by [[The Archies]].

Manilow's breakthrough in Britain came with the release of ''Even Now'', the first of many top-20 albums on that side of the Atlantic, which contained four singles that became major hits in the US. This was quickly followed by ''Manilow Magic{{Snd}} The Best Of Barry Manilow'', also known as ''[[Greatest Hits (Barry Manilow album)|Greatest Hits]]''. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired four variety television specials starring Manilow, who served as an executive producer. ''The Barry Manilow Special'' with [[Penny Marshall]] as his guest premiered on March 2, 1977, to an audience of 37 million. The special was nominated for four Emmys and won in the category of "Outstanding Comedy-Variety or Music Special."<ref name="emmys.org">{{cite web |url= http://www.emmys.org/awards/2006pt/history.php |title=Archived copy |access-date= November 21, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061030003629/http://www.emmys.org/awards/2006pt/history.php |archive-date= October 30, 2006 }}</ref> ''The Second Barry Manilow Special'' in 1978, with [[Ray Charles]] as his guest, was also nominated for four Emmys.<ref name="emmys.org"/>

He scored a top ten hit of his own, in the fall of 1979, with the song "Ships" (written and composed by Ian Hunter, former lead singer of [[Mott the Hoople]]) from the album ''[[One Voice (Barry Manilow album)|One Voice]]''.

===1980s===
The 1980s saw Manilow top the Adult Contemporary radio charts with songs such as "The Old Songs", "Somewhere Down the Road", "Read 'Em and Weep" (written by [[Jim Steinman]]), and a remake of the 1941 [[Jule Styne]] and [[Frank Loesser]] standard "[[I Don't Want to Walk Without You]]". Manilow's songs continued to receive frequent radio airplay throughout the decade. In the UK, Manilow performed five sold-out concerts at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. In the United States, at [[Radio City Music Hall]], his 1984 10-night run set a box-office sales record of nearly $2 million, making him the top draw in the 52-year history of the venue.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED6178C63C46C20&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM People], ''The Dallas Morning News'', November 3, 1984</ref> In 1980, Manilow's ''One Voice'' special, with Dionne Warwick as his guest, was nominated for an Emmy for "Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction".<ref name="emmys.org"/>

Also in 1980, a concert from Manilow's sold-out shows at England's [[Wembley Arena]] was broadcast while he was on a world tour. Manilow released the self-titled ''[[Barry (album)|Barry]]'' (1980), which was his first album to not reach the top ten in the United States, stopping at number 15. The album contained the top 10 hit "[[I Made It Through the Rain]]" (originally a minor hit for its writer, [[Gerard Kenny]]) and "Bermuda Triangle". The album ''[[If I Should Love Again]]'' followed in 1981, with two top 40 recordings that both hit number 1 on the AC chart{{Snd}} "The Old Songs" and "Somewhere Down The Road" and a third single that became a hit in the UK{{Snd}} a cover of the 1965 Four Seasons smash "Let's Hang On". This was the first of his own albums that Manilow produced without Ron Dante, who had co-produced all the previous albums. Manilow's sold-out concert at the [[Pittsburgh Civic Arena]] in [[Pittsburgh]] aired nationally on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], and locally on [[Philadelphia]]'s now-defunct [[Prism (TV channel)|PRISM]]. In 1982, a concert from his sold out [[Royal Albert Hall]] show was broadcast in England. The live album and video ''[[Barry Live in Britain]]'' also came from his Royal Albert Hall shows.

On August 27, 1983, Manilow performed a landmark open-air concert at [[Blenheim Palace]] in Britain, an event that he told the audience was "one of the most exciting nights" in his life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXAfARsZPLw |title=Barry Manilow, live in...<!--Title incomplete due to video removal--> |website=YouTube |access-date=April 28, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019183230/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXAfARsZPLw |archive-date=October 19, 2015}}{{Cbignore}}</ref> It was the first such event ever held at that venue and was attended by an estimated 40,000 people. This concert was also taped for airing on Showtime. In December 1983, Manilow was reported to have endowed the music departments at six major universities in the United States and Canada.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB296BB4BAE61D7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Newsmakers], ''The Philadelphia Inquirer''.

''The Valley Independent''. December 1, 1983</ref>

In 1984, Manilow released ''[[2:00 AM Paradise Cafe]]'', a [[jazz]]/[[blues]] collection of original barroom tunes recorded in one live take in the studio. That same year, Showtime aired a documentary of Manilow recording the album with a number of jazz legends including [[Sarah Vaughan]] and [[Mel Tormé]]. In 1984 and 1985, England aired two one-hour concert specials from his [[National Exhibition Centre]] (NEC) concerts. In 1985, Manilow left Arista Records for RCA Records, where he released the pop album ''[[Manilow (album)|Manilow]]'', and began a phase of international music, as he performed songs and duets in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. The ''Manilow'' album was a complete about-face from the ''Paradise Cafe'' album, containing a number of uptempo tracks that featured synthesizers. In 1985, Japan aired a Manilow concert special where he played "[[Sakura (folk song)|Sakura]]" on the [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]].

In his only lead acting role, he portrayed Tony Starr in the 1985 CBS film ''[[Copacabana (1985 film)|Copacabana]]'', which was based on his 1978 hit song "Copacabana", alongside [[Annette O'Toole]] as Lola Lamarr and [[Joseph Bologna]] as Rico. Manilow penned all the songs for the movie, with lyrics provided by his longtime collaborators [[Bruce Sussman]] and [[Jack Feldman (songwriter)|Jack Feldman]]. A soundtrack album for the TV film, ''[[Copacabana: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Album]]'', was released on RCA Records.

In October 1986, Manilow, along with Bruce Sussman, Tom Scott, and [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charlie Fox]], went to Washington, D.C. for two days of meetings with legislators, including lunch with then Senator [[Al Gore]] (D-TN).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050327224127/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_v18/ai_4539828/pg_4 The longest shot; measuring Al Gore Jr. for the White House – Albert Gore Jr], ''Washington Monthly'', November 1986</ref> They were there to lobby against a copyright bill put forward by local television broadcasters that would mandate songwriter-producer source licensing of theme and [[incidental music]] on syndicated television show reruns and would disallow use of the blanket license then in effect. The songwriters said without the blanket license, artists would have to negotiate up front with producers individually, without knowing if a series would be a success. The license now pays according to a per-use formula. Manilow said that such a bill would act as a precedent for broadcasters to get rid of the blanket license entirely.<ref>[http://phillipsphiles.blogspot.com/2008/05/scooter-talk-blog-manilow-flashback_3679.html Manilow: Bill Would Spell Disaster – Star Reacts To Source Licensing Moves], ''Billboard'', October 11, 1986</ref>

The following year, [[McGraw-Hill]] published Manilow's autobiography, ''Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise'', which took three years to complete. While promoting the work, Manilow defended his music in a telephone interview: "I live in laid-back L.A., but in my heart, I'm an energetic New Yorker and that's what has always come out of my music. I've always been surprised when the critics said I made [[Middle of the road (music)|wimpy little ballads]]."<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB36D99B1F9D036&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Barry Manilow swings on album – and at critics], ''Chicago Sun-Times'', November 29, 1987</ref> Manilow returned to Arista Records in 1987 with the release of ''[[Swing Street]]''. The album, a mixture of traditional after-dark and techno jazz, contained "Brooklyn Blues", an autobiographical song for Manilow, and "Hey Mambo", an uptempo Latin style duet with [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole]], produced with the help of [[Emilio Estefan, Jr.]], founder of [[Miami Sound Machine]].

CBS aired Manilow's ''Big Fun on Swing Street'' special in March 1988. It featured songs and special guests from his ''Swing Street'' and ''2:00 AM Paradise Cafe'' albums, including Kid Creole and the Coconuts, [[Phyllis Hyman]], [[Stanley Clarke]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], and Uncle Festive, a band within Manilow's band at the time. The special was nominated for two Emmys in technical categories, and won in the category of "Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music program".<ref name="emmys.org"/>

In 1988, Manilow performed "Please Don't Be Scared" and "Mandy/Could It Be Magic" at ''[[That's What Friends Are For]]: AIDS Concert '88'', a benefit concert for the Warwick Foundation headed by Dionne Warwick and shown on Showtime a few years later. In the 1988 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] animated feature ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', Bette Midler's character sang a new Manilow composition called "[[Perfect Isn't Easy]]". The 1989 release of ''[[Barry Manilow (1989 album)|Barry Manilow]]'', which contained "Please Don't Be Scared", "Keep Each Other Warm", and "The One That Got Away", ended Manilow's streak of albums of original self-written material (he only wrote or arranged two of the album's songs) and began a phase of his recording career consisting of covers and compilations.

From April 18 to June 10, 1989, Manilow put on a show called ''Barry Manilow at the Gershwin'', making 44 appearances<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4541|title=Internet Broadway Database|publisher=Ibdb.com|access-date=December 3, 2010}}</ref> at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] (also known as the Uris Theatre), where he had also recorded ''Barry Manilow Live'' in 1976. A best-selling 90-minute video of the same show was released the following year as ''Barry Manilow Live On Broadway''. The Showtime one-hour special ''Barry Manilow SRO on Broadway'' consisted of edited highlights from this video. Manilow followed this set of shows with a world tour of the Broadway show.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===1990s===
Manilow released a number of cover tunes during the 1990s, starting with tracks on the 1989 release ''Barry Manilow'', and continuing with his 1990 Christmas LP ''[[Because It's Christmas]]''. On the Christmas album, Manilow was joined by pop girl trio [[Exposé (group)|Exposé]] and together they recreated, note for note, a 1943 million-selling recording of "[[Jingle Bells]]" by [[Bing Crosby]] and [[The Andrews Sisters]]. Manilow has credited Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne Andrews as inspiring him, perhaps most evident in his recording of "Jump, Shout Boogie".<ref>Sforza, John: "Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story;" University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages.</ref> Consequent "event" albums followed, including: ''[[Showstoppers]]'', a collection of Broadway songs (1991), ''[[Singin' with the Big Bands]]'' (1994) and a late 1970s collection ''[[Summer of '78]]'' (1996), which included the hit "I Go Crazy", formerly a hit for Paul Davis in 1978. The decade ended with Manilow recording a tribute to Frank Sinatra ''[[Manilow Sings Sinatra]]'' (1998) released months after Sinatra's death.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In 1990, Japan aired ''[[National (brand)|National]] Eolia Special: Barry Manilow On Broadway'' where he sang the title song "Eolia", which was used as a song there in a commercial for an [[Air conditioning|air conditioner]] company of the same name, as well as other songs from his 1989–1990 ''Live on Broadway'' tour. In the early 1990s, Manilow signed on with [[Don Bluth]] to compose the songs with lyricists [[Jack Feldman (lyricist)|Jack Feldman]] and [[Bruce Sussman]] for three animated films. He co-wrote the Broadway-style musical scores for ''[[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Pebble and the Penguin]]'' (1995). The third film, entitled ''Rapunzel'', was shelved after the poor performance of ''The Pebble and the Penguin''. Manilow was also to be cast as the voice of a cricket. Manilow also composed the score and wrote two songs with Bruce Sussman for ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs#Let's Go to the Circus (April 19, 1994)|Disney Sing Along Songs: Let's Go To The Circus]]''.

Manilow produced the 1991 album ''With My Lover Beside Me'' by legendary jazz vocalist [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]]. The record is based on lyrics left behind by famed composer [[Johnny Mercer]] that had never been set to music. Manilow was invited in 1993 by Mercer's widow to complete the songs. His own recording of "[[When October Goes]]", with lyrics by Mercer, was released as a single in 1984, from his album ''[[2:00 AM Paradise Cafe]]''. Further Mercer compositions were set to music by Manilow over the following years, culminating in the 1991 Nancy Wilson release. Manilow is featured in a duet on the record in the final cut "Epilogue".

On February 19, 1992, Manilow testified before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration House Committee in support of H.R. 3204, The [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ipmall.info/sites/default/files/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/Audio%20Home%20Recording%20Act%20of%201991,%20Subcomm.%20(Feb.%2019,%201992).pdf|title=Statement of Barry Manilow, Recorder and Songwriter, Hollywood, CA|series=Audio Home Recording Act of 1991 Hearing|publisher=Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], H.R. 3204|via=IPMall.info |date= February 19, 1992|access-date=September 11, 2017|archive-date=September 11, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170911172725/http://www.ipmall.info/sites/default/files/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/Audio%20Home%20Recording%20Act%20of%201991,%20Subcomm.%20%28Feb.%2019,%201992%29.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> The bill was signed into law on October 28, 1992, by President [[George H. W. Bush]] and became effective immediately. In 1993, [[PBS]] aired ''Barry Manilow: The Best of Me'', which was taped at Wembley Arena in England earlier that year. The BBC also played a one-hour version of the same show including "The Best of Me", sung during the concert, as a bonus song or "lucky strike extra" as Manilow says, not seen in ''The Greatest Hits...and then some'', the video release of the show; however, the song was included on the DVD of the same title, with Manilow seated in front of a black curtain, lip-syncing to the recording. He performed 14 concerts as part of an extended tour covering Germany, Austria and Denmark. Manilow branched out in another direction and, with long-time lyricist Bruce Sussman, launched ''[[Copacabana (musical)|Copacabana]]'', a musical play based on previous Manilow-related adaptations. They wrote new songs and it ran for two years on the London West End, and a tour company formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/84488-Manilow-and-Sussman-Control-Harmony-Musical-Again-Is-It-Broadway-Bound |title=Manilow and Sussman Control Harmony Musical Again; Is It Broadway-Bound? |publisher=Playbill.com |date=February 19, 2004 |access-date=December 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228215834/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/84488-Manilow-and-Sussman-Control-Harmony-Musical-Again-Is-It-Broadway-Bound |archive-date=December 28, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

In December 1996, [[A&E Network|A&E]] aired ''Barry Manilow: Live By Request'', the first of his two ''[[Live By Request]]'' appearances. The broadcast was A&E's most successful music program, attracting an estimated 2.4 million viewers. The show was also simulcast on the radio. In March 1997, [[VH-1]] aired ''Barry Manilow: The Summer of '78'', a one-hour special of Manilow solo at the piano being interviewed and playing his greatest hits as well as songs from ''[[Summer of '78]]'', his latest release at the time. In another collaboration between Manilow and Sussman, they co-wrote the musical ''Harmony'', which previewed October 7 to November 23, 1997, at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in [[La Jolla, California]].<ref>[http://www.lajollaplayhouse.com/history/1997.htm La Jolla Playhouse Harmony – 1997], retrieved December 20, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026171757/http://www.lajollaplayhouse.com/history/1997.htm |date=October 26, 2006 }}</ref> Later in 2003, ''Harmony'' was originally scheduled for a tryout run in Philadelphia before going to Broadway, but was canceled after financial difficulties. After a legal battle with Mark Schwartz, the show's producer, Manilow and Sussman in 2005 won back the rights to the musical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.excite.com/celebgossip/pgsixceleb/id/07_22_2005_2.html |title=Excite |publisher=Entertainment.excite.com |access-date=April 28, 2016}}</ref>

In 1998, Manilow released the record album ''Manilow Sings Sinatra'' which earned him a Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award nomination in 1999.<ref name="grammy.com1"/>

On October 23, 1999, [[NBC]] aired the two-hour special ''StarSkates Salute to Barry Manilow'' taped at the [[Mandalay Bay]] Hotel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], featuring numerous [[figure skaters]] performing to Manilow's music. Manilow also performed.

===2000s===
In 2000, Manilow had two specials, ''Manilow Country'' and ''Manilow Live!'', taped over two consecutive days at the [[Tennessee Performing Arts Center]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. On April 11, 2000, [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN) aired the two-hour ''Manilow Country'', which featured country stars [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Neal McCoy]], [[Deana Carter]], [[Jo Dee Messina]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Kevin Sharp (country music)|Kevin Sharp]], [[Lila McCann]], [[Gillian Welch]] and [[Jaci Velasquez]] singing their favorite Manilow hits with a "[[Country music|country]]" twist; Manilow also performed. This special was TNN's first High Definition (HD) broadcast and became one of TNN's highest rated concert specials.

In June 2000, [[DirectTV]] aired the two-hour concert special ''Manilow Live!'' where Manilow had his band, a 30-piece orchestra, and a choir. This [[HDTV]] special documented the concert tour at the time with the greatest hits of his career and was also released to video. Also that year, he worked with [[Monica Mancini]] on her Concord album ''The Dreams of Johnny Mercer'', which included seven songs of Mercer's lyrics set to Manilow's music. Meanwhile, Manilow's record contract with Arista Records was not renewed due to new management. He then got a contract at [[Concord Records]], a jazz-oriented label in California, and started work on the long-anticipated concept album ''[[Here at the Mayflower]]''. The album was another eclectic mix of styles, almost entirely composed and produced by Manilow himself.

While Manilow was at Concord Records, the Barry Manilow Scholarship was awarded for four consecutive years (2002–2005) to the six highest-achieving students to reward excellence in the art and craft of lyric writing. The UCLA Extension course "Writing Lyrics That Succeed and Endure" was taught by long-time Manilow collaborator [[Marty Panzer]], and each student received three additional "master class" advanced sessions as well as a three-hour private, one-on-one session with Panzer. Scholarship recipients were selected by the instructor based on progress made within the course, lyric writing ability, and the instructor's assessment of real potential in the field of songwriting.<ref>[http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/234250 Lyricists Compete for Barry Manilow Scholarship at UCLA Extension], ''Broadcast Music, Inc (BMI)''</ref> In February 2002, Manilow returned to the charts when [[Arista Records|Arista]] released a greatest hits album, ''[[Ultimate Manilow]]''.

The special was filmed in the [[Kodak Theatre]] in Hollywood, California, and was nominated for an Emmy in the category of "Outstanding Music Direction".<ref name="emmys.org"/>

Produced by Manilow, ''[[Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook]]'' was released on September 30, 2003. It was the first time that the pair had worked together in more than twenty years. The album [[Music recording sales certification|went gold]], and they collaborated again in 2005 on ''[[Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook]]''. On December 3, 2003, A&E aired ''A Barry Manilow Christmas: Live by Request'', his second of two concerts for the series. The two-hour special had Manilow taking requests for Christmas songs performed live with a band and an orchestra. Manilow told the audience that he was what [[Clay Aiken]] was going to look like in thirty years, thus acknowledging an ongoing comparison between the two. Also on the special were guests [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[José Feliciano]], and Bette Midler (Midler, busy preparing her own tour in Los Angeles, appeared only in a pre-taped segment).

Then 2004 brought the release of two albums, a live album, ''[[2 Nights Live!]]'' (BMG Strategic Marketing Group, 2004); and ''[[Scores (album)|Scores: Songs from Copacabana & Harmony]]'', an album of Manilow singing songs from his musicals. ''Scores'' was the last of Manilow's creative projects with the Concord label.

During his third appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on September 15, 2004, Winfrey announced that Manilow is one of the most requested guests of all time on her show. On the show, he promoted his ''One Night Live! One Last Time!'' tour. It was around this time period where Manilow appeared for the first time on the mainstream [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] program ''[[American Idol]]'' in which his back-up singer, Debra Byrd, doubles as voice coach on the series. Manilow also appeared on Clay Aiken's TV special, ''A Clay Aiken Christmas''.

Manilow returned to Arista Records under Davis for a new covers album, released January 31, 2006, called ''The Greatest Songs of the Fifties''. Manilow said he was blown away with the idea, which Davis presented when he visited Manilow's Las Vegas show. "When he suggested this idea to me, I slapped my forehead and said, 'Why hasn't anyone thought of this idea?'" Manilow said.<ref>[http://www.etonline.com/music/35975/ Barry Manilow Croons For ET], ''Entertainment Tonight'', January 27, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128203134/http://www.etonline.com/music/35975/ |date=January 28, 2007 }}</ref> It was an unexpected success, debuting at number one in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], marking the first time a Manilow album debuted at the top of the album chart as well as the first time a Manilow album has reached number one in 29 years.

In January 2007, Manilow returned to his hometown of New York City for three shows at [[Madison Square Garden]]. These included showing onscreen Manilow performing in one of his first television appearances, while the "live" Manilow played along onstage.  The same year saw him playing several shows on the east coast of the United States in August. Four more took place in December, half in the NY [[Tri-State Region|tri-state]] area in [[Uniondale, New York|Uniondale]] and [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]], and two in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, and Detroit. Manilow launched another short tour in early 2008, visiting several large venues including the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], Minnesota. A further [[The Greatest Songs of the Seventies|album]] in the decades themed series went on release September 18, 2007.

In January 2013, Manilow returned to Broadway with his concert series "Manilow on Broadway". It was his first appearance on Broadway in more than two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/13988/Manilow-on-Broadway|title=Manilow on Broadway on Broadway{{Snd}} Information, Cast, Crew, Synopsis and Photos|publisher=Playbill Vault|access-date=December 16, 2012}}</ref>

Other destinations included Chicago at the [[United Center]], Los Angeles at the [[Staples Center]], and [[Brooklyn]] at the [[Barclay's Center]] for the tour finale on June 17, where Manilow celebrated his 72nd birthday during his Barclays Center debut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vividseats.com/blog/farewell-barry-manilow-tour-to-launch-in-2015 |title=Farewell Barry Manilow Tour to Launch in 2015 |access-date=November 19, 2014}}</ref>

In 2017, ''Billboard'' Magazine declared that Manilow has been on a ''Billboard'' 200 hot streak since 2002, when his greatest-hits collection ''Ultimate Manilow'' debuted and peaked at No. 3 (February 23, 2002), becoming his highest-charting set (and first top 10) since 1979's ''One Voice'' (No. 9). Since 2002, Manilow has logged a dozen top 40 efforts (including Ultimate). Further, he has notched at least one top 40 album in each of the five decades from the 1970s through the 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7784821/billboard-200-chart-moves-barry-manilow|title=Billboard 200 Chart Moves: Barry Manilow Scores 26th Top 40 Album With 'This Is My Town'}}</ref>

In April 2020, Manilow scored his 36th top-20 Billboard Adult Contemporary chart hit with "When the Good Times Come Again" which peaked at number 12 on the week of July 2. The song was originally recorded for his self-titled 1989 album and never released as a single. A fan made a lyric video for the song when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Barry found the video and posted it on his Facebook page, leading his management company to send the song to radio stations for airplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/features/9401180/barry-manilow-when-the-good-times-come-again-interview|title=Barry Manilow Is As Surprised As You Are By His Pandemic Hit, 'When The Good Times Come Again' |access-date=June 30, 2020}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Manilow married his high-school sweetheart, Susan Deixler, in 1964.<ref name="people.com"/> Manilow later stated that he was in love with his wife and that his passion for a music career, in addition to his lack of maturity, put a strain on their relationship. He left the woman he considered "the perfect wife" after just one year of marriage in pursuit of a "wondrous musical adventure". Manilow credits the response he received from ''[[Playboy]]'' in December 1965 for the courage to leave everything behind and begin a career in music. "I asked a lot of people what I should do, and they all said different things", Manilow said. "Finally, I was so desperate, I wrote to the Playboy Advisor."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Van Matre |first1=Lynn |title=Barry Manilow visits 'Copacabana' again&mdash;this time as an actor |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-06-16-8502080151-story.html |website=chicagotribune.com |publisher=The Chicago Tribune |date=16 June 1985 |access-date=15 December 2018}}</ref> In 1966, Deixler had the marriage annulled.<ref name="Webber">{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/barry-manilow-marries-longtime-manager-garry-kief-201584| title=Barry Manilow Marries Longtime Manager Garry Kief| work = [[Us Weekly]] | date= April 8, 2015| access-date=April 8, 2015| first=Stephanie|last=Webber}}</ref> Manilow stated in 2017 that, despite his later long-term relationship with a man, he had been in love with Deixler and the failure of his marriage was not related to issues of sexual orientation.<ref name="people.com"/>

In 1978, Manilow began a relationship with TV executive Garry Kief, who soon became his manager. The two married in 2014, after [[Same-sex marriage in California|same-sex marriage became legal in California]]. They kept the relationship and his sexual orientation private until the marriage made headlines in 2015. Manilow did not want his personal relationship with Kief to become public.  The media began to publicize the event when a friend of Manilow's, [[Suzanne Somers]], publicly disclosed the private exchange of vows at Manilow's home in Palm Springs. No official paperwork was filed, but it was reported that Manilow and Kief exchanged wedding bands as a sign of their dedication.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/04/garry-c-kief-barry-manilow-husband-gay-manager-age-photos-married-stiletto-twitter-who-is-bio/|title=Garry Kief, Barry Manilow's Husband: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|first=Daniel S.|last=Levine|date=April 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/barry-manilow-secretly-wed-manager-2014-report-article-1.2178211|title=Barry Manilow secretly wed longtime manager Garry Kief last year: report|first1=Kirthana|last1=Ramisetti|first2=Denis|last2=Slattery|work=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=New York City|date=April 12, 2015|access-date=June 15, 2018}}</ref> Manilow officially [[came out]] in April 2017, telling ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' that he had kept his sexual orientation quiet out of concern that it would disappoint his largely female fan base.

==In media==
In 1979, Manilow's musical style was satirized in the song "[[I Need Your Help Barry Manilow]]" performed by [[Ray Stevens]].<ref>[https://people.com/archive/satirist-ray-stevens-turns-barry-manilow-on-his-musical-ear-vol-11-no-21/ Satirist Ray Stevens Turns Barry Manilow on His Musical Ear, People Magazine, May 28, 1979]</ref> The song leads off with a musical phrase resembling the opening of "[[I Write the Songs]]" and also references  "[[Mandy (English and Kerr song)|Mandy]]", "[[Copacabana (song)|Copacabana]]", "[[Can't Smile Without You]]", "[[Weekend in New England]]", "[[Could It Be Magic]]" and "[[Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again]]" in a storyline where the singer details a litany of comedically unfortunate events in his life, reaching the conclusion that he needs Manilow to sing one of his more melancholy and wistful songs to comfort him, as several of Manilow's biggest hits have story lines about suffering and misfortune.

The song reached number 49 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number 11 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. It spent a total of eight weeks on Hot 100 chart and also charted in Great Britain, Canada and Australia. The single's cover art is a spoof of Manilow's album ''[[Barry Manilow II]],'' and the song's album spoofs title and cover art of Manilow's ''[[Tryin' to Get the Feeling]]''.

In 1989, an American tabloid claimed that Manilow was engaged to [[pornographic film actor|porn star]] [[Robin Byrd]]. On a June 22, 1989, appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', Johnny Carson asked Manilow about the headline story.<ref>[http://www.johnnycarson.com/carson/search.do?singleDateMonth=06&singleDateDay=22&singleDateYear=1989 Johnny Carson|The King of Late Night] The Official Tonight Show Website: Guest Search 6/22/89</ref> Manilow replied that he was just friends with Byrd, an innocent picture had been taken, and that there was no truth to the supposed engagement. After he met Byrd, his band gave him a videotape of ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' as a present for his birthday. Manilow told Carson that he could not watch his friend doing what she does in that movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robinbyrdweb.tripod.com/ib_bm.htm |title=Robin Byrd with Barry Manilow|publisher=Robinbyrdweb.tripod.com|access-date=December 3, 2010}}</ref>

To help with the aftermath of [[Hurricane Hugo]] in 1989, which affected the [[Charleston, South Carolina]], area, Manilow held a benefit concert November 12, 1989, at the University of South Carolina's [[Carolina Coliseum]] in Columbia, where the $10 tickets sold out in three hours, and asked concertgoers to bring canned food to be donated to residents in disaster areas.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CO&s_site=charlotte&p_multi=CO&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB6C535A4D2188D&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "Barry Manilow Concert Scheduled Benefit Performance to Raise Money for Hurricane Relief Effort"], ''The Charlotte Observer'', October 9, 1989</ref> Before his concert, Mayor T. Patton Adams named that day "Barry Manilow Day", and Manilow presented [[American Red Cross|the Red Cross]] and the [[Salvation Army]] with checks of $42,500 each.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CS&s_site=thestate&p_multi=CS&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB58FD878E418E3&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "For a Song"], ''The State'', November 13, 1989</ref>

On January 15, 1994, three hours before showtime, Manilow canceled a performance at an Ethnic Pride and Heritage Festival hosted at the [[Atlantic City Convention Center|Convention Center]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Benefactors included the Children's Hospital of New Jersey in Newark, the Community Foundation of New Jersey as well as United Hospitals Medical Center Foundation and [[Newark Museum]] in Newark during the pre-inaugural activities for then [[New Jersey]] Governor-elect [[Christine Todd Whitman|Christie Whitman]]. Manilow said in a statement that he was specifically told in writing that the concert would be part of a non-partisan event.<ref>{{cite news|title=Manilow Passes On Gala|date=January 17, 1994|work=[[Palm Beach Post]]|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/PBPB/lib00161,0EAF86CE9819E992.html}}</ref>

On February 8, 1994, Manilow sued Los Angeles radio station [[KBIG|KBIG (104.3 FM)]], seeking $13 million in damages and $15 million in punitive damages, claiming that one of their advertisements was causing irreparable damage to his professional reputation. The ad, a thirty-second spot which began airing on January 31, suggested that people listen to KBIG because it does not play Manilow's music. The lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior Court by Los Angeles attorney C. Tucker Cheadle.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Volzke|title=Don't Play Barry?

[[Arizona Court of Appeals]] Judge Philip Espinosa sued Manilow over the volume of a December 23, 1993, concert he attended with his wife.<ref>{{cite news|title=People, Places & Things in the News: Barry Manilow |date=March 29, 1997 |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.s-t.com/daily/03-97/03-29-97/zzzwnppl.htm#XINDEX3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970808120656/http://www.s-t.com/daily/03-97/03-29-97/zzzwnppl.htm#XINDEX3 |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 8, 1997 }}</ref> The judge said in a lawsuit he has had a constant ringing in his ears ([[tinnitus]]) and nearly blew his ears out. Espinosa sought unspecified damages, and the trial was set for September 23, 1997. The suit also named Manilow's production company, an Arizona concert promoter and the city of [[Tucson, Arizona]], which runs the [[Tucson Convention Center|convention center]] where the concert was held. In July 1997, to settle the suit it was reported that Manilow donated $5,000 to the [[American Tinnitus Association]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Small Victory Against Loud Music|date=July 12, 1997|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.quiet.org/readings/bites.htm}}</ref>

To help in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, for every US dollar donated by his fans to the [[American Red Cross]] through the Manilow Fund for Health and Hope website, Manilow personally matched, and the fund itself also matched, tripling the original donation. The fund delivered $150,000, raised in 48 hours, to the American Red Cross.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/09-03-2005/0004099775&EDATE= "Manilow Fund Set To Triple Aid For Hurricane Katrina Relief"], ''PRNewswire'', September 3, 2005</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/b/2005/09/03/barry-manilow-and-manilow-fund-matching-donations-for-hurricane-katrina-relief.htm |title=Barry Manilow and Manilow Fund Matching Donations For Hurricane Katrina Relief |publisher=Top40.about.com |date=September 3, 2005 |access-date=December 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629205811/http://top40.about.com/b/2005/09/03/barry-manilow-and-manilow-fund-matching-donations-for-hurricane-katrina-relief.htm |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Manilow made headlines in June 2006 when Australian officials blasted his music from 9pm until midnight every Friday, Saturday and Sunday to deter gangs of youths from congregating in a residential area late at night.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/06/arts.australia|title=Forget Asbos.

On October 27, 2011, Manilow visited [[Joplin, Missouri]], a little more than five months after a [[2011 Joplin tornado|tornado]] destroyed one-third of that city, including its only high school. His "Manilow Music Project" made a contribution of $300,000 to restore the musical program and instruments that were lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2011/10/barry-manilow-saves-the-music-in-joplin-mo/ |title=Barry Manilow Saves the Music in Joplin, Mo. |website=[[ABC News]] |date=October 17, 2011 |access-date=November 11, 2012 }}</ref>
