'''Vulfpeck''' is an American [[funk]] group founded in 2011. The band has released four EPs, six albums, and a silent album on [[Spotify]] titled ''[[Sleepify]]'', royalties from which funded Vulfpeck's admission-free tour in 2014. The band's most recent album, ''The Joy of Music, the Job of Real Estate'', was released in October 2020.

== Background ==

The band members attended [[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance|University of Michigan]]'s music school.<ref name="med-2015" /> They first came together as a [[rhythm section]] for a performance at the [[University of Michigan College of Engineering#Laboratories and facilities|Duderstadt Center]], a university facility that houses an arts library and other resources. After reading an interview with German producer [[Reinhold Mack]], band founder Jack Stratton conceived of Vulfpeck as an imagined German version of the U.S. session musicians of the 1960s such as [[the Funk Brothers]], [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]], and [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section|Muscle Shoals]]. The idea was to channel that era of the live rhythm section.<ref name="vp-jamb2014" /><ref name="vp-mliv2014" /><ref name="vp-tapeop" />

The band's founding members are Jack Stratton on keyboards, drums and guitar, [[Theo Katzman]] on guitar, drums and vocals, Woody Goss on keyboards, and Joe Dart on bass.<ref name="vp-jamb2014" /> Touring partners and frequent collaborators include [[Antwaun Stanley]], [[Joey Dosik]] and [[Cory Wong]].<ref name="vp-msg-jan2019" /> Other contributing musicians include Charles Jones, Christine Hucal, [[David T. Walker]], [[Bernard Purdie]], [[James Gadson]] and [[Blake Mills]].

==History==
=== Early years and ''Sleepify'' ===
The band's first release was titled "Beastly". It was released in April 2011 as a [[YouTube]] video. The track was noted for its bass performance by ''No Treble'', an online magazine for bass players.<ref name="vp-nt-jun2011" /> The band released its first EP, ''Mit Peck'', in December 2011, and a second EP, ''Vollmilch'', in December 2012. In 2013, three band members backed [[Darren Criss]] on his national tour, and Katzman was the musical director of the tour.<ref name="vp-bb-apr4-14" /><ref name="vp-bb2013" /> In 2013, Joe Dart was ranked as ''No Treble'''s 5th-favorite bassist.<ref name="vp-top10-2013" /> Vulfpeck's first live performance was at the [[Blind Pig (venue)|Blind Pig]] in Ann Arbor, Michigan, followed by a performance in New York City at the [[Rockwood Music Hall]] in October 2013.<ref name="vp-mliv2014" /><ref name="vp-nt-nov2013" /> The band released its third EP, ''My First Car'', in August 2013. The EP features [[Antwaun Stanley]] on the band's first vocal track. A review of ''My First Car'' called it less energetic compared to the band's first two EPs but "still a fitting addition to a unique catalogue of music".<ref name="vp-review2013" />

In March 2014, Vulfpeck released ''[[Sleepify]]'', a ten-track silent album on [[Spotify]], in order to raise funds for an admission-free tour. The album generated $20,000 in royalties over a two-month period.<ref name="vp-bb-apr4-14" /><ref name="vp-rs-apr25-14" /> Subsequently Spotify removed the album stating it violated their terms of content.<ref name="vp-bb-apr26-14" /> The band's royalty generation scheme received international press coverage.<ref name="vp-sleepify-mar2014" /> In July the band received the royalties and announced that they would follow through and organize a tour.<ref name="vp-bb-July22-14" />

In August 2014, the band announced the Sleepify Tour and released its fourth EP, ''Fugue State''.<ref name="vp-tour-annc-aug2014" /> The EP's second track "1612" is styled after [[Wardell Quezergue]]'s works and features Antwaun Stanley on vocals.<ref name="vp-nt-1612" /> The song's title was inspired by the entrance code to an [[Airbnb]] Stratton was subletting.<ref name="vp-sirius2016" /> The admission-free Sleepify Tour was scheduled for September 2014. Tour locations included San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Ann Arbor and New York City.<ref name="vp-website-archive" /> In 2015, Stratton proposed a more equitable model for Spotify payout distribution in which each artist's payout is based solely on that artist's listeners, rather than every listener using the service.<ref name="vp-paycalc-mar2015" />

===Studio albums and ''Live at Madison Square Garden''===

Walker, and vocalists [[Coco O.]], Antwaun Stanley, Joey Dosik, Christine Hucal, and Charles Jones.<ref name="vp-jambase-sep2017" />

In September 2019, the band headlined a sold-out concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], one of the first to do so without a manager or record label.<ref name="vp-msg-billboard2019" /> Recording of the performance was released as the band's fifth album ''Live at Madison Square Garden'' in December 2019, along with a full concert film.

The band's production style is modeled after live TV performances of the past, such as ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'', ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', and ''[[Beat-Club]]''. The band aims for a simple and minimal sound where each instrument contributes and does not dominate. Recordings are done live with real instruments, and seldom are different takes cut and mixed. Improvisation is a significant part of song development. The compositions are modeled after unconventional song structures of the past, such as "[[O-o-h Child|Ooh Child]]" with an A and B section where each section provides a lift, and "[[If You Want Me to Stay]]" with a repetitive eight bar progression.<ref name="vp-jamb2014" /><ref name="vp-wupr" /><ref name="vp-clinic-2018" />

== Side projects ==

The tracks feature drummer [[Dana Hall (musician)|Dana Hall]] and bassists Matt Ulery and Joe Fee.<ref name="vp-wg-nov2019" /><ref name="vp-wg-christmas2019" /> In 2020 the Fearless Flyers released a full-length album, titled ''Tailwinds'', featuring a horn section consisting of saxophonists [[Grace Kelly (musician)|Grace Kelly]], Kenni Holmen and Alekos Syropoulos.<ref name="vp-live-april2020" />
