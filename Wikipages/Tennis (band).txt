Their third album, ''[[Ritual in Repeat]]'', was released on Communion in September 2014 to critical acclaim. In a feature on the album, NPR ''[[Fresh Air]]'''s Terry Gross said, "Can you re-invent lively pop from the distant past? ...songwriting team Tennis does just that with their new third album, ''Ritual in Repeat''", while NPR's critic Milo Miles stated, "On ''Ritual in Repeat'', it's like Moore and Riley discover just how much ancient Latin, or in this case extinct pop styles, is their natural language".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/09/15/348688650/for-duo-tennis-pop-is-a-natural-language |title=For Duo Tennis, Pop Is A Natural Language |website=NPR.org |access-date=May 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602205206/http://www.npr.org/2014/09/15/348688650/for-duo-tennis-pop-is-a-natural-language |archive-date=June 2, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Barone left the group in 2015.
