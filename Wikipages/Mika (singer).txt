His debut album ''Life in Cartoon Motion'' has a coming of age theme and deals with his transition from childhood to the present, though he has stated that not all of the songs are autobiographical. His songs often deal with difficult topics. For instance, in "[[Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)]]" the theme of larger women suffering from discrimination is explored. Mika has said that the fact that his mother was a big woman, and that he had seen the prejudices against her, helped him to write the song.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6890000/newsid_6896300/6896323.stm?bw=bb&mp=wm&news=1&nol_storyid=6896323&bbcws=1 |title=Player – Art explosion from Mika |publisher=BBC News |date= 12 July 2007|access-date=9 January 2010}}</ref> In another example of dealing with more difficult subject matter, in the song "Billy Brown", Mika writes about a married man who has a homosexual affair.

He was later awarded the BRIT Award for Best British Breakthrough Artist.

Mika has reportedly written songs for other musicians, saying "I write songs for other people under different names most of the time. I have a little family of three names. One of them has been discovered – it's Alice."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/the-things-they-say-14407_1123774 |title=Mika – The Things They Say 14407 – Contactmusic News |date=26 November 2009 |publisher=Contactmusic.com |access-date=9 January 2010}}</ref>

Early in his career, many questions about Mika's sexual orientation arose, but he declined to label himself. In a September 2009 interview in ''Gay & Night'' Mika commented on his sexuality: "I've never ever labelled myself. But having said that, I've never limited my life, I've never limited who I sleep with ... Call me whatever you want.
