==Star Academy 11==

Amir competed in the 11th season of [[Star Academy Arab World]]. He was the second Moroccan male ever to be accepted on to the show. Ihab won people's hearts from the get go, mainly due to his pride in showcasing the Moroccan dialect with the other candidates. Amir was never named by any of the show's judges for nomination up until the week of his exit when he was finally named a nominee. Amir was nominated only once on the show. During this nomination he was shown to have lost the public vote, which raised allegations that the show tampered with the results. Fans of Amir expressed their outrage through social media 1 January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldakhbar.com/culture-art/celebrity/45711.html|title=خروج المتسابق المغربي إهاب أمير من البرايم ال12 في ستار اكاديمي – اخبار – العالم اليوم|language=ar|trans-title=Moroccan contestant Ihab Amir eliminated from the 12th prime in Star Academy|date=2 January 2016|first1=Khaled |last1=Belkacem |website=www.worldakhbar.com |accessdate=10 October 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310220516/http://www.worldakhbar.com/culture-art/celebrity/45711.html|archivedate=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://arabic.cnn.com/world/2016/01/04/star-academy-moroccan-participant|website=CNN Arabic | title = حالات إغماء وضجة في المطار إبّان استقبال متسابق مغربي أٌقصي من "ستار أكاديمي"|date= 4 January 2016|accessdate=10 October 2016|language=ar|trans-title=Cases of fainting and commotion at the airport during the reception of a Moroccan contestant who was removed from "Star Academy"}}</ref>
