'''Versailles''' (known as '''Versailles Philharmonic Quintet''' in North America) is a Japanese [[visual kei]] [[symphonic power metal]] band formed in 2007 by vocalist [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]] and guitarist [[Hizaki]]. After recruiting bassist [[Jasmine You]], drummer Yuki and guitarist [[Teru (guitarist)|Teru]], they performed their first show on June 23. Their key characteristics are their [[Rococo]]-esque costumes,<ref>{{cite web|title=Tune in Tokyo: Where Jpop and Jrock Rule|publisher=[[LA Weekly]]|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/nightlife-and-events/tune-in-tokyo-where-jpop-and-j/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121208170859/http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/nightlife-and-events/tune-in-tokyo-where-jpop-and-j/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-08|date=2007-08-24|access-date=2010-02-27}}</ref> dueling guitars and heavy but melodic arrangements. The group gained a significant worldwide following soon after forming as their debut EP ''[[Lyrical Sympathy]]'' (2007), released by Kamijo's own label Sherow Artist Society, received a simultaneous European release and they performed in Europe and the United States the following year. Their first full-length album, ''[[Noble (album)|Noble]]'' released in 2008, was also released in North America in 2009.

Versailles signed to major label [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music Japan]] in mid-2009, however, on August 9, days after announcing he would be suspending activities for health reasons, Jasmine You died. Their major debut album ''[[Jubilee (Versailles album)|Jubilee]]'' (2010) was completed with Hizaki performing the unfinished bass tracks. They went on a world tour that took them to Latin America and Europe and ended with new bassist Masashi officially joining. 2011 began with the whole band starring in their own television show titled {{nihongo|''Onegai Kanaete Versailles''|おねがいかなえてヴェルサイユ||lit. "Fulfill My Wish Versailles"}}, that ran from January to March. Their third album ''[[Holy Grail (album)|Holy Grail]]'' (2011) was their highest charting, reaching number 12 on the [[Oricon]], and was supported by their second world tour. On July 20, 2012, Versailles announced they would be stopping all activities at the end of the year. They released their last album, the self-titled ''[[Versailles (album)|Versailles]]'', on September 26 and after a short tour, performed their last concert at [[NHK Hall]] on December 20. The band resumed activities at a concert on December 28, 2015 at Zepp DiverCity in Tokyo.

==History==

===2007: Formation===
[[File:Versailles Chile.jpg|thumb|right|Teru, Kamijo and Hizaki (2010)]]
After moving to [[Tokyo]], [[Hizaki]] received a phone call from [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]] who wanted to form a band with twin guitars and asked him to join.<ref name="JRN1">{{cite web|title=Interview: The origin story of HIZAKI (Versailles/Jupiter) part 1|url=https://jrocknews.com/2020/10/interview-origin-story-of-hizaki-part1.html|website=JRock News|date=October 5, 2020|access-date=December 1, 2020}}</ref> But as he was already playing in a group, the guitarist turned the singer down. Time passed and after Hizaki played support guitar for Kamijo's band [[Lareine]] at their last concert in October 2006, Kamijo again asked Hizaki to form a new band. No longer in a band, Hizaki agreed, planning to continue his solo project at the same time.<ref name="JRN1"/> Kamijo and Hizaki created the concept of Versailles and spent a few months gathering members to express it. Their band concept is "the absolute ''youshikibi'' (beauty of form) sound and extremes of aestheticism."<ref name="Metropolis">{{cite web |author=Grunebaum, Dan |title=Japan Beat: Versailles - Metropolis peers behind the makeup of a fast-emerging visual kei band |publisher=[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]] |url=http://archive.metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/700/music_beat.asp |date=2009-08-09 |access-date=2011-02-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131130200530/http://archive.metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/700/music_beat.asp |archive-date=2013-11-30 }}</ref>

On March 30, 2007 the details of the band were announced. Versailles was formed by Kamijo, Hizaki (ex-Sulfuric Acid), and [[Jasmine You]] (ex-Jakura). Later, [[Teru (guitarist)|Teru]] (ex-[[Aikaryu]]) and Yuki (ex-Sugar Trip), who were recommended by the Rock May Kan venue in Tokyo, joined the band. Hizaki, Jasmine You and Teru previously played together as part of [[Hizaki|Hizaki Grace Project]]. They released promotional material through the internet, set up an English language page on [[MySpace]], and had several interviews with foreign press. Versailles made their first appearance with a showcase on June 23, followed by their first performance on June 24. On these dates they also distributed their first single and [[DVD single]], "[[The Revenant Choir]]".

The band signed with the German [[CLJ Records]] label and released the EP ''[[Lyrical Sympathy]]'' on October 31, both in Japan and Europe.<ref name="lyrical">{{cite web|url=http://www.jame-world.com/uk/news-24289-versailles-mini-album-japan-europe-release.html|title=Versailles mini-album Japan & Europe Release|access-date=2008-07-07|date=2007-09-01|work=JaME World}}</ref> Their song "The Love From A Dead Orchestra" also appeared on a compilation album released by [[Sony BMG]] in Germany on November 9, called ''Tokyo Rock City''.
