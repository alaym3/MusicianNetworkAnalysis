'''Lee Ann Womack''' ({{IPAc-en|'|w|oʊ|m|æ|k}}; born August 19, 1966) is an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and musician.

When Womack emerged as a contemporary country artist in 1997, her material resembled that of [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Tammy Wynette]],<ref name="oldies">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Lee-Ann-Womack.html|title=''Lee Ann Womack Biography''|last=Larkin|first=Collin|website=oldies.com|access-date=November 29, 2008}}</ref> except for the way Womack's music mixed an old-fashioned style with contemporary elements. Her 2000 album ''[[I Hope You Dance (album)|I Hope You Dance]]'' had an entirely different sound, using pop music elements instead of traditional country. It was not until the release of ''[[There's More Where That Came From]]'' in 2005 that Womack returned to recording traditional country music. After a hiatus in 2008, Womack returned in 2014 with a new album (''[[The Way I'm Livin']]'') and a new sound which blended country and [[Americana (music)|Americana]].

Womack has released a total of nine studio albums and two compilations. Four of her studio albums have received a Gold certification or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Additionally, she has received five [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], six [[Country Music Association Awards]], and a [[Grammy Award]]. She has sold over 6 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newson6.com/global/story.asp?s=11870110|title=George Strait, Reba Sell Out BOK Center Show in Less Than An Hour|website=newson6.com|access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref> Womack is married to record producer [[Frank Liddell]], and was previously married to songwriter and musician [[Jason Sellers]]; her daughter with the latter, [[Aubrie Sellers]], is also a country music artist.

==Early life==
Womack was born and raised in [[Jacksonville, Texas]]. At an early age she was interested in country music. Her father, a disc jockey, often took his daughter to work with him to help choose records to play on the air.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lee-ann-womack-mn0000194063/biography|title=Lee Ann Womack biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=May 28, 2017}}</ref> Womack was the second of two daughters. Her mother was a [[schoolteacher]] and her father was also a high school [[principal (school)|principal]]. As a child, Womack studied the piano and later graduated from Jacksonville High School in 1984. After graduating, Womack attended [[South Plains College|South Plains Junior College]] in [[Levelland, Texas]]. The college was one of the first in the nation to offer country music degrees, and soon she became a member of the college band, ''Country Caravan.''<ref name="allmusic"/> A year later, she left the college and after an agreement with her parents, Womack enrolled at [[Belmont University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she studied the commercial aspect of the music business. In Nashville, she interned at the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] department of [[MCA Records]]. She studied at the college until 1990, leaving the school a year before graduation.

Womack spent a few years raising her children before reentering the music business in the mid 1990s. In 1995 she began performing her music in songwriting demos and at showcase concerts. At one of these showcase concerts, she was spotted by Tree Publishing, who signed her after listening to one of her original demo recordings.<ref name="allmusic"/> Womack wrote songs with some popular Nashville songwriters, including [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]] and [[Ricky Skaggs]], who recorded her composition, "I Don't Remember Forgetting" for one of his albums. After divorcing her first husband around that time, Womack decided to pursue a career as a country music artist. She auditioned for MCA chairman, Bruce Hinton, who praised her talents. Shortly afterward, she accepted a contract from MCA's sister record company, [[Decca Nashville]] in 1996.

==Music career==
===Country music stardom: 1997–1999===
Womack released her [[Lee Ann Womack (album)|self-titled debut album]] in May 1997, produced by [[Mark Wright (record producer)|Mark Wright]]. The album consisted of self-penned material as well as songs written by other artists, including [[Mark Chesnutt]], Ricky Skaggs, and [[Sharon White (singer)|Sharon White]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The first single, "[[Never Again, Again]]" made the country charts and playlists by March 1997, which led to the release of the album's second single, "[[The Fool (Lee Ann Womack song)|The Fool]]" shortly afterward. More successful than her first single, "The Fool" reached the Top 5 on the Billboard Country chart that year. That year she won major awards from the country music community; Top New Female Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music Awards, Top Artist of the Year from ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'', and was nominated for the Horizon award by the Country Music Association. Decca Nashville decided to close its doors in 1998, moving Womack to [[MCA Nashville Records]] that year.

In 1998, Womack released her second studio album, ''[[Some Things I Know]]'', which was also produced by Wright.<ref name="oldies"/>
The album's first two singles, "[[A Little Past Little Rock]]" and "[[I'll Think of a Reason Later]]" both went to No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard Country Chart.<ref name="cmt">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/womack_lee_ann/bio.jhtml|title=Lee Ann Womack: Biography|publisher=[[Country Music Television]] (has certain information that allmusic doesn't have)|access-date=November 29, 2008}}</ref> Two additional singles, "(Now You See Me) Now You Don't" and "Don't Tell Me" were released in 1999, and the album was certified Gold by the RIAA soon after.

That year, she also won Favorite Country New Artist from the [[American Music Awards]]. Womack also contributed her vocals to the songs "If You're Ever Down in Dallas" and "The Man Who Made Mama Cry" in collaboration with her ex-husband and musician, [[Jason Sellers]]. The material was promoted through shows through October to November before the birth of Womack's second child in January 1999.<ref name="oldies"/>

===Pop crossover success: 2000–2004===
Womack released her third studio album in 2000 entitled ''[[I Hope You Dance]]'' which met with major success. The [[I Hope You Dance (song)|title track]] (which was released as the lead single), reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard Country chart for five weeks and crossed over to the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming a major crossover Pop hit, reaching No.&nbsp;14. It also peaked at the top spot on the [[adult contemporary]] chart and even reached the UK Singles Charts, peaking at No.&nbsp;40. Both of Womack's daughters appeared in the song's accompanying video. Towards the end of 2000, "I Hope You Dance" won the Country Music Association's "Song of the Year" and "Single of the Year" awards. With the Pop success of "I Hope You Dance," Womack drew the attention of the magazines ''[[People Magazine|People]]'' and ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'', both of which praised the single, calling it "one of her best." The song later won awards in 2001 from the Grammy and Academy of Country music awards. The album of the same name has sold 3 million copies in the United States to date. The album's follow-up single, a cover of [[Rodney Crowell]]'s "Ashes by Now" peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard Country Chart. The third single, "Why They Call it Falling" was also successful, reaching the country Top 15.

On December 11, 2000, Womack performed "I Hope You Dance" at the annual [[Nobel Peace Prize]] concert.

In 2002, Womack's fourth studio album, ''[[Something Worth Leaving Behind]]'' was released. The album made a stronger attempt at a pop-flavored style, however it did not react well, leading to poor record sales and only one major hit. Following its release, Womack's career stalled. Later that year, she released a Christmas album, ''[[The Season for Romance]]'' and also collaborated with [[Willie Nelson]] on his single, "Mendocino County Line," which won a Grammy and Country Music award in 2002. In early 2003, she got a small recurring role on the popular [[CBS]] drama ''[[The District (TV series)|The District]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Womack sang the theme song for the 2003 series ''[[The Berenstain Bears (2003 TV series)|The Berenstain Bears]].''

In 2004, Womack performed "I Hope You Dance" at the [[Republican National Convention]], in which [[George W. Bush]] was nominated for his second term as President of the United States. The other performers that night included [[Sara Evans]] and [[Larry Gatlin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/29/gop.lineup/index.html|title=GOP convention aims at moderates|last=Patterson|first=Thom|publisher=CNN|access-date=November 29, 2008 | date=August 30, 2004}}</ref> She also collaborated with Red Dirt Music band [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] on their hit "Sick and Tired" in 2004.

===''There's More Where That Came From'' and hiatus: 2005–2008===
[[File:Lee Ann Womack Memorial Day 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Womack performing live at the National Memorial Day Concert in Washington, DC, May 28, 2006]]
In 2005, she released her fifth studio album aimed at traditional country music entitled ''[[There's More Where That Came From]].''<ref name="cmt"/>
Many people in the music industry called the album, "a return to tradition," featuring songs about drinking and cheating with a distinctive older country twang, mixing strings and [[steel guitar]]. The album won the Country Music Association's "Album of the Year" award in 2005.<ref name="book">{{cite book|title=''Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Country Music in America|editor=Alanna Nash and Paul Kingsbury|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc|location=New York, NY|year=2006|page=349|chapter=Ch. 12: Pocketful of Gold}}</ref> Womack took inspiration from the records of the 1960s and 1970s, and according to [[Allmusic]], the album sounded like albums by [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Barbara Mandrell]], and [[Dolly Parton]] from the 1970s. They also called it one of her best records.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r726382|pure_url=yes}}|title=''There's More Where That Came From'' album review|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|website=allmusic|access-date=November 29, 2008}}</ref> The lead single, "[[I May Hate Myself in the Morning]]" was a Top 10 hit in 2005, and also won "Single of the Year" by the CMA awards later that year.<ref name="cmt"/> Two additional singles were released from the album in 2005 that became minor hits, "[[He Oughta Know That by Now]]" and "Twenty Years and Two Husbands Ago."

The song had been originally recorded by Rogers and [[Dottie West]] in 1978 and was a No. 1 Country hit that year. Womack took the place of West during that show since West had died in a serious car accident in September 1991. Womack's other honors includes being listed at No.&nbsp;17 on CMT's 2002 special of their countdown of the ''40 Greatest Women of Country Music''.
