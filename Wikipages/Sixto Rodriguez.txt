'''Sixto Diaz Rodriguez''' (born July 10, 1942), known professionally as '''Rodriguez''', is an American singer-songwriter from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Scott|title=Salta a la fama el rockero de origen mexicano Sixto Rodríguez, tras el Oscar a documental sobre él|url=http://suracapulco.mx/espectaculos/salta-a-la-fama-el-rockero-de-origen-mexicano-sixto-rodriguez-tras-el-oscar-a-documental-sobre-el/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160809191953/http://suracapulco.mx/espectaculos/salta-a-la-fama-el-rockero-de-origen-mexicano-sixto-rodriguez-tras-el-oscar-a-documental-sobre-el/|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 9, 2016|access-date=September 7, 2016|agency=El Sur Acapulco|publisher=El Sur Acapulco|date=February 27, 2013}}</ref> Though his career was initially  met with little fanfare in the United States, he found success in South Africa, Australia (touring the country twice), and New Zealand. Unbeknownst to him for decades, his music was extremely successful and influential in [[South Africa]], where he is believed to have sold more records than [[Elvis Presley]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/searching-for-sugar-man-documentary-rediscovers-musician-sixto-rodriguez/2012/07/25/gJQAUS8VBX_story.html|title='Searching for Sugar Man' documentary rediscovers musician Sixto Rodriguez|last=Malitz|first=David|date=July 26, 2012|work=Washington Post|access-date=May 13, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>[[Malik Bendjelloul|Bendjelloul, Malik]], director.

In the 1990s, determined South African fans managed to find and contact Rodriguez, which led to an unexpected revival of his musical career. This was told in the 2012 [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary film ''[[Searching for Sugar Man]]'' and helped give Rodriguez a measure of fame in his home country. In May 2013, Rodriguez received an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degree from his alma mater, [[Wayne State University]], in Detroit.

Rodriguez has been living in Detroit's historic [[Woodbridge, Detroit|Woodbridge]] neighborhood, through which he is seen walking in ''Searching for Sugar Man''. He is known to live a simple life, possessing no telephone or cell phone of his own, and occasionally visiting bars in the [[Cass Corridor]] section of Detroit near Woodbridge and [[Midtown Detroit]], such as the Old Miami pub, where he has performed live concerts for small local crowds.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
[[File:Sixto Rodriguez Way Out West 2013.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Sixto Rodriguez at Way Out West in Gothenburg, Sweden 2013]]Rodriguez was born in 1942 in Detroit, Michigan. He was the sixth child of Mexican immigrant working-class parents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.socialstereotype.com/_/Features/Entries/2008/8/11_RODRIGUEZ.html |title=Rodriguez |publisher=Socialstereotype.com |date=July 10, 1942 |access-date=June 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130616001318/http://www.socialstereotype.com/_/Features/Entries/2008/8/11_RODRIGUEZ.html |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He was named Sixto (pronounced "Seex-toh") because he was their sixth son. His father had emigrated to the [[United States]] from [[Mexico]] in the 1920s; his mother was Native American. They had joined a large influx of Mexicans who came to the midwest to work in Detroit's industries.<ref>Vargas, Zaragosa.

A Decade of Betrayal: Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s. Albuquerque, NM.: University of New Mexico Press, 2006.</ref> In most of his songs, Rodriguez takes a political stance on the difficulties that faced the [[inner city]] poor.

Rodriguez earned a [[Bachelor of Philosophy]] from [[Wayne State University]]'s Monteith College in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honors.wayne.edu/monteith|title=Wayne State University|publisher=Honors.wayne.edu|access-date=September 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031020120/http://www.honors.wayne.edu/monteith/|archive-date=October 31, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Recording career===
In 1967, using the name "Rod Riguez" (given by his record label), he released a single, "I'll Slip Away", on the small Impact label. He did not record again for three years, until he signed with [[Sussex Records]], an offshoot of [[Buddah Records]]. He used his preferred professional name, "Rodriguez", after that. He recorded two albums with Sussex, ''[[Cold Fact]]'' in 1970 and ''[[Coming from Reality]]'' in 1971. However, both sold few copies in the U.S. and he was quickly dropped by Sussex, which itself closed in 1975. At the time he was dropped, he was in the process of recording a third album which has never been released.

Rodriguez quit his music career and in 1976 he purchased a derelict Detroit house in a government auction for $50 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1976}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in which he still lives as of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.sugarman.org/2013/02/02/wife-of-oscar-nominated-searching-for-sugar-man-star-rodriguez-says-hell-stay-in-50-detroit-home-mlive-com/|title=Wife of Oscar-nominated 'Searching for Sugar Man' star Rodriguez says he'll stay in $50 Detroit home - MLive.com|date=February 2, 2013}}</ref> He worked in demolition and production line work, always earning a low income. He remained politically active and motivated to improve the lives of the city's working-class inhabitants and has run unsuccessfully several times for public office: for the [[Detroit City Council]] in 1989, for [[Mayor of Detroit]] in 1981 and 1993 and for the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=220968|title=Rodriguez, Sixto|publisher=Our Campaigns|access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, it was announced that Rodriguez was in discussions with [[Steve Rowland (record producer)|Steve Rowland]], the producer of his ''Coming From Reality'' album. "I've written about thirty new songs," Rodriguez told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. "He told me to send him a couple of tapes, so I'm gonna do that. I certainly want to look him up, because now he's full of ideas."<ref>{{cite web|last=Michaels|first=Sean|title=Rodriguez set to return to studio after 42-year absence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/30/rodriguez-returns-studio-after-42-years|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=January 30, 2013|access-date=January 30, 2013}}</ref>

===Belated fame abroad===
Although Rodriguez remained relatively unknown in his home country, by the mid-1970s his albums were starting to gain significant airplay in [[Australia]], [[Botswana]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

When imported copies of his Sussex albums were sold out, an Australian record label, Blue Goose Music, bought the Australian rights to his recordings. Blue Goose released his two studio albums as well as a compilation album, ''[[Rodriguez at His Best|At His Best]]'', that featured unreleased recordings from 1973 – "Can't Get Away", "I'll Slip Away" (a re-recording of his first single), and "Street Boy".

''At His Best'' went platinum in South Africa, which at one stage was the major disc-press source of his music to the rest of the world. He was compared to contemporaries such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Cat Stevens]]. Some of his songs served as [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-Apartheid]] anthems in South Africa,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/07/28/157478577/rodriguez-forgotten-in-america-exalted-in-africa|title=Rodriguez: Forgotten in America, Exalted in Africa|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=July 28, 2012}}</ref> where his work influenced musicians protesting against the government. Reportedly, anti-apartheid activist [[Steve Biko]] was a Rodriguez fan.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/a-conversation-with-searching-for-sugar-man-director-malik-bendjelloul-8429429.html A conversation with Searching For Sugar Man director, Malik Bendjelloul], ''[[The Independent]]'', December 21, 2012.</ref>

Rodriguez was also successful in Australia and performed two concert tours across the country in 1979 and 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT119 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |title=Rodriguez Is Australian Cult |date=April 7, 1979}}</ref>

In 1991, both of his albums were released on CD in South Africa for the first time, which helped preserve his fame. However, few details of his life were known to his fans and it was rumored that he had killed himself during a concert in the 1970s.

Despite his success abroad, Rodriguez's fame in South Africa had remained unknown to him until 1997 when his eldest daughter came across a website dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,16373,1586094,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The singer who came back from the dead | first=Alexis | last=Petridis | date=October 7, 2005 | access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> After contacting the website and learning of his fame in the country, Rodriguez went on his first South African tour, playing six concerts before thousands of fans. A documentary, ''Dead Men Don't Tour: Rodriguez in South Africa 1998'', was screened on [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] TV in 2001. He also performed in Sweden before returning to South Africa in 2001 and 2005.

In 1998, Rodriguez's signature song, "[[Sugar Man (song)|Sugar Man]]", was covered by the South African rock band [[Just Jinger]] and the Scottish singer-songwriter [[Paolo Nutini]]. In 2002, it was used by disc-jockey [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]] to open his mix album, ''Come Get It I Got It'', gaining Rodriguez more international airplay. "Sugar Man" had previously gained even more fame by having been sampled in the song "You're Da Man" in rapper [[Nas]]'s 2001 album ''[[Stillmatic]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brian Currin |url=http://www.sugarman.org/rod_sample.html |title=Rodriguez – The Music: "...You're Da Man, Sugar Man..." |publisher=Sugarman.org |access-date=June 17, 2013}}</ref>

In April 2007 and 2010, he returned to Australia to play at the [[East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Members Home Book Tickets FAQ's Help |url=http://www.bluesfest.com.au/pages/?ParentPageID=1&PageID=6 |title=East Coast Blues and Roots Festival (Also known as Byron Bay Bluesfest Archive) |publisher=Bluesfest.com.au |access-date=June 17, 2013}}</ref> as well as sell out shows in [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. His song "[[Sugar Man (song)|Sugar Man]]" was featured in the 2006 film ''[[Candy (2006 film)|Candy]]'', starring [[Heath Ledger]]. Singer-songwriter [[Ruarri Joseph]] covered Rodriguez's song "Rich Folks Hoax" for his third studio album. Irish singer-songwriter Darragh O'Dea mentions Rodriguez and references "Inner City Blues" in his 2020 single "Lost Dog Loyal". Rodriguez continues to tour in various countries.

Rodriguez's albums ''Cold Fact'' and ''Coming from Reality'' were re-released by [[Light in the Attic Records]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/106134-rodriguez-coming-from-reality-gets-new-lease-of-life.html |title=Rodriguez 'Coming From Reality' gets new lease of life |access-date=March 17, 2009 |author=Stevenson, Mark |date=March 12, 2009 |publisher=altsounds.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316000020/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/106134-rodriguez-coming-from-reality-gets-new-lease-of-life.html |archive-date=March 16, 2009}}</ref>

In 2014, the French deep house and electro music producer [[The Avener]] released a new version of "Hate Street Dialogue" originally appearing in Rodriguez's album ''Cold Fact''. The new version by The Avener features Rodriguez's vocals. The release charted in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=The+Avener+feat.+Rodriguez&titel=Hate+Street+Dialogue&cat=s|title=lescharts.com - The Avener feat.

In 2012, the [[Sundance Film Festival]] hosted the premiere of the documentary film ''Searching for Sugar Man'', by Swedish director [[Malik Bendjelloul]], detailing the efforts of two South African fans to see if his rumored death was true and, if not, to discover what had become of him. The documentary, produced by Simon Chinn and John Battsek, went on to win the World Cinema Special Jury Prize and the Audience Award, World Cinema Documentary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yuan |first=Jada |url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2012/01/sundance-the-electrifying-search-for-sugar-man.html |title=Sundance: The Electrifying Search For Sugar Man |publisher=Nymag.com |access-date=June 17, 2013}}</ref>

In addition to playing at other film festivals including the [[True/False Film Festival]] and the [[Traverse City Film Festival]], the film opened in New York and Los Angeles on July 27, 2012, before a larger domestic cinematic run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sonyclassics.com/searchingforsugarman/ |title=Searching for Sugar Man &#124;&#124; A Sony Pictures Classics Release |publisher=Sonyclassics.com |access-date=August 29, 2012}}</ref> It was also screened as part of cinema programs in some European music festivals during the summer of 2012, including the [[Way Out West Festival|Way Out West]] festival in August, where Rodriguez also performed.

=== Belated success in the United States ===
Since the cinematic release of ''Searching for Sugar Man'' in 2012, Rodriguez has experienced a flush of media exposure and fan interest in the United States, as well as Europe. He appeared as a musical guest on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on August 14, 2012, performing "Crucify Your Mind", and performed "Can't Get Away" on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on January 11, 2013.

Prominent news coverage has included a mid-August 2012 [[CNN]] feature story with an interview of Rodriguez discussing his life and career resurgence. On October 7, 2012, Rodriguez was featured on the U.S. television news program ''[[60 Minutes]]''.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57526420/rodriguez-the-rock-icon-who-didnt-know-it/ Rodriguez: The Rock Icon Who Didn't Know It], reported by Bob Simon, segment produced by Michael Gavshon, CBS News, October 7, 2012.</ref> On November 18, 2012, Rodriguez was interviewed on the U.K. Sunday morning news program ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'', where he also played a short song over the closing credits. He performed on the BBC2 program ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Holland |first=Jools |title=Rodriguez chats to Jools Holland |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01187hp |website=[[BBC]] }}</ref> on November 16, 2012, and was interviewed by [[Jools Holland|Holland]]. Additionally, he has performed on Internet web series shows such as ''The Weekly Comet''.

The film ''Searching for Sugar Man'' strongly implies that Rodriguez may have been cheated out of royalties over the years, specifically by [[Clarence Avant]]. This matter is still under investigation, and the legal issues are complicated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130517/COL18/305170139|title=Sixto Rodriguez pursues review of contracts, sales in search of royalties - Detroit Free Press - freep.com|date=November 14, 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114013630/http://www.freep.com/article/20130517/COL18/305170139|archive-date=November 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Rodriguez first expressed indifference to these "symbols of success" but has since decided to pursue the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/23/rodriguez-royalties-musician-south-africa_n_2749409.html|title=Rodriguez Seeks Lost Royalties From Albums Sold Overseas While He Lived In Obscurity|date=March 5, 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305084315/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/23/rodriguez-royalties-musician-south-africa_n_2749409.html|archive-date=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In addition to concerts in Australia, South Africa and New Zealand,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/8189463/Sugar-Man-Rodriquez-to-play-Wellington|title=Sugar Man Rodriquez to play Wellington|website=Stuff}}</ref> Rodriguez's tour schedule for 2013 included his most highly attended U.S. concerts to date, such as a stint at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] in New York City in April and a spot at the 2014 [[Sasquatch Music Festival]] at [[The Gorge Amphitheatre]], as well as other concerts in Europe. He played on the Park Stage at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], U.K., in June 2013. On July 5, 2013, Rodriguez opened the [[Montreux Jazz]] festival. On August 10, 2013, he headlined at the Wilderness Festival in the U.K. In 2015, he opened for Brian Wilson's tour with Wilson, Al Jardine and Blondie Chaplin of The Beach Boys.

Rodriguez received additional marketing in 2014 as the [[Dave Matthews Band]] often covered "[[Sugar Man (song)|Sugar Man]]" in their summer tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmbalmanac.com/SongStats.aspx?sid=781|title=Dave Matthews Band 2014 Summer Tour: Sugar Man Stats}}</ref> Matthews would often preface the song with his experience as a fan of Rodriguez growing up in South Africa and his surprise at Rodriguez's lack of popularity in the United States.

=== Recent activity ===
In 2015, Craig Bartholomew Strydom and Stephen "Sugar" Segerman published a book entitled ''Sugar Man: The Life, Death and Resurrection of Sixto Rodriguez''.<ref name="Bdlive2015-11-13" /> A review in ''Business Day'' called the book "probably one of the most unusual rock 'n roll stories out there".

Rodriguez continues to tour the United States and Canada. He headlined a tour in August 2018, ending with a hometown show at Detroit's Garden Theater.

==Personal life==
Rodriguez has three daughters and is separated from his second wife, Konny Koskos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/detroit/index.ssf/2013/01/wife_of_oscar-nominated_search.html|title=Wife of Oscar-nominated 'Searching for Sugar Man' star Rodriguez says he'll stay in $50 Detroit home|date=January 11, 2013}}</ref> His family is heavily involved in his career and he often takes them along on the road.
