===2007–2012: Career beginnings: Tides of Man, Saosin, and Emarosa===

;Tides of Man

{{Main article|Tides of Man}}

In 2007, Pearson formed [[progressive rock]] band [[Tides of Man]] consisting of lead guitarist Spencer Gill, rhythm guitarist Adam Sene, bass guitarist Alan Jaye, and percussionist Josh Gould, at the time. The band recorded their debut full-length studio album titled ''Empire Theory'' throughout September 2008 with producer Matt Malpass and was released through [[Rise Records]] on August 4, 2009.<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Tides+of+Man/Empire+Theory Tides of Man profile], last.fm; accessed March 31, 2015.</ref> They also released their sophomore studio album, ''Dreamhouse'', in 2010. He announced his departure from the band on December 20, 2010 through a message on [[Myspace]]. Since Pearson's departure, Tides of Man has become an [[instrumental]] and [[progressive rock]] band consisting of little-to-no vocal use in their recent material.<ref>[http://propertyofzack.com/post/53409184447/tides-of-man-are-back-band-releases-new "Tides of Man" are back; band released new album], propertyofzack.com; accessed March 31, 2015.</ref>

;Saosin

Following the announcement of Pearson's departure from Tides of Man in December 2010, the singer revealed that he was working on material with American [[post-hardcore]] band [[Saosin]]. The band's members Alex Rodriguez and Beau Burchell reached out to Pearson asking him to record a [[demo recording|demo]] to which he agreed and recorded "Promises". In January 2011, Pearson flew to [[California]] for rehearsals and decided to record more material with Saosin. He was subsequently offered to record vocals for their third studio album, however Pearson was limited to recording with the group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2011/06/tilian-pearson-comments-on-work-with.html|title=Tilian Pearson Comments on Work with Saosin and New Project|first=Sean|last=Reid|website=Alterthepress.com}}</ref> The album with Pearson never came to fruition due to his commitments to touring with [[Emarosa]] and forming his band Archives. Saosin went on to go on an indefinite hiatus, later rejoining with original lead vocalist [[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]].

A few months later I came back and did some writing sessions. Time just stretched and stretched after that. It was a complete maybe for almost two years. They would send me demos every few months. During this span I also toured with Emarosa and did a couple months of writing and recording demos with them. It wasn't until I was doing the music video for “Up In the Air” from my solo project when Saosin told me they were probably going to do something instrumental."
