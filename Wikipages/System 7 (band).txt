'''System 7''' are a UK-based [[electronic dance music]] band. Due to the existence of another band called System Seven they were initially billed as '''777''' in North America. [[System 7]] was also the name of the current version of the [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]] at the time, although this was not the reason for the temporary name change.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

A key early collaborator was DJ [[Alex Paterson]] (of [[the Orb]]), whom Steve and Miquette heard<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/specials/2016-ambient-house-feature/|title=Ambient House: The Story of Chill Out Music, 1988 - 1995 &#124; Red Bull Music Academy Daily|date=20 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220214749/http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/specials/2016-ambient-house-feature/|access-date=28 June 2021|archive-date=20 February 2016}}</ref> playing Hillage's 1979 ambient record ''[[Rainbow Dome Musick]]'' in an [[ambient music|ambient]] DJ set at the London club [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]]. They soon became part of the underground dance scene in London. While Hillage and Giraudy form the core of System 7, it is an extended collaborative project with artists such as [[A Guy Called Gerald]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[Carl Craig]], [[Laurent Garnier]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], Alex Paterson, and [[Martin Glover|Youth]]. System 7 makes extensive use of Hillage's [[electric guitar]]s.

Hillage and Giraudy later launched a [[Chill-out music|chill-out]] and [[downtempo]] sister project called '''Mirror System''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.a-wave.com/mirrorsystem/|title=_MIRRORSYSTEM_|website=A-wave.com}}</ref> and have also worked under the name '''Groovy Intent'''.

The first System 7 album was released on [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]'s 10 Records dance music label, followed by the vinyl-only Derrick May collaboration Altitude (featuring [[Ultra Naté]]). In 1992, System 7 moved to Youth's Butterfly label, releasing four albums, until 1999 when they founded their own label A-Wave for all future releases, also re-releasing their Butterfly catalogue.

In addition to the albums, System 7 have released a number of club singles with notable remixes from, among others, [[Richie Hawtin]] (aka Plastikman),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://acidted.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/ten-techno-classics-6-system-7-alpha-wave-plastikman-acid-house-remix/|title=TEN TECHNO CLASSICS 6: System 7 – Alpha Wave (Plastikman Acid House Remix)|website=Acidted.wordpress.com|date=14 November 2011}}</ref> [[Dubfire]], [[James Holden (producer)|James Holden]], Liquid Soul, and [[Son Kite]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inhale.org.uk/reviews/4914/system-7--out|title=Inhale.org.uk|website=Inhale.org.uk}}</ref>

== System 7 Live ==
=== Early 1990s ===
System 7 were one of the first techno groups to play live, and have developed a live performance approach that is a bit more extreme than their records, with tougher beats and hypnotic live echo loops. The first System 7 live show was in December 1990 at Linford Studios in Battersea, London, consisting of Steve playing guitar and Alex Paterson playing samples and DJing pre-release versions of the upcoming first System 7 and [[The Orb|Orb]] albums. In 1991 there were some more shows and a tour to support the System 7 album release, with Miquette's synthesisers incorporated into the live sound. In 1993 System 7, now playing as a duo, developed a new live technical format and joined [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], The Drum Club, and [[Aphex Twin]] on the Midi Circus tour<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/15/orbital.popandrock|title=Flashback, July 1993|first=Paul|last=Hartnoll|date=14 July 2007|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> of the UK with Megadog<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.megadog.co.uk/|title=MEGADOG-Official Megadog & Club Dog website|website=Megadog.co.uk}}</ref> party crew.

=== Festivals ===
Partly through their extended involvement with Megadog, by 1994 System 7 had become an established live act, in particular playing at many music festivals. In 1995, through his previous association with [[Michael Eavis]], Steve Hillage was asked to oversee the putting together of the first official dance music stage<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el6BHieEKto|title=1995 Glastonbury Dance Stage - Steve Hillage, John Peel and Kiss My Axe|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> at [[Glastonbury Festival]]. In subsequent years System 7 played at Glastonbury a further 15 times, often at the open-air Glade stage,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/history-2000/|title=Glastonbury Festival - 2000|website=Glastonburyfestivals.co.uk}}</ref> a further dance music development at the festival that started in 2000. The crew from the Glastonbury Glade stage created their own spin-off festival, the [[Glade Festival]], starting in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newburytoday.co.uk/News/Article.aspx?articleID=2552|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718123753/http://www.newburytoday.co.uk/News/Article.aspx?articleID=2552|url-status=dead|title=Newbury Today – Glade festival kicks off today|archivedate=18 July 2006}}</ref> with System 7 playing there 5 times.

Other major festivals where they have played include [[Phoenix Festival]], Beach Festival, [[Wickerman Festival|Wickerman]], Willowman, [[World of Music, Arts and Dance|Womad]], [[Sunrise Celebration]], Waveform, [[Whirl-Y-Gig]], [[Guilfest]], and [[Eden Festival]] (UK); [[Printemps de Bourges]], Borealis and [[Les Francofolies de La Rochelle|Francofolies]] (France); Lovefield and Burg Herzberg (Germany); [[Pinkpop Festival|Pink Pop]] and [[Lowlands (festival)|Lowlands]] (Netherlands); [[Dour Festival]] and [[I Love Techno]] (Belgium); Sonica (Italy); Open Air Field (Czech Republic); Odinstown and [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] (Denmark); [[Hultsfred Festival|Hultsfred]] and [[Arvika Festival|Arvika]] (Sweden); [[Konemetsä]] (Finland); Indigo Festival (Israel); [[Ozora]] (Hungary); Reverence Valada and [[Boom Festival]] (Portugal).

Outside of Europe they have played at Juggernaut Festival and the Big Top tour (USA); [[Fuji Rock Festival|Fuji Rock]], [[Summer Sonic Festival|Summersonic]], Star Festival, Amami Eclipse 2009, Hotaka, Asagiri Jam, Nagisa Festival, Solstice Music Festival and the World Festival of Sacred Music (Japan); [[Earthcore]] (Australia); Universo Paralello (Brazil); Tribal Gathering (Panama).

=== Recent shows ===
System 7 co-headlined at Matsuri Digital's Timeless<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tokyoweekender.com/events/matsuri-digital-presents-timeless/|title=Matsuri Timeless - Tokyo Weekender article|website=Tokyoweekender.com}}</ref> event at [[AgeHa]], Tokyo on 14 March 2015, and at the Megadog 30th anniversary event<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djmag.com/content/megadog-returns|title=MEGADOG RETURNS!|date=24 April 2015|website=Djmag.com}}</ref> at Manchester Academy on 21 November 2015. They continue to play their own club shows and at parties and festivals, including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[Ozora]] and [[Boom Festival|Boom]]. They have also been involved in some notable live collaborations with [[The Orb]], Japanese progressive space rock jam band [[Rovo]] (Phoenix Rising),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sonicabuse.com/2014/03/rovo-system-7-live-leamington-spa-assembly-rooms-10032014/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320052910/http://www.sonicabuse.com/2014/03/rovo-system-7-live-leamington-spa-assembly-rooms-10032014/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-03-20|title=Rovo and System 7 live review - Leamington UK March 10th 2014|website=Sonicabuse.com] }}</ref> Japanese rock guitarist and Juno Reactor collaborator [[Sugizo]], leading psy-trance artist Ajja (Novelty Engine), and Merv Pepler of [[Eat Static]] (System Static).

=== Mirror System Live ===
System 7's [[Chill-out music|chill-out]] and [[downtempo]] sister project Mirror System made its live debut on the ID Spiral chill-out stage at the UK Sunrise Celebration festival in 2006, followed closely by a set also with ID Spiral at the Glade Festival of that year. In 2007, ID Spiral opened the [[InSpiral Lounge]] in Camden. London, and Mirror System played at the opening party on 16 December 2007. They became one of the resident artists at the InSpiral Lounge playing there two or three times a year,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/151026|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827142324/https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/151026|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-08-27|title=Mirror System reflector Album Launch Party|website=Resident Advisor] }}</ref> including most of the inSpiral New Year's Eve parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.camdenreview.com/node/987945|title=The best New Year parties &#124; Camden Review|date=20 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320143307/http://www.camdenreview.com/node/987945|access-date=28 June 2021|archive-date=20 March 2017}}</ref> Mirror System live also became popular in Japan, and at European trance festivals where they have been booked as the chill-out stage closing act at Sonica (twice), [[Ozora]] (three times)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ozorianprophet.eu/radiozora/spoken-beats-system-7/|title=Spoken Beats by SYSTEM 7|date=4 January 2017|website=Ozorian Prophet}}</ref> and [[Boom Festival]], where in 2016 they followed their closing set with a full-length live rendition of [[Rainbow Dome Musick]]. With the Reflector DJ mix album (release in 2009) the Mirror System sound expanded to incorporate a soft techno dance groove element, and this element has been further developed in their most recent album, ''N-Port''. This ability to seamlessly move from deep chill to danceable grooves that still retain the chill element, has been an important factor in the Mirror System live approach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dmcworld.net/features/system-7-3/|title=System 7|website=Dmcworld.net|date=28 October 2015}}</ref>

==System 7 in Japan==
Since their first show, at the closing party for Tokyo's On Air club on 4 May 1994 with [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] and [[Alex Paterson]], System 7 have toured in Japan on twenty-eight further occasions. In addition [[Steve Hillage]] went to Japan to play with [[Manuel Göttsching]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://funkyjeff77.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/interview-with-german-legend-manuel-gottsching/|title=Interview with German legend Manuel Göttsching|website=Funkyjeff77.wordpress.com|date=14 September 2011}}</ref> at Metamorphose Festival (2010) and to play with [[Isao Tomita|Tomita]] at Free Dommune<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dommune.com/freedommunezero2013/news/isao-tomita-planet-zero-ensemble-dawn-chorus-feat-steve-hillage-dawn-chorusamazing-dome-powered-by-l/|title=Web article by Dommune about the 2013 Tomita event (in Japanese)|website=Dommune.com}}</ref> Festival in 2013, plus an additional visit to mix the ''Phoenix Rising'' album in February 2013. System 7 have a special relationship with Japan, and have been closely associated with the development of live dance music there. As an extension to this special spiritual connection, System 7 played as the only electronic dance music act at the World Festival of Sacred Music at Itsukujima shrine on [[Itsukushima Shrine|Miyajima]] in 2001, and also offered a ''hōnō'' (dedicatory) performance at Tenkawa-Daibenzaiten-sha (Tenkawa shrine)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wattention.com/tenkawa-shrine-japans-most-seclusive-power-spot/|title=Tenkawa Shrine, Japan's Most Seclusive Power Spot|first=Esra|last=Krabbe|website=Wattention.com|date=3 August 2015}}</ref> in Nara in 2013. In 2006 they were approached by Rumiko Tezuka, the daughter of famed manga pioneer [[Osamu Tezuka]], to see if they were interested in making musical interpretations of her father's ''[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]'' manga graphic novels. Rumiko had first become interested in System 7<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.higher-frequency.com/j_interview/system7/index.htm|title=System7 & Rumiko Tezuka Interview|website=Higher-frequency.com}}</ref> after seeing them perform at the Miyajima festival. This project excited System 7 and it led directly to their album ''Phoenix''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/dndp/|title=BBC - Music - Review of System 7 - Phoenix|first=Sid|last=Smith|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> (released in Japan in 2007), which became their biggest selling album in Japan and also produced their successful Japanese single Hinotori (which means bird of fire). The phoenix theme, with Rumiko Tezuka's endorsement, continued with System 7's album and tour collaboration with Japanese band [[Rovo]], which was titled ''Phoenix Rising'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://getreadytorock.me.uk/blog/2013/08/album-review-rovo-and-system-7-phoenix-rising/|title=Album review: ROVO AND SYSTEM 7 – Phoenix Rising|website=Getreadytorock.me.uk}}</ref> and also featured Rovo's live rock re-interpretation of the track Hinotori. Other System 7 recording and remixing collaborations in Japan have been with Mito (of the group [[Clammbon]]), [[Sugizo]], and [[Joujouka (band)|Joujouka]], the group founded by noted Japanese psychedelic trance DJ [[Tsuyoshi Suzuki]].
