'''Isis''' (sometimes stylized '''ISIS''')  was an American [[post-metal]] band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1997. The band borrowed from and helped to evolve the post-metal sound pioneered by bands such as [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Godflesh]], characterized by lengthy songs focusing on repetition and evolution of structure. Isis's last studio album, ''[[Wavering Radiant]]'', was released on May 5, 2009. Isis disbanded in June 2010, just before the release of [[Melvins / Isis|a split EP]] with the [[Melvins]]. In 2018, the group reformed as '''Celestial''' for a one-off show to pay tribute to [[Caleb Scofield]].

==History==
===Formation, ''Celestial'', and other early releases (1997–2001)===
In Boston, several sessions of experimentation led friends [[Aaron Turner]] (guitar/vocals; also the owner of [[Hydra Head Records]] and its subsidiary, HH Noise Industries), [[Jeff Caxide]] (bass guitar), Chris Mereschuk (electronics/vocals) and [[Aaron Harris (Isis drummer)|Aaron Harris]] (drums) to form Isis in [[autumn]] of 1997.<ref name="ISIS bio">[https://web.archive.org/web/20010215042454/http://hydrahead.com/isis/bio/index.htm ISIS bio]</ref> As Turner stated, "Isis formed as a result of the dissatisfaction with past bands of the founding members. None of us were happy with what we were doing musically at the time, two of us lived together, we had similar tastes and similar record collections."<ref name="feast">{{cite web | url = http://www.feastofhateandfear.com/interviews/isis.html | title = Aaron Turner interview| work = [[Feast of Hate and Fear]] | access-date =June 29, 2011}}</ref> The band began playing out in the spring of 1998, and recorded a demo at Salad Days Studios shortly thereafter.<ref name="ISIS bio"/> After an East Coast tour in the summer of 1998 where they were joined by Randy Larsen of [[Cable (American band)|Cable]] on guitar, Mereschuk left the band. In 1999, [[Michael Gallagher (Isis guitarist)|Michael Gallagher]] (formerly of [[Cast Iron Hike]]) and Jay Randall (now of [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]]) joined the band, working on [[The Red Sea (EP)|''Red Sea'']] (1999). Jay Randall's time with the band was brief, and Isis recruited guitarist/keyboardist [[Bryant Clifford Meyer]] (formerly of [[The Gersch]]) to replace him. After releasing their full-length debut entitled [[Celestial (Isis album)|''Celestial'']] (2000) and its sister EP, ''[[SGNL›05]]'' (2001, on [[Neurot Recordings]]), Isis gained national underground attention in the [[Metal music|metal]]/[[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene through tours with [[Cave In]] and [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]]. Isis remained with this lineup until their dissolution in 2010.<ref name="amgisis" />

For the ''[[SGNL›05]]'' EP, they contacted [[Godflesh]] member [[Justin Broadrick]] through their friends in Neurosis to remix the title track from ''Celestial'', which they used as the EP's closer. Following ''SGNL›05'', the band felt a need to expand its ambit, both artistically and in terms of distributive reach.<ref name="Renaissance Man">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Mike|title=Isis' Aaron Turner: Musical Renaissance Man – Exclusive Interview|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2011/05/13/isis-aaron-turner-musical-renaissance-man-exclusive-intervi/|work=[[Noisecreep]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|access-date=June 29, 2011|date=May 13, 2011}}</ref> The entire band were avid fans of [[Melvins]], so their label – [[Mike Patton]]'s [[Ipecac Recordings]] – was instantly put forward as an ideal candidate. Turner's friend [[James Plotkin]] was already working with Ipecac, so he showed some material to Patton, who, unknown to the band, was already a fan.<ref name="Renaissance Man"/> After discussion, they signed with Ipecac, who went on to issue the band's subsequent studio albums.<ref name="Renaissance Man"/>

===''Oceanic'' (2002–2004)===
Whereas ''Celestial'' was still deeply rooted in [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]], 2002's follow-up, [[Oceanic (Isis album)|''Oceanic'']], saw the band acquire new characteristics comparable to [[post-rock]] and [[ambient music]], significantly aiding in the birth of the genre of [[post-metal]] in what many saw as a logical progression.<ref name="amgoceanic">{{cite web | last =Serba| first =John| url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r605063|pure_url=yes}} | title = Review of ''Oceanic'' | publisher = Rovi Corporation| work= allmusic| access-date =November 25, 2006}}</ref> While much of the material on the album retained the band's former "metallic" intensity, this departure saw the band appeal to a far wider audience; as a result, ''Oceanic'' may be the group's most noted album to date, and is widely considered a turning-point in the history of the band.<ref name="amgisis">{{cite web | last =Downey| first =Ryan J| url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p472173/biography|pure_url=yes}} | title = Isis | publisher = Rovi Corporation|work= allmusic| access-date =December 3, 2006}}</ref><ref name="maelstrom">{{cite web|last=Martinelli |first=Roberto |url=http://maelstrom.nu/ezine/review_iss10_495.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320144959/http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/review_iss10_495.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 20, 2005 |title=Review of ''Oceanic'' |work=Maelstrom Zine |access-date=November 11, 2006 }}</ref><ref name="ipecac">{{cite press release

''[[Oceanic Remixes and Reinterpretations]]'' was released in 2004, featuring reinterpretations of songs from ''Oceanic'' by a number of influential artists requested by the band. Both ''Oceanic'' and ''Oceanic Remixes'' feature vocals by Maria Christopher of the band [[27 (band)|27]]. The album featured another remix by [[Justin Broadrick]], who has supported Isis on tours with his band, [[Jesu (band)|Jesu]], which is signed to [[Hydra Head Records]].

===''Panopticon'' (2004–2006)===
2004 saw the release of Isis' third album, [[Panopticon (album)|''Panopticon'']]. It signified a further progression many had predicted since ''Oceanic'', with a more advanced post-rock feel to the music both structurally and in terms of sound. [[Justin Chancellor]] of [[Tool (band)|Tool]] makes an appearance on the track, "Altered Course". Overall, it was a very well received album, being awarded 'album of the year' accolades from ''[[Rock Sound]]''<ref name="rock sound">{{cite journal|last=Bennet|first=J|title=Review of ''Panopticon''|journal=[[Rock Sound]]|issue=66|date=November 2004}}{{Page needed|date=May 2011}}</ref> and reaching No.&nbsp;47 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]] Top Independent Albums charts; their first entry into any mainstream charts.<ref name=billboard>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=isis|chart=all}}| magazine = [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]| title = Artist Chart History – Isis | access-date =February 19, 2011}}</ref> Before touring the United States, the band performed a free concert at the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]], in a manifestation of the widespread recognition the band had acquired in artistic circles since the release of ''Oceanic''.<ref name="revolver">{{cite journal|last=Epstein |first=Dan |title=The Art of War |journal=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |date=February 2005 |url=http://www.revolvermag.com/features/2005/february/isis/index.html |access-date=April 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101080606/http://www.revolvermag.com/features/2005/february/isis/index.html |archive-date=January 1, 2008 }}</ref> Reacting to the impact of ''Oceanic'' and ''Panopticon'', ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' named Isis the twelfth-heaviest band of all time in December 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The 50 Heaviest Bands Ever|journal=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]| date=December 2004 |issue=31|page=58}}</ref> On July 23, 2006, they performed ''Oceanic'' in full at [[KOKO (venue)|KOKO]] in London as part of [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] Don't Look Back season.<ref name="atp">{{cite web| last = Diver| first = Mike| url = http://drownedinsound.com/news/745247-literally-omg--isis-to-play-oceanic-in-london| title = Literally OMG: Isis to play ''Oceanic'' in London| publisher = [[Drowned in Sound]]| access-date = January 2, 2007| date = April 3, 2006| archive-date = July 11, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100711084654/http://drownedinsound.com/news/745247-literally-omg--isis-to-play-oceanic-in-london| url-status = dead}}</ref>

''[[Clearing the Eye]]'', the band's only DVD, documenting performances over the past five years throughout the world, was released by Ipecac on September 26, 2006.<ref name="The Skinny – Clearing the Eye">{{cite magazine|last=Kerr|first=Dave|title=Just a group of guys, throwing it down|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/37137-isis---clearing-the-eye|magazine=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]|access-date=April 19, 2011|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Also in September 2006, a collaboration with [[Aereogramme]] entitled ''[[In the Fishtank 14]]'' was released as part of a project of Dutch label Konkurrent in which two artists are given two days' studio time to write and record their work.

===''In the Absence of Truth'' (2006–2008)===
[[File:Isis band.jpg|thumb|220x220px|An Isis stage during the tour of Panopticon]]
The band finished recording their fourth full-length album, ''[[In the Absence of Truth]]'', on July 9, 2006. It was released on October 31, 2006, on Ipecac. The record sees the band again evolving in a manner similar to ''Oceanic'' and ''Panopticon'', this time adding new elements of electronics, song structure, drumming complexity, and vocal techniques. It sees the emergence of a more melodic sound than before, and leanings away from previous "drone" inclinations and towards more traditional metal elements, predominantly in the heavier sections.<ref name="rocksoundjuly06">{{cite journal|last=Bennet|first=J.|title=Isis: Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil|journal=[[Rock Sound]]|issue=87|date=August 2006|pages=32–4}}</ref> It was also their most commercially successful release, peaking at  number 6 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Heatseekers]] chart.<ref name="billboard"/>

Isis were the opening act for [[Tool (band)|Tool's]] late 2006 North American tour in support of their new album, ''[[10,000 Days (Tool album)|10,000 Days]]''.<ref name="Tool tour dates">{{cite web|title=Tours: Isis / Tool|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/18552|publisher=Punknews|access-date=April 27, 2011|date=July 10, 2006}}</ref> This led to increased exposure for the band; however, the band members are not particularly comfortable with fame, and tend to keep their affairs private. Turner has stated that "We never imagined that Isis would become as successful or as popular as it has",<ref name="covert">{{cite web | last = D'Andrea| first = Niki| date=February 22, 2007| url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2007-02-22/music/covert-concepts/ | title = Covert Concepts: Inside the intellectual mystery metal of Isis | work = [[Phoenix New Times]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]]| access-date =May 12, 2007}}</ref> and confesses: "[Fans] taking a deeply personal interest in who I am, it fucking freaks me out.

In 2011 Jeff Caxide, Aaron Harris and Bryant Clifford Meyer sought out to continue creating music together and formed [[Palms (band)|Palms]] featuring [[Chino Moreno]] of [[Deftones]] on vocals and guitar.<ref>{{cite web| title = Deftones Frontman Joins Forces With Former Isis Members In Palms| work = [[Blabbermouth.net]]| publisher = [[Roadrunner Records]]| date = April 25, 2012| url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=173069| access-date = March 25, 2013}}</ref> The resulting self-titled debut album was released on June 25, 2013.<ref>{{cite web| last = Hudson| first = Alex| title = Deftones/Isis Spinoff Palms Confirm June Release Date for Self-Titled Debut| work = [[Exclaim!]]| date = February 11, 2013| url = http://exclaim.ca/News/deftonesisis_spinoff_palms_confirm_june_release_date_for_self-titled_debut_album| access-date = March 25, 2013}}</ref>

On June 5, 2013, it was announced that a remastered version of their debut album, ''[[Celestial (Isis album)|Celestial]]'' would be re-issued by [[Ipecac Recordings]] with new artwork from [[Aaron Turner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nefariousrealm.com/homenew/?p=15411 |title=ISIS Reissuing 'Celestial' – Remastered and New Artwork |publisher=[[Nefarious Realm]] |date=June 5, 2013 |access-date=June 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101133357/http://nefariousrealm.com/homenew/?p=15411 |archive-date=November 1, 2013  }}</ref>  This release was followed on April 29, 2014, with a remastered version of the album [[Panopticon (album)|''Panopticon'']], and on November 4, 2014, with a remastered version of the album [[Oceanic (Isis album)|''Oceanic'']], both of which were released by [[Ipecac Recordings]].

In August 2014 Isis changed their name on [[Facebook]] to "Isis the band" in order to avoid any confusion with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Fans Of The 'ISIS' Rock Band Say They Won't Wear Their T-Shirts Anymore|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/rock-band-isis-threats-2014-8|access-date=June 4, 2015|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=August 9, 2015}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
[[File:Aaron Turner, B&W, Guitar — Isis @ Wagenhallen, Stuttgart, 2009-07-09.jpg|200px|[[Aaron Turner]], guitarist and vocalist|right|thumb]]
Turner cites [[Swans (band)|Swans]],  [[Melvins]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Godflesh]], and [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] as influences to Isis' sound, saying "those bands laid the groundwork for us [...] we're part of a recognizable lineage."<ref name="nyt">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/arts/the-alchemy-of-artworld-heavy-metal.html|title=The alchemy of art-world heavy metal|last=Caraminica|first=Jon|date=September 20, 2005|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 20, 2006}}</ref> Early releases were derided as imitative of predecessors Neurosis, and he admits that the comparisons weren't "completely unjustified". However, material since (and including) ''Oceanic'' has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.<ref name="decibel" /><ref name="amgitaot">{{cite web | last = Jurek| first = Thom| url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r855262|pure_url=yes}}| title = ''In the Absence of Truth'' | work = [[allmusic]]| publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]] | access-date =February 8, 2007}}</ref>

In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as [[post-rock]], a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing – the latter of which Turner describes as "guitar theatrics".<ref name="slug">{{cite web | last = Berrett| first = Chuck| url = http://www.slugmag.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=127| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060516141704/http://www.slugmag.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=127| archive-date = May 16, 2006 | title = The Inevitable Evolution of Isis | work = Slugmag| access-date =October 8, 2006}}</ref> However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially [[wikt:halcyon#Adjective|halcyon]] sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars.<ref name="Mojo">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=5803|title=Bark Psychosis: ''Hex''|first=Simon|last=Reynolds|date=March 1994|access-date=2008-07-08|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|quote="...using guitars as facilitators of [[timbre]] and textures rather than [[riff]]s and [[power chord]]s."}}</ref> Isis, however, have origins in [[hardcore punk]] and [[heavy metal music|metal]], and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, [[drone music|drone]], ambient music, and post-rock,<ref name="amgisis" /><ref name="decibel" /> among others. ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' critic Dan Epstein noted that "though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and [[doom-metal]] scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres".<ref name="revolver" /> However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by [[Converge (band)|Converge's]] [[Jacob Bannon]], who has gone on record saying that "if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that – something that ''is''  emotional, powerful music."<ref name="resistance">{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Jim|  title=Resistance is Fertile|journal=[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]|issue=124| date=October 2004 |page=10}}</ref>

Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as "avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases".<ref name="wenns">{{cite web | url = http://www.wennsrockt.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=1 | title = Aaron Turner video interview  | work = wenn's rockt! WebTV| language=de|access-date =August 26, 2006}}</ref> At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels – "'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, [[Shoegazing|shoegazer]] blah blah blah.'"<ref name="decibel" /> When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits "I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag."<ref name="maniac">{{cite journal|last = Birk | first = Nathan T. | title = Isis: A Glorious Burden | journal = Metal Maniacs |date=January 2007 | pages = 8–11}}</ref> Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as "thinking man's metal";<ref name="nyt" /> however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.

Due to the difficulty in [[pigeonholing]], some fans and critics label Isis as [[post-metal]].<ref name="southern" /><ref name="decibel" /><ref name="DiS-bio">{{cite web |title=Isis |url=http://drownedinsound.com/artists/Isis |website=[[Drowned In Sound]] |access-date=August 12, 2019 |archive-date=August 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812162341/http://drownedinsound.com/artists/Isis |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="prog2" /> This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]], [[Cult of Luna]] and [[Callisto (band)|Callisto]]; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of ''Oceanic''.<ref name="ign">{{cite web| last = Thompson| first = Ed| url = http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/747/747458p1.html| title = One thing is true – this album rocks| date = November 22, 2006| work = [[IGN]]| access-date = June 30, 2011| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004755/http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/747/747458p1.html| archive-date = July 13, 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as [[sludge metal]],<ref name="DiS-bio" /> [[progressive metal]],<ref name="prog2">{{cite web |last1=Hartmann |first1=Graham |title=Influential Post-metal Band Isis Mistaken for Terrorist Group |url=https://loudwire.com/isis-band-mistaken-terrorist-group/ |website=[[Loudwire]] |access-date=August 12, 2019 |date=August 25, 2014}}</ref><ref name="prog1">{{cite web |last1=Raymer |first1=Miles |title=Sharp Darts: Liquid Metal |url= https://chicagoreader.com/chicago/liquid-metal/Content?oid=925630 |website=[[Chicago Reader]] |access-date=August 12, 2019 |date=August 9, 2007}}</ref> and even [[metalcore]].<ref name="amgisis" />

Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: "... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others. We've simply done whatever we've wanted to do, and we've all decided to be happy with the results."<ref name="isisguitar">{{cite web|last=Porosky|first=Pamela|title=Aaron Turner and Michael Gallagher interview|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storyCode=78|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013115022/http://guitarplayer.com/article/isis/Jan-05/152|archive-date=October 13, 2007|access-date=September 6, 2006|work=[[Guitar Player]]}}</ref>

== Equipment ==
Circa 2005, both Turner and Gallagher used [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitars with [[Mesa Boogie]] V-Twin [[Preamplifier|preamp]] and a [[Mackie]] [[Audio power amplifier|power amp]].<ref name="isisguitar" />

==Conceptual elements==
Turner has gone on record saying "I like the idea of preserving at least a little shred of mystery and making the band to be more an entity—without hopefully sounding too pretentious – as a work of art [than a traditional rock band]".<ref name="earpollution" />  Turner has also said in an interview in New Zealand music magazine ''[[Rip It Up (magazine)|Rip It Up]]'' that "we don't want to hand-feed everything to the listener. We just want to have a sense of mystery". There is a definite attitude that art and music are interchangeable and synonymous to the band; he feels that "the songwriting and the artwork come from the same place".<ref name="earpollution" /> This logic relates to visual and aural aspects as well as overt intellectualisation, through literary references and driving philosophies.<ref name="feast" /><ref name="slug" /> Books such as ''[[Don Quixote]]'', ''[[House of Leaves]]'', ''[[Labyrinths]]'' and the philosophies of [[Jeremy Bentham]] have all played a role in shaping the themes of Isis' releases.<ref name="decibel" />

There is an overt intention of progressing heavy music present in Isis' output; a desire to further the intellectual cause that pushes them forward.<ref name="mtv">{{cite web | last = Harris| first = Chris| date=August 26, 2006 |url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1539033/20060821/isis.jhtml?headlines=true | title = Tool Opening Act Isis Say They're Ready To Be Booed By Meatheads| publisher = MTV| access-date =January 17, 2007}}</ref> This is evident within the clear progression of their sound from release to release, their influence on heavy music, and their acceptance in art circles where other metal bands are not so readily embraced. Their stated goal is "not to break away from the scene that [they] came from, but to expand upon it".<ref name="earpollution" /> Publications such as ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' attest to how Turner has completed his goal, explaining that "Aaron Turner has loosened hardcore from its geographical roots, and in the process created an intimate, yet immeasurable vision all of his own".<ref>[[Ipecac Recordings]]. ''[http://www.border.se/Press/Isis/ISIS_bio.pdf Isis: Biography 2004]''. [[Press release]]. Retrieved on February 9, 2007. (See specifically: ''Terrorizer'' January/February 2003.) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013115547/http://www.border.se/Press/Isis/ISIS_bio.pdf |date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref> Turner has complained that "metal in general has long been unjustly maligned as solely the province of knuckle-dragging meatheads [...] That said, there's never been a group of musicians like there is now, who are helping to advance the form."<ref name="nyt" />

===Themes===
[[File:Bryant Clifford Meyer, Guitar — Isis @ Wagenhallen, Stuttgart, 2009-07-09.jpg|thumb|257x257px|Bryant Clifford Meyer]]
Most of Isis' releases revolve around a theme.<ref name="stylus" /> While each release has its own unique theme, many of the major releases interconnect. Turner has stated: "we wanted to have albums that weren't just grab-bags of songs but rather a cohesive experience from beginning to end, from the music to the lyrics to the layout of the record."<ref name="slug" />

No Isis album contains an explicit [[wikt:diegesis|diegesis]], or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases are defined by some as "pseudo-concept albums".<ref name="covert" /> The band see lyrics as important, but at the same time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word.<ref name="decibel" /><ref name="thrasher">{{cite web | last = Locks| first = Jesse|date=March 2005|url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSE/is_291/ai_n9489177 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013161342/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSE/is_291/ai_n9489177 |url-status = dead |archive-date = October 13, 2007 | title = Isis | work = [[Thrasher Magazine]]| access-date =December 23, 2006}}</ref> Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. ''Oceanic'' tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by [[drowning]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Scott | last = Kelly | title = The Show | publisher = Combat Music Radio | year = 2006 | url = http://www.combatmusicradio.com/The_Show/TheShow061305.mp3 | access-date = January 24, 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930191232/http://www.combatmusicradio.com/The_Show/TheShow061305.mp3 | archive-date = September 30, 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except ''Panopticon''. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you."<ref name="covert" /> Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me," he says. "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not."<ref name="vision">{{cite journal|last=Pitchon|first=Avi|title=The Vision Divine|journal=[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]|issue=124| date=October 2004 |pages=20–2}}</ref> The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.<ref>Buts, Jeroen. [http://lib.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/001/414/985/RUG01-001414985_2010_0001_AC.pdf "5.1"]. ''The Thematical and Stylistic Evolution of Heavy Metal Lyrics and Imagery From the 70s to Present Day''. pp. 82-83. "Isis's lyrics for example centred such concepts as that of the mosquito swarm on their entire first album 'Mosquito Control', a theme which they would refer to very subtly in future lyrics, visual art, and titles by using words such as 'swarm', 'sting', 'hive' or 'cocoon' and images of mosquito's. Examples are 'Collapse and Crush', 'Swarm Reigns (Down)' and 'Gentle Time' on their album 'Celestial', which also added imagery of signals and signalling communication towers."</ref>

''Panopticon'' was an overtly political release, and arguably the clearest statement made within their music yet.<ref name="stylus" /> It displayed fears of surveillance and of tacit governmental influence; its namesake, the [[panopticon]], was [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s concept for a prison system in which all the prisoners can be viewed by one guard in a central tower, without being able to know whether they are being observed or not. Bentham described the Panopticon as "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example."<ref>{{cite book|first=Jeremy|last=Bentham|author-link=Jeremy Bentham|title=[[s:Panopticon; or the Inspection-House|Panopticon; or the Inspection-House]]|year=1787|chapter=Preface}}</ref> Quizzed on government conspiracies, Turner states: "I do believe that each and every day our government and the huge corporate entities of this country lie to us about numerous subjects. In this respect we are all victims of a huge conspiracy—most of those in power are only concerned with the advancement of their agendas and have no qualms about deceiving and hurting the American people."<ref name="feast" />

After constantly explaining concepts and story outlines to interviewers and fans, Turner chose to keep the thematic basis of ''In the Absence of Truth'' quiet. "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like I was losing my connection to the music and the lyrics simply from having repeated it so many times [...] I feel there's a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves. It's all spelled out," Turner continues. "So it's interesting to leave some of that stuff open-ended so they have to do a little bit of legwork themselves."<ref name="covert"/> He was similarly reticent about revealing much which went into ''Wavering Radiant'', beyond noting that [[Carl Jung]]'s theories, and dreams, served as inspiration.<ref name="Five Alive">{{cite journal|first=J.|last=Bennett|title=Five Alive|journal=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] | date=June 2009 | issue = 56 | pages = 68–73 }}</ref>
