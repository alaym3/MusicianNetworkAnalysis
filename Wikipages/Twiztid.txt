'''Twiztid''' is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] known for both their [[horror fiction|horror]]-themed lyrics and [[rock music|rock]] influenced sound. Formed in 1997, Twiztid is composed of rappers [[Jamie Madrox (rapper)|Jamie "Madrox" Spaniolo]] and [[Monoxide Child|Paul "Monoxide" Methric]]. Spaniolo and Methric are also members of the group [[House of Krazees]] with [[The R.O.C. (rapper)|R.O.C.]], which formed in 1992.

Twiztid released their debut album, ''[[Mostasteless]]'', in 1998. Since then, they have released 15 full-length studio albums, 13 extended plays, 17 compilation albums, two mixtapes, and numerous singles. They were signed with [[Psychopathic Records]] from 1997 until 2012. Two years later, they formed their own label, Majik Ninja Entertainment.

== History ==

===House of Krazees and becoming a duo (1992—1996)===
Prior to Twiztid, [[Jamie Madrox (rapper)|Jamie Spaniolo]] and [[Monoxide Child|Paul Methric]] were members of the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] trio [[House of Krazees]] alongside [[The R.O.C. (rapper)|Bryan Jones]]. They performed under the personas of Mr. Bones, Hektic, and The R.O.C. respectively.<ref name="BehindthePaint307">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |author-link=Violent J |author2=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/307 307–308] |chapter=Banned by a Filthy Rat }}</ref> The group released five albums in the 1990s before Methric and Spaniolo departed in 1997. Jones continued using the House of Krazees name for a few years before turning to a solo career instead.<ref name="BehindthePaint358">Bruce 2003. p. 358–360.</ref>

===Signing to Psychopathic Records, ''Mostasteless'', side projects, and ''Freek Show'' (1997—2001)===
After the split, Methric and Spaniolo sent a demo tape to [[Insane Clown Posse]] member [[Violent J|Joseph Bruce]] (Violent J), which also featured their friend [[Chris Rouleau]] (Blaze Ya Dead Homie), under the name ISI (Infamous Superstars Incorporated). The demo contained the tracks "2nd Hand Smoke", "Diemuthafuckadie", and "How Does It Feel?".<ref name="BehindthePaint358"/> Bruce was extremely impressed, invited Methric and Spaniolo to perform on The House of Horrors Tour, and signed them to [[Psychopathic Records]]. Before the tour kicked off, Bruce, Methric, and Spaniolo decided on a name that they felt would better fit the duo—"Twiztid". They also took the stage names of Monoxide Child (Methric) and Jamie Madrox (Spaniolo).<ref name="BehindthePaint358"/>

Twiztid's debut album, ''[[Mostasteless]]'', was originally released independently by Psychopathic Records in August 1998.<ref>{{Cite instagram |author=Robbie Pankow |user=twiztidhistory |postid=BzpONyiliOX |date=July 7, 2019 |title=Three Flyers Showing the Original Mostasteless Release Dates |language=english |access-date=May 15, 2021 |link=https://www.instagram.com/p/BzpONyiliOX}}</ref><ref name="crypt">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Cryptic Collection Credits (Mostasteless songs' recording dates) |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/2465263-The-Cryptic-Collection/images |access-date=May 15, 2021 |type=liner notes |publisher=Psychopathic Records |id=PSY42102}}</ref> A few of the tracks were conceived while the duo performed under their old personas of Mr. Bones and Hektic, while the other tracks were finished by [[Mike E.

After the release of the ''Mostasteless'' albums, Twiztid continued to build their fanbase within the [[juggalo]] community by performing at numerous shows and being involved with associated projects. [[Dark Lotus]] was the first project that emerged, as it consisted of the then-current roster of Psychopathic Records. Although the debut album had been set for 1999 after the release of the single "Echo Side", the album was delayed and the song instead appeared on Insane Clown Posse's album ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]''. Another project formed was [[Psychopathic Rydas]], which was a supergroup that consisted of Twiztid, Insane Clown Posse, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, and [[Myzery]]. The group took a satirical tone in the lyrics and used well-known [[gangsta rap]] beats as the backing music. The group's debut album was released in 1999, titled ''[[Dumpin']]''.

Twiztid was a headlining act at the first [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] in July 2000. The event was a success and Twiztid's presence continued for over a decade later. The duo also had made their acting debut in the [[comedy film]] ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]''. The plot was conceived by Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid. The film was a success as the home video peaked at #1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Music Videos]] chart. On October 31, 2000, Twiztid released their second studio album, ''[[Freek Show]]''. In his review of the album, AllMusic's Brad Mills wrote that "this kind of music appeals to a small sector of hip-hop listeners and will probably do well within [its] niche market, but the average hip-hop listener will just have to understand that this is a different kind of album".<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r505793|pure_url=yes}} |title=Review of ''Freek Show'' |access-date=2008-08-21 |last=Mills |first=Brad |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The album peaked at #51 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.<ref name="Billboard"/> ''Freek Show'' also featured producer Fritz the Cat for the first time, who the duo would work with on-and-off throughout their career. Twiztid released their first compilation album titled ''[[Cryptic Collection]]'' on November 13, 2000. It consisted of studio outtakes, cut songs from the original ''Mostasteless'' album, and 1990s tracks from the House of Krazees era.<ref name="crypt" />

The duo's close friend and labelmate Blaze Ya Dead Homie released his full-length debut in 2001 titled ''[[1 Less G n da Hood]]''. The album was notable since Twiztid was involved with nearly every track in regards to either production or vocals. In 2001, Dark Lotus had released their long-awaited debut album ''[[Tales from the Lotus Pod|Tales From the Lotus Pod]]''. Alongside Twiztid and Insane Clown Posse, [[Marz (rapper)|Marz]] and Blaze Ya Dead Homie had solidified the lineup as well. The album was a success as it peaked at #1 on the ''Billboard'' Heatseekers chart, #6 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Independent Albums]] chart, and #158 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. Shortly afterwards, Marz had left the group and was replaced by [[Anybody Killa]], who recorded new vocals for the album's reissue in 2002.

===''Mirror Mirror'' and ''The Green Book'' (2002—2004)===
On April 8, 2002, Twiztid released their first [[extended play]] and third major release, ''[[Mirror Mirror (EP)|Mirror Mirror]]''. AllMusic reviewer Bradley Torreano praised the EP, writing that "Despite the fact that few outside of the juggalo family will give this a chance, this might be one of the most accurate portrayals of the mood of most unhappy young people in 2002".<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r580595|pure_url=yes}} |title=Review of ''Mirror Mirror'' |access-date=2008-08-21 |last=Torreano |first=Bradley |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> ''Mirror Mirror'' peaked at #5 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart and at #103 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.<ref name="Billboard"/> The duo then embarked on a national tour to support ''Mirror Mirror''. Footage from the tour was incorporated into a [[webshow]] that was hosted by Twiztid titled ''The Purple Show'', which also featured skits and backstage antics. Only four episodes were filmed for ''The Purple Show'' before its cancellation; however, it was released on DVD with extra content in early 2003. 

For the 2003 version of the nationwide [[Van's Warped Tour]], Twiztid was added to the lineup, but they had not received a warm reception. On July 1, 2003, Twiztid released their third studio album ''[[The Green Book (album)|The Green Book]]''. Spaniolo referred to the album as a "Juggalo favorite".<ref name="Horroryearbook">{{cite web | author=Brain Hammer | title=Interview with Jamie Madrox of TWIZTID!!! | url=http://www.horroryearbook.com/544556/horroryearbook-interview-with-jamie-madrox-of-twiztid | date=March 19, 2009 | publisher=Horroryearbook | access-date=2009-03-30 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://archive.today/20110712220803/http://www.horroryearbook.com/544556/horroryearbook-interview-with-jamie-madrox-of-twiztid | archive-date=July 12, 2011 }}</ref> AllMusic reviewer Rob Theakston panned the album, writing that it "is much, much better than the last ICP card record, but looking at the forest from the trees, that really isn't saying much anymore".<ref>{{cite web | last=Theakston | first=Rob | title=Review of ''The Green Book'' | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r646447|pure_url=yes}} | website=[[Allmusic]] | access-date=2009-03-30 }}</ref> ''The Green Book'' peaked at #2 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart and at #52 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.<ref name="Billboard"/> In October 2003, Twiztid created an annual event named Fright Fest for [[halloween]]. The event also featured Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Anybody Killa, JD Tha Weed Man, and the duo's former House of Krazees partner The R.O.C. as performers. An exclusive EP titled ''Fright Fest 2003'' was also released to coincide with the event. Also in 2003, Twiztid had formed a short-lived record label on the side named Majik Recordz. Nothing was released on the label due to the duo's falling out with a business partner.

In 2004, Monoxide released his debut solo album ''[[Chainsmoker LP]]''. The album charted at #191 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, #14 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart, and #3 on the ''Billboard'' Heatseekers chart. It had featured guests such as Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Anybody Killa, [[Esham]], and Madrox.

===''Man's Myth (Vol. 1)'' and ''Mutant (Vol. 2)'' (2005—2006)===
Twiztid released their fourth full-length album ''[[Man's Myth (Vol. 1)]]'' on June 28, 2005. ''Man's Myth (Vol. 1)'' was the first half of a [[double album]] which concluded with the release of ''[[Mutant (Vol. 2)]]'' one month later.<ref name="Jeffries">{{cite web | last=Jeffries | first=David | title=Review of ''Man's Myth, Vol. 1'' | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r779550|pure_url=yes}} | website=[[Allmusic]] | access-date=2009-04-01 }}</ref> While ''Man's Myth (Vol. 1)'' featured a hip hop-oriented sound, ''Mutant (Vol. 2)'' featured a rock oriented sound.<ref name="Horroryearbook"/> According to Madrox, "I've always wanted to do a rock album and to date that was the closest thing to it we have ever done, so it holds a special place in my heart."<ref name="Horroryearbook"/> AllMusic reviewer David Jeffries praised ''Man's Myth (Vol. 1)'', writing that "it reaches farther outside the suburban trash world of Psychopathic Records than anything the label has released previously. Twiztid keep growing lyrically too and the album is edited tightly with little filler."<ref name="Jeffries"/> ''Man's Myth (Vol. 1)'' peaked at #4 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart, #14 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Rap Albums]] chart, and #62 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.<ref name="Billboard"/> ''Mutant (Vol. 2)'' peaked at #11 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart, #20 on the ''Billboard'' Top Rap Albums chart, and #80 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart<ref name="Billboard"/>

In 2006, Madrox released his debut solo album ''[[Phatso]]''. The album charted at #107 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, #3 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart, and #1 on the ''Billboard'' Heatseekers chart. A second version of the album was also released, titled ''Phatso (The Earth 2 Version)'', which featured remixes and new skits.

===''Independent's Day'', ''W.I.C.K.E.D.'', and ''Heartbroken & Homicidal'' (2007—2010)===
On July 4, 2007, Twiztid released their sixth full-length studio album ''[[Independents Day (album)|Independent's Day]]''. The album featured guest appearances from rappers signed to independent record labels, such as [[The Dayton Family]], [[Tha Dogg Pound]], [[Hed PE]] frontman [[Jared Gomes]], [[Tech N9ne]], and [[Krizz Kaliko]]. It also notably featured appearances by [[D12]] members [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] and [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]]. One of the group's members, [[Eminem]], had feuded with Insane Clown Posse since the late 1990s and thus the collaboration was noteworthy.<ref name="Jeffries-Independents">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1078268|pure_url=yes}} |title=Review of ''Independents Day'' |access-date=2008-08-22 |last=Jeffries |first=David |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The album peaked at #4 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart, #9 on the ''Billboard'' Top Rap Albums chart, and #57 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.<ref name="Billboard"/> In September 2007, the group's Toxic Terror Tour was cancelled after Monoxide suffered a torn [[anterior cruciate ligament]] following a car accident, but the tour was booked again in early 2008.<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff |title=''Mary J.

On March 17, 2009, Twiztid released their seventh full-length studio album ''[[Wicked (Twiztid album)|W.I.C.K.E.D.]]'' (short for "Wish I Could Kill Every Day").<ref>{{cite web | last=Huey | first=Steve | title=Biography of Twiztid | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p371409|pure_url=yes}} | website=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=2009-04-01 }}</ref> ''W.I.C.K.E.D.'' was Twiztid's highest charting album, peaking at #11 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, #4 on the ''Billboard'' Top Rap Albums chart, and #1 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart.<ref name="Billboard"/> ''W.I.C.K.E.D.'' became the third-highest charting album in Psychopathic Records history, after Insane Clown Posse's ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' and ''[[Bang! Pow! Boom!]]'', both of which peaked at #4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. During their End of Days Tour to promote ''W.I.C.K.E.D.'', the duo released a promotional EP titled ''End of Days''.

Twiztid released ''[[Heartbroken & Homicidal]]'' on September 21, 2010. Monoxide had produced or co-produced the vast majority of the songs alongside Brian Kuma and Eric Davie. The album had extensive packaging, such as the 28-page booklet that resembled a notebook, with the liner notes written in invisible ink. The casing included a black pencil which was used to reveal the album's liner notes, which was also visible under a black light.<ref name="HHV13I10">{{cite journal |url=http://psychopathicrecords.com/hatchetherald/100702/index.html |title=Twiztid Talk Heartbroken & Homicidal |journal=Hatchet Herald |volume=13 |issue=10 |access-date=July 17, 2010 |date=July 2, 2010 |publisher=[[Psychopathic Records]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924095401/http://psychopathicrecords.com/hatchetherald/100702/index.html |archive-date=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> The album peaked at #3 on both the ''Billboard'' Top Rap Albums and ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums charts.<ref name="Billboard"/>

===''Abominationz'', leaving Psychopathic Records, and ''A New Nightmare'' (2011—2013)===

On April 18, 2012, both Madrox and Monoxide were interviewed on [[Strange Music]]'s BlogTalkRadio. During the interview, they released the new album title, ''[[Abominationz]]''. It was eventually released on October 22, 2012. It had charted highly as it peaked at #2 on the ''Billboard'' Top Rap Albums chart, #4 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart, and #18 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. The album was mostly produced by Strange Music's in-house producer [[Seven (producer)|Seven]], which was the beginning of a close musical relationship with the duo. ''Abominationz'' was Twiztid's last release under Psychopathic Records, as they left the label in December 2012. Blaze Ya Dead Homie followed soon afterwards. It was noted that there was no animosity, and Twiztid had simply wished to explore new ventures since they had been with Psychopathic Records for 15 years at that point. Besides Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid had the longest tenure on the label, more than any other artist that was signed.

Upon leaving Psychopathic Records, Twiztid had not initially announced any label plans; thus, they stayed as an unsigned act. The duo released ''[[A New Nightmare]]'' on July 30, 2013. Classified as either a mixtape or EP, it was Twiztid's 11th major studio release overall. The album peaked at #17 on the ''Billboard'' Top Rap Albums chart. In regards to other Twiztid albums, ''A New Nightmare'' had the largest amount of featured performers, such as Blaze Ya Dead Homie, [[JellyRoll]], [[Wrekonize]], [[Caskey (rapper)|Caskey]], [[Johnny Richter]], [[Swollen Members]], The R.O.C., and others.

===Creation of Majik Ninja Entertainment, ''The Darkness'', and ''The Continuous Evilution of Life's ?s'' (2014—2017)===
Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie reunited with Insane Clown Posse for the Dark Lotus album ''[[The Mud, Water, Air & Blood]]'' in 2014. It was the supergroup's highest charting release as it peaked at #43 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. Also in 2014, Twiztid announced that they would form their own record label titled Majik Ninja Entertainment (MNE for short). They had also dubbed their in-house studio as "The Dojo". On October 21, 2014, Blaze Ya Dead Homie released his fifth full-length album titled ''[[Gang Rags: Reborn]]''. The album signified the creation of MNE as it was the label's first overall release. Twiztid released their next album ''[[The Darkness (album)|The Darkness]]'' in early 2015, and it was MNE's second release. The album peaked at #3 on the ''Billboard'' Top Rap Albums chart and at #29 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.<ref name="Billboard"/> Towards the end of 2015, Twiztid recruited a backing band for their live shows, named The Wickedness. The members consisted of keyboardist Tiffany Lowe ([[Combichrist]]), guitarist Rocky Sobon (Ventana), and drummer Sean "Drayven" Davidson ([[Static-X]]/[[Davey Suicide]]). The Wickedness performed with Twiztid at various dates in 2015 and 2016, but Lowe and Sobon eventually departed from the band. Davidson then continued to be employed as Twiztid's drummer both live and in the studio.<ref name="wickedness">{{cite web |url=http://sidestagemagazine.com/for-the-first-time-ever-twiztid-to-perform-with-full-band-the-wickedness-on-select-upcoming-tour-dates/ |title=''For the First Time Ever – TWIZTID to Perform with Full Band The Wickedness on Select Upcoming Tour Dates'' |access-date=2021-06-06 |last=Delano |first=Brandon |date=September 22, 2015 |website=Sidestage Magazine}}</ref>

From Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie's Psychopathic Records departure in 2012 up until 2016, they had continued to perform at the annual Gathering of the Juggalos. The 2016 event featured a prominent presence by MNE, as each artist released an EP at the event; Twiztid with ''Trapped'', Blaze Ya Dead Homie with ''Dead Vulture'', The R.O.C. with ''The Fucking Prey Lewd'', and [[Lex "The Hex" Master]] with ''Mr. Ugly''. At the end of 2016, it was revealed that former Psychopathic Records recording artist and in-house producer [[Axe Murder Boyz|Young Wicked]] had joined the MNE label under controversial circumstances. The signing had severed all of Twiztid's ties to Psychopathic Records and Insane Clown Posse, including appearances at the Gathering of the Juggalos, studio collaborations, and tour plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faygoluvers.net/v5/2017/01/icp-announces-that-twiztidmne-will-not-be-at-juggalo-day-or-the-gathering/|title=ICP Announces that Twiztid/MNE will not be at Juggalo Day or the Gathering; Twiztid Shop VIP News |website=Faygoluvers.net}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, Twiztid released ''[[The Continuous Evilution of Life's ?'s|The Continuous Evilution of Life's ?s]]''. The album peaked at #28 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart. Blaze Ya Dead Homie and Twiztid also released an album titled ''Triple Threat'' on September 1, 2017. The trio's name stemmed from the song "Triple Threat" off of 2005's ''Mutant (Vol. 2)'' album.

[[file:Twiztid.jpg|thumb|280px|Twiztid performing in 2018]]
===Other ventures, ''Generation Nightmare'', ''Mad Season'', and ''Revelashen'' (2018—2020)===
In early 2018, Twiztid hosted the first Astronomicon event. Astronomicon was focused on video games, horror films, comic books, and musical acts. Special guests included professional wrestlers such as [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[Scott Hall]], [[Eric Bischoff]], and [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]]; horror icons such as [[Bill Moseley]], [[Kane Hodder]], and [[Tony Moran]]; comedic actors such as [[Brian O'Halloran]] and [[Jason Mewes]]; and metal musicians such as [[Carla Harvey]]. The event was a success as it was turned into a yearly event afterwards. Twiztid also announced a comic book series titled ''Haunted High-Ons'', written by Dirk Manning. The project was revealed alongside a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.

Twiztid was invited to join Van's Warped Tour for the 2018 cycle, 15 years after the duo's last appearance. Due to the more positive reception than their 2003 appearance, they were invited back the following year; however, the 2019 cycle ended up being the final Van's Warped Tour since it was then retired as an entity.

On April 26, 2019, Twiztid released their 12th full-length studio album ''[[Generation Nightmare]]'', a more rock-oriented album than most of their previous releases. ''Generation Nightmare'' had featured the most variety of producers on a singular Twiztid album to that point, with seven different producers overall. It peaked at #3 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart and at #51 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.

On April 20, 2020, Twiztid released their 13th full-length studio album ''[[Mad Season (Twiztid album)|Mad Season]]'' on their online web store without any prior promotion. A few days later, the album was made available on streaming services. The duo returned to a more horrorcore sound with a hip-hop approach on ''Mad Season''.<ref>[https://www.theoaklandpress.com/entertainment/rap-duo-twiztid-releases-surprise-new-album/article_6022f644-8314-11ea-9e04-3b0b93de5109.html Rap duo Twiztid releases surprise new album ] ''The Oakland Press'', April 20, 2020</ref> Due to the lack of promotion, the album had found only minimal success as it peaked at #38 on the ''Billboard'' Top Independent Albums chart.

On November 23, 2020, Twiztid announced their next album would be titled ''[[Revelashen]]''. Similar to ''Mad Season'', it received very little promotion or hype, and it was released merely four days after the announcement. In regards to prior albums, ''Revelashen'' was not as successful since it only appeared on one chart, the ''Billboard'' [[Top Current Album Sales]] chart, peaking at #57. ''Revelashen'' was more straightforward in its content, with the duo shredding the theatrical storylines and moving away from strictly horror themes.<ref>[https://www.altpress.com/features/twiztid-revelashen-get-through-the-day-premiere/ Hear how “Get Through The Day” is unlike anything Twiztid has ever done] ''Alternative Press'', November 23, 2020</ref>

===''Unlikely Prescription'' and future plans (2021—present)===
Twiztid released the promotional EP ''Electric Lettuce'' on April 20, 2021 as it coincided with a [[4:20]] [[livestream]] event. Twiztid also formed another supergroup in 2021 named East Side Ninjas, which featured the duo, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, and Anybody Killa. Their debut album ''Pact of the 4'' was released on June 5, 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://faygoluvers.net/v5/2021/06/reminder-eastside-ninjas-pact-of-the-4-now-available/ |title=''REMINDER!
