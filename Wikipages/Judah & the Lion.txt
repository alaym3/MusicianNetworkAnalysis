The album reached No. 2 on the ''[[Billboard Heatseeksers|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Albums chart, No. 7 on the ''Billboard'' Americana/Folk Albums chart, and No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Independent Albums chart. The album's sound was a mix of Americana, club pop, and hip-hop, which was polarizing to some of their longtime fans.<ref name="chicagotribune"/> In November 2016, Judah & the Lion released the ''Take It All Back 2.0 + Stockholm EP''. The single "[[Take It All Back]]" reached No. 19 on the Hot AC Chart and No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Alternative Songs]] chart for three consecutive weeks.

Cobb recorded the songs in a series of quick takes, aiming for performances that sounded real and raw rather than polished and perfect. The recording was completed in two weeks.
