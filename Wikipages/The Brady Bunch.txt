'''''The Brady Bunch''''' is an American [[sitcom]] created by [[Sherwood Schwartz]] that aired from September 26, 1969, to March 8, 1974, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The series revolves around a large [[Stepfamily|blended family]] with six children. Considered one of the last old-style family sitcoms, the show aired for five seasons and, after its cancellation in 1974, went into [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in September 1975.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ann B Davis obit |date=June 3, 2014 |url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/656581/brady-bunch-actor-ann-b-davis-dies-88 |access-date=2014-06-03 |publisher=Straight.com}}</ref> Neither a hit nor a critical success during its original run, the program has since become a popular syndicated staple, especially among children and teenage viewers.

''The Brady Bunch''{{'}}s success in syndication led to several television reunion films and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series: ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour]]'' (1976–77), ''[[#The Brady Girls Get Married / The Brady Brides|The Brady Girls Get Married]]'' (1981), ''[[#The Brady Girls Get Married / The Brady Brides|The Brady Brides]]'' (1981), ''[[A Very Brady Christmas]]'' (1988), and ''[[The Bradys]]'' (1990). In 1995, the series was adapted into a satirical comedy theatrical film titled ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'', followed by ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'' in 1996. A second sequel, ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]]'', aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in November 2002 as a [[television film|made-for-television film]].

In 1997, "Getting [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]]" (season three, episode 12) was ranked number 37 on [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time]].<ref>{{Cite journal |year=1997 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |issue=June 28 July 4}}</ref> The show's enduring popularity has resulted in its widespread recognition as an American [[cultural icon]].

==Premise==
Mike Brady ([[Robert Reed]]), a widowed [[architect]] with three sons—Greg ([[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]]), Peter ([[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]), and Bobby ([[Mike Lookinland]])—marries Carol Martin ([[Florence Henderson]]), who herself has three daughters: Marcia ([[Maureen McCormick]]), Jan ([[Eve Plumb]]), and Cindy ([[Susan Olsen]]). Carol and her daughters take the Brady surname. Included in the blended family are Mike's live-in [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], Alice Nelson ([[Ann B. Davis]]), and the boys' dog, Tiger. (In the pilot episode, the girls also have a pet: a cat named Fluffy. Fluffy never appears in any other episodes.) The setting is a large two-story house designed by Mike, located in a Los Angeles suburb.<ref name="BB">{{Cite web |title=Brady Bunch synopsis |url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/thebradybunch.html |access-date=2014-06-01 |publisher=Sitcoms Online}}</ref>

In the first season, awkward adjustments, accommodations, gender rivalries, and resentments inherent in blended families dominate the storylines. In an early episode, Carol tells Bobby that the only "steps" in their household lead to the second floor (in other words, that the family contains no "stepchildren", only "children"). Thereafter, episodes focus on typical teen and [[Preadolescence|preteen]] concerns like [[sibling rivalry]], [[puppy love]], [[self-image]], character building, and responsibility. Noticeably absent is any [[Political criticism|political commentary]], especially regarding the [[Vietnam War]], which was being waged at its largest extent during the height of the series.<ref>History Channel, "The Social History of Television" (Aug 2013)</ref>

The regular cast appears in an opening title sequence in which video "headshots" are arranged in a three-by-three grid, with cast members appearing to look around at one another. The sequence used the then-new "[[multi-dynamic image technique]]" created by Canadian filmmaker [[Christopher Chapman]]; as a result of the popular attention it garnered in this sequence, it has been referred to in the press as "the Brady Bunch effect".<ref name="theglobeandmail.com">[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/christopher-chapman-oscar-winner-invented-brady-bunch-effect/article27056899/ ''The Globe and Mail'', Obituary: "Christopher Chapman, Oscar Winner who invented 'Brady Bunch' effect"]</ref><ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-chapman-dead-creator-brady-834893 ''The Hollywood Reporter'', "Oscar-Winning Creator of 'The Brady Bunch' Effect Dies at 88"]</ref> In a 2010 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'', the show's opening title sequence ranked number eight on a list of TV's top-10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.<ref name="TVGuide">Tomashoff, Craig.

===Recurring characters===
* Sam Franklin ([[Allan Melvin]]) is Alice's boyfriend. He is the owner of a local [[butcher]] shop. Sam appears in only eight episodes, but they span all five seasons. He is also frequently mentioned in dialogue, and Alice occasionally goes on dates with him off-screen. By the time of the 1981 made-for-TV movie ''The Brady Girls Get Married'', Alice and Sam are married.
* Tiger the dog – [[Tiger (dog)|The original dog]] that played Tiger died early in the first season.<ref>"Growing up Brady" by Barry Williams with Chris Kreski, p. 210, 1992</ref> A replacement dog proved problematic, so the producers decided the dog would appear only when essential to the plot. Tiger appeared in about half the episodes in the first season and about half a dozen episodes in the second season. Tiger seemingly vanished without an explanation and was not shown again after "The Impractical Joker" (last episode shown with Tiger) and "What Goes Up" (last episode made with Tiger); however, his kennel remained in the back yard for the entire run of the series.
* Mr. Phillips ([[Jack Collins (actor)|Jack Collins]]) is Mike's boss at the architectural firm. He appears in only three episodes, but is often mentioned in other episodes when work-related issues occur.

* Cousin Oliver ([[Robbie Rist]]) – In the middle of season five, producers added a new character named Oliver, Carol Brady's young nephew, who is sent to live with the Bradys while his parents are living in South America. The character was added in an attempt to fill the age gap left by the maturing Brady children—the youngest (Susan Olsen) was 12 years old during the show's final season. Lloyd Schwartz, son of creator and executive producer Sherwood Schwartz, later admitted that the character threw off the balance of the show and said that fans regarded the character as an interloper. Oliver appears in the final six episodes of season five, which proved to be the final season, as ABC cancelled the series in 1974. The addition of the character has been cited as the moment the series "[[jumped the shark]]".<ref>Schwartz 2010 p.201</ref> The term "Cousin Oliver" has been used to describe the addition of a young character as an attempt to save a series from cancellation.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Ariano |first1=Tara |title=Television Without Pity: 752 Things We Love to Hate (And Hate to Love) About TV |last2=Bunting |first2=Sarah D. |publisher=Quirk Books |year=2006 |isbn=1-59474-117-4 |page=63}}</ref>

==Production==

===Development===
In 1966, following the success of his TV series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', Sherwood Schwartz conceived the idea for ''The Brady Bunch'' after reading in ''The Los Angeles Times'' that "30% of marriages [in the United States] have a child or children from a previous marriage." He set to work on a [[television pilot|pilot]] script for a series tentatively titled ''Mine and Yours''.<ref name="Brady">{{Cite book |last1=Edelstein |first1=Andrew J. |title=The Brady Bunch Book |last2=Lovece |first2=Frank |publisher=Warner Books |year=1990 |isbn=0-446-39137-9 |location=New York |pages=5–9 |author-link2=Frank Lovece}}</ref> Schwartz then developed the script to include three children for each parent. While Mike Brady is depicted as being a widower, Schwartz originally wanted the character of Carol Brady to have been a divorcée, but the network objected to this. A compromise was reached whereby Carol's marital status (whether she was divorced or widowed) was never directly revealed.

Schwartz shopped the series to the "big three" television networks of the era. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[NBC]] all liked the script, but each network wanted changes before they would commit to filming, so Schwartz shelved the project.<ref>[[The Biography Channel]] documentary titled "''The Brady Bunch''", retrieved on June 16, 2008.</ref> Although similarities exist between the series and two 1968 theatrical release films, United Artists' ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]'' (starring [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]]) and [[National General Pictures|CBS]]'s ''[[With Six You Get Eggroll]]'' (starring [[Brian Keith]] and [[Doris Day]]), the original script for ''The Brady Bunch'' predated the scripts for both of these films. Nonetheless, the outstanding success of ''Yours, Mine and Ours'' ([[1968 in film|the 11th-highest-grossing film of 1968]]) was a factor in ABC's decision to order episodes for the series.<ref name=Brady />

After receiving a commitment for 13 weeks of television shows from ABC in 1968, Schwartz hired film and television director [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] to direct the pilot, then called "The Brady Brood," cast the six children from 264 interviews during that summer, and hired the actors to play the mother, father, and housekeeper roles.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Sherwood |title=Brady, Brady, Brady: The Complete Story of The Brady Bunch as Told by the Father/Son Team who Really Know |last2=Schwartz |first2=Lloyd J. |publisher=Running Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-7624-4164-8 |pages=46, 48}}</ref> As the sets were built on [[Paramount Television]] stage 5, adjacent to the stage where ''[[H.R.

Filming of the pilot began on Friday, October 4, 1968, and lasted eight days.

===Theme song and credits sequence===
The theme song, written by Schwartz and [[Frank De Vol]], and originally arranged, sung, and performed by Paul Parrish, Lois Fletcher, and John Beland{{failed verification|date=August 2016}} under the name the [[Peppermint Trolley Company]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Biography of the Peppermint Trolley Company |url=http://www.dannyfaragher.com/bio/the-peppermint-trolley-company/ |publisher=Danny Faragher}}</ref> quickly communicated to audiences that the Bradys were a blended family. As described above, the Brady family is shown in a three-by-three grid, tic-tac-toe board-style graphic with Carol in the top center, Alice in the middle block, and Mike in the bottom center. To the right are three blocks with the boys from the oldest on top to the youngest. To the left are three blocks with the girls from the oldest to the youngest. In season two, the Brady kids took over singing the theme song. In season three, the boys sing the first verse, girls sing the second verse, and all sing together for the third and last verse. In season four, a new version is recorded with the same structure as the season three version, but in season five, the season three version returns. Utilizing [[Christopher Chapman|Christopher Chapman's]] "[[multi-dynamic image technique]]," a version of which had famously appeared in the 1968 film ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', the sequence was created and filmed by [[Howard A. Anderson Jr.]], a visual effects pioneer who worked on the title sequences for many popular television series.<ref name="archive">{{Cite web |title=Howard Anderson, Jr. Interview |url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/howard-anderson-jr# |access-date=2015-10-30 |publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Archive of American Television}}</ref> The use of this innovation here became so familiar through the sitcom's popularity that it was referred to in the press as the "Brady Bunch effect".<ref name="theglobeandmail.com" /><ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-chapman-dead-creator-brady-834893 ''The Hollywood Reporter'', "Oscar-Winning Creator of 'The Brady Bunch' Effect Dies at 88"]</ref>

The end credits feature an instrumental version of the theme song's third verse. In season one, it was recorded by the Peppermint Trolley Company. From season two on, the theme was recorded in-house by Paramount musicians.

===The Brady house===
The house, built in 1959 and used in exterior shots, originally bore little relation to the interior layout  (until 2018, when the interior of the house  was rebuilt to match the soundstage sets) of the Bradys' on screen home, is located in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]], within the city limits of Los Angeles. <!-- Please do not insert the address of the house, to respect to the current owners' privacy.--> According to a 1994 article in the ''Los Angeles Times'', the [[San Fernando Valley]] house was built in 1959 and selected as the Brady residence because series creator Schwartz felt it looked like a home where an architect would live.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Here's the story of the Brady Bunch house |url=http://davidbrady.com/times/latbrady.html |access-date=August 11, 2010 |publisher=Davidbrady.com}}</ref> A false window was attached to the front's [[A-frame house|A-frame]] section to give the illusion that it had two full stories (the 2018/2019 renovation installed a real window where the false one was in the TV show footage).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alleman |first=Richard |title=Hollywood: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie L.A. |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |year=2003 |isbn=0-8041-3777-3 |pages=427–428}}</ref> Contemporary establishing shots of the house were filmed with the owner's permission for the 1990 TV series ''[[The Bradys]]''. The owner refused to allow Paramount to restore the property to its 1969 look for ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' in 1995, so a [[facade]] resembling the original home was built around an existing house.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The house was put up for sale, for the first time since 1973, in the summer of 2018 with an asking price of $1.885 million.<ref>{{Cite news |last=O'Kane |first=Caitlin |date=July 19, 2018 |title=Iconic "Brady Bunch" house for sale after nearly 50 years |work=[[CBS News]] |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iconic-brady-bunch-house-for-sale-after-nearly-50-years/ |access-date=July 19, 2018}}</ref> Cable network [[HGTV]] outbid seven others for it, including [[NSYNC]]'s [[Lance Bass]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rao |first=Sonia |date=August 7, 2018 |title=It turns out HGTV outbid Lance Bass for the 'Brady Bunch' house |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/08/07/it-turns-out-hgtv-outbid-lance-bass-for-the-brady-bunch-house/ |access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref> HGTV has expanded the home for its original series ''[[A Very Brady Renovation]]'', with the goal of recreating each of the interior rooms used in the TV series (which had only existed as a Paramount Studios set) while maintaining the original exterior look from the street, and to make it fully habitable (unlike the sets made on Paramount soundstage #5). The six actors who played the TV children,  and who also actively participated in the 2018/2019 renovation, posed for a photo in front on November 1, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news |date=November 1, 2018 |title='Brady Bunch' cast members reunite at TV family home |work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://www.journalnow.com/news/trending/brady-bunch-cast-members-reunite-at-tv-family-home/article_d5027d07-fad8-5f89-9dc9-f99ac945cd6c.html |url-status=dead |access-date=September 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102195954/https://www.journalnow.com/news/trending/brady-bunch-cast-members-reunite-at-tv-family-home/article_d5027d07-fad8-5f89-9dc9-f99ac945cd6c.html |archive-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref> 

In the series, the address of the house was given as 4222 Clinton Way (as read aloud by Carol from an arriving package in the first-season episode entitled "Lost Locket, Found Locket", and "Clinton Way" is clearly legible on Marcia's driver permit in the fifth-season episode "The Driver's Seat").<ref>{{Cite book |last=McHugh |first=Erin |title=Where? |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2005 |isbn=1-4027-2572-8 |page=54}}</ref> Although no city was ever specified, it was presumed from references to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], the [[Los Angeles Rams]], and a [[Hollywood]] movie studio, among many others, that the Bradys lived in [[Southern California]], most likely Los Angeles or one of its suburbs.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mansour |first=David |title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=0-7407-5118-2 |page=54}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Terrace |first=Vincent |title=Encyclopedia of Television: Series, Pilots and Specials 1974–1984 |publisher=VNR AG |year=1985 |isbn=0-918432-61-8 |volume=2 |page=63}}</ref>

The interior sets of the Brady house were used at least three times for other Paramount TV shows while ''The Brady Bunch'' was still in production: twice for ''[[Mannix]]'' and once for ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]''. In the case of ''Mission: Impossible'', the Brady furniture was also used.<ref>Mannix – season three, episode 19 – "Who is Sylvia?"</ref><ref>Mannix – season four, episode two – "One for the Lady"</ref><ref>Mission: Impossible – season six, episode 20 – "Double Dead"</ref> A re-creation of the Brady house was constructed for the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode "[[Sunshine Days]]", which also revolved around ''The Brady Bunch''.

==Broadcast and syndication==
Since its first syndicated airing in September 1975, an episode of the show has been broadcast somewhere in the United States and abroad every day of the year.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-based Interventions |publisher=Springer Publishing Company |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8261-0119-8 |editor-last=Rubin, Lawrence C. |page=248}}</ref> Episodes were also shown on [[ABC Daytime]] from July 9, 1973, to April 18, 1975, and from June 30 to August 29, 1975, at 11:30&nbsp;a.m. EST/10:30 CST.

The show aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] starting in the 1980s until 1997, [[Nick at Nite]] in 1995 (for a special event), and again from 1998 to 2003 (and briefly during the spring of 2012), [[The N]] from March to April 2004, on [[TV Land]] on and off from 2002 to 2015, [[Nick Jr.]] (as part of the [[NickMom]] block from 2012 to 2013), and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January to June 2013 and again starting September 5, 2016, until September 30, 2016.

Syndicated episodes are edited to shorten the original 25–26 minute running times, allowing for longer commercial breaks.

===Current airings===
Since its national launch in 2010, the [[Weigel Broadcasting]]-owned classic-TV network [[MeTV]] has aired a weekly two-hour block of the show every Sunday morning/early afternoon promoted as the "Brady Bunch Brunch". In subsequent years, MeTV also periodically aired the series on weekday mornings.<ref>[http://metvnetwork.com/shows/the-brady-bunch The Brady Bunch on Me-TV - Me TV Network.com]</ref> [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]]—a MeTV sister network—occasionally airs the show as well.

''The Brady Bunch'' is also available through [[video-on-demand]] services [[Hulu]] and [[Paramount+]], although neither streamer offers the complete collection of episodes in its entirety.

[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast the show in a number of United Kingdom regions from 1975 to 1982; it later appeared on [[Sky One]]. The series was never a big hit in Britain.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==Home media==
[[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]] released all five seasons on DVD in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] from 2005 to 2006, before [[CBS Home Entertainment]] took over DVD rights to the [[Paramount Television]] library (though CBS DVD releases are still distributed by Paramount). Paramount/CBS has released the series on DVD in other countries as well.

On April 3, 2007, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Entertainment released the complete series [[box set]], which includes the TV movies ''A Very Brady Christmas'' and "The Brady 500" (an episode of ''The Bradys''), as well as two episodes of ''The Brady Kids'' animated series. The box art for this set features green [[Shag (fabric)|shag carpeting]] and 1970s-style wood paneling.

8 years later on April 7, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Entertainment re-released the complete series box set, a repackaged version at a lower price, but it does not include the bonus disc that was part of the original complete series release.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Paramount to Re-Release a 20-DVD Set of 'The Complete Series' |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Brady-Bunch-The-Complete-Series/20655 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122222448/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Brady-Bunch-The-Complete-Series/20655 |archive-date=January 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The TV movie ''A Very Brady Christmas'' was released as a stand-alone DVD in Region 1 on October 10, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Brady Bunch - Ho! Ho! Ho!

Ratings data prior to 1972 is scarce for shows that did not place in the Top 30.  Beginning in 2017, The TV Ratings Guide began publishing vintage television ratings as they became readily available from old newspaper publishings. Season 4 ratings came from [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] year-end rankings dated May 30, 1973.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1973-74 Ratings History |url=http://www.thetvratingsguide.com/2019/12/1973-74-tv-ratings-history.html}}</ref> ''The Brady Bunch'' earned steady ratings during its primetime run (but never placed in the top 30 during the five years it aired) and was cancelled in 1974 after five seasons and 117 episodes; it was cancelled shortly after the series crossed the [[100 episodes|minimum threshold]] for [[broadcast syndication|syndication]]. At that point in the storyline, Greg graduated from high school and was about to enroll in college.<ref name="History" />

===Awards and honors===
{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2020}}
''The Brady Bunch'' was not an award-winning show at the time of its original broadcast in the 1970s. The series and its cast and crew were not nominated for an award until 1989, when [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] was honored with the [[Young Artist Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award|Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the [[10th Youth in Film Awards]].<ref name="Young Artist Awards 10">{{Cite web |title=10th Annual Youth in Film Awards |url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms10.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716012647/http://youngartistawards.org/pastnoms10.htm |archive-date=2015-07-16 |access-date=2011-03-31 |website=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref>

==Discography==
During the series' original run, the six Brady kids recorded several albums on Paramount's record label, all credited to "The Brady Bunch". Note that Florence Henderson and Robert Reed did not participate in these recordings, and are not pictured on the album sleeves. 

While [[session musician]]s provided backing, the actors from the series provided their own singing voices (which was not always the case for early 1970s television crossover acts). In addition, Chris Knight & Maureen McCormick issued a duet LP in 1973, and five of the six Brady kids also released solo singles between 1970 and 1974; only Susan Olsen did not. None of the singles from The Brady Bunch, or any single or album from the assorted spin-off acts, ever became hits on any national music [[Billboard charts|charts]].  The group's 1972 album ''Meet The Brady Bunch'' was their only charting release, hitting #108 on Billboard's album charts.

==Spin-offs, sequels, and reunions==
Several [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s and [[sequel]]s and reality series, to the original series have been made, featuring all or most of the original cast. These include another sitcom, an animated series, a variety show, television movies, a dramatic series, a stage play, theatrical movies, and a reality series:
{{anchor|kellyskids}}

===''Kelly's Kids''===
A final-season ''Brady Bunch'' episode, "Kelly's Kids", was intended as a pilot for a prospective spin-off series of the same name. [[Ken Berry]] starred as Ken Kelly, a friend and neighbor of the Bradys, who with his wife Kathy ([[Brooke Bundy]]) adopted three orphaned boys of different racial backgrounds. One of the adopted sons was played by Todd Lookinland, the younger brother of Mike Lookinland. While ''Kelly's Kids'' was not subsequently picked up as a full series, producer Sherwood Schwartz reworked the basic premise for the short-lived 1980s sitcom ''[[Together We Stand]]'' starring [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Dee Wallace]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stoddard |first=Sylvia |title=The Brady Bunch: An Outrageously Funny, Far-Out Guide To America's Favorite TV Family |publisher=Macmillan |year=1996 |isbn=0-312-96053-0 |pages=151–152}}</ref>

===''The Brady Kids''===
{{Main|The Brady Kids}}
A 22-episode animated [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series, produced by [[Filmation]] and airing on ABC from September 1972 to August 1974, is about the Brady kids having various adventures.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Erickson |first=Hal |title=Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 1993 |date=1995 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0-7864-0029-3 |page=111}}</ref> The family's adults were never seen or mentioned, and the "home" scenes were in a very large, well-appointed tree house. Several animals were regular characters, including two non-English-speaking pandas (Ping and Pong), a talking bird (Marlon) which could do magic, and an ordinary pet dog (Mop Top, not Tiger). The first 17 episodes featured the voices of all six of the original child actors from the show, but Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick, and Christopher Knight were replaced for the last five episodes due to a contract dispute.

===''The Brady Bunch Variety Hour''===
{{Main|The Brady Bunch Hour}}
On November 28, 1976, a one-hour [[television special]] entitled ''The Brady Bunch Variety Hour'' aired on ABC. [[Eve Plumb]] was the only regular cast member from the original show who declined to be in the series and the role of Jan was recast with [[Geri Reischl]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stoddard |first=Sylvia |title=The Brady Bunch: An Outrageously Funny, Far-Out Guide To America's Favorite TV Family |publisher=Macmillan |year=1996 |isbn=0-312-96053-0 |page=197}}</ref> Produced by [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], the sibling team behind ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'', ''[[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny and Marie]]'', and other variety shows and children's series of the era, the show was intended to air every fifth week in the same slot as ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', but ended up being scheduled sporadically throughout the season, leading to inconsistent ratings and its inevitable cancellation.

In 2009, ''Brady Bunch'' cast member Susan Olsen, with Lisa Sutton, published a book, ''[[Love to Love You Bradys]]'', which dissects and celebrates the ''Variety Hour'' as a cult classic.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 31, 2009 |title='Love to You Bradys' exposes troubled set |url=http://www.today.com/id/32597867/ns/today-books/t/love-you-bradys-exposes-troubled-set/ |access-date=April 29, 2013 |publisher=today.com}}</ref>

A TV reunion movie called ''The Brady Girls Get Married'' was produced in 1981. Although scheduled to be shown in its original full-length movie format, NBC at the last minute divided it into half-hour segments and showed one part a week for three weeks, and the fourth week debuted a spin-off sitcom titled ''The Brady Brides''. The reunion movie featured the entire original cast; this proved to be the only time the entire cast worked together on a single project following the cancellation of the original series (the complete surviving cast also appeared in these official projects together: ''Brady Bunch Home Movies'' from 1995, ''[[The Brady Bunch 35th Anniversary Reunion Special: Still Brady After All These Years]]'' from 2004, as well as various reunion programs in 2019 for the 50th anniversary). The movie's opening credits featured the season-one "Grid" and theme song, with the addition of ''The Brady Girls Get Married'' title.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brady World – Episode Guide |url=http://www.bradyworld.com/episodes/brides.htm |access-date=August 11, 2010 |publisher=Bradyworld.com}}</ref> The movie shows what the characters had been doing since the original series ended: Mike is still an architect, Carol is a real-estate agent, Greg is a doctor, Marcia is a fashion designer, Peter is in the Air Force, Jan is also an architect, Bobby and Cindy are in college, and Alice has married Sam. Eventually, they all reunite for Marcia and Jan's double wedding.

''The Brady Brides'' features [[Maureen McCormick]] and [[Eve Plumb]] reprising their respective roles as Marcia and Jan Brady. The series begins with Marcia and Jan and their new husbands buying a house and living together. The clashes between Jan's uptight and conservative husband, Philip Covington III (a college professor in science who is several years older than Jan, played by Ron Kuhlman) and Marcia's slovenly and more [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] husband, Wally Logan (a fun-loving salesman for a large toy company, played by [[Jerry Houser]]), were the pivot on which many of the stories were based, not unlike ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''. [[Florence Henderson]] and [[Ann B. Davis]] also appeared regularly. Ten episodes were aired before the sitcom was cancelled. This was the only Brady show in sitcom form to be filmed in front of a live studio audience. [[Bob Eubanks]] guest-starred as himself in an episode where the two couples appear on ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''.

Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, ''The Brady Girls Get Married'' was rerun on various networks in its original full-length movie format.

In 2019, the series was released on DVD for the first time as a part of ''The Brady-est Brady Bunch TV & Movie Collection''.

===''A Very Brady Christmas''===
{{Main|A Very Brady Christmas}}
A second TV reunion movie, ''A Very Brady Christmas'', aired in December 1988 on CBS and features most of the regular cast (except [[Susan Olsen]], who was on her honeymoon at the time of filming; the role of Cindy was played by [[Jennifer Runyon]]), as well as three grandchildren, Peter's girlfriend, Valerie, and the spouses of Greg, Marcia, and Jan (Nora, Wally, and Phillip, respectively).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Owen |first=Rob |title=Gen X TV: "The Brady Bunch" to "Melrose Place" |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-8156-0585-4 |page=26}}</ref> The [[Nielsen ratings]] for ''A Very Brady Christmas'' were the highest of any television movie that season for CBS.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Newcomb |first=Horace |title=Encyclopedia of television: A-C, Volume 1 |publisher=CRC Press |year=2001 |isbn=1-57958-411-X |edition=2 |page=300}}</ref>

===''The Bradys''===
{{Main|The Bradys}}
Due to the success of ''A Very Brady Christmas'', CBS asked ''Brady Bunch'' creator Sherwood Schwartz and son Lloyd to create a new series for the network. According to Lloyd Schwartz, he and his father initially balked at the idea because they felt a new series would harm the Brady franchise. They finally relented because CBS was "desperate for programming". A new series featuring the Brady clan was created entitled ''The Bradys''. All original ''Brady Bunch'' cast members returned for the series, except for [[Maureen McCormick]] (Marcia), who was replaced with [[Leah Ayres]].

As with ''A Very Brady Christmas'', ''The Bradys'' also balanced elements of comedy and drama and featured storylines of a more serious nature than the original series and subsequent spin-offs. Lloyd Schwartz later said he compared ''The Bradys'' to another dramedy of the time, ''[[thirtysomething]]''. The two-hour series premiere episode aired on February 9, 1990, at 9 pm on CBS and initially drew respectable ratings. Subsequent episodes were moved to 8 pm, where ratings quickly declined. Due to the decline, CBS cancelled the series after six episodes.<ref>Schwartz 2010 p. 228</ref>

==Film adaptations==
Twenty years following the conclusion of the original series, a film adaptation, ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]],'' went into production and was released in 1995 from [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film is set in the present day (1990s) and the Bradys, still living their lives as if it were the 1970s, are unfamiliar with their surroundings. It stars [[Gary Cole]] and [[Shelley Long]] as Mike and Carol Brady, with [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] (Greg), [[Christine Taylor]] (Marcia), Paul Sutera (Peter), [[Jennifer Elise Cox]] (Jan), [[Jesse Soffer|Jesse Lee]] (Bobby), [[Olivia Hack]] (Cindy), [[Henriette Mantel]] (Alice), and cameo appearances from [[Ann B. Davis]] as a long-haul truck driver, [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] as a record label executive, [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]] as a Westdale High gym teacher, [[Rupaul]] as a Guidance Councelor, and [[Florence Henderson]] as Carol's mother. [[Mike Lookinland]], [[Susan Olsen]] and [[Maureen McCormick]] appear in deleted scenes.

A sequel, ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'', was released in 1996. The cast of the first film returned for the sequel. Another sequel, ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]],'' was made-for-television and aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 2002. [[Gary Cole]] and [[Shelley Long]] returned for the third film, while the Brady kids and Alice were recast.

The third episode of the [[Disney+]] miniseries ''[[WandaVision]]'', "[[Now in Color]]", pays homage to 1970s sitcoms, including ''The Brady Bunch'', and uses a similar intro for the virtual ''WandaVision'' in-show program.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-22 |title=The Casual Marvel Fan's Guide to WandaVision Episode 3 |url=https://slate.com/culture/2021/01/wandavision-episode-3-explained-brady-bunch-pietro-neighbors.html |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}</ref>
