The '''patella''', also known as the '''kneecap''', is a flat, rounded triangular [[bone]] which articulates with the [[femur]] (thigh bone) and covers and protects the anterior articular surface of the [[knee]] [[joint]]. The patella is found in many tetrapods, such as  [[mouse|mice]], [[cat]]s, [[bird]]s and [[dog]]s, but not in [[whale]]s, or most [[reptile]]s.

In humans, the patella is the largest [[sesamoid bone]] in the body. Babies are born with a patella of soft [[cartilage]] which begins to [[ossify]] into bone at about four years of age.

== Structure ==
The patella is a [[sesamoid bone]] roughly triangular in shape, with the apex of the patella facing downwards. The apex is the most [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|inferior]] (lowest) part of the patella. It is pointed in shape, and gives attachment to the [[patellar ligament]].

The front and back surfaces are joined by a thin margin and towards centre by a thicker margin.<ref name="Platzer-194">{{cite book

}}</ref> The [[tendon]] of the [[quadriceps femoris muscle]] attaches to the base of the patella.,<ref name="Platzer-194" /> with the [[vastus intermedius]] muscle attaching to the base itself, and the [[vastus lateralis]] and [[vastus medialis]] are attached to outer lateral and medial borders of patella respectively.

The upper third of the front of the patella is coarse, flattened, and rough, and serves for the attachment of the tendon of the quadriceps and often has [[Exostosis|exostoses]]. The middle third has numerous [[vascular]] [[Canaliculus (bone)|canaliculi]]. The lower third culminates in the apex which serves as the origin of the [[patellar ligament]].<ref name="Platzer-194" /> The posterior surface is divided into two parts.<ref name="Platzer-194" /><!-- ref for section -->

The upper three-quarters of the patella [[joint|articulates]] with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.

In the adult the articular surface is about {{convert|12|cm2|sqin|abbr=on}} and covered by [[cartilage]], which can reach a maximal thickness of {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the centre at about 30 years of age. Owing to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee flexion, the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body.

The lower part of the posterior surface has vascular canaliculi filled and is filled by fatty tissue, the [[infrapatellar fat pad]].

===Variation===
[[File:Patella bipartita.jpg|thumbnail|In this [[X-ray]], an [[human body#anatomical variation|anatomical variation]] of the patella can be seen – the [[Patella bipartita|bipartate patella]], in which the patella is split into two parts. ]]
Emarginations (i.e. ''patella emarginata'', a "missing piece") are common laterally on the proximal edge.<ref name="Platzer-194" /><!-- ref for section --> [[Bipartite patella]]s are the result of an ossification of a second [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] layer at the location of an emargination.  Previously, bipartite patellas were explained as the failure of several ossification centres to fuse, but this idea has been rejected.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Partite patellas occur almost exclusively in men.  Tripartite and even multipartite patellas occur.

The upper three-quarters of the patella [[joint|articulates]] with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.  Four main types of articular surface can be distinguished:
# Most commonly the medial articular surface is smaller than the lateral.
# Sometimes both articular surfaces are virtually equal in size.
# Occasionally, the medial surface is [[Hypoplasia|hypoplastic]] or
# the central ledge is only indicated.

=== Development===
In the patella an [[ossification]] centre develops at the age of 3–6 years.<ref name="Platzer-194" /> The patella originates from two centres of ossification which unite when fully formed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Function ==
The primary functional role of the patella is knee extension. The patella increases the [[lever]]age that the [[quadriceps tendon]] can exert on the femur by increasing the angle at which it acts.

The patella is attached to the [[tendon]] of the [[quadriceps femoris muscle]], which contracts to extend/straighten the [[knee]]. The patella is stabilized by the insertion of the horizontal fibres of [[vastus medialis]] and by the prominence of the [[Lateral condyle of femur|lateral femoral condyle]], which discourages lateral dislocation during flexion. The retinacular fibres of the patella also stabilize it during exercise.

==Clinical significance==

===Dislocation===
{{Main|Patellar dislocation}}
[[Patellar dislocation]]s occur with significant regularity, particularly in young female athletes.<ref name=palmu2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Palmu | first1 = S. | last2 = Kallio | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Donell | first3 = S.T. | last4 = Helenius | first4 = I. | last5 = Nietosvaara | first5 = Y. | year = 2008 | title = Acute patellar dislocation in children and adolescents: A randomized clinical trial | journal = Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery | volume = 90 | issue = 3| pages = 463–470 | doi = 10.2106/JBJS.G.00072 | pmid = 18310694 }}</ref> It involves the patella sliding out of its position on the knee, most often laterally, and may be associated with extremely intense pain and swelling.<ref name=dath2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Dath | first1 = R. | last2 = Chakravarthy | first2 = J. | last3 = Porter | first3 = K.M. | year = 2006 | title = Patella Dislocations | journal = Trauma | volume = 8 | pages = 5–11 | doi = 10.1191/1460408606ta353ra | s2cid = 208269986 }}</ref> The patella can be tracked back into the groove with an extension of the knee, and therefore sometimes returns into the proper position on its own.<ref name=dath2006/>

A ''patella alta'' is a high-riding (superiorly aligned) patella. An [[attenuated patella alta]] is an unusually small patella that develops out of and above the [[joint]].

A ''patella baja'' is a low-riding patella. A long-standing patella baja may result in extensor dysfunction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/patella-baja|title=Patella baja|author=Yuranga Weerakkody and Frank Gaillard|website=[[Radiopaedia]]|access-date=2018-01-16}}</ref>

The ''Insall-Salvati ratio'' helps to indicate patella baja on lateral [[Projectional radiography|X-rays]], and is calculated as the patellar tendon length divided by the patellar bone length. An Insall-Salvati ratio of [[Less than|<]] 0.8 indicates patella baja.<ref name=Dennis2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.orthobullets.com/recon/5018/tka-in-patella-baja-infera|title=TKA in Patella Baja (Infera)|website=Orthobullets|author=Douglas Dennis|date=2017-02-25|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

===Fracture===
{{main|Patella fracture}}
The kneecap is prone to injury because of its particularly exposed location, and [[patella fracture|fractures of the patella]] commonly occur as a consequence of direct trauma onto the knee. These fractures usually cause swelling and pain in the region, bleeding into the joint ([[hemarthrosis]]), and an inability to extend the knee. Patella fractures are usually treated with surgery, unless the damage is minimal and the extensor mechanism is intact.<ref name=efort>{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=G|title=European Surgical Orthopaedics and Traumatology: The EFORT Textbook|date=2014|publisher=Springer|pages=2766–2784|isbn=978-3642347450}}</ref>

===Exostosis===
An [[exostosis]] is the formation of new bone onto a bone, as a result of excess [[calcium]] formation. This can be the cause of chronic pain when formed on the patella.

==In animals==
The patella is found in [[Eutheria|placental mammals]] and birds; most marsupials have only rudimentary, non-ossified patellae although a few species possess a bony patella.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Herzmark MH| title=The Evolution of the Knee Joint| url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/20/1/77.pdf| access-date=2007-11-17| journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am| year=1938| volume=20| pages=77–84| issue=1| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217070015/http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/20/1/77.pdf| archive-date=2008-12-17}}</ref> A patella is also present in the living monotremes, the platypus and the echidna. In more primitive tetrapods, including living amphibians and most reptiles (except some Lepidosaurs), the muscle tendons from the upper leg are attached directly to the [[tibia]], and a patella is not present.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|page= 205|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref> In 2017 it was discovered that [[frog]]s have kneecaps, contrary to what was thought. This raises the possibility that the kneecap arose 400 million years ago when tetrapods first appeared, but that it disappeared in some animals.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Frogs have hidden, ancient kneecaps|journal=New Scientist|date=Jul 15, 2017|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23531342-300}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Virginia Abdala|display-authors=etal|title=On the presence of the patella in frogs|journal=The Anatomical Record|volume=300|issue=10|pages=1747–1755|date=Jul 2017|doi=10.1002/ar.23629|pmid=28667673|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''patella'' originated in the late 17th century from the [[diminutive]] form of [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|patina}}'' or ''{{lang|la|patena}}'' or ''paten'', meaning shallow dish.<ref>''New Shorter Oxford''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=patella|title=patella - Origin and meaning of patella by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>
