The group formed in 2001 and signed with [[Drive-Thru Records]] in 2002. {{As of|2018}}, they have released two [[Extended play|EPs]]: ''[[For All of This]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Acoustic EP (The Early November album)|The Acoustic EP]]'' (2005). They have released four full-length [[album]]s: ''[[The Room's Too Cold]]'' (2003), [[triple album]] ''[[The Mother, the Mechanic, and the Path]]'' (2006), ''[[In Currents]]'' (2012), and ''[[Imbue (album)|Imbue]]'' (2015). Their most recent album, ''[[Lilac (The Early November album)|Lilac]]'', was released September 27, 2019. The band is currently signed to [[Rise Records]].

==History==

===Formation and ''For All of This'' EP (1999–2002)===
The band was formed by singer and guitarist [[Arthur Enders]], [[bassist]] Sergio Anello, [[drummer]] Jeff Kummer, and [[guitarist]] Jim Sacco in Hammonton, New Jersey. Together, they recorded a five-track demo in Enders' basement and sent it, along with a poorly edited videotape, to only one label, [[Drive-Thru Records]].

Both Sacco and Anello left the band for personal reasons and were replaced by Steve Nakovich ([[guitar]]) and Mike Klemash ([[bass guitar|bass]]). The band got in touch with Drive-Thru founder [[Richard Reines]], who agreed to meet with the band to give advice. Upon returning to California, Reines discussed a possible signing with Drive-Thru co-owner Stefanie Reines. During this time, there was another lineup change that saw Anello return to the band, replacing Klemash, and Joe Marro replacing Nakovich. A few weeks later, Drive-Thru signed The Early November and put them, despite their practically non-existent stage experience, on 2002's Skate and Surf Fest and on selected dates of the [[Warped Tour]]. In August, former members of the band, as well as the June Spirit, formed Finding Westerly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/4097/ex-members-of-june-spirit-and-early-november-are-finding-westerly|title=Ex Members of June Spirit and Early November are Finding Westerly|publisher=Punknews.org|author=Heisel, Scott|date=August 20, 2002|accessdate=February 28, 2021}}</ref>

Marro left the band before the recording of their debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[For All of This]]'' and was replaced by John Dubitsky. The EP came out on Drive-Thru Records in December 2002. Enders recorded ''[[The Acoustic EP (The Early November album)|The Acoustic EP]]'' on his own, featuring acoustic versions of most songs off of their debut EP, releasing it two months later. Simultaneously, guitarist Marro re-joined the band in exchange for Dubitsky.

===Early success and ''The Room's Too Cold'' (2003-2005)===
In April and May 2003, the group went on a tour of the US with [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/5429/brand-new-tour-change|title=Brand New tour change|work=Punknews.org|publisher=Aubin Paul|author=Heisel, Scott|date=February 28, 2003|access-date=April 24, 2018}}</ref> Throughout 2003, the band continued to tour and write songs in preparation for their first full-length CD ''[[The Room's Too Cold]]'', which was released in fall of that year. Soon afterwards, Enders recorded a solo record under the name [[I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business]]. The CD was almost scrapped due to Enders wanting to focus on The Early November.

===Triple disc album and hiatus (2006–2010)===
During the recording process of their triple album, ''The Mother, The Mechanic, The Path'', guitar tech Bill Lugg joined the band as a third guitarist.

''[[The Mother, the Mechanic, and the Path]]'' was released on July 11, 2006. The album subsequently debuted at number 31 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for the week ending July 21. This was the band's highest charting album to date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-early-november|title=The Early November|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

On March 13, 2007, The Early November posted an announcement on their website that they "will be taking an indefinite hiatus" following their last headlining tour with [[The Rocket Summer]] and [[Mêlée (band)|Mêlée]] and The Verdict / Nothing Ever Stays and two farewell shows in April. The first night, the last song played was "I Want To Hear You Sad". On the second night, the last song played at their final headlining show at the Trocadero in Philadelphia, PA was "Truth Is". Their last show prior to the hiatus was played on May 6 at [[The Bamboozle]] festival in New Jersey.

In May 2009, Kumer posted on his Twitter that he and Enders were going to discuss getting the band back together. One week later, Enders addressed the rumors, stating, "it seems like most of you understand now that Jeff's comment last week about the band getting back together wasn't true, but the responses I've seen got me thinking".<ref>{{cite web |title=Ace Enders Addresses Early November Reunion Rumors (June 15, 2009) : News : PlugInMusic.com |url=http://www.pluginmusic.com/news/article/ace-enders-addresses-early-november-reunion-rumors |website=Pluginmusic.com |access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>

It was rumored that Enders and Anello were planning to play songs from The Early November on their band I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business' tour in summer 2009, which subsequently turned out to be true.

===Reunion and ''In Currents'' (2011-2012)===
On June 22, 2011, Ace Enders and Jeff Kummer both announced that The Early November would be performing a concert at The Electric Factory in Philadelphia, PA on September 10. This was their first show together in 4 years and had sold out. Additionally, they added a concert at the Starland Ballroom on November 26. It was confirmed at this show that they were in the recording process of a new album at Enders' recording studio, The Living Room.<ref>[http://www.the1stfive.com/news/the-early-november-announce-new-album] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>

===''Imbue'' and ''Lilac'' (2013-present)===
At their Room's Too Cold anniversary show at Bowery Ballroom in New York City on December 18, 2013, it was announced that they had been trying to keep quiet that they are working on a new album. They played a new song, titled "Better This Way", to start their second set.

On May 12, 2015, the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Imbue (album)|Imbue]]''.
