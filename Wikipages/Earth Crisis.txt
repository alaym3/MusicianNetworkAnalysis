=== Subsequent years and breakup: (1996–2001) ===

1996's ''[[Gomorrah's Season Ends]]'' brought a more complex and developed form of metalcore and, shortly thereafter, they were asked to take part in the inaugural [[Ozzfest]], including one song for its [[Ozzfest Live|live album]]. Their popularity grew, resulting in a deal with [[Roadrunner Records]], and the band released ''[[Breed the Killers]]'' in 1998, the first with guitarist Erick Edwards (bassist Ian Edwards's brother) replacing Wiechmann.  The album was produced by [[Andy Sneap]] and featured a guest appearance by [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] vocalist and guitarist [[Robb Flynn]].<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="roadrunner">{{cite web|access-date=October 6, 2017|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/EarthCrisis/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821101108/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/EarthCrisis/|archive-date=August 21, 2010|title=Earth Crisis|website=[[Roadrunner Records]]}}</ref> 

The band later returned to [[Victory Records]], releasing 2000's ''[[Slither (album)|Slither]]'' soon after. With more emphasis on production and a change of style steered towards [[nu metal]], it drew mixed reactions from critics and fans but had a wider exposure in mainstream music.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name=decibel>{{cite web|access-date=October 3, 2017|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2017/05/24/justify-your-shitty-taste-earth-crisis-s-slither/|title=Justify Your Shitty Taste: Earth Crisis's "Slither"|first=Shawn|last=Macomber|date=May 24, 2017|website=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171003141740/https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2017/05/24/justify-your-shitty-taste-earth-crisis-s-slither/|archive-date=October 3, 2017}}</ref> Their final album before their breakup was 2001's ''[[Last of the Sane]]'', which included [[cover version]]s of songs by [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Slayer]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Dead Kennedys]].

In 2001, Earth Crisis disbanded on good terms because some members could no longer engage in a full-time touring band due to their personal lives.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=October 2, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up-E5d0Htfk|format=video|title=Earth Crisis Interview with B-Sides|date=July 1, 2009|first=Andrea |last=Garcia|publisher=b-sides.tv|website=YouTube}}</ref> They played the final show of their initial career at [[Hellfest (punk festival)|Hellfest]] in Syracuse.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="web.archive.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.earthcrisis.us/ |title=the unofficial earth crisis website |date=October 29, 2007 |access-date=August 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029153856/http://www.earthcrisis.us/ |archive-date=October 29, 2007 }}</ref> After the band's breakup in 2001, Buechner, Bulldog and Erick Edwards went on to form [[Freya (band)|Freya]], a band named for the [[Freya|Norse goddess of fertility]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=October 2, 2017|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/3699/Freya|title=Freya Bio|website=Thegauntlet.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502112808/http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/3699/Freya|archive-date=May 2, 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, Crouse and Dennis Merrick moved to California and formed the group Isolated.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=October 12, 2017|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/isolated-former-earth-crisis-guitarist-returns-with-new-project/|title=ISOLATED: Former EARTH CRISIS Guitarist Returns With New Project|date=October 2, 2004|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171012113122/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/isolated-former-earth-crisis-guitarist-returns-with-new-project/|archive-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref>

=== Reformation (2007–2009) ===

On January 27, 2007, the reunited Earth Crisis played the Maryland Metal and Hardcore Festival. Although it was originally planned as a one-off concert, numerous American and European dates followed thereafter. Earth Crisis headlined the Firestorm Fest in early 2008.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=October 4, 2017|url=https://www.cityweekly.net/utah/music-new-york-hardcore-legends-earth-crisis-pick-up-where-they-left-off/Content?oid=2133425|title=Music {{!}} New York hardcore legends Earth Crisis pick up where they left off|date=March 5, 2008|first=Trevor|last=Hale|website=[[Salt Lake City Weekly]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171004192139/https://www.cityweekly.net/utah/music-new-york-hardcore-legends-earth-crisis-pick-up-where-they-left-off/Content?oid=2133425|archive-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref>

On September 10, 2008 it was announced that they had signed a worldwide deal with Century Media.

== Musical style and influences ==
Although ideologically tied to the [[straight edge]] movement, the initial musical influences of Earth Crisis were mainly from [[New York hardcore]] bands such as [[Agnostic Front]], [[Cro-Mags]] and [[Sick Of It All]].<ref name="hc-p">{{cite magazine|access-date=September 26, 2017|url=https://www.hardcore-punk.net/interview/16/earth-crisis|title=EARTH CRISIS - par Aaron Burgess - juillet 1996|first=Aaron |last=Burgess|publisher=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|issue=101|website=Hardcore-punk.net|date=July 1996|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170923105529/https://www.hardcore-punk.net/interview/16/earth-crisis|archive-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref> After the ''All Out War'' EP, they developed an increasingly technical and heavier style, citing [[death metal]] bands [[Napalm Death]], [[Bolt Thrower]] and [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]] as prime inspirations.<ref name=am/><ref name="hc-p"/> Buechner's vocals became rougher with each release as well, culminating in the completely [[Death growl|gutturally screamed]] ''Gomorrah's Season Ends''.
