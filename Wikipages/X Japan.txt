{{nihongo|'''X Japan'''|エックス・ジャパン|Ekkusu Japan|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], formed in 1982 by drummer [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] and lead vocalist [[Toshi (musician)|Toshi]]. Starting as a predominantly [[power metal|power]]/[[speed metal]] band with heavy [[Symphonic metal|symphonic]] elements, they later gravitated towards a [[progressive metal|progressive]] sound with an emphasis on ballads. Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, the group is widely credited as one of the pioneers of [[visual kei]], a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western [[glam rock|glam]].

Originally named {{nihongo4|'''X'''|エックス|Ekkusu}}, they released their debut album ''[[Vanishing Vision]]'' (1988) on Yoshiki's own [[Extasy Records]] one year after finalizing their line-up including bassist [[Taiji (musician)|Taiji]], lead guitarist [[Hide (musician)|Hide]] and rhythm guitarist [[Pata (musician)|Pata]]. They achieved breakthrough success in 1989 with the release of their second and major debut album ''[[Blue Blood (X Japan album)|Blue Blood]]''. Following 1991's ''[[Jealousy (X Japan album)|Jealousy]]'', Taiji left the band in early 1992. He was replaced by [[Heath (musician)|Heath]] and the group changed their name to X Japan before producing the mini album ''[[Art of Life]]'' (1993), which is composed solely of the 29-minute title track. In 1995 the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look and released ''[[Dahlia (album)|Dahlia]]'' (1996), which like their two previous albums debuted at number one. X Japan performed their last concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]] on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive sold-out New Year's Eve concerts the group held at the stadium.

After ten years, X Japan reunited in 2007 and recorded the new song "[[I.V. (X Japan song)|I.V.]]". Over the next two years they performed several concerts, including their first overseas show in Hong Kong, and formally added [[Sugizo]] as lead guitarist in place of Hide, who died in 1998, before holding a North American tour in 2010. In 2011, the band went on their first world tour throughout Europe, South America and Asia. Shortly after reuniting, work began on their [[Untitled X Japan album|sixth studio album]]. During its ten years of production, several release dates were announced, but it remains unreleased despite Yoshiki's claim of its completion in September 2018.

X Japan has released five studio albums, six live albums, and 21 singles. In 2003, [[HMV Group|HMV Japan]] ranked the band at number 40 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. In 2007, ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone Japan]]'' ranked ''Blue Blood'' number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time.<ref>{{cite web| title = Finally!

In 1977, [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] and [[Toshi (musician)|Toshi]] formed a band called Dynamite in their hometown of [[Tateyama, Chiba]], when they were just 11 years old.

X Japan's music developed in the wake of American and British [[glam metal|glam]] and [[heavy metal music]], and is characterized by driving [[speed metal|speed]]/[[power metal]] compositions with [[symphonic metal|symphonic]] elements (e.g. "[[Kurenai (song)|Kurenai]]", "[[Silent Jealousy]]") and emotional [[Ballad (music)|ballad]]s (e.g. "[[Endless Rain]]", "[[Forever Love (X Japan song)|Forever Love]]").<ref name="NYTimes"/><ref name="asiaarts_x_best">{{cite web|last=Minnie |first=Chi |title=''X Japan Best'' review |work=Asia Pacific Arts Online Magazine |url=http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=7936 |access-date=2007-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011140930/http://asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=7936 |archive-date=October 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="amg_bio">{{cite web| last = Seida| first = Linda| title = X Japan biography at Allmusic| work = allmusic.com| url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p320432|pure_url=yes}}| access-date = 2007-08-06}}</ref> Many of the group's songs make use of [[orchestra]]ted passages, particularly on longer tracks such as the ten and a half minute "[[Tears (X Japan song)|Tears]]", "[[Crucify My Love]]", and the twenty-nine-minute "[[Art of Life]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavymetaltribune.com/2011/01/album-review-x-japan-art-of-life-live/|title=Album Review: X Japan – Art of Life (Live)|publisher=Heavy Metal Tribune|access-date=2017-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418165308/http://www.heavymetaltribune.com/2011/01/album-review-x-japan-art-of-life-live/|archive-date=April 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The majority of the band's lyrics are in Japanese, the band's native language, however many instances show the lyrics alternating from Japanese to English and back. Examples of this include the spoken-word background vocals during the bridge of "[[Rusty Nail (song)|Rusty Nail]]", and multiple lines (including the entire pre-chorus) of the song "[[Week End (X Japan song)|Week End]]". The first recorded version of "Kurenai" from ''[[Vanishing Vision]]'' contains lyrics entirely in English.

The majority of the band's catalog of music was written by [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] with relatively little composition from the other members. [[hide (musician)|Hide]] contributed several songs, including the single "[[Scars (X Japan song)|Scars]]", while [[Pata (musician)|Pata]]'s only claim is "White Wind from Mr. Martin ~Pata's Nap~". [[Toshi (musician)|Toshi]]'s contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs. [[Taiji (musician)|Taiji]] contributed music to a couple of songs, notably "Voiceless Screaming" from the album ''[[Jealousy (X Japan album)|Jealousy]]'', for which, when performed live, he played the acoustic guitar, and "Desperate Angel".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000071641 |script-title=ja:TAIJIこと沢田泰司よ、永遠なれ|date=2011-07-17 |publisher=Barks|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-18}}</ref> [[Heath (musician)|Heath]]'s only writing credit is the instrumental song "Wriggle" on the 1996 album ''[[Dahlia (album)|Dahlia]]'', which he wrote with Pata.

Of songs from the band's lesser-known former members, only the track "Time Trip Loving" from the single "Orgasm", composed by Jun with Toshi writing the lyrics, was officially released.

Yoshiki's songwriting process is unusual in that he writes the [[Sheet music|score]] for each song by hand before beginning to play it with the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/music/yoshiki-of-x-japan-talks-future-musical-inspirations-technology/article/543038|title=Yoshiki of X Japan talks future, musical inspirations, technology|last=Papadatos|first=Markos|date=2019-02-12|website=Digital Journal|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref> His composing style tends to make use of chords in sequences of eights or more with riff-based motifs or call-and-response style phrasing. He has maintained this style for the majority of his career as a composer. Having played classical piano since he was four years old, Yoshiki claims to be as influenced by classical music as he is by rock. While also serving as the main songwriter, Yoshiki has production credit on much of X Japan's later material. During live performances, the band relies on its members (with drummer and pianist Yoshiki and guitarist and violinist Sugizo switching between their instruments) and prerecorded tracks for [[String section|orchestrated strings]], [[spoken word]] passages, and more recently, some of Hide's guitar parts.<ref name="wowow_live_2008-03-28"/>

[[Visual kei]] artists still often employ feminine looks and garbs for their stage.<ref name="Yun2">{{cite book|author=Josephine Yun|title=Jrock, Ink.: A Concise Report on 40 of the Biggest Rock Acts in Japan|chapter=Introduction|page=[https://archive.org/details/jrockinkconciser0000yunj/page/11 11]|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|isbn=9781880656952|year=2005|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/jrockinkconciser0000yunj/page/11}}</ref><ref name="Yun">{{cite book|author=Josephine Yun|title=Jrock, Ink.: A Concise Report on 40 of the Biggest Rock Acts in Japan|chapter=X Japan|page=[https://archive.org/details/jrockinkconciser0000yunj/page/110 110]|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|isbn=9781880656952|year=2005|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/jrockinkconciser0000yunj/page/110}}</ref><ref name="GlobalGlam">{{cite book|title=Global Glam and Popular Music: Style and Spectacle from the 1970s to the 2000s|pages=203–205|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RY-PCwAAQBAJ&q=X+Japan+androgynous+look&pg=PA204|editor= Ian Chapman, Henry Johnson|year=2016|isbn=9781317588191}}</ref><ref name="dazed" /> According to Josephine Yun, "like its music, X's look was individualistic. Square-shouldered Toshi donned leather and metal, looking like a character out of the anime ''[[Gundam]]''. Taiji dolled up in perfect, pretty glam. Pata's sleepy, backseat demeanor and whiskey bottle became his trademark, as Hide forever goaded the audience. And Yoshiki was a paradox all his own, bewitchingly effeminate one moment — and a full-force, wrist-breaking (literally) hurricane in concert the next."<ref name="Yun" /> [[Will Hodgkinson]] of ''[[The Times]]'' described X Japan as having, "the grandiosity of Queen, the heavy-metal hysteria of [[Iron Maiden]] and the symphonic sophistication of classical music, all tied up with a healthy dose of melodrama."<ref name="The Times"/>

Their early image was characterized by heavy [[make-up]], dark [[eyeliner]] and [[eyeshadow]], face-painting and high-standing hair, which one critic described as "skyscraper hair". Yoshiki's highly [[androgyny|androgynous]] looks, dressed in [[lace]] and pearls, were referred to as "decadent". The band also used accessories reminiscent of glam-[[Goth subculture|goth]] (metal jewelry, crosses). Their stage reflected the band's duality in nature: the forceful, "masculine" [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] songs were balanced out by Toshi's high-pitched [[tenor]] voice and Yoshiki's soft piano playing, where he would often wear long female dresses, and act effeminate.<ref name="GlobalGlam"/>

By the release of their 1995 studio album ''[[Dahlia (album)|Dahlia]]'', the band toned its stage appearance down, cutting their hair and wearing more rock-inspired outfits.<ref name="GlobalGlam"/> In a 2010 interview, Yoshiki stated that the abandoning of stronger make-up and outrageous outfits was a natural progression in their style, however, they still do use make-up on stage, "sometimes heavy, sometimes less", and that he still considers the band visual kei.<ref name="Metalsucks">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/10/08/exclusive-interview-with-x-japans-yoshiki-hayashi/|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH X JAPAN'S YOSHIKI HAYASHI|date=2010-10-08|access-date=2017-04-18 |publisher=MetalSucks}}</ref>

** Although Hide and Taiji are deceased, the band still considers them members and introduces them at every concert, with the group going as far as to play audio/video clips of their voice/guitar for some songs.<!-- Please refrain from moving hide and Taiji to current members. They are deceased therefore cannot physically be in the band. There is a note stating that the band considers them current members, this is sufficient enough. All edits moving them to current members will automatically be marked as vandalism (which could lead to an IP ban for the address through which the edit originated, if multiple offenses continue) and reverted to the previous article version, upon review.-->
