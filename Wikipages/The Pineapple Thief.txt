'''The Pineapple Thief''' is a British [[progressive rock]] [[band (music)|band]], started by Bruce Soord in 1999 in [[Somerset]], England. The band has released thirteen studio albums.

==History==
===Early years===
Founder Bruce Soord started The Pineapple Thief as an outlet for his music back in 1999. Soord released the debut ''[[Abducting the Unicorn]]'' on Cyclops Records, which created enough interest to establish a small but loyal fan base. Soord returned to the Dining Room studios to work on the second album ''[[137 (album)|137]]''.

During this time, several major labels started to take an interest, causing a delay in the release which arrived over two years after the debut. However, it was debatably the third album, ''[[Variations on a Dream]]'' that gave the band the boost it needed, reaching out to yet more people all over the world, by which point they were consistently the top sellers on their label, Cyclops.

After this release in the spring of 2002 Bruce decided to form a band to take his music to the fans. The band consisted of his close musical friends – former university bandmate Jon Sykes on bass, Wayne Higgins on guitars, Matt O'Leary on keyboards and Keith Harrison on drums. As a full band, they released ''[[10 Stories Down|12 Stories Down]]'' in 2004, but Bruce Soord was unhappy with the final sound and re-recorded, remixed and changed some of the tracks before the release of ''[[10 Stories Down]]'' in 2005. Matt O'Leary subsequently left the band, but Steve Kitch (who co-produced and mixed ''10 Stories Down'') joined to play keyboards.

Following the release of ''[[Little Man (album)|Little Man]]'' in 2006, the band released ''[[What We Have Sown]]'' in late 2007 as a final Cyclops release before being signed to [[Kscope]], a division of [[Snapper Music]]. In 2007 The Pineapple Thief's music featured on the final Episode of the MTV show [[The Hills (season 3)]].  The song 'Snowdrops' can be heard on episode 28 during a scene between Lauren & Jo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tunefind.com/artist/the-pineapple-thief|title=Music by The Pineapple Thief|website=Tunefind.com|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>

Wayne Higgins left the band in March 2008, but the group continued as a four-piece live act, playing gigs across Europe, Canada and the US throughout much of the following years.

===The Kscope years===
[[File:The Pineapple Thief in Mexico City (2019).jpg|alt=The Pineapple Thief playing at Lunario in Mexico City (2019)|thumb|358x358px|The Pineapple Thief playing at Lunario in Mexico City (2019)]]
In May 2008, The Pineapple Thief helped relaunch the Kscope label with the critically acclaimed album ''[[Tightly Unwound]]'', which was marked by launch shows at Witchwood in Manchester on 17 May 2008 and at the Water Rats Theatre in London on 22 May 2008. The same day as the album's release, a mini-documentary filmed at The Half Moon, London, was released through the band's website, featuring interviews and two exclusive live tracks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pineapplethief.com/news.php |title=Latest news |publisher=Pineapple Thief |accessdate=2011-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69pO9Srr6?url=http://www.pineapplethief.com/tpt/ |archivedate=11 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

This was followed in 2009 by The Dawn Raids EPs and ''3000 Days'', a 2-CD re-mixed and re-mastered collection of songs from their ten-year history to date. In January 2010, their 2006 album, ''Little Man'' was also fully remixed by Bruce Soord and Steve Kitch and released through Kscope with new artwork. There are plans to gradually give all of their back catalogue the same treatment as the Cyclops albums are no longer available and sell for large sums in the second-hand market. 2009 also saw them supporting [[Riverside (Band)|Riverside]] on the UK leg of their European tour.

''[[Someone Here Is Missing]]'' was launched at a show at Bush Hall, London on 19 May 2010, whose attendees included Kscope labelmates [[Steven Wilson]] of [[Porcupine Tree]] and [[Daniel Cavanagh]] of [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/thepineapplethief/someonehereismissing/welcome.php |title=The Pineapple Thief's Someone Here is Missing |publisher=Kscopemusic.com |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> The album also features artwork by the legendary designer [[Storm Thorgerson]].  The album continues to nurture the band's trademark ‘bittersweet’ progressive sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/reviews/article/the-pineapple-thief-someone-here-is-missing |title=The Pineapple Thief – Someone Here is Missing |date=29 June 2010 |publisher=[[Rock Sound]] |accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>

2010 saw a number of European festival appearances and a full 2-week tour of mainland Europe.  This was recorded and released as the download-only album ''Someone Here Is Live''.

The band entered the studio in January 2012 to record their ninth album, which included (for the first time) a 22-piece orchestra and choir. ''[[All the Wars]]'' was released in September 2012 and followed by a UK tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://love-it-loud.com/interviews/bruce-soord-the-pineapple-thief/ |title=Interview – Bruce Soord |website=Love-It-Loud.com |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

On 8 February 2014 the band announced that Dan Osborne had replaced Keith Harrison on drums.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)-->

The Pineapple Thief's tenth studio album, ''[[Magnolia (The Pineapple Thief album)|Magnolia]]'', was released on 15 September 2014. It peaked at number 55 on [[UK Album Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/artists/thepineapplethief/|title=Kscope - The Pineapple Thief|website=Kscopemusic.com|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>

In August 2016 the band released the album ''[[Your Wilderness (The Pineapple Thief album)|Your Wilderness]]'', featuring [[Gavin Harrison]] on drums, through Kscope.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rebelnoi.se/reviews/your-wilderness|title=Rebel Noise – Your Wilderness|website=Rebelnoi.se|access-date=2016-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/2016/05/10/the-pineapple-thief-returns-with-new-album-your-wilderness/|title=Kscope - The Pineapple Thief returns with new album ‘Your Wilderness’|website=Kscopemusic.com|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>

On the last day of August 2018, the band released their 12th studio album, ''[[Dissolution (The Pineapple Thief album)|Dissolution]]''. [[Gavin Harrison]] returns on drums, this time taking a more active role in the songwriting. The band will embark on a European tour in September, with Gavin Harrison on drums and George Marios on guitars, and LiZzard as the support act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/artists/thepineapplethief/|title=Kscope - The Pineapple Thief|website=Kscopemusic.com|access-date=2018-04-14}}</ref>
