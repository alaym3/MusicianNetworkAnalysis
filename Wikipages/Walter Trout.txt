'''Walter Trout''' (born March 6, 1951, [[Ocean City, New Jersey]], United States<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p132889/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography by Jason Ankeny |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 21, 2009}}</ref>) is an American [[blues]] guitarist, singer and songwriter.

==Biography==
Trout's career began on the Jersey coast scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s. He then decided to relocate to [[Los Angeles]] where he became a [[sideman]] for [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Percy Mayfield]], Big Mama Thornton, [[Joe Tex]], and many others.

Between 1981 and 1984, he was the lead guitarist in [[Canned Heat]].<ref name="AMG"/> He toured with them extensively in the US, Europe, and Australia. From 1984 to 1989, he was the lead guitarist in [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] following in the footsteps of guitarists like [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] and [[Eric Clapton]]. Trout recorded and toured with the Bluesbreakers all over the world. The many successes on stage were accompanied with a self-destructive lifestyle offstage. Trout recalled in a 2018 interview with Blues Radio International that while playing with John Mayall, he was rescued from a complete descent into alcohol and substance abuse by a post-gig encounter with [[Carlos Santana]].<ref>{{cite AV media |people= Walter Trout, Mike Zito |date= Mar 26, 2018|title= Carlos Santana, Walter Trout & Mike Zito: One Life Saves Another.. And Another |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-z2yckSdUs|access-date=March 26, 2020 |publisher= Blues Radio International}}</ref>

Trout left the Bluesbreakers in 1989 and formed the 'Walter Trout Band' which developed a successful following in Europe, especially Scandinavia where he found himself playing to large festival crowds such as at the [[Midtfyns Festival]] and [[Skanderborg Festival]]. ''[[The Times]]'' named Trout's first solo album, ''Life in the Jungle'', "the greatest album in the history of the blues-rock genre."{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Between 1990 and 1992, Trout's first two albums sold over 100,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-11-05-ol-1537-story.html|title=LOOKING FOR BIGGER FISH TO FRY : The Walter Trout Band Heads for the Mainstream|date=November 5, 1992|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>

In 1991, his song, "The Love That We Once Knew" climbed the charts in the Netherlands leading to a Top 10 radio hit. Performances at [[Parkpop|Park Pop]] and [[Pinkpop Festival|Pink Pop]] solidified his status there. When home between tours and until 2005, Trout hosted all-night jams with his celebrity friends in Huntington Beach. Such jams featured [[Richie Hayward]] (Little Feat), [[Jesse Ed Davis]], [[Mick Taylor]], [[John Mayall]], [[Garth Hudson]], [[Billy Gibbons]], [[TM Stevens]], [[Teena Marie]], and many more.

In 1994, the official Walter Trout Fan Club for the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] was founded, followed in 1996 by the official International Fan Club which had members in 14 countries in Europe, America, Asia and Australia.

In 1998, Trout released his self-titled US debut album and renamed his band 'Walter Trout and the Free Radicals' (later renamed 'Walter Trout and the Radicals' and currently simply 'Walter Trout'). Since, Trout has been recording prolifically and touring in North and Central America, Europe, Australia, and India.

In 2002, he was featured on the [[Bo Diddley]] [[tribute album]], ''Hey Bo Diddley – A Tribute!'', performing the song "[[Road Runner (Bo Diddley song)|Road Runner]]" and many more guest appearances on other [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]].

In June 2013, while touring Germany, Trout got the first signs that he was suffering from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]]. With his health deteriorating, he continued to tour until told he needed a liver transplant within 90 days.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Leadbetter|first1=Russell|title=Herald Scotland|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/13166507.Rescued_From_Reality__The_Life_And_Times_Of_Walter_Trout_By_Henry_Yates_and_Walter_Trout_MLG____19_95/|access-date=28 August 2016|date=2014-06-21}}</ref> Supported by donations from fans, his wife raised the money needed for them to move out of state for lengthy stays in order to qualify for transplantation in various states.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Nate |url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2014/08/walter_trout_coach_house_interview.php |title=How Walter Trout Cheated Death With Help From the Blues &#124; OC Weekly |website=Blogs.ocweekly.com |date=2014-08-01 |access-date=2016-05-25}}</ref> Trout recovered from his cirrhosis and subsequent liver transplant in a hospital bed for eight months, during which time he suffered from brain damage, which caused him to lose the ability to speak, play the guitar, and recognize his family.  Due to being bedridden, he also lost the use of his legs during this time. He had to relearn how to speak and walk. Trout has also stated that he spent eight hours a day over the course of a year to relearn how to play the guitar.<ref>{{Citation|title=Walter Trout 2018 04 21 Tampa, Florida - Skipper's Smokehouse - Full Show|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZUNJTdMkOw|language=en|access-date=2021-09-19}}</ref> By 2015, Trout had recovered and was able to go on tour in Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/walter-trout-talks-curry-blues-and-survival-ahead-of-rock-city-gig/story-29802250-detail/story.html|title=Walter Trout talks curry, blues and survival ahead of Rock City gig|date=2016-10-12|newspaper=[[Nottingham Post]]|access-date=2016-11-05}}</ref> His 2015 album, ''Battle Scars'', chronicled his battle with liver failure and the excruciating wait for a donated liver to become available. On May 26, 2014, Trout received the lifesaving operation.

Also in 2014, a documentary hosted by Dutch rock journalist TJ Lammers about Trout's life was released to coincide with Trout's album, ''When the Blues Came Calling''. At the same time, a
biography, ''Rescued From Reality'',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEePoAEACAAJ|title=Rescued from Reality: The Life and Times of Walter Trout|first1=Henry|last1=Yates|first2=Walter|last2=Trout|date=May 29, 2014|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9789082200201|via=Google Books}}</ref> co-written by British music journalist, Henry Yates, was

In 2015, Trout had recovered and returned to performing at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]].

In November 2015, Trout became a patron of [[The British Liver Trust]] to help raise awareness and much-needed funding for the cause. Trout, and his wife, Marie have helped raise awareness for Donate Life Nebraska and are also patrons of the Danish Liver Foundation,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://leverforeningen.dk/en/frontpage/|title=Frontpage|website=Danish Liver Association}}</ref> as well as Organdonation – Ja Tak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://organdonation-ja-tak.dk/|title=Organdonation - ja tak &#124; Vi forbedrer organdonation i Danmark!|website=Organdonation-ja-tak.dk}}</ref> "I'm only still here because someone donated their liver" he said.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}
