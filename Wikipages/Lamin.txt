'''Lamins''', also known as '''nuclear lamins''' are [[fibrous protein]]s in [[Intermediate filament#Type V-nuclear lamins|type V intermediate filaments]], providing structural function and [[Transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] regulation in the [[cell nucleus]]. Nuclear lamins interact with [[inner nuclear membrane protein]]s to form the [[nuclear lamina]] on the interior of the [[nuclear envelope]]. Lamins have elastic and mechanosensitive properties, and can alter [[gene regulation]] in a feedback response to mechanical cues.<ref name="Dutta">{{cite journal |last1=Dutta |first1=S |last2=Bhattacharyya |first2=M |last3=Sengupta |first3=K |title=Implications and Assessment of the Elastic Behavior of Lamins in Laminopathies. |journal=Cells |date=14 October 2016 |volume=5 |issue=4 |page=37 |doi=10.3390/cells5040037 |pmid=27754432|pmc=5187521 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Lamins are present in all [[animal]]s but are not found in [[microorganism]]s, [[plant]]s or [[fungus|fungi]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Dechat|first1=Thomas|last2=Adam|first2=Stephen A.|last3=Taimen|first3=Pekka|last4=Shimi|first4=Takeshi|last5=Goldman|first5=Robert D.|date=2016-11-24|title=Nuclear Lamins|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|volume=2|issue=11|pages=a000547|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a000547|issn=1943-0264|pmc=2964183|pmid=20826548}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Becker's World of the Cell, 9th Edition|last=Hardin Jeff|first=and Bertoni Gregory|publisher=Pearson|year=2016|isbn=9780321934925|location=Boston, MA}}</ref> Lamin proteins are involved in the disassembling and reforming of the nuclear envelope during [[mitosis]], the positioning of [[nuclear pore|nuclear pores]], and [[programmed cell death]].

== History ==
Lamins were first identified in the cell nucleus, using [[Electron microscope|electron-microscopy]]. However, they were not recognized as vital components of nuclear structural support until 1975.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Moir|first1=Robert D.|last2=Spann|first2=Timothy P.|last3=Lopez-Soler|first3=Reynold I.|last4=Yoon|first4=Miri|last5=Goldman|first5=Anne E.|last6=Khuon|first6=Satya|last7=Goldman|first7=Robert D.|date=2000-04-01|title=Review: The Dynamics of the Nuclear Lamins during the Cell Cycle— Relationship between Structure and Function|journal=Journal of Structural Biology|volume=129|issue=2|pages=324–334|doi=10.1006/jsbi.2000.4251|pmid=10806083}}</ref> During this time period, investigations of rat liver nuclei revealed that lamins have an architectural relationship with chromatin and nuclear pores.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Eriksson|first1=John E.|last2=Dechat|first2=Thomas|last3=Grin|first3=Boris|last4=Helfand|first4=Brian|last5=Mendez|first5=Melissa|last6=Pallari|first6=Hanna-Mari|last7=Goldman|first7=Robert D.|date=2009-07-01|title=Introducing intermediate filaments: from discovery to disease|journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation|language=en|volume=119|issue=7|pages=1763–71|doi=10.1172/JCI38339|issn=0021-9738|pmc=2701876|pmid=19587451}}</ref> Later in 1978, [[immunolabeling]] techniques revealed that lamins are localized at the nuclear envelope under the inner nuclear membrane. It wasn't until 1986 that an analysis of lamin [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] clones across a variety of species supported that lamins belong to the [[intermediate filament]] (IF) protein family.<ref name=":2" /> Further investigations found evidence that supports that all IF proteins arose from a common lamin-like ancestor. This theory is based on the observation that organisms that contain IF proteins necessarily contain lamins as well; however, the presence of lamins is not a requirement for simultaneously containing IF proteins. Furthermore, sequence comparisons between lamins and IF proteins support that an amino-acid sequence that is characteristic of lamins is found in early forms of IF proteins. This sequence is lost in later forms of IF proteins, suggesting that the structure of later intermediate filaments diverged.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Dittmer|first1=Travis A|last2=Misteli|first2=Tom|date=2011-01-01|title=The lamin protein family|journal=Genome Biology|volume=12|issue=5|pages=222|doi=10.1186/gb-2011-12-5-222|issn=1465-6906|pmc=3219962|pmid=21639948}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey M.|date=2000-01-01|title=Intermediate Filaments|journal=The Cell: A Molecular Approach. 2Nd Edition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9834/|language=en}}</ref> After this research, investigations of lamins slowed.

== Structure ==
The structure of lamins is composed of three units that are common among intermediate filaments: a central α-helical rod domain containing [[Heptad repeat|heptad]] repeats surrounded by globular N and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal is shorter and located at the top (head) while the C-terminal is longer and located at the end (tail).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Dechat|first1=Thomas|last2=Pfleghaar|first2=Katrin|last3=Sengupta|first3=Kaushik|last4=Shimi|first4=Takeshi|last5=Shumaker|first5=Dale K.|last6=Solimando|first6=Liliana|last7=Goldman|first7=Robert D.|date=2008-04-01|title=Nuclear lamins: major factors in the structural organization and function of the nucleus and chromatin|journal=Genes & Development|language=en|volume=22|issue=7|pages=832–853|doi=10.1101/gad.1652708|issn=0890-9369|pmc=2732390|pmid=18381888}}</ref> Lamins have a unique structure of the heptad repeats that is continuous in nature and contains an additional six heptads.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=Robert D.|last2=Gruenbaum|first2=Yosef|last3=Moir|first3=Robert D.|last4=Shumaker|first4=Dale K.|last5=Spann|first5=Timothy P.|date=2002-03-01|title=Nuclear lamins: building blocks of nuclear architecture|journal=Genes & Development|language=en|volume=16|issue=5|pages=533–547|doi=10.1101/gad.960502|issn=0890-9369|pmid=11877373|doi-access=free}}</ref> While the head domain of lamins is fairly consistent, the composition of the tail domain varies based on the type of lamin. However, all C-terminal domains contain a [[nuclear localization sequence]] (NLS). Similar to other IF proteins, lamins self-assemble into more complex structures. The basic unit of these structures is a coiled-coil dimer. The dimers arrange themselves in a head-to-tail manner, allowing for the formation of a protofilament. As these protofilaments aggregate, they form lamin filaments. Lamins of higher level organisms, such as vertebrates, continue to assemble into paracrystalline arrays.<ref name=":0" /> These complex structures allow nuclear lamins to perform their specialized functions in maintaining the shape of the nucleus as well as roles during mitosis and apoptosis.

==A- and B-types==
Lamins are divided into two major categories: A- and B-types. These subdivisions are based on similarities in cDNA sequences, structural features, isoelectric points, and expression trends.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" />

=== A-type lamins ===
A-type lamins are characterized by a neutral [[isoelectric point]], and they are typically displayed during later stages of embryonic development. Expressed in differentiated cells, A-type lamins originate from the ''LMNA'' gene.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last1=Stuurman|first1=Nico|last2=Heins|first2=Susanne|last3=Aebi|first3=Ueli|date=1998-01-01|title=Nuclear Lamins: Their Structure, Assembly, and Interactions|journal=Journal of Structural Biology|volume=122|issue=1|pages=42–66|doi=10.1006/jsbi.1998.3987|pmid=9724605}}</ref> Two isoforms, lamins A and C, can be created from this gene via [[alternative splicing]]. This creates a high amount of [[Homology (biology)|homology]] between the isoforms.<ref name=":2" /> Unlike lamin C, Lamin A is generated in a precursor form called prelamin A. Prelamin A and lamin C differ in structure only at the carboxyl-terminus. Here, prelamin A contains two extra exons that lamin C lacks. Furthermore, lamin C contains six unique amino-acid residues while prelamin A contains ninety-eight residues not found in the other isoform.<ref name=":6" /> A CaaX motif is found within the unique residues in prelamin A. Due to the presence of the CaaX motif, prelamin A undergoes a series of [[Post-translational modification|posttranslational modifications]] to become mature lamin A. These steps include farnesylation of the carboxyl-terminal cysteine, endoproteolytic release of the terminal amino acids, carboxymethalation of the accessible farnesylcysteine, and removal of the final fifteen residues by a zinc metalloprotease. The very first modification involving farnesylation of prelamin A is crucial to the development of mature lamin A. Isoform lamin C does not undergo posttranslational modifications.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last1=Dechat|first1=Thomas|last2=Adam|first2=Stephen A.|last3=Goldman|first3=Robert D.|date=2009-01-01|title=Nuclear lamins and chromatin: When structure meets function|journal=Advances in Enzyme Regulation|volume=49|issue=1|pages=157–166|doi=10.1016/j.advenzreg.2008.12.003|pmc=3253622|pmid=19154754}}</ref> Some studies have demonstrated that lamins A and C are not required for the formation of the nuclear lamina, yet disruptions in the ''LMNA'' gene can contribute to physical and mental limitations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Brian|date=2001-04-30|title=Lamins and Apoptosis|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=153|issue=3|pages=f5–f7|issn=0021-9525|pmc=2190563|pmid=11331313|doi=10.1083/jcb.153.3.f5}}</ref>

=== B-type lamins ===
B-type lamins are characterized by an acidic isoelectric point, and they are typically expressed in every cell.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last1=Gruenbaum|first1=Yosef|last2=Wilson|first2=Katherine L.|last3=Harel|first3=Amnon|last4=Goldberg|first4=Michal|last5=Cohen|first5=Merav|date=2000-04-01|title=Review: Nuclear Lamins—Structural Proteins with Fundamental Functions|journal=Journal of Structural Biology|volume=129|issue=2|pages=313–323|doi=10.1006/jsbi.2000.4216|pmid=10806082}}</ref> As with A-type lamins, there are multiple isoforms of B-type lamins, the most common being [[lamin B1]] and [[lamin B2]]. They are produced from two separate genes, ''LMNB1'' and ''LMNB2''.<ref name=":6" /> Similar to prelamin A, B-type lamins also contain a CaaX motif at the carboxyl-terminus. This marker triggers the same sequence of [[Post-translational modification|posttranslational modifications]] previously described for prelamin A except for the final cleavage step involving a zinc metalloprotease.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":9" /> Further investigations of B-type lamins across multiple species have found evidence that supports that B-type lamins existed before A-type lamins. This stems from the similarity in structure of B-type lamins between invertebrates and vertebrates. Furthermore, organisms that only contain a single lamin contain a B-type lamin.<ref name=":4" /> Other studies that have investigated the structural similarities and differences between A- and B-type lamins have found that the positions of introns/exons in B-type lamins have been conserved in A-type lamins, with more variations in the A-type lamins. This suggests that the common ancestor of these lamin types was a B-type lamin.

==Function==

=== Maintenance of nuclear shape ===
Due to their properties as a type of IF protein, lamins provide support for maintaining the shape of the nucleus. They also play an indirect role in anchoring the nucleus to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], forming a continuous unit within the cell. This is accomplished by lamin and lamin-interacting proteins (SUN1/SUN2) connecting with proteins on the outer nuclear membrane. These proteins in turn interact with cytoskeletal elements of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], forming a strong complex that can withstand mechanical stress.<ref name=":4" /> Nuclei that lack lamins or have mutated versions have a deformed shape and do not function properly.<ref name=":0" />

=== Mitosis ===
During mitosis, lamins are phosphorylated by [[Maturation promoting factor|Mitosis-Promoting Factor]] (MPF), which drives the disassembly of the lamina and the nuclear envelope. This allows chromatin to condense and the DNA to be replicated. After chromosome segregation, dephosphorylation of nuclear lamins by a [[phosphatase]] promotes reassembly of the nuclear envelope.

=== Apoptosis ===
[[Apoptosis]] is a highly organized process of programmed cell death. Lamins are crucial targets for this process due to their close associations with chromatin and the nuclear envelope. Apoptotic enzymes called [[caspase]]s target lamins and cleave both A- and B-types.<ref name=":10" /> This allows chromatin to separate from the nuclear lamina in order to be condensed. As apoptosis continues, cell structures slowly shrink into compartmentalized "blebs." Finally, these apoptotic bodies are digested by [[phagocyte]]s.<ref name=":1" /> Studies of apoptosis involving mutant A- and B-type lamins that are resistant to cleavage by [[caspase]]s show decreased DNA condensation and apoptotic “blebbing” formation, thereby underscoring the important role of lamins in apoptosis.<ref name=":7" />

== Clinical significance ==
{{Main|Laminopathy}}Mutations in the LMNA gene, encoding Lamins A and C, can produce a series of disorders ranging from [[Muscular dystrophy|muscular dystrophies]], [[Peripheral neuropathy|neuropathies]], [[Cardiomyopathy|cardiomyyopathies]], and [[Progeria|premature ageing syndromes]].  Collectively, these conditions are known as [[Laminopathy|laminopathies]].

===Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome===
{{Main|Progeria}}
One specific laminopathy is [[progeria|Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome]] (HGPS), characterized by premature ageing. Those affected by the condition appear normal at birth, but show signs of premature ageing including hair-loss, thinness, joint abnormalities, and retarded motor skills as they  develop. Furthermore, health problems usually seen in older persons such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure occur at a much younger age. Those with HGPS typically die in their early teens, usually following a heart attack or stroke.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hutchinson-gilford-progeria-syndrome|title=Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=2016-11-24}}</ref> 

HGPS is caused by a [[point mutation]] in the ''LMNA'' gene that codes for lamin A. The genetic alteration results in an alternative splice, creating a mutated form of prelamin A that is much shorter and lacks the cleavage site for a zinc metalloprotease. Because prelamin A cannot be properly processed during [[Post-translational modification|posttranslational modifications]], it retains its lipid modification (farnesylation) and remains in the inner nuclear membrane. This disrupts the mechanical stability of the nucleus, resulting in a higher rate of cell death and therefore a higher rate of aging.<ref name=":1" /> Current studies are investigating the effects of [[Farnesyltransferase inhibitor|farnesyl-transferase inhibitors]] (FTIs) to see if farnesyl attachment can be inhibited during [[Post-translational modification|posttranslational modification]] of prelamin A in order to treat patients with HGPS.<ref name=":5" />

=== Lamin A/C heart disease ===
Some laminopathies affect [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]].  These mutations cause a spectrum of heart disease ranging from no apparent effect to severe [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] leading to [[heart failure]].  Laminopathies frequently cause [[Heart arrhythmia|heart rhythm problems]] at an early stage in the disease process including abnormally slow heart rhythms such as [[Sinoatrial node|sinus node dysfunction]] and [[atrioventricular block]], and abnormally rapid heart rhythms such as [[ventricular tachycardia]].  As a result, those with Lamin A/C heart disease are often treated with [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]] or [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|implantable defibrillators]] in addition to medication.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Captur|first1=Gabriella|last2=Arbustini|first2=Eloisa|last3=Bonne|first3=Gisèle|last4=Syrris|first4=Petros|last5=Mills|first5=Kevin|last6=Wahbi|first6=Karim|last7=Mohiddin|first7=Saidi A.|last8=McKenna|first8=William J.|last9=Pettit|first9=Stephen|date=2017-11-25|title=Lamin and the heart|journal=Heart|volume=104|issue=6|pages=468–479|doi=10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312338|issn=1468-201X|pmid=29175975|s2cid=3563474}}</ref>
