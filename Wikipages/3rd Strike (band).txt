'''3rd Strike'''  was an American [[nu metal]] group, started by [[Jim Korthe]] (lead singer), Todd Deguchi (guitar), Erik Carlsson (guitar), PJ McMullan (drums) and Gabe Hammersmith (bass). Their lyrics were primarily based upon the former lives of the group's members. In May 2002, they released their debut and only album, ''[[Lost Angel (album)|Lost Angel]].'' They toured with [[Ozzfest]] and [[Warped Tour]] to promote their album, but broke up shortly after. Their song "Into Hell Again" was featured on the ''[[Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life]]'' soundtrack.

==Career==
Jim Korthe, lead singer for rap-rockers 3rd Strike, grew up in San Pedro, California. Along with his friend, guitarist Todd Deguchi, the two put together a makeshift lineup for 3rd Strike, but between several unsuccessful tours and Korthe's personal problems the band disbanded during the 1990s. In 1996 Korthe and Deguchi released one album under the moniker [[Dimestore Hoods]], consisting of vocalist Jim Korthe, guitarists Todd Deguchi and Tom McNerney, bassist Joe Puccio and drummer Mike Russo.

The two musicians continued to write together, and eventually re-formed the band with guitarist Erik Carlsson, drummer PJ McMullan and bassist Gabe Hammersmith. They began recording when [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] guitarist [[Fletcher Dragge]] heard their demo and connected them with his management company. By the end of 2001 they had recorded their debut, Lost Angel, which was released the following May. They supported the album at both the Ozzfest and Warped tours that summer. 

Songs by 3rd Strike were featured in the PlayStation title ''[[Delta Force: Urban Warfare|Delta Force Urban Warfare]]'' in 2002.

In January 2007, 3rd Strike posted the following message on Myspace, "Hey everyone just wanted to post an update on whats going on. We've been pretty busy tightening up our set so we can start getting out and playing some shows. Were all really excited about getting out and playing live cause that is where all the hard work pays off. Hopefully we'll have some new pics to post up soon and some more info asap. Thanx."

By August 2007 the band debuted the new single "Battlecry" on Myspace followed by a promo for the Peaceful Valley, "Life Goes On".

In June 2008 drummer Sean McCormick was replaced by Nick Manning on drums. Later that year the group debuted the new song, "Revolution" taken from a 3 song Pre-Production demo of a new album.

Lead singer Jim Korthe died in his San Pedro home on January 13, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=133937|title=Former 3RD STRIKE singer dead at 39|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416044121/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=133937|archive-date=April 16, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=July 11, 2011}}</ref> He was 39 years old.
