==History==
Blue Foundation released their first [[Gramophone record|7"]] via [[Moshi Moshi Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moshimoshimusic.com/releases/blue-foundation/hidehollywood |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630080132/http://www.moshimoshimusic.com/releases/blue-foundation/hidehollywood |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-06-30 |title=Moshi Moshi Records &#124; Releases: Hide/Hollywood |publisher=Moshimoshimusic.com |date=2000-06-16 |access-date=2012-05-12}}</ref> and their first, self-titled, album was released shortly thereafter. Three years later, in 2003, the band signed with EMI/Warner Music releasing 2 critically acclaimed albums, released in the US through Astralwerks Records.

In 2008, Blue Foundation established their own imprint, Dead Peoples Choice, that so far has released two albums and one remix album. Blue Foundation gained major recognition with a remix by Zeds Dead of their song "Eyes On Fire", reaching a no. 3 ranking on iTunes Electronic Music Chart (2014). Today "Eyes On Fire" has more than 35 million YouTube plays, while the "Zeds Dead"-remix has exceeded 110 million YouTube plays. During the years Blue Foundation have expanded their audience, embracing today both the underground and the alternative mainstream.

Blue Foundation has been featured in major films such as ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2008/10/twilight-soundtrack-tracklisting-unveiled/ |title='Twilight' Soundtrack Tracklisting Unveiled |date=8 October 2008 | publisher=SPIN}}</ref> ''[[Miami Vice (film)|Miami Vice]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2006/07/moby-goldfrapp-miami-vice-soundtrack/ |title=Moby, Goldfrapp on 'Miami Vice' Soundtrack |date=20 July 2006 | publisher=SPIN}}</ref> and on TV shows including ''CSI: Miami'' and ''The Vampire Diaries''.
