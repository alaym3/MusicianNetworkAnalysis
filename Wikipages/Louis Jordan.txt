'''Louis Thomas Jordan'''{{efn|Jordan favoured the French pronunciation of [[Louis (given name)|his name]] ({{IPAc-en|'|l|uː|i}}), commonly found in the southern United States}} (July 8, 1908 – February 4, 1975)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.louisjordan.com/history.aspx |title=Louis Jordan |publisher=LouisJordan.com |access-date=2015-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721075859/http://www.louisjordan.com/history.aspx |archive-date=July 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> was an American saxophonist, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and bandleader who was popular from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. Known as "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The King of the Jukebox]]", he earned his highest profile towards the end of the [[swing era]]. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as an "early influence" in 1987.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-jun-22-adna-jordan22-story.html|title=Straining to hear Louis Jordan's music|date=June 22, 2008|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>

Jordan was a talented singer with great comedic flair, and he fronted his own band for more than twenty years. He duetted with some of the biggest solo singing stars of his time, including [[Bing Crosby]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Louis Armstrong]]. Jordan was also an actor and a film personality—he appeared in dozens of "soundies" (promotional film clips); the one for "[[Caldonia]]" is the most readily available for viewing on various websites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR6pHtiNT_k|title=Caldonia / Louis Jordan|access-date=March 8, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattleweekly.com/film/louis-jordan-and-his-tympany-band-films-and-soundies/|title=Louis Jordan and his Tympany Band: Films and Soundies|first=Michaelangelo|last=Matos|date=October 9, 2006|newspaper=[[Seattle Weekly]]|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref> He also made numerous cameos in mainstream features and short films, and starred in two musical feature films made especially for him. He was an instrumentalist who played all forms of the saxophone but specialized in the [[Alto saxophone|alto]]. He also played the piano and [[clarinet]].

Jordan began his career in [[big-band]] swing jazz in the 1930s, but he became known as one of the leading practitioners, innovators and popularizers of [[jump blues]], a swinging, up-tempo, dance-oriented hybrid of [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[boogie-woogie]]. Typically performed by smaller bands consisting of five or six players, jump music featured shouted, highly [[syncopated]] vocals and earthy, comedic lyrics on contemporary urban themes. It strongly emphasized the rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; after the mid-1940s, this mix was often augmented by electric guitar. Jordan's band also pioneered the use of the [[electronic organ]].

With his dynamic [[Tympany Five]] bands, Jordan mapped out the main parameters of the classic [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], urban [[blues]] and early [[rock-and-roll]] genres with a series of highly influential [[78-rpm]] discs released by [[Decca Records]]. These recordings presaged many of the styles of black popular music of the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and exerted a strong influence on many leading performers in these genres. Many of his records were produced by [[Milt Gabler]], who went on to refine and develop the qualities of Jordan's recordings in his later production work with [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]], including "[[Rock Around the Clock]]".

Jordan ranks fifth in the list of the most successful [[African-American]] recording artists according to [[Joel Whitburn]]'s analysis of ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine's [[R&B chart]], and was the most popular rhythm and blues artist with his "jump blues" recordings<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2008/03/04/87905064/louis-jordan-jukebox-king|title=Louis Jordan: 'Jukebox King'|website=NPR|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref> of the pre-Rock n' Roll era.  Though comprehensive sales figures are not available, he had at least four million-selling hits during his career. Jordan regularly topped the R&B "race" charts and was one of the first black recording artists to achieve significant [[Crossover (music)|crossover]]<ref name="auto3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Jordan|title=Louis Jordan &#124; Biography, Songs, Assessment, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref> in popularity with the mainstream (predominantly white) American audience, having simultaneous Top Ten hits on the pop charts on several occasions.

==Life and career==
Jordan was born on July 8, 1908, in [[Brinkley, Arkansas]]. His father, James Aaron Jordan, was a music teacher and bandleader for the Brinkley Brass Band and the [[Rabbit Foot Minstrels]]. His mother, Adell, died when Louis was young. He was raised by his grandmother Maggie Jordan and his aunt Lizzie Reid.<ref name=":0" /> At an early age he studied clarinet and saxophone with his father.<ref name="Feather">{{cite book |last1=Feather |first1=Leonard |last2=Gitler |first2=Ira |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-507418-5 |pages=373–374}}</ref> In his teens he was a member of the Rabbit Foot Minstrels<ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net">{{cite web|url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1685 |title=Louis Thomas Jordan (1908–1975) |publisher=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|access-date=2015-09-07}}</ref> and was playing professionally in the late 1920s.<ref name="Classic">{{cite book |last1=Yanow |first1=Scott |title=Classic Jazz |date=2001 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-87930-659-9 |pages=374–377}}</ref> In the early 1930s he played in Philadelphia and New York City with [[Charlie Gaines]].<ref name="Feather" /><ref name="Classic" /> He recorded with [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]] and briefly was a member of the [[Stuff Smith]] orchestra.<ref name="Feather" /><ref name="Classic" /> With the [[Chick Webb]] orchestra he sang and played alto saxophone.<ref name="Feather" /> In 1938 he started a band that recorded a year later as the Tympany Five.<ref name="Classic" /> 
[[File:Louis Jordan's Typany Five, New York, N.Y., between 1946 and 1948 (William P. Gottlieb 04751).jpg|thumb|Louis Jordan's Tympany Five]]

Jordan's first band, drawn mainly from members of the [[Jesse Stone]] band, was a nine-piece group that he reduced to a sextet after being hired for a residency at the Elks Rendezvous club at 464 [[Lenox Avenue]] in [[Harlem]]. The band consisted of Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass), and Walter Martin (drums). In his first billing as the Elks Rendez-vous Band, his name was spelled "Louie" so people could avoid pronouncing it "Lewis".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbandlibrary.com/louisjordan.html |title=Louis Jordan Solid Sender |publisher=BigBandLibrary.com |access-date=2015-09-07}}</ref>
[[File:Louis Jordan, New York, N.Y., ca. July 1946 (William P. Gottlieb 04731).jpg|thumb|upright|Jordan in New York, July 1946, shortly after getting second billing to Glen Gray at the Paramount]]
In 1942, Jordan and his band moved to Los Angeles, where he began making [[soundies]], the precursors of music video. He appeared on many Jubilee radio shows and a series of programs for the [[Armed Forces Radio]] for distribution to American troops overseas. Jordan's career was uninterrupted by the draft except for a four-week Army camp tour. Because of a "hernia condition" he was classified "[[Selective Service System classification|4F]]".<ref name="billboard4f">{{cite web|title=Louis Jordan in 4F|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT17|access-date=13 March 2020 |date=1 May 1943 |publisher=Billboard/Nielsen |pages=17–}}</ref>

During the 1940s Jordan and the band became popular with such hits as "[[Choo Choo Ch'Boogie]]", "[[Knock Me a Kiss]]", "[[Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby]]", and "[[Five Guys Named Moe]]".<ref name="Feather" /><ref name="Classic" /> He recorded with Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby, and [[Louis Armstrong]] and appeared in films.<ref name="Feather" /><ref name="Classic" /> Within a year of his breakthrough, the Tympany Five's appearance fee rose from $350 to $2,000 per night. But the breadth of Jordan's success and the size of his combo had larger implications for the music industry. The blues singer [[Gatemouth Moore]] said, "He was playing...with five pieces. That ruined the big bands ... He could play just as good and just as loud with five as 17. And it was cheaper."<ref name="Lauterbach">{{cite book |last1=Lauterbach |first1=Preston |title=The Chitlin' Circuit and the Road to Rock 'n' Roll |date=2011 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-34294-9 |page=115}}</ref>

Jordan's "raucous recordings were notable for the use of fantastical narrative". This is perhaps best exemplified on "[[Saturday Night Fish Fry]]", a two-part 1950 hit that was split across both sides of a 78-rpm record. It was one of the first popular songs to use the word "rocking" in the chorus and to feature a distorted electric guitar.<ref name="what">{{cite book |last1=Dawson |first1=Jim |last2=Propes |first2=Steve |title=What Was the First Rock 'N' Roll Record? |date=1992 |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=Boston & London |isbn=0-571-12939-0}}</ref> Many sources describe this recording, and some others by Jordan, as "jump blues", because "it literally made its listeners jump to its pulsing beat", according to [[NPR]].<ref name="auto1"/> One source states that "Saturday Night Fish Fry" had a "lively jump rhythm, call-and-response chorus and double-string electric guitar riffs that Chuck Berry would later admit to copying".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30288/5-candidates-first-rock-n-roll-song |title=5 Candidates for the First Rock 'n' Roll Song |date=March 23, 2012 |publisher=Mentalfloss |access-date=August 2, 2020}}</ref>

Jordan is described by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as "The Father of Rhythm & Blues" and "The Grandfather of Rock 'n' Roll".<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/louis-jordan |title=Louis Jordan: Inducted in 1987|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Rockhall.com |access-date=2011-12-30}}</ref> The Hall also states that "Saturday Night Fish Fry" is "an early example of rap and possibly the first rock and roll recording".<ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/louis-jordan|title=Louis Jordan &#124; Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref> Not all critics agree with the importance of his work as a rock and roll influence. For example, [[Rolling Stone (magazine)]] offers this take on Jordan's recordings from the late 1940s: "... the early idol of both Berry and Bill Haley, came closest, but his jump 'n' jive story songs were aimed as much at adults as teens, and any hillbilly flavor in his records was strictly a comedic device". The article agrees with [[Sam Phillips]] that rock and roll "specifically addressed and was tailored to teenagers".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-50s-a-decade-of-music-that-changed-the-world-229924/|title=The 50s: A Decade of Music That Changed the World|first1=Robert|last1=Palmer|website=Rollingstone.com|date=April 19, 1990|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>

Another source describes Jordan's jump blues style as combining "good-natured novelty lyrics (some with suggestive double meanings); [pushing] the tempo; [strengthening] the beat; [layering] the sound with his bluesy saxophone and playful melodies."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ampopmusic.com/topic/jump-blues-grandfather-of-rock-n-roll|title=Jump Blues – Grandfather of Rock 'n' Roll |website=AmPopMusic.com|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>

During this period Jordan again placed more than a dozen songs on the national charts. However, Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five dominated the 1940s R&B charts, or (as they were known at the time) the "race" charts. In this period Jordan had eighteen number 1 singles and fifty-four in the Top Ten. According to [[Joel Whitburn]]'s analysis of the ''Billboard'' magazine charts, Jordan ranks fifth among the most successful musicians of the period 1942–1995.<ref name="whitburnr&b">{{cite book |last1=Whitburn |first1=Joel |title=Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942–1995 |date=1996 |publisher=Record Research |pages=621, 235}}</ref> From July 1946 through May 1947, Jordan had five consecutive number one songs, holding the top slot for 44 consecutive weeks.<ref name="whitburnr&b" />

Jordan's popularity was boosted not only by his hit Decca records but also by his prolific recordings for [[Armed Forces Radio]] and the [[V-Disc]] transcription program, which helped to make him popular with whites and blacks. He starred in short musical films and made "[[soundies]]" for his hit songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdwildrealm.com/f-louis-jordan.html |title=Louis Jordan's Soundies |publisher=Weirdwildrealm.com |access-date=2015-09-07}}</ref>

Stepping away from his rhythm and blues style, Jordan started a big band in the early 1950s that was unsuccessful.<ref name="Feather" /><ref name="Classic" /> Illness kept him near home in Arizona thougout the 1950s.<ref name="Feather" />

In 1952, Jordan performed on June 1 at [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]] in Los Angeles for the eighth [[Cavalcade of Jazz]] concert produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.]]<ref name="booked">{{cite news |title=Louis Jordan Booked for Eighth Cavalcade of Jazz |work=The California Eagle |date=May 15, 1952}}</ref> Jordan and His Tympany Five returned for the tenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert on June 20, 1954.<ref name="top">{{cite news |title=Basie, Jordan, Prado Top Jazz Cavalcade |work=Los Angeles Sentinel |date=June 3, 1954}}</ref>

Jordan signed with [[Aladdin Records|Aladdin]] for which he recorded 21 songs in early 1954. Nine singles were released from these sessions; three of the songs were not released.<ref name="tivn">{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisvintagenow.com/our_heroes/louis_jordan_discography_54-58.htm |title=Louis Jordan Discography 1954–1958 (Aladdin, X, Vik, and Mercury Sessions) |publisher=Thisisvintagenow.com |access-date=2015-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016224517/http://www.thisisvintagenow.com/our_heroes/louis_jordan_discography_54-58.htm |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1955, he recorded with "X" Records, a  subsidiary of RCA which changed its name to [[Vik Records]] while Jordan was with them.<ref name="globaldog">{{cite web |title=45 Discography for "X"/Vik Records |url=http://globaldogproductions.info/x/x-vik.html |website=globaldogproductions.info |access-date=13 March 2020}}</ref> Three singles were by released by "X" and one by Vik; four tracks were not released.<ref name="tivn" /> In these sessions Jordan intensified his sound to compete with rock and roll.<ref name="tivn" /> In 1956, [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] signed Jordan and released two albums and a handful of singles.<ref name="tivn" /> His first album for Mercury, ''Somebody Up There Digs Me'' (1956), showcased updated rock-and-roll versions of previous hits such as "Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens", "Caldonia", "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie", "Salt Pork, West Virginia", and "Beware!"<ref name="tivn" /> Mercury intended this to be a comeback for Jordan, but it was not commercially successful, and the label let him go in 1958.<ref name="tivn" /> He recorded sporadically in the 1960s for Warwick (1960), [[Black Lion Records|Black Lion]] (1962), Tangerine (1962–1965), and Pzazz (1968) and in the early 1970s for [[Black & Blue Records|Black & Blue]] (1973), Blues Spectrum (1973), and [[JSP Records|JSP]] (1974).<ref>Thomas, Alain. Liner notes for the album ''Rock 'n' Roll''. p. 5.</ref>

In the early 1960s he toured in England with [[Chris Barber]].<ref name="Feather" /> Speaking in 2012, Barber recalled seeing Jordan at the [[Apollo Theater]] in New York:
{{quote|playing with him was just frightening. It's a bit like an amateur guitar player from a back street who has just bought a Spanish guitar, working with [[Andrés Segovia|Segovia]]. He didn't make you feel small, but he was just so perfect in what he did.&nbsp;... I still remember watching him singing, but he would accompany himself on the alto, and you were convinced he was playing the alto while he was singing.&nbsp;... the breath hadn't gone from his last word before he was playing his alto and it seemed to be simultaneous.&nbsp;... He got a very raw deal from history&nbsp;... In the Chick Webb band there were two regular singers – Ella and Louis Jordan. And yet really history has consigned him to just being a comedy vocal thing with a bit of rock and roll, and the first alto&nbsp;... but he was such a consummately good singer that it's sad that he wasn't known more for it.<ref name="Peters">{{cite web |last1=Peters |first1=Clarke |title=BBC Radio 6 Music – Choo Choo Ch'Boogie, Episode 4 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f4plq |website=BBC |access-date=13 March 2020 |date=16 June 2017}}</ref>}}

Jordan remade some of his top hits for a 1973 LP, ''I Believe in Music'': "Caldonia," "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby," "Saturday Night Fish Fry" and "I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town". New material was also added.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/i-believe-in-music-mw0000202377|title=I Believe in Music – Louis Jordan &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|access-date=March 8, 2021|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Louis-Jordan-I-Believe-In-Music/release/3111124|title=Louis Jordan – I Believe In Music (Vinyl)|access-date=March 8, 2021|website=Discogs.com}}</ref>

According to a Billboard book, cited by the Blues Hall of Fame, Jordan had "18 No. 1 hits on the race and R&B charts spent a total of 113 weeks in the top slot, almost twice as many weeks as any other artist in the history of rhythm & blues".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blues.org/blues_hof_inductee/louis-jordan/|title=Louis Jordan|website=Blues.org|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>

One publication of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] provided this summary of Jordan's music.<blockquote>One important stylistic prototype in the development of R&B was jump blues, pioneered by Louis Jordan, with his group Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five. Jordan’s group ... consisted of three horns and a rhythm section, while stylistically his music melded elements of swing and blues, incorporating the shuffle rhythm, boogie-woogie bass lines, and short horn patterns or riffs. The songs featured the use of African American vernacular language, humor, and vocal call-and-response sections between Jordan and the band. Jordan’s music appealed to both African American and white audiences, and he had broad success with hit songs like "Is You Is or Is You Ain’t My Baby" (1944).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20201025032411/https://folklife.si.edu/magazine/freedom-sounds-tell-it-like-it-is-a-history-of-rhythm-and-blues] {{dead link|date=September 2021}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Films ===
The release of the 1945 musical short film ''[[Caldonia (film)|Caldonia]]'' boosted Jordan's career due to roadshow screenings in support of his live performance.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|title=Louis Jordan's 'Caledonia', 'Beware' Pix a 3-Way Payoff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT34|access-date=13 March 2020|date=8 June 1946 |publisher=Billboard/Nielsen |pages=34–}}</ref> In addition to singing in many films and appearing in mainstream films such as ''[[Meet Miss Bobby Socks]]'' (1944) and ''[[Follow the Boys]]'' (1944). The success of ''Caldonia'' (1945) led to other [[race film]] roles for Jordan with Astor Pictures: ''[[Beware (film)|Beware!]]'' (1946), ''[[Reet, Petite, and Gone]]'' (1947), and ''[[Look-Out Sister]]'' (1947).<ref name=":2" />

His prolific use of film as a promotional vehicle broke new ground, garnering praise from ''Billboard'', which wrote, "The movies have helped the one-nighters, which have also been helped by recordings, which have also helped the movies, which in turn have become more profitable. It's a delicious circle, and other bands are now exploring the possibilities."<ref name="Westphal">{{cite web |last1=Westphal |first1=Kyle |title=Excavating Beware |url=https://www.chicagofilmsociety.org/2011/04/15/excavating-beware-2/ |website=Chicago Film Society |access-date=14 March 2020 |date=15 April 2011}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
Jordan was married five times. His first wife Julia (also called Julie) was from [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas|Arkadelphia]]. Soon after their wedding Julia gave birth to a daughter, Patty, who turned out to be another man's child.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last1=Chilton |first1=John |title=Let the Good Times roll: The Story of Louis Jordan and His Music |date=1997 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=047208478X |edition=1st paperback}}</ref> In 1932, Jordan met Ida Fields, a Texas-born singer and dancer, in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]]. They married that year. Ida was six years his senior and a member of a traveling dance troupe called the Florida Orange Blossoms. Ida sued Jordan for bigamy in 1943. He claimed she was aware that he was still married. Ida was awarded a $70,000 judgment, later reduced to $30,000.<ref name=":1">{{cite book |last1=Koch |first1=Stephen |title=Louis Jordan: Son of Arkansas, Father of R&B |date=2014 |isbn=9781626194359}}</ref> She began billing herself as "Mrs. Louis Jordan, Queen of the Blues, and her Orchestra" before Jordan stopped it by stalling payments. In another court case, Ida was awarded a settlement of $50,000.<ref name=":0" /> In 1942, Jordan married his childhood sweetheart, Fleecie Moore; they were later divorced. In 1947, Fleecie discovered Jordan was having an affair with dancer Florence "Vicky" Hayes and attacked him with a knife. She was arrested and charged with assault.<ref name=":1" /> Jordan married Vicky on November 14, 1951, in Providence, Rhode Island;<ref name=":0" /> they separated in 1960. He married Martha Weaver, a singer and dancer from St. Louis, in 1966.<ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net" />

=== Financial problems ===
Jordan's popularity and success had waned by 1953. By that time, "rock 'n' roll had captured the world's attention, and Jordan's jumping R&B became a thing of the past". While he continued performing, this did not generate the level of income that million selling recordings would have provided.<ref name="auto1"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biography.yourdictionary.com/louis-jordan|title=Louis Jordan|website=Biography.yourdictionary.com|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>

In 1961, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] filed an [[Tax lien|income tax lien]] against Jordan. As a result, he sold property well below their worth to pay off debts.<ref name="Home">{{cite web |title=Louis Jordan to Sell $71,000 Home for $30,000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59 |access-date=13 March 2020 |date=29 June 1961 |publisher=Jet/Johnson Publishing Company |pages=59–}}</ref> Musician [[Ike Turner]] stated in his autobiography, ''[[Takin' Back My Name]]'', that he heard about his tax problems and contacted Jordan's booking agency in Chicago. Turner convinced the president of the company to send Jordan a check for $20,000. Jordan was unaware of this deed.<ref name="takin">{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=Ike |last2=Cawthorne |first2=Nigel |title=Takin' Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner |date=1999 |publisher=Virgin |location=London |isbn=1852278501}}</ref>

Jordan wrote or co-wrote many of the songs he performed, but he did not benefit financially from them. Many of the hit songs he wrote, including "Caldonia", were credited to his wife Fleecie Moore to avoid an existing publishing arrangement. Their marriage was acrimonious and short-lived. After their divorce she retained ownership of the songs. However, Jordan may have taken credit for some songs written by others—he is credited as the co-writer of "Saturday Night Fish Fry", but the Tympany Five pianist [[Bill Doggett]] claimed he wrote it.<ref>Visser, Joop.

Louis Jordan was among hundreds of musicians whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html|title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |date=25 June 2019 |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019}}</ref>

On June 23, 2008, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a resolution introduced by Arkansas Representative [[Vic Snyder]] honoring Jordan on the centenary of his birth.<ref name="Snyder">{{cite web |last1=Snyder |first1=Vic |title=Text - H.Res.1242 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Honoring the life, musical accomplishments, and contributions of Louis Jordan on the 100th anniversary of his birth. |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-resolution/1242/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22louis+jordan%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=4 |website=Congress.gov |access-date=14 March 2020 |date=23 June 2008}}</ref>

The [[United States Postal Service]] featured Jordan and his film for ''Caldonia'' in 2008 as part of its tribute to Vintage Black Cinema. "Vivid reminders of a bygone era will be celebrated in June through Vintage Black Cinema stamps based on five vintage [[movie posters]]. Whether spotlighting the talents of entertainment icons or documenting changing social attitudes and expectations, these posters now serve a greater purpose than publicity and promotion. They are invaluable pieces of history, preserving memories of cultural phenomena that otherwise might have been forgotten. The stamp pane was designed by Carl Herrman of Carlsbad, California."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080120142648/http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2007/sr07_084.htm] {{dead link|date=September 2021}}</ref>

Jordan is described by the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as "The Father of Rhythm & Blues" and "The Grandfather of Rock 'n' Roll".<ref name="auto"/>  Another source states that with ''Caldonia'' (1945), Jordan was "already crafting the classic rock ‘n’ roll sound".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/news/culture-and-history/king-of-the-jukebox-louis-jordan/|title=King of the Jukebox: Louis Jordan|website=Legacy.com|date=July 8, 2013|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref> The Hall of Fame states that "his classic “Saturday Night Fish Fry” (1949) is an early example of rap and possibly the first rock and roll recording".<ref name="auto2"/>

The [[Blues Foundation]] hints that Jordan was a precursor to R&B: "Louis Jordan was the biggest African-American star of his era and that his "Caldonia" reached "the top of the Race Records chart, as it was known prior to the introduction of term Rhythm & Blues in 1949".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blues.org/blues_hof_inductee/caldonia-louis-jordan-decca-1945/|title=Caldonia - Louis Jordan (Decca, 1945)|website=Blues.org|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>

Some have suggested that Chuck Berry modeled his musical approach on Jordan's.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/chuck-berrys-music-helped-define-the-modern-teenager/|title=Chuck Berry's influence on rock 'n roll was incalculable|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|first=Hillel|last=Italie|date=March 18, 2017 |access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref> Berry changed the lyric content from black life to teenage life, and substituted cars and girls for Jordan's primary motifs of food, drink, money and girls.

In fact, the artist said ''Caldonia'' was the first non-gospel song he learned; and the shriek (or "whoop")<ref name="auto4"/> on the Jordan record "sounds eerily like the vocal tone Little Richard would adopt", in addition to the "Jordan-style pencil-thin moustache".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/Caldonia.pdf|title="Caldonia" Louis Jordan (1945) Library of Congress|website=Loc.gov|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Cleveland"/> [[James Brown]] and [[Ray Charles]] also said that Jordan's style had an influence on their work.<ref name="Cleveland">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/onstage/2015/01/vintage_photos_rock_hall_induc.html|title=Vintage photos: Rock Hall inductee Louis Jordan is the music master behind 'Five Guys Named Moe'|first1=Rea|last1=Simakis|date=January 23, 2015|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>

[[B.B. King]] recorded an album called ''[[Let the Good Times Roll (album)|Let the Good Times Roll: The Music of Louis Jordan]]''.

According to Cleveland.com, "Louis Jordan had a profound impact on several African-American music genres that evolved during the first half of the 20th century ... He helped make jump blues, jazz and boogie-woogie mainstream forces. Jordan’s legendary work would serve as a precursor to modern blues, rock and roll and R&B music".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2020/06/50-most-important-african-american-music-artists-of-all-time.html|title=50 most important African American music artists of all time|first= Troy L. |last=Smith|date=June 25, 2020|website=Cleveland.com|access-date=March 8, 2021}}</ref>
