'''Aurelio Voltaire Hernández'''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0901807/bio |title=Voltaire – Biography – IMDb |website=The Internet Movie Database}}</ref> (born January 25, 1967<ref name="OfficialBio">{{cite web |url=http://voltaire.net/biography/ |last=Hernández |first=Aurelio Voltaire |title=Aurelio Voltaire &#124; The official website of musician, author and Gothic personality, &#124; Biography |series=NEWS}}</ref>), professionally known as '''Aurelio Voltaire''' or simply as '''Voltaire''', is a Cuban-American musician, singer, and composer. His professional name is Voltaire, his given middle-name.

==Name==
In the past, when asked about his real name, Voltaire avoided the question or implied that his real name is in fact Voltaire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egodriven.net/voltaire.htm |title=An EgoDriven Interview with Voltaire |access-date=February 13, 2007 |last=Johnson |first=Josh |publisher=EgoDriven.net}}</ref>

Voltaire chose to use his middle name as his performance name because his namesake "saw through the hypocrisies of humanity and commented on them through satire. In essence, he was able to educate people about the world around them by making them laugh."<ref name="StarVox">{{cite web |url=http://www.starvox.net/intview/voltaire.htm |title=Salon de Voltaire: An Intimate Dialogue |author=BlackOrpheus |publisher=StarVox music zine |archive-date=December 8, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001208201800/http://www.starvox.net/intview/voltaire.htm |url-status=dead |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

According to the School of Visual Arts where he is employed as a professor, Aurelio Voltaire's real name is Aurelio Voltaire Hernández.<ref name="name">{{cite web |url=http://www.sva.edu/faculty/aurelio-voltaire-hernandez |title=Our Faculty: Aurelio Voltaire Hernandez |access-date=May 18, 2015 |publisher=School of Visual Arts}}</ref> Voltaire attributes "Acoustic Guitar and Vocals" on ''[[Ooky Spooky]]'' to Aurelio Voltaire Hernández, confirming that is his real name. Since then he has signed his name as Aurelio Voltaire, and is more open about it in public appearances.

His stage name is now "Aurelio Voltaire" for the following reason: "I got tired of there being other people releasing albums as Voltaire. There's an indie band in Germany and some American guy who makes instrumental hip hop. Like, do these people not do a fuckin' Google search before naming their bands? Anyway, it was just easier to distinguish myself from them by using my first name."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/VoltaireFanPage/posts/610176809005749?comment_id=6910511 |title=Hey Voltaire, I got a question... – Quentin Mitchell |date=August 18, 2013 |work=Facebook |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref>

==Background==
Aurelio Voltaire's father died when he was four months old. At ten months old, Voltaire emigrated to [[New Jersey]] with his mother and sister remarried. However, he states that he did not enjoy residing there, stating he was a victim of bullying because of his heritage and strange hobbies and interests.<ref name="OfficialBio"/> At the age of ten, Voltaire was inspired by the films of [[Ray Harryhausen]] (''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]''), and began animating on a [[Super 8 mm film|super 8]] camera. By piecing together snippets of information from [[fanzines]], he eventually was able to teach himself how to make foam rubber animation models and animate them. His stepfather was abusive, considering Voltaire's strange hobbies and interests to indicate he was homosexual. A family friend sexually molested him from infancy into his teenage years. His girlfriend at the time committed suicide, which made him consider doing the same.<ref>{{Citation|title=Gothic Youtubers VS Depression and Suicide - Gothic Homemaking Presents|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXKl8FEX8ys|language=en|access-date=2021-10-05}}</ref> Before he followed through, he promised himself to live one more day, doing and saying what he wanted to do and say. This allowed him to stand up to the people who were bullying him, and instantly elevated his self-esteem. Though he considered committing suicide again the next day, he was able to hold it off indefinitely. At the age of 17, he ran away from home and moved to New York City. His first job there was an animator with [[Parker Brothers]].<ref name="ProjektBio">{{cite web |url=http://www.projekt.com/projekt/artist.asp?id=1015 |title=Projekt Artist: 'Voltaire' |publisher=[[Projekt Records]] |archive-date=October 20, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001020063112/http://www.projekt.com/projekt/artist.asp?id=1015 |url-status=dead |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> Voltaire says that he loves New York, and that the only other place he would be happy living is Tokyo.<ref name="StarVox"/>

==Musical style and career==
Voltaire's music has strong roots and connections to European [[folk music|folk]] as well as other influences such as the [[Gothic rock|goth scene]].<ref name="ProjektBio"/> However, many listeners find his music hard to classify. Although it has a sound reminiscent of European folk music,<ref name="ProjektBio"/> many people claim it to be [[dark wave]]; perhaps as this is a label often given to many other artists from [[Projekt Records]], and a word often used to mean many things by the label themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.projekt.com/projekt/lobby_darkwave.asp |title=Projekt: Darkwave lobby |publisher=Projekt Records |archive-date=June 11, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000611182617/http://www.projekt.com/projekt/lobby_darkwave.asp |url-status=dead |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> His music has also been linked to [[cabaret]], with ''Lexicon Magazine'' using the term "goth cabaret", possibly referring to [[dark cabaret]], a term often used to describe some bands Voltaire cites as his influences. Voltaire has also been linked to the [[steampunk]] scene with Victorian-era horror related subjects, and some of his visual and music styling, and in recent years he has become a favorite at major steampunk conventions such as the [[Steampunk World's Fair]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fancons.com/guests/bio/967/aurelio-voltaire|title=Aurelio Voltaire - FanCons.com |website=FanCons.com|language=en|access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref> [[New wave music|New wave]] has also been used to describe Voltaire's music by some reviewers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?dept%5Fid=&sku=PRO00098 |title=Projekt: darkwave – Voltaire: Almost Human |author=Various authors |publisher=[[Projekt Records]]/Various magazines/[[ezines]] |archive-date=March 22, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020322171806/http://www.projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?dept_id=&sku=PRO00098 |url-status=dead |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> Voltaire describes his own music as "Music for a parallel universe where electricity was never invented and Morrissey is the queen of England". He says that bands and artists who influenced his music are [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], [[Morrissey]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Cab Calloway]] and [[Danny Elfman]].<ref name="MySpace">{{cite web |url=http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=8202636 |title=Voltaire's official MySpace |author=Voltaire |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018064721/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=8202636 |archive-date=October 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

The first band that Voltaire played in (during junior high school) was called "First Degree". At this age, he was a fan of [[Duran Duran]], but then began listening to gothic music, most notably bands such as [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[The Cure]]. It was not until later that he began participating in the goth scene; it did not at first occur to him that there was a goth scene at all.<ref name="StarVox"/>

As an adult, Voltaire formed a band which included a violin, a cello, drums, and himself as the vocalist and the [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] player. Within a year, Projekt Records signed them and by June 1998 they released their first album called ''[[The Devil's Bris]]''. Two years later their second album, ''[[Almost Human (Voltaire album)|Almost Human]]'' was released.<ref name="StarVox"/>

One of Voltaire's popular hits is "[[Brains! (Voltaire song)|BRAINS!]]", a song written for the [[Cartoon Network]] show ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]'', aired in the episode "Little Rock of Horrors". He also wrote "Land of the Dead" for ''[[Billy and Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure]]'', which plays in the opening sequence.<ref name="DragonConBio">{{cite web |url=http://www.dragoncon.org/dc_Guest_Detail.php?id=1328 |title=Welcome to Dragon*Con! – Dragon*Con Biography: [ Voltaire] |publisher=[[Dragon Con]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905024450/http://www.dragoncon.org/dc_Guest_Detail.php?id=1328 |archive-date=September 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

As an avid fan of ''[[Star Trek]]'', Aurelio Voltaire frequently attends science fiction conventions, and released a four track [[Extended play|EP]] called ''Banned on Vulcan''. It was a set of comedy recordings poking fun at characters from the show.<ref name="DragonConBio"/>

On the side, Voltaire is also the lead vocalist of a New York City based new wave quintet known as The Oddz.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/theoddz |title=The Oddz' official MySpace |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113000924/http://www.myspace.com/theoddz |archive-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

Voltaire performed a musical special for Artix Entertainment in their MMO game ''[[AdventureQuest Worlds]]'', altering some of his songs in ''[[To the Bottom of the Sea]]'' to suit their standards. Over 32,000 players attended. It was released at 8:00&nbsp;pm on Friday the Thirteenth of March 2009.

On September 2, 2011, Voltaire released his eighth studio album: ''[[Riding a Black Unicorn Down the Side of an Erupting Volcano While Drinking from a Chalice Filled with the Laughter of Small Children]]''. Participating musicians include [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]] frontwoman [[Melora Creager]] on cellos, [[Brian Viglione]] on drums, former [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] bassist [[David J]] on bass and [[Franz Nicolay]] on accordion.

On September 2, 2012, Voltaire released his ninth studio album, ''[[BiTrektual]]''. It contains songs parodying ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and featured guest appearances by [[Jason C. Miller]], [[Tim Russ]], [[Garrett Wang]] and [[Robert Picardo]].

In 2014, his tenth album, ''[[Raised by Bats]]'', was released. Contrasting with the dark cabaret instrumentation of most of his album, ''Raised by Bats'' is more [[death rock]] -- and [[gothic rock]]-inflected, and it counted with guest appearances by [[Ray Toro]] of [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Craig Adams (musician)|Craig Adams]] of [[The Mission (band)|The Mission]], [[Julia Marcell]] and much more.

It's been a difficult process for both of us to come to this decision, one that I really don't wish upon anyone. Nothing is worse than seeing your best friend in pain."<ref>{{cite web
