'''Citizen''' is an American rock band from [[Southeast Michigan]] and [[Northwest Ohio]] that formed in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Joe|title=Interview: Citizen talks about 'Youth' and Memorable Band Moments|url=http://newnoisemagazine.com/interview-citizen-talks-youth-memorable-band-moments/|publisher=New Noise Magazine}}</ref> The band consists of three core members: [[Mat Kerekes]] (vocals) and brothers Nick Hamm (lead guitar), & Eric Hamm (bass). They are currently signed to [[Run For Cover Records]], and have released four studio albums to date: ''Youth'' (2013), ''Everybody is Going to Heaven'' (2015), ''As You Please'' (2017) and ''Life in Your Glass World'' (2021). Considered a part of [[emo]]'s fourth wave, ''Pitchfork'' have described Citizen as "a band their fans can grow up with rather than out of."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=Ian |title=Citizen: As You Please |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/citizen-as-you-please/ |website=Pitchfork |publisher=Pitchfork Media |access-date=29 October 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early releases (2009–2012)===
Mat Kerekes first formed the band in 2009 after departing as the drummer from his previous band, The Sound of Glory. The Sound of Glory was a metalcore band that had a large local following as well as somewhat of a regional following during their years of existence. This band included additional members of Citizen, Nick Hamm and Eric Hamm, on their same respective instruments. Additional members of the band were vocalist Josh Childress (guitarist of [[The Plot in You]]) and a second guitarist to The Sound of Glory, Joey Chester. The early material of Citizen displayed a [[melodic hardcore]] sound much unlike their present day music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newnoisemagazine.com/interview-citizen-talks-youth-memorable-band-moments/|title=Interview: Citizen talks about ‘Youth’ and Memorable Band Moments|publisher=New Noise Magazine|author=Joe Fitzpatrick|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}</ref> The band released their first demo shortly after formation. Citizen played their first show on January 28, 2010 at Frankie's Inner City in Toledo, Ohio where they opened for [[Set Your Goals (band)|Set Your Goals]].

In May 2011, the band made an appearance at Bled Fest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/bled_fest_releases_full_lineup|title=Bled Fest releases full lineup|date=March 2, 2011|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref> The band also released a split EP with The Fragile Season, titled ''The Only Place I Know.''

After signing with Run For Cover Records in March 2012, Citizen began recording a Split EP with labelmates [[Turnover (band)|Turnover]]. Run For Cover Records states that this Split marks growth and maturity for both bands as they go from up and coming locals to established national artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.runforcoverrecords.com/products/547821-citizen-turnover-split|title=Citizen / Turnover - Split|website=Run For Cover Records|language=en|access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref> After the release of Citizen and Turnover's split EP on May 22, 2012, Citizen and Turnover went on a summer tour, along with the band Light Years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/citizen_turnover_and_light_years_announce_tour|title=Citizen, Turnover and Light Years announce tour - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|language=en|access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref>

In September 2011, Citizen released an EP titled ''Young States'' which was then reissued the following year in September 2012 by Run for Cover Records. Shortly after the reissue of ''Young States'' Citizen went on a supporting tour with bands Aficionado and Mixtapes, followed by a tour with Such Gold, Mixtapes, and Raindance. Finally, Citizen went on a brief fall headlining tour with [[State Champs]] and [[Candy Hearts]] as supporting acts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/citizen_announce_headlining_tour_with_state_champs_and_candy_hearts|title=Citizen announce headlining tour with State Champs and Candy Hearts - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|language=en|access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref>

In an interview with Beyond the Pit Press,<ref>{{Citation|last=Beyond The Pit Press|title=Citizen Interview (Vans Warped Tour 2013)|date=2013-06-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-ohYEZL2MY|accessdate=2017-11-25}}</ref> when asked how Citizen came up with the title of their album, guitarist Nick Hamm stated that ''Youth'' is a coming of age record. After the Release of ''Youth'' Citizen played on the [[2013 Vans Warped Tour]]. Following the Vans Warped tour Citizen played a record release show for ''Youth'' in their Hometown of Toledo, OH.

==Style==
[[AllMusic]] biographer Jason Lymangrover who called the band's sound a merge of "bombastic emo pop, post-hardcore, and thick, chunky indie rock".<ref name=AMbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/citizen-mn0001383557/biography|title=Citizen {{!}} Biography & History|work=AllMusic|author=Lymangrover, Jason |accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref> The band has been described as [[indie rock]].<ref name=AMYouthreview>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/youth-mw0002548197|title=Youth - Citizen {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|work=AllMusic|author=Lymangrover, Jason |accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref> ''Youth'' has been described as [[emo]],<ref name="AMYouthreview"/><ref name=PNYouthreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/review/12093/citizen-youth|title=Citizen - Youth|work=Punknews.org|author=RENALDO69 |date=July 22, 2013|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref><ref name=idobiYouthreview>{{cite web|url=http://idobi.com/review/citizen-youth-album-review/|title=Citizen – Youth: Album Review|work=idobi|author=Yi, Catherine |date=July 2, 2013|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref><ref name=Spinstream>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2015/06/citizens-everybody-is-going-to-heaven-lp-premiere/|title=Stream Citizen’s Arresting ‘Everybody Is Going to Heaven’ LP |work=SPIN|author=Joyce, Colin |date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref> [[pop punk]],<ref name=Spinstream/> [[post-hardcore]],<ref name=AMYouthreview/> and [[punk rock]].<ref name=idobiYouthreview/> ''Everybody Is Going to Heaven'' has been described as [[alternative rock]],<ref name=ExclaimEIGTHreview>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/citizen-everybody_is_going_to_heaven|title=Citizen Everybody is Going to Heaven|work=Exclaim!|author=Ranjanathan, Branan |date=June 22, 2015|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref> emo,<ref name=PNEIGTHreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/review/13639/citizen-everybody-is-going-to-heaven|title=Citizen - Everybody Is Going to Heaven|work=Punknews.org|author=RENALDO69 |date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref> and [[shoegaze]].<ref name=Spinstream/><ref name=PNEIGTHreview/> Citizen has been described as a number of genres but in a 2013 interview with Cosmos Gaming,<ref>{{Citation|last=CosmosGaming1|title=Citizen interviewed at Vans Warped Tour 2013|date=2013-07-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylPcKzZJa6E|accessdate=2017-11-24}}https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylPcKzZJa6E</ref> guitar player Nick Hamm states that while people are right to assign those genres to their band he views Citizen as being simply a rock band.
