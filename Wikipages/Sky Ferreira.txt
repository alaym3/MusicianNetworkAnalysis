'''Sky Tonia Ferreira''' (born July 8, 1992) is an American singer, songwriter, model, and actress. As a teenager, Ferreira began uploading videos on [[Myspace]] of herself singing songs she had written, which led to her discovery by producers [[Bloodshy & Avant]] and a recording contract with [[Parlophone]] in 2009. She released her first [[extended play]], ''[[As If! (EP)|As If!]]'', in 2011, which combined elements of [[electropop]] and [[dance music]]. Ferreira's second EP ''[[Ghost (Sky Ferreira EP)|Ghost]]'' (2012), however, incorporated pop with more stripped-down song structures and featured collaborations with [[Jon Brion]] and [[Shirley Manson]], as well as the critically acclaimed track "[[Everything Is Embarrassing]]", which she composed with [[Dev Hynes]].

After multiple delays and disputes with her record label, Ferreira's debut [[studio album]] ''[[Night Time, My Time]]'' was released in October 2013, preceded by the lead single "[[You're Not the One]]", and marked a departure from her former style, incorporating more experimental [[indie rock]] with [[synth-pop]] elements. The album received critical acclaim. That year, she ventured into the film industry after appearing in [[Eli Roth]]'s ''[[The Green Inferno (film)|The Green Inferno]]'' and garnered media attention after being arrested for [[drug possession]]. She was exposed to a mainstream audience as one of [[Miley Cyrus]]' main opening acts on her international [[Bangerz Tour]] in 2014. While appearing in films and other projects, she released the single "[[Downhill Lullaby]]" in March 2019.

Ferreira's earlier work incorporated elements of [[dance-pop]], while her recent projects experiment with [[acoustic music|acoustic]], [[New wave music|new wave]] and primarily [[indie rock]] musical styles. Her lyrical content originally incorporated themes of rebellion and teenage romance, and has since evolved to discuss personal insecurities and more mature romantic themes. Outside her work in the entertainment industry, she has modeled for several brands and magazines, including serving as the spokeswoman for the hair care brand [[Redken]] in 2014.

Julianne Escobedo Shepberd from ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that Ferreira's "songs are catchy, but they're also thickly glazed with fuzz and synths, evoking influences like [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], [[Siouxsie Sioux]] and the krautrock group [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]]".<ref>{{cite web |author=Escobedo Shepberd, Julianne |title=Encounter: Sky Ferreira |url=http://www.rollingstoneme.com/music/encounter-sky-ferreira |work=Rolling Stone |date=December 19, 2013 |access-date=February 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092038/http://www.rollingstoneme.com/music/encounter-sky-ferreira |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Karolina Ramos from ''[[The GW Hatchet]]'' compared Ferreira to New Zealand recording artist [[Lorde]], both of whom she felt "tackle contemporary love, desire and insecurity with depth, composure and frankness." She compared her musical style to 1980s [[pop music]], and noted that "her throaty, sultry vocals call to mind [[Lana Del Rey]], abandoning brightness and vivacity for a colder tone. Still, Ferreira can drop the edge, with gentler tracks like "Sad Dream" showcasing her vocal range and seldom-observed softness."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwhatchet.com/2013/11/11/district-sound-not-your-average-month-for-indie-pop/?mode=print|title=District Sound: Not your average month for indie pop|author=Karolina Ramos|work=[[The GW Hatchet]]|date=November 11, 2013|access-date=January 12, 2014}}</ref> Andrew Unterberger stated that "through a variety of singles, EPs, guest features and live appearances, Sky has proven herself one of the most talented singers, creative songwriters and savvy collaborators currently working in the genre", but blamed "bad marketing, label disputes and her own perfectionism" for the extended delay of ''Night Time, My Time''; he also stated that the repeated renaming of the record itself "should give you some idea of the musical identity issues she's suffered over the years."<ref name="Popdust" />

After establishing a friendship with singer [[Miley Cyrus]] in 2013, Gregory E. Miller from the ''[[New York Post]]'' noted that the media and general public would continue "following her every move". Ferreira commented that "[Miley's] obviously way bigger and all eyes [are] on her, but I feel like we're kind of going through a similar thing where everyone's trying to say that we're trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It's nice to have someone that gets it." Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for ''Night Time, My Time'', to which she responded "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came on this earth nude."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/19/sky-ferreiras-the-most-wicked-woman-in-pop/|title=Sky Ferreira: Sex, drugs and Miley Cyrus|author=Gregory E.
