'''Aaron Funk''' (born January 11, 1975), known as '''Venetian Snares''', is a Canadian [[electronic music]]ian based in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. He is widely known for innovating and popularising the [[breakcore]] genre, and is one of the most recognisable artists to be signed to [[Planet Mu]], an experimental electronic music label. His signature style involves meticulously complex drums, eclectic use of [[Sampling (music)|samples]], and [[odd time signatures]], in particular, {{music|time|7|4}}.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|title = Venetian Snares {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/venetian-snares-mn0000317131/biography|website = AllMusic|access-date = January 4, 2016|archive-date = March 14, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160314192824/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/venetian-snares-mn0000317131/biography|url-status = live}}</ref>

His 2005 release, ''[[Rossz Csillag Alatt Született]],'' combined breakbeats with orchestral samples, and was released to critical acclaim, helping bring the artist and genre into popularity within the experimental electronic music community. 

Funk is a very prolific musician, often releasing several records each year, sometimes on several different record labels, including Planet Mu, Hymen, Sublight, and his own imprint Timesig, and also under different aliases, including '''Last Step''', '''Snares Man!''', '''Snares''', and '''Speed Dealer Moms'''. He has also explored other electronic genres such as [[Glitch (music)|glitch]], [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]], [[Contemporary classical music|modern classical]] and [[acid techno]].

== Career ==

=== 1990s to early 2000s: ''Greg Hates Car Culture'' ===
Funk began producing music at least as early as 1992,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/08802-venetian-snares-last-step-interview-sleep|title=The Quietus {{!}} Features {{!}} In Extremis {{!}} The Man Don't Give A Funk: Venetian Snares Interviewed|work=The Quietus|access-date=April 15, 2018|archive-date=September 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210906051813/https://thequietus.com/articles/08802-venetian-snares-last-step-interview-sleep|url-status=live}}</ref> when he was experimenting with several '[[ghetto blaster]]s':{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} <blockquote>I'd use a bunch of ghetto blasters playing all at once to play different sounds I'd recorded with some shitty ghetto blaster. Most of my sources I'd get riding around on my bicycle and just listening for interesting sounds. I'd use garbage bins and streetlights and anything else I could find that was hollow or metallic to bang out rhythms on. Then I'd set up all the ghettos and record them all playing into that same ghetto blaster. Then I'd play a bunch of those tapes all at the same time and record that and so on. Then I would do cut-ups or pause-ups of those tapes to create a more startling rhythmic effect. A strange ritual in retrospect.<br />
I somehow came across this looping delay pedal that would hold a 2 second sample. This pedal coupled with the ghetto blaster experiments really changed my life.</blockquote>Funk then got an [[Amiga 500]] computer, where he initially produced music through a music tracker, [[OctaMED]]. He formed the name 'Venetian Snares' after '...writing a track with really fast snare rolls that sounded like scraping a stick across a grate or running a pencil down venetian blinds in a distracted classroom'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Venetian Snares interview on c8 |url=http://www.isolaterecords.com/vsnaresinterview.html |date=January 9, 2001 |access-date=January 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010109140300/http://www.isolaterecords.com/vsnaresinterview.html |archive-date=January 9, 2001 }}</ref>

He would self-release several cassettes during the 90's, before making his first official release with the 1999 12" EP, ''[[Greg Hates Car Culture]]'', followed by a split album with Stunt Rock, ''Fuck Canada // Fuck America'', and more EPs in the next year 2000, including ''[[Salt (Venetian Snares album)|Salt]], [[7 Sevens.med|7 sevens.med]], [[Shitfuckers!!!|Shitfuckers!]],'' and his first full-length album, ''[[printf("shiver in eternal darkness/n");]].'' Funk then moved to using a [[Personal computer|PC]] sometime before 2000, producing music in MED Soundstudio, a Windows port of OctoMED.<ref>{{cite web|title = Designer label|url = http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may02/articles/paradinas.asp|website = Soundonsound.com|access-date = January 5, 2016|archive-date = March 3, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174707/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may02/articles/paradinas.asp|url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Early-to-mid 2000s: Planet Mu Records and prolific output ===
After hearing ''Greg Hates Car Culture'' while browsing a [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Minneapolis]] record store,<ref>{{cite web|title = Venetian Snares|url = http://www.planet.mu/artists/venetian-snares|website = Planet Mu Records|access-date = January 4, 2016|archive-date = May 6, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042838/http://planet.mu/artists/venetian-snares/|url-status = live}}</ref> [[Mike Paradinas]] (also known as μ-Ziq) immediately signed Funk on to his record label Planet Mu, leading to three releases for the label in 2001, a collaboration album with Speedranch, ''[[Making Orange Things]],'' a 7" EP, ''[[Defluxion / Boarded Up Swan Entrance|Defluxion]],'' and a full-length album, ''Songs About My Cats''. In addition, he also released ''[[Doll Doll Doll]]'', as well as split 12" with [[Cex (musician)|Cex]] and a [[raggacore]] 7" as Snares Man!, all in the same year. The Snares Man! 7" has been cited as influential in the development of raggacore.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Breakcore : Identity and Interaction on Peer-to-Peer.|last=Whelan, Andrew.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443811675|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|pages=259–261|oclc=828302790}}
*"the first time Raggacore became well known was with VENETIAN SNARES–"snares man" 7" (History of the future) and KNIFEHANDCHOP–"bounty killer killer" 7" (irritant/dyhane) in 2001 and BLOODCLAAT GANGSTA YOUTH–"kill or be killed" 7" (full watts). This was the first when it wasn't Ragga Jungle any more but a step beyond"
*"LFO Demon begins by delineating the isogloss with which "raggacore" becomes differentiable, identifying relevant precursors and innovators (with Venetian Snares' Snares Man singled out in particular, a release, incidentally, featured in DJ /rupture's acclaimed debut, Gold Teeth Thief)."</ref> The following year, 2002, Funk released three full-length albums, ''[[Higgins Ultra Low Track Glue Funk Hits 1972–2006]],''  ''[[2370894]]'' (Under Vsnares), and ''[[Winter in the Belly of a Snake]],'' plus a 15-minute limited edition EP, ''[[A Giant Alien Force More Violent & Sick Than Anything You Can Imagine]]''. 2003 saw the release of ''[[The Chocolate Wheelchair Album]]'', ''[[Find Candace]]'', a 7" EP ''[[Badminton (album)|Badminton]]'', two split 7" EPs, one with Fanny under '''BeeSnares''', and the other with Phantomsmasher, and an experimental collaboration album with [[Hecate (musician) | Hecate]], ''[[Nymphomatriarch]].'' Following 2004, Funk released ''[[Huge Chrome Cylinder Box Unfolding]]'', three EPs, ''Horse And Goat,'' ''[[Infolepsy|Infolepsy EP]],'' and ''[[Moonglow/This Bitter Earth]]'' and a remix of Doormouse's [[Skelechairs]]. During this time period, Funk started using [[Steinberg Cubase|Cubase]] next to MED.

=== Mid-2000s to mid-2010s: ''Rossz Csillag Alatt Született'' and slowing output ===
[[File:Aaron Funk.jpg |thumb|Funk performing at Bangface Weekender 2008]]
Funk first released in 2005 his tribute album to his hometown, ''[[Winnipeg Is a Frozen Shithole|Winnipeg is a Frozen Shithole]],'' before releasing ''[[Rossz Csillag Alatt Született]],'' an album inspired by Funk's recent Hungary trip that combines fast breakbeats with classical strings and trumpets, to critical acclaim. [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] called it Funk's '...most accomplished album to date', describing the album as '... of uncouth beauty that is at once sublime, timeless, cinematic, sporadic, and moving from start to finish for the uppity junglist or the CBC Radio 1 listener in your family'.<ref>{{cite web|title = Music Review: Venetian Snares - Rossz csillag alatt született|url = http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/venetian-snares-rossz-csillag-alatt-sz%C3%A3%25C2%25BCletett|website = Tiny Mix Tapes|access-date = January 5, 2016|archive-date = March 3, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182206/http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/venetian-snares-rossz-csillag-alatt-sz%C3%A3%C2%BCletett|url-status = live}}</ref> At the same year, Funk has also released another album, ''[[Meathole]],'' and debuted under his new acid-oriented alias, Last Step, in ''You're a Nice Girl''.

In the later years, Funk's amount of releases would decrease to at least one each year, compared to as many as six earlier before. The next year, 2006, Funk released one album, ''[[Cavalcade of Glee and Dadaist Happy Hardcore Pom Poms]],'' and a single EP, [[Hospitality (Venetian Snares album)|Hospitality]]. 2007 saw the release another classical-styled album, ''[[My Downfall (Original Soundtrack)]],'' an EP, Pink + Green, a 10" series of dubstep-styled [[Black Sabbath]] covers under Snares, and his first full-length self-titled album under Last Step. Funk followed it next year, 2008, with another Last Step album, [[1961 (album)|1961]]. He also released the ''[[Detrimentalist]]'' album and the ''Miss Balaton'' single in the same year. 2009 saw the release of the album ''[[Filth (Venetian Snares album)|Filth]],'' and the ''Horsey Noises'' EP. Afterwards in 2010, Funk released the ''[[My So-Called Life (Venetian Snares album)|My So-Called Life]]'' album and a 12" collaboration with [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]] under Speed Dealer Moms. Funk's only release in 2011 is the EP ''[[Cubist Reggae]].'' 2012 saw three new releases by Funk, with two EPs ''[[Fool the Detector|Fool The Detector]] and [[Affectionate (EP)|Affectionate]],'' and a Last Step album, ''Sleep.'' After an unusual absence in 2013, Funk's next release came in 2014 with a new album, ''[[My Love Is a Bulldozer|My Love is a Bulldozer]],'' as well as a self-titled debut collaboration album with Joanne Pollock, [[Poemss]], and a self-released Last Step EP, ''Lost Sleep''. Funk released the EP, ''[[Your Face (EP)|Your Face]],'' the following year 2015.

=== 2015–present: Bandcamp ===

Funk reached out to fans in 2015 for financial assistance in light of undisclosed circumstances. After an outpouring of support, he released [[Thank You for Your Consideration|a "thank you" album]] in appreciation.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Ryce |first1=Andrew |title=Venetian Snares makes Traditional Synthesizer Music on new LP |work=Resident Advisor |date=2015-12-17 |url=https://ra.co/news/32653 |language=en |access-date=2021-09-05 |df=mdy-all |archive-date=January 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210130182915/https://ra.co/news/32653 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Funk released a new album on February 19, 2016, called ''[[Traditional Synthesizer Music]]''. This album was the product of Funk's experimentations with [[modular synthesizer]]s, and was created exclusively on modular synthesizer hardware.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=February 1, 2021|title=Venetian Snares: Traditional Synthesizer Music|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21571-traditional-synthesizer-music/|website=Pitchfork|archive-date=February 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210206124656/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21571-traditional-synthesizer-music/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=February 1, 2021|title=Venetian Snares - Traditional Synthesizer Music|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/venetian-snares-traditional-synthesizer-music|website=Clash Magazine|archive-date=February 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210205205133/https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/venetian-snares-traditional-synthesizer-music|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|accessdate=February 1, 2021|title=Album Review: Venetian Snares - Traditional Synthesizer Music|url=https://drownedinsound.com/releases/19267/reviews/4149808|newspaper=DrownedInSound|archive-date=June 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210621070701/https://drownedinsound.com/releases/19267/reviews/4149808|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2017, Funk announced a collaboration with [[Daniel Lanois]]. This was recorded in Toronto and released in 2018 as ''[[Venetian Snares x Daniel Lanois]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hughes |first1=Josiah |title=Venetian Snares and Daniel Lanois Detail Collaborative LP |url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/venetian_snares_and_daniel_lanois_detail_collaborative_lp |access-date=April 28, 2019 |work=Exclaim |date=February 22, 2018 |archive-date=April 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428134349/https://exclaim.ca/music/article/venetian_snares_and_daniel_lanois_detail_collaborative_lp |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Musical style==
Funk is well known for using odd time signatures, especially {{music|time|7|4}}. For instance, the track 'Szamár Madár' from ''[[Rossz Csillag Alatt Született]]'' uses a sample from [[Edward Elgar]]'s '[[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto]]', edited into a {{music|time|7|4}} time signature.<ref name="Curry">{{cite web |last1=Curry |first1=Oliver |title=Bored of 4/4 |url=https://www.attackmagazine.com/technique/passing-notes/bored-of-44-other-time-signatures-in-dance-music/3/ |website=Attack |access-date=April 28, 2019 |archive-date=April 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428120311/https://www.attackmagazine.com/technique/passing-notes/bored-of-44-other-time-signatures-in-dance-music/3/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The album ''[[Thank You for Your Consideration]]'' also employs unusual meters instead of the {{music|time|4|4}} time used in most electronic music.<ref name="Cronell">{{cite web |last1=Cornell |first1=Reuben |title=10 dance music classics that aren't in 4/4 time |url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/10-dance-music-classics-that-arent-in-4-4-time-630992 |website=Music Radar |access-date=April 28, 2019 |archive-date=April 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428120318/https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/10-dance-music-classics-that-arent-in-4-4-time-630992 |url-status=live }}</ref>
