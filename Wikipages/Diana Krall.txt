== Career ==
[[File:Diana Krall 1998.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Krall in 1998]]
Krall recorded her first album, ''[[Stepping Out (Diana Krall album)|Stepping Out]]'', for [[Justin Time Records]] in 1992; the album was released in 1993. She was accompanied by bassist [[John Clayton (bassist)|John Clayton]] and [[Jeff Hamilton (drummer)|Jeff Hamilton]]. It caught the attention of producer [[Tommy LiPuma]], who produced her second album, ''[[Only Trust Your Heart]]'' (1995).

Her third album, ''[[All for You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio]]'' (1996), was nominated for a [[Grammy award|Grammy]] and continued for 70 weeks in the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' jazz charts. ''[[Love Scenes (Diana Krall album)|Love Scenes]]'' (1997) quickly became a hit record with the trio of Krall, [[Russell Malone]] (guitar) and [[Christian McBride]] (bass).

In August 2000, Krall partnered with [[Tony Bennett]] for a 20-city tour, and in 2008-9 they worked together again for a song on the TV series ''[[Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...]]''

Orchestral arrangements by [[Johnny Mandel]] provided the background for her fifth studio album ''[[When I Look In Your Eyes]]'' (1999), her first released through [[Verve Records]]. The band mix was kept, following arrangements on ''[[The Look of Love (Diana Krall album)|The Look of Love]]'' (2001) created by [[Claus Ogerman]]; this record achieved platinum status and reached the top 10 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The title track from the album, a cover of the ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' standard popularized in the late 1960s by [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[Sérgio Mendes]], reached number 22 on the adult contemporary chart.

In September 2001, Krall began a world tour. Her concert at the [[Paris Olympia]] was recorded and released in 2002 as her first live record, ''[[Live in Paris (Diana Krall album)|Live in Paris]]'' (issued with a different European title, ''A Night In Paris''). The album included covers of [[Billy Joel]]'s "Just the Way You Are" (a hit on U.S. [[smooth jazz]] radio) and [[Joni Mitchell]]'s "A Case Of You", and was also released as a video album.

The 2001 movie "[[The Score (2001 film)|The Score]]" (US and Germany), starring Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando, featured a recording of Krall's entitled: "I'll Make It Up As I Go." This song accompanies the film's ending credits (chapter 12) and was composed by fellow Canadian, [[David Foster]].<ref>DVD (ending Credits), Universum Film GmbH & Co. KG., Constantin Films and BMG Video, Germany, 2005</ref>

After marrying English singer-songwriter [[Elvis Costello]] in 2003, Krall worked with him as a lyricist and began to compose her own songs, resulting in the album ''[[The Girl in the Other Room]]''. Released in April 2004, it quickly rose to the top five in the United Kingdom and made the Australian top 40 album charts. She also joined [[Ray Charles]] on his ''[[Genius Loves Company]]'' album in 2004 for the song "[[You Don't Know Me (Eddy Arnold song)|You Don't Know Me]]", and her 2004 performance at [[Bell Centre]], Montreal on 29 June was released as her second live CD and DVD, ''[[Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival]]'', released on 23 November 2004.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sabbatini|first1=Mark|title=Diana Krall: Live At The Montreal Jazz Festival|url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/diana-krall-live-at-the-montreal-jazz-festival-diana-krall-by-mark-sabbatini.php|website=[[All About Jazz]]|publisher=allaboutjazz.com|accessdate=16 November 2017|date=7 February 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Diana Krall Live at the Montréal Jazz Festival|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-montr%C3%A9al-jazz-festival-mw0001005750|website=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=James|first1=Brian|title=Diana Krall: Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival [DVD]|url=https://www.popmatters.com/kralldiana-livemontrealdvd-2495957095.html|website=[[PopMatters]]|publisher=popmatters.com|accessdate=16 November 2017|date=6 April 2005}}</ref>

In late May 2007, Krall was featured in a [[Lexus]] ad campaign.<ref>{{YouTube|456ksLJu4Bo|Lexus commercial}}</ref> That year she also sang "[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]" with piano accompaniment by pianist [[Hank Jones]] for an "all-star" tribute album ''[[We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song]]'' (2007) produced by [[Phil Ramone]].
