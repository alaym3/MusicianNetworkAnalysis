==Career==

Under her original name she provided backing vocals on [[Richard James (musician)|Richard James]]'s debut solo album ''The Seven Sleepers Den'' in 2006.

==Musical style==
Critic Laura Snapes described Le Bon as "a ringleader who's prepared to stake out uncertain territory. Le Bon always keeps you guessing, making the old traditions of guitar-oriented rock feel arbitrary, too. Her nervy assessments of the world are filled with equal parts suspense and heart, and beautifully zany riffs, where the feeling of being frayed by uncertainty comes together into a strangely comforting patchwork."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21636-crab-day|title=Cate Le Bon - "Crab Day"|date=15 April 2016|website=Pitchfork.com|last=Snapes|first=Lauras}}</ref> In an interview with ''Pitchfork'', [[Jeff Tweedy]] of [[Wilco]] stated that Le Bon was "one of the best out there making music now." Describing her sound, he said "it's really rare for people to have a specific sound anymore, but I can always tell when it's her playing guitar. Whenever I try to figure out her guitar parts, they’re way harder than they sound."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Music That Made Wilco's Jeff Tweedy |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/the-music-that-made-wilcos-jeff-tweedy/ |website=Pitchfork.com |access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref>
