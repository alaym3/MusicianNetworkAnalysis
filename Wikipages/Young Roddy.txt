'''Roderick Brisco''' (born September 20, 1986), better known by his stage name '''Young Roddy''' (or simply '''Roddy'''), is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist signed to [[Jet Life Recordings]] and [[iHipHop Distribution]].

==Early life==
Young Roddy was born and raised in [[Kenner, Louisiana]], [[New Orleans Metropolitan Area]] in [[Jefferson Parish]].

Growing up, Roddy was an avid basketball player and aspired to play professionally. After [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, Roddy's mother, with whom he lived at the time, moved to Texas. Roddy did not want to leave [[New Orleans]], however, and moved in with a friend who made beats and had a home studio. At this time, Roddy began to freestyle in cyphers with his friends. Roddy's friends were impressed by his skills, encouraged him to continue freestyling for them, and eventually suggested that he invest more time in his music. Despite this positive feedback and Roddy's genuine passion for music, he still did not see rap as a serious pursuit. Although he enjoyed freestyling, he was not recording music and resisted his cousin's repeated attempts to get him in the studio. Roddy was only goaded into visiting the studio when his cousin told him that [[Young Money]] would be recording in the same space. Roddy would go on to meet [[Curren$y]] at this studio. After hearing Roddy freestyle, Curren$y asked Roddy to join a new group that he was assembling and the two began to collaborate.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZCo5vSr-o8 "Video: Young Roddy - The Kenner Loop Documentary (Part 1)"] ''iHipHop Distribution'', December 14, 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6kvJRvSTSw "Video: Young Roddy - The Kenner Loop Documentary (Part 2)"] ''iHipHop Distribution'', December 14, 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUryupN5CRsVideo: Young Roddy - The Kenner Loop Documentary (Part 3)"] ''iHipHop Distribution'', December 14, 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNBVrzPCMsMVideo: Young Roddy - The Kenner Loop Documentary (Part 4)"] ''iHipHop Distribution'', December 14, 2015</ref>

Roddy would go on to appear on each of the next six mixtapes that Curren$y released in 2008, as well as on his debut studio album in 2009.
