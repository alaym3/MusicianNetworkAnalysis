Westenra's third international album, ''[[Treasure (Hayley Westenra album)|Treasure]]'', was released on 26 February 2007 in the UK. All the songs on this CD were chosen by Westenra, who gave her record company "no say in the matter." She said, "I basically didn't let them in on what I was recording until the last minute so they had no choice. I didn't give them much room to disagree."<ref name="info_on_treasure_Herald">"Hayley Westenra in charge of her career", The New Zealand Herald, 28 April 2007. Lexis Nexis. Susquehanna University. 25 May 2007.</ref>

Tracks on this album include "E Pari Ra", "One Fine Day", "Let Me Lie", "[[Danny Boy]]", and "[[Abide with Me]]". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also features singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name ''Celtic Treasure''. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: <blockquote>"I come from a musical family, and one with a real sense of history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch]], which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like ''Danny Boy'' from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album."</blockquote>

On the day before [[St. Patrick's Day]] 2007, she performed as part of Celtic Woman for President [[George W. Bush]] at the [[White House]].<ref name="ucj_article">"UCJ to target Aussies and Kiwis for latest Hayley Westenra album." Music Week (17 March 2007): 20. InfoTrac OneFile. Thomson Gale.
