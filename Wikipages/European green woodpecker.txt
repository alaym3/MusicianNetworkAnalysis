The '''European green woodpecker''' (''Picus viridis'') is a large green [[woodpecker]] with a bright red crown and a black moustache. Males have a red centre to the moustache stripe which is absent in females. It is resident across much of Europe and the western Palearctic but in Spain and Portugal it is replaced by the similar [[Iberian green woodpecker]] (''Picus sharpei'').

The European green woodpecker spends much of its time feeding on [[ant]]s on the ground and does not often 'drum' on trees like other woodpecker species. Though its vivid green and red plumage is particularly striking, it is a shy bird, and is more often heard than seen, drawing attention with its loud calls. A nest hole is excavated in a tree; four to six eggs are laid which hatch after 19–20 days.

==Taxonomy==
The European green woodpecker was [[Species description|formally described]] by the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' under its current [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] ''Picus viridis''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=Carl | author-link=Carl Linnaeus | year=1758 | title= Systema Naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis | volume=Volume 1 | edition=10th | page=113| publisher=Laurentii Salvii | place=Holmiae (Stockholm) | language=la | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/727018 }}</ref>  The [[type locality (biology)|type locality]] is Sweden.<ref>{{ cite book | editor-last=Peters | editor-first=James Lee | editor-link=James L.

The [[Iberian green woodpecker]] (''Picus sharpei'') and [[Levaillant's woodpecker]] (''Picus vaillantii'') were formerly considered as subspecies of the European green woodpecker.

==Description==
The European green woodpecker measures {{cvt|30|–|36|cm}} in length with a {{cvt|45|–|51|cm}} wingspan. Both sexes are green above and pale yellowish green below, with yellow rump and red crown and nape; the moustachial stripe has a red centre in the male but is solid black in the female. The [[Lore (anatomy)|lores]] and around the white eye are black in both male and female, except in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]n race ''P. v.'' subsp. ''sharpei'', in which it is dark grey and males have only a lower black border to the moustache. Juveniles are spotty and streaked all over;<ref name="collins">{{Cite book | last1 = Mullarney | first1 = Killian | last2 = Svensson | first2 = Lars | last3 = Zetterstrom | first3 = Dan | last4 = Grant | first4 = Peter | title = Collins Bird Guide | publisher = HarperCollins | location = London | year = 1999 | pages = 224–225 | isbn = 978-0-00-219728-1}}</ref> the moustache is dark initially, though juvenile males can show some red feathers by early June or usually by July or August.<ref name="baker">{{Cite book | last = Baker | first = Kevin | title = Identification Guide to European Non-Passerines: BTO Guide 24 | publisher = [[British Trust for Ornithology]] | location = Thetford | year = 1993 | pages = 314–315 | isbn = 978-0-903793-18-6}}</ref>

Moult takes place between June and November with the first flight feathers being lost around the time the young fledge. Juveniles moult quickly after fledging and gain their adult plumage between August and November.<ref>RSPB Handbook of British Birds (2014). {{ISBN|978-1-4729-0647-2}}.</ref>

Although the European green woodpecker is shy and wary, it is usually its loud calls, known as yaffling, which first draw attention. It 'drums' rarely (a soft, fast roll), but often gives a noisy ''kyü-kyü-kyück'' while flying. The song is a loud series of 10–18 'klü' sounds which gets slightly faster towards the end and falls slightly in pitch.<ref name="collins"/> The female makes a thinner ''pü-pü-pü-pü-pü-pü-pü''.<ref name="jonsson">{{Cite book | last = Jonsson | first = Lars | author-link = Lars Jonsson (illustrator) | title = Birds of Europe | publisher = Helm | location = London | year = 1996 | page = 342 | isbn = 978-0-7136-4422-7}}</ref> The flight is undulating, with 3–4 wingbeats followed by a short glide when the wings are held by the body.<ref name="bwpi">{{cite book |title = BWPi: ''The Birds of the Western Palearctic'' on interactive DVD-ROM |year = 2004 |location=London |publisher = BirdGuides Ltd. and Oxford University Press |isbn = 978-1-898110-39-2}}</ref>

It can be distinguished from the similar, but smaller, [[grey-headed woodpecker]] by its yellowish, not grey, underparts, and the black lores and facial 'mask'.<ref name="baker"/> In Europe, its green upperparts and yellow rump can lead to confusion with the grey-headed woodpecker or possibly the female [[golden oriole]], though the latter is smaller and more slender with narrower wings and longer tail. The closely related,<ref name="bwpi"/> very similar [[Levaillant's woodpecker]] occurs only in north-west [[Africa]].<ref name="collins"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Picus viridis sharpei 108b.jpg|thumb|A juvenile male eats ants with the help of his tongue.]]More than 75% of the range of the European green woodpecker is in [[Europe]], where it is absent from some northern and eastern parts and from [[Ireland]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Macaronesian Islands]], but otherwise distributed widely. Over half of the European population is thought to be in France and Germany, with substantial numbers also in [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], [[Russia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]].<ref name="bin">{{Cite book | last = Tucker | first = Graham M. |author2=Heath, Melanie F. | title = Birds in Europe: Their Conservation Status | series = BirdLife Conservation Series | volume = 3 | publisher = [[BirdLife International]] | location = Cambridge | year = 1995 | pages = 346–347 | isbn = 978-0-946888-29-0}}</ref> It also occurs in western [[Asia]].<ref name="bwpi"/>

The European green woodpecker has a large range and an Estimated Global Extent of Occurrence of between 1 million to 10 million square kilometres, and a population in the region of 920,000 to 2.9 million birds. Populations appear to be stable, so the species is considered of Least Concern.<ref name="bli">{{cite web| title= Eurasian Green Woodpecker | work= Datazone | url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=730 | publisher= [[BirdLife International]] | access-date=4 January 2011}}</ref> The species is highly sedentary<ref name="jonsson"/> and individuals rarely move more than around 500&nbsp;m between breeding seasons.<ref name="bwpi"/>

A combination of old deciduous trees for nesting, and nearby feeding grounds with plenty of [[ant]]s, is essential. This is usually found in semi-open landscapes with small woodlands, [[Hedge (barrier)|hedges]], scattered old trees, edges of forests and floodplain forests. Suitable habitats for foraging include grassland, [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s, [[Forestry|plantations]], [[orchard]]s and [[lawn]]s.<ref name="bli"/>

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
[[File:Picus viridis MHNT ZOO 2010 11 162 HdB Miramas.jpg|thumb|Eggs of ''Picus viridis '' [[MHNT]]]]
The nesting hole is larger but similar to those of the other woodpeckers. It may be a few feet above the ground or at the top of a tall tree; [[Quercus|oaks]], [[beeches]], [[Salix|willows]] and fruit trees are the preferred nest trees in western and central Europe, and [[Populus|aspens]] in the north.<ref name="bin"/> The hole may be excavated in sound or rotten wood, with an entrance hole of {{cvt|60|×|75|mm}}. The cavity inside may be 150&nbsp;mm wide and up to {{cvt|40|cm}} deep<ref name="tracks">{{Cite book | last1 = Brown | first1 = Roy | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = John | last3 = Lawrence | first3 = Michael | last4 = Lees | first4 = David | title = Tracks & Signs of the Birds of Britain & Europe – an Identification Guide | publisher = Helm | location = London | year = 1999 | page = 91 | isbn = 978-0-7136-5208-6}}</ref> and the work is performed mostly by the male over 15–30 days. Some tree holes are used for breeding for more than 10 years, but not necessarily by the same pair.<ref name="bwpi"/>

There is a single brood of four to six white eggs, measuring {{cvt|31|×|23|mm}} and weighing {{cvt|8.9|g}} each, of which 7% is shell. After the last egg is laid, they are incubated for 19–20 days by both parents taking shifts of between 1.5 and 2.5 hours.<ref name="bwpi"/> The chicks are naked and [[altricial]] at hatching and fledge after 21–24 days.<ref name="bto"/>

===Food and feeding===
The main food of the European green woodpecker is [[ant]]s of the [[Genus|genera]] ''[[Lasius]]'' and ''[[Formica]]''<ref name="bli"/> for which it spends much of its time foraging on the ground,<ref name="collins"/> though other [[insect]]s and small [[reptile]]s are also taken occasionally.<ref name="bwpi"/> The bird's distinctive, elongated, cylindrical droppings often consist entirely of ant remains.<ref name="tracks"/> At ant nests, it probes into the ground and licks up adult ants and their larvae.<ref name="bwpi"/> They have tongues that wrap to the back of their head.<ref name=tongue>{{cite journal |last=Goodge |first=W R|year=1972 |title=Anatomical Evidence for Phylogenetic Relationships Among Woodpecker |journal= The Auk|volume=89 |issue=1|pages=65–85 |doi=10.2307/4084060|jstor=4084060}}</ref> Green woodpeckers will often forage in short grazed or mown permanent grasslands where the availability of ant nests is high.<ref>Alder, D., & Marsden, S.

[[Image:Greenwoodpeckerdropping 3414.JPG|thumb|left|Dropping opened to show ant remains]]A study of a nest in [[Romania]] found that 10 species of ant were fed to the chicks. During the first 10 days, the young received an average of {{cvt|15|g}} each, from days 10–20, {{cvt|39.5|g}}, and from day 20, {{cvt|49.3|g}}. The seven chicks consumed an estimated 1.5 million ants and pupae before leaving the nest.<ref name="bwpi"/>
