==Early life==
Usher was born as Usher Raymond IV on October 14, 1978 in [[Dallas, Texas]].<ref name=swe>{{Cite news|last=Millner|first=Denene|title=Joining The Class Struggle R&b Superstar Plays The Leader Of A School Revolt In 'Light It Up'|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] | location=New York City|date=November 9, 1999|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1999/11/09/1999-11-09_joining_the_class_struggle_r.html|access-date=September 25, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120709145923/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-11-09/entertainment/18114908_1_police-harassment-movie-theater-deplorable| archive-date=July 9, 2012}}</ref> His parents were Jonetta Patton ([[née]] O'Neal; from [[Tennessee]]) and Usher Raymond III.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2008/1/19/120383/Raymond-Usher-Urkie-III.aspx |title=Raymond, Usher "Urkie" III |publisher=Chattanoogan.com |access-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfponline.com/obituaries/2014/mar/08/etta-berry/ |title=Obit &#124; Etta Berry &#124; |work=Times Free Press |via=tfponline.com |access-date=July 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114703/http://www.tfponline.com/obituaries/2014/mar/08/etta-berry/ |archive-date=August 26, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He spent the majority of his young life in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. His father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga when he was nine years old. There, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally.<ref name="ReidKing">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/u/usher/news_feature_052404/index.jhtml|title=Usher: King Me|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|publisher= MTV |access-date=November 18, 2008}}</ref> Believing that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher's family moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers.<ref name="Driven">{{citation|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/81589/episode_about.jhtml |title=Driven: Usher |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511180930/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/81589/episode_about.jhtml |website=[[VH1]] |archive-date=May 11, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While in Atlanta, he attended [[North Springs Charter School of Arts and Sciences|North Springs High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/21134|title=North Springs High School| work= PublicSchoolReview.com|access-date=November 18, 2008}}</ref>

==Career==
===Late 1980s–1996: Musical beginnings and ''Usher''===
At age ten, Usher joined an R&B local quintet called the NuBeginnings, which was organized by local music promoter Darryl Wheeler. Usher recorded ten songs with the group in 1991, and the ensuing album, ''Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV'', was only made available regionally and by [[mail order]].<ref name="D'AngeloNu">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452594/20020225/usher.jhtml|title=Early Usher Recordings Get A Nubeginning|last= D'Angelo|first=Joe|date=February 5, 2002|publisher=MTV|access-date=November 18, 2008}}</ref> However, Patton took him out because, according to her, it was a "bad experience".<ref name="ReidKing"/> The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records.<ref name="D'AngeloNu"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/76674/hip-o-turns-back-the-clock-on-usher |title=Hip-O Turns Back The Clock On Usher |last= Carpenter |first=Troy |date=February 25, 2002 |work=Billboard |access-date=January 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623065607/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/76674/hip-o-turns-back-the-clock-on-usher |archive-date= June 23, 2013 }}</ref>

At age 13, Usher met A.J. Alexander at a local talent show in Atlanta.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://dujour.com/news/usher-remembers-whitney/|title=Usher Remembers Whitney |date= November 1, 2012|work=DuJour|access-date=March 9, 2017}}</ref> Alexander, who at the time was [[Bobby Brown]]'s bodyguard, would take Usher around and have him perform in parking lots and talent shows.<ref>{{Cite news|last=blove|first=|date=November 12, 2007|title=Usher: Thanks For Keeping My Throne Warm ...|work=[[HipHopDX]]|url=http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.926/title.usher-thanks-for-keeping-my-throne-warm|access-date=March 9, 2017}}</ref> Alexander invited Bryant Reid, an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative from [[LaFace Records]] to see Usher perform on the television talent show ''[[Star Search]]''. Following the performance, he arranged an audition for Usher with [[L.A. Reid]], the co-founder of LaFace; Reid signed Usher on the spot to a contract with the record company after Usher sang [[Boyz II Men]] hit record "[[End of the Road (Boyz II Men song)|End of the Road]]".<ref name="AllmusicBio">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p44890|pure_url=yes}}|title=Usher: Biography|last= Lane|first=Lynda|website=Allmusic|access-date= November 18, 2008}}</ref><ref name="BillUsher">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045641/usher |title=Usher |last=Hope |first=Clover |date=May 5, 2008 |work=Billboard |access-date=December 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630134621/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045641/usher |archive-date= June 30, 2013 }}</ref> Usher's mother left her job as a medical technician to manage his career. Usher was introduced to the public on "[[Call Me a Mack]]", a song he recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 [[drama film|drama]]-[[romance film]] ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]''.<ref name="D'AngeloNu"/> During this time period, the young Usher first met [[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli]] of [[TLC (group)|TLC]], his label-mate whom he would later date.

Preparing for his debut album, Usher lost his voice. Usher was going through puberty and had a difficult time adjusting his voice. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher and put his album on hold; he thought about dropping him from the label.<ref>{{cite web|title = Bieber voice drop OK with label, thanks to Usher|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/justin-bieber-voice-drop-record-label-idj-thanks-usher-puberty-crisis-1994-article-1.135827| work = New York Daily News|access-date = December 11, 2015}}</ref> Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and they did. From this point Reid didn't know what to do with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with record executive [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]] to "attend" what Reid called "Flavor Camp". Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he described this period as the "hardest days" of his life. "I had to knuckle up, figure shit out in New York" he said.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/ushers-wild-rid-20040513?page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808092349/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/ushers-wild-rid-20040513?page=4|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2016|title=Usher's Wild Ride|date=May 13, 2004|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 9, 2016}}</ref>

On August 30, 1994, LaFace released Usher's [[Usher (album)|self-titled debut album]] behind the co-executive production of [[Sean Combs|Sean "P Diddy" Combs]].<ref name="AllmusicBio" /> ''Usher'' peaked at number twenty-five on the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart and was accompanied by three singles: "[[Can U Get wit It]]", "[[Think of You (Usher song)|Think of You]]", and "[[The Many Ways]]".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p44890|pure_url=yes}}|title=Usher: Billboard Albums|website= Allmusic |access-date=November 18, 2008}}</ref> The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date.<ref name="PeopleBio">{{cite web|url= http://www.people.com/people/usher/biography|title=Usher: Biography|work=People|page=1|access-date=December 21, 2008}}</ref> The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex, and him only being 15 years old, the public had a difficult time believing that this was so. Again LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn't as successful as they anticipated. At this time Usher's mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately giving L.A. Reid more confidence in Usher.

After graduating from high school, Usher continued to develop his skills as a stage performer and laid the groundwork for his second album. He also appeared on LaFace's version of "Let's Straighten It Out", a 1995 duet with fellow Atlanta teen recording artist [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica]];<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r212045|pure_url=yes}}|title=Panther: Review|last= Hamilton|first=Andrew|website=Allmusic|access-date=November 18, 2008}}</ref> and on "Dreamin'", from LaFace's [[1996 Olympic Games]] benefit album ''Rhythm of the Games''. He was also featured on "I Swear I'm In Love" off the soundtrack to the 1996 film ''[[Kazaam]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://uk.music.yahoo.com/track/1161982|title=I Swear I'm In Love – Usher|publisher= Yahoo!|access-date=November 21, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513100002/http://uk.music.yahoo.com/track/1161982|archive-date= May 13, 2008}}</ref>

===1997–2003: ''My Way'' and ''8701''===
Usher developed a friendship with American record producer [[Jermaine Dupri]], with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, ''[[My Way (Usher album)|My Way]]'', released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, "[[You Make Me Wanna...]]", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; this resulted in him increasing in popularity.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000468801 |title=Usher, Michael Notch U.K. No. 1s |last=Sexton |first= Paul |date=March 22, 2004 |work=Billboard |access-date=December 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114040855/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000468801 |archive-date= January 14, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=952204 |title=Usher Makes U.K. Wanna |date=January 29, 1998 |work=Billboard |access-date= December 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090114040222/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=952204 |archive-date=January 14, 2009 }}</ref> It also became Usher's first [[RIAA certification|gold- and platinum-certified single]] in the United States.<ref name="RIAA1">{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Usher&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold and Platinum|work=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|page=2|access-date=November 22, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017092344/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Usher&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archive-date=October 17, 2015}}</ref> The album's second single, "[[Nice & Slow]]", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], giving Usher his first US number-one single.<ref name="BillboardChart">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=usher|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History – Usher|work=Billboard|access-date=November 22, 2008}}</ref> In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

"[[OMG (Usher song)|OMG]]", which features [[will.i.am]], is the third official US single and the first international single. The song received mixed reviews, complimenting the song's dance and club vibe but criticizing the [[Auto-Tune]] effect. It reached number-one in Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. The song became his ninth number one in the United States, making him the first 2010s artist to collect number one singles in three consecutive decades, and only the fourth artist of all-time to achieve the feat.

{{quote box
 |quote = Usher is an old-school showman who has been performing since childhood: a dancer, a singer, five feet and seven inches of raw charm and taut musculature. I've seen superstars perform before, but always in large venues, where they are isolated from the plebes by an appropriate distance. Seeing Usher in such a small venue, beaming ear-to-ear the whole evening, I was bowled over by the sheer amount of raw talent and charisma on display.

==Personal life==
[[File:Rozonda Thomas.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli]] on stage]]
In 2001, Usher began dating [[TLC (group)|TLC]] member [[Rozonda Thomas|Chilli Thomas]], and their relationship lasted for two years. In 2003, Usher started working on the album that would become ''Confessions'', which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were not inspired by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/5944807/usher-s-confessions-at-10-an-oral-history-with-lil-jon-jermaine-dupri-more|title=Usher's 'Confessions' at 10: An Oral History with Lil Jon, Jermaine Dupri & More|work=Billboard|access-date=September 25, 2017}}</ref> Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about Usher, and arouse fans' curiosity about how much of the infidelity story was Usher's own confession.<ref name=":1" /> The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas's suspicions about Usher.<ref name=":1" /> They broke up in December 2003.

This was followed by a media frenzy surrounding the personal nature of ''[[Confessions (Usher album)|Confessions]]''. Many fans believed that the infidelity portrayed in "Confessions" was real, and the real reason for the split.<ref name="ReidKing" /> In February 2004, in an interview on ''The Bert Show'' on the [[Atlanta]] radio channel [[WWWQ|Q100]], Thomas was perceived as insinuating that Usher cheated on her: "Usher did the ultimate no-no to me. ... I will never be with him again, and that is that".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,627673,00.html|title=TLC's Chilli Dishes on Ex-Beau Usher|last=Peterson|first=Todd|date=February 20, 2004|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=December 23, 2008}}</ref>  Usher defended: "... it just didn't work out.
