'''Senses Fail''' is an American [[post-hardcore]] band that formed in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]], United States, in 2001. Formed by vocalist James "Buddy" Nielsen, drummer Dan Trapp, guitarists Garrett Zablocki and Dave Miller, and bassist James Gill (replaced by [[Mike Glita]] shortly after); the band has seen many lineup changes, with Nielsen being the only consistent member.

The lineup currently consists of Nielsen, bassist/guitarist Gavin Caswell and drummer Steve Carey, together with bassist Greg Styliades and guitarist Jason Milbank.

The band has released seven studio albums, ''[[Let It Enfold You]]'', ''[[Still Searching]]'', ''[[Life Is Not a Waiting Room]]'', ''[[The Fire (Senses Fail album)|The Fire]]'', ''[[Renacer (Senses Fail album)|Renacer]]'', ''[[Pull the Thorns from Your Heart]]''  and ''[[If There Is Light, It Will Find You]]''. In addition, the band has two [[extended play|EP]]s, ''[[From the Depths of Dreams]]'' and ''[[In Your Absence]]'' and one live album, “[[Joshua Tree (Live)]]”.

==History==

===Formation and ''From the Depths of Dreams'' EP (2001–2003)===
Senses Fail's beginnings started in October 2001 after Nielsen posted an advertisement on the Internet to recruit members for the band.<ref name="bandbio"/> The advertisement attracted attention from Garrett Zablocki, who then began writing with Nielsen. Later Zablocki contacted Dave Miller to join the band who also brought along his friend, James Gill. After a short time with another drummer the band came across Dan Trapp, who was only 14-years-old at the time. Before the band signed to Drive-Thru Records, James Gill was kicked out of the band due to irreconcilable differences; he was replaced by former [[Tokyo Rose (band)|Tokyo Rose]] drummer [[Mike Glita]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mindviz.com/sensesfail |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-09-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121203063353/http://mindviz.com/sensesfail |archive-date=December 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67781/fanboys-and-fangirls-of-drive-thru-records-posse|title=Fanboys and fangirls of Drive-Thru Records' posse|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/dukechronicleprintarchives/docs/the_chronicle_2003-09-18_sm|title=September 18, 2003|website=Issuu.com}}</ref>

Nielsen explained the band name, stating: "In Hinduism, they believe that being alive is hell, and the only way to reach Nirvana is to ultimately have no attachments to anything. So, people go out and live in the middle of the woods and they don't eat and don't drink. They just meditate because they've reached such a high level where they're not attached to love, relationships or anything. And if you want to reach the highest level of being and see God, you have to have all your senses fail."<ref name="bandbio">[http://www.sensesfail.com/xx0506/bandbio.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526065716/http://www.sensesfail.com/xx0506/bandbio.php |date=May 26, 2007 }}</ref>

Building a local fan base by playing any gig they could find from skate parks and clubs to churches,<ref name="vagrant">[http://www.vagrant.com/artist/index/24 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019225707/http://www.vagrant.com/artist/index/24 |date=October 19, 2006 }}</ref> they soon entered the studio and started to record. Their first release, ''[[From the Depths of Dreams]]'', was a six-track [[Extended play|EP]] that was originally released on [[ECA Records]] on August 16, 2002. It originally started as two three-song demo CDs, but was later joined together to make one release by producer John Naclerio. The independent release did very well and caught the attention of some record labels. They signed to [[Drive-Thru Records]], and reissued their EP on April 29, 2003 with two extra tracks, remastering, and new cover art. The b-side "Bastard Son" was also recorded during this time. The release saw much success, and sold enough copies to peak at No.&nbsp;144 on the Billboard chart.<ref name="Allmusic">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p558606|pure_url=yes}} Senses Fail Charting on Allmusic] Retrieved on May 22, 2008</ref> In support of the EP, Senses Fail toured with such bands as  [[The Used]], [[Millencolin]], [[The Starting Line]], and Drive-Thru labelmates [[Finch (US band)|Finch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ndsmcobserver.com/2003/10/drive-thru-records-artists-impress-crowd/|title=Drive-Thru Records artists impress crowd // The Observer|date=October 13, 2003|website=Ndsmcobserver.com}}</ref>

===''Let It Enfold You'' (2004–2005)===
Senses Fail started working on their debut album, ''[[Let It Enfold You]]'' in April 2003. During this time, lead singer and songwriter Buddy Nielsen was 18–19 years old.<ref name="vagrant"/> They worked with producer [[Steve Evetts]] ([[Saves the Day]], [[A Static Lullaby]], [[Every Time I Die]]) on their new label [[Vagrant Records]]. The lyrics were derived from a wide variety of sources. The title of the album was taken from a poem written by [[Charles Bukowski]], the song "Irony of Dying on Your Birthday" is about the work of mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], and parts of the song "Slow Dance" include lines of the [[Dao De Jing]].<ref name="absolute"/> Nielsen stated that, "We just love making music and writing good songs. I feel like I've got a lot more to say and we've got a lot more to contribute. But even if things ended tomorrow, we've gotten 10 times further than we ever expected to get and that makes us feel like we've succeeded regardless of what happens from here on." ''Let It Enfold You'' was released on September 7, 2004 on Vagrant and Drive Thru Records.<ref name="allbio">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p558606|pure_url=yes}} Senses Fail Biotesla was hegraphy on Allmusic] Retrieved on May 22, 2008</ref> The album was certified gold by the RIAA, and has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downloadpunk.com/?webaction=CreatorDetail&creatorid=344 |title=Hopeless Records |publisher=Downloadpunk.com |access-date=2015-08-02}}</ref>

''Let It Enfold You'' saw the release of two singles: "Buried a Lie" and "Rum Is for Drinking, Not for Burning." The music video for "Buried a Lie" was filmed on the set of the soap opera ''[[Guiding Light]]''. Nielsen's mother, who shot the video, used to act in the show.<ref name="vagrant"/> The release of the video started attracting mainstream success for the band. During this period, Senses Fail were featured in magazines such as ''Kerrang!,'' ''Rolling Stone,'' ''Spin'' and appeared on the cover of ''Alternative Press.''<ref name="vagrant"/>

The band toured extensively in support of the release. They were added to [[Warped Tour]] in 2004, 2005, and 2006, and 2009,<ref name="vagrant"/> and played on the main stage for the 2005 and 2006 editions of the tour. They were also included on the first [[Taste of Chaos]] tour in 2005 with such notable acts as [[The Used]], [[My Chemical Romance]], and [[Killswitch Engage]]. They also headlined a few tours of their own during this time with [[The Early November]] from Drive Thru and [[Emanuel (band)|Emanuel]] from Vagrant.

The album was [[reissue]]d in November 2005 with bonus tracks and new album art. In addition to the original track listing, it featured acoustic versions of songs from the album, an unreleased track, and a cover of the [[Suicidal Tendencies]] song "Institutionalized."

In 2005, the band's web site announced the departure, by mutual agreement, of guitarist Dave Miller. He was replaced by [[Heath Saraceno]], previously the guitarist and vocalist of the band [[Midtown (band)|Midtown]]. Miller started his own record label called DMI (Dave Miller Industries) in September 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Melissa Johnson |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=171142 |title=Dave Miller Starts New Label - News Article |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |date=2006-10-10 |access-date=2015-08-02}}</ref>

===''Still Searching'' (2006–2007)===
[[file:Buddy Nielsen and Dan Trapp (5996298288).jpg|thumb|Senses Fail in 2011]]
After taking a break from touring, and acquiring a new lineup, Senses Fail began to write their second studio album. The new album, titled ''[[Still Searching]]'' was produced by [[Brian McTernan]] ([[Thrice]], [[Cave In]]) and mixed by [[Chris Lord-Alge]]. This album eased up on the aggression on previous albums and showed more emotion. On the subject of the new songs, Nielsen explained, "I like my lyrics to be open to interpretation, but I didn’t want to paint pictures of things no one was going to understand; I want our fans to be able to relate. At some point, we all start examining our lives. If you don’t, there’s something wrong with you."<ref name="vagrant"/>

In support of the new album, the band toured on the Taste of Chaos again. In 2006 they toured with the Taste of Chaos International, and in 2007 Senses Fail returned to North America for the 2007 Taste of Chaos tour. In the summer of 2007 they also participated in a few dates of the [[Zumiez]] Couch Tour alongside [[From Autumn to Ashes]]. They headlined in late 2006 with [[Saosin]] and [[Bleeding Through]] as supporters.<ref name="allbio"/> On October 5, 2007, Senses Fail began a 33-city co-headlining tour with [[New Found Glory]] which started in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Also on the tour was [[Set Your Goals (band)|Set Your Goals]]. The tour ended on November 24, 2007 in [[San Diego]], [[California]].
