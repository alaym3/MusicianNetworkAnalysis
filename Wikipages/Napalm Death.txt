'''Napalm Death''' <!-- Please do not change this to "is". -->are<!-- This article is written in British-English, which treats collective nouns as plurals. (i.e. Napalm Death ARE a band.) --> an English [[grindcore]] band formed in [[Meriden, West Midlands]] in 1981.<ref>For the evolution of the death metal and grindcore extreme musical genres, see, Mudrian, A., 2004, [[Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal & Grindcore]], Feral House, Los Angeles.</ref> While none of its original members remain in the group since December 1986, the lineup of vocalist [[Barney Greenway|Mark "Barney" Greenway]], bassist [[Shane Embury]], guitarist [[Mitch Harris]] and drummer Danny Herrera has remained consistent of the band's career since 1992's ''[[Utopia Banished]]'', although, from 1989 to 2004, Napalm Death were a five-piece band after they added [[Jesse Pintado]] as the replacement of one-time guitarist [[Bill Steer]]; following Pintado's departure, the band reverted to a four-piece rather than replace him.

The band is credited as pioneers of the [[grindcore]] genre by incorporating elements of [[crust punk]] and [[death metal]], using a noise-filled sound that uses heavily [[Distortion (music)|distorted]], [[Dropped tuning|down-tuned guitars]], grinding [[Fuzz bass|overdrive bass]], high-speed [[tempo]], [[blast beat]]s, vocals which consist of incomprehensible [[Death growl|growls]] or high-pitched shrieks, extremely short songs and sociopolitical lyrics. The band's debut album ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]'', released in 1987 by [[Earache Records]], proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4990/biography|pure_url=yes}} Napalm Death] at Allmusic</ref> According to the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', their song "[[You Suffer]]" is the shortest song ever recorded, at only 1.316 seconds long.

Napalm Death have released sixteen studio albums, and are listed by [[Nielsen SoundScan]] as the seventh-best-selling death metal band in the United States.<ref name="soundscan2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=16769|title=It's Official: CANNIBAL CORPSE Are The Top-Selling Death Metal Band of the SoundScan Era|date=17 November 2003|publisher=blabbermouth.net|access-date=3 May 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031202023121/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=16769|archive-date=2 December 2003}}</ref>

==History==

===Early history (1981–1986)===

Napalm Death were formed in the village of [[Meriden, West Midlands|Meriden]] near [[Coventry]], in the United Kingdom, in May 1981 by [[Nicholas Bullen|Nic Bullen]] and Miles Ratledge while the duo were still in their early teenage years. The duo had been playing in amateur bands since 1980 as an extension of their fanzine writing, and went through a number of names (including "Civil Defence", "The Mess", "Evasion", "Undead Hatred" and "Sonic Noise") before choosing Napalm Death in mid 1981. The band were initially inspired by the early wave of punk bands, particularly the [[anarcho-punk]] movement (a subgenre of [[punk rock|punk]] music focused on [[anarchist]] politics), and associated groups such as [[Crass]].

The first stable line-up of the group consisted of Nicholas Bullen on lead vocals and bass, Simon Oppenheimer on guitars, and Miles Ratledge on drums, and lasted from December 1981 to January 1982. Graham Robertson joined on bass in January 1982. Simon Oppenheimer left the group in August 1982 and was replaced by Darryl Fedeski who left the group in October 1982: at this point, Graham Robertson began to play guitar and Finbarr Quinn (ex-Curfew) joined on bass and backing vocals.
The group played concerts throughout 1982 (playing their first concert on 25 July 1982 at Atherstone Miners Club) and 1983 (sharing billing with anarcho-punk groups such as [[Amebix]], [[The Apostles (band)|The Apostles]] and [[Antisect]]), and made 4 demo recordings in 1982 and 1983, one of which contributed their first released recording to the ''[[Bullshit Detector]] Volume 3'' compilation released by [[Crass Records]] in 1984.
[[File:Napalm HatredSurge.jpg|thumb|right|Cover for the ''Hatred Surge'' demo recording from 1985; from left-right: Justin Broadrick, Nicholas Bullen, Mick Harris]]
The band entered a period of hiatus from the end of 1983 onwards, playing only one concert in 1984 (a benefit for striking mine workers) with additional vocalist Marian Williams (ex-Relevant POS, and sister of the drummer of the group Human Cabbages from Coventry, UK).  During this period, Nic Bullen met [[Justin Broadrick]], a guitarist from Birmingham with whom he shared an interest in the music of bands such as [[Killing Joke]], [[Throbbing Gristle]], Crass, Amebix, [[Swans (band)|Swans]], and the developing [[Power electronics (music)|power electronics]] scene. Bullen joined Broadrick's [[Final (band)|Final]] project for a period in 1983.

In July 1985, Napalm Death briefly reformed in order to appear at a concert at the Mermaid in Birmingham which was also notable as the last concert by Final. The group consisted of a 4-piece line-up of Miles Ratledge - drums, Bullen - vocals, bass and guitar, Graham Robertson - guitar and bass, and Damien Errington - guitar. After this concert, Miles Ratledge and Bullen asked Broadrick to join Napalm Death as guitarist, with Bullen as vocalist and bass player. The band began to develop a musical style which blended elements of [[post-punk]] (particularly Killing Joke and Amebix), heavy hardcore punk in the vein of [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], and [[thrash metal]] (with particular reference to [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] and extreme metal group [[Celtic Frost]]).

The group played their first concert as a trio on 31 August 1985 (playing 2 concerts on the same day: Telford with [[Chumbawamba]] and [[Blyth Power]], and Birmingham with [[We've Got a Fuzzbox and We're Gonna Use It]]), and began to play regularly in the Birmingham area (particularly at The Mermaid public house in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham) with a wide range of musicians including [[Icons of Filth]], [[Concrete Sox]], [[The Varukers]], Indecent Assault, Decadence Within, and [[The Groundhogs]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In September 1985, Peter Shaw (ex-Autism) joined on bass. The 4-piece line-up recorded ''Hatred Surge'' (the band's 5th demo recording) on 23 October 1985 which the band made available at their concerts and by mail. Following the recording of the demo, Bullen and Broadrick wished to extend their exploration of a more extreme musical style which created a split in the group with Ratledge: as a result, the group splintered and [[Mick Harris]] (a local fan) was asked to join as drummer in December 1985.

The trio – Bullen on vocals and bass, Broadrick on guitar and Harris on drums – made their first performance on 15 December 1985 and went on to play many concerts in 1986, predominantly in the Birmingham area, with musicians such as Amebix, Antisect, Chaos UK, Varukers, [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]] and Dirge.
The group recorded a 6th demo, ''From Enslavement to Obliteration'', on 15 March 1986, which the group made available at their concerts and through mail, before making a 7th recording later that year, ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]'', which was provisionally intended to form part of a split LP with the English hardcore band Atavistic on Manic Ears Records. This recording later became the first side of the band's debut album ''Scum'' in 1987.

[[File:Napalm Death - 2017215223133 2017-08-03 Wacken - Sven - 1D X MK II - 1438 - AK8I9104.jpg|thumb|Embury in 2017]]
The band then faced a number of line-up changes. Nic Bullen was becoming frustrated with the musical direction of the group, and began to lose interest as a whole: as a result, Jim Whiteley was asked to join as bass player. The band played a number of concerts as a four-piece before Justin Broadrick left the group to play the drums for local band [[Head of David]]. The group attempted to find a new guitarist by asking [[Shane Embury]] (ex-Unseen Terror and a fan of the group) to join and giving a trial period to [[Frank Healy]] (ex-Annihilator, later of [[Cerebral Fix]] and [[Sacrilege (band)|Sacrilege]]). After Broadrick's departure, Nic Bullen's dissatisfaction with the musical direction of the group led him to leave the group in December 1986 (in order to focus on his studies in English Literature and Philosophy at university), leaving the group without any of its original members.

===''Scum'' and ''From Enslavement to Obliteration'' (1987–1989)===

}}
With the departure of Broadrick and Bullen, the band had to look for new members. Guitarist [[Bill Steer]] played in a band based in Liverpool called [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], and given the affinity between the bands, he joined Napalm Death while still playing an active role in Carcass.  The band asked a friend, Coventrian ([[Lee Dorrian]]), to join as vocalist due to his good relationship with the band (he had organised a number of concerts for the band), even though he had never been in a band before. This line-up recorded the B side of the ''Scum'' LP at Rich Bitch studios in May 1987, and the album was released through Earache Records.

The band promptly lost another member just after they undertook a short tour after the release of ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]''. Jim Whiteley left the group (and subsequently joined Weston-Super-Mare based band Ripcord with whom the aforementioned tour had been shared) and [[Shane Embury]] (former drummer of [[Unseen Terror]]) moved to bass.
The band then appeared on two compilation records ('North Atlantic Noise Attack' and the 'Pathological Compilation'), recorded two [[John Peel|Peel]] sessions and a split 7" with [[Japan]]ese band [[S.O.B. (band)|S.O.B.]] They also returned to Rich Bitch studio once more and recorded their second album: ''[[From Enslavement to Obliteration]]''.

A follow-up release to "Enslavement..." came in the form of the six song 12" EP "[[Mentally Murdered]]", which was to be the last recording with the Harris/Steer/Dorrian/Embury line-up. This EP was recorded at the Slaughterhouse Studios and took on a slightly different sound, blending [[grindcore]] with [[death metal]]. Following the release, Napalm Death were featured on national television in the United Kingdom in a heavy metal special by Arena (BBC 2).

[[File:Napalm Death - 2017215223704 2017-08-03 Wacken - Sven - 1D X MK II - 1508 - AK8I9174.jpg|thumb|Barney Greenway in 2017]]
The band continued to tour, but as soon as they came back home from [[Japan]], in July 1989, Steer and Dorrian left the band: Steer decided to dedicate himself full-time to Carcass, while Dorrian formed the [[doom metal]] group [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]]. The group recruited [[Jesse Pintado]] (ex-[[Terrorizer]]) on guitar and [[Barney Greenway|Mark "Barney" Greenway]] (ex-[[Benediction (band)|Benediction]]) as vocalist. This line-up took part in the Grindcrusher tour organised by Earache Records and featuring fellow label-mates Carcass, [[Bolt Thrower]] and [[Morbid Angel]]. The group recruited [[Mitch Harris]] (ex-Righteous Pigs) as second guitarist after the tour.

===Rise to success (1990–1994)===
In Florida, the group began work on ''[[Harmony Corruption]]''. ''Corruption'' saw stylistic changes from the band, exhibiting [[blast beat]]s and slower tempos. Death metal was a greater influence on ''Corruption'' than previous records. Following the record's release, ''[[Live Corruption]]'', a live recording of the band's 30 June 1990 performance at the Salisbury Arts Centre, was released in 1992.

Negative fan reactions to ''Corruption'' and accusations of selling out, compelled the band to reconsider its stylistic changes. The group entered Eddie Van Dale's Violent Noise Experience Club in March 1991 to record six new tracks. The songs produced by this session and released on the "[[Mass Appeal Madness]]" 12" LP exhibited a much more "raw" quality, again finding favour with fans. This recording, along with the "[[Mentally Murdered]]" 12", the split 7" with S.O.B. and live tracks from ''Live Corruption'', were released on ''[[Death by Manipulation]]''.

[[File:Hellfest2018NapalmDeath 05.jpg|thumb|Herrera in 2018]]
Drummer Mick Harris - the only remaining member of the ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]'' lineup - eventually left Napalm Death due to conflicts with the rest of the group over changes in its stylistic direction. Danny Herrera, a close friend of Jesse Pintado, was brought in as the new drummer. Herrera's drumming style has been noted for its uniqueness; being described as "Euroblast", a variant of [[blast beat]] in which simultaneous eighth notes are played on the ride cymbal and kick drum, with alternate eighth notes added on the snare drum.<ref>Phillipov, Michelle (2012) ''Death Metal and Music Criticism: Analysis at the Limits'', Lexington Books, {{ISBN|978-0739164594}}, p. 86</ref> The addition of Herrera would be the last major line-up change of the band, save for Jesse Pintado's future absence, which has yet to be filled (and vocalist Phil Vane never recorded with the band).

Napalm Death released the album ''[[Utopia Banished]]'' in 1992, produced by [[Colin Richardson]]. This release was a kind of "return to the roots" - grindcore. After recording ''[[Utopia Banished|The World Keeps Turning]]'' EP, the band toured Europe with [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]] and [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]] on the "Campaign for Musical Destruction" tour.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Extreme Metal II|last=McIver|first=Joel|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1844490974}}</ref> They then toured the US with [[Sepultura]], [[Sacred Reich]] and [[Sick of It All]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes (1999), page 103.</ref> The proceeds of Napalm Death's 1993 EP ''[[Nazi Punks Fuck Off (Napalm Death)|Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'' were donated to anti-fascist organisations.

Their EP, ''Nazi Punks Fuck Off'', was inspired by Napalm Death touring South Africa during 1993, which was particularly controversial given that the band faced a lot of opposition from many [[White supremacism|white supremacists]] following the [[end of Apartheid]].<ref name="youtube1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3wuoBsOMW0|title=Napalm Death's Barney Greenway - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

The band remixed the track "Mind of a Razor" by London-based [[hip hop]] crew [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]]. The remixed version of the track appeared on the [[Extended play|EP]] of the same name in 1992.

Thereafter, they went to the studio and recorded ''[[Fear, Emptiness, Despair]]'', which was released on 31 May 1994. The album represented a stylistic transition for Napalm Death.<ref name="decibelmagazine1">{{cite web|url= http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/featured/decibrity-playlist-shane-embury-napalm-death|title= Decibrity Playlist: Shane Embury (Napalm Death)|date= 23 February 2012|website=Decibelmagazine.com|access-date= 24 June 2017}}</ref> ''Fear, Emptiness, Despair'' maintained the complex music structures of their previous albums ''[[Utopia Banished]]'' and ''[[Harmony Corruption]]'',<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r204477|pure_url=yes}}|title= ((( Fear Emptiness Despair > Overview )))|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date= 13 October 2008}}</ref> but there was a greater emphasis placed on incorporating elements of groove into the band's style, resulting in a wider use of mid-paced music.<ref>Mudrian, Albert (2004).

===''Diatribes'', Greenway's departure and return (1995–1999)===
[[File:Napalm Death 08.jpg|thumb|upright|Mitch Harris in 2009]]
Their EP ''[[Greed Killing]]'' was released through Earache in December 1995, followed by the album ''[[Diatribes (album)|Diatribes]]'' in January 1996. There was greater animosity between the band during this time, with a rift between Greenway and the remainder of the band, especially over the band's stylistic transition and the interference of background presences in the band, exemplifying the former when he stated that the band were "letting go of what made the band special".<ref name="youtube1"/> Greenway was hence expelled from the band later in 1996, and went to record with fellow grindcore act [[Extreme Noise Terror]] (ENT) on their release ''[[Damage 381]]''. Greenway has stated that following his expulsion he was "devastated" and did not want to commit to ENT in fear of a repetition of the events that took place within Napalm Death.<ref name="youtube1"/>

ENT's vocalist Phil Vane replaced Greenway in Napalm Death. Alas, Shane Embury stated that Vane "couldn't pull off what was required. It was a hard day when I had to pull Phil aside and tell him it just wasn't working. We had been too much into doing our own thing to acknowledge all of the parts that made the Napalm machine tick. I quickly made the call and asked Barney if he would rejoin—time away certainly gave all of us the chance for reflection, regrets and hopes for the future. He was surprised by the material, as it was heavy and some of the songs were fast—I don't know what he really expected us to do!".<ref name="decibelmagazine2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2017/12/13/rank-defile-shane-embury-orders-napalm-deaths-albums-worst-best/|title=Rank and Defile: Shane Embury Orders Napalm Death's Albums from Worst to Best|date=13 December 2017|website=Decibelmagazine.com}}</ref> Following Vane's departure, Greenway returned and the band released the album ''[[Inside the Torn Apart]]'' on 3 June 1997. An [[Breed to Breathe|EP]] and music video were released for the album's track "Breed to Breathe" on 17 November 1997.

The album ''[[Words from the Exit Wound]]'' followed this, being released on 26 October 1998. The album was their last to be produced by [[Colin Richardson]], who Embury believes hindered the album's creation, ultimately affecting the album's success.<ref name="decibelmagazine2"/> Embury has stated that bands such as [[Nasum (band)|Nasum]] influenced the album, and in Embury's view, this album represented a turning point in the band's sound, stating "it was also a turning point in us moving towards rediscovering our roots."<ref name="decibelmagazine2"/> Embury also mentioned that following the album's release, the band found it hard to tour due to restricted budgets from their record label, but [[Cradle of Filth]] and [[Nick Barker]] were able to alleviate this problem.<ref name="decibelmagazine2"/>

In 1999 the band made an appearance on [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans']] [[TFI Friday]], playing three songs on a set lasting 59 seconds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/12/tfi-fridays-best-performances-manics-garbage-page-and-plant-shaun-ryder-slipknot|title=TFI Friday's best performances: Manics, Garbage, Page and Plant and more|first=Marc|last=Burrows|date=12 June 2015|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>

===Departure from Earache and the departure of Pintado (2000–2004)===
The band acrimoniously departed from Earache Records following ''[[Words from the Exit Wound]]'' and later released ''[[Enemy of the Music Business]]'' on the record label, Dream Catcher, on 25 September 2000; which showed the band's anger with the music industry and especially with Earache, whilst also incorporating a greater grindcore influence than on their previous few albums. The album was produced jointly by [[Simon Efemey]] and [[Russ Russell]], the latter of whom has since been a long-time collaborator with Napalm Death.

''[[Order of the Leech]]'' continued with the previous album's style, being released on 21 October 2002, also being produced jointly by Efemey and Russell. In 2003, Embury and Hererra formed the side-project [[Venomous Concept]] with Kevin Sharp and [[Buzz Osborne]], and that group has since released four albums.<ref>Aswad, Jem & Christie, Ian "[http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=napalm_death Napalm Death]", ''[[Trouser Press]]''.

Retrieved 21 March 2018</ref> In 2004, Napalm Death recorded a covers album called ''[[Leaders Not Followers: Part 2]]'', the sequel to their earlier covers EP. It contains covers of old [[hardcore punk]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, including [[Cryptic Slaughter]], [[Massacre (metal band)|Massacre]], [[Kreator]], [[Sepultura]], [[Siege (band)|Siege]] and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]. Due to personal problems, [[Jesse Pintado]] did not play on either ''Order of the Leech'' or ''Leaders Not Followers: Part 2'', and left the band in early 2004. Nevertheless, Pintado stated that he left because he grew tired of Napalm Death and wanted to start something new. The two guitars that you hear is Mitch double-tracking.

===''The Code Is Red...'' and ''Time Waits for No Slave'' (2005–2010)===

[[File:Nd1.jpg|thumb|300px|Live in 2007]]
In April 2005, their next album ''[[The Code Is Red...Long Live the Code]]'' was released. It features guest appearances from [[Jeff Walker (musician)|Jeffrey Walker]] ([[Carcass (band)|Carcass]]), [[Jamey Jasta]] ([[Hatebreed]] vocalist) and [[Jello Biafra]] (formerly of [[Dead Kennedys]], and [[Lard (band)|Lard]] among many other bands). The album continued the band's progressive approach to their brutal brand of extreme metal, with their trademark grindcore sound retained. Also in 2005, Embury and Herrera joined the extreme metal band [[Anaal Nathrakh]] for one tour.

Napalm Death finished recording their follow-up album titled ''[[Smear Campaign (album)|Smear Campaign]]'' in June 2006, and it was released on 15 September 2006 to strong reviews from fans and critics alike. The main lyrical focus is criticism of the [[United States Government]] and other governments who are strongly religious. The album features a guest appearance by [[Anneke van Giersbergen]], vocalist for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] rock band [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]]. There is a limited edition [[digipak]] version of ''Smear Campaign'', which has two new songs, "Call That an Option?" and "Atheist Runt". They played a series of headline shows in support of the release including the Koko in Camden with [[Gutworm]]. <!-- need more stuff on newer albums -->

In early 2006 Napalm Death headlined a tour with [[Kreator]], [[A Perfect Murder (band)|A Perfect Murder]], and Undying. On 27 August 2006, [[Jesse Pintado]] died in a hospital in the [[Netherlands]] due to [[liver failure]], prompting Mitch Harris to express his sadness at the loss of someone he thought of as "a brother" on the band's official website. After the Smear Campaign tour, the band did a 2007 "World Domination Tour". Bassist [[Shane Embury]] is currently working on a project with [[Mick Kenney]] of [[Anaal Nathrakh]], their work together will be released on FETO Records at the end of 2007. In November 2008, Napalm Death's fourteenth studio album, entitled ''[[Time Waits for No Slave]]'', leaked onto the internet; it was officially released on 23 January 2009.  Similar to ''Smear Campaign'', ''Time Waits For No Slave'' also had a digipak version containing two extra songs ("Suppressed Hunger" and "Omnipresent Knife in Your Back").

===''Utilitarian'' and ''Apex Predator – Easy Meat'' (2011–2016)===

In February 2011, Napalm Death appeared in an episode of E4's ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]''. Napalm Death entered Parlour Studio in Kettering, with producer [[Russ Russell]] to begin working on a new album. Also in 2011, they recorded the single "Legacy Was Yesterday".

=== ''Skins'' ===
<blockquote>In the E4 teen comedy-drama [[Skins (British TV series)|Skins]], the seasons 5-6  character Rich Hardbeck ([[Alexander Arnold (actor)|Alex Arnold]]) is a metalhead whose self-proclaimed favourite band is Napalm Death. In the show's fifth season finale, a special appearance from Napalm Death's Mark "Barney" Greenway featured a scene in which he and Rich have a heart-to-heart. Regarding the band's appearance, Barney stated, "One thing that bothers me about TV is the way that teenagers are portrayed. It's down to the f--king Daily Mail's war on teenagers. They stigmatize young kids and it's bulls--t. The thing I like about '''<nowiki/>'<nowiki/>'''Skins' is it gives a genuine perspective on growing up. That's why we agreed to do this show."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=2011-02-02|title=Napalm Death Featured In British TV Show 'Skins'|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/napalm-death-featured-in-british-tv-show-skins/|access-date=2021-01-18|website=Blabbermouth.net}}</ref></blockquote>
