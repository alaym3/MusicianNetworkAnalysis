=== Influences ===
One of the most significant influential figures in Michele's life is [[Barbra Streisand]] whom she cites as her "role model". Her mother Edith would play her films when she was a child.<ref name="Brunette Ambition" /> Michele dedicated a chapter in her book ''Brunette Ambition'' to Streisand, noting that it is important for people to have someone to look up to. Michele wrote, "I really love her, she's always been such a role model to me. She's someone who has built her career on focusing on what makes her unique and what makes her special."<ref>{{cite web |title = VIDEO: Lea Michele Talks GLEE, Streisand, Broadway & More on GMA |url = http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/VIDEO-Lea-Michele-Talks-GLEE-Streisand-Broadway-More-on-GMA-20140520 |website = Broadway World |date = May 20, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075548/http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/VIDEO-Lea-Michele-Talks-GLEE-Streisand-Broadway-More-on-GMA-20140520 |archive-date = March 4, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> An actress who influenced Michele was [[Natalie Wood]].

Actress and singer [[Audra McDonald]] has also been an influence on Michele. She told ''[[The Fresno Bee]]'', "Audra is probably the best singer in the world – up there with Barbra. I don't think she has any idea what an influence she had on me. I would say 80% of my singing knowledge came from Audra... How to warm up. How to breathe. How to take care of my voice.

===Controversy===
In June 2020, actress [[Samantha Marie Ware]] accused Michele of being very rude to her and causing "traumatic [[microaggression]]s" while they worked together on the sixth season of ''Glee''.<ref name=CNNWareMichele>{{Cite web|first=Marianne |last=Garvey|title=Lea Michele apologizes after Samantha Marie Ware accuses her of making 'Glee' a 'living hell'|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/entertainment/lea-michele-glee-samantha-marie-ware/index.html|access-date=June 5, 2020|website=[[CNN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603150252/https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/entertainment/lea-michele-glee-samantha-marie-ware/index.html|archive-date=June 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Ware made her comments in direct response to Michele having posted a message on social media saying "[[George Floyd]] did not deserve this.
