'''Amon Amarth''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|ɒ|n|_|ə|ˈ|m|ɑːr|θ}}) is a Swedish [[melodic death metal]] band from [[Tumba, Sweden|Tumba]], formed in 1992. The band takes its name from the [[Sindarin]] name of [[Mount Doom]], a volcano in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]′s [[Middle-earth]]. Their lyrics mostly deal with [[Viking mythology]] and history, and so they have been sometimes erroneously labeled “[[Viking metal]],” although the band insists they play melodic death metal.  

The band is composed of lead guitarist Olavi Mikkonen, vocalist Johan Hegg, bassist Ted Lundström, rhythm guitarist Johan Söderberg, and drummer Jocke Wallgren. Amon Amarth has released eleven [[studio album]]s, one [[compilation album]], one [[Extended play|EP]], one [[video album]], and ten [[music video]]s. Their first studio album, ''[[Once Sent from the Golden Hall]]'', debuted in 1998. Five more studio releases followed, before the band saw its breakthrough with the 2008 album ''[[Twilight of the Thunder God]]'', which debuted at No. 10 on the Swedish album charts and No. 50 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Four more albums, ''[[Surtur Rising]]'', ''[[Deceiver of the Gods]]'', ''[[Jomsviking (album)|Jomsviking]]'', and ''[[Berserker (Amon Amarth album)|Berserker]]'' followed in 2011, 2013, 2016, and 2019 respectively.

==History==
[[File:20170816 Dinkelsbühl Summer Breeze Amon Amarth 0073.jpg|thumb|Johan Hegg in 2017]]

===Formation (1988–1991)===
The band emerged from the previous [[death metal]] band '''Scum''', founded in 1988 by Paul "Themgoroth" Mäkitalo ([[Dark Funeral]]) on [[Death growl|vocals]], Olavi Mikkonen on [[lead guitar]], Petri Tarvainen on [[bass guitar|bass]] and Vesa Meriläinen [[rhythm guitar]].

===Early recordings (1992–1997)===
After a 1991 demo, Scum broke up  and Amon Amarth formed in 1992. Hegg replaced Mäkitalo on vocals, Anders Hansson joined on guitar, and [[Ted Lundström]] replaced Tarvainen on bass, before recording its first demo ''Thor Arise'' (1993). Raw and uneven in sound and execution, it was never officially released due to low quality standards,<ref name="FOUND">{{cite web|url=http://www.amonamarth.com/band/biography/|title=Biography at amonamarth.com|access-date=27 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424112720/http://www.amonamarth.com/band/biography/|archive-date=24 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amon-amarth-p289565 |title=Amon Amarth &#124; Biography, Albums, & Streaming Radio |website=AllMusic |access-date=11 October 2015}}</ref> but the band caught the attention of extreme metal fans with its own "infectious brand of epic-sounding brutality and unadorned conviction".<ref name="FOUND"/> In 1994 another demo entitled ''The Arrival of the Fimbul Winter'' was recorded; this time 1,000 copies were indeed issued.

In 1996, they signed with Pulverised Records, on which they released their first [[Mini CD|MCD]], ''[[Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds]]'', which sold 6000 copies.<ref name="Amon Amarth Biography">{{cite web| title= Amon Amarth Biography| url= http://www.amonamarth.de/en/band_biography.shtml| access-date= 14 November 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071017091836/http://amonamarth.de/en/band_biography.shtml| archive-date= 17 October 2007| url-status= dead}}</ref>

They then signed with [[Metal Blade Records]] which released the debut album ''[[Once Sent from the Golden Hall]]''. Described as "a compelling fusion of buzzsaw riff work, melodic harmonies and soul-crushing rhythms punctuated by Hegg's callous black/death roar and accounts of Norse battles and treachery" it made sure Amon Amarth's popularity rose internationally.<ref name="FOUND"/> According to [[Allmusic]], the song that bore the group's namesake was the most memorable, containing "the chaotic noises of battle, the screams of the dying, and much sword-clashing to boot."<ref name="once_allmusic"/> Since then they have performed at multiple Canada and US tours, festival appearances, eight [[music video]]s, and appearances in over 100 metal magazines.<ref name="Amon Amarth Biography" />

In June 1998, as the band was about to commence a tour alongside [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]] and [[Brutal Truth]], guitarist Anders Hansson left and was replaced by Johan Soderberg.

''[[The Crusher (album)|The Crusher]]'', released in 2001, was considered{{according to whom|date=July 2013}} to be its most aggressive album.

In Berno Studio in Malmo ''[[Versus the World (Amon Amarth album)|Versus The World]]'' was recorded and came out, The Viking Edition comprising a bonus CD which included demos ''Thor Arise'' and ''Arrival Of The Fimbul Winter''. Touring continued up until Spring 2004 when the band started working on ''[[Fate of Norns]]'' album which was released on 6 September 2004.<ref name="Amon Amarth Biography" /> The follow-up, ''[[With Oden on Our Side]]'' (2006), has shown (according to AllMusic) that "Amon Amarth continue to be champions of the worldwide death metal tournament"<ref>''Prato, Greg''.

The band bases most of its song lyrics on [[Norse mythology]], the [[Viking Age]], and the pre-[[Christianity|Christian]] world, which thematically comprise a heavy metal style known as [[Viking metal]]. Viking metal originally emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s as an ideological offshoot of [[black metal]], made popular by such bands as [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]].

In regard to the band's reputation as a Viking metal band, Imke von Helden writes in "Barbarians and Literature: Viking Metal and its Links to Old Norse Mythology" that "During the 1990s, Swedish Amon Amarth added a new dimension to the definition of viking metal by means of its death metal style of music."<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/mmp1ever1290310.pdf|title = Barbarians and Literature: Viking Metal and its Links to Old Norse Mythology|last = von Helden|first = Imke|page = 258|date = 2010|journal = Inter-Disciplinary Press|access-date = 28 October 2014|location = Oxford|editor-last = Scott|editor-first = Niall W.

When asked to comment on the band's genre, vocalist Johan Hegg remarked:{{bq|We play death metal. We write about Vikings so, therefore, some refer us to Viking metal, but I have no idea what that is. I can't imagine the Vikings were into metal at all except on the swords and stuff. And musically, I guess they only played these strange lip instruments and some bongos or whatever.|author =[http://www.themetalweb.com/amonamarthinterview.html The Metal Web's interview with Johan Hegg]}}

Hegg has also addressed the band's relationship to the [[pagan metal]] phenomenon and its choice of subject matter:{{bq|We don't really see ourselves as one of those bands doing pagan folklore music. The reason we took the Viking theme and mythology theme as a lyrical theme for the band was, perhaps, more accidental from the start. When we wrote the first song with Viking lyrics, we felt it was a topic that suited the music that we wanted to write really well...It was something different, as well, from a lot of other bands. In Sweden, I think only [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]] had done anything like it. For us, it was to do something different, to stand out a little bit, to use those lyrics.|author =[https://www.norsemyth.org/2010/08/interview-with-johan-hegg-of-amon_12.html The Norse Mythology Blog's interview with Johan Hegg]}}
