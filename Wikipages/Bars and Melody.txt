==Lawsuit==
Antonio Devries, Leondre's father, threatened to file a suit against the group in March 2016, saying that he wrote ''Hopeful'' due to troubles that he was having in his life.<ref name="YN" /> He claims that he helped promote the boys until their ''Britain's Got Talent'' contest, is unhappy that the boys are moving away from the anti-bullying theme, and claims that their management overworks them. He says that he does not have any issues with Bars and Melody,<ref name="YN" /><ref name="Metro dad" /> but he took over the boys' social media accounts and posted music from his son Joey and other artists he represents until the management team regained control of the accounts.<ref name="BP Jones">{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/exclusive-britain-s-got-talent-favourites-bars/story-28987126-detail/story.html#oCOYkLrl7wu42B5l.99 |title=Exclusive: Britain's Got Talent stars Bars and Melody sued by dad |author=Craig Jones |date=24 March 2016 |website=Bristol Post |access-date=25 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326165339/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Exclusive-Britain-s-Got-Talent-favourites-Bars/story-28987126-detail/story.html#oCOYkLrl7wu42B5l.99 |archive-date=26 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The management team, who Devries says is the root of the problem, have stated that the boys wrote "Hopeful".
