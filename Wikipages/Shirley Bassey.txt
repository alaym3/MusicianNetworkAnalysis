Born in [[Tiger Bay]], [[Cardiff]], she began performing as a teenager in 1953.

==Early life==
Shirley Veronica Bassey, the sixth and youngest child of Henry Bassey and Eliza Jane Start,<ref>{{cite book |first=John L.|last=Williams |year=2010 |title=Miss Shirley Bassey |publisher=Quercus |location=London |isbn=978-1-84724-974-6 |pages=10–11}}</ref> was born on Bute Street, [[Tiger Bay]], [[Cardiff]]. She grew up in the adjacent community of [[Splott]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Williams |first=John |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/trail-of-the-unexpected-discover-dame-shirley-basseys-former-haunts-in-cardiff-2101355.html |title=Trail of the unexpected: Discover Dame Shirley Bassey's former haunts in Cardiff |newspaper=The Independent |date=8 October 2010 |access-date=17 April 2016}}</ref> Her father was [[Nigerian]], and her mother came from [[Teesside]].<ref name=a/><ref>{{cite web |last=Eaves |first=Krysta |url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/dame-shirley-basseys-links-teesside-3689742 |title=Dame Shirley Bassey's links to Teesside revealed |website=[[Teesside Gazette|Gazette Live]] |date=25 June 2011 |access-date=25 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=afterdark>{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/~sbwebmaster/articles/generalarticles/articleafterdark1972.html |title="They can't put the two together" and Bassey is both |first=Norma McLain |last=Stoop |website=After Dark Magazine |date=January 1972 |access-date=28 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028152624/http://geocities.com/~sbwebmaster/articles/generalarticles/articleafterdark1972.html |archive-date=28 October 2009}}</ref><ref name=minute-she-walked-in-the-joint/>

Two of her mother's four children from previous relationships lived in the Bassey household. Bassey's mother listed her first husband, Alfred Metcalfe, as her own father in the registry of her marriage to Henry Bassey, giving rise to speculation that this marriage was [[bigamous]] in the absence of a prior divorce.<ref>Williams, ''Miss Shirley Bassey'', 18.</ref> Eliza and Henry's second child died in infancy, so Shirley was born into a household of three sisters, two half-sisters, and one brother.

Teachers and students alike at Moorland Road School noticed Bassey's strong voice, but gave the pre-teen little encouragement: "...everyone told me to shut up. Even in the school [[choir]] the teacher kept telling me to back off till I was singing in the corridor!" A classmate recalled her singing the refrain "[[Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man]]" from ''[[Show Boat]]'' with such feeling that she made their teacher uncomfortable.<ref>Williams, ''Miss Shirley Bassey'', 46.</ref> She left [[Splott]] [[secondary modern school]] aged 14 to work at [[Curran Steels]] and, in the evenings and weekends, to sing in local [[pub]]s and clubs.<ref>Williams, ''Miss Shirley Bassey'', 44, 53, 60.</ref>

==Career==

===1953–1959: Career beginnings===
In a 1999 interview with [[Nigel Havers]] in her [[Monte Carlo]] apartment, Bassey pointed to a piece of paper framed on the wall and referred to it as her first contract, at a salary of £14 a week (a considerable sum for a sixteen-year-old in 1953). However, upon closer inspection, this document, dated 17 December 1953 (three weeks before her 17th birthday), appears to promise £10 for two performances.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shirleybassey.wordpress.com/2016/08/19/shirley-basseys-25th-anniversary-1978/ |title=Shirley's 25th Anniversary  |website=The Bassey Blog |date=7 June 2009 |access-date=23 November 2017}}</ref> Also in 1953, Bassey signed a contract to sing in the touring variety show ''Memories of Jolson'', a musical based on the life of [[Al Jolson]].<ref>CD liner notes by Shirley Bassey, ''Thank You for the Years'' (2003)</ref> She next took up a professional engagement in ''Hot from Harlem'', which ran until 1954.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

In 1955, Bassey toured various theatres until she was noticed by the impresario [[Jack Hylton]]. He invited her to feature in [[Al Read]]'s ''Such Is Life'' at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].

During the show's run, [[Philips Records|Philips]] record producer [[Johnny Franz]] spotted her on television, was impressed, and offered her a recording deal. Bassey recorded her first single, "[[Burn My Candle]]", released in February 1956, when she was 19. Owing to the suggestive lyrics, the BBC banned it. More singles followed, and in February 1957, Bassey had her first [[hit record|hit]] with "[[The Banana Boat Song]]", which reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name=officialcharts>{{cite web |title=Shirley Bassey |website=Official Charts |access-date=10 April 2016 |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/4336/shirley-bassey/}}</ref>

In 1957 she also recorded under the direction of American producer [[Mitch Miller]] in New York City for the [[Columbia Records]] label (which at the time had a distribution deal with Philips), producing the single "If I Had a Needle and Thread" [[A-side and B-side|b/w]] "Tonight My Heart She Is Crying". She then made her American stage début in [[Las Vegas]] at [[El Rancho Vegas]].<ref>Williams, ''Miss Shirley Bassey'', 154.</ref>

In mid-1958, she recorded two singles that would become classics in the Bassey catalogue. "As I Love You" was released as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of another ballad, "Hands Across the Sea"; it did not sell well at first, but after an appearance at the [[London Palladium]] sales began to pick up. In January 1959, "As I Love You" reached [[List of number-one singles from the 1950s (UK)|number one]] and stayed there for four weeks; it was the first number-one single by a Welsh artist.<ref name="Bbc.co.uk"/>

While "As I Love You" climbed the charts, so did Bassey's recording of "[[Kiss Me, Honey Honey, Kiss Me]]" and both records would end up occupying the top 3 at the same time. A few months later, Bassey signed to [[EMI]]'s [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label, and the second phase in her recording career had begun.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

===1960–1979: Success and breakthrough===
In the early and mid-1960s, Bassey had numerous hits in the UK, and five albums in the top 15. Her 1960 recording of "[[As Long As He Needs Me]]" from [[Lionel Bart]]'s ''[[Oliver!]]'' reached number two, and had a chart run of 30 weeks.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Bassey made her American television début on 13 November 1960, when she performed on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.<ref>Williams, ''Miss Shirley Bassey'', 219.</ref> Her collaboration with [[Nelson Riddle]] and his orchestra, the album ''[[Let's Face the Music]]'' (1962), reached number 12 in the UK album chart; and the single, "[[What Now My Love (song)|What Now My Love]]" made it to number five. Other UK top 10 singles of the period included her second number-one, the double [[A-side and B-side|A-side]] "[[Reach for the Stars (Shirley Bassey song)|Reach for the Stars]]"/"[[Climb Ev'ry Mountain]]" (1961), "I'll Get By" (also 1961), and a cover version of the [[Ben E. King]] hit "[[I (Who Have Nothing)]]" in 1963.<ref name=officialcharts/> Bassey appeared on the cover of ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine in 1963, and sang at a Washington gala celebrating [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s second year in office.<ref>Williams, ''Miss Shirley Bassey'', 247–248.</ref>

Bassey made her Carnegie Hall debut on 15 February 1964. The complete concert recording was not released until it was included in the EMI compilation 'The EMU/UA Years 1959–1979' (ref: AllMusic review by Bruce Eder).

Bassey enjoyed her only US [[top 40]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] hit in 1965 with the [[Goldfinger (Shirley Bassey song)|title song]] of the James Bond film, ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''. The single, released in the United States during January 1965, peaked at number eight, while the [[Goldfinger (soundtrack)|original soundtrack]] of ''Goldfinger'' hit number one in the US that year. Also in 1965, she sang the title song for the James Bond spoof ''[[The Liquidator (1965 film)|The Liquidator]]'', and had a [[Shirley Bassey at the Pigalle|top 20 live album]], recorded during a sold-out run at the Pigalle in London.

Bassey recorded a song for the next Bond film, ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965). "[[Thunderball (film)#Music|Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]" was not used in the movie, although the film's score follows its melodic theme. Written by John Barry and Leslie Bricusse, after Bassey's version it was re-recorded by [[Dionne Warwick]], and then rejected in favour of a new song, "Thunderball," hastily written by Barry and given to [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] (who, like Bassey, is Welsh) after the film's producers decided the song over the opening credits must feature the film's title.<ref>Williams, ''Miss Shirley Bassey'', 274–275.</ref>

The "Goldfinger" theme song, however, had a lasting impact on her career. In the sleeve notes for Bassey's ''25th Anniversary Album'' (1978), [[Peter Clayton]] noted that: "Acceptance in America was considerably helped by the enormous popularity of ("Goldfinger")...But she had actually established herself there as early as 1961, in [[cabaret]] in New York. She was also a success in Las Vegas...'I suppose I should feel hurt that I've never been really big in America on record since "Goldfinger"...But, concertwise, I always sell out.'..."<ref>{{cite web |author=Roman |url=http://home.arcor.de/bassey/ |title=See sleeve notes by Peter Clayton, ''25th Anniversary Album'' |website=Arcor.de |date=6 May 2004 |access-date=28 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307101359/http://home.arcor.de/bassey/ |archive-date=7 March 2014 }}</ref> This was reflected in the fact that Bassey had only one solo LP reach the top 20 in a US chart ([[Hot R&B/Hip-hop albums|R&B]], ''Live at Carnegie Hall''), and she was technically a [[one-hit wonder]]. In the aftermath of "Goldfinger" her UK sales started to falter as well: only two of her singles would enter the UK top 40 from 1966 to 1970. She had signed to [[United Artists Records|United Artists]], and her first album on that label, ''[[I've Got a Song for You]]'' (1966), spent one week on the chart; from 1966 to 1970, only two albums would chart, one of those a compilation. One of her best-known singles, "[[Big Spender]]" was released in 1967, charting just short of the UK top 20.<ref name=officialcharts/>

Bassey began to live as a [[tax exile]] in 1968 and was unable to work in Britain for almost two years.<ref name=minute-she-walked-in-the-joint>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3594141/The-minute-she-walked-in-the-joint.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=The minute she walked in the joint |first=Nigel |last=Farndale |date=9 May 2003 |access-date=23 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Roman |url=http://home.arcor.de/bassey/ |title=See CD sleeve notes by Chris White, ''Something'' album |website=Arcor.de |date=6 May 2004 |access-date=28 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307101359/http://home.arcor.de/bassey/ |archive-date=7 March 2014 }}</ref>

In 1969, she appeared in [[NBC]]'s ''The Spring Thing,'' a musical television special hosted by [[Bobbie Gentry]] and [[Noel Harrison]]. Guests included were [[Goldie Hawn]], [[Meredith MacRae]], Irwin C. Watson, [[Rod McKuen]], and [[Harpers Bizarre]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Of0QAAAAQBAJ&q=david+winters+variety&pg=PA343|title=Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936–2012, 2d ed.|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|date=6 June 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476612409|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Shirley Bassey à Munster ( Allemagne ) début des années 70.jpeg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|Bassey performing in [[West Germany]] in 1973]]
Bassey's UK comeback came in 1970, leading to one of the most successful periods of her career. Starting the year with a BBC Television 'Special' ''[[Dougie Squires|The Young Generation]] Meet Shirley Bassey'', recorded in Sweden and shown on [[BBC1]] on 18 March.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/3a3321e9515f451283f407c6059d126d |title=The Young Generation meet Shirley Bassey – BBC One London – 18 March 1970 |website=BBC Genome |access-date=25 June 2016}}</ref> She returned to the UK with a record-breaking run of performances at the [[Talk of the Town (nightclub)|Talk of the Town]] nightclub. Also that year, her album ''[[Something (Shirley Bassey album)|Something]]'' was released, and showcased a new Bassey style, a shift from [[traditional pop]] to more contemporary songs and arrangements (the eponymous single was more successful in the UK charts than the original recording by [[The Beatles]]) – although Bassey would never completely abandon what that had been her forte: standards, [[show tunes]], and [[torch songs]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" was also a top 10 US hit on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary]] chart. Other singles of this period included the hit "[[Grande grande grande|Never Never Never]]", an English version of the Italian "Grande grande grande", reaching the top 10 in the US Adult Contemporary Chart, the UK top 10 and number one in Australia and South Africa. The success of "Something" (single number four, album number five in the UK) spawned a series of successful albums on the [[United Artists]] label, including ''[[Something Else (Shirley Bassey album)|Something Else]]'' (1971), ''[[And I Love You So (Shirley Bassey album)|And I Love You So]]'' (1972), ''[[I Capricorn]]'' (1972), ''[[Never Never Never]]'' (1973), ''[[Good, Bad but Beautiful]]'' (1975), ''[[Love, Life and Feelings]]'' (1976), ''[[You Take My Heart Away (album)|You Take My Heart Away]]'' (1977) and ''Yesterdays'' (1978). Additionally, two of Bassey's earlier LPs also entered the charts in the '70s: ''[[And We Were Lovers]]'' (1967, re-issued as ''Big Spender''), and ''[[Let's Face the Music]]'' (1962, re-issued as ''What Now My Love''). Two compilations, ''[[The Shirley Bassey Singles Album]]'' (1975) and ''[[25th Anniversary Album (Shirley Bassey album)|25th Anniversary Album]]'' (1978), both made the top three of the UK charts: ''[[The Shirley Bassey Singles Album]]'' her highest-charting album, reached number two and earned a [[British Phonographic Industry#Certifications|gold disc]], and the ''25th Anniversary Album'' eventually went platinum.<ref name=officialcharts/><ref name=BPI>{{cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |title=BPI Database (must manually enter Shirley Bassey) |website=British Phonographic Industry |access-date=10 April 2016}}</ref>

Between 1970 and 1979, Bassey had 18 hit albums in the UK Albums Chart.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Her album ''The Magic Is You'' (1979) featured a portrait by the photographer [[Francesco Scavullo]]. In 1973, her sold-out concerts at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] were recorded and released as a two-LP set, ''Shirley Bassey: Live at Carnegie Hall''. This album and the majority of her recordings from this period have been released on CD by EMI and BGO Records. Returning to the James Bond franchise, she recorded the theme song for ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (soundtrack)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971).{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Bassey was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions: in November 1972 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at [[Heathrow Airport]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} and in January 1993, when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised her at the curtain call of a sell-out concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Bassey appeared on the ''[[Morecambe and Wise]] Christmas Show'', broadcast on Christmas Day in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1181838/ |title=1971 Christmas Show|date=25 December 1971|publisher=IMDb|access-date=25 June 2016}}</ref> Bassey starred in the six-episode ''The Shirley Bassey Show'' (1976), the first of her television programmes for the BBC, followed by a second series of six episodes in 1979. The final show of the first series was nominated for the [[Golden Rose of Montreux]] in 1977. The series featured guests including [[Neil Diamond]], [[Michel Legrand]], [[The Three Degrees]] and [[Dusty Springfield]] and featured Bassey in various international locations as well as in the television studio. In 1978, Bassey pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly "after shouting abuse in the street and pushing a policeman".<ref name=GuardInt/> In 1979, Bassey recorded the title theme song for the Bond film, ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

===1980–1999: Continued success===
Throughout most of the 1980s, Bassey focused on charitable work and performing occasional concert tours throughout Europe, Australia, and the United States. She had ended her contract with United Artists, whose former record division was now part of EMI, and began what she referred to as "semi-retirement". Bassey recorded an album entitled ''[[All by Myself (Shirley Bassey album)|All by Myself]]'' (1982) and made a TV special for [[Thames Television]] called ''A Special Lady'' with guest [[Robert Goulet]]. Around this time she recorded a duet with the French film actor [[Alain Delon]], "Thought I'd Ring You" (1983). Bassey was now recording far less often but an album of her most famous songs, ''[[I Am What I Am (Shirley Bassey album)|I Am What I Am]]'' (1984), was recorded with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) conducted by [[Carl Davis]]. This was followed by a single and video to support the London Tourist Board, "[[There's No Place Like London]]" (1986), which was co-written by [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Gerard Kenny]]. She recorded an album of James Bond themes, ''[[The Bond Collection]]'' in 1987, but was apparently unhappy with the results so she declined to release it. (Five years later it was released anyway, Bassey sued in court, and all unsold copies were withdrawn.)<ref>Bassey v. Icon Entertainment plc (1995) EMLR 596.</ref>

Bassey provided vocals for Swiss artists [[Yello]] on "[[The Rhythm Divine]]" (1987), a song co-written by Scottish singer [[Billy Mackenzie]].<ref name=a/> An album sung entirely in Spanish, ''[[La Mujer]]'' was released in 1989. In the latter mid-1980s Bassey had started working with a vocal coach, a former opera singer, and her album ''[[Keep the Music Playing]]'' (1991) displayed a grand, [[operatic pop]] style on several songs (perhaps also influenced by her album with the LSO seven years earlier).

EMI released the five-CD box set ''[[Bassey – The EMI/UA Years 1959 – 1979|Bassey – The EMI/UA Years 1959–1979]]'' in 1994. The accompanying booklet opened with a poem by [[Marc Almond]]. Bassey collaborated with [[Chris Rea]] in the film ''[[La Passione (1996 film)|La Passione]]'' (1996), appearing in the film as herself and releasing the single "[['Disco' La Passione]]". The [[remix]] of this single charted just outside the [[UK singles chart|UK]] top 40.<ref name=officialcharts/> Bassey's "[[History Repeating (song)|History Repeating]]" (1997), written for her by the [[Propellerheads]], reached number one on the [[UK Dance Chart]], and number 10 on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|US Dance Chart]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=propellerheads|chart=Dance/Club Play Songs}}|title=History Repeating|magazine=Billboard|access-date=28 January 2011}}</ref> The [[liner note]]s of the Propellerheads' album ''[[Decksandrumsandrockandroll]]'' included the lines: "We would like to extend our maximum respect to Shirley Bassey for honouring us with her performance. We are still in shock...." Bassey celebrated her 60th birthday in 1997 with two open-air concerts, at [[Castle Howard]] and [[Althorp]] Park, and another TV special. The resulting live album ''The Birthday Concert'' received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/1999-grammy-awards.html |title=1999 Grammy Awards |website=Metrolyrics.com |date=25 February 1999 |access-date=28 January 2011}}</ref> On 7 October 1998 in Egypt, Bassey performed for a benefit at an open-air concert close to the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] and the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]. Bassey played the Friday night at [[Henley Festival]] in 1984.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Bassey was sued in a breach of contract case in 1998 by her former personal assistant, who also accused Bassey of hitting her and making an ethnic slur. Bassey won the case.<ref name=GuardInt/> The episode was lampooned by [[Alexander Baron]] in his one-act play ''The Trial of Shirley Bassey''. The following year, she performed the official song for the rugby World Cup, "[[World In Union (song)|World in Union]]", with [[Bryn Terfel]] at the opening ceremony at The [[Millennium Stadium]], Cardiff, wearing a gown designed on the [[Welsh flag]]. Their single made the top 40, and Bassey contributed two more songs to the official album ''Land of My Fathers'', which reached number one on the UK compilations chart, and went silver.<ref name=BPI/><ref>{{cite web |title=Official Compilations Chart Top 100 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/official-compilations-chart/19991017/7503/ |publisher=Official Charts |access-date=14 May 2020 |date=17 October 1999}}</ref>

===2000–present: High profile performances and final album===
[[File:Shirley Bassey Wembley 2006.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|Bassey at [[Wembley Arena]] in 2006]]
Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Bassey continued to perform at various high profile events. In 2001, she was principal artiste at the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]'s 80th birthday celebration. On 3 June 2002, she was one of a line-up of artists including [[Elton John]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] who performed at the [[Party at the Palace|Queen's 50th Jubilee Party]] at Buckingham Palace.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
Bassey's first marriage was to Kenneth Hume in 1961. The couple separated in 1964 and divorced in 1965 in the wake of the singer's affair with actor [[Peter Finch]]. Bassey then announced to the press that she and Finch would not be marrying, telling the press: "It simply wouldn't work out. Just now I am not ready for marriage to anyone. I feel I have to be free."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=No Wedding for Shirley Bassey, Peter Finch |magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |date=1 October 1964 |page=21}}</ref> A year later, Hume sued the actor and another man, John McAuliffe, for being "indiscreet" with the singer.<ref name="autogenerated56">{{cite magazine |title=People Are Talking About |magazine=Jet |date=10 June 1965|page=56}}</ref> Both Finch and McAuliffe were cited as co-respondents in the Hume–Bassey divorce.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Shirley Bassey Divorced by Hubby for Adultery |magazine=Jet |date=11 March 1965 |page=40}}</ref> For her part, Bassey was named as co-respondent in 1965 when Finch's wife, South African actress [[Yolande Turner]], divorced the actor.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Munn |title=Hollywood Rogues| publisher=Robson |year=1991 |page=73 |isbn=0860516385}}</ref>

From 1968 until they divorced in 1979, Bassey was married to Sergio Novak, the assistant manager of the Excelsior Hotel in Venice. During this time, Novak was Bassey's manager, and they adopted Mark, her grand-nephew.<ref name=over>{{cite magazine |title=Shirley Bassey's Italian Husband Says 'It's Over' After 10-Year Marriage |magazine=Jet |date=6 September 1979 |page=62}}</ref><ref name="afterdark"/><ref name=minute-she-walked-in-the-joint/>

===Children===
The fathers of Bassey's two daughters, Sharon Bassey (a.k.a. Sharon Novak, born 1954) and Samantha Bassey (a.k.a. Samantha Novak, born 1963), are unknown.<ref name=over /><ref>{{cite magazine |quote=[Samantha is described as being] 10 months old |title=No Wedding for Shirley Bassey, Peter Finch |magazine=Jet| date=1 October 1964 |page=21}}</ref> However, Bassey's first husband suggested that Samantha, born during the couple's marriage, was the result of an affair between Bassey and [[Peter Finch]].

In 1985, Samantha, age 21, was found dead in the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]] in Bristol, England. Bassey has always maintained that the death of her daughter was not a suicide.<ref name=GuardInt/> On 24 March 2010, [[Avon and Somerset Police]] confirmed they were undertaking fresh inquiries into the death and specifically claims that the convicted killer Michael Moffat was involved in her death.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/8584649.stm |title=Fresh inquiry into death of Shirley Bassey's daughter |website=BBC News |access-date=24 March 2010 |date=24 March 2010}}</ref> However, in October 2010 it was reported that the investigation came to an end and concluded that there "is no evidence of any criminal act involved" in Novak's death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/news/a282577/no-criminal-act-in-bassey-daughter-death.html |first=Daniel |last=Sperling| title='No criminal act' in Bassey daughter death |website=Digital Spy |date=17 October 2010 |access-date=28 January 2011}}</ref> The ordeal of losing her daughter caused Bassey to temporarily lose her voice.<ref name="Saga Magazine">{{cite web |url=https://www.saga.co.uk/magazine/entertainment/celebrities/shirley-bassey |title=Shirley Bassey on 50 years in showbusiness |website=Saga Magazine |first=Richard|last=Barber|access-date=9 September 2019 |date=9 September 2019}}</ref>

==Honours==
Bassey was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) on 31 December 1999 by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] for services to entertainment.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=55710 |date=31 December 1999 |page=8 | supp=y}}</ref> She was invited to perform in 2002 at the [[Party at the Palace]], a public celebration of the Queen's [[Golden Jubilee]].

In November 2016 the [[Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama]] announced the naming of the Shirley Bassey Studio in celebration of Bassey's long-standing support for young Welsh singers studying at the College. She was awarded France's top honour, the [[Legion d'Honneur]], to signify her popularity and importance in the culture of France. Bassey was awarded the freedom of her hometown, Cardiff, in a ceremony at City Hall on 17 May 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/shirley-bassey-cardiff-freedom-dame-16294322|title=Dame Shirley Bassey returns to Cardiff to receive freedom of the city|access-date=19 May 2019|author= Matt Discombe|date=17 May 2019|publisher= WalesOnline |quote= She said the award "is up there with becoming a Dame.
