At age 16, Varner picked up a guitar for the first time. She dropped the guitar and became a part of Alexander Hamilton High School's Academy of Music's Vocal Jazz Group.

Through this program, she was taken weekly to the Fox Studio, where she met with mentor Kelly Burgos, and President of Fox Music, Robert Kraft.

Not only did she get in, but also she was admitted into the second class of the [[Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music]]. Upon graduating, she was awarded "most likely to get signed" and "most likely to win a Grammy."
