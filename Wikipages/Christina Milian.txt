Flores changed her name and adopted her mother's maiden name (Milian) in the hopes of landing a wider range of acting roles.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The oldest of three sisters, including Danielle and Elizabeth, she moved with her family to [[Waldorf, Maryland]], soon after her birth. Milian was four years old when she showed an interest in show business,<ref name="milianfive"/> and when her family realized that she was a talented actress, she became determined to pursue an entertainment career.<ref name="milianbiog">{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1807439013/bio|title=Christina Milian Biography|work=[[Yahoo!

They inspired her to have fun, and she convinced her parents that she "did not want to be inside the TV", although it took some time to convince them.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> By the time she was nine years old, Milian had begun auditioning with local talent agencies,<ref name="autogenerated1" /> shot commercials for [[Wendy's]] and [[Honeycomb (cereal)|Honeycomb]], and played the lead role in the musical ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''. Milian's mother noticed her daughter's potential and left her husband and moved to [[Los Angeles]] with her three daughters when Milian was 13 years old. Her father had to stay in Maryland and divorced her mother soon after the move.<ref name="milianbiog"/>

When Milian moved to Los Angeles, her only desire was to be an actress. She always wanted to be in the record business, but did not know how to obtain a [[recording contract]]. During this time, she was a host for [[Disney Channel]]'s series ''[[Movie Surfers]]'', by the name of Tina. After living in Los Angeles for six months, Milian moved into the same apartment complex as songwriter and producer [[Rodney Jerkins|Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]]. Jerkins heard about Milian from a boy band he was working with and once he heard her sing, they began working together. For a year and a half, Milian went into a studio every day and worked with Jerkins, which is where she started meeting people in the record business.<ref name="milianinter">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_2_35/ai_n11839374|title=Christina Milian: a Singer who Needs no Lessons in Cool Talks to Hip-Hop's Queen Bee|author=[[Lil' Kim]]|publisher=[[FindArticles]]|date=March 2005|access-date=July 24, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215061437/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_2_35/ai_n11839374|archive-date=February 15, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> She began writing songs at the age of 17 because she needed a [[Demo (music)|demo]] to help her obtain a recording contract. According to Milian, every time she recorded a song, the producer would refuse to give her the demo, or would write lyrics that she did not agree with. She felt that she had to write a song, record a demo, and send it out on her own.<ref name="milianinterviewin"/>

==Career==

===2000–02: ''Christina Milian'', record deal and acting debut===
Milian made her first professional musical appearance on rapper [[Ja Rule]]'s second studio album ''[[Rule 3:36]]'' (2000), performing vocals on the song "[[Between Me and You]]".<ref name="mtv"/> The song was released as the album's lead single in 2000, peaking at number 11 on the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]],<ref name="chartmilian1">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67226/chart-beat-bonus|title=Chart Beat Bonus|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 23, 2004|access-date=July 23, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427031029/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67226/chart-beat-bonus|archive-date=April 27, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and in the top 30 of the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25013431_ITM|title=The Official UK Singles Chart Top 75|last=Jones|first=Alan|magazine=[[Music Week]]|date=January 26, 2002|access-date=July 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208141759/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25013431_ITM|archive-date=December 8, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Milian co-wrote and performed backing vocals for the track "[[Play (Jennifer Lopez song)|Play]]" for [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s album ''[[J.

Milian's collaboration with Ja Rule led to a record deal with [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Soul Records]], prompted by his affiliation with [[Murder Inc. Records]], an imprint that was distributed through [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]], the parent label of Def Soul Records. She travelled to Sweden and recorded her [[Christina Milian (album)|self-titled debut album]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/03/news/wk-movies3|title=As this Moon she Rises Higher|last=Baker|first=Soren|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 3, 2005|access-date=August 17, 2008}}</ref> The album was released on October 9, 2001 in the UK,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005PJAV|title=Christina Milian: Christina Milian: Music|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=August 17, 2008}}</ref> peaking at number 23 and selling a total of 101,986 copies.<ref name="album sales"/> Internationally, the album peaked at number 36 in the Netherlands, and number 98 in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Christina+Milian&titel=Christina+Milian&cat=a|title=Christina Milian – ''Christina Milian'' (Album)|work=[[Swiss Music Charts]]|access-date=July 20, 2008}}</ref> The album's domestic release was postponed because of the [[September 11 attacks]], which occurred just two weeks before its release date.

The critical response to the album was mixed to generally positive.

She said that "AM to PM" was a "cool record," but it was not what the public expected. Milian approached the executives at her record company, [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|Island Def Jam]], and "cussed them all out", telling them that they were not listening to her. She felt that she had gained their respect by explaining that she was serious about her musical career.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> In the following years, she was featured on the track "It's All Gravy", a duet with British rapper [[Romeo (MC)|Romeo]], which was a UK top ten hit;<ref name="chartmilian1"/> provided the theme song for the hit [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Kim Possible]]'', "[[Call Me, Beep Me!]]";<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69716/kidz-titles-bring-pop-songs-to-youngsters|title="Kidz" Titles Bring Pop Songs To Youngsters|last=Jeckell|first=Barry|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=August 1, 2003|access-date=July 24, 2008}}</ref> and collaborated with [[Hilary Duff]] on Duff's Christmas album ''[[Santa Claus Lane]]'' (2002), on the song "I Heard Santa on the Radio".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60Tis+the+Season+for+Walt+Disney+Records+Holiday+Gift+Guide+2002.-a093510536|title='Tis the Season for Walt Disney Records Holiday Gift Guide 2002|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|date=October 29, 2002|access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>

Milian felt that [[Island Def Jam Music Group|Island Def Jam]] was confused as to how they wanted her image to be portrayed; one second she was young and singing "AM to PM", and next she was a grown woman singing "Get Away".

After the international release of her debut album, Milian went back into the recording studio. The singer felt that music trends had changed into [[rock music]], [[hardcore hip hop]] and [[Tribute album|tribute songs]], and her music did not fall into those categories.

==Artistry==
Milian is a light-lyric [[soprano]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20150348,00.html |title=Picks and Pans Review: It's About Time |access-date=July 9, 2012}}</ref> who has not displayed her voice all the way in terms of upper register.

Earlier in her career, Milian was mainly an [[urban pop]] and [[teen pop]] singer but as she matured and grew her sound later grew to branch out into a more [[hip-hop soul]] and straight forward [[R&B]] sound on her later two releases It's About Time and So Amazin'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486894/christina-milian-paints-sexy-new-image.jhtml |title=Christina Milian's Sexy New Look Comes In Flat Or Semigloss |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024072212/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486894/christina-milian-paints-sexy-new-image.jhtml |archive-date=October 24, 2012 |access-date=July 9, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1509188/milian-hit-airwaves-theaters-march.jhtml |title=Christina Milian's Spring Lineup: Hot Single, Scary Movie |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024000626/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1509188/milian-hit-airwaves-theaters-march.jhtml |archive-date=October 24, 2012 |access-date=July 9, 2012 }}</ref>

The critic also compared Milian to [[Beyoncé]], "while Beyonce is shaking her bootylicious body like crazy on '[[Crazy in Love (Beyoncé song)|Crazy In Love]]', Milian is simply enjoying becoming a young star."<ref name="danwreview">{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/weekly/review/archive/030925/review11.htm |title=Eight Days a Week |access-date=December 15, 2008 |date=September 25, 2003 |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214005325/http://dawn.com/weekly/review/archive/030925/review11.htm |archive-date=December 14, 2007 }}</ref>
"It's About Time" Compared to her "bubble-gum pop" debut album, Milian described the genre of ''It's About Time'' as more R&B.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> Discussing the change of genre between her lead singles, Milian said that the "first single off my last album, 'AM to PM', was more of a kiddie kind of thing, very pop. [Dip It Low] is more R&B, kind of a club/party kind of vibe."<ref name="milianimage"/> An issue Milian had with the album was that it did not flow. The various pop and urban influences in that album, she found, confused the audience. For her next studio album, Milian said that she wanted a more consistent feel.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicremedy.com/c/Christina_Milian/album/So_Amazin-2530.html |title=Christina Milian ''So Amazin{{'}}'' Album |access-date=August 3, 2008 |website=Musicremedy.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016210543/http://www.musicremedy.com/c/Christina_Milian/album/So_Amazin-2530.html |archive-date=October 16, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Other ventures==
In 2010, Milian signed an Australian music duo, Kasey Osborne and Kelsey-Maree, as their manager. Milian said, "the girls have everything it takes to be the biggest international pop duo out there. The world is definitely ready for these beautiful girls to hit the stage and kill it on screen." She said that the duo were the "most exciting project" she had worked on.
