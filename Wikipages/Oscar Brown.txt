'''Oscar Brown Jr.''' (October 10, 1926{{spaced ndash}}May 29, 2005) was an American singer, songwriter, playwright, poet, [[civil rights]] activist, and actor. Aside from his career, Brown ran unsuccessfully for office in both the [[Illinois]] [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] and the [[U.S. Congress]]. Brown wrote many songs (125 have been published), 12 albums, and more than a dozen musical plays.

==Early life and education==
Brown was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States,<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=29/30}}</ref> to [[Oscar Brown Sr.]] and Helen (née Clark). Brown's father was an attorney<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and real estate broker. Brown's first acting debut was on the radio show ''Secret City'' at the age of 15.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> For high school, Brown attended [[Englewood Technical Prep Academy]] (then known as Englewood High School). After high school, Brown attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] but later dropped out.<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-05-30/news/0505300114_1_jazz-scene-usa-mr-brown-sin-and-soul|title=Oscar Brown Jr., 78 – Jazzman gave back to community|author=Jamie Francisco|date=May 30, 2005|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=September 1, 2011}}</ref>

During Brown's twenties, he worked as the "world's first Black newscaster" for ''Negro Newsfront'', a Chicago radio program that he coproduced with [[Vernon Jarrett]].<ref name=HistoryMakers>{{cite web |title=Vernon Jarrett Biography |url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=12&category=MediaMakers |website=Thehistorymakers.com |archive-date=July 6, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040706020330/http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=12&category=mediaMakers }}</ref> He worked briefly in real estate and public relations before running for political offices: for the Illinois Legislature in 1948 through the Progressive Party, and for the U. S. House of Representatives as a Republican in 1952. During this period, 1946 to 1956, he was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]]; he quit when he decided that he was "just too black to be red." Later he served two years in the U. S. Army.<ref name="Brown born">{{cite web |title=Oscar Brown Jr., born |url=https://aaregistry.org/story/oscar-brown-jr-actor-director-songwriter-and-activist/ |website=African American Registry |access-date=2 December 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
===Music===
Brown's father intended for him to follow in his footsteps and become a practicing lawyer.

While he did help his father at his practice, he ventured off into other careers such as advertising and served in the army in the mid-1950s. He also wrote songs.

In the early 1950s, Brown was hired as a copy-writer<ref name="LarkinSM"/> by a small Chicago advertising company on Rush Street, Gershuny and Associates, owned by Sam Gershuny and Sheldon Sosna. At that time, Rush Street was totally segregated and Sam and Shelly took him to Adolf's, a high class Italian restaurant. As soon as they walked in, the owner sent the busboy over to say that the boss “did not want to serve Negroes in his restaurant.” So they just sat there and refused to leave until he finally decided to serve them. They did that in a number of restaurants up and down Rush Street in those days. A fraternity brother of Gershuny and Sosna owned a string of hotels and approached them about advertising his hotels, by sponsoring two hours of the news in the morning on a black radio station. They decided to make Oscar Brown Jr. the disc jockey for the segment, starting at 5:30 until 7:30 in the morning. Unfortunately, they discovered Oscar was never making it at 5:30 as he was supposed to and they were lucky if he got there by 6:00. Also, Brown would make politically controversial comments about the on-going Korean War. As a result, he did not last long as the DJ.

When [[Mahalia Jackson]] recorded one of his songs, "Brown Baby", he began to focus on a career as a songwriter.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> His first major contribution to a recorded work was a collaboration with [[Max Roach]], ''[[We Insist!]]'', which was an early record celebrating the black freedom movement in the United States. [[Columbia Records]] signed Brown as a solo artist, who was by now in his mid-thirties and married with five children.<ref>Liner Notes for ''Sin & Soul'', by Robert Barron Nemiroff.</ref>

In 1960, Brown released his first LP, ''Sin & Soul'',<ref name="LarkinSM"/> recorded from June 20 to October 23, 1960.<ref name=Obit/> Printed on the cover of the album were personal reviews by well-known celebrities and jazz musicians of the time, including [[Steve Allen]], Lorraine Hansberry, [[Nat Hentoff]], Dorothy Killgallen, [[Max Roach]] and [[Nina Simone]] (Simone would later cover his "Work Song" and Steve Allen would later hire him for his ''[[Jazz Scene USA]]'' television program). The album is regarded as a "true classic"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sin-soul-mw0000079685|title=Sin & Soul – Oscar Brown, Jr. &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> for openly tackling the experiences of African Americans with songs such as "Bid 'Em In" and "[[Afro Blue]]". ''Sin & Soul'' is also significant because Brown took several popular jazz instrumentals and combined them with self-penned lyrics on songs such as "[[Dat Dere]]", "[[Afro Blue]]" and "[[Work Song (Nat Adderly song)|Work Song]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> This began a trend that would continue with several other major jazz vocalists. Several of the tracks from ''Sin & Soul'' were embraced by the 1960s [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] movement, such as "Humdrum Blues",<ref>The track is included in the [[Ace Records (United Kingdom)|Ace Records]] series ''The Return Of Mod Jazz'' (Mod Jazz Series), and is described as a "mod anthem".</ref> "Work Song" and [[Herbie Hancock]]'s, "[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> ''Sin & Soul'' was followed by ''Between Heaven and Hell'' (1962).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The success of ''Sin & Soul'' meant that much more money was spent on production and [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Ralph Burns]] were bought in to handle the arrangements.

However, Brown was soon to fall down the pecking order at Columbia following a rearrangement of the management at the company. His third album was notable for the lack of any self-composed songs, and Columbia was having a hard time packaging him as an artist. They were unsure whether Brown was suited to middle-of-the-road/[[easy listening]] nightclubs or alternatively should be presented as a jazz artist. Brown was given much more creative freedom for his fourth album, ''Tells It Like It Is'' (1963), and he was back to his creative best, composing songs such as "[[The Snake (Al Wilson song)|The Snake]]",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> which became a [[Northern soul]] classic when it was covered by [[Al Wilson (singer)|Al Wilson]], and has featured on several adverts. Despite this return to form, and having been told by the new head of Columbia, that he was high on the company's priorities, his contract at Columbia was not renewed.

===Stage and television===
He attempted to mount a major musical stage show in New York City called ''Kicks & Co.'' in 1961.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Host [[Dave Garroway]] turned over an entire broadcast of the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show to Brown to perform numbers from the show and try to raise the necessary funds to launch it on the stage. ''Kicks & Co.'' is set on an all-African-American college campus in the American South during the early days of attempted [[desegregation]]. The character Mr. Kicks is an emissary of [[Satan]], sent to try to derail these efforts in which the play's protagonist, Ernest Black, has become involved. This was the first of several theatrical endeavors by Brown, and like all of them, the public was not won over sufficiently to allow financial success, despite acclaim by some critics. His longest-running relative success, thanks to the participation of [[Muhammad Ali]], was ''Buck White''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Langer |first1=Adam |title=Muhammad Ali in a Broadway Musical? It Happened |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/theater/muhammad-ali-broadway-buck-white.html |access-date=2020-08-28 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> Another notable musical show, ''Joy'', saw two incarnations (in 1966 and 1969) and again addressed social issues. Appearing with Brown were his wife, Jean Pace, and the Brazilian singer/accordionist [[Sivuca]]. [[RCA Victor|RCA]] released the original cast recording around 1970; it is long out of print. In 1962, he worked on the Westinghouse syndicated television program ''[[Jazz Scene USA]]'', produced by Steve Allen. Brown was the show's presenter and it featured a new musical guest each week.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrod|first=James A.|title=JAZZ SCENE U.S.A. #1: THE JAZZ CRUSADERS|url=http://jazzsceneusa.blogspot.ca/2012/09/jazz-scene-u.html|website=Jazzsceneusa.blogspot.ca|access-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Brown was married to Jean Pace, the older sister of actress [[Judy Pace]]. He was the father of seven children. His son, Oscar "BoBo" Brown III was a bassist and musical arranger who died in a car crash in August 1996. His daughter, [[Maggie Brown (Singer)|Maggie]], is a singer. A Chicago musical review referred to the trio as "The First Family of Swing." They were joined by the youngest daughter, Africa Pace Brown, in an effort to popularize his music. Brown's first son, Napoleon "David" Brown, inspired the song "Brown Baby" and helped his father promotional appearances and business. The remaining family members consist of Donna Brown Kane, Joan Olivia Brown, and Iantha Brown Casen, who participated in some of her father's production.

On May 29, 2005, Oscar Brown died in his hometown of Chicago from [[osteomyelitis]] at the age of 78.<ref name="Jetobit">{{cite web|title=Oscar Brown Jr., 78, Singer Songwriter Dies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15 |access-date=September 10, 2019|date=June 20, 2005|page=15|publisher = Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref>

==Humanitarian work==
Brown founded the Oscar Brown Jr. H.I.P. Legacy Foundation to continue his humanitarian work. He participated in an anti-apartheid protest rally in Compton College in 1976.<ref>Ed Hamilton, [http://jazztimes.com/community/articles/114724-brown-brando-and-mandela "Brown, Brando and Mandela"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082852/http://jazztimes.com/community/articles/114724-brown-brando-and-mandela |date=April 7, 2014 }}, ''JazzTimes'', December 16, 2013.</ref>

Brown wrote the [[vocalese]] lyrics to the [[Duke Pearson]] melody "Jeannine" as sung by [[Eddie Jefferson]] on the album ''The Main Man'' recorded in October 1974<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cunniffe |first1=Thomas |title=Eddie Jefferson: "The Main Man" (Inner City 1033) |url=http://www.jazzhistoryonline.com/Eddie_Jefferson.html|website=Jazz History Online|access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> and covered by [[The Manhattan Transfer]] on their 1984 album ''[[Bop Doo-Wopp]]''. "Somebody Buy Me a Drink", a track from ''Sin & Soul'', was covered by [[David Johansen]] and the Harry Smiths on their eponymous first album. "Hymn to Friday" from ''Between Heaven and Hell'' is played on jazz radio stations such as [[WDCB]]. Pianist [[Wynton Kelly]] recorded "Strongman" with his trio in the late 1950s. [[Nina Simone]] popularized Brown's lyrics to "Work Song", "Afro Blue", and "Bid 'Em In."<ref name = "ChicagoDefender">[http://www.chicagodefender.com/article-8140-oscar-brown-jr-recognized-as-one-of-chicagorss-top-artistic-creators.html "Oscar Brown Jr. recognized as one of Chicago’s top artistic creators"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721022243/http://www.chicagodefender.com/article-8140-oscar-brown-jr-recognized-as-one-of-chicagorss-top-artistic-creators.html |date=July 21, 2010 }}, ''Chicago Defender'', June 30, 2010.</ref>

Brown's lyrics to "Afro Blue" have been performed by [[Dianne Reeves]], [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]], and [[Lizz Wright]]. Vocalist [[Karrin Allyson]] cited Brown as an inspiration and has performed his compositions on several of her albums. Brown was scheduled to contribute lyrics to Allyson's 2006 album ''Footprints'' before his death; instead she recorded his songs "A Tree and Me" and "But I Was Cool" as a tribute.<ref name="AllAboutJazzAllyson">{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=3381|title=All About Jazz|first=All About|last=Jazz|website=All About Jazz|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref>

Brown was the subject of a tribute album by cabaret singer Linda Kosut.<ref name="AllAboutJazzKosut">[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=26833 Jerry D'Souza, "Linda Kosut: Long As You're Living (2007)"], All About Jazz, September 7, 2007.</ref>
