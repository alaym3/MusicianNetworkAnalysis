'''Frightened Rabbit''' are a Scottish [[indie rock]] band from [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], formed in 2003. Initially a solo project for vocalist and guitarist [[Scott Hutchison]], the final line-up of the band consisted of Hutchison, his brother [[Grant Hutchison]] (drums), Billy Kennedy (guitar, bass), Andy Monaghan (guitar, keyboards) and Simon Liddell (guitar). From 2004 the band were based in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frightenedrabbit.com/about |title=About |publisher=Frightened Rabbit |date=16 June 2009 |access-date=15 December 2012}}</ref>

Frightened Rabbit's first studio album, ''[[Sing the Greys]]'', was recorded by the Hutchison brothers and Billy Kennedy, released on independent label Hits the Fan in 2006. The band subsequently signed to [[Fat Cat Records]], in 2007, and shortly after recorded their second album ''[[The Midnight Organ Fight]]'' (2008). The album was released to strongly positive reviews and extensive touring, with guitarist and keyboardist Andy Monaghan joining the band to flesh-out its live performances.

The band's third studio album, ''[[The Winter of Mixed Drinks]]'', was released in 2010, with former [[Make Model]] guitarist Gordon Skene joining the band for its accompanying tour. Frightened Rabbit signed to [[Atlantic Records]] later that year, and issued two EPs, ''[[A Frightened Rabbit EP]]'' (2011) and ''[[State Hospital (EP)]]'' (2012), before the release of its fourth studio album, ''[[Pedestrian Verse]]'' in 2013. A critical and commercial success in the UK, the album peaked at number nine on the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref>{{cite web |title=FRIGHTENED RABBIT {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/6122/frightened-rabbit/ |website=www.officialcharts.com |access-date=2 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref> with additional guitarist Simon Liddell joining the band on its subsequent tour.

Disillusioned from touring, Scott Hutchison, Monaghan, and Liddell recorded a studio album without the band, entitled ''[[Owl John (album)|Owl John]]'' (2014). Gordon Skene departed from the band in early 2014, and the band recorded ''[[Painting of a Panic Attack]]'' the following year with producer [[Aaron Dessner]] ([[The National (band)|The National]]), in [[New York (state)|New York]], with Liddell joining the band as a full contributing member.

Scott Hutchison died in May 2018 after going missing. In December 2018 the remaining members of the band played together for the first time since Hutchison's death, at a charity gig in Glasgow with special guests performing vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46466929 |title=Frightened Rabbit preparing for 'highly emotional' return |work=BBC News |access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> The band have said that Frightened Rabbit "no longer exists" without Scott Hutchison, although some music for the album that was in progress when Hutchison died may be released in the future.<ref name=GUAR19>{{cite news |title=‘His memory shouldn’t be shrouded in darkness’: How Frightened Rabbit coped with the death of Scott Hutchison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/21/his-memory-shouldnt-be-shrouded-in-darkness-how-frightened-rabbit-coped-with-the-death-of-scott-hutchison |author=Ross, Peter |access-date=27 June 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=21 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=National19>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/17743134.39-won-39-t-morning-don-39-t-wake-isn-39-t-first-thing-think-39-frightened-rabbit-life-scott-hutchison/ | title= Frightened Rabbit on life after Scott Hutchison |author= Jamieson, Teddy |date=7 July 2019 |newspaper=The National}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and first years (2003–2006)===
In 2003, vocalist and guitarist [[Scott Hutchison]] used the name Frightened Rabbit, which came from a name his mother gave him in his youth due to his chronic shyness,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/articles/how-they-became%E2%80%A6-frightened-rabbit | title=How They Became... Frightened Rabbit | publisher=Spin.com | author=Marchese, David | date=25 January 2010 | access-date=27 March 2012}}</ref> as a stage moniker for his solo shows. The project became a full-fledged band with the addition of his brother [[Grant Hutchison]] on drums in 2004, and guitarist Billy Kennedy in 2006. During early shows, the band would give out their email address for those interested in receiving a free demo. After a time during which few demos were sent out, Scott said that he would send out biscuits with the music, which led to a rise in requests for the demo. This led to a lasting impression with the recipients. {{quote|text=I'd send them to the U.S. and stuff, and they'd turn up as bags of crumbs, but I think it's still something that people will remember. I don't know, I suppose it was just one of those little things that people will remember, rather than making it disposable and forgettable.}}

===''Sing the Greys'' (2006–2007)===
The band released their debut album ''[[Sing the Greys]]'' in May 2006 on local label, ''Hits The Fan''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitsthefan.co.uk/downloads/fr-prdownload.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615060651/http://www.hitsthefan.co.uk/downloads/fr-prdownload.pdf |archive-date=15 June 2006 |title=Frightened Rabbit – "Sing the Greys"}}</ref> The band was offered a deal from [[Fiction Records]] but ultimately the label withdrew their offer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music/the-shy-boy-the-biscuit-bribes-and-a-trail-of-crumbs-that-led-to-a-major-record-deal-the-strange-tale-of-frighte?_=db5c69b3648ba7be49f589c259422579ee75684a |title=The shy boy, the biscuit bribes and a trail of crumbs that led to a major record deal: the strange tale of Frightened Rabbit |newspaper=Herald Scotland |access-date=20 January 2013}}</ref> In January 2007, [[The Self-Starter Foundation]] brought the band to the [[East Coast of the United States]] for a short tour. The band returned to the United States in March to play [[SXSW]]. [[Brighton]] [[independent record label|indie]] label [[Fat Cat Records]] released a remixed/remastered version of the album in the US in October 2007, distributed by [[Caroline Distribution]]. The band then embarked on a full American tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/news.php?id=546 |title=FatCat Records : News |publisher=Fat-cat.co.uk |access-date=8 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109095614/http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/news.php?id=546 |archive-date=9 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album was released in the UK in November 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/release.php?id=237 |title=FatCat Records : Releases |publisher=Fat-cat.co.uk |access-date=8 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004222809/http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/release.php?id=237 |archive-date=4 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===''The Midnight Organ Fight'' (2008–2009)===
Earlier in 2007, the band had recorded a new album, ''[[The Midnight Organ Fight]]'' at producer [[Peter Katis]]'s Tarquin Studios in [[Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tarquinrecords.com/studio/discography.html |title=Peter Katis |publisher=Tarquinrecords.com |access-date=8 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211234355/http://www.tarquinrecords.com/studio/discography.html |archive-date=11 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thepopcop.co.uk/2007/08/theres-a-song-about-throwing-yourself-off-the-forth-road-bridge-ive-thought-about-it-before/ |title=There's a song about throwing yourself off the Forth Road Bridge.

After recording ''The Midnight Organ Fight'', the current quartet line-up was completed with the addition of guitarist/keyboardist Andy Monaghan of Piano Bar Fight (who have previously played as support to Frightened Rabbit). In an interview, Scott mentions that he "met him on New Year's Eve, in [[Glasgow]], in a bar. I was really hammered and I was like 'why don't you come and play some shows with us man?' and he was like 'Yeah!'. The next day, I got a text like 'Do you remember… did you say something about this or is it my imagination?'".<ref>[http://www.audioscribbler.co.uk/features/frightenedrabbit1.html]{{dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref>

The band supported [[Death Cab for Cutie]] during their November 2008 UK & Irish tour,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/news.php?id=840&offset=0&artistList=&imprintList= |title=FatCat Records : News |publisher=Fat-cat.co.uk |access-date=8 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109073623/http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/news.php?id=840&offset=0&artistList=&imprintList= |archive-date=9 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and released a live album, ''[[Quietly Now!]]'' in October.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/145372-frightened-rabbit-to-release-live-album |title=Pitchfork: Frightened Rabbit to Release Live Album |publisher=Pitchforkmedia.com |date=9 September 2008 |access-date=8 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910101702/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/145372-frightened-rabbit-to-release-live-album |archive-date=10 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===''The Winter of Mixed Drinks'' (2010)===
Whilst touring in support of ''[[The Midnight Organ Fight]]'', Scott Hutchison noted that he was "excited at the prospect of being in the studio again,"<ref name="godisinthetvzine.co.uk"/> and that stated that he "can't do another break-up album 'cause I haven't had one this year! Maybe it'll just be a little less focused on me".<ref>[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]:Issue 39 pg. 35</ref>

Hutchison subsequently announced plans to head to [[Crail]], Fife to write material for the band's third studio album:<ref>Qmunicate: Issue 66, ''Down the Rabbit Hole'', pg. 11</ref> {{quote|text=The theme I'm going for is pushing yourself out to the edge of things and being alone, feeling lost and not knowing where you are, which is how I've felt recently. It's not all fun and games, but hopefully it'll just be less obviously personal and brutal than the last record. Less oppressive.}}

In May 2009, a video appeared online of Hutchison performing a new track, entitled "Swim Until You Can't See Land".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://offthebeatentracks.tv/2009/episode-5-frightened-rabbit/ |title=Episode No.&nbsp;5: Frightened Rabbit &#124; Off The Beaten Tracks |publisher=Offthebeatentracks.tv |access-date=8 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114034954/http://offthebeatentracks.tv/2009/episode-5-frightened-rabbit/ |archive-date=14 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The song was later revealed as the first single from the forthcoming third album.

In October 2009, the band members unveiled the album's title, ''[[The Winter of Mixed Drinks]]'', and announced the arrival of a fifth band member, Gordon Skene (formerly of [[Make Model]]). According to Scott Hutchison:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepopcop.co.uk/2009/10/i-didn’t-make-the-album-i-wanted-to-last-time-i-had-to-exorcise-that-feeling/ |title=I didn't make the album I wanted to last time – I had to exorcise that feeling |publisher=[[The Pop Cop]] |date=17 October 2009 |access-date=8 November 2009}}</ref>

{{quote|text=A lot of the new record is heavily layered and it felt like too much for the four of us to do. We need another member to get them at their full impact. I dunno, we're kind of bored of each other. We just need to add some fresh meat.}}

''The Winter of Mixed Drinks'' was released in March 2010.

The band made their US television debut on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on 25 May 2010, performing "Nothing Like You". In June 2010, they appeared on [[The A.V. Club]] covering [[The Lemonheads]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Padgett |first=Ray |url=http://www.covermesongs.com/2010/06/frightened-rabbit-bum-you-out-on-lemonheads-cover.html |title=Frightened Rabbit Bum You Out on Lemonheads Cover " Cover Me |publisher=Covermesongs.com |date=6 December 2012 |access-date=15 December 2012}}</ref> On 12 October 2010, the television crime drama ''[[Detroit 1-8-7]]'' featured the song "Yes I Would."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/music-lounge/show/detroit-187/440638 |title=ABC.com – Music Lounge Home |publisher=Abc.go.com |access-date=15 December 2012}}</ref> The first single from the album, "Swim Until You Can't See Land" was also used in the trailer for the 2010 movie, "[[The Beaver (film)|The Beaver]]". They have also been chosen personally by [[Belle & Sebastian]] to perform at their second [[Bowlie Weekender]] festival, presented by [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] in the UK in December 2010. Again, the band supported [[Death Cab for Cutie]] during their 2011 North American tour.

===Signing to Atlantic and ''A Frightened Rabbit EP'' (2010–2012)===
''[[A Frightened Rabbit EP]]'' was released on 28 July 2011 and was available exclusively on their subsequent tour. On 19 October 2011, the EP was released as a free download to subscribers to the band's newsletter, with the announcement of a limited-run vinyl being available for pre-order.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frightenedrabbit.com/updates/a-frightened-rabbit-ep |title=A Frightened Rabbit EP |publisher=frightenedrabbit.com |date=19 October 2011 |access-date=9 January 2012}}</ref> The songs on the album are Scottish Winds, Fuck This Place, and The Work.

In addition to Frightened Rabbit, [[Camera Obscura (band)|Camera Obscura]]'s Tracyanne Campbell contributes vocals on "Fuck This Place". [[Archie Fisher]] sings on "The Work".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/frightened-rabbit-release-free-threesong-ep,63739/ |title=Frightened Rabbit release free three-song EP |publisher=avclub.com |date=20 October 2011 |access-date=9 January 2012}}</ref>

In 2010, Hutchison wrote, recorded and performed with [[The Fruit Tree Foundation]], appearing on its debut album, ''First Edition''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Innes |first=Kirstin |url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/29535-fruit-tree-foundation-launches-new-album-tackling-themes-of-mental-health/ |title=Fruit Tree Foundation launches new album tackling themes of mental health |magazine=The List |date=22 September 2010 |access-date=15 December 2012}}</ref>

===''Pedestrian Verse'' (2013)===
On 6 December 2011, [[Clash (magazine)|Clash Music]] reported that ''Frightened Rabbit'' were planning to record their fourth album, and Scott Hutchison states, "it's written, essentially," noting that they are on the production stage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/frightened-rabbit-talk-fourth-album |title=Frightened Rabbit Talk Fourth Album |publisher=clashmusic.com |date=6 December 2011 |access-date=7 January 2012}}</ref> Scott states, "We're experimenting with minor keys, which is actually new for us," remarking upon the idea of a new sound. The band announced that on 1 May 2012 they would start recording the fourth album.

The fourth album will also mark the first time for the band that it is not Scott Hutchison alone with the task of songwriting, with Hutchison saying that "it's done nothing but benefit the new songs." The album is expected to be released early in 2013, preceded by an EP, entitled ''[[State Hospital (EP)|State Hospital]]'', featuring Scottish vocalist [[Aidan Moffat]], released 25 September 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music/dark-matters.1328843053 |title=Dark Matters |publisher=heraldscotland.com |date=10 February 2012 |access-date=16 February 2012}}</ref>

On tour in 2012 for support of ''State Hospital'', Scott announced that the album would be released in February 2013. In November 2012, Frightened Rabbit announced the name of their new album, ''[[Pedestrian Verse]]'', via their official Facebook page. Released to widespread critical acclaim, the band embarked upon an extensive tour in support of the album.

===Owl John and Gordon Skene's departure (2014–2015)===
Regarding a forthcoming fifth studio album, Hutchison noted in October 2013: "We're going to have to start thinking about the next record after this tour. We've done a lot of writing in Scotland, but it would be good to shift it up a gear and get out of the comfort zone, away from what we're used to, and over [in America] would be good for that. So the only worry, especially on the West Coast and California, is the effect that may have on my writing, and whether I would be all happy and full of vitamins."<ref name="list">{{cite web |url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/55380-interview-scott-hutchison-from-frightened-rabbit/|title= Interview: Scott Hutchison from Frightened Rabbit |first=Kelly |last=Smith |work=list.co.uk |access-date=21 October 2013}}</ref>

In January 2014, Scott Hutchison revealed plans to record a solo album, stating: "With ''Pedestrian Verse'' being more collaborative, I said I’d never write a Frightened Rabbit record in the way I used to, which is true. But it doesn’t mean I don’t want to write any records like that. It’s going to be really pleasant to go back to that way of working, where I sit around and do stuff myself."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepopcop.co.uk/2014/01/scott-hutchison-unveils-solo-album-plans-id-like-it-to-be-a-bit-more-claustrophobic-and-more-intimate-than-frightened-rabbit/|title=Welcome thepopcop.co.uk - BlueHost.com}}</ref> Both keyboardist and guitarist Andy Monaghan and touring member Simon Liddell collaborated with Scott on the project, which was later named [[Owl John]].

On 25 March 2014, Gordon Skene departed the band owing to "differing opinions" with the four other members. The band wrote on Facebook: "There is no more to tell other than sometimes things just don’t work out and when people have differing opinions often the best option is to simply part ways and get on with life separately."<ref name="skeneleaves">{{cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/culture/0232/band-member-departs-frightened-rabbit|title=Band member departs Frightened Rabbit|date=25 March 2014|access-date=25 March 2014|publisher=The Targe}}</ref>

===''Painting of a Panic Attack'' (2016–2017)===
Frightened Rabbit announced via social media their fifth album, ''[[Painting of a Panic Attack]]'', would be released on 8 April 2016.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/frightened-rabbit-announce-new-record-painting-of-a-panic-attack |title = Frightened Rabbit announce new record Painting Of A Panic Attack, share new music |magazine=The Line of Best Fit |date=18 February 2016 |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref> The band followed the album news with an album trailer showcasing album track 'Lump Street', and UK/US 2016–2017 tour announcement on 23 February.<ref>{{cite web|title=Never Enough Notes|url=http://www.neverenoughnotes.co.uk/2016/02/frightened-rabbit-share-new-track-death-dream-ahead-of-new-album/|website=Never Enough Notes|publisher=Never Enough Notes|access-date=23 February 2016}}</ref>

Frightened Rabbit released a new song "Fields of Wheat" on 11 July 2017, with the band stating, "We made this recently. It felt like the song should go out now, because it's about what's happening now."<ref>{{cite web|title=Fields of Wheat|url=http://frightenedrabbit.com/fields-of-wheat/|website=Frightened Rabbit|access-date=13 July 2017}}</ref> In late 2017, the band released a three-track EP entitled ''Recorded Songs'', which featured a collaboration with musician [[Julien Baker]].

===Sixth album plans and death of Scott Hutchison (2018–2019)===
In early 2018, Scott and Grant announced a new side-project called [[Mastersystem]] alongside Justin and James Lockey of [[Editors (band)|Editors]] and [[Minor Victories]] respectively. The band released their debut album ''Dance Music'' on 4 April.

In February and March 2018, Frightened Rabbit embarked upon a ten-year anniversary tour in support of ''The Midnight Organ Fight''. Regarding the possibility of new material and a possible sixth studio album, Scott noted that the band were building a home studio in Glasgow, and working on songs: "We’ve got like five or six songs that are sketchy. Then there are a lot of pieces of music that don’t have lyrics on them yet, but that’s coming together. I would like for that to be finished by the end of the year. We’re just going to constantly evolve it. I’ve been certainly trying to look for new themes. There’s one that’s currently about how I question whether or not I would be willing to bring a child into the world as it stands. Not that I’m in any position to do so at all, but you know… I’m trying to find different things cause it’s album six, and I can’t do this all time time, you know. I don’t think anybody really gives a fuck about my relationships any more. So yeah, I’ll try and steer clear of that".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Frightened Rabbit give update on their next album | url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/frightened-rabbit-give-update-next-album-2257811|magazine=NME|access-date=16 March 2018}}</ref>

The band issued a statement following Hutchison's death:

{{quote
| quote = There are no words to describe the overwhelming sadness and pain that comes with the death of our beloved Scott, but to know he is no longer suffering brings us some comfort. Reading messages of support and hope from those he has helped through his art has helped immensely and we encourage you all to continue doing this. He will be missed by all of us and his absence will always be felt but he leaves a legacy of hope, kindness and colour that will forever be remembered and shared. Rest peacefully Scott. Much love.

In May 2019, the Hutchison family established [http://maketinychanges.co.uk/ Tiny Changes], a mental health charity named after a lyric from the band's song "Head Rolls Off", in memory of Scott. In July 2019, Atlantic Records released ''[[Tiny Changes: A Celebration of Frightened Rabbit's The Midnight Organ Fight]]'', an album featuring musician friends and colleagues of the band covering their 2008 album in full. It was supposed to be released in summer 2018 to mark the tenth anniversary of ''The Midnight Organ Fight'', and Scott Hutchison was fully involved in the process and had approved the tracks included. In the run-up to the covers album's release, the remaining members of the band gave several interviews, stating that "the band does not exist" without Scott. It was also mentioned that there were demos already recorded for the band's planned sixth album and that these materials may still be released by the band.<ref name=GUAR19 /><ref name=National19 />

==Band line-up==
Concerning the band's line-up, [[Scott Hutchison]] noted in 2008: "The initial lineup in Frightened Rabbit was just myself. I had really only been messing with my 4 track for about 6 months before I started playing some shows on my own. Some of the songs still didn't have words and I was mostly just mumbling nonsense half the time. [[Grant Hutchison|Grant]] joined a year later, making the outfit much noisier. Billy came along about 6 months after this and actually made it a bit less noisy. He's very calming like that is Billy. Andy has been in the band since January, and adds all the extra details we were missing before. Still not sure if we're finished gathering members".<ref name="godisinthetvzine.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/content_detail.php?id=2620&type=Interviews |title=God Is in the TV &#124; Frightened Rabbit |publisher=Godisinthetvzine.co.uk |access-date=8 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927153520/http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/content_detail.php?id=2620&type=Interviews |archive-date=27 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
