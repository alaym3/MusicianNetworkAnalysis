'''The Unicorns''' were a Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada formed in 2000 by [[Nicholas Thorburn]] (Nick Diamonds) and [[Alden Penner]] (Alden Ginger), who were later joined by [[Jamie Thompson]] (J'aime Tambeur) in December 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alien8recordings.com/artists/the-unicorns|title=Alien8 Recordings|website=Alien8recordings.com}}</ref> The band announced their split in late 2004, before reuniting for a short run of shows in 2014.

==History==
The Unicorns were formed in [[Campbell River, British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Horn Again: The Unicorns resurrect the mystic rite of having fun |author=Jason Heller |newspaper=Denver Westword |date=1 April 2004 }}</ref> in December 2000 by [[Nicholas Thorburn]] and [[Alden Penner]], who met in high school in the autumn of 1998. Alden was new to his 10th-grade class and decided to wear a skirt to school, which intrigued a 12th-grade Nick and quickly sparked their friendship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://findthemusichere.blogspot.com/2010/11/unicorns.html|title=The Indie Spotlight: UNDER CONSTRUCTION: The Unicorns|first=Virginia|last=Mclaughlin|website=Findthemusichere.blogspot.com|date=November 21, 2010}}</ref> The duo self-recorded a nine-track CD entitled ''Unicorns Are People Too'' which was released in March 2003 through their own label Caterpillars of the Community. The release was limited to 500 copies, but was later distributed widely through file-sharing networks and fansites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~abatko/unicorns/music/?a=01-Unicorns_Are_People_Too|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912131059/http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~abatko/unicorns/music/?a=01-Unicorns_Are_People_Too|url-status=dead|title=Unicorns Are People Too|archivedate=September 12, 2012}}</ref> Around this time they also self-recorded a 3" CDr entitled ''[[Three Inches of Blood]]'' which was given to venue owners who arranged the band's early shows. A split 7" with [[Arcade Fire]] was also announced, but never materialized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~abatko/unicorns/news/|title=The Unicorns :: News|website=Cs.mcgill.ca}}</ref>

In June and July 2003 the band recorded their debut studio LP ''[[Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?]]'' with producer Mark Lawson in Montreal.<ref>[https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/a-completely-biased-ranking-of-the-60-best-canadian-indie-rock-songs-of-the-00s-part-ii "A Completely Biased Ranking of the 60 Best Canadian Indie Rock Songs of the 00s Part II"]. ''Vice'', Cam Lindsay Apr 10 2017,</ref>  The album featured several reworked versions of songs from ''Unicorns Are People Too'' and featured contributions from [[Richard Reed Parry]] ([[Arcade Fire]]) and drummer [[Jamie Thompson]] who joined the band as a touring member later that year. The album was released in November 2003 on [[Alien8|Alien8 Recordings]] in North America and [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] in Europe. The album received glowing reviews from ''[[The Village Voice]]'', ''[[NME]]'', online magazine [[Pitchfork Media]] and numerous other publications around the world.<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/unicorns/whowillcutourhairwhenweregone?q=the%20unicorns Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone? Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic]. Metacritic.com (2003-10-21). Retrieved on 2011-04-10.</ref>

The band toured continuously across North America, Europe and Australia following the release of ''Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?'', including shows with [[The Decemberists]], [[The Fiery Furnaces]], [[Hot Hot Heat]], and [[Arcade Fire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/The+Unicorns/+events|title=The Unicorns tours, tickets, shows|website=Last.fm}}</ref> A promotional video was also produced for the song "Jellybones", which aired occasionally on [[120 Minutes|MTV2's ''120 Minutes'']]. In 2004, footage from multiple live performances was used to produce a promotional video for the song "I Was Born (A Unicorn)". In May 2004 an EP entitled ''[[The Unicorns: 2014]]'' was released by Seattle label [[Suicide Squeeze Records|Suicide Squeeze]]. The band became known for their chaotic live shows, described as "unruly, sometimes transcendent, sometimes akin to tantrums".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/unicorns_cant_just_get_along|title=The Unicorns Can't Just Get Along|website=Exclaim.ca}}</ref>

==Split and subsequent projects==
The band's hectic touring schedule became exhausting, leading to tensions between band members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://maisonneuve.org/article/2014/03/28/alden-penner-making-music-post-unicorns/|title=Portraits of Alden Penner|first=J. M.|last=Farr|date=March 28, 2014|website=Maisonneuve.org}}</ref> Their final show of 2004 took place at the Engine Room in Houston, TX on December 20, where they played several unreleased songs including "Haunted House", "Livin' in the Country" and "Rough Gem" (later recorded by [[Islands (band)|Islands]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/event/1384079+The+Unicorns+at+Engine+Room+on+20+December+2004|title=The Unicorns at Engine Room (Houston) on 20 Dec 2004|website=Last.fm}}</ref> On December 28, a short message appeared on the Unicorns' website reading "THE UNICORNS ARE DEAD, (R.I.P.)",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theunicorns.net/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050106014648/http://www.theunicorns.net/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 6, 2005|title=The Unicorns :: Official Website|date=January 6, 2005}}</ref> leading fans to speculate as to whether they had broken up. In January 2005 the website [[Drowned In Sound]] confirmed that the band had indeed split.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/11009-who-will-cut-their-hair-now-they-re-gone-unicorns-split|title=Who will cut their hair now they're gone? - Unicorns split|website=DrownedInSound.com|access-date=2014-09-26|archive-date=2017-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809213812/http://drownedinsound.com/news/11009-who-will-cut-their-hair-now-they-re-gone-unicorns-split|url-status=dead}}</ref> Asked about the band's demise in 2006, Thompson commented, "we all hated it like 70 percent of the time. It was just not getting along with one another on the road, and then being on the road ''all the time''. That pretty much killed it".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/extinction-of-the-unicorns/Content?oid=1083956|title=Extinction of The Unicorns|first=Stephen|last=Seigel|website=Tucsonweekly.com}}</ref>

Immediately following the split, Thorburn and Thompson continued to collaborate as Th' Corn Gangg (a hip-hop project featuring [[Giovanni Marks|Subtitle]] and [[Busdriver]]) and [[Islands (band)|Islands]] (an indie rock project). On May 28, 2006, Thompson announced his departure from Islands.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite news|first = Amy|last = Phillips|url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/news/06-05/30.shtml#islands|title = J'Aime Tambeur Quits Islands|work = Daily Music News|publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]]|date = May 30, 2006|accessdate = 2006-06-03|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615015047/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/news/06-05/30.shtml#islands|archivedate = June 15, 2006}}</ref> He returned to the band in June 2009, but left again a year later. In 2005 Thorburn co-wrote the satirical charity single "[[Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?]]".<ref name="chartattack.com">
