He is normally a jovial character known for his ability to make wisecracks and his overall humble demeanor. He speaks Italian with a [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], occasionally using Italianized Genoese words. In fact the word ''Gabibbo'' or ''Gabibbu'' {{IPA-lij|ɡaˈbibbu|}} belongs to the [[Genoese dialect|Genoese language]] and it is used to indicate, in an ironic-depreciative way, an immigrant from southern or even central Italy (it may originate from the Arab epithet ''[[habib]]'').

==Western Kentucky Hilltoppers lawsuit==
Gabibbo has also earned negative press surrounding a [[lawsuit]] brought by [[Western Kentucky University]] who claim that Gabibbo is an exact copy of their mascot, [[Big Red (Western Kentucky University)|Big Red]]. Western Kentucky claims it has a case because in an interview with ''[[Novella 2000]]'', Ricci states that he created Gabibbo after seeing Western Kentucky's mascot, further adding that Gabibbo is in fact, "(an imported) Big Red".

Ricci claims he was joking in that interview, saying that he made the remark after Novella pointed out the similarities between Big Red and Gabibbo. He goes on to say that there are "100 different mascots who look like Gabibbo", not just Big Red, adding that the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' mascots [[Cookie Monster]] and [[Elmo]] also look like Gabibbo. However, Gabibbo's head is almost an exact copy of Big Red's (a fact repeated by ''[[The New York Times]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[business]] section, who quip that Gabibbo is simply a "better dressed" version of [[Big Red (Western Kentucky University)|Big Red]]) and that Big Red debuted in 1979, almost eleven years prior to Gabibbo.
