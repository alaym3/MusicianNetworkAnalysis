==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in Miami, Florida, as Bessie Regina Norris on December 21, 1953, Wright was the youngest of seven children of Rosa Akins Braddy-Wright and her second husband, McArthur Norris. Wright began her professional career at the age of two when her siblings formed the Echoes of Joy, a [[gospel music|gospel]] group.<ref name="AMG"/> Wright contributed to vocals on the group's first album, released in 1956. Wright and her siblings performed together until 1965, when she was 11 years old.<ref>{{cite news|title=Betty Wright, US soul, funk and R&B singer, dies aged 66|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/10/betty-wright-us-soul-funk-rb-singer-dies-aged-66|first=Ben|last=Beaumont-Thomas|date=May 10, 2020|access-date=May 10, 2020|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref>

Following the group's break-up, Wright, who was already using the name Betty Wright, decided to switch musical styles from gospel to [[rhythm and blues]], singing in local talent shows until she was spotted by a Miami record label owner, who signed her to her first label (Deep City Records) in 1966, when she was 12. She released the singles "Thank You Baby" and "Paralyzed", which found Wright local fame in Miami.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soul singer Betty Wright dies at 66|url=https://ew.com/music/singer-betty-wright-dies-at-66/|first=Rosy|last=Cordero|date=May 10, 2020|access-date=May 10, 2020|magazine=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> In 1967, the teen was responsible for discovering other local talents such as [[George McCrae|George]] and [[Gwen McCrae]], helping them sign with the [[Alston Records]] label [[TK Records]], part of [[Henry Stone]]'s recording and distribution company. Her first album, ''[[My First Time Around]]'', was released when she was age 14. Her first hit single was "[[Girls Can't Do What the Guys Do]]".<ref name="AMG"/> In 1970, while still in high school, she released "Pure Love" at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/betty-wright/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-songs/song/896714|title=Pure Love Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref>

===Breakthrough===
[[File:Betty Wright, 1973.jpg|thumb|220px|Wright, 1973|left]]
About a year later, Wright released her signature song "[[Clean Up Woman]]", written by [[Blowfly (musician)|Clarence Reid]] and Willie Clarke and recorded when she was 17. The record reached number two on the R&B charts, where it stayed for eight weeks. It crossed over to the pop charts, peaking at number six and staying on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for 14 weeks.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/><ref name="The Wrap"/> It eventually sold over 1&nbsp;million copies and was certified [[Recording Industry Association of America|gold]] on December 30, 1971,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/><ref name="The Wrap"/> nine days after the singer turned 18. Wright struggled with a successful follow-up until 1972 when the single "Baby Sitter" (one of Wright's first compositions) reached the top 50 of the Hot 100 and peaked at number six on the R&B charts. Another hit that emerged during this early period was 1973's "Let Me Be Your Lovemaker", which peaked at number 55 on the Hot 100 and number 10 on the R&B chart, it was the first instance (after "Baby Sitter") where Wright showed off her powerful [[whistle register]] vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.soultracks.com/first-listen-betty-wright-tired|title=First Listen: Betty Wright is not feeling &quot;Tired&quot;|date=March 3, 2014|website=SoulTracks.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://internetfm.com/song-of-the-day-clean-up-woman-by-betty-wright/|title=Song Of The Day – "Clean Up Woman" by Betty Wright|website=Interneetfm.com|date=February 25, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|NwhGw_A_2MA|Betty Wright – Queen of Whistle Register?}}</ref> Another successful composition was the proto-[[disco]] number "Where Is the Love" (co-written by Wright, with producers [[Harry Wayne Casey]] and [[Richard Finch (musician)|Richard Finch]], from KC & The Sunshine Band). This peaked at number 15 on the R&B chart, number-two on the dance charts and crossed over to the UK, peaking at #25, leading Wright to perform overseas. Wright later won the Best R&B Song [[Grammy Award]] for composing "Where Is the Love".<ref name="AMG"/>

A second prominent overseas hit was another [[Proto-disco#History|proto-disco]] number "Shoorah! Shoorah!", issued on [[Alston Records|Alston]] and written by [[Allen Toussaint]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/3711|title=Betty Wright – Shoorah! Shoorah!|website=45cat.com|access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref> Both songs appeared on one of Wright's most popular albums, ''Danger!

The original version peaked at number 28 on the R&B chart. Four years later, Wright released a "live" version of the song. The remodeled version, which included a now-famous monologue and portions of Wright's 1970 hit "Pure Love", peaked at number 11 on the R&B chart in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/betty-wright/chart-history/BSI/song/897226|title=Tonight Is The Night (Pts. 1 & 2) Chart History|website=Billboard.com|access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref>

In 1977, Wright discovered musician [[Peter Brown (singer)|Peter Brown]] and sang background on Brown's hits "You Should Do It" and "Dance with Me" (where her vocals were prominently featured alongside Brown's) from the successful LP ''[[A Fantasy Love Affair]]''. In 1978, she performed a duet with [[shock rock]]er [[Alice Cooper]] on the song "No Tricks", and a year later, opened for [[Bob Marley]] on the reggae star's ''[[Survival Tour]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bobmarley.com/marley70-blog-series/the-gong-in-gabon-1980/|title=The Gong in Gabon, 1980 — BobMarley.com (History)|work=Bob Marley|access-date=July 2, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702233222/http://www.bobmarley.com/marley70-blog-series/the-gong-in-gabon-1980/|archive-date=July 2, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===1980s and 1990s===
Wright's other albums at the end of the 1970s were less successful, and by 1981, as TK began to struggle, she moved to a bigger label, signing with [[Epic Records|Epic]], where her self-titled album was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/betty-wright-mw0000848421|title=Betty Wright – Betty Wright – Songs, Reviews, Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref> The album was notable for the minor [[Stevie Wonder]]-composed hit, "What Are You Gonna Do with It".

In 1983, she released the album ''Wright Back at You'', which featured compositions by [[Marlon Jackson]] of the Jacksons. In 1985, Wright formed her own label, Miss B Records, issuing the album ''Sevens'' the following year.<ref name="balleralert"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sevens-mw0000198002|title=Sevens – Betty Wright &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> In 1988, Wright made history as the first black female artist to score a gold album on her own label, when her 1987 album, ''Mother Wit'' achieved that certification.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2020-05-10/soul-singer-betty-wright-dies-at-66|title=Soul singer Betty Wright dies at 66|date=May 10, 2020|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/16/cult-heroes-betty-wright-soul-golden-agony-aunt|title=Cult heroes: Betty Wright – soul's golden agony aunt|first=Maddy|last=Costa|date=February 16, 2016|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> The album was notable for the come-back hits "No Pain, No Gain," which returned her to the top 20 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]] for the first time in a decade, and "After the Pain".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/betty-wright/chart-history/BSI/song/368854|title=Betty Wright|website=Billboard.com|access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref>
