{{Other uses|Omerta (disambiguation)}}

'''Omertà''' ({{IPAc-en||oʊ|ˈ|m|ɛər|t|ə}}, {{IPA-it|omerˈta}}){{efn|The [[grave accent]] in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Corsican language|Corsican]] indicates that the final {{angbr|a}} is [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]]. In [[English language|English]], it is often spelled ''omerta'', without an accent, and pronounced with misplaced stress as {{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|m|ɛər|t|ə}} rather than {{IPA-it|omerˈta|}}.}} is a [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] [[code of silence]] and code of [[honor]] and [[code of conduct|conduct]] that places importance on silence in the face of questioning by authorities or outsiders; non-cooperation with authorities, the government, or outsiders, especially during criminal investigations; and willfully ignoring and generally avoiding interference with the illegal activities of others (i.e., not contacting law enforcement or the authorities when one is aware of, witness to, or even the victim of certain crimes). It originated and remains common in [[Southern Italy]], where [[Brigandage in Southern Italy|banditry or brigandage]] and [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]]-type criminal organizations (like the [[Camorra]], [[Cosa Nostra]], [['Ndrangheta]], [[Sacra Corona Unita]] and [[Società foggiana]]) have long been strong. Similar codes are also deeply rooted in other areas of the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], including rural Spain, [[Crete]] in Greece,<ref>{{cite book|last=Michael |first=Herzfeld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rE9qHQwTCUoC |title=The Body Impolitic: Artisans and Artifice in the Global Hierarchy of Value|publisher= Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press|year= 2004| isbn= 0-226-32913-5}}</ref> and [[Corsica]], all of which share a common or similar historic culture with Southern Italy.

In addition to Southern and other parts of Italy, the code of ''omertà'' also exists, to a lesser extent, in the United States in some [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] neighborhoods, such as [[Little Italy]], especially in neighborhoods where the [[American Mafia|Italian-American Mafia]] has strong influence, and in Italian [[ethnic enclave]]s in countries [[Italians in Germany|such as Germany]], [[Italian Canadians|Canada]], and [[Italian Australians|Australia]], where there is [[Organized crime in Italy#Italian criminal groups in other countries|Italian organized crime]]. Similar codes of silence have been observed in [[American Jews|Jewish-American]], [[Greek Americans|Greek-American]], [[Albanian-American]], [[Russian Americans|Russian-American]], [[Chinese Americans|Chinese-American]], [[African Americans|African-American]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic-American]], [[Armenian Americans|Armenian-American]], and [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]] neighborhoods, and amongst some [[Outlaw motorcycle club|bikers]]. Retaliation against [[Informant|informers]] is common in criminal circles, where they are often described by terms such as "rats" or "snitches".

==Code==
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the phonology of the word indicates that it is not of Sicilian origin; it may derive from the now rare Spanish word {{lang|es|hombredad}}, meaning ''manliness'', after the Sicilian word ''omu'' "man".<ref name=oed>{{Cite OED|omertà|id=131199}}</ref> It has also been suggested that the word comes from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|humilitas}} (humility), which became ''umiltà'' and then finally ''omertà'' in some southern [[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]; this suggestion is not well supported by the geographical distribution of the word.<ref name=oed/> The first Antimafia Commission of the Italian parliament in the 1970s accepted the origin based on ''omu'' on the authority of Antonio Cutrera, with no reference to Spanish<ref>[http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer/BGT/907857.pdf Relazione conclusiva, Commissione parlamentare d’inchiesta sul fenomeno della mafia in Sicilia], Rome 1976, p. 106</ref>

The basic principle of ''omertà'' is that one must not seek aid from legally constituted authorities to settle personal grievances. The suspicion of being a {{lang|it|cascittuni}} (an informant) constitutes the blackest mark against manhood, according to Cutrera. A person who has been wronged is obligated to look out for their own interests by avenging the wrong themself, or finding a patron—not the state—to avenge them.<ref name=nelli13/>

Omertà implies "the categorical prohibition of cooperation with state authorities or reliance on its services, even when one has been victim of a crime."<ref name=paoli109>Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 109</ref> A person should absolutely avoid interfering in the business of others and should not inform the authorities of a crime under any circumstances, but if it is justified, he may personally avenge a physical attack on himself or on his family by [[Feud#Blood feuds/vendetta|vendetta]], literally a taking of revenge, a feud. Even if somebody is convicted of a crime that he has not committed, he is supposed to serve the sentence rather than give the police information about the real criminal, even if the criminal has nothing to do with the Mafia. Within Mafia culture, breaking ''omertà'' is punishable by death.<ref name=paoli109/>

''Omertà'' is an extreme form of loyalty and solidarity in the face of authority. One of its absolute tenets is that it is deeply demeaning and shameful to betray even one's deadliest enemy to the authorities. For that reason, many Mafia-related crimes go unsolved. Observers of the Mafia debate whether omertà should best be understood as an expression of social consensus for the Mafia or whether it is instead a pragmatic response based primarily on fear, as implied by a popular Sicilian [[proverb]]: ''"Cu è surdu, orbu e taci, campa cent'anni 'mpaci"'' ("He who is deaf, blind and silent will live a hundred years in peace").

It has also been described as follows: "Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward. Whoever cannot take care of himself without police protection is both. It is as cowardly to betray an offender to justice, even though his offences be against yourself, as it is not to avenge an injury by violence. It is dastardly and contemptible in a wounded man to betray the name of his assailant, because if he recovers, he must naturally expect to take vengeance himself."<ref>[http://www.americanmafia.com/What_Is_The_Mafia.html Porello, ''The Rise and Fall of the Cleveland Mafia'', p. 23];</ref>

==History==
Omertà is a code of silence, according to one of the first Mafia researchers Antonio Cutrera, a former officer of public security. It seals lips of men even in their own defense and even when the accused is innocent of charged crimes. Cutrera quoted a native saying which was first uttered (as goes the legend) by a wounded man to his assailant: "If I live, I'll kill you. If I die, I forgive you."<ref name=nelli13>{{in lang|it}} Antonio Cutrera, ''La mafia e i mafiosi'', Reber, Palermo: 1900, p. 27 (reprinted by Arnaldo Forni Editore, Sala Bolognese 1984, {{ISBN|88-271-2487-X}}), quoted in Nelli, ''The Business of Crime'', pp. 13–14</ref>

Sicilians adopted the code long before the emergence of [[Cosa Nostra]], and it may have been heavily influenced by centuries of state oppression and foreign domination. It has been observed at least as far back as the 16th century as a way of opposing Spanish rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knowital.com/|title=Know Italy Travel Guide & Places to Go |publisher=Knowital}}</ref>

The Italian-American mafioso [[Joseph Valachi]] famously broke the ''omertà'' code in 1963, when he publicly spoke out about the existence of the Mafia and testified before a [[United States Senate]] committee. He became the first in the modern history of the [[American Mafia|Italian-American Mafia]] to break his [[Initiation ritual (mafia)|blood oath]].<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875227,00.html Killers in Prison] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120709070735/http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875227,00.html |date=2012-07-09 }}, Time, October 4, 1963</ref><ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873080,00.html "The Smell of It"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120709172001/http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873080,00.html |date=2012-07-09 }}, Time, October 11, 1963</ref> In Sicily, the phenomenon of ''[[pentito]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] ''he who has repented'') broke omertà.

Among the most famous Mafia ''pentiti'' is [[Tommaso Buscetta]], the first important witness in Italy, who both helped prosecutor [[Giovanni Falcone]] to understand the inner workings of [[Cosa Nostra]] and described the [[Sicilian Mafia Commission]] or ''Cupola'', the [[leadership]] of the Sicilian Mafia. A predecessor, [[Leonardo Vitale]], who gave himself up to the [[police]] in 1973, was judged [[mental disorder|mentally ill]] and so his testimony led to the conviction of only himself and his uncle.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Suro|first=Roberto|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/magazine/sicily-and-the-mafia.html|title=Sicily and the Mafia|date=1986-05-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==In sport==

Omertà is widely reported in sport in relation to use of prohibited substances by athletes. The Cycling Independent Reform Commission report of 2015 contains the word "omerta" no fewer than 17 times, and stated:

{{quote|A former directeur sportif described omerta as a system in which riders were open among themselves about doping, and omerta operated externally so doping was not spoken about in public.

An academic paper highlighted that those who broke the code of silence within cycling were ostracised and sometimes pushed out of the sport because they were not willing to support or join in with doping. Any rider who did speak out about doping could find himself informally sanctioned by the rest of the peloton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://s27394.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CIRC-Report-2015.pdf|title=Cycling Independent Reform Commission – Report to the President of the Union Cycliste Internationale |pages= 25–26|access-date=2019-04-22 }}</ref>}}

==In popular culture==

[[Mario Puzo]] wrote novels based on the principles of omertà and the Cosa Nostra. His best known works in that vein are the trilogy ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', ''[[The Sicilian]]'', and ''[[Omertà (novel)|Omertà]]''.<ref name=WorldCat>{{cite book|last=Puzo|first=Mario|title=Omerta|oclc=1031631136|isbn= 978-0375502545|publisher=New York: Random House|series=Mario Puzo's Mafia|year=2000|author-link=Mario Puzo}}</ref>
The videogame [[Fallout: New Vegas]] features a tribe of gangsters called the Omertas. The 2002 videogame [[Mafia (video game)|Mafia]] names its campaign's 10th chapter Omerta. The American heavy metal band [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] released the song Omerta from their third studio album, [[Ashes of the Wake]], which begins with lead singer [[Randy Blythe]] performing a spoken word description of omertà.
Drake released a song under the same name "Omertà" in 2019. The song was written by Aubrey Graham / M. Samuels / O. Yildirim / D. Patrzek / E. Getachew. <ref> Musixmatch</ref> <ref>Nakuti chronicles</ref>
