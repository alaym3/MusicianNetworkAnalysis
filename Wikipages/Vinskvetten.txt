'''Vinskvetten''' (previously known as '''Salhus Vinskvetten''') is a Norwegian music and comedy troupe.

== History ==

The group was formed in 1975 as part of a local comedy revue (Nornarevyen (Salhus Revy og Teater)), and has ever since been based in [[Salhus, Hordaland|Salhus]], north of [[Bergen]] in [[Norway]]. The group's name is a [[parody]] of another well known band from the same area, [[Salhuskvintetten]]. They first gained national fame in 1983, when they made the TV program ''Livet i Rothålå'' (Life in ''Rothålå''), a mockumentary about the fictional town of Rothålå. This production would stay with both the band and its fans for the remainder of their career, and the band often use the town and its inhabitants as basis for their songs. In the late 1980s the band began recording their material, and their first two albums, released in 1988 and 1991, both went gold in Norway. They would go on to record seven albums, the last one in 2005. In 2008, the group announced their farewell tour, which played to sold-out crowds in Bergen during fall 2008 and winter 2009. The show was released on a DVD soon after, along with over two hours of bonus material from 1981 to 2007. The group subsequently retired.

Vinskvetten sings in a typical Northern [[Hordaland]] dialect referred to as "stril", which is local slang for a person from the outskirts of Bergen and their dialect, and they also use many "old" [[Nynorsk]] words and expressions in their lyrics.
