In 1997, UK singer Gabrielle released her version of "Walk On By" as the fifth and final single from her album. It reached number seven in the UK.

===1999–2001: ''Rise'' and ''Greatest Hits''===
Gabrielle began recording her third studio album ''Rise'' in 1998 through 1999. ''Rise'' was released on 18 October 1999 in the United Kingdom, and 15 August 2000 in the United States. The album became Gabrielle's biggest selling album to date with it becoming her only number one album. The album became a huge commercial success, spending three weeks at number one in the [[UK Albums Chart]], and achieving 4x Platinum status. "Sunshine" was the album's first single and peaked at number nine in the UK giving her her sixth UK top ten hit. "[[Rise (Gabrielle song)|Rise]]" was released as the album's second single. It was her second number one single in the UK (and thus far, last). Written by Gabrielle, Ollie Dagois, Ferdy Unger-Hamilton and [[Bob Dylan]], and produced by Johnny Dollar, the song used a [[sampling (music)|sample]] from [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]". The song reached number one on the [[UK singles chart]] for two weeks in January 2000. The song has sold 460,000 copies in the UK as stated by the Official UK Charts Company making the song one of the 14th best selling of 2000 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The album of the same name also reached the top spot in the [[UK Albums Chart]], where it stayed for three weeks.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> It spent 87 weeks in the charts.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>
"When a Woman" was released as the third single from ''Rise'' in June 2000. The song reached number six on the UK Singles Chart and was the second-highest charting single from the album. It became Gabrielle's eighth top ten hit. "Should I Stay" was released as a single in 2000 and was the fourth and final single released from the ''[[Rise (Gabrielle album)|Rise]]'' album. The song charted at 13 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], the fourth top 15 hit from the album. The video for the single is very moody and depicts the atmosphere of the song more so than having a linear storyline. The song samples part of the [[BBC News]] theme. In 2004, it was used in the second episode of the [[BBC]] drama serial ''[[Blackpool (TV serial)|Blackpool]]''.

Gabrielle released her first [[greatest hits]] collection on 12 November 2001, entitled ''[[Dreams Can Come True, Greatest Hits Vol. 1]]''. The album achieved success in the UK where it was certified as a four times [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] seller and became the fifth best selling album of 2001.{{Citation needed|date= November 2011}} It was also the 76th biggest selling album of that Decade in the UK.

Gabrielle reteamed with frequent collaborators Jonathan Shorten and trio [[Julian Gallagher]], [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Richard Stannard]], and Ferdy Unger-Hamilton to work on her fourth studio album ''[[Play to Win (Gabrielle album)|Play to Win]]''. Released in May 2004, it reached number ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was eventually certified silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI). Elsewehere however, the album failed to chart noticeably.

Second and final single "Ten Years Time" missed the top 40. In support of the album, a UK [[concert tour]] followed.

==Artistry==
Gabrielle's first two studio albums were inspired by "classic soul connotations" such as [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Barry White]] and [[Bobby Womack]]. However, the albums also contained influence "by early-'80s British pop" [[Soul II Soul]], [[Lisa Stansfield]] and [[Mantronix]]. Gabrielle's third album Rise spoke of "optimism, romanticism, devotion, and a keen survival instinct".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/lyrics/gabrielle/biography/ |title=the biography of Gabrielle – singer life story |publisher=Poemhunter.com |date=14 December 2007 |access-date=27 December 2012}}</ref> "Play to Win" incorporated a mix of genres. Gabrielle spoke on the album's influences saying "There's also a couple of songs which lean more to Country, so there will be a couple of surprises for them." She also talks about the genres on the album, saying, "There's nothing wrong with Country. Yeah, I'm a black woman, but I'd like to think that I can just sing 'songs'. This album is diverse but people buying my music can expect diverse music; it's about love, life and optimism."<ref name="thesituation1">{{cite web |url=http://www.thesituation.co.uk/ukartists/gabrielle/gabrielle.html |title=Gabrielle |publisher=Thesituation.co.uk |access-date=27 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822004724/http://www.thesituation.co.uk/ukartists/gabrielle/gabrielle.html |archive-date=22 August 2011 }}</ref>

Gabrielle cited her high school teacher as one influence, saying that she was "inspired the moment her teacher asked her to construct her first poem. Her poetry began to develop into songs, and then she began to sing." Other inspirations came through in an eclectic collection of 1980s pop. "[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Culture Club]], [[Haircut One Hundred]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Adam and the Ants]] and [[Wham!]]. "You know, it was all pop, and at the same time I was a huge [[Michael Jackson]] fan, so I had a big picture of him, you know, when he looked really beautiful, and he was dark chocolate and you just wanted to lick him, although they were innocent thoughts those days, when I was younger."<ref name="thesituation1"/>

==Personal life==
Gabrielle has two children, a son, Jordan (born 1995), and a daughter, Patricia (born 2003).<ref>York Membery, [https://www.driving.co.uk/news/interview/motor-gabrielle-musician/ "Me and my motor: Gabrielle, musician"], Driving, ''The Sunday Times'', 1 February 2019.</ref>
