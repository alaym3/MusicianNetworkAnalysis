'''Anita White''' (born July 18, 1958),<ref name="rollingstone-1013919"/><!-- "61-year old" on June 12, 2020; "her birthday on July 18th"--> known professionally as '''Lady A''', is an American singer of blues, soul, funk, and gospel music.

==Career==
Born and raised in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], she began singing at age 5 with her musical family, and her performance career began in the 1980s as a backup vocalist in a Motown cover band.<ref name="Tacoma Weekly">{{cite news | newspaper=Tacoma Weekly News | page=26 | date=July 13, 2018 | title='Blues On!'

=== Name conflict ===
On June 12, 2020, amid the [[George Floyd protests]], the pop country music group [[Lady Antebellum]] shortened its name to its nickname "Lady A"<ref name="Drop RS">{{cite news | title=Lady A Drop 'Antebellum' From Their Name | first=Jon | last=Freeman | date=June 11, 2020 | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/lady-antebellum-change-name-1013602/ | access-date=June 14, 2020 | quote=move forward as Lady A, the nickname our fans gave us almost from the start}}</ref> in an attempt to blunt the name's association to the [[Antebellum South]], including the glorification of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The next day, it was widely reported that the name had already been in use for more than 20 years by Anita White. The band members publicly admitted ignorance of any prior use, both when they had arbitrarily chosen the first name and again with this one, which White called "[[social privilege|pure privilege]]". As reported by ''[[American Songwriter]]''<ref name="The Original"/> and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', White described the band's token acknowledgement of racism while blithely appropriating an African American artist's name: "They're using the name because of a Black Lives Matter incident that, for them, is just a moment in time. If it mattered, it would have mattered to them before. It shouldn't have taken George Floyd to die for them to realize that their name had a slave reference to it. It's an opportunity for them to pretend they're not racist". A veteran music industry lawyer observed that such name clashes are uncommon due to the existence of the Internet.<ref name="rollingstone-1013919">{{Cite web|title=Lady Antebellum Is Now 'Lady A.'

The band members contacted White the next week to apologize for inadvertently appropriating her name without any research, saying that the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement had inspired them to a collaborative attitude. However, they also expressed their intention to move forward with the Lady A name despite White's concern that simultaneous ownership of the trademark would be detrimental to her career.<ref name="Bury"/><ref name="Apologizing"/> Initially enthusiastic, forgiving, and hopeful,<ref name="ST name">{{cite news | newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] | first=Chris | last=Talbott | date=June 15, 2020 | title=Seattle singer Lady A says she and Lady Antebellum, which adopted her stage name, working toward positive outcome | url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/seattle-blues-singer-lady-a-talking-with-country-group-lady-a/ | access-date=July 8, 2020}}</ref> she said "We talked about attempting to co-exist but didn't discuss what that would look like"<ref name="Apologizing">{{cite web | work=[[USA Today]] | date=June 16, 2020 | first=Hannah | last=Yasharoff | title=Former Lady Antebellum will continue going by Lady A after apologizing to singer with the same name | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/06/16/lady-antebellum-name-change-blues-singer-band-connect-lady-dispute/3197200001/ | access-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref> reportedly because the band members would not directly respond to that explicit question three times during the conversation or in two contract drafts.<ref name="Bury">{{cite web | title=Seattle's Lady A to Lady Antebellum, 'We can't both be Lady A, you'll bury me' | author=Staff | date=July 11, 2020 | url=https://komonews.com/news/local/seattles-lady-a-to-lady-antebellum-we-cant-both-be-lady-a-youll-bury-me | work=KomoNews | access-date=July 13, 2020}}</ref> Shocked upon receipt of the band's contract draft later that day, she said "Their camp is trying to erase me ... and I no longer trust them".<ref name="Pitchfork Sue"/> She soon submitted a counteroffer that either the band would be renamed, or that her act would be renamed for a $5 million fee plus a $5 million donation to be split between Seattle charities, a nationwide legal defense fund for independent artists, and Black Lives Matter.<ref name="Should Not">{{cite interview | title=Blues Singer Lady A: ‘I Should Not Have to Bend to Band’s Will Because They’ve Got Money’ | first=Anita | last=White | interviewer=Ethan Millman | date=July 10, 2020 | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/lady-a-lawsuit-interview-1026047/ | accessdate=November 18, 2020}}</ref><ref name="What is Case">{{cite news | title=What Is Lady A's Case Against the Other Lady A? | first=Amy X. | last=Wang | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=July 13, 2020 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/lady-a-lady-antebellum-lawsuit-case-1026653/ | access-date=November 18, 2020}}</ref>

On July 8, 2020, the band filed a lawsuit against White{{mdash}}rejecting her counteroffer, and affirming the band's right to its own long-standing trademark of the name. The band stated: "Today we are sad to share that our sincere hope to join together with Anita White in unity and common purpose has ended."<ref name="Pitchfork Sue">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/lady-a-formerly-lady-antebellum-sue-seattle-blues-singer-lady-a/|title=Lady A, Formerly Lady Antebellum, Sue Seattle Blues Singer Lady A|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Torres|first=Eric|date=July 8, 2020|access-date=July 8, 2020}}</ref>

On September 15, 2020, White filed a countersuit asserting her claim to the Lady A trademark under common law and rejecting the notion that both artists could operate in the same industry under the same brand identity. She is seeking damages for lost sales and a weakened brand, along with royalties from any income the band receives under the Lady A moniker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/blues-singer-lady-a-sues-the-former-lady-antebellum/|title=Blues Singer Lady A Sues the Former Lady Antebellum|first=Allison|last=Hussey|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=12 November 2020}}</ref><ref name="seattletimes-2020-09">{{cite news |last1=Rietmulder |first1=Michael |title=Seattle's Anita 'Lady A' White files lawsuit to block country stars' use of name |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/seattles-anita-lady-a-white-files-lawsuit-to-block-country-stars-use-of-name/ |access-date=16 September 2020 |work=The Seattle Times |date=15 September 2020}}</ref>

The effects of this dispute between the two musical acts has also gone beyond just Anita White's solo career. In late October 2021, New Orleans based folk and Americana musician [[Lilli Lewis]] released her aptly named album, "Americana." Prior to the album's release, Lewis had joined an online support group for Black female artists known as "Sista Gurls"—a group of which Lady A (Anita White) is also a member. The two artists connected through this support group and eventually recorded a song together titled "A Healing Inside." This song became the tenth track on Lewis' album with White having been credited under her professional stage name "Lady A." Soon after its release, the album was pulled from [[Spotify]]—a very prominent music streaming service—due to "Lady A" being credited on the album. While it is unknown whether this was due to Spotify's algorithm flagging the content, believing the artists formerly known as Lady Antebellum were being falsely credited, or if it was taken down due to the legal disputes between the two musical acts, it is clear that the conflict between the artists using the "Lady A" moniker is at its root. The album was later returned to the streaming service on November 15, 2021, a little over two weeks after the album's release and within one week after Lewis became aware of the situation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=writer|first=KEITH SPERA {{!}} Staff|title=Lady A controversy got New Orleans songwriter Lilli Lewis' 'Americana' deleted from Spotify|url=https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/keith_spera/article_fa41d56a-471c-11ec-9f06-cf06a3b0b67d.html|access-date=2021-11-21|website=NOLA.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Brooks|first=Jesse|title=Why was NOLA songwriter Lilli Lewis’s album pulled off of Spotify for 3 days?|url=https://www.fox8live.com/2021/11/17/why-was-nola-songwriter-lilli-lewiss-album-pulled-off-spotify-3-days/|access-date=2021-11-21|website=www.fox8live.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Reception==
In 2016, Rick J. Bowen for ''Innocent Words'' magazine reviewed ''Loved, Blessed and Blues'' (2016), calling Lady A "one of the hardest working women of the Northwest music community" and the album "a reflection of the ten songs and Lady A’s philosophy on life, as she reflects and testifies to being blessed and loved and to the power of the blues" in which she delivers "an altar call with her full-throated alto leading the choir of voices lifted to the heavens".<ref name="Innocent">{{cite magazine | magazine=Innocent Words | title=Lady A: Loved, Blessed and Blues (Self-Released) | date=August 2016 | first=Rick J. | last=Bowen | url=http://innocentwords.com/issue-110-august-2016/ | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406075310/http://innocentwords.com/issue-110-august-2016/ | archive-date=April 6, 2017 | others=[https://ladyababyblues.com/cd-reviews-2018 Article text] | access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref> She is the cover feature of the January 2018 issue of ''[[Jefferson Blues Magazine]]''.<ref name="Lady A Jeff">{{Cite magazine|date=January 2018|magazine=Jefferson Blues Magazine| title=Lady A | issue=195 | page=12 | url=https://www.jeffersonbluesmag.com/tidigare-nummer/24-tidigarenummer/1129-jefferson-195-1-2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606092820/https://www.jeffersonbluesmag.com/tidigare-nummer/24-tidigarenummer/1129-jefferson-195-1-2018|archive-date=June 6, 2018|access-date=June 14, 2020 | location=Sweden |publisher=Swedish Blues Association}}</ref> In 2018, John Mitchell with ''Blues Blast Magazine'' reviewed ''Doin’ Fine'' (2018), saying Lady A has a strong, Southern sounding voice which "delivers all these kinds of songs well" with his favorite being the "bright soulful" piece "Next Time U C Me". He remarked that Lady A plus the backing vocalists sometimes sound like a full choir, with a mixture of gospel and secular lyrics.<ref name="Blast">{{cite magazine | magazine=Blues Blast Magazine | title=Lady A – Doin' Fine: Album Review
