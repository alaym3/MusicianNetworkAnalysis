'''Scorpions''' are a German [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1965 in [[Hanover]] by [[Rudolf Schenker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-scorpions.com/english/history.asp |title=Scorpions Band-History |publisher=The-scorpions.com |access-date=20 October 2011}}</ref> Since the band's inception, its musical style has ranged from [[hard rock]],<ref name="Strong" /><ref name="Dodd" /> [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name="Christe" /><ref name="Walser" /> [[glam metal]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/wtf/top_10_best_hair_metal_bands.html|title=Top 10 Best Hair Metal Bands|website=www.ultimate-guitar.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2010/01/german_hair_metalles_scorpions.html|title=German Hair Metallers Scorpions to Call it Quits|last=Raymond|first=Adam K.|website=Vulture|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Keating|first=Joshua|date=2020-05-18|title=Was This Hit Power Ballad Written by the CIA?|url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/05/wind-of-change-podcast-review-scorpions-song-cia.html|access-date=2020-12-09|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|quote=The hair-metal stalwarts...}}</ref> and [[soft rock]].<ref name="Christe" /><ref name="Walser" /> The lineup from 1978 to 1992 was the most successful incarnation of the group, and included [[Klaus Meine]] (vocals), [[Rudolf Schenker]] (rhythm guitar), [[Matthias Jabs]] (lead guitar), [[Francis Buchholz]] (bass), and [[Herman Rarebell]] (drums). The band's only continuous member has been Schenker, although Meine has appeared on all of Scorpions' studio albums, while Jabs has been a consistent member since 1978, and bassist [[Paweł Mąciwoda]] and drummer [[Mikkey Dee]] have been in the band since 2003 and 2016 respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Scorpions/15424|title=Scorpions|publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Metallum]]}}</ref>

During the mid-1970s, with guitarist [[Uli Jon Roth]] (who replaced Schenker's younger brother [[Michael Schenker|Michael]]) part of the line-up, the music of the Scorpions was defined as [[hard rock]].<ref name="Strong" /><ref name="Dodd" /> After Roth's departure in 1978, Schenker and Meine managed to take control of the group, giving them almost all the power to compose music and write lyrics. [[Matthias Jabs]] joined in 1978, and with the melodic rock he played and the influence of producer [[Dieter Dierks]] in the band, the Scorpions changed their sound to melodic heavy metal mixed with lyrical "[[Sentimental ballad|power rock ballads]]", which is evident in the album ''[[Lovedrive]]'' (1979), which began the evolution of the band's sound, developed later in several of their albums. Over the next decade, the band achieved influence, approval from music critics, and significant commercial success with the albums ''[[Animal Magnetism (Scorpions album)|Animal Magnetism]]'' (1980), ''[[Blackout (Scorpions album)|Blackout]]'' (1982), ''[[Love at First Sting]]'' (1984), the live recording ''[[World Wide Live]]'' (1985), ''[[Savage Amusement]]'' (1988), their best-selling compilation ''[[Best of Rockers 'n' Ballads]]'' (1989), and ''[[Crazy World (Scorpions album)|Crazy World]]'' (1990), all awarded at least one platinum award in the United States.<ref>History of the group from the cover of the original edition ''[[Hurricane Rock]]'' (1990) on Connoisseur Collection. "...Scorpions climb to headline status all over the world during the '80s, with albums like 'Animal Magnetism', 'Blackout', 'Love at First Sting' reaffirming their huge appeal... With the release of the aptly-titled live album 'World Wide Live' in '85 and the studio opus 'Savage Amusement' in '88, Scorpions continued to underline their reputation as one of the world's top hard rock acts."

==History==

===Formation and early history (1965–1973)===
[[Rudolf Schenker]], the band's rhythm guitarist, launched the band in 1965. At first, the band had [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] influences and Schenker himself handled the vocals.<ref>{{cite book|quote=The first members were Joachim Kirchhoff (bass), Rudolf Schenker (guitar), Katty Vollmer (guitar) und Wolfgang Dziony (drums). The band played the songs of the British charts, mainly the songs of the [[Beatles]]|author=Blazek, Matthias|title=Das niedersächsische Bandkompendium 1963–2003 – Daten und Fakten von 100 Rockgruppen aus Niedersachsen, Celle |date=2006 |isbn=978-3-00-018947-0|page=8|url=http://www.hannover-live.com/urscorpfl.html|access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref> Things began to come together in 1970 when Schenker's younger brother [[Michael Schenker|Michael]] and vocalist [[Klaus Meine]] joined the band. With this line-up they won a music contest in 1972 and recorded two songs for a single that was never released on the CCA label, but the songs, "Action" and "I'm Going Mad" were later released on different compilation albums including ''Psychedelic Gems 2''.

In 1972, the group recorded and released their debut album ''[[Lonesome Crow]]'', with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums and re-recorded versions of their CCA songs.<ref name="Music Legends" /> During the ''Lonesome Crow'' tour, the Scorpions opened for upcoming British band [[UFO (band)|UFO]]. Near the end of the tour, guitarist [[Michael Schenker]] accepted an offer of lead guitar for UFO. [[Uli Jon Roth]], a friend of Michael's, was then introduced to the band and he helped them to finish off the tour.

The departure of Michael Schenker led to the breakup of the band. In 1973, [[Ulrich Roth|Uli Roth]], who had helped the Scorpions complete the ''Lonesome Crow'' tour, was offered the role as lead guitarist, but turned the band down, preferring instead to remain in the band Dawn Road. Rudolf Schenker eventually decided he wanted to work with Roth, but did not want to resurrect the last Scorpions lineup. He attended some of Dawn Road's rehearsals and ultimately decided to join the band, which consisted of Roth, [[Francis Buchholz]] (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards) and [[Jürgen Rosenthal]] (drums). Uli Roth and Buchholz persuaded Rudolf Schenker to invite Klaus Meine to join on vocals, which he soon did. While there were more members of Dawn Road than Scorpions in the band, they decided to use the Scorpions name because it was well known in the German hard rock scene and an album had been released under that name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ulijonroth.com/sky/bands_concepts/scorpions_2.htm |title=Official ULI JON ROTH Website |publisher=Ulijonroth.com |access-date=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410083007/http://www.ulijonroth.com/sky/bands_concepts/scorpions_2.htm |archive-date=10 April 2008 }}</ref>

===Rise to fame (1974–1978)===
In 1974, the new line-up released ''[[Fly to the Rainbow]]''. The album proved to be more successful than ''Lonesome Crow'' and songs such as "Speedy's Coming" and the title track established the band's sound. Achim Kirschning decided to leave after the recordings. Soon after, [[Jürgen Rosenthal]] had to leave as he was drafted into the army. In 1976, he joined German progressive rock band [[Eloy (band)|Eloy]] recording three albums. He was replaced in July 1974 by Jürgen Fechter. In 1975, Rudy Lenners from [[Belgium]] became the next drummer.

[[File:Scorpions Logo.svg|thumb|The Scorpions logo, used since 1975]]
That year, the band released ''[[In Trance]]'', which marked the beginning of their long collaboration with German producer [[Dieter Dierks]]. The album was a huge step forward for the Scorpions and established their heavy metal formula. It garnered a fan base at home and abroad with cuts such as "In Trance", "Dark Lady" and "Robot Man".

Meanwhile, as "The Hunters", the band recorded "Fuchs geh' voran" and "Wenn es richtig losgeht", German cover versions of "[[Action (Sweet song)|Action]]" and "[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]" by [[the Sweet]] for EMI's [[Electrola]] label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/germany/lower+saxony/hannover/the+hunters|title=The Hunters|website=Rockdectector.com|publisher=MusicMight|access-date=30 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415221257/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/germany/lower+saxony/hannover/the+hunters|archive-date=15 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1976, the Scorpions released ''[[Virgin Killer]]'', the album cover of which featured a [[nudity|nude]] prepubescent girl behind a broken pane of glass. The cover art was designed by Stefan Bohle, who was the product manager for [[RCA Records]],<ref name="RothRules" /> their label at the time. The cover brought the band considerable market exposure but was subsequently pulled or replaced in other countries. The album itself garnered widespread praise for its music from select critics and fan base. In 2008, the cover art on the [[English Wikipedia]] was briefly [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|blacklisted]] by the [[Internet Watch Foundation]], before reversing their decision 4 days later.

The following year, Rudy Lenners resigned for personal reasons and was replaced by [[Herman Rarebell]], an experienced musician who had recorded with the bands Missus Beastly and [[Onyx (Cornish band)|Onyx]].

For the follow-up ''[[Taken by Force]]'', RCA Records made a determined effort to promote the album in stores and on the radio. The album's single, "Steamrock Fever", was added to some of RCA's radio promotional records. Roth was not happy with the commercial direction the band was taking. Although he performed on the band's Japan tour, he departed to form his own band, [[Electric Sun]] prior to the release of the resultant double live album ''[[Tokyo Tapes (album)|Tokyo Tapes]]''. ''Tokyo Tapes'' was released in the US and Europe six months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid-1978, after auditioning around 140 guitarists, the Scorpions recruited Matthias Jabs.

===Commercial success (1978–1992)===
Following the addition of Jabs, Scorpions left RCA for [[Mercury Records]] in the United States and [[Harvest Records|Harvest]]/EMI Electrola worldwide to record their next album ''[[Lovedrive]]''. Just weeks after quitting UFO, Michael Schenker returned to the group for a short period during the recordings for the album. This gave the band three guitarists. ''[[Lovedrive]]'' was an album that some critics consider to be the pinnacle of their career.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r17523|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic review of the album|access-date= 18 May 2007|publisher=allmusic.com}}</ref> Containing such fan favourites as "Loving You Sunday Morning", "Always Somewhere", "Holiday" and the instrumental "Coast to Coast", it firmly cemented the "Scorpions formula" of hard rock songs mixed with melodic ballads. Although it had been widely believed for decades that Michael Schenker's contribution to the record was only limited to three songs, he vehemently maintained he appeared on the whole album during an interview with satellite radio host [[Eddie Trunk]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHreGTAqLZo&t=18m17s| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902021001/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHreGTAqLZo&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=2019-09-02|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com}}</ref> The album's provocative artwork was named "Best album sleeve of 1979" by [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]], yet ultimately changed for American release. ''Lovedrive'' reached No.&nbsp;55 on the US charts, demonstrating that the band was gathering an international following. After the completion and release of the album the band decided to retain Michael in the band, forcing Jabs to leave. However, in April 1979, during their tour in France, Michael quit and Jabs was brought in permanently to replace him.

In 1980, the band released ''[[Animal Magnetism (Scorpions album)|Animal Magnetism]]'', again with a provocative cover this time showing a girl kneeling and a Doberman Pinscher sitting in front of a man. ''Animal Magnetism'' contained classics such as "[[The Zoo (Scorpions song)|The Zoo]]" and "Make It Real". Soon after the album's release, Meine began experiencing throat problems. He required surgery on his vocal cords and doubts were raised{{by whom|date=February 2018}} about whether he would ever sing again.

Meanwhile, the band began working on their next album, ''[[Blackout (Scorpions album)|Blackout]]'' in 1981. [[Don Dokken]] was brought in to provide guide and backing vocals while Meine recovered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035057/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviews01/don_dokken_interview.htm|url-status=dead|title=Classic Rock Revisited your online source for Rock and Metal fans|archive-date=12 October 2007|website=Classicrockrevisited.com|access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref> Meine eventually healed completely and was able to finish the album. ''Blackout'' was released in 1982 and quickly became the band's best selling album to date, eventually going platinum. Meine's voice showed no signs of weakness and fan response to the album was good. ''Blackout'' spawned two singles: "[[No One Like You]]" and "[[Can't Live Without You (Scorpions song)|Can't Live Without You]]".

Gaining in popularity from the success of ''Blackout'', the Scorpions performed to over 375,000 fans on Day 2 at the three-day [[US Festival]] concert held in San Bernardino, California during Memorial Day Weekend of 1983. The concert was aired live on MTV, giving the band wide exposure in a live show.

The 1984 album ''[[Love at First Sting]]'' cemented the Scorpions' status as an internationally popular band. Propelled by the single "[[Rock You Like a Hurricane]]", ''Love at First Sting'' climbed the charts and went double platinum in the USA a few months after its release.

[[MTV]] gave the album's videos "Rock You Like a Hurricane", "Bad Boys Running Wild", "Big City Nights", and the [[power ballad]] "[[Still Loving You]]" significant airtime greatly contributing to the album's success. The channel even supplied Scorpions with the nickname "The Ambassadors of Rock" to the chagrin of industry insiders who recognized the executive influence behind the scenes. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named them "The Heroes of Heavy Metal".

The band toured extensively behind ''Love at First Sting'' and released their second live album, ''[[World Wide Live]]'' in 1985. Recorded over a year-long world tour and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at No.&nbsp;14 in the charts in the US and at No.&nbsp;18 in the UK.

After their extensive world tours, the band finally returned to the studio to record ''[[Savage Amusement]]''. Released in 1988, four years after their previous studio album, ''Savage Amusement'' represented a more polished and mature sound similar to the style [[Def Leppard]] had found success with. The album sold well but was considered somewhat of a critical disappointment. However, British heavy rock magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' did award the album five K's out of five.

On the ''Savage Amusement'' tour in 1988, the Scorpions became only the second Western group (not American) to play in the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] had performed in December 1987 in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. The following year the band returned to perform at the [[Moscow Music Peace Festival]]. As a result, the Scorpions developed an extended Russian fan base and still return to perform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/Scorpions-Nov2003.htm |title=Scorpions Interview with Klaus Meine |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref> Also in 1989, Scorpions released the compilation album ''[[Best of Rockers 'n' Ballads]]'', which, in addition to the band's hits from 1979 to 1988, included several rare or previously unreleased tracks: "Hey You", from the ''[[Animal Magnetism (Scorpions album)|Animal Magnetism]]'' sessions; a remixed version of "Is There Anybody There?"; and a cover of [[The Who]]'s "[[I Can't Explain]]", which was also included on that same year's ''[[Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell]]'' charity compilation album. This is the Scorpions' only compilation album to be certified platinum in the United States.<ref name="RIAA"/>

Wishing to distance themselves from the ''Savage Amusement'' style, the band separated from their long-time producer and "Sixth Scorpion", [[Dieter Dierks]], replacing him with [[Keith Olsen]] when they returned to the studio in 1990. ''[[Crazy World (Scorpions album)|Crazy World]]'' was released that year and displayed a less polished sound. The album was propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad "[[Wind of Change (Scorpions song)|Wind of Change]]". The song muses on the socio-political changes that were occurring in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world at the end of the [[Cold War]]. ''Crazy World'' is the band's last album to receive gold or platinum certification in the United States.<ref name="RIAA"/> On 21 July 1990, they joined many other guests for [[Roger Waters]]' [[The Wall Concert in Berlin|massive performance]] of ''[[The Wall]]'' in Berlin. Scorpions performed both versions of "[[In the Flesh (Pink Floyd song)|In the Flesh]]" from ''The Wall''.

After the ''[[Crazy World (Scorpions album)|Crazy World]]'' tour Francis Buchholz, the band's long-serving bassist, left the group.

===Later days (1993–2009)===
In 1993, the Scorpions released ''[[Face the Heat]]''. Bass was handled by Ralph Rieckermann. For the recording process, the band brought in producer [[Bruce Fairbairn]]. The album's sound was more metal than melodic. Neither the heavy metal single "Alien Nation" nor the ballad "Under The Same Sun" came close to matching the success of "Wind of Change". ''Face the Heat'' was a moderate success. In 1995, a new album, ''Live Bites'', was produced. The disc documented retro live performances from their Savage Amusement Tour in 1988, all the way through the Face the Heat Tour in 1994. While the album had a technologically cleaner sound in comparison to their best-selling live album, ''World Wide Live'', it was not as successful.

Prior to recording their 13th studio album, 1996's ''[[Pure Instinct]]'', drummer Herman Rarebell left the band to set up a recording label. [[Curt Cress]] took charge of the drumsticks for the album before Louisville, Kentucky-born [[James Kottak]] took over permanently. The album had many ballads. Still, the album's singles "Wild Child" and the soothing [[Rock ballad|ballad]] "[[You and I (Scorpions song)|You and I]]" both enjoyed moderate success.

1999 saw the release of ''[[Eye II Eye]]'' and a significant change in the band's style, mixing in elements of pop and techno. While the album was slickly produced, it was not received well by fans. The video to the album's first European single, "To Be No.&nbsp;1", featured a [[Monica Lewinsky]] look-alike which did little to improve its popularity.

The following year, the Scorpions had an artistic collaboration with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] that resulted in a 10-song album named ''[[Moment of Glory]]''. The album went a long way toward rebuilding the band's reputation after the harsh criticism of ''Eye II Eye''. However, critics accused them of following on the coattails of [[Metallica]]'s similar collaboration (''[[S&M (Metallica album)|S&M]]'') with the [[San Francisco Symphony]] which had been released the previous year, even though the orchestra had first approached the Scorpions with the idea in <!-- wikilinked 2 paras ago -->1995.

[[File:Scorpions (10) cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Scorpions in 2007]]
In 2001, the Scorpions released ''[[Acoustica (Scorpions album)|Acoustica]]'', a live unplugged album featuring acoustic reworkings of the band's biggest hits, plus new tracks. While appreciated by fans, the lack of a new studio album was frustrating to some, and ''Acoustica'' did little to return the band to the spotlight.

In 2004, the band released ''[[Unbreakable (Scorpions album)|Unbreakable]]'', an album that was hailed by critics as a long-awaited return to form. The album was the heaviest the band had released since ''Face the Heat''. Whether a result of poor promotion by the band's label or the long time between studio releases, ''Unbreakable'' received little airplay and did not chart. Scorpions toured extensively behind the album and played as "Special Guests" with [[Judas Priest]] during the 2005 British tour—these were the Scorpions' first dates in the UK since 1999.

In early 2006, the Scorpions released the DVD ''1 Night in Vienna'' that included 14 live tracks and a complete [[rockumentary]]. In LA, the band spent about four months in the studio with producers James Michael and [[Desmond Child]] working on a [[concept album]] titled ''[[Humanity: Hour I]]'', which was released in late May 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/60273 |title=> News > New SCORPIONS Album Title, Artwork Revealed |publisher=Bravewords.com |access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref> and was followed by the "Humanity World Tour".

In 2007, the band collaborated with two of their signature tracks in the video game series, ''Guitar Hero''. "No One Like You" was featured on the ''Rocks the '80s'' version of the game while "Rock You Like A Hurricane" was released on ''Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock''.

On 14 May 2007, the Scorpions released ''Humanity – Hour I'' in Europe. ''Humanity – Hour I'' became available in the U.S. on 28 August on [[Universal Music Group|New Door Records]], entering the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts at number No.&nbsp;63.

In a September 2007 podcast interview, Meine said the album was not so much a "concept album", but rather a collection of songs with a common theme. "We didn't want to make another record with songs about boys chasing girls. I mean, come on, give me a break," Meine said.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |title=Klaus Meine podcast interview |publisher=Stuck in the 80s |url=http://blogs.tampabay.com/80s/2007/09/scorpions-inter.html |access-date=26 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119085220/http://blogs.tampabay.com/80s/2007/09/scorpions-inter.html |archive-date=19 November 2007 }}</ref>

Asked in 2007 if the band was planning to release a ''Humanity – Hour II'', Meine replied:
{{quote|That is what everybody is asking. There might be. Who knows? Right now we are at the beginning of the world tour. It is exciting to play the new songs and they go very well with the classics. It is exciting that there is a whole new audience out there. There are many longtime fans but there are a lot of young kids. We just played in London and in Paris and there were young kids rocking out to songs that were written way before they were born. It is amazing.

On 20 December 2007, the Scorpions played at a concert for the elite of Russia's security forces in the [[Kremlin]]. The concert was a celebration of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the [[Cheka]]—predecessor of the [[KGB]]. The band claimed they thought they were performing a Christmas concert. They said their concert was by no means a tribute to the Cheka, communism, or [[Human rights in the Soviet Union|Russia's brutal past]]. Members of the audience included [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Dmitry Medvedev]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocnus.net/artman2/publish/International_3/Scorpions_Give_Spies_a_Perestroika_Ballad.shtml |title=Scorpions Give Spies a Perestroika Ballad |publisher=Ocnus.net |access-date=20 October 2011}}</ref>

Meine was asked in a July 2011 interview about the future of the Scorpions. He replied, "Our newest project comes out in the next few months. It gives you a chance to experience the Scorpions in 3D. You can actually feel the smoke string out of the guitar like it is a live show. It is an incredible experience. The DVD features our concerts in 3D in Germany. We are just about to do the mix and it should be in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia hopefully soon. Indeed, the strong 3D technology makes us feel like pioneers after all these years (he says, laughing). We have an album coming out later this year featuring classics. You know our love for them. The '60s was the era for our inspiration. Our movie/documentary also is soon to be released. We have cameras with us on tours, so this documentary is being made during our tours. It also gives you a picture of the Scorpions career and journey."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=160640|title=SCORPIONS Working On 3D Concert DVD, Documentary|publisher=BlabberMouth}}</ref>
