==Case and controversy==

===Riots at concerts===
Like many other popular musicians in Indonesia, Noah's concerts have experienced problems. On February 22, 2006, at [[Harapan Bangsa Stadium|Harapan Bangsa Lhongraya Stadium]], at least 30 spectators fainted, most being young women. The concert was also said to have violated [[Shariah law]] in [[Aceh]] because of the mixing of male and female spectators in the show field.<ref>Moch. Indra Kurniawan (23 February 2006).

Retrieved 21 January 2008.</ref>

The riots at concerts not only affected the spectators, but also members of the group performing. An example of this occurred on April 11, 2006, during a [[Peterpan (band)|Peterpan]] concert in Bima Stadium, [[Cirebon]], when rocks were thrown by the spectators who had no tickets outside of the stadium. This event caused harm to dozens of the spectators inside the stadium which prompted many of them to rush to various hospitals due to being hit by the falling stones, as well as the vocalist, Ariel, who was struck in the chest before he was secured to the outside of the stadium. As a result of the incident, the concert was stopped when the band was performing their fifth song of the night, "Mungkin Nanti", at around 20:30 WIB.<ref>Moch. Indra Kurniawan (12 April 2006).
