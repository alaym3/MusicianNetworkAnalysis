The band got their international breakthrough in 1974 with their cover of the 1968 [[B. J. Thomas]] song "[[Hooked on a Feeling]]".<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=281}}</ref> Blue Swede recorded Thomas' song in 1973, but based its rendition of the song on a 1971 version released by British pop eccentric [[Jonathan King]], which created the "ooga-chaka" introduction. Blue Swede released "Hooked on a Feeling" in Sweden in May 1973 and in the United States in February 1974. The song reached [[chart-topper|number one]] in the U.S. for one week in April 1974 and stayed in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] for 18 weeks. The track also topped charts in Australia, Canada, and the [[Netherlands]], where it reached a peak chart position of 26.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> To capitalize on the success of the song, Blue Swede released an [[Hooked on a Feeling (album)|album of the same name]] that same year.

Throughout the rest of 1974, two follow-up singles from the same album were released: "Silly Milly", which peaked at position 71 in the U.S., and a cover of [[The Association]]'s "[[Never My Love]]", which made the [[Top 40|Top Ten]] by peaking at position 7.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> From the band's 1975 follow-up album, ''Out of the Blue'', they [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a [[Medley (music)|medley]] of "[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]" by [[Deep Purple]] and "I'm Alive" by [[Tommy James and the Shondells]] (not [[The Hollies]]' song of the same name), peaking at position 61 in the U.S, and achieving its greatest chart success in [[Scandinavia]].
