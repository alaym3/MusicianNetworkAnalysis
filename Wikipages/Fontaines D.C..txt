The band got their name from a character in the movie ''[[The Godfather]]'' called Johnny Fontane, a singer and movie star portrayed by [[Al Martino]]. Fontane was godson of [[Vito Corleone]]. Originally they were called The Fontaines, but they added the initials "D.C." when a band in Los Angeles had the same name. The initials D.C. stand for "Dublin City".<ref name=Stereogum-BandsToWatch-2019>{{cite news|last1=Leas|first1=Ryan|title=Band To Watch: Fontaines D.C.|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2028289/fontaines-d-c-dublin-dogrel-interview/franchises/interview/|work=[[Stereogum]]|date=16 January 2019}}</ref>

In 2018, Fontaines released the single split "Chequeless Reckless / Boys In The Better Land" and "Too Real".<ref name=UnderscorePart3-TooReal-2019 /> ''[[Stereogum]]'', who premiered "Chequeless Reckless" in early 2018, described their sound "a synthesis between post-punk, garage rock, and a kind of gritty, urbane sense of rhythm and narrative" and naming them a Band To Watch.<ref name=Stereogum-BandsToWatch-2019 />

In May 2018, Fontaines played an in-studio at [[KEXP-FM|KEXP]] in [[Seattle]],<ref name=KEXP-FullPerformance-2018>{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=John|last2=Fontaines D.C.|title=Fontaines D.C. - Full Performance (Live on KEXP)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X453ABUQ2rM|website=[[KEXP-FM]]|language=en|format=Live in-studio|date=14 May 2018}}</ref> which provided high level exposure in the United States.<ref name=DIY-NeuPick-KEXP-2018>{{cite news|title=Neu Pick: Dublin's Fontaines D.C. prove an intoxicating live prospect with electrifying KEXP session|url=http://diymag.com/2018/07/25/fontaines-dc-kexp-session-neu-pick-watch|work=[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]|date=25 July 2018|language=en}}</ref> In November 2018, the band signed with [[Partisan Records]].<ref name=NYTimes-Feature-2019 />
