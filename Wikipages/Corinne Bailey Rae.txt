==Early life==
Bailey Rae was born in [[Leeds]], England, to a [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|Kittitian]] father and an English mother Linda, as the eldest of three daughters, including her siblings, Candice Bailey, and actress [[Rhea Bailey]], who was in ''[[Coronation Street]]''.
Bailey Rae began her musical career at school, where she studied [[classical music|classical]] [[violin]] before she turned her attention to singing: "I started off singing in church, I suppose, but people think it must have been a [[Gospel music|gospel]] church because of the whole, you know, black assumption", she said in reference to her multi-racial background... "But it wasn't gospel at all, it was just your regular [[Plymouth Brethren|Brethren]] church, very middle-class, where we would sing these harmonies every Sunday. It was always my favorite part of the service, the singing."<ref name="official biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.corinnebaileyrae.net/|title=The official Corinne Bailey Rae site|access-date=9 March 2006}}</ref> Bailey Rae later transferred to a [[Baptist]] church, where the youth leader coached rock bands in the local high school. The church's young people wrote their own worship songs and sang covers of songs by [[Primal Scream]]. "We changed the words though," Bailey Rae states on her website. "We didn't want to offend the regular churchgoers."<ref name="official biography"/> She recorded two albums with the youth group under the name of Revive.<ref name="proost">{{cite web|url=http://www.proost.co.uk |title=Albums available here |access-date=22 January 2010 }}</ref> Performing in church broadened Bailey Rae's musical horizons, and her love for making music was solidified after the church youth leader offered to lend her the money for her first guitar. In her mid-teens, she was highly influenced by [[Lenny Kravitz]], also discovering rock legends [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. "I loved that band during my teens; I wanted, somehow, to follow in their footsteps, and to create music of my own."<ref name="official biography"/>

==Personal life==
Corinne Bailey studied [[English literature|English language and literature]] at the [[University of Leeds]] where she graduated in 2000.

==Music career==

===1998–2003: Beginnings===
{{BLP sources section|date=October 2016}}
Bailey Rae formed an [[indie (music)|indie]] group called Helen, which was inspired by similar acts such as [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]] and [[L7 (band)|L7]]. "It was the first time I'd seen women with guitars. They were kinda sexy—but [[feminism|feminist]]. I wanted to be like that, at the front of something."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1639148,00.html |title=I was speechless, just squeaking! |access-date=9 March 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 November 2005 | location=London | first=Dave | last=Simpson}}</ref> The group played many gigs around Leeds and, whilst unable to attract offers from any UK labels, were eventually approached by US-based [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] record label [[Roadrunner Records]], home to acts such as [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], in 1998. This deal disappeared before it was even signed, however, after the bassist became pregnant and the group disbanded. "[Was I] Disappointed? I was gutted! I had no idea what to do next."

In the three years after she married her first husband, Bailey Rae began working on solo material—this time steering away from her indie past and embarking on a more "soulful" path. She collaborated with Leeds-based [[funk]] group [[the New Mastersounds]] on the track "Your Love Is Mine", featured on their 2003 album ''Be Yourself'', released via One Note Records. The following year she again worked with another Leeds-based group, Home cut Directive, on the song "Come the Revolution", which was the first single from the group's debut album.
