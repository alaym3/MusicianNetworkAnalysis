==History==

===Formation and early years (1985–2001)===
Bowling for Soup has its origins in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], where Jaret Reddick and other members of the band grew up. Reddick and original drummer Lance Morrill met in the fall of 1976, then reconnected in kindergarten in the fall of 1977. Reddick began playing music in 1985, at 13 years old. Reddick and guitarist Chris Burney knew each other in high school (they met in 1986) and as students in the 1980s, they grew up on the commercially successful heavy metal music of bands such as [[Quiet Riot]], [[Ratt|RATT]], and [[Mötley Crüe]], but were also influenced by the faster punk rock of the [[Ramones]] and later [[Green Day]]. Burney's family owned a Wichita Falls coffeehouse called "The Refuge" with a music stage and he played there with his first band the Persecuted, where he and Reddick met bassist Erik Chandler and drummer Gary Wiseman in the early 1990s (although Wiseman did not join the band until 1998).

Burney and Chandler soon formed the Folkadots, while Wiseman formed Gary & the Wiseman. Burney and Chandler, along with Morrill, also formed the band Slaw. Around this time, Reddick formed the band Terminal Seasons. Not too long after, Reddick and Morrill formed coolfork! which Burney later joined. The band was in full swing by 1993, playing such venues as the Refuge. A few months later, after forming a band called Rubberneck, the group changed their name to Bowling for Soup, which was derived from a comedy act by [[Steve Martin]],<ref>[http://www.bowlingforsoup.com/bio.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222022118/http://www.bowlingforsoup.com/bio.html |date=December 22, 2008 }}</ref> and the band was officially formed in Wichita Falls on June 4, 1994, by Reddick (lead vocals, guitar), Burney (guitar, backing vocals), Chandler (bass, backing vocals, acoustic guitar), and Morrill (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Morrill left the band on good terms and was replaced in July 1998 by Wiseman.

In 1996, Bowling for Soup relocated to [[Denton, Texas]] and in 1998 recorded their second studio album, third overall, ''[[Rock on Honorable Ones!!]]'' for Denton music label FFROE. The group released its first EP, ''[[Tell Me When to Whoa]]'', through FFROE later that year. The album sold over 10,000 copies, prompting [[Jive Records]] to sign the band. As a side project, beginning around 1999 until May 2018, Reddick and Chandler performed acoustic shows at smaller venues and showcases, playing primarily Bowling for Soup songs in an acoustic fashion, billed as Jaret & Erik. Beginning in September 2017, Reddick began performing solo acoustic shows, starting with the Heartache & Hilarity tour in the UK.

''[[Let's Do It for Johnny!|Let's Do It for Johnny!!]]'', Bowling for Soup's major label debut, was released on [[Jive Records|Jive]] in 2000. The album mostly contained re-recordings of the group's previous material along with a few new tracks and a cover of [[Bryan Adams]]' song "[[Summer of '69]]".<ref>[http://www.virginradio.co.uk/music/artists/bowling_for_soup/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013202928/http://www.virginradio.co.uk/music/artists/bowling_for_soup/ |date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref>

===''Drunk Enough to Dance'' and ''A Hangover You Don't Deserve'' (2002–2004)===
''[[Drunk Enough to Dance]]'' is Bowling for Soup's second album with Jive Records, released August 6, 2002. It was recorded at Tree Sound Studios and Sonica Recording in Atlanta and Big Time Audio in [[Dallas]]. One of the album's two singles, "Girl All The Bad Guys Want" (the other single was "[[Emily (Bowling for Soup song)|Emily]]"), was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the "Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal" category. Reddick considers the Grammies one of his shining moments, not for the nomination, but for winning "worst dressed" in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.{{Citation needed |date=August 2021}}

A re-release in 2003 added "Punk Rock 101", a cover of the 1980s [[new wave music|new wave band]] [[A Flock of Seagulls]]' "I Ran (So Far Away)", and "Star Song". An acoustic version of the song "Belgium" exists at the end of the album, as well as at the very end of the initial release. The cover of "I Ran (So Far Away)" was used as the opening theme song of the [[anime]] television show ''[[Saint Seiya|Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac]]'' in North America.

The band appeared in the 2002 film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'', playing at a graduation party.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275022/trivia |title=Crossroads (2002) – Trivia – IMDb |access-date=April 26, 2011}}</ref>

''[[A Hangover You Don't Deserve]]'' followed two years later, and has become the band's only [[Top 40]] album. Sales of the album were driven in large part by the [[radio]] [[airplay (song)|airplay]] of the single "[[1985 (SR-71 song)|1985]]", a song co-written by the band [[SR-71 (band)|SR-71]]. [[Mitch Allan]], lead vocalist of SR-71, contributed backing vocals to the song and appeared in the music video. "1985" became Bowling for Soup's biggest hit in the U.S., reaching No.&nbsp;23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. A second single from ''A Hangover You Don't Deserve'', "[[Almost (Bowling for Soup song)|Almost]]", charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]], No.&nbsp;46 on the U.S. Top 100, and No.&nbsp;23 on U.S. Pop 100. "[[Ohio (Come Back to Texas)|Ohio]]", better known as "Come Back to Texas", was released as a radio single in the U.S., but was not as popular as "1985" or "Almost", reaching only No.&nbsp;59 on the U.S. Pop 100.

===''Bowling for Soup Goes to the Movies'', ''StarJam'', and ''The Great Burrito Extortion Case'' (2005–2006)===
''[[Bowling for Soup Goes to the Movies]]'', a compilation album of cover songs and contributions to movie soundtracks, was released by the band in 2005. Later that year, Reddick and Burney made several appearances on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the '90s: Part Deux]]''. Bowling for Soup appeared briefly at the start of the 2005 film ''[[Cursed (2005 film)|Cursed]]'', playing the song "[[Li'l Red Riding Hood]]".

The group went on the ''Star 102.1 StarJam'' tour with [[Simple Plan]] in 2006 and were the opening act, performing "[[Almost (Bowling for Soup song)|Almost]]", "Trucker Hat", "[[Girl All the Bad Guys Want]]", "[[1985 (SR-71 song)|1985]]", "[[Punk Rock 101]]", "[[I Melt With You]]", and more. The group's cover version of [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]]'s "I Melt With You" was used in the [[Disney]] movie ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]'' and was on the movie's [[Sky High Soundtrack|soundtrack]]. A music video of the song was made for the movie, aired on the [[Disney Channel]] and can be found on the movie's DVD. Once more Bowling for Soup was at StarJams 2007 with Quietdrive and Army of Freshmen.

Following the release of the band's covers album, Bowling for Soup spent most of 2006 readying ''[[The Great Burrito Extortion Case]]'', the group's seventh album, which was released on November 7, 2006. The group released the first single from that album, "High School Never Ends", to [[iTunes]] on September 19, 2006. The UK release of the album was on February 5, 2007.

The band released "[[I'm Gay (Bowling for Soup song)|I'm Gay]]" as the second UK single in early 2007. The release was on CD and 7" vinyl. A music video for the single was released in the UK, made up of live performances of the song from the "Get Happy Tour", of which the band had performed in the UK during February 2007. On September 25, 2007, it was announced on the official Bowling for Soup forums that "When We Die" would be released as a download only single in the UK on October 22, 2007, as the third single.

{{More citations needed section|date=January 2010}}
Bowling for Soup's hit song "1985" was originally written by SR-71's Mitch Allan. According to Reddick, Allan showed the song to him and instructed him to take it as his own, as it seemed more of a Bowling for Soup song than an SR-71 song. Bowling for Soup worked closely with the alternative band [[Army of Freshmen]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.armyoffreshmen.com/press/aof_fact_sheet.pdf|title = Army of Freshmen Official Website|access-date = April 23, 2015|publisher = Armyoffreshmen.com|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923173734/http://www.armyoffreshmen.com/press/aof_fact_sheet.pdf|archive-date = September 23, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> In the video for "High School Never Ends" the boy clapping can be seen wearing an Army of Freshmen T-shirt, and Army of Freshmen themselves can be seen as part of the BFS Marching Band. Reddick does guest vocals on four tracks on Army of Freshmen's album ''Under the Radar''.

In 2003, fellow Texan punk rockers Junior opened for Bowling for Soup when the group played the club Trees in [[Deep Ellum]]. Reddick later co-wrote the song "She's So Amazing" for the band's album ''Are We Famous Yet?'', and lends vocals as well. The Irish pop rock singer [[Lesley Roy]] lend her vocals for Bowling for Soup's song "Much More Beautiful Person" from the album ''[[The Great Burrito Extortion Case]]''. Both Roy and Bowling for Soup are assigned to the same record label. Reddick is friends with [[MC Lars]]. Reddick has lent his vocals for MC Lars' single "[[Download This Song]]", and MC Lars is a part of Reddick's label Crappy Records. In 2009, Bowling for Soup cameoed in the music video "Telephone Operator" by The Leftovers, who are also a part of Crappy Records.

In 2001, Bowling for Soup performed the theme song for the [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]] film ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]''. The group's version of the theme was based on the previously written television series theme song written by [[Brian Causey]] of ''[[Man Or Astro-man?]]''. Also in 2001, Reddick wrote the lyrics for "The Greatest Day" for the film ''[[Max Keeble's Big Move]]'' while the band did the music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273799/soundtrack|title= Max Keeble's Big Move (2001) – Soundtracks|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=April 23, 2015}}</ref> Bowling for Soup also performed the theme "Today is Gonna Be a Great Day" for the [[Disney Channel]] cartoon ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', Reddick stars in the episode "Dude, We're Getting The Band Back Together" where he is the lead vocalist of a fictional band called "Love Händel". The band itself also appeared in animated form in the episode "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" in which the band performed an alternate version of the show's theme with Phineas and Ferb for their futuristic nephews. On [[Cartoon Network]], Reddick and Chandler both played an acoustic show in 2006. And in August 2008 Reddick and Chandler filmed an exclusive video for ''[[Total Guitar]]'' magazine in the UK called "How To Write A Song In 5 Minutes". In 2008,  Reddick teamed up with [[SEGA]] to work on the theme song for ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'', titled "Endless Possibility".

[[New Zealand]] band 48May ran into legal issues and decided to take the song "Leather and Tattoos" off of the group's debut album. The album was replaced with a "tour edition" of the CD with the questionable song missing. The melody was very similar to "[[Punk Rock 101]]".

In 2006, Bowling for Soup covered [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]'s "[[London Bridge (Fergie song)|London Bridge]]" for Pepsi Smash Cover Art on Yahoo! videos.

In 2008, Reddick co-arranged co-wrote and produced the singles "SUV" and "Girls + Summer = Fun!" with solo artist [[Christy Darlington]], and Erik Chandler and Gary Wiseman performed on the recordings as well. These songs were subsequently released digitally. This collaboration resulted from Bowling for Soup and Darlington having performed concerts together and knowing each other since the late 1990s in the Dallas music scene and mutual respect and appreciation for each other's music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://darlingtonmusic.bandcamp.com|title=Signup - Bandcamp|access-date=December 22, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102093628/http://darlingtonmusic.bandcamp.com/|archive-date=January 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===''High School Never Ends: The Musical''===
In 2018, it was announced that a fan-created and crowdfunded jukebox musical was being worked on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/Southington/Southington-News/On-the-Record-Music-Bowling-for-Soup.html|title=Bowling for Soup to play Apple Harvest Festival in Southington Saturday|work=myrecordjournal.com|access-date=November 7, 2018}}</ref> The musical, ''High School Never Ends'', about a high-school reunion and its effects on two estranged lovers named Jaret Thompson and Emily McKenzie, was written and directed by Owen B Lewis for Make It Happen Productions, and was shown at Bristol Improv Theatre in November 2018 with Jamie Harradence and Becky Mitchell in the lead roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://improvtheatre.co.uk/events/high-school-never-ends/|title=High School Never Ends - The Bristol Improv Theatre|work=The Bristol Improv Theatre|access-date=November 7, 2018|archive-date=November 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116001108/https://improvtheatre.co.uk/events/high-school-never-ends/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hsnemusical/photos/a.1364405073706066/1453695598110346/?type=3&theater|title=High School Never Ends The Musical|work=Facebook|access-date=November 7, 2018}}</ref>

In May 2019, a shortened one-hour version was performed at Waterloo East Theatre in London, directed by Riccardo Carollo and featuring an entirely new cast and crew. Due to the shorter nature of this production, a few songs had been omitted and some minor changes were made to the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.waterlooeast.co.uk/high-school-never-ends|title=waterlooeast {{!}} High School Never Ends The Musical|work=waterlooeast.co.uk|access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref>

Further performances were planned in Bristol in April 2020, with tickets predominantly selling on [[EventBrite]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eventbrite.co.uk/e/high-school-never-ends-the-musical-tickets-90587213795 |title=High School Never Ends The Musical tickets|work=EventBrite|access-date=February 18, 2020}}</ref> though the initial production was halted due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

==Music videos==
It became a running gag in Bowling for Soup's music videos to feature previous songs of the band as an introduction for the video. This can be seen in "Girl All the Bad Guys Want", "Emily", and "High School Never Ends", which each featuring music from "The Bitch Song", "Girl All the Bad Guys Want", and "1985" respectively.
