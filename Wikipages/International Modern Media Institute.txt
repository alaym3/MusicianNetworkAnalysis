The '''International Modern Media Institute''' ('''IMMI''') is an international institution with the aim of promoting debate about laws good for [[freedom of information]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], and [[freedom of expression|expression]]. The institute does this by offering advice and guidance in relation to legislation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.immi.is/about-immi/|title=About IMMI|website=en.immi.is|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>

==History<!-- Part of this history should be moved to [[Icelandic Modern Media Initiative]]. -->==

The proposal passed on 16 June was not a piece of final legislation. Instead, it began a process of editing 13 separate laws according to the proposal's specifications. This process was expected to be completed by mid-2012.<ref>{{cite web | title=ICELAND TO BECOME INTERNATIONAL TRANSPARENCY HAVEN | url=http://immi.is/?l=en&p=intro | access-date=3 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Iceland seeks to become sanctuary for free speech | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iceland-free-speech-20110403,0,5332545.story | date=2 April 2011 | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | access-date= 3 April 2011 | first=Henry | last=Chu}}</ref>

After WikiLeaks exposed the loan book of [[Kaupthing Bank]], one of the largest news channels, RUV, was injuncted from displaying the news story. Instead they were forced to simply put a message up of the WikiLeaks website. This led to WikiLeaks being invited by the Digital Freedoms Society to attend an annual conference in Iceland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mirror.wikileaks.info/leak/kaupthing-claims.pdf |title=WIKILEAKS - - List of claims lodged against Kaupthing Bank hf, January 23, 2010 |access-date=2014-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128025440/http://mirror.wikileaks.info/leak/kaupthing-claims.pdf |archive-date=January 28, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2010/12/07/meet-the-new-public-face-of-wikileaks-kristinn-hrafnsson/?boxes=techchannellighttop |title=Meet The New Public Face Of WikiLeaks: Kristinn Hrafnsson - Forbes |publisher=Blogs.forbes.com |access-date=2014-02-28}}</ref><ref>[http://icelandweatherreport.com/2009/08/kaupthings-loan-book-exposed-and-an-injunction-ordered-against-ruv.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627010846/http://icelandweatherreport.com/2009/08/kaupthings-loan-book-exposed-and-an-injunction-ordered-against-ruv.html |date=June 27, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8504972.stm | work=BBC News | first=Chris | last=Vallance | title=Iceland to be 'journalism haven' | date=12 February 2010}}</ref>
