==History==
===Formation (2009–10)===
Grouplove formed out of a friendship among the five members of the band. Hooper met Zucconi on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] after hearing music from his former band [[ALOKE]]. Despite having just met, Hooper invited Zucconi to an artist residency in [[Crete]] she was leaving for later that week.<ref name="Grouplove’s Christian Zucconi">{{cite news|author=Fortune, Drew | title=Interview With Grouplove’s Christian Zucconi|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/grouploves-christian-zucconi,73655/|newspaper=A.V. Club|access-date=19 September 2013}}</ref>  It was at the Ikarus artist commune in the village of Avdou where they met the rest of the band, Andrew Wessen, Ryan Rabin, and Sean Gadd. Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, grew up in [[Los Angeles]] with Wessen, a surfer and guitarist. Rabin comes from a musical family – his father is [[Trevor Rabin]], former guitarist of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. Sean Gadd, a songwriter and guitarist from [[London]], was also at the commune. The friendship between the members formed quickly, but the band did not form until a year later after Gadd, Zucconi and Hooper pooled their funds together and made a trip to Rabin's Los Angeles recording studio. They played their first show at El Cid in Los Angeles on May 10, 2010.  Later that year, the band went on tour with [[Florence and the Machine]] on the west coast, and then [[the Joy Formidable]] on the east coast. By November, [[Nylon Magazine]] recognized Grouplove as one of the top ten in the "Best New Bands in 2010."<ref name="mxdwn">{{cite web|author=Emily Damon |url=http://www.mxdwn.com/2010/11/04/news/grouplove-to-release-debut-ep-january-25 |title=Grouplove To Release Debut EP January 25 |publisher=Mxdwn.com |access-date=2015-04-16}}</ref>
