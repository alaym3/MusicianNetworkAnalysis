==Etymology==
The Mariana Trench is named after the nearby [[Mariana Islands]], which are named Las Marianas in honor of Spanish Queen [[Mariana of Austria]], widow of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. The islands are part of the [[island arc]] that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.

==Geology==
[[File:Cross section of mariana trench.svg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|The Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Mariana Plate, creating the Mariana trench, and (further on) the arc of the Mariana Islands, as water trapped in the plate is released and explodes upward to form island volcanoes and earthquakes.]]
The Mariana Trench is part of the [[Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc|Izu–Bonin–Mariana]] [[subduction]] system that forms the [[convergent boundary|boundary]] between two [[tectonic plate]]s. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the [[Pacific Plate]], is [[subduction|subducted]] (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller [[Mariana Plate]] that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on Earth (up to 170 million years old), and is, therefore, cooler and denser; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.

The movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the [[Mariana Islands]]. These volcanic islands are caused by [[flux melting]] of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] due to the release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the [[Pacific Plate]].

The trench was first [[Depth sounding|sounded]] during the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of {{convert|4475|fathom|m ft|abbr=off|lk=in}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/ |title=About the Mariana Trench – DEEPSEA CHALLENGE Expedition |publisher=Deepseachallenge.com |date=26 March 2012 |access-date=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628083954/http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/ |archive-date=28 June 2013}}</ref> In 1877, a map was published called ''Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans'' ("Depth map of the Great Ocean") by Petermann, which showed a ''Challenger Tief'' ("Challenger deep") at the location of that sounding. In 1899, {{USS|Nero|AC-17|6}}, a converted collier, recorded a depth of {{convert|5269|fathom|m ft|abbr=off}}.<ref name="Theberge">{{cite web |url=https://www.hydro-international.com/content/article/thirty-years-of-discovering-the-mariana-trench |title=Thirty Years of Discovering the Mariana Trench |last=Theberge |first=A. |date=24 March 2009 |work=Hydro International |access-date=31 July 2010}}</ref>

In 1951, ''[[HMS Challenger (1931)|Challenger II]]'' surveyed the trench using [[echo sounding]], a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition. During this survey, the deepest part of the trench was recorded when the ''Challenger II'' measured a depth of {{convert|5960|fathom|m ft|abbr=off}} at {{Coord|11|19|N|142|15|E}}, known as the [[Challenger Deep]].<ref name="marianatrench.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-exploration_001.htm |title=The Mariana Trench – Exploration |publisher=marianatrench.com}}</ref>

In 1957, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] vessel {{ship|RV|Vityaz|1939|2}} reported a depth of {{convert|11034|m}} at a location dubbed the ''Mariana Hollow''.<ref name="mariana_britannica" />

In 1962, the surface ship M.V. ''Spencer F. Baird'' recorded a maximum depth of {{convert|10915|m}} using precision [[depth gauge]]s.

In 1984, the Japanese survey vessel ''Takuyō'' (拓洋) collected data from the Mariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; it reported a maximum depth of {{convert|10924|m}}, also reported as {{convert|10920|m}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Tani">{{cite web |url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/ablos/ABLOS08Folder/Session4-Paper4-Tani.pdf |title=Continental shelf survey of Japan |last=Tani |first=S. |access-date=24 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309013717/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/ablos/ABLOS08Folder/Session4-Paper4-Tani.pdf |archive-date=9 March 2011 }}</ref> Remotely Operated Vehicle ''[[Kaikō|KAIKO]]'' reached the deepest area of the Mariana Trench and made the deepest diving record of {{convert|10911|m}} on 24 March 1995.<ref>[http://www.mhi.co.jp/technology/review/abstractj-32-6-427.html Development and Construction of Launcher System of 10000m‐Class Remotely Operated Vehicle KAIKO] Mitsubishi Heavy Industry</ref>

During surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had depth similar to the Challenger Deep, possibly even deeper. It was discovered while scientists from the [[University of Hawaii|Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology]] were completing a survey around [[Guam]]; they used a sonar mapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey. This new spot was named the [[HMRG Deep|HMRG (Hawaii Mapping Research Group) Deep]], after the group of scientists who discovered it.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sea floor survey reveals deep hole |first=David |last=Whitehouse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3071749.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=16 July 2003 |access-date=17 December 2011}}</ref>

On 1 June 2009, mapping aboard the {{ship|RV|Kilo Moana}} (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), indicated a spot with a depth of {{convert|10971|m|0}}. The sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep was possible by its Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water. The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath (implying that the depth figure is accurate to ± {{convert|22|m}}).<ref name="Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA">{{Cite news |url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/Reports/Archives/KMreportJuneJuly2009.html |title=Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA June and July 2009 |publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524194643/http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/Reports/Archives/KMreportJuneJuly2009.html |archive-date=24 May 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Scientic Equipment aboard the R/V KILO MOANA">{{Cite news |url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/KM/scienceequipment.htm |title=Inventory of Scientific Equipment aboard the R/V KILO MOANA |publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613143513/http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/KM/scienceequipment.htm |archive-date=13 June 2010 }}</ref>

In December 2014, a new species of [[snailfish]] was discovered at a depth of {{convert|8145|m|ft|abbr=on}}, breaking the previous record for the deepest living fish seen on video.<ref name=BBCDeept>{{cite web |title=New record for deepest fish |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-30541065 |first=Rebecca |last=Morelle |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=9 December 2014 |access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref>

During the 2014 expedition, several new species were filmed, including huge [[Amphipoda|amphipods]] known as supergiants. [[Deep-sea gigantism]] is the process where species grow larger than their shallow-water relatives.<ref name=BBCDeept/>

In May 2017, an unidentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of {{Convert|8178|m|ft|-2}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/deepest-fish-1.4263003 |title=Ghostly fish in Mariana Trench in the Pacific is deepest ever recorded |work=[[CBC News]] |date=25 August 2017 |access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref>

===Pollution===
In 2016, a research expedition looked at the chemical makeup of crustacean scavengers collected from the range of 7,841–10,250 metres within the trench. Within these organisms, the researchers found extremely elevated concentrations of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], a chemical toxin banned for its environmental harm in the 1970s, concentrated at all depths within the sediment of the trench.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Jamieson |first1=Alan J. |last2=Malkocs |first2=Tamas |last3=Piertney |first3=Stuart B. |last4=Fujii |first4=Toyonobu |last5=Zhang |first5=Zulin |date=13 February 2017 |title=Bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants in the deepest ocean fauna |journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=51 |doi=10.1038/s41559-016-0051 |pmid=28812719 |issn=2397-334X |hdl=2164/9142 |s2cid=9192602 |hdl-access=free}}</ref> Further research has found that amphipods also ingest [[microplastics]], with 100% of amphipods having at least one piece of synthetic material in their stomachs.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Jamieson |first1=A.

==Possible nuclear waste disposal site==
Like other oceanic trenches, the Mariana Trench has been proposed as a site for [[radioactive waste#dispose|nuclear waste disposal]] in 1972,<ref name="isbn0-387-95560-7"/><ref name="isbn0-7546-7133-X"/> in the hope that tectonic plate [[subduction]] occurring at the site might eventually push the nuclear waste deep into the [[Earth's mantle]], the second layer of the Earth. However, ocean dumping of nuclear waste is prohibited by international law.<ref name="isbn0-387-95560-7">{{cite book |author=Hafemeister, David W. |title=Physics of societal issues: calculations on national security, environment, and energy |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |page=187 |isbn=978-0-387-95560-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LT4MSqv9QUIC&pg=PA187}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-7546-7133-X">{{cite book |author1=Kingsley, Marvin G. |author2=Rogers, Kenneth H. |title=Calculated risks: highly radioactive waste and homeland security |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot, Hants, England |year=2007 |pages=75–76 |isbn=978-0-7546-7133-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOP4-BpYXrEC&pg=PA75}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/ilr/ona/pages/dumping2.htm |title=Dumping and Loss overview |work=Oceans in the Nuclear Age |access-date=18 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605190619/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/ilr/ona/pages/dumping2.htm |archive-date=5 June 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, plate subduction zones are associated with very large [[megathrust earthquake]]s, the effects of which are unpredictable for the safety of long-term disposal of nuclear wastes within the [[hadopelagic]] [[ecosystem]].<ref name="isbn0-7546-7133-X"/>
