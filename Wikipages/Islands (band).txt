'''Islands''' is an [[indie rock]] band from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The group was founded in 2005 by [[Nicholas Thorburn]] and [[Jamie Thompson]], shortly after the breakup of [[The Unicorns]], of which both were members. Their current lineup includes Thorburn, often known by his stage name Nick Diamonds, along with brothers Evan Gordon and Geordie Gordon, and Adam Halferty. The band has released 8 studio albums, with their 8th album [[Islomania (Islands album)|''Islomania'']] released on June 11, 2021.

== History ==

=== Formation and ''Return to the Sea'' (2005—2006)===
Following the abrupt breakup of [[The Unicorns]] in 2004, members [[Nicholas Thorburn]] and [[Jamie Thompson]] simultaneously formed Islands and hip-hop group Th' Corn Gangg, and recorded Islands' debut album, ''[[Return to the Sea]]'', during 2005. The album was recorded at [[Breakglass Studio]] and Thompson's bedroom in [[Montreal]], Canada, and was produced by [[audio engineer]]/[[record producer]] Mark Lawson.

Left to Right: Sarah Neufeld (violin, Arcade Fire), Nick Diamonds (Islands), Mark Lawson (audio engineer), Richard Parry (upright bass, Arcade Fire), Jamie Thompson (Islands), Becky Foon (cello, A Silver Mt. Zion and Esmerine).]]
''Return to the Sea'' was re-mastered in [[England]] for the [[Europe]]an version of the album, and was released there by [[Rough Trade Records]] on April 3, 2006. In [[North America]], the album was released on the upstart label [[Equator Records (Canada)|Equator Records]] on April 4, 2006. The cover of the album is a painting by [[Caspar David Friedrich]] titled ''The Wreck of the Hope''. The album features numerous guest appearances, including members of [[Arcade Fire]] and [[Wolf Parade]].

The band played various shows around the US and Canada throughout mid-late 2005, followed by an opening slot for [[Metric (band)|Metric]] on their early 2006 tour. After ''Return to the Sea'' was released in April 2006, the band embarked on their first full headlining tour, playing small clubs around the US and Canada throughout May. They were joined by [[Cadence Weapon]] and [[Why? (American band)|Why?]] on the first half of the tour, and [[Cadence Weapon]] and [[Busdriver]] on the second. The band generally received critical acclaim for their live shows, which sometimes ended with the band leading the audience out of the venue "[[pied piper]] style" and onto the surrounding streets.

On May 28, 2006, it was announced that Thompson was leaving the band. Islands decided to continue on without Thompson, and a European tour was scheduled, and further recordings confirmed. The band later emerged the following month for two surprise appearances in Montreal, performing with a new lineup including new drummer Aaron Harris and multi-instrumentalist Kate Perkins, before departing for Europe the following week.

=== ''Arm's Way'', new lineup, and ''Vapours'' (2007—2009) ===
During subsequent tour dates in Iceland, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, the band premiered several new songs which appeared on their second album, ''Arm's Way'', which was released on Los Angeles-based [[ANTI-]] Records on May 20, 2008.

On June 19, 2009, it was announced that the entire band except for Thorburn had left the group. The new lineup included brothers Evan and Geordie Gordon, and a returning Thompson. Islands' third album, ''Vapours'', was released September 22, 2009 on ANTI-. The band extensively toured the record in North America with [[Jemina Pearl]] and [[Toro Y Moi]].<ref>Phillips, Amy. [http://pitchfork.com/news/36034-islands-reveal-lp-cover-tour-dates Islands Reveal LP Cover, Tour Dates]. ''Pitchfork Media'', July 27, 2009</ref> During the spring of 2010, Islands toured Europe, playing shows in Northern and Western Europe throughout March and April.

In an interview with [[Exclaim!]], Nick Thorburn explained that the overhauled lineup was a product of his desire to try new things. "That's important to me ― to be able to constantly try new things. That's why this record's largely informed by electronic stuff like drum machines, sequencing, and programming, which really scales it back from the last record."<ref>[http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/FromTheMagazine/islands_in_slipstream Islands in the Slipstream]. ''[[Exclaim]]!'' magazine. September, 2009.</ref> Thompson once again left the band prior to the summer 2010 tour, and was again replaced by Aaron Harris.

=== ''A Sleep & A Forgetting'' and ''Ski Mask'' (2010—2014) ===
Following ''Vapours''' release, Thorburn formed the band [[Mister Heavenly]] with [[Man Man]]'s Honus Honus and [[Modest Mouse]]'s [[Joe Plummer]].<ref>{{cite news

On October 25, 2011, ANTI- announced Islands' fourth record, ''A Sleep & a Forgetting'', which was released February 14, 2012. In a statement, Thorburn explained, "I left New York after the end of a relationship and came to Los Angeles. There was a piano where I was staying and that’s where I wrote these songs. This record deals with loss, with memory and forgetting and with dreaming. I started writing it on Valentine’s Day and it’s coming out on Valentine’s Day."<ref>{{cite news

The song "Hallways" from the album was featured in a commercial for Dell and the Microsoft Surface tablet.

On July 9, 2013, Thorburn revealed ''Ski Mask'', Islands' fifth record, and the first with new drummer Adam Halferty. That same day, the band premiered the lead single, "Wave Forms". The album was released on September 17, 2013, followed by a number of tours across the US, Canada, and Europe, including an appearance at Primavera Sound Fest in Barcelona.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://islandsareforever.com/news/ |title=Islands |website=Islandsareforever.com |date=2014-01-16 |access-date=2017-06-30}}</ref>

=== ''Should I Remain Here, At Sea?'' and ''Taste'' (2015—2016) ===
During the summer of 2015, Islands simultaneously recorded two records: ''Should I Remain Here, At Sea?'' — a spiritual successor to the band's debut album, ''Return to the Sea'' — and ''Taste'', a "more electronic" album "buoyed by drum machines, programming and vintage synths."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/islands |title=Islands: TWO New Albums on PledgeMusic |website=Pledgemusic.com |access-date=2017-06-30}}</ref> The albums were released on May 13, 2016 via the band's own Manqué label, reaching #21 and #23 on the Billboard Heatseeker charts, respectively.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/heatseekers-albums/2016-06-04 |title=Heatseekers Albums: Up and Coming Musicians Chart |magazine=Billboard |date=2016-06-04 |access-date=2017-06-30}}</ref>

=== ''Islomania'' (2016—present) ===
After the dual release in 2016 and the subsequent tour, the band was largely inactive for a few years, without any touring or new music. Thorburn has stated in interviews that he quit the band in 2016, but returned to it after beginning to write new music that he felt was "for Islands only."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2021/03/04/news/islands-announces-new-album-islomania-for-june-2021-release-and-shares-new-video-for-we-like-to-do-it-with-the-lights-on/ |title=Islands Announces New Album Islomania For June 2021 Release and Shares New Video for “(We Like To) Do It With The Lights On” |website=mxdwn.com |access-date=2021-03-08}}</ref> The new album ''Islomania'' was announced on March 3, 2021 and released on June 11, 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/islands-new-song-we-like-to-do-it-with-the-lights-on-1135931/ |title=Islands Preview First Album in Five Years With ‘(We Like To) Do It With the Lights On’ |website=Rollingstone.com |access-date=2021-03-08}}</ref>
