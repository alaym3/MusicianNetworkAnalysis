==History==
===1991–2001: Early history and ''The National''===
Matt Berninger and Scott Devendorf met in 1991 while attending the [[University of Cincinnati]]'s DAAP college of graphic design program,<ref>{{cite news |date=May 26, 2013 |title=Interview: The National's Scott Devendorf |url=http://sixeyes.blogspot.ca/2013/05/interview-nationals-scott-devendorf.html|access-date=June 11, 2013 | first=Alan | last=Williamson}}</ref> where they also met Mike Brewer, [[Casey Reas]] and Jeff Salem.<ref>{{cite news |date=September 7, 2007 |title=The Washington Post: Getting Closer to the Truth With the National |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/30/AR2007083000526.html|access-date=September 11, 2010 | first=Richard | last=Harrington}}</ref> Together, the five of them formed the lo-fi garage band Nancy, named after Berninger's mother, aspiring to sound like [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]].<ref>{{cite news |date=April 22, 2010 |title=The Guardian: The National: gloomy...with a hint of sunshine |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/22/the-national-interview|access-date=September 11, 2010 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Purcell}}</ref> The band was together for five years, and released one album, ''Ruther 3429'', on Wife Records before breaking up after Berninger, Devendorf, Reas and Salem moved to [[Brooklyn]].<ref>{{cite web | title = ruther 3429 | url = http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/creas/eat/ruther3429.html|website=Acg.media.mit.edu | access-date=August 24, 2011}}</ref> Bryan, Bryce, and Aaron were childhood friends who played in several bands together over the years. When their last effort, Project Nim, broke up in 1998, they joined Matt and Scott in Brooklyn via the Devendorf relationship.

When the band was formed in 1999, it was called "The National", although the domain name of the band's website is americanmary.com because, according to Matt Berninger, "[i]t's a song off our first record. We never thought of changing the (website) name, although we should have."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sixeyes.blogspot.ca/2005/08/national-interview_06.html|title=Royal Crow: The National - Interview|website=Sixeyes.blogspot.ca|access-date=September 8, 2017|date=August 6, 2005}}</ref> Several of the members continued to work day jobs, including being involved in New York's [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]], while performing free Sunday night shows regularly at Lower East Side venue [[Luna Lounge]]. 

Their first album ''[[The National (album)|The National]]'' was eventually released in 2001 on [[Brassland Records]], a label founded by band members [[Aaron and Bryce Dessner]], along with their friend [[Alec Hanley Bemis]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Official Brassland Records page| url = http://www.brassland.org/about.php| website=Brassland.org|access-date=July 13, 2010}}</ref> When reviewing the album, Jason MacNeil of ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' wrote, "...The National has created nearly a dozen picture-perfect [[Americana music|Americana]] bar-soaked gems with its debut album. From the opening notes of 'Beautiful Head', the delicate line between polished [[roots rock|roots-oriented pop]] and [[alt-country]] has rarely been walked so deliberately with the payoff so favorable."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nodepression.com/album-review/national-self-titled | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524193115/http://nodepression.com/album-review/national-self-titled | url-status=dead | archive-date=May 24, 2015 | title=Album Review - The National - Self-Titled | publisher=No Depression | date=October 31, 2001 | access-date=July 13, 2010 }}</ref>

===2003–2006: ''Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers'', ''Cherry Tree'' and ''Alligator''===

In 2004, they released the ''[[Cherry Tree (EP)|Cherry Tree]]'' EP. The EP featured "All the Wine," a song that would appear on their next record. The release of the EP garnered further success and landed them on a successful tour with [[The Walkmen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In the same year, the band quit their day jobs and signed to a new label, [[Beggars Banquet Records]], because the process of running their own label was becoming "too complicated".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sixeyes.blogspot.com/2005/08/national-interview_06.html |title=The National – Interview |publisher=Sixeyes.blogspot.com |date=August 6, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2009}}</ref>

== Origin of the band name ==

Regarding the band name, the National, [[Matt Berninger]] explained this way in a 2007 interview:
{{quote|When anyone’s coming up with a band name, it was one of those things. We were trying to find a name that didn’t mean anything. That was sort of devoid of any kind of interpretation and wasn’t overly clever. It’s just very simple. And that was the simplest thing we could think of just because it is so... You can’t walk down the street without seeing the words “The National” something or other somewhere. So it was benign and meaningless; that’s kind of why we picked it. Although that backfired a little bit because we went to Europe—we probably should have thought of this ahead of time—but nationalism has a very right-wing connotation, especially in Germany, France and ... the Nationalists and the National Front and all that kind of stuff. So in Germany, we actually had some shows boycotted because they thought we were in someway affiliated with the right-wing conservative neo-Nazi party, which we had to do some press to make sure people realized that we were not associated with the Nazis. The band name, it’s kind of funny, when we started out, we would probably name it something else, but we’re stuck with it, and I’m happy with it.|[[Matt Berninger]] on theSceneStar.com<ref>[https://thescenestar.typepad.com/ss/2007/06/interview-matt-.html TypePad.com Interview: Matt Berninger of the National]</ref>}}
