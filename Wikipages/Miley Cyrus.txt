The campaign features a series of portraits starring [[transgender]] and gender-expansive people, which were posted to her Instagram feed with the hashtags "#HappyHippiePresents" and "#InstaPride". It was aimed at encouraging diversity and tolerance by showing these people in a positive light as examples for others who might be struggling to figure themselves out, as well as a reference point for people who didn't know personally anyone in that situation. Cyrus was the one behind the camera for the photo shoot the whole time and even interviewed her 14 subjects to share their personal stories along with their portraits. She decided to predominate the color yellow since she believes it is a happy and non-sexualized color. She said she wanted to bring attention and celebrate people who wouldn't normally find themselves being the stars of a photo shoot or wouldn't find themselves on the cover of a magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Miley Cyrus launches Instapride campaign to honor transgender people |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/miley-cyrus-launches-instapride-campaign-to-honor-transgender-people-62976/ |magazine=Rolling Stone  |access-date=October 17, 2018|date=June 15, 2015 }}</ref>
