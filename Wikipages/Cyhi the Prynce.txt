Growing up in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Young played various sports including [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], and track and field; in addition to having sung in school choirs and participated in school plays and dances.

===2015–present: Label confusion and ''L.I.O.N.''===
As of August 2015, CyHi's album had yet to receive a release date. Frustrated with his situation and having been dropped from [[Def Jam Recordings]], he released a diss track called "Elephant in the Room", aimed toward G.O.O.D. Music, its owner Kanye West, Pusha T and Teyana Taylor. On the track, he addresses his album delays and even threatens Kanye: "While you're in your little Lambo on Sunset, I'm riding with a gun next to me and it sounds like a little boy playing with a drum set / And, it holds a hundred rounds 'cause when you come around, niggas quick to gun you down."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/08/05/cyhi-the-prynce-disses-kanye-west-pusha-t-in-new-song/ |title=CyHi The Prynce Disses Kanye West, Pusha T in New Song |publisher=BallerStatus.com |date=August 5, 2015}}</ref>

CyHi would later clarify that the track was not in fact a diss. Rather it was similar to the light-hearted 'insults' that [[Eminem]] would inflict on [[Dr. Dre]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lyons |first=Patrick |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/cyhi-the-prynce-says-he-didnt-diss-kanye-west-on-elephant-in-the-room-news.16959.html |title=CyHi The Prynce Says He Didn't Diss Kanye West On "Elephant in the Room" |website=Hotnewhiphop.com |date=August 8, 2015 |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref> An upcoming album to be titled ''L.I.O.N.'' was announced amid this increase in media attention, still containing the G.O.O.D. Music imprint's logo, further indicating that CyHi was still with the label, and on good terms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lilah |first=Rose |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/cyhi-the-prynce-announces-new-album-lion-news.16938.html?image=1&gallery=0 |title=CyHi The Prynce Announces New Album "L.I.O.N." |website=Hotnewhiphop.com |date=August 7, 2015 |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref>

His debut album, [[No Dope on Sundays]], was released on November 17, 2017. It was preceded by the singles "Movin' Around" featuring [[Schoolboy Q]] and "Dat Side" featuring Kanye West.

On February 14, 2021, CyHi revealed on Instagram that he had survived an assassination attempt. As he was driving on an Atlanta highway, his car was reportedly shot up, causing it to flip over. After his car hit a pole and crashed into a tree, the suspect continued to shoot the car before fleeing the scene.
