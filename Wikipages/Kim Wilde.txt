She first saw success in 1981 with her debut single "[[Kids in America]]", which reached number two in the UK. In 1983, she received the [[Brit Award]] for Best British Female solo artist.<ref name="Brits">[http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/kim-wilde BRITs Profile: Kim Wilde] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201105822/http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/kim-wilde |date=1 February 2012 }} Brits.co.uk.

==Early life==
[[File:Oakfield-school.jpg|thumb|[[Oakfield Preparatory School]] in Dulwich]]
The eldest child of 1950s [[rock 'n' roll]]er [[Marty Wilde]] (birth name Reginald Smith) and Joyce Baker, who had been a member of the singing and dancing group [[the Vernons Girls]], Kim Smith was born in the [[West (London sub region)|West London]] suburb of [[Chiswick]] and attended [[Oakfield Preparatory School]], in the [[South East (London sub region)|Southeast London]] area of [[Dulwich]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} When she was nine, the family moved to [[Hertfordshire]], where she was educated at [[Tewin]] and later [[Presdales School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hertsmemories.org.uk/content/herts-history/towns-and-villages/thundridge/memories-of-thundridge-part-4 |title=Memories of Thundridge - Joan Woolard |access-date=21 November 2018}}</ref> In 1980, at age 20, she completed a foundation course at St Albans College of Art & Design. As Kim Wilde, she was signed to [[RAK Records]] by [[Mickie Most]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilde-life.com/magazines/intro1/index.html|title=The Official Fan Club for Kim Wilde Introductory Booklet, 1981|page=4|website=Wilde-life.com|access-date=27 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210141607/http://www.wilde-life.com/magazines/intro1/index.html|archive-date=10 February 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Music career==
===The RAK years===
Wilde's father Marty and brother, [[Ricky Wilde|Ricky]], were responsible for writing virtually all of her material in the early-to-mid 1980s. Key influences on the songwriting process included [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD), [[Ultravox]], [[John Foxx]], [[Gary Numan]], [[Skids (band)|Skids]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], [[Kraftwerk]] and [[the Stranglers]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Houghton|first=Richard|date=2019|title=OMD: Pretending to See the Future|edition=expanded paperback|publisher=This Day in Music Books|page=454|isbn=978-1916115620|quote=[Ricky Wilde:] Andy [McCluskey] appeared from nowhere and sat next to me, and I finally thanked him for all the inspiration.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-the-song-kids-in-america-by-kim-wilde|title=The story behind the song: Kids in America by Kim Wilde|last=Edwards|first=Briony|date=20 February 2018|website=Louder|access-date=24 May 2021}}</ref> Wilde released her debut single "[[Kids in America]]" in January 1981. An instant success, it reached number two in the UK Singles Chart and scaled the Top 5 in other countries such as Germany, France and Australia.<ref>David Kent (1993) Australian Chart Book 1970–1992, Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W.</ref> Although it achieved only moderate success in the US, peaking at number 25 when released in 1982, it is often regarded today as Wilde's signature song. Her debut album ''[[Kim Wilde (album)|Kim Wilde]]'' repeated the success of the single, spawning two further hits in "[[Chequered Love]]" (Top 5 in the UK, France, Australia and Germany) and the UK-only single "[[Water on Glass]]" (UK number 11).

Wilde's follow-up album was 1982's ''[[Select (album)|Select]]'', led by the hit singles "[[Cambodia (song)|Cambodia]]" and "[[View from a Bridge]]". Both were number 1 hits in France and reached Top 10 positions in Germany and Australia. At the time, there was some controversy about Wilde's hesitation to do live concerts.<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/articles/1981/kim-wilde-taking-different-route-to-top Kim Wilde taking different route to top : Word-of-mouth, Personal Promotions, Not Live Shows build sales] Billboard (US), 19 September 1981</ref> Her first concerts in September 1982 took place in Denmark,<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/articles/1982/1200-wild-wilde-friends 1200 Wild Wilde-friends] Sjællands Tidende (Denmark), 11 September 1982</ref> before embarking on a UK-wide tour in October.<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/articles/1982/finally-kim-on-tour Finally: Kim on tour] Veronica (Netherlands), 2 October 1982</ref> Wilde's third album, ''[[Catch as Catch Can (album)|Catch as Catch Can]]'' (1983) was a relative failure.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The first single from the album, "[[Love Blonde]]", was another success in France and Scandinavia, but failed to have major success in other countries. The failure of the album led to her leaving RAK and signing with [[MCA Records]] in the summer of 1984.<ref>[https://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/w/wilde-kim"Wilde, Kim"] Retrieved 11 August 2015</ref>

===The MCA years===
Wilde's first MCA album ''[[Teases & Dares]]'' was again overlooked in her home country,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} but fared better in Germany, France and Scandinavia as well as scoring another German Top 10 single with "[[The Second Time]]" (which was Top 30 in the UK). The video for this song appeared in an episode of the 1980s TV hit ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' in 1985.<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/knight-rider Knight rider] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003042511/http://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/knight-rider |date=3 October 2011 }} Wilde Life - Official Kim Wilde Fansite</ref> The second single, "[[The Touch (Kim Wilde song)|The Touch]]", was not a commercial success, but the third single, the [[rockabilly]] "[[Rage to Love]]", made the UK top 20 in 1985. On ''Teases & Dares'', Wilde made her first songwriting contributions, penning two songs. Meanwhile, she had embarked on three European concert tours (1983, 1985 and 1986).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

On her fifth album, 1986's ''[[Another Step]]'', Wilde wrote or co-wrote most of the songs. The album's lead single "[[Schoolgirl (song)|Schoolgirl]]" flopped in Europe and Australia, but Wilde's fortunes improved in spectacular fashion with the album's second single, a [[Hi-NRG]] remake of [[The Supremes]] classic "[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/another-step-r58345/review|title=Another Step-Kim Wilde |work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=14 August 2011}}</ref> After topping the charts in Australia and Canada and peaking at number two in the UK, it became a US number one single in 1987. With that hit, she became the fifth UK female solo artist ever to top the US Hot 100, following [[Petula Clark]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Sheena Easton]], and [[Bonnie Tyler]].<ref name="BBCAmerica">[http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/23/anglophenia.jsp?bc_id=987 Leona Lewis, First UK Woman In 21 Years To Top Billboard Hot 100] BBC America, 27 March 2008</ref> Her popularity, especially in her native UK, was revitalised and she scored further Top 10 hits in 1987 with "[[Another Step (Closer to You)]]" (recorded with [[Norman Giscombe|Junior]]) and "[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]" (a [[Comic Relief]] charity single, recorded with comedian [[Mel Smith]]).

In 1988, Wilde released her biggest selling album to date,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} ''[[Close (Kim Wilde album)|Close]]'', which returned her to the UK top 10 and spent almost eight months on the UK album chart. It produced four major European hits: "[[Hey Mister Heartache]]", "[[You Came]]", "[[Never Trust a Stranger]]" and "[[Four Letter Word (Kim Wilde song)|Four Letter Word]]" (the last 3 were Top 10 hits in the UK). The release of the album coincided with a tour of Europe, where she was the opening act for [[Michael Jackson]]'s [[Bad World Tour]].<ref name="laut">{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/Kim-Wilde |title=Kim Wilde |language=de |work=laut.de |publisher=Laut AG |access-date=21 April 2011}}</ref>  Wilde released her next album, ''[[Love Moves]]'', in 1990. The album barely made the UK Top 40, and, although it was a Top 10 success in Scandinavian countries, it failed to sell as well as its predecessor and only spawned two minor hits, "[[It's Here]]" a Top 20 success in Middle and Northern Europe as well as "[[Can't Get Enough (Of Your Love)]]", her last Top 20 hit in France. She toured Europe again, this time opening for fellow Briton [[David Bowie]].<ref name="laut" />

A collaboration with [[Rick Nowels]], who had produced hits for [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Belinda Carlisle]], resulted in the guitar-driven pop of the single "[[Love Is Holy]]" and the album ''[[Love Is (Kim Wilde album)|Love Is]]'' (1992). The album's success was again limited to a small number of countries, though the single became another Top 20 hit in the UK,<ref name="OOC1992">{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1992/ |title=Top 40 Official UK Singles Archive: 1992 |work=[[UK Singles Charts|Official charts]] |access-date=20 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528135133/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1992 |archive-date=28 May 2011 }}</ref> and the second single ("[[Heart Over Mind (song)|Heart Over Mind]]") also made the top 40.<ref name="OOC1992" /> In 1993, she released her first official compilation album ''[[The Singles Collection 1981–1993]]'', which was a success throughout Europe and Australia and the dancefloor-influenced single "[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]" (a cover of the [[Yvonne Elliman]] song from the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' that was penned by the [[Bee Gees]]), became her last UK Top 20 Hit as well as a number 3 hit in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Kim+Wilde&titel=If+I+Can%27t+Have+You&cat=s |title=Kim Wilde – If I Can't Have You (song) |website=Australian-charts.com |publisher=Hung Medien |access-date=21 April 2011}}</ref>

Wilde embarked on a huge "Greatest Hits" concert tour through Europe in 1994 and also toured Australia and Japan for the first time in six years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Her next album, ''[[Now & Forever (Kim Wilde album)|Now & Forever]]'' (1995), was a commercial failure worldwide.<ref name="laut" /> Her single "[[Breakin' Away (song)|Breakin' Away]]", however, was a minor hit, and the follow-up, "This I Swear", was also a minor hit in Europe.<ref name="musicline-singles">{{cite web |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/WILDE%2C+KIM/single |title=Chartverfolgung / WILDE, KIM / Single |language=de |website=Musicline.de |publisher=PHONONET GmbH |access-date=20 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129094100/http://musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/WILDE,+KIM/single |archive-date=29 November 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She released a single "Shame" in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Kim-Wilde-Shame/master/50678 |title=Kim Wilde – Shame |work=[[Discogs]] |access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref> From February 1996 to February 1997, Wilde appeared in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] production of the [[Musical theatre|musical]], ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]''.<ref>{{cite episode|url=http://www.swr.de/swr1/rp/programm/leute/-/id=446530/nid=446530/did=2703898/1y66e4l/index.html |title=Kim Wilde |series=Leute |language=de |network=[[Südwestrundfunk]] |station=SWR1 |airdate=1 November 2007 |access-date=20 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018221204/http://www.swr.de/swr1/rp/programm/leute/-/id%3D446530/nid%3D446530/did%3D2703898/1y66e4l/index.html |archive-date=18 October 2012 }}</ref> After this, Wilde started recording a new album. However, there were problems with her record company – MCA Records had by that time become part of Universal Music – and legal problems concerning the songs. Subsequently, Wilde abandoned the album which remains unreleased.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 2006, Wilde signed a new [[record deal]] with EMI Germany and released the first single from her tenth studio album in many countries across Europe, Scandinavia and Asia.

==Gardening career==
During her first [[pregnancy]], an old interest in gardening resurfaced and she attended [[Capel Manor]] college to learn about [[horticulture]], so as to create a garden for her children.
