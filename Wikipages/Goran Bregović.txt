'''Goran Bregović''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Горан Бреговић}}; born 22 March 1950) is a recording artist from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].{{refn|group="nb"|Goran Bregović was born in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|PR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a republic of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. His father was an ethnic Croat, while his mother Serb.<ref>{{cite web|title=Otac mi je bio Hrvat, majka Srpkinja, moja žena je muslimanka. U koga da uperim pušku?

A [[Sarajevo]] native, Bregović started out with [[Kodeksi]] and [[Jutro]], but rose to prominence as the main creative mind and lead guitarist of [[Bijelo Dugme]], widely considered one of the most popular and influential recording acts ever to exist in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After Bijelo Dugme split up, he embarked on several critically and commercially successful projects, and started composing film scores. Among his better known film scores are three of [[Emir Kusturica]]'s films (''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'', ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' and ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]''). For ''Time of the Gypsies'', Bregović won a [[Golden Arena for Best Film Music|Golden Arena Award]] at the [[Pula Film Festival]] in 1990, among other awards. He had also composed for the [[Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' and the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]]-entered film ''[[The Serpent's Kiss]]''.

Bregović, during his five-decade long career, has composed for critically acclaimed singers, including [[Sezen Aksu]], [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Šaban Bajramović]], [[George Dalaras]] and [[Cesária Évora]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Sarajevo]], [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|PR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]] to a [[Croats|Croat]] father Franjo Bregović and [[Serbs|Serb]] mother Borka Perišić,<ref>[http://www.yurope.com/nasa-borba/arhiva/Maj97/1805/1805_15.HTM Strogo kontrolisano disidentstvo];''Naša Borba'', 18 May 1997</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.goranbregovic.rs/biography/|title=Goran Bregovic|website=www.goranbregovic.rs|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Goran grew up with two younger siblings — sister Dajana and brother Predrag. Their father was from the Croatian region of [[Prigorje]], specifically [[Sveti Petar Čvrstec]] village near [[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]], while their mother was born in [[Virovitica]] to parents that had shortly before her birth arrived in the nearby village of [[Čemernica, Croatia|Čemernica]], settling there from the village of [[Kazanci]] near [[Gacko]] in eastern [[Herzegovina]]. Goran's maternal grandfather fought in the [[Royal Serbian Army]] at the [[Macedonian front|Salonica Front]] during [[World War I]] and as a reward received land in [[Slavonia]] where he soon moved his family.<ref name="vreme-dec-2012">{{cite news|last1=Grujić|first1=Nenad|last2=Nikčević|first2=Tamara|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1090566|title=Cigani, juriš!|agency=[[Vreme]]|date=27 December 2012|access-date=6 September 2015}}</ref>

Goran's parents met shortly after [[World War II]] in Virovitica where his mother Borka lived and his father Franjo (who fought on the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] side during the war) attended a [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) military school.<ref name="vreme-dec-2012"/> Franjo Bregović soon got his first job, teaching [[ballistics]] at a military school in Sarajevo, so the couple that at the time moved there.<ref name="vreme-dec-2012"/> Goran, their first child, was born in 1950 in Sarajevo.

Goran was 10 years old when his parents divorced. In later interviews, he mentioned his father's alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of their marriage.<ref name="vreme-dec-2012"/> Soon after the split, his father moved to [[Livno]], taking Goran's younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno.<ref name="vreme-dec-2012"/> Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran's brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.<ref name="vreme-dec-2012"/>

Goran played violin in a [[music school]]. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran's mother bought him his first guitar in his early teens. Bregović wanted to enroll in a fine arts high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother's decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://business-review.eu/news/goran-bregovic-and-wedding-and-funeral-orchestra-in-concert-at-bucharest-on-friday-september-30-111651|title = Goran Bregovic and Wedding and funeral orchestra in concert at Bucharest on Friday, September 30|date = 6 July 2016}}</ref>

==Early career==
Upon entering high school, teenage Bregović joined the school band Izohipse where he began on bass guitar. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior – he crashed into a school-owned [[Mercedes-Benz]]). Bregović then entered grammar school and its school band Beštije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing [[folk music]] in a [[kafana]] in [[Konjic]], working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.

Spotting him at a Beštije gig in 1969, [[Željko Bebek]] invited eighteen-year-old Bregović to play bass guitar in his band [[Kodeksi]], which Goran gladly accepted.

===Kodeksi===
{{main|Kodeksi}}
Eventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregović moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregović, Željko Bebek, [[Zoran Redžić]] and [[Milić Vukašinović]]. All of them would eventually become members of [[Bijelo Dugme]] at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]]. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in the departure of Željko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in [[Naples]] and took them back to [[Sarajevo]].

===Jutro===
{{main|Jutro}}
Then, in the autumn of 1971, Bregović enrolled at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, [[Milić Vukašinović]] left for London, so Bregović formed a band with Nuno Arnautalić called [[Jutro]] (Morning), which Redžić soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to [[Bijelo Dugme]] ("White Button").

==Bijelo Dugme==
[[File:Bregovic - portret - 1980.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Bregović in 1980 during [[Bijelo Dugme]]'s new wave phase]]
{{main|Bijelo Dugme}}
From 1974 until 1989, Bregović played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind [[Bijelo Dugme]] (''White Button''). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. Just as with [[Jutro]] previously, he continued as Bijelo Dugme's undisputed leader and decision-maker as well as its public face in the Yugoslav print and electronic media once the band started taking off commercially.

Over the band's fifteen-year run, in addition to their enormous popularity at home, led by Bregović, Bijelo Dugme made several attempts at expanding their prominence abroad. In late 1975, while recording their second album ''[[Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu]]'' in [[London]], they additionally recorded an [[English language]] track called "Playing the Part" (translated version of their [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] track "Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu", itself an uncredited cover of [[Argent (band)|Argent]]'s 1972 track "I Am the Dance of Ages") that was packaged as a [[promo single]] for English music journalists. Never officially released for mass distribution, the track quickly fell into oblivion.

Bijelo Dugme had somewhat better luck with touring abroad, which almost entirely took place in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries as part of their respective [[cultural exchange]] programs with SFR Yugoslavia. The band briefly toured the [[Polish People's Republic]] during April 1977, a 9-concert leg as part of the tour in support of their third album ''[[Eto! Baš hoću!]]''.<ref name="novosti-dugme-poljska-jun-2005">{{cite news|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:277215-Skandal-u-Skenderiji|title=Skandal u "Skenderiji"|agency=[[Večernje novosti]]|date=8 June 2005|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref> During their 10-day Polish tour, the band played two concerts on back-to-back nights in [[Warsaw]], followed by [[Olsztyn]], [[Zielona Góra]], three shows on back-to-back days in [[Poznań]], and finally two shows on the same day in [[Kalisz]].<ref name="novosti-dugme-poljska-jun-2005"/> While in Poland, they also shot a 30-minute television special for [[TVP3 Katowice]], a regional [[Katowice]]-based branch of the state-owned [[Telewizja Polska]]. Later that year, following the tour that culminated in a triumphant open-air concert at [[Košutnjak#Hajdučka Česma|Hajdučka Česma]] in Belgrade, Bregović went to serve his mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) stint. Assigned to a unit based in [[Niš]], the twenty-seven-year-old reported for service on 3 November 1977 and would spend the following year away from music, a period during which the band was also on hiatus.<ref name="vlist-oct-2014">{{cite news|last=Bubalo|first=Robert|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/showbiz/na-uzivanje-droge-pozivali-su-me-bebek-i-bregovic-964274|title=Na uživanje droge pozivali su me Bebek i Bregović|agency=[[Večernji list]]|date=2 October 2014|access-date=13 November 2020}}</ref>

During early 1982, the band played in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] as representatives of the city of [[Sarajevo]] and SFR Yugoslavia, the site of the upcoming [[Winter Olympics]], as part of an event bringing together [[1976 Winter Olympics|past]] and [[1984 Winter Olympics|future]] Winter Olympic hosts.<ref name="novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005">{{cite news|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:277218-Tezga-u-Bugarskoj|title=Tezga u Bugarskoj|agency=[[Večernje novosti]]|date=11 June 2005|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref> On return to Yugoslavia from Innsbruck, the band had its equipment confiscated by the Yugoslav customs after [[customs declaration|undeclared]] musical equipment was found among their luggage.<ref name="novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005"/> Some six months after that, during summer 1982, Bijelo Dugme went on a tour of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], playing 41 shows throughout the country from 15 July until 31 August 1982.<ref name="novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005"/> Despite the tour in support of their latest studio album ''[[Doživjeti stotu]]'' being over for more than a year, and having no new material to promote, the band reportedly accepted the tour of Bulgaria in order to recover some of the funds lost after getting fined by the Yugoslav customs over the attempt to bring undeclared musical equipment into the country.<ref name="novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005"/>

In summer 1985, following a decade of continuous rejection for tours of the [[Soviet Union]] by the cultural [[attaché]] of the Soviet embassy in Yugoslavia, Bijelo Dugme was finally scheduled to play in [[Moscow]] on 28 July 1985, sharing the same bill with fellow Yugoslav rock act [[Bajaga i Instruktori]] at a huge open-air concert at [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] as part of the [[12th World Festival of Youth and Students]].<ref name="novosti-dugme-jun-2005">{{cite news|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:277220-Skandal-u-Moskvi|title=Skandal u Moskvi|agency=[[Večernje novosti]]|date=13 June 2005|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref> Ahead of the show, Bregović decided to sequester the band in [[Budva]] for two weeks in order to practice for the Moscow appearance, an indication of the seriousness with which they approached this particular concert.<ref name="novosti-dugme-jun-2005"/> However, once in Moscow, due to [[overcrowding]] and resulting safety concerns, the event got interrupted around 10 p.m. after the Bajaga i Instruktori set before Bijelo Dugme even had a chance to take the stage.<ref name="novosti-dugme-jun-2005"/> Two days later on 30 July 1985, instead at the marquee Gorky Park in central Moscow, Bijelo Dugme got to play the Dynamo Arena on the city outskirts at an unpopular noon-hour time slot.<ref name="novosti-dugme-jun-2005"/>

===Guest appearances, collaborations and business venture===
In between Bijelo Dugme's studio releases and tours, in-demand Bregović worked on various side projects in Yugoslavia. These included releasing a [[Goran Bregović (album)|solo record]] in 1976 and composing two movie soundtracks — 1977's ''Leptirov oblak'' and 1979's ''Lične stvari''.

He also tried his hand at music production, producing [[Idoli]]'s 1980 seven-inch single "[[Maljčiki]]" / "[[Retko te viđam sa devojkama]]" and co-producing, alongside [[Kornelije Kovač]], [[Zdravko Čolić]]'s fourth studio album ''[[Malo pojačaj radio]]'' in 1981.

Bregović furthermore made guest appearances on guitar on various studio recordings by different Yugoslav pop, folk, and rock acts: [[Neda Ukraden]]'s track "Tri djevojke" (together with Bijelo Dugme bandmates [[Vlado Pravdić]] and [[Zoran Redžić]]) off her 1976 album ''Ko me to od nekud doziva'', [[Hanka Paldum]]'s track "Zbog tebe" off her 1980 album ''[[Čežnja (album)|Čežnja]]'', "Ne da/ne nego i/ili" track by [[Kozmetika]] off their 1983 [[Kozmetika (album)|eponymous album]], Valentino's track "Pazi na ritam" off their 1983 debut album ''ValentiNo1'', [[Riblja Čorba]]'s track "Disko mišić" off their 1985 album ''[[Istina]]'', [[Dino Merlin|Merlin]]'s 1986 album ''[[Teško meni sa tobom (a još teže bez tebe)]]'', Mjesečari track "Gdje izlaziš ovih dana" off their 1988 album ''One šetaju od 1 do 2'', and [[Piloti (band)|Piloti]] track "Tiho, tiho" off their 1990 album ''Nek te Bog čuva za mene''.

During his time leading Bijelo Dugme, Bregović also became involved in the financial and organizational side of the [[music industry|music business]]. In 1984, dissatisfied with their respective financial terms at the state-owned [[Jugoton]] label, Bijelo Dugme bandleader Bregović and one of Yugoslavia's biggest pop stars Zdravko Čolić got together to establish their own music label Kamarad, which—via a deal with state-owned [[Diskoton]] and later another newly-established private label [[Komuna (company)|Komuna]]—would end up co-releasing all of Bijelo Dugme's subsequent studio albums including three of Čolić's studio albums from 1984 until 1990.<ref name="kamarad">{{cite news|last=Predić|first=Zoran|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2014/11/kako-su-zbog-kamarada-zdravka-colica-i.html|title=Čolić i Bregović protiv Jugotona|agency=RTV revija|date=November 1984|access-date=23 November 2019}}</ref> Considered an unusual move at the time in a communist country with nearly across-the-board public ownership that had just recently began allowing certain modes of private entrepreneurship, starting a privately-owned record label, combined with Bregović's and Čolić's high public profile in Yugoslavia, got them both a lot of additional attention in the country's press. The company was registered in [[Radomlje]] near [[Domžale]] in [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]].<ref>{{cite news|last=[[Anja Rupel|Rupel]]|first=[[Anja Rupel|Anja]]|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/zabava/glasba/zdravko-colic-clovek-mora-biti-ponosen-na-svoja-leta/343173|title=Zdravko Čolić: Človek mora biti ponosen na svoja leta.|agency=[[Radiotelevizija Slovenija]]|date=2 August 2014|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref> Due to not having its own production facilities and distribution network, the new label entered into a co-releasing agreement with Diskoton thus essentially functioning as the legal entity that holds the licensing rights to the works of Bijelo Dugme and Zdravko Čolić.<ref name="kamarad"/> Kamarad's debut co-release was Čolić's 1984 studio album ''[[Ti si mi u krvi]]'' followed by Bijelo Dugme's [[Bijelo Dugme (album)|self-titled studio album]] later that year with new vocalist [[Mladen Vojičić Tifa|Mladen "Tifa" Vojičić]]. The label would also co-release many of Dugme's and Čolić's later 'best of' compilations in addition to Bregović's movie soundtrack albums as well as [[Vesna Zmijanac]]'s 1992 album ''Ako me umiriš sad''.

==Solo career==
[[Image:Goran Bregovic 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bregović performing at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City on 19 October 2011]]
At the time Bijelo Dugme was falling apart, Goran entered the world of [[Film score|film music]]. His first project was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'' (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by [[Iggy Pop]]) for Emir's next film ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for [[Patrice Chéreau]]'s ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|Queen Margot]]'' was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The next year's [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] award went to ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', for which Goran Bregović composed the music.

In 1997, he worked with Turkish singer [[Sezen Aksu]] on her album ''Düğün ve Cenaze'' (''Wedding and Funeral''). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.

He made an album with [[George Dalaras]] in 1999 named ''[[Thessaloniki – Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes]]''. In the same year, Bregović recorded an album called ''[[Kayah i Bregović]]'' (Kayah and Bregović) with popular Polish singer [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]] which sold over 700,000 copies in [[Poland]] (seven times platinum record).

In 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, [[Krzysztof Krawczyk (singer)|Krzysztof Krawczyk]], titled "Daj mi drugie życie" ("Give Me Second Life").

In 2005, Bregović took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.

A number of works created by Bregović can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', most notably "Đurđevdan". The film itself actually features more Bregović samples than the soundtrack.

Two musical numbers by Bregović, "Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke," and "Gas, Gas" were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian telenovela, ''[[Salve Jorge]]'', on the television network [[Rede Globo]].<ref name="Salve Jorge Tracklist">{{cite web|title=Salve Jorge (Trilha Sonora da Novela) [|url=http://musica.com.br/trilhas-sonoras/salve-jorge.html|publisher=Musica.com.br|access-date=16 November 2012}}</ref>

===Wedding and Funeral Orchestra===
[[Image:Goran Bregovic in Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bregović at concert in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia on 3 October 2007]]
For many years Bregović performed with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from [[Belgrade]], women wearing traditional Bulgarian costumes, and [[Romani people|Roma]] singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.

Since 1998, and until about 2012, Bregović has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Wedding and Funeral Orchestra. This consists of 10 people (in the small version) or 37 (in the large version, although, in some instances, this number varies, depending on participants from the host country).

Since 2012 the orchestra consists of 9 people (in the small version) or 19 (in the large version), as it played in New York at the Lincoln Center on 15 and 16 July 2016.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160810225129/http://www.lincolncenterfestival.org/assets/img/downloads/07-15%20Goran.pdf Brochure for the concert in New York (PDF)]</ref>

The small orchestra consists of Muharem "Muki" Rexhepi (vocals, drums), Bokan Stanković (first trumpet), Dragić Velićović (second trumpet), Stojan Dimov (sax, clarinet), Aleksandar Rajković (first trombone, glockenspiel), Miloš Mihajlović (second trombone), female vocals Bulgarian singers [[Daniela Radkova|Daniela Radkova-Aleksandrova]] and [[Lyudmila Radkova|Lyudmila Radkova-Traykova]], and Goran himself. 
The large orchestra includes also string quartet: Ivana Mateijć (first violin), Bojana Jovanović-Jotić (second violin), Saša Mirković (viola), and Tatjana Jovanović-Mirković, as well as sextet of male voices: Dejan Pesić (first tenor), Milan Panić and Ranko Jović (second tenors), Aleksandar Novaković (baritone), Dušan Ljubinković and Siniša Dutina (basses).

In previous years, in the orchestra the following musicians have performed: Ogi Radivojević and [[Alen Ademović]] (vocals, drums), Dalibor Lukić (second trumpet), Dejan Manigodić (tuba), Vaska Jankovska (vocals).

In 2013, as part of his Asia-Pacific tour (including Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong), Bregović performed with a string quartet, a male choir, Bulgarian singers and half of a brass band. The other part of the brass band – including bass and percussions – were being played from his computer. In 2017, he was a guest artist on Puerto Rican rapper [[Residente]]'s album ''Residente'' on the song "El Futuro Es Nuestro" (Spanish for "The Future is Ours").

===Eurovision===
During the [[Eurovision 2008]] final in [[Belgrade Arena]], Serbia, he played as the interval act.<ref>{{YouTube|PF8gVaEHnRI}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>
He also composed the Serbian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010; 'Ovo Je Balkan' sung by [[Milan Stanković]].

==Musical style==
Bregović's compositions, extending Balkan musical inspirations to innovative extremes, draw upon European classicism and Balkan rhythms.<ref>Lincoln Center Festival website</ref>

Bregović's music carries: [[Yugoslav music|Yugoslav]], [[Bulgarian music|Bulgarian]], [[Romani music|Romani]], [[Greek music|Greek]], [[Romanian music|Romanian]], [[Albanian music|Albanian]], [[Music of Italy|Italian]], [[Turkish music|Turkish]] and [[Music of Poland|Polish]] themes and is a fusion of [[popular music]], with traditional [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] music from the Balkans, [[tango music|tango]] and [[Balkan Brass Band|brass band]]s.

==Personal life==

With Bijelo Dugme's mid-1970s breakout commercial success and Bregović's increased public profile in Yugoslavia, details of his lifestyle and romantic relationships also became fodder for the country's press. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, various Yugoslav print media outlets documented his high-profile relationship with Serbian model Ljiljana Tica who reportedly inspired his song "Bitanga i princeza" off Bijelo Dugme's [[Bitanga i princeza|eponymous 1979 album]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Živković|first=A.|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2014/05/ljiljana-tica-mozda-je-ovo-prilika-da.html|title=Liljana Tica, najpopularnija YU manekenka: Ovo je prilika da razjasnim mnoge neistine o meni...|agency=ITD magazin|date=May 1983|access-date=7 December 2019}}</ref>

In 1993, Bregović married his long-time girlfriend Dženana Sudžuka, a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] model.{{sfn|Glas javnosti|2000}} The wedding ceremony held in Paris featured film director [[Emir Kusturica]] as the groom's [[best man]] and longtime Bijelo Dugme backing vocal Amila Sulejmanović as the bride's [[bridesmaid|maid of honour]].

The couple has three daughters: Ema (born in March 1995), Una (February 2002), and Lulu (May 2004).

During mid-1971, while studying at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, twenty-one-year-old Bregović got accepted into the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist League]] (SKJ), the only party in SFR Yugoslavia's [[One-party state|political system]].<ref name="vlist-sept-2014">{{cite news|last=Bubalo|first=Robert|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/showbiz/bebek-je-prvi-otkrio-bregovica-trazio-je-basista-za-svoj-bend-kodeksi-i-pronasao-klinca-koji-se-kreveljio-964033|title=Bebek je prvi otkrio Bregovića.

Throughout the mid-to-late 1970s, by now a famous rock musician in SFR Yugoslavia, Bregović often publicly expressed his support for [[communism]] and the importance of being active in the party.<ref name="ven-dec-1976"/>

In 1990, ahead of the [[1990 Bosnian general election|general elections]] in the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]] constituent unit of SFR Yugoslavia, Bregović publicly expressed his support for [[Ante Marković]]'s [[Union of Reform Forces of Yugoslavia]] (SRSJ), a centre-left social-democrat political party opposing ethnic nationalism and advocating for reform of Yugoslav communism into liberal market capitalism. He furthermore participated in their 1990 election campaign, contributing to it in creative capacity.<ref>{{cite news|last=Karuza|first=Vesna|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2019/06/bregovic-podrzava-antu-markovica-manje.html|title=Kad sam bio bijelo dugme|agency=Svijet|date=1990|access-date=7 October 2019}}</ref> Despite securing public support and endorsements from many prominent public figures in SR Bosnia and Herzegovina such as [[Emir Kusturica]], [[Nele Karajlić]], [[Branko Đurić]], etc., the party got only 8.9% of the total vote.

In the years following the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], Bregović has described himself as [[Yugonostalgic]].{{sfn|Glas javnosti|2000}} In 2009, he stated: "Yugoslavia is the intersection of so many worlds: Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim. With music, I don't have to represent anyone, except myself – because I speak the first language of the world, the one everyone understands: music."<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2009/06/goran_bregovic_to_perform_at_p.html Goran Bregovic to perform at PlayhouseSquare]</ref>
