The band consisted of Ezra Furman ([[vocals]], [[guitar]]), Job Mukkada ([[bass guitar]]), Drew "Adam" Abrutyn ([[Drum kit|drums]]), and Andrew Langer ([[guitar]]). They formed at [[Tufts University]] in 2006. They released four albums: the self-released ''Beat Beat Beat'' (2006), followed by ''[[Banging Down the Doors]]'' (2007), ''[[Inside the Human Body]]'' (2008) and ''[[Mysterious Power]]'' (2011).
