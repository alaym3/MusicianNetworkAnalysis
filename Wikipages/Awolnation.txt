==History==
===Creation, ''Back from Earth'' (2009–2010)===
Aaron Bruno was approached by [[Red Bull Records]] in 2009, asking if he wanted free use of the Red Bull recording studio in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2011/04/13/awolnation-megalithic-symphony/ |title=Awolnation Delight Fans With 'Wild,' Punk-Influenced Shows - Exclusive Video |publisher=Spinner |date=2011-04-13 |access-date=2012-10-02}}</ref><ref name="redbull">{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Profile/AWOLNATION--LosAngelesStudioProfiles--RedBull-021242862439893 |title=Sorry... |publisher=Red Bull USA |access-date=2012-10-02}}</ref> He recorded a few songs in the studio and ultimately signed with the label, calling it more of a "partnership", and was allowed to make the recordings that he wanted. Bruno has been with numerous bands before he created Awolnation, including Home Town Hero with Drew Stewart and Under the Influence of Giants with Dave Amezcua. Bruno writes all of his songs himself, but confides in close friends and family or respected artists for guidance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://puregrainaudio.com/interviews/interview-with-awolnation-s-aaron-bruno |title=Interview with Awolnation musician Aaron Bruno|website=Puregrainaudio.com |date=2011-07-08 |access-date=2012-10-02}}</ref> The band released their first EP ''[[Back from Earth]]'' on May 18, 2010.<ref name="itunes">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/back-from-earth-ep/id371362362 |title=iTunes Store |publisher=itunes.apple.com |access-date=2012-10-02}}</ref> The name Awolnation is derived from Aaron Bruno's high school nickname. In an interview with Kristin Houser of the LA Music Blog, he stated that he "would leave without saying goodbye" because it was just easier, so that's where the name AWOL (slang from the military acronym for [[AWOL|Absent Without Leave]]) came from."<ref name="lamb">{{cite web|url=http://lamusicblog.com/2010/09/interview/interview-with-aaron-bruno-of-awolnation/ |title=Interview with Aaron Bruno of Awolnation |publisher=LA Music Blog |access-date=2012-10-02}}</ref>

In 2015, three singles were released for the album: its lead single, "[[Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf)]]", on January 26, "Windows" on March 3, and "I Am" on May 17.

The band released their second studio album, ''[[Run (Awolnation album)|Run]]'', on March 17, 2015. The album received polarizing but positive reviews, and the band received its first Metacritic review; with the album getting an aggregated 68 out of 100, from 6 critics.

On April 7, 2015, they made an appearance on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teamcoco.com/schedule/2015-04-06/tuesday/awolnation|title=Team Coco|website=teamcoco.com|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>

In September 2015, Bruno said that long-time guitarist Drew Stewart had left the band to spend time with his family. He was replaced by Irontom guitarist Zach Irons (son of former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Pearl Jam]] and [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]] drummer [[Jack Irons]]).

On December 1, 2015, Awolnation released a B-side track from ''Run'' named "Wichita Panama" for the [[Red Bull Records]] "Red Bull 20-Before-16" December event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://20before16.redbull.com/awolnation/|title=Red Bull|website=Red Bull|access-date=2 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417063617/http://20before16.redbull.com/awolnation/|archive-date=2016-04-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> Later, in February 2016, Awolnation released the videoclip for the song "Woman Woman" for the [[Red Bull Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/en/music/stories/1331778062328/watch-the-new-woman-woman-video-from-awolnation|title=AWOLNATION reveal all in new Woman Woman video|last=Ferris|first=Glen|date=22 February 2016|website=Red Bull Records|access-date=27 July 2016}}</ref>

In 2015, a music kit for the video game [[Counter Strike: Global Offensive]] was released called I Am. The kit includes songs from both Run and Megalithic Symphony.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://redbullrecords.com/csgo/awolnation/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-02 |archive-date=2017-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901215714/http://redbullrecords.com/csgo/awolnation/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Awolnation would be an opening act along with [[Pvris|PVRIS]] to [[Fall Out Boy]]’s tour, Wintour is Coming. They played February 26, 2016 through March 27, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tyler|last=Sharp|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/fall_out_boy_announce_headlining_tour_with_pvris_awolnation|title=Fall Out Boy announce headlining tour with PVRIS, Awolnation|publisher=Altpress|date=October 12, 2015|access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref>

On June 20, 2016, the band announced that it was cancelling many dates of its summer headlining tour so it could serve as the opening band for the Prophets of Rage tour. This announcement was met with consternation and upset by many of the band's fans, many of whom took to the band's Facebook page to express their anger at the fact that some ticket purchases were non-refundable.

On July 8, 2016, Awolnation released an alternate version of ''Run'' named ''Run (Beautiful Things)'', where the repeating lyric "capable of doing terrible things" is replaced with "capable of doing beautiful things." The music video for this shows a person in a cloak with the AWOL helmet holding a purple lantern while emerging from the sea. At times, the scene cuts away to a mermaid with the person as she swims away at the lyric "run."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://radio.com/2016/07/08/awolnation-video-run-beautiful-things/|title=AWOLNATION Release Video for 'Run (Beautiful Things)'|last=Wicks|first=Amanda|date=8 July 2016|website=Radio.com|access-date=27 July 2016}}</ref>

During the tour with Prophets of Rage, Zach Irons left the tour during the second leg to tour with IRONTOM. In his absence, original guitarist Christopher Thorn replaced Zach on a handful of shows starting in Tampa on October 1, 2016. This would mark the first time Thorn played with the band since around March 2012.

Awolnation toured over 80+ plus dates in support of the album "Run" including multiple festival appearances and their own headlining tour that brought the band to Europe and South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/search?artist=5bd2d3c8&query=tour:(Run)|title=Search for setlists|website=Setlist.fm|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref>

===''Here Come the Runts'' and touring (2016–2019)===
In a late 2016 interview, Aaron said he had a vision for the next album's sound. "I think people are getting really burnt out on hearing robotic instrumentation..." He said guitar-driven songs should be brought back to the forefront. "It's been a little abandoned, and it seems like most labels have been chasing songs like 'Sail' and all the other songs that followed in its path."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/download/WhatsNewInterviewsAaronBrunoOfAwolnation/WhatsNewInterviewsAaronBrunoOfAwolnation.mp3|format=MP3|title=Sound file|website=Ia801508.us.archive.org|access-date=2017-08-02}}</ref>

By late 2016/early 2017, Awolnation had started posting cryptic messages to their various social media accounts in regards to a new album. The main theme of these posts seem to reference inspiration for new songs, recording new material, and the future of Awolnation. One of these photos was of Aaron sitting down on an amplifier with a guitar in his hands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BO9Ib9sgE7O/|title=Instagram post by Awolnation • Jan 7, 2017 at 7:43am UTC|website=Instagram|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref> Another was of Aaron and drummer Issac Carpenter with guitar in hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BRHk7c3A8sa/|title=Instagram post by AWOLNATION • Mar 2, 2017 at 2:07am UTC|website=Instagram|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref> Some of the hashtags included with these photos were #2017, #trilogy, #newalbum and #thesagacontinues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BO2ToSogjl_/|title=Instagram post by Awolnation • Jan 4, 2017 at 4:06pm UTC|website=Instagram|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref>

On February 7, 2017, bass player Marc Walloch posted a photo on Instagram of him in Aarons' personal home studio with producer [[Eric Stenman]], confirming his involvement in the work of a future album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.reddituploads.com/0840d42ca4a344a3803ee5576177c064?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=d51b608b1db0a8e16ff9b64f9855d7bb|title=Spill Sounds|website=I.reddituploads.com|access-date=2017-08-02}}</ref>

In March 2017, longtime keyboardist Kenny Carkeet announced his departure from the band to spend time working on material for his own electro-alternative band with former member of the band [[Eve 6]], Max Collins, called [[Fitness (band)|Fitness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awolnationbuilders.com/2/post/2017/03/kenny-carkeet-is-moving-on-to-new-adventures.html|title=Kenny Carkeet Is Moving On To New Adventures|website=Awolnation Builders|access-date=2 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802204036/http://awolnationbuilders.com/2/post/2017/03/kenny-carkeet-is-moving-on-to-new-adventures.html|archive-date=2 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Singer Aaron Bruno also took to e-mail to offer an update to fans on the state of the new album and the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awolnationbuilders.com/2/post/2017/03/a-message-from-aaron.html|title=A Message From Aaron|website=Awolnation Builders|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref>

While on tour with Twenty One Pilots, Aaron's home studio and much of his property were destroyed by fire. This event, as well as a shooting in nearby [[Thousand Oaks]] that claimed the life of 12 people, inspired Aaron to write the songs that would become the album ''[[Angel Miners & the Lightning Riders]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailynews.com/2020/05/14/awolnations-aaron-bruno-talks-tragedy-hope-and-releasing-music-during-a-pandemic/|title = Awolnation's Aaron Bruno talks tragedy, hope and releasing music during a pandemic|date = 14 May 2020}}</ref>
