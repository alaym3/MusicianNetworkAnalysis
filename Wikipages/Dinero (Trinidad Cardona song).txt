==Background==
Cardona initially recorded several songs in 2017, including "Dinero" and the viral hit "Jennifer", before he was signed to [[Island Records]]. After his first two albums failed to gain any substantial success,<ref name="Genius"/> Island dropped Cardona in 2018, after which he began working odd jobs while "remaining hopeful about his music career".<ref name="Billboard"/> While working as a food delivery driver in early 2021, Cardona wrote down on a [[vision board]] that he wanted to go viral on TikTok: "Don't know how, don't know what. And boom, manifestations."<ref name="Billboard"/> Two months later, his family alerted him that "Dinero" was going viral on TikTok, appearing in several dance challenges.<ref name="Genius"/> Dinero later re-signed with Island based on the success of the track.<ref name="Billboard"/>
