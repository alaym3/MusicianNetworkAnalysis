'''The Axis of Awesome''' was an Australian [[musical comedy]] act with members [[Jordan Raskopoulos]], Lee Naimo and Benny Davis, that performed from 2006 to 2018. The trio covered a wide variety of performance styles, and perform a combination of original material and pop parodies.

==History==
The Axis of Awesome formed in 2006, their name being a play on the phrase "[[axis of evil]]" used by United States [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]. The trio were heavily involved in [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] theatre at the [[University of Sydney]] and decided to try something different. The band played at a few stand-up comedy nights and improv events in Sydney and performed a fortnightly segment on [[FBi Radio]], but got their first big break when they released a number of rap parodies lampooning the [[2007 Australian Federal Election]].

The band gained further success performing in the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] and making television and radio appearances. Their 2008 Melbourne International Comedy Festival show, titled "The Axis of Awesome Comeback Spectacular", received a [[Moosehead Award]]. They took the show to the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] in 2008 where it was received with critical and audience acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/best-of-the-festival-2008/Comedy-Axis-of-Awesome-Comeback.4417124.jp|title=Comedy: Axis of Awesome Comeback Spectacular|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fest.theskinny.co.uk/article/93746-the-axis-of-awesome-comeback-spectacular |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120604053742/http://fest.theskinny.co.uk/article/93746-the-axis-of-awesome-comeback-spectacular |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 June 2012 |title=2008: The Axis of Awesome Comeback Spectacular - Fest - the ultimate guide to Edinburgh Festival reviews |accessdate=12 March 2017 }}</ref>

After the Edinburgh festival, the Axis of Awesome's song "4 Chords", a medley of 36 pop songs that all contain the same basic chord structure, received airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/nihal/archive.shtml|title=BBC - Radio 1 - Nihal Archive|last=BBC|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref> This airplay drove listeners to the internet and "4 Chords" went viral, receiving millions of hits on [[YouTube]]. The success on YouTube prompted increased interest, both home and abroad, and the Axis performed the song on many radio and television programs, including [[Nova 96.9]], [[Triple M]], ''[[The Footy Show (rugby league)|The Footy Show]]'', ''[[Good News Week]]'' and ''[[9am with David & Kim]]''.

In April 2009, the Axis of Awesome performed at The [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] with a new show, The Axis of Awesome vs Bee.<ref>[http://www.comedyfestival.com.au/season/2009/show/the-axis-of-awesome-vs-bee/ The Axis of Awesome vs Bee | Melbourne International Comedy Festival - 1-26 April 2009<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304150711/http://www.comedyfestival.com.au/season/2009/show/the-axis-of-awesome-vs-bee |date=4 March 2009 }}</ref> The show wove the band's songs into a narrative involving a giant bee. The Axis of Awesome vs Bee was also performed at the Sydney Comedy Festival (formerly The Cracker Comedy Festival) in May 2009.

The Axis toured regional Queensland and New South Wales as part of The Melbourne Comedy festival roadshow and performed at the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150925113615/http://www.adelaidefestivalcentre.com.au/adelaidecabaret/archive/2009/index58e5.html?view=CatalogMgr&catalog=220&item=182512 2009 Adelaide Cabaret Festival - 5th - 20th June 2009<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in May and June. They returned to The Edinburgh fringe in August with a new sell-out show "The Axis of Awesome: Infinity Rock Explosion" and appeared at the [[World's Funniest Island]] festival in Sydney in October.

In February 2010, the Axis of Awesome released their second album ''Infinity Rock Explosion!'' and performed sold out seasons at The Adelaide Fringe Festival, The Melbourne International Comedy Festival, The Sydney Comedy Festival and The Singapore Flipside Festival. They received The Time Out award for best local talent at the Sydney comedy festival and recorded their first DVD, ''The Axis of Awesome Live'' which was released in Australia on 6 October 2010 by Punchline and Beyond Entertainment.

They returned to the Edinburgh Festival again in 2014 with their new show "Viva La Vida Loca Las Vegas".

In February 2016, Jordan publicly [[coming out of the closet|came out]] as transgender.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/15/axis-of-awesome-comedian-jordan-raskopoulos-on-being-transgender-i-never-felt-right-as-a-boy|title=Axis of Awesome comedian Jordan Raskopoulos on being transgender: 'I never felt right as a boy'|first=Steph|last=Harmon|date=15 February 2016|accessdate=12 March 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref> She was pleasantly surprised by the "overwhelmingly positive" public reaction. Their album released that year, ''Viva La Vida Loca Las Vegas'', features a cover of "Transgender Dysphoria Blues" by [[Against Me!]].

In August 2018, the band announced on Facebook that they would no longer be performing together as The Axis of Awesome.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Axis of Awesome |url=https://www.facebook.com/AxisOfAwesome/posts/10155327637621652?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC3a1JOjEkKNbc4tVcYhzeeBTE0Y5I-in4f1yMW-JpfNmmRHwOe5JM8PrkCrhd6nI2dkaPgqSh4jWPq7ixyQNbWE1VcGHXac59UtFbwgeRs2OQgLCQsi8WfvzSDxs5Rk__a_yHEpptiJh-nDgJ29sGunChrV6glVaioonrpZB7oGbcyYXxnNpMuD6oRf34mQe9GO3xdZQsZcVt159S3Hz9u6ePviN5XqWSpWo3SD37Y4y3IFvwU2TZa74Hbp0qmcNvM0VZ3bN6guowOWww8ybbcwQbh1C0ZgA1O3-X_c2pPCCxTulnNW-PizVkdS3VtPnHe8L8Q-pScFw&__tn__=-R |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=22 December 2018 |date=6 August 2018 |quote=In March last year, after a decade of touring the world singing our silly songs we decided to take a break and now we've decided to make that break permanent.

She explained that she still wished the band were together performing, but people grow and change over time and a decade together is a long time.

=="Four Chords"==
"Four Chords" is the Axis of Awesome's best-known work. It is a medley of popular songs, set to the [[I–V–vi–IV progression]].<ref name="Lynskey">{{cite news |first=Dorian |last=Lynskey |date=17 December 2010 |title=Don't Stop Believin': the power ballad that refused to die |work=[[The Guardian]]|page=3 (Film & music) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/16/dont-stop-believin-2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref> Many of the songs selected do not actually follow this four-chord progression, and some of the ones that do only include it briefly.  Since these four chords are played as an [[ostinato]], the band also uses a vi–IV–I–V, usually from the song "[[Save Tonight]]" to the song "[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]". The band plays the song in the key of D (E in the live performances on [[YouTube]]), so the progression they use is D–A–Bm–G (E, B, C#m, A on the live performances). Most of the songs have been transposed from their original keys.

The band continually vary the songs comprising the medley, often incorporating new releases. The Axis' song "Birdplane" (itself a parody of the [[Five for Fighting]] song "[[Superman (It's Not Easy)|Superman]]") is always included, as well as Australian folk song "[[Waltzing Matilda]]" and "[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]" by the Australian band [[Men at Work]]. The medley usually starts with [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s "[[Don't Stop Believin']]". The song always concludes with the chorus of "[[Scar (song)|Scar]]" (by [[Missy Higgins]]), except with the final line changed from "Could you leave me with a scar?" to "That's all it takes to be a star" (referring to the four chords themselves).

On 20 July 2011, the Axis of Awesome released an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ official music video] for "Four Chords" on their [[YouTube]] channel.
