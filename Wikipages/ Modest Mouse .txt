'''Modest Mouse''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1992 in [[Issaquah, Washington]], and currently based in [[Portland, Oregon]]. The founding members are lead singer/guitarist [[Isaac Brock (musician)|Isaac Brock]], drummer [[Jeremiah Green]], and bassist [[Eric Judy]]. Strongly influenced by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[XTC]], and [[Talking Heads]], the band rehearsed, rearranged, and recorded demos for almost two years before finally signing with small-town indie label [[K Records]] and releasing numerous singles.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/72297]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Since their 1996 debut album, ''[[This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About]]'', the band's lineup has mostly centered on Brock and Green, undergoing multiple changes. The band achieved mainstream success with their fourth album, ''[[Good News for People Who Love Bad News]]'' (2004), and its singles "[[Float On (Modest Mouse song)|Float On]]" and "[[Ocean Breathes Salty]]". Judy performed on every Modest Mouse album until his departure in 2012. [[Guitar]]ist [[Johnny Marr]] (formerly of [[the Smiths]]) joined the band in 2006, shortly following [[percussion]]ist [[Joe Plummer]] (formerly of [[the Black Heart Procession]]) and multi-instrumentalist [[Tom Peloso]], to work on the album ''[[We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank]]'' (2007). Guitarist [[Jim Fairchild]] joined the band in 2009. The band's sixth album, ''[[Strangers to Ourselves]]'', was released on March 17, 2015. Their seventh album, ''[[The Golden Casket]]'', released on June 25, 2021.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years: 1992–1999 ===
When Isaac Brock was a teenager, he was employed at a local family video store just outside Seattle. This is where he met bassist [[Eric Judy]]. Brock and Judy later discovered drummer [[Jeremiah Green]],<ref name="Carpenter, Susan 2004">Carpenter, Susan. "THE ARTS; POP MUSIC; from Modest Beginnings ...; nearly 15 Years from its Seattle Grunge Origins, Modest Mouse's Career has Taken a Mighty Turn". Los Angeles TimesMar 18 2004. ProQuest. Web. 20 July 2015.</ref> who also resided near Seattle, at a heavy metal show, at which point they decided to make music together. In 1994, at [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]]'s Dub Narcotic Studios, Modest Mouse recorded its first [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?]]'', which was released by [[K Records]]. This was followed by a single, "[[Broke (Modest Mouse song)|Broke]]", recorded by Steve Wold (a.k.a. bluesman [[Seasick Steve]]) under [[Sub Pop]] records at Moon Studios in [[Olympia, Washington]]. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, ''[[Sad Sappy Sucker]]'', but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before the band made its way into the pop music world in 2004, many of Modest Mouse's tours included stops at DIY/punk venues.

After moving to [[Up Records]],<ref>"[http://epitonic.com/artists/modest-mouse/ Modest Mouse]" [bio]. ''[[Epitonic]]''. epitonic.com. Retrieved 2017-05-07.</ref> Modest Mouse released two full-length albums and other recordings including the 1996 LP ''[[This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About]]''. Steve Wold also recorded and produced this album (and at the time was assisting in the recordings as well, but was not officially part of the band) along with the next offering, ''[[Interstate 8 (album)|Interstate 8]]''. The 1997 album, ''[[The Lonesome Crowded West]]'' (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) served as the band's breakthrough. ''The Lonesome Crowded West'' gained the band a [[cult following]], and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=McMurray|editor-first= Jacob|title=Taking Punk to the Masses: From Nowhere to Nevermind: a Visual History from the Permanent Collection of Experience Music Project|publisher=Fantagraphics Books|location=Seattle|year=2011|isbn=9781606994337|oclc=1065713061}}</ref> During this time, Nick Kraft became involved with the task of refining the band's sound. Prior to its release, the band had recorded the EP ''[[The Fruit That Ate Itself]]''. In 2000, Up Records released a singles and rarities collection entitled ''[[Building Nothing Out of Something]]'' that included the entirety of ''Interstate 8'' except for the songs "Edit the Sad Parts" and "Buttons to Push the Buttons".

=== Critical success: 2000–2002 ===
In 2000, Modest Mouse released ''[[The Moon & Antarctica]]'', its first album on [[Epic Records]]. The album, produced by [[Califone]]'s Brian Deck during five months of sessions in Chicago,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sentireascoltare.com/artisti/modest-mouse/|title=Modest Mouse biography |publisher=sentireascoltare.com |date=2015-03-01|first=Edoardo|last=Bridda|language=it}}</ref> was met with critical acclaim,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/modestmouse/moonandantarctica |title=Modest Mouse: The Moon & Antarctica (2000): Reviews |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=2009-12-15 |access-date=2011-07-15}}</ref> including a 9.8/10 score from online music magazine [[Pitchfork Media]], despite concerns about releasing material on a major label.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5358-the-moon-antarctica/ |title=Pitchfork: Album Reviews: Modest Mouse: The Moon & Antarctica |publisher=Pitchforkmedia.com |date=2000-06-13 |access-date=2010-09-08}}</ref> The album would later receive further acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.16477 |title=Pitchfork's Top 100 Albums of 2000–2004 |publisher=Listology |access-date=2011-07-15}}</ref>

The band licensed "Gravity Rides Everything" for a [[Nissan Quest]] [[minivan]] advertisement, a move that Brock has publicly acknowledged as blatantly commercial but necessary to achieve financial stability. Regarding the commercial, Brock stated, "People who don't have to make their living playing music can bitch about my principles while they spend their parents' money or wash dishes for some asshole."<ref>{{cite web|last=Modell |first=Josh |url=https://avclub.com/content/node/23015 |title=Modest Mouse |publisher=The A.V.

In 2001, Modest Mouse released the EP ''[[Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks]]'', a collection of unused songs from the recording sessions of ''The Moon & Antarctica''. In 2002, the band joined [[Cake (band)|Cake]], [[De La Soul]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[The Hackensaw Boys]] and [[Kinky (band)|Kinky]] on the [[Unlimited Sunshine Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/music/reviews/unlimited-sunshine-tour-1200546853/|title=Unlimited Sunshine Tour|website=Variety.com|access-date=26 June 2021}}</ref>

=== Mainstream success, Johnny Marr joins the band: 2003–2009 ===
[[File:Modest Mouse UPT.jpg|alt=Shows members of Modest Mouse performing in concert|right|thumb|200x200px|Modest Mouse performing live in 2007]]
In March 2003, [[Jeremiah Green|Green]] left the band after suffering a [[nervous breakdown]];<ref name = "SeattleTimes">{{Citation | last = Scanlon | first = Tom | title = Modest Mouse band of mellow mice | newspaper = The Seattle Times | date = April 13, 2007 | url = https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/modest-mouse-band-of-mellow-mice/ | access-date = 2010-10-11}}</ref> official reports stated he was leaving to work with his side project, [[Vells]]. The same year, he and Judy appeared on [[Adam Forkner]]'s first solo album, ''[[VVRSSNN]]''. Drummer [[Benjamin Weikel]] joined the band, replacing Green, along with [[The Murder City Devils|Murder City Devils]] guitarist [[Dann Gallucci]], who had previously played with Modest Mouse. Prior to starting the band's writing and recording process, Brock was devastated by the loss of "a couple of the most important people in my life," he said.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2004-03-18|title=From Modest beginnings ...|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-mar-18-wk-pop18-story.html|access-date=2020-07-20|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> Following these events, the band released their fourth album, ''[[Good News for People Who Love Bad News]]'', on April 6, 2004. The following August, the album was [[Platinum certification|certified Platinum]],<ref name="Carpenter, Susan 2004"/> having two hits with "[[Float On (Modest Mouse song)|Float On]]" and "[[Ocean Breathes Salty]]" (both of which they performed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on November 13, 2004).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://snl.jt.org/ep/|title=SNL Archives &#124; Episodes|website=Snl.jt.org|access-date=26 June 2021}}</ref> The album was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] that year, and "Float On" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]]. Later that year, Green returned to the band and Weikel returned to drumming exclusively for the Helio Sequence.

The public radio program [[Marketplace (radio program)|''Marketplace'']] used "Float On" as bumper music, which helped propel the group to a broader audience.

In 2006, [[Johnny Marr]] (formerly of [[The Smiths]]) joined the band after Gallucci quit amicably. Modest Mouse released their next album, ''[[We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank]]'', on March 20, 2007<ref>[http://www.modestmousemusic.com Music&nbsp;– Modest Mouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321024734/http://www.modestmousemusic.com/ |date=2007-03-21 }}.

The album also included bonus track and single "[[King Rat (song)|King Rat]]", which actor [[Heath Ledger]] had known about before the track was released; the band was formally introduced to the actor while on their 2007 tour in Australia. Ledger proposed an outline for a music video to the group, and with his film collective, [[The Masses (collective)|The Masses]], immediately began working on it once he had the band's approval.<ref name="nydaily-heath-film">{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/heath-ledger-music-videos-37th-birthday-article-1.2588029| first= BRIAN | last= LISI |  work=NEW YORK DAILY NEWS | date=2016-04-04 | title=Heath Ledger's sister says it took blessing from Michelle Williams to get new documentary made}}</ref> Upon Ledger's death in January 2008, the video remained unfinished.<ref>Ganz, Caryn.

Web. 21 July 2015.</ref> ''We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank'' was the first Modest Mouse album to reach No. 1 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts and had the hit single "[[Dashboard (song)|Dashboard]]", as well as "[[Missed the Boat]]" and "[[We've Got Everything]]". Modest Mouse released singles for the songs "[[Satellite Skin]]", "[[Autumn Beds]]" and "Perpetual Motion Machine" in limited edition—a total of 4,000 copies each—vinyl 7&nbsp;inches, featuring artwork by art director and illustrator Joshua Marc Levy, J. Alex Stamos, and [[Natasha Wheat]].

The band began a North American tour in June 2008. They returned to Florida, with three shows in Miami, Orlando and St. Augustine, for the first time since they were cut off stage early during the November 2006 Bang Music Festival show.<ref>[https://www.nme.com/news/modest-mouse/36403 NME news article], ''NME.com'', retrieved May 8, 2008</ref> Modest Mouse finished its tour supporting ''We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank'' after two years of promoting the record.

They then contributed a cover of the [[Buddy Holly]] song "[[That'll Be the Day]]" to the compilation ''[[Rave On Buddy Holly]]'', which was released on June 28, 2011. Modest Mouse played at [[Splendour in the Grass]] in [[Woodford, Queensland]] on July 29, 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/several-acts-ruled-out-for-splendour-in-the-grass-2015/|title=Several Acts Ruled Out For Splendour In The Grass 2015|publisher=MusicFeeds|access-date=24 June 2015}}</ref> and at [[The Warfield]] in [[San Francisco]] on January 25, 2012.

The lineup also included the additions of multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Lisa Molinaro, and percussionist Ben Massarella, the latter of whom previously played percussion on ''The Moon & Antarctica''.

In June of that same year, [[Pitchfork.tv]] released a 45-minute documentary on ''The Lonesome Crowded West'', which included archival footage taken during live performances and original recording/mix sessions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/46894-pitchforktv-presents-documentary-on-modest-mouses-the-lonesome-crowded-west/ |title=Pitchfork.tv Presents Documentary on Modest Mouse's The Lonesome Crowded West |access-date=2013-02-19 |date=2012-06-18 |publisher=Pitchforkmedia}}</ref>

===''Strangers to Ourselves'' & ''The Golden Casket'': 2015–present===
Eight years after the release of ''We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank'', Modest Mouse released ''[[Strangers to Ourselves]]'' on March 17, 2015. On December 13, 2014, the title and release date were confirmed to be in early 2015. Two days later, Modest Mouse released the lead single "Lampshades on Fire" which debuted on Twin Cities public radio station [[89.3 The Current]]. On December 16, 2014, Modest Mouse made ''Strangers to Ourselves'' available for pre-order for CD and LP formats on the [[Glacial Pace]] website and on the iTunes store. 

In 2015, Brock described the follow-up album to ''Strangers to Ourselves'' as being like a part two to the latter album that they would try to release as soon as legally possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/58793-modest-mouse-to-follow-strangers-to-ourselves-with-new-album-as-quickly-as-its-legally-allowed/ |title=Modest Mouse to Follow Strangers to Ourselves With New Album "As Quickly As It's Legally Allowed". |publisher=Pitchfork |access-date=2015-03-16}}</ref> The follow-up album has also been said to feature at least one song with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] bassist [[Krist Novoselic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/03/modest-mouses-next-album-due-out-in-2016-features-nirvanas-krist-novoselic/|title=Modest Mouse’s next album, due out in 2016, features Nirvana’s Krist Novoselic|website=Consequenceofsound.net|access-date=26 June 2021}}</ref> Throughout 2019, the band released three standalone singles; "Poison the Well" on March 29, "I'm Still Here" on April 18, and "Ice Cream Party" on November 15.

Modest Mouse released their seventh studio album, ''[[The Golden Casket]]'', on June 25, 2021.<ref name="kreps1">{{cite web |last1=Kreps |first1=Daniel |title=Modest Mouse Announce New Album 'The Golden Casket,' Drop 'We Are Between' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/modest-mouse-new-album-the-golden-casket-first-single-we-are-between-1165250/ |website=Rolling Stone |date=5 May 2021}}</ref> The album's first single, "We Are Between", was released on May 5,<ref name="kreps1"/> followed by its second single, “Leave a Light On”, released on May 24.

Richardson was particularly fond of the album's stripped-down finale, "Back to the Middle," which he noted "hints at what should be [the band's] next change-up: Keep it simple. If the songs are strong and the performances are there, guitar, bass and drums will be more than enough.<ref name="auto"/>
