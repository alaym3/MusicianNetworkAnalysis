== Early life ==
Bryant Myers was born in [[Puerto Rico]] in a neighborhood called Loma Alta. He grew up in what he describes as a hazardous environment (in the alleys and streets). "Sometimes we did not have breakfast or lunch, my mom could not buy me some sneakers, that made me want to make a lot of money to have my family well, and that my mother and my brother did not miss anything",<ref name="InfobaeLa">{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/teleshow/infoshow/2017/07/11/la-conmovedora-historia-de-vida-de-bryant-myers-el-pionero-del-trap/|title=La conmovedora historia de vida de Bryant Myers, el pionero del trap|trans-title=The moving life story of Bryant Myers, the pioneer of trap|website=Infobae|date=July 11, 2017|access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref> relates Bryant on an interview with [[Infobae]]. Bryant started writing songs in his home while he studied. He later left his studies in order to pursue his music career.

== Career ==
Bryant Myers' first hit "Esclava"<ref name="ElcorreoPolemico"/> put him on the radar with some well known [[reggaeton]] and urban artists, which allowed him to participate in a series of collaborations with charting artists. He followed it with "Esclava" (remix), featuring Anonimus (his cousin Luis Beauchamp), [[Anuel AA]] and Almighty. The latter track garnered over a million views on YouTube in less than three months. "Esclava" currently has 103&nbsp;million views (as of June 6, 2018). Follow-up [[Single (music)|singles]] "Tu Me Enamoraste" and its [[remix]] with Lary Over and [[Brytiago]], as well as "De Camino a Marte", performed just as well. He has continued to issue digital and video singles at a rate of at least one a month. In June 2016, he released "Vente Encima", featuring Anonimus, Noriel and Riko "El Bendecido", and guested on [[DJ Nelson]]'s "Volverte a Ver" and Noriel's "La Llamada" (remix). In July 2016, he was a featured guest on [[Farruko]]'s remix of his hit single "Ella y Yo" along with Almighty and Anuel AA, and "Esclava" was re-released as a digital download. His debut studio album, ''La Oscuridad'', was released on July 27, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8469389/bryant-myers-talks-new-album-changes-in-music-haters|title=Bryant Myers Talks New Album, Changes In His Style & Haters|website=Billboard}}</ref>

==Controversies==
On February 12, 2016, while Myers was traveling through Puerto Rico in a van with his manager and singers, the police stopped the van for a traffic violation. When they inspected the vehicle, they found a firearm and 40 rounds of ammunition. At the time of the arrest, Myers was a minor, and spent a night in a juvenile prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latidomusic.com/en/blog/ellos_son_los_artistas_urbanos_que_han_pasado_por_prision/|title=They are the urban artists who went through prison|date=August 10, 2017|website=Latido Music}}</ref>

On October 7, 2016, he featured on the song "[[Cuatro Babys]]" by [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]] featuring [[Noriel (rapper)|Noriel]] and [[Juhn]]. This song has been widely controversial over its lyrics as they arguably appear to suggest direct violence towards women. A petition was posted on [[Change.org]] demanding for the removal of the song from digital platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7603779/maluma-cuatro-babys-petition-response|title=Maluma Responds to Online Petition Against His Song 'Cuatro Babys'|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref> Despite this controversy, the popularity of "Cuatro Babys" has only risen with the song having gone quadruple Platinum. Because of this, Latin trap has had a large, but primarily underground, following.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/tainy-interview-reggaeton-719278/|title=How Puerto Rican Producer Tainy Became an Architect of Modern Reggaeton|first1=Elias|last1=Leight|date=12 September 2018|access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref>
