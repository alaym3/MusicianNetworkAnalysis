'''Wayne Watson''' (born October 5, 1954) is an American singer-songwriter in [[contemporary Christian music]]. Some of his songs have become CCM classics, including "Another Time, Another Place", "For Such a Time as This", "Friend of a Wounded Heart", "Touch of the Master's Hand", "New Lives for Old" and "Watercolour Ponies". He has won eight [[Gospel Music Association|GMA]] [[Dove Awards]].

==Career history==
Watson originally planned to pursue a career playing baseball, but while in college he began dabbling in music, and after graduation regularly performed in area churches. While leading worship at a Christian youth camp, the father of one of the children videotaped Watson's performance and sent it to a record company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=Wayne Watson Biography	|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p2432/biography|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref>

Watson's connection with his audience has to date{{when|reason=Give readers a date ("as of _____).|date=January 2020}} produced 23 No. 1 singles in Christian radio—including "Friend of a Wounded Heart", "When God's People Pray", "Almighty", "Be in Her Eyes", "Watercolour Ponies", "More of You", "Another Time, Another Place", and "Home Free" (which became the most played song on Christian radio in 1991).{{Citation needed |date=January 2020}}

His career credits include a dozen Dove Awards wins, including Male Vocalist of the Year in 1989, Song of the Year in that same year ("Friend of a Wounded Heart"), Pop Contemporary Song of the Year and Contemporary Album of The Year (1988) for ''Watercolour Ponies'', and Pop/Contemporary Song of the Year (1992) for "Home Free". He has twice been nominated for a Grammy Award—both for his performance of ''Watercolour Ponies'' (1987), and for Best Pop Gospel Album in 1992 for ''A Beautiful Place''.

In the 1990s, he performed "Another Time, Another Place" with fellow artist [[Sandi Patty]] on NBC-TV's ''[[The Tonight Show]]''—an event that was deemed{{According to whom|date=January 2020}} a defining moment in Christian music's move to wider audiences. In the late 1990s, his "For Such a Time as This" became a centerpiece theme of the CBS-TV series ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''.

Watson is retired after many years of serving as the associate director of music at Chapelwood United Methodist Church in Houston, Texas.

On January 1, 2011, Watson was among seven artists inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame.
