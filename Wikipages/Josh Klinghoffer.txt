===Early career and The Bicycle Thief (1995–2001)===
Dropping out of formal education at the age of 15, Klinghoffer became involved in performing and recording music in [[Los Angeles]] at an early age. Klinghoffer describes himself at this time as "[the] little music dork who lived around the corner, dropped out of high school, and was just playing guitar all day long."<ref name="sfweekly1999">[http://www.sfweekly.com/1999-12-15/music/still-a-beautiful-mess/2/ Still a Beautiful Mess – Page 2 – Music – San Francisco] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716051723/http://www.sfweekly.com/1999-12-15/music/still-a-beautiful-mess/2/ |date=July 16, 2011 }}. SF Weekly (December 15, 1999). Retrieved on 2011-11-24.</ref> In 1997, at the age of seventeen, Klinghoffer joined [[The Bicycle Thief (band)|The Bicycle Thief]], the then-current project from former [[Thelonious Monster]] frontman [[Bob Forrest]]. [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]] noted that "Bob [Forrest] has always had a very keen sensibility about finding extremely talented and down-to-earth people who just want to get to a kitchen and write a song."<ref>Appleford, Steve.

It was during the recording of Bicycle Thief album that Josh first met John Frusciante, who came in to record a guitar solo. The two eventually began to hang out and listen to music together at Frusciante's home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stadium-arcadium.com/19-08-2011/josh-klinghoffer-guitar-world-magazine-october-2011-im-with-you/red-hot-chili-peppers-news/article10040 |title=Josh Klinghoffer Interview Guitar World Magazine October 2011 Red Hot Chili Peppers I'm With You |publisher=Stadium-arcadium.com |date=August 19, 2011 |access-date=February 14, 2012 |archive-date=January 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111020933/http://stadium-arcadium.com/19-08-2011/josh-klinghoffer-guitar-world-magazine-october-2011-im-with-you/red-hot-chili-peppers-news/article10040 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In late 1999, The Bicycle Thief opened for Red Hot Chili Peppers, as the latter toured in support of their seventh studio album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]''.

===John Frusciante and Ataxia (2002–2004)===
Klinghoffer and the Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist [[John Frusciante]] began writing together in 2002, with the hopes of recording and releasing an album under a band name. This album was eventually released as a John Frusciante solo release in 2004, entitled ''[[Shadows Collide with People]]''.<ref name="invisiblemovement">[http://invisible-movement.net/articles/2004-press/alternativenation John Frusciante unofficial website – Invisible Movement › Revamp!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723155847/http://invisible-movement.net/articles/2004-press/alternativenation |date=July 23, 2011 }}. Invisible-movement.net. Retrieved on November 24, 2011.</ref> Regarding this decision, Frusciante stated: {{cquote|We had written the song "Omission" together and this song came about through collaboration. He played keyboard and I played guitar and both of us had the ideas for the vocals. [...] We sat there and scribbled our parts onto a piece of paper and when we were ready we got back together again and sung our ideas together and they fit perfectly. At that time we thought that we'd do many songs together, just like this one. As time went by, this album became more of a solo album with which he's helping me. [...] We'll do further projects where we'll work together, but we realized that these were my songs and it therefore had to be a solo album.}}

During the first six months of 2004, Klinghoffer continued to assist Frusciante in the studio. Klinghoffer's drums, bass, vocals, keyboards, and/or guitar can be heard on the full-length albums ''[[The Will to Death]]'', ''[[Inside of Emptiness]]'', and in 2009's ''[[The Empyrean]]''.  2004's ''[[A Sphere in the Heart of Silence]]'' is also credited to both musicians, and features several tracks with Klinghoffer on vocals, lead guitar, synthesizers and sequencing.  He plays drums along with Frusciante and [[Fugazi]] bassist [[Joe Lally]] in ''[[Automatic Writing (album)|Automatic Writing]]'' and ''[[AW II]]'', under the name [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]].

Frusciante commented on his relationship with Klinghoffer in 2004 stating: "He's simply a very talented person and has been a very close friend for the past four years. He's one of the very few people who I really like to spend a lot of time with. In many respects he's the person who is closest to me, and with whom I can speak honestly about everything. His opinion is very important to me and I value it a lot."<ref name="invisiblemovement" />

In 2004, Klinghoffer also appeared on the [[Thelonious Monster]] album, ''[[California Clam Chowder]]''.

===Dot Hacker (2008–present)===

Klinghoffer founded his own band, [[Dot Hacker]], in 2008, where he holds the position of primary songwriter, singer, rhythm guitarist and pianist.

In an interview released on January 18, 2020 by [[Ultimate Guitar]], Klinghoffer spoke briefly for the first time about his departure from the band. Klinghoffer said that he couldn't go into detail about his departure but when asked if there was any hard feelings between him, the band or Frusciante he responded by saying "I don't think so. Not from me."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/josh_klinghoffer_answers_if_he_has_hard_feelings_about_rhcp_departure_names_solo_hes_proudest_of_contributing.html|title=Josh Klinghoffer Answers if He Has Hard Feelings About RHCP Departure, Names Solo He's Proudest of Contributing|publisher=ultimate-guitar.com|access-date=January 18, 2020|archive-date=January 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200119152930/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/josh_klinghoffer_answers_if_he_has_hard_feelings_about_rhcp_departure_names_solo_hes_proudest_of_contributing.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Klinghoffer on January 23, 2020 gave an interview with [[Marc Maron]] on the ''WTF with Marc Maron'' podcast where, for the first time, he discussed in detail his firing from the band. Klinghoffer described the meeting with the band as being "really sweet" and that “I rode my bike over [to Flea’s house]. They just said, 'We’ll get right to it. We’ve decided to ask John to come back to the band' And I just sat there quiet for a second and I said, ‘I’m not surprised.’ And the only thing I could think to say was, ‘I wish I could have done something with you guys, musically or creatively, that would have made this an absolute impossibility.” Klinghoffer said that “It’s absolutely John’s place to be in that band. So that’s why I’m happy for him, I’m happy that he’s back with them.” The news of his firing did however come as a “complete shock but not a surprise” as he had known Frusciante had been jamming with Flea in recent months and that Anthony Kiedis was also recently in contact with him. “John and Flea have a musical language. I’ll never be able to contend with the history him and John had.” Klinghoffer also discussed Frusciante's departure in 2009 saying “We had been friends and working together. When they decided they wanted to carry on and he maintained he was sort of done with it, and they asked me to do it, I think he was really surprised that they were going to carry on without him… It was sort of a strange position I was holding.” Klinghoffer maintained that he was fine with the decision and there was "no animosity" between him and the band. “If John coming back had happened five years ago, it would have been hard for me, temporally, to weigh [my contributions] against what they had. Now, after 10 years, two tours, and almost three albums of writing, I’m really proud of what I did with them. I feel like we did create something.” <ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/josh-klinghoffer-chili-peppers-firing/|title=Josh Klinghoffer calls firing from Red Hot Chili Peppers a "pretty simple" decision|publisher=consequenceofsound.com|access-date=January 23, 2020|archive-date=January 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124133745/https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/josh-klinghoffer-chili-peppers-firing/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/episode/3HpvTdpH8laJzmgF1OG7FI|title=Episode 1091 – Josh Klinghoffer|publisher=spotify.com|access-date=January 23, 2020|archive-date=February 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224083913/https://open.spotify.com/episode/3HpvTdpH8laJzmgF1OG7FI|url-status=live}}</ref>

On January 31, 2020, Klinghoffer was interviewed by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and opened up much more about his firing. Klinghoffer said "I love those guys deeply. I never saw myself as deserving to be there over John." He further discussed the moments when he found out he was being fired saying "It was mostly Flea talking. Anthony didn’t say much. But I can see in his eyes that it was a very painful decision. And I think of Anthony as a very tender and supportive person. We all hugged and Chad texted me before I even got home. He was really heartbroken about the whole thing because Chad and I are very good friends." Klinghoffer said that he was unaware of the band's statement on his firing and said "I was totally surprised. And it does look exactly like a death announcement." Klinghoffer also discussed the two albums he recorded while in the band saying "I’m not particularly fond of the two records. I liked the songs and I think we wrote some really cool songs together, but I’m such a pain in the ass. Rick Rubin was the producer [on ''I’m With You'']. And the reason why I didn’t want to work with him the second time [the band was in talks for Rubin to produce the new album] was because I felt like those four had a relationship and I was the odd man out."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/josh-klinghoffer-red-hot-chili-peppers-interview-945881/|title=JJosh Klinghoffer Talks Red Hot Chili Peppers Firing: 'It Truly Felt Like a Death'|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=January 31, 2020|archive-date=January 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131201045/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/josh-klinghoffer-red-hot-chili-peppers-interview-945881/|url-status=live}}</ref>
