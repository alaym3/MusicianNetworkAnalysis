Another video that was uploaded to YouTube a month earlier, "Flamin Hot Cheetos", garnered 3 million views by July 2018.<ref name="Ringer2018" /> The success of "Pretty Girl" led to interest from major labels such as [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], [[RCA Records|RCA]], and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]].
