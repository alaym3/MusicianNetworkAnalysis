==History==
Kato and Roeser met at [[Northwestern University]] in 1985. They formed Urge Overkill (getting the name from a phrase in the lyrics of the [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] song "[[Funkentelechy]]") in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, in 1986,<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1205}}</ref> with drummer Pat Byrne, and released an [[Extended play|EP]], ''Strange, I...'', on [[Ruthless Records (Chicago)|Ruthless Records]].<ref name="Larkin"/> The EP was recorded by Kato's friend, [[Steve Albini]]. A full-length album, ''[[Jesus Urge Superstar]]'', soon followed, again produced by Albini, and with Kriss Bataille taking over the drums.

Their next effort, ''[[Americruiser]]'', saw a drastic change in style. Jack "Jaguar" Watt (of the band Baron Lesh) was the new drummer and their sound from then on has been described as a "Stonesy fusion of arena rock and punk". Produced by [[Butch Vig]], ''Americruiser'' was widely praised, and scored a [[Campus radio|college radio]] hit with the lead single, "Ticket to L.A." Watt returned to Baron Lesh and was replaced by Blackie Onassis (real name: John Rowan) on the next album ''[[The Supersonic Storybook]]'', which was named by [[Material Issue]]'s [[Jim Ellison]] was released in 1991.

After opening for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] on the American ''[[Nevermind]]'' tour,<ref name="cos">{{cite magazine|last=Meredith|first=Kyle|title=Urge Overkill on Saturation's 25 Anniversary and Touring with Nirvana|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kyle-meredith-with-urge-overkill/|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=August 1, 2018|access-date=June 17, 2019}}</ref> Urge Overkill returned to the studio to record another [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Stull (EP)|Stull]]'', in 1992 which featured the tracks, "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon" (produced and mixed by [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]]) and "Goodbye to Guyville". Having a strong following by this time, they jumped from their indie label, [[Touch and Go Records|Touch & Go]], to a major label, [[Geffen Records]].<ref name="cos"/> Despite some criticism for the label switch, Urge Overkill's major-label debut, [[Saturation (Urge Overkill album)|''Saturation'']], received strong reviews upon release in 1993,<ref name="Larkin"/> and to support the album, they opened for [[Pearl Jam]] on their [[Vs. Tour|''Vs.'' tour]]. The single "Sister Havana" finally gave the band a hit record and broad recognition.<ref name="cos"/>

In 1993, the band contributed the track "Take a Walk" to the AIDS relief benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. As the band recorded a follow-up album, cult filmmaker [[Quentin Tarantino]] used the group's [[cover version]] of the [[Neil Diamond]] song, "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon", in his 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. When the movie became a hit, the song made it to number 59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/surf-music-and-seventies-soul-the-songs-of-pulp-fiction-20140521/urge-overkill-girl-youll-be-a-woman-soon-0556827 | title=Surf Music and Seventies Soul: The Songs of 'Pulp Fiction' | date=21 May 2014 | publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] | access-date=July 7, 2014}}</ref>

Urge Overkill retained their sound for their next album, ''[[Exit the Dragon]]'', released in 1995. Kato and Roeser started feuding, resulting in Roeser leaving the band. Roeser went on to perform with Jim Kimball (formerly of [[The Jesus Lizard]]) as L.I.M.E. and with his brother John in the band Electric Airlines. Now a duo consisting of Kato and Onassis, Urge Overkill moved to [[Sony]]'s [[550 Music]] in early 1997.

After a break of several years, Kato released a solo album in 2000 called ''Debutante''. Six of the album's 13 songs were co-written with Onassis.

In 2004, Kato and Roeser reformed Urge Overkill without Onassis, recruiting former [[Gaza Strippers]] guitarist Mike "Hadji" Hodgkiss to play bass, keyboardist Chris Frantisak, and drummer Nate Arling, who was later replaced by Brian "Bonn" Quast from [[The Cherry Valence]]. The reformed Urge Overkill performed shows at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood, [[Double Door]] in Chicago, [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue]] in Minneapolis and the [[Bowery Ballroom]] in New York and continued to tour through Europe, North America, and Australia.

On September 19, 2010, on the free form radio program ''Anything Anything with Rich Russo'' on WRXP-FM in New York, the first new Urge Overkill song in 15 years was played. The song was called "Effigy". Russo also announced an Urge Overkill show on October 4, 2010, at Mercury Lounge in New York. Live shows began happening, including being the musical guest at a "[[Roast (comedy)|Roast]] of [[Quentin Tarantino]]" on December 1, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sentimentalistmag.com/2010/09/16/urge-overkill-returns-with-new-song-tarantino-roast/|title=Urge Overkill Returns with New Song, Tarantino Roast|website=Sentimentalistmag.com|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> The band released ''[[Rock & Roll Submarine]]'', their first studio album in 16 years, in May 2011. A subsequent tour followed the release of the album. On October 8, 2011, Urge Overkill opened for [[Weezer]] at the Red Bull [[Riot Fest]] at the historic [[Congress Theater]] in [[Chicago]].

Urge Overkill had continued to perform live occasionally from 2012 to 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://maytherockbewithyou.com/mtrbwy/2011/10/urge-overkill-rock-roll-submarine-australian-tour-2012-3/|title=Urge Overkill – 'Rock & Roll Submarine' – Australian Tour 2012|work=May the Rock Be with You|date=October 27, 2011|access-date=February 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://urgeoverkill.com/tour/|title=Tour - Urge Overkill|work=urgeoverkill.com|access-date=February 23, 2020}}</ref> The band is currently working on new material for the follow-up to ''Rock & Roll Submarine''.<ref name="cos"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://wgnradio.com/2015/08/27/nash-kato-and-eddie-roeser-urge-overkill/|title=Chicago band Urge Overkill: "What we seem to be good at is the rock"|work=[[WGN (AM)|WGN]]|date=August 27, 2015|access-date=February 23, 2020}}</ref>
