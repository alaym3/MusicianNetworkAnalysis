==Career==
Woods was scouted by her first manager in her senior year of high school from a choir performance. As a result, she pursued music full time immediately after graduating, rather than going into dentistry as she had planned.<ref name="billboard2020"/><ref name="schon2020"/>

Woods debuted in 2015 with the song "Only A Girl," which describes her first same-sex relationship. Woods came out as a lesbian to her family through the song.<ref name="billboard2017"/> The accompanying music video has over 10 million hits on YouTube.<ref name="billboard2019">{{cite web|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|title=Gia Woods Shares Her Favorite 'Sexy Empowering' Songs for Summer of Pride Mix|author=Nick Williams|date=2019-09-13|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8529966/listen-gia-woods-summer-of-pride-mix-interview}}</ref>

Woods released her debut EP ''Cut Season'' on October 9, 2020.<ref name="billboard2020"/> The album was influenced by the lack of support Woods received from friends after her experience leaving a four-year relationship and her father's passing.<ref name="schon2020"/>

==Influences==
Woods is inspired by [[Radiohead]], [[Green Day]] and [[Madonna]].<ref name="schon2020"/>
