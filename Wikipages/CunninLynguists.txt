==Early beginnings==
In 1999, [[Deacon the Villain]] and [[Kno (musician)|Kno]] met at Club Kaya in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] at an event for the now defunct Blaze Magazine that included various members of Atlanta's own [[Dungeon Family]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wers.org/articles/?id=60|title=Artist Interview: The CunninLynguists|work=[[WERS]]|date=March 27, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016134518/http://wers.org/articles/?id=60|archive-date=October 16, 2007}}</ref> They had talked online previously through an emcee named Jugga the Bully, who hosted an open mic called Underground Live at the Moorehouse college campus, which they both frequented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/interview/cunnin.html|title=RapReview Feature for December 13, 2005 - CunninLynguists Interview|work=RapReviews.com|date=December 13, 2005|access-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref> At the time, Kno was in the group The Continuum, and Deacon was in the group Illstar.<ref name="soundofboston.com">{{cite news|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-deacon-villain-cunninlynguists/|title=Interview: Deacon the Villain of CunninLynguists|work=Sound of Boston|date=September 24, 2014|access-date=2017-02-11}}</ref> Deacon soon returned to his home state of Kentucky and Kno eventually followed. Following several conversations of working together, the two first planned an EP where Kno was only producing and Deacon was rhyming, but soon Kno contributed as an emcee as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://board.rapbasement.com/forum/music-aa/hip-hop/underground-hip-hop/315505-cunninlynguists-interview-hiphopsite|title=Cunninlynguists interview (hiphopsite) - Rap Basement Message Board|work=Rap Basement|access-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref>

==Musical career==

===2001–2005: ''Will Rap for Food'', ''SouthernUnderground'' and ''Sloppy Seconds''===
The group's debut studio album, ''[[Will Rap for Food]]'', was released in October 2001, and was described by [[Pitchfork Media]] as "a solid, accessible debut, filled with clever rhymes and tremendously consistent production".<ref name="Jeffries">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p558287|pure_url=yes}}|title=CunninLynguists Biography|work=[[AllMusic]]|first=David|last=Jeffries|access-date=April 12, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Kallman">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1689-southernunderground/|title=CunninLynguists: Southernunderground|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|author=Kallman|date=May 18, 2003|access-date=April 12, 2010}}</ref>

In April 2003, [[Mr. SOS]] joined the group on the album ''[[SouthernUnderground]]'', which was independently released on Freshchest Records. The album featured guests including [[Masta Ace]], [[Supastition]] and others, alongside production from [[Domingo (producer)|Domingo]] and [[RJD2]], but again mostly Kno.<ref name="Jeffries" /> M.F. DiBella of [[AllMusic]] commented on "a lyrical deftness and genuine feel for the music rarely seen in the bling-conscious rap of the latter-day era".<ref name="DiBella">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r638177|pure_url=yes}}|title=Southernunderground Review|work=[[AllMusic]]|first=M.F.|last=DiBella|access-date=April 12, 2010}}</ref>

The group landed a distribution contract with [[Caroline Distribution]] in 2004, and ''SouthernUnderground'' was the first project re-released after inking the deal with ''Will Rap For Food'' being re-released shortly thereafter in 2005.<ref name="Jeffries" />

Throughout 2003–2005, the group toured throughout the U.S. and Canada, appearing onstage alongside notable acts such as [[Nappy Roots]], [[Cee-Lo Green]] of [[Goodie Mob]] and touring extensively with [[People Under the Stairs]], [[Raekwon]] of [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Brand Nubian]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===2006–2008: Mr. SOS leaves, Natti joins, ''A Piece of Strange'' and ''Dirty Acres''===
Following SouthernUnderground, Mr. SOS left the group on peaceful terms.<ref name="Jeffries" /> Soon after, the two remaining members met Natti, a fellow Kentucky emcee.

==Name==
The name CunninLynguists is a [[Word play|play]] on the terms "[[cunnilingus]]" and "[[linguists]]". When the group was first forming, Deacon and [[Kno (musician)|Kno]] casually came up with the name, not intending for it to be permanent nor serious,<ref name="soundofboston.com"/> instead only wanting listeners to not take their music as seriously as their music sounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-deacon-villain-cunninlynguists/|title=Interview: Deacon Villain of CunninLynguists|website=Sound of Boston|first=Jon|last=Simmons|access-date=October 2, 2014}}</ref>

==Style==
At the group's beginning, members Kno and Deacon focused on energetic wordplay and outlandish rhymes, only at times delving into deeper and more introspective material, such as "Mic Like a Memory" or "Family Ties" from ''[[Will Rap For Food]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_willrapforfood.html|title=CunninLynguists :: Will Rap For Food :: Urban Acres/Freshchest|work=RapReviews.com|access-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref> This continued up until their critically acclaimed album ''[[A Piece of Strange]]'', which featured more serious songs, such as "Brain Cell", and playful ones, such as "Beautiful Girl".<ref name="xxlmag.com"/> The group has been applauded for their ability to craft poetic songs that are also very musically enjoyable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/42445/CunninLynguists-Oneirology/|title=Review: CunninLynguists - Oneirology|work=[[Sputnikmusic]]|access-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref>
