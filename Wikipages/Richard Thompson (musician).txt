'''Richard Thompson''' {{Post-nominals|country=UK|OBE}} (born 3 April 1949) is an English singer, songwriter, and guitarist.<ref name=WP>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/08/07/thompson-gloom-a-grin/204bfae2-4b53-4dd4-9660-c9bba8642453/|title=THOMPSON: GLOOM A GRIN|author-link=Geoffrey Himes |first=Geoffrey |last=Himes|date=7 August 1991|work=Washington Post|access-date=10 May 2016}}</ref>

Thompson first gained prominence in the late 1960s as the lead guitarist and songwriter for the folk rock group [[Fairport Convention]], which he had co-founded in 1967. After departing the group in 1971, Thompson released his debut solo album ''[[Henry the Human Fly]]'' in 1972. The next year, he formed a duo with his then-wife [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]], which produced six albums, including the critically acclaimed ''[[I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight]]'' (1974) and ''[[Shoot Out the Lights]]'' (1982). After the dissolution of the duo, Thompson revived his solo career with the release of ''[[Hand of Kindness]]'' in 1983. He has released a total of eighteen solo studio albums. Three of his albums{{--}}''[[Rumor and Sigh]]'' (1991), ''[[You? Me? Us?]]'' (1996), and ''[[Dream Attic]]'' (2010){{--}}have been nominated for [[Grammy Award]]s,<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard Thompson |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/richard-thompson |website=GRAMMY.com |access-date=15 January 2020 |language=en |date=19 November 2019}}</ref> while ''[[Still (Richard Thompson album)|Still]]'' (2015) was his first UK Top Ten album. He continues to write and record new material regularly and had frequently performed at venues throughout the world, although the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] forced him to suspend his touring.

Music critic [[Neil McCormick]] described Thompson as "a versatile [[virtuoso]] guitarist and a sharp observational singer-songwriter whose work burns with intelligence and dark emotion".<ref name=mccormick>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/richard-thompson-review-royal-albert-hall-david-gilmour-derek/ | title= Richard Thompson review, Royal Albert Hall: from David Gilmour to Derek Smalls, this was a 70th birthday bash to remember | newspaper=The Telegraph | first=Neil | last=McCormick | date=1 October 2019 | access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref> His songwriting has earned him an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]]<ref name="WebSiteBio" /> and, in 2006, a lifetime achievement award from BBC Radio.<ref name="WebSiteBio" /><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/r2music/folk/folkawards2006/winners06.shtml |title = BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2006 – Winners |publisher = BBC |access-date = 2 March 2008 }}</ref> His 1991 song "[[1952 Vincent Black Lightning]]" was included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's "All Time 100 Songs" list of the best English-language musical compositions released between 1923 and 2011.<ref>[http://entertainment.time.com/2011/10/24/the-all-time-100-songs/slide/1952-vincent-black-lightning-richard-thompson/ "All-TIME 100 Songs: 1952 Vincent Black Lightning"] (retrieved on 26 February 2014).</ref> Thompson was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 New Year Honours]] for services to music.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{London Gazette|issue = 59647 |date = 31 December 2010 |page=12 |supp=y}}</ref> Many varied musicians have recorded Thompson's compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardthompson-music.com/album.asp?id=54|title=Official web site list of artist's songs covered by other artists |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104192301/http://www.richardthompson-music.com/album.asp?id=54|archive-date=4 January 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=2 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardthompson-music.com/album.asp?id=53|title=Official web site list of artist's songs covered by other artists|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016090059/http://richardthompson-music.com/album.asp?id=53|archive-date=16 October 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=2 March 2008}}</ref>

In 2021, his book ''Beeswing: Losing my Way and Finding my Voice, 1967-1975'' was released.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1159043406 |title=Beeswing: Losing my Way and Finding my Voice, 1967-1975 |date=2021 |publisher=Algonquin Books |isbn=978-1-61620-895-0 |edition=First |location=Chapel Hill |oclc=1159043406}}</ref> Published by Algonquin Books, it is mainly a memoir of his life as a musician from 1967 to 1975.

==Early life and career (1949 to 1972)==
Richard Thompson was born in Ladbroke Crescent, [[Notting Hill]], West London, England. His father, a Scot, was a [[Scotland Yard]] detective, and an amateur guitar player; several other family members had played music professionally. While attending [[William Ellis School]] in [[Highgate]], he formed his first band, Emil and the Detectives (named after [[Emil and the Detectives|a book and a movie by the same title]]) with classmate [[Hugh Cornwell]], later lead singer and guitarist of [[The Stranglers]], on bass guitar.

Like so many musicians of his generation, Thompson was exposed to and embraced [[rock and roll]] music at an early age, and he was also exposed to his father's [[jazz]] and [[traditional Scottish music]] record collection.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=16–18|ps=}} His father had seen [[Django Reinhardt]] play in [[Glasgow]] in the 1930s and played guitar himself. He was later described by his son as "a bad amateur player ... with three chords, though, unfortunately, not C, F and G."<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/11/richard-thompson-faith-feature |title = Why Richard Thompson is keeping the faith |author = Tim Adams
|newspaper = [[The Observer]] |date = 11 April 2010 |access-date = 14 May 2013}}</ref> All these musical genres were to colour Thompson's playing in the years to come.

American producer [[Joe Boyd]] said:

{{quote|He can imitate almost any style, and often does, but is instantly identifiable. In his playing you can hear the evocation of the Scottish piper's drone and the melody of the chanter as well as echoes of [[Barney Kessel]]'s and [[James Burton]]'s guitars and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s piano. But no blues clichés.{{sfn|Boyd|2005|p=167|ps=}}}}

At the age of 18 Thompson co-founded folk rock group [[Fairport Convention]]. Largely on the strength of Thompson's playing, Boyd took them under his wing and signed them to his Witchseason production and management company.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=44|ps=}}{{sfn|Boyd|2005|p=166|ps=}}

Boyd said:

{{quote|And there was this group of very nice [[Muswell Hill]] grammar school boys and a girl playing American music. [[Leonard Cohen]] songs, and [[Richard Fariña]] songs, and [[Bob Dylan]] songs, all being done in a kind of West-Coasty rock style. And then came the guitar solo, and Richard just played the most amazing solo. He played a solo which quotes from [[Django Reinhardt|Django]], from [[Charlie Christian]], you know, an incredibly sophisticated little solo. And that really amazed me, the breadth of his sophistication... and so, you know, at the end of the gig I was in the dressing room saying 'would you guys like to make a record?'<ref name="SolitaryLife">{{Cite web | title = Richard Thompson: Solitary Life | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074nw0 | access-date = 14 September 2012 | work = [[BBC]] | date = February 2003}}</ref>}}

Shortly thereafter Thompson, already acquiring a reputation as an outstanding guitar player, started writing songs seriously. This seems to have been out of necessity as Fairport Convention was at first essentially a [[cover band]].

{{quote|I remember saying to Ashley <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Ashley Hutchings|Hutchings]], bassist<nowiki>]</nowiki> after a gig, that I was kind of embarrassed about doing the material we were doing, because it seemed that we should have outgrown doing covers – even though it was only 1967 – it somehow wasn't good enough and other bands were writing their own stuff and we should too. I remember being angry and saying to Ashley this isn't good enough, we've got to get some original material... and stuff started to trickle through.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=50–51|ps=}}}}

By early 1969, when Fairport's second album ''[[What We Did on Our Holidays]]'' was recorded and released, Thompson was starting to emerge as a songwriter of distinction. As Fairport's lineup and their sound evolved, Thompson continued to grow in stature as a player and as a songwriter with compositions like "[[Meet on the Ledge]]".

On 12 May 1969, between the recording and release of their next album ''[[Unhalfbricking]]'', Fairport's van crashed on the [[M1 motorway]] on the way home from a gig at [[Mothers (music venue)|Mothers]], a club in [[Birmingham]]. Drummer [[Martin Lamble]], aged 19, and Thompson's girlfriend Jeannie Franklyn were killed.<ref name = "SolitaryLife" /><ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John | last= Tobler | year= 1992 | title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st | publisher= Reed International Books Ltd | location= London | pages= 196}}</ref> The rest of the band suffered injuries of varying severity.<ref name="Sweers">{{cite book|last=Sweers|first=Britta|title=Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0195174786}}</ref> Later in 1969, Fairport re-grouped with a new drummer, [[Dave Mattacks]], and also invited the well known fiddle player, [[Dave Swarbrick]], to join. Thompson and Swarbrick worked together to create songs such as "Crazy Man Michael" from the band's seminal 1969 folk-rock album ''[[Liege & Lief]]'' and "Sloth" from its 1970 follow-up ''[[Full House (Fairport Convention album)|Full House]]''.

In January 1971, Thompson announced that he was leaving Fairport Convention. His decision was instinctive, rather than a calculated career move:

{{quote|I left Fairport as a gut reaction and didn't really know what I was doing, except writing. I was writing stuff and it seemed interesting and I thought it would be fun to make a record. And at the same time{{--}}70–71{{--}}I was doing a lot of [[session musician|session]] work as a way of avoiding any serious ideas about a career.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=123–124|ps=}} }}

In April 1972, he released his first solo album ''[[Henry the Human Fly]]'', recording with [[Sandy Denny]], [[Pat Donaldson]], [[Sue Draheim]], [[John Kirkpatrick (musician)|John Kirkpatrick]], [[Barry Dransfield]], [[Ashley Hutchings]], [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Peters]], [[Andy Roberts (musician)|Andy Roberts]], and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardthompson-music.com/album.asp?id=5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223202212/http://www.richardthompson-music.com/album.asp?id=5|url-status=dead|title=''Henry the Human Fly''|archive-date=23 December 2007}}</ref> The album sold poorly and was panned by the press, especially the influential ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=135|ps=}} With time ''Henry'' has come to be more highly regarded, but at the time the critics' response hurt both Thompson and his career.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=135|ps=}}

==1970s: Richard and Linda Thompson==
By the 1970s, Thompson had begun a relationship with the singer [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Peters]], who had sung on ''Henry the Human Fly''. In October 1972 the couple were married, and Thompson, with Linda now effectively his front woman, regrouped for his next album and the next phase of his career.

The first Richard and [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]] album, ''[[I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight]]'', was recorded in May 1973 in short time and on a small budget. Largely because of the petrol shortage in Britain and its impact on the availability of vinyl for records, ''Bright Lights'' was held back by [[Island Records]] for nearly a year before being released in April 1974. The album was well received by critics, though sales were less than stellar.

Thompson's lyrics expressed a rather dismal world view, and it has been suggested that the bleak subject matter of his songs helped to keep his recordings off the hit parade. A more likely explanation was given by ex-[[Island Records|Island]] [[Artist and repertoire|A&R]] man Richard Williams in the 2003 [[BBC TV]] documentary ''Solitary Life'': Thompson was just not interested in fame and its trappings.<ref name="SolitaryLife"/>

The Thompsons recorded two more albums—''[[Hokey Pokey (album)|Hokey Pokey]]'' and ''[[Pour Down Like Silver]]'', both released in 1975—before Richard Thompson decided to leave the music business. The couple moved to a [[Abdalqadir as-Sufi|Sufi community]] in [[East Anglia]].

It was not apparent from their records at first, but the Thompsons had embraced an esoteric [[Sufi]] strand of [[Islam]] in early 1974.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=151–154|ps=}} ''I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight'' was recorded before this conversion, but released some time afterwards. The songs for the second Richard and Linda album, ''Hokey Pokey'', were similarly written some time ahead of the album's recording and eventual release. It was ''Pour Down Like Silver'', with its cover photo of a turbaned Richard Thompson, that tipped the public off to the Thompsons' growing preoccupation with their faith.

The trilogy of albums released before and after his sojourn in the commune was heavily influenced by Thompson's beliefs and by Sufi scripture, but in the long run his religious beliefs have not influenced his work in an obvious manner. The outlook expressed in his songs, his musical style, the subjects addressed by his lyrics have not shown any fundamental change.{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=21|ps=}} He remains a committed [[Muslim]].<ref name = "SolitaryLife"/>

Thompson started to re-engage with the world of professional music in 1977. He played on an album by [[Sandy Denny]], and had undertaken a short tour and started recording with a group of musicians who were also Sufis. Thompson asked [[Joe Boyd]] to produce these sessions, and two days were spent on the initial recordings. Boyd recalls that the sessions were not a success: "It was really, I felt, very poor. I didn't have much confidence in the musicians that he was working with. The atmosphere was very strange and it just didn't seem to work."{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=175|ps=}}

At about this time the Thompsons and their family moved out of the commune and back to their old home in [[Hampstead]].{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=181|ps=}} Boyd had already invited Richard Thompson to play on [[Julie Covington]]'s debut album. With spare studio time and the American [[session musician]]s hired to work on the Covington album available, the Thompsons went back into the studio to record under their own name for the first time in three years.

The resulting album, ''[[First Light (Richard and Linda Thompson album)|First Light]]'', was warmly received by critics<ref name = "SolitaryLife"/> but did not sell particularly well. Neither did its follow up, 1979's harder-edged and more cynical ''[[Sunnyvista]]''. [[Chrysalis Records]] did not take up their option to renew the contract, and the Thompsons found themselves without one.

==1980s==
[[File:Richard Thompson on stage at Leeds Folk Festival, UK, 1982 (photograph by Tony Rees).jpg|thumb|Thompson performing solo on stage at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Leeds Folk Festival]], 1982]]
[[Gerry Rafferty]] had booked the Thompsons as the support act for his 1980 tour, and had also used Richard as a session player on his ''[[Night Owl (album)|Night Owl]]'' album. Rafferty offered to finance the recording of a new Richard and Linda Thompson album which he would then use to secure a contract for the Thompsons.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=194|ps=}} Richard Thompson fell out with Rafferty during this project and was not happy with the finished product.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=196|ps=}} Nevertheless, Rafferty kept his side of the bargain and presented the album to several record companies – none of which expressed interest in signing the Thompsons. Rafferty did not recover his investment.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=196–197|ps=}}

About a year later, [[Joe Boyd]] signed the Thompsons to his small [[Hannibal Records|Hannibal]] label and a new album was recorded. ''[[Shoot Out the Lights]]'' included new recordings of many of the songs recorded in 1980. Linda Thompson was pregnant at the time of the recording, so the album's release was delayed until they could tour behind the album.  Breathing problems arising from her pregnancy also meant that Linda could not sing the lead part on some of these songs as she had done on demo tapes and the Rafferty-produced recordings.

As an interim measure, Richard Thompson agreed to a short (5-day), low-key solo tour of the U.S. This tour was set up by Nancy Covey, then concert director for McCabe's Guitar Shop in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=207|ps=}} Covey, who had been in the UK in 1981 trying to sign Thompson to play at McCabe's, arranged for Thompson well-received 5 and 6 December shows. It was during this tour that Thompson and Covey developed an intimate relationship, and during that month, Richard and Linda Thompson separated.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=210–211|ps=}}

Upon its release in 1982, ''Shoot Out the Lights'' was lauded by critics and sold quite well – especially in the U.S.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=207–208|ps=}}<ref name="TimeSOTL">{{cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921277-1,00.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091125155440/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921277-1,00.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = 25 November 2009 |title = Songs of Sad Experience |author = Jay Cocks |date = 30 August 1982 |work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]  |access-date = 13 September 2010}}</ref>

The Thompsons, now a couple for professional purposes only, toured the United States in support of the album, their only American tour together. Both the album and their live shows were well received by the American media,{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=207–208|ps=}}<ref name = "TimeSOTL"/> and ''Shoot Out the Lights'' effectively relaunched their career – just as their marriage was falling apart. The performances, with a backing band including both [[Simon Nicol]] and [[Dave Mattacks]] of Fairport Convention, were seen as strong,<ref name = "TimeSOTL"/>{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=213–213|ps=}} but the tension between Richard and Linda was all too obvious. For this reason, the Thompsons' fans often refer to the ''Shoot Out the Lights'' tour as "The Tour from Hell".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/match-made-in-hell-linda-thompson-and-her-husband-created-british-folk-rock-and-almost-destroyed-463614.html|title=Match made in hell: Linda Thompson and her husband created British|website=Independent.co.uk|date=2 September 2007|access-date=14 September 2018}}</ref> Upon returning home, Richard and Linda went their separate ways.

Richard Thompson continued recording as a solo artist. His 1983 album ''[[Hand of Kindness]]'' saw him working with [[Joe Boyd|Boyd]] again, but with a revised backing band and a more extroverted and up-tempo song selection.

With his separation from Linda finalized, Richard Thompson began to commute between twin bases in London and Los Angeles and to tour regularly in the USA. Encouraged by the success of his solo shows in late 1981 and early 1982, he began to perform solo with increasing frequency and continued to tour with a band. In 1983 and 1984, he toured the US and Europe with the Richard Thompson Big Band, which included two saxophone players in addition to the more usual rhythm section, second guitar and [[accordion]]. Set lists included covers of classic rock 'n roll songs and jazz standards such as "[[Tuxedo Junction]]".

In 1985, Thompson signed with [[PolyGram]] and received a sizeable advance.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=229|ps=}} He and Nancy Covey married at an alcohol-free wedding that included a who's who of roots-music performers who Covey knew well from McCabe's and the Los Angeles music scene, and had introduced to Thompson. After their wedding, Thompson moved his home and working base to California. As part of the settlement that allowed Thompson to leave Boyd's Hannibal label for Polygram, the live album ''[[Small Town Romance]]'' was released. This comprised recordings made during Thompson's solo shows in the US in late 1981 and early 1982. ''[[Across a Crowded Room]]'' (1985) was his last album to be recorded in England and the last to have [[Joe Boyd|Boyd]] as producer.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|pp=242–244|ps=}}{{sfn|Smith|2004|p=280|ps=}} Thompson put together a new look backing band for the tour to promote this album, and some shows were filmed for a live video release (see [[Richard Thompson discography]]).

In 1986, he released ''[[Daring Adventures]]'', which was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by [[Mitchell Froom]]. ''Daring Adventures'', with a rich sound, markedly different production and use of American [[session musician|session players]], was perceived by some as evidence of Thompson's increasing "Americanisation". Perhaps more significantly, the album continued the trend, begun with ''Across A Crowded Room,'' of Thompson's songs moving away from the seemingly personal material and towards the character sketches and narratives for which he has since become famous. Froom and PolyGram had plans to target college and the growing "alternative" markets with ''Daring Adventures''. Sales improved, but not substantially. Polygram declined an option to renew the contract.{{sfn|Humphries|1997|p=253|ps=}} Thompson's management negotiated a new deal with [[Capitol Records]].

In 1985, Fairport Convention reformed and recorded the album ''[[Gladys' Leap]]''. Thompson did not rejoin Fairport, but he did contribute a song to the project and played guitar on another track on the album.

1988 saw the release of Thompson's first album for Capitol, ''[[Amnesia (Richard Thompson album)|Amnesia]]''. Froom was retained as producer, and once again the album was recorded in Los Angeles with many of the same players that Froom had called upon for the ''Daring Adventures'' sessions.

==1990s==
Thompson contributed music to [[BBC]] Northwest's documentary ''Hard Cash'' and appears on the eponymous accompanying album issued by [[Topic Records|Topic]].  A track from the album, ''Time To Ring Some Changes'' is included in the 2009 Topic Records 70-year anniversary boxed set ''[[Three Score and Ten]]'' as track thirteen on the sixth CD.

Thompson appears on [[Willie Nile]]'s 1991 ''[[Places I Have Never Been]]'' album.

In 1991, Thompson recorded ''[[Rumor and Sigh]]'', his second album for Capitol. Once again Froom produced. This album, particularly the acoustic guitar ballad "[[1952 Vincent Black Lightning]]," was hailed by critics and fans alike and greatly advanced Thompson's reputation as a leading traditional-style guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rumor-and-sigh-mw0000263404|title=Rumor and Sigh - Richard Thompson - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=14 September 2018}}</ref>

''Rumor and Sigh'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and sold well. However, a shake-up at Capitol saw Hale Milgrim (Thompson's champion and fan within the boardroom) replaced by Garry Gersh. Thus, Thompson's next album ''[[Mirror Blue]]'' was held back for almost a year before being released.

Thompson was awarded the [[Orville H. Gibson]] Award for best acoustic guitar player in 1997.<ref name="WebSiteBio">{{cite web |url = http://www.richardthompson-music.com/bio.asp |title = Richard Thompson biography on official web site |access-date = 2 March 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080218101756/http://www.richardthompson-music.com/bio.asp |archive-date = 18 February 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates/richard-thompson-obe-131.php|title=Richard Thompson OBE - Graduation - The University of Aberdeen|website=Abdn.ac.uk|access-date=14 September 2018}}</ref>

In 1992, he performed with [[David Byrne]]. Their joint acoustic concert at St. Ann & The Holy Trinity in [[Brooklyn Heights]], New York on 24 March, produced the album ''An Acoustic Evening'', which was released the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jack.mauveweb.co.uk/artists/thompson/19920324.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150419222152/http://jack.mauveweb.co.uk/artists/thompson/19920324.html |archive-date=19 April 2015  }}</ref>

''Mirror Blue'' was released in 1994, to often negative reviews sparked by the production decisions that Thompson and Froom took. Thompson took to the road to promote the album. He was joined by drummer [[Dave Mattacks]], [[Danny Thompson]] (no relation) on double bass, and [[Pete Zorn]] on acoustic guitar, backing vocals, [[mandolin]] and various wind instruments. This line-up toured with Thompson the following two years.

Thompson continued recording for [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] until 1999, when ''[[Mock Tudor (album)|Mock Tudor]]'' was recorded and released. His deal with Capitol was modified so that he could release and directly market limited-quantity, live recorded, not-for-retail albums. The first of these was ''[[Live at Crawley]]'', released in 1995.

==2000s==
[[File:Richard Thompson - Cambridge 2006 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Thompson at the [[Cambridge Folk Festival]], 2006]]
In 2001, Thompson declined the option to renew his contract with Capitol.

Thompson appeared on his ex-wife Linda's studio album ''Fashionably Late'' on the song "Dear Mary".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/fashionably-late-mw0000660574 |title=Allmusic Review: Linda Thompson – "Fashionably Late" |access-date=6 December 2013}}</ref> It was the first time the two had recorded together since ''Shoot Out the Lights''.

The [[BBC]] produced a documentary, in 2003, about Thompson's long musical career, entitled ''Solitary Life'', directed by Paul Bernays and narrated by [[John Peel]]. It featured interviews with Thompson from his home in California and contributions from [[Billy Connolly]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], ex-wife [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]], [[Harry Shearer]] and Thompson's then wife Nancy Covey. The programme was re-broadcast by [[BBC Four]] in September 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074nw0|title="Richard Thompson: Solitary Life" at bbc.co.uk|work=BBC|access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref>

The move away from big labels and big budgets paradoxically brought a bigger marketing push and healthier sales. Thompson's first two self-funded releases, 2003's ''[[The Old Kit Bag]]'' and 2005's ''[[Front Parlour Ballads]]'', did well in the [[Indie (music)|indie]] charts on both sides of the Atlantic.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In May 2007 Thompson released ''[[Sweet Warrior]]''. The album was licensed to different labels in different territories: [[Shout! Factory]] in the US, [[P-Vine Records|P-Vine]] in Japan, Planet Records in Australia, and [[Proper Records]] in the UK and Europe. In August of the same year [[Island Records|Island]] released a live Richard and Linda Thompson album, compiled from recordings made during the November 1975 tour to promote the ''[[Pour Down Like Silver]]'' album.

Thompson continued releasing "official bootlegs" on his boutique label as an additional source of revenue – all live recordings.

==2010s==

In early 2010, Thompson assembled a band and did a string of shows showcasing new material. The aim was to record the new material in a live setting. The recording and touring band consisted of Thompson, Pete Zorn, (acoustic guitar, flute, saxophone, mandolin, vocals); [[Michael Jerome]] (drums, vocals), [[Taras Prodaniuk]], (bass guitar, vocals); and [[Joel Zifkin]], ([[electric violin]], mandolin, vocals). The resulting album ''[[Dream Attic]]'', released in August the same year, was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.grammy.com/nominees?year=2010&genre=59#id69-best-contemporary-folk-album|title = Official list of the 53rd Grammy nominees, announced December 2010|website=Grammy.com|date = 30 April 2017}}</ref>

On 10 June 2010, Thompson was awarded the ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' Les Paul Award for "Guitar Legend".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/photos.nsf/main/richard_thompson_5496377 |title=Richard Thompson Picture|website=Contactmusic.com |date=11 June 2010|access-date=15 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/guitar-greats-honoured-at-mojo-music-awards-1997770.html |title = Guitar greats honoured at Mojo music awards |date = 11 June 2010|work = [[The Independent]] | location = London | first = Anthony | last = Barnes}}</ref>

Thompson curated the 2010 [[Meltdown Festival]]. The festival included a tribute to the recently deceased [[Kate McGarrigle]], a feature of which was a rare on-stage reunion of Richard and Linda Thompson. He was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to music.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> On 5 July 2011, he was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] by the [[University of Aberdeen]].<ref name="infoserv.abdn.ac.uk">{{cite web|url=http://infoserv.abdn.ac.uk/news/details-10307.php|title=Leading folk musician among those to be honoured by University of Aberdeen|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320061141/http://infoserv.abdn.ac.uk/news/details-10307.php|archive-date=20 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In early 2013, Thompson released ''[[Electric (Richard Thompson album)|Electric]]'', recorded in Nashville with [[Buddy Miller]] producing. The record enjoyed good reviews and debuted in the UK top 20. Thompson took to the road with a stripped down "[[power trio]]" band on a multi-month tour on both sides of the Atlantic to promote the new album. Also that year Thompson appeared on his ex-wife Linda's fourth studio album ''Won't Be Long Now'', on the track "Love's for Babies and Fools".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/wont-be-long-now-mw0002570051 |title=Allmusic Review: Linda Thompson – "Won't Be Long Now" |access-date=6 December 2013}}</ref> It was the second time the two have recorded together since ''Shoot Out the Lights''.

In 2014, Thompson released ''[[Acoustic Classics]],''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theimmortaljukebox.com/2014/12/31/album-of-the-year-2014-richard-thompson-acoustic-classics/| title=ImmortalJukebox blog entry on Acoustic Classics| date=31 December 2014| access-date=1 January 2015}}</ref> an album featuring acoustic renditions of 14 songs from his back catalogue, on his Beeswing label.

==Side projects and collaborations==
In between leaving [[Fairport Convention]] in early 1971 and releasing his debut solo album in 1972, he undertook a large amount of [[session musician|session]] work, most notably on albums by [[John Martyn]], [[Al Stewart]], [[Matthews Southern Comfort]], [[Sandy Denny]], [[Mike Heron]] and [[Nick Drake]].

During the same period, he also worked on two collaborative projects. ''[[Morris On]]'' was recorded with [[Ashley Hutchings]], [[John Kirkpatrick (musician)|John Kirkpatrick]], [[Dave Mattacks]] and Barry Dransfield, and was a collection of English traditional tunes arranged for electric instruments.  ''The Bunch'' were almost the reverse conceptually – a grouping of English [[folk rock]] musicians (including [[Sandy Denny]], [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Peters]] and members of [[Fairport Convention]]) recording a selection of classic [[rock and roll]] tunes.

Thompson has continued to guest on albums by an array of artists, from [[Crowded House]], [[Bonnie Raitt]] and [[Vivian Stanshall]], to [[Norma Waterson]] and [[BeauSoleil]] and folk artists like [[Loudon Wainwright III]], [[Cathal McConnell]] (of [[The Boys of the Lough]]) and [[Bob Davenport]]. He has also performed and recorded with [[Teddy Thompson]], his son from his marriage to [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]].

[[File:Richard Thompson and Dave Pegg.jpg|thumb|left|Thompson with Fairport Convention's [[Dave Pegg]] at Cropredy, 2005]]
Since the early 1980s,<ref>{{cite web |title=Fairport's Cropredy Convention – Full line-up announced |author=Gallacher, Alex |date=8 March 2019  |publisher=[[Folk Radio UK]] |url=https://www.folkradio.co.uk/2019/03/fairports-cropredy-convention-full-line-up-announced/ |access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref> Thompson has appeared at [[Fairport Convention]]'s annual [[Cropredy Festival]], both in his own right and as a participant in sets with current and previous Fairport members. These sets are seldom confined to performances of songs out of the Thompson or Fairport Convention canons, and in recent years some surprise offerings have included the soul classic "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]" (with Thompson backed by the [[Roy Wood]] Big Band), [[The Beatles]]' "[[I'm Down]]"  and even "[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]".

Thompson has displayed a penchant for the [[avant garde]] as well, working with former [[Pere Ubu]] singer [[David Thomas (musician)|David Thomas]]'s grouping The Pedestrians on two albums in 1981 and 1982, respectively.  In the 1980s, he was associated with a loose-fitting group called [[The Golden Palominos]], who were led by drummer [[Anton Fier]] and included at times on stage and on record [[Jack Bruce]], [[Michael Stipe]], [[Carla Bley]], [[John Lydon]], [[Bill Laswell]] and others. He has worked with experimental guitarist [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]], most notably as part of the ad hoc grouping [[French Frith Kaiser Thompson]] with whom he recorded two albums.  In 1997 he worked with long-time friend and band member [[Danny Thompson]] to record a [[concept album]] ''Industry'' that dealt with the decline of British industry. A year later he worked with [[early music]] expert [[Philip Pickett]] on the acclaimed ''Bones of All Men'' which fused [[renaissance]] tunes with contemporary music.

For several years Thompson devised and toured his show ''[[1000 Years of Popular Music]]''. The inspiration for this came when ''[[Playboy]]'' asked Thompson (and many other music industry figures) in 1999 for their suggestions for the "top ten songs of the millennium".  Guessing that ''Playboy'' expected most people's lists to start at around 1950, Thompson took the magazine at its word and presented a list of songs from the 11th century to the present day. Perhaps not surprisingly, ''Playboy'' did not use his list, but the exercise gave him the idea for a show which takes a chronological trip through popular music across the ages.  Thompson acknowledges that this is an ambitious undertaking, partly because he reckons that he is technically unqualified to sing 98% of the material,<ref>[http://www.richardthompson-music.com/album.asp?id=74 ''Liner notes to 1000 Years Of Popular Music CD''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221015041/http://www.richardthompson-music.com/album.asp?id=74 |date=21 December 2007 }}. Retrieved 20 March 2008</ref> and partly because of the sparse musical setting he restricts himself to: besides his acoustic guitar, he's backed by singer/pianist [[Judith Owen]] and percussionist/singer [[Debra Dobkin]]. A typical performance would start with a medieval round, progress via a [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]] aria, Victorian music hall and [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and end with Thompson's take on the [[Britney Spears]] hit "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richardthompson-music.com/catch_of_the_day.asp?id=205 |title=BeesWeb – Catch of the Day |publisher=Richardthompson-music.com |access-date=22 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209074913/http://www.richardthompson-music.com/catch_of_the_day.asp?id=205 |archive-date=9 February 2012  }}</ref>

In 2004, Thompson was asked to create the soundtrack music for the [[Werner Herzog]] documentary ''[[Grizzly Man]]''. The score, which was recorded over a two-day period in December 2004, brought Thompson together with a group of improvisational musicians, mostly from the [[San Francisco Bay area]]; video footage from the sessions was edited into a mini-documentary, ''In the Edges,'' which was included with the DVD release of ''Grizzly Man''.

In 2009, Thompson was commissioned to write a piece for the International Society of Bassists in honour of Danny Thompson.  The resulting Cabaret of Souls, a musical play set in the underworld, has been performed in State College (Pennsylvania), London, and Los Angeles with a cast that includes Harry Shearer, Judith Owen, Debra Dobkin, Pete Zorn, either Danny Thompson or David Piltch, and a 12-piece string section conducted by Peter Askim. This suite was eventually commercially released in late 2012.

In 2006 and 2013, Thompson recorded [[Hugh S. Roberton]]'s "[[Mingulay Boat Song]]" and the traditional "General Taylor" for the [[sea shanty]]-compilations ''[[Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys]]'' and ''[[Son of Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs & Chanteys]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rogues-gallery-pirate-ballads-sea-songs-chanteys-mw0000403221|title=Various Artists - Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, & Chanteys|author=Jurek, Thom |work=AllMusic|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/son-of-rogues-gallery-pirate-ballads-sea-songs-chanteys-mw0002476575|title=Various Artists - Son of Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs & Chanteys|author=Leggett, Steve |work=AllMusic|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref>

In July 2019, [[New West Records]] released a soundtrack album for the documentary ''The Cold Blue'', featuring the film's original score composed by Thompson. The film, directed by [[Erik Nelson (filmmaker)|Erik Nelson]], tells the story of the [[Eighth Air Force]] which flew multiple deadly missions during World War II and features newly restored 4K footage and outtakes, shot by director [[William Wyler]], during the summer of 1943 for his 1944 documentary ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-cold-blue|title=The Cold Blue|website=HBO}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | publisher = [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZNljXmQzGY | title=Richard Thompson - 'The Cold Blue' (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Score) | date=22 May 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>

==Retrospectives and tributes==
There are a number of retrospective collections of Thompson's work, many containing material which is unavailable elsewhere.  1976's ''[[(guitar, vocal)]]'' was a collection of unreleased material from the previous eight years of Thompson's appearances on the [[Island Records|Island]] label.  The 3-CD set ''[[Watching the Dark]]'' combines his better-known songs and previously unreleased live and studio tracks.  ''[[Action Packed]]'' is a compilation of tracks from his Capitol releases, plus three hard-to-find songs.  Finally, in 2006, the independent label Free Reed released ''[[RT- The Life and Music of Richard Thompson]]'', a 5-CD box set consisting almost entirely of previously unreleased performances of songs from throughout Thompson's long career.

Thompson's songs have been extensively covered; for example, [[Dimming of the Day]] has been performed by artists such as [[The Neville Brothers]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[David Gilmour]], [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]], [[June Tabor]], [[The Corrs]] and [[Alison Krauss and Union Station]].  There have been several tribute compilations of other artists' interpretations of his work, including: [[Capitol Records|Capitol]]'s ''[[Beat the Retreat: Songs by Richard Thompson]]'' and [[Green Linnet Records|Green Linnet]]'s ''[[The World Is a Wonderful Place: The Songs of Richard Thompson]]'', both released in 1994.

==Playing style==
Thompson makes use of the "pick and fingers" technique (sometimes referred to as "[[hybrid picking]]") where he plays bass notes and rhythm with a pick between his first finger and thumb, and adds melody and punctuation by plucking the treble strings with his fingers. He also makes use of different [[guitar tunings]], such as (low to high) [[CGDGBE]], [[Drop D tuning|DADGBE]], [[DADGAD]], and more.  This enables him to adapt traditional songs, as on ''[[Strict Tempo!]]'' and ''[[1000 Years of Popular Music]]''.  Thompson occasionally makes use of a thumb-pick, playing in [[fingerstyle]], the most notable example being on the motorcycle ballad "[[1952 Vincent Black Lightning]]."

==Guitars==
===Electric===
Thompson is often associated with the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Stratocaster]] guitar. He has made prominent use of Stratocasters, as he has a general preference for the sound of [[single coil]] pick-ups.

{{quote|When I started playing Fenders in 1968, it was unfashionable because everyone in England was playing Gibsons and trying to get a big, fat sound like Eric Clapton had in Cream. I just wanted a little more bite.}}

Prior to using a Stratocaster with Fairport Convention he used a [[Les Paul (guitar)|Gibson Les Paul]] with [[P-90]] pick-ups. He then switched to a late 60s Stratocaster. Since leaving Fairport Convention he has continued to use electric guitars with single coil pick-ups, most famously a late-1950s Stratocaster but also two custom built electrics by Danny Ferrington as well as other Stratocasters, various [[Telecaster]]-type guitars and, in the studio, a [[Danelectro]] U2.

As regards [[Effects unit|effects]], he has made significant use of modulation and [[vibrato]] type effects pedals, most notably the [[Univibe]] and emulations thereof.

Thompson has made intermittent use of [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]'s GK-1 pick-up and GL-2 synthesiser over the years. He made use of these devices on 1979's ''[[Sunnyvista]]'' album and has occasionally used them in concert.

===Acoustic===
Since the early 1990s, Thompson has made prominent use of [[George Lowden|Lowden]] acoustic guitars for studio and live work; Lowden have made a signature model for him. Before this he used a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] 000-18 as well as instruments built by Danny Ferrington.

For live work, his acoustic guitars are fitted with a Sunrise pick-up and an internal condenser microphone. The output from the pick-up is usually fed into some effects pedals, typically a [[delay pedal]] and a [[Uni-Vibe]].<ref name="RTGearQandA">[http://www.richardthompson-music.com/QAgeartunings.asp Gear and Tuninqs Q&A] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804233921/http://www.richardthompson-music.com/QAgeartunings.asp |date=4 August 2010 }}.
