'''Kurt Donald Cobain''' (February 20, 1967&nbsp;– {{circa}} April 5, 1994) was an American singer, songwriter, artist<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kurt Cobain Visual Artist and Painter|url=https://www.rockarchive.com/news/2017/kurt-cobain-visual-artist-and-painter|access-date=2021-11-09|website=Rockarchive|language=en}}</ref> and musician.  He was the frontman of the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], serving as the band's guitarist, lead vocalist, and primary songwriter. Through his angst-fueled songwriting and [[anti-establishment]] persona, Cobain's compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock music. He was often heralded as a spokesman of [[Generation X]] and is considered to be one of the most influential musicians in the history of [[alternative rock]].

Cobain formed the band Nirvana with [[Krist Novoselic]] and [[Aaron Burckhard]] in 1987 and established it as part of the [[Music of Seattle|Seattle music scene]] which later became known as [[grunge]]. After signing with major label [[DGC Records]], Nirvana found global success with "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" from their critically acclaimed second album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). Although Cobain was hailed as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been misinterpreted by the public. In addition to "Smells Like Teen Spirit", Cobain wrote many other notable songs for Nirvana, including "[[Come as You Are (Nirvana song)|Come as You Are]]", "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]", "[[In Bloom]]", "[[Something in the Way]]", "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]", "[[All Apologies]]", "[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]", "[[Aneurysm (song)|Aneurysm]]" and "[[You Know You're Right]]".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=June 20, 2019|title=Nirvana's 20 greatest songs – ranked!|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/20/nirvanas-20-greatest-songs-ranked|access-date=June 9, 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with [[heroin]] addiction and chronic health problems such as [[Clinical depression|depression]]. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, and he had a tumultuous relationship with his wife, fellow musician [[Courtney Love]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/03/love-story-of-kurt-cobain-courtney-love|title=Strange Love: The Story of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love|last=Hirschberg|first=Lynn|work=HWD|access-date=August 23, 2018|language=en}}</ref> In March 1994, Cobain overdosed on a combination of champagne and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]], and he subsequently entered an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] and underwent a [[Drug detoxification|detox]] program. On April 8, 1994, [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain was found dead]] at his home in [[Seattle]] at the [[27 Club|age of 27]]; police concluded he had died on April 5 from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head.

Cobain was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], along with Nirvana bandmates [[Krist Novoselic]] and [[Dave Grohl]], in their first year of eligibility in 2014. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included Cobain in its lists of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]], 100 Greatest Guitarists, and 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. He was ranked 7th by [[MTV]] in the "22 Greatest Voices in Music". In 2006, he was placed 20th by ''[[Hit Parader]]'' on their list of the "100 Greatest Metal Singers of All Time".

Cobain's family had a musical background. His maternal uncle, Chuck Fradenburg, played in a band called the Beachcombers; his aunt, Mari Earle, played guitar and performed in bands throughout [[Grays Harbor County]]; and his great-uncle, Delbert, had a career as an Irish tenor, making an appearance in the 1930 film ''[[King of Jazz]]''. Kurt was described as a happy and excitable child, who also exhibited sensitivity and care. His talent as an artist was evident from an early age, as he would draw his favorite characters from films and cartoons, such as the [[Creature from the Black Lagoon]] and [[Donald Duck]], in his bedroom.<ref name="cross-2008" /><ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|11}} He was encouraged by his grandmother, Iris Cobain, a professional artist.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Audrey Davies|title=The Visual Art of 8 More Famous Musicians – Part 2|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2011/10/04/the-visual-art-of-8-more-famous-musicians-part-2/#sthash.S59n7oU7.dpbs|website=Rock Cellar Magazine|publisher=Rock Cellar Magazine|access-date=January 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219063106/http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2011/10/04/the-visual-art-of-8-more-famous-musicians-part-2/#sthash.S59n7oU7.dpbs|archive-date=February 19, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Cobain developed an interest in music at a young age. According to his aunt Mari, he began singing at the age of two. At age four, he started playing the piano and singing, writing a song about a trip to a local park. He listened to artists including the [[Ramones]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/verse-chorus-verse-the-recording-history-of-nirvana/|title=Verse Chorus Verse: The Recording History of Nirvana|work=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine Magazine]]|author=Gillian G.

When Cobain was nine years old, his parents divorced.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|20}} He later said the divorce had a profound effect on his life, while his mother noted that his personality changed dramatically; Cobain became defiant and withdrawn.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|17}} In a 1993 interview, he said:

{{blockquote|I remember feeling ashamed, for some reason. I was ashamed of my parents. I couldn't face some of my friends at school anymore, because I desperately wanted to have the classic, you know, typical family. Mother, father. I wanted that security, so I resented my parents for quite a few years because of that.<ref name="Savage, Jon 1997">{{cite web|last=Savage|first=John|url=http://www.nirvanafreak.net/art/art8a.shtml|title=Kurt Cobain: The Lost Interview|work=NirvanaFreak.net|access-date=April 8, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040430011407/http://www.nirvanafreak.net/art/art8a.shtml|archive-date=April 30, 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

Cobain's parents found new partners after the divorce. Although his father had promised not to remarry, he married Jenny Westeby, to Kurt's dismay.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|24}} Cobain, his father, Westeby, and her two children, Mindy and James, moved into a new household. Cobain liked Westeby at first, as she gave him the maternal attention he desired.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|25}} In January 1979, Westeby gave birth to a boy, Chad Cobain.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|24}} This new family, which Cobain insisted was not his real one, was in stark contrast to the attention Cobain was used to receiving as an only boy, and he soon began to express resentment toward his stepmother.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|24,25}} Cobain's mother began dating a man who was abusive. Cobain witnessed the [[domestic violence]] inflicted upon her, with one incident resulting in her being hospitalized with a broken arm.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|25,26}} Wendy refused to press charges, remaining committed to the relationship.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|26}}

Cobain behaved insolently toward adults during this period, and began bullying another boy at school. His father and Westeby took him to a therapist, who concluded that he would benefit from a single family environment.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|26}} Both sides of the family attempted to bring his parents back together, to no avail. On June 28, 1979, Cobain's mother granted full custody to his father.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|27}} Cobain's teenage rebellion quickly became overwhelming for his father, who placed his son in the care of family and friends. While living with the [[born-again Christian]] family of his friend Jesse Reed, he became a devout Christian and regularly attended church services. He later renounced Christianity, engaging in what was described as "anti-God" rants. The song "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]" is about his experience while living with the Reed family. Religion remained an important part of his personal life and beliefs.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|22}}<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|196}}<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|69}}

Although uninterested in sports, Cobain was enrolled in a junior high school [[wrestling]] team at the insistence of his father. He was a skilled wrestler, but despised the experience. Because of the ridicule he endured from his teammates and coach, he allowed himself to be pinned in an attempt to sadden his father. Later, his father enlisted him in a [[Little League Baseball]] team, where Cobain would intentionally [[strike out]] to avoid playing.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|20–25}} Cobain befriended a gay student at school and was bullied by peers, who concluded that he was gay. In an interview, he said that he liked being associated with a gay identity because he did not like people, and when they thought he was gay they left him alone. He said, "I started being really proud of the fact that I was gay even though I wasn't." His friend tried to kiss him and Cobain backed away, explaining to his friend that he was not gay, but remained friends with him. According to Cobain, he used to spray paint "God Is Gay" on pickup trucks in the Aberdeen area. Police records show that Cobain was arrested for spray painting the phrase "ain't got no how watchamacallit" on other vehicles.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|68}}

[[File:Cobain 1981.png|thumb|Cobain playing drums at an assembly at Montesano High School in 1981]]Cobain often drew during classes. He would draw objects, including those associated with the human anatomy.{{explain|date=March 2021}} When given a caricature assignment for an art course, Cobain drew [[Michael Jackson]], but was told by the teacher that the image was inappropriate for a school hallway. He then drew an image of then-President [[Ronald Reagan]] that was seen as "unflattering".<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|41}} Through art and electronics classes, Cobain met [[Roger "Buzz" Osborne]], singer and guitarist of the [[Melvins]], who became his friend and introduced him to [[punk rock]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] music.<ref name="gaar"/>{{rp|35,36}}<ref>{{cite AV media|publication-date= December 13, 1993|title=Kurt Cobain: "These kids really like our band"|publisher=MTV|quote=Question: So it was your friend, the Melvins' Buzz Osborne, who introduced you to punk rock?<br>Cobain: Yeah, ...

Cobain wrote in his journals of this experience, as well as in interviews, singling out the impact it had on him.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|45}}<ref>{{cite magazine|publication-date=January–February 1992|title=Better Dead Than Cool|first=Gina |last=Arnold|author-link=Gina Arnold|magazine=[[Option (music magazine)|Option]]|quote=Kurt Cobain: [The Melvins] started playing punk rock and had a free concert right behind Thriftways supermarket where Buzz worked, and they plugged into the city power supply and played punk rock music for about 50 redneck kids.

Then I asked Buzz to make me that compilation tape of punk rock songs and got a spike haircut. ... }}</ref> As a teenager living in [[Montesano, Washington]], Cobain eventually found escape through the thriving [[Pacific Northwest]] punk scene, going to punk rock shows in Seattle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}

During his second year in high school, Cobain began living with his mother in Aberdeen. Two weeks prior to graduation, he dropped out of [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]] upon realizing that he did not have enough credits to graduate. His mother gave him a choice: find employment or leave. After one week, Cobain found his clothes and other belongings packed away in boxes.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|35}} Feeling banished, Cobain stayed with friends, occasionally sneaking back into his mother's basement.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|37}} Cobain also claimed that, during periods of homelessness, he lived under a bridge over the [[Wishkah River]],<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|37}} an experience that inspired the song "[[Something in the Way]]". His future bandmate [[Krist Novoselic]] later said, "He hung out there, but you couldn't live on those muddy banks, with the tides coming up and down. That was his own revisionism."<ref name="requiem">Cross, Charles R. "Requiem for a Dream." ''Guitar World.'' October 2001.</ref>

In late 1986, Cobain moved into an apartment, paying his rent by working at the Polynesian Resort, a themed resort on the Pacific coast at [[Ocean Shores, Washington]] approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of Aberdeen.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|43}} During this period, he traveled frequently to [[Olympia, Washington]], to go to rock concerts.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|46}} During his visits to Olympia, Cobain formed a relationship with Tracy Marander. The couple had a close relationship, but one that was often strained with financial difficulties and Cobain's absence when touring. Marander supported the couple by working at the cafeteria of the [[Boeing]] plant in [[Auburn, Washington]], often stealing food. During his relationship with Marander, Cobain spent most of his time sleeping into the late evening, watching television, and concentrating on art projects. Her insistence that he get a job caused arguments that influenced Cobain to write "[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]", which was featured on the Nirvana album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]''. Marander is credited with having taken the cover photo for the album. She did not become aware that Cobain wrote "About a Girl" about her until years after his death.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|88–93}}<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|116–117}}<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|122}}<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|134–136}}<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|143}}<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|153}}

Soon after his separation from Marander, Cobain began dating [[Tobi Vail]], an influential [[punk zine]]ster of the [[riot grrrl]] band [[Bikini Kill]] who embraced the [[DIY]] ethos. After meeting Vail, Cobain vomited,  overwhelmed with anxiety caused by his infatuation with her. This event inspired the lyric "love you so much it makes me sick" in the song "[[Aneurysm (song)|Aneurysm]]".<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|152}} While Cobain regarded Vail as his female counterpart, his relationship with her waned; he desired the maternal comfort of a traditional relationship, which Vail regarded as sexist within a [[countercultural]] punk rock community. Vail's lovers were described by her friend Alice Wheeler as "fashion accessories".<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|153}} Cobain and Vail spent most of their time together discussing political and philosophical issues. In 1990, they collaborated on a musical project called Bathtub Is Real, in which they both sang and played guitar and drums. They recorded their songs on a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track tape]] machine that belonged to Vail's father. In [[Everett True]]'s 2009 book ''Nirvana: The Biography'', Vail is quoted as saying:

{{blockquote|[Kurt] would play the songs he was writing, I would play the songs I was writing and we'd record them on my dad's four-track. Sometimes I'd sing on the songs he was writing and play drums on them ... He was really into the fact that I was creative and into music. I don't think he'd ever played music with a girl before. He was super-inspiring and fun to play with.<ref>{{cite book|first=Everett|last=True|author-link=Everett True|title=Nirvana: The Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/nirvanabiography00true|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0306815546|page=[https://archive.org/details/nirvanabiography00true/page/187 187]|date=March 13, 2007}}</ref>}}

[[Slim Moon]] described their sound as "like the minimal quiet pop songs that Olympia is known for. Both of them sang; it was really good."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livenirvana.com/sessions/home/1990bathtubisreal.php|title=LIVE NIRVANA SESSIONS HISTORY: (Bathtub Is Real) 1990 – ?, Olympia, WA, US|website=livenirvana.com|access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref> Cobain's relationship with Vail inspired the lyrics of many of the songs on ''Nevermind''. While he was discussing [[anarchism]] and punk rock with friend [[Kathleen Hanna]], another member of Bikini Kill, Hanna spray-painted "Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit" on Cobain's apartment wall. [[Teen Spirit (deodorant)|Teen Spirit]] was the name of a deodorant Vail wore. Cobain, unaware of the deodorant, interpreted the slogan as having a revolutionary meaning, and it inspired the title of the Nirvana song "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".<ref>{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Queenan|title=Was Smells Like Teen Spirit really named after a deodorant|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/19/popandrock.nirvana|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=January 11, 2015|date=July 19, 2007}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== Early musical projects ===
On his 14th birthday on February 20, 1981, Cobain's uncle offered him either a bike or a used guitar; Kurt chose the guitar. Soon, he was trying to play [[Led Zeppelin]]'s song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]". He also learned how to play "[[Louie Louie]]", [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]", and [[the Cars]]' "[[My Best Friend's Girl (song)|My Best Friend's Girl]]", before he began working on his own songs. Cobain played left-handed, despite being forced to write right-handed.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|22}}

In early 1985, Cobain formed [[Fecal Matter (band)|Fecal Matter]] after he had dropped out of [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]].<ref name="gaar">Gillian G. Gaar.

During high school, Cobain rarely found anyone with whom he could play music. While hanging out at the Melvins' practice space, he met [[Krist Novoselic]], a fellow devotee of punk rock. Novoselic's mother owned a hair salon, and the pair occasionally practiced in the upstairs room of the salon. A few years later, Cobain tried to convince Novoselic to form a band with him by lending him a copy of a home demo recorded by Fecal Matter.<ref name="azerrad" />

=== Nirvana ===

{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}
<!-- Please don't significantly expand this section, it is intended to simply cover the basics of Cobain's involvement in Nirvana. The details about Nirvana's career are extensively discussed in [[Nirvana (band)]]. -->

After months of asking, Novoselic finally agreed to join Cobain, forming the beginnings of Nirvana.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|45}} Religion appeared to remain a significant muse to Cobain during this time, as he often used Christian imagery in his work, and developed a budding interest in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy. The band name "Nirvana" was taken from the [[Nirvana|Buddhist concept]], which Cobain described as "freedom from pain, suffering and the external world", a concept that he aligned with the [[punk rock]] ethos and [[Punk ideologies|ideology]].

Cobain was disenchanted after early touring, due to the band's inability to draw substantial crowds and the difficulty of sustaining themselves. During their first few years playing together, Novoselic and Cobain were hosts to a rotating list of drummers. Eventually, the band settled on [[Chad Channing]], with whom Nirvana recorded the album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released on [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]] in 1989. Cobain, however, became dissatisfied with Channing's style and subsequently fired him. He and Novoselic eventually hired [[Dave Grohl]] to replace Channing. Grohl helped the band record their 1991 major-label debut, ''[[Nevermind]]''. With ''Nevermind''{{'}}s lead single, "Smells Like Teen Spirit", Nirvana quickly entered the mainstream, popularizing a subgenre of [[alternative rock]] called "[[grunge]]".

As a result, alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the U.S. during the first half of the 1990s.

=== Collaboration with other artists ===
In 1989, members of Nirvana and fellow American [[alternative rock]] band [[Screaming Trees]] formed a side project known as the Jury. The band featured Cobain on vocals and guitar, [[Mark Lanegan]] on vocals, [[Krist Novoselic]] on [[Bass guitar|bass]] and [[Mark Pickerel]] on [[Drum kit|drums]]. Over two days of recording sessions, on August 20 and 28, 1989, the band recorded four songs also performed by [[Lead Belly]]; "[[In the Pines|Where Did You Sleep Last Night?]]", an instrumental version of "[[Grey Goose (folk song)|Grey Goose]]", "[[Ain't It a Shame]]" and "[[They Hung Him on a Cross]]"; the latter of which featured Cobain performing solo.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=http://livenirvana.com/sessions/studio/august-1989.php|title=Live Nirvana &#124; LiveNirvana.com Sessions History &#124; Studio Sessions &#124; (The Jury) August 20 & 28, 1989 – Reciprocal Recording, Seattle, WA, US|publisher=LiveNIRVANA|access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref> Cobain was inspired to record the songs after receiving a copy of ''Lead Belly's Last Sessions'' from friend [[Slim Moon]]; after hearing it he "felt a connection to Leadbelly's almost physical expressions of longing and desire."<ref>{{cite book|title=Nirvana – The True Story|last=True|first=Everett|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84449-640-2|pages=146, 636}}</ref>

In 1992, Cobain contacted  [[William S. Burroughs]] about a possible collaboration. Burroughs responded by sending him a recording of "[[The Junky's Christmas]]"<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/when_kurt_cobain_met_william_burroughs|title=When Kurt Cobain met William Burroughs|date=October 26, 2012|work=DangerousMinds|access-date=October 11, 2018}}</ref> (which he recorded in his studio in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]).<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=http://www.openculture.com/2012/12/ithe_priest_they_called_himi_a_dark_collaboration_between_kurt_cobain_william_s_burroughs.html|title=The "Priest" They Called Him: A Dark Collaboration Between Kurt Cobain & William S.

The two would meet shortly later in Lawrence, Kansas and produce "[[The "Priest" They Called Him]]", a spoken word version of "The Junky's Christmas".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":12" />

== Musical influences ==
[[The Beatles]] were an early and lasting influence on Cobain; his aunt Mari remembers him singing "[[Hey Jude]]" at the age of two.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|9}} "My aunts would give me Beatles records", Cobain told [[Jon Savage]] in 1993, "so for the most part [I listened to] the Beatles [as a child], and if I was lucky, I'd be able to buy a single."<ref name="Savage, Jon 1997"/> Cobain expressed a particular fondness for [[John Lennon]], whom he called his "idol" in his posthumously released [[Journals (Cobain)|journals]],<ref name="Cobain, Kurt 2002">{{cite book|last=Cobain|first=Kurt|url=https://archive.org/details/kurtcobainjourna00coba|title=Journals|date=2002|publisher=[[Riverhead Books|Riverhead Hardcover]]|isbn=978-1-57322-232-7|location=New York City|url-access=registration}}</ref> and he said that he wrote the song "About a Girl", from Nirvana's 1989 debut album ''Bleach'', after spending three hours listening to ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]''.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|121}}

Cobain was also a fan of 1970s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, including Led Zeppelin, [[AC/DC]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. Nirvana occasionally played cover songs by these bands, including Led Zeppelin's "[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]]", "[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]" and "[[Immigrant Song]]", Black Sabbath's "[[Hand of Doom (song)|Hand of Doom]]", and Kiss' "Do You Love Me?" and wrote the ''[[Incesticide]]'' song "Aero Zeppelin" as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. Recollecting touring with his band, Cobain stated, “I used to take a nap in the van and listen to Queen. Over and over again and drain the battery on the van. We’d be stuck with a dead battery because I’d listened to Queen too much”.<ref>{{cite news |first=Amy|last=Weller|title=If it wasn't for Freddie Mercury... 13 artists inspired by the Queen icon |url=https://www.gigwise.com/photos/84002/9/if-it-wasnt-for-freddie-mercury-13-artists-inspired-by-the-queen-icon |date=September 5, 2013|access-date=March 13, 2018 |work=Gigwise}}</ref>

He was introduced to punk rock and hardcore music by his Aberdeen classmate [[Buzz Osborne]], lead singer and guitarist of the [[Melvins]], who taught Cobain about punk by loaning him records and old copies of the Detroit-based magazine ''[[Creem]]''.<ref name=DailyHerald>{{cite news|last=Guarino|first=Mark|title=Heavy heaven New Cobain bio sheds light on fallen hero.|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-79153994|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210222111506/https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-79153994|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 22, 2021|access-date=January 3, 2013|newspaper=Daily Herald (Arlington Heights, Illinois)|date=October 12, 2001|quote=Soon band member Roger "Buzz" Osborne started Cobain's schooling, loaning him records and old copies of the '70s rock magazine ''Creem''.}}</ref> Punk rock proved to be a profound influence on a teenaged Cobain's attitude and artistic style. His first punk rock album was ''[[Sandinista!]]'' by [[The Clash]],<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|169}} but he became a bigger fan of fellow 1970s British punk band the [[Sex Pistols]], describing them as "one million times more important than the Clash" in his journals.<ref name="Cobain, Kurt 2002"/> He quickly discovered contemporary American hardcore bands like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Millions of Dead Cops]] and [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]].<ref name=DailyHerald/> The Melvins themselves were a major early musical influence on Cobain; his admiration for them led him to drive their van on tour and help them to carry their equipment.<ref name="gaar"/>{{rp|42}}<ref name="cross-2008"/>{{rp|153}} He and Novoselic watched hundreds of Melvins rehearsals and "learned almost everything from them", as stated by Cobain.<ref>{{cite magazine|publication-date=March 1992|date=November 17, 1991 |title=Kurt Cobain, Il Punk Da Un Milione Di Dollari|language=it|magazine=[[w:it:Rumore (rivista)|Rumore]]|first=Claudio |last=Sorge|author-link=w:it:Claudio Sorge|location=Mezzago, Italy|quote=Kurt Cobain: Ci aggregammo subito ai Melvins, che erano anche loro di Aberdeen.

Cobain was also a fan of [[protopunk]] acts like [[the Stooges]], whose 1973 album ''[[Raw Power]]'' he listed as his favorite of all time in his journals,<ref name="Cobain, Kurt 2002"/> and [[The Velvet Underground]], whose 1968 song "[[Here She Comes Now]]" the band covered both live and in the studio.

The 1980s American [[alternative rock]] band [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] were instrumental in helping an adult Cobain develop his own songwriting style. In a 1992 interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Cobain said that hearing their 1988 debut album, ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'', "convinced him to abandon his more Black Flag-influenced songwriting in favor of the [[Iggy Pop]]/Aerosmith–type songwriting that appeared on ''Nevermind''.<ref>Cobain, Kurt. "Kurt Cobain of Nirvana Talks About the Records That Changed His Life. ''[[Melody Maker]]''. August 29, 1992.</ref> In a 1993 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he said that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was his attempt at "trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that band—or at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard".<ref name="pixies">Fricke, David. "Kurt Cobain: The Rolling Stone Interview". ''Rolling Stone''. January 27, 1994</ref>

Cobain's appreciation of early alternative rock bands also extended to [[Sonic Youth]] and [[R.E.M.]], both of which the members of Nirvana befriended and looked up to for advice. It was under recommendation from Sonic Youth's [[Kim Gordon]] that Nirvana signed to [[DGC Records|DGC]] in 1990,<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|162}} and both bands did a two-week tour of Europe in the summer of 1991, as documented in the 1992 documentary, ''[[1991: The Year Punk Broke]]''. In 1993, Cobain said of R.E.M.: "If I could write just a couple of songs as good as what they've written... I don't know how that band does what they do. God, they're the greatest. They've dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music".<ref name="pixies"/>

After attaining mainstream success, Cobain became a devoted champion of lesser known [[indie rock|indie]] bands, covering songs by [[The Vaselines]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[Wipers]] and [[Fang (band)|Fang]] onstage and/or in the studio, wearing [[Daniel Johnston]] [[T-shirts]] during photo shoots, having the [[K Records]] logo tattooed on his forearm, and enlisting bands like [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Shonen Knife]], [[Chokebore]] and [[Half Japanese]] along for the ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour in late 1993 and early 1994. Cobain even invited his favorite musicians to perform with him: ex-[[Germs (band)|Germs]] guitarist [[Pat Smear]] joined the band in 1993, and the Meat Puppets appeared onstage during Nirvana's 1993 ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' appearance to perform three songs from their second album, ''[[Meat Puppets II]]''.

Nirvana's ''Unplugged'' set includes renditions of "[[The Man Who Sold the World (song)|The Man Who Sold the World]]", by [[David Bowie]], and the American folk song, "[[In the Pines|Where Did You Sleep Last Night]]", as adapted by [[Lead Belly]]. Cobain introduced the latter by calling Lead Belly his favorite performer, and in a 1993 interview revealed he had been introduced to him from reading the American author [[William S. Burroughs]], saying: "I remember [Burroughs] saying in an interview, 'These new rock'n'roll kids should just throw away their guitars and listen to something with real soul, like Leadbelly.' I'd never heard about Leadbelly before so I bought a couple of records, and now he turns out to be my absolute favorite of all time in music. I absolutely love it more than any rock'n'roll I ever heard."<ref name="Laurence">{{cite web|url=http://romanceisdead.net/spip.php?article30|title=Kurt Cobain interview Date : 08/10/1993 Location : Seattle Ze Full Version Uncut !!!|publisher=Romance Is Dead|author=Laurence Romance|date=April 21, 2010|access-date=April 8, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412030834/http://romanceisdead.net/spip.php?article30|archive-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref> The album ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]'' was released posthumously in 1994.

It was going to be an amazing fucking record, and I'm a little bit angry at him for killing himself. He and I were going to record a trial run of the album, a demo tape. It was all set up.

Cobain originally wanted ''Nevermind'' to be divided into two sides: a "Boy" side, for the songs written about the experiences of his early life and childhood, and a "Girl" side, for the songs written about his dysfunctional relationship with Vail.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|177}} [[Charles R.

Cobain was affected enough to write "[[Polly (Nirvana song)|Polly]]" from ''Nevermind'' after reading a newspaper story of an incident in 1987, when a 14-year-old girl was kidnapped after attending a punk rock show then raped and tortured with a [[Blow torch|blowtorch]]. She escaped after gaining the trust of her captor [[Gerald Friend]] through flirting with him.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|136}} After seeing Nirvana perform, [[Bob Dylan]] cited "Polly" as the best of Nirvana's songs, and said of Cobain, "the kid has heart".<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|137}} [[Patrick Süskind]]'s novel ''[[Perfume (novel)|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer]]'' inspired Cobain to write the song "Scentless Apprentice" from ''In Utero''. The book is a historical horror novel about a [[perfumer]]'s apprentice born with no body odor of his own but with a highly developed sense of smell, and who attempts to create the "ultimate perfume" by killing virginal women and taking their scent.<ref>Gaar 2006, pp. 42–43</ref>

Cobain immersed himself in artistic projects throughout his life, as much so as he did in songwriting. The sentiments of his art work followed the same subjects of his lyrics, often expressed through a dark and macabre sense of humor. Noted were his fascination with [[physiology]], his own rare medical conditions, and the human anatomy. According to Novoselic, "Kurt said that he never liked literal things. He liked cryptic things. He would cut out pictures of meat from grocery-store fliers, then paste these orchids on them ... And all this stuff on [''In Utero''] about the body – there was something about anatomy. He really liked that. You look at his art – there are these people, and they're all weird, like mutants.

The artwork seen in his ''Journals'' later drew acclaim. Many of Cobain's paintings, collages, and sculptures appeared in the artwork of Nirvana's albums, such as the covers of ''[[Incesticide]]'' and ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]''. His concepts featured in Nirvana's music videos, sometimes leading to arguments with the video producers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Cobain contributed backing guitar for a [[spoken word]] recording of beat poet [[William S.

On February 24, 1992, a few days after the conclusion of Nirvana's "[[Pacific Rim]]" tour, Cobain and Love were married on [[Waikiki Beach]] in Hawaii. Love wore a satin and lace dress once owned by Frances Farmer, and Cobain donned a Guatemalan purse and wore green pajamas, because he had been "too lazy to put on a tux."

=== Health ===
Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic [[bronchitis]] and intense physical pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|66}} His first drug experience was with [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in 1980, at age 13. He regularly used the drug during adulthood.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|76}} Cobain also had a period of consuming "notable" amounts of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], as observed by Marander,<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|75}} and was "really into getting fucked up: drugs, acid, any kind of drug", observed Krist Novoselic; Cobain was also prone to alcoholism and [[solvent abuse]].<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|76}} According to ''The Telegraph'', Cobain had [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Haig|title=Kurt Cobain was not a 'tortured genius', he had an illness|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11515605/Kurt-Cobain-was-not-a-tortured-genius-he-had-an-illness.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=April 5, 2015}}</ref> His cousin brought attention to the family history of suicide, mental illness and alcoholism, noting two of her uncles who had died by suicide with guns.<ref>{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Libby|url=http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/cobainqa|title=Even in His Youth|work=AHealthyMe.com |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202043704/http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/cobainqa|archive-date=February 2, 2007|access-date=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

Cobain's first experience with [[heroin]] occurred sometime in 1986, administered to him by a local drug dealer in [[Tacoma, Washington]], who had previously supplied him with [[oxycodone]] and [[aspirin]].<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|41}} He used heroin sporadically for several years, but, by the end of 1990, his use had developed into a full-fledged [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]. Cobain claimed that he was "determined to get a habit" as a way to self-medicate his stomach condition. "It started with three days in a row of doing heroin and I don't have a stomach pain. That was such a relief", he related.<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|236}} However, longtime friend Buzz Osborne disputes this, saying that his stomach pain was more likely caused by his heroin use, saying "He made it up for sympathy and so he could use it as an excuse to stay loaded. Of course he was vomiting—that's what people on heroin do, they vomit. It's called 'vomiting with a smile on your face.'"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thetalkhouse.com/music/talks/buzz-osborne-the-melvins-talks/ |title=Buzz Osborne (the Melvins) Talks the HBO Documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck &#124; The Talkhouse Music |publisher=Thetalkhouse.com |date=June 6, 2015 |access-date=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119080439/http://thetalkhouse.com/music/talks/buzz-osborne-the-melvins-talks/ |archive-date=November 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

His heroin use began to affect the band's ''Nevermind'' supporting tour. One such example came the day of the band's 1992 performance on ''Saturday Night Live'', where Nirvana had a photographic session with [[Michael Lavine]]. Having used heroin beforehand, Cobain fell asleep several times during the shoot. Cobain divulged to biographer [[Michael Azerrad]], "I mean, what are they supposed to do? They're not going to be able to tell me to stop. So I really didn't care. Obviously to them it was like practicing [[witchcraft]] or something. They didn't know anything about it so they thought that any second, I was going to die."<ref name="azerrad" />{{rp|241}} The morning after the band's performance on ''Saturday Night Live'', Cobain experienced his first near-death overdose after injecting heroin; Love resuscitated him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.com:80/JamMusicArtistsN/nirvana.html|title=Legacy|date=April 8, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803123238/http://www.canoe.com/JamMusicArtistsN/nirvana.html|access-date=July 27, 2020|archive-date=August 3, 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Prior to a performance at the New Music Seminar in New York City on July 23, 1993, Cobain suffered another heroin overdose. Rather than calling for an ambulance, Love injected Cobain with [[naloxone]] to bring him out of his unconscious state. Cobain proceeded to perform with Nirvana, giving the public every indication that everything was business as usual.<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|296–297}}

==Death==
{{Main|Suicide of Kurt Cobain}}
[[File:Kurt'sNote.jpg|thumb|Cobain's suicide note. The final phrase before the [[valediction]], "It's better to burn out than to fade away", is a quote from the lyrics of [[Neil Young]]'s song "[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]".]]
Following a tour stop at [[Munich-Riem airport|Terminal Eins]] in Munich, Germany, on March 1, 1994, Cobain was diagnosed with [[bronchitis]] and severe [[laryngitis]]. He flew to Rome the next day for medical treatment, and was joined there by his wife, [[Courtney Love]], on March 3, 1994. The next morning, Love awoke to find that Cobain had overdosed on a combination of champagne and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]]. Cobain was immediately rushed to the hospital and was unconscious for the rest of the day. After five days in the hospital, Cobain was released and returned to Seattle.<ref name="Halperin"/> Love later stated that the incident was Cobain's first [[suicide attempt]].<ref name="life after death">{{cite web|last=Fricke|first=David|author-link=David Fricke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/courtneylove/articles/story/5937442/life_after_death|title=Courtney Love: Life After Death|work=Rolling Stone|date=December 15, 1994|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413090248/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/courtneylove/articles/story/5937442/life_after_death|archive-date=April 13, 2009|access-date=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

On March 18, 1994, Love phoned the [[Seattle Police Department|Seattle police]] informing them that Cobain was suicidal and had locked himself in a room with a gun. Police arrived and confiscated several guns and a bottle of pills from Cobain, who insisted that he was not suicidal and had locked himself in the room to hide from Love.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kurt-cobains-downward-spiral-the-last-days-of-nirvanas-leader-19940602|quote=she told them...he was going to kill himself.

Love arranged an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] regarding Cobain's drug use on March 25, 1994. The ten people involved included musician friends, record company executives, and one of Cobain's closest friends, [[Dylan Carlson (musician)|Dylan Carlson]]. Cobain reacted with anger, insulting and heaping scorn on the participants and eventually locking himself in the upstairs bedroom. However, by the end of the day, Cobain agreed to undergo a [[Drug detoxification|detox]] program.<ref name="The1994">{{cite web| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940511&slug=1909954 |work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=May 11, 1994|title=Questions Linger After Cobain Suicide |access-date=January 20, 2019}}</ref> Cobain arrived at the Exodus Recovery Center in Los Angeles on March 30, 1994. The staff were unaware of Cobain's history of depression and suicide attempts. When visited by friends, there was no indication to them that Cobain was in any negative state of mind. He spent the day talking to counselors about his drug abuse and personal problems, happily playing with his daughter Frances. These interactions were the last time Cobain saw his daughter.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Questions Linger After Cobain Suicide -- Credit-Card Activity, Details Of Last Days Intrigue Investigators {{!}} The Seattle Times|url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19940511&slug=1909954|access-date=2021-06-18|website=archive.seattletimes.com}}</ref>

The following night, Cobain walked outside to have a cigarette and climbed over a six-foot-high fence to leave the facility (which he had joked earlier in the day would be a stupid feat to attempt). He took a taxi to Los Angeles Airport and flew back to Seattle. On the flight, he sat near [[Duff McKagan]] of [[Guns N' Roses]]. Despite Cobain's animosity towards Guns N' Roses, Cobain "seemed happy" to see McKagan. McKagan later stated he knew from "all of my instincts that something was wrong".<ref name="cross-2001" />{{rp|331}} Most of Cobain's friends and family were unaware of his whereabouts. On April 2 and 3, Cobain was spotted in numerous locations around Seattle. On April 3, Love contacted private investigator Tom Grant, and hired him to find Cobain. Cobain was not seen the next day. On April 7, amid rumors of Nirvana breaking up, the band pulled out of the 1994 [[Lollapalooza]] festival.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-21|title=Nirvana Pulls Out of Tour Plan : Pop music: Amid reports of a breakup, the band withdraws from talks about headlining this summer's 'Lollapalooza '94,' citing singer Kurt Cobain's health problems. - Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-04-06-ca-42770-story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200521055811/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-04-06-ca-42770-story.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-05-21|access-date=2021-06-18}}</ref>

In March 2014, the Seattle police developed four rolls of film that had been left in an evidence vault; no reason was provided for why the rolls were not developed earlier. According to the Seattle police, the 35mm film photographs show the scene of Cobain's dead body more clearly than previous Polaroid images taken by the police. Detective Mike Ciesynski, a [[cold case]] investigator, was instructed to look at the film because "it is 20 years later and it's a high media case". Ciesynski stated that Cobain's death remains a suicide and that the images would not have been released publicly.<ref name="Kiro">{{cite web|title=Seattle police re-examine Cobain suicide, develop scene photos|url=http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/only-kiro-7-seattle-police-re-investigate-kurt-cob/nfHMq/|work=kirotv.com|publisher=Cox Media Group|access-date=March 27, 2014|author=Casey McNerthney|author2=Amy Clancy|date=March 20, 2014|archive-date=March 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326230140/http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/only-kiro-7-seattle-police-re-investigate-kurt-cob/nfHMq/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The photos in question were later released, one by one, weeks before the 20th anniversary of Cobain's death.

== Media on Cobain ==
=== Books ===
Prior to Cobain's death, Michael Azerrad published ''[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]'', a book chronicling Nirvana's career from its beginning, as well as the personal histories of the band members. The book explored Cobain's drug addiction, as well as the countless controversies surrounding the band. After Cobain's death, Azerrad republished the book to include a final chapter discussing the last year of Cobain's life. The book involved the band members themselves, who provided interviews and personal information to Azerrad specifically for the book. In 2006, Azerrad's taped conversations with Cobain were transformed into a documentary about Cobain, titled ''[[Kurt Cobain: About a Son]]''. Though this film does not feature any music by Nirvana, it has songs by the artists that inspired Cobain.

Journalists [[Ian Halperin]] and [[Max Wallace]] published their investigation of any possible conspiracy surrounding Cobain's death in their 1999 book ''[[Who Killed Kurt Cobain?]]''. Halperin and Wallace argued that, while there was not enough evidence to prove a conspiracy, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened.<ref>Halperin & Wallace, p. 202</ref> The book included the journalists' discussions with Tom Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation that he had undertaken while he was in Love's employ. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's ''[[Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain]]''.

In 2001, writer Charles R. Cross published a biography of Cobain, titled ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]]''. For the book, Cross conducted over 400 interviews, and was given access by Courtney Love to Cobain's journals, lyrics, and diaries.<ref name="Heavierthan">{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperionbooks.com/book/heavier-than-heaven-a-biography-of-kurt-cobain/|title=Heavier than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain|publisher=HyperionBooks.com|access-date=July 26, 2009}}</ref> Cross' biography was met with criticism, including allegations of Cross accepting secondhand (and incorrect) information as fact.<ref>''Nirvana: the True Story'' by [[Everett True]]</ref> Friend [[Everett True]] – who derided the book as being inaccurate, omissive, and highly biased – said ''Heavier than Heaven'' was "the Courtney-sanctioned version of history"<ref name="SmellsLike2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=184892|title=Smells Like Everett True – Books – The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper|publisher=Thestranger.com|date=March 27, 2007|access-date=April 8, 2012}}</ref> or, alternatively, Cross's "Oh, I think I need to find the new [[Bruce Springsteen]] now" Kurt Cobain book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|title=MAGNET Interview: Everett True|work=magnetmagazine.com|author=Matthew Fritch|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030617162627/http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|archive-date=June 17, 2003|access-date=April 5, 2012}}</ref> However, beyond the criticism, the book contained details about Cobain and Nirvana's career that would have otherwise been unnoted. In 2008, Cross published ''[[Cobain Unseen]]'', a compilation of annotated photographs and creations and writings by Cobain throughout his life and career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/23454963/cobain_unseen_rare_photos_artw/photo/17|title=Cobain Unseen: Rare Photos, Artwork and Journal Entries|work=Rolling Stone|author=Charles M.

Cross}}</ref>

In 2002, a sampling of Cobain's writings was published as ''[[Journals (Cobain)|Journals]]''. The book fills 280 pages with a simple black cover; the pages are arranged somewhat chronologically (although Cobain generally did not date them). The journal pages are reproduced in color, and there is a section added at the back with explanations and transcripts of some of the less legible pages. The writings begin in the late 1980s and were continued until his death. A paperback version of the book, released in 2003, included a handful of writings that were not offered in the initial release. In the journals, Cobain talked about the ups and downs of life on the road, made lists of what music he was enjoying, and often scribbled down lyric ideas for future reference. Upon its release, reviewers and fans were conflicted about the collection. Many were elated to be able to learn more about Cobain and read his inner thoughts in his own words, but were disturbed by what was viewed as an [[Invasion of privacy|invasion of his privacy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |title=Nirvana releases a hit and miss|work=Notre Dame Observer|date=November 19, 2002|author=David Hartwig|url-status=dead|access-date=April 8, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307110632/http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |archive-date=March 7, 2004 }}</ref>

In 2009, [[ECW Press]] released a book titled ''Grunge is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music''.

Cobain was also apparently 'the biggest influence' on the 2020 novel ''Dead Rock Stars'', by the English author [[Guy Mankowski]], particularly given Cobain's "message of feminism". Of the musician, Mankowski said, "I think he raised the consciousness."<ref name="narcmagazine.com">{{Cite web|url=http://narcmagazine.com/six-of-the-best-guy-mankowski/|title=Six Of The Best: Guy Mankowski|website=Narcmagazine.com|access-date=September 14, 2020}}</ref>

=== Film and television ===
In the 1998 documentary ''[[Kurt & Courtney]]'', filmmaker [[Nick Broomfield]] investigated Tom Grant's claim that Cobain was actually murdered. He took a film crew to visit a number of people associated with Cobain and Love; Love's father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couple's former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to [[The Mentors|Mentors]] bandleader [[Eldon Hoke|Eldon "El Duce" Hoke]], who claimed Love offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed he knew who killed Cobain, he failed to mention a name, and offered no evidence to support his assertion. Broomfield inadvertently captured Hoke's last interview, as he died days later, reportedly hit by a train. However, Broomfield felt he had not uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, Broomfield summed it up by saying:

{{blockquote|I think that he committed suicide. I don't think there's a smoking gun. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. I just think that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Prairie|url=http://www.minireviews.com/interviews/broomfield.htm|title=Kurt and Courtney: Interview with Nick Broomfield|work=Minireviews.com|access-date=April 5, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010301212925/http://www.minireviews.com/interviews/broomfield.htm|archive-date=March 1, 2001}}</ref>}}

Regarding the depiction of Nirvana, and in particular Kurt Cobain, the indie rock author Andrew Earles wrote:

{{blockquote|Never has a rock band's past been so retroactively distorted into an irreversible fiction by incessant mythologizing, conjecture, wild speculation, and romanticizing rhetoric. The Cobain biographical narrative - specifically in regard to the culturally irresponsible mishandling of subjects such as drug abuse, depression, and suicide - is now impenetrable with inaccurate and overcooked connectivity between that which is completely unrelated, too chronologically disparate, or just plain untrue.|Andrew Earles<ref>{{cite book|last1=Earles|first1=Andrew|last2=Cross|first2=Charles|last3=Gaar|first3=Gillian G.|last4=Gendron|first4=Bob|last5=Martens|first5=Todd|last6=Yarm|first6=Mark|title=Kurt Cobain and Nirvana - Updated Edition: The Complete Illustrated History|publisher=Voyaguer Press|year=2016|chapter=Ch6 - Sigh Eternally|pages=187|isbn=978-0760351789|chapter-url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=GwyQDAAAQBAJ|page=187}}}}</ref>}}
