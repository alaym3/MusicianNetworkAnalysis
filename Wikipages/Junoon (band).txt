==History==

===Early years (1980 – 1989)===
Junoon's roots stretch back to [[Tappan, New York]], in the 1970s. [[Salman Ahmad]] left [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]], for New York with his family when he was eleven, and received his baptism in rock music when a friend offered him a ticket to a [[Led Zeppelin]] concert. Salman Ahmad was so enthralled by the show that he saved $235 to buy his own electric guitar. He also befriended [[Brian O'Connell (musician)|Brian O'Connell]] in Tappan, another young aspiring musician, with whom Ahmad formed their first band together by the name of "Eclipse". Salman Ahmad's parents moved back to Pakistan in 1981, and Salman began to study medicine at Lahore's [[King Edward Medical University|King Edward Medical College]].<ref name=Junoon-Biography>[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003880/Junoon.html Junoon – Biography] Retrieved on 30 May 2010</ref><ref>[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/prof-rock-star-urges-muslim-students-in-queens-to-rock-out/#more-161771 ‘Prof. Rock Star’ Urges Muslim Students in Queens to Rock Out] Retrieved on 25 July 2010</ref>

In 1987, [[Nusrat Hussain]], by then the lead guitarist of the band [[Vital Signs (band)|Vital Signs]], after composing the song "[[Dil Dil Pakistan]]" parted ways with Vital Signs and suggested to [[Rohail Hyatt]], founder and keyboardist of Vital Signs, to bring [[Salman Ahmad]] as his replacement in the band. Vital Signs then went on to record their debut album at the [[EMI Studios]] in [[Karachi]], but almost all the songs were written and composed at Salman Ahmad's residence where the band had been lodged. In March 1989, the band released their debut album, ''[[Vital Signs 1]]'', which was a success throughout the country. The following year, Salman Ahmad parted ways with the most successful pop band of [[Pakistan]] as he wanted a change in the band's music for their second album and therefore after leaving the band he went on to form his own band.<ref>[http://www.chowk.com/articles/10653 Vital Signs: A Personal History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011112707/http://www.chowk.com/articles/10653 |date=11 October 2010 }} Retrieved on 13 August 2010</ref>

===Formation (1990 – 1993)===

Visible from left to right are; Ustad Ashiq Ali Mir and [[Salman Ahmad]].]]Junoon formed in 1990 when Salman Ahmad, founder, songwriter and lead guitarist, had a dream where one of his teachers shook him and said "Tumhey mousiqui ka Junoon hai!"

Their self-titled debut album, ''[[Junoon (Junoon album)|Junoon]]'', recorded at the [[EMI Studios]] in [[Karachi]] barely made a dent in the [[Pakistani music]] industry when released in September 1991.<ref name=Junoon-Interview/> After the release of their debut album, Nusrat Hussain parted ways with the band to pursue his own career as a solo singer and went on to release his debut solo album ''[[Amrit (album)|Amrit]]'' in 1992.<ref>[http://www.historyofpia.com/people62.htm Capt. Nusrat Hussain] Retrieved on 27 July 2010</ref>

After the departure of Nusrat Hussain, Salman Ahmad contacted [[Brian O'Connell (musician)|Brian O'Connell]] and invited him to play bass on the band's second album. Brian O'Connell quit his job as a social worker and travelled 10,000 miles to [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]], where he reunited with his old friend. It was after ten years both the friends reunited.<ref name=Junoon-Biography/> In 1992, the band started working on their second studio album. The album was recorded and mixed at Tahir Gul Hasan's Sound on Sound recording studios in Karachi. While working on their second album at one side, on the other hand the band also featured in a television series, ''[[Talaash (Pakistani TV series)|Talaash]]'', directed by [[Atiqa Odho]] and written by [[Anwar Maqsood]], based on the true story of the band in which the band members acted themselves and due to its novel storyline it became an extremely popular television series in Pakistan.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzFU3DMCqcE Talaash PTV Show] Retrieved on 24 July 2010.</ref>

On 23 September 1993, Junoon released their second album ''[[Talaash (album)|Talaash]]''. Singles from the album, such as "[[Talaash (song)|Talaash]]", were politically influenced and became subject to censorship, which led to the eventual ban.

===Rise to fame (1994 – 1997)===

In 1994, Junoon started working on their third studio album. In 1995, the band released their first compilation album, ''[[Kashmakash]]'', which is the first such compilation album by a band in [[Pakistan]]. 1995 was also the year that Junoon's manager, Shehryar Ahmad, set up Junoon's website, www.junoon.com, which was the first ever website of any Pakistani music group. That year Junoon were courted for the controversial video release of the single "[[Ehtesaab]]", from ''Kashmakash'', which included footage of a polo pony eating in a posh restaurant. Many thought that the image was an indictment of the corrupt Pakistani political elite, and especially of former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=F5_VlFyCIBgC&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&dq=%22Ehtesaab%22+%28political+accountability%29#v=onepage&q=%22Ehtesaab%22%20%28political%20accountability%29&f=false Rock & Roll Jihad] Retrieved on 22 July 2010.</ref> The government quickly responded to it and banned the song and video from the state television.<ref name=Junoon-Biography/> In 1996, the band released their third studio album, ''[[Inquilaab (album)|Inquilaab]]'', which was recorded and engineered with a completely new sound at Aamir Hasan Studios, ''[[Inquilaab (album)|Inquilaab]]'' was a blend of western music with classical eastern Sufi music. It was the release of their third album when Junoon started to gain success and began to reach a wider audience when one of their singles, "[[Jazba-e-Junoon]]", became the signature song of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup|Cricket World Cup]].<ref name=Junoon-Biography/> [[File:Junoon-cdazadi.jpg|thumb|left|250px| Junoon's fourth studio album, ''[[Azadi (album)|Azadi]]'', hit platinum sales for which the band received a platinum certification.

Following the success of "Inquilaab", in 1997 Junoon went on their first full-scale tour of the United States, performing from [[Birmingham, Alabama]], to Los Angeles where they appeared at the [[House of Blues]]<ref name=Junoon-Biography/> and at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (New York)|New York's Roosevelt Hotel]], which was reviewed in the international edition of ''[[Newsweek Magazine]]''. They also went on tour to Canada and the [[UAE]] through which Junoon's fame grew rapidly. In September 1997, Junoon released their fourth studio album, ''[[Azadi (album)|Azadi]]'', which was the band's first international record deal after the band manager, Shehryar Ahmad, secured a deal with [[EMI]]/[[Virgin Records]] which released Azadi as Junoon's debut album in [[India]]. Within three weeks of the release of ''Azadi'', the album had sold over a million copies in India alone and hit platinum sales status in a record of four weeks.<ref name=Junoon-Biography/><ref>[http://www.screenindia.com/old/may08/music4.htm Junoon's album Azadi hits platinum in record time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915161902/http://www.screenindia.com/old/may08/music4.htm |date=15 September 2008 }} Retrieved on 1 April 1998.</ref> The music video of the first single, "[[Sayonee]]", was shot by Pakistani director [[Asim Raza]].

The band's first appearance of the tour was held in New Delhi, India. After travelling throughout the country, Junoon saw crowds of as many as of 100,000 fans at shows in Lucknow, Kanpur, Bangalore and Delhi. On this very first tour of India, Junoon was in Chandigarh when India tested its nuclear weapons at Pokhran (14 May 1998).  The next day from their hotel room in New Delhi, in interviews to CNN and BBC on the nuclear tests, Junoon's founder [[Salman Ahmad]] suggested that the Indian and Pakistani leaders should spend more on education and health than on weapons of mass destruction.<ref name=Junoon-Biography/> The Pakistani Government reacted by banning Junoon from performing in the country, as well as bans on the band's music being aired on Pakistani radio or television. Pakistan's Ministry of Information and Culture formally charged Junoon with challenging "the national opinion on the nuclear tests", as well as making comments in India "amounting to sedition and treason". Junoon denied all charges, reminding people of the fact that they had been victimised since the release of "Ehtesaab" because they chose to speak out against political corruption.<ref>{{cite news | first=Salil | last=Subedi | title=Songs of Freedom | date= 16 March 2001 | work=The Nepali Times| url =http://www.nepalitimes.com/issue/2001/03/16/Leisure/8290| access-date = 16 March 2001 }}</ref>

Salman Ahmed while talking about his latest project at [[Asia Talk]] on [[BBC]] said, "For almost a decade, Junaid has always asked me not to bring guitar or to ask him to sing. When you are friends with somebody you always have to transcend differences and I respect Junaid's views. Junaid once told me that his biggest regret was not to be a part of Jazba Junoon's recording. So when we came up with 'Naya Pakistan', I asked him that this is the chance that's not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all." and further added "it signifies the metaphor for unity as we have to compromise for unity in hope of Naya Pakistan."<ref>[https://soundcloud.com/aania-shah/bbc-interview-premiere-of-naya BBC interview premier of Naya Pakistan] Retrieved on 26 February 2013.</ref>

==Music==
{{listen
 | filename = Junoon-nomore.ogg
 | title = No More
 | description = No More, from the live album ''[[Junoon for Peace]]''. The song is based on a poem by musician, lyricist and journalist, Polar Levine.
 }}

===Language===

On their debut album ''[[Junoon (Junoon album)|Junoon]]'' and their second album ''[[Talaash (album)|Talaash]]'', songs were written in both the English and Urdu languages, but since then the band has only written songs in Urdu, with the only exceptions being "No More" from the live album ''[[Junoon for Peace]]'' and the single "Piya (Ocean of Love)", which is a duet with [[Morten Harket]] of [[A-ha]]. The soundtrack album ''[[Rock & Roll Jihad]]'' released in 2010 contain five tracks written in English by [[Salman Ahmad]]. Some of the songs recorded by Junoon are based on traditional or Sufi compositions in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], and other languages spoken in Pakistan.

===Influence===
[[Salman Ahmad]], writer of most of the band's lyrics and [[Sheet music|music scores]], says that he gets most of his inspiration for Junoon's songs from [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] music.<ref name=Junoon-Interview/> Songs like "Lal Meri Pat" (from ''[[Azadi (album)|Azadi]]''), "Dharti" (from ''[[Andaz (album)|Andaz]]'') and "Mera Mahi" (from ''[[Inquilaab (album)|Inquilaab]]'') are some examples of this influence. Another great influence of the band was poetry. The lyrics for the song "Khwaab" was taken by a poem called"khwaab hakikat na sahi" by a poet named Faiza Fiza in her book, chaand aur mein. Other songs, such as "[[Garaj Baras]]" and "Taara Jala" (from ''[[Dewaar]]'') have elements of [[hard rock]],<ref>[http://www.eomag.com/reviews/music/junoon_deewar.htm Junoon Dewaar review] Retrieved on 4 June 2010</ref> and some others, like "[[Yaar Bina]]" (from ''Azadi''), "Zamane Ke Andaz" (from ''Andaz'') and the album ''[[Parvaaz]]'' have elements of classical music. Bands stated as influence include Led Zeppelin, [[Pink Floyd]], [[Van Halen]], [[U2]], [[Bee Gees]], [[A-ha]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name=Junoon-Interview/>

Poetry by famous poets like [[Rumi|Maulana Rumi]], [[Allama Iqbal]] and [[Bulleh Shah]] are also a big influence on Junoon's music.<ref>{{cite news | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Pop Review| date=11 August 1998 | work=[[The New York Times]] | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/11/arts/pop-review-moving-the-spirit-and-feet-with-ancient-utterances-updated.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FC%2FCentral%20Park%20Summerstage&scp=10&sq=Junoon&st=cse| access-date = 14 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=In Performance| date= May 2002 | work=[[The New York Times]] | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/08/arts/in-performance-pop-divine-and-secular-love-expressed-in-rock-style.html?scp=7&sq=Junoon&st=cse| access-date = 19 May 2009 }}</ref>
