===Formation and ''Orchestra of Wolves'' (2005–2008)===
Gallows formed in 2005<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://style43.com/news/2007/05/03/exclusive-gallows-interview/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011100327/http://style43.com/news/2007/05/03/exclusive-gallows-interview/|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 October 2007|title=Style 43 » Blog Archive » EXCLUSIVE GALLOWS INTERVIEW.|date=11 October 2007|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> and released their debut album ''[[Orchestra of Wolves]]'' in 2006 on In at the Deep End Records. The album received acclaim and caught the attention of [[Bad Religion]]'s [[Brett Gurewitz]], who released it in the US on Epitaph Records, with new tracks including a cover of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag's]] "Nervous Breakdown". In an interview Gurewitz named ''Orchestra of Wolves'' as one of his favourite albums of 2007, praising it as being the best hardcore album since [[Refused]]'s ''[[The Shape of Punk to Come]]''.

Gallows' 2007 tour included stops at the [[South by Southwest]] showcase festival, [[Warped Tour 2007]], [[Download Festival]], [[Taste of Chaos]], and the [[Reading Festival]], where the band paused its performance so singer Frank Carter could get tattooed onstage by [[New Found Glory]] guitarist [[Chad Gilbert]].

The band won the 2007 [[Kerrang! Award]] for best British Newcomer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.kerrangawards.com/2007/08/best_british_newcomer.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830192145/http://blog.kerrangawards.com/2007/08/best_british_newcomer.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 August 2007|title=Best British Newcomer &#124; Kerrang Awards 2007|date=30 August 2007|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

In January 2008, the band's show at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Anaheim]], [[California]] was cancelled after [[Disney]], reportedly after listening to ''Orchestra of Wolves'', chose to ban them from performing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.launch.yahoo.com/dyna/article.html?a=/080121/340/hs3i9.html&e=l_news_dm |title=Yahoo Celebrity UK: Showbiz news & gossip around the clock |publisher=Uk.news.launch.yahoo.com |date=2011-04-20 |access-date=2014-07-25}}</ref>

Gallows contributed a cover of "Wrathchild" to ''[[Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden]]''.

On 18 August 2008, the song ''Gold Dust'' was made available on the band's [[MySpace]] profile. They stated that the song would not appear on the second studio album, saying it was "...just a little treat for everyone that's been asking for new Gallows songs for a while."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrashhits.com/2008/08/gallows-to-release-new-track-on-myspace |title=Gallows to release new track on MySpace |publisher=Thrash Hits |access-date=2014-07-25}}</ref>

On 17 December 2010, the band played at [[Dingwalls]], in [[Camden, London]], during the afternoon, and performed the entire ''[[Orchestra of Wolves]]'' album. In the evening, they then went on to Camden's [[Electric Ballroom]] venue, and played ''[[Grey Britain]]'' in its entirety, with four members of The [[Heritage Orchestra]]. Both shows were recorded for a live DVD.

===Lineup change, ''Death Is Birth'' and self-titled third album (2011–2014)===
[[File:Gallows 2011-11-06 13.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=|[[Wade MacNeil]], of [[Alexisonfire]], replaced Frank Carter as Gallows' lead singer in 2011.]]
Frank Carter left Gallows in July 2011, issuing a statement that the band "have hit a crossroads in our writing process and unfortunately myself and the rest of the boys have different ideas regarding the sound of Gallows going forward. Gallows have decided they are going to continue on without me and I wish the boys the best of luck for the future."<ref name="NME-frank quits">{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/gallows/57879/photo/50 |title=Frank Carter to quit Gallows |website=[[NME]] |date=9 July 2011 |access-date=18 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925032327/http://www.nme.com/news/gallows/57879/photo/50 |archive-date=25 September 2012}}</ref>

Frank's brother and bandmate Steph remarked: "As you all know, we've been in the studio for the past few months working on a follow up to ''Grey Britain''. It pains me to say that as of 1 August Frank will no longer be a member of Gallows. Creatively, we could not agree on a direction for the new record and came to the conclusion that parting ways was for the best. Frank will be releasing music with his new project [[Pure Love (band)|Pure Love]] later this year and we all wish him best. He is and will always be our brother, as well as an integral part of the start of our career."<ref name="NME-frank quits"/> The band made their last festival appearance with Frank at the Sonisphere festival, and he played his final show with Gallows at London ULU on 23 July 2011.<ref name="Hammer-frank quits">{{cite web | url = http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/frank-carter-announces-departure-from-gallows/ | title = Frank Carter Announces Departure From Gallows | author = James Gill | publisher = [[Metal Hammer]] | date = 11 July 2011 | access-date = 18 June 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120912010312/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/frank-carter-announces-departure-from-gallows/ | archive-date = 12 September 2012}}</ref>

Frank Carter eventually formed another project under the name Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes, returning to his hardcore punk roots.

Former [[Alexisonfire]] guitarist/vocalist [[Wade MacNeil]] replaced Carter as Gallows' singer in August 2011, shortly after Alexisonfire announced their disbandment.<ref name="Wade new 2011 Interview">{{cite web|url =http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/alexisonfire_wade_macneil_gallows_new_singer|title= Exclusive Interview: Wade MacNeil on becoming Gallows' new singer|author=Annie Zaleski|publisher= Alternative Press|date=9 August 2011|access-date= 7 December 2011}}</ref> The band's first recording with MacNeil, the 40-second "True Colours", was released as a free digital download.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://exclaim.ca/MusicVideo/ClickHear/gallows-true_colours|title=Gallows "True Colours"|author=Brock Thiessen|publisher=Exclaim.ca|date=30 August 2011|access-date= 7 December 2011}}</ref> The 4-song ''Death Is Birth'' EP, recorded in Los Angeles with [[The Bronx (band)|The Bronx]] guitarist Joby Ford as producer, was released that December through Thirty Days of Night Records.

===''Desolation Sounds'' (2014–2015)===
In the summer of 2014 the band completed their fourth album, titled ''[[Desolation Sounds]]'', with the release originally planned for November.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=wade_macneil|author=Wade MacNeil|number=499293183558574080|date=12 August 2014|title=The new Gallows record is called Desolation Sounds.

The album's first single 'Bonfire Season' was debuted on the Radio 1 Rock Show with Daniel P Carter on 11 January, with a release date of 9 February being given for the EP, which will also feature a remix and two bonus cover tracks.

===Hiatus, other projects and return (2015–present)===

Gallows played their final show in support of ''Desolation Sounds'' on 31 May 2015 at the Rockavaria festival. Following the end of the tour, McNeil reunited with Alexisonfire for a run of live shows, while Barnard joined the band Krokodil and formed a new band, Gold Key. Barratt also founded a new band, Funeral Shakes.

On 16 October 2018 the band's Twitter account posted an 11-second video featuring their logo and dissonant noise.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gallows on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/gallowsofficial/status/1052157599414669312 |website=Twitter}}</ref> A week later, the band were announced as one of the first eight bands to be part of the 2019 [[Slam Dunk Festival]] line-up.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Krol |first1=Charlotte |title=Bullet For My Valentine, Glassjaw, Turnstile and more added to Slam Dunk Festival 2019 line-up |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/bullet-for-my-valentine-glassjaw-turnstile-slam-dunk-festival-2019-lineup-2404464 |website=NME |access-date=21 November 2018}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Gallows' music is generally categorised as [[hardcore punk]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Myers |first1=Ben |title=Gallows' great rock'n'roll swindle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jan/06/gallows-great-rock-n-roll-swindle |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=9 January 2020}}</ref> The sound of Grey Britain often bordered [[metalcore]],<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|title=Gallows – ''Great Britain''|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/grey-britain-mw0000816240|last=Lymangrover|first=Jason|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=22 May 2015|quote=...[Gallows] rethought their plans ... [for] Grey Britain, and ultimately came to a decision to revamp their sound with a [[heavy metal music|metal]] edge. There's the same screaming angst and relentless speed that was celebrated in [[Orchestra of Wolves|their first outing]], but now Carter's shrieks are backed by double kick drums and explosive speed metal guitar riffs that have more in common with [[Slayer]] and early [[Metallica]] than [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] or [[the Exploited]]. Shifting into metalcore territory is a tricky decision, since a lot of their initial appeal was due to the fact that they were making their own personal stamp on revitalizing [[punk rock|punk]] — a genre that's becoming increasingly saturated with commercialism.}}</ref> while Desolation Sounds included elements of [[post-punk]] and [[gothic rock]].<ref name="GEN">{{cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2015/04/07/track-by-track-gallows-desolation-sounds|title=Track By Track: Gallows - Desolation Sounds|website=DIY}}</ref>
