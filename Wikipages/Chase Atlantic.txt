== Music style ==
Chase Atlantic has a unique style of music, which, according to the band, is "conjured up dark alternative pop punctuated by rock and R&B." Throughout their four years of producing music, their music style has changed from an alternative/pop sound to a more alternative/R&B sound, which the band resonates with more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chaseatlantic.com/bio|title=Chase Atlantic Once Upon A Time...|website=Chase Atlantic Official Website|access-date=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409180426/http://www.chaseatlantic.com/bio|archive-date=9 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> They are a combination of R&B, rock, pop, and alternative and are influenced by many artists from those genres, including [[Tame Impala]] and [[The Weeknd]].<ref>{{Citation|last=514 Online Radio|title=514 Online Radio â€“ Chase Atlantic Interview|date=18 September 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbdlmBS1tr0|access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref>
