==History==
Devaney and Sue-Poi were both members of [[The Static Jacks]], but the band became inactive after the release of their [[In Blue (The Static Jacks album)|second album]].<ref name="Stereogum">{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1977719/band-to-watch-nation-of-language/franchises/interview/band-to-watch/ |title=Band To Watch: Nation Of Language |website=stereogum.com |date=2018-01-10 |accessdate=2020-09-05}}</ref> Devaney was inspired to start a new project after hearing "[[Electricity (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Electricity]]" by [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] in his father's car, a track he listened to in his childhood.<ref name="Stereogum" /> What started out as Devaney "fooling around" on a [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] later evolved into Nation of Language, with the addition of Devaney's partner Noell and former Static Jacks bandmate Sue-Poi.

The band released a number of singles from 2016 through to 2019, before releasing their debut album ''Introduction, Presence'' in May, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationoflanguage.bandcamp.com/album/introduction-presence |title=Introduction, Presence by Nation of Language on Bandcamp |website=bandcamp.com |date=2020-05-22 |accessdate=2020-09-05}}</ref>

Since 2018, Devaney has also been the lead vocalist for Machinegum, a side project created by [[The Strokes]]' drummer, [[Fabrizio Moretti]].
