While the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] has often served as China's [[national symbol]], internationally the giant panda has often filled this role. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example, appearing since 1982 on [[Chinese Gold Panda|gold panda bullion]] coins and as one of the five [[Fuwa]] mascots of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]].

===Etymology===
The word ''panda'' was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word ''panda'' has been found.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. ''panda'' n. 1.</ref> The closest candidate is the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word ''ponya,'' possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda.
[[File:Baby Pandas.JPG|thumb|Panda cubs]]
In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" refers to the lesser-known [[red panda]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.animalinfo.org/species/carnivor/ailufulg.htm|title=Animal Info – Red Panda}}</ref> thus necessitating the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser/red" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013, the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' still used "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441032/giant-panda |title=giant panda (mammal) – Encyclopedia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515123427/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441032/giant-panda |archive-date=15 May 2013 |access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref> and simply "panda" for the [[red panda]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441037/panda |title=panda (mammal, Ailurus species) – Encyclopedia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515120439/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441037/panda |archive-date=15 May 2013 |access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref> despite the popular usage of the word "panda" to refer to giant pandas.

Since the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear 20 different names, such as ''huāxióng'' ({{lang|zh|花熊}} "spotted bear") and ''zhúxióng'' ({{lang|zh|竹熊}} "bamboo bear").<ref name="huayuqiao.org">{{cite web|url=http://huayuqiao.org/articles/yaodehuai/yaodh08.htm|title= Discussion about the Chinese name for giant panda (in Chinese)}}</ref> The most popular names in China today are ''dàxióngmāo'' ({{lang|zh|大熊貓}} literally "giant bear cat"), or simply ''xióngmāo'' ({{lang|zh|熊貓}} "bear cat"). The name ''xióngmāo'' ({{lang|zh|熊貓}} "bear cat") was originally used to describe the [[red panda]] (''Ailurus fulgens''), but since the giant panda was thought to be closely related to the red panda, ''dàxióngmāo'' ({{lang|zh|大熊貓}}) was named relatively.<ref name="huayuqiao.org"/>

In [[Taiwan]], another popular name for panda is the inverted ''dàmāoxióng'' ({{lang|zh|大貓熊}} "giant cat bear"), though many encyclopediae and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the "bear cat" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, "bear" instead of "cat" is the base noun, making this name more grammatically and logically correct, which may have led to the popular choice despite official writings.<ref name="huayuqiao.org"/> This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in [[Tainan]] painted a [[sun bear]] black and white and created the [[Tainan fake panda incident]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Government Information Office will now use ''dàxióngmāo'' as the proper name (in Chinese)|url=http://udndata.com/ndapp/Story2007?no=31&page=4&udndbid=udndata&SearchString=v9%2B6tSu6tb%2FfK6TptME%2BPTE5NTEwMTAxK6TptME8PTIwMDAwMTAx&sharepage=10&select=0&kind=2&article_date=1990-08-09&news_id=100993201&showUserSearch=+%3Cstrong%3E%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%B1%7A%A5%48%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23FF6600+class%3Dtitle04%3E%BF%DF%BA%B5%2B%BA%B5%BF%DF%2B%A4%E9%B4%C1%3E%3D19510101%2B%A4%E9%B4%C1%3C%3D20000101%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%A6%40%B7%6A%B4%4D%A8%EC%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23FF6600+class%3Dtitle04%3E68%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%B5%A7%B8%EA%AE%C6%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fstrong%3E&firstFatherCateID=&collectCateNewsPage=1|date=9 August 1990|newspaper=聯合報}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title="bear cat" or "cat bear" (in Chinese)|url=http://udndata.com/ndapp/Story2007?no=307&page=31&udndbid=udndata&SearchString=tsKl1bq1L7q1v98vv9%2B6tSuk6bTBPj0xOTg3MTIwMSuk6bTBPD0xOTg4MTIzMQ%3D%3D&sharepage=10&select=1&kind=2&article_date=1987-12-29&news_id=103310434&showUserSearch=+%3Cstrong%3E%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%B1%7A%A5%48%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23FF6600+class%3Dtitle04%3E%B6%C2%A5%D5%BA%B5%2F%BA%B5%BF%DF%2F%BF%DF%BA%B5%2B%A4%E9%B4%C1%3E%3D19871201%2B%A4%E9%B4%C1%3C%3D19881231%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%A6%40%B7%6A%B4%4D%A8%EC%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23FF6600+class%3Dtitle04%3E317%3C%2Ffont%3E+%3Cfont+color%3D%23333333+class%3Dtitle03%3E%B5%A7%B8%EA%AE%C6%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fstrong%3E&firstFatherCateID=&collectCateNewsPage=1|date=29 December 1987|newspaper=聯合報}}</ref>

The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold colouring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat,<ref name="Dudley 9">

The average giant panda eats as much as 9 to 14&nbsp;kg (20 to 30&nbsp;lb) of bamboo shoots a day to compensate for the limited energy content of its diet. Ingestion of such a large quantity of material is possible and necessary because of the rapid passage of large amounts of indigestible plant material through the short, straight digestive tract.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|last1=Dierenfeld|first1=E.

Two of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are [[adaptation]]s to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist [[Russell Ciochon]] observed: "[much] like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo."<ref name = Johnson/> Similarly, the giant panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw.<ref name = Johnson/> Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.

The morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2–2.4 mya with the emergence of ''[[Ailuropoda microta|A. microta]]''.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=C|last2=Ciochon|first2=R.

Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.<ref>{{harvnb|Lumpkin|Seidensticker|2007|pp=63–64}} (page numbers as per the 2002 edition)</ref>

Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six pandas tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their foraging and mating habits and analyzed samples of their food and feces. The pandas would move from the valleys into the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. During the summer months, [[bamboo shoot]]s rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the pandas. During breeding season, the pandas would return to lower altitudes to eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pandas roam to find better bamboo|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/07/pandas-roam-to-find-better-bamboo|access-date=17 November 2014|website=Australian Geographic|date=25 July 2014}}</ref>

Pandas communicate through vocalisation and scent marking such as clawing trees or [[spraying (animal behavior)|spraying urine]].<ref name=wwf1/> They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens.

In the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures – the [[Empress Dowager Bo]] was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in [[history of China|Ancient China]], pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control [[menstruation]] as described in the [[Qin dynasty]] encyclopedia ''[[Erya]]''.<ref name="Schaller 1993 61">{{harvnb|Schaller|1993|p=61}}</ref>

During the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]] (early 15th century), his relative from [[Kaifeng]] sent him a captured ''[[zouyu]]'' ([[:zh:騶虞|騶虞]]), and another ''zouyu'' was sighted in [[Shandong]]. ''Zouyu'' is a legendary "righteous" animal, which, similarly to a ''[[qilin]]'', only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch. It is said to be fierce as a tiger, but gentle and strictly vegetarian, and described in some books as a [[white tiger]] with black spots.

===Diplomacy===
{{main|Panda diplomacy}}
Gifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1970s, as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges between China and the West. This practice has been termed "panda diplomacy".<ref name="buckingham">{{Cite journal|last1=Buckingham|first1=Kathleen Carmel|last2=David|first2=Jonathan Neil William|last3=Jepson|first3=Paul|date=September 2013|title=Environmental Reviews and Case Studies: Diplomats and Refugees: Panda Diplomacy, Soft "Cuddly" Power, and the New Trajectory in Panda Conservation|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-practice/article/environmental-reviews-and-case-studies-diplomats-and-refugees-panda-diplomacy-soft-cuddly-power-and-the-new-trajectory-in-panda-conservation/A23238335C47C1717417060B7AAB05AF|journal=Environmental Practice|volume=15|issue=3|pages=262–270|doi=10.1017/S1466046613000185|s2cid=154378167|issn=1466-0466}}</ref>

By 1984, however, pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, China began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans, under terms including a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of China. Since 1998, because of a [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] [[lawsuit]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] only allows a US [[zoo]] to import a panda if the zoo can ensure that China will channel more than half of its loan fee into [[conservation movement|conservation]] efforts for the giant panda and its habitat.

In May 2005, China offered a breeding pair to [[Taiwan]]. The issue became embroiled in [[cross-Strait relations]] – both over the underlying symbolism, and over technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered "domestic" or "international", or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/45901/ China's Panda Politics].

However, when [[Ma Ying-jeou]] assumed the presidency in 2008, the offer was accepted, and the pandas arrived in December of that year.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/23/china-taiwan-pandas China sends panda peace offering].

The giant panda has been a target of poaching by locals since ancient times and by foreigners since it was introduced to the West. Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the [[Chinese economic reform]], demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the [[underground economy|black market]], acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.

In 1963, the PRC government set up [[Wolong National Nature Reserve]] to save the declining panda population.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinawolong.com/doce/about.htm|title=About Wolong |publisher=Wolong National Natural Reserve|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201172138/https://www.chinawolong.com/doce/about.htm|archive-date=1 December 2006 |date=7 May 2005}}</ref> {{cns|However, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made at the time, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. Because of the destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a [[rare species]].|date=March 2020}}

In 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes [[DNA]] from panda [[Feces|droppings]], scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000.<ref name="Britannica Earth"/> In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998.<ref name="BBC_06-07" /> As the species has been reclassified to "vulnerable" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the [[State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China|State Forestry Administration of China]] announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.<ref>[http://www.forestry.gov.cn/main/195/content-902929.html The Panda is still endangered species, and the conservation efforts still need to be reinforced] ''State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China'' (in Chinese)</ref>

The giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] designation. The [[Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries]], located in the southwest province of [[Sichuan]] and covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006.<ref name="BBCheritage">{{cite news |title=Pandas gain world heritage status |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5174854.stm |access-date=17 January 2020 |publisher=BBC |date=12 July 2006}}</ref><ref name="WWFheritage">{{cite news |last1=Benn |first1=Joanna |title=Panda sanctuary in China added to World Heritage list |url=https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?76460/Panda-sanctuary-in-China-added-to-World-Heritage-list |access-date=17 January 2020 |publisher=WWF |date=13 July 2006}}</ref><ref name="unescowhc">{{cite web |title=Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries – Wolong, Mt Siguniang and Jiajin Mountains |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1213/ |publisher=Unesco WHC |access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref>

Not all conservationists agree that the money spent on conserving pandas is well spent. [[Chris Packham]] has argued that the breeding of pandas in captivity is "pointless" because "there is not enough habitat left to sustain them".<ref name="Packham">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090927152847/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/6216775/Chris-Packham-Giant-pandas-should-be-allowed-to-die-out.html Chris Packham: 'Giant pandas should be allowed to die out'].

He also quoted, "The panda is possibly one of the grossest wastes of conservation money in the last half century",<ref name="Packham2">[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22730796-30417,00.html Beyond cute and cuddly] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116040347/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22730796-30417,00.html |date=16 January 2009 }}.

In 2012, [[Earthwatch Institute]], a global nonprofit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called "On the Trail of Giant Panda". This program, based in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, allows volunteers to work up close with pandas cared for in captivity, and help them adapt to life in the wild, so that they may breed, and live longer and healthier lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthwatch.org/exped/zhang.html |title=Earthwatch: On the Trail of Giant Panda |access-date=24 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301032825/http://www.earthwatch.org/exped/zhang.html |archive-date=1 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Efforts to preserve the panda bear populations in China have come at the expense of other animals in the region, including snow leopards, wolves, and dholes.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Jessie Yeung|title=China's focus on panda conservation has come at the cost of other species: study|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/04/asia/china-panda-conservation-study-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html|access-date=16 August 2020|website=CNN}}</ref>

In order to improve living and mating conditions for the fragmented populations of pandas, nearly 70 natural reserves have been combined to form the [[Giant Panda National Park]] in 2020. With a size of 10,500 square miles, the park is roughly three times as large as [[Yellowstone National Park]] and incorporates the [[Wolong National Nature Reserve]]. The state-owned [[Bank of China]] helped to enable the project with US$1.5 billion.
One major aim is to permanently keep the panda population stable enough to avoid a relapse to its former [[IUCN Red List]] "endangered" status. Especially small, isolated populations run the risk of inbreeding and smaller genetic variety makes the individuals more vulnerable to various defects and genetic [[mutation]]. Allowing a larger group of individuals to roam through a larger area freely and choose from a greater variety of mates, helps to enrich genetic diversity of their offspring.<ref>{{Cite web|title=China's National Panda Park Will Be Three Times the Size of Yellowstone|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/chinas-national-panda-park-will-be-three-times-size-yellowstone-180972158/|access-date=2021-03-31}}</ref>

In 2020, the panda population of the new national park was already above 1,800 individuals, which is roughly 80 percent of the entire panda population in China. Establishing the new protected area in the [[Sichuan|Sichuan Province]] also gives various other endangered or threatened species, like the [[Siberian tiger]], the possibility to improve their living conditions by offering them a habitat.<ref>{{Cite web|title=China forges ahead with ambitious national park plan|website=[[National Geographic Society]]|date=27 August 2020|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/china-new-national-park-system|access-date=2021-03-31}}</ref> Other species who benefit from the protection of their habitat include the [[snow leopard]], the [[golden snub-nosed monkey]], the [[red panda]] and the [[complex-toothed flying squirrel]].

In July 2021, Chinese conservation authorities announced that giant pandas are no longer endangered in the wild following years of conservation efforts, with a population in the wild exceeding 1,800.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Giant pandas no longer endangered in the wild, China announces|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=9 July 2021|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/09/giant-pandas-no-longer-endangered-in-the-wild-china-announces|access-date=2021-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Conservation efforts have saved China's giant pandas from the endangered species list|website=[[CBS News]]|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/giant-pandas-off-endangered-species-list-china/|access-date=2021-07-11}}</ref>

===Zoos===
{{Main|Giant pandas around the world|List of giant pandas}}
{{category see also|Individual giant pandas}}

Pandas have been kept in zoos as early as the [[Western Han Dynasty]] in China, where the writer [[Sima Xiangru]] noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital [[Chang'an]] (present [[Xi'an]]). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos.<ref>Schaller pg.62.</ref>

[[Chi Chi (giant panda)|Chi Chi]] at the [[London Zoo]] became very popular. This influenced the [[World Wildlife Fund]] to use a panda as its symbol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/finder/giantpanda/panda.html |title=Giant Panda: Overview |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |access-date=26 October 2011}}</ref>

A 2006 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article<ref name=nytimesgoodman>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/national/12panda.html|title=Eats Shoots, Leaves and Much of Zoos' Budgets|last=Goodman|first=Brenda|date=12 February 2006|access-date=9 August 2010|location=Atlanta|work=The New York Times}}</ref> outlined the economics of keeping pandas, which costs five times more than keeping the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1&nbsp;million a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20081213-9999-1n13panda.html|title=Zoo negotiates lower price to rent bears from China|publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com|date=13 December 2008}}</ref> The last contract, with the [[Memphis Zoo]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], ended in 2013.<ref name=nytimesgoodman />
