==Career==
Initially working as [[personal assistant]]s for [[Andrew E.]], the group's name originated from when Andrew E. asked the members to come up with a name. Charlie Mak, who is of Bicolano descent, explained in an interview that the term "salbakuta" is [[Bicolano language|Bicolano]] for "naughty" or "mischievous".<ref name=":1" />

The group rose to prominence in 2002 with their single "S2pid Luv", which Andrew E. penned as they were looking for a radio-friendly single for their debut album ''Ayoko ng Ganitong Life'' ("''I Hate This Kind of Life''").<ref name="ripoff">{{Cite news |date=2018-07-04 |title=WATCH: Is Andrew E's 90s hit 'Humanap Ka Ng Panget' a rip-off of another hip hop song? |language=en |url=https://pop.inquirer.net/54327/watch-is-andrew-es-90s-hit-humanap-ka-ng-panget-a-rip-off-of-another-hip-hop-song-hip-hop-group |access-date=2020-11-06}}</ref> Despite some controversy over the group's use of explicit lyrics (the album cover already bearing a [[Warning label|parental disclaimer]] similar to the [[Parental Advisory]] label used on Western albums) and the Barbra Streisand-derived [[Hook (music)|hook]],<ref name="gil">{{cite news |last1=Gil |first1=Baby A. |title=In defense of Salbakuta's S2PID LUV |url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2002/05/01/159240/defense-salbakuta146s-s2pid-luv |accessdate=16 June 2020 |work=philstar.com}}</ref> "S2pid Luv" proved to be a breakthrough single for the group,<ref name="icansee">{{cite web |title='I Can See Your Voice': Fil-Italian singer performs 'Stupid Love' with Salbakuta |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/02/18/18/i-can-see-your-voice-fil-italian-singer-performs-stupid-love-with-salbakuta |website=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=16 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref> also spawning a feature-length [[romantic comedy]] film adaptation starring Andrew E. and [[Blakdyak]].<ref name="film">{{cite web |title=S2pid Luv (2002) - Movie |url=https://www.moviefone.com/movie/s2pid-luv/20058443/main/ |website=www.moviefone.com |accessdate=16 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref> An alternate version of "S2pid Luv" with an original hook in Tagalog instead of the "Evergreen" sample was later released.
