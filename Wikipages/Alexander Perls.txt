== Early life and education ==
Though born in [[Gas, Kansas|Gas]], Kansas, he grew up in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], culminating in an education at [[Concord Academy]]. While studying at [[University College London]] in 1997, Perls worked with the post-rock collective [[Piano Magic]].<ref name="piano_magic">{{Cite web|url=http://www.piano-magic.co.uk/timeline1.htm|title=Timeline|website=[[Piano Magic]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615163220/http://www.piano-magic.co.uk/timeline1.htm|archive-date=2011-06-15|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all|access-date=2011-06-11}}</ref>

Following Perls' graduation from [[Oberlin College]] in 1998, he began working for the [[Barbara Gladstone]] Gallery,<ref name="artnet">{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/people/lang/lang7-6-17.asp|title=Hot City: Out at openings in SoHo and Chelsea|website=[[Artnet]]|date=1999-07-06|df=mdy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330034506/http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/people/lang/lang7-6-17.asp|archive-date=March 30, 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=2011-06-11|quote=Barbara Gladstone gang Ludovica Busiri Vici, Alexander Perls and Tom Gleeson at "Plain Air" opening, June 30 & July 1, 1999}}</ref> a leading contemporary art dealership in New York. The following year he co-founded NATOarts, which (according to its charter) sought to "promote global security and stability through the exhibition of works of conceptual art." The government support for the organization was terminated in the early days of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]], ultimately leading to a decision to focus on a career as a songwriter.<ref name="gothamist">{{Cite web|url=https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/alexander-perls-songwriter-and-vocal-producer|title=Alexander Perls, Songwriter and Vocal Producer|last=Robbins|first=Sarah|website=[[Gothamist]]|date=2004-08-02|df=mdy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116180714/https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/alexander-perls-songwriter-and-vocal-producer|archive-date=2019-11-16|url-status=dead|access-date=2011-06-06}}</ref>

=== YouTube ===
As a consequence of [[YouTube]] introducing a system called AudioSwap on February 22, 2007, which replaces the audio of copyrighted soundtracks with a different, [[Creative Commons licence|Creative Commons licensed]] song, a number of songs from 009 Sound System, particularly "Dreamscape", "With a Spirit", "Space and Time", "Born To Be Wasted", "Holy Ghost", and "Trinity", became widely prominent on many YouTube videos. Because the artists were alphabetically sorted, 009 Sound System songs were placed at the top of the AudioSwap list, leading them to be chosen by a majority of users.<ref name="audioswap">{{Cite web|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/youtubes-audioswap-lets-you-change-your-videos-soundtrack/|title=Change Background Music in YouTube Videos with AudioSwap|website=MakeUseOf.com|df=mdy-all|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref>
