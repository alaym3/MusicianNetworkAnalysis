== Personal life ==
A primary source of inspiration for Jernigan's message and music is an experience he describes as his deliverance from homosexuality. Jernigan states that this began during a [[2nd Chapter of Acts]] concert in [[Norman, Oklahoma]].<ref>[http://www.precious-testimonies.com/TestimonyCategories/SameSexEmotions/D_MJernigan.htm Jernigan's testimony: A Broken Heart] c/o precious-testimonies.com</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.okbu.edu/news/2011/07/profile-in-excellence-alum-dennis-jernigan-lives-a-redeemed-life.html|title=Profile in Excellence: Alum Dennis Jernigan Lives a Redeemed Life|website=[[Oklahoma Baptist University]]|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Jernigan believes his prior identification as homosexual was related to an erroneous childhood perception that he had been rejected by his father.  

Following the experience at the concert, Jernigan developed a ministry based on his personal experience, which he shares at churches and other locations around the world. In a concert at Wynne Baptist Church, Jernigan stated that he does not wish to be labeled as "ex-gay", but instead as "reborn" or as "[God's] new creation."{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}
