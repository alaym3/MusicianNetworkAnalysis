'''Eric Howard Carmen''' (born August 11, 1949)<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=418}}</ref> is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and keyboardist. He had numerous hit songs in the 1970s and 1980s, first as a member of the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] (who had a million-selling single with "[[Go All the Way (song)|Go All the Way]]"),<ref name=BB1>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/eric-carmen/chart-history |title=Hot 100 |publisher=Billboard |access-date=March 17, 2020 }}</ref> and then with his solo career, including hits such as "[[All by Myself]]", "[[Never Gonna Fall in Love Again]]", "[[She Did It]]", "[[Hungry Eyes]]", and "[[Make Me Lose Control (song)|Make Me Lose Control]]".<ref Name=BB3/>

==Early life==
From a family of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jewish]] immigrants,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-105267163.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105181136/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-105267163.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 5, 2012 |title='All by Himself' among musicians; Jewish Clevelander Eric Carmen reflects on his life as a rock star – Cleveland Jewish News |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=December 31, 2004 |access-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref> Carmen was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], United States,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and grew up in [[Lyndhurst, Ohio]]. He has been involved with music since early childhood. By the age of two, he was entertaining his parents with impressions of [[Jimmy Durante]] and [[Johnnie Ray]]. By age three, he was in the [[Eurhythmics|Dalcroze Eurhythmics]] program at the [[Cleveland Institute of Music]]. At six years old, he took violin lessons from his aunt Muriel Carmen, who was a violinist in the [[Cleveland Orchestra]]. By age 11, he was playing piano and dreaming about writing his own songs. The arrival of [[the Beatles]] and the [[Rolling Stones]] altered his dream slightly. By the time he was a sophomore at [[Charles F. Brush High School]], Carmen was playing piano and singing in rock 'n' roll bands including the Fugitives, the Harlequins, the Sounds of Silence, and the Cyrus Erie.

Though classically trained in piano, Carmen became a self-taught guitarist. At 15, he started guitar lessons, but when his teacher's approach did not fit with what he wanted, he decided to teach himself. He bought a Beatles chord book and studied guitar for the next four months.

==Tenure with Raspberries==
Carmen became serious about being a musician while attending [[John Carroll University]]. He joined a band named Cyrus Erie, which recorded several unsuccessful singles for Epic Records.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eric-carmen-mn0000186805/biography|title=Eric Carmen Biography|publisher=allmusic|access-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref> Cyrus Erie guitarist [[Wally Bryson]] had been playing with friends [[Jim Bonfanti]] and [[Dave Smalley (Cleveland)|Dave Smalley]] in one of Cleveland's most popular bands, [[the Choir (garage rock)|the Choir]], which scored a minor national hit in 1967 with the single "It's Cold Outside".

When Cyrus Erie and the Choir collapsed at the end of the 1960s, Carmen, Bryson, Bonfanti, and Smalley teamed up to form [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]], a [[rock and roll]] band who were among the chief exponents of the early 1970s [[power pop]] style.<ref name="allmusic"/> Carmen was the lead singer of the group, and wrote or co-wrote all their hit songs.<ref name="allmusic Raspberries">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-raspberries-mn0000416245/biography|title=The Raspberries Biography|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|publisher=allmusic|access-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref>  In 1975, after the breakup of Raspberries, he started his solo career, de-emphasizing harder rock elements in favor of [[soft rock]] and power ballads.<ref name="allmusic"/>

In 2004, Carmen, along with original Raspberries members Jim Bonfanti, Wally Bryson, and Dave Smalley, re-formed the band for a series of sold-out live performances in cities across the United States.  On that tour, the Raspberries recorded a live album of their hits at The House of Blues on Sunset Strip, in Hollywood. Both the show and album received critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eustacio Humphrey |url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2007/12/resurgent_raspberries_on_a_rol.html |title=Raspberries show and album review – Cleveland, OH 12/12/2007 |publisher=Cleveland.com |date=December 12, 2007 |access-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref> Carmen himself has stated that he planned to write new harder-edged songs for the band to perform in the same vein as those that the Raspberries performed in the 1970s.

==Solo career==
Carmen's first two solo singles were chart hits in 1976. Both were built around themes by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]. The first of these singles, "[[All by Myself]]" – based on Rachmaninoff's [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]] – hit number 2 in the United States, and number 12 in the United Kingdom where it was his only charting hit. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in April 1976.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/355 355]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/355}}</ref> The follow-up single, "[[Never Gonna Fall in Love Again]]"<ref name="LarkinGE"/> – based on the main theme of the slow movement of Rachmaninoff's [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 2]] – reached number 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and hit number one on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|US Adult Contemporary Chart]], as well as number nine on the [[Cash Box]] chart. In the UK, [[Dana Rosemary Scallon|Dana]] took it to number 31 and in Australia [[Mark Holden]] took it to number 13. Those songs featured on his 1975 [[Eric Carmen (1975 album)|self-titled debut album]], along with "[[That's Rock and Roll]]", a number 3 hit single for singer [[Shaun Cassidy]]. The album made number 21 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' album chart]] and was certified Gold in 1977 for sales of more than 500,000 copies.

Carmen's second album, ''[[Boats Against the Current (album)|Boats Against the Current]]'', came out in the summer of 1977 and received mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marsh |first1=Dave |title=Boats Against the Current |url=https://www.superseventies.com/spcarmeneric.html |website=Super Seventies |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Weiner |first1=Matthew |title=Adrift in the Seventies |url=http://www.savetherobot.com/articles/ericCarmen.html |website=Save the Robot |publisher=Save the Robot |access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ofjord |first1=Michael |title=Boats Against the Current |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/boats-against-the-current-mw0000463613 |website=AllMusic |publisher=RhythmOne Group |access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> It featured backup players such as [[Burton Cummings]], [[Andrew Gold]], [[Bruce Johnston]] and [[Nigel Olsson]].  The album spent 13 weeks in the Billboard Album chart, peaking number 45. It also produced the Top 20 single "[[She Did It]]", but the title track only managed to scrape the bottom of the chart. The title track was later covered by [[Olivia Newton-John]] on her album ''[[Totally Hot]]''. A third single taken from the album, "Marathon Man", became his first solo single not to hit the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.  However, [[Shaun Cassidy]] again made the Top 10 in 1978 with Carmen's "[[Hey Deanie]]".  For several weeks in the fall of 1977, Carmen had three compositions charting concurrently on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], Cassidy's two big hits and Carmen's own "[[She Did It]]".

Carmen followed up with two more albums. Despite declining chart fortunes, the single "Change of Heart" broke into the Pop Top 20,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and reached number 6 at AC in late 1978, with this hit also being covered by [[Samantha Sang]] on her ''[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]'' LP, but in 1980, after the release of the album "Tonight You're Mine" and single "It Hurts Too Much" (number 75 Billboard Top 100; number 3 South Africa, June 1980) he temporarily withdrew from the music industry.

Four years later, after [[Mike Reno]] and [[Ann Wilson]] topped the charts (Pop number 7; Adult Contemporary number one) with the Carmen-penned ballad "[[Almost Paradise]]" (the love theme to the film ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''), Carmen resurfaced on [[Geffen Records]] in 1985 with a second self-titled album and a sizeable comeback hit "[[I Wanna Hear It from Your Lips]]".<ref name="allmusic"/>  The single hit the Adult Contemporary Top 10 as well as the Pop Top 40.  The follow-up single, "I'm Through with Love", also climbed the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and reached the Top 20 of the Adult Contemporary chart. Another track from the album, "Maybe My Baby", later became a Country hit for [[Louise Mandrell]]. "[[I Wanna Hear It from Your Lips]]" was also a country hit for Louise Mandrell.

In 1987, Carmen's contribution to the hit movie ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', "[[Hungry Eyes]]", hit number 2 on the Adult Contemporary Chart and also returned him to the Pop Top 10.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> "Reason To Try", a further contribution to the ''[[1988 Summer Olympics Album: One Moment in Time|One Moment in Time]]'' compilation album of songs recorded for the Seoul Summer Olympics, kept Carmen's profile high in 1988, during which the nostalgic "[[Make Me Lose Control (song)|Make Me Lose Control]]" also returned him to the number one position on the Adult Contemporary chart – where it stayed for three straight weeks – as well as number 3 on Billboard's Hot 100.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> This became his highest-charting song since "All By Myself". Both, along with "Hungry Eyes", having in the past two decades become classic pop radio favorites.

The year 2000 saw the stateside release of ''[[I Was Born to Love You (album)|I Was Born to Love You]]'', which had been released in 1998 only in Japan as ''Winter Dreams''.<ref name="allmusic"/> Carmen eschewed the use of a band on the recording, playing most of the instruments and programming the drum parts himself. The album did not find a large audience, but Carmen has continued to enjoy success placing songs with other artists over the years. In 2000 he also toured for the first time in years with Ringo Starr and His All Starr Band performing "Hungry Eyes", "Go All The Way" and "All By Myself".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ericcarmen.com/eric-interview-03.html|title=Eric Carmen - Interview|website=www.ericcarmen.com|access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref>

On December 24, 2013, the first new recording in over 15 years by Carmen titled "Brand New Year" was released. The track, written and recorded in November/December 2013 in Ohio and Los Angeles, was issued via a gratis download by Legacy Recordings as a special "Christmas gift", to herald the March 2014 arrival of a 30 track career retrospective entitled ''The Essential Eric Carmen.''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/features/leisure/entertainment/article_5d11e602-a947-11e3-8750-0019bb2963f4.html |title='Brand New Year' for songwriting legend |publisher=Cleveland Jewish News |date=March 13, 2014 |access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref>

On June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Eric Carmen among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190628121143/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html|archive-date=June 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Carmen has not toured since 2009, but continues to write and license music, such as "Brand New Year" released in 2013.
