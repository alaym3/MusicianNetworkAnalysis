=== The Palm Woods ===
The Palm Woods Hotel is the fictional hotel where the Big Time Rush boys, Mrs. Knight and Katie Knight live in Hollywood. It is the main setting for the series and plenty of the scenes take place in the Palm Woods lobby, park or pool as well as in the apartments and even the air ducts. It is commonly described as the home for the future famous since its residents are mostly aspiring actors/actresses, singers, models or performers such as Camille, Jo, the Jennifers, Lucy, Guitar Dude, Tyler and many others. It is run by the strict manager Mr. Bitters while Buddha Bob works as the janitor.

=== Rocque Records ===
Rocque Records is the fictional record label owned by RCMCBT Global Net Sanyoid Corporation, Big Time Rush's label and the workplace of Gustavo Rocque and his assistant Kelly. It is supplied with songwriting and recording equipment and either Gustavo or the boys are seen producing there. It is the second most used setting of Big Time Rush stories. Names who worked with Rocque Records include [[Jordin Sparks]]. Its rival company is named Hawk Records. Rocque Records places include Gustavo's office, the bathroom and the recording studios (A and B). It is hinted that the record label is a parody of [[Interscope Records]] and [[Jive Records]].

=== Apartment 2J ===
The apartment 2J is the Big Time Rush's apartment in the Palm Woods Hotel. It got its current form in [[List of Big Time Rush episodes|Big Time Crib]] as it used to be simplistic, dirty and messy before. It features a swirly slide and latest home electronics and arcade games. It is claimed that [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Shia LaBeouf]] and [[Kanye West]], all stayed in the apartment in the past. Its interior altered once more when James left Big Time Rush in [[Big Time Concert]] and moved into 2J, but it came back to normal soon. Other known apartments in the Palm Woods are the ones of Camille (4J), Jo (3I) and Lucy (2B).

=== Opening sequence ===
Each episode begins with a [[cold open]], leading into the theme song. The opening theme is "[[Big Time Rush (Big Time Rush song)|Big Time Rush]]," and is presented as shots of characters mixed in with animated booklet pictures, scenes from various episodes, and graphic effects.

"It would be hard to craft a description engineered to be less interesting to me, and yet, as I plowed through this collection from the series' beginnings, I frequently found myself amended and entertained.
