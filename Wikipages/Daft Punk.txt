'''Daft Punk''' were a<!--Please don't add awards to the lead sentence. Listing awards here highlight them over other content in the article, therefore violating the neutral point of view policy. Thank you.--> French [[electronic music]] duo formed in 1993 in Paris by [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]] and [[Thomas Bangalter]]. Widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in [[dance music]] history, they achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the [[French house]] movement. They garnered critical acclaim and commercial success in the years following, combining elements of [[house music]] with [[funk]], [[techno]], [[disco]], [[indie rock]] and [[Pop music|pop]].

After Bangalter and Homem-Christo's [[indie rock]] band [[Darlin' (French band)|Darlin']] disbanded, they began experimenting with [[drum machine]]s, [[synthesiser]]s and the [[talk box]]. Their debut studio album ''[[Homework (Daft Punk album)|Homework]]'' was released by [[Virgin Records]] in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by singles "[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]" and "[[Da Funk]]". From 1999, they assumed [[robot]] personas with helmets, outfits and gloves for public appearances to preserve their identities; they made few media appearances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wnyekw/daft-punk-birth-of-robots|title=Daft Punk: The Birth of The Robots|first=Piers|last=Martin|date=4 December 2013|access-date=18 December 2018|archive-date=7 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200207181144/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wnyekw/daft-punk-birth-of-robots|url-status=live}}</ref> They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by [[Pedro Winter]], the head of [[Ed Banger Records]].

Daft Punk's second album, ''[[Discovery (Daft Punk album)|Discovery]]'' (2001), had further success, supported by hit singles "[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]", "[[Digital Love (Daft Punk song)|Digital Love]]" and "[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]". The album became the basis for an animated film, ''[[Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem|Interstella 5555]],'' supervised by a Japanese animator [[Leiji Matsumoto]]. Daft Punk's third album, ''[[Human After All]]'' (2005), received mixed reviews, though the singles "[[Robot Rock (song)|Robot Rock]]" and "[[Technologic]]" achieved success in the United Kingdom. The duo directed their first film, ''[[Electroma]]'', an avant-garde science fiction film, in 2006. They [[Alive 2006/2007|toured throughout 2006 and 2007]] and released the live album ''[[Alive 2007]]'', which won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Electronic/Dance Album]];  the tour is credited for popularising dance music in North America. Daft Punk composed [[Tron: Legacy (soundtrack)|the score]] for the 2010 film ''[[Tron: Legacy]]''.

In 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for [[Columbia Records]] and released their fourth album, ''[[Random Access Memories]]'', to acclaim; lead single "[[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]]" reached the top 10 in the charts of 32 countries. ''Random Access Memories'' won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] for "Get Lucky". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their only number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with "[[Starboy (song)|Starboy]]", a collaboration with [[the Weeknd]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them the 12th greatest musical duo. They announced their split in <!--THE EXACT DATE DOESN'T MATTER HERE - THIS IS JUST A SUMMARY-->2021.<!--Sourced in body-->

''Discovery'' saw Daft Punk integrating influences from 70s [[disco]] and 80s [[crooner]]s, and featured collaborations with Romanthony and Edwards.
