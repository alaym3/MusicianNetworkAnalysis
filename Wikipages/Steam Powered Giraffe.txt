'''Steam Powered Giraffe''' is an American musical project formed in [[San Diego]] in 2008, self-described as "a musical act that combines robot pantomime, puppetry, ballet, comedy, projections, and music".<ref name="01/27/2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/1825159860851840|title=THIS SHOW IS NOW SOLD OUT|publisher=Steam Powered Giraffe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/lifestyles/ct-sta-lockport-summer-arts-st-0616-20170608-story.html|title=Lockport's annual Summer Art Series kicks off with Old Canal Days|author=Vickie Snow Jurkowski|work=[[Daily Southtown]]|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> Created and led by twins David Michael Bennett and Isabella Bunny Bennett, the act combines music and [[Improvisational theatre|improvisational]] comedy on-stage, although their studio works focus almost solely on music.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.steampoweredgiraffe.com/info.html | title=Whut is Steam Powered Giraffe | publisher=Steam Powered Giraffe | access-date=April 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.steampoweredgiraffe.com/GG.html | title=GG: The Giraffe | publisher=Steam Powered Giraffe | access-date=April 26, 2014}}</ref>

Steam Powered Giraffe has its own fictional mythology, with the band members portraying characters both on stage and on record; its fictional universe has been explored via several comic books mainly written and drawn by Isabella Bennett. Although the band underwent several line-up changes, it always focuses primarily on three robot characters (played by the Bennett siblings and a third performer, although the original line-up featured four robots), with several "humans" assisting and performing comedy, music and dancing on stage, and several smaller robots being performed via puppetry or voice acting. To date, they have released six studio albums, a few singles, cover songs, two live albums, several live concert films, provided the soundtrack for the 2015 video game ''[[SteamWorld Heist]]'', and released an official single for the 2016 video game [[Battleborn (video game)|''Battleborn'']].

== Career ==
=== 2008–2011: Formation and early career ===
The members of Steam Powered Giraffe met while taking Theatre Arts at [[Grossmont College]]. Afterwards, they became members of a local San Diego pantomime group called Troupe SD. Trained in pantomime by [[Seaport Village]] mime Jerry "Kazoo" Hager, and with collective backgrounds in clown, theater, music, and visual design, Jonathan Sprague, Erin Burke (a fellow pantomime artist) and the Bennett twins—Isabella and David—started street busking as quirky robotic characters in January 2008 at Balboa Park, California. For their first performance in public they called themselves ''Steam Powered Giraffe Presents: Peoplebots'' . Later that month they changed their name to just ''Steam Powered Giraffe''. Erin Burke left the group in 2011 to pursue a career in acting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steam Powered Giraffe – Artist Bio|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_bio/321265|publisher=[[ReverbNation]]|access-date=2011-10-31}}</ref>

Since their conception, the band has performed at venues including the [[San Diego County Fair]], [[San Diego Zoo]],<ref>{{cite web|title=San Diego Zoo : Extended Summer Hours and Entertainment at Nighttime Zoo|url=http://randomsandiego.com/blog/2011/06/09/san-diego-zoo-extended-summer-hours-entertainment-nighttime-zoo/|publisher=Random San Diego|date=9 June 2011|access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=marysue>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/steam-powered-giraffe-a-folk-vaudevillian-comic-rock-opera-experience-for-the-whole-family/|title=Steam Powered Giraffe: A Folk-Vaudevillian-Comic-Rock Opera Experience for the Whole Family|author=Sara Goodwin|date=December 29, 2015|website=The Mary Sue|access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> [[San Diego Zoo Safari Park|Wild Animal Park]], [[Legoland California]], [[Ontario Mills]], [[Downtown Disney]], and numerous science fiction, fantasy, anime, and steampunk conventions.

In October 2009, the band released their first album, ''Album One''. It contained the previously released single from May 2009 titled "On Top of the Universe",<ref>{{cite web|title=New Single With An Album On The Way!|date=17 May 2009|url=http://steampoweredgiraffe.blogspot.com/2009/05/new-single-with-album-on-way.html|publisher=Blogspot|access-date=6 December 2012}}</ref> in 2009. In early 2011 the band released a single, "Honeybee", announcing that it would be on an upcoming second album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steam Powered Giraffe Blog: Honeybee Now Available!|url=http://steampoweredgiraffe.blogspot.com/2011/02/honeybee-now-available.html|date=February 2, 2011|author=The Spine|publisher=Blogspot|access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref> In late 2011 the band announced the release of a "live" album entitled ''Live at the Globe of Yesterday's Tomorrow''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Live at the Globe of Yesterday's Tomorrow|url=http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150450790161355.418970.67971536354&type=3|author=Steam Powered Giraffe|date=2011-11-16|publisher=Facebook|access-date=2011-11-19}}</ref>

=== 2012–2013: ''The 2¢ Show'' and ''MK III'' ===
Their second studio album, entitled ''The 2¢ Show'', was released in May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 2¢ Show Now Available!|date=23 May 2012|url=http://steampoweredgiraffe.blogspot.com/2012/05/2-show-now-available.html|publisher=Blogspot|access-date=6 December 2012}}</ref> That year, they were voted Best Live Comedy act (and runner up for Best Family Entertainment act) on San Diego A-List.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 Award Winner|url=http://sandiegoalist.cityvoter.com/steam-powered-giraffe/biz/432933|publisher=San Diego A-List|access-date=2012-09-24}}</ref>

Besides their musical endeavors, the band publishes a web comic<ref>{{cite web|title=Steam Powered Giraffe The Webcomic|url=http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/16797/Steam-Powered-Giraffe-The-Webcomic|publisher=The Webcomic List|access-date=2 November 2011}}</ref> and has produced a card game based on characters in their backstory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steam Powered Giraffe The Card Game|url=http://gamenightguys.com/index.php/2011/02/steam-powered-giraffe-the-card-game/|date=24 February 2011|publisher=Game Night Guys|access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref> In April 2012 they released a DVD entitled, ''Steam Powered Giraffe: The DVD (and the Quest For the Eternal Harp of Golden Dreams)''.

On 24 September 2012, the band announced on their [[Tumblr]] page that Jon Sprague would no longer be a part of the group.<ref>http://officialsteampoweredgiraffe.tumblr.com/post/32204911846/jon-sprague-departing-steam-powered-giraffe-dear</ref> On 1 October it was announced that Sam Luke, the drummer for the band at the time, would become the new robot in the band, "Hatchworth".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steampoweredgiraffe.blogspot.com/2012/10/welcome-hatchworth.html|title=Steam Powered Giraffe Blog: Welcome Hatchworth!|first=The|last=Spine|date=1 October 2012|access-date=28 October 2016}}</ref> On 2 November 2012, Hatchworth made his stage debut with SPG at [[Youmacon]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan with interim drummer Mike Buxbaum (of A City Serene). Later, Matt Smith was named SPG's new drummer.

During this time, SPG also introduced the characters of the Walter Girls into their shows. The Girls started out by manning the band's merchandise tables at performances, but have started figuring in to the SPG stage show and back story. Described as "blue matter engineers", the porcelian-white skinned and blue-haired Walter Girls (now called Walter Workers) are essentially the robot's caretakers on stage.

In June 2013, SPG released a cover of [[Rihanna]]'s [[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|"Diamonds"]], essentially a solo performance by the Spine. The accompanying video, released to YouTube, introduced a new character to the SPG canon, a robotic giraffe puppet named GG (voiced by Bunny Bennett). GG appeared again in July when the band released a comedic video, "Walter Robotics Rap", to YouTube.

On 9 August 2013, Steam Powered Giraffe announced the title to their third album, ''MK III''. The album was released on December 3. In September of that same year, the band released a cover of [[Icona Pop|Icona Pop's]] [[I Love It (Icona Pop song)|"I Love It"]] on their YouTube channel.

=== 2014–2016: ''The Vice Quadrant'' and ''Quintessential'' ===
On March 18, 2014, it was announced that Michael Reed and Matt Smith would no longer be performing members of Steam Powered Giraffe. The Bennett twins stated that the reasons for their departure was to focus more on the theatrical elements of the act and to reduce the cost of touring, but they have also stated in recent years on their podcast ''The Bennettarium'' that Michael Reed had neglected his contracted work on their ''MK III'' album, with him having to cram in all his work the last few weeks of production.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Bennettarium|url=https://thebennettarium.libsyn.com/|access-date=2020-11-28|website=thebennettarium.libsyn.com|language=en}}</ref>

Early in 2014, Isabella Bennett began to transition the character of Rabbit from male to female, coinciding with her own status as a [[Trans woman|transgender woman]].<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=https://steampoweredgiraffe.com/index.php/info/#1447706691209-8d06800a-e718|title=Info: Meet the Band|publisher=Steam Powered Giraffe|date=2014|access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref>  She legally changed her name to Isabella Bennett on 22 January 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/TheBunnyBennett/photos/a.323649511084357.76188.278515015597807/907517229364246 | title=Isabella now and forever... | first=Isabella | last=Bennett | publisher=[[Facebook]] | date=22 January 2016}}</ref>

More videos have followed in the meantime. In May 2014, they released their third cover, a mostly acoustic version of [[Daft Punk]]'s "[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]". The video marked the first "official" appearance by the female Rabbit to the general public at large (although the band had played some dates prior and some photos and raw audience footage had been seen). The band then followed up with two new videos: "Fancy Shoes" in June and "I'll Rust With You" in July, with the latter featuring live footage recorded at [[Anime Midwest]] in Rosemont, Illinois.

In September 2014, Steam Powered Giraffe gave their first international performance, playing at the Grand Canadian Steampunk Exposition in [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario]]. They returned for the 2015 Exposition to do a collaboration show with [[Professor Elemental]].

On September 1, 2015, SPG released ''The Vice Quadrant: A Space Opera'', a 2-disc [[space opera]] concept album containing 28 tracks, although iTunes released it as two separate albums for download. The release followed a number of video releases to promote the work. This marked the band's first recorded work with Rabbit presenting as a woman, as well as the first full album recorded strictly as a trio. The album featured an appearance by Professor Elemental as well as vocals by Walter Worker Chelsea Penyak.

In December 2015, video game developer [[Image & Form]] released the game ''[[SteamWorld Heist]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]], and later released it in 2016 on other platforms. The game's soundtrack was composed and recorded by SPG, and they appear in-game.<ref name=marysue /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nintendonews.com/reviews/steamworld-heist-review-wii-u/|title=SteamWorld Heist Review (Wii U)|author=Adam Miller|date=November 30, 2016|website=Nintendo News|access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref>

The video game ''[[Battleborn (video game)|Battleborn]]'' by [[Gearbox Software]] released on May 3, 2016, and included an unlockable theme song created by Steam Powered Giraffe for the character of Montana; the same day, the band released it on digital platforms as a single.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Montana (From "Battleborn") (2016)|url=https://www.spgiraffestore.com/products/montana-from-battleborn-2016|access-date=2019-02-28|website=Steam Powered Giraffe}}</ref>

On June 20, 2016, Steam Powered Giraffe announced on their website that their fifth studio album, ''Quintessential'' was available for pre-order.<ref name="auto">Bennet, David Michael.

=== 2016–2019: New member ===
On December 19, 2016, the band announced on social media that Samuel Luke would be leaving the group so he could focus more on his independent work as an artist and musician. He then announced that he would immediately be replaced by Bryan Barbarin and his character Zero.<ref>Bennett, David M. “Officialsteampoweredgiraffe.” The Official Steam Powered Giraffe Tumblr, Tumblr, 19 Dec. 2016, officialsteampoweredgiraffe.tumblr.com/post/154670547261/whats-next-for-steam-powered-giraffe-in-2017.</ref> The next day, the Bennetts, Sam, and Bryan came together in David and Isabella's new podcast, ''The Bennettarium'', to discuss the robot transition, among other things.<ref>The Bennettarium Podcast (Video) - Episode 10: Shut Up Abraham Lincoln!” Youtube, 20 Dec. 2016, www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBbRdY6Bwgg.</ref> Zero's first live show occurred on February 18, 2017, at The Center Theater at The California Center for the Arts in Escondido, California.<ref>“STEAM POWERED GIRAFFE LIVE IN CONCERT.” California Center for the Arts, Escondido, 2018, artcenter.org/event/steam-powered-giraffe-2/.</ref>

It was confirmed on March 12, 2017, following her appearance on ''The Bennettarium'', that the 2009 original release of the band's ''Album One'' album, featuring a song and some vocals by past band member Erin Burke would be re-released. Both the 2009 and 2011 version now co-exist.

On July 20, 2017 the band performed a show during San Diego Comic Con with former member Michael Philip Reed joining them on stage. Since this show, Michael joined the band for most shows up until February 2020.

On January 27, 2018 Steam Powered Giraffe celebrated the band's 10th anniversary with a special concert featuring all members in the band's history, including all five former members: robots The Jon, Upgrade and Hatchworth, and humans Michael Philip Reed and Matthew Smith. It was later released as a live concert film on Blu-Ray, DVD, and digital video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spgiraffestore.com/collections/video/products/steam-powered-giraffe-10-year-anniversary-show-digital-concert-ticket-2018|title = Steam Powered Giraffe: 10 Year Anniversary Show (2018)}}</ref>

On April 18, 2019 the band announced the production of their next album, the first to feature Bryan and the first since ''MK III'' to feature Michael Philip Reed. They also confirmed that they would be releasing two new songs every three to four months alongside music videos for each song.<ref>https://steampoweredgiraffe.com/</ref>

=== 2020–present: ''1896'' ===
On March 3, 2020 the band announced that backing musician Michael Philip Reed was suddenly leaving the band to move out of the country.<ref>https://www.patreon.com/posts/34566673</ref>  Reed had provided some contributions to tracks on the band's 6th album ''1896'' prior to his departure.

On November 9, 2020 the band released their newest album ''1896'', a 2-disc album featuring 22 songs, 10 of which are acoustic versions of other songs on the album. The acoustic tracks are exclusive to purchases of the album and are not on streaming services on release.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Steam Powered Giraffe – Official Website of Steam Powered Giraffe|url=https://steampoweredgiraffe.com/|access-date=2020-11-28|language=en-US}}</ref>
