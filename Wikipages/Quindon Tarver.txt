'''Quindon Tarver''' (August 4, 1982 – April 1, 2021) was an American singer. He was best known for his covers of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[When Doves Cry]]" and [[Rozalla]]'s "[[Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)|Everybody's Free]]" for the 1996 film ''[[Romeo + Juliet|William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet]]''.

==Life and career==
Tarver was born in McKinney, Texas. He started out singing in a church choir. In 1996, he appeared as the choir boy in the [[Baz Luhrmann]] movie ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'', co-starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Claire Danes]]. Tarver's covers of "[[Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)]]" and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s  "[[When Doves Cry]]" were included on ''Romeo + Juliet'''s soundtrack, which sold two million copies, earning double-platinum status.

His album, ''Quindon'', was released in 1996 by [[Virgin Records]] and included the single "It's You That's on My Mind", which charted in Australia and New Zealand. Under the same management as then teen sensations [[IMx|Immature]] (later known as IMx), Smooth, Gyrl, and [[B2K]], Tarver began to appeal to a large market of teens and subsequently toured the world with the likes of Immature, [[Brandy (singer)|Brandy]], and [[Monica (singer)|Monica]].

Tarver contributed to the soundtracks of feature films ''[[Kazaam]]'' (A&M Records) and ''[[Down in the Delta]]'' (Virgin Records). He made appearances on ''[[Good Morning America]],'' ''[[Soul Train]]'' and ''[[American Idol]]'' (during seasons two and seven, in which he finished in the show's top fifty). He has worked with artists, including [[Faith Evans]], [[Playa (band)|Playa]], Tiny (of [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]] and [[VH1]]'s ''Family Hustle'') and Nokio (of R&B group [[Dru Hill]]). He has worked with record producers [[Johntá Austin]] and Troy Taylor.

In 2016, Tarver was invited to perform "When Doves Cry" as part of a Los Angeles tribute to the late musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. In a later interview, Tarver stated that the performance and the audience response to it was a turning point in his life, motivating him to enter rehab and resume a singing career.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quindon Tarver was the child star of Romeo + Juliet: what happened next? |url=https://www.abc.net.au/doublej/music-reads/features/quindon-tarver-was-the-child-star-of-romeo-juliet-what-happened-/10267808 |website=Double J |access-date=15 January 2019 |language=en-AU |date=26 June 2017}}</ref>

In 2017, Tarver released a new version of "Everybody's Free".

==Personal life==
In 2008, Tarver and [[De'Mario Thornton]], a former member of B2K, spoke publicly in an interview with [[Vibe (magazine)|''Vibe'' magazine]] about abuse they suffered as children at the hands of their manager and producer Chris Stokes, and the singer [[Marques Houston]]. In 2010, Thornton covertly recorded a conversation with Tarver, where both men discussed details of their abuse.
