A '''plum''' is a [[fruit]] of some species in [[Prunus subg. Prunus|''Prunus'' subg. ''Prunus'']]''.'' Mature plum fruits may have a dusty-white waxy coating that gives them a [[glaucous]] appearance. This is an [[epicuticular wax]] coating and is known as "wax bloom". Dried plums are called [[prune]]s, which have a dark, wrinkled appearance.<ref name="oxford">{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/prune|title=Prune|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press|date=2018|access-date=1 March 2018}}</ref>

==History==

Plums may have been one of the first fruits domesticated by humans.<ref>{{cite book|title=Horticultural Reviews (Volume 23)|editor=Jules Janick|year=1998|isbn=978-0471254454|publisher=Wiley}}</ref> Three of the most abundantly cultivated species are not found in the wild, only around human settlements: ''[[Prunus domestica]]'' has been traced to East European and Caucasian mountains, while ''[[Prunus salicina]]'' and ''[[Prunus simonii]]'' originated in China.

==Etymology and names==
The name plum derived from [[Old English]] ''plume'' or "plum, plum tree", which extended from [[Germanic language]] or [[Middle Dutch]], and [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|prūnum}}'',<ref>{{L&S|prunum|prūnum|ref}}</ref> from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|προῦμνον}} ''proumnon'',<ref>{{LSJ|prou{{=}}mnon|προῦμνον|ref}}.</ref> believed to be a loanword from [[Asia Minor]].<ref name=oxford/><ref name="eol">{{OEtymD|plum}}</ref> In the late 18th century, the word, plum, was used to indicate "something desirable", probably in reference to tasty fruit pieces in [[dessert]]s.<ref name=eol/>

==Description==
Plums are a diverse group of species. The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to {{convert|5|–|6|m}} height. The tree is of medium hardiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plum, prune, European type|publisher=Purdue University|year=1999|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412183755/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Crops/Plum_prune.html|archive-date=2012-04-12}}</ref> Without pruning, the trees can reach {{convert|12|m|ft}} in height and spread across {{convert|10|m|ft}}. They blossom in different months in different parts of the world; for example, in about January in Taiwan and early April in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|title=Prunus domestica Plum, European plum PFAF Plant Database|work=pfaf.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122110734/http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+domestica|archive-date=2012-11-22}}</ref>

Fruits are usually of medium size, between {{convert|2|-|7|cm}} in diameter, globose to oval. The flesh is firm and juicy. The fruit's peel is smooth, with a natural waxy surface that adheres to the flesh. The plum is a [[drupe]], meaning its fleshy fruit surrounds a single hard [[Pyrena|fruitstone]] which encloses the fruit's seed.

Japanese or Chinese plums are large and juicy with a long shelf life, and therefore dominate the fresh fruit market. They are usually clingstone and not suitable for making prunes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Plums|url=https://magazine.wsu.edu/2017/08/07/plums/|access-date=2021-02-20|website=Washington State Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref> They are cultivars of ''[[Prunus salicina]]'' or its hybrids. The cultivars developed in the US are mostly hybrids of [[Prunus salicina|''P. salicina'']] with [[Prunus simonii|''P. simonii'']] and [[Prunus cerasifera|''P. cerasifera'']]. Although these cultivars are often called Japanese plums, two of the three parents (''P. salicina'' and ''P. simonii'') originated from China and one (''P. cerasifera'') from Eurasia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boonprakob|first=U.|last2=Byrne|first2=D.H.|date=2003|title=Species composition of Japanese plum founding clones as revealed by RAPD markers|url=https://doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2003.622.51|journal=Acta Horticulturae|issue=622|pages=473–476|doi=10.17660/actahortic.2003.622.51|issn=0567-7572}}</ref>
[[File:Prune.JPG|thumb|Prune, a dried plum]]
In some parts of Europe, European plum (''[[Prunus domestica]]'') is also common in fresh fruit market. It has both dessert (eating) or culinary (cooking) [[cultivar]]s, which include:
* [[Damson]] (purple or black skin, green flesh, clingstone, astringent)
* [[Prune plum]] (usually oval, freestone, sweet, fresh eaten or used to make prunes)
* [[Greengage]] (firm, green flesh and skin even when ripe)
* [[Mirabelle Plum|Mirabelle]] (dark yellow, predominantly grown in northeast [[France]])
* [[Victoria plum|Victoria]] (yellow flesh with a red or mottled skin)
* [[Yellowgage (plum)|Yellowgage]] or golden plum (similar to greengage, but yellow)

In West Asia, myrobalan plum or cherry plum (''[[Prunus cerasifera]]'') is also widely cultivated. In Russia, apart from these three commonly cultivated species, there are also many cultivars resulting from hybridization between Japanese plum and myrobalan plum, known as Russian plum ([[Prunus × rossica|''Prunus'' × ''rossica'']]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eremin|first=G.V.|date=2006|title=''Prunus rossica'' (Rosaceae), a new hybridogenous species|url=https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=9274159|journal=Botanicheskii Zhurnal|volume=91|issue=9|pages=1405–1410}}</ref>

When it flowers in the early spring, a plum tree will be covered in [[blossom]]s, and in a good year approximately 50% of the flowers will be pollinated and become plums. Flowering starts after 80 [[growing degree day]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

If the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]]. Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]], including [[November moth]], [[willow beauty]] and [[short-cloaked moth]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

The taste of the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be particularly tart.  It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in [[jam]]-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into [[plum wine]]. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as [[plum jerkum]] is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as ''[[saladitos|saladito]]'' or ''salao''. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, [[ginseng]], spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. [[Licorice]] is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for [[slush (beverage)|shaved ice]] or ''[[baobing]]''. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called ''[[umeboshi]]'', is often used for rice balls, called ''onigiri'' or ''omusubi''.  The ''[[ume]]'', from which ''umeboshi'' are made, is more closely related, however, to the [[apricot]] than to the plum. In the [[Balkans]], plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named ''[[slivovitz]]'' (plum brandy) (Serbian: ''[[šljivovica]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aroma Constituents of Plum Brandy|author=Crowell and Guymon|journal=[[American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|American Journal of Enology]]|year= 1973|volume= 24|number=4|pages=159–165}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The neutral volatile components of Czechoslovak plum brandy|author1=Jan Velíšek |author2=František Pudil |author3=Jiří Davídek |author4=Vladislav Kubelka |journal=Zeitschrift für Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung A|volume= 174|number= 6|year=1982|pages= 463–466|doi= 10.1007/BF01042726|s2cid=88247885 }}</ref> A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called ''szilva'' and are used to make ''[[lekvar]]'' (a plum paste jam), ''[[palinka]]'' (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods. In Romania, 80% of the plum production is used to create a similar brandy, called ''[[țuică]]''.<ref name="prod">[https://observator.tv/social/romanii-cei-mai-mari-producatori-de-prune-din-europa-insa-recolta-nu-ajunge-in-borcanele-cu-magiun-ci-in-cazanele-de-tuica-233725.html România e cel mai mare producător de prune din UE.

As with many other members of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]], plum kernels contain [[Glycosides#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]], including [[amygdalin]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Burrows, G.E. |author2=Tyrl, R.J. |date=2012 |title= Toxic Plants of North America |chapter= Rosaceae Juss. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |pages= 1064–1094}}</ref> Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum. Though not available commercially, the wood of plum trees is used by hobbyists and other private woodworkers for musical instruments, knife handles, inlays, and similar small projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/hardwoods/plum/|title=Plum|work=The Wood Database|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025221826/http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/hardwoods/plum/|archive-date=2014-10-25}}</ref>

==Production==
In 2019, global production of plums (data combined with [[sloe]]s) was 12.6 million [[tonne]]s, led by China with 56% of the world total (table).<ref name=fao/> [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]] were secondary producers.<ref name=fao/>

==Nutrition==

Raw plums are 87% water, 11% [[carbohydrates]], 1% [[protein]], and less than 1% [[fat]] (table). In a {{convert|100|g|oz|frac=2|abbr=off|adj=on}} reference serving, raw plums supply {{convert|192|kJ|kcal|abbr=off}} of [[food energy]] and are a moderate source only of [[vitamin C]] (12% [[Daily Value]]), with no other [[micronutrient]]s in significant content (table).

==Species==
{{main|Prunus subg. Prunus}}
The numerous species of [[Prunus subg. Prunus|''Prunus'' subg. ''Prunus'']] are classified into many sections, but not all of them are called plums. Plums include species of sect. ''Prunus'' and sect. ''Prunocerasus'',<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Shi|first1=Shuo|last2=Li|first2=Jinlu|last3=Sun|first3=Jiahui|last4=Yu|first4=Jing|last5=Zhou|first5=Shiliang|date=2013|title=Phylogeny and classification of ''Prunus sensu lato'' (Rosaceae)|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jipb.12095|journal=Journal of Integrative Plant Biology|language=en|volume=55|issue=11|pages=1069–1079|doi=10.1111/jipb.12095|pmid=23945216|issn=1744-7909|via=}}</ref> as well as ''[[Prunus mume|P. mume]]'' of sect. ''Armeniaca''. Only two plum species, the hexaploid European plum (''[[Prunus domestica]]'') and the diploid Japanese plum (''[[Prunus salicina]]'' and hybrids), are of worldwide commercial significance. The origin of ''P. domestica'' is uncertain but may have involved P. cerasifera and possibly P. spinosa as ancestors. Other species of plum variously originated in Europe, Asia and America.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bruce L. Topp|title=Plum (Handbook of Plant Breeding)|author2=Dougal M.

In certain parts of the world, some fruits are called plums and are quite different from fruits known as plums in Europe or the Americas. For example, [[Bouea macrophylla|marian plums]] are popular in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, otherwise also known as ''gandaria'', ''plum mango'', ''ma-praang'', ''ma-yong'', ''ramania'', ''kundang'', ''rembunia'' or ''setar''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Under-Utilized Tropical Fruits of Thailand (see Part 1, section 3)|publisher=FAO, United Nations|year=2001|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/ab777e/ab777e00.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715213406/http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/ab777e/ab777e00.htm|archive-date=2011-07-15}}</ref> Another example is the [[loquat]], also known as Japanese plum and Japanese medlar, as well as ''nispero'', ''bibassier'' and ''wollmispel'' elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nassau.ifas.ufl.edu/horticulture/fruit/loquat.html|title=Japanese Plum - Loquat|publisher=University of Florida, Nassau County Extension, Horticulture|year=2006 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080723230636/http://nassau.ifas.ufl.edu/horticulture/fruit/loquat.html | archive-date=23 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Loquat|publisher=University of Purdue|author=J.
