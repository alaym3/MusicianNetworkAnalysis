'''Stanley Robert Vinton''' (born April 16, 1935), better known by his stage name '''Bobby Vinton''', is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. As a [[teen idol]], he became known as 'The Polish Prince', as his music paid tribute to his Polish heritage. One of his most popular songs is "[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]" (a cover of the 1951 song recorded by [[Tony Bennett]]) which reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1963 and No. 2 in the UK in 1990.

==Early life==
Vinton was born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, the only child of locally popular [[bandleader]] Stan Vinton and Dorothy Studzinski Vinton.<ref name=Hits>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZcgdAAAAIBAJ&pg=6469,1592699&dq=stan+vinton&hl=en |title=Bobby Vinton Finds That Hits Can Be Elusive |last=Bishop |first=Pete |date=June 5, 1983 |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |access-date=May 2, 2011}}</ref> He is of Polish and Lithuanian descent.

At 16, Vinton formed his first [[musical ensemble|band]], which played clubs around the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] area. With the money he earned, he helped finance his college education at [[Duquesne University]], where he graduated with a degree in musical composition.<ref name=Hits/> While at Duquesne, he became proficient on all of the [[musical instrument|instruments]] in the band: [[piano]], [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]], [[trumpet]], [[drum]]s, and [[oboe]].<ref name=Doctorate/> When Vinton became an active musician, it was common for people to become confused with the bands of father and son, for both were named Stanley. Vinton's father suggested his son use his middle name of Robert professionally to clear up the confusion.<ref name=Rogers>{{cite news |last=Rogers |first=John |title='Polish Prince' Reigns in a Country Town |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xGdYAAAAIBAJ&pg=6200,5261723&dq=stan+vinton&hl=en |newspaper=Lakeland Ledger |date=July 27, 1999 |access-date=May 2, 2011}}</ref>

Vinton's birthplace of [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]], is also the birthplace of [[Perry Como]],<ref name="Celebration">{{cite news |last=Funk |first=Harry |title=A celebration for Mr. C. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PjFdAAAAIBAJ&pg=1551,4484718&dq=perry+como+rca&hl=en |newspaper=Observer-Reporter |location=Washington, PA |date=May 14, 1999 |access-date=November 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://canonsburgfriends.blogspot.co.uk/2009/01/joey-powers.html  Terry Hazlett, "National music spotlight fell on area thanks to Vinton and Powers", ''Canonsburg Friends'', January 13, 2009]. Retrieved June 9, 2014</ref> Vinton's hometown named two streets, Bobby Vinton Boulevard and the shorter adjoining Bobby Vinton Drive, in his honor. These streets were built in the late 1970s; prior attempts to name a residential street after him failed. The residents had not cared for the singer always claiming Pittsburgh as his home town on TV interviews. Como always claimed Canonsburg as his hometown, so hundreds of people changed their address when the town renamed a street in the east end after Perry Como. The Canonsburg town fathers had plans to erect a statue in Vinton's honour, but Vinton himself vetoed the idea, noting that the $100,000 planned cost could go to far more important town needs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vinton: Tribute is Just Too Much |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k7ciAAAAIBAJ&pg=1150,7087216&dq=bobby+vinton+statue&hl=en |newspaper=[[The Beaver County Times]] |location=Beaver, PA |date=December 28, 2004 |access-date=June 27, 2010}}</ref>

==Career==
===1950s===
According to his autobiography, Bobby was inspired to record his music by the Elvis Presley movie ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]''. He formed his own record label, Bobby Records, in October 1958. His first release was "Twilight Time", backed with "Hallelujah". Bobby sang on the B-side of the 45 rpm release, making this his first commercially released vocal recording. This record did not chart. In March 1959, Bobby recorded for the Melody label out of Philadelphia, listed as "Bobby Vinton and his Orchestra" for the first time. His release of "Harlem Nocturne", backed with "Always in My Heart" with a vocal by Bobby, attracted attention in Pennsylvania. His 'young man with a big band' style was established here, and "Always In My Heart" would be a song he would return to. In August 1959, Bobby moved to another larger record company, Alpine Records. He released two self-written singles for Alpine, the first being "You'll Never Forget" backed by "First Impression". The second Alpine release was "A Freshman and a Sophomore", backed with the self-written "The Sheik"; this was released in February 1960. Both Alpine releases garnered ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine mentions.

===1960s===
After two years of service in the [[United States Army]], in which he served as a chaplain's assistant, Vinton was signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1960 as a bandleader: "A Young Man With a Big Band". The break for the Epic Records contract had come after Vinton and his band appeared on [[Guy Lombardo]]'s ''TV Talent Scouts'' program.<ref name=Hits/><ref name=Slow/> Since March 20, 1961, his released three singles. Titled "Posin'" "Little lonely one" and "Well I ask ya",these records were his vocal recordings, and the flip sides were credited to "Bobby Vinton And His Orchestra". Despite the big label backing, the three singles were not successful, and two albums, ''Bobby Vinton Dancing At The Hop'' and ''Bobby Vinton Plays for his Lil Darlin's'' did not sell well. With Epic ready to drop him from its roster, Vinton found the material for his first hit single literally sitting in a reject pile.<ref name=Wilson/> The song was titled "[[Roses Are Red (My Love)]]".<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |date=1997 |edition=Concise |isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1220}}</ref> Vinton had to do his own promotion for the song; he bought one thousand copies and hired a young woman to deliver a copy of the record and a dozen red roses to every local DJ.<ref name=Hits/><ref name=Velvet>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OTkxAAAAIBAJ&pg=6287,560151&dq=stan+vinton&hl=en|title=Bobby Vinton still smooth as blue velvet|author=Hayes, John|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=March 2, 2002|access-date=May 2, 2011}}</ref> It spent four weeks at [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1962|number one]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song was also a hit on the Country and R&B charts. The success of the song pushed Epic to renew Vinton's contract and change his status from bandleader to solo singer.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Arguably, Vinton's most famous song is 1963's "[[Blue Velvet (Tony Bennett song)|Blue Velvet]]", originally a minor hit for [[Tony Bennett]] in 1951, that also spent three weeks at the number one positions in ''Billboard'', ''Cash Box'', and ''Record World'' magazines. In 1986, 23 years later, [[David Lynch]] named his movie ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' after the song.<ref name="Larkin"/> In 1990, "Blue Velvet" reached number 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], after being featured in a [[Nivea]] commercial. The 1990 reissue also hit number 3 in the Irish Singles Chart and number 7 in Australia.

In 1964, Vinton had two number 1 hits, "[[There! I've Said It Again]]" (a number 1 hit in 1945 for [[Vaughn Monroe]]) in January and "[[Mr. Lonely (Bobby Vinton song)|Mr. Lonely]]" in December.  Vinton's version of "There! I've Said It Again" is noteworthy for being the last U.S. ''Billboard'' number-one single of the pre-[[Beatles]] era, deposed from the Hot 100 summit by "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]". Also noteworthy is the fact that Vinton continued to have big hit records during the [[British Invasion]], scoring 16 top-ten hits, while [[Connie Francis]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Shirelles]], and other major artists of the early 1960s struggled to reach even the Top 40.

Vinton wrote and composed "Mr. Lonely" during his chaplain's assistant service in the U.S. Army in the late 1950s. The song was recorded during the same 1962 session that produced "[[Roses Are Red (My Love)]]", and the two songs launched Vinton's singing career. It was released as an album track on the 1962 ''[[Roses Are Red (album)|Roses Are Red]] (and other songs for the young & sentimental)'' LP. Despite pressure from Vinton to release it as a single, Epic instead had [[Buddy Greco]] release it and it flopped. Two years and millions of records sold later, Bobby prevailed on Epic to include "Mr. Lonely" on his ''[[Bobby Vinton's Greatest Hits (1964 album)|Bobby Vinton's Greatest Hits]]'' LP.  Soon DJs picked up on the song and airplay resulted in demand for a single release. "Mr. Lonely" shot up the charts in the late fall of 1964 to reach number 1 on the Hot 100 on December 12, 1964. Epic then released the LP ''Bobby Vinton Mr. Lonely'', giving the song a unique claim to fame since it now appeared on three Bobby Vinton albums released within two years. The song continued to spin gold for Vinton, its author-[[composer]], in the 50+ years to date since reaching number 1; [[Harmony Korine]] named his 2007 film ''[[Mister Lonely]]'' after the latter and features the song in the film's opening, and it was also the basis for [[Akon]]'s 2005 hit, "[[Lonely (Akon song)|Lonely]]".
[[File:Bobby Vinton 1969.JPG|thumb|Vinton performing on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1969]]

In 1965, Vinton continued his "Lonely" success streak with the self-written "[[L-O-N-E-L-Y]]". "[[Long Lonely Nights]]" peaked at number 17 and spawned an album, ''[[Bobby Vinton Sings for Lonely Nights]]''. Vinton's self-written 1966 hit "[[Coming Home Soldier]]" hit No. 11 on the Hot 100 and was a favorite on request shows on the [[American Forces Network]] during the [[Cold War]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] era, often called in by soldiers about to board the [[Government contract flight|Freedom Bird]] that would take them back to the "Land of the Round Doorknobs". Vinton's lush 1967 remake of "[[Please Love Me Forever]]", which reached number 6 and sold over a million copies, began a string of twelve consecutive Hot 100 hits, all remakes, over a little less than five-and-a-half years.<ref name="Larkin"/> His 1968 hit "[[I Love How You Love Me]]" surged to number 9, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book |last=Murrells |first=Joseph |title=The Book of Golden Discs |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/250 |url-access=registration |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |edition=2nd |year=1978 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/250 250] |isbn=0-214-20512-6}}</ref>

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Bobby Vinton continued to hit the Top 40, notably with "[[Ev'ry Day of My Life]]", a No. 2 Adult Contemporary hit also awarded the Jukebox single of the year award which was produced by [[Jimmy Bowen]] and CBS recording engineer Jim Reeves, which peaked at number 24 on April 29, 1972, and "[[Sealed With a Kiss]]" hitting number 19 on August 19â€“26, 1972.<ref name=Rogers/> Despite the success of the two hits, Epic Records decided to drop Vinton from his contract the following year, claiming that his days of selling records were over.

Undeterred, Vinton spent $50,000 of his own money on "[[My Melody of Love]]", partially self-written and partially sung in [[Polish language|Polish]].<ref name="Larkin"/> The suggestion for the song came from Vinton's mother.<ref name=Disks/><ref name=Rogers/> After six major labels turned Vinton down, [[ABC Records]] bought Vinton's idea, and the result was a multi-million-selling single of simple lyrics that hit number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 2 on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox Top 100]] chart, and number 1 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|AC]] chart in 1974.<ref name=Disks/><ref>Hyatt, Wesley (1999). ''The Billboard Book of number 1 Adult Contemporary Hits'' (Billboard Publications)</ref> A gold album, ''[[Melodies of Love]]'', followed as well as one final Top 40 pop hit (the traditional "[[Beer Barrel Polka]]", also sung partially in Polish, b/w "Dick And Jane" in 1975). Vinton would go on to record an additional four albums for ABC Records, three of which hit the Billboard Hot 200 albums chart. Epic Records rediscovered Vinton in the wake of his newfound success, releasing two albums of previously recorded material, both of which hit the top album charts. In addition, in a throwback to his career start in the 1950s, his two albums on Ahed were released in Canada. ''Party Music'' (1976) went platinum and ''100 memories'' (1979) was successful. In 1975, Vinton exploded onto televisions across the United States and Canada with a successful half-hour variety show, ''[[The Bobby Vinton Show]]'', which aired from 1975 to 1978 and of which "My Melody of Love" was the theme song; ABC Records subsequently released an album of songs performed on the show.<ref name=Performer>{{cite news |title=Vinton enjoys career as multi-talented performer |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_44_AAAAIBAJ&pg=5281,4487605&dq=stan+vinton&hl=en |newspaper=[[Portsmouth Daily Times]] |date=August 4, 1990 |access-date=May 2, 2011}}</ref>

In 1978, Vinton wrote his autobiography, titled ''The Polish Prince'', which became a bestseller. In the same year, CBS-TV aired ''Bobby Vinton's Rock N' Rollers'', a one-hour special that achieved top ratings.

===1980sâ€“1990s===
While appearing at [[Pittsburgh]]'s [[Three Rivers Stadium]] prior to Game 4 of the [[1990 National League Championship Series]] between the [[1990 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], Vinton delivered an off-key rendition of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". Controversy ensued after [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]] broadcaster [[Jack Buck]] said on air, "Well, when you're Polish and live in Pittsburgh, you can do anything you want with the words!"<ref>{{cite news |date=October 11, 1990 |title=Vinton, Buck Apologize for Wayward Words : Baseball: Singer flubbed national anthem and sportscaster's remarks angered Polish community. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-11/sports/sp-3218_1_national-anthem |work=Los Angeles Times |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017152917/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-11/sports/sp-3218_1_national-anthem |archive-date=October 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=October 11, 1990|title=Polish group takes broadcaster Buck to task|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4021189.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021031738/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4021189.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 21, 2012|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, Vinton found himself booked as a guest star at the Roy Clark Theatre in Branson, Missouri. He was unsure of his ability to draw at what was then a country-western-themed resort, and was shocked at the massive turnout for his concerts there. He was so impressed with the Branson model that he invested millions in building the Bobby Vinton Blue Velvet Theatre and enjoyed ten successful years there. In 2002 the theatre was sold to [[David King (theatre producer)|David King]], creator and producer of ''Spirit of the Dance''.<ref name=Slow>{{cite news |last=Rizzo |first=Marian |title=After 40 Years, Bobby Vinton Isn't Slowing |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IuJPAAAAIBAJ&pg=6288,3143543&dq=stan+vinton&hl=en |work=Ocala Star-Banner |date=March 22, 2002 |access-date=May 2, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Velvet/> Vinton returned to Branson periodically for limited engagements at the theatre.

''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' called Bobby Vinton "the all-time most successful love singer of the 'Rock-Era.'" From 1962 to 1972, Vinton had had more Billboard number 1 hits than any other male vocalist, including [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. In recognition of his recording career, Vinton was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], located at 6916 Hollywood Blvd.

Vinton's alma mater, [[Duquesne University]], awarded him an honorary doctorate in music in 1978.<ref name=Doctorate>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8DwyAAAAIBAJ&pg=4724,1867714&dq=stan+vinton&hl=en|title=Vinton gets a doctorate|date=October 10, 1978|publisher=Gettysburg Times|access-date=May 2, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Performer/>

In 2011, [[Grammy Award]] winner [[Jimmy Sturr and His Orchestra]] recorded the "Polish Prince" song, a tip of the hat to Vinton, and included it on their Grammy-nominated ''Not Just Another Polka'' CD.  The song was written by Johnny Prill and was based on the 1978 autobiography ''The Polish Prince â€“ Bobby Vinton''.

He was also cast as Jeff McCandles in the 1971 [[John Wayne]] film ''[[Big Jake]]'' and as Ben Young in another Wayne film, ''[[The Train Robbers]]'' (1973).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0899130/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1#Actor|title=Bobby Vinton|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|access-date=March 23, 2013}}</ref> His last screen appearance was as Bobby Gaines in the 1983 episode "Chance of a Lifetime" of the [[NBC]] family drama television series ''[[Boone (TV series)|Boone]]'', starring [[Barry Corbin]], [[Tom Byrd]], and [[Ronnie Claire Edwards]].
