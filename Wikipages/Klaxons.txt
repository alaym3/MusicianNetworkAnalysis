Their first single for the label, "[[Magick (Klaxons song)|Magick]]", was released on 30 October 2006 and reached #29 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40]] the following week.<ref name=occ>{{cite web|title=Klaxons - Full Official Chart History|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/2908/klaxons/|website=Official Charts Company|publisher=Official Charts Company|access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref>

In August 2006, Klaxons played at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading and Leeds]] festivals. Fans sounded "Klaxons!" and cheered loudly between songs while brandishing glowsticks. This gave credit to the "[[New Rave]]" label, coined by [[Angular Recording Corporation|Angular Records']] founder Joe Daniel; later used by ''NME'' magazine to describe the scene. Also in August, the Klaxons performed an acoustic set in Ibiza Weekend for UK's [[BBC Radio 1]] at [[Ibiza Rocks]] festival with Zane Lowe.

The first single from their debut album, "[[Golden Skans]]", was released on 22 January 2007.

Klaxons singled out a new song that has strong [[progressive rock]] influences as a guide to one possible direction the album may go in, revealed recently ''NME'' magazine. Guitarist Simon Taylor said, "We wanna make something that's bigger and softer and louder and lo-fi and heavier produced - just lots of contradictions. I think it's gonna be like the last record but swollen. We've been listening to a lot of European [[progressive rock|prog music]], and [[dubstep]], and dance and folk. A huge broad variety of things really. There's one track we've been playing in soundcheck, it's this massive prog opus."<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nme.com/news/klaxons/32816 |title=Klaxons shed light on their second album |journal=[[NME]] |date=28 November 2007 |access-date=24 May 2011}}</ref>

The band were described as "acid-rave sci-fi punk-funk" by the [[NME]] in Tim Chester's Radar feature and were at the forefront of the [[New Rave]] movement. Generally derided by critics, Jamie Reynolds explained New Rave as something that "started as an in-joke and became a minor youth subculture".<ref name="Guardian Interview">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/03/popandrock.culture |title=The future's bright... |last=Robinson |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Robinson (journalist) |date=3 February 2007 |access-date=23 May 2011 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name="Guardian article">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/oct/13/electronicmusic.popandrock |title=The new wave of old rubbish |last=Harris |first=John |author-link=John Harris (critic) |date=13 October 2006 |access-date=23 May 2011 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}</ref>
