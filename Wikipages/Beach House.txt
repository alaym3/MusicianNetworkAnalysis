==History==
===Formation and ''Beach House''===
Vocalist and organist [[Victoria Legrand]], who graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 2003, and guitarist [[Alex Scally]], who graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 2004, formed the band in 2004 after meeting in Baltimore's indie rock scene, producing music composed largely of organ, programmed drums, and steel guitar.<ref name=hotbandspin>{{cite web|last=Diehl|first=Matt|title=Hot Band: Beach House|date=February 26, 2010|url=https://www.spin.com/2010/02/hot-band-beach-house/|publisher=Spin.com|access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref> Of the origins of the band name Scally said: "We’d been writing music, and we had all these songs, and then there was that moment where you say ‘what do we call ourselves?’ We tried to intellectualize it, and it didn’t work. There were different plant-names, Wisteria, that kind of thing. Stupid stuff. But, once we stopped trying, it just came out, it just happened. And it just seemed perfect."<ref name=alexabout>{{cite web|last=Carew|first=Anthony|title=Interview: Alex Scally of Beach House|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/interviews/a/beachhouse.htm|publisher=About.com|access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref> In an interview with [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]], Legrand addressed their being a two-member status thus: "[I]t's a way to challenge ourselves: What do you do when it's just the two of you? ... [O]ne of the reasons this has been such a fulfilling experience for me is that with two people, it's so much easier to achieve things that feel exciting and new."<ref name=aboutprofile>{{cite web|title=Beach House - Artist Profile|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/artists/a/beachhouse.htm|work=About.com|publisher=About.com|access-date=September 29, 2012|author=Anthony Carew|year=2012}}</ref>

''[[Teen Dream]]'' was listed as  number 5 on [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'s Top 50 Albums of 2010 with the following notes:
:Teen Dream ''did little to alter Beach House's core characteristics---slow-motion beats layered with hazy keyboard drones, rippling guitar figures, and Victoria Legrand's melancholic melodies---but greatly amplified them to the point of redefining the band's essence, from that of introverted knee-gazers into an assured, emotionally assertive force.'' -- Stuart Berman<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7893-the-top-50-albums-of-2010/5/|title=Top 50 Albums of 2010|date=December 16, 2010|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=June 16, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110613041819/http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7893-the-top-50-albums-of-2010/5/| archive-date= June 13, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Of the success of the album and it being dubbed the group's "breakout" record by numerous publications, Legrand stated: "I see this as just another step in a direction. I would not want to say that 2010 will be our year, necessarily, I hope it’s just another year in which we do good work. I don’t want to be defined by this year, I want it to just be a beginning."<ref name=victoriaabout2>{{cite web|last=Carew|first=Anthony|title=Interview: Victoria Legrand of Beach House (page 2)|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/interviews/a/beach-house_2.htm|publisher=About.com|access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

Talking about the direction of the new album, the band said, "In general, this record shows a return to simplicity, with songs structured around a melody and a few instruments, with live drums playing a far lesser role. With the growing success of ''Teen Dream'' and ''Bloom'', the larger stages and bigger rooms naturally drove us towards a louder, more aggressive place; a place farther from our natural tendencies. Here, we continue to let ourselves evolve while fully ignoring the commercial context in which we exist."<ref>{{cite web|title=Beach House Announce New Album Depression Cherry and World Tour|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/57120-beach-house-announce-new-album-depression-cherry-and-world-tour/|work=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork|access-date=May 26, 2015|date=May 26, 2015}}</ref> "I think, this album continues to change meaning for me.

''[[7 (Beach House album)|7]]'' is the seventh studio album by Beach House, released on May 11, 2018, through [[Sub Pop]]. It follows the ''[[B-Sides and Rarities (Beach House album)|B-Sides and Rarities]]'' compilation album released in 2017, which served as a proverbial "cleaning out the closet" to pave the way for a new creative process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bellaunion.com/2018/03/beach-house-announce-new-album-7/|title="Beach House announce new album "7"". Bella Union. Retrieved March 7, 2018.}}</ref>

The album saw the group's departure from longtime producer [[Chris Coady]]. ''7'' was co-produced by Beach House and [[Peter Kember|Pete “Sonic Boom” Kember]]. His work with [[Spacemen 3]] and Spectrum impressed the band to reach out and see if he might like to co-produce the album with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1991894/beach-house-7-interview/franchises/interview/|title=''Beach House Are Loving Losing Life'' interview by Stereogum|last=Rettig|first=James|date=April 24, 2018}}</ref> The record also features drums from James Barone, the band's longtime live drummer.

Throughout the process of recording ''7'', the band's goal was rebirth and rejuvenation. They wanted to rethink old methods and shed some self-imposed limitations. In the past, they've often limited their writing to parts that they can perform live. On ''7'', they decided to follow whatever came naturally. As a result, there are some songs with no guitar, and some without keyboard. There are songs with layers and production that they could never recreate live, and that was exciting to them. Basically, letting creative moods, instead of instrumentation, dictate the album’s feel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/beach-house-releases-new-track-dive-announces-new-album-details/|title=''Beach House releases new track 'Dive,' announces new album details''|last=Weigel|first=Brandon|date=March 7, 2018|website=Baltimore Fishbowl}}</ref>

‘’This album felt really kinetic. We tend to make pretty still music, and this record felt like we were really excited by the kind of bubbling, chaotic, discordant energy field. … The vibe and the show are getting more energetic and messy, but in what I think is a cool way. Maybe a little bit more “rock and roll,” to use the old term,’’ adds Scally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arktimes.com/entertainment/ae-feature/2018/04/26/a-qa-with-alex-scally-of-beach-house?oid=17330839|title=''A Q&A with Alex Scally of Beach House''|last=Faull|first=Colton|date=April 26, 2018|website=Arkansas Times}}</ref>

== Musical style and influences ==
Although Beach House is most often referred to as a [[dream pop]] band, their musical style has changed throughout their discography. Earlier material heard on ''[[Beach House (album)|Beach House]]'', ''[[Devotion (Beach House album)|Devotion]]'', and  ''[[Teen Dream]]'' has been described as [[indie pop]] and [[lo-fi]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/music/reviews/beach-house-devotion-1200536132/|title = Beach House – 'Devotion'|date = March 3, 2008}}</ref> whilst later material heard on ''[[Bloom (Beach House album)|Bloom]]'', ''[[Depression Cherry]]'', ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (Beach House album)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'', and ''[[7 (Beach House album)|7]]'' has been described as [[neo-psychedelia]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesoundbinge.com/post/album-review-7-beach-house|title = Album Review: "7", Beach House|date = May 25, 2018}}</ref> [[Ambient music|ambient]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/08/album-review-beach-house-depression-cherry/|title = Album Review: Beach House - Depression Cherry|date = August 19, 2015}}</ref> and [[shoegazing]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/t-s-eliot-would-have-liked-beach-house |title=T.

Singer Victoria Legrand's vocals have often been compared to those of [[Nico]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r849574|pure_url=yes}}|title=Beach House – Review|work=Allmusic.com|access-date=October 18, 2009|author=Wilson, Mackenzie}}</ref> Some music outlets have also compared Legrand's vocals to 1980s psychedelic rock vocalist Kendra Smith of the band [[Opal (band)|Opal]]. Guitarist Alex Scally plays a [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar in an [[E♭ Tuning]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The group's influences include [[This Mortal Coil]], [[Cocteau Twins]], [[The Zombies]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[Françoise Hardy]], [[Neil Young]], [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]], [[Tony, Caro and John]] and [[Chris Bell (musician)|Chris Bell]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Beach House re-recorded the Tony, Caro and John song "Snowdon Song" and renamed it "Lovelier Girl". The song was released on the band's self-titled album with no attribution. Initially, Tony Dore of Tony, Caro and John stated, "I haven't seen much yet in terms of royalties or acknowledgement of authorship". Several months later, however, Dore disclosed that discussions had taken place to apply proper attribution on re-releases of the self-titled album.<ref>''[http://alteredzones.com/posts/479/tony-caro-and-john-snowdon-song/ Tony, Caro and John: The Snowdon Song] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509235453/http://alteredzones.com/posts/479/tony-caro-and-john-snowdon-song/ |date=May 9, 2012 }}'', November 5, 2010. Accessed July 2, 2012.</ref>

Legrand has described creating new music and releasing albums as a necessity for the band, saying, "When we decide that a record is finished, I think it's really about coming to terms with saying 'OK, I think we've done everything that we could do, and now it's time to let these things go.' Because if we hold onto them, we might destroy them or they might never come out. There are all different types of artists and I think that some people like to hold onto things and they get very perfectionistic. But perfectionism is kind of a synonym for destruction. It can really be a deterrent for one's evolution. Alex and I have always felt that putting records out is very necessary. It's a gut feeling we have."<ref>{{cite web |last=Gardner |first=Jeff |url=https://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/capturing-the-ether/Content?oid=18849757 |title=Capturing the Ether |work=[[Tucson Weekly]] |date=July 26, 2018 |access-date=August 29, 2018}}</ref>

Beach House is famous for its visual-heavy live shows that elevate their sound to a new level. Scally believes that playing live music is the best way to connect with fans.
