== Personal life ==
Leandro was born into a poor family. He composed rhymes and passed them to his friend to record and sell. His father died when Leandro was still a child, as told in the song "Ooorra ...".

== Name ==
The name Emicida is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[Emcee]]'' and ''[[homicide]]. ''Because of his frequent victories in the battles of improvisation, his friends began to say that Leandro was a "killer", who kills his opponents through rhymes. Later, the rapper turned it into an acronym for "Enquanto Minha Imaginação Compuser Insanidades, Domino a Arte" (rough translation, ''As long as my imagination composes insanities, I rule the art'').<ref name="v">{{cite web |url=http://revistatrip.uol.com.br/so-no-site/emicida-style.html |title=Só no site: Emicida style | publisher = Revista Trip |accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref>

== Career ==
Live performances are accompanied by the DJ instrumental in Nyack. The Emicida career began in the early 1990, where his parents organized '' black'' dances in the outskirts of São Paulo, and he began to use the equipment and write his first rhymes.<ref name="t">{{cite web |url=http://tramavirtual.uol.com.br/artistas/emicida |title=TramaVirtual |website=UOL |accessdate=2 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610025600/http://tramavirtual.uol.com.br/artistas/emicida |archivedate=10 June 2010 }}</ref>
