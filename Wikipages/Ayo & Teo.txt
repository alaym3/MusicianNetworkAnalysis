Their song "[[Rolex (song)|Rolex]]" peaked at number 20 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

== Early life ==
Ayleo Bowles (Ayo) was born on October 30, 1996, and Mateo Bowles (Teo) was born on August 29, 1999, in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Ayo, being the older of the two, began dancing at an early age, in which Teo soon joined in. The two never took official dance classes and were mostly self-taught.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

As well as dancing, the two became fascinated by music and Ayo taught himself how to play the piano, drums, and the trombone. After finishing high school, Ayo went on to attend Washtenaw Community College. The two uploaded their first YouTube video on November 6, 2014, of themselves dancing at their High School's talent show, which got more than 1 million views.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}
 

==Rise to fame==
American sibling duo Ayo & Teo scored a viral hit in 2017 with their single "Rolex." Born Ayleo and Mateo Bowles in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], the pair grew up with the sounds of [[Michael Jackson]], [[Usher (musician)|Usher]], [[Missy Elliot]], and [[Chris Brown]]. Their dance style suggests influence from the popular French dance duo known as [[Les Twins]]. They honed their dancing skills in elementary school, later establishing a popular social media page that issued viral dance challenges. "Rolex" happened to be one of these hits, eventually racking up over 619 million views on YouTube and storming the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Wearing their trademark bear facemasks, they issued their first single, "In Reverse," in 2016. They danced in Usher's video for "No Limit" and at the 2016 BET Awards, later signing with Columbia Records. "Lit Right Now" arrived in early 2017, but was soon eclipsed by the infectious anthem "Rolex," which echoed similar trap-influenced popular hits like [[Migos]]' "[[Bad and Boujee]]", [[Rae Sremmurd]]'s "[[Black Beatles]]", and [[DRAM (rapper)|DRAM]]'s "[[Broccoli (song)|Broccoli]]". In 2018, Ayo & Teo returned with the BLSSD-produced single "Hold My Sauce."{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}
