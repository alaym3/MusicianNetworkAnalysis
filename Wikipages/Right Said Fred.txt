== History ==
===1989–1991: Formation===
Prior to forming Right Said Fred, the Fairbrass brothers had been playing music since the mid 1970s: as part of a band called The Actors, the brothers had toured with [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] and supported [[Joy Division]] at the [[Factory Records#1978.E2.80.931979|Factory club]] in Manchester.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/04/how-we-made-right-said-fred-im-too-sexy-interview |title=How we made Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=4 April 2017 |website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref>

The Fairbrass brothers formed the group in 1989, with Richard on lead vocals and bass and Fred on guitar. Prior to forming the group, Richard was employed as a session bassist for artists including [[Boy George]], [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=guardian /> and [[David Bowie]], and appears as the bass guitarist in Bowie's short film ''[[Jazzin' for Blue Jean]]''.<ref>{{YouTube|DXvAaNcXNzI|Official David Bowie video}} showing Richard Fairbrass playing bass.</ref> In 1987, Fred appeared as a guitarist in the [[Bob Dylan]] vehicle ''[[Hearts of Fire]]''.<ref name=guardian />

The group was named after the novelty song "[[Right Said Fred (song)|Right Said Fred]]", which was a hit single for singer and actor [[Bernard Cribbins]] in 1962. The Fairbrass brothers were originally accompanied by drummer [[Ray Weston]] and guitarist Dan Kruse. Weston left in 1990 to join the progressive rock group [[Wishbone Ash]] and Kruse left the next year. Guitarist Rob Manzoli joined in 1990 and remained with the group until 1997.

===1991–1992: ''I’m Too Sexy'' and ''Up''===
In July 1991, the group released its debut single and best-known song, "[[I'm Too Sexy]]", on the independent London-based record label Tug Records (which saw its only real success with Right Said Fred's releases). The Fairbrass brothers have stated that the song's lyrics are centered on certain users of the gym they owned in London, who they claimed had no shame. "A lot of models used our gym, so we thought it was time to start poking [fun] at them," Fred stated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-09-ca-3255-story.html|title=POP MUSIC : Right Said Fred: A Model Trio|date=1992-02-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-06-18|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

It was a huge hit in the United Kingdom, spending six weeks at number two in the charts behind [[Bryan Adams]]' "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]", and three months in the Top 10. The song also went to number one in 32 countries including the United States where it topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.<ref>[[Fred Bronson|Bronson, Fred]] (2003).

Their second single, "[[Don't Talk Just Kiss]]", with background vocals by soul singer [[Jocelyn Brown]], was released in October 1991. It made number 3 in the United Kingdom Christmas charts, entered the top five in many countries, and reached number eight in the United States dance chart.<ref name="Whitburn"/>

In February 1992, the band released its third single, "[[Deeply Dippy]]". This was number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks, and peaked at number nine in the United States dance chart.<ref name="Whitburn"/>

The success of the singles resulted in the band's multi-platinum debut album, ''[[Up (Right Said Fred album)|Up]]'', reaching number one in the United Kingdom album charts as well as charting worldwide. The album remained in the Top 40 for almost a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/right%20said%20fred/|title=RIGHT SAID FRED|publisher=Officialcharts.com|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> In Germany a fifth single "Love For All Seasons" charted at # 65 in 1993.
