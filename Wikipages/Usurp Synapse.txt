'''Usurp Synapse''' was a [[screamo]] band from [[Lafayette, Indiana]]. The group combined fast and frantic [[grindcore]] influenced [[drum]]ming and  [[guitar]] work, and raw [[screaming (music)|screams]].

==History==
Usurp Synapse formed in 1998 in [[Lafayette, Indiana]].<ref name="Photos from 1999 [Archived]">{{cite web|title=Photos from 1999 [archived] |url=http://ellipsometer.rice.edu/stewarmp/thinking/usurp/usurp.htm |access-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030610043747/http://ellipsometer.rice.edu/stewarmp/thinking/usurp/usurp.htm |archive-date=June 10, 2003 }}</ref>  Their line up changed somewhat frequently during their initial run. Antonio Leiriao, their second vocalist, originally lived in New York<ref name="FMF"/> before he moved to Indiana in 1999 to join the group. Most of their music was released through [[split albums]] with other artists, perhaps their most famous split being their ''Just Do It!'' record with Hassan I Sabbah, which included razor blades. Unconventional marketing methods such as this was utilized by the band throughout their run.

In 2000, they toured the United States along with [[Jeromes Dream]], who they also released a split with, and [[Racebannon]] from May to June. This would become the only major nationwide tour for the band. In 2001, they announced plans to do another tour in the United States, Europe, and Japan over the summer. They also announced plans to release a split with [[Pg. 99]], an EP that would have only been obtainable by selling your soul away to the band, a split with Mara'akate shaped as Indiana,<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Kurt|title=AllMusic Guide Review Of Disinformation Fix|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/disinformation-fix-mw0000773682|website=Allmusic.com|publisher=AllMusic Guide}}</ref> and what would have been the band's first full-length album, which was under the working title of ''ATM Diatribe''. That same year Mike Dixon (who previously worked in the band Rep Seki) joined Usurp Synapse as the keyboardist.

Later that same year it was announced that all plans, except for ''ATM Diatribe'', had to be cancelled. ''ATM Diatribe'' was initially supposed to be released on [[compact disc]] and [[LP Record|vinyl]] through [[Happy Couples Never Last]], however that too was cancelled when the band broke up in the spring of 2001. The tracks from the ''ATM Diatribe'' sessions, along with the rest of the band's recorded discography, was eventually released on ''[[Disinformation Fix]]'', a discography compilation released through Alone Records.

In 2008, the group released ''A Vile Contamina'' through their Myspace page for free. The EP included material recorded during their reformative period.

Former members of the band would later join other projects such as Fax Arcana and The Drago Miette, both of whom are now disbanded. Antonio Leirao would move on to the [[indie rock]] band Thin Fevers<ref name="MFT">{{cite web|last1=n/a|title=Thin Fevers Biography|url=http://www.musicalfamilytree.com/band/thin_fevers|website=musicalfamilytree.com|publisher=Musical Family Tree|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> and is now a [[Funk (music)|funk]] [[DJ]].<ref name="FMF">{{cite web|last1=n/a|title=Big Ups with Antonio Leiriao|url=https://fleamarketfunk.com/2016/07/25/big-ups-with-antonio-leiriao/|website=fleamarketfunk.com|publisher=Flea Market Funk|access-date=2016-07-25}}</ref>  Chance now works as a session drummer in New York<ref name="Mike Dixon's blogspot page">{{cite web|title=Interview with Travis Chance|url=http://fullergoeasy.blogspot.com/2006/09/sugar-sugar-sugar-nahhhh.html|author=Micheal Dixon|access-date=October 16, 2015}}</ref> and was one of the many drummers who played in [[The Boredoms]] 2008 88 Boadrums event.<ref name="Rolling Stone Magazine">{{cite web|title=The Boredoms Revel in Rhythm, Numerology for 88 BoaDrums|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-boredoms-revel-in-rhythm-numerology-for-88-boadrums-20080811|author=Trent Moorman|access-date=October 16, 2015}}</ref>
