'''Zeus''' is a [[Toronto]]-based Canadian [[indie rock]] band signed to the [[Arts & Crafts (record label)|Arts & Crafts]] record label.  Its members include Rob Drake, Carlin Nicholson, Mike O'Brien, and Neil Quin. The band have released three albums and one EP since 2009.<ref name=":1" /> They have also served as the backing band for Canadian musician [[Jason Collett]].

==History==
O'Brien and Nicholson were childhood friends from [[Barrie]], [[Ontario]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Power of Zeus|url = https://nowtoronto.com/music/power-of-zeus/|website = Now Toronto|access-date = 2015-10-12|date = 15 October 2008|publisher = Now Communication Ltd.|first = Carla|last = Gillis}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Zeus on CBC Music|url = http://music.cbc.ca/#!/bands/Zeus|website = music.cbc.ca|access-date = 2015-10-12|publisher = CBC Radio Canada}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Zeus {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/zeus-mn0002381388/biography|website = allmusic.com|access-date = 2015-10-12|last = Lymangrover|first = Jason|publisher = All Media Network llc}}</ref> and played in one another's first bands along with [[Afie Jurvanen]]. When Jurvanen was recruited by producer [[Howie Beck]] to play guitar for [[Jason Collett]], Jurvanen brought along O'Brien and Nicholson, who had learned Collett's album ''Idols of Exile'' in its entirety before their audition. The band he brought to Collett, which called itself "Paso Mino" consisted of Jurvanen, Michael P. Clive, and current Zeus members O'Brien and Drake, with Nicholson commonly acting as sound technician. After several years performing behind Collett, as well as performing original material and releasing the album ''Good People'', Paso Mino dissolved when Michael P. Clive left the band to pursue a career as a professional chef, and Jurvanen began a new solo project under the name "[[Bahamas (musician)|Bahamas]]".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Carlin Nicholson talks about the Origin, Path, and Recording of Classic Zeus|url = http://nodepression.com/interview/carlin-nicholson-talks-about-origin-path-and-recording-classic-zeus|website = nodepression.com|date = 24 September 2014|access-date = 2015-10-12|publisher = Freshgrass, lcc|first = Luke C.|last = Bowden}}</ref>

O'Brien and Nicholson began recording together, joined for the original sessions by Dave Azzolini, Jess Grassia and Taylor Knox (The Golden Dogs). Their personal history went back to high school when they formed the band The 68's. Neil Quin (ex-The Golden Dogs) was soon added, completing the Zeus lineup.<ref name=":0" /> The members of Zeus continue as Collett's backing band.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Zeus|url = http://exclaim.ca/music/article/zeus|website = exclaim.ca|access-date = 2015-10-12|publisher = Exclaim!
