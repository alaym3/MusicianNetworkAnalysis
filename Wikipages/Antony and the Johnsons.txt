'''Antony and the Johnsons''' is an American music group presenting the work of [[Anohni]] and her collaborators.

==Career==
British [[Experimental music|experimental]] musician [[David Tibet]] of [[Current 93]] heard a demo and offered to release Anohni's music through his [[Durtro]] label. Anohni started the band, its name inspired by drag queen and activist [[Marsha P. Johnson]].<ref>"Marsha P. Johnson (1944–1992) Activist, Drag Mother." A Gender Variance Who's Who. May 2, 2009. Under Creative Commons License: Attribution</ref> The debut album, ''[[Antony and the Johnsons (album)|Antony and the Johnsons]]'', was released in 1998. In 2001, while still known as Antony Hegarty, Anohni/Hegarty released a short follow-up [[Extended play|EP]], ''I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy'', which, in addition to the title track, included a cover of "Mysteries of Love", a [[David Lynch]]/[[Angelo Badalamenti]] song and "Soft Black Stars", a [[Current 93]] cover.

Producer [[Hal Willner]] heard the EP and played it to [[Lou Reed]], who immediately recruited Hegarty for his project ''[[The Raven (Lou Reed album)|The Raven]]''. Now gaining more attention, Hegarty signed to U.S.-based record label [[Secretly Canadian]], and released another EP, ''The Lake'', with Lou Reed guest-performing on one of the tracks. Secretly Canadian also re-released Hegarty's debut album in the United States to wider distribution in 2004.

Anohni's second full-length album, 2005's ''[[I Am a Bird Now]]'', was greeted with positive reviews and significantly more mainstream attention. The album featured guest appearances by [[Lou Reed]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Boy George]], and [[Devendra Banhart]], and circled themes of duality and transformation. ''I Am a Bird Now'' featured arrangements by Maxim Moston and Julia Kent and was mixed by [[Doug Henderson (musician)|Doug Henderson]]. In September 2005 Antony and the Johnsons were awarded the [[Mercury Prize]]<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4217140.stm Antony and Johnsons win Mercury]". [[BBC]] News, September 7, 2005. Retrieved on October 25, 2008.</ref> for the best UK album of 2005. Rival Mercury nominees, and favorites for the prize, the [[Kaiser Chiefs]] suggested that Anohni got in on a technicality; despite the fact she was born in the United Kingdom she spent much of her time in the U.S.—although they later apologized for the suggestion that she wasn't a deserving winner.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

Thirteen women from New York City were presented in intimate live video portraits during the course of the concert.<ref>[http://artipedia.org/artsnews/exhibitions/2007/01/24/antony-and-the-johnsons-with-charles-atlas-european-tour-of-turning ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118143843/http://artipedia.org/artsnews/exhibitions/2007/01/24/antony-and-the-johnsons-with-charles-atlas-european-tour-of-turning |date=November 18, 2007 }}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the piece "fragile, life affirming, and truly wonderful (five stars)". ''[[Le Monde]]'' in Paris hailed ''TURNING'' as "Concert-manifeste transsexuel".

The 2007 film about [[Bob Dylan]], ''[[I'm Not There]]'', featured their cover of his song "[[Knockin' On Heaven's Door]]" on the [[I'm Not There (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] release.

The album was mixed by Bryce Goggin and included arrangements by [[Nico Muhly]].

Ann Powers wrote of ''The Crying Light'' for the LA Times online, "it's the most personal environmentalist statement possible, making an unforeseen connection between queer culture's identity politics and the green movement. As music, it's simply exquisite—more controlled and considered than anything Antony and the Johnsons have done and sure to linger in the minds of listeners."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/antony_and_the_johnsons/ | work=Los Angeles Times | title='Wretches and Jabberers' documentary on autism draws support (and music) from Scarlett Johansson, Anohni, Bob Weir, others [Updated]|access-date=December 19, 2014}}</ref>

After touring throughout North America and Europe in support of their new album, Antony and the Johnsons presented a unique staging of ''The Crying Light'' with the Manchester Camerata at the Manchester Opera House for the 2009 [[Manchester International Festival]]. The concert hall was transformed into a crystal cave filled with laser effects created by installation artist [[Chris Levine]]. Antony and the Johnsons went on to present concerts with symphonies across Europe in Summer 2009, including the Opera Orchestra of Lyon, the Metropole Orchestra, Roma Sinfonietta and the Montreux Jazz Festival Orchestra. At [[Salle Pleyel]] in Paris, Anohni appeared in a costume designed for her by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy.

After two sold-out concerts at the Sydney Opera House, Antony and the Johnsons ended their recent touring in February 2010 in Tokyo. Anohni, Johanna Constantine and William Basinski performed at the Sogetsu Hall with [[butoh]] master Yoshito Ohno, the son of the 103-year-old dancer [[Kazuo Ohno]], whose image graces the cover of The Crying Light.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://stereogum.com/275402/progress-report-antony-the-johnsons/franchises/progress-report |work=Stereogum | title=Progress Report | date=February 23, 2010}}</ref> Kazuo Ohno died in June of that year, and Anohni wrote an obituary for the dancer in ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jun/07/kazuo-ohno-obituary |work=The Guardian | title=Kazuo Ohno Obituary | date=June 7, 2010}}</ref>

In interviews around the world in 2010, Anohni described her work on ''Swanlights'' and ''The Crying Light'' as "a collision between joy and a sense of hopelessness". Anohni said she was struggling to come to terms with the idea that she was part of a society that was having a "virulent" impact on the earth.<ref name="Antony and the Johnsons">{{Cite news| url=http://www.vogue.it/en/people-are-talking-about/music-theatre-cinema/2010/10/antony-and-the-johnsons-swanlights | work=Vogue Italy | title=Antony and the Johnsons | date=October 27, 2010}}</ref> She suggested that the degradation of nature was partially a result of the subjugation of women and earth-based spiritual systems.<ref name="Antony and the Johnsons"/> Anohni also blamed the collapse of humanity's sustainable relationship with the earth in part on the rise of patriarchal religions that suggest the destiny of humanity to be "a paradise elsewhere". ''Interview Magazine'' describes ''Swanlights'' as "an emotional personal call for global, collective change".<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/blogs/music/2010-11-02/antony-swanlights-lincoln-center/ | work=Interview Magazine | title=Antony Sees the Swanlight | date=November 2, 2010}}</ref>

Antony and the Johnsons released a 4th album ''[[Swanlights]]'' on October 12, 2010 through [[Secretly Canadian]] and [[Rough Trade Records]]. Simultaneously, [[Abrams Books]] published a book edition of ''Swanlights'' featuring Anohni's drawings and collages with photography by Don Felix Cervantes. Antony and the Johnsons performed "Thank You For Your Love" on both the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' in support of the album's release. In October 2010 Anohni was invited to "takeover" ''The Guardian''{{'}}s music and arts page that ran for weeks leading up to the release of Swanlights.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/series/antony-and-the-johnsons-takeover | work=The Guardian | title=Antony and the Johnsons Takeover | date=October 11, 2010}}</ref> Stereogum placed ''[[Swanlights]]'' in its Top 50 Albums of the year at #8.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://stereogum.com/593442/stereogums-top-50-albums-of-2010/franchises/listomania/ | work=Stereogum | title=2010 Top 50 Albums | date=December 8, 2010}}</ref>

In tribute to Kazuo Ohno, Antony and the Johnsons performed on October 30, 2010 at [[Lincoln Center]]'s Avery Fisher Hall with the [[Orchestra of St. Luke's]] and featured the film "Mr. O's Book of the Dead" directed by Chiaki Nagano and starring [[Kazuo Ohno]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/arts/music/01antony.html?_r=2&scp=1&sq=Antony&st=cse | work=New York Times | title=Fluid Voice With a Fluid Persona Firmly Attached | date=October 31, 2010}}</ref>

In January 2011, Anohni was a guest on ''Winterguest'', a program on Dutch Television's VPRO channel and was interviewed by Leon Verdonschot.

In 2010–2011, the song "Her Eyes Are Underneath The Ground" from the album ''The Crying Light'' was chosen as one of the five stimuli that the International Baccalaureate Organization chose for the IB Theatre Arts PPP.

On January 26, 2012, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York produced a sold-out performance by Antony and the Johnsons, entitled "Swanlights" after their fourth studio album, at [[Radio City Music Hall]], a collaboration with laser artist Chris Levine and set designer Carl Robertshaw. The event was prefaced by a speech from Dr. Julia Yasuda, who said: "I am concerned about nature changing and dying. Won't you please help her? Otherwise the world will be too lonely". ''The New York Times'' described the concert as "Cries From the Heart, Crashing Like Waves".<ref>{{cite news |title=Cries from the heart, crashing like waves |first=Jon |last=Pareles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/28/arts/music/antony-and-the-johnsons-at-radio-city-music-hall.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 27, 2012 |access-date=February 19, 2012}}</ref> This collaboration was later staged at the Royal Opera House in London in 2013 for two days<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/26/antony-and-the-johnsons-review|title=Antony and the Johnsons – review|author=Betty Clarke|work=the Guardian|date=July 26, 2013|access-date=December 19, 2014}}</ref> and at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid in 2014 for four consecutive days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teatro-real.com/es/noticias/detalle/antony-and-the-johnsons-amplia-su-presencia-en-el-teatro-real-con-un-concierto-extraordinario |title=Antony and The Johnsons amplía su presencia en el Teatro Real con un concierto extraordinario |publisher=Teatro-real.com |access-date=June 18, 2015}}</ref>

Antony and the Johnsons released a live symphonic album in August 2012 entitled ''[[Cut the World]]''; it features a track called "Future Feminism", which consists of a speech in which Anohni disparages patriarchal religions and advocates for a shift towards feminine systems of governance as part of an effort to avert global ecological disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/46560-antony-and-the-johnsons-announce-live-album/ |title=Antony and the Johnsons Announce Live Album &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=May 18, 2012 |access-date=September 8, 2012}}</ref>

On February 23, 2015, Anohni announced through her Facebook and official site the name of her new album, HOPELESSNESS, although no release date was provided. The album is being mixed and is co-produced by [[Hudson Mohawke]], [[Oneohtrix Point Never]] and herself. It would be released under the moniker ANOHNI. It was described as an "electronic record with some sharp teeth".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antonyandthejohnsons.com/news/news.html |title=Antony and the Johnsons news |publisher=Antonyandthejohnsons.com |access-date=June 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114125237/http://antonyandthejohnsons.com/news/news.html |archive-date=January 14, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
