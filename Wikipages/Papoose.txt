'''Papoose''' (from the [[Algonquin language|Algonquian]] ''papoose'', meaning "child") is an American English word whose present meaning is "a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] child" (regardless of [[tribe]]) or, even more generally, any child, usually used as a term of endearment, often in the context of the child's mother. <ref>{{Cite web|title= papoose |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/papoose|website= merriam-webster.com |language= en | access-date=2021-01-26 }}</ref> However, the word is considered offensive to many Native Americans whose tribes did not use the word. The word had early use in English in bounty notices in New England.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Reading Racism: Or, How Iâ€™m Learning to Wrestle with "Little House on the Prairie"|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/jmnoonan/blog/reading-racism-or-how-i%E2%80%99m-learning-wrestle-little-house-prairie|access-date=2021-09-20|website=scholar.harvard.edu|language=en}}</ref> The dehumanizing nature of the term papoose to describe Native American babies is comparable to use of "[[pickaninny]]" to describe black children, although word is less widely understood as pejorative.

The word came originally from the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] tribe. In 1643, [[Roger Williams]] recorded the word in his ''[[A Key Into the Language of America]],'' helping to popularize it.<ref>{{cite web| title= papoose (or pappoose)| website= Dictionary.com |volume= Unabridged (v 1.1)| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Papoose| date= | publisher= Reference.com | access-date= December 5, 2008}}</ref>
