'''Jodeci''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ|d|ə|s|i}} {{respell|JOH|də|see}}) is an [[Americans|American]] [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[quartet]] with members [[DeVanté Swing]], [[Dalvin DeGrate|Mr. Dalvin]], [[K-Ci (singer)|K-Ci]], and [[K-Ci and JoJo|JoJo]].  Formed in 1989 in [[Charlotte]], North Carolina, Jodeci's members began their musical careers as two duos of brothers and, after years of limited success, joined forces.  After signing with [[Uptown Records]] in 1991, the group began to work on their debut album, ''[[Forever My Lady]]'', which brought them mainstream success with the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] single "[[Come and Talk to Me]]" and [[Forever My Lady (song)|the album's titular track]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Aliya|title=Mca's k-ci & jojo get...|journal=Billboard Magazine|date=5 June 1999|volume=111|issue=23|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ0EAAAAMBAJ&q=jodeci|access-date=28 February 2015|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

The group's critical and commercial success continued with the releases of ''[[Diary of a Mad Band]]'' (1993), and also with ''[[The Show, the After Party, the Hotel]]'' (1995), where the group experimented with various musical styles typically not associated with traditional R&B. Jodeci would incorporate [[hip hop soul]], [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[new jack swing]] into their music, which led to the group featured prominently with [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Aliya|title=Mca's k-ci & jojo get...|journal=Billboard Magazine|date=5 June 1999|volume=111|issue=23|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ0EAAAAMBAJ&q=jodeci|access-date=28 February 2015|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Each album released by the group during this period attained [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and helped to redefine the genre, allowing for developments in thematic and musical content within R&B.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video: jodeci - 'every moment'|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2015/02/25/video-jodeci-every-moment/|website=rap-up.com|access-date=26 February 2015|quote=The Bad Boys of R&B are back.}}</ref>

In 1996, they announced a hiatus - though continuing to work on music as a group - which prompted [[K-Ci & JoJo]] to branch off as a duo, releasing five albums until 2013,<ref>{{cite journal|title=K-ci and jojo hailey enjoy...|journal=Jet Magazine|date=24 November 1997|volume=93|issue=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMQDAAAAMBAJ&q=k-ci+and+jojo&pg=PA57|access-date=28 February 2015|issn=0021-5996|last1=Company|first1=Johnson Publishing}}</ref> when the group re-united for their fourth studio album, ''[[The Past, the Present, the Future (Jodeci album)|The Past, the Present, the Future]]'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ni'Kesia|title=Jodeci reveals details about new album, teases 'every moment' video|url=http://www.thisisrnb.com/tag/jodeci/|website=thisisrnb.com|access-date=25 February 2015|date=24 February 2015|quote=The original Bad Boys of R&B are back!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Rea|title=Jodeci releases teaser for 'every video + new album moment'|url=http://allhiphop.com/2015/02/24/jodeci-releases-teaser-for-every-moment-video-new-album/|website=allhiphop.com|access-date=25 February 2015|date=24 February 2015|quote=The Bad Boys of R&B aka iconic R&B group Jodeci}}</ref> Jodeci has sold more than 20 million records worldwide to date.<ref>{{cite web|author1=THEBOOMBOX.COM|title=K-ci, jojo reminisce on jodeci, 'bad boys of r&b' title|url=http://www.watchinga.com/article?u=http%253a%252f%252ftheboombox.com%252fk-ci-jojo-jodeci-bad-boys-of-r-and-b%252f|website=watchinga.com|access-date=25 February 2015|quote=During their Jodeci days, K-Ci?and?JoJo were far removed from the Disney set.

==History==

===1983&ndash;1991: Early beginnings and formation===
Raised in extremely religious [[Pentecostal]] families, K-Ci and JoJo - then known as [[Little Cedric|Little Cedric & the Hailey Singers]] - originally performed and recorded as a [[gospel music|gospel]] group, releasing three albums; ''Jesus Saves'', ''I'm Alright Now'', and ''God's Blessings''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Albums|url=https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=n%3A163856011%2Ck%3ALittle%20Cedric%20And%20The%20Hailey%20Singers|website=amazon.com|access-date=2 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Darden|first1=B|title=Gospel lectern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCQEAAAAMBAJ&q=Little+Cedric+and+the+Hailey+Singers+billboard&pg=PA46|website=books.google.com|access-date=1 March 2015|date=3 November 1984}}</ref> K-Ci would later draw comparisons to [[Michael Jackson]] during his gospel career.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=D|title=Tuff love|journal=Vibe Magazine|date=August 1995|volume=3|issue=6|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCwEAAAAMBAJ&q=Little+Cedric+and+the+Hailey+Singers&pg=PA67|access-date=2 March 2015|quote=Folks down South...}}</ref>  Separately, Mr. Dalvin and DeVanté Swing performed and toured in their own family's gospel group, where the duos later made acquaintances through relationships the members were in at the time. In a 2011 interview, Dalvin stated, "there was this girl gospel group called UNITY and then the Don DeGrate Delegation, which Devanté and I played in. So we met some of the girls from UNITY and [one] was dating K-Ci before we even met [and she] would always tell us that we need to meet K-Ci and JoJo."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=C.|title=Dalvin degrate recalls...|url=http://soulculture.com/features/interviews/dalvin-degrate-recalls-making-jodecis-1991-album-forever-my-lady-return-to-the-classics/|website=soulculture.com|access-date=4 March 2015|date=1 Nov 2011|quote=there was this girl gospel group called UNITY...}}</ref> A short time after meeting, the brothers started living together after leaving their families to pursue musical careers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.myhot1065.com/lsp/a238/#__federated=1|website=www.myhot1065.com|access-date=2 March 2015}}</ref>

At 16, DeVanté Swing traveled to [[Minneapolis]], hoping to visit [[Paisley Park Records|Paisley Park Studios]] in order to audition to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bogdanov|first1=Val|title=All Music Guide to Soul|date=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|page=368|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o552g5xRRiwC&q=DeVante+ran+away|access-date=2 March 2015|isbn=9780879307448}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=About jodeci|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/jodeci/biography/|website=mtv.com|access-date=2 March 2015}}</ref> Swing would later say, "I was up at Paisley Park every day begging for a job, asking people to listen to my tape. The receptionist kept saying she couldn't help me".<ref>{{cite web|last1=S|first1=Danyel|title=Tuff love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCwEAAAAMBAJ&q=Little+Cedric+and+the+Hailey+Singers&pg=PA67|via=Google Books|work=Vibe magazine|access-date=2 March 2015|date=1 August 1995|quote=I was up at Paisly Park...}}</ref> The rejection motivated Swing to relocate back to North Carolina, and work to improve his songwriting and production skills.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=D.|title=Tuff love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCwEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22prince%22+%22jodeci%22&pg=PA67|website=books.google.com/|publisher=Vibe Media Group|access-date=2 March 2015|date=Aug 1995|quote="...So I took my ass..."}}</ref> Upon arriving, Swing continued to record with the group's additional members, eventually forming Jodeci, and began work on a demo tape to present to label executives. The name Jodeci is an abbreviation of all the members names. "Jo" comes from JoJo, "De" comes from the last name of the DeGrate brothers, and Ci comes from K-Ci.

The members soon drove to [[New York City]] with a 29-song, 3 tape demo, anticipating a signing deal with upstart [[Uptown Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whitlock|first1=Jason|title=Music|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-04-10/entertainment/9204101023_1_degrate-dalvin-hailey|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=2 March 2015|date=10 April 1992}}</ref> Upon arriving to New York, and without the knowledge of the whereabouts of the [[MCA Records|MCA]] subsidiary, the group used a phone book to find the company's address, located on Clinton Street in [[Brooklyn]]. Swing later commented on the signing, "we didn't have an appointment but I knew what Uptown was, and I wanted us to be there."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Jones|first1=J.|title=Sean "diddy" combs|date=1 January 2014|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR-WAgAAQBAJ&q=jodeci%22&pg=PA31|access-date=2 March 2015|publisher=Enslow Publishers, Inc.|quote=We didn't have an appointment...|isbn=9780766042964}}</ref> The group was quickly denied an audition until [[Andre Harrell]] agreed to hear the demo.<ref>Harrell is an executive many have credited with reenergizing r&b with hip-hop textures in the 1990s, e.g. Barry Michael Cooper, Kira Wakeam, and Tinbete Ermyas, "‘ He Revived R&B': The Legacy of Andre Harrell and Uptown Records", ''NPR'' (12 May 2020); available online at https://vocalo.org/andreharrelllegacy/</ref> In skepticism of the high quality production, Harrell requested the group to perform, where they performed "[[Come and Talk to Me]]" and "[[I'm Still Waiting (Jodeci song)|I'm Still Waiting]]",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Chris|title=Dalvin degrate recalls making...|url=http://soulculture.com/features/interviews/dalvin-degrate-recalls-making-jodecis-1991-album-forever-my-lady-return-to-the-classics/|website=soulculture.com|publisher=SoulCulture|access-date=2 March 2015|date=1 Nov 2011|quote=We sung 'Come and...}}</ref> in the presence of [[Jeff Redd]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=M.|title=K-ci & jojo talk the history of a mad band|url=http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/k-ci-jojo-talk-the-history-of-jodeci-interview-111#axzz3TF9HtL40|work=Ebony|access-date=2 March 2015|date=18 September 2013|quote="We went to the office...}}</ref> [[Hip hop]] artist [[Heavy D]] overheard the performance and consulted Harrell,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Lazerine, D|author2=Lazerine, C|title=The Ultimate Guide to Hip-Hop and R&B|date=29 Feb 2008|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5Y7-DTbSMcC&q=jodeci+%22heavy+D%22&pg=PT197|access-date=2 March 2015|isbn=9780446511629}}</ref> eventually taking the group out to dinner and awarding them a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=C.|title=Dalvin DeGrate recalls...|url=http://soulculture.com/features/interviews/dalvin-degrate-recalls-making-jodecis-1991-album-forever-my-lady-return-to-the-classics/|website=soulculture.com|publisher=Soul Culture|access-date=2 March 2015|date=1 November 2011|quote=The next thing we knew...}}</ref>

Jodeci was assigned to Uptown intern [[Sean Combs]], who took on the task of developing the new act. Counteracting the refined styles prominent in R&B showcased by [[Milli Vanilli|New Edition]] and [[Boyz II Men]], Mr. Dalvin created the group's image. Combs helped get the image through to Andre Harrell,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Charnas|first1=D.|title=The big payback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idYFcmXcRm4C&q=andre+harrell%22+%22heavy+d%22&pg=PT386|publisher=Penguin|access-date=2 March 2015|date=1 November 2011|quote=""Dress Jodeci the same..."|isbn=9781101568118}}</ref> perpetuating hip-hop fashion, such as baseball caps and [[The Timberland Company|Timberland boots]], to the group in order to establish a different aesthetic in the genre.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ro|first1=Ronin|title=Bad boy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frt_Py4XUvwC&q=andre+harrell+jodeci&pg=PA16|publisher=Simon and Schuster|access-date=2 March 2015|date=2 Feb 2002|isbn=9780743434171}}</ref> The group was introduced after providing background vocals on the song "[[Treat Them Like They Want to Be Treated]]", and performed live on ''[[Soul Train]]'' on June 11, 1991.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inductee jodeci|url=http://northcarolinamusichalloffame.org/inductee-jodeci/|website=northcarolinamusichalloffame.org|access-date=2 March 2015|date=5 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100750/http://northcarolinamusichalloffame.org/inductee-jodeci/|archive-date=6 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===1990&ndash;1995: ''Forever My Lady'', ''Diary of a Mad Band'', and ''The Show, the After Party, the Hotel''===
Landing a recording deal in 1991, the group released their debut album ''[[Forever My Lady]]'' that same year. Writer [[Ronin Ro]] maintained, ''"They no longer resembled gospel singers… [[Sean Combs|Puffy]] also asked them to build their mystique by posing for photos with their backs to the camera, which he borrowed from [[Guy (band)|Guy's]] stage show."''<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ro|first1=R.|title=Bad boy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frt_Py4XUvwC&q=%22forever+my+lady%22+jodeci&pg=PA17|publisher=Simon and Schuster|access-date=3 March 2015|date=2 Feb 2002|quote=They no longer resembled...|isbn=9780743434171}}</ref> The album's seductive energy showcased DeVanté's songwriting, establishing a uniqueness in his production that mixed old-fashioned soul singing with New Jack Swing, creating a production of great boldness. It featured the number 1 R&B singles "Forever My Lady," "Stay," and "Come and Talk to Me." Mr. Dalvin recalls how the album ''Forever My Lady'' was created, ''"The last version of the album that was released only took us a week to finish because we had already written the songs. It was about getting our sounds right because the vocals were already done. It was us going back in the studio recreating the beats and the melodies... Most of the songs were written before we left North Carolina. My brother was 16 and I was 14 when we wrote the songs..."''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Willians|first1=C.|title=Dalvin DeGrate recalls making...|url=http://soulculture.com/features/interviews/dalvin-degrate-recalls-making-jodecis-1991-album-forever-my-lady-return-to-the-classics/|website=soulculture.com|access-date=4 March 2015|date=1 November 2011|quote=The last version of the album that was released...}}</ref> The album went on to sell over three million copies.

In 1993, a minor feud resulted over the band's second album, ''[[Diary of a Mad Band]]''; Jodeci, unhappy with their treatment by Uptown, flirted with the idea of leaving for [[Death Row Records]], which resulted in almost zero promotion for the album.  Reaching number 3 on the [[Billboard 200]] and number-one on the R&B album chart, where it stayed for two weeks, spawning the #1 R&B hit "[[Cry for You (Jodeci song)|Cry for You]]"; "[[Feenin']]" and "[[What About Us (Jodeci song)|What About Us]]", ''Diary of a Mad Band'' eventually went [[double platinum]].

Jodeci's third album, ''[[The Show, the After Party, the Hotel]]'', was released in July 1995, reaching the second spot on the [[Billboard 200]] making it the group's highest peaking release and topping the U.S. R&B Albums chart. By September 1995, it was certified platinum in sales by the [[RIAA]], after sales exceeding one million copies in the [[United States]]. The album contained the [[Top 40]] hits "[[Freek'n You]]", "[[Love U 4 Life]]" and "[[Get on Up (Jodeci song)|Get on Up]]".

===2014&ndash;present: Return and ''The Past, the Present, the Future''===

In February 2014, [[Timbaland]] revealed that he was in the process of working with Jodeci on their comeback album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/timbaland-is-working-on-a-new-jodeci-album-news.9181.html|title=Timbaland Is Working On A New Jodeci Album}}</ref>

On November 7, 2014, Jodeci reunited and performed a medley of their classic songs at the 2014 Soul Train Awards. The performance also included a snippet of a brand-new single titled "Nobody Wins," which was released on December 22, 2014. The song is the first single released by Jodeci in over 18 years. The last song released by the group was "Get on Up", in 1996. Prior to the performance, the group had not taken the stage together in the U.S. since 2006.

On January 28, 2015, a second single titled "Every Moment" was released.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jodeci Debuts New Single "Every Moment"|url=http://www.epicrecords.com/news/jodeci-debuts-new-single-every-moment|website=epicrecords.com|publisher=Epic Records|access-date=2015-01-31|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206161107/http://www.epicrecords.com/news/jodeci-debuts-new-single-every-moment|archive-date=2015-02-06}}</ref> Also in that same month, it was announced by [[Epic Records]] that Jodeci had been signed to the label to release their new album.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bristout|first1=Ralph|title=Jodeci Signs To Epic Records, Preps New Album|url=http://revolt.tv/news/jodeci-signs-to-epic-records-preps-new-album/53571322-2F9E-4521-92AE-06B384595888|website=revolt.tv|publisher=Revolt Television|access-date=2015-01-31}}</ref> Timbaland, who recently brought his [[Mosley Music Group]] over to Epic, will work on the album. Their fourth album, ''[[The Past, the Present, the Future (Jodeci album)|The Past, the Present, the Future]]'', was released on March 31, 2015. It was their first album in 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jean Baptiste, Jr.|first1=Renaud|title=Jodeci's New Single "Every Moment" Proves Their Reunion Was Worth The 20 Year Wait|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2015-01-29/jodecis-reunion-every-moment/|website=vh1.com|publisher=VH-1|access-date=2015-01-31}}</ref>

Shortly after the album's release, a Jodeci reunion tour was announced. The first show took place on June 6, 2015 in [[Richmond, Virginia]], as a part of the city's 11th annual Stone Soul Music Festival.  Jodeci headlined the event, marking the group's first official concert performance together in the United States since 1995.

Jodeci was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

==Legacy and influence==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
Most of the elements that were eventually combined to form what became known as the "Jodeci style" originated with the work of new jack swing pioneers [[Keith Sweat]] and [[Teddy Riley (new jack swing)|Teddy Riley]], with an important influence being the work of Riley's three-man group [[Guy (music group)|Guy]]. Other influences include the works of [[Bobby Womack]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The Temptations]], [[Bobby Brown]], 
and [[New Edition]]. The group's cover of Stevie Wonder's 1981 song "[[Lately (Stevie Wonder song)|Lately]]", became their biggest pop hit to date, peaking at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in August 1993.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Danyel|title=Tuff love|journal=Vibe|date=August 1995|volume=3|issue=6|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCwEAAAAMBAJ&q=jodeci+lately&pg=PA72|access-date=26 February 2015|issn=1070-4701|quote=Only a song not written by DeVanté-the group's cover of Stevie Wonder's "Lately"-ever made the Top 10 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bronson|first1=Fred|title=Charts proclaim scot duo's comeback|journal=Billboard|date=12 June 1993|volume=105|issue=24|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9A8EAAAAMBAJ&q=jodeci&pg=RA1-PA88|access-date=26 February 2015|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

Artists and producers heavily influenced by Jodeci were those were directly or indirectly associated with them, including [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Dru Hill]],  [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] and a number of the members of DeVanté's Swing Mob collective who he discovered and nurtured: [[Missy Elliott]], [[Timbaland]], Nealante, [[Magoo (rapper)|Magoo]], [[Ginuwine]], [[Stevie J]], [[Playa (band)|Playa]] (who R&B singer & songwriter [[Static Major]] was a part of) with [[Smoke E. Digglera]], Suga (who R&B act [[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]] was a part of), and Darryl Pearson.

To date, Jodeci remains well respected and revered among most hip-hop circles for their street-flavored sound and urban appeal.  The group has been mentioned and sampled in songs by a number of hip-hop artists including [[Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Twista]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Insane Clown Posse]], [[Big K.R.I.T.]], [[David Banner]], Bump J, [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], [[Freddie Gibbs]], [[Bun B]], [[Tyga]], [[CyHi the Prynce]], [[Young Thug]], [[Bryson Tiller]] and most notably [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], who, along with [[J. Cole]] released a song titled "Jodeci Freestyle" in June 2013.  The song pays homage to the group and samples "4 U", an interlude from ''[[The Show, the After Party, the Hotel]]''.  On October 19, 2014, a Drake song titled "How About Now" leaked to the internet.  The song samples Jodeci's "My Heart Belongs To U", and was later released in 2015 as a bonus track on the physical release of Drake's album/mixtape ''[[If You're Reading This It's Too Late]]''.
