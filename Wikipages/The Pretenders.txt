'''Pretenders''' are a British–American rock band formed in March 1978. The original band consisted of founder and main songwriter [[Chrissie Hynde]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), [[James Honeyman-Scott]] (lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), [[Pete Farndon]] (bass guitar, backing vocals), and [[Martin Chambers]] (drums, backing vocals, percussion). Following the deaths of Honeyman-Scott in 1982 and Farndon in 1983, the band experienced numerous personnel changes; Hynde has been the band's only consistent member.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/a5d79c54-81c3-4a73-af6a-ad5c143d3f21|title=Chrissie Hynde - New Songs, Playlists & Latest News - BBC Music|website=BBC}}</ref>

===Background===
Hynde, originally from [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], Ohio, moved to London in 1973, working at the weekly music paper ''[[NME]]''<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

She was involved with early versions of [[the Clash]] and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] and played in short-lived bands such as [[Masters of the Backside]] (1976) and [[the Moors Murderers]] (1978 lineup).<ref>Peter Buckley, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haEfq-nKqjgC&q=Pretenders+stop+your+sobbing&pg=RA2-PA1-IA114 |title=The Rough Guide to Rock |page=813 |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2003 |isbn=1-84353-105-4 |access-date=8 November 2009}}</ref> Pretenders formed in 1978 after Dave Hill at Anchor Records heard some [[Demo (music)|demos]] of Hynde's music. He arranged a rehearsal studio in [[Denmark Street]], London, where a three-piece band consisting of Hynde, Mal Hart on bass (he had played with Hynde and [[Steve Strange]] in the Moors Murderers), and [[Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor|Phil Taylor]]<ref>Miles,{{cite book |title=The Pretenders by Miles |page=20|publisher=Omnibus Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-86001-802-4}}</ref> of [[Motörhead]] on drums played a selection of Hynde's original songs. Dave Hill was impressed and arranged a day at Studio 51 to record another demo. Although it was rough, he felt he had seen and heard enough "star potential" to suggest that Hynde form a more permanent band to record for his new label, Real Records.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Hynde then formed a band composed of Pete Farndon on bass, James Honeyman-Scott on guitar, and Gerry Mcilduff on drums. This band, then without a name, recorded five tracks at Regents Park Studio in July 1978, including "Stop Your Sobbing". Shortly thereafter, Gerry Mcilduff was replaced on drums by Martin Chambers. Hynde named the band "Pretenders" after [[the Platters]] song "[[The Great Pretender]]",<ref>Deanna R. Adams, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBCZvsVKomwC&pg=PA396 |title=Rock 'n' roll and the Cleveland connection |page=396 |publisher=Kent State University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-87338-691-4 |access-date=8 November 2009}}</ref> which was the favourite song of one of her former boyfriends.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hynde|first1=Chrissie|title=Reckless|date=2015|publisher=Ebury Press|isbn=9781785031441|page=242}}</ref>

===Original band (1978–1982)===
The band's first single, a cover of [[the Kinks]] song "[[Stop Your Sobbing]]" (produced by [[Nick Lowe]] and recorded at the July Regents Park sessions) was released in January 1979 and gained critical attention.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> It was followed by "Kid" in June 1979. In January 1980, the band reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK with "Brass in Pocket", which was also successful in the US, reaching No.&nbsp;14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> 

[[File:Pretenders Dec 81.JPG|thumb|left|The Pretenders (original line-up), Dominion Theatre, London, December 1981]]
Their [[Pretenders (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in January 1980 and was a success in the United Kingdom and the United States both critically and commercially.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Produced by [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]], it is regarded as one of the best debut albums of all time,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-best-debut-albums-of-all-time-143608/|title=100 Best Debut Albums of All Time|date=2013-03-22|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> and has been named one of the best albums of all time by [[VH1]] (no. 52){{citation needed|date=July 2019}} and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (no. 155).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/the-pretenders-pretenders-159934/|year=2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone's definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| work=[[Rolling Stone]]| access-date= September 18, 2019}}</ref> 

During March 1981, the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Extended Play (The Pretenders EP)|Extended Play]]'' was released, containing the UK and US success "Message of Love" and "Talk of the Town", "Porcelain", "Cuban Slide" and a live version of "[[Precious (Pretenders song)|Precious]]", recorded in [[Central Park]], New York City.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

The second full-length album, ''[[Pretenders II]]'', was released during August 1981. ''Pretenders II'' included the ''Extended Play'' singles, the [[MTV]] video success "Day After Day", and popular [[album oriented rock|album-radio]] tracks "The Adultress", "Birds of Paradise", "Bad Boys Get Spanked", and "The English Roses".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Chris Thomas was once again at the helm for all recordings.

On 18 September 1981, Pretenders were the musical guest on the US late night sketch comedy show [[Fridays (TV series)|''Fridays'']]. The band performed "The Adultress", "Message of Love" and "Louie, Louie". [[Andy Kaufman]] was the guest host of the program on that night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/videos/interviews/6693016/chrissie-hynde-tig-notaro-interview-the-pretenders-memoir-aging-regret-exclusive|title=Superfan Tig Notaro Interviews Chrissie Hynde About Her 'F--- Off' Attitude, Aging and Regret: Exclusive|website=Billboard|access-date=25 June 2016}}</ref> In the Autumn of 1981, The Pretenders cancelled their US+Canada Tour as Chambers had cut his hand, and the injury was so bad that he could not play for a number of weeks. The band decided to postpone the tour rather than replace Chambers.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

Due to escalating drug abuse, Farndon was fired from the band after a meeting between Hynde, Honeyman-Scott, and Chambers on 14 June 1982. Two days later, on 16 June 1982, Honeyman-Scott died of heart failure as a result of cocaine intolerance. Farndon was in the midst of forming a new band when he was found dead on 14 April 1983 by his wife. After taking heroin and passing out, Farndon had drowned in his bathtub, leaving Pretenders with only two living members.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===Re-grouping (1983–1989)===

Hynde and Chambers continued the band after Honeyman-Scott's death. During July 1982, a caretaker team of Hynde, Chambers, [[Rockpile]] guitarist [[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]], and [[Big Country]] bassist [[Tony Butler (musician)|Tony Butler]] was assembled to record the single "Back on the Chain Gang".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buskin |first1=Richard |title=CLASSIC TRACKS: The Pretenders 'Back On The Chain Gang' Producer: Chris Thomas • Engineer: Steve Churchyard |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-pretenders-back-chain-gang |website=Sound on Sound |publisher=SOS Publications Group and/or its licensors |access-date=17 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422034825/https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-pretenders-back-chain-gang |archive-date=22 April 2019  |date=5 September 2005}}</ref><ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The song was released in October and became their biggest success in the US, staying at No.&nbsp;5 for three consecutive weeks. The single's B-side, "My City Was Gone" was (except for a brief period in the 1990s) the theme music for ''[[the Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' since its inception.<ref name="Limbaugh">{{cite web |last1=Limbaugh |first1=Rush |title=How I Chose My Theme Song |url=https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/03/11/how_i_chose_my_theme_song/ |website=The Rush Limbaugh Show |access-date=5 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="mydad">{{cite web |last1=Hynde |first1=Chrissie |title=My Dad Loved Rush Limbaugh |url=https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/chrissie-hynde-rush-limbaugh/ |website=Hollywood in Toto |publisher=Hollywood in Toto |access-date=5 March 2020}}</ref> 

Hynde then set up a more permanent lineup for the band, keeping Chambers and adding [[Robbie McIntosh]] on guitar and Malcolm Foster on bass. "Middle of the Road" was this line-up's first single, released in the US in November 1983 and reaching the Top 20 there. The US B-side, "2000 Miles", was released as a single in the UK. The third Pretenders album, ''[[Learning to Crawl]]'' was produced by "fifth Pretender" Chris Thomas and released in January 1984.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Thomas had also played keyboards with the band on their 1983 American tour which included the infamous [[US Festival]]. As well as the three recent singles, the album included a [[cover version]] of [[The Persuaders (band)|the Persuaders]]' "[[Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]", which featured [[Paul Carrack]] on keyboards. For the next bout of touring, Rupert Black joined the live band on keyboards.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In July 1985, the band (including Black) played at [[Live Aid]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Soon after recording sessions for the next album began and one track had been completed, Hynde declared that Chambers was no longer playing well and dismissed him. Discouraged at the loss of his bandmate, Foster quit ("My whole argument was that Martin Chambers was the rhythm section of the Pretenders and it didn't really matter who was playing bass. So I just said I didn't want to be involved any more."<ref name="fosterguitarist">[http://www.simpleminds.org.uk/reallifereviews.html 'Come a Long Way'] – interview with Malcolm Foster by Michael Leonard – ''Guitarist'' magazine, September 1990</ref>) Hynde and McIntosh recorded the rest of the album in various sessions in New York City and Stockholm with assorted session musicians. Towards the end of the sessions, Hynde hired two of the guest players–bassist [[T.M. Stevens]] and ex-[[Haircut One Hundred]] drummer [[Blair Cunningham]]—as the new Pretenders rhythm section. The ''[[Get Close]]'' album was released in 1986; the disc included the Top 10 singles "Don't Get Me Wrong" from the movie ''[[Gung Ho (film)|Gung Ho]]'' (helped by a popular video homage to the television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|the Avengers]]'') and "Hymn to Her" a No.&nbsp;8 success in the UK.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  In the US, both "Don't Get Me Wrong" and "My Baby" reached #1 on Billboards [[Mainstream Rock chart]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pretender to the Throne|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=65|date=29 May 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65|access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref> 

For the ''Get Close'' tour, Bernie Worrell was added to the live lineup on keyboards. During the tour, Hynde felt the band's sound had strayed from its New Wave rock roots. She believed that she was now fronting a new band that was "not Pretenders". Partway into the tour, she took drastic action: Stevens and Worrell were both sacked, Malcolm Foster was reinstated on bass, and Rupert Black returned on keyboards.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Following the end of the ''Get Close'' tour in 1987, McIntosh quit Pretenders and was replaced by former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] guitarist [[Johnny Marr]]. The group continued touring, after which Foster went on to join [[Simple Minds]] and Cunningham returned to session work.  Later in 1987, the compilation ''Pretenders - The Singles'' was released, featuring all fifteen UK and US singles from the last ten years; it included Hynde's duet with [[UB40]] on the cover of [[Sonny and Cher]]'s "[[I Got You Babe]]".{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Marr appeared on Pretenders' early 1989 single "Windows of the World" b/w "1969".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> For this single, the band consisted of Hynde, Marr, bassist James Eller and drummer James "J.F.T." Hood.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} After arguments with Hynde, Marr quit, moving on to [[the The]] and taking Eller with him. Exhausted by the upheavals of recent years, the band went into a hiatus for most of 1989 and 1990.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===1990s===
In 1990, Hynde hired session players (including one-time Pretenders Bremner and Cunningham and bassist John Mckenzie) and recorded a new Pretenders album, ''[[Packed!]]'' Hynde was the only person pictured anywhere on the album, and was the only official member of the band.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In Canada, the lead single "Never Do That" was a Top 40 success, peaking at No.&nbsp;26, but it fared less well elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

By 1993, Hynde had teamed with ex-[[Katydids (band)|Katydids]] guitarist [[Adam Seymour (musician)|Adam Seymour]] to form a new version of Pretenders. The team of Hynde and Seymour then hired a number of session musicians to record ''[[Last of the Independents]]'' that year, including ex-Smiths bassist [[Andy Rourke]], ex-[[The Primitives|Primitives]] bassist Andy Hobson, and former Pretender and drummer/writer/producer James Hood, previously with [[the Impossible Dreamers]] and [[Moodswings (band)|Moodswings]]. But by the end of the album sessions (and for the subsequent tour) the official band line-up was Hynde, Seymour, Hobson, and returning drummer Martin Chambers.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> This line-up endured for over a decade with no changes.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} 

When ''Last of the Independents'' was released in 1994, it rated gold in the US. Lead single "Night In My Veins" was a minor success in the US, a mid-chart success in the UK, and a top 10 success in Canada. The second single was the album's centrepiece ballad "I'll Stand by You"; this track received substantial airplay, and was a top 10 success in the UK, and top 20 in the US (No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100) and in Canada.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> 

On 10 April 1999, Hynde led the memorial concert "[[Concert for Linda|Here, There and Everywhere – A Concert for Linda]]" for her late close friend Linda McCartney at the Royal Albert Hall, London, organised by Hynde and Carla Lane. Pretenders were the backing band for all artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paulmccartney.com/live/tour-archives/here-there-and-everywhere-concert-for-linda|title=Here, There, and Everywhere: A Concert for Linda|website=Paul McCartney|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref>

''[[Viva el Amor]]'' was released during 1999, as was their collaboration with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] on the album ''[[Reload (Tom Jones album)|Reload]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-information-on-viva-el-amor-by-the-pretenders-1094534.html|title=The Information on 'Viva El Amor!' by Pretenders|date=May 19, 1999|work=The Independent|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-215-1400543|title=Tom Jones Gets Loaded|date=June 28, 1999|work=NME|access-date=December 3, 2019}}</ref>

===2000s===
Pretenders joined with [[Emmylou Harris]] on ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'', performing the song "She". A ''Greatest Hits'' compilation followed in 2000. During 2002 ''[[Loose Screw]]'' was released by Artemis Records, the first Pretenders record to be released by a company other than WEA. ''Rolling Stone'' noted its "refinement, stylish melodies and vocal fireworks," while ''Blender'' called it "slick, snarky pop with flashes of brilliance".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/loose-screw/critic-reviews?dist=positive |title=Critic Reviews for Loose Screw |publisher=Metacritic |date=2002-11-12 |access-date=2014-04-19}}</ref>

In March 2005, Pretenders were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-2005-the-pretenders-88119/|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2005:  Pretenders|website=Rollingstone.com|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=8 March 2005}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/pretenders|title=Pretenders|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref> At the induction ceremony, the band performed "Precious" and "Message of Love".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bestclassicbands.com/pretenders-rock-hall-induction-2005-3-18-16/|title=Pretenders Rock Hall Induction 2005|website=Bestclassicbands.com|date=1 June 2015}}</ref> During her acceptance speech, Hynde named and thanked all the replacement members of the group, then said:

<blockquote>
"I know that the Pretenders have looked like a tribute band for the last 20 years. ... And we're paying tribute to James Honeyman-Scott and Pete Farndon, without whom we wouldn't be here. And on the other hand, without us, they might have been here, but that's the way it works in rock 'n' roll."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/2005/03/pretenders-inducted-into-rock-and-roll.html |title=Neil Young News: Pretenders Inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Neil Young |publisher=Thrasherswheat.org |date=2005-03-15 |access-date=2014-04-19}}</ref>
</blockquote>

After their Hall of Fame induction, Pretenders continued touring as a four-part team (Hynde, Seymour, Hobson, and Chambers). During 2005, bassist Hobson left and was replaced by Nick Wilkinson, marking the band's first line-up change in thirteen years. That same year, [[Rhino Records]] released the four disc and DVD box set ''[[Pirate Radio (box set)|Pirate Radio]]'', which spanned the group's entire career. Two disc remastered versions of the first two albums also came out that year with bonus tracks. During 2007, Rhino remastered both ''Learning to Crawl'' and ''Get Close'' once again, with bonus tracks. Not long after, guitarist Seymour left and was replaced by James Walbourne.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Pretenders' album ''[[Break Up the Concrete]]'' was released through [[Shangri-La Music]] on 7 October 2008. It was the band's first Top 40 album in the US in twenty-two years, and its last to date. Tracks include "Boots of Chinese Plastic", "Don't Cut Your Hair", "Love's a Mystery", "The Last Ride" and "Almost Perfect".<ref>{{AllMusic|id=break-up-the-concrete-mw0000795303|title=Break Up the Concrete|access-date=6 June 2019}}</ref>
