'''In Fear and Faith''' was an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[San Diego]], [[California]]. Formed in 2006, the group was signed to [[Rise Records]] and released three studio albums and two EPs. Their debut full-length, ''[[Your World on Fire]]'', being released nearly a year after the band's signing to Rise in 2008, peaked at No.&nbsp;193 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Their second full-length album, ''[[Imperial (In Fear and Faith album)|Imperial]]'' was released the following year and failed to make that chart, but did chart on the [[Top Heatseekers]] and overall Indie chart in the US. The band has undergone many line-up changes since its formation, and does not feature any consistent original members since the departure of guitarist Ramin Niroomand and drummer Mehdi Niroomand in 2014; vocalist Scott Barnes is the only current member of the band to have performed on all of the group's studio albums, though he is not an original member;  likewise, although current bassist Tyler McElhany is a founding member of the band himself, he was out of the group from 2011 to 2014 and did not contribute to their third album, ''[[In Fear and Faith (album)|In Fear and Faith]]''.

== History ==

===Inception and ''Voyage'' (2006&ndash;2007)===
In Fear and Faith was founded in 2006 by members Davey Owens, Mehdi Niroomand, Tyler McElhaney, Jarred DeArmas, Michael Guy and Ramin Niroomand while attending high school in San Diego and derived the band's name off of the [[Circa Survive]] song of the same name. The band recorded a self-titled [[demo (music)|demo]] during the same year formed, containing four tracks.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/in-fear-and-faith] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref>

A year after recording the demo, founding vocalist Jarred DeArmas was kicked out of the group in desire of the members seeking a singer with a higher [[vocal range]]. [[Tyler Smith (musician)|Tyler Smith]] was, at this point, employed as the band's clean vocalist along with [[Cody Anderson (musician)|Cody Anderson]] as the band's unclean vocalist.

==Musical style==
In Fear and Faith are essentially a [[post-hardcore]] band, but perform the genre with a tied-in influence of [[heavy metal music|metal]] and [[electronica]].<ref name="allmusic">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/in-fear--faith-p1105395 |title=In Fear & Faith |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2011-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://metaldelirium.net/in-fear-and-faith-symphonies/ |title=In Fear and Faith - Symphonies {{!}} Metal Delirium |last=Angel |first=Justin |publisher=Metal Delirium |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619150533/http://metaldelirium.net/in-fear-and-faith-symphonies/ |archive-date=June 19, 2011 |access-date=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The group is primarily influenced by [[alternative rock]], [[emo]], [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] and heavy metal genres. Music journalist, Andrew Leahy documented In Fear and Faith's sound as "a blend of furious instrumentation, electronic flourishes and screamo vocals" along with mentioning embracement of heavy metal while complimenting their hybrid sound of being the case why the group "were signed so quickly" and "wasted little time" doing so.<ref name="allmusic" />

In Fear and Faith songs are usually - on average - three minutes in time length, but their larger and more-known songs such as "Live Love Die" and "The Taste of Regret" lead into four minutes of length. The main songwriters have primarily always been Ramin and Mehdi Nirromand, Tyler McElhaney and Scott Barnes. Bassist, McElhaney has commented on the band's [[guitar tunings]] stating that while the tunings on ''[[Your World on Fire]]'' and ''[[Voyage (EP)|Voyage]]'' would be set to the same drop throughout, ''[[Imperial (In Fear and Faith album)|Imperial]]'' features different tunings on several different songs to add "depth" regardless of the difficulty of this for live performances.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://underthegunreview.net/2010/06/09/utgtv-ifaf/ |title=UTG TV: In Fear and Faith [Interview] &#124; Under the Gun Review |last1=music |first1=James ShotwellJames Shotwell is the founder of Under The Gun Review He loves writing about |last2=Records |first2=movies almost as much as he loves his two fat cats He's also the co-founder of Antique |last3=Twitter |first3=the Marketing Coordinator for Haulix You should probably follow him on}}</ref>
