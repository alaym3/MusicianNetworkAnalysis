{{nihongo|'''Zard'''|ザード|Zādo}} were a [[Japan]]ese [[pop rock]] group. Originally a group of five members, with lead vocalist [[Izumi Sakai]] as its only constant member. Zard's work was sold under the record label [[Giza Studio|B-Gram Records]], Inc. Their most popular and successful songs are {{nihongo|"[[Makenaide]]" (1993)|負けないで}}, {{nihongo|"[[Yureru Omoi]]" (1993)|揺れる想い}}, and "[[My Friend (Zard song)|My Friend]]" (1996). As of 2014, Zard has sold over 37 million records, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists in Japan|best-selling music artists in Japan]].

==Career==
Zard began when the former CEO of Being Corporation, Daikō Nagato, recruited a 24-year-old model named Sachiko Kamachi. Changing her name to Izumi Sakai in an attempt to cut off her past, she created a group called Zard. Zard made a breakthrough with the release of their debut single February 10, 1991 ''[[Good-bye My Loneliness (song)|Good-bye My Loneliness]]'', which was a theme song for the Fuji TV drama "Ideals and Reality of Marriage" featuring [[Misako Tanaka]]. The song was very successful, reaching No. 9 in the [[Oricon]] rankings.

Zard's next two singles did not sell as well. The fourth, {{nihongo|"[[Nemurenai Yoru wo Daite]]"|眠れない夜を抱いて}} took a slightly different approach. The group's rock style had morphed to popular while the seemingly dark music videos turned to a relatively brighter image. In fact, half of Zard's official appearances on TV were related to performing this song, which sold 440,000 copies. At that time, [[Music Station]] host Kazuyoshi Morita (aka [[Tamori]]) asked Sakai what took Zard so long to be on stage. Sakai's reply was that they wanted to make sure Zard would be an economically viable project and hence did not want to go public prematurely.

The major breakthrough for Zard came with the sixth single in 1993, "[[Makenaide]]", which became No. 1 in the Oricon charts and went on to sell over 1.8 million copies. She went on to release two more songs that reached No. 1, "[[Yureru Omoi]]" and "[[Kitto Wasurenai]]" in the same year. An album titled "Yureru Omoi" featuring both "Makenaide" and "Yureru Omoi" sold two million copies, the first million milestone for Zard in album sales. In fact, Being was so successful in the early 1990s that it was called Being Boom. No one sold more CDs than Zard in this year.

In 1995, Zard sold one more million hit, "[[My Friend (Zard song)|My Friend]]". Although her sales fluctuated among six digits in sales for the remainder of the twentieth century, nine of twenty-one singles reached No. 1 and six reached No. 2. Only two could not break the top four mark. Since {{nihongo|"Yureru Omoi"|揺れる想い}} she also sold three hits of one million and one other of two million copies. On August 31, 1999, Zard held their first concert aboard [[cruise ship]] Pacific Venus, where six hundred people were randomly selected out of a million applicants. The DVD for this concert, released on January 26, 2000, had a limited production of 300,000 copies.

Sakai was also a very prolific [[lyricist]]. She wrote 150 songs during her 17-year career (numerous songs for other artists as well as all of the Zard songs except for two, {{nihongo|''Koionna no Yūutsu''|恋女の憂鬱}} and {{nihongo|''Onna de Itai''|女でいたい}} from their first album, ''[[Good-bye My Loneliness (album)|Good-bye My Loneliness]]'', which was written by Daria Kawashima,<ref>Good-bye My Loneliness album notes</ref>) and released several books of poetry as well. An editorial in ''Asahi Shimbun'' writes that the secret to Zard's success was that while the trend in Japan showed a decrease in the number of music programs on television, Zard used late night commercials that aired her voice to advertise her works.

She also wrote songs for other artists, most notably for the [[J-pop]] groups that shared her management company: [[Field of View]], [[Wands (band)|Wands]] and [[Deen (band)|Deen]], and the late mainland [[Taiwan]]ese singer [[Teresa Teng]]. She also wrote the lyrics for and participated in the collaboration for the single {{nihongo|"Hateshinai Yume o"|果てしない夢を}} featuring J-pop groups Zard, [[Zyyg]], [[Masayuki Deguchi|Rev]] & [[Wands (band)|Wands]]. The single also featured famed Japanese [[baseball]] hero [[Shigeo Nagashima]]. Some of her singles were used in [[anime]], such as ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'' and ''[[Detective Conan]]''. The lyrics of {{nihongo|"[[Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku]]"|ＤＡＮ　ＤＡＮ　心魅かれてく}} by [[Field of View]], the opening theme song of ''Dragon Ball GT'', is by Izumi Sakai. Afterward, Zard covered this song in ''[[Today Is Another Day]]'' album.

Zard's most successful single, {{nihongo|''Makenaide''|負けないで}} has been used as a theme song for [[Nippon Television]] program 24-hour TV, an annual Japanese television programming in which a celebrity host is on screen continually for a whole day. Sakai said that she was honored and looked forward to watching 24-hour TV. She also said that since ''Makenaide'' was widely appreciated by the public, she often felt as if that song was not hers to keep.

Zard was also known for being mysterious. This is partially because her record label did not release too much personal information on their artists, and also because she did not make that many personal appearances. She rarely appeared on any live TV music programs (e.g. [[TV Asahi]]'s [[Music Station]]), which the main public relations tool for the record industry in Japan, since 1993 or do any public appearances. Her first concert was in 1999, this being held on a [[cruise ship]] for a mere 600 people in her fan club (300 entries x2 among 2 million concert ticket requests). Her first and only concert tour, "What A Beautiful Moment Tour", was held in 2004, 13 years after her debut. Almost every single concert was sold out at the time. The tour ended up having 10 concerts spanning 4 months from March to July 2004, with a final concert held in the famed [[Nippon Budokan]].

Although originally Zard is a group, Zard was frequently regarded as a solo female singer in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5.nikkansports.com/general/obituary/2007/20070527-39022.html|title=Zard坂井泉水さん病院階段から転落死|publisher=[[Nikkan Sports]]|date=2007-05-27|access-date=2008-12-27|language=ja|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123102915/http://www5.nikkansports.com/general/obituary/2007/20070527-39022.html|archive-date=2009-01-23}}</ref> She used to hold a female record in Japan for most single sales until [[Ayumi Hamasaki]] released "[[No Way to Say]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/ns/entertainment/f-et-tp0-031110-0015.html|script-title=ja:浜崎あゆみシングルセールス女性歴代1位|publisher=Nikkan Sports|date=2003-11-10|access-date=2008-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031118193722/http://www.nikkansports.com/ns/entertainment/f-et-tp0-031110-0015.html|archive-date=2003-11-18|language=ja}}</ref> According to [[Yomiuri Shimbun]], as of August 2007, Zard was No. 8 for overall total in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/komachi/news/mixnews/20070817ok05.htm|title=追悼アルバム１、２位「Zardと生きていく」|publisher=Yomiuri Shimbun|date=2007-08-17|access-date=2008-12-29|language=ja}}</ref> She has had 11 singles reach the No. 1 spot on the [[Oricon]] Singles Charts, and 9 albums reach the No. 1 spot on the Oricon Album Charts. 40 of her singles reached top 10 in Oricon ranking.

Zard was also featured in Tak Matsumoto's Ihoujin (August 27, 2003). The single was later included in the cover album ''[[The Hit Parade (Tak Matsumoto album)|The Hit Parade]]'' produced by Tak Matsumoto.

On a trivial note, Zard's album "[[Oh My Love (album)|Oh My Love]]" released in 1994 reached No. 1 for the 500th edition of the Oricon Rankings since it began in 1970.<ref>[http://www.asahi.com/komimi/TKY200709190117.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103021403/http://www.asahi.com/komimi/TKY200709190117.html |date=2007-11-03 }} {{in lang|ja}}</ref> She has had 11 singles reach the No. 1 spot on the [[Oricon]].

=== Post-Izumi Sakai Zard ===
An album based on fan request was released on January 23, 2008, titled Zard Request Best: Beautiful Memory. NTV Morning News program, Zoom In Super's December 28, 2007 reports that over 500,000 entries were mailed to Being. Surprisingly, Makenaide and Yureru Omoi were not in the top 3, though they made the top 10. The three most voted songs were 1) Ano Hohoemi o Wasurenaide, 2) Shoujo no Koro ni Modotta Mitai ni, 3) Kakegae no Naimono.

When this album hit number one in the Oricon charts, it marked the eleventh time she had done so, matching the record held by [[Dreams Come True (band)|Dreams Come True]] for the most number ones by female vocal groups.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.japan-zone.com/news/2008/01/30/meet_the_new_boss.shtml |title=Japan Zone - Entertainment News from Japan: Meet the New Boss<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202135912/http://www.japan-zone.com/news/2008/01/30/meet_the_new_boss.shtml |archive-date=2008-12-02 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Sakai's death ==
[[Image:Fans writing a message for Izumi Sakai.jpg|200px|right|thumbnail|Fans of Izumi Sakai writing messages for her to the signature notebooks in Zard's agency on May 31, 2007.]]
Founding member Izumi Sakai died on May 27, 2007 at the age of 40 in [[Keio University]] Hospital. She entered the hospital in June 2006 after discovering she had [[cervical cancer]] and had the tumor removed. In April 2007, however, the cancer had spread to her lungs, resulting in her re-admittance to hospital. According to the hospital, she took daily walks every morning. During her walk on May 26, she accidentally fell from the stairs and was discovered at around 5:40a.m and taken the ICU. Never regaining consciousness, she died at 3:10pm the following day.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20070817202722/http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/news/20070529-OHT1T00065.htm</ref> An agency spokesman said:

{{cquote|''We hope that Izumi Sakai, along with her hit songs, will remain in the memory of her fans''.<ref>[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/national/news/20070528p2a00m0et027000c.html Zard singer Izumi Sakai dies in accident at 40]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} MSN-Mainichi Daily News</ref>}}

She had planned to release a new album in the fall, as well as her first live tour in three years to show her fans that she was fighting strongly against her illnesses.

A [[Funeral#Memorial services|memorial service]] for fans was held on June 27 in a [[funeral]] [[hall]] in [[Aoyama, Tokyo]]. On the previous day, a memorial service for the people concerned was held and [[Maki Ohguro]] and [[Tetsuro Oda]] etc. attended at this. At the same time, [[Tak Matsumoto]] and [[Koshi Inaba]] of [[B'z]], [[Mai Kuraki]] and [[Shigeo Nagashima]] announced memorial comments for her.<ref>[http://contents.oricon.co.jp/news/music/45851/ 長嶋茂雄名誉監督、B'z、倉木らが、坂井さんに追悼コメント] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001093545/http://contents.oricon.co.jp/news/music/45851/ |date=2011-10-01 }} News -Oricon Style- {{in lang|ja}}</ref>

Two compilation albums were planned for release on August 15, one that includes a selection of Sakai's personal favorite songs, the other that includes favorites from her staff. A fan-selected compilation album is also planned for the fall. Two tribute concerts were held&mdash;one on September 7 at [[Osaka Festival Hall]], and the other on September 14 at [[Tokyo]] [[Nippon Budokan]]. The two places were chosen because they were the first and last stops respectively of the ''What a beautiful moment Tour'' in 2004&mdash;the only tour that band has gone on. The tour was called "What a Beautiful Memory".

In September 2007, an audience of 13,000 participated in a memorial Budokan concert. There were nine screens set up where many showed previously unseen footage of Izumi Sakai. A first single after she died called ''[[Glorious Mind]]'' was played. This was a song which Sakai recorded before her hospitalization. This song was used for the opening theme song of the anime series ''[[Case Closed]]''.<ref>[http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-1719 13,000 fill Budokan for Zard memorial concert] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015184424/http://tokyograph.com/news/id-1719 |date=2007-10-15 }} Tokyograph</ref> It was not complete at the time of Sakai's death, but the chorus footage was complete. Extra minutes where she was singing in [[English language|English]] were incorporated from a previously unrelated and unreleased song as well.
