==Early life==

Williams was born in [[Mount Kisco, New York]], and grew up in [[Chappaqua, New York|Chappaqua]] with two older sisters, Meredith and Julie.<ref name = "born">{{cite news | first=Skip | last=Pearlman | title=Putnam Movie Director Screens 'The Anthropologist' At Greenwich Film Fest| url=http://putnam.dailyvoice.com/lifestyle/putnam-movie-director-screens-the-anthropologist-at-greenwich-film-fest/665803/ | publisher=Putnam Daily| date= June 10, 2016| access-date=June 29, 2017}}</ref><ref name = "chappaqua">{{cite news | first=Martin | last=Wilbur | title=Chappaqua Native Dar Williams Returns to Westchester With Irvington Concert| url=http://www.theexaminernews.com/chappaqua-native-dar-williams-returns-to-westchester-with-irvington-concert/ | publisher=The Examiner| date= December 2, 2015| access-date=June 29, 2017}}</ref> Her nickname "Dar" originated due to a mispronunciation of "Dorothy" by one of Williams's sisters.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://darwilliams.net/FAQ.html | title=Dar Williams FAQ | access-date=March 6, 2007 | last=Cohen | first=Gail J | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331202859/http://darwilliams.net/FAQ.html | archive-date=March 31, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> In a 2008 interview with WUKY radio, Dar said her parents wanted to name her Darcy, after the character in ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', and that they intentionally called her "Dar-Dar", which she shortened to "Dar" in school.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://stream.publicbroadcasting.net/production/mp3/national/local-national-736283.mp3| title=Tonic on WUKY| access-date=September 19, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031165615/http://stream.publicbroadcasting.net/production/mp3/national/local-national-736283.mp3| archive-date=October 31, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In interviews{{Specify|date=April 2009}}, she has described her parents as "liberal and loving" people who early on encouraged a career in songwriting. Williams began playing the guitar at age nine and wrote her first song two years later. However, she was more interested in drama at the time, and majored in theater and religion at [[Wesleyan University]].

== Musical career ==
[[File:Dar Williams onstage, 20050821-00079.jpg|alt=Williams with a guitar in front of a microphone|thumb|Williams in 2005, promoting ''[[My Better Self]]'']]
Williams moved to [[Boston]] in 1990 to further explore a career in theater. She worked for a year as stage manager of the [[Opera Company of Boston]],<ref name="Alarik1">{{cite news| first=Scott| last=Alarik| title=Finding a New Approach| url=http://darwilliams.net/library/performingsong-8-94.html| publisher=Performing Songwriter Magazine| date=September–October 1994| access-date=April 11, 2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203185132/http://darwilliams.net/library/performingsong-8-94.html| archive-date=February 3, 2007| df=mdy-all}}</ref> but on the side began to write songs, record demo tapes, and take [[voice lessons]]. In 1990, Dar recorded her first album, ''I Have No History'', produced by Jeannie Deva and engineered by Rob Lehmann at Oak Grove Studios in [[Malden, Massachusetts]]. One year later in 1991, Dar recorded her second album, ''All My Heroes Are Dead'', most of which was recorded at Wellspring Sound in Newton, MA. This album included Dar's song "Mark Rothko Song." The original recording of this song was later included in her third album ''The Honesty Room''. In 1993 Williams moved to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. Early in Williams's music career, she opened for [[Joan Baez]], who would make her relatively well known by recording some of her songs (Williams also dueted with Baez on ''[[Ring Them Bells]]''). Her growing popularity has since relied heavily on community coffeehouses, [[public radio]], and an extensive fan base on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Williams recorded her first full album, ''[[The Honesty Room]],'' under her own label, Burning Field Music. Guest artists included [[the Nields|Nerissa and Katryna Nields]], Max Cohen and [[Gideon Freudmann]]. The album was briefly distributed by Chicago-based [[Waterbug Records]]. Williams soon secured a licensing-and-distribution deal for Burning Field with Razor and Tie, and in 1995 reissued the album on that label, with two re-recorded bonus tracks. The record went on to become one of the top-selling independent folk albums of the year. 1996's ''[[Mortal City]]'', also licensed and distributed with Razor and Tie, received substantial notice, partially due to the fact that it coincided with her tour with Baez.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The album again featured guest appearances by the Nields sisters and Freudmann, as well as noted folk artists [[John Prine]], [[Cliff Eberhardt]] and [[Lucy Kaplansky]]. With that success, Razor & Tie re-released ''The Honesty Room''. By the time of her third release, ''[[End of The Summer]]'' (1997), Williams's career had gathered substantial momentum, and the album did remarkably well{{Specify|date=April 2009}}, given its genre and independent label status.

In 1998, Williams, [[Richard Shindell]] and [[Lucy Kaplansky]] formed the group [[Cry Cry Cry (band)|Cry Cry Cry]] as a way to pay homage to some of their favorite folk artists. The band released an eponymous album of covers and toured from 1998 to 2000. In June 2017, Cry Cry Cry reunited for the first time to play at the Clearwater Festival in New York.<ref name="clearwater">{{cite news | first=Joan | last=Vos Macdonald | title=Cry Cry Cry Fans Get The Reunion They Hoped For at Clearwater| url=https://patch.com/new-york/harrison/cry-cry-cry-fans-get-reunion-they-hoped-clearwater | publisher=Patch| date= June 1, 2017| access-date=June 29, 2017}}</ref>

She has since released six more studio albums on the Razor & Tie label (''[[The Green World]]'' (2000; which included "Spring Street", based on [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] in [[SoHo]] in [[Manhattan]]),<ref>{{cite web

Williams has lent her talent and support to various causes, founding the Snowden Environmental Trust and taking part in many benefit concerts. She performed in a show at [[Alcatraz]] with Baez and the [[Indigo Girls]], to benefit the prisoner-rights group [[Mimi Fariña#Bread and Roses|Bread and Roses]].

As someone who has toured a great deal of the time and had trouble finding suitable dining on the road, Williams was inspired to write and publish a directory of [[natural food store]]s and restaurants called ''The Tofu Tollbooth'' in 1994.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/30308151 | title=Find in a Library: Tofu Tollbooth, First Edition| year=1994| publisher=Ardwork Press| isbn=9780963992611| access-date=March 11, 2007}}</ref> In 1998 Williams co-authored a second edition with Elizabeth Zipern.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/40266420 | title=Find in a Library: Tofu Tollbooth, Second Edition| year=1998| isbn=9781886101067| access-date=March 11, 2007| last1=Zipern| first1=Elizabeth| last2=Williams| first2=Dar}}</ref>

Williams wrote a book, released on September 5, 2017, titled ''What I Found in a Thousand Towns: A Traveling Musicians Guide to Rebuilding America's Communities&nbsp;– One Coffee Shop, Dog Run, & Open-Mike Night at a Time'', that focuses in part on rebuilding smaller cities and larger towns in America.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singer likes Rochester's food and wine so much it's in her new book |publisher= Democrat & Chronicle |url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2017/08/12/dar-williams-highlights-finger-lakes-region-upcoming-book/553449001/ |access-date=August 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Songs==
[[File:Dar Williams July 2008a.jpg|alt=|thumb|Williams onstage in 2008]]
Recurrent themes in Williams's songs include religion, adolescence, [[gender]] issues, [[anti-commercialism]], misunderstood relationships, [[Grief|loss]], humor, and geography.

Williams' early work spoke clearly of her upbringing in 1970s and 80s [[suburbia]] – of [[Social alienation|alienation]], and the [[hypocrisy]] evident in the [[Post-World War II baby boom|post-WWII]] middle class. On the track "Anthem" on her early tape ''[[All My Heroes Are Dead (Dar Williams album)|All My Heroes Are Dead]]'', she sang, "I know there's blood in the pavement and we've turned the fields to sand."

Williams' songs often address gender typing, [[gender roles|roles]], and inequities. "You're Aging Well" on ''[[The Honesty Room]]'' discusses adolescent body image, [[ageism]] and [[self-loathing]] in detail. The song ends with the singer finding an unnamed female mentor &mdash; "the woman of voices" &mdash; who points her toward a more enlightened and mature point of view. [[Joan Baez]] covered the song in concert and later dueted with Williams on tours.<ref>{{cite news | title= Joan Baez and Dar Williams Interviewed by Liane Hansen| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-28472063.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218200643/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-28472063.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=December 18, 2006| publisher=NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday | date=October 8, 1995 }}</ref>

A 2001 article in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''<ref>{{cite web |author=Gail Cohen |url=http://darwilliams.net/library/advocate6-11-01.html |title=Dar to be different |publisher=Darwilliams.net |date=November 6, 2001 |access-date=August 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819161743/http://darwilliams.net/library/advocate6-11-01.html |archive-date=August 19, 2012 }}</ref> discussed Williams' popularity among [[LGBT]] people, writing that among LGBT-supportive straight songwriters, "few manage in their lyrics to dig as deeply or as authentically as... Williams does".

"When I Was a Boy", also on ''The Honesty Room'', uses Williams' own childhood experiences as a [[tomboy]] to muse on gender roles and how they limit boys and girls, who then become limited men and women.<ref name = "Alarik1"/>

"The Christians and the Pagans" on ''[[Mortal City]]'' simultaneously tackles both religion and [[sexual orientation]] through a tale of a lesbian, [[pagan]] couple that chooses to spend [[Winter solstice|solstice]] with the devout Christian uncle of one of the women, thus creating a situation where people who would oppose each other on almost every political and cultural front try to get by on pure politeness. Throughout the song, the family members begin to discover their differences need not estrange them from one another.

In an interview in 2007 on the Food Is Not Love [[podcast]], she said that the song "February" from ''Mortal City'' is one of her songs that she likes best. She referred to the way the song "kept on evolving into, not only what I wanted to say, but what I wanted to say and didn't even know was in there." She liked the way the song "kept on breaking its own rules in a way that art is all about."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foodisnotlove.podomatic.com/entry/2007-03-19T18_42_52-07_00 |title=Food Is Not Love podcast |access-date=March 21, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707215847/http://foodisnotlove.podomatic.com/entry/2007-03-19T18_42_52-07_00 |archive-date=July 7, 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Williams' relationship with her family is hinted at through several songs, including "After All" on ''[[The Green World]]''. The song deals mainly with her depression at the age of twenty-one,<ref name = "Rothschild1">{{cite news | first=Matthew | last=Rothschild | title=Dar Williams Interview| url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_intv0606 | publisher=The Progressive| date=June 2006| access-date=April 11, 2007}}</ref> referring to it as a "winter machine that you go through" repeatedly while "everyone else is spring-bound."

Her song "As Cool As I Am" has become part of [[Bryn Mawr College]]'s traditional May Day, when the song is played during the "May Hole" celebration. The song is even called an "unofficial anthem" for the school.<ref>{{cite news | first=Molly | last=Parzen | title=Dar Williams at the Mawr | newspaper=The Bi-College News | date=April 6, 2010 | url=http://www.biconews.com/2010/04/06/dar-williams-at-the-mawr-2/ | access-date=March 8, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212201225/http://www.biconews.com/2010/04/06/dar-williams-at-the-mawr-2/ | archive-date=February 12, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Williams has visited the college several times to perform at concerts.
