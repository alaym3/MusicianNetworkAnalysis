Both the [[riddim]] (known as "World Jam") and the hook of [[Damian Marley]]'s 2005 hit "[[Welcome to Jamrock (song)|Welcome to Jamrock]]" were sampled from Kamoze's 1984 track "World-A-Music".<ref name="allmusic1"/> The opening line – "Out in the streets, they call it merther" – has been sampled in countless [[drum and bass]] and [[dubstep]] tracks.  His dub version of "Here Comes the Hotstepper", otherwise known as "I'm Steppin' it Hotter This Year", released in 1993, remains a dancehall anthem.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
