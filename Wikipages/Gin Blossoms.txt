'''Gin Blossoms''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1987 in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Arizona]]. They rose to prominence following the 1992 release of their first major label album, ''[[New Miserable Experience]]'', and the first single released from that album, "[[Hey Jealousy]]". "Hey Jealousy" became a Top 25 hit and went gold, and ''New Miserable Experience'' eventually went quadruple platinum; four other charting singles were released from the album. The band's follow-up album, ''[[Congratulations I'm Sorry]]'' (1996), went platinum and the single "[[As Long as It Matters]]" was nominated for a Grammy Award. Gin Blossoms broke up in 1997. Since reuniting in 2001, the band has released ''[[Major Lodge Victory]]'' in 2006, ''[[No Chocolate Cake]]'' in 2010, and ''[[Mixed Reality]]'' in 2018.

==History==
=== Early years ===
During the band's early years, its members included lead guitarist and songwriter [[Doug Hopkins]], bass guitarist [[Bill Leen]], [[Jesse Valenzuela]] (lead vocalist at first, later rhythm guitarist and backing vocals), rhythm guitarist Richard Taylor, Taylor's replacement Steven Severson, drummer Chris McCann, McCann's replacement Dan Henzerling, and Severson's replacement [[Robin Wilson (musician)|Robin Wilson]] (rhythm guitarist at first, later lead vocalist).<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p57420/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Gin Blossoms|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=June 3, 2013}}</ref> The band's name comes from a photo of [[W.C. Fields]] in [[Kenneth Anger]]'s infamously erroneous book, ''[[Hollywood Babylon]]'', which bore the caption "W.C. Fields with gin blossoms", referring to the actor's [[telangiectasia]]-spotted face and [[Rhinophyma|rhinophymic]] nose by the slang term for the skin condition known as [[rosacea]].<ref name=Brody>{{cite news | first=Jane E. | last=Brody | title=Sometimes Rosy Cheeks Are Just Rosy Cheeks | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9400E5DB1631F935A25750C0A9629C8B63 | date=March 16, 2004 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Gin Blossoms became well known around the band's hometown of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The band's frequent touring resulted in an increase in popularity. They independently recorded their first full-length album, ''[[Dusted (Gin Blossoms album)|Dusted]]'', which was released in December 1989.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dusted - Gin Blossoms |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dusted-mw0000230840 |website=Allmusic}}</ref>

By the early 1990s, Wilson and Valenzuela had switched roles, with Wilson taking on lead vocal duties and Valenzuela concentrating on rhythm guitar and backing vocals. Along with Leen on bass and Hopkins on lead guitar, [[Phillip Rhodes]] became the new drummer. After being signed to [[A&M Records]], the band began to work on their first major label album. Initial attempts faltered and the band released an EP, ''[[Up and Crumbling]]'', instead.<ref>{{cite web |title=Up & Crumbling - Gin Blossoms |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/up-crumbling-mw0000272987 |website=Allmusic}}</ref>

=== Mainstream success ===
Gin Blossoms named their second album ''[[New Miserable Experience]]''. In February 1992, while still working to complete it, founding member and lead guitarist/songwriter Hopkins drank heavily and grew increasingly depressed. With the other members hesitant to fire Hopkins, A&M forcefully removed him from the band and withheld $15,000 owed to Hopkins until he agreed to sign over half of his publishing royalties and relinquish his mechanical royalties. Hopkins reluctantly agreed to these demands because of his dire financial situation.<ref name=RS>Baird, Robert (February 10, 1994), "Ex-Blossom dies". ''Rolling Stone''. (675):15</ref> Scott Johnson was chosen by the band in December 1992 as Hopkins' stand-in on tour, and became a permanent member in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=After 16 years, guitarist Scotty Johnson is singing again |url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/get_out/after-years-guitarist-scotty-johnson-is-singing-again/article_314ed124-221d-5f7f-8b53-8efd65e40d40.html |website=East Valley Tribune}}</ref>

''New Miserable Experience'' became the band's breakthrough album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/gin-blossoms-new-miserable-experience-the-dark-history-of-a-nineties-classic-126566/|title=Gin Blossoms' 'New Miserable Experience': The Dark History of a Nineties Classic|work=Rolling Stone|last=Hudak|first=Joseph|date=March 29, 2017|access-date=November 3, 2018}}</ref> The first single released from the album was "[[Hey Jealousy]]", which had been written by Hopkins. The song reached No.&nbsp;25 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No.&nbsp;4 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and later went gold,<ref name="auto1">{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/09/01/gin-blossoms-tour-bands-mixed-reality-return-classic-form-robin-wilson/1106397002/|title=Gin Blossoms' Robin Wilson on why 'Mixed Reality' is their best since 'Miserable' was new|work=AZCentral.com|last=Masley|first=Ed|date=September 1, 2018|access-date=November 3, 2018}}</ref> largely fueling the success of ''New Miserable Experience''. However, the achievement was overshadowed by Hopkins's suicide on December 5, 1993.{{cn|date=September 2020}} The following year, another song by Hopkins, "[[Found Out About You]]", also reached No.&nbsp;25 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and climbed to No.&nbsp;1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Modern Rock Tracks]]. ''New Miserable Experience'' eventually reached quadruple platinum status.<ref name="auto1"/>

Between their first and second albums, Gin Blossoms contributed the single "[[Til I Hear It from You]]" for the ''[[Empire Records]]'' soundtrack. It reached No.&nbsp;9 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Their second major album, ''[[Congratulations I'm Sorry]]'', was released in 1996. Yielding one top ten hit ("[[Follow You Down]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;9 ''Billboard'' Hot 100), the album went platinum.<ref name="Tribune">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=40AgAAAAIBAJ&pg=6836,383865&dq=gin-blossoms+robin-wilson&hl=en|title=Gin Blossoms confirm breakup |date=January 1, 1998|newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|access-date=November 3, 2018}}</ref> A song from the album entitled ''[[As Long as It Matters]]'' was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/gin-blossoms|title=Gin Blossoms|date=June 4, 2019|website=GRAMMY.com}}</ref>

With chart success came opportunities to appear as musical guests on late night television. Between 1993 and 1996, Gin Blossoms appeared on The ''[[Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' (1993), ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' (1994), and as featured musical act on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (1996). Gin Blossoms appeared on the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' in solo appearances, and once performed "[[Christine Sixteen]]" with the members of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. Gin Blossoms became a favorite of Late Show musical director [[Paul Shaffer]], and their music was often featured as the show cut to and from commercials. The band was also a featured performer in the closing credits of the movie ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'' (1993), performing "Idiot Summer" on-screen as part of the fictional concert "[[Waynestock]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2588218/|title=The Gin Blossoms|website=IMDb|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref>

=== Breakup ===
Gin Blossoms broke up in early 1997. Wilson and Rhodes launched the [[Gas Giants (band)|Gas Giants]] while Leen formed a band called Rai and then retired from music to operate a rare book store. Valenzuela fronted a short-lived outfit called the Low Watts, released a solo album, and kept busy writing and producing. Johnson joined another Tempe-based band, [[Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers]]. Wilson ventured into producing as well, at his Mayberry Studios in Tempe, Arizona. (The studio is now called Uranus Studios.)<ref>{{cite web |title=So you want to be a Rock 'n' Roll Star |url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/so-you-want-to-be-a-rock-n-roll-star-6420905 |website=Phoenix New Times}}</ref>

=== Reunion ===

The Gas Giants announced an "indefinite hiatus" in June 2001. On December 4, 2001, it was announced that Scott was leaving Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers to rejoin Gin Blossoms. The band regrouped and began playing together again in earnest in 2002, having done a couple of one-off shows in the interim. In the words of the front man Robin Wilson at the time, "We always said our breakup wasn't forever and right now we're all feeling like we want to be Gin Blossoms again. We make a noise together that we can't make otherwise. We respect and appreciate that we need each other to create that sound. This time we hope to avoid being swallowed by the chaos."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ginblossoms.net/band.php |title=Gin Blossoms| publisher=Gin Blossoms |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904170019/http://ginblossoms.net/band.php |archive-date=September 4, 2004}}</ref>

In preparation for the band's official reunion show, Rhodes suffered a breakdown due to his ongoing battle with alcohol. Shortly after entering rehab, he was formally dismissed from the band.<ref>{{cite web |title='90s Survivors the Gin Blossoms: "There Won't Be Too Many Left Turns" |url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/90s-survivors-the-gin-blossoms-there-wont-be-too-many-left-turns-6766276 |website=Houston Press}}</ref> Phil Leavitt of [[Dada (band)|Dada]] originally took Rhodes' place in the line up, and then Gary Smith (of The Pistoleros, another Tempe band) stepped in. Scott Kusmirek took over drumming for the band from 2002 to 2004. In January 2005, it was announced that Rhodes, who had been sober for over two years, would rejoin the band. The re-entry of Rhodes was short-lived, however. Kusmirek returned to the band, taking Rhodes' place until September 30, 2008, when a press release issued by the band explained that he and the group had parted ways. [[John Richardson (Drummer)|John Richardson]] joined as the new drummer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ginblossoms.net/bandMember.php?id=JOHN |title=John Richardson |publisher=Gin Blossoms |access-date=July 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044303/http://www.ginblossoms.net/bandMember.php?id=JOHN |archive-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

The band's fourth album, ''[[Major Lodge Victory]]'', was originally recorded at Wilson's Mayberry Studios in Tempe. However, the album was re-recorded at [[Ardent Studios]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], where the band had recorded all of their previous albums. ''Major Lodge Victory'' was released by [[Hybrid Recordings]] on August 8, 2006, and "Learning the Hard Way" was the first single. ''Major Lodge Victory'' entered the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart at number 159.<ref>{{cite web |title=Major Lodge Victory - Gin Blossoms |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/major-lodge-victory-mw0000573958 |website=Allmusic}}</ref>
[[File:Drummer Scott Hessel of Gin Blossoms.jpg|thumb|left|Drummer Scott Hessel]]
Gin Blossoms released a [[live album]], ''[[Live in Concert (Gin Blossoms album)|Live In Concert]]'', on May 15, 2009. This album contains live recordings of the band's hits such as "Hey Jealousy" and "Follow You Down", as well as more recent singles such as "[[Learning the Hard Way]]" and "Long Time Gone", and a live cover version of [[Elton John]]'s "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]". The band's fifth studio album, ''[[No Chocolate Cake]]'', was released on September 28, 2010. The first single, "Miss Disarray" was released to radio stations on August 2, 2010.

The band announced on its website on March 4, 2012, that Richardson had left the band to pursue other recording and performing projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ginblossoms.net/news_story.php?id=c14b3352eb9b722c7d714285cf7e1d8a |title=John Moves Forward, Scott Hessel Moves in! |publisher=Gin Blossoms |date=March 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414202813/http://www.ginblossoms.net/news_story.php?id=c14b3352eb9b722c7d714285cf7e1d8a |archive-date=April 14, 2012}}</ref> The band stated in its news release, "John is a great drummer and all of us support his passion for recording. We all wish him the very best and thank him for all his hard work and dedication." The band also announced that Scott Hessel would be its road drummer. Hessel had been a member of another Tempe band, [[Let Go (band)|Let Go]]. Gin Blossoms joined [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]], [[Sugar Ray]], [[Lit (band)|Lit]], and [[Marcy Playground]] on the [[Summerland Tour]] 2012, a 31-date nationwide tour that began on June 28, 2012, in [[Saratoga, California]], and ended on August 11, 2012, in [[Laughlin, Nevada]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Holy '90s Batman!
