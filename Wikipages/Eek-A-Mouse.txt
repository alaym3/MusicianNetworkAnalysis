'''Eek-A-Mouse''' (born '''Ripton Joseph Hylton''', 19 November 1957) is a Jamaican [[reggae]] musician. He is one of the earliest artists to be described as a "[[singjay]]".{{efn|Eek-A-Mouse often softly disregards notions of himself being a deejay & singjay in live-performances, especially during his prime in the 80s.}}<ref name="Barrow">Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) "The Rough Guide To Reggae, 3rd edn.", Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-329-4}}</ref> Eek-A-Mouse is well known for pioneering his own style of [[Scat singing|scatting]], differing from the-then toasting [[deejays]] in the 80s.

==Biography==
Born in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], Eek-A-Mouse began his music career when he was in college, releasing two [[roots reggae]] singles under his own name, which were produced by his mathematics tutor, Mr. Dehaney. These early works were influenced by the music of [[Pablo Moses]].<ref name="Barrow" /><ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2002) ''Reggae & Caribbean Music'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}</ref> He then went on to work for various  [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]] over the next few years and also released a few more singles. He adopted the [[stage name]] "Eek-A-Mouse" in 1979, taking the name of a racehorse he always bet on; it was a nickname his friends had used for some time.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (1998) "The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae", Virgin Books, {{ISBN|0-7535-0242-9}}</ref><ref name="Greene">Greene, Jo-Ann "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2882/biography|pure_url=yes}} Eek-A-Mouse Biography]", allmusic, Macrovision Corporation</ref> He began recording for [[Joe Gibbs (record producer)|Joe Gibbs]] in 1979, having a hit straight away with "Once a Virgin", now showing the influence of [[Ranking Joe]],<ref name="Barrow" /> and this was soon followed with "Wa-Do-Dem" (produced by Douglas Boothe), and "Modelling Queen", which began an association with [[Linval Thompson]], who produced his debut ''Bubble Up Yu Hip'' album.<ref name="Thompson" />

By the end of 1980, he had linked up with producer [[Henry "Junjo" Lawes]], with whom he had big hits in 1981 with the likes of "Virgin Girl" and a recut "Wa-Do-Dem".<ref name="Larkin" /> In 1981, he was the star of the [[Reggae Sunsplash]] Festival, cheering audiences still mourning over the death of reggae icon [[Bob Marley]].<ref name="Greene" /> His association with Lawes led to a string of successful singles and albums, and in 1982 his hits included "Wild Like a Tiger", "For Hire and Removal", "Do You Remember", and "Ganja Smuggling". The same year he released his second album, ''Wa Do Dem''.<ref name="Greene" /> The "Operation Eradication" single showed Hylton's serious side, the song inspired by the vigilante killing of close friend and fellow DJ [[Errol Shorter]].<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Greene" /><ref name="Lesser">Lesser, Beth (2008) ''Dancehall: The Rise of Jamaican Dancehall Culture'', Soul Jazz, {{ISBN|978-0-9554817-1-0}}, p.37</ref> ''Skidip'' was released before the year was out.

Further albums followed with 1983 ''Mouse and the Man'', produced by Linval Thompson, and 1984 ''Mouseketeer'', again produced by Lawes. He also featured on several of the live dancehall albums from the era, including the ''Aces International'' and ''Live at Skateland'' collections.<ref name="Thompson" /> In the second half of the decade his popularity began to wane slightly, and he targeted the United States with the ''Assassinator'' album in 1985 (his first US release), produced by Anthony and Ronald Welch.<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name="Greene" /> He also travelled to the United Kingdom to record ''The King and I'' the same year, the album targeted at the [[Rock music|rock]] crossover audience to which he had begun to appeal.<ref name="Thompson" />

His 1988 album ''Eek-A-Nomics'' saw him begin to establish himself with an international audience, spawning a club hit with "The Freak", and he was signed by [[Island Records]] in 1989.<ref name="Greene" /> He returned to prominence with 1991's ''U-Neek'' album, which continued the rock-oriented style, including a [[cover version]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[D'yer Mak'er]]", and from which the hit single "You're The One I Need" was taken.<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name="Greene" /> He went through a period of relative quietness before returning in 1996 with the ''Black Cowboy'' album.<ref name="Thompson" />

He also has a performance in the 1991 gangster movie ''[[New Jack City]]'' playing a drug-dealing Rastafarian named Fat Smitty.<ref name="Thompson" />
