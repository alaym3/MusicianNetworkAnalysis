==Early life and education==
McKennitt was born in [[Morden, Manitoba]], of [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent to parents Jack (died 1992) and Irene McKennitt (1931–2011). In Morden, she developed her love for music, influenced, in part, by the musical traditions of the local [[Mennonite]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-seasoned-soul-1.236851 |title=A seasoned soul – 22 Jan 200 |publisher=The Irish Times |access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>

McKennitt enrolled at the [[University of Manitoba]] in [[Winnipeg]] to become a veterinarian. While in Winnipeg she discovered folk music, including fellow Canadians [[Neil Young]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Gordon Lightfoot]]. At this time she also developed an interest in Celtic music and visited [[Ireland]] to hear it for herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quinlanroad.com/aboutus/lmintro.asp |title=About Us – Loreena McKinnett Introduces Herself |publisher=Quinlan Road |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref> Developing a passion for Celtic music, she learned to play the [[Celtic harp]] and began [[busking]] at various places, including [[St. Lawrence Market]] in [[Toronto]] in order to earn money to record her first album.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/59584224.html?dids=59584224:59584224&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+29%2C+1994&author=JIM+WASHBURN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=If+You+Must%2C+Label+Her+%60Enlightened'+Pop+music%3A+Loreena+McKennitt%2C+who+performs+in+Irvine+tonight%2C+sings+ethereal+material%2C+but+don't+pigeonhole+the+harpist+as+New+Age.&pqatl=google If You Must, Label Her 'Enlightened' Pop music: Loreena McKennitt, who performs in Irvine tonight, sings ethereal material, but don't pigeonhole the harpist as New Age."], ''[[L.A.

==Career==

===Initial success: 1985–1998===
McKennitt's first album, ''[[Elemental (Loreena McKennitt album)|Elemental]]'', was released in 1985, followed by ''[[To Drive the Cold Winter Away]]'' (1987), ''[[Parallel Dreams]]'' (1989), ''[[The Visit (Loreena McKennitt album)|The Visit]]'' (1991), ''[[The Mask and Mirror]]'' (1994),<ref name="Inc.1994">{{cite book|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=A Breakthrough Year for Canadian Acts|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53|date=24 December 1994|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=53–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> ''[[A Winter Garden: Five Songs for the Season|A Winter Garden]]'' (1995), and ''[[The Book of Secrets]]'' (1997). All of her work is released under her own label, [[Quinlan Road]].

In 1990, McKennitt provided the music for the [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary ''[[The Burning Times]]'', a feminist revisionist account of the Early Modern European [[witchcraft trials]]. She and the musical team she headed would later re-record the documentary's main theme on her album ''[[The Visit (Loreena McKennitt album)|The Visit]]'' under the title "Tango to Evora".

In 1993, she toured Europe supporting [[Mike Oldfield]]. In 1995, her version of the traditional Irish song "[[Bonny Portmore]]" was featured in the ''[[Highlander (TV series)|Highlander]]'' series, followed by the 1994 film ''Highlander 3: The Sorcerer''. McKennitt's single "[[The Mummers' Dance]]" received airplay in North American markets during the spring of 1997, and was used as the theme song for the short-lived TV series ''[[Legacy (U.S. TV series)|Legacy]]''. It also saw use in the trailer for a wide-release 1998 [[Drew Barrymore]] film ''[[Ever After]]''.

Her music appeared in the movies ''[[The Santa Clause]]'', ''[[Soldier (1998 American film)|Soldier]]''. ''[[Jade (film)|Jade]]'', ''[[Holy Man]]'', ''[[The Mists of Avalon (TV miniseries)|The Mists of Avalon]]'', and ''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]]''. It was also featured in the television series ''[[Roar (U.S. TV series)|Roar]]'', ''[[Due South]]'', and ''[[Full Circle (Women and Spirituality)]]''.

===Personal tragedy and hiatus===
In July 1998, McKennitt's fiancé Ronald Rees, his brother Richard, and their close friend Gregory Cook drowned in a boating accident on [[Georgian Bay]]. She was deeply affected by the event, and she founded the [[Cook-Rees Memorial Fund]] for Water Search and Safety in the same year. At the time of the incident, she was working on a live album of two performances called ''[[Live in Paris and Toronto]]''. The proceeds from this album were donated to the newly created memorial fund, totalling some three million dollars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quinlanroad.com/explorethemusic/liveinparis.asp |title=Explore The Music – Live in Paris and Toronto |publisher=Quinlan Road |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref>

After the release of the live album, McKennitt decided that she would substantially reduce the number of her public performances, and she did not release any new recordings until the studio album ''[[An Ancient Muse]]'' in 2006.

===Return to music: 2006–present===
During 2005, McKennitt began work on the album that would become ''An Ancient Muse'', her seventh full-length studio album, released in November 2006. In September 2006, she performed live at the [[Alhambra]]. The performance premiered on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and in August 2007 was released on a three-disc DVD/CD set titled ''[[Nights from the Alhambra]]''.

In 2008, McKennitt wrote and composed a song she titled "To The Fairies They Draw Near" as the theme song for Disney's direct-to-video animated film ''[[Tinker Bell (film)|Tinker Bell]]''. She also provided the narration for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quinlanroad.com/newsandviews/currentupdates.asp?id=782 |title=Loreena sings theme song and narrates Disney's ''Tinker Bell'' – 5 July 2008 |publisher=Quinlanroad.com |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref>

In early 2008, she returned to [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Real World Studios]] to record ''[[A Midwinter Night’s Dream]]'', an extended version of her 1995 mini-album ''[[A Winter Garden: Five Songs for the Season]]''. The album was released on October 28, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quinlanroad.com/newsandviews/currentupdates.asp?id=822 |title=A Midwinter Night's Dream Loreena's newest recording for the winter season set for release October 2008 – 7 October 2008 |publisher=Quinlanroad.com |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref>

Since the release of ''An Ancient Muse'', McKennitt has toured consistently, with a European and North American ''An Ancient Muse tour'' in 2007 and another extensive tour across Canada and United States later in 2007, a tour of Europe in 2008 and a Mediterranean tour in 2009 with stops in [[Greece]],<ref>[http://www.rocking.gr/article5947.php "Tέλος Ιουνίου οι συναυλίες της Loreena McKennitt" (End of June Concerts Loreena McKennitt)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612032014/http://www.rocking.gr/article5947.php |date=June 12, 2009 }}, rocking.gr (Greek)</ref> [[Turkey]], [[Cyprus]], [[Lebanon]], [[Hungary]] and [[Italy]].

On September 17, 2009, McKennitt announced that she planned to release a two-disc album titled ''A Mediterranean Odyssey''. The first CD, "From Istanbul to Athens", consisted of 10 new live recordings made during her 2009 Mediterranean tour, including songs she had never before recorded in concert. The second CD, "The Olive and the Cedar", had a Mediterranean theme which McKennitt herself curated. It contained previously released studio recordings created between 1994 and 2006.

November 16, 2010, saw the US release (November 12 for Europe) of McKennitt's latest studio album, ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley''. Recorded at the Sharon Temple, Ontario, it consists of nine traditional Celtic songs. "Every once and again there is a pull to return to one's own roots or beginnings, with the perspective of time and experience, to feel the familiar things you once loved and love still", said McKennitt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/West-end-Times/18.14-west-end-times/2012113001/8.html#8 |title=Loreena McKennitt – 1 December 2012 |publisher=The West End Times |access-date=May 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529223402/http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/West-end-Times/18.14-west-end-times/2012113001/8.html#8 |archive-date=May 29, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

When McKennitt released ''The Wind that Shakes the Barley'' she visited several countries to help promote the album. During the promotional tour she performed an hour-long concert in the studios of German radio station SWR1, accompanied only by Brian Hughes (guitars) and [[Caroline Lavelle]] (cello) who have long been part of her tours and recordings. This live concert was released on CD in 2011. Called ''Troubadours on the Rhine'', the album was nominated for a 2012 Grammy for Best New Age Album.

On November 30, 2012, McKennitt lent her support to [[Kate Winslet]]'s [[Golden Hat Foundation]] together with [[Tim Janis]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Andrea Corr]], [[Hayley Westenra]], the [[Sleepy Man Banjo Boys]], Dawn Kenney, [[Jana Mashonee]], Amy Petty, and a choir, along with others, performing on "The American Christmas Carol" concert at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Sarah-McLachlan-Andrea-Corr-and-More-Set-for-Tim-Janis-American-Christmas-Carol-Concert-1130-20120914 |title=American Christmas Carol Concert |publisher=broadwayworld.com | date=September 14, 2012 |access-date=December 2, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenhatfoundation.org/about-us/blog |title=The American Christmas Carol |publisher=goldenhatfoundation.org |access-date=December 2, 2012}}</ref>

McKennitt's 10th studio album, ''[[Lost Souls (Loreena McKennitt album)|Lost Souls]]'', was released on May 11, 2018. She planned a tour to support the album's release in 2018 and 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loreenamckennitt.com/new-album-set-release-may-11th/|title=New Album Set for Release May 11th! - Loreena McKennitt|date=March 8, 2018|website=Lorrenamckennitt.com|access-date=May 15, 2018}}</ref>

In 2019, McKennitt released the live album ''Live at the Royal Albert Hall'', recorded earlier that year in London.

==Legacy==

===Genre===

McKennitt's music has generally been classified as [[World music|World]] or [[Celtic music]] even though it contains aspects and characteristics of music from around the globe and is sometimes classified as [[folk music]] in record stores.

McKennitt is occasionally compared to [[Enya]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goddard|first1=Peter|title=The darling of old folkies and new agers plays it her way.|work=Toronto Star|date=29 October 1991|page=E1}}</ref> but McKennitt's music is more grounded in traditional and classical invocations, using literary works as sources of lyrics and springboards for interpretation such as "[[The Lady of Shalott]]" by [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]], "[[Prospero]]'s Speech" (the final [[soliloquy]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''), the Northumbrian [[murder ballad]] "[[The Twa Sisters]]" (which inspired "The Bonny Swans" on ''[[The Mask and Mirror]]''), "Snow" by [[Archibald Lampman]], "Dark Night of the Soul" by [[St. John of the Cross]], [[Dante]]'s [[Dante's Inferno|''Inferno'']], [[William Blake]]'s "Lullaby", [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats']] "[[The Stolen Child]]," "The English Ladye and the Knight" by [[Sir Walter Scott]], and "[[The Highwayman (poem)|The Highwayman]]" by [[Alfred Noyes]].

===Influences===
Before McKennitt composes any music, she engages in considerable research on a specific subject which then forms the general concept of the album. Before creating ''Elemental'' and ''Parallel Dreams'', she travelled to [[Ireland]] for inspiration from the country's history, [[folklore]], geography and culture. The album ''The Mask and Mirror'' was preceded by research in [[Spain]] where she engaged in studying [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a Celtic section of Spain, along with its abundant Arabic roots.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Todd|first1=Douglas|title=Brave Souls: Writers and Artists Wrestle with God, Love, Death, and the Things That Matter|date=1996|publisher=Stoddard Publishing Co. Limited|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=0-7737-5832-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/bravesoulswriter0000todd/page/185 185]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bravesoulswriter0000todd/page/185}}</ref> The result was an album that included elements of Celtic and Arabic music. According to the jacket notes, her album ''An Ancient Muse'' was inspired by travels among and reading about the various cultures along the [[Silk Road]].

===Documentaries===
Late in the 1990s, McKennitt created ''No Journey's End'', a half-hour [[documentary film|documentary]], for [[United States|American]] [[television]] in which she discussed the influences behind her music. ''No Journey's End'' contained excerpts from several songs from the albums ''[[Parallel Dreams]],'' ''[[The Visit (Loreena McKennitt album)|The Visit]]'', and ''[[The Mask and Mirror]]'' It also shows live performances of the songs "The Lady of Shalott", "Santiago", and "The Dark Night of the Soul". It was later released on [[DVD]] and [[VHS]], the former also containing [[music video]]s for "The Mummers' Dance" and "The Bonny Swans." A bonus copy of the DVD was included with the 2004 remastered versions of McKennitt's [[CD]]s.

In 2008, McKennitt released ''A Moveable Musical Feast'', based on her 2007 ''An Ancient Muse'' tour. The DVD included interviews with McKennitt, her band, crew, fans and professional colleagues from the Canadian music industry.

===Court case===
{{Main|McKennitt v Ash}}
In 2005, McKennitt was involved in an acrimonious court case in England when her former friend and employee, Niema Ash, published a book, ''Travels with Loreena McKennitt: My Life as a Friend'', that contained intimate details of their friendship. McKennitt argued that much of the book contained confidential personal information that Ash had no right to publish. The English courts found that there had indeed been a breach of confidence and a misuse of McKennitt's private information, and the case is likely to set important precedents in the law of England and Wales on the privacy of public figures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/21/Loreena-McKennitt.html |work=CBC News |title=Publicity-shy singer wins privacy claim |date=December 21, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526163338/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/21/Loreena-McKennitt.html |archive-date=May 26, 2007 }}</ref> The [[House of Lords]] affirmed the lower court's decisions in 2007.
