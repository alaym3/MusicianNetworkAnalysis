'''The Irish Tenors''' are<!--This article is written in Irish English. Do not change to is!--> a singing trio from Ireland that was started in 1998 by a group of television producers for a [[PBS]] special ''The Irish Tenors''. They have since recorded five PBS specials and eight albums. The group's members are [[Declan Kelly (tenor)|Declan Kelly]], [[Anthony Kearns]] and [[Ronan Tynan]].

==History==
Daniel Harte and Bill Hughes formed the idea of a trio of Irish tenors during the [[Cannes]] film festival.{{when|date=December 2018}} Harte and Hughes wanted to produce a television special and first approached Ireland's [[Finbar Wright]] (one of Ireland's leading romantic tenors) in 1998 to join the group, but Wright's recording contract with [[Sony BMG]] prohibited such a venture. Then they invited Canadian balladeer [[John McDermott (singer)|John McDermott]] to head up the group and he accepted. After conferring with Ireland's leading vocal coach, Dr. [[Veronica Dunne (soprano)|Veronica Dunne]], classically trained singers [[Anthony Kearns]] and [[Ronan Tynan]] were asked to join. In 1999, ''The Irish Tenors: Live in Dublin'' debuted on PBS television in the United States.

PBS signed up for another special by the increasingly popular new group, but early in 2000 McDermott's mother died and he decided he could not fully commit himself to the group. Days before PBS was to film ''The Irish Tenors – Live in Belfast'', Daniel Harte and Hughes again contacted Finbar Wright and asked him to step in. Wright agreed to help and was asked to stay on for upcoming tour dates. Having left Sony, Wright was able to join the trio on a permanent basis. In 2001, the Irish Tenors filmed their third special, an historic PBS broadcast at New York's [[Ellis Island]], hosted by Irish-American actor [[Martin Sheen]]. Their album ''Ellis Island''<ref>Entertainment wire: Business Wire 2001</ref> topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Heatseeker<ref>''Billboard'' magazine 2001</ref> list and landed on its "Top 10 Best of 2001."

The 2005 album ''Sacred'' features Kearns, Wright, and McDermott who rejoined the group temporarily after Ronan Tynan left to pursue a full-time solo career. In 2006, [[Karl Scully]] joined the group, replacing McDermott and Tynan. The increasingly successful blend of voices presented a nine-part television series for Ireland's [[RTÉ]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theirishtenors.info/IrishTenorsandFriendsIndex.htm |title=RTÉ Airs The Irish Tenors & Friends |publisher=Radio Telefís Éireann |access-date=2007-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904134203/http://www.theirishtenors.info/IrishTenorsandFriendsIndex.htm |archive-date=2006-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> entitled ''The Irish Tenors & Friends''. Friends performing on the television special with The Irish Tenors included Lord [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], Paul Carrick, [[The Fureys|Finbar Furey]], [[Hayley Westenra]], [[Shayne Ward]], [[Sharon Shannon]], [[Peter Grant (singer)|Peter Grant]], [[Rebecca Storm]], [[Lucia Evans]], and [[Celine Byrne]]. In 2007, the South Carolina Legislature issued a "Proclamation"<ref>South Carolina Legislature</ref> welcoming the trio to that State at their performance in Charleston.

Scully remained a member of the trio until Tynan's return in 2012. The current trio comprises Kearns, Tynan and Wright, who continue to tour twice annually, typically around [[St. Patrick's Day]] and around the [[Christmas]] holidays.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}
