Dutch rapper [[Ray Slijngaard]] and Dutch vocalist [[Anita Doth]] fronted the act from 1991 to 1996. During the five years of 2 Unlimited's worldwide mainstream success, the act scored a total of 16 chart hits, including "[[Get Ready for This]]", "[[Twilight Zone (2 Unlimited song)|Twilight Zone]]", "[[No Limit (2 Unlimited song)|No Limit]]", and "[[Tribal Dance]]".<ref name="Allmusic"/> They have sold 18 million records worldwide.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Although they enjoyed less mainstream recognition in the United States, many of their songs have become popular themes at American sporting events, particularly in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].

==History==
===Formation===
Jean-Paul De Coster and Phil Wilde met in their hometown of [[Antwerp]], Belgium, and their first collaboration under the name of [[Bizz Nizz]] resulted in a single called "Don't Miss The Party Line" which entered the top 10 in the UK.<ref name="Chartbusters">{{cite magazine|first= Robbert |last= Tilli |title= 2 Unlimited: Common Market Chartbusters |magazine= Billboard |date= 9 March 1996 |volume= 108 |issue= 10 |page= 29 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29 |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref><ref name="eNotes">{{cite web|title= 2 Unlimited |website= [[eNotes]] |url= http://www.enotes.com/2-unlimited-reference/2-unlimited |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121002061310/http://www.enotes.com/2-unlimited-reference/2-unlimited |archive-date= 2 October 2012}}</ref> The two then decided to continue to work together.

Jean-Paul De Coster and Phil Wilde initially had created an instrumental track they called "[[Get Ready for This]]" in May 1991, and they decided that it needed some vocals. De Coster recalls:

{{cquote|That 12-inch single became a club hit, and we invited Ray Slijngaard to have a go at it. We had worked with him on "Money Money", an unreleased single by Bizz Nizz. By September he returned the tape to us. To our surprise, he had also added the female vocals of a certain Anita Doth, a traffic warden from Amsterdam. He told us she was a good friend of his out of the city's nightlife. Ray discussed the possibility of forming a duo to front the project.<ref name="Chartbusters"/>}}

They were so pleased with the result that they agreed to work with them as a duo, and thus 2 Unlimited was born.

===''Get Ready!'' (1991–1992)===
2 Unlimited were signed to [[Byte Records]] (Belgium) and licensed to many other record labels worldwide, including [[Pete Waterman Entertainment|PWL Continental]] in the UK, ZYX in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Scorpio in France, etc.<ref name="Chartbusters"/> Their first single, "Get Ready for This", was well received in their home market, Belgium, where it managed to peak at No. 8. It also peaked at No. 10 in the Netherlands<ref>{{cite web|title= Top 40: 2 Unlimited – Get Ready for This |url= http://www.top40.nl/2-unlimited/2-unlimited-get-ready-for-this_6907 |publisher= [[Dutch Top 40]] |access-date= 15 October 2012}}</ref> and managed to climb to No. 2 in Australia and the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title= Ultratop.be – 2 Unlimited – Get Ready for This |publisher= [[Ultratop]].

A follow-up single, "[[Twilight Zone (2 Unlimited song)|Twilight Zone]]", followed in January 1992, and topped the chart in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|title= Top 40: 2 Unlimited – Twilight Zone |url= http://www.top40.nl/2-unlimited/2-unlimited-twilight-zone_9231 |publisher= Dutch Top 40 |access-date= 15 October 2012}}</ref> It also charted well in numerous markets, reaching No. 2 in the UK.<ref name="OCC"/> In the United States, it peaked at No. 49 on the Hot 100 (and No. 5 on the [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play chart]]).<ref name="Awards"/> To capitalize on this success, the album ''[[Get Ready! (2 Unlimited album)|Get Ready!]]'' was released on 24 February 1992, featuring the first two singles and seven other new tracks, including two ballads. Two further singles were released from the album: "[[Workaholic (song)|Workaholic]]" and "[[The Magic Friend]]". In the US, the album received a [[RIAA certification|Gold certification]] for sales of 500,000 units in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title= RIAA: 2 Unlimited |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date= 15 October 2012 |url= https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=2+unlimited&ti=get+ready}}</ref>

===''No Limits!'' (1993–1994)===
2 Unlimited's lead single from their second album, "[[No Limit (2 Unlimited song)|No Limit]]", was released in January 1993 and the repetitive nature of the song helped it become their most successful single ever, and by far the best remembered by the general public even now. The single topped the charts in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and in the United Kingdom.<ref name="OCC"/><ref>{{cite web|title= Ultratop.be – 2 Unlimited – No Limit |publisher= Ultratop. Hung Medien |access-date= 15 October 2012 |url= http://www.ultratop.be/nl/song/a19/2-Unlimited-No-Limit |language= nl}}</ref> In Germany, it was certified Platinum for sales of 500,000 units.<ref name="Gcert">{{cite certification|region=Germany|artist=2 Unlimited|access-date=15 October 2012}}</ref> The track received modest airplay on North American radio stations, reaching the top 25 in the US Dance charts.<ref name="Awards"/> By 1996, worldwide sales had reached 2.3 million units.<ref name="Chartbusters"/>

"[[Tribal Dance]]" was released as a single shortly before the album ''[[No Limits (2 Unlimited album)|No Limits!]]'' hit the stores in May 1993. It entered the top 5 in Austria, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and in the UK.<ref name="OCC"/><ref>{{cite web|title= Ultratop.be – 2 Unlimited – Tribal Dance |publisher= Ultratop. Hung Medien |access-date= 15 October 2012 |url= http://www.ultratop.be/nl/song/a37/2-Unlimited-Tribal-Dance |language= nl}}</ref> In Germany, "Tribal Dance" was certified Gold for sales of over 250,000 units.<ref name="Gcert"/> Three further singles were issued from the second album: "[[Faces (2 Unlimited song)|Faces]]", which was considerably different in pace to previous releases; "[[Maximum Overdrive (song)|Maximum Overdrive]]"; and a re-recorded version of "[[Let the Beat Control Your Body]]". In France, the title was changed to "Let the Bass Control Your Body" to avoid any confusion with the slang word "[[:fr:wiktionary|bite]]" (meaning "penis").

2 Unlimited's second album proved more successful than its predecessor, entering the top 5 album charts in Austria, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|title= Ultratop.be – 2 Unlimited – No Limits! |publisher= Ultratop. Hung Medien |access-date= 15 October 2012 |url= http://www.ultratop.be/nl/album/64b/2-Unlimited-No-Limits! |language= nl}}</ref> In the UK, the album climbed all the way to the top of the album chart.<ref name="OCC"/> By 1996, its total sales had reached 3 million units, including 592,000 units in the GSA region (Germany, Switzerland, Austria).<ref name="Chartbusters"/><ref name="Chartbusters2">{{cite magazine|first= Robbert |last= Tilli |title= 2 Unlimited: Chartbusters |date= 9 March 1996 |magazine= Billboard |volume= 108 |issue= 10 |page= 34 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>

Despite the phenomenal success the duo were enjoying in the UK, they were criticised heavily by the music industry, and the British press dubbed them "2 Untalented".<ref name="eNotes"/>

===''Real Things'' (1994–1995)===
In May 1994, the duo's tenth single, "[[The Real Thing (2 Unlimited song)|The Real Thing]]", was released, and it proved that their fans were still interested as they sent the single to No. 1 in the Netherlands, as well as the top 5 in Belgium, Germany, and Norway.<ref>{{cite web|title= Ultratop.be – 2 Unlimited – The Real Thing |publisher= Ultratop. Hung Medien |access-date= 15 October 2012 |url= http://www.ultratop.be/nl/song/af5/2-Unlimited-The-Real-Thing |language= nl}}</ref>

While the duo's third album, ''[[Real Things (2 Unlimited album)|Real Things]]'', shot to No. 1 in the Netherlands and the UK, it also managed to land in the top 5 in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.<ref name="OCC"/><ref>{{cite web|title= Ultratop.be – 2 Unlimited – Real Things |publisher= Ultratop. Hung Medien |access-date= 15 October 2012 |url= http://www.ultratop.be/nl/showitem.asp?interpret=2+Unlimited&titel=Real+Things&cat=a |language= nl}}</ref> The record was certified Gold in the UK for sales of over 100,000 units.<ref>{{cite web|title= Certified Awards |publisher= [[British Phonographic Industry]] |access-date= 15 October 2012 |url= http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx}}</ref>

The second single from ''Real Things'', "[[No One (2 Unlimited song)|No One]]", despite being a straightforward pop song, didn't prevent fans from sending it to No. 2 in the Netherlands on the sales chart.<ref>{{cite web|title= Top 40: 2 Unlimited – No One |publisher= Dutch Top 40 |access-date= 15 October 2012 |url= http://www.top40.nl/2-unlimited/2-unlimited-no-one_10779}}</ref>

In March 1995, while the follow-up single, "[[Here I Go (2 Unlimited song)|Here I Go]]", was another top 5 hit in the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite web|title= Top 40: 2 Unlimited – Here I Go |publisher= Dutch Top 40 |url= http://www.top40.nl/2-unlimited/2-unlimited-here-i-go_7474 |access-date= 15 October 2012}}</ref> the band's commercial success seemed to be declining elsewhere as the song made it in the top 20 only in Austria, Belgium, and Sweden. The fourth and final single was the ballad "[[Nothing Like the Rain]]", which was not quite as successful and did not receive a release in many territories, including the UK.

===''Hits Unlimited'' (1995–1996)===
In October 1995, 2 Unlimited released their first compilation album, ''[[Hits Unlimited]]'', prompting rumours that they were about to split up. The first single, "[[Do What's Good for Me]]", entered the top 5 in Finland, and the top 20 in the Netherlands and the UK.<ref name="OCC"/><ref>{{cite web|title= Ultratop.be – 2 Unlimited – Do What's Good for Me |publisher= Ultratop. Hung Medien |access-date= 15 October 2012 |url= http://www.ultratop.be/nl/song/c33/2-Unlimited-Do-What's-Good-For-Me |language= nl}}</ref> Despite their insistence that they were planning a world tour, in April 1996, shortly after the release of the single "[[Jump for Joy (2 Unlimited song)|Jump for Joy]]", both Slijngaard and Doth announced that 2 Unlimited was over.

It later emerged that after having spent so much time together, they were no longer getting on as well as they once had, and there was disagreement about the future sound of band. They had asked for more creative input and they also felt that they were not getting a fair share of the huge amount of money being earned by the project. As no agreement was reached, they each went their separate ways before a final single, "[[Spread Your Love (2 Unlimited song)|Spread Your Love]]", was released in June 1996.

===''II'' (1998–1999)===
As they still owned the rights to the name 2 Unlimited, De Coster and Wilde recruited two new (again Dutch) singers, Romy van Ooijen (b. 18 November 1971) and Marjon van Iwaarden (b. 18 June 1974), in order to capitalise on previous success. The first single released under the new lineup, "[[Wanna Get Up]]", did well in the Netherlands, reaching No. 10. A remix by [[Sash!]], for UK release, reached No. 38.

The album ''[[II (2 Unlimited album)|II]]'' was released in April 1998. It was not as successful as previous studio albums, nor were the subsequent singles, "Edge of Heaven" and "Never Surrender". In 1999, both van Ooijen and van Iwaarden left 2 Unlimited.

===Remixes (2000–2006)===
In 2000, Byte Records released the remix singles "[[No Limit (2 Unlimited song)#Millennium remixes|No Limit]]" and "[[Twilight Zone (Millennium Remixes)|Twilight Zone]]". A remix album was to be released that year, but some master tapes were stolen from Byte and taken to Russia, where they were released as a bootleg compilation. Also that year, 2 Unlimited made their first appearance on the Eurodance compilation ''[[Dancemania]]'' series, specifically its ''[[Dancemania Speed|Speed]]'' sub-series, with their song "Twilight Zone", 'B4 Za Beat Mix'.<ref>{{cite web|title= 2 Unlimited Discography |publisher= [[Discogs]] |url= http://www.discogs.com/artist/4057-2-Unlimited |access-date= 26 July 2014}}</ref>

In 2001, Byte finally released "[[Greatest Hits Remixes]]", featuring many new remixes. Some of the tracks from the stolen master tapes released in Russia were not included. The album was released solely in Japan. In 2002, ''[[Trance Remixes (Special Edition)|Trance Remixes: Special Edition]]'' was released in Japan, featuring many more new remixes not included in the previous compilation.

In the following years, many "best of" compilations have been released in various territories, often with new remixes. Most notably, [[ZYX Music|ZYX Records]] released "[[No Limit (2 Unlimited song)#No Limit 2.3|No Limit 2.3]]" in 2003 and it was a moderate hit, reaching no. 41 in the German singles chart. It was promoted by a new duo, Débora Remagen and James Giscombe.<ref>{{cite web|title= 2 Unlimited existieren nicht mehr |website= Welnet.de |url= http://www.welnet.de/wf/viewtopic.php?t=53&weluser=dancefloor |archive-date= 14 February 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120214052056/http://www.welnet.de/wf/viewtopic.php?t=53&weluser=dancefloor |language= nl}}</ref> They were being lined up as a 2 Unlimited "version 3". They still perform, mainly in Eastern Europe, but are not allowed to use their own voices. This is due to copyright issues.

A new CD and DVD set containing all 2 Unlimited music videos, called ''[[The Complete History (album)|The Complete History]]'', was released in 2004, along with a single, "[[Tribal Dance 2.4]]" (originally released on 12" vinyl in November 2003 as "Tribal Dance 2.3"). 2005 saw the release of ''The Refreshed Album'' in Mexico, featuring stunning artwork, but the same remixes found on previous remix albums. In 2006, the DVD was re-packaged with a different CD, ''[[Greatest Remix Hits (2 Unlimited album)|Greatest Remix Hits]]'', and released in Australia. The following years saw this package re-released in [[Argentina]], Denmark, Sweden, Asia, and South Africa.

===Reunions (2009–2012)===
Having both continued to perform their old hits separately in nightclubs and university student unions around the world, the original performers Slijngaard and Doth reunited on 11 April 2009, to perform together for the first time in 13 years at the "I Love the 90s" concert in [[Hasselt]], Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|title= I love the 90's – The party |website= Ilovethe90s.be |url= http://www.ilovethe90s.be/ |archive-date= 30 March 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100330070842/http://www.ilovethe90s.be/}}</ref> According to a radio interview with Slijngaard, Jean-Paul De Coster did not give permission for the duo to perform under the name 2 Unlimited; however, Phil Wilde attended the gig and provided help with preparing backing tracks.

On 30 April 2009, Slijngaard and Doth performed five songs at the [[538 (radio station)|Radio 538]] Queen's Day concert at Museumplein in Amsterdam. On 8 June, they were awarded "Most Popular Act of the 1990s", based on the number of weeks in the Dutch Top 40; on 25 September, they performed as a support act for [[Milk Inc.]] at the Sportpaleis in Antwerp.

On 29 December 2009, it was announced that the duo would release a new single in 2010, called "In Da Name of Love",<ref>{{cite web|first= Herman |last= Roggeveen |title= Nieuwe single 2 Unlimited heet In Da Name of Love // Nederlandse dj's |publisher= Nlpop |date= 29 December 2009 |access-date= 4 April 2010 |url= http://nlpop.blog.nl/nederlandse-djs/2009/12/29/nieuwe-single-2-unlimited-heet-in-da-name-of-love |language= nl}}</ref> as [[Ray & Anita]]. It was released as a CD single in the Netherlands through Spinnin' Records on 22 January 2010. It reached No. 6 on the Dutch Top 40 sales chart.<ref>{{cite web|title= Top 40: Ray & Anita - In Da Name Of Love |publisher= Dutch Top 40 |url= http://www.top40.nl/ray-anita/ray-anita-in-da-name-of-love_20943 |access-date= 15 October 2012}}</ref> On 30 April 2010, a new single was presented during the Dutch Queen's Day, called "Still Unlimited".

In July 2011, Ray & Anita invited fans to be part of the video for "Nothing 2 Lose" in Amsterdam. Fans applied via email and were selected randomly. The video with the fans was shot on 28 July.<ref>{{cite web|title= "Ray & Anita" (2Unlimited) "Nothing 2 Lose" directors cut. |publisher= [[Vimeo]] |access-date= 26 July 2014 |url= http://vimeo.com/32842759}}</ref> The single was released at the end of August 2011. The single is also the lead track for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Amsterdam Heavy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title= Payback: The Amsterdam Ultimatum (2011) – "Amsterdam Heavy" (original title) |publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date= 26 July 2014 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740468/}}</ref> In the same month, Ray & Anita headlined the "I Love the 90's" stage at [[Tomorrowland]] in Belgium.

===Comeback (2012–2016)===
[[File:2 Unlimited - 2016332014935 2016-11-26 Sunshine Live - Die 90er Live on Stage - Sven - 1D X - 0787 - DV3P3844 mod.jpg|thumb|220px|Ray & Anita live, 2016]]
On 11 July 2012, it was announced that Ray & Anita would be working again with Belgian producer De Coster under the name 2 Unlimited.<ref>{{cite news|title= 2 Unlimited herleeft |newspaper= [[De Telegraaf]] |date= 11 July 2012 |access-date= 19 October 2013 |url= http://www.telegraaf.nl/filmenuitgaan/muziek/article20790510.ece |language= nl}}</ref>

On 30 March 2013, Slijngaard and Doth performed their first full concert as 2 Unlimited with their band in Belgium at [[Sportpaleis|Antwerps Sportpaleis]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Breaking News: 2 Unlimited – Live in Concert – World Premiere! |website= 2unlimitedlive.com |date= 30 March 2013 |access-date= 19 October 2013 |url= http://www.2unlimitedlive.com/news/article/breaking-news-2-unlimited-live-in-concert |archive-date= 1 December 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033441/http://www.2unlimitedlive.com/news/article/breaking-news-2-unlimited-live-in-concert |url-status= dead}}</ref>

The duo released a remixed version of their very first single, "[[Get Ready for This]]", on 28 October 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title= Get Ready (Steve Aoki Edit) |publisher= [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.co.uk]] |access-date= 19 October 2013 |url= https://www.amazon.co.uk/Get-Ready-Steve-Aoki-Edit/dp/B00F03FHNC}}</ref> The song was remixed by DJ [[Steve Aoki]] and was included on their ''Greatest Hits'' album.

In 2014, 2 Unlimited gave concerts at ten festivals that together made up [[Acceleration 2014]], which combined top class car and bike racing with music and entertainment.

On 20 April 2016, 2 Unlimited announced that Doth was leaving the band at the end of 2016 to embark on a solo career.<ref>{{cite news|title= Anita Doth neemt afscheid van 2 Unlimited |publisher= [[NU.nl]] |date= 20 April 2016 |access-date= 23 April 2016 |url= http://www.nu.nl/muziek/4250167/anita-doth-neemt-afscheid-van-2-unlimited.html |language= nl}}</ref> Doth was to be replaced by another singer, whose identity was not revealed right away.<ref>{{cite news|title= Anita Doth solo verder |newspaper= [[De Telegraaf]] |date= 23 July 2016 |access-date= 23 July 2016 |url= http://www.telegraaf.nl/prive/26279020/__Anita_Doth_solo_verder__.html |language= nl}}</ref>
