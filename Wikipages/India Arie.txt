==Background==
India was born in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], the daughter of Joyce and [[Ralph Simpson]]. Her musical skills were encouraged by both parents in her younger years.

After Simpson's parents divorced, her mother moved the family to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] when India was 13.<ref name="mtvmusic"/> Simpson had taken up a succession of musical instruments throughout her schooling in Denver, but her interest in the [[guitar]] while attending the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]], in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], led to a personal revelation about songwriting and performing. "When I started tapping into my own sensitivity, I started to understand people better. It was a direct result of writing songs", she said at the press release of her debut album, ''[[Acoustic Soul]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | title = About the Performer: India.Arie | work = laphil.com | publisher = Los Angeles Philharmonic Association | access-date = 4 February 2018 | url = https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/indiaarie }}</ref>

Co-founding the Atlanta-based [[indie (music)|independent music]] collective Groovement EarthShare (Groovement was the collective artists' name and EarthShare was their independent label name), her one-song turn on a locally released compilation led to a second-stage gig at the 1998 [[Lilith Fair]]. In 1999, a [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal]]/Motown music scout signed her and made an introduction to former [[Motown]] CEO [[Kedar Massenburg]]. Arie resides in [[New York City]].
