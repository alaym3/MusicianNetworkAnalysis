== History ==
===2006–2007: Formation===
The original band members have known each other since they were ten years old, all of them being from Middleton; Liam Fray and Daniel Moores attended [[Cardinal Langley Roman Catholic High School]] in Middleton, while Mark Cuppello attended [[St Monica's High School|St Monica's RC High School]] in [[Prestwich]] and Michael Campbell attended [[St Cuthbert's RC High School]] in [[Rochdale]].

At first Fray studied business studies at university, however soon realised it was a lot harder than he thought and not what he wanted to do. Therefore, he chose to study creative writing as he enjoyed writing poetry and short stories, but not reading. While at the [[University of Salford]] (studying creative writing), Fray started performing acoustic sets as a singer-songwriter around bars and at open-mic nights in Manchester. After getting positive reactions from the crowd, Fray decided to leave university and form a band. He recruited long-time friend and neighbour Michael Campbell, who had never played the drums before. They played as 'Liam Fray' until Moores and Cuppello joined the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discover.drownedinsound.com/articles/2473988|title=Drowned in Sound interview|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618175011/http://discover.drownedinsound.com/articles/2473988|archive-date=18 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Their first gig was at the [[Manchester Roadhouse]] in October 2006, and the band went from strength to strength in Manchester, largely through a word-of-mouth following brought on by extensive gigging and television publicity.
