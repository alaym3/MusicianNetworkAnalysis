'''Buena Vista Social Club''' is an ensemble of Cuban musicians established in 1996. The project was organized by [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit]] executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist [[Ry Cooder]] and directed by [[Juan de Marcos González]]. They named the group after the homonymous [[Social club|members' club]] in the [[Buenavista, Havana|Buenavista]] quarter of [[Havana]], a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as [[son cubano|son]], [[bolero]] and [[danzón]], they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many of whom had been retired for many years.

The group's [[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|eponymous album]] was recorded in March 1996 and released in September 1997, quickly becoming an international success, which prompted the ensemble to perform with a full line-up in [[Amsterdam]] and [[New York City|New York]] in 1998. German director [[Wim Wenders]] captured the performance on film for a [[Documentary film|documentary]]—also called ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]''—that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film was released in June 1999 to critical acclaim, receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary feature]] and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the [[European Film Awards]]. This was followed up by a second documentary ''[[Buena Vista Social Club: Adios]]'' in 2017.

The success of both the album and film sparked a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and [[Latin American music]] in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with stars from different musical genres. The "Buena Vista Social Club" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's "musical golden age" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: [[Compay Segundo]], [[Rubén González (pianist)|Rubén González]], and [[Ibrahim Ferrer]], who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Compay Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.

Several surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as tresero [[Eliades Ochoa]], veteran singer [[Omara Portuondo]], trumpeter [[Manuel "Guajiro" Mirabal]], [[laúd]] player [[Barbarito Torres]] and trombonist and conductor [[Jesús "Aguaje" Ramos]] currently tour worldwide, to popular acclaim, with new members such as singer Carlos Calunga and pianist Rolando Luna,<ref>[http://www.soycubano.com/pena/musica/rolando_lunai.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021013357/http://www.soycubano.com/pena/musica/rolando_lunai.asp |date=21 October 2007 }}</ref> as part of a 13-member band called '''Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club'''.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20050907113021/http://www.worldcircuit.co.uk/#ORQUESTA_BUENA_VISTA_SOCIAL_CLUB%C3%82%C2%AE::Biography]</ref>

==The original Buenavista Social Club==
[[File:Buenavista Social Club site.jpg|300px|thumb|Abandoned building in Almendares, Marianao, that housed the Buenavista Social Club in the 1940s.]]
The Buenavista Social Club was a members-only club originally located in Buenavista (literally ''fair view''), a quarter in the current neighbourhood of [[Playa, Havana|Playa]] (before 1976 part of [[Marianao]]), one of the 15 municipalities in Cuba's capital, [[Havana]]. The original club was founded in 1932 in a small wooden venue at ''calle Consulado y pasaje "A"'' (currently ''calle 29, n. 6007'').<ref name="RL">{{cite news|last1=Lam|first1=Rafael|title=Buscando la sociedad Buena Vista Social Club|url=http://www.granma.cu/cultura/2015-07-03/buscando-la-sociedad-buena-vista-social-club|access-date=24 September 2017|work=[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]|date=3 July 2015|language=es}}</ref> In 1939, due to lack of space the club relocated to number 4610 on Avenue 31, between ''calles'' 46 and 48, in Almendares, Marianao.<ref name="RL" /> This location is recalled by Juan Cruz, former director of the Marianao Social Club and [[master of ceremonies]] at the Salón Rosado de la Tropical (other nightclubs in Havana).<ref name="afro Cuban">Godfried, Eugène.

At the time, clubs in Cuba were segregated; there were ''sociedades de blancos'' (white societies), ''sociedades de negros'' (black societies), etc. The Buenavista Social Club operated as a black society, which was rooted in a [[cabildo (Cuba)|cabildo]]. Cabildos were [[Fraternal and service organizations|fraternities]] organized during the 19th century by African slaves. The existence of many other black societies such as Marianao Social Club, Unión Fraternal, Club Atenas (whose members included doctors and engineers), and Buenavista Social Club, exemplified the remnants of [[Institutional racism|institutionalized]] racial discrimination against [[Afro-Cubans]].<ref name="afro Cuban"/><ref name="Eugene">Godfried, Eugène.

At the Buena Vista Social Club, musicians went there to hang out with each other, like they used to do at musicians' unions in the U.S., and they'd have dances and activities.<ref name="interview"/>}}

As a music venue, the Buenavista Social Club experienced the peak of Havana's nightclub life, when ''[[Charanga (Cuba)|charangas]]'' and ''[[Conjunto#Cuban conjunto|conjuntos]]'' played several sets every night, going from club to club over the course of a week. Often, bands would dedicate songs to the clubs where they played. In the case of the Buenavista Social Club, an eponymous danzón was composed by [[Cachao|Israel López "Cachao"]] in 1938, and performed with [[Arcaño y sus Maravillas]]. In addition, [[Arsenio Rodríguez]] dedicated "Buenavista en guaguancó" to the same place. Together with Orquesta Melodías del 40, the Maravillas and Arsenio's conjunto were known as ''Los Tres Grandes'' (The Big Three), drawing the largest audiences wherever they played.<ref name="Sublette">{{cite book|last1=Sublette|first1=Ned|title=Cuba and Its Music: From the First Drums to the Mambo|url=https://archive.org/details/cubaitsmusicfrom00subl|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago, IL|page=[https://archive.org/details/cubaitsmusicfrom00subl/page/495 495]|isbn=9781556525162}}</ref> These vibrant times in Havana were described by pianist [[Rubén González (pianist)|Rubén González]], who played in Arsenio's conjunto, as "an era of real musical life in Cuba, when there was very little money to earn, but everyone played because they really wanted to".<ref name=Nonesuch>[http://www.nonesuch.com/Hi_Band/index_frameset2.cfm?pointer=buena_vista.gif ''Buena Vista Social Club''.

=== After the Revolution ===
Shortly after the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, newly elected [[List of Presidents of Cuba|Cuban President]] [[Manuel Urrutia Lleó]], a devout Christian, began a program of closing gambling outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments associated with Havana's hedonistic lifestyle. This had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of local entertainers.<ref>Quirk, Robert E. ''Fidel Castro''. W. W. Norton & Company; New Ed edition (August 1995). p229. {{ISBN|0-393-31327-1}}</ref> As the Cuban government rapidly shifted towards the [[left wing|left]] in an effort to build a "classless and colourblind society", it struggled to define policy toward forms of cultural expression in the black community; expressions which had implicitly emphasized cultural differences.<ref>Moore, Robin. ''Black Music in a Raceless Society: Afrocuban Folklore and Socialism''. Cuban Studies - Volume 37, 2006. University of Pittsburgh Press. pp. 1–32.</ref> Consequently, the cultural and social centers were abolished, including the Afro-Cuban mutual aid ''Sociedades de Color'' in 1962, to make way for racially integrated societies.<ref name="afro Cuban"/><ref>Segal, Ronald. ''The Black diaspora'', Noonday Press, 1999. p.235. {{ISBN|0374524904}}</ref> Private festivities were limited to weekend parties and organizers' funds were confiscated.<ref>Gott, Richard. ''Cuba, A New History''. Yale Nota Bene; New Ed edition (11 November 2005). p.174. {{ISBN|0-300-10411-1}}</ref> The measures meant the closure of the Buena Vista Social Club.<ref name="Eugene"/> Although the Cuban government continued to support traditional music after the revolution, certain favor was given to the politically charged [[nueva trova]], and poetic singer-songwriters such as [[Silvio Rodríguez]] and [[Pablo Milanés]]. The emergence of pop music and [[salsa music|salsa]], a style derived from Cuban music but developed in the United States, meant that [[Son (music)|son music]] became even less common.<ref name="global"/>

Cuban music experienced quite a radical change in the 1960s, as [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] notes:

<blockquote>Cuban dance music also witnessed dramatic change beginning in the late 1960s, as groups explored the fusion of Cuban son with American rock, jazz and funk styles. Groups such as Los Van Van and Irakere established modern forms of Cuban music, paving the way for new rhythms and dances to emerge as well as fresh concepts in instrumentation. ... Cuba's dance music had already inspired a change from the older son-style dances, as younger Cubans broke free of step-oriented dances...<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/country/content.country/cuba_11 |title=Cuba : National Geographic World Music |publisher=Worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com |date=2002-10-17 |access-date=2013-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115034914/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/country/content.country/cuba_11/ |archive-date=15 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>

The occurrence of these closures and the change in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.

In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder had been invited to Havana by British [[world music]] [[Record producer|producer]] Nick Gold of [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit Records]] to record a session in which African musicians from [[Mali]] were to collaborate with Cuban musicians.<ref name="interview"/> On Cooder's arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba]]),<ref name="telegraph">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071112034518/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F1997%2F06%2F28%2Fbrcuba28.xml "Hurricane Cooder hits Cuba"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (June 1997). Retrieved 20 March 2007.</ref> it transpired that the musicians from Mali had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban [[Son cubano|son]] music with local musicians.<ref name="interview"/>

Already on board the African collaboration project were Cuban musicians including bassist [[Orlando "Cachaíto" López]], guitarist [[Eliades Ochoa]] and musical director [[Juan de Marcos González]], who had himself been organizing a similar project for the [[Afro-Cuban All Stars]]. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer [[Manuel "Puntillita" Licea]], pianist Rubén González and octogenarian singer [[Compay Segundo]], who all agreed to record for the project.<ref name="interview"/>

Within three days of the project's birth, Cooder, Gold and de Marcos had organized a large group of performers and arranged for recording sessions to commence at Havana's [[EGREM]] Studios, formerly owned by [[RCA]] records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s.<ref>Steward, Sue.

The album was recorded in just six days and contained fourteen tracks; opening with "[[Chan Chan (song)|Chan Chan]]" written by Compay Segundo, a four chord [[Son Cubano (music)|son]] that was to become what Cooder described as "the Buena Vista's calling card";<ref name="segundo">[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,999647,00.html "Life began at ninety"] Guardian Unlimited (17 July 2003).

One of the songs that featured on the album was "Buena Vista Social Club", a danzón written by [[Orestes López]], the father of bass player "Cachaíto".<ref name="interview"/> The song spotlighted the piano work of Rubén González and it was recorded after Cooder heard González improvising around the tune's musical theme before a day's recording session.

According to Cooder, {{quotation|It should be the thing that sets it apart. It was a kind of club by then. Everybody was hanging out and we had rum and coffee around two in the afternoon.

Shortly after returning from Havana to record the ''Buena Vista Social Club'' album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director [[Wim Wenders]] on the soundtrack to Wenders' film ''[[The End of Violence]]'', the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it was an effort to force Cooder to focus on the project, "He always sort of looked in the distance and smiled, and I knew he was back in Havana."<ref name="film">Rose, Charlie.

Wenders filmed the recording sessions on the recently enhanced format [[Digital Video]] with the help of [[cinematographer]] Robert Müller, and then shot interviews with each "Buena Vista" ensemble member in different Havana locations.<ref name="film"/> Wenders was also present to film the group's first performance with a full line-up in [[Amsterdam]] in April 1998 (two nights) and a second time in [[Carnegie Hall]], New York City on 1 July 1998. The completed documentary was released on 17 September 1999, and included scenes in New York of the Cubans, some of whom had never left the island, window shopping and visiting tourist sites. According to [[Sight & Sound|Sight & Sound magazine]], these scenes of "innocents abroad" were the film's most moving moments, as the contrasts between societies of Havana and New York become evident on the faces of the performers. Ferrer, from an impoverished background and staunchly [[Consumerism|anti consumerist]], was shown describing the city as "beautiful" and finding the experience overwhelming.<ref name="Sight">[http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/211 ''Buena Vista Social Club'' (film) reviewed by Peter Curren.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018165301/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/211 |date=18 October 2007 }} [[Sight and Sound]] (October 1999).

The first performances by the full line up of Buena Vista Social Club, including Cooder, were those filmed by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York. Other international shows and T.V. appearances soon followed with varying line ups. Ibrahim Ferrer and Rubén González performed together in Los Angeles in 1998 to an audience that included [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Sean Combs]], and [[Jennifer Lopez]], Ferrer dedicating the song ''Mami Me Gusto'' to the [[Hispanic]] Lopez.<ref>Milanovic Anji.

Performances in Florida, which has a large [[Cuban exile]] and [[Cuban American]] community, were rare after the release of the film due to the political climate.

The international success of the Buena Vista Social Club generated a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and [[Latin American music]] as a whole.<ref name="Torres">Torres, George. "Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz (review)". ''Notes'', Volume 60, Number 2, December 2003, pp. 426–428.</ref> Musical director Juan de Marcos felt that the recordings serve "as a symbol of the power of Cuban music, and which to a certain degree have contributed to Cuban music regaining the status it always had in Latin American and world music."<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/buenavista/musicians/bios/demarcos_edited_int_eng.html "Interview with Juan de Marco González in Havana, by Betty Arcos, host, "The Global Village" Pacifica Radio 1 January 1998"].

Cuba's burgeoning [[Tourism in Cuba|tourist industry]] of the late 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to ''[[The Economist]]'', "In the tourist quarters of [[Old Havana]] it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's as if you were to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner."<ref>[http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displayStory.cfm?story_ID=8401940&subjectid=7933598 "Now we make politics".] ''[[The Economist]]'' (15 December 2006). Retrieved 23 March 2007.</ref> The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street. Despite the appeal of the "Buena Vista" ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the "Buena Vista Social Club" than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern [[Timba]], [[Songo music|Songo]] and other musical forms on the island. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.<ref name="global">Santiago, Chiori.

Mari Marques, a Cuban American who leads cultural tours to Cuba, contests that the preponderance of traditional musicians was not solely a consequence of the "Buena Vista Social Club". Marques believes the notion that some music had been completely neglected in Cuba is "a romantic exaggeration that was propagated by U.S. media coverage", and the reality is that son trios have existed "everywhere in cities such as [[Santiago de Cuba]] in the east of the island."<ref name="global"/> British world music record label [[Tumi Music]], who had worked with de Marcos and many of the ensemble musicians prior to Cooder, asserted that Cuba has over 50,000 musicians, all as good as, and some as old as the "Buena Vista" participants, "but these people hardly ever have the opportunity to share their talents with the outside world." The label lamented that, "for the West to pay any real attention and consume the product, you needed someone like Ry Cooder to give it a stamp of approval first."<ref>[http://www.tumimusic.com/english/newsletter.htm "Tumi celebrate their 100th recording after two decades dedicated to bringing Latin American music, arts and culture to Europe."] Tumi music.

British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] member and [[Marxist]] writer [[Mike Gonzalez (historian)|Mike Gonzalez]] believes the ensemble provoked a backward glance to "timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music". Gonzalez asserts that the aura evoked did not represent "the real Cuba" before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to "enjoy the fruits of this confusion".<ref>Gonzalez, Mike.

Retrieved 23 March 2007.</ref> The [[American Historical Review]] suggested that the ''Buena Vista Social Club'''s [[mise en scène]] fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States who remember the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era—dominated by the politics of [[Gerardo Machado]] in the 1920s–30s and then General [[Fulgencio Batista]] until 1959—which "no longer seems so bad".<ref>[http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.2/mr_4.html ''Buena Vista Social Club'' Film review].
