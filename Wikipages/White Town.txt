==Early life==
Jyoti Prakash Mishra was born in [[Rourkela]] on 30 July 1966, and emigrated to England with his family at the age of three. He grew up in [[Derby]].<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=425}}</ref>

==Career==
White Town was originally the name of a band formed by Mishra in 1989, inspired by a [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] concert he had attended. Initially, there were other members on guitar, bass, and drums; they played support gigs for various bands, most notably [[Primal Scream]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1990, the project released its first self-financed record, ''White Town EP'', on 7" vinyl. This featured Nick Glyn-Davies on drums and Sean Deegan on bass, with Mishra on guitar and vocals. Sean Phillips, who is credited as a guitarist on the EP, joined the band shortly before the release. In time, Deegan and Glyn-Davies left and were replaced live by a drum machine and Leon Wilson on guitar. The rest of the band drifted away in the autumn of 1990, and Mishra continued with the project as a one-man band from then on, occasionally collaborating with musicians such as Gary Thatcher of [[the Beekeepers]] on guitar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

The lead single from White Town's second album, ''[[Women in Technology (album)|Women in Technology]]'', titled "[[Your Woman]]", reached No. 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1997.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /> It also peaked at No. 1 in Spain and Iceland; No. 2 in Australia; No. 4 in Canada, Denmark, and Finland; and No. 23 on the U.S. Pop Airplay chart.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} After a troubled working relationship with EMI, Mishra was dropped from the label in 1997.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Since then, he has gone back to working with indie labels such as Parasol Records. In 2006, he contributed the song "The [[Project for the New American Century|PNAC]] Cabal" to the charity album ''Voyces United for UNHCR''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

The EP ''A New Surprise'' was released in September 2006 by Swedish indie label Heavenly Pop Hits, and was followed by the album ''[[Don't Mention the War]]'', which launched Mishra's own Bzangy Records label. A 7" White Town single titled "I Wanna Be Your Ex", with the B-side "Rainy Day", was released by Golly Jane Records in November 2014. Mishra released the albums ''Deemab'' and ''Polyamory'' in 2019. As of March 2020, he accumulates over 500,000 [[Spotify]] streams per month; his work received a boost in popularity in 2020 when [[Dua Lipa]] sampled the same trumpet hook White Town sampled in "Your Woman" in her hit song "[[Love Again (Dua Lipa song)|Love Again]]".<ref name="Sample 2020">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/columns/pop/9346247/white-town-dua-lipa-sample-your-woman-love-again|title=White Town's Jyoti Mishra on Dua Lipa Lifting 'Your Woman' Hook For 'Love Again': 'There's Magic in Old Samples'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Jefferson|first=J'na|date=30 March 2020|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>

==Artistry==
Mishra has said, "I'm a mediocre singer, I'm a terrible guitarist, I'm a pretty good keyboardist, I'm a good producer, not amazing, but good."<ref name="Sample 2020" /> Noting his status as a [[one-hit wonder]], he said it is "better than a no-hit wonder" and elaborated, "To be a professional musician and to be entertaining people twenty years after my biggest hit, I feel like I'm the luckiest person alive. Just to have one song that connects with people—most musicians dream their entire lives of having that."<ref name="Sample 2020" />

==Personal life==
Mishra became [[straight edge]] at the age of sixteen and is a radical [[Marxist]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Lester|first=Paul|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/21/devo-white-town-babybird-what-happens-when-your-cult-pop-band-gets-huge|title=Devo, White Town, Babybird: what happens when your cult pop band gets huge?|date=2016-01-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> He has been outspoken about his beliefs.<ref name=dazed>{{cite web|access-date=26 March 2018|magazine=[[Dazed]]|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/34617/1/white-town-your-woman-number-one-1997|title=Remembering one of the UK's unlikeliest number one singles|publication-date=8 February 2017|first=Selim |last=Bulut|date=8 February 2017}}</ref>
