'''Voivod''' is a Canadian [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Jonquière]], [[Quebec]] (now [[Saguenay, Quebec]]). The band's current line-up consists of [[Denis Bélanger|Denis "Snake" Bélanger]] (vocals), [[Daniel Mongrain|Daniel "Chewy" Mongrain]] (guitar),  Dominic "Rocky" Laroche (bass) and [[Michel Langevin|Michel "Away" Langevin]] (drums). Their musical style has changed several times since the band's origin in the early 1980s. Starting out as a [[speed metal]] band, Voivod have added a mix of [[progressive metal]] and [[thrash metal]] to create their own unique metal style, and they are credited as one of the "big four" Canadian thrash metal bands, along with [[Sacrifice (band)|Sacrifice]], [[Razor (band)|Razor]], and [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/13-canadian-metal-albums-everyone-should-own/|title=13 Canadian Metal Albums Everyone Should Own|publisher=[[Kerrang!]]|date=May 2, 2018|access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref>

Since 1982, when it was co-founded by guitarist [[Denis D'Amour|Denis "Piggy" D'Amour]], Voivod have released fourteen studio albums, as well as one EP, one live album, two compilations, seven demos and one DVD featuring a live concert. The band found mainstream success in the late 1980s with their fifth studio album ''[[Nothingface (Voivod album)|Nothingface]]'' (1989), which is Voivod's only album to enter the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts, peaking at number 114.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/voivod/chart-history|title=Voivod Chart History|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref> The band won the "Visionary" award at the 2017 [[Prog (magazine)|Progressive Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/marillion-anathema-steve-hackett-among-progressive-music-award-winners|title=Marillion, Anathema, Steve Hackett among Progressive Music Award winners|last=Munro|first=Scott|date=September 15, 2017|website=[[Prog (magazine)|Prog Magazine]]|access-date=September 25, 2017}}</ref> Voivod's most recent studio album, ''[[The Wake (Voivod album)|The Wake]]'', was released in September 2018.

==History==

===Initial career (1982–1990)===
[[File:Voivod 4.gif|thumb|right|225px|The original Voivod lineup in a 1986 promotional photo. From left to right: [[Michel Langevin|Away]], [[Denis D'Amour|Piggy]], [[Jean-Yves Thériault|Blacky]] and [[Denis Bélanger|Snake]].]]

Voivod was formed in 1982 in [[Jonquière]], [[Quebec]], Canada. Influenced equally by the [[new wave of British heavy metal]], the burgeoning [[hardcore punk]] scene and 1970s [[progressive rock]], Voivod forged a distinctive brand of heavy music that often relied on lyrical themes such as [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era [[Cold War]] politics, post-apocalyptic literature and [[science fiction]]. ''[[Killing Technology]]'' (1987) began the band's evolution in earnest, with the character from Voivod's album covers (drawn by drummer Away and named as "Korgull" on 1986's ''[[Rrröööaaarrr]]'') significantly being depicted in a spaceship. Drawing more heavily on hardcore punk than metal influences by this point,<ref>''Terrorizer'' No. 168, February 2008</ref> Voivod began evolving without the aid of increasing speed and storytelling on the following ''Dimension Hatross''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/heavy-metal/|title=Heavy Metal|last=Mazer|first=Jacob|date=June 25, 2013|website=[[Joyful Noise Recordings]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707142728/http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/heavy-metal/|archive-date=July 7, 2013|access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref> Voivod was one of the first thrash bands from Canada to gain popularity outside of their country's borders, reaching the peak of their global popularity with the 1989 album ''[[Nothingface (Voivod album)|Nothingface]]'' which featured a cover version of [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Astronomy Domine]]".<ref name="am">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/voivod-mn0000186096/biography|title=Voivod {{!}} Biography & History|last=Book|first=John|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref> Other covers include Pink Floyd's "[[The Nile Song]]" on their 1993 album ''The Outer Limits'' and "[[21st Century Schizoid Man]]" by [[King Crimson]] on ''Phobos''. Much of the band's sound comes from guitarist Piggy's use of dissonant chords, usually played in the high register of the guitar, used extensively on ''Nothingface''. Albums like ''[[Dimension Hatröss]]'' are dominated by unexpected time signatures and guitarist Piggy's liberal use of dissonant, unconventional minor chords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/canada/quebec/jonquiere/voivod|title=Voivod|website=[[MusicMight]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205827/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/canada/quebec/jonquiere/voivod|archive-date=March 3, 2016|access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref>

===Departures of Blacky and Snake, and Eric Forrest-era (1991–2000)===
Two of the four founding members (bassist [[Jean-Yves Thériault]] and vocalist [[Denis Bélanger]]) left Voivod in the early 1990s. Jean-Yves co-founded The Holy Body Tattoo an avant-garde modern dance company based in Vancouver BC and also wrote extensively all the music for it, as well as other electronic music projects, while Denis Belanger isolated himself and eventually started a new project, Union Made. Meanwhile, the band recorded four albums as a trio in the mid-to-late 1990s with new member [[Eric Forrest]], nicknamed "E-Force", handling both vocals and bass guitar. Forrest was seriously injured in a car accident in [[Germany]] in 1998, and that incarnation of Voivod never regained the momentum they lost during his rehabilitation. After [[Eric Forrest]] left the band, his insurance company attempted to sue the band for the injuries he sustained in the crash, as he was in the care of the band at the time.

===Reunion with Snake, arrival of Jasonic, death of Piggy (2001–2006)===
Voivod briefly disbanded in 2001 before Bélanger returned to the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/voivod_cannot_be_silenced|title=Voivod Cannot Be Silenced|last=Wiebe Taylor|first=Laura|date=January 1, 2006|website=[[Exclaim!]]|access-date=March 3, 2011}}</ref> The next incarnation of Voivod featured three of the four founding members: [[Denis Bélanger]] (a.k.a. "Snake"; vocals), [[Denis D'Amour]] ("Piggy"; guitars), and [[Michel Langevin]] ("Away"; drums) along with [[Jason Newsted]] ("Jasonic", of [[Metallica]]) on bass guitar. The album ''Voivod'' was released in 2003. Guitarist Denis D'Amour died at the age of 45 on August 26, 2005 due to complications from [[colon cancer]]. In July 2006 they released ''Katorz'', based around riffs found on the laptop of D'Amour. Just prior to his death, he left instructions for his bandmates on how to use them. In November 2006, the song "X-Stream" was featured on ''[[Guitar Hero II]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/voivod-releases-a-twelfth-album/article4278763/|title=Voivod releases a twelfth album|last=Collins|first=Robert|date=June 23, 2009|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref>[[File:Voivod 1.png|thumb|right|225px|Voivod performing in 2009]]

===''Infini'', return of Blacky (2007–2009)===
Voivod were planning to work on what was to be their final studio album in late 2007, which contained tracks recorded with D'Amour before his death. Voivod was part of the Heavy MTL show that was held in [[Montreal]] on June 22, 2008. Voivod also performed at the Monsters of Rock Festival in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], on July 26, 2008, and supported Judas Priest at the [[Bell Centre]] in Montreal, on August 12, 2008. Voivod also played a full set at Thrash Domination in Kawasaki, Japan, September 20–21, 2008, along with the bands [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]]. The band consisted of Bélanger, Langevin, a returning 'Blacky' Thériault, and [[Dan Mongrain]] on guitar.

In early January 2009, Voivod announced that they were putting the finishing touches on their new album and expected to release it in the spring of that year. The album, now known as ''[[Infini (album)|Infini]]'', was released on June 23, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/voivod-to_infini_beyond|title=Voivod To Infini and Beyond|last=Pratt|first=Greg|date=July 24, 2009|website=[[Exclaim!]]|access-date=April 3, 2010}}</ref>

===''Target Earth'' (2010–2013)===
By July 2010, Voivod had been writing and recording new music (including Dan Mongrain on guitar). On July 4, 2012, Voivod announced the title of their thirteenth studio album, ''[[Target Earth (album)|Target Earth]]'', which was released on January 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/voivod-new-album-title-band-logo-unveiled/|title=VOIVOD: New Album Title, Band Logo Unveiled|date=July 4, 2012|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=July 4, 2012}}</ref> ''Target Earth'' has a more progressive sound than some of their last few albums, and is a return to a more "classic" Voivod sound that can be heard on ''Dimension Hatross'' and ''Nothingface''. All the music was written by Blacky and Chewy, while Snake focused on lyrics, and Away took care of the artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/voivod-away_mission_2|title=Voivod Away Mission|last=Pratt|first=Greg|date=February 8, 2013|website=[[Exclaim!]]|access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref>

===Second departure of Blacky, ''Post Society,'' and ''The Wake'' (2014–present)===
On July 10, 2014, it was reported that Blacky had left Voivod again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/voivod-parts-ways-with-bassist-jean-yves-blacky-theriault/|title=Voivod Parts Ways With Bassist Jean Yves 'Blacky' Theriault|date=July 10, 2014|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=July 10, 2014}}</ref> It was announced that he was forced out of the band.  For months he requested meetings regarding the band business and artistic affairs, but was denied such talks by one of the other members. In late January 2015 the band released the new single "We Are Connected" which is the lead track from the 7-inch split vinyl disc with the band [[At the Gates]]. It is the first music to feature new bassist Dominic "Rocky" Laroche. They also released a new, five-track EP, entitled ''[[Post Society]]'', featuring two new tracks and a cover of [[Hawkwind]]'s "[[Silver Machine]]", on February 26, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/voivod-to-release-post-society-ep-in-february/|title=Voivod To Release 'Post Society' EP In February|date=December 23, 2015|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=December 23, 2015}}</ref>

As early as February 2015, Voivod began work on their fourteenth studio album, which was to be released in 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/away-new-voivod-album-to-arrive-in-2016/|title=Away: New Voivod Album To Arrive In 2016|date=February 18, 2015|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=May 20, 2015}}</ref> but later pushed back to 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joelgausten.com/2016/02/voivod-lives-michel-away-langevin-on.html|title=Voivod Lives: Michel "Away" Langevin on Lineups, Lemmy and Keeping the Band Alive|last=Gausten|first=Joel|date=February 4, 2016|website=Joel Gausten|access-date=February 6, 2016}}</ref> The band was expected to begin recording the album in August 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/voivod-to-record-new-album-in-august/|title=VOIVOD To Record New Album In August|date=April 28, 2017|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref> In June 2017, Langevin told Rock Sverige that the songwriting was almost completed with an estimated release for early 2018. He also said that the album would probably be a double-album on vinyl due to the songs being "really long and progressive", describing them as "seven or eight minutes long songs" and with it being a concept album as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/voivod-drummer-discusses-progressive-next-album-pays-tribute-to-chris-cornell/|title=VOIVOD Drummer Discusses 'Progressive' Next Album, Pays Tribute To CHRIS CORNELL|date=June 26, 2017|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=June 26, 2017}}</ref> In November 2017, the Voivod members began recording another album,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=137928|title=Voivod Begins Recording New Album|last=Oz|first=Diamond|date=November 6, 2017|website=Metal Underground|access-date=November 7, 2017}}</ref> titled ''[[The Wake (Voivod album)|The Wake]]'', which was released in September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/voivod-to-release-the-wake-album-in-september/|title=VOIVOD To Release 'The Wake' Album In September|date=June 11, 2018|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=June 12, 2018}}</ref>
