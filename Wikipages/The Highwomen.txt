==History==
In 2016, when Shires was finishing her record, ''My Piece of Land'', in music producer [[Dave Cobb]]'s studio, Shires had an idea to create a female country supergroup in homage to the legendary [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|Highwaymen]] country supergroup (consisting of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Willie Nelson]]). At the same time, the lack of representation of women artists on country music radio and at country music festivals had been publicly discussed by many, influenced by the [[Me Too movement]] and journalists like Marissa Moss. While on tour in her van, while listening to country radio, Shires kept a running list of artists and noticed that there were few women. When she called to request they play more women artists, she was directed to a Facebook page lottery system. Cobb recommended Shires call Carlile, whom she didn't know. Carlile thought it would be fun, and would be an interesting creative project.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019 />

The Highwomen project was widely hinted at by Carlile, Morris and Shires before it was officially announced on April 6, 2019. With the name paying homage to the legendary [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|Highwaymen]] country supergroup, the Highwomen were originally intended to leave the fourth spot in their line-up vacant to allow other female collaborators to join them, with [[Chely Wright]], [[Courtney Marie Andrews]], [[Margo Price]], [[Janelle Monae]] and [[Sheryl Crow]] mentioned as potential guests.<ref name=Variety-MarenMorris-JoinsGroup-2019>{{cite news|first1=Chris|last1=Willman|title=Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires Add Maren Morris to 'Highwomen' Supergroup|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/brandi-carline-maren-morris-amanda-shires-highwomen-supergroup-1203156171/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=6 March 2019}}</ref> The band, who jokingly refer to the collaboration as a pirate ship experience, said that they see the project as an incubator project that highlights mentorship and support of fellow women artists.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019 />

Maren hadn't worked with Cobb before, and remarked on how much she liked tracking live. The band recorded live vocals, live band, harmonies in unison, where the musicians were recording together live in an organic environment at historic [[RCA Studio A]], which Cobb now owns.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019 /> As part of the experience, some of the members got matching Highwomen tattoos.<ref name=NoDepression-InsideMakingOf-2019>{{cite news|last1=McCartney|first1=Kelly|title=Inside the Making and the Movement of The Highwomen|url=https://www.nodepression.com/inside-the-making-and-the-movement-of-the-highwomen/|work=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]|date=9 September 2019}}</ref>

The group made their live debut on April 1, 2019 at [[Loretta Lynn]]'s 87th birthday concert held at the [[Bridgestone Arena]] in [[Nashville]]. There, [[Natalie Hemby]] was officially revealed as the final member and the quartet performed "[[It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels]]".<ref name=RollingStone-LorettaLynnBday-2019>{{cite news|first1=Marissa R.|last1=Moss|title=See the Highwomen's Live Debut at Loretta Lynn Birthday Show|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/highwomen-brandi-carlile-loretta-lynn-birthday-concert-816499/|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2 April 2019}}</ref> Their debut single, "Redesigning Women", and its associated music video featuring female artists including [[Tanya Tucker]], [[Cam (singer)|Cam]], [[Lauren Alaina]], [[Cassadee Pope]] and [[Wynonna Judd]] was released on 19 July 2019, with their [[The Highwomen (album)|self-titled debut album]] (set for release on September 6) becoming available for pre-order on the same day.<ref name=TasteOfCountry-RedesigningWomen-Video-2019>{{cite news|first1=Cillea|last1=Houghton|title=The Highwomen Light the Ultimate Bonfire in 'Redesigning Women' Video [Watch]|url=https://tasteofcountry.com/the-highwomen-redesigning-women-video/|work=[[Taste of Country]]|date=19 July 2019}}</ref> The song was promoted by country singer [[Dierks Bentley]] who released a comedic reading of the lyrics to his [[YouTube Channel]] which received praise from Carlile and Morris.<ref name=PopCulture-RedesigningWomen-Video-Dierks-2019>{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Gayle|title=Dierks Bentley Does Comedic Reading of The Highwomen's 'Redesigning Women'|url=https://popculture.com/country-music/2019/07/24/dierks-bentley-comedic-reading-the-highwomen-redesigning-women/|work=PopCulture.com|date=24 July 2019}}</ref> Their second single, "Crowded Table", written by band member Hemby and [[Lori McKenna]], was released on July 26, 2019.<ref name=CoS-CrowdedTable-Video-2019>{{cite news|last1=Newcomb|first1=Ming Lee|title=Country supergroup The Highwomen share second single "Crowded Table": Stream|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/07/the-highwomen-crowded-table-stream/|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=26 July 2019}}</ref>

In July 2019, the Highwomen performed their first ever full live set at the 60th annual [[Newport Folk Festival]], previewing songs from their upcoming album including "If She Ever Leaves Me", written by Shires, her husband [[Jason Isbell]] and Chris Thompkins.<ref name=Variety-Newport-2019>{{cite news|last1=Willman|first1=Chris|title=Country Supergroup the Highwomen Has a High Time in Newport Folk Festival Debut|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/highwomen-live-debut-newport-folk-festival-1203282123/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=27 July 2019|language=en}}</ref> With Carlile on lead vocals, Isbell described it as "the first gay country song" which elicited applause from the audience. Other songs performed included "My Only Child", an ode to "suburban moms" performed by Hemby who wrote the track with Shires and [[Miranda Lambert]], "Loose Change", a nod to 70s country written by Morris, [[Daniel Layus]] of [[Augustana (band)|Augustana]], and [[Maggie Chapman]], featuring Morris on lead vocals and "Cocktail and a Song" which was written solely by Shires in honor of her father. Carlile later invited the rest of the Highwomen to join her during her headlining set where, as they originally intended, the group performed alongside other female artists including [[Amy Ray]], [[Courtney Marie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Jade Bird]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Linda Perry]], [[Lucy Dacus]], Our Native Daughters, [[Sheryl Crow]], The First Ladies of Bluegrass, and [[Yola Carter]].<ref name=NoDepression-InsideMakingOf-2019 /><ref name=RollingStone-NewportFolkFest-2019>{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Jonathan|last2=Exposito|first2=Suzy|title=Newport Folk Festival 2019: 10 Best Things We Saw|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-live-reviews/newport-folk-fest-2019-recap-864579/|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=29 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=Billboard-NewportFolkFest-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hughes|first1=Hilary|title=The 10 Best Moments From the Surprise-Packed 2019 Newport Folk Festival|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/festivals/8524203/newport-folk-festival-2019-best-moments-dolly-parton-kermit-brandi-carlile|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Shires said the plan was always to debut their music at Newport with Dolly Parton.

Their cover of "[[The Chain (Fleetwood Mac song)|The Chain]]" by [[Fleetwood Mac]] from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[The Kitchen (2019 film)|The Kitchen]]'' debuted during the film's first trailer and was officially released on August 2, 2019.<ref name=SPIN-TheChain-2019>{{cite news|last1=Arcand|first1=Rob |title=New Music: The Highwomen Cover Fleetwood Mac's "The Chain": Listen|url=https://www.spin.com/2019/08/the-highwomen-cover-fleetwood-mac-the-chain-listen/|work=[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]|date=2 August 2019}}</ref> The title track of their self-titled debut album was released on August 13, 2019. Written by Carlile and Shires with [[Jimmy Webb]], the original writer of "[[Highwayman (song)|Highwayman]]", the track that originally inspired the Highwomen's formation, it tells the story of various women throughout history and features guest vocals from British country soul singer [[Yola Carter]] and backing vocals from [[Sheryl Crow]].<ref name=RollingStone-Highwomen-Song-2019>{{cite news|last1=Hudak|first1=Joseph|title=Hear the Highwomen's Gender-Swapping Remake of the Highwaymen's Theme Song|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/highwomen-highwayman-song-brandi-carlile-871074/|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=13 August 2019}}</ref> The song is a classic answer song.<ref name=RollingStone-SiriusXM-2019 />
