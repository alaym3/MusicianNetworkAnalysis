==Music career==
===2010–13: Breakthrough===
His break came in 2010 on the electronic scene with a remix of "[[Hide and Seek (Imogen Heap song)|Hide and Seek]]" by [[Imogen Heap]]. This caught the attention of [[Tim Bergling]] that used his production in "Hide & Seek (Avicii Remix)". He has had a number of chart successes including his single "iTrack" credited to Tim Berg vs Oliver Ingrosso & Otto Knows and with his remix of [[Dada Life]]'s "Kick Out the Epic Motherf**ker". His biggest hit is his 2012 European single "[[Million Voices (Otto Knows song)|Million Voices]]" that has reached number three on the [[Ultratop 50]], the Belgian Singles Chart and number six on the Dutch Singles Chart. It has also charted within the top 15 of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In late 2012, Otto remixed "[[Lies (Burns song)|Lies]]" by British DJ/record producer [[Burns (DJ)|Burns]], which was included in the [[extended play]] release of the single in the UK. The remix proved to fair commercially better and peaked at number 32 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 24 December 2012 after four weeks. In 2013, he co-wrote and co-produced "[[Work Bitch]]" by [[Britney Spears]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Zel McCarthy |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5694976/sebastian-ingrosso-on-britney-spears-new-single-i-didnt-write-it |title=Sebastian Ingrosso on Britney Spears’ New Single: 'I Didn't Write It!' |publisher=Billboard |date=2013-12-09 |access-date=2016-02-28}}</ref>
