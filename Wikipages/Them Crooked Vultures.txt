In November 2011, touring member [[Alain Johannes]] noted that there are definitely plans to record a second studio album, stating: "The way that the cycles happen, you know, Dave jumped right into Foos, and then Josh toured more than a solid year with Queens for the [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self-titled album]].

In December 2012, when asked about the band's future, [[Dave Grohl]] stated: "We've talked about it, I know that someday we'll get back together and do stuff, because we love playing with each other."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcbsfm.cbslocal.com/2012/12/06/dave-grohl-on-john-paul-jones-and-them-crooked-vultures-it-was-one-of-the-highlights-of-my-life/ |title=Dave Grohl On John Paul Jones And Them Crooked Vultures: "It Was One Of The Highlights Of My Life…" « WCBS-FM 101.1 |publisher=Wcbsfm.cbslocal.com |date=December 6, 2012 |access-date=July 16, 2014}}</ref> Grohl once again mentioned a possible reunion in an interview with [[Zane Lowe]] on [[Apple Music]]'s [[Beats 1]] radio station in June 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/post/idsa.cd0e1200-46f6-11e7-ab93-365280a3a9af |title=Zane Lowe and Dave Grohl |work=Apple Music |date=June 6, 2017 |access-date=June 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/dave-grohl-talks-crooked-vultures-reunion-talk-2083184 |title=Dave Grohl talks Them Crooked Vultures reunion: "We do talk about it" |work=NME |date=June 6, 2017 |access-date=June 6, 2017 |author=Connick, Tom}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' in August 2019, Grohl stated: "It's still hard to accept that I got to play in a band with [John Paul Jones]. Technically we're ''still'' a band. [...] We practice once every decade, and we're coming up on another decade aren't we? I don't have any official news but there's always something cooking."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/16/dave-grohl-i-never-imagined-myself-to-be-freddie-mercury |title=Dave Grohl: 'I never imagined myself to be Freddie Mercury |work=The Guardian |date=August 16, 2019 |access-date=August 16, 2019}}</ref> In a further interview with ''[[NME]]'', Grohl elaborated: "We've talked. We've got together. I never say never. If you want me to be your drummer, we either have to be best fucking friends or you have to be better than Josh Homme and John Paul Jones. If those guys call and say that it's time to go, then I'm gonna go because that's the band. That's the band that I want to be the drummer of forever. Josh and I talk about it all the time. I know that John would love to as well. It's also like herding cats. So, we'll see."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/dave-grohl-foo-fighters-reading-leeds-interview-qotsa-vultures-2539933 |title=Dave Grohl on Foo Fighters' return to Reading: "This festival is my first love" |work=NME |date=August 21, 2019 |access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref>
