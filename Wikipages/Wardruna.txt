==Reception==
Jonathan Selzer of ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine described Wardruna's music as "a conjunction of the earthy, the organic and the ethereal" with "runic-based rites inhabiting a frequency that once heard have always seemed just adjacent to everyday consciousness".<ref>Jonathan Selzer (2016): [https://www.loudersound.com/features/norse-code-how-wardrunas-runic-trilogy-transformed-norways-musical-landscape Norse code: how Wardruna's runic trilogy transformed Norway's musical landscape]</ref> Hannah May Kilroy of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine wrote that "Wardruna may be at odds with the modern world, but, perhaps, they are exactly what the modern world needs."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-wardruna-kvitravn/|title=Album review: Wardruna – Kvitravn|website=Kerrang!}}</ref>
