'''Twin Peaks''' is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Chicago]], Illinois. The band was formed in 2010 and consists of Cadien Lake James (vocals, guitar), Clay Frankel (vocals, guitar), Jack Dolan (vocals, bass guitar), Colin Croom (keyboards, vocals, guitar), and Connor Brodner (drums).

==History==
=== Early years ===
Cadien Lake James formed the band in 2010 with childhood friends Jack Dolan and Connor Brodner when they were still in high school. James and Dolan attended [[Jones College Prep High School|Jones College Prep]], while Brodner attended [[Lane Technical College Prep High School|Lane Tech High School]] with Frankel, who later joined the band. Before Frankel played with Twin Peaks, he was in a different group called Crash Hero;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/portugaltheman/comments/6ytz5m/artist_of_the_week_twins_peaks/|title=Artist Of The Week: Twins Peaks • r/portugaltheman|website=reddit|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref> James said in an interview, "We ended up stealing him from his other band."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/twin-peaks|title=Twin Peaks's Chicago Pride - Interview Magazine|date=2013-07-08|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref> James' older brother Hal was the drummer for fellow Chicago band [[Smith Westerns]].

While in high school, James and Dolan were among a number of students who received ten-day suspensions for smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], however it was later reported that Dolan was only returning the homework of James and never participated with the group. One of the other students was their friend [[Chance the Rapper]], who later named his first mixtape ''10 Day'' after the incident.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/redeye-chance-the-rapper-metro-chicago-2016-lolla-aftershow-20160801-story.html|title=We closed out our Lollapalooza weekend with a surprise Chance the Rapper show at Metro|last=Terry|first=Josh|work=RedEye Chicago|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref>

Twin Peaks arose out of Chicago's [[DIY music]] scene, attending and eventually playing DIY shows in houses throughout the city. Frankel lived in one of the better-known spaces called Animal Kingdom. James, Brodner, and Dolan started attending these shows when they were 15, getting to know the members of bands like [[White Mystery]], the Yolks, and Magic Milk.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/redeye-twin-peaks-chicago-interview-down-in-heaven-20160509-story.html|title=Interview: How Twin Peaks' best summer ever made their new album 'Down In Heaven'|last=Terry|first=Josh|work=RedEye Chicago|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref>

=== ''Sunken'' ===
{{Main|Sunken (album)}}
After graduating high school, all the band's members save for Frankel attended [[The Evergreen State College]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], but later dropped out to pursue music. Soon enough the band started to outgrow the Chicago DIY scene. The band's first recorded project, led to it being labeled the "next big thing" by ''[[NME]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/C-Notes/July-2013/Twin-Peaks-is-The-Next-Big-Rock-Band-Out-Of-Chicago/|title=Twin Peaks Is the Next Big Rock Band Out Of Chicago|work=Chicago magazine|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}</ref>

In 2012, the band recorded their debut album, ''[[Sunken (album)|Sunken]]'', in James' basement using "a crappy iMac from 2004, a broken digital mixer, and a digital recording studio from the '90s".<ref name=":0" /> The 20-minute album, named after a park in Chicago where the band members used to drink as teenagers, was released on July 9, 2013 through [[Los Angeles]]-based independent record label Autumn Tone Records, an imprint of [[Aquarium Drunkard]]. People began to approach the band to sell the album on vinyl.

=== ''Wild Onion'' ===
{{Main|Wild Onion (album)}}
The band began work on their follow-up record, ''[[Wild Onion (album)|Wild Onion]],'' in January 2014 in Chicago. The album was released by Grand Jury on August 5, 2014 in North America, and in the UK on September 1, 2014 by [[Communion Music]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a 3.5 out of 5 saying that they “pull off ''[[Exile on Main St.|Exile]]''-era Stones strut and [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] guitar poesy with a sophistication that’s beyond their years, and a sense of humor, too.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/twin-peaks-wild-onion-20140821|title=Twin Peaks 'Wild Onion' Album Review|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref>

James explains that “the album deals with a lot of insecurities that arise when you’re growing up.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchperfectpr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/TwinPeaks_PressKit_2.compressed.pdf|title=Twin Peaks - Wild Onion|last=|first=|date=|website=Pitch Perfect PR|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The music video for "Making Breakfast", a song on the album written and sung by Frankel, was released in October 2014.

The band had a breakout performance at [[Pitchfork Music Festival]] in July 2014, just before ''Wild Onion'' was released. Prior to the festival, James broke his foot at a concert in New Orleans and had to play from a wheelchair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/houseshow-magazine/rock-n-roll-bodhisattva-cadien-lake-james-of-twin-peaks-f949fa2fa9c7|title=Rock n Roll Bodhisattva: Cadien Lake James of Twin Peaks|last=Ingegneri|first=Katie|date=2015-09-24|website=Medium|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref> The performance received a lot of press and some called it the best set of the weekend.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1873002/twin-peaks-pitchfork/|title=How Did The Orwells' Crippling Twin Peaks Make Their Pitchfork Set Even Radder?|work=MTV News|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}</ref> The following summer, Twin Peaks played [[Lollapalooza]] for the first time.

Twin Peaks' first European tour was in February 2015. In addition to club shows, they played several house parties in the UK. They later released a tour film documenting the trip.<ref>{{Citation|last=Twin Peaks Dudes|title=Twin Peaks - 2015 UK Tour Film|date=2015-05-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n6rClslA7M|accessdate=2018-02-11}}</ref> They also returned to Europe that summer to play both [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] in Denmark and [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading & Leeds festivals]] in the UK.
