'''Norma Deloris Egstrom''' (May 26, 1920 – January 21, 2002), known professionally as '''Peggy Lee''', was an American [[jazz]] and [[popular music]] singer, songwriter, composer, and actress, over a career spanning seven decades. From her beginning as a vocalist on local radio to singing with [[Benny Goodman]]'s big band, Lee created  a sophisticated persona, writing music for films, acting, and recording conceptual record albums combining poetry and music.

Lee recorded over 1,100 masters and composed over 270 songs.

==Early life==
Lee was born Norma Deloris Egstrom in [[Jamestown, North Dakota]], United States, on May 26, 1920, the seventh of the eight children of Selma Emele (née Anderson) Egstrom and Marvin Olaf Egstrom, a station agent for the [[Midland Continental Railroad]]. Her family were [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jc.edu/users/stevenso/peggylee/index.html |title=Miss Peggy Lee |publisher=[[University of Jamestown]] |author=Stevenson, Kate |date=October 26, 2005 |access-date=30 September 2018 |archive-date=May 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528164158/http://www.jc.edu/users/stevenso/peggylee/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Her father was Swedish-American and her mother was Norwegian-American.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogi.se/shf9731.htm |title=Nättidningen Rötter – för dig som släktforskar!

Lee and her family lived in several towns along the [[Midland Continental Railroad]] (Jamestown, Nortonville and Wimbledon). She graduated from Wimbledon High School in 1937. The Wimbledon depot building, where she and her family lived and worked, became the Midland Continental Depot Transportation Museum, featuring The Peggy Lee Exhibit, in 2012. The upper floor of the museum, where the Egstrom family once lived, features exhibits that trace Lee's career and her regional and state connection.<ref name="NDTOURISM">{{cite web |title=MIDLAND CONTINENTAL DEPOT TRANSPORTATION MUSEUM FEATURING PEGGY LEE |url=https://www.ndtourism.com/wimbledon/attractions/midland-continental-depot-transportation-museum-featuring-peggy-lee |website=ndtourism.com |access-date=17 January 2021}}</ref>

In Wimbledon, Lee was the female singer for a six-piece college dance band with leader Lyle "Doc" Haines. She traveled to various locations with Haines' quintet on Fridays after school and on weekends.<ref name="Miss Peggy Lee" />

Lee first sang professionally over [[KOVC]] radio in [[Valley City, North Dakota]] in 1936.<ref name="CimentRussell2007"/> She later had her own 15-minute Saturday radio show sponsored by a local restaurant that paid her salary in food. Both during and after her high-school years, Lee sang for small sums on local radio stations.

In October 1937, radio personality Ken Kennedy, of [[WDAY (AM)|WDAY]] in [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] (the most widely heard station in North Dakota), auditioned Egstrom and put her on the air that day, but not before he changed her name to Peggy Lee.<ref name="McMorrow2010">{{cite book|last=McMorrow|first=Merle W.|title=A Long Short Life: The Trials, Tribulations, Travels, and Trivia of an 88 Year Old Kid|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WxkEGwVqaYC&pg=PA146|access-date=August 11, 2013|date=December 2010|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4269-4938-8|page=146}}</ref>

Lee left home and traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] at the age of 17 in March 1938. Her first job was seasonal work on [[Balboa Island, Newport Beach]] as a short order cook and waitress at Harry's Cafe. When the job ended after [[Easter]], she was hired to work as a carnival barker at the Balboa Fun Zone. She wrote about this experience in the song, "The Nickel Ride", which she composed with [[Dave Grusin]] for the 1974 film of the same name.<ref name="Miss Peggy Lee">{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Peggy |title=Miss Peggy Lee |date=1989 |publisher=Donald I. Fine |isbn=1-55611-112-6 |pages=74–76 }}</ref>

Later in 1938, Lee returned to Hollywood to audition for the MC at The Jade. Her employment was cut short when she fainted onstage due to overwork and an inadequate diet. After she was taken to the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center she was told she needed a [[tonsillectomy]]. Lee returned to North Dakota for the operation.<ref name="Fever">{{cite book|last1=Richmond|first1=Peter|title=Fever : the life and music of Miss Peggy Lee|date=2007|publisher=Picador/Henry Holt|location=New York|isbn=978-0312426613|edition=1st Picador|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IVpXzE53o8C&q=Peggy+Lee+tonsillectomy&pg=PA549|access-date=11 September 2015}}</ref>

The following year, remaining in North Dakota, she was hired to perform regularly at The Powers Hotel in Fargo, and toured with both the Sev Olson and the [[Will Osborne (singer)|Will Osborne]] Orchestras.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |title=100 Jazz Profiles |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/jazz/profiles/peggy_lee.shtml |access-date=8 January 2021 |work=BBC Radio 3 |date=January 2014}}</ref>

When Lee returned to California in 1940, she took a job singing at The Doll House in [[Palm Springs]]. Here, she developed her trademark sultry purr, having decided to compete with the noisy crowd with subtlety rather than volume.

{{quote|I knew I couldn't sing over them, so I decided to sing under them. The more noise they made, the more softly I sang. When they discovered they couldn't hear me, they began to look at me. Then, they began to listen. As I sang, I kept thinking, 'softly with feeling'. The noise dropped to a hum; the hum gave way to silence. I had learned how to reach and hold my audience—softly, with feeling."<ref name="Miss Peggy Lee" />}}

While performing at The Doll House, Lee met Frank Bering, the owner of the Ambassador East and West in [[Chicago]]. He offered her a gig at the Buttery Room, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel West. There, she was noticed by bandleader Benny Goodman. According to Lee:
{{quote|Benny's then-fiancée, Lady Alice Duckworth, came into the Buttery, and she was very impressed. So the next evening, she brought Benny in, because they were looking for a replacement for [[Helen Forrest]]. And although I didn't know, I was it. He was looking at me strangely, I thought, but it was just his preoccupied way of looking. I thought that he didn't like me at first, but it just was that he was preoccupied with what he was hearing.}}
She joined his band in August 1941 and made her first recording, singing "Elmer's Tune". Lee stayed with the Benny Goodman Orchestra for two years.<ref name="Balliett2006">{{cite book|last=Balliett|first=Whitney|title=American Singers: Twenty-Seven Portraits in Song|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25yl91-bDt8C&pg=PA88|access-date=August 11, 2013|year=2006|publisher=Univ.

==Recording career==
In 1942, Lee had her first number-one hit, "[[Somebody Else Is Taking My Place]]",<ref name=pc2b>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|2|B |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1633240/m1/#track/4 }}</ref> followed in 1943 by "[[Why Don't You Do Right?]]", which sold more than one million copies and made her famous. She sang with Goodman's orchestra in two 1943 films, ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' and ''[[The Powers Girl]]''.

In March 1943, Lee married [[Dave Barbour]], a guitarist in Goodman's band.<ref name="CimentRussell2007">{{cite book|last1=Ciment|first1=James |last2=Russell |first2=Thaddeus |title=The Home Front Encyclopedia: United States, Britain, and Canada in World Wars I and II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0P04JuMSM8C&pg=PA654|access-date=August 11, 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-849-5 |page=654}}</ref> Lee said:
{{quote|David joined Benny's band and there was a ruling that no one should fraternize with the girl singer. But I fell in love with David the first time I heard him play, and so I married him. Benny then fired David, so I quit, too. Benny and I made up, although David didn't play with him anymore. Benny stuck to his rule. I think that's not too bad a rule, but you can't help falling in love with somebody.|Peggy Lee}}

{{quote|...when she left the band that spring [1943], her intention was to quit the footlights altogether and become Mrs. Barbour, fulltime housewife. It's to Mr. Barbour's credit that he refused to let his wife's singing and composing talent lie dormant for too long.  "I fell in love with David Barbour," she recalled.  "But 'Why Don't You Do Right' was such a giant hit that I kept getting offers and kept turning them down. And at that time it was a lot of money, but it really didn't matter to me at all. I was very happy. All I wanted was to have a family and cling to the children [daughter Nicki]. Well, they kept talking to me and finally David joined them and said 'You really have too much talent to stay at home and someday you might regret it.'"|Liner notes written by Will Friedwald<ref>Liner notes written by Will Friedwald to Peggy Lee and Benny Goodman, ''The Complete Recordings, 1941–1947'', Columbia/Legacy, 1999</ref>}}

She drifted back to songwriting and occasional recording sessions for [[Capitol Records]] in 1944, for whom she recorded a long string of hits, many of them with lyrics and music by Lee and Barbour, including "I Don't Know Enough About You" and "It's a Good Day". Her recording of "Golden Earrings", the title song of a 1947 [[Golden Earrings|movie]], was a hit throughout 1947–1948. "Mañana", written by Lee and Barbour, was her eleventh solo hit recording, and remained on the charts for twenty-one weeks, nine of which were in the number one position.  The song sold over a million copies, and earned the Top Disc Jockey Record of the Year award from ''Billboard'' magazine.<ref name="Tish book" /> From 1946 to 1949, Lee also recorded for Capitol's library of [[electrical transcription]]s for radio stations. An advertisement for Capitol Transcriptions in a trade magazine noted that the transcriptions included "special voice introductions by Peggy".<ref>{{cite news|title=Capitol Transcriptions ad|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1948/1948-06-28-BC.pdf |access-date=December 21, 2014 |agency=Broadcasting|date=June 28, 1948}}</ref>

In 1948, Lee joined vocalists [[Perry Como]] and [[Jo Stafford]] as a host of the [[NBC Radio]] musical program ''[[The Chesterfield Supper Club]]''.<ref name="Dunning1998">{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=John |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn|url-access=registration |access-date=3 September 2019|date=7 May 1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press, US |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/n173 152]–}}</ref><ref name="Music">{{cite magazine|magazine=Billboard|title=Music As Written |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA21 |access-date=April 6, 2011 |date= June 19, 1948 |page=21}}</ref> She was a regular on ''[[Jimmy Durante|The Jimmy Durante Show]]'' and appeared frequently on [[Bing Crosby]]'s radio shows during the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Her relationship with Capitol spanned almost three decades aside from a brief detour (1952–1956) at Decca.<ref name="Strom2005">{{cite book|last=Strom|first=Robert|title=Miss Peggy Lee: A Career Chronicle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3zL9ZGtppgC&pg=PA52 |access-date=August 11, 2013 |year=2005 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-1936-4 |page=52}}</ref> For that label, she recorded ''[[Black Coffee (Peggy Lee album)|Black Coffee]]'' and had hit singles such as "[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]" and "Mister Wonderful".

In 1958, she recorded her own version of "[[Fever (Little Willie John song)|Fever]]" by [[Little Willie John]], written by Eddie Cooley and John Davenport,.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2">{{cite book |first=John |last=Tobler |year=1992 |title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|edition=1st|publisher=Reed International Books |location=London|page=56|id=CN 5585}}</ref> Lee created a new arrangement for the song, and added lyrics ("Romeo loved Juliet", "Captain Smith and Pocahontas"), which she neglected to copyright. Her new version of "Fever" was a hit, and was nominated in three categories at the [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|First Annual Grammy Awards]] in 1959, including [[Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].<ref name="Grammy" />

While Lee was in London for a 1970 engagement at [[Royal Albert Hall]], she invited Paul and [[Linda McCartney]] to dinner at [[The Dorchester]]. At the dinner, the couple gifted Lee with a song they had written entitled, "Let's Love". In July 1974, with Paul McCartney producing, Lee recorded the song at the [[Record Plant]] in Los Angeles, and it became the title track for her 40th album, her first and only on [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="Fever" />

Lee was among hundreds of artists whose studio masters were destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

==Acting career==
Lee starred opposite [[Danny Thomas]] in ''[[The Jazz Singer (1952 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' (1952), a remake of the Al Jolson film, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927). She played an alcoholic blues singer in ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (film)|Pete Kelly's Blues]]'' (1955), for which she was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]].<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book|first=John|last=Tobler|year=1992|title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|edition=1st|publisher=Reed International Books Ltd|location=London|page=18|id=CN 5585}}</ref>

Lee provided speaking and singing voices for several characters in the Disney movie ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), playing the human Darling, the dog Peg, and the two Siamese cats, [[Si and Am]]. She also co-wrote, with Sonny Burke all of the original songs for the film, including "He's A Tramp", "Bella Notte", "La La Lu", "The Siamese Cat Song", and "Peace on Earth". In 1987, when ''Lady and the Tramp'' was released on [[VHS]], Lee sought performance and song royalties on the video sales. When Disney refused to pay, she filed a lawsuit in 1988. After a prolonged legal battle, in 1992, Lee was awarded $2.3 million for breach of contract, plus $500,000 for unjust enrichment, $600,000 for illegal use of Lee's voice and $400,000 for the use of her name.<ref name="Cartoon Brew">{{cite news |last1=Gabriel |first1=Brian |title=Lady and the Lawsuit: Peggy Lee's War With Disney |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/peggy-lee-war-disney-lady-and-the-tramp-113688.html |access-date=10 January 2021 |work=Cartoon Brew |date=September 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Los Angeles Times">{{cite news |last1=Bernstein |first1=Sharon |title=Peggy Lee Awarded Disney Damages : Courts: Amount from 'Lady and Tramp' video rights is in dispute.

==Tributes and legacy==
Lee is often cited as the inspiration for the [[Margarita]] cocktail. In 1948, after a trip to [[Mexico]], she and her husband ventured into the [[Balinese Room]] in [[Galveston, Texas]].

==Songwriting==
Lee wrote or co-wrote over 270 songs.<ref name="Tish book">{{cite book |last1=Oney |first1=Dr. Tish |title=Peggy Lee |date=2020 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-5381-2847-3}}</ref> In addition to her own material to sing, she was hired to score and compose songs for movies.  For the Disney movie ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', she co-composed all of the original songs with Burke, and supplied the singing and speaking voices of four characters.<ref name="PeggyLee Website">{{cite web|title=Lady and the Tramp – 50th Anniversary Edition|url=http://www.peggylee.com/new/0602_ladyandthetramp.html |publisher=PeggyLee.com |date=February 28, 2006}}</ref>

Over the years, her songwriting collaborators included David Barbour, [[Laurindo Almeida]], [[Harold Arlen]], [[Sonny Burke]], [[Cy Coleman]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Dave Grusin]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Francis Lai]], [[Jack Marshall (composer)|Jack Marshall]], [[Johnny Mandel]], [[Marian McPartland]], [[Willard Robison]], [[Lalo Schifrin]], and [[Victor Young]].

Her first published song was in 1941, "Little Fool". "What More Can a Woman Do?" was recorded by [[Sarah Vaughan]] with [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charlie Parker]]. "[[Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me)]]" was number one on the Billboard singles chart for nine weeks in 1948, from the week of March 13 to May 8.

Lee was a mainstay of Capitol Records when rock and roll came onto the American music scene. She was among the first of the "old guard" to recognize this new genre, as seen by her recording music from [[the Beatles]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Carole King]], [[James Taylor]], and other up-and-coming songwriters. From 1957 until her final disc for the company in 1972, she produced a steady stream of two or three albums per year that usually included standards (often arranged quite differently from the original), her own compositions, and material from young artists.

Many of her compositions have become standards, performed by singers such as [[Tony Bennett]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Doris Day]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Janelle Monae]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Regina Spektor]], [[Sarah Vaughan]] and others.<ref name="FW Business">{{cite news |title=Peggy Lee 'Fever' continues during centennial celebration |url=https://fortworthbusiness.com/culture/peggy-lee-fever-continues-during-centennial-celebration/ |access-date=10 January 2021 |work=Fort Worth Business |date=July 17, 2020}}</ref>
