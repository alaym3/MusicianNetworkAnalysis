'''Henry Gross''' (born April 1, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter best known for his association with the group [[Sha Na Na]] and for his [[hit record|hit]] song, "[[Shannon (song)|Shannon]]". Gross is considered a [[one-hit wonder]] artist;  none of his other songs reached the Top 10 on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'' .

==Early years==
Gross was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City. His mother's love for music encouraged his pursuit of a performing career. At age 13 he performed at the New Jersey Pavilion at the World's Fair in Flushing, New York with his first band, The Auroras. By age 14, he was playing regularly in local clubs in the New York area, and spending his summers playing at [[Catskill Mountains]] resort hotels.

At age 18, while a student at [[Brooklyn College]], Gross became a founding member of 1950's Rock & Roll revival group, Sha Na Na, playing guitar and wearing the [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] clothes he wore while a student at [[Midwood High School]].

==Going solo==
Gross left Sha Na Na to become a solo singer-songwriter in 1970. He signed a recording contract with [[ABC Dunhill Records]] in 1971. While there, he did some session work for producers Tommy West and Terry Cashman. He played electric lead guitar on the [[Jim Croce]] album, ''[[I Got a Name]]''. His own debut album had little commercial success. He continued to play at clubs and colleges until 1973, when he signed with [[A&M Records]].

His first self-titled A&M album sold well. It included several regional hits including "Simone", "Come On Say It", "Skin King", and a cover version of Lindisfarne's European hit, "Meet Me on the Corner". With Gross' second A&M album, ''Plug Me into Something'', he began to achieve national recognition in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

=="Shannon"==
Gross moved on to Lifesong Records to make his next album. He produced a single, "[[Shannon (song)|Shannon]]", a song written about the death of former [[Beach Boys]] member [[Carl Wilson]]'s dog, who was named Shannon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepopfile.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2016/01/07/how-singer-henry-gross-playing-now-at-cityplace-wrote-the-hit-dog-love-song-shannon/|title=How singer Henry Gross, playing now at CityPlace, wrote the hit dog love song "Shannon"|author=Streeter, Leslie Gray|website=PalmBeachPost.com|publisher=Palm Beach Post|access-date=January 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forgottenhits60s.blogspot.com/2009/01/real-story-behind-henry-gross-hit.html|title=The Real Story Behind the Henry Gross Hit "Shannon"|website=Forgotten Hits|author=Kotal, Kent|access-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref> The single went [[music recording sales certification|gold]] in the U.S.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

In Canada it reached No. 1 in May of the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.4128a&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=kjerdnvbvl3a8p4jfufutrc7u6|title=Collectionscanada.gc.ca|publisher=|access-date=June 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119011833/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.4128a&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=kjerdnvbvl3a8p4jfufutrc7u6|archive-date=November 19, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> "Shannon" also reached No. 1 in New Zealand, but peaked only at No. 32 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> After this single's success, Gross released the album, ''Release''. His second single, "Springtime Mama", reached No. 37 in the US, selling nearly a million copies, and reaching No. 18 in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.4356a.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - September 18, 1976}}</ref>

On his next album, ''Show Me to the Stage'', Gross mixed [[rock and roll]] songs with [[Phil Spector]] and [[Brian Wilson]] influences. While the album sold well, it provided no hit singles.  He also recorded [[The Beatles]] song "[[Help! (song)|Help!]]" for the documentary, ''[[All This and World War II]]''; both occurred in 1976.  Gross' recording career slowed, but with [[Sony Music|CBS Records]] he made "Love Is the Stuff" and with [[Capitol Records]], in 1981, along with [[Bobby Colomby]], produced the ''What's in a Name'' album.

As a session guitarist Henry performed on many records by other artists including Jim Croce (I Got A Name, ABC Records 1973)
Judy Collins (Home Again, Elektra/ Asylum 1984), and [[Andy Kim (singer)|Andy Kim]] ([[Baby, I Love You]], Steed/Dot Records 1970).

His songs have been recorded by a variety of artists including Judy Collins, Mary Travers, Cyndi Lauper, Jonathan Edwards, Henry Paul, Blackhawk, Southside Johnny, Garry Tallent and Rob Stoner.

In the 1980s, Gross performed in the road company production of ''[[Pump Boys and Dinettes]]'' with a cast featuring Jonathan Edwards (Sunshine) and Nicolette Larson (Lotta Love). Gross moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1986 and signed a publishing deal with Pic-A-Lic Music, a company owned by songwriters Roger Cook and Ralph Murphy.

==1990–present==
Gross continued his songwriting and recording career in Nashville. In 1993, he released the album ''Nothing But Dreams'' on his own record label, Zelda Records, named after his mother. He had a Top 40 Country Radio hit, "Big Guitar" for the Arista recording group Blackhawk, fronted by his good friend, Henry Paul. Gross released ''I'm Hearing Things'' on Zelda Records in 2001.

He has also written and currently performs a one-man show called "One Hit Wanderer", chronicling the highlights and funniest moments of his life in and out of the entertainment business.

He continues to write new songs while regularly recording in Fort Myers, Florida with multi-instrumentalist and recording engineer John McLane, having produced eight albums with #9 nearly completed. ''One Hit Wanderer'' (2006), ''Foreverland'' (2007), ''Rhymes and Misdemeanors'' and ''Right as Rain'' (2011). A single was released, "What a Christmas", the same year. As a further accomplishment, he released a trio album in 2011 with Jonathan Edwards and Henry Paul, titled ''Edwards, Gross & Paul'' AKA "The Vereens".

In 2016 Henry traveled to the UK to support long time friend [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]] on his Just Joe UK tour. Joe and Henry played a selection of hits from Joe and Henry's discography as well as a selection of rock and roll and country hits. The tour was a resounding success with the vast majority of the shows selling out.

In early 2017 before leaving for the UK, Henry, on his Zelda Records label, released three new CD's, "Mixed Messages", "Stories I've Lived To Tell" and "New Orleans, New Orleans" – a collection of songs from a new musical comedy play of the same name, written by Henry and playwright Ed Greenberg.

In October 2017, the pair went back on the road with the same show, this time backed up by the live album, produced by Henry, recorded during the 2016 tour. The tour ran through October and November 2017 before breaking for Christmas. They went back on the road in 2018 from January through March.

In 2019, while doing many shows celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Woodstock Festival, Henry continued his recording journey with multi instrumentalist/ engineer, John Mclane, completing and releasing the new 17 song CD, Too Clever (For My Own Good) in February 2020 on Zelda Records.
