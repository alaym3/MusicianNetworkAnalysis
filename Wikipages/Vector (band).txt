'''Vector''' was a [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Sacramento, California]] in the early 1980s by [[Jimmy Abegg]], Steve Griffith and [[Charlie Peacock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vector-mn0000317267/biography|title=Vector - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref> The band had several drummers over the years, including [[Aaron Smith (musician)|Aaron Smith]] and [[Bruce Spencer]], both of whom also played drums for [[the 77s]].

Although the lyrics of Vector's music did not always contain the overt lyrics of [[contemporary Christian music]] with which the band was sometimes associated, Vector's albums were released under Christian labels, and were an example of [[Christian rock]].<ref name="Powell_Fe">{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark Allan |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |year=2002 |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |location=[[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]], [[Massachusetts]] |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |edition=First printing |chapter=Vector |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/987 987–989] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/987 }}</ref>
