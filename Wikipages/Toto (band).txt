'''Toto''' (stylized as '''TOTO''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1977 in [[Los Angeles]]. The band's current lineup consists of [[Steve Lukather]] (guitars and vocals), [[David Paich]] (keyboards and vocals), and [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]] (vocals), as well as touring musicians, John Pierce (bass), Robert "Sput" Searight (drums), Dominique "Xavier" Taplin (keyboards and vocals), Steve Maggiora (keyboards and vocals) and [[Warren Ham]] (horns and vocals). Toto is known for a musical style that combines elements of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[blues]] and [[jazz]].

[[David Paich]] and [[Jeff Porcaro]] had played together as [[session musician]]s on several albums and decided to form a band. [[David Hungate]], Lukather, [[Steve Porcaro]], and [[Bobby Kimball]] were recruited before the first album release. The band enjoyed great commercial success in the late 1970s and 1980s, beginning with the band's [[Toto (album)|eponymous debut]] released in 1978. With the release of the commercially successful ''[[Toto IV]]'' (1982), Toto became one of the best-selling music groups of their era. Widely known for the Top 5 hits "[[Hold the Line]]", "[[Rosanna (song)|Rosanna]]", and "[[Africa (Toto song)|Africa]]", the makeup of the group continued to evolve. Hungate left in 1982; Kimball left in 1984, but rejoined the band in 1998, leaving again in 2008. Jeff Porcaro died in 1992. Hungate rejoined Toto as a touring musician and later a band member. In 2008, Lukather announced his departure from the band, and the remaining band members later went their separate ways.

In the summer of 2010, Toto reformed and went on a short European tour, with a new lineup, to benefit [[Mike Porcaro]], who had been diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) and was no longer an active member of the band. He died in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toto99.com/blog2010/index.php?/categories/1-Hot-News |title=Official TOTO Website – Hot News |website=Toto99.com |access-date=July 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722213341/http://www.toto99.com/blog2010/index.php?%2Fcategories%2F1-Hot-News |archive-date=July 22, 2010 }}</ref> The band celebrated its [[40 Trips Around the Sun|40th anniversary]] in 2017. Toto announced an extended hiatus following the final leg of their 40th anniversary tour in 2019. In October 2020, the band announced that guitarist and founding member [[Steve Lukather]] and longtime vocalist [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]] would return to touring as Toto in the 2021 "Dogz of Oz" tour, and in a live-streamed concert on November 21, 2020, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

Toto has released 14 studio albums, and has sold over 40 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6436289/toto-new-album-xiv-march-release |title=Toto to Release First Album in Nearly a Decade |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=January 8, 2015 |access-date=January 9, 2015}}</ref> The group has been honored with several [[Grammy Award]]s and was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1623747/rascal-flatts-perform-with-toto-during-musicians-hall-of-fame-induction-ceremony.jhtml |title=Rascal Flatts Perform With Toto During Musicians Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony |author=Calvin Gilbert |date=October 13, 2009 |publisher= Country Music Television|access-date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>

==History==
===1977–1979: Formation and debut album===

The members of Toto were regulars on albums by [[Steely Dan]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.kth.se/~tomase/SteelyDanAlbums.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913045613/http://www.math.kth.se/~tomase/SteelyDanAlbums.html|url-status=dead|title=Math.kth.se|archive-date=September 13, 2007}}</ref> [[Seals and Crofts]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sealsandcrofts.com/lyricsgc.html |title=Seals and Crofts album information |website=Sealsandcrofts.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> [[Boz Scaggs]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,159295,00.html |title=Silk Degrees album information |website=Artistdirect.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> [[Sonny and Cher]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherscholar.com/all-i-ever.htm |title=Sonny and Cher information |website=Cherscholar.com |date=December 31, 1999 |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> and many others, contributing to many of the most popular records of the 1970s. Keyboardist [[David Paich]], son of musician and session player/arranger [[Marty Paich]], rose to fame after having co-written much of Scaggs's ''[[Silk Degrees]]'' album. Having played on many sessions with drummer [[Jeff Porcaro]] (the son of session percussionist [[Joe Porcaro]]), whom he met while attending [[Grant High School (Los Angeles)|Grant High School]], where they formed the band Rural Still Life, Paich began to discuss seriously with Porcaro the possibility of them forming their own band. They brought in bassist and fellow session veteran [[David Hungate]], having played with him in the backing band for Scaggs. In addition, the duo asked fellow Grant High School students, guitarist [[Steve Lukather]] (who also played in Scaggs's band as a replacement for [[Les Dudek]]) and Jeff Porcaro's brother [[Steve Porcaro]] (keyboards) to join the team. Lukather and Steve Porcaro were in the same year at Grant and continued the band Rural Still Life (the name shortened to Still Life) after Paich and Jeff graduated. With the addition of former S.S. Fools singer [[Bobby Kimball]], the group began to work on their first album in 1977 after signing with [[Columbia Records]].

Once the band came together, David Paich began composing what would become the eponymous debut album, ''Toto''. According to popular myth, at the first recording sessions, in order to distinguish their own demo tapes from other bands' in the studio, Jeff Porcaro wrote the word "Toto" on them. In the early 1980s, band members told the press that the band was named after [[Toto (Oz)|Toto the dog]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref name="apmc" /> After the completion of the first album, the band and record were still unnamed. David Hungate, after viewing the name on the demo tapes, explained to the group that the Latin words "in toto" translated to "all-encompassing." Because the band members played on so many records and so many musical genres, they adopted the name "Toto" as their own.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

After its release, ''[[Toto (album)|Toto]]'' climbed the charts quickly, earning popularity with the hit single "[[Hold the Line]]", as well as the charting "[[I'll Supply the Love]]" and "[[Georgy Porgy (song)|Georgy Porgy]]", featuring [[Cheryl Lynn]]. The band garnered international acclaim and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]. Shortly thereafter, in early 1979, Toto embarked on their first American tour in support of the debut album.<ref name="tourdate">{{cite web|url=http://toto_rocks.tripod.com/id19.html |title=Toto Tourdate Information |website=Toto_rocks.tripod.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>
For the tour, Toto brought along two additional musicians, [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]] (guitar, backup vocals) and Lenny Castro (percussion), to increase the depth of the sound. Castro had appeared with the group on their first album as a session musician, and continued to play on every one of their albums for the next 40 years in varying capacities, with the exception of ''[[Turn Back (album)|Turn Back]]''. The band continued to hire additional touring musicians for all subsequent tours. (See the "Tour Musicians" section below).

===1979–1981: ''Hydra'' and ''Turn Back''===
At the close of the first tour, the band began work on their next album, titled ''[[Hydra (Toto album)|Hydra]]'', which was released later that year and featured the single "[[99 (song)|99]]", inspired by [[George Lucas]]' cult film'' [[THX 1138]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toto99.com/blog/ency.php?/archives/360-99.html |title=Toto Encyclopedia |website=Toto99.com |date=April 28, 2007 |access-date=July 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618134430/http://www.toto99.com/blog/ency.php?%2Farchives%2F360-99.html |archive-date=June 18, 2010}}</ref> Nearly 30 years later, Steve Lukather confessed that, despite the song's popularity, he hated "99" and that it's one of his least favorite Toto songs, which is why it was rarely performed after ''Hydra'''s tour.<ref>[http://old.playlouder.com/feature/+dr-rock-vs-toto/ Steve Lukather Interview 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007014500/http://old.playlouder.com/feature/+dr-rock-vs-toto/ |date=October 7, 2007 }}</ref> The band also released four promotional music videos for the album, including the title track. The other two were "St George and The Dragon" and "All Us Boys". They were directed by Bruce Gowers and produced by Paul Flattery for Jon Roseman Productions International. Although the album ''Hydra'' failed to achieve the commercial success of Toto's first release, it still went gold. Following the album's release, the band set out on the "Hydra Tour", which featured both American and international dates. The tour lasted from February until June 1980.<ref name="tourdate" />

In early 1981, Toto released their third album, ''[[Turn Back (album)|Turn Back]].'' The album was a venture into [[arena rock]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevelukather.net/Album.aspx?id=9 |title=Steve Lukather Official Site |website=Stevelukather.net |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> and featured heavier guitar and fewer keyboards than on the previous two records. This album's disappointing chart performance and sales in almost every country besides [[Japan]] and [[Norway]] put the band's career into further jeopardy, as they had not had a hit single in North America in almost two years at that point. The abnormal success of the album's lead single "Goodbye Elenore" in Japan proved to be the band's breakthrough in the country, and Japan has likewise become a permanent staple of their touring schedule since.

On December 15, 1981, Bobby Kimball was arrested for allegedly selling cocaine to an undercover police officer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KppDAAAAIBAJ&dq=toto%20singer%20arrested&pg=1648%2C1915610 |title=Toto singer pleads |newspaper=[[Williamson Daily News]]|date=February 4, 1983}}</ref>

===1982–1985: ''Toto IV'' and ''Isolation''===

1982 marked the beginning of Toto's most successful era. After the detrimental sales of ''Turn Back'', the band was under a great deal of pressure from the record company to produce a new hit record, akin to their first. With the Triple Platinum-certified ''[[Toto IV]]'', the band delivered one of the most commercially successful records of the year. The album featured three singles that reached the Top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart: "[[Rosanna (song)|Rosanna]]", "[[Africa (Toto song)|Africa]]" and "[[I Won't Hold You Back]]". The album also appeared on several worldwide charts, introducing the band to new audiences around the globe. "Africa" topped the charts in February 1983 and was a constant presence on radios around the world, but it was "Rosanna" that earned the band multiple Grammy nominations. ''Toto IV'' earned six [[Grammy Awards]], including "[[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]" for "Rosanna", "[[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]" for ''Toto IV'' and "[[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical|Producer of the Year]]". At the time [[Steve Porcaro]] was dating actress [[Rosanna Arquette]], but the song is not about her, according to writer David Paich.<ref>{{cite web |author=Tegnér, Anders |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RapeIp26Is |title=Toto Interview 1988 |website = [[YouTube]]|access-date=June 15, 2012}}</ref> In the music video for the song, [[Cynthia Rhodes]] plays the title character. In addition to "Africa" and "Rosanna", ''Toto IV'' continued its successful run with the release of another single, "[[Make Believe (Toto song)|Make Believe]]". Toto toured throughout 1982 in support of ''Toto IV''.<ref name="tourdate" /> Also, during this time, Steve Porcaro co-wrote and co-composed "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]," which [[Michael Jackson]] recorded for his best-selling album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' (1982), turning the song into a smash hit. Jeff Porcaro and Steve Lukather also appeared on ''Thriller'' on multiple tracks, most notably the Jackson/[[Paul McCartney]] duet "[[The Girl Is Mine]]".

Directly after the release of ''Toto IV'', bassist [[David Hungate]] left the band. Hungate, who had relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1980 to pursue a session/production career, felt that the fame surrounding ''Toto IV'' would prevent him from spending time with his family. A third Porcaro brother, [[Mike Porcaro]], who had performed cello on a track from ''Toto IV'', replaced Hungate on bass, while lead singer [[Bobby Kimball]] spent the early part of 1983 facing prosecution for drug-related charges. Kimball was ordered to stand trial, but pleaded not guilty. The charges were dismissed on May 28 of that year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ez1WAAAAIBAJ&dq=toto%20singer%20kimball%20charges&pg=2584%2C4242894 |title=Rock singer off the hook in drug case |date=May 28, 1983 |newspaper=[[Gainesville Sun]]|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> However, Kimball was fired from the band in 1984 due to difficulty recording vocals and numerous missed sessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/05/07/features/story4.html |title=TOTO flies high on tour |date=May 7, 2004 |access-date=March 1, 2015}}</ref> Later that year, Toto composed most of the music for the [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack to the film ''Dune'']].

At one point, [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] of the band [[Mr. Mister]] was offered the lead singer spot, but turned it down to continue with his band. [[Dennis Frederiksen|Fergie Frederiksen]] (formerly of bands [[Angel (American band)|Angel]], Trillion and [[LeRoux (band)|LeRoux]]) was brought in as the new vocalist and the band recorded ''[[Isolation (Toto album)|Isolation]]'', released in November 1984. While ''[[Isolation (Toto album)|Isolation]]'' did not achieve the acclaim or sales of ''Toto IV'', it did achieve Gold status, largely on the strength of the single "[[Stranger in Town (Toto song)|Stranger in Town]]". ''Isolation''{{'}}s tour began in February 1985 and concluded three months later.<ref name="tourdate" />

===1985–1988: ''Fahrenheit'' and ''The Seventh One'' with Joseph Williams===

[[File:Jeff Porcaro Toto Fahrenheit World Tour 1986.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jeff Porcaro in 1986]]

At the close of the ''Isolation'' tour in 1985, Fergie Frederiksen was let go. Lukather claimed that the band was not meshing well with Frederiksen because he had a difficult time recording with them in the studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/stevelukather.html |title=Steve Lukather interview 1998 |website=Melodicrock.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> The band held an audition and [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]], son of film composer [[John Williams]] and 1950s singer/actress [[Barbara Ruick]], was chosen to take over lead vocals in early 1986.

With Joseph Williams now onboard officially, Toto wrote and recorded ''[[Fahrenheit (Toto album)|Fahrenheit]]'', released in October 1986. While Williams performs lead vocals, Frederiksen had begun recording a few tracks and is featured as a background vocalist on the track "Could This Be Love".

''Fahrenheit'' brought the band back from the heavier sound of ''Isolation'' to their pop/rock roots. "[[I'll Be Over You]]" and "Without Your Love", which were both ballads sung by Lukather, were the two hit singles. The band recruited several guest musicians for the album. They recorded an instrumental piece entitled "Don't Stop Me Now" with legendary jazz trumpeter [[Miles Davis]]. In addition, a then-unknown [[Paula Abdul]] appeared as a dancer in their "Till the End" music video. [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]] provided backup vocals on the song "I'll Be Over You" (and appeared in the accompanying music video), while [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] founder and songwriting giant [[Don Henley]] appeared on the Steve Porcaro penned track "Lea".

After its release, the band embarked on another world tour. Upon its conclusion in 1987, Steve Porcaro left the band to pursue a career in film and television scoring. ''Fahrenheit'' eventually went Gold on October 3, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=Gold & Platinum – August 9, 2008 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> Steve Porcaro was never replaced and Toto decided to continue with only five members. Although Porcaro occasionally assisted the band on synthesizers for their subsequent studio albums (and appeared on their 1988 tour), David Paich handled most of the live keyboard work (with keyboard technician John Jessel assisting on certain dates) post 1988.

In 1988 Toto released their next album ''[[The Seventh One]]'', featuring [[Jon Anderson]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] on backup vocals on the single "[[Stop Loving You]]". The album's other single, "[[Pamela (song)|Pamela]]", became very popular and would be the band's last to hit the US Top 40. ''The Seventh One'' became the band's most successful release since ''Toto IV''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insidemusicast.com/current/2006/08/25/david_paich.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212193016/http://www.insidemusicast.com/current/2006/08/25/david_paich.html|url-status=dead|title=Insidemusiccast.com|archive-date=February 12, 2007}}</ref> The band toured from February through July 1988.<ref name="tourdate" />

===1988–1990: ''Past To Present'' and Jean-Michel Byron===

Although "The Seventh One Tour" was very successful, after it was finished the band decided to replace lead singer Joseph Williams. Originally, the band wanted to reunite with original vocalist Bobby Kimball to record new songs for a greatest hits record, but the record company instead insisted they hire South African singer [[Jean-Michel Byron]]. Before Byron was brought in, the band recorded "Goin' Home" with Kimball. This song was later featured on the ''Toto XX'' album as an "unreleased song." When Byron was brought in (in 1989) he and Toto recorded four new songs which were included on their greatest hits album ''[[Past to Present 1977–1990]]'', released in 1990. Toto then embarked upon the "Planet Earth" tour that lasted from September until December 1990. The band didn't get along with Byron, whose diva-like behavior and flamboyant stage presence caused friction during the tour. He was demoted to background vocals before ultimately being fired at the conclusion of the tour. During this time, the band also found that former singer Bobby Kimball was booking shows and billing himself and his backing band as "Toto".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QUNWAAAAIBAJ&dq=bobby%20kimball%20rented%20gear%20toto&pg=6611%2C7131504 |title=Former Toto singer upsets fans by using band's name at club |date=August 29, 1990 |newspaper=[[Eugene Register-Guard]] |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> In April, mirroring the situation that had happened with Kimball seven years previously, former singer Joseph Williams was arrested on drug-related charges.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gcVKAAAAIBAJ&dq=toto%20singer%20charges%20dropped&pg=3780%2C7110820 |title=Program OK'd |date=December 13, 1990 |newspaper=The Press-Courier}}</ref>

Lukather's first solo album was released in 1989, named ''[[Lukather]]'', and featured musicians such as [[Eddie Van Halen]] and [[Richard Marx]].

===1991–1992: ''Kingdom of Desire'' and Jeff Porcaro's death===
Once again without a lead vocalist, guitarist [[Steve Lukather]] sang lead vocals and became the new front man. Toto played at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1991 and the band recorded ''[[Kingdom of Desire]]'', which was released on Columbia Records in most parts of the world and on [[Clive Davis]]' label [[Relativity Records]] in the United States.

Jeff Porcaro died in an accident on August 5, 1992, at the age of 38 while working in his garden. According to the Los Angeles Times Report, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office lists the cause of death to be a heart attack from the hardening of the arteries caused by cocaine use.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-04/local/me-6355_1_jeff-porcaro |title=Drummer's Death Linked to Cocaine, Coroner Says : Autopsy: Report finds no evidence to support earlier belief that Toto's Jeff Porcaro died of an allergic reaction to a pesticide|author=Julie Tamaki |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 4, 1992 |access-date=November 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toto99.com/band/history/history4.shtml |title=Official TOTO Website – Band History |website=Toto99.com |date=August 5, 1992 |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref> Facing the prospect of a tour without Jeff, Toto almost broke up. However, Jeff Porcaro's family insisted the band continue. The band contacted Los Angeles-based Englishman [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] to replace Jeff Porcaro as they knew that Porcaro liked Phillips and because Lukather worked with Phillips on a previous tour with [[Santana (band)|Santana]] and [[Jeff Beck]] in Japan in 1986.

Phillips joined the band and they went on the tour, which they dedicated to Jeff's memory. In 1993 they released a live album called ''[[Absolutely Live (Toto album)|Absolutely Live]].'' From 1991 on, Steve Lukather would handle a majority of the vocals (until Bobby Kimball's return in 1998), but some older songs originally sung by Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams were put in the set list and sung by new backup singers Fred White (who was replaced by John James in 1992), Jackie McGee (who had joined for the 1990 tour and was replaced by Donna McDaniel in 1992) and Jenny Douglas-McRae (who had also come aboard in 1990). John sang "Stop Loving You" and Bobby's part on "Rosanna", Donna sang "Home of the Brave" and "Angel Don't Cry", and Jenny sang "Hold the Line".

On December 14, 1992, the Tribute to Jeff Porcaro Concert was held at Universal City's [[Universal Amphitheatre]]. Performers including [[Don Henley]], [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[Donald Fagen]], [[Walter Becker]], [[Boz Scaggs]], [[James Newton Howard]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], [[Richard Marx]] and special guest [[George Harrison]] performed various Toto songs along with the four remaining Toto members.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-16/entertainment/ca-1824_1_jeff-porcaro|title=A Rip-Roaring Tribute to Toto's Jeff Porcaro |last=Heckman |first=Don |date=December 16, 1992 |access-date=November 3, 2011 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> At the close of the tour, the band then took a break to pursue individual projects as well as to keep up their session schedules.

From March to November 1993, Lukather and Phillips teamed up with friends David Garfield and John Pena on the side project Los Lobotomys and recorded the album ''[[Candyman (album)|Candyman]]''.

===1995–1997: Addition of Simon Phillips and ''Tambu''===
In 1995 Toto recorded ''[[Tambu (album)|Tambu]]'', their first album with Simon Phillips, which saw the band back with CBS (now [[Sony]]). A departure from Toto's sound of the late 1970s and 1980s, ''Tambu'' was a very organic release and featured the single "I Will Remember", which received moderate radio play. Other singles released were "Drag Him To The Roof" and "The Turning Point". ''Tambu'' also featured John James and Jenny Douglas-McRae as backup singers on some of the tracks. Douglas-McRae even sang lead on the album's bonus track, "Blackeye", and also in a duet with Steve Lukather on "Baby He's Your Man". ''Tambu'' sold 600,000 copies worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The "Tambu Tour" proved to be another success, although there were no North American dates. Simon Phillips suffered from a back problem, so [[Gregg Bissonette]] had to fill in for him during the first leg of the tour in late 1995. The tour concluded in 1996. The rest of the tour personnel remained the same, with the exception of Donna McDaniel who had left in 1994 shortly after the "Night of the Proms" performances (which Douglas-McRae had missed since she was out touring with [[Joe Cocker]]). The song "Hold the Line" was now sung as a duet between James and Douglas-McRae.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toto99.com//band/former/guestmusicians.shtml#jenny|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230100105/http://www.toto99.com//band/former/guestmusicians.shtml#jenny|url-status=dead|title=Toto99.com|archive-date=December 30, 2006}}</ref>
Both James and Douglas-McRae were dropped from the band at the conclusion of the 1997 tour.

Lukather released his second solo album, ''[[Luke (album)|Luke]]'', which was a more "introspective" album than his previous solo album.

===1997–2001: ''Toto XX'', Bobby Kimball's return and ''Mindfields''===
1997 marked the band's 20th anniversary, and in order to commemorate it, David Paich and Steve Lukather started to go through several old tapes and demos for a special record of unreleased songs. In 1998 they released ''[[Toto XX]]'' with the single "Goin' Home". Toto went on a small promotional tour with former members [[Bobby Kimball]], [[Steve Porcaro]] and [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]].

After the "Toto XX" tour, Bobby Kimball rejoined the band as lead singer after 14 years. The band released ''[[Mindfields]]'' in early 1999 and embarked on the "Reunion" tour, touring worldwide and returning to the United States for the first time in six years. The new album featured three singles, "Melanie", "Cruel" and "Mad About You", a song co-written by David Paich and former Toto vocalist Joseph Williams. Later that year, a live album titled ''[[Livefields]]'' was released. The tour officially concluded in 2000, but the band played a few shows throughout 2001. David Paich briefly took a break from touring in 2000, so [[Jeff Babko]] filled in on keyboards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toto99.com//band/former/guestmusicians.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329060814/http://www.toto99.com//band/former/guestmusicians.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Toto99.com|archive-date=March 29, 2007}}</ref> Paich then resumed touring with Toto in 2001.

===2002–2003: ''Through the Looking Glass'' and Toto's 25th anniversary===
In 2002, in celebration of Toto's 25th anniversary, the band released ''[[Through the Looking Glass (Toto album)|Through the Looking Glass]]'', a covers album that paid tribute to the band's musical influences, such as Bob Marley, Steely Dan, The Beatles and Elton John. Two singles were released, "Could You Be Loved", a Bob Marley cover, and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", a Beatles cover. The album was not a commercial success and many fans were upset about the release, thinking that the band should have written new material instead.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web |url=http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/stevelukather04.html |title=Steve Lukather interview 2004 |website=Melodicrock.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> However, the record gave the band material to promote their "25th Anniversary Tour", which started in 2002 and concluded in 2003. After the tour, Toto released a live album and DVD of the show titled ''[[Live in Amsterdam (Toto album)|Live in Amsterdam]]''. Both the live album and the DVD were released in late 2003.

===2003–2005: Greg Phillinganes and David Paich's semi-retirement===

Beginning in June 2003, near the end of their "25th Anniversary Tour", keyboardist [[David Paich]] took a leave of absence from touring to spend time with a sick family member. Veteran keyboardist [[Greg Phillinganes]] filled in for Paich for the rest of the tour.

In late 2003, Toto headlined [[Night of the Proms]] for two months straight. Paich returned but was only able to play for a few weeks before he had to leave again, so Phillinganes once again filled in for the remainder of the shows. After Simon Phillips announced of illness, Jon Fariss and [[Ricky Lawson]] joined the band for the Night of the Proms. In early 2004, the band embarked on a world tour that went throughout 2004 and 2005. Paich only occasionally appeared, with Phillinganes playing at most of the shows. In 2005, Phillinganes was asked to become a regular member of the band and Paich retired from touring. Paich was still a member of Toto, however, as he continued to record and produce on all of Toto's releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toto99.com/band/band.shtml |title=Band Member Page |website=Toto99.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In October 2003, Steve Lukather released a [[Christmas album]] named ''[[Santamental]]'', featuring musicians such as [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Steve Vai]] and [[Gregg Bissonette]].

===2006–2008: ''Falling In Between'' and ''Falling In Between Live''===

[[File:Steve Lukather August 2007 B.jpg|thumb|Steve Lukather and Greg Phillinganes, in [[Trondheim]], Norway, August 4, 2007]]

In early 2006, Toto released ''[[Falling in Between]]'' on the Italian label [[Frontiers Records|Frontiers]], their first album of new material since 1999. The release featured extensive keyboard work from Steve Porcaro and a duet with Joseph Williams on the first single, "Bottom of Your Soul". Following the record's release, Toto embarked on an extensive worldwide tour in 2006, which continued into 2007 for a second leg. The 2007 leg featured [[Leland Sklar]] filling in on bass for Mike Porcaro due to an (at the time) undisclosed illness. 2007 featured extensive dates in both Europe and the United States, including an appearance at [[Moondance Jam]] in [[Walker, Minnesota]]. Former lead singer [[Fergie Frederiksen]] made a guest appearance at the Minneapolis date on May 5, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toto99.com/reviews/2007-usa1.shtml |title=Toto Concert Reviews |website=Toto99.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> and [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]] also made a few guest appearances with the band in June 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://josephwilliams.totoweb.org/index_en.html |title=Joseph Williams Official Site |website=Josephwilliams.totoweb.org |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

Toto released a two-CD set ''[[Falling in Between Live]]'' on [[Eagle Records]] to commemorate the tour. This live set marks the fourth for the band, following 1993's ''Absolutely Live'', 1999's ''Livefields'' and 2003's ''Live In Amsterdam''.

In 2008, a companion DVD of the show which was recorded in Paris in March 2007 was released.

===2008: First hiatus===
After a period of rumors and some allusions, on June 5, 2008, Lukather posted a message on his official website, stating, "The fact is yes I have left Toto. There is no more Toto. I just can't do it anymore and at 50 years old I wanted to start over and give it one last try on my own."<ref name="lukather announcement">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevelukather.net/Article.aspx?id=55 |title=Articles |website=Stevelukather.net |date=June 6, 2008 |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

As the main motivation for his decision, Lukather said: <blockquote>When Dave [Paich] retired that was REAL hard for me 'cause we started the band together. Hell, it's 35 years if you count High School where the core all met. When Mike [Porcaro] fell ill and had to leave that was it for me. If there isn't Paich or at least one Porcaro how can we even call it Toto? ... Honestly, I have just had enough. This is NOT a break. It is over. I really can't go out and play Hold The Line with a straight face anymore.</blockquote>Steve Lukather released his next solo album on February 22, 2008, named ''[[Ever Changing Times]]''.

===2010: Reformation===
On February 26, 2010, the band reformed and reunited for a brief tour of Europe in the summer to benefit [[Mike Porcaro]], who had been diagnosed with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. The lineup featured [[David Paich]], [[Steve Lukather]], [[Steve Porcaro]], [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]], [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]] and special guest [[Nathan East]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toto99.com/blog2010/index.php?/categories/1-Hot-News/P2.html |title=Hot News |website==Official TOTO Website |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

Steve Lukather stated that the band still exists: {{cquote|Edit to 2010.. well with Mike not being well and some of us missing each other the REAL high school friends (yes that includes Joe!!) got back together for the RIGHT reason.
People want to hear the hits played the way they were recorded, Joe has his voice back 100% and I loved having that power in front again and all REAL, BIG vocals again strong and seeing Paich AND Steve Porcaro with THOSE real keyboard sounds, Simon back and as Lee was busy having old pal Nate East step in.. it was so much fun and so successful we thought "Hmm, maybe a few gigs once in awhile would be fun" and we can make some money etc.. please some of the hard core fans. We ALL have outside careers that keep us all busy, not to mention families etc.. no one really wants to make new music, not a full record anyway. MAYBE a track someday but not in the near future. I am on tour for a year anyway and enjoying a very successful sold out solo tour and my record sales are better than they have ever been so I dont wanna mess THAT up and everyone has their own very busy successful lives and once in awhile.. why not right? There is no covert BS goin on here.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://totonetwork.com/forums/general/about-toto/does-toto-exist-or-not#comment-18814437 |title=Does Toto exist or not? |website=TotoNetwork.com |access-date=July 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717080113/http://totonetwork.com/forums/general/about-toto/does-toto-exist-or-not#comment-18814437 |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

On October 11, 2010, Steve Lukather released his next solo album, ''[[All's Well That Ends Well (Steve Lukather album)|All's Well That Ends Well]]''.

Another tour in the summer of 2011 took place with former backup singer Jenny Douglas once again joining. Their show on July 17, 2011, in Verona, Italy was recorded for a live DVD but has yet to be released because of a contractual issue with their former label. They once again toured Europe in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toto99.com/tourdates/calendar/list.php |title=Official TOTO Website – Tour Dates |website=Toto99.com |access-date=April 27, 2012}}</ref>

==Session work (1970s to early 1990s)==
Before, and during Toto, the members did various session work for a slew of notable musicians.
