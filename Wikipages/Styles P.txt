It was there he met lifelong friends [[Jadakiss]] and [[Sheek Louch]]. The trio bonded over their shared passion for [[hip hop]] and eventually formed a group known as [[The Lox]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1995400/bio|title=Styles P.|website=IMDb|access-date=2 April 2018}}</ref><ref name="complex1">{{cite web|last=Ortiz |first=Edwin |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/01/jadakiss-unhinged-the-combat-jack-show |title=Jadakiss Talks About Growing Up In Yonkers and The LOX's Relationship with Mary J.

==Musical career==
===1994–2000: The Lox===
[[File:Jadakiss Styles P.jpg|thumb|Styles P (left) performing with [[Jadakiss]]]]
As a trio, The Lox began rapping in the mid-1990s and started to build a steady underground following thanks to their performances and street freestyles. In their late teens, the trio met [[Mary J. Blige]] who was impressed with their lyrical content, and gave their demo to [[Sean Combs|Sean “Diddy” Combs]].<ref name="complex1"/> Diddy immediately hired the trio to write for [[Bad Boy Records]]. After signing with Bad Boy, the Lox quickly started collaborating on hits with Diddy, [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], Mary J. Blige and [[Mariah Carey]] which gave them instant notoriety and status within the hip-hop and mainstream charts.<ref name="complex1"/> In 1996 and 1997, the group wrote and performed on a number of Diddy hits, including "[[It's All About the Benjamins]]" and "I Got the Power", [[Mase]]'s "[[24 Hrs. to Live]]", Mariah Carey's "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]", the Notorious B.I.G.'s "Last Day" and Mary J. Blige's "Can’t Get You Off My Mind".<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|author=Vibe |url=http://www.vibe.com/photo-galleries/story-time-sheek-louch-recalls-studio-sessions-dmx-biggie-jay-z |title=Story Time: Sheek Louch Recalls Studio Sessions With DMX, Biggie & Jay-Z |publisher=Vibe |date=2010-09-28 |access-date=2015-08-14}}</ref> In 1997, the Lox received international acclaim when their tribute to the late Biggie Smalls, "We’ll Always Love Big Poppa", was picked as the B-side track from Diddy’s ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'' album (3x Platinum) with the number one hit, "[[I'll Be Missing You]]".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> This single was the most played hit in 1997, which opened the door for the Lox’s to write more of their own songs and eventually release their first album in January 1998 titled ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/money-power-respect-mw0000031595 |title=Money, Power & Respect - The LOX &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=1998-01-13 |access-date=2015-08-14}}</ref> The album went on to be certified platinum, and, although the album was a chart-topping success, the group grew to feel that the glossy image and production style of Bad Boy Records conflicted with their grimier rap aesthetic. After trying and failing to get [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]] to grant them a release from their contract, the group confronted him in his office, with Styles P throwing a chair at his own boss. After this, the group was granted their release and left Bad Boy to sign with [[Ruff Ryders Entertainment|Ruff Ryder Records]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/23/entertainment/ca-56625 |title=More Grime Than Shine, the LOX Moves On - latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2006-10-14 |access-date=2015-08-14 |first=Soren |last=Baker}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLaUUWHA5q0 |title=Jadakiss Recalls Styles P Throwing A Chair At Diddy So "The LOX" Could Leave Bad Boy Records |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>

After releasing another Lox album, ''[[We Are the Streets]]'' and appearing on albums with other Ruff Ryders artists, Styles released his first solo album, ''[[A Gangster and a Gentleman]]'', in 2002.<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|last=Birchmeier |first=Jason |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/styles-p-p693696 |title=Styles P |publisher=AllMusic |date=1974-11-28 |access-date=2012-03-30}}</ref> The album was supported by the hit single, [[Good Times (Styles P song)|Good Times]], which peaked at number 22 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]] and number 6 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]. The song also received widespread airplay on the radio throughout 2002. In 2004, Styles was featured on an alternate version of [[Akon]]’s hit debut single, [[Locked Up (song)|Locked Up]]. Two years later, he released his second album, ''[[Time Is Money (Styles P album)|Time is Money]]'' on Ruff Ryders which was followed by ''[[Super Gangster (Extraordinary Gentleman)]]'' a year later.<ref name="allmusic1"/>
