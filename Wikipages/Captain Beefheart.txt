Beefheart eventually formed a new Magic Band with a group of younger musicians and regained critical approval through three final albums: ''[[Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)|Shiny Beast]]'' (1978), ''[[Doc at the Radar Station]]'' (1980)  and ''[[Ice Cream for Crow]]'' (1982).

==Biography==

===Early life and musical influences, 1941–62===
Van Vliet was born Don Glen Vliet in [[Glendale, California]], on January 15, 1941, to Glen Alonzo Vliet, a [[filling station|service station]] owner of [[Dutch American|Dutch ancestry]] from [[Kansas]], and Willie Sue Vliet (née Warfield), who was from [[Arkansas]].<ref name="beefheart1"/>  He claimed to have as an ancestor Peter van Vliet, a Dutch painter who knew [[Rembrandt]]. Van Vliet also claimed that he was related to adventurer and author [[Richard Halliburton]] and the cowboy actor [[Slim Pickens]], and said that he remembered being born.<ref name="Barnes, Mike 2000"/><ref name="beefheart.com">{{cite web |first=Graham |last=Johnston |url=http://beefheart.com/zigzag/articles/mcint.htm |title=The Captain Beefheart Radar Station – Captain Beefheart |work=Beefheart.com |date=May 1, 1980 |access-date=February 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106165820/http://beefheart.com/zigzag/articles/mcint.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref>

Van Vliet began painting and sculpting at age three.<ref name="Rogers">Rogers, John (June 22, 1995). "[http://www.beefheart.com/caucasian/acclaim.htm Captain Beefheart Gaining International Acclaim—for Painting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329103649/http://www.beefheart.com/caucasian/acclaim.htm |date=March 29, 2006 }}". AP.</ref> His subjects reflected his "obsession" with animals, particularly dinosaurs, fish, African mammals and lemurs.<ref name="Barnes, Mike 2000 p.2">{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|p=2}}</ref> At the age of nine, he won a children's sculpting competition organised for the [[Los Angeles Zoo]] in [[Griffith Park]] by a local tutor, Agostinho Rodrigues.<ref name=Zoo>{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|p=4}}</ref> Local newspaper cuttings of his junior sculpting achievements can be found reproduced in the ''Splinters'' book, included in the ''Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh'' boxed CD work, released in 2004.<ref name="discogs.com">[http://www.discogs.com/Don-Van-Vliet-Riding-Some-Kind-Of-Unusual-Skull-Sleigh/release/2042457 ''Riding Some Kind Of Unusual Skull Sleigh''] Ltd. Ed. boxed work. Artist Ink Editions (2003), {{ISBN|0-7379-0284-1}}</ref> The sprawling park, with its zoo and [[Griffith Observatory|observatory]], had a strong influence on young Vliet, as it was a short distance from his home on Waverly Drive. The track "Observatory Crest" on ''Bluejeans & Moonbeams'' reflects this continued interest. A portrait photo of the school-age Vliet can be seen on the front of the lyric sheet within the first issue of the US release of ''Trout Mask Replica''.

For some time during the 1950s, Van Vliet worked as an apprentice with Rodrigues, who considered him a [[child prodigy]]. Vliet made claim to have been a lecturer at the [[Barnsdall Art Park|Barnsdall]] Art Institute in Los Angeles at the age of eleven,<ref name="Barnes, Mike 2000 p.2"/> although it is likely he simply gave a form of artistic dissertation. Accounts of Van Vliet's precocious achievement in art often include his statement that he sculpted on a weekly television show.<ref name="Winner">Winner, Langdon (May 14, 1970). ''[http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/odyssey.htm The Odyssey of Captain Beefheart] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315005436/http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/odyssey.htm |date=March 15, 2006 }}''. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.</ref> He claimed that his parents discouraged his interest in sculpture, based upon their perception of artists as "queer". They declined several scholarship offers,<ref name="Ankeny" /> including one from the local Knudsen Creamery to travel to Europe with six years' paid tuition to study [[marble sculpture]].<ref name="Don Van Vliet">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1182889/ Don Van Vliet], ''[[IMDb]]'' – David Letterman "Episode dated 11 November 1982 (1982) TV episode (as Captain Beefheart) ... Himself"</ref> Van Vliet later admitted personal hesitation to take the scholarship based upon the bitterness of his parents' discouragement.<ref>{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|p=6}}</ref>

Van Vliet's artistic enthusiasm became so fervent, he claimed that his parents were forced to feed him through the door in the room where he sculpted. When he was thirteen the family moved from the Los Angeles area to the more remote farming town of [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], in the [[Mojave Desert]], where there was a growing [[aerospace]] industry supported by nearby [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. It was an environment that would greatly influence him creatively from then on.<ref name="Winner" /> Van Vliet remained interested in art; several of his paintings, often reminiscent of [[Franz Kline]]<ref name="Ohrt">Ohrt, Roberto (1993). ''[http://www.beefheart.com/caucasian/ohrt.htm The Painting of Don Van Vliet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329103704/http://www.beefheart.com/caucasian/ohrt.htm |date=March 29, 2006 }}''. In ''Stand Up to Be Discontinued'', Cantz, {{ISBN|3-89322-595-1}}.</ref> were later used as front covers for his music albums. Meanwhile, he developed his taste and interest in music, listening "intensively" to the [[Delta blues]] of [[Son House]] and [[Robert Johnson]], jazz artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Cecil Taylor]], and the [[Chicago blues]] of [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Muddy Waters]].<ref name="Barnes, Mike 2000"/><ref name="Winner"/><ref name="beefheart2">{{cite web |first=Graham |last=Johnston |url=http://beefheart.com/zigzag/articles/study.htm |title=The Captain Beefheart Radar Station – A Study of Captain Beefheart |work=Beefheart.com |date=March 19, 1972 |access-date=February 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227022523/http://www.beefheart.com/zigzag/articles/study.htm |archive-date=February 27, 2010 }}</ref> During his early teenage years, Vliet would sometimes socialize with members of local bands such as the Omens and the  Blackouts, although his interests were still focused upon an art career.

Van Vliet claimed that he never attended public school, alleging "half a day of kindergarten" to be the extent of his formal education and saying that "if you want to be a different fish, you've got to jump out of the school". His associates said that he only dropped out during his senior year of high school to help support the family after his father's heart attack. His graduation picture appears in the school's yearbook.<ref>{{cite web |first=Graham |last=Johnston |url=http://www.beefheart.com/zigzag/pictures/graduation.htm |title=Don Vliet's Graduation Photograph |work=Beefheart.com |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817060133/http://www.beefheart.com/zigzag/pictures/graduation.htm |archive-date=August 17, 2011 }}</ref>  His claims to have never attended school – and his general disavowals of education – may have been related to his experience of [[dyslexia]] which, although never officially diagnosed, was obvious to sidemen such as [[John French (musician)|John French]] and [[Denny Walley]], who observed his difficulty reading cue-cards on stage, and his frequent need to be read aloud to.<ref>French, J.

Vliet's "Pepsi-moods" were ever a source of amusement to band members, leading Zappa to later write the wry tune "Why Doesn't Someone Give Him A Pepsi?" that featured on the ''[[Bongo Fury]]'' tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Frank-Zappa-Mothers-Muffin-Man-Goes-To-College/release/2552656 |title=Album track: "Why Doesn't Someone Give Him A Pepsi?" |work=Discogs.com |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref>

After Zappa began regular occupation at Paul Buff's [[Pal Recording Studio|PAL Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Cucamonga]] he and Van Vliet began collaborating, tentatively as ''the Soots'' (pronounced "suits"). By the time Zappa had turned the venue into [[Frank Zappa#Early 1960s: Studio Z|Studio Z]] the duo had completed some songs. These were ''Cheryl's Canon'', ''Metal Man Has Won His Wings'' and a [[Howlin' Wolf]] styled rendition of [[Little Richard]]'s ''[[Slippin' and Slidin']]''.<ref name=realFZ /> Further songs, on Zappa's ''[[Mystery Disc]]'' (1996), ''I Was a Teen-Age Malt Shop'' and ''The Birth of Captain Beefheart'' also provide an insight to Zappa's "teenage movie" script titled ''Captain Beefheart vs. the Grunt People'',<ref name="Gruntpeople">{{cite web | url=http://www.beefheart.com/zigzag/gruntpeople/index.html | title=Captain Beefheart vs. the Grunt People | access-date=March 17, 2007 | publisher=The Captain Beefheart Radar Station | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407111704/http://www.beefheart.com/zigzag/gruntpeople/index.html | archive-date=April 7, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> the first appearances of the Beefheart name. It has been suggested this name came from a term used by Vliet's Uncle Alan who had a habit of exposing himself to Don's girlfriend, Laurie Stone.

He said it made him sad and put "a beef in his heart". Carson appeared nervous and uncomfortable interviewing Van Vliet and after the next commercial break Van Vliet was gone. He would later claim in an appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' that the name referred to "a beef in my heart against this society".<ref name="Don Van Vliet"/> In the "Grunt People" draft script Beefheart and his mother play themselves, with his father played by Howlin' Wolf.

Van Vliet enrolled at [[Antelope Valley College]] as an art major, but decided to leave the following year. He once worked as a door-to-door [[vacuum cleaner]] salesman, and sold a vacuum cleaner to the writer [[Aldous Huxley]] at his home in [[Llano, California|Llano]], pointing to it and declaring, "Well I assure you sir, this thing sucks."<ref name="coley">{{cite web |first=Graham |last=Johnston |url=http://www.beefheart.com/zigzag/articles/rabbit.htm |title=The Captain Beefheart Radar Station – Captain Beefheart Pulls A Hat Out of His Rabbit |work=Beefheart.com |access-date=February 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918085914/http://beefheart.com/zigzag/articles/rabbit.htm |archive-date=September 18, 2010 }}</ref> After managing a [[Kinney Shoes|Kinney's]] shoe store, Van Vliet relocated to [[Rancho Cucamonga, California]], to reconnect with Zappa, who inspired his entry into musical performance. Van Vliet was quite shy but was eventually able to imitate the deep voice of [[Howlin' Wolf]] with his wide vocal range.<ref name="beefheart2"/><ref name="ZappaIT">Zappa, Frank (March 1977). ''International Times''.</ref> He eventually grew comfortable with public performance and, after learning to play the harmonica, began playing at dances and small clubs in Southern California.

===Initial recordings, 1962–69===
In early 1965 [[Alex St. Clair|Alex Snouffer]], a Lancaster [[rhythm and blues]] guitarist, invited Vliet to sing with a group that he was assembling. Vliet joined the first [[The Magic Band|Magic Band]] and changed his name to Don [[Van (Dutch)|Van]] Vliet, while Snouffer became Alex St. Clair (sometimes spelled ''Claire''). Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band signed to [[A&M Records|A&M]] and released two singles in 1966. The first was a version of [[Bo Diddley]]'s "[[Diddy Wah Diddy]]" that became a regional hit in Los Angeles. The followup, "Moonchild" (written by [[David Gates]], later of the band [[Bread (band)|Bread]]) was less well received. The band played music venues that catered to underground artists, such as the [[Avalon Ballroom]] in San Francisco.<ref>{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|p=27}}</ref>

====''Safe as Milk''====
After fulfilling their deal for two singles the band presented demos to A&M during 1966 for what would become the ''[[Safe as Milk]]'' album. A&M's [[Jerry Moss]] reportedly described this new direction as "too negative"<ref name="Ankeny" /> and dropped the band from the label, although still under contract. Much of the demo recording was accomplished at [[Art Laboe]]'s Original Sound Studio, then with [[Gary Marker]] on the controls at [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound]] on 8-track. By the end of 1966 they were signed to [[Buddah Records]] and much of the demo work was transferred to 4-track, at the behest of [[Bob Krasnow|Krasnow]] and [[Richard Perry|Perry]], in the RCA Studio in Hollywood, where the recording was finalized. Tracks that were originally laid down in the demo by Doug Moon are therefore taken up by [[Ry Cooder]]'s work in the release, as Moon had departed over "musical differences" at this juncture.

Drummer [[John French (musician)|John French]] had now joined the group and it would later (notably on ''Trout Mask Replica'') be his patience that was required to transcribe Van Vliet's creative ideas (often expressed by whistling or banging on the piano) into musical form for the other group members. On French's departure this role was taken over by [[Bill Harkleroad]] for ''Lick My Decals Off, Baby''.<ref>Harkleroad, Bill (1998). ''Lunar Notes: Zoot Horn Rollo's Captain Beefheart Experience''. Interlink Publishing. {{ISBN|0-946719-21-7}}. p. 67</ref>

Many of the lyrics on the ''Safe as Milk'' album were written by Van Vliet in collaboration with the writer [[Herb Bermann]], who befriended Van Vliet after seeing him perform at a bar-gig in Lancaster in 1966. The song "[[Electricity (Captain Beefheart song)|Electricity]]" was a poem written by Bermann, who gave Van Vliet permission to adapt it to music.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web |first=Graham |last=Johnston |url=http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/herb1.htm |title=The Captain Beefheart Radar Station – Herb Bermann interview pt 1 |work=Beefheart.com |access-date=February 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020115103/http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/herb1.htm |archive-date=October 20, 2008 }}</ref>  Unlike the album's mostly blues rock sound, songs such as "Electricity" illustrated the band's unconventional instrumentation and Van Vliet's unusual vocals, which guitarist Doug Moon described as "hinting of things to come".{{quote without source|date=September 2018}}

Much of the ''Safe as Milk'' material was honed and arranged by the arrival of 20-year–old guitar prodigy Ry Cooder, who had been brought into the group after much pressure from Vliet. The band began recording in spring 1967, with [[Richard Perry]] cutting his teeth in his first job as producer. The album was released in September 1967. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic called the album "blues–rock gone slightly askew, with jagged, fractured rhythms, soulful, twisting vocals from Van Vliet, and more doo wop, soul, straight blues, and folk–rock influences than he would employ on his more [[avant garde]] outings".

====Recognition====
Among those who took notice were [[the Beatles]]. Both [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] were known as great admirers of Beefheart.<ref name="ru.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.ru.org/92bookrev2.html |title=Book Review: Zoot Horn Rollo's Captain Beefheart Experience |work=Ru.org |access-date=February 11, 2010}}</ref> Lennon displayed two of the album's promotional "baby bumper stickers" in the sunroom at his home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/albums/official/pics/lennonsam.jpg |title=Photo of John Lennon lounging at his Surrey home, with "Safe as Milk" bumper stickers visible |access-date=February 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616182238/http://www.beefheart.com/datharp/albums/official/pics/lennonsam.jpg |archive-date=June 16, 2011 }}</ref> Later, the Beatles planned to sign Beefheart to their experimental [[Zapple]] label (plans that were scrapped after [[Allen Klein]] took over the group's management). Van Vliet was often critical of the Beatles, however. He considered the lyric "I'd love to turn you on" from their song ''[[A Day in the Life]]'', to be ridiculous and conceited. Tiring of their "lullabies",<ref name="Barnes, p.142">{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|p=142}}</ref> he lampooned them with the ''Strictly Personal'' song ''Beatle Bones 'n' Smokin' Stones'', that featured the sardonic refrain of "strawberry fields, all the winged eels slither on the heels of today's children, [[Strawberry Fields Forever|strawberry fields forever]]". Vliet spoke badly of Lennon after getting no response when he sent a telegram of support to him and wife [[Yoko Ono]] during their 1969 "[[Bed-In]] for peace". Vliet and the band met McCartney in a [[Cannes]] hotel nightclub during their tour of Europe on January 27, 1968, urinated together on a statue outside the hotel at the prodding of journalists and photographers,{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} and participated in a jam session together with McCartney and [[Penny Nichols]]. Producer attempts to convince McCartney to switch labels to Kama Sutra obstructed the possibility of a pleasant evening.<ref>French, pp. 324–326</ref> McCartney later said he had no recollection of this meeting.<ref>{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|p=144}}</ref>

====The flipside of success====
Doug Moon left the band because of his dislike of the band's increasing experimentation outside his preferred blues genre. Ry Cooder told of Moon's becoming so angered by Van Vliet's unrelenting criticism that he walked into the room pointing a loaded [[crossbow]] at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, "Get that fucking thing out of here, get out of here and get back in your room", which he did.<ref name="artist formerly known"/> (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have "passed through" the studio with a weapon.)<ref>French, John. ''Beefheart: Through The Eyes Of Magic'', pp.206–207. {{ISBN|978-0-9561212-1-9}}</ref> Moon was present during the early demo sessions at [[Original Sound|Original Sound studio]], above the [[Kama Sutra Records|Kama Sutra]]/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound]] with Marker.<ref>''Grow Fins'' CD box set booklet p.39 [also in vinyl set booklet].</ref> Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would have a profound effect on the quality of the ''Safe as Milk'' work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.

To support the album's release the group had been scheduled to play at the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. During this period Vliet suffered severe [[panic attack|anxiety attacks]] that made him convinced that he was having a heart attack, possibly exacerbated by his heavy [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] use and the fact that his father had died of heart failure a few years earlier. At a vital "warm-up" performance at the [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival]] (June 10–11) shortly before the scheduled Monterey Festival (June 16–18), the band began to play "Electricity" and Van Vliet froze, straightened his tie, then walked off the {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} stage and landed on manager [[Bob Krasnow]]. He later claimed he had seen a girl in the audience turn into a fish, with bubbles coming from her mouth.<ref>French, John. ''Beefheart: Through The Eyes Of Magic'', p. 253. {{ISBN|978-0-9561212-1-9}}</ref> This aborted any opportunity of breakthrough success at Monterey, as Cooder immediately decided he could no longer work with Van Vliet,<ref name="artist formerly known"/> effectively quitting both the event and the band on the spot. With such complex guitar parts there was no means for the band to find a competent replacement in time for Monterey. Cooder's spot was eventually filled for a short spell by Gerry McGee, who had played with [[The Monkees (album)|the Monkees]]. According to French the band did two gigs with McGee, one of which was at ''The Peppermint Twist'' near Long Beach. The other was at [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]], August 7, 1967, as opening act for [[the Yardbirds]].<ref name="John French p264">French, John. ''Beefheart: Through The Eyes Of Magic'' p. 264. {{ISBN|978-0-9561212-1-9}}</ref> McGee was in the group long enough to have an outfit made by a Santa Monica boutique<ref name="John French p264"/> that also created the gear worn by the band on the ''Strictly Personal'' cover stamps.

====''Strictly Personal''====
In August 1967, guitarist [[Jeff Cotton]] filled the guitar spot vacated, in turn, by Cooder and McGee. In October and November 1967 the Snouffer/Cotton/Handley/French line–up recorded material for what was planned to be the second album. Originally intended to be a double album called ''It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper'' for the {{sic|hide=y|Buddah}} label, it was released later in pieces in 1971 and 1995. After rejection from Buddah, Bob Krasnow encouraged the band to re-record four of the shorter numbers, add two more, and make shorter versions of "Mirror Man" and "Kandy Korn". Krasnow created a strange mix full of "phasing" that, by most accounts (including Beefheart's), diminished the music's strength. This was released in October 1968 as ''[[Strictly Personal]]'' on Krasnow's [[Blue Thumb Records|Blue Thumb]] label.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axuUrjcnX5sC&q=It+Comes+to+You+in+a+Plain+Brown+Wrapper&pg=PA46 |title=Captain Beefheart – Google Books |isbn=9781844494125 |access-date=January 25, 2010 |last1=Barnes |first1=Mike |year=2004 }}</ref> Stewart Mason in his Allmusic review of the album described it as a "terrific album" and a "fascinating, underrated release&nbsp;... every bit the equal of ''Safe as Milk'' and ''Trout Mask Replica''".<ref name="Mason, AllMusic" /> [[Langdon Winner]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called ''Strictly Personal'' "an excellent album. The guitars of the Magic Band mercilessly bend and stretch notes in a way that suggests that the world of music has wobbled clear off its axis", with the lyrics demonstrating "Beefheart's ability to juxtapose delightful humor with frightening insights".<ref name=autogenerated2>Winner, Langdon (May 14, 1970).

====''Mirror Man''====
In 1971 some of the recordings done for Buddah were released as ''[[Mirror Man (Captain Beefheart album)|Mirror Man]]'', bearing a [[liner note]] stating that the material had been recorded in "one night in Los Angeles in 1965". This was a ruse to circumvent possible [[copyright]] issues. The material was recorded in November and December 1967. Essentially a "[[jam session|jam]]" album, described as pushing "the boundaries of conventional blues–rock, with a Beefheart vocal tossed in here and there. Some may miss Beefheart's surreal poetry, gruff vocals, and/or free jazz influence, while others may find it fascinating to hear the Magic Band simply letting go and cutting loose."<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url= {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r416897|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Mirror Man Sessions &gt; Overview |website= Allmusic |date=June 1, 1999 |access-date=February 11, 2010}}</ref> The album's "miss-credit errors" also state band members as "Alex St. Clare Snouffer" (Alex St. Clare/Alexis Snouffer), "Antennae Jimmy Simmons" (Semens/Jeff Cotton) and "Jerry Handsley" (Handley). First vinyl was issued in both a die-cut gatefold (revealing a "cracked" mirror) and a single sleeve with same image. The UK Buddah issue was part of the Polydor-manufactured "Select" series.

During his first trip to England in January 1968, Captain Beefheart was briefly represented in the UK by [[mod (subculture)|mod]] icon [[Peter Meaden]], an early manager of [[the Who]]. The Captain and his band members were initially denied entry to the United Kingdom, because Meaden had illegally booked them for gigs without applying for appropriate [[work permit]]s.<ref>{{cite web |first=Graham |last=Johnston |url=http://www.beefheart.com/zigzag/articles/refuse.htm |title=Refusal of Leave to Land Report, dated 24 January 1968 |work=Beefheart.com |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817060153/http://www.beefheart.com/zigzag/articles/refuse.htm |archive-date=August 17, 2011 }}</ref> After returning to Germany for a few days, press coverage and public outcry resulted in the band being permitted to re-enter the UK, where they recorded material for [[John Peel]]'s radio show and on Friday January 19 appeared at the ''Middle Earth'' venue, introduced by Peel, where they played tracks from ''Safe as Milk'' and some of the experimental blues tracks from ''Mirror Man''. The band was met by an enthusiastic audience; French recalled the event as a rare high moment for the band: "After the show, we were taken to the dressing room where we sat for hours as a line of what seemed like hundreds of people walked in one by one to shake our hand or get an autograph. Many brought imports of ''Safe as Milk'' with them for us to autograph ... It seemed like we had finally gained some reward ... Suddenly all the criticizing and intimidation and eccentricities seemed very unimportant. It was a glorious moment, one of the very few I ever experienced".<ref>French, p. 316</ref> By this time, they had terminated their association with Meaden. On January 27, 1968, Beefheart performed in the [[MIDEM|MIDEM Music Festival]] on the beach at [[Cannes]], France.

Alex St. Claire left the band in June 1968 after their return from a second European tour and was replaced by teenager Bill Harkleroad; bassist Jerry Handley left a few weeks later.

====''The 'Brown Wrapper' Sessions''====
After their Euro tour and the Cannes beach performance the band returned to the US. Moves were already in the air for them to leave Buddah and sign to MGM and, prior to their May tour – mainly in the UK – they re-recorded some Buddah material of the partial ''Mirror Man'' sessions at Sunset Sound with [[Bruce Botnick]]. Beefheart had also been conceptualizing new band names, including ''25th Century Quaker'' and ''Blue Thumb'',<ref>French, John. ''Beefheart: Through The Eyes Of Magic'', p327 – 329. {{ISBN|978-0-9561212-1-9}}</ref> while making suggestions to other musicians that they might get involved. The thought-process of ''25th Century Quaker'' was that it would be a "blues band" alias for the more avant-garde work of the Magic Band. Photographer Guy Webster photographed the band in Quaker-style outfits, and the picture appears in ''The Mirror Man Sessions'' CD insert. It would later transpire that much of this situation was transient and that Buddah's Bob Krasnow was to set up his own label. The label that was unsurprisingly named ''[[Blue Thumb Records|Blue Thumb]]'' launched with its first release ''Strictly Personal'', a truncated version of the original Beefheart vision of a double album. Thus "25th Century Quaker" became a track and a potential band-name [[Blue Thumb Records|became a label]].

In overview, the works for the double album in this period were intended to be packaged in a plain brown wrapper, with a "strictly personal" over-stamp and addressed in a manner that could have connotations of drug content, pornographic or illicit material; as per the small ads of the time: "It comes to you in a plain brown wrapper." Given that Krasnow had effectively poached the band from Buddah there were limitations on what material could be released. ''Strictly Personal'' was the result, contained in its enigmatically-addressed parcel sleeve. The raft of material left behind eventually emerged, firstly on CD as ''I May Be Hungry, But I Sure Ain't Weird'' and later on vinyl, implemented by John French, as ''It Comes To You in a Plain Brown Wrapper'' (which has two tracks that are missing from the former release). Both ''Blue Thumb'' and the stamps on the cover of ''Strictly Personal'' have LSD connotations, as does the track ''Ah Feel Like Ahcid'', although Beefheart himself refuted this (claiming that this is a rendering of "I feel like I said").

===''Trout Mask Replica'', 1969===
Critically acclaimed as Van Vliet's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]],<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/captainbeefheart/biography |title=Captain Beefheart: Biography |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=February 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924040000/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/captainbeefheart/biography |archive-date=September 24, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' was released as a 28 track double album in June 1969 on [[Frank Zappa]]'s newly formed [[Straight Records]] label. First issues, in the US, were [[Record changer#Automatic sequencing|auto-coupled]] and housed in the black "Straight" liners along with a 6-page lyric sheet illustrated by [[the Mascara Snake]]. A school-age portrait of Van Vliet appears on the front of this sheet, while the cover of the gatefold enigmatically shows Beefheart in a [[Religious Society of Friends|'Quaker']] hat, obscuring his face with the head of a fish. The fish is a [[carp]] – arguably a "replica" for a trout, photographed by [[Cal Schenkel]]. The inner spread "[[infra-red]]" photography is by [[Ed Caraeff]], whose Beefheart vacuum cleaner images from this session also appear on Zappa's ''[[Hot Rats]]'' release (a month earlier) to accompany "Willie The Pimp" lyrics sung by Vliet. Alex St. Clair had now left the band and, after Junior Madeo from the Blackouts was considered,<ref>French, John. ''Beefheart: Through The Eyes Of Magic'', p359. {{ISBN|978-0-9561212-1-9}}</ref> the role was filled by Bill Harkleroad. Bassist Jerry Handley had also departed, with Gary Marker stepping in. Thus the long rehearsals for the album began in the house on Ensenada Drive in Woodland Hills, L.A.,<ref name="Grow Fins' p107">''Grow Fins'' CD box set booklet p.107 [also in vinyl set booklet].</ref><ref>Harkleroad, Bill. ''Lunar Notes'' p22-23. {{ISBN|0-946719-21-7}}</ref> that would become the Magic Band House.

The Magic Band began recordings for ''Trout Mask Replica'' with bassist [[Gary Marker|Gary "Magic" Marker]] at [[TTG Studios|T.T.G.]] (on "Moonlight on Vermont" and "Veteran's Day Poppy"),<ref>''Grow Fins'' CD box set booklet p.51 [also in vinyl set booklet].</ref> but later enlisted bassist [[Mark Boston]] after his departure. The remainder of the album was recorded at Whitney Studios, with some [[field recording]]s made at the house.<ref name="Grow Fins' p107"/> Boston was acquainted with French and Harkleroad via past bands. Van Vliet had also begun assigning nicknames to his band members, so Harkleroad became ''[[Zoot Horn Rollo]]'', and Boston became ''[[Rockette Morton]]'', while John French assumed the name ''[[John French (musician)|Drumbo]]'', and Jeff Cotton became ''[[Antennae Jimmy Semens]]''. Van Vliet's cousin Victor Hayden, ''[[the Mascara Snake]]'', performed as a bass clarinetist later in the proceedings.<ref>{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|pp=70–71}}</ref> Vliet's girlfriend Laurie Stone, who can be heard laughing at the beginning of ''Fallin' Ditch'', became an [[audio typist]]<ref>''Grow Fins'' CD box set booklet p.99 [also in vinyl set booklet].</ref> at the Magic Band house.

Van Vliet wanted the whole band to "live" the ''Trout Mask Replica'' album. The group rehearsed Van Vliet's difficult compositions for eight months, living [[commune (intentional community)|communally]] in their small rented house in the [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills]] suburb of Los Angeles. With only two bedrooms the band members would find sleep in various corners of one, while Vliet occupied the other and rehearsals were accomplished in the main living area. Van Vliet implemented his vision by completely dominating his musicians, artistically and emotionally. At various times one or another of the group members was "put in the barrel", with Van Vliet berating him continually, sometimes for days, until the musician collapsed in tears or in total submission.<ref>[http://vpinterviews.blogspot.com/2005/04/magic-band.html The Magic Band], ''vanity project interviews'', April 2005.</ref> Guitarist Bill Harkleroad complained that his fingers were a "bloody mess" as a result of Beefheart's orders that he use heavy strings.<ref>Gore, Joe.

With no income other than [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and contributions from relatives, the group barely survived and were even arrested for shoplifting food (Zappa bailed them out).<ref>From Straight to Bizarre – Zappa, Beefheart, Alice Cooper and LA's Lunatic Fringe, DVD, 2012</ref> French has recalled living on no more than a small cup of beans a day for a month.<ref name="artist formerly known"/> A visitor described their appearance as "cadaverous" and said that "they all looked in poor health". Band members were restricted from leaving the house and practiced for 14 or more hours a day.

John French's 2010 book ''Through the Eyes of Magic'' describes some of the "talks", which were initiated by his doing such things as playing a Frank Zappa drum part ("The Blimp (mousetrapreplica)") in his drumming shed, and not having finished drum parts as quickly as Beefheart wanted. French writes of being punched by band members, thrown into walls, kicked, punched in the face by Beefheart hard enough to draw blood, being attacked with a sharp [[broomstick]].<ref>French, p. 7</ref> Eventually Beefheart, French says, threatened to throw him out an upper&nbsp;floor window. He admits complicity in similarly attacking his bandmates during "talks" aimed at them. In the end, after the album's recording, Beefheart ejected French from the band by throwing him down a set of stairs, telling him to "Take a walk, man" after not responding in a desired manner to a request to "play a strawberry" on the drums. Beefheart replaced French with drummer Jeff Bruschel, an acquaintance of Hayden. Referred to as "Fake Drumbo" (playing on French's drumset) this final act resulted in French's name not appearing on the album credits, either as a player or arranger. Bruschel toured with the band to Europe but was replaced by the next recording.

According to Van Vliet, the 28 songs on the album were written in a single 8½&nbsp;hour session at the piano, an instrument he had no skill in playing, an approach Mike Barnes compared to [[John Cage]]'s "maverick irreverence toward classical tradition",<ref name="Barnes71">{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|p=71}}</ref> though band members have stated that the songs were written over the course of about a year, beginning around December 1967. (The band did watch [[Federico Fellini]]'s 1963 film ''[[8½]]'' during the creation of the album). It took the band about eight months to mold the songs into shape, with French bearing primary responsibility for transposing and shaping Vliet's piano fragments into guitar and bass lines, which were mostly notated on paper.<ref name="Miles 2005 pp. 182">[[Miles, Barry]] (2005). ''Zappa: A Biography'', Grove Press, pp. 182–183.</ref> Harkleroad in 1998 said in retrospect: "We're dealing with a strange person, coming from a place of being a sculptor/painter, using music as his [[idiom]].

The album's cover artwork was photographed and designed by [[Cal Schenkel]] and shows Van Vliet wearing the raw head of a carp, bought from a local fish market and fashioned into a mask by Schenkel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.united-mutations.com/s/cal_schenkel.htm |title=United Mutations interview with Schenkel |publisher=United-mutations.com |access-date=February 11, 2010}}</ref>

''Trout Mask Replica'' incorporated a wide variety of musical styles, including blues, avant garde/experimental, and rock. The relentless practice prior to recording blended the music into an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]]ic whole of [[contrapuntal]] [[tempo]]s, featuring [[slide guitar]], [[polyrhythmic]] drumming (with French's drums and cymbals covered in cardboard), honking saxophone and [[bass clarinet]]. Van Vliet's vocals range from his signature [[Howlin' Wolf]]-inspired growl to frenzied [[falsetto]] to laconic, casual ramblings.

The instrumental backing was effectively recorded live in the studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window.<ref name="Chusid">[[Irwin Chusid|Chusid, Irwin]] (2000). ''Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music'', pp. 129–140. London: Cherry Red Books. {{ISBN|1-901447-11-1}}</ref> Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, "[it was] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It seemed to me that if he was going to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not."<ref name="artist formerly known"/>

Van Vliet used the ensuing publicity, particularly with a 1970 ''Rolling Stone'' interview with Langdon Winner, to promulgate a number of myths that were subsequently quoted as fact. Winner's article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor the members of the Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad later contradicted this. Van Vliet claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Boston to play their instruments from scratch; in fact the pair were already accomplished young musicians before joining the band.<ref name="Chusid"/> Last, Van Vliet claimed to have gone a year and half without sleeping. When asked how this was possible, he claimed to have only eaten fruit.<ref name="beefheart.com"/>

Critic Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]] writes that the album's influence "was felt more in spirit than in direct copycatting, as a catalyst rather than a literal musical starting point. However, its inspiring reimagining of what was possible in a rock context laid the groundwork for countless experiments in rock surrealism to follow, especially during the [[punk (music)|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] era."<ref name="Huey">{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r3289|pure_url=yes}} | title=Trout Mask Replica | access-date=March 17, 2007 | last= Huey |first= Steve | website=Allmusic}}</ref> In 2003, the album was ranked sixtieth by ''Rolling Stone'' in their list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]: "On first listen, ''Trout Mask Replica'' sounds like raw [[Delta blues]]", with Beefheart "singing and ranting and reciting poetry over fractured guitar licks. But the seeming sonic chaos is an illusion—to construct the songs, the Magic Band rehearsed twelve hours a day for months on end in a house with the windows blacked out. (Producer Frank Zappa was then able to record most of the album in less than five hours.) Tracks such as 'Ella Guru' and 'My Human Gets Me Blues' are the direct predecessors of modern musical primitives such as [[Tom Waits]] and [[PJ Harvey]]."<ref name="Posted Nov 01, 0003 12:00 AM"/> Guitarist [[Fred Frith]] noted that during this process "forces that usually emerge in improvisation are harnessed and made constant, repeatable".<ref name="Fred Frith"/>

Critic [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album a B+, saying, "I find it impossible to give this record an A because it is just too weird. But I'd like to.

''[[Lick My Decals Off, Baby]]'' (1970) continued in a similarly experimental vein.

An early promotional music video was made of its title song, and a bizarre television commercial was also filmed that included excerpts from ''Woe-Is-uh-Me-Bop'', silent footage of masked Magic Band members using kitchen utensils as musical instruments, and Beefheart kicking over a bowl of what appears to be porridge onto a dividing stripe in the middle of a road. The video was rarely played but was accepted into the [[Museum of Modern Art]], where it has been used in several programs related to music.<ref name="ReferenceA">''[http://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/audios/47/962 Music Video: The Industry and Its Fringes]'', Museum of Modern Art, September 6–30, 1985</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">''[http://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/audios/47/956 Looking at Music]'', Museum of Modern Art, August 13, 2008 – January 5, 2009</ref>

''Lick My Decals Off, Baby'' was the first record on which the band was credited as "''The''" Magic Band, rather than "''His''" Magic Band.

====''The Spotlight Kid'' and ''Clear Spot''====
[[File:Captain Beefheart.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Beefheart performing at [[Convocation Hall (University of Toronto)|Convocation Hall]], Toronto, in 1974.]]
The next two records, ''[[The Spotlight Kid]]'' (simply credited to "Captain Beefheart") and ''[[Clear Spot]]'' (credited to "Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band"), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of ''The Spotlight Kid'' is, according to one critic, "definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam". And though "things do sound maybe just a little too blasé", "Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best."<ref>Raggett, Ned.[http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-spotlight-kid-r60669 "The Spotlight Kid"] allmusic. Retrieved December 19, 2010.</ref> The music is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original ''Trout Mask Replica'' and the frenetic ''Lick My Decals Off, Baby''. This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous two years—at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents.<ref>{{harvnb|French|pp=563–564}}</ref> Van Vliet offered that he "got tired of scaring people with what I was doing ... I realized that I had to give them something to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music".<ref name=barnes155>{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|p=155}}</ref> Magic Band members have also said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated in that he almost never rehearsed with the group.<ref name=barnes155/> In the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near [[Ben Lomond, California]] and then in northern California near [[Trinidad, California|Trinidad]].{{sfn|French|p=558–565}} The situation saw a return to the physical violence and [[psychological manipulation]] that had taken place during the band's previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing ''Trout Mask Replica''. According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad.{{sfn|French|p=563}} In his autobiography Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.<ref>Harkleroad, p. 67</ref>

''Clear Spot'''s production credit of [[Ted Templeman]] made ''AllMusic'' consider "why in the world [it] wasn't more of a commercial success than it was", and that while fans "of the fully all-out side of Beefheart might find the end result not fully up to snuff as a result, but those less concerned with pushing back all borders all the time will enjoy his unexpected blend of everything tempered with a new accessibility". The review called the song "Big Eyed Beans from Venus" "a fantastically strange piece of aggression".<ref>Raggett, Ned. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/clear-spot-r3295 ''Clear Spot''], ''AllMusic''. Retrieved December 19, 2010.</ref> A ''Clear Spot'' song, "Her Eyes Are A Blue Million Miles", appeared on [[The Big Lebowski#Soundtrack|the soundtrack]] of the [[Coen brothers]]' cult comedy film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998).

====''Unconditionally Guaranteed'' and ''Bluejeans & Moonbeams''====
In 1974, immediately after the recording of ''[[Unconditionally Guaranteed]]'', which markedly continued the trend towards a more commercial sound heard on some of the ''Clear Spot'' tracks, the Magic Band's original members departed. Disgruntled and past members worked together for a period, gigging at [[Blue Lake, California|Blue Lake]] and putting together their own ideas and demos, with John French earmarked as the vocalist. These concepts eventually coalesced around the core of [[Art Tripp|Art Tripp III]], Harkleroad and Boston, with the formation of [[Mallard (band)|Mallard]], helped by finance and UK recording facilities from [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull's]] [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]].<ref>French, John. ''Beefheart: Through The Eyes Of Magic'', pp.608–609. {{ISBN|978-0-9561212-1-9}}</ref><ref>Harkleroad, Bill. ''Lunar Notes'' pp.132–133. {{ISBN|0-946719-21-7}}</ref> Some of French's compositions were used in the band's work, but the group's singer was Sam Galpin and the role of keyboardist was eventually taken by John Thomas, who had shared a house with French in [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] at the time. At this time Vliet attempted to recruit both French and Harkleroad as producers for his next album, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Andy Di Martino produced both of these [[Virgin Records|Virgin label]] albums.

Vliet was forced to quickly form a new Magic Band to complete support-tour dates, with studio musicians who had no experience with his music and in fact had never heard it. Having no knowledge of the previous Magic Band style, they simply improvised what they thought would go with each song, playing much slicker versions that have been described as "bar band" versions of Beefheart songs. A review described this incarnation of the Magic Band as the "Tragic Band", a term that has stuck over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saltpublishing.com/books/sscl/1844710599.htm|title=That Blues Thing: Enter Captain Beefheart|first1=Michel|last1=Delville|first2=Andrew|last2=Norris|year=2005|access-date=November 20, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101042738/http://www.saltpublishing.com/books/sscl/1844710599.htm|archive-date=January 1, 2009}}</ref>

Mike Barnes said that the description of the new band "grooving along pleasantly", was "...{{nbsp}}an appropriately banal description of the music of a man who only a few years ago composed with the expressed intent of shaking listeners out of their torpor".<ref>{{harvnb|Barnes|2000|p=203}}</ref> The one album they recorded, ''[[Bluejeans & Moonbeams]]'' (1974) has, like its predecessor, a completely different, almost [[soft rock]] sound from any other Beefheart record.

====''Bongo Fury'' to ''Bat Chain Puller''====
By the fall of 1975 the band had completed their European tour, with further US dates in the New Year of 1976, supporting Zappa along with [[Dr. John]]. Van Vliet now found himself stuck in a web of contractual hang-ups. At this point Zappa had begun to extend a helping hand, with Vliet already having performed incognito as "Rollin' Red" on Zappa's ''[[One Size Fits All (Frank Zappa album)|One Size Fits All]]'' (1975) and then joining with him on the ''[[Bongo Fury]]'' album and its later support tour. Two Vliet-penned numbers on the ''Bongo Fury'' album are "Sam with the Showing Scalp Flat Top" and "Man with the Woman Head". The form, texture and imagery of this album's first track, "Debra Kadabra", sung by Vliet, has 'angular similarities' to the work he would later produce in his next three albums. On the ''Bongo Fury'' album Vliet also sings "Poofter's Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead", harmonizes on "200 Years Old" and "Muffin Man", and plays harmonica and soprano saxophone.

In early 1976 Zappa put on his producer hat and, once again, opened up his studio facilities and finance to Vliet. This was for the production of an album provisionally titled ''[[Bat Chain Puller]]''. The band were John French (drums), John Thomas (keyboards) and Jeff Moris Tepper and Denny Walley (guitars). Much of the work on this album had been finalized and some demos had been circulated when fate once again struck the Beefheart camp. In May 1976 the long association between Zappa and his manager/business partner [[Herb Cohen]] ceased. This resulted in Zappa's finances and ongoing works becoming part of protracted legal negotiations. The ''Bat Chain Puller'' project went "on ice" and did not see an official release until 2012.<ref name="GZonBCP20110624">{{cite web

====''Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)''====
Having extricated himself from a mire of contractual difficulties Beefheart emerged with this new album, in 1978, on the [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros]] label. ''[[Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)]]'' contained re-workings of the shelved ''Bat Chain Puller'' album and still retained its original guitarist, [[Moris Tepper|Jeff Moris Tepper]]. However, he and Vliet were now joined by a whole new line-up of [[Richard Redus]] (guitar, bass and accordion), [[Eric Drew Feldman]] (bass, piano and synthesizer), [[Bruce Fowler|Bruce Lambourne Fowler]] (trombone and air bass), [[Art Tripp]] (percussion and marimba) and [[Robert Williams (drummer)|Robert Arthur Williams]] (drums). The album was co-produced by Vliet with Pete Johnson. Members of this Magic Band and the "Bat Chain" elements would later feature on Beefheart's last two albums. ''Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)'' was described by Ned Raggett of Allmusic to be "...{{nbsp}}manna from heaven for those feeling Beefheart had lost his way on his two Mercury albums".<ref>{{cite web|last=Raggett |first=Ned |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r32279|pure_url=yes}} |title=Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) &gt; Overview  |website= Allmusic |access-date=February 11, 2010}}</ref> Following Vliet's death, John French claimed the 40-second spoken word track "Apes-Ma" to be an analogy of Van Vliet's deteriorating physical condition.<ref>French, John.[http://blog.beefheart.com/2010/12/john-frenchs-tribute-to-don-van-vliet.html John French's tribute to Don Van Vliet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226013223/http://blog.beefheart.com/2010/12/john-frenchs-tribute-to-don-van-vliet.html |date=December 26, 2010 }} Beefheart.com Published 2010-22-12.

''[[Doc at the Radar Station]]'' (1980) helped establish Beefheart's late resurgence. Released by [[Virgin Records]] during the [[post-punk]] scene, the music was now accessible to a younger, more receptive audience. He was interviewed in a feature report on [[KABC-TV]]'s ''Channel 7 Eyewitness News'' in which he was hailed as "the father of the [[New wave music|new wave]]. One of the most important American composers of the last fifty years, [and] a primitive genius"; Van Vliet said at this period, "I'm doing a non-hypnotic music to break up the [[catatonic]] state ... and I think there is one right now."<ref>{{YouTube|yIlVXzC85TU|Van Vliet interviewed on KABC-TV's ''Channel 7 Eyewitness News''}} 1980.

Richard Redus and Art Tripp departed on this album, with slide guitar and marimba duties taken up by the reappearance of John French. The guitar skills of [[Gary Lucas]] also feature on the track ''Flavor Bud Living''.

====''Ice Cream for Crow''====

The final Beefheart record, ''[[Ice Cream for Crow]]'' (1982), was recorded with [[Gary Lucas]] (who was also Van Vliet's manager), [[Moris Tepper|Jeff Moris Tepper]], Richard Snyder and [[Cliff Martinez]]. This line-up made a video to promote the title track, directed by Van Vliet and Ken Schreiber, with cinematography by [[Daniel Pearl (cinematographer)|Daniel Pearl]], which was rejected by MTV for being "too weird". However, the video was included in the Letterman broadcast on NBC-TV, and was also accepted into the Museum of Modern Art.<ref>Darrin, Fox.

====''Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh''====
Released in 2004 by [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Handmade]] in a limited edition of 1,500 copies,<ref name="discogs.com"/> this signed and numbered box set contains a "Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh" CD of Vliet-recited poetry, the [[Anton Corbijn]] film of Vliet ''Some YoYo Stuff'' on DVD and two art books. One book, entitled ''Splinters'', gives a visual "scrapbook" insight into Vliet's life, from an early age to his painting in retirement. The second, eponymously titled, book is packed with art pages of Vliet's work. The first is bound in green linen, the second in yellow. These colors are counterpointed throughout the package, which comes in a green slipcase measuring 235&nbsp;mm × 325&nbsp;mm × 70&nbsp;mm. An onion-skin wallet, nestling at the package's inner sanctum, contains a matching-numbered Vliet lithograph on hand-rolled paper, signed by the artist. The two books are by publishers Artist Ink Editions.

According to Dr. John Lane, director of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], in 1997, although Van Vliet's work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting "has that same kind of edge the music has".  Curator David Breuer asserts that in contrast to the busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is a distinctly [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]] one, making him a distinguished figure in contemporary art, whose work will survive in canon.<ref name="artist formerly known" /> Van Vliet stated of his own work, "I'm trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas.

===Life in retirement===

After his retirement from music, Van Vliet rarely appeared in public. He resided near [[Trinidad, California]], with his wife Janet "Jan" Van Vliet.<ref name=ft>Anthony Haden-Guest (July 28, 2007).

One of Van Vliet's last public appearances was in the 1993 short documentary ''Some Yo Yo Stuff'' by filmmaker [[Anton Corbijn]], described as an "observation of his observations". Around 13 minutes and shot entirely in black and white, with appearances by his mother and [[David Lynch]], the film showed a noticeably weakened and [[dysarthria|dysarthric]] Van Vliet at his residence in California, reading poetry, and philosophically discussing his life, environment, music and art.<ref name="Ubu.clc.wvu.edu"/> In 2000, he appeared on Gary Lucas's album ''Improve the Shining Hour'' and Moris Tepper's ''Moth to Mouth'', and spoke on Tepper's 2004 song "Ricochet Man" from the album ''Head Off''.

Van Vliet often voiced concern over and support for environmentalist issues and causes, particularly the welfare of animals. He often referred to Earth as "God's Golfball" and this expression can be found on a number of his later albums. In 2003 he was heard on the compilation album ''Where We Live: Stand for What You Stand On: A Benefit CD for [[Earthjustice|EarthJustice]]'' singing a version of "[[Happy Birthday to You]]" retitled "Happy Earthday". The track lasts 34 seconds and was recorded over the telephone.<ref>[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/window/media/page/0,,2671758-5419554,00.html Where We Live: Happy Earthday] ''artistdirect.com''.

Their efforts were unsuccessful, as "Beefheart's Howlin' Wolf vocal style and Zappa's distorted guitar" were "not on the agenda" at the time.<ref name="Taylor"/>

The friendship between Zappa and Van Vliet over the years was sometimes expressed in the form of rivalry as musicians drifted back and forth between their groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|2004}}</ref> Van Vliet embarked on the 1975 ''[[Bongo Fury]]'' tour with Zappa and [[The Mothers of Invention|the Mothers]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Zappa-Beefheart-Mothers-Bongo-Fury/master/35842 |title=''Bongo Fury'' for Mothers link |work=Discogs.com |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref> mainly because conflicting contractual obligations made him unable to tour or record independently. Their relationship grew acrimonious on the tour to the point that they refused to talk to one another. Zappa became irritated by Van Vliet, who drew constantly, including while on stage, filling one of his large sketch books with rapidly executed portraits and warped caricatures of Zappa. Musically, Van Vliet's primitive style contrasted sharply with Zappa's compositional discipline and abundant technique. Mothers of Invention drummer [[Jimmy Carl Black]] described the situation as "two geniuses" on "ego trips".<ref name="artist formerly known"/> Estranged for years afterwards, they reconnected at the end of Zappa's life, after his diagnosis with terminal [[prostate cancer]].<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|2004|p=372}}</ref> Their collaborative work appears on the Zappa rarity collections ''[[The Lost Episodes]]'' (1996) and ''[[Mystery Disc]]'' (1996). Particularly notable is their song "[[Muffin Man (song)|Muffin Man]]", included on the Zappa/Beefheart ''Bongo Fury'' album, as well as Zappa's compilation album ''[[Strictly Commercial]]'' (1995). Zappa finished concerts with the song for many years afterwards. Beefheart also provided vocals for "[[Willie the Pimp]]" on Zappa's otherwise instrumental album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' (1969). One track on ''Trout Mask Replica'', "The Blimp (mousetrapreplica)", features Magic Band guitarist Jeff Cotton talking on the telephone to Zappa superimposed onto an unrelated live recording of the Mothers of Invention (the backing track was later released in 1992 as "Charles Ives" on ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5]]'' ).<ref>Zappa, Frank.

==Influence==
Van Vliet has been the subject of at least two [[television documentary|documentaries]], the [[BBC]]'s 1997 ''The Artist Formerly Known as Captain Beefheart'' narrated by [[John Peel]], and the 2006 independent production ''Captain Beefheart: Under Review''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.101distribution.com/artist/?id=4488 |title=101 Distribution – ''Captain Beefheart: Under Review'' |work=101distribution.com |date=March 30, 2009 |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref>

According to Peel, "If there has ever been such a thing as a genius in the history of popular music, it's Beefheart&nbsp;... I heard echoes of his music in some of the records I listened to last week and I'll hear more echoes in records that I listen to this week."<ref name="Peel"/> His narration added: "A psychedelic shaman who frequently bullied his musicians and sometimes alarmed his fans, Don somehow remained one of rock's great innocents."<ref name="artist formerly known"/> Mike Barnes referred to him as an "iconic counterculture hero" who, with the Magic Band, "went on to stake out startling new possibilities for rock music".<ref name="Barnes, Mike 2000"/> [[Lester Bangs]] cited Beefheart as "one of the four or five unqualified geniuses to rise from the hothouses of American music in the Sixties",<ref name="bangs">Bangs, Lester (April 1, 1971).

[[PJ Harvey]] and [[John Parish]] discussed Beefheart's influence in an interview together. Harvey's first experience of Beefheart's music was as a child. Her parents had all of his albums; listening to them made her "feel ill". Harvey was reintroduced to Beefheart's music by Parish, who lent her a cassette copy of ''Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)'' at the age of 16. She cited him as one of her greatest influences since. Parish described Beefheart's music as a "combination of raw blues and abstract jazz. There was humour in there, but you could tell that it wasn't [intended as] a joke. I felt that there was a depth to what he did that very few other rock artists have managed [to achieve]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mog.com/mogtv/pj_harvey_john_parish_1 |title=MOGTv: PJ Harvey & John Parish on Neil Young, Captain Beefheart |work=Mog.com |access-date=February 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606233958/http://mog.com/mogtv/pj_harvey_john_parish_1 |archive-date=June 6, 2009 }}</ref> [[Ty Segall]] covered "Drop Out Boogie" on his 2009 album ''Lemons''.
