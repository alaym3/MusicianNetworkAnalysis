After the release of ''[[MTV1987]],'' Abstract began working on the music video for the song "Hell/Heroina," using more than $3,000 accrued from fans through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kevin Abstract – Hell / Heroina Music Video |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kevinabstract/kevin-abstract-hell-heroina-music-video |website=Kickstarter |access-date=2015-08-31}}</ref> The crowdfunded project was directed by Tyler Mitchell and finally released on November 4, 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Premiere: Watch Kevin Abstract's "Hell/Heroina" Video |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/11/kevin-abstract-hell-heroina-video |access-date=2015-09-02}}</ref> Abstract also did a 24-hour live stream on November 1,<ref>{{Cite tweet |title=http://KEVINABSTRACT.COM 24 HOUR STREAM OF MY DESKTOP.

As of November 2018, it has been removed from most major download and streaming services.

=== 2015: ''Death of a Supermodel'' and ''NOWIFIII'' ===
On January 15, 2015, Abstract informed fans via his Twitter page that his second record was to be titled ''Death of a Supermodel'' and that it would be released later in the year.<ref>{{Cite tweet |title=the name of the 2nd album is death of a supermodel |user=kevinabstract |last=Abstract |first=Kevin |number=555917769489661953 |date=January 15, 2015 |access-date=2015-09-02}}</ref> However, this album was later discarded. Abstract has announced that he is now working on a different album, ''They Shoot Horses,'' a part of the Death of a Supermodel trilogy.

On May 30, Abstract and other BROCKHAMPTON members, bearface., Romil Hemnani & Henock Sileshi released a side project EP titled "MEMORIAL DAY" under new personas and the "NOWIFIII" name due to the 2015 Texas floods making them lose their Wi-Fi.

On June 23, Abstract released a video for "Save", directed by Ian Gilner, Henock Sileshi, & Franklin Mendez.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Watch the Premiere of Kevin Abstract's Unsettling "Save" Video |url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2015/06/watch-the-premiere-of-kevin-abstracts-unsettling-save-video/ |access-date=2015-09-01}}</ref> In November, the first single from ''They Shoot Horses'', "Echo" was released, along with a music video directed by Tyler Mitchell.

=== 2016–2017: ''American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story'' and Viceland ===
{{main|American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story}}
In March 2016, Abstract joined alternative band [[The Neighbourhood]] on a week-long tour through England, opening up shows in Portsmouth, Birmingham, Manchester, and London. The final show of the tour was live streamed via the Periscope app, in which he also teased his new album ''They Shoot Horses'', expected to be released in 2016. He also provided confirmation that his next single would be called ''Empty''.

In April, Abstract announced that he would be going on tour with The Neighbourhood again, but this time in the USA, during May and June. Abstract exclusively performed new songs from his upcoming album.

At the end of June, Abstract announced that he had changed the title of his upcoming album to ''[[American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story]]'' and reassured fans that it would still be coming later that year.

Abstract, along with fellow members of [[Brockhampton (band)|Brockhampton]], appeared in the [[Viceland]] television series ''American Boyband'', which premiered on June 8, 2017. The series followed Abstract on his first headlining tour across North America, while also capturing moments of other [[Brockhampton (band)|Brockhampton]] members still at home in South Central, Los Angeles.

Abstract is currently managed by longtime manager & business partner Anish Ochani and Christian & Kelly Clancy of 4 Strikes.

On March 30, Brockhampton released their first collective mixtape: ''[[All-American Trash]]''. On April 22, they also released a documentary showcasing the making of the project.

In 2017, Brockhampton released two albums (''[[Saturation (Brockhampton album)|Saturation]]'' and ''[[Saturation II]]'') in the summer of 2017, both to widespread critical acclaim. Three days before the release of Saturation II, Abstract announced via Twitter that a third album titled ''[[Saturation III]]'' would also be released, marking Brockhampton's third full studio album of the calendar year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/brockhampton-announces-saturation-3-releases-first-single-news.36588.html|title=Brockhampton Announces 'Saturation 3'; Releases First Single|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2017-09-18}}</ref> ''Saturation III'' was released December 15, which also received critical acclaim. Although it was stated by the group that ''Saturation III'' would be their final studio album, Brockhampton announced that their fourth studio album, ''Team Effort'', was expected to be released in 2018. However, ''Team Effort'' was delayed indefinitely until 2018 following the group's decision to create another album, ''Puppy'', to be released in its place, only for it to be delayed following the sexual assault allegations on fellow Brockhampton member Ameer Vann.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/brockhampton-puppy-release-date/|title=Brockhampton to Delay 'PUPPY' Following Ameer Vann Abuse Allegations |last=McGarrigle|first=Lia|website=[[Highsnobiety]]|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref>

{{main|Arizona Baby}}
In June 2018, Abstract added a picture with the text "ambfII" to his Instagram story, with "ambfII" presumably standing for American Boyfriend II.

In early April, he expressed in a series of now deleted tweets that once he released as much music as he can in 2019, he would like to retire and focus on filmmaking. Throughout the following weeks, Abstract released more teasers for his upcoming third studio album, ''Arizona Baby''.
