==Early life==
David Byrne was born on 14&nbsp;May 1952 in [[Dumbarton]], [[Dunbartonshire]], [[Scotland]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dearscotland.com/2010/04/02/the-dumbarton-road-to-nowhere/ |title=The Dumbarton Road to Nowhere |last=Tam |first=Leo Nardo |quote=one of Scotland's most famous expats |access-date=21 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/4986234/David-Byrne-stay-hungry.html |title=David Byrne: stay hungry |last=Grant |first=Richard |date=16 March 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |quote=born in Dumbarton, Scotland (a point of pride, like his British passport)|access-date=21 December 2012}}</ref> the elder of two children born to Tom (from [[Lambhill|Lambhill, Glasgow]]) and Emma.

His father worked as an electronics engineer at [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. His mother later became a teacher. The family had left Scotland in part because there were few jobs requiring his father's engineering skills and in part because of the tensions in the extended family caused by his parents' "[[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]", his father being Catholic and his mother Presbyterian. Byrne recounted these events when he appeared on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 18 March 2018.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09vz6r1|title=BBC Radio 4 – Desert Island Discs, David Byrne|website=BBC|access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref>

Before high school, Byrne already knew how to play the guitar, accordion, and violin. He was rejected from his [[middle school]]'s choir because they claimed he was "off-[[Key (music)|key]] and too withdrawn". From a young age, he had a strong interest in music. His parents say that he would constantly play his [[phonograph]] from age three and he learned how to play the harmonica at age five.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C962640-8%2C00.html |title=Rock's Renaissance Man |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=27 October 1986 |access-date=5 September 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115153738/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C962640-8%2C00.html |archive-date=15 January 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> As an older adult, he realised he likely had [[Asperger syndrome]], stating that music was his way of communicating when he felt he could not do it face to face.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p00yq6c6'' I identify with Susan Boyle'' – Referencing Bryne's 2012 book How Music Works.

==Career==
===Early career: 1971–1974===
[[File:David Byrne of Talking Heads.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Byrne playing guitar with [[Talking Heads]], 1978]]
Byrne graduated from [[Lansdowne High School]] in southwest [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]]. He started his musical career in a high school band called Revelation, then between 1971 and 1972, he was one half of a duo named Bizadi with Marc Kehoe. Their repertoire consisted mostly of songs such as "[[April Showers (song)|April Showers]]", "[[96 Tears]]", "[[Dancing on the Ceiling (1930 song)|Dancing on the Ceiling]]" and [[Frank Sinatra]] songs. Byrne attended the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (during the 1970–71 term) and the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] (during the 1971–72 term) before dropping out. He returned to Providence in 1973 and formed a band called the Artistics with fellow RISD student [[Chris Frantz]].<ref>Gittins, Ian, ''Talking Heads: Once in a Lifetime : the Stories Behind Every Song'', [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2004, p. 140 {{ISBN|0-634-08033-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08033-3}}.</ref> The band dissolved in 1974. Byrne moved to [[New York City]] in May that year, and in September of that year, Frantz and his girlfriend [[Tina Weymouth]] followed suit. Unable to find a bass player in New York, Frantz and Byrne persuaded Weymouth to learn to play the bass guitar. Byrne gave her lessons.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} While working day jobs in late 1974, they were contemplating a band.

===Talking Heads: 1975–1991===
{{Main|Talking Heads}}

By January 1975, they were practicing and playing together, while still working normal day jobs. They founded the band [[Talking Heads]] and had their first gig in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/article/tina-weymouth/mar-97/5958|title=Tina Talks Heads, Tom Toms, and How to Succeed at Bass Without Really Trying|last=Isola|first=Gregory|date=March 1997|work=[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]|access-date=15 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210190543/http://bassplayer.com/article/tina-weymouth/mar-97/5958 <!-- article has disappeared, replaced by "Roland GR-55 Guitar Synthesizer" By Gino Robair Fri, 21 Oct 2011 as at 15 May 2013-->|archive-date=10 February 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/talking-heads/bio Talking Heads] ''[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]''. Retrieved 15 May 2013</ref> Byrne quit his day job in May 1976 and the three-piece band signed to [[Sire Records]] in November. Byrne was the youngest member of the band. Multi-instrumentalist [[Jerry Harrison]] joined the band in 1977. The band released eight studio albums before going into hiatus in 1988. Byrne desired to go solo, but it took three years until 1991 to announce that the band was breaking up. The band had a brief reunion for the single "[[Sax and Violins]]" in 1991 before dissolving again. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2002, where they reunited to play four tracks, including "[[Psycho Killer]]" and "[[Burning Down the House]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/ceremonies/2002/|title=2002 Induction Ceremony|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|access-date=15 May 2013}}</ref>

===Solo album career: 1979–1981, 1989–present===
During his time in the band, David Byrne took on outside projects, collaborating with [[Brian Eno]] during 1979 and 1981 on the album ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'', which attracted considerable critical acclaim due to its early use of analogue [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[Found object|found sounds]]. Following this record, Byrne focused his attention on Talking Heads. ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' was re-released for its 25th anniversary in early 2006, with new bonus tracks. In keeping with the spirit of the original album, [[stem (audio)|stems]] for two of the songs' component tracks were released under [[Creative Commons]] licenses and a [[remix]] contest website was launched.

''[[Rei Momo]]'' (1989) was the first solo album by Byrne after leaving Talking Heads, and features mainly Afro-Cuban, Afro-Hispanic, and Brazilian song styles, including popular dances such as [[merengue music|merengue]], [[son cubano]], [[samba]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[cumbia]], [[Cha-cha-chá (music)|cha-cha-chá]], [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] and [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]]. His third solo album, ''[[Uh-Oh (David Byrne album)|Uh-Oh]]'' (1992), featured a brass section and was driven by tracks such as "Girls on My Mind" and "The Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)". His fourth solo album, titled ''[[David Byrne (album)|David Byrne]]'' (1994), was a more proper rock record, with Byrne playing most of the instruments on it, leaving percussion for session musicians. "Angels" and "Back in the Box" were the two main singles released from the album. The first one entered the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, reaching No. 24. For his fifth studio effort the emotional ''[[Feelings (David Byrne album)|Feelings]]'' (1997), Byrne employed a brass orchestra called Black Cat Orchestra. His sixth ''[[Look into the Eyeball]]'' (2001) continued the same musical exploration of ''Feelings'', but was compiled of more upbeat tracks, like those found on ''Uh-Oh''.

''[[Grown Backwards]]'' (2004), released by [[Nonesuch Records]], used orchestral string arrangements, and includes two operatic [[aria]]s as well as a rework of [[X-Press 2]] collaboration "[[#Other musical contributions: 1990–present|Lazy]]". He also launched a North American and Australian tour with the Tosca Strings. This tour ended with [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]] and New York shows in August 2005. He  also collaborated with [[Selena]] on her 1995 album ''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' with "God's Child (Baila Conmigo)".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/composition/7ab34001-d0f7-416f-9914-17a9f4e16f6a-Gods-Child-Baila-Conmigo|title=God's Child (Baila Conmigo)|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>

[[File:DavidByrneFestivalHall2009.jpg|thumb|right|Byrne at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]], 2009]]
Byrne and Eno reunited for his eighth album ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]'' (2008).<ref name="tour">{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingthathappens.com/tour.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822132005/http://www.everythingthathappens.com/tour.html |archive-date=22 August 2008 |title=Tour Dates for David Byrne – Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno |publisher=David Byrne |date=4 August 2008 |access-date=11 January 2010 }}</ref> He assembled a band to tour worldwide for the album for a six-month period from late 2008 through early 2009 on the [[Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |title=DavidByrne.com – Tours |url=http://www.davidbyrne.com/tours/index.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316041327/http://www.davidbyrne.com/tours/index.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 March 2009 |date=16 March 2009}}</ref>

In 2012 he released a collaborative album with American singer-songwriter [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]] called ''[[Love This Giant]]''.

In January 2018, Byrne announced his first solo album in 14 years. ''[[American Utopia]]'' was released in March through Todo Mundo and Nonesuch Records. He also released the album's first single, "Everybody's Coming to My House", which he co-wrote with Eno.<ref name="ns">{{cite web |url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/david-byrne-american-utopia-due-march-9-nonesuch-records-announced-2017-01-08 |title= David Byrne's New Album, ''American Utopia'', Due March 9 on Todomundo / Nonesuch Records |publisher=[[Nonesuch Records]] |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> The subsequent tour – which showcased songs from ''American Utopia'' alongside highlights from his Talking Heads and solo career to date – was described by [[NME]] as being perhaps "the most ambitious and impressive live show of all time", blurring the lines "between gig and theatre, poetry and dance".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/david-byrnes-american-utopia-tour-might-ambitious-impressive-live-show-time |title= David Byrne's American Utopia tour might be the most ambitious and impressive live show of all time |publisher=[[NME]] |date=15 June 2018}}</ref>

===Work in theatre, film, and television: 1981–present===
In 1981, Byrne partnered with choreographer [[Twyla Tharp]], [[film score|scoring]] music he wrote that appeared on his album ''[[The Catherine Wheel (album)|The Catherine Wheel]]'' for a ballet with the same name, prominently featuring unusual rhythms and lyrics. Productions of ''The Catherine Wheel'' appeared on Broadway that same year.

He was chiefly responsible for the stage design and choreography of the concert film ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' (1984).

Byrne wrote the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]]-inspired score ''[[Music for "The Knee Plays"]]'', released in 1985, for [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]'s vast five-act opera ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down]]''.

He wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[True Stories (film)|True Stories]]'' (1986), a musical collage of discordant [[Americana (music)|Americana]], as well as produced most of the film's music. He was impressed by the experimental theatre that he saw in New York City in the 1970s and collaborated with several of its best-known representatives. He worked with Robert Wilson on "The Knee Plays" and "The Forest", and invited [[Spalding Gray]] (of The Wooster Group) to act in ''True Stories'', while Meredith Monk provided a small part of that film's soundtrack. The musician provided a soundtrack for JoAnne Akalaitis' film ''Dead End Kids'' (1986), made after a Mabou Mines theatre production. Byrne's artistic outlook has a great deal in common with the work of these artists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steenstra|first1=Sytze|title=Song and Circumstance|date=2010|publisher=Continuum Books|isbn=978-08264-4168-3|location=New York and London|pages=93–137}}</ref> The same year he also added "Loco de Amor" with [[Celia Cruz]] to [[Jonathan Demme]]'s film ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' (1986).

His work has been extensively used in film [[soundtrack]]s, most notably in collaboration with [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Cong Su]] on [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (1987), which won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].

Some of the music from Byrne's orchestral album ''[[The Forest (album)|The Forest]]'' was originally used in a Robert Wilson-directed theatre piece with the same name. The play ''The Forest'' premiered at the ''Theater der Freien Volksbühne'', Berlin, in 1988. It received its New York premiere in December 1988 at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM). The Forestry Maxi-single contained dance and industrial remixes of pieces from ''The Forest'' by [[Jack Dangers]], Rudy Tambala, and Anthony Capel. Byrne released his soundtrack album in 1991.

Byrne also directed the documentary ''Île Aiye'' (1989) and the concert film of his 1992 Latin-tinged tour titled ''Between the Teeth'' (1994).

''[[In Spite of Wishing and Wanting]]'' is a soundscape Byrne produced in 1999 for Belgian choreographer [[Wim Vandekeybus]]'s dance company Ultima Vez.

In 2003, Byrne guest starred as himself on [[Dude, Where's My Ranch?|a season 14 episode]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Released the same year, ''[[Lead Us Not into Temptation]]'' included tracks and musical experiments from his score to film ''[[Young Adam (film)|Young Adam]]'' (2003).

In late 2005, Byrne and [[Norman Cook|Fatboy Slim]] began work on ''[[Here Lies Love]]'', a [[disco]] opera or [[song cycle]] about the life of [[Imelda Marcos]], the controversial former First Lady of the [[Philippines]]. Some music from this piece was debuted at [[Adelaide Festival|Adelaide Festival of Arts]] in Australia in February 2006 and the following year at [[Carnegie Hall]] on 3 February 2007.

In 2008, Byrne released ''[[Big Love: Hymnal]]'' – his soundtrack to season two of ''[[Big Love]]'', which aired in 2007. These two albums constituted the first releases on his independent record label Todo Mundo. Byrne and Brian Eno provided the soundtrack for the film ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film.com/movies/review-wall-street-money-never-sleeps#fbid=KdR0UiwBhKE |title=Review: Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps |first=Laremy |last=Legel |date=23 September 2010 |website=Film.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726014726/http://www.film.com/movies/review-wall-street-money-never-sleeps#fbid=KdR0UiwBhKE |archive-date=26 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2015, he organized ''Contemporary Color'', two arena concerts in Brooklyn and Toronto, for which he brought in ten musical acts who teamed up with ten [[color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]] groups. The concerts were made into a [[Contemporary Color (film)|2016 documentary film]], directed by Bill and Turner Ross, and produced by Byrne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporarycolor.com/about/|title=About|website=Contemporary Color|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>
