Gaye took the group on the road with him as one of his opening acts, and in 1976, he suggested that they change their name from Raw Soul.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Maze released 9 [[RIAA Certification|Gold]] albums from 1977 to 1993.<ref name="riaa" />  Their well-known songs include "Happy Feelin's", "While I'm Alone", "Golden Time of Day", “Southern Girl”, "The Look in Your Eyes", "Joy and Pain", "[[Before I Let Go]]", "We Are One", "[[Back in Stride]]", "[[Can't Get Over You]]" and "The Morning After".<ref name="VF">{{cite web|title=Maze featuring Frankie Beverly Top Songs / Chart Singles Discography|url=https://www.musicvf.com/Maze+featuring+Frankie+Beverly.art|website=Music VF|access-date=11 November 2021}}</ref> The band has maintained a large and devoted following.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

==Career==
[[Frankie Beverly]] started the band as Raw Soul in 1970.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=813}}</ref> They recorded a couple of [[single (music)|singles]] on the small Gregar [[record label|label]], but without any major [[hit record|hits]]. With a few personnel changes, a relocation from Philadelphia to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in California in 1971, and an introduction to [[Marvin Gaye]], the band became an immediate success.<ref name="Larkin"/> Gaye took the band on the road with him as one of his [[curtain-raiser|curtain-raising]] acts, and in 1976, he suggested that they change their name from Raw Soul to Maze.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Maze signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Capitol Records]] in 1976, and released their debut album, [[Maze featuring Frankie Beverly (album)|''Maze featuring Frankie Beverly'']], in 1977.<ref name="Larkin"/>  From that album, the hit singles included "Happy Feelin's", "While I'm Alone", and "Lady of Magic", ultimately giving them their first [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] and earning Maze a devoted following. They also had success with the albums ''Golden Time of Day'' (1978), ''Inspiration'' (1979) and ''Joy and Pain'' (1980). The group has stated that their hit single “Southern Girl” was dedicated to all the southern women from Virginia to Texas.<ref name="SoulTracks">{{cite web|url=http://www.soultracks.com/maze.htm|title=Maze featuring Frankie Beverly - Biography|website=Soul Tracks|access-date=December 17, 2012|first=Chris|last=Rizik}}</ref>

Their next [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] was ''Live in New Orleans,'' three quarters of which was recorded at the [[Saenger Theatre (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Saenger Theatre]], on November 14–15, 1980. Three of those songs got into the [[United States|US]] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]], including "Running Away", "[[Before I Let Go]]", and "We Need Love to Live". By that time, the band had a reputation in [[United States|America]] and enjoyed a following in the [[United Kingdom]] with promotional support from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Robbie Vincent]]. In May 1985, Maze sold out eight nights at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]].<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book|first=John|last=Tobler|year=1992|title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|edition=1st|publisher=Reed International Books Ltd|location=London|page=404|id=CN 5585}}</ref>

The band released their next album, ''Can't Stop the Love'' in March 1985,<ref name="Larkin"/> which featured the group's first number one R&B hit "Back In Stride." The [[Top 40|Top 5]] follow-up, "Too Many Games" was also featured on this album. The latter single also became the band's biggest hit in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it peaked at number 36 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="uk"/>

In 1989, they signed with Warner Bros. and released the hit album ''Silky Soul'', plus ''Back to Basics'' in 1993,<ref name="Larkin"/> and released the [[live album|live]] [[DVD]] recording at [[London]]'s [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in 1994. The two albums also attained gold disc status. They had another number one R&B success with "Can't Get Over You".

In 2009, a tribute to the hits of Maze was released. Called ''Silky Soul Music: An All Star Tribute to Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly,'' it included modern stars performing Maze's biggest hits with Maze acting as the backing band.<ref name="SoulTracks"/>

In recent years, it has become tradition for the audience to honor the group by dressing in all white attire, as the group has often worn while performing.

On September 2, 2011, their percussionist and background singer, McKinley "Bug" Williams, died of an apparent [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Morrison|first1=John F.|title=McKinley 'Bug' Williams, toured with R&B group|url=https://www.inquirer.com/philly/obituaries/20110909_McKinley__Bug__Williams__toured_with_R_B_group.html|access-date=11 November 2021|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=September 9, 2011 |quote=McKinley died last Friday of an apparent heart attack.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=McKinley Williams Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/ns/mckinley-williams-obituary/153490824|website=Legacy.com|access-date=11 November 2021}}</ref>

Maze continues to tour around the United States as well as [[Europe]] to this day.
