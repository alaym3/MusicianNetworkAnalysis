'''Richard Steven Valenzuela''' (May 13, 1941 – February 3, 1959), known professionally as '''Ritchie Valens''', was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. A [[rock and roll]] pioneer and a forefather of the [[Chicano rock]] movement, Valens was killed in a [[The Day the Music Died|plane crash]] eight months into his music career.<ref>{{cite news | title=Ritchie Valens - the Pioneer of Rock and Roll| url=http://www.efi-news.com/2011/12/ritchie-valens-pioneer-of-rock-and-roll.html |publisher=EF News International| date=December 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206183600/http://www.efi-news.com/2011/12/ritchie-valens-pioneer-of-rock-and-roll.html |archive-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref>

Valens had several hits, most notably "[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]", which he had adapted from a Mexican folk song. Valens transformed the song into one with a rock rhythm and beat, and it became a hit in 1958,<ref>{{cite news | last=Letivan |first=Corey |url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/rave/articles/1649567.html?showAll=y&c=y |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105021/http://www.dailybreeze.com/rave/articles/1649567.html?showAll=y&c=y |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |title=Latino rockers no longer lost in translation |newspaper=[[Daily Breeze]] |date=July 5, 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mipunto.com/temas/2do_trimestre02/rock.html |title=TEMAS &#124; Rock en Venezuela |publisher=Mipunto.com |language=es |access-date=September 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213000512/http://www.mipunto.com/temas/2do_trimestre02/rock.html |archive-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref> making Valens a pioneer of the [[rock en español|Spanish-speaking rock and roll]] movement. He also had an American number-two hit with "[[Donna (Ritchie Valens song)|Donna]]".

On February 3, 1959, on what has become known as "[[The Day the Music Died]]", Valens died in a plane crash in [[Iowa]], an accident that also claimed the lives of fellow musicians [[Buddy Holly]] and J. P. "[[The Big Bopper]]" Richardson, as well as pilot Roger Peterson. Valens was 17 at the time of his death. In 2001, Valens was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Valens was born Richard Steven Valenzuela in [[Pacoima, Los Angeles|Pacoima]], a neighborhood in the [[San Fernando Valley]] region of [[Los Angeles]]. His parents, José Esteban Valenzuela (1896–1952) and Concepción "Concha" Reyes (1915–1987), were from [[Mexico]]. He was the second of five siblings with older brother Roberto "Bob" Morales (1937–2018), younger sisters Connie and Irma, and younger brother Mario Ramirez.

Valenzuela was brought up hearing traditional Mexican [[mariachi]] music, as well as [[flamenco]] guitar,<ref>{{cite web |last1=City News Service |title=LA declares Ritchie Valens Day on 75th anniversary of his birth |url=https://www.dailynews.com/2016/05/13/la-declares-ritchie-valens-day-on-75th-anniversary-of-his-birth/ |website=Los Angeles Daily News (LDN) |date=13 May 2016 |publisher=Los Angeles Daily News (LDN) |access-date=25 November 2018}}</ref> [[R&B]], and [[jump blues]]. Valenzuela expressed an interest in making music of his own by the age of five. He was encouraged by his father to take up guitar and trumpet, and later taught himself the drums. Though Valenzuela was left-handed, he was so eager to learn the guitar that he mastered the traditional right-handed version of the instrument.

Valenzuela was a 15-year-old student at Pacoima Junior High School at the time of the [[1957 Pacoima mid-air collision]]. He was not at school that day because he was attending the funeral of his grandfather.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-jan-28-me-then28-story.html?_amp=true|author= CECILIA RASMUSSEN|title=The day fiery disaster fell from the sky|website= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 28, 2007|access-date=May 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/02/19/childhood-pal-recalls-ritchie-valens-as-sweet-tough-from-murrieta-home/ |author= Allen, David |title=Childhood pal recalls Ritchie Valens as 'sweet,' 'tough' from California home|date=February 19, 2021|access-date=May 15, 2021}}</ref> Recurring nightmares of the disaster led to Valens' [[fear of flying]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-12-29-me-1334-story.html |author= Kahler, Karl |title=On Pacoima Playground With Ritchie Valens : Grief Moves Him to Save Lives|website= [[Los Angeles Times]] |quote=One student developed an intense fear of flying after the accident--Ricardo Valenzuela, who later adopted the name Ritchie Valens.|date=Dec 29, 1988|access-date=May 15, 2021}}</ref>

By the time Valenzuela was attending Pacoima Junior High School (now [[Pacoima Middle School]]), he would bring his guitar to school and sing and play songs to his friends on the bleachers.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oracle of Del-Fi|author=Bob Keane|author-link=Bob Keane|publisher=Del-Fi International Books|date=October 6, 2006|isbn=978-0976810513}}</ref>

When he was 16 years old, he was invited to join a local band, The Silhouettes (not to be confused with the group of the same name famous for its hit song [[Get a Job (song)|"Get a Job"]]). He began as a guitarist, and when the main vocalist left the group, Valenzuela assumed the position. On October 19, 1957, he made his performing debut with The Silhouettes.

Valenzuela also attended [[San Fernando High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=San Fernando High School Alums {{!}} i am san fernando|url=http://iamsanfernando.com/san-fernando-alumni|website=iamsanfernando.com|access-date=7 February 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2015}}
A self-taught musician, Valenzuela was an accomplished singer and guitarist. At his appearances, he often improvised new lyrics and added new riffs to popular songs while he was playing.

[[Bob Keane]], the owner and president of small record label [[Del-Fi Records]] in [[Hollywood]], was given a tip in May 1958 by San Fernando High School student Doug Macchia about a young performer from Pacoima by the name of Richard Valenzuela. Kids knew the performer as "the [[Little Richard]] of [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]]". Swayed by the Little Richard comparison, Keane went to see Valenzuela play a Saturday-morning matinée at a movie theater in San Fernando. Impressed by the performance, he invited the youth to audition at his home in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] area of Los Angeles, where he had a small recording studio in his basement. His recording equipment comprised an early stereo recorder (a two-track [[Ampex]] 601-2 portable) and a pair of [[Georg Neumann GmbH|Neumann]] U-47 condenser microphones.

After this first audition, Keane signed Valenzuela to Del-Fi on May 27, 1958. At this point, the musician took the name "Ritchie" because, as Keane said, "There were a bunch of 'Richards' around at that time, and I wanted it to be different." Similarly, Keane recommended shortening his surname to "Valens" from Valenzuela to widen his appeal beyond any obvious ethnic group.<ref>"Valens, Ritchie." Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 15 Feb. 2016.</ref> Valens was ready to enter the studio with a full band backing him. The musicians included [[René Hall]], [[Carol Kaye]], and [[Earl Palmer]]. The first songs recorded at Gold Star Studios, at a single studio session one afternoon in July 1958, were [["Come On, Let's Go"]], an original, credited to Valens/Kuhn (Keane's real name), and "Framed", a [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Leiber and Stoller]] tune. Pressed and released within days of the recording session, the record was a success. Valens's next record, a double A-side, the final record to be released in his lifetime, had the song "Donna" (written about a real girlfriend Donna Ludwig<ref>{{cite news|last=McIntosh|first=Barbara|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/09/04/the-reveries-of-valens-donna/dfcd57aa-ab5d-48f2-bea5-06ebf3ab5b29/ | title=The Reveries of Valens' Donna|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 4, 1987|access-date=May 30, 2020}}</ref>) coupled with "[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]". It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/108 108]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/108}}</ref>

By the autumn of 1958, the demands of Valens' career forced him to drop out of high school. Keane booked appearances at venues across the United States and performances on television programs.

[[File:Ritchie Valens Grave.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Grave of Valens and his mother Concepcion at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]]]]
After the February 2, 1959, performance in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]] (which ended around midnight), Holly, Richardson, and Valens flew out of the [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]] airport in a small plane that Holly had chartered. Valens was on the plane because he won a coin toss with Holly's backup guitarist Tommy Allsup. Holly's bassist, [[Waylon Jennings]], voluntarily gave up his seat on the plane to [[The Big Bopper|J.P. Richardson]], who was ill with the flu.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yY-qrbtfonUC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=coin+toss+valens+allsup&source=bl&ots=y0UG7odS61&sig=R7HLFgc7gwSBOHxWZFGvD7Ztt2c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wKhrU9fAJcTZOqqRgOAB&ved=0CGAQ6AEwDjgK#v=onepage&q=coin%20toss%20valens%20allsup&f=false Lehmer, Larry. ''The Day the Music Died: The Last Tour of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens''], [[Omnibus Press]] (April 1, 2004), ch. 8.</ref> Around 12:55&nbsp;am on February 3, 1959, the three-passenger [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] departed for [[Fargo, North Dakota]], and crashed a few minutes after takeoff for reasons still unknown. The crash killed all three passengers and pilot Roger Peterson instantly upon impact. As with Holly and Richardson, Valens suffered massive and unsurvivable head injuries along with [[Blunt trauma|blunt-force trauma]] to the chest. At just 17 years old, Valens was the youngest to die in the crash.

The tragedy inspired singer [[Don McLean]] to write his 1971 hit "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]", immortalizing February 3 as "The Day the Music Died". Valens's remains were buried at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles]], California.

==Legacy==
[[File:The Day the Music Died.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Photo of the airplane crash in Iowa]]
Valens was a pioneer of [[Chicano rock]] and [[Latin rock]], and inspired many musicians of Mexican heritage. He influenced the likes of [[Los Lobos]], [[Los Lonely Boys]], and [[Carlos Santana]], as he had become nationally successful at a time when very few Latinos were in [[American rock]] and [[American pop|pop]] music. He is considered the first Latino to successfully cross over into mainstream rock.

"La Bamba" proved to be his most influential recording, not only by becoming a pop chart hit sung entirely in Spanish, but also because of its successful blending of traditional Latin American music with rock. Valens was the first to capitalize on this formula, which was later adopted by such varied artists as [[Selena]], [[Caifanes]], [[Café Tacuba]], [[Circo (band)|Circo]], [[El Gran Silencio]], [[Aterciopelados]], [[Gustavo Santaolalla]], and many others in the [[Latin alternative]] scene. Ironically, the Valenzuela family spoke only English at home, and he knew very little Spanish.{{Disputed inline|date=September 2021}} Valens [[phonetical singing|learned the lyrics phonetically]] to record "La Bamba" in Spanish. In 2019, the Valens version of "La Bamba" was selected by the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] as "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant".<ref>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Travis M. |date=March 20, 2019 |title=Jay-Z, a speech by Sen.

"Come On, Let's Go" has been recorded by Los Lobos, the [[Ramones]] and the [[the Paley Brothers|Paley Brothers]] (the Ramones on guitar, bass, and drums and the Paley Brothers on vocals), [[Tommy Steele]], the [[the Huntingtons|Huntingtons]], [[Girl in a Coma]], and the [[the McCoys|McCoys]]. Johnny Rebb and his Rebels recorded the song for Leedon/Canetoad Records in Australia. "Donna" has been recorded by artists as diverse as [[MxPx]], [[Marty Wilde]], the [[the Youngbloods|Youngbloods]], [[Clem Snide]], [[Cappadonna]], and [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]].

[[Robert Quine]] has cited Valens' guitar playing as an early influence on his style. Valens also inspired [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Chan Romero]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Chris Montez]], and [[Keith O'Conner Murphy]], among others.

Valens' mother, Concha, who died in 1987, is buried alongside him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Scott |title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons |date=2016 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476625997 |page=766 |edition=3rd}}</ref>

In 1989, Ken Paquette, a [[Wisconsin]] fan of the 1950s era, erected a stainless-steel monument depicting a guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers killed in the accident. It is located on private farmland, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km|adj=on}} west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, about {{convert|8|mi|0}} north of Clear Lake. He also created a similar stainless-steel monument to the three musicians that was installed near the Riverside Ballroom in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. That memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jordan |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.articlestree.com/music/the-day-the-music-died-tx390707.html |title=The Day the Music Died |date=April 11, 2007 |publisher=ArticlesTree |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120207001836/http://www.articlestree.com/music/the-day-the-music-died-tx390707.html |archive-date=February 7, 2012}}</ref>

Paxton Park in Pacoima was renamed in memory of Valens in the 1990s. A city council member representing Pacoima proposed the renaming to honor Valens so residents would "remember his humble background and emulate his accomplishments."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.laparks.org/dos/parks/facility/ritchieValensPk.htm |title=Ritchie Valens Park |publisher=City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation & Parks |access-date=September 12, 2013}}</ref>

Musician Tommy Allsup started a club, "Tommy's Heads Up Saloon", in [[Dallas]] in 1979. The club was named for the fateful coin toss between Valens and him [[The Day the Music Died|twenty years prior]].<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yY-qrbtfonUC&q=Tommy+Allsup&pg=PA201| title=The Day the Music Died: The Last Tour of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens| author=Larry Lehmer| publisher=Music Sales Group| year= 2004| isbn= 978-0-8256-7287-3}}</ref>

"Boogie with Stu" from [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' album was inspired by Valens' song "Ooh, My Head". It did not credit Valens or [[Bob Keane]], instead crediting Valens' mother. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed by Keane, and half of the award went to Valens' mother, although she was not part of the suit.<ref>Lehmer, Larry. ''The Day the Music Died: The Last Tour of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens'' (2004): 166.</ref>

On May 11, 1990, a star bearing his name was unveiled on the Hollywood walk of fame. The star cost $3,500, which was paid for with money raised in his name by family and friends. His star permanently resides at 6733 Hollywood Boulevard in front of Artisan's Patio mini mall.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-05-17-9002090771-story.html|title=Ritchie Valens Finally Gets His Star|author=Starr Spencer|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|year=1990}}</ref>

On February 2, 2009, Surf Ballroom held a 50th anniversary honoring the last concert of Buddy Holly, J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson, and Valens. The event lasted one week and had performances that honored the memories of the three men. Family members and friends of the stars made appearances.

Many murals have been painted around Pacoima in honor of the late Valens.
In 1985, artist Manuel Velasquez (assisted by 25 students) created a 12- by 20-ft (3.6- by 6.1 meters) mural, which was painted on the side of a classroom building at the former Pacoima Junior High (now Pacoima Middle School) depicting Valens's image, records labeled with some of his greatest hits, and the newspaper article about the plane crash that took his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muralconservancy.org/murals/richie-valens|title=Richie Valens – Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles|website=Muralconservancy.org|access-date=26 October 2017}}</ref>
Another mural went up in 2012 at the intersection of Van Nuys Boulevard and Amboy Avenue, which was painted by Hector Ponce. A second one was painted in 2012 by Levi Ponce and is located on Van Nuys Boulevard and Telfair Avenue. A monument has also been built as a tribute. It was put on display in 2013, and is located at Ritchie Valens Park at 10731 Laurel Canyon Boulevard.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailynews.com/2018/08/06/pacoima-is-ready-to-celebrate-the-ritchie-valens-memorial-highway-in-one-more-reminder-of-the-late-chicano-rockers-legacy/|title=Pacoima is ready to celebrate The Ritchie Valens Memorial Highway in one more reminder of the late Chicano rocker's legacy|author=Dalia Espinosa|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|year=2018}}</ref>

A section of the Interstate 5 Freeway in the northeast San Fernando Valley has been named after Valens. The Ritchie Valens Memorial Highway is located between the 170 and 118 freeways.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-section-of-i-5-in-san-fernando-valley-1504219079-htmlstory.html|title=Ritchie Valens, late rock star and local hero, gets a stretch of the 5 Freeway in the Valley named after him|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Patrick McGreevy}}</ref> On August 25, 2018, a celebration was held in his honor to commemorate his legacy.
