He moved to popular art music, breaking free from traditional song structure, inventing his own dramatic and innovative musical territory. He is noticeably seen topless and barefoot onstage, dressed entirely in black or dark grey, with a long, wool [[trench coat]].

==Early life==
The youngest of five children, Benjamin Clementine grew up in a middle-class family in Edmonton, London, with his strict Roman Catholic grandmother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/27/benjamin-clementine-musician-interview-i-make-people-believe-in-me|title=Benjamin Clementine: ‘I make people believe in me’|date=27 August 2017|website=the Guardian}}</ref> After she died, he moved in with his parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/novodoby-jimi-hendrix-benjamin-clementine-posila-kondolenci-vlastnimu-strachu-g0n-/kultura.aspx?c=A150311_115506_ln_kultura_hep |title=Nový Hendrix.

Joseph bought a piano when Clementine was 11, and when he had finished his daily practice Benjamin would play it. Eventually his brother's acquired taste for the piano diminished and he moved on to another instrument giving Clementine more time to continue playing. He had discovered such a strong propensity to music that his father, who always intended for him to study law, had reason to be alarmed. He strictly forbade him to meddle with any musical instrument but Clementine found means to get a little keyboard privately conveyed to a room at the top of the house {{Citation needed|reason=This is copied almost verbatim from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel|date=July 2021}}where he played when his parents went to work. Clementine could not read music, but in a few months he started imitating the work of fin-de-siècle composer [[Erik Satie]] and [[Claude Debussy]], learned from listening to [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]] after "becoming bored" with pop music, and continued to play discreetly for the next five years until his parents' divorce.<ref name="standard.co.uk"/><ref name="theguardian.com"/><ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/new-music/10557979/Benjamin-Clementine-New-Music.html |title=Benjamin Clementine - New Music |newspaper=Telegraph |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="npr.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/05/03/403584089/benjamin-clementine-trades-sleeping-on-the-floor-for-sleeping-in-a-palace |title=Benjamin Clementine Trades 'Sleeping on the Floor' For 'Sleeping in a Palace' |publisher=NPR |date=3 May 2015 |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref>

===Relocation to Paris===
Clementine left school at 16 after failing most of his GCSEs, passing only English literature, following which he had a dispute with his family and ended up in [[Camden Town|Camden Town, London]], homeless and in psychological and financial difficulties. Although it was not a premeditated plan,<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> he relocated to [[Paris]] at age 19, where he spent a number of years busking and playing in bars and hotels in [[Place de Clichy]] while sleeping on the streets. Occasionally, he applied for jobs cleaning kitchens but was never successful. He eventually moved to a hostel in [[Montmartre]], where he paid [[Euro|€]]20 to live in a ten-man bunk-bed room. He preferred to sleep in the lower beds to enable him to hide his belongings underneath.<ref name="theguardian.com"/><ref name=lemonde2>{{cite news|last1=Davet|first1=Stéphane|title=Benjamin Clementine, par la voix du " Je "|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/festival/article/2014/07/17/benjamin-clementine-par-la-voix-du-je_4458889_4415198.html?xtmc=benjamin_clementine&xtcr=2|access-date=6 August 2014|work=Le Monde|date=17 July 2014|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Allen |first=Jeremy |url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/benjamin-clementine-an-interview-in-paris |title=Benjamin Clementine Was Homeless on the Streets of Paris, Now He Sells Out its Biggest Venues {{pipe}} NOISEY |website=Noisey.vice.com |date=31 March 2015 |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> Clementine eventually bought a half-broken guitar and a cheap keyboard.  For the next three years he wrote and composed songs.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> Clementine managed to stay out of trouble as he spent his nights performing and his days composing and writing, becoming a cult figure in the Parisian music scene.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> After four years of living as a vagabond, he was discovered by an agent whilst walking back home from an evening performance and they arranged a meeting for the next day. The agent introduced him to a friend, Matthieu Gazier, later on becoming Clementine's manager for a period of time. In 2012, whilst playing a gig at the [[Festival de Cannes]] they met Lionel Bensemoun, a business mogul in France. Through him, they decided to set up the record label 'Behind' so that Clementine could record his music.<ref name=lemonde2/><ref name="varsity">{{cite journal|url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/reviews/6341|title=EP: Cornerstone, Benjamin Clementine|journal=Cambridge Varsity|first=Becky|last=Rosenberg|date=28 October 2013|access-date=29 December 2013}}</ref> He eventually came to the attention of the French press, who described him as "''{{lang|fr|la révélation anglaise des Francos}}''" ("the English revelation of the [[Les Francofolies de La Rochelle|"Francofolies" festival"]]).<ref name="standard.co.uk"/> He was then invited to the [[Rencontres Trans Musicales|Rencontres Trans Musicales of Rennes]] in France in December 2012 where he performed for the first time on a large stage and played four nights consecutively. Clementine eventually signed a joint music license contract between [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], [[Virgin EMI]] and [[Barclay Records|Barclay]].<ref name="npr.org"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wnku.org/post/benjamin-clementine-trades-sleeping-floor-sleeping-palace |title=Benjamin Clementine Trades 'Sleeping on the Floor' For 'Sleeping in a Palace' |publisher=WNKU |access-date=13 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722080334/http://wnku.org/post/benjamin-clementine-trades-sleeping-floor-sleeping-palace |archive-date=22 July 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Difficulties===
Before Clementine signed a major deal he closely met and worked with a French tour agent with his independent label in Paris and embarked on a brief European tour playing in high-profile festivals as the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], the [[Montreal Jazz Festival]] in Canada; and [[Eurosonic Festival]], of which Rob Van Der Zwaan writing for podium.info described him as one of the highlights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up-archive/act/benjamin-clementine/ |title=Benjamin Clementine - Eurosonic Noorderslag |website=Eurosonic-noorderslag.nl |access-date=13 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617164403/http://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/festival/line-up-archive/act/benjamin-clementine/ |archive-date=17 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.podiuminfo.nl/review/3171/Benjamin_Clementine_-_154_-_MC_Theater/ |title=Benjamin Clementine - 15/4 - MC Theater - concert review / fotoverslag op Podiuminfo |website=Podiuminfo.nl |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Valentinetti |first=Vito |url=http://www.musicfestivaljunkies.com/50-acts-added-eurosonic-noorderslag-2014/ |title=50 More Acts Added to Eurosonic Noorderslag 2014 |publisher=Music Festival Junkies |date=13 November 2013 |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/76550 |title=NME News Stevie Wonder and Damon Albarn to play 2014 Montreux Jazz Festival |website=Nme.com |date=5 April 2014 |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.ch/info/culture/6472874-benjamin-clementine-poetiques-murmures-blues.html |title=Benjamin Clementine, poétiques murmures blues - rts.ch - Culture |website=Rts.ch |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/arts/musique/entrevues/201503/30/01-4856808-le-cas-benjamin-clementine.php |title=Le cas Benjamin Clementine {{pipe}} Alain Brunet {{pipe}} Entrevues |website=Lapresse.ca |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> As a result, the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]] in 2013 booked Clementine to play. He failed to attend. According to Clementine, he was kicked off the train en route to Rotterdam for being unable to show a valid ticket. He didn't have enough money due to not getting paid by his then-tour agent. Clementine later stated that he had attempted to travel by foot to Rotterdam, after assuming the city was close by. However, the journey was in fact 45&nbsp;km, which was considerably longer than he had estimated. He had tried to stop passers by while walking along the motorway, but nobody would stop and help. It took him about 10 hours to complete the journey and he arrived at his destination with bleeding toes. When he set off walking he was wearing slippers, but at some point decided to carry on walking barefoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3voor12.vpro.nl/nieuws/2014/Into-The-Great-Wide-Open-2014/ITGWO14-Benjamin-Clementine-recensie.html |title=ITGWO14: Benjamin Clementine betovert met poëtisch zelfbeklag |publisher=3voor12 |date=7 September 2014 |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Ralph-Hermen Huiskamp |url=http://3voor12.vpro.nl/nieuws/2014/Into-The-Great-Wide-Open-2014/ITGWO14-Benjamin-Clementine.html |title=ITGWO 2014: Benjamin Clementine eist geduld van zijn publiek |publisher=3voor12 |date=1 September 2014 |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref>

In March 2015, whilst performing in the middle of a concert in Paris, he cut a finger open and started to bleed, but kept on playing until an audience member threw tissues on the stage. He later cynically remarked: that's what happens when you fall in love; you get hurt.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

{{quote|This debut EP offers a taste of one of 2014's most promising new talents. With just Benjamin Clementine's impulsive piano figures accompanying his dark, powerful voice, there's a soulful solemnity about these searching songs. But there's also a wealth of imagination at work: "It's a wonderful life, traversed in tears from the heavens," he observes in "I Won't Complain", surveying the emotional turmoil that renders his heart a "melodrama in fact"; while over flurries of piano, his urgent delivery of "Cornerstone" blends the sensitivity of Antony Hegarty with the wracked passion of Nina Simone, admitting loneliness as his "home, home, home", but biting off the word to sound like "hope". A distinctive and impressive new voice.<ref name="independent1">{{cite news|last=Gill |first=Andy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-reviews-lincoln-durham-boy--bear-run-the-jewels-benjamin-clementine-howe-gelb-9049703.html |title=Album reviews: Lincoln Durham, Boy & Bear, Run The Jewels, Benjamin Clementine, Howe Gelb |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=11 January 2014 |access-date=13 August 2014}}</ref>}}

==Studio albums==
===''At Least for Now''===
{{Main|At Least for Now}}
Clementine initially wanted to record his debut album, ''At Least for Now'', straight after his first EP, ''Cornerstone'', but due to contractual dealings with the music industry and his label it was strategically held back for almost two years. During that time he decided to write his own dictionary, as well as a collection of poetry<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Hudak |first=Joseph |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/10-new-artists-you-need-to-know-november-2014-20141120/benjamin-clementine-20141120 |title=Benjamin Clementine - Dej Loaf, Oliver Heldens and 8 More New Artists You Need to Know |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> and classical music pieces. ''At Least for Now'' was mainly released across Europe on 12 January 2015.<ref name="lefigaro.fr"/> On 13 February 2015 it reached the iTunes Top 10 in Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg Poland and Greece. In England, it won the prestigious [[Mercury Music Prize]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1HwNyl69kmN1fcWlcH7rTfb/mercury-prize-2015-shortlist |title=Mercury Prize 2015 shortlist |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=16 October 2015}}</ref>

''At Least for Now'' largely received critical acclaim. The album holds a 75 out of 100 rating based on 19 critical reviews indicating "generally positive reviews" from Metacritic. David Simpson from ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the album 3 stars out of 5, describing the debut as "fascinating but flawed", explaining that it  "benefits from the bravery and adventurousness Clementine honed while tackling audiences aboard Parisian trains." Regarding Clementine's vocals, Simpson said: "Channelling influences such as Erik Satie and Antony Hegarty, Clementine is reminiscent of [[Kevin Rowland]] in that he sounds as if he is singing from the gut, and because he has to. If only he had Rowlands' economy: mannered vocal flourishes complicate the melodies when what's needed is simplicity. The addition of syrupy strings and pedestrian drumming further dilutes the impact of his raw talent. However, when he performs unadorned, melodies dripping from his fingertips, and letting fly from the heart, his voice is difficult to forget."<ref>{{cite news|author=Dave Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/26/benjamin-clementine-at-least-for-now-review |title=Benjamin Clementine: At Least for Now review – fascinating but flawed debut {{pipe}} Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref> Phil Mongredien, also reviewing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', gave the album 4 stars out of 5, writing that "for the most part these piano-led songs sound unique, the lonely despair of Cornerstone and the arresting lyricism of Condolence signalling an exciting new talent."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/29/benjamin-clementine-at-least-for-now-review-condolence-cornerstone|title=Benjamin Clementine: At Least for Now review – at times quite brilliant|first=Phil|last=Mongredien|date=29 March 2015|website=Theguardian.co.uk|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref>

===''I Tell a Fly''===
{{Main|I Tell a Fly}}
Accompanied by a video shot by photographer Craig McDean and filmmaker Masha Vasyukova published earlier than its official release on 30 June 2017, Clementine composed [[Phantom of Aleppoville]] after being affected by the writing of pioneering British psychoanalyst [[Donald Winnicott]]. He wrote extensively about children who have experienced bullying in the home and at school, discovering that while the trauma was naturally not comparable in scale to that suffered by children displaced by war, its effects followed similar patterns. Seeing in Winicott's writing a mirror of his own childhood experiences, Clementine chose the title – the "little city of Aleppo" – to symbolise a place where children encounter such bullying.  Says Clementine, "Aleppoville is a place where many are bullied if not all, but no one understands nor see why; Phantom".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockshot.co.uk/26790/rock-show-benjamin-clementine/|title=Rock Show: Benjamin Clementine ⋆ RockShot Mag|date=30 May 2017|website=Rockshot.co.uk|access-date=6 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827171513/http://rockshot.co.uk/26790/rock-show-benjamin-clementine/|archive-date=27 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/listen-benjamin-clementine-phantom-of-aleppoville|title=Listen: Benjamin Clementine - 'Phantom of Aleppoville'|website=Clashmusic.com|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> I Tell a Fly finds Clementine exploring new musical territory on the heels of his Mercury Prize-winning debut, [[At Least for Now]] (2015). At Least for Now stretched itself across a series of piano ballads with unorthodox structures; I Tell a Fly brings a sense of theatricality and power by using whirling, interwoven instruments throughout the uncompromising release. While at Least for Now looked inward and backward, Clementine's follow-up looks outward and forward-to a changing world, ancient struggles and the individual response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/06/26/benjamin-clementine-i-tell-a-fly-interview|title=Benjamin Clementine on How Global Politics Shaped His Experimental Second Album|website=Thefader.com|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> In conversation with David Renshaw, Clementine explains that the origin of I Tell a Fly lies in a disarmingly strange line Clementine found in his American visa: "an alien of extraordinary abilities." He explains, "I was baffled for about ten minutes when I first saw that visa. But then I thought to myself, I am an alien. I'm a wanderer. In most places I've been, I've always been different. And so I began to think about the story of a couple of birds, who are in love: one is afraid to go further, and the other is taking a risk, to see what happens." On I Tell a Fly, Clementine uses his personal history as a prism through which to view the world around him (and attempt to make sense of both), musically exploring unknown territories while maintaining a lifeblood that could not be mistaken for the work of anyone other than him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Benjamin-Clementine-Announces-New-Album-I-Tell-a-Fly-20170626|title=Benjamin Clementine Announces New Album ' I Tell a Fly'|website=Broadwayworld.com|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref>

==Artistry==
===Voice===
Clementine is a [[spinto tenor]].<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> His voice has been described as warm and graceful, with a bright, full timbre, that ranges from approximately E2-C#6.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
Writing for [[The Quietus]], Calum Bradbury-Sparvell described Clementine's voice as having the "expressive but exact enunciation of a stage actor, which allows his lyrics to spill and scatter out of sync with his hands in a way which warrants the endless Nina Simone comparisons." He went on to write: "Yet as an atypical singer-songwriter with a strong sense of grandeur, an impressively broad tenor range and more than a dash of dark humour, he also resembles [[Rufus Wainwright]]".<ref name="thequietus.com">{{cite magazine|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/17167-benjamin-clementine-at-least-for-now-review |title=Reviews {{pipe}} Benjamin Clementine |magazine=The Quietus |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref>

===Instruments===
Clementine is a multi instrumentalist and cites a broad range of musical influences: [[Claude Debussy]], Erik Satie, [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Leo Ferré]], Nina Simone, [[Jake Thackray]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Lucio Dalla]], [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Maria Callas]], [[Georges Brassens]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]]. In a 2015 interview he listed Simone, [[Nick Cave]] and [[Tom Waits]] as his heroes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/18/benjamin-clementine-i-sang-on-the-paris-metro-like-i-was-playing-in-a-stadium |title=Benjamin Clementine: 'I sang on the Paris metro like I was playing in a stadium' |last1=Mokoena |first1=Tshepo |date=18 November 2015 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref> 
Clementine had little exposure to music whilst growing up and is self-taught. In his teens he had caught avant-garde French composers like Erik Satie and Claude Debussy. These influences inspired him to create his own material. He accompanies on hypnotic piano vamps<ref name="independent2">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/bright-young-things-the-best-new-talent-in-the-arts-for-2014-9035222.html |title=Bright young things: The best new talent in the arts for 2014 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=3 January 2014 |access-date=13 August 2014}}</ref> with mostly minimal instruments ranging from little voice breaths, a brushing of coat for percussion as in his song "Edmonton", to a vicious string stride confrontation in his song "Adios".<ref name="theguardian1">{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Tim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/09/benjamin-clementine-barefoot-troubadour-singer-songwriter-interview |title=Benjamin Clementine: the barefoot troubadour who speaks his mind |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 August 2014 |access-date=13 August 2014}}</ref>

===Poetry===
Clementine states he has mainly been influenced by confessional poets like [[Sylvia Plath]] as well as writers such as [[William Blake]], [[Carol Ann Duffy]], [[James Baldwin]], the philosopher [[John Locke]] and [[C. S. Lewis]]. In an interview with the broadsheet newspaper [[The Times]] with Ed Potton, Clementine expressed his feelings of hating the works of [[William Shakespeare]] as a child as it was all his teachers always taught him so he preferably went to his local library to read the other William, [[William Blake]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Ed Potton |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article4493757.ece |title=Benjamin Clementine: 'Sometimes I feel out of this world' |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=11 July 2015 |access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref> Whilst in Paris, he discovered French poets such as [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]] including poet-singers such as [[Leo Ferré]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Jacques Brel]] and [[Charles Aznavour]] with whom he sang and recorded the song 'You've got to learn'.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yann Bertrand |url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/emission/info-culture/2014-2015/charles-aznavour-son-51e-album-encores-sort-ce-lundi-04-05-2015-08-14 |title=Charles Aznavour, son 51e album "Encores" sort ce lundi {{pipe}} France info |language=fr|website=Franceinfo.fr |date=14 August 2015 |access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfimusique.com/actu-musique/chanson/album/20150508-charles-aznavour-encores |title=Aznavour, l'éternel assoiffé |website=Rfimusique.com |date=8 May 2015 |access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref> It is Paris where Clementine discovered Nina Simone. He delivers his introspective lyrics about integrity and vulnerability and explores both in everyday experience. One of his frustrations after returning to the UK was how little ambition he thinks there is in British song lyrics compared to his experience of French music. Talking to ''The Guardian'' journalist Tim Lewis, he said, "it's very important down there (France) because most of the time they [the audience] pay more attention to what the singer says and what they are trying to express."<ref name="theguardian1"/>

In his song "Winston Churchill's boy", he rewrites and repurposes the [[Never was so much owed by so many to so few|words]] of [[Winston Churchill]], lamenting "never in the field of human affection had so much been given for so few attention". Writing for [[The Quietus]], Calum Bradbury-Sparvell described the song in the context of Clementine's debut album as "a melodramatic beginning which harks back to the alienation he felt from family and friends on the eve of his emigration to the City of Light," going on to write: "For a Gallic darling, Clementine certainly gazes wistfully across La Manche a lot and one senses that, despite the obvious French influences, there is more of the spurned Londoner in him than the [[flâneur]].<ref name="thequietus.com"/>

Mostly playing on stage entirely in black or dark long trench-like woollen coats with no shirt underneath, in barefoot, Clementine's distinctive androgynous appearance, square-cut, angular padded clothing, manner, and height of 193&nbsp;cm (6'4) is uniquely known at least as much as he is for his art. In March 2015 Clementine was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed by the Financial Times.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/72fea7de-9f45-11e5-beba-5e33e2b79e46.html|title=Best dressed 2015|first=Jo|last=Ellison|date=16 December 2015|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> Clementine collaborated multiple times with [[Christopher Bailey (fashion designer)|Christopher Bailey]].
