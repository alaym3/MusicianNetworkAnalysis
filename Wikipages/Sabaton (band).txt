'''Sabaton''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈsɑ̂ːbaˌtɔn|lang}}){{Needs verification|date=December 2020}} is a Swedish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Falun]]. Most of their nine albums are written about war. Their latest album ''[[The Great War (Sabaton album)|The Great War]]'' (2019) reached number 1 on Swedish and German music charts.

==History==
===Formation and first albums (1999–2009)===
Sabaton was formed in December 1999. After the first songs were recorded in [[Peter Tägtgren]]'s studio, [[The Abyss (recording studio)|The Abyss]], Sabaton was contacted by a couple of record labels. The band signed with the Italian label [[Underground Symphony]], which then released, internationally, the promo CD ''Fist for Fight''. The disc, distilled from two demo tapes recorded between 1999 and 2000, was intended to promote forthcoming Sabaton releases. In 2002, a new album, ''[[Metalizer]]'' was recorded and was supposed to be distributed by Underground Symphony as the band's debut album. After two years of waiting, during which the band held various performances across Sweden, the album was abandoned.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/sa-javla-metal/sabaton-med-krig-som-tema|title=Sabaton – med krig som tema|last=Sweden|first=Sveriges Television AB, Stockholm|work=svt.se|access-date=9 October 2017|language=sv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnrmetal.com/v3/band/band/Saba|title=The BNR Metal Pages - Sabaton|website=Bnrmetal.com|access-date=9 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009200840/http://www.bnrmetal.com/v3/band/band/Saba|archive-date=9 October 2017}}</ref>

The band returned for a second album titled ''[[Primo Victoria]]''. Brodén stated that album's title track "kicked off" the band's historical theme.<ref>{{cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/07/sabaton-joakim-broden-interview-2019/ |title=Sabaton's Joakim Brodén on The Great War, Tour Plans, and More |publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=8 July 2019 |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> Sundström stated that the band decided to focus primarily on historical themes in their lyrics after he and Brodén watched the film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalblast.net/interviews/par-sundstrom-interview/|title=Interview with Pär Sundstrom (Sabaton) &#124; Metal Blast!|date=18 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718093755/http://www.metalblast.net/interviews/par-sundstrom-interview/|access-date=15 October 2020|archive-date=18 July 2014}}</ref> Sabaton signed with Black Lodge, the metal division of the Sound Pollution record label. In early 2005, keyboardist Daniel Myhr was recruited in order to relieve [[Joakim Brodén]] of his keyboard duties. In early 2006, Sabaton toured in support of [[Edguy]] and [[DragonForce]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sabaton-to-support-edguy-dragonforce-on-european-tour/|title=SABATON To Support EDGUY, DRAGONFORCE On European Tour|date=24 December 2005|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> The band's third album, ''[[Attero Dominatus]]'', was released in Europe on 28 July 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/discography/details/76436.71102.attero-dominatus.html|title=Attero Dominatus by SABATON - info and shop at Nuclear Blast - Nuclear Blast|website=Nuclearblast.de|language=en|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref> In March 2007, Sabaton released ''[[Metalizer]]'' as a double disc together with ''Fist for Fight'', along with the previously unreleased song "Birds of War".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/discography/details/76439.71102.metalizer.html|title=Metalizer by SABATON - info and shop at Nuclear Blast - Nuclear Blast|website=Nuclearblast.de|language=en|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref>

As a follow-up to ''Metalizer'', in May 2008, Sabaton released its fourth album ''[[The Art of War (Sabaton album)|The Art of War]]'', an album inspired by the influential [[The Art of War|book]] by [[Sun Tzu]]. The decision to base the album upon Sun Tzu's book came from the idea that in the 2000 years since the book was written, the human race has achieved many things but, apart from weapon advancements, operational art, strategy, and war itself have remained basically the same.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=January 2011}} The album contains the singles "Cliffs of Gallipoli" and "Ghost Division". They toured Europe in 2009 as an opening act on the [[HammerFall]] Tour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/hammerfall-sabaton-bullet-european-tour-dates-announced/|title=HAMMERFALL, SABATON, BULLET: European Tour Dates Announced|date=10 November 2008|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> After their Bloodstock performance, the band again went on tour with [[DragonForce]], towards the end of 2009, for eighteen shows in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-discovery.com/Interviews/sabaton_interview_2009_pt1.htm|title=Metal Discovery: Interview with Sabaton - 10th December 2009|last=Holmes|first=Mark|website=Metal-discovery.com|language=en|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref>

===''Coat of Arms'' (2010–2011)===
The band had hoped to begin recording the next album in October but with concerts booked and the DragonForce support tour the following month, it was pushed back. On 23 December 2009, the band announced the name of their forthcoming album. ''[[Coat of Arms (album)|Coat of Arms]]'' contains a majority of songs about World War II including the Winter War. They announced it on their official website, and posted a link to a YouTube video containing the album art and a teaser music sample. ''Coat of Arms'' was released on 21 May 2010. The first music video, for "[[Coat of Arms (album)|Uprising]]", was released on 1 August 2010 and features [[Peter Stormare]]. This was accompanied by a European tour. A second music video, for "[[Coat of Arms (album)|Screaming Eagles]]", was released on 25 May.

===Lineup change (2012–2015)===
In 2012, two-thirds of Sabaton's lineup left the band.<ref name="axs">{{cite web |last1=Rose |first1=Rustyn |title=Sabaton's bassist shares 5 unknown facts about the band |url=https://www.axs.com/sabaton-s-bassist-shares-5-unknown-facts-about-the-band-117952 |website=AXS |publisher=AXS |access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref> On 31 March vocalist Joakim Brodén confirmed rumors that the band would be going separate ways, with only Brodén himself and bass player Pär Sundström staying on board. Sabaton was joined by new members Chris Rörland and Thobbe Englund on guitar, and Robban Bäck on drums. Former Sabaton guitarists Oskar Montelius and Rikard Sundén, drummer Daniel Mullback and keyboardist Daniel Myhr went on, together with vocalist [[Nils Patrik Johansson]] and bassist Stefan Eriksson, to form a new band, [[Civil War (band)|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musiknyheter.nu/fore-detta-sabaton-medlemmar-lanserar-civil-war_20120528.html|title=Före detta Sabaton-medlemmar lanserar Civil War|date=2012|website=Musiknyheter.nu}}</ref> In November 2012, drummer Robban Bäck decided to take a break from touring due to becoming a father. [[Snowy Shaw]] replaced him as touring drummer, who in turn was replaced by Hannes Van Dahl in November 2013. Prior to replacing Shaw, Van Dahl had worked as Shaw's drum technician while drumming for the band [[Evergrey]].

==Lyrical and musical style==
[[File:German - Sabaton for the Right Foot - Walters 51591.jpg|thumb|[[Sabaton]], c. 1550]]

The band's main lyrical themes are based on war, historical battles, and acts of heroism<ref>{{cite web |title=Facts Over Fiction: Interview with Joakim Brodén From Sabaton |url=https://californiarocknews.com/2018/02/13/sabaton-kreator-wiltern-draft/ |website=California Rock News |access-date=29 July 2018 |date=13 February 2018}}</ref>—the name is a reference to a [[sabaton]], knight's foot armor. The armor and battle theme is heard in most songs in almost every album except ''[[Metalizer]]''. Their latest album, ''[[The Great War (Sabaton album)|The Great War]]'', was released on 19 July 2019, with the songs all being based on [[World War I]]. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, [[World War II]] and other historical conflicts is prevalent and lyrics often recite stories of heroic deeds by men, women, and armies, such as the song "White Death", for example, which was made in honor of legendary Finnish sniper [[Simo Häyhä]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpOWdn8Myjg |title=Sabaton – White Death |date=19 March 2019 |medium=YouTube |orig-year=2010 |access-date=13 July 2020}}</ref><ref>[https://www.is.fi/viihde/art-2000000180105.html IS: Ruotsalaisbändi laulaa suomalaisesta sotasankarista] (in Finnish), Is.fi</ref>

In 2008, the then presiding archbishop of Gdansk [[Sławoj Leszek Głódź]] awarded Sabaton with an authentic Polish officer sabre, the background was that the band had highlighted Polish soldiers in some of their songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dziennikbaltycki.pl/abp-glodz-przekaze-szable-dla-sabatonu/ar/58791|title=Abp Głódź przekaże szablę dla Sabatonu!|date=7 November 2008}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
One of Sabaton's songs, entitled "Ghost Division", has spurred controversy, due to their so-called glorification of [[Nazi Germany]] and it's military, specifically regarding the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)]] the in the song. Brodén, the band's lead singer, stated in a recent interview on Sabaton's Youtube channel that if people take issue with that, "they have a problem with history, not with us".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ-puqIwoAU|date=29 November 2021</ref>. His response has been met with positive feedback from the Sabaton community.
