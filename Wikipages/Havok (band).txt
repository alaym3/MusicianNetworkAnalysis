'''Havok''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band from [[Denver, Colorado]], formed in 2004. As of 2021, their current lineup consists of David Sanchez (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, lead guitar), Pete Webber (drums) and Reece Scruggs (lead guitar). They have gone through a number of personnel changes, with each album featuring a different lineup, and leaving Sanchez as the only remaining original member left in the band.

To date, Havok has released five studio albums – ''[[Burn (Havok Album)|Burn]]'' (2009), ''[[Time Is Up]]'' (2011), ''[[Unnatural Selection (Havok album)|Unnatural Selection]]'' (2013), ''[[Conformicide]]'' (2017) and ''[[V (Havok album)|V]]'' (2020) – and they are working on new music as of 2021.<ref name="metalstorm">{{cite web|url=http://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=42898|title=Havok - Bassist Quits The Band|publisher=[[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]]|access-date=August 3, 2021|date=August 3, 2021}}</ref> Along with [[Bonded by Blood (band)|Bonded by Blood]], [[Evile]], [[Hatchet (band)|Hatchet]], [[Municipal Waste (band)|Municipal Waste]] and [[Warbringer]], the band has been credited for leading the so-called "thrash metal revival" scene in the late 2000s and early 2010s,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://skullsnbones.com/hatchet-fear-beyond-lunacy-review/|title=Hatchet: "Fear Beyond Lunacy" Album Review by Jason Z!|website=skullsnbones.com|access-date=August 3, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thisisnotascene.com/2013/havok-unnatural-selection/|title=Havok - Unnatural Selection|website=thisisnotascene.com|access-date=August 3, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalassault.com/gig_reviews/2017/01/16/new-extremes-deafheaven-play-sold-out-la-show-with-health-skeletal-remains/|title=New Extremes: Deafheaven Play Sold-Out LA Show with Health, Skeletal Remains|website=metalassault.com|access-date=August 3, 2021}}</ref> and their music has been mostly influenced by the 1980s thrash metal scene as well as the [[New wave of British heavy metal]], [[death metal]], [[hardcore punk]] and [[progressive rock]]/[[progressive metal|metal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.givememetal.com/thrashmetaltrees/havok-family-tree|title=Havok Family Tree — The Metal|website=givememetal.com|access-date=May 19, 2021}}</ref>

== History ==
David Sanchez formed Havok with classmate and drummer, Haakon Sjoegren. The duo searched for a lead guitarist by putting up fliers around the [[Denver]] area, and local guitarist Shawn Chavez joined the band.<ref name="westword">{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/2009-05-14/music/the-young-men-of-havok-prove-their-metal/|title=The young men of HAVOK prove their metal|access-date=January 30, 2013|date=May 14, 2009|publisher=[[westword]]}}</ref> Eventually, they rounded out their first lineup with Marcus Corich on bass, and in 2004, Havok recorded their first demo, "Thrash Can". In 2005, they self-released another EP, "Murder by Metal". By 2007, Tyler Cantrell had taken up the role as bassist, and Rich Tice on drums. On September 19, with this new line-up in place, Havok released their first self-released EP, "Pwn 'Em All".<ref name="westword"/> Tyler's brother, Justin Cantrell - also a bassist, replaced him for several tours in support of the EP.

In December 2007, Havok, having just hired drummer Ryan Bloom that fall, sent a copy of their EP and a press kit to any metal label they could find. The EP caught the ear of English extreme metal label, [[Candlelight Records]], and soon after the band agreed to join them. Havok hired new bassist, Jesse De Los Santos, in the fall of 2008. On June 2, 2009, Havok released their full-length debut, '' [[Burn (Havok album)|Burn]]''.<ref name="westword"/> However, Ryan Bloom left the band in April before the release of "Burn".<ref name="thrashunlimited">{{cite web|url=http://www.thrashunlimited.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=5577|title=Havok in Search of New Drummer|access-date=February 1, 2013|date=April 12, 2009|publisher=ThrashUnlimited.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928073454/http://www.thrashunlimited.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=5577|archive-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref> To replace him, they briefly went on the road with Scott Fuller, but they eventually hired Pete Webber as the full-time drummer. ''Burn'' was received quite well in the metal community, but it did not yet break them into the global metal scene. The band was set to begin touring with [[Primal Fear (band)|Primal Fear]] on May 20, 2010, at New York's Gramercy Theater, but guitarist Shawn Chavez quit the band the same day. Instead of jumping ship, Sanchez took up learning all the solos, and Havok toured as a trio.<ref name="metalsucks">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/05/21/havok-wreak-havoc/|title=HAVOK WREAK HAVOC|access-date=February 1, 2013}}</ref> In September 2010, Winchester, VA shredder Reece Scruggs joined the band as their new lead guitarist. Havok then returned to the studio to record their sophomore effort. On March 29, 2011, Havok released ''[[Time Is Up]]''.<ref name="Havokband">{{cite web|url=http://havokband.com/?page_id=2|title=Havok Biography|access-date=February 1, 2013}}</ref> This spread through the metal community, receiving strong reviews from critics and fans alike. It became a defining album in what has come to be known as the New Wave of Thrash Metal scene. The success of ''Time Is Up'' has led the band to major tours opening for bands like thrash metal veterans [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]], alongside [[Revocation (band)|Revocation]] and [[White Wizzard]]; as well as tours opening for [[Sepultura]], [[Death Angel]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], The English Dogs, [[the Casualties]], [[Goatwhore]], [[3 Inches of Blood]], [[Skeletonwitch]], and [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]].<ref name="metalsucks2">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/04/29/forbidden-revocation-white-wizzard-and-havok-u-s-tour-youre-headbanging/|title=FORBIDDEN, REVOCATION, WHITE WIZZARD AND HAVOK U.S. TOUR = YOU'RE HEADBANGING|access-date=February 5, 2013}}</ref><ref name="metalsucks3">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/07/29/exhumedgoatwhorecephalic-carnage-havok-this-tour-is-gonna-be-sssssiiiiccckkk/|title=EXHUMED/GOATWHORE/CEPHALIC CARNAGE/HAVOK: THIS TOUR IS GONNA BE SSSSSIIIICCCKKK|access-date=February 5, 2013}}</ref> 2012 was wrapped up for the band by playing the first Barge to Hell cruise featuring bands [[At the Gates]], [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], and [[Sacred Reich]] to name a few.

After over a year of heavy touring, Havok returned home to Denver with plans to record their next album. Havok was invited to open for [[Testament (band)|Testament]]'s 'Dark Roots of Thrash' tour at their Denver show after [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] was forced to drop from the tour due to singer [[Bobby "Blitz" Ellsworth]] falling ill.<ref name="DenverHeavyMetalSociety">{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/Denver-Heavy-Metal-Society-m/events/92904732/|title=Join us for Testament, Flotsam & Jetsam & Havok \m/|access-date=February 8, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014817/http://www.meetup.com/Denver-Heavy-Metal-Society-m/events/92904732/|archive-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref> Fans were introduced to Havok's new bassist, Mike Leon (previously of Tampa, Florida metallers [[The Absence (band)|the Absence]]), after Jesse left the band to spend time with family. Havok began recording their newest album in the spring of 2013. ''Unnatural Selection'' was released on June 25, 2013, and in its first week charted on the Billboard top 200 at No. 154 selling over 2,500 copies. Shortly after the release, the band went to Bogota, Colombia to play the Rock Al Parque festival, playing to an estimated 45,000 people. The festival also included [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Symphony X]]. The band set out on a 50 plus day headline tour to support "Unnatural Selection" with dates that lead up to the Montreal, Canada festival [[Heavy MTL]] on August 11. Unnatural Selection was the band's last release on Candlelight Records<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockrevoltmagazine.com/Magazine/September2013/RockRevoltIssue6.html#p=8| author=Alice Roques| publisher=Rock Revolt Magazine| date=September 1, 2013| title=INTERVIEW: HAVOK'}}</ref> and on July 11, the band signed with [[Century Media Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/havok-signs-with-century-media/| date=July 11, 2014| title=Havok signs with CENTURY MEDIA}}</ref>
