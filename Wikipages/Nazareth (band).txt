[[File:Nazareth1small.jpg|thumb|left|Nazareth performing on 6 March 1976]]
Nazareth formed in December 1968 in [[Dunfermline]], Scotland, from the remaining members of semi-professional local group The Shadettes (formed in 1961) by vocalist [[Dan McCafferty]], guitarist [[Manny Charlton]], bassist [[Pete Agnew]], and drummer [[Darrell Sweet (musician)|Darrell Sweet]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=1998 |title=Guinness Rockopedia |edition=1st |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd. |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/284 284] |isbn=0-85112-072-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/284 }}</ref> They were inspired by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref>[http://www.nazarethdirect.co.uk/website/the-band/nazareth-history/ Pete Agnew compares Nazareth] and [[Aerosmith]] with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.</ref> Nazareth took their name from [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania]], which is cited in the first line of [[The Band]]'s classic song "[[The Weight]]" ("I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead...").<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" />

The band moved to London, England in 1970 and released their [[Nazareth (album)|eponymous]] debut album in 1971.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" /> After getting some attention with their second album ''[[Exercises (album)|Exercises]],'' released in 1972, Nazareth supported [[Deep Purple]] on [[concert tour|tour]], and issued the [[Roger Glover]]-produced ''[[Razamanaz]]'', in early 1973.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" /> This collection spawned two UK [[Record chart|Top Ten]] hits, "[[Broken Down Angel]]" and "Bad Bad Boy".<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" /> This was followed by ''[[Loud 'N' Proud]]'' in late 1973, which contained another hit single with a [[cover version|cover]] of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s song "[[This Flight Tonight]]".<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" /> Then came another album ''[[Rampant (album)|Rampant]],'' in 1974, that was equally successful although its only single, "Shanghai'd in Shanghai", narrowly missed the British Top 40.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> A non-album song, again a cover version, this time of [[Tomorrow (band)|Tomorrow]]'s "[[My White Bicycle]]", was a UK Top 20 entry in 1975.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" />

''[[Hair of the Dog (album)|Hair of the Dog]]'' was released in April 1975 and was produced by Manny Charlton, ending Roger Glover's association with the band.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> The title track of that album (popularly, though incorrectly, known as "Son of a Bitch" due to its hook [[lyrics|lyric]]) became a staple of 1970s rock radio. The American version of the album included a song originally recorded by [[The Everly Brothers]], the melodic [[Boudleaux Bryant]]-penned ballad "[[Love Hurts]]", that was released as a hit single in the UK and in the US, where it went [[music recording sales certification|platinum]]. The track became the band's only US [[Top 40|Top Ten]] hit<ref name="British Hit Singles" /> and was also a top 10 hit in nine other countries, reaching number 1 in six of them.  The song was on the Norwegian [[record chart|chart]] for 60 weeks.<ref name="British Hit Singles">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=2001 |title=British Hit Singles |edition=14th |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |location=London |page=332 |isbn=0-85156-156-X}}</ref>

In 1979, second guitarist [[Zal Cleminson]] was added to the line-up, remaining for two albums, ''[[No Mean City (album)|No Mean City]]'' and ''[[Malice in Wonderland (Nazareth album)|Malice in Wonderland]]'', and contributing numerous compositions.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" /> ''Malice in Wonderland'' contained the single "[[Holiday (Nazareth song)|Holiday]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> In 1981, they contributed the song "Crazy (A Suitable Case for Treatment)" to the [[Heavy Metal (film)#Soundtrack|soundtrack]] to the film, ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]''.

Various Nazareth line-ups continued to make studio albums and tour throughout the 1980s and 1990s, although their popularity had declined such that some albums no longer received either a UK or a US release. They remained popular in Europe, particularly Germany, where "[[Dream On (Nazareth song)|Dream On]]" became a [[hit single]]. In 1991, [[Billy Rankin (guitarist)|Billy Rankin]] returned to replace Manny Charlton on the ''[[No Jive]]'' album, remaining with the band until 1994.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" />

A tribute came in 1993 when [[Guns N' Roses]] covered Nazareth's "Hair of the Dog" on ''[["The Spaghetti Incident?"]]'', consolation after they turned down [[Axl Rose]]'s request for the group to play at his wedding.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" /> Rankin departed again in 1994, but with [[Jimmy Murrison]] and keyboard player Ronnie Leahy, Nazareth maintained a live following in Europe and the US.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" />

Nazareth continued touring after Rankin's departure, with [[Jimmy Murrison]] and keyboard player Ronnie Leahy.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" /> While on tour in 1999, original drummer Darrell Sweet died at age 51 of a heart attack. He was replaced by bassist Pete Agnew's son [[Lee Agnew|Lee]] for later editions of the band.

On 4 August 2006, [[John Locke (musician)|John Locke]], the former keyboardist of the band, died from cancer at the age of 62.<ref>{{cite web |author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2006b.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 2006 July to December |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |access-date=24 March 2014}}</ref>

In February 2008, ''[[The Newz (album)|The Newz]]'' was released on the [[Hamburg]]-based label, Edel Entertainment. The release of the album coincided with Nazareth's fortieth anniversary tour, which started on 25 January in [[Sweden]] and visited most of Europe, finished on 4 November 2008 in [[Norway]]. A follow up album, ''[[Big Dogz]]'', was released on 15 April 2011.
