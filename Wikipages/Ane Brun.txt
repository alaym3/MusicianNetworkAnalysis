'''Ane Brun''' ({{IPA-no|ˈɑ̂ːnə ˈbrʉːn}}; born '''Ane Brunvoll''' on 10 March 1976) is a Norwegian songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist of [[Sami people|Sami]] origin.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ane Brun's post on Sami People's National Day |url=https://www.facebook.com/anebrunofficial/posts/today-is-the-sami-peoples-national-day-not-only-have-i-got-sami-ancestors-but-iv/10156076955054420/ |access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> Since 2003, she has recorded ten albums, eight of which are studio albums of original material (including a collection of duets), an acoustic album, and a covers album; she has also released three live albums, two compilations, one live DVD, and four EPs. She has lived in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, since 2001, where she writes, records, and runs her own label (Balloon Ranger Recordings).<ref name=mic1>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mic.no/nmi.nsf/micdoc/art2006050209471221436942 |title=Brun, Ane Biography - Norsk Musikkinformasjon MIC.no |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314151605/http://www.mic.no/nmi.nsf/micdoc/art2006050209471221436942 |archive-date=2013-03-14 }} (in Norwegian)</ref>

==Early life and education==
Ane Brunvoll is the daughter of lawyer Knut Anker Brunvoll (b. 1945) and jazz singer and pianist Inger Johanne Brunvoll (b. [[Kvien]] 1945). She grew up in a musical family in [[Molde]], Norway. Her younger sister is singer [[Mari Kvien Brunvoll]] (b. 1984). Her older brother is photographer Bjørn Brunvoll (b. 1973).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.groove.no/artist/48133236/bjorn-brunvoll |title=Bjørn Brunvoll - Groove.no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pxQEAAAAMBAJ&q=Ane+Brun&pg=PA41|title=Global Pulse|last=Ferguson|first=Tom|date=14 May 2005|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=31 May 2012}}</ref>

In 1995, she moved to study at the University of Bergen, jumping between courses in Spanish, law, and music. In Bergen, she began writing her own material. She spent the next few years moving between [[Barcelona]], [[Oslo]], and [[Bergen]] while making a living working in record shops and bars.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==Career==
After playing a few minor shows and recording her first demos in Bergen in 1999, she moved to Sweden, first to [[Uppsala]] and then to [[Stockholm]] in 2001, where she started to take her musical career seriously.

Brun recorded her debut album, ''[[Spending Time with Morgan]]'', in 2002 in both Stockholm and back in Uppsala, with engineers and producers [[Katharina Nuttall]], Cécile Grudet, and Kim Nelson. It was released on the DetErMine label, which she formed with Ellekari Larsson from the Swedish band [[The Tiny]]. The album was released in 11 European countries in 2003 through a licence/distribution deal with [[V2 Music]].<ref name="mic1"/>

===Touring, 2002–2007===
[[Image:Ane brun hamburg2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ane Brun, Hamburg 2008.]]
After releasing her first album, Brun toured around Europe but soon took some time out. She had been working intensively for two years and felt somewhat burnt out and in need of a break. After a six-month breather, she started touring around Europe again and within the next year had her second album ready.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} ''[[A Temporary Dive]]'' was again produced by Katharina Nuttall and was released in 2005 throughout Europe, followed by the UK and the US in 2006, and in Japan in 2007. This album took the darker themes of ''Spending Time With Morgan'' further, through songs like "The Fight Song" and title track "A Temporary Dive", but there was also space for the lighter "Song No. 6", a duet with [[Ron Sexsmith]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

''A Temporary Dive'' was well received all over the world, picking up good reviews in magazines and newspapers from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine to ''[[The Independent]]''. She received award nominations from all over Europe too, and that year took home the [[Spellemannprisen|Spellemannpris]], the Norwegian equivalent of the [[Grammies]], for Best Female Artist.<ref name=mic2>{{Cite news|url=http://www.listento.no/mic.nsf/doc/art2009021111384087767910 |title=Ane Brun returns to the UK - Listen to Norway MIC.no |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160451/http://www.listento.no/mic.nsf/doc/art2009021111384087767910 |archive-date=2015-04-02 }}</ref>

After enjoying the collaboration on the previous few duets she had recorded, Brun was inspired to ask some artists whom she adored to sing with her on a full album called ''[[Duets (Ane Brun album)|Duets]]''. This album was released in November 2005 and besides another recording with [[Ron Sexsmith]], it also included songs with artists such as [[Syd Matters]] and [[Teitur Lassen|Teitur]]. The collaboration with the band [[Madrugada (band)|Madrugada]] on the single "Lift Me" gained her another Norwegian Grammy.<ref name="mic2"/>

Brun spent much of the next couple of years touring the world in many different stage arrangements. She has played with a full band including string section, just herself and string section at times, sometimes just a cello, and one backing vocalist or three. She often ends up coming back to solo acoustic guitar performances. "There is something about the focus in playing by myself that fascinates me", she says. "There’s nothing to hide behind when I'm alone on stage and it becomes almost meditative for me when I play."{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

One of her tours was with a string quintet, recorded and released as ''Live in Scandinavia'' (2007) and featured [[Nina Kinert]] and the guitarist Staffan Johansson. It includes songs from Brun's first two albums with new string arrangements by Malene Bay-Foged.

===Later work, 2008–2013===
[[File:Ane Brun på Stockholms Kulturfestival - 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Brun at the Kulturfestival in Stockholm, 13 August 2010]]
In 2008, Brun released her third studio album, ''[[Changing of the Seasons]]'', which was produced by [[Valgeir Sigurðsson]]. It included string arrangements by American composer [[Nico Muhly]] ([[Antony and the Johnsons]], [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]], ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]'' soundtrack). Later the same year came the album ''Sketches'', which included acoustic demo versions of the songs from ''Changing of the Seasons''. The ''Sketches'' tour featured a stripped down, sparse sound, this time touring with musicians Rebekka Karijord, Jennie Abrahamson, and [[Linnea Olsson]]; there were memorable gigs in places such as the [[Union Chapel, Islington#Music venue|Union Chapel]] in London.<ref name="mic2"/>

Back on the road, a concert at the [[Stockholm Concert Hall]] was filmed and released as an album and live DVD in 2009. Later that year, Brun organised the ''No More Lullabies'' concert to bring attention to the issues of [[climate justice]]. She assembled 24 well-known Swedish artists such as [[Robyn]], [[Loney, Dear]], [[Titiyo]], and [[Benny Andersson]] of [[ABBA]] to take part in seven hours of live music and visuals to mark the [[International Day of Climate Action]] on 24 October 2009. They succeeded in drawing attention to the issue before the upcoming COP15 conference.<ref name="mic2"/>

Brun featured as one of the guests on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s 2011 studio album ''[[New Blood (Peter Gabriel album)|New Blood]]'', singing Kate Bush's part on the re-recorded version of "[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]", recorded in 2010. She was subsequently invited to perform with him as support act and back-up singer on the ''New Blood'' tour throughout 2010.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In late 2011, Brun released her sixth studio album, ''[[It All Starts with One]]'', produced by Tobias Fröberg.

On 11 March 2013, Brun performed her own adaptation of ''[[Dido's Lament]]'', from [[Dido and Aeneas]] by [[Henry Purcell]], at [[Roundhouse (venue)|The Roundhouse]] in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01r5np4 |title=Baroque Remixed - Part 2 |publisher=bbc.co.uk | year=2013 |access-date=11 March 2013}}</ref>

In May 2013, Brun released a 32-track collection of songs from her first 10 years in the music industry, entitled ''Songs 2003–2013'', which included four new songs.
In October 2013, she released a 20-track collection of covers and outtakes entitled ''Rarities'' without pre-promotion.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===2015–2020===
In 2015, Brun released her seventh studio album, titled ''[[When I'm Free]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ane Brun – When I'm Free |url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/ane-brun-im-free |website=musicomh |date=1 September 2015 |access-date=19 December 2020}}</ref> This was followed in 2017 by ''Leave Me Breathless'', a collection of covers of songs by diverse artists including [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Mariah Carey]], and [[Radiohead]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Album Review: Leave Me Breathless, Ane Brun |url=https://www.hotpress.com/music/album-review-ileave-me-breathlessi-ane-brun-20951592#:~:text=16%20Oct%2017-,Album%20Review%3A%20Leave%20Me%20Breathless%2C%20Ane%20Brun,re%2Dinterpretations%20of%2014%20songs. |website=hotpress.com |date=16 October 2017 |access-date=19 December 2020}}</ref> In 2020, the artist released two albums of original material in close succession.

==Personal life==
Brun was diagnosed with [[lupus erythematosus]] at the age of 27, and a lupus flareup in 2012 had her cancel a North American tour with Peter Gabriel.<ref name="npr">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaTONcmNotI |title=Ane Brun: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert |date=April 1, 2016 |last= TOM HUIZENGA  |publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref>
