== Early life and education ==
[[File:Gregory Porter Cosmopolite (220116).jpg|thumb|Porter in concert with his regular band at Cosmopolite club in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], 2016]]
Gregory Porter was born in [[Sacramento]], [[California]], and was raised in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California, where his mother Ruth was a minister.<ref name=RollingOut /> Porter has seven siblings. His mother was a large influence on his life, having encouraged him to sing in church at an early age. His father, Rufus, was largely absent from his life. Says Porter, "Everybody had some issues with their father, even if he was in the house. He may have been emotionally absent. My father was just straight-up absent. I hung out with him just a few days in my life. And it wasn't a long time. He just didn’t seem to be completely interested in being there. Maybe he was, I don't know."<ref name=Jazztimes />

A 1989 graduate of [[Highland High School (Bakersfield, California)|Highland High School]], he received a full [[athletic scholarship]] as a football lineman to [[San Diego State University]] ([[SDSU Aztecs]]), but a shoulder injury during his [[Junior (education)|junior year]] cut short his football career.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://myspace.com/thevoiceofgregoryporter/bio |title=Gregory Porter (thevoiceofgregoryporter) on Myspace |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref>

Porter moved to the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] section of [[Brooklyn]] in 2004, along with his brother Lloyd. He worked as a chef at Lloyd's restaurant Bread-Stuy (now defunct), where he also performed. Porter performed at other neighborhood venues including Sista's Place and Solomon's Porch, and moved on to [[Harlem]] club [[St. Nick's Pub]], where he maintained a weekly residency. Out of this residency evolved what would become Porter's touring band.<ref name=Jazztimes>{{cite web|first=John |last=Murph|title=Gregory Porter: Jazz's Next Great Male Vocalist|url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/29551-gregory-porter-jazz-s-next-great-male-vocalist|website=Jazztimes.com|date=March 30, 2012|access-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref>

On June 26, 2016, Porter performed on the Pyramid Stage at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2016]]. Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', [[Neil McCormick]] said, "The portly middle-aged jazzer may be the oddest pop star on the planet but he is a refreshing testament to the notion that the most important organ for musical appreciation should always be our ears. And Porter has one of the most easy-on-the-ear voices in popular music, a creamy baritone that flows thick and smooth across a rich gateaux of juicy melody. It's a voice that makes you want to lick your lips and dive right in."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/glastonbury-2016-sunday-will-noel-gallagher-join-coldplay-on-sta/|first1=Catherine |last1=Gee|author2= Rupert Hawksley |author3= Patrick Smith|title=Glastonbury 2016, Sunday: Coldplay joined by Michael Eavis and Barry Gibb from The Bee Gees wow the muddy crowd– as it happened|work=The Telegraph|date=June 27, 2016 }}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Since his 2010 debut on the Motéma label, Porter has been well received in the music press.

His debut album, ''Water'', was nominated for Best Jazz Vocal album at the 53rd Annual [[Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/videos/gregory-porter-at-nominees-reception |title=Gregory Porter at Nominees Reception |publisher=grammy.com |date=February 12, 2011 |access-date=4 August 2013}}</ref> He was also a member of the original Broadway cast of ''[[It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues]]''. His second album, ''Be Good'', which contains many of Porter's compositions, garnered critical acclaim for both his distinctive singing and his compositions, such as "Be Good (Lion's Song)", "Real Good Hands", and "On My Way to Harlem". "Real Good Hands" was also nominated for Best Traditional R&B Performance at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2012/12/05/grammy-nominees-list/1749735/ |title=55th annual Grammy Awards nominees |publisher=usatoday.com |date=January 16, 2011 |access-date=October 21, 2013}}</ref> In his review of ''Water'', the BBC's [[Kevin Le Gendre]] wrote that "Gregory Porter has a voice and musicality to be reckoned with."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/4qzb |title=Music – Review of Gregory Porter – Water |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=May 11, 2010 |access-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' described Porter as "a jazz singer of thrilling presence, a booming baritone with a gift for earthy refinement and soaring uplift" in its review of ''Liquid Spirit''.<ref>Chinen, Nate (September 6, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/arts/music/gregory-porter-mines-soulful-jazz-in-liquid-spirit.html?_r=0 E"voking Older Ideals and Earthly Realities: Gregory Porter Mines Soulful Jazz in 'Liquid Spirit'"], ''The New York Times''.</ref>

Michael G. Nastos of [[AllMusic]] wrote a mixed review of ''Water'', stating: "In hard bop trim, Shorter's 'Black Nile' has Porter shouting out a lyric line that was done many years ago by Chicago's Luba Raashiek, but Porter's voice is strained and breaks up. While on every track Porter sings with great conviction, he's more effective on lower-key compositions", but went on to say that "he's right up there with [[José James]] as the next big male vocal jazz star."<ref>{{cite web|title=Review of Gregory Porter's "Water"|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/water-mw0001977303|first=Michael G. |last=Nastos|website=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Porter is married to Victoria and they have two sons, Demyan and Lev. Their home is in [[Bakersfield, California]].

For public appearances, Porter always wears a hat reminiscent of a [[deerstalker]] incorporating fabric that covers his ears and chin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-31804542|title=Gregory Porter: Less about the hat, more about the heart|first=Natalie|last=Jamieson|date=March 11, 2015|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> In a 2012 interview with Jazzweekly.com, when asked: "What's with the weird and wonderful hat?" Porter replied: "I've had some surgery on my skin, so this has been my look for a little while and will continue to be for a while longer. People recognize me by it now. It is what it is." In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2016, he divulged that he received some facial scars when he was "seven or eight", but declined to go into the specifics of how they were sustained. He said: "I just saw it one day (the hat) and said 'I'm gonna put this on, I like it.' It was before the music career." The cap is a [[Kangol]] Summer Spitfire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/gregory-porter-why-wear-hat-balaclava-merry-christmas-baby-singer/|title=Why does Gregory Porter wear a hat?
