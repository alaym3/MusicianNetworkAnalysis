'''The Honeydrippers''' were a [[rock and roll]] band of the 1980s, deriving their name from [[Roosevelt Sykes]], an American blues singer also known as "Honeydripper". Former [[Led Zeppelin]] lead singer [[Robert Plant]] formed the group in 1981 to satisfy his long-time goal in having a rock band with a heavy [[rhythm and blues]] basis. Formed originally in Worcestershire, the band was also composed of fellow former Led Zeppelin member [[Jimmy Page]]; [[Jeff Beck]] (a former [[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]] member like Page); and other friends and well-known studio musicians including original [[Judas Priest]] guitarist Ernest Chataway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/first-priest-guitarist-chataway-dies|title=First Priest guitarist Chataway dies|last=Louder|first=Martin Kielty2014-05-14T10:30:00 133Z|website=Loudersound.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> The band released only one recording, an EP titled ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]'', on 12 November 1984.<ref>{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Huey |year=2011 |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-honeydrippers-mn0000075473/biography |title=The Honeydrippers: biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2 June 2015 }}</ref>
