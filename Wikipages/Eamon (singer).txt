'''Eamon Doyle''' (born September 19, 1983), better known by his mononym '''Eamon''', is an American singer and songwriter. He is mainly known for his 2003 hit single "[[Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)]]".

Some of the songs written by Eamon are in a style called ho-wop, which "blends the smoothness of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] with the grittiness of [[hip hop music|hip hop]]".{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} Eamon's songs are typically soft [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]] mixed with aggressive lyrics with the theme of infidelity.

==Early life==
Eamon was born in [[Staten Island]], New York City, the son of Diane ({{née}} Zizzo), an Italian American nurse, and Walter Doyle, a counselor with a private practice, of Irish descent.<ref name="MTV">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/e/eamon/news_feature_022404/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715032609/http://www.mtv.com/bands/e/eamon/news_feature_022404/|url-status=dead|title=Eamon: Ho-Wop Sinsation|archive-date=July 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Eamon-experiences-stardom-defends-55718.php |title=Eamon experiences stardom, defends profanity-laced songs |date=June 12, 2004 |publisher=newstimes.com |access-date=July 26, 2014}}</ref> His father was a member of a [[doo-wop]] group by the name of The Elations.

Blige]]. Dee and his co-producer Mark Passy helped refine Eamon's sound. After Nat Robinson shopped Eamon to over 22 different record labels Nat Robinson finally secured a record deal with record executive Barry Weiss and Eamon was eventually signed to [[Jive Records]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1485279/eamon-thanks-two-timing-girlfriend-for-controversial-hit-single/|title=Eamon Thanks Two-Timing Girlfriend For Controversial Hit Single|work=MTV News|access-date=October 4, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

==Musical career==
===''I Don't Want You Back'' (2003–2004)===
Eamon's debut single, "[[Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)]]" immediately caught the attention of urban, rhythmic, pop radio stations when it was released in the US in late 2003. Jive fast-tracked the release of a music video for the song and commissioned an album for release in early 2004. The single reached the top 20 of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and the popularity of the song helped his album, ''[[I Don't Want You Back]]'', debut in the top 10 of the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The success of the song prompted [[Jive Records|Jive]] to release the song internationally where it topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. In Italy, his single was such a big hit that he sang an Italian version called "Solo". The success of the single and the controversial nature of its lyrics prompted production of an [[answer song|answer single]], "[[F.U.R.B. (Fuck You Right Back)]]", by then-unknown female singer [[Frankee]] who had claimed to be Eamon's ex-girlfriend (which Eamon denied).<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Account |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/eamon.%20i%20have%20never%20dated%20frankee |title=Eamon – I have never dated Frankee |magazine=Contactmusic.com |date=May 10, 2004 |access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> The song also earned Eamon a [[Guinness World Record]] for "the most expletives in a No. 1 song".

After the success of "Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)", Eamon released a second single, "[[I Love Them Ho's (Ho-Wop)]]". The song did not match the success of its predecessor, although it was a Top 10 hit in Denmark, where it peaked at number seven on the [[Hitlisten|Danish Singles Chart]]. "I Love Them Ho's (Ho-Wop)" also had a remix and video featuring fellow Staten Island resident [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s [[Ghostface Killah]]. In return Eamon appeared on Ghostface's album ''[[More Fish]]''.

===''Love and Pain'' (2006)===
On September 15, 2006, Eamon released his first single from his upcoming second studio album, ''[[Love & Pain]]'', titled "[[(How Could You) Bring Him Home]]". ''Love & Pain'' was released on December 5, 2006. The album was produced by Happy Perez, Jeff Smith, and Milk Dee.

===Later projects and ''Golden Rail Motel'' (2007–present)===
After Jive records failed to properly market Eamon's second album, they mutually parted ways in 2008 with the stipulation that Eamon not sign another deal during the 18 months after the contract ended. In 2010, Eamon moved to Los Angeles, California to hone his craft as a songwriter and work with a fresh group of producers. In 2011, Eamon signed with SMC Entertainment, a publicly traded independent record label. Eamon signed a two-album deal worth $1,000,000 and began recording with Grammy winning producer [[Mikal Blue]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revolverrecordings.com/mikal-blue |title=Mikal Blue – Producer / Song Writer / Recording Artist |work=Revolver Recordings |year=2014 |access-date=July 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009193236/http://www.revolverrecordings.com/mikal-blue |archive-date=October 9, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ([[Colbie Caillat]], [[Jason Mraz]], [[OneRepublic]]). SMC was almost immediately delinquent on payments for musicians, studio costs, and advances. Eamon and Mikal Blue continued to record the album in spite of SMC not fulfilling their contractual obligation. Legal action was taken at the end of 2012 to resolve the issue. At that point, SMC financial backer David Levy was arrested for stock fraud. It gave Eamon more leverage in the litigation, but not enough to get him out of his contract. Levy was later sentenced to nine years in prison in 2013. The album was finished in September 2012, and Eamon was still under contract with SMC, but could not release any music or perform for money. He could, however, collaborate with other artists. Eamon joined forces with [[R.A. the Rugged Man]] on the rapper's 2013 album ''[[Legends Never Die (R.A. the Rugged Man album)|Legends Never Die]]''. Eamon is featured on two songs: "Luv to Fuk" and "Still Get Through the Day". A video for "Still Get Through the Day" came out on February 4, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL90ZmdjZrU |title=R.A. the Rugged Man – Still Get Through The Day ft. Eamon |publisher=YouTube |date=February 4, 2014 |access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> In May 2014, SMC settled with Eamon to release him from his 360-record deal. Most of the album he recorded with Mikal Blue could not be sold or even made public, but Eamon became a free agent.

In 2015, Eamon appeared on the [[Jedi Mind Tricks]]' album ''[[The Thief and the Fallen]]''. Again, he is featured on two songs: "Fraudulent Cloth" and "And God Said to Cain" (which also features A-F-R-O and [[R.A. the Rugged Man]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-thief-and-the-fallen/id982970642 |title=The Thief and the Fallen by Jedi Mind Tricks on Apple Music |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=June 2, 2015 |access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> A video for "Fraudulent Cloth" came out on May 27, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnXtY5_djjI |title=Jedi Mind Tricks "Fraudulent Cloth" feat. Eamon (Official Video) |publisher=YouTube |date=May 27, 2015 |access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref>

In 2016, he has appeared on a few more collaborations, including "The Void" on [[Vinnie Paz]]'s solo project ''Cornerstone of the Corner Store'', and "Use Them Blues" on the Afro & Marco Polo album ''A-F-R-O Polo''.

On April 7, 2017, Eamon released the video for "[[Be My Girl (Eamon song)|Be My Girl]]", the lead single from his upcoming album, ''[[Golden Rail Motel]]'', which was released on September 15, 2017. On June 15, 2017, Eamon released the second single, "[[Before I Die (Eamon song)|Before I Die]]", from the album. ''Golden Rail Motel'' was Eamon's first new album in over a decade and was produced by Eamon, [[Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind|Stoupe]] (Jedi Mind Tricks),<ref>{{Cite news|date=July 19, 2017|title=R'n'B singer Eamon to tackle his demons on Golden Rail Motel, his first material in over a decade|language=en-GB|work=Metro|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/19/rnb-singer-eamon-to-tackle-his-demons-on-golden-rail-motel-his-first-material-in-over-a-decade-6792253/|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> Dan Ubick ([[Connie Price and the Keystones]]), [[Snipe Young]], and [[Mikal Blue]]. On September 8, 2017, Eamon released the video for the third single "[[I Got Soul (Eamon song)|I Got Soul]]", which is a single-shot video directed by Doug Quill.

In August 2017, [[Vinnie Paz]] released the video for "The Ghost I Used to Be" featuring Eamon from Paz's solo album ''The Cornerstone of the Corner Store''.

In June 2019, Eamon announced via [[Instagram]] that he would be releasing a yet unnamed [[Extended play|EP]] and will be releasing a song from the EP every week. The singles "Runnin' Around" and "Step by Step" have been released thus far and received overall positive reception.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}
