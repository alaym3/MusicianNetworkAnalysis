He recorded 43 albums in his career, of which 15 have been gold certified<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=andy+williams#search_section |title= Gold & Platinum: Andy Williams|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |access-date=March 22, 2016}}</ref> and three platinum certified.<ref name="IMDb">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0930023/bio|title=Andy Williams (I) |website=Internet Movie Database|access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref> He was also nominated for six [[Grammy Awards]]. He hosted ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', a television variety show, from 1962 to 1971, along with numerous TV specials. ''The Andy Williams Show'' won three Emmy awards. The Moon River Theatre in [[Branson, Missouri]], is named after the song for which he is best known—[[Johnny Mercer]] and [[Henry Mancini]]'s "[[Moon River]]". He sold more than 45 million records worldwide, including more than 10 million certified units in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=top_tallies&ttt=TAA#search_section |title=Top Artist(Albums)|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |access-date=July 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name="theguardian ">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/26/andy-williams |title=Andy Williams obituary |work=The Guardian |date=September 26, 2012 |access-date=July 27, 2016 |first=Dave |last=Laing}}</ref>

Williams was active in the music industry for over 70 years until his death in 2012.

==Early life and education==
Williams was born in [[Wall Lake, Iowa]],<ref name="tv.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/andy-williams/person/978/biography.html |title=Andy Williams |website=TV.com |access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> to Florence (''[[née]]'' Finley) and Jay Emerson Williams, who worked in insurance and the post office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wral.tributes.com/obituary/print/86491487|title=Andy Williams - September 25, 2012 - Obituary - Tributes.com|website=Wral.tributes.com}}</ref> While living in [[Cheviot, Ohio]], Williams attended [[Western Hills High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Western Hills High School]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. He finished high school at [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]], in [[West Los Angeles]], because of his family's move to [[California]]. At 17, Williams joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] and served until the end of [[World War II]].<ref name="guardianobit">[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/26/andy-williams Andy Williams obituary; Popular crooner who sold more than 100m albums in a career that spanned eight decades] ''[[The Guardian]]''.

==Career==
===1938–1952: Early career===
Williams had three older brothers—[[Bob Williams (singer)|Bob]], [[Don Williams (singer)|Don]], and [[Dick Williams (singer)|Dick Williams]]. His first performance was in a children's choir at the local [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church.<ref name="tv.com"/>  His brothers and he formed [[the Williams Brothers]] quartet<ref name="tv.com"/> in late 1938, and they performed on radio in the [[Midwest]], first at [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], and later at [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in [[Chicago]], and [[WLW]] in Cincinnati.

Moving to Los Angeles in 1943, the Williams Brothers sang with [[Bing Crosby]] on his 1944 hit record "[[Swinging on a Star]]". They appeared in four musical films: ''[[Janie (1944 film)|Janie]]'' (1944), ''[[Kansas City Kitty]]'' (1944), ''[[Something in the Wind]]'' (1947), and ''[[Ladies' Man (1947 film)|Ladies' Man]]'' (1947).

A persistent myth alleges that as a teenager, the future singing star dubbed the singing for Lauren Bacall's character in the 1944 feature film ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''. According to authoritative sources, including [[Howard Hawks]] and Bacall herself, this was not true. Williams and some female singers were tested to dub for Bacall because of fears that she lacked the necessary vocal skills, but those fears were overshadowed by the desire to have Bacall do her own singing despite her imperfect vocal talent.<ref>McBride, Joseph. ''Hawks on Hawks''. Berkeley, University of California Press, 1982. p. 130.</ref> This myth is refuted in ''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'' in the entry for this film.

The Williams Brothers were signed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) to appear in ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' and ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1945), but before they went before the cameras the oldest brother, Bob, was drafted into military service and the group's contract was cancelled. [[Kay Thompson]], a former radio star who was now head of the vocal department at MGM, had a nose for talent and hired the remaining three Williams brothers to sing in her large choir on many soundtracks for MGM films, including ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (1946). When Bob completed his military service, Kay hired all four brothers to sing on the soundtrack to ''[[Good News (1947 film)|Good News]]'' (1947).

By then, Thompson was tired of working behind the scenes at MGM, so with the four Williams boys as her backup singers and dancers, she formed a nightclub act, Kay Thompson and the Williams Brothers. They made their debut in Las Vegas in 1947 and became an overnight sensation. Within a year, they were the highest-paid nightclub act in the world, breaking records wherever they appeared.

Williams revealed in his memoir ''Moon River and Me'' that  Thompson and he  became romantically involved while on tour despite the age difference (he was 19 and she was 38). The act broke up in 1949, but reunited for another hugely successful tour from the fall of 1951 through the summer of 1953. After that, the four brothers went their separate ways. A complete itinerary of both tours is listed on the Kay Thompson biography website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.KayThompsonWebsite.com/ |title=Kay Thompson Website |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref>

Williams and Thompson, however, remained very close, both personally and professionally. She mentored his emergence as a solo singing star. She coached him, wrote his arrangements, and composed many songs that he recorded, including his 1958 top-20 hit "[[Promise Me, Love]]", and later, "Kay Thompson's Jingle Bells" on his 1964 number-one ''[[The Andy Williams Christmas Album]]''. Using her contacts in the business, Thompson helped Williams land his breakthrough television gig as a featured singer for two and a half years on ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]''; it helped that the producer of the series, Bill Harbach, was Kay's former ''[[aide-de-camp]]''. Thompson also got Williams his breakthrough recording contract with [[Cadence Records]], whose owner, [[Archie Bleyer]], had gotten early career breaks because of Kay and owed her a favor. Meanwhile, Williams sang backup on many of Thompson's recordings through the 1950s, including her top-40 hit "Eloise", based on [[Eloise (books)|her bestselling books]] about the mischievous little girl who lives at the Plaza Hotel in New York.
[[File:Andy Williams 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Williams in a William Morris publicity photo, 1960]]
Thompson also served as a creative consultant and vocal arranger on Williams's three summer-replacement network television series in 1957, 1958, and 1959. In the summer of 1961, Thompson traveled with Williams and coached him throughout his starring role in a summer stock tour of the musical ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]''. Their personal and professional relationship finally ended in 1962, after Williams met and married [[Claudine Longet]], and Thompson moved to Rome.

===1953–1961: Cadence years===
Williams's solo career began in 1953.<ref name="tv.com"/> He recorded six sides for [[RCA Victor]]'s label "X", but none was a popular hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysticgames.com/famouspeople/AndyWilliams.htm |title=Andy Williams – Celebrity information |website=Mysticgames.com |access-date=April 30, 2012}}</ref>

After landing a spot as a regular on the ''Tonight Starring Steve Allen'' in 1954,<ref name="IMDb"/> Williams was signed to a recording contract with [[Cadence Records]], a small label in New York, run by conductor [[Archie Bleyer]]. Williams's third single, "[[Canadian Sunset]]", reached number seven in the top 10 in August 1956; it was followed in February 1957 by his only ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, [[Butterfly (1957 song)|"Butterfly"]], a [[Cover version|cover]] of a [[Charlie Gracie]] record. "Butterfly" was also number one for two weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in May 1957. More hit records followed, including "[[The Hawaiian Wedding Song]]" (US number 11), "[[Are You Sincere|Are You Sincere?]]" (US number three in February 1958), "[[The Village of St. Bernadette (song)|The Village of St. Bernadette]]" (US number seven in December 1959), "[[Lonely Street (song)|Lonely Street]]" (US number five in September 1959), and "[[I Like Your Kind of Love]]" with Peggy Powers (US number eight in May 1957).
[[File:Andy Williams headshot 1963.JPG|thumb|right|160px|Williams in 1963]]

===1962–1980: The Columbia years===
On December 15, 1961, Williams married Claudine Longet and signed with [[Columbia Records]]. His first album with Columbia, ''[[Danny Boy and Other Songs I Love to Sing]]'', was a chart success, peaking at number 19. He was then asked to sing "Moon River", the theme from ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', at the [[34th Academy Awards|1962 Academy Awards]], where it won Best Original Song.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McLellan|first1=Dennis|title=Andy Williams dies at 84|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/27/local/la-me-andy-williams-20120927|access-date=August 27, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 27, 2012}}</ref> Archie Bleyer at Cadence had previously told Williams that "Moon River" would not be a hit,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=Andy Williams: A Farewell Song for the "Moon River" Man|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/09/26/andy-williams-a-farewell-song-for-the-moon-river-man/|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 26, 2012|access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> but the Columbia producers encouraged Andy to record the song along with 11 other movie themes for an album. After Williams performed the song at the awards show, it became a hit. ''[[Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes]]'' then sold across the country, garnering critical acclaim and propelling Williams into stardom. The album remained on the charts for the next three years and peaked at number three. In 1963, Williams's producer, [[Robert Mersey]], encouraged him to record "[[Can't Get Used to Losing You]]" as the B-side to "[[Days of Wine and Roses (song)|Days of Wine and Roses]]". Williams initially did not like the pop song, preferring the Mancini tune, but "Can't Get Used to Losing You" reached number two in the US and UK.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Halberstadt|first1=Alex|title=Lonely Avenue: The Unlikely Life and Times of Doc Pomus|date=April 1, 2009|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780306815645|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uJeRbcbekEC&q=williams+hated+can%27t+get+used+to+losing+you&pg=PT120|access-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref> The album containing both songs, ''[[Days of Wine and Roses and Other TV Requests]]'', topped the album charts at number one for 16 weeks.

From 1962 to 1972, Williams was one of the most popular vocalists in the country, and was signed to what was at that time the biggest recording contract in history.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Andy |title=Moon River and Me: A Memoir |date=October 13, 2009 |publisher=Viking Adult |isbn=978-0-670-02117-8 }}</ref> He was primarily an album artist, and at one time, he had recorded more gold albums than any solo performer except [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Johnny Mathis]], and [[Elvis Presley]]. By 1973, he had earned as many as 17 gold-album awards. Among his hit albums from this period were ''The Andy Williams Christmas Album'', ''Dear Heart'', ''The Shadow of Your Smile'', ''Love, Andy'', ''Happy Heart'', ''Get Together with Andy Williams'', ''Love Story'', and ''Love Theme from the Godfather''. These recordings, along with his natural affinity for the music of the 1960s and early 1970s, combined to make him one of the premier easy-listening singers of that era.
[[File:Andy williams 1969.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Williams in 1969 on ''The Andy Williams Show'']]
In the UK, Williams continued to reach high chart status until 1978. The albums ''Dear Heart'' (1965), ''Love Andy'' (1967), ''Can't Help Falling in Love'' (1970), ''Andy Williams Show'' (1970), ''Home Lovin' Man'' (number one, 1971), ''Solitaire'' (1973), ''The Way We Were'' (1974), and ''Reflections'' (1978) all reached the top 10.

Williams forged an indirect collaborative relationship with [[Henry Mancini]], although they never recorded together. Both "Moon River" and "Days of Wine and Roses" were written by Mancini, with lyrics by [[Johnny Mercer]]. Williams sang Mancini's "[[Dear Heart (song)|Dear Heart]]" at the 1965 Academy Awards and "[[The Great Race#Soundtrack|The Sweetheart Tree]]" (also written with Mercer) at the 1966 Awards.

On August 5, 1966, the 14-story, 700-room [[Caesars Palace]] casino and nightclub opened in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], with the stage production of "Rome Swings", in which Williams starred. He performed to a sold-out crowd in the Circus Maximus showroom. He headlined for Caesars for the next 20 years.

On September 17, 1968, Columbia released a single of two songs Williams sang at the funeral of his close friend [[Robert F. Kennedy]]: "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" and [[Franz Schubert]]'s "[[Ave Maria (musical settings)|Ave Maria]]". These were never released on a [[LP album|long-playing record]], but have appeared in several compilations of Williams's output.

Williams also competed in the teen-oriented singles market and had several charting hits, including "[[Can't Get Used to Losing You]]", "[[Happy Heart]]", and [[(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story|"Where Do I Begin"]], the theme song from the 1970 blockbuster film ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. In addition, Williams hit the top 10 of the [[UK Singles Chart]] with "[[Almost There (Andy Williams song)|Almost There]]" (1964), "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]" (1970), "[[Home Lovin' Man]]" (1970), and "Solitaire" (1973).

Williams and [[Petula Clark]] recorded "[[Happy Heart]]" around the same time, just before his guest appearance on her second NBC-TV special. Unaware that she was releasing the song as a single, he asked to perform it on the show. The exposure ultimately led to his having the bigger hit with the song. The song "Happy Heart" was used for the final scene and end credits of [[Danny Boyle]]'s award-winning [[directorial debut]] film ''[[Shallow Grave]]'' (1994).

===1962–1971: ''The Andy Williams Show''===
Building on his experience with Allen and some short-term variety shows in the 1950s, he became the star of his own weekly television variety show in the fall of 1962. Though cancelled after 1963 owing to low ratings, the show was then sponsored to make 12 weekly specials in the 1963–64 season. This series, ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', won three [[Emmy Awards]] for outstanding variety program. Among his series regulars were the [[The Osmonds|Osmond Brothers]]. He gave up the variety show in 1971 while it was still popular, continuing with three specials per year. His Christmas specials, which appeared regularly until 1974 and intermittently from 1982 into the 1990s, were among the most popular of the genre.<ref name="DMReg-2009"/> Williams recorded eight Christmas albums over the years, and was known as "Mr. Christmas",<ref name="DMReg-2009">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/09/26/final-register-interview-iowas-own-andy-williams-is-mr-christmas-to-the-nation/|title=Iowa's own Andy Williams is "Mr. Christmas" to the nation|last=Munson|first=Kyle|date=December 25, 2009|work=Des Moines Register|publisher=reprinted in Register blog September 26, 2012|access-date=September 26, 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> due to his perennial Christmas specials and the success of "[[It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year]]".
[[File:Osmond Brothers Andy Williams 1964.JPG|thumb|180px|right|Williams with the Osmond Brothers on ''The Andy Williams Show'', 1964]]
Williams hosted the most [[Grammy]] telecasts—seven consecutive shows—from the [[13th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 1971 through to the [[19th Annual Grammy Awards|19th Awards]] in 1977. He returned to television with a syndicated half-hour series in 1976–77.

In the early 1970s, when the [[Nixon administration]] attempted to deport [[John Lennon]], Williams was an outspoken defender of the former [[The Beatles|Beatle]]'s right to stay in the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Williams is included in the montage of caricatures on the cover of [[Ringo Starr]]'s 1973 album, ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]''.

Williams performed during the [[halftime show]] of [[Super Bowl VII]] in January 1973, held at [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16844013/colorful_halftime_for_super_bowl_vii/ |title=Colorful Halftime For Super Bowl VII |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |location=[[Nashville, Tennessee]] |date=January 15, 1973 |access-date=January 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny-1Q6qxn-A |title=Super Bowl VII Halftime in 1973 featuring Andy Williams! |access-date=January 25, 2018 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

===1991–2012: At Moon River Theatre===
[[File:Awamrt.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Williams at the Moon River Theatre in Branson, Missouri, 2006]]
In June 1991, Williams' brother Don invited him to the small [[The Ozarks|Ozarks]] town of [[Branson, Missouri]]. Don Williams at the time was the manager for entertainer [[Ray Stevens]], who had just opened a theater in Branson. While attending Stevens' show, Williams was encouraged by numerous Branson guests to open a venue in the town.<ref name="kroll">{{cite web| url=http://www.krolltravel.com/stories/Branson-Andy-Williams.html |first= Barb & Ron |last= Kroll |title=Andy Williams Moon River Theatre in Branson Missouri |work=krolltravel.com |access-date=April 22, 2012}}</ref> This led Williams to build his own theater in Branson in time for the 1992 season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0008/22/lkl.00.html |title=CNN Transcript – Larry King Live: Andy Williams Discusses His Return to Singing – August 22, 2000 |website=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=August 22, 2000 |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref> eventually opening on May 1, 1992, as the Moon River Theatre.<ref name=SWHoF>{{cite web| title=Andy Williams Biography| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408111515/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/artist_bio.asp?artistId=108 |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/artist_bio.asp?artistId=108| archive-date=April 8, 2008| work= songwritershalloffame.org}}</ref> The name came from his signature song. It went on to become the first theater ever to be featured in ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', and also won the 1992 Conservation Award from the State of [[Missouri]].<ref name=SWHoF />

The theater was designed to blend with the rough terrain of the [[Ozark Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy Williams Moon River Theater in Branson, MO|url=https://www.bransonshows.com/pointsOfInterest/AndyWilliamsMoonRiverTheaterinBransonMO.html|website=Vacations Made Easy|access-date=January 30, 2018}}</ref> He had originally planned a marble style theater reminiscent of the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] in Los Angeles, but soon had a change of mind. The Larson Company of Tucson, Arizona, fabricated a section of rock on Missouri's Highway 76 and the theater was soon engulfed with waterfalls, [[koi]]-filled ponds, ferns and trees native to the Ozarks. The inside of the theater incorporates the outside. Trees and plants are seen throughout the theater's three lobbies. Oak floors are accompanied by African ribbon-striped mahogany walls that are filled with pictures of the ''Andy Williams Show''. Williams' passion for art can be seen throughout as well. From the start of his career, Williams had accumulated several paintings and sculptures and decided to fill his theater with his collection. [[Helen Frankenthaler|Frankenthaler]], [[Richard Diebenkorn|Diebenkorn]], [[Claes Oldenburg|Oldenburg]], [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]], [[Paul Klee|Klee]], and [[Henry Moore|Moore]] are a small list of artists whose work is on display at the Moon River Theatre.<ref name=SWHoF />

The theater's auditorium can accommodate 2,054 people. The seating is stadium-style for the best view. The seats and carpets match Williams' [[Navajo rug]] collection and are forest green, magenta, gold, and blue. On display inside the auditorium are 19 Japanese [[kimono]]s. The stage has accommodated numerous shows and guest celebrities. On stage, Williams was joined by [[Glen Campbell]], [[Ann-Margret]], Petula Clark, and [[Charo]]. The theater has also played host to [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Pat Boone]], the [[Osmond Family]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Rich Little]], [[Shari Lewis]] &and [[Lamb Chop (puppet)|Lamb Chop]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Pat Benatar]], and [[Broadway on Ice]] starring [[Nancy Kerrigan]], [[Tara Lipinski]], and [[Rudy Galindo]].

When it first opened, it was unique because his was the first noncountry act to open in the then mostly country-music town. It was said he was discouraged by many back home in California from making such a bold move, but that was what he wanted. Other noncountry entertainers, such as [[Bobby Vinton]], [[Tony Orlando]], [[Wayne Newton]], and the Osmond Brothers soon followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0008/22/lkl.00.html |title=CNN Transcript – Larry King Live: Andy Williams Discusses His Return to Singing |website=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=August 22, 2000 |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref>

Williams and his theater were featured on three episodes of the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'' in July 2007, when several characters went to Branson for a concert of "[[Gwen Munson]]" held in the Moon River Theatre. ''[[The Simpsons]]'' featured Williams at his Moon River Theatre in an episode titled "[[Bart on the Road]]". [[Nelson Muntz]] is an Andy Williams fan, and in the episode, he forces the gang to make a detour to Branson so he could see his idol. He is reduced to tears as Williams performs "Moon River" during the second encore.

In 2007, Williams opened the Moon River Grill adjacent to his theater in Branson. The restaurant is decorated in photos from the ''Andy Williams Show'' with stars including [[Diana Ross]], [[Elton John]], and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] Art is center stage in the restaurant, with works by several artists including [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Robert Indiana]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Andy Williams Moon River Theatre |url=http://www.andywilliams.com/andy_williams_branson_016.htm |website=AndyWilliams.com |access-date=August 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825225507/http://www.andywilliams.com/andy_williams_branson_016.htm |archive-date=August 25, 2010}}</ref>

In 1995, ''[[We Need a Little Christmas (Andy Williams album)|We Need a Little Christmas]]'' became Williams's 18th gold album.

His 1967 recording of "[[Music to Watch Girls By]]" became a big UK hit to a new young television audience in 1999, when it reached number 9 after being featured in new television advertisements for the [[Fiat Punto]]—and later for [[Diet Pepsi]]—beating the original peak of number 33 in 1967. A new generation was reminded of Williams' recordings, and a sell-out UK tour followed the success of the single, prompting a British revival for Williams.  In 2002, he re-recorded "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" as a duet with British actress and singer [[Denise van Outen]]; it reached number 23 in the UK singles charts. He completed a sold-out tour of the United Kingdom and Asia in the winter and summer of 2007, in which he performed at several major concert halls including [[Royal Albert Hall]], singing, among other classics, [[Van Morrison]]'s "[[Have I Told You Lately]]".

Williams returned to the UK singles charts with his 1963 recording of "[[It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year]]" in December 2007, thanks to an advertisement for [[Marks & Spencer]], reaching number 21 in its first appearance in the British charts, also reaching number 108 on the EU top 200. In 2008, he lip-synched the 45-year-old recording to welcome Santa at the end of the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].

On October 3, 2009, Williams appeared live on the BBC's ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''<ref>{{cite web |title = Strictly Come Dancing TV Appearance |url=http://www.sonymusic.co.uk/news/14754/0/ |publisher= Sony Music |access-date=October 3, 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091003050513/http://www.sonymusic.co.uk/news/14754/0/| archive-date= October 3, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> in London, singing "Moon River" to promote the UK edition of ''The Very Best of Andy Williams'' LP, which peaked at number 10 in the main pop chart.

[[File:Andy williams everly brothers netherlands 1959.jpg|right|thumb|180px|On tour in 1959 for Cadence Records, Williams (right) with the [[Everly Brothers]] and the [[Chordettes]] in the Netherlands]]
In 1964, Williams ultimately became the owner of the Cadence master tapes, which he occasionally licensed to Columbia, including not only his own recordings, but also those of his fellow Cadence-era labelmates: [[the Everly Brothers]], [[Lenny Welch]], [[the Chordettes]], and [[Johnny Tillotson]]. In 1968, although he was still under contract with Columbia for his own recordings, Williams formed a separate company called [[Barnaby Records]] to handle reissuing of the Cadence material, especially that of the Everly Brothers (one of the first Barnaby LPs was a double LP set of the Brothers' long out-of-print Cadence hits) and new artists. Barnaby also had several top-40 hits in the 1970s with novelty artist Ray Stevens (who had done a summer replacement show for Williams in 1970), including number-one hits such as "[[Everything Is Beautiful]]" in 1970 and "[[The Streak (song)|The Streak]]" in 1974.

Also in 1970, Barnaby signed and released the first album by an unknown singer-songwriter named [[Jimmy Buffett]] (''[[Down to Earth (Jimmy Buffett album)|Down to Earth]]'') produced by Travis Turk. Columbia was initially the distributor for Barnaby, but later distribution was handled first by [[MGM Records]] and then [[General Recorded Tape]]. Once Barnaby ceased operating as a working record company at the end of the 1970s, Williams licensed the old Cadence material to various other labels (such as [[Varèse Sarabande]] and [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]] in the U.S.) after 1980.

==Politics==
Williams was close friends with Robert F. Kennedy and his wife, [[Ethel Kennedy]], and campaigned for Kennedy in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Democratic presidential primary races]].  Williams was among the celebrities who were in Kennedy's entourage in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles when Kennedy was shot and mortally wounded by [[Sirhan Sirhan]] in June 1968.<ref name="LAT-obit">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-andy-williams-20120927,0,2768780,full.story|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927040826/http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-andy-williams-20120927,0,2768780,full.story|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 27, 2012|title=Andy Williams, 'Moon River' singer, dies at 84| last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=September 27, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 22, 2012}}</ref> Williams sang "Battle Hymn of the Republic" at RFK's funeral, at Ethel's request. In August 1969, Williams and Claudine Longet named their newborn son, Bobby, after Kennedy.
