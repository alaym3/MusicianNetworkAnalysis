'''Merhavia''' ({{lang-he|מֶרְחַבְיָה}}, ''lit.'' Broad Place – God) is a [[kibbutz]] in northern [[Israel]]. Located to the east of [[Afula]], it falls under the jurisdiction of [[Jezreel Valley Regional Council]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Merhavya(qibbuz)}}.{{Israel populations|reference}}

==Etymology==
The name Merhavia is derived from the Book of [[Psalms]] ({{bibleref2|Ps. 118:5}});
<blockquote>Out of my distress I called on the Lord; the Lord answered me and set me in a '''broad place'''. ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]])</blockquote> In the metaphorical sense: "God set me free" - the experience of the Jews immigrating to the [[Land of Israel]] and achieving a new homeland without the straits, or distress, of persecution.

==History==
===Bronze Age===
According to the [[Survey of Western Palestine]] (SWP, 1882), it was possibly the place called ''Alpha'' in the list of [[Thutmes III]].<ref name=SWP82>Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp02conduoft#page/82/mode/1up 82]</ref>

===Crusader-Ayyubid period===
In the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader period]] it was known as '''''la Feve''''' or ''Castrum Fabe''. It had a [[Templar]] castle (first mentioned in 1169/72), of which just some mounds remain.<ref>Rey, 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/lescoloniesfran00reygoog#page/n466/mode/1up 439]</ref><ref>Pringle, 1997, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-_NbE5obqRMC&pg=PA49 49]</ref> The area was under Crusader control between 1099 and 1187.<ref name=Pringle207>Pringle, 1993, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BgQ6AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA207 207]</ref> 
In 1183 the [[Battle of Al-Fule]] took place here, between the Crusaders and the forces of [[Saladin]]. An aerial photograph taken in 1918 by the German air force is still showing the clear outline of La Fève castle and moat, directly adjacent to the kibbutz courtyard east of it; the castle remains have all but disappeared by now under new houses and lawns.<ref name=Changing>{{cite book |last= Kedar |first= Benjamin Z. |author-link= Benjamin Z.

In 1226, [[Syria]]n geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] mentioned it as being "a town in [[Jund Filastin]]," and formerly a [[Crusaders|Crusader]] castle between [[Zir'in]] and [[Nazareth]].<ref>le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/441/mode/1up 441]</ref> The area was again under Crusader control between 1240/1 and 1263.<ref name=Pringle207/>

===Ottoman period===
According to [[Denys Pringle]], al-Fula, the Arab village, seems to have existed until the end of the sixteenth century.<ref name=Pringle207/>

In 1799, during [[Napoleon]]'s [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|Syrian campaign]], the [[Battle of Mount Tabor (1799)|Battle of Mount Tabor]] was fought around Al-Fuleh.<ref name=Guerin110>Guérin, 1880, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr01unkngoog#page/n123/mode/1up 110]-111</ref>

In 1816, [[James Silk Buckingham]] described ''Fooli'' as a village. He observed there the remains of a large building, which he presumed was "[[Saracen]]". By the [[water well]]s he found two covers for [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], one was ornamented with sculptures. There were several other settlements in sight, all populated by Muslims.<ref>Buckingham, 1822, vol 2,  p. [https://archive.org/stream/travelsinpalest04buckgoog#page/n397/mode/1up 381]</ref>

In 1838, [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] described both Al-Fuleh and the adjacent Afuleh as "deserted".<ref>Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/n180/mode/1up 163], [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/n198/mode/1up 181]</ref>

In 1859 Al-Fuleh had 64 inhabitants, and the tillage was 14 [[feddans]], according to the English consul Rogers.<ref name=SWP82/> [[William McClure Thomson]], in a book published the same year, noted that both El Fuleh and the adjacent Afuleh, were "both now deserted, though both were inhabited twenty-five years ago when I first passed this way." Thomson blamed their desertion on the [[bedouin]].<ref>Thomson, 1859, vol 2, p. [https://archive.org/stream/landandbookorbi08thomgoog#page/n228/mode/1up 216]</ref>

In 1875 [[Victor Guérin]] noted the remains of multicoloured [[mosaic]]s by ''Bir Fouleh''. At this time, Al-Fuleh was the home of 15 Arab families.<ref name=Guerin110/>

According to Palmer (1881), the place was earlier named in Arabic '''al-Fuleh''' ("The beans"),<ref>Palmer, 1881, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp00conduoft#page/161/mode/1up 161]</ref> also rendered as '''El Fuleh''', '''al-Fula''' etc. In 1882, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]]'s [[PEF Survey of Palestine|''Survey of Western Palestine'' (SWP)]] described Al-Fuleh as a small [[adobe]] village, "with a few stone houses in the middle. It stands on a swell of ground, and is surrounded by corn land, and has marshy ground to the north. The water supply is from [[well]]s west of the village. Round the site are remains of the ancient Crusader fosse."<ref name=SWP82/> The Survey noted a ruined church about 200 meters SSE of the castle,<ref>Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP II, p.[https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp02conduoft#page/101/mode/1up 101]. Note typo: Afuleh for Fule</ref> which probably was the remains of the Crusader parish church.<ref name=Pringle207/> However, these remains were destroyed in 1939-1940.<ref name=Pringle207/>

A population list from about 1887 showed that  ''Fuleh'' had about 300 inhabitants; all Muslims.<ref>Schumacher, 1888, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme19pale#page/n208/mode/1up 183]</ref>

In 1910-11, [[Sursock family|Elias Sursock]] of Lebanon sold 10,000 dunums around the village of al-Fula,<ref name="Ben-Bassat" >Ben-Bassat,Yuval, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23471075'Rural Reactions to Zionist Activity in Palestine before and after the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 as Reflected in Petitions to Istanbul,'][[Middle Eastern Studies]], May 2013,volume =49,3, pp=349-363, pp.355-356</ref> to the Jewish National Fund, part of the [[Sursock Purchases]]. The Palestinian peasants refused to leave the land and the ''[[kaymakam|qaimaqam]]'' (district governor) of [[Nazareth]], [[Shukri al-Asali]] fought to overturn the sale, and refused to finalize the transaction.<ref name="Ben-Bassat" />  The villagers themselves sent a petition to the [[grand vizier]] complaining of the oppressive use of arbitrary power (''tahakkum''). In particular they claimed that Ilyas Sursuk and a middleman had sold their land to people, whom they called 'Zionists' and 'sons of the religion of Moses,' (''siyonist musevi'') who were not Ottoman subjects, and that the sale would deprive 1,000 villagers of their livelihoods.<ref name="Ben-Bassat" />
===British Mandate: Kibbutz Merhavia===
[[Moshav]] [[Merhavia (moshav)|Merhavia]] was established in 1911, under Ottoman rule. The kibbutz was established in 1929 adjacent to the moshav, from which it took its name. The founders of the kibbutz were members of [[Hashomer Hatzair]] who had [[aliyah|immigrated]] from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] after [[World War I]] and had been living in [[Haifa]], including [[Eliezer Peri]], who later represented [[Mapam]] in the [[Knesset]].
