{{Quote|text="Dear Vaulters, it is with a heavy heart we post this today, but after much discussion we have decided to go our separate ways. The last few years have been equally amazing and very challenging, both on personal and professional levels. After caught in still was released we took some much needed time off, but when we discussed how we might go forward it became clear that the spark you need to make a band work had gone. We leave on good terms, with some amazing memories and feeling very proud of the record we put out. Thanks from the bottom of our hearts to everyone that ever came to a gig, caught us at a festival, or bought a record, and everyone from management to label to live team that's ever worked with us. It's meant the world to us. Much love BB&B x" |author=Vaults }} Pepino now performs with the band Mesadorm (originally founded in 2015), who released debut album, ''Heterogaster'', on 11 May 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.babylegsrecords.com/mesadorm/|title=Mesadorm|website=Babylegs Records|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518195922/https://www.babylegsrecords.com/mesadorm/|archive-date=2018-05-18|url-status=live}}</ref> while Ben Vella formed the band Child of the Parish, with his brother Tom and the artist Pius Bak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amU5mHqXzZo|title=Child of the Parish - Thread The Needles Eye (Official Audio)|access-date=24 October 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>
