'''He-Man''' is a superhero and the main character of the [[sword and sorcery]] ''[[Masters of the Universe]]'' franchise, which includes a toy line, several animated television series, comic books and a feature film. He-Man is characterized by his superhuman strength and in most variations, is the [[alter ego]] of '''Prince Adam'''. He-Man and his friends attempt to defend the realm of [[Eternia]] and the secrets of [[Castle Grayskull]] from the evil forces of [[Skeletor]].

The character was created by designer [[Roger Sweet]], who intentionally created the character in such a way for him to be abstract and generic enough to be applied into any context and genre; Sweet also chose the name He-Man for being generic. Presenting three different versions of the figure to Mattel—including a [[soldier]] and a [[Extraterrestrial life in fiction|spaceman]]—the [[barbarian]] version of the character was chosen and developed into the character's current form.

He-Man has been singled out for the [[homoeroticism]] and gay subtext surrounding his character. Many critics have taken note of his [[queer coding|queer-coded]] nature and perceived [[homosexuality]], especially in his relationships with other male characters; particularly with Skeletor. Furthermore, since his creation He-Man has achieved [[gay icon]] status and amassed an LGBT following—specifically amongst [[gay men]]. Moreover, the character has been noted for his [[sexual attraction|sex appeal]] towards gay men. The queer reading of He-Man's character and his relationship with Skeletor has also been utilized in advertisement and for charity. According to various insiders and employees, [[Mattel]] is aware of He-Man's gay icon status and following, and his perception as a gay man; something which the company is receptive to.

==Development==
===Origin===
In 1976, [[Mattel]]'s CEO Ray Wagner declined a deal to produce a [[toyline]] of [[action figure]]s based on the characters from ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', due to the $750,000 license ($3,645,724.96 in 2021 dollars) required up front.<ref name=popmatters>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/mastering-the-universe-2496243511.html|title=Mastering the Universe: He-Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion-Dollar Idea by Roger Sweet and David Wecker|date=September 25, 2005|access-date=October 15, 2020|work=[[Pop Matters]] |last=Levisohn |first=Benjamin}}</ref><ref name="sneeze">{{cite web|url=https://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000500.php|title=The Birth of He-Man|date=April 18, 2006|access-date=October 15, 2020|work=[[The Sneeze (blog)]]}}</ref> Following the commercial success of the [[Star Wars trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]] and its related merchandise, Mattel launched several successful competing toylines which captured the public's imagination and significantly influenced the toy market.<ref name=popmatters/> In the race to design the next popular action figure, [[Roger Sweet]]—a lead designer for Mattel's Preliminary Design Department—realized that simplicity was the key to success.<ref name="popmatters"/><ref name="sneeze"/> According to his 2005 book ''[[Mastering the Universe|Mastering the Universe: He-Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion-Dollar Idea]]'', Sweet knew that if he gave the marketing department something it could sell, he had won 90 percent of the battle.<ref name=popmatters/><ref>Sweet, Roger; David, Wecker ''Mastering the Universe : He-Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion-Dollar Idea'', Emmis Books July 11, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57860-223-8}}</ref> Sweet stated that "to sell this [to Wagner]", he glued a [[Big Jim (toy line)|Big Jim]] figure—another Mattel toy line—into a battle action pose, added clay to its body, and had plaster casts made. These three prototypes, would later go on to become He-Man. Furthermore, to sell this toy, Sweet stated that as a powerful figure, it could be applied into any context because the character had the generic name of He-Man.<ref name="popmatters"/><ref name="sneeze"/>

Originally, He-Man was presented to Mattel executives not as drawings and wax models, but in the form of the He-Man Trio: three figures of three-dimensional prototype models depicting He-Man as a [[barbarian]], a [[soldier]] and a [[Extraterrestrial life in fiction|spaceman]]. Out of the three concepts, the barbarian version was chosen to be the basis for the toyline.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smallwood |first1=Karl |title=He-Man Was Almost a Spaceman |url=http://www.factfiend.com/man-almost-spaceman/ |website=FactFiend |access-date=October 27, 2021 |date=August 4, 2016}}</ref> Considering that the Conan character was created almost 50 years before the development of the He-Man franchise, it is possible that the Masters of the Universe borrowed many aspects from Conan; however, it was not intended to be a toyline for the film after legal agreements were dissolved.<ref name="conan"/> Additionally, Roger Sweet has also claimed that he was "really impressed" by the paintings of fantasy artist [[Frank Frazetta]] when creating He-Man.<ref name="sneeze"/> Expanding further on the barbarian theme, Mattel hired comic-book writers and artists such as [[Donald F. Glut]] and even [[Earl Norem]] and [[Alfredo Alcala]] (who were both still working on the ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' comics since the mid-1970s) to create additional characters (along with their back stories), posters, package inlays, box art and mini-comics for distribution with the action figures. According to Roger Sweet:

{{bquote|Of the three original He-Man Trio prototype models, the barbarian themed He-Man was black haired with a deeply tanned [[Eastern Europe]]an or [[Middle East]]ern appearance. His helmet had no horns. Later, at the direction of Tom Kalinske, then in Mattel's upper management, He-Man was made more clean-cut and changed to a blond... Plus, He-Man's skin was lightened, though definitely still tanned.<ref name="popmatters"/><ref name=sneeze/>}}

According to toy designer Mark Taylor, He-Man original design was inspired by [[Cro-Magnon]] men and [[Vikings]].<ref name="Youtube">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUq5x0SfxsI|title=Toy Designer Mark Taylor On The Creation of He-Man|date=30 September 2015|publisher=RealistikkVideos|access-date=October 15, 2020|via=YouTube}}</ref>

===Conan controversy===
During the 1980s, rumors claimed that [[Conan the Barbarian]] was a source of inspiration for He-Man.<ref>Interview with Roger Sweet (September 2005), ''[[ToyFare]]'', via [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/conan.htm "Conan"] at An International Catalogue of Superheroes</ref> According to this rumor, Mattel had a licensing agreement to make action figures associated with the [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|1982 film of the same name]] starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], but modified the figures to avoid objections from parents concerned that a toyline for children was promoting a film containing [[nudity]] and brutal, graphic [[violence]].

Sweet has refuted the rumor, saying that he conceptualized and developed the character and franchise in late 1980—before the release of the [[Universal Pictures]] film—beginning production in 1981 and marketing in 1982. At that time, Mattel did not have a license with Universal to make toys for the film, which resulted in [[Conan Properties International]] suing Mattel over copyright infringement, due to He-Man's similarities to Conan.<ref name="conan">{{cite web|url=http://www.conan.com/invboard/index.php?showtopic=8696|title=Conan The He-Man - The REH Forum|access-date=May 5, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928133104/http://www.conan.com/invboard/index.php?showtopic=8696|archive-date=2011-09-28}}</ref> Mattel won the lawsuit against Conan Properties, retaining the rights over He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.<ref name="conan"/>

===Portrayers===
In the Filmation series ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' as well as in ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'', He-Man and Prince Adam were voiced by [[John Erwin]]. Erwin alternated between two distinct deliveries, though in the show's intro he spoke with his He-Man voice as both characters. According to executive producer [[Lou Scheimer]], Erwin did not think his own voice was heroic enough which is why a reverb was added to it in sound-editing. After retiring from professional voice-work, Erwin has not done official publicity appearances due to his shy nature. He-Man also appeared in a [[Streets (ice cream)|Streets]] commercial advertising branded ice cream of the franchise in Australia with Australian actor Paul Johnstone (best known for his role in ''[[Mad Max]]'') voicing him.

In the 1987 live-action feature film, He-Man was played by [[Dolph Lundgren]]. He never transforms into Prince Adam but does deliver the franchise catchphrase "I have the power" late in the film. [[Garry Chalk (actor)|Garry Chalk]] provided the voice of He-Man for the 1990 series ''The New Adventures of He-Man'' while Prince Adam was voiced by [[Doug Parker (voice actor)|Doug Parker]]. Chalk voiced Man-at-Arms in the 2002 series. In the 2002 series, both characters were voiced by [[Cam Clarke]].

He-Man will appear in the upcoming live action film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thathashtagshow.com/2018/05/masters-of-the-universe/|title=EXCLUSIVE: He-Man: Masters of the Universe Character Breakdowns Revealed|author=Murphy, Charles|date=May 1, 2018|work=That Hastag Show|access-date=October 15, 2020}}</ref> [[Mike O'Hearn]] expressed a desire to play the character, though he denied rumors that he had been cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/2015/11/12/mike-ohearn-has-not-been-cast-as-he-man-but-wants-the-role|title=Mike O'Hearn Has Not Been Cast As He-Man, But Wants The Role|author=Russ Burlingame|date=November 12, 2015|work=Comicbook.com|access-date=October 15, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/94l9_hqyHu/|title=My Goal: Take off 30 pounds of lean muscle and get a whole new physique so I'll be ready to get the movie #HeMan!!|date=November 9, 2015|work=Instagram|author=mikeohearn|access-date=October 15, 2020}}</ref>  [[Noah Centineo]] confirmed on April 29, 2019 that he will be playing He-Man in the upcoming ''Masters of the Universe'' live action reboot film.<ref name=et/>

===Powers and abilities===
He-Man possesses super speed, indestructible skin, and [[superhuman strength]], having been able to hoist Castle Grayskull and throw it through an interdimensional portal, as well as lift mountains and icebergs and hurl them toward a desired target. In the episode "She-Demon of Phantos", he was the only person to break Photanium; claimed by Man-At-Arms to be the strongest metal in the universe. On the original action figure's packaging and in the introductory sequence of the 1980s cartoon series, He-Man is claimed to be "the most powerful man in the universe". In the original series episode "Eternal Darkness",<ref>"Eternal Darkness"</ref> He-Man was shown pushing a moon of Eternia into a specific orbit, and then later returning it to its original position by hand.<ref>{{cite news|author=Kit, Borys|title=Scribes take on "Masters of the Universe"|work=[[Reuters]]|date=April 12, 2010|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63B2IK20100412|access-date=October 15, 2020}}</ref>

While Adam can remain as He-Man for as long as he wants, if he takes too much damage or uses too much raw force, he will revert to his original form. In the 2002 series, He-Man endures the brunt of at least two large explosions, which he survives, but reverts to Adam in the process, suggesting that He-Man has a limit to how much abuse he can endure before his strength and stamina are exhausted. He-Man is depicted as being extremely quick and [[acrobatics|acrobatic]], managing to outrun massive explosions and moving his arms fast enough to counteract the winds of a tornado, or leaping great heights and landing safely on his feet. It is also suggested that He-Man possesses [[Telepathy|telepathic]] powers as well, as in the original series He-Man is able to communicate and sense the presence of the Sorceress by telepathy, or communicate with his sister [[She-Ra]] across great distances. 

He-Man as a character is largely non-violent, only resorting to combat as a last resort.<ref name="google7055"/> He used his intellect more often, preferring to outsmart his adversaries; most violent actions typically consisted of [[Throw (grappling)|body-throws]]. In accordance with broadcast standards of the period, in the Filmation cartoon, He-Man could not use his sword as an offensive weapon or punch or kick anyone. He was only allowed to destroy robotic enemies. The 1987 film and 2002 series, however, showed him fighting more aggressively.

He-Man's primary weapon was his sword, which is apparently indestructible, could deflect bolts of energy. The sword gave him the ability to transform from Prince Adam into He-Man by utilizing the powers of Castle Grayskull, also uses it to transform Cringer into Battle Cat. In the first four minicomics He-Man's primary weapon was an axe, because the sword was intended to serve as a plot device that would only be used in order to gain entry into Castle Grayskull. The breastplate on his power harness was made of an Eternian mineral (corodite) which helped add to his physical strength. The origin of the power harness was explained in the episode "Evil-Lyn's Plot".

The wars left behind advanced machinery and weaponry, known only to select people. The [[Sorceress of Castle Grayskull]] gave He-Man some of these weapons, and he set out to defend the secrets of [[Castle Grayskull]] from the evil [[Skeletor]]. He-Man possessed one-half of the [[Power Sword]]; Skeletor had the second half, and used it as his main weapon. When joined, the two halves provide the key to Castle Grayskull. In one early illustrated story, He-Man and Skeletor united their two Power Sword halves to form the true Power Sword, defeating [[Trap Jaw]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Manning, Shaun|title=CCI EXCLUSIVE: Seeley Scripts New Adventures of He-Man|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=July 28, 2011|url=https://www.cbr.com/cci-exclusive-seeley-scripts-new-adventures-of-he-man/|access-date=October 15, 2020}}</ref>

[[File:PrinceAdam.jpg|thumb|upright|Prince Adam, from the Filmation cartoon in which [[John Erwin]] provided the character's voice]]
In the animated series He-Man's origins had been revised: his true identity was Prince Adam of Eternia, son of [[King Randor]] and [[Queen Marlena]] (an earthling), who ruled the Kingdom of Eternia on the planet of the same name.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Video: A He Man for All Seasons|magazine=Time|date=January 7, 1985|url=https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956236,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519111800/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956236,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 19, 2008}}</ref> The Sorceress of Castle Grayskull endowed Prince Adam with the power to transform into He-Man, which Adam did by raising his [[Power Sword]] and proclaiming, "By the power of Grayskull..." Once the transformation was complete, he would continue, "...I have the power!".<ref name="Panda director 'for He-Man movie"/> The differences between Prince Adam and He-Man were minimal; He-Man had a slightly deeper voice, a different wardrobe, and slightly darker skin and hair.

Prince Adam's pet was a cowardly green tiger named Cringer. When Adam became He-Man, he transformed Cringer into a brave armored green tiger named [[Battle Cat]] by pointing his sword at him – an ability Adam discovered accidentally during one of his transformations into He-Man. Cringer, naturally, cowered in fear at seeing what Adam had become; while reassuring him that nothing had really changed, Adam pointed the sword of power at Cringer, which sent a bolt of energy toward the tiger and transformed him. Battle Cat served as He-Man's steed and fierce fighting companion ever since.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|url=https://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/659/659754p1.html|title=He-Man and the Masters of the Universe - Season One, Volume One|access-date=October 15, 2020|work=[[IGN]]|date=October 19, 2005}}</ref>

Adam was friendly with [[Teela]] who, unbeknownst to her, was the daughter of the Sorceress and was adopted by Prince Adam's mentor; Duncan / Man-At-Arms. Adam and Teela grew up together and now, as Captain of the Guard, she was entrusted to protect him. Unaware of his identity as He-Man, she saw Adam as lazy and cowardly, an act he keeps up to prevent people from discovering his secret identity.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who da man?

Man-At-Arms was He-Man's closest companion and the Eternian royal family's innovator of technology and weapons. He often unveiled new weapons or devices to help He-Man. Castle Grayskull was the source of He-Man's powers, where the Sorceress lived, who granted Adam his transformative abilities and communicated [[telepathy|telepathically]] with him. To protect his family He-Man kept his double identity a secret, sharing it only with [[Orko (fictional character)|Orko]], Man-At-Arms, Cringer and the Sorceress. He-Man's archenemy was Skeletor, a blue-skinned sorcerer with a yellow skull for a head.<ref name="Panda director 'for He-Man movie">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7860384.stm|title=Panda director 'for He-Man movie|access-date=October 15, 2020|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=January 30, 2009}}</ref> He was skilled in [[black magic]] and all forms of combat, being extremely cunning and intelligent. Skeletor was accompanied by a group of henchmen who aided his evil schemes.

The spin-off series ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'' revealed that Adam had a twin sister: [[Princess Adora]], a leader of the Great Rebellion against [[Hordak]] on the planet [[Etheria (She-Ra)|Etheria]].

{{Main|He-Man & She-Ra: A Christmas Special}}
At the height of the conjoined popularity of the ''He-Man'' and ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power|She-Ra]]'' cartoons, Filmation produced a television Christmas movie, aired it in syndication during the 1985 Christmas Holiday season. The Christmas special reunited twins He-Man and [[She-Ra]] in their biggest joint adventure since the ''Secret of The Sword''. It commences with Queen Marlena reflecting nostalgically about Christmases on Earth and, after a series of misadventures set in motion by Orko, climaxes with a confrontation that pits He-Man, She-Ra and Skeletor—whose personality briefly softened by a pair of Earthling children, a pup, and "Christmas Spirit"—against Hordak and Horde-Prime.

====''The New Adventures of He-Man'' (1990)====
{{Main|The New Adventures of He-Man}}
After the end of the Masters of the Universe toy line, Mattel attempted to revive interest in He-Man by producing a new toy line, entitled ''He-Man''.<ref name="Masters Cast">{{cite web|url=https://masterscast.com/?p=46|title=Masters Cast - Episode 25|access-date=October 15, 2020|work=Masters Cast}}</ref> The storyline in the minicomics packaged with the figures explained that He-Man had left Eternia and pursued Skeletor into the depths of space, who had set his sights on conquering the distant world of Primus; a planet with great technological resources. He-Man was shown to have relinquished the identity of Prince Adam altogether, basing himself on Primus where he led a team of defenders known as the Galactic Guardians. He-Man's appearance was retooled for the new toy line, with a space helmet and golden armor added to his attire to give him a more futuristic appearance; his sword was also redesigned.

A cartoon series was produced by Jetlag Productions to accompany the toy line, entitled ''[[The New Adventures of He-Man]]''. Although generally following the story line from the minicomics, this series maintained the double identity of Prince Adam and He-Man. On the planet Primus, Prince Adam posed as a traveling merchant and the nephew of Master Sebrian to disguise his secret identity. His transformation oath was altered slightly, to become "By the power of Eternia...".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=5082|title=DVD Review: The New Adventures of He-Man - Volume 1|access-date=October 15, 2009|work=The Trades|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025124920/http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=5082|archive-date=October 25, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/25884/new-adventures-of-he-man-vol-1/|author=Douglass, Todd|title=DVD Review: The New Adventures of He-Man - Volume 1|access-date=October 15, 2020|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=December 26, 2006}}</ref>

The portrayal of his character in this series was consistent with [[Filmation]]'s portrayal, although the character of Prince Adam was brasher and more youthfully energetic than his 1980s counterpart (conveying the image of a teenage boy saddled with the responsibility of defending a planet from evil).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/32989/he-man-and-the-masters-of-the-universe-volume-one/|title=He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Season One, Volume One|access-date=October 15, 2020|work=[[DVD Talk]] |last=Siwek |first=Daniel|date=February 19, 2008}}</ref> The Adam/He-Man character was redesigned, to make the character's secret identity more credible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.toonzone.net/articles/23430/masters-of-the-universe-2002-the-power-returns-in-style|title=Masters of the Universe 2002": The Power Returns, In Style|access-date=October 15, 2020|work=Toon Zone}}</ref> The second-season episode "The Power of Grayskull" revealed Adam/He-Man to be a descendant of [[King Grayskull]] (a powerful [[barbarian]] and a [[hero]] from Eternia's ancient past), who sacrificed his life in order to save Eternia from the [[Evil Horde]] and originally wielded the Sword of Power. He was the original owner of Castle Grayskull; his sword was concealed in the castle for centuries before being given to Prince Adam, who inherited his ancestor's own power channeled through the sword (thus giving added meaning to the phrase "By the power of Grayskull...").

{{main|The Secret of the Sword}}
In 1985, [[Filmation]], released the full-length feature film '''''He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword'''''. The movie introduced Adam's twin sister Adora, who was abducted as an infant by Hordak and Skeletor. Hordak absconded with Adora to the planet Etheria, where he raised Adora to be a warrior and captain for his Evil Horde, and hid her true heritage from her. The film reveals that He-Man's power sword has a twin, the Sword of Protection, which, when wielded by Adora to summon the power of Grayskull, transforms her into She-Ra; He-Man's female counterpart.

====''Masters of the Universe'' (1987 film)====
{{Main|Masters of the Universe (film)}}
In 1987, [[Cannon Films]] produced a [[live-action]] film directed by Gary Goddard, ''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]'', which featured [[Dolph Lundgren]] in the role of He-Man; it was a commercial failure.<ref name="Panda director 'for He-Man movie" /> In this film, the Prince Adam does not exist, with only He-Man appearing. He is more aggressive than his cartoon counterpart, attacking with lasers, his sword and bare fists several times throughout the film. The film ended with a spectacular and violent clash with Skeletor, in which Skeletor was flung deep beneath Castle Grayskull into a pit filled with steaming liquid.

====Reboot film====
On April 29, 2019, actor [[Noah Centineo]] confirmed in an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' that he would be playing He-Man in the ''Masters of the Universe'' film, which was due to begin production in July 2019 and set for a 2020 release.<ref name=et>{{cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/noah-centineo-confirms-hes-playing-he-man-in-masters-of-the-universe-i-am-very-excited-124290 |last=Seemayer |first=Zach |title=Noah Centineo Confirms He's Playing He-Man in 'Masters of the Universe': 'I Am Very Excited'|date=April 29, 2019 |work=[[Entertainment Tonight]] }}</ref> However, due to the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic]] he pulled out of casting two years later.

===Merchandise===
====''Masters of the Universe Classics'' (2008)====
This action-figure line combined elements from the He-Man universe into a cohesive storyline with biographies on the figures' packaging.<ref>{{cite web|title=There's No Disguising That MOTUC Preternia Disguise He-Man Is A Great Action Figure!|work=[[MTV]]|date=February 24, 2011|url=https://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/02/24/theres-no-disguising-that-motuc-preternia-disguise-he-man-is-a-great-action-figure/|access-date=February 28, 2011|url-status= dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227202119/http://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/02/24/theres-no-disguising-that-motuc-preternia-disguise-he-man-is-a-great-action-figure/|archive-date=February 27, 2011}}</ref> These biographies suggested that several "He-Men" have come into existence – such as Vikor (based on an early concept design for the vintage He-Man), Oo-Larr (based on the jungle He-Man from the first minicomic.  His figure still had the blonde hair but featured a more textured fur loincloth, no boots and came with a primitive stone spear), and Wun-Dar (based on the so-called "Wonder Bread" He-Man figure.  This figure had brown hair, brown loincloth and wears a black version of Zodac's armor.  He came packaged with a black and silver power sword and black pistol) – but Prince Adam was the only one who actually wielded the Power Sword and transformed into the true He-Man.

==Feminist / gender analysis==
According to a book by [[Michael G. Cornelius]], He-Man is considered a narrow definition of masculinity. Cornelius cited He-Man as the literal "strongest man in the universe" and says that his chief adversary Skeletor's primary weapon is his intellect; mirroring a Superman/[[Lex Luthor]] dichotomy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael G.

===Response from Mattel and insiders===
According to ''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'' voice actress [[Erika Scheimer]]—who is openly lesbian, and the daughter of [[Filmation]] co-founder [[Lou Scheimer]]—the company was welcoming of gay artists, with many members of the studio "long[ing] to see themselves onscreen" and joking that He-Man is gay.<ref name="Men's Health"/> According to Mark Morse, [[Mattel]]'s director of global marketing from 2008 to 2017, the question of He-Man's sexuality and whether a future installment in the franchise should have him be openly gay has not been discussed at the company by the release of the Laughing Prince Adam action figure in 2018.<ref name="Men's Health"/> However, Morse did state that Mattel wanted to ensure the figure would not be viewed as offensive to the [[LGBT community]].<ref name="Men's Health"/>
