White Lies formed in October 2007, after writing songs that they felt didn't suit their original band. After delaying their first performance for five months to build up media hype,<ref name="Ivor Novello"/> they earned a recording contract with [[Fiction Records]] days after their debut. The release of singles "[[Unfinished Business (song)|Unfinished Business]]" and "[[Death (White Lies song)|Death]]" led to tours and festival appearances in the United Kingdom and North America, including a headline performance at [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Radio 1's Big Weekend|Big Weekend]] and a place on the [[NME Tours#ShockWaves NME Awards Tours|2009 ''NME'' Awards Tour]]. At the beginning of 2009, White Lies featured in multiple "ones to watch" polls for the coming year, including the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Sound of... (BBC poll)#Past winners|Sound of 2009]]'' poll and the [[BRIT Awards|BRITs]] Critics' Choice Award.

White Lies' debut album ''[[To Lose My Life...]]'', released in January 2009, hit number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Their second album ''[[Ritual (White Lies album)|Ritual]]'' was recorded in 2010, and released on 17 January 2011. ''[[Big TV (album)|Big TV]]'', their third studio album, was released on 12 August 2013, whilst their fourth, titled ''[[Friends (White Lies album)|Friends]]'', was released 7 October 2016.

Two weeks prior to the group starting university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit.
