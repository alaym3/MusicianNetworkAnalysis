==History==

Josh Scogin's former band, [[The Chariot (band)|the Chariot]], played their final show in November 2013.<ref name="altpress2"/> Just over a week later, Scogin teased an announcement with a countdown timer on the website ''theyare68.com'';<ref name="altpress3"/> when the timer ended in December 2013, Scogin revealed that he had formed a new band named '68 and posted a two-song EP titled ''[[Midnight (EP)|Midnight]]'' for sale online.<ref name="altpress4"/> The title of the EP and its two songs—"Three Is a Crowd" and "Third Time Is a Charm"—are significant to Scogin;<ref name="newnoise1"/> the use of the number three in the song titles represents the third act of his life following his stints in [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]] and the Chariot, and Scogin also explained that three represents "that thought process of continuing on in my head: 'Three's a charm,' oh, this is gonna be great or 'three's a crowd,' like we should've stuck with the Chariot."<ref name="newnoise1"/> The initial pressing of ''Midnight'' sold out in less than one day; independent record label [[No Sleep Records]] re-released it with new artwork on 1 April 2014.<ref name="altpress1"/>

'68 toured in April and May 2014, opening for [[Chiodos]], [[Emarosa]], [[Our Last Night]], and [[Hands Like Houses]],<ref name="altpress5"/> and in May 2014 announced their signing to [[Good Fight Music]] and [[eOne Music]] to release their debut album ''[[In Humor and Sadness]]'', which was released two months later on 8 July 2014.<ref name="altpress6"/><ref name="altpress7"/> To promote the album, '68 released "Track Two: e" on YouTube as a pair videos that had to be played in unison in order to hear the song correctly.<ref name="altpress9"/> Scogin said of releasing the song this way: "[S]omeone will have one computer and invite a friend over that has another computer, they will spend several minutes struggling and laughing at trying to sync up the two videos perfectly."<ref name="kerrang1"/> The song "Track One: R" was also available for online streaming ahead of the album's release,<ref name="altpress10"/> and in August, '68 released a music video for "Track One: R" directed by former [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]] and [[Underoath]] member [[Daniel Davison]].<ref name="altpress11"/> The band's first tour in support of ''In Humor and Sadness'' featured [[Listener (band)|Listener]] (whose vocalist [[Dan Smith (Listener)|Dan Smith]] previously guested on the Chariot's 2010 album, ''[[Long Live (The Chariot album)|Long Live]]'') and [[The Homeless Gospel Choir|Homeless Gospel Choir]].<ref name="altpress8"/>

Scogin and McClellan entered the studio in January 2016 to work on their second album,<ref name="altpress12"/> and a few months later posted a demo from the then-upcoming album to YouTube on 14 March 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wallofsound.org/2016/03/15/68-just-dropped-a-brand-new-song-unexpectedly/|title='68 just dropped a Brand New Song unexpectedly|last=brownypaul|website=Wall of Sound|access-date=April 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324153659/http://wallofsound.org/2016/03/15/68-just-dropped-a-brand-new-song-unexpectedly/|archive-date=March 24, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The album, ''[[Two Parts Viper]]'', was released over a year later on 2 June 2017.

A few months after the release of ''Two Parts Viper'', McClellan was revealed to have parted ways with Scogin. During the tour, Nikko Yamada replaced McClellan as the band's new drummer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theprp.com/2017/10/03/news/68-reportedly-part-ways-drummer-michael-mcclellan/|title='68 Reportedly Part Ways With Drummer Michael McClellan {{!}} Theprp.com|date=October 3, 2017|work=Theprp.com|access-date=November 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="shockwavemagazine.com">{{Cite web|url=https://shockwavemagazine.com/interview-with-josh-scogins-of-68-on-the-fall-headlining-tour-with-stolas-whores-and-alistair-hennessey/|title=Interview with Josh Scogin's of 68' on the Fall Headlining Tour With Stolas, Whores., and Alistair Hennessey|date=December 8, 2017|access-date=October 28, 2019|archive-date=October 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028171355/https://shockwavemagazine.com/interview-with-josh-scogins-of-68-on-the-fall-headlining-tour-with-stolas-whores-and-alistair-hennessey/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In September 2020, the band released their second EP, ''[[Love Is Ain't Dead]]''.

In January 2021, they announced their third album, ''Give One Take One'', which was released on March 26.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bruce, Jasper |title='68 announce details of third album, share lead single |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/68-announce-details-of-third-album-share-lead-single-2866654 |access-date=January 28, 2021 |work=[[NME]] |date=January 28, 2021}}</ref> They are currently touring with Korn and Staind.{{citation needed|date=August 2021|reason=unless there's a fair bit of secondary coverage, this is against [[WP:NOTNEWS]]}}
