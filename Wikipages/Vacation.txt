A '''vacation''' ([[American English]]), or '''holiday''' ([[British English]]), is a [[leave of absence]] from a regular job. People often take a vacation during specific [[holiday]] observances, or for specific [[festival]]s or celebrations. Vacations are often spent with [[Friendship|friends]] or [[family]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/ct-summer-vacation-poll-20170621-story.html |title=This is the No. 1 thing Americans want to do on vacation |last1=Swanson |first1=Emily |last2=Harpaz |first2=Beth J. |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=26 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227094306/http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/ct-summer-vacation-poll-20170621-story.html |archive-date=27 February 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Vacations may include a specific trip or journey, usually for the purpose of [[recreation]] or [[tourism]].

A person may take a longer break from work, such as a [[sabbatical]], [[gap year]], or [[career break]].

The concept of taking a vacation is a recent invention, and has developed through the last two centuries. Historically, the idea of travel for recreation was a luxury that only wealthy people could afford (see [[Grand Tour]]).  In the [[Puritan]] culture of early [[America]], taking a break from work for reasons other than weekly observance of the Sabbath was frowned upon. However, the modern concept of vacation was led by a later religious movement encouraging [[spiritual retreat]] and recreation. The notion of breaking from work periodically took root among the middle and working class.<ref>{{cite web|author=All Things Considered|date=17 June 2009|title=The History of the Vacation Examined|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105545388|access-date=2 February 2015|publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], ''vacation'' once specifically referred to the long summer break taken by the [[court|law courts]] and then later the term was applied to universities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.postgrad.com/editorial/study-in-uk/uk-postgraduate-study/university-holidays/ |title=United Kingdom University Term Times and Vacations |access-date=5 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113200109/http://www.postgrad.com/editorial/study-in-uk/uk-postgraduate-study/university-holidays/ |archive-date=13 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The custom was introduced by [[William the Conqueror]] from [[Normandy]] where it facilitated the grape harvest.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In the past, many [[upper-class]] families moved to a [[summer home]] for part of the year, leaving their usual home vacant.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== Regional meaning ==
{{See also|Tourism}}{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}

''Vacation'', in English-speaking [[North America]], describes recreational [[travel]], such as a short pleasure trip, or a journey abroad. People in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries use the term ''holiday'' to describe absence from work as well as to describe a vacation or journey. Vacation can mean either staying home or going somewhere.

[[Canadians]] often use ''vacation'' and ''holiday'' interchangeably referring to a trip away from home or time off work. In [[Australia]] and the [[UK]], ''holiday'' can refer to a vacation or a [[public holiday]].

The Vanderbilts, [[Rockefellers]], Carnegies, [[Collis Potter Huntington|Huntingtons]] and other fabulously wealthy industrialists built their own spectacular "great camps" in the [[Adirondacks]] of [[upstate New York]] where they could spend time with their families in private luxury. The scions of [[New York City]] took to declaring that they would "vacate" their city homes for their lakeside summer retreats, and the term "vacation" replaced the [[British English|British]] "holiday" in common parlance.

In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the word ''vakáció'' can mean both a recreational trip, an officially granted absence from work (generally in warmer months), and the summer (longest) school break. For absence from work, the word ''szabadság'' (freedom/liberty) can be used, possibly as ''betegszabadság'' (sickness freedom/sickness liberty) when the reason of absence is medical in nature.

== Family vacation ==
Family vacation refers to recreation taken together by the family. Family vacation can be ritual—for example, annually around the same time—or it can be a one-time event. It can involve travel to a far-flung spot or, for families on a tight budget, a stay-at-home staycation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelingmom.com/making-the-most-of-your-stress-free-budget-staycation/ |title=Tips for Staying Sane on a Staycation |work=Traveling Mom |year=2019 |access-date=2 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211054748/https://www.travelingmom.com/travel-tips/10-tips-for-staying-sane-on-a-staycation/ |archive-date=11 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Some examples of favorite family vacations might include family cruises, trips to popular theme parks, ski vacations, beach vacations, food vacations<ref>{{cite web|year=2014|title=Destination Food Towns in America, Suzy Strutner|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/31/best-food-cities_n_6054716.html/|access-date=31 October 2014|work=Traveling Mom}}</ref> or similar types of family trips.

== Vacation policy ==
In nearly all countries worldwide, there are minimum requirements as to the [[annual leave]] that must be afforded to an employee (see also [[List of minimum annual leave by country]]).

Even in the United States, where no federal requirements as to minimum annual leave exist, many large corporations have vacation policies, some allowing employees to take weeks off and some even allowing unlimited vacation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vanderkam|first1=Laura|date=3 October 2015|title=Here's why unlimited vacation may be too good to be true|work=Fortune|url=http://fortune.com/2015/10/03/unlimited-vacation-policy/|access-date=21 May 2016}}</ref> Unlimited vacation arrangements may nonetheless come with implicit expectations, for instance, it may be implied that an employee should not take more than about the average number of vacation days taken by others. They normally also have the consequence that employees who leave the company receive no monetary compensation for leave days not taken.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

According to the U.S. Travel Association, Americans collectively did not use 662 million vacation days in 2016. More than half of all working people in the [[United States]] forfeited paid time off at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zillman|first=Claire|date=23 May 2017|title=Americans Are Still Terrible at Taking Vacations|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|url=http://fortune.com/2017/05/23/vacation-time-americans-unused/|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref> Two-thirds of people still do work while they are on vacation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ashford|first=Kate|title=Why Americans Aren't Taking Half Of Their Vacation Days|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateashford/2017/05/31/vacation/|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref>

== Impact of digital communications ==
{{Original research section|date=April 2015}}
Recent developments in communication technology—such as internet, mobile, instant messaging, presence tracking—have begun to change the nature of vacation. Vacation today now could mean absence from the workplace rather than temporary cession of work. For a minority subset of workers in North America and the United Kingdom, it is now the norm to carry on working or remain on call while on vacation rather than abandon work altogether. Some office employees [[telecommute]] whilst on vacation. Antithetically, workers may take time out of the office to go on vacation, but remain plugged-in to work-related communications networks. While remaining plugged-in over vacation may generate short-term business benefits, the long-term psychological impacts of these developments are only beginning to be understood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Ray|date=6 May 2012|title=Why It's so Hard to Unplug From the Digital World|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201205/why-it-s-so-hard-unplug-the-digital-world|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131125153230/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201205/why-it-s-so-hard-unplug-the-digital-world|archive-date=25 November 2013|access-date=2 February 2015|work=[[Psychology Today]]}}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
Family vacation and vacation in general has become a common theme in many [[books]], films and movies. Writers often draw on common occurrences that take place during a vacation such as [[disaster]]s and bonding.
