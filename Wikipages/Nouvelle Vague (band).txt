'''Nouvelle Vague''' is a French cover band led by musicians [[Olivier Libaux]] and [[Marc Collin]]. Their name means "new wave" in French, and refers simultaneously to the [[French New Wave]] cinema movement of the 1960s, to the [[new wave music]] movement of the 1970s and 1980s, which provides many of the songs that the band covers, and to [[bossa nova]] (Portuguese for "new wave"), a musical style that the band frequently uses in its arrangements.<ref name="telegraph">{{Cite news |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2 August 2004 |first=Joe |last=Muggs |title=Pop CDs of the week: Teddy Wilson, Skinnyman and more|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3621687/Pop-CDs-of-the-week-Teddy-Wilson-Skinnyman-and-more.html |access-date=24 March 2016}}</ref>

The group's recordings and live performances have featured a large rotating cast of mostly female vocalists. Several of the artists who have performed with the band have also had successful solo careers, including [[Camille (French singer)|Camille]], [[Phoebe Killdeer]], [[Mélanie Pain]], and [[Nadéah|Nadéah Miranda]].

==History==

===2004: ''Nouvelle Vague''===
The group's first album, the self-titled ''[[Nouvelle Vague (album)|Nouvelle Vague]]'', was released in 2004. Explaining how the project came about, Libaux later said: "Marc Collin and I were both musicians and producers in the French music industry when, in 2003, Marc called me with this very strange idea of covering [[Love Will Tear Us Apart]] in a bossa nova version. I thought this idea was absolutely crazy but very exciting. So we decided to get into the studio and try it out as soon as possible. Then we did [[Just Can't Get Enough (Depeche Mode song)|Just Can't Get Enough]] and [[The Guns of Brixton|Guns Of Brixton]]. We put the album together in just eight months. And after that we called ourselves Nouvelle Vague ... and that's the story!"<ref name="bbc-talking"/>

The songs on the first album were recorded with female vocalists who reportedly had not previously heard the songs they would be singing.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Pauline|title=Nouvelle Vague: Offstage, the Band Plays On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/fashion/sundaystyles/nouvelle-vague-offstage-the-band-plays-on.html|access-date=19 March 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 October 2005}}</ref> Eight singers feature on the album in total, including [[Eloisia]], [[Camille (French singer)|Camille]], who performs four songs, and [[Mélanie Pain]], who sings on two tracks. The album features remakes of songs by [[XTC]], [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]], [[Killing Joke]], [[The Clash]], [[Joy Division]], [[Tuxedomoon]], [[The Cure]], and [[The Undertones]]. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number 69 in the French album charts and spending a total of 39 weeks in the top 200.<ref name="lescharts-nv1">{{cite web|title=Nouvelle Vague — ''Nouvelle Vague'' (album)|url=http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Nouvelle+Vague&titel=Nouvelle+vague&cat=a|website=lescharts.com|access-date=23 March 2016|language=fr}}</ref> In 2006 it was reported that the album had sold more than 200,000 copies worldwide.<ref name="inrocks-bap">{{cite news|last1=Conte|first1=Chritsophe|title=Nouvelle Vague: ''Bande à part''|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/musique/critique-album/bandes-a-part/|access-date=24 March 2016|work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]]|date=31 May 2006|language=fr}}</ref>

The group's second album, ''[[Bande à Part (album)|Bande à Part]]'', released in 2006, was again a commercial success. It charted in several European countries, peaking at number 23 in the French album charts, number 15 in the German charts, number 8 in Portugal,<ref name="lescharts-bap">{{cite web|title=Nouvelle Vague — Bande à part (album)|url=http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Nouvelle+Vague&titel=Bande+%E0+part&cat=a|website=lescharts.com|access-date=20 March 2016|language=fr}}</ref> and reaching number 79 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="uk-charts">{{cite web|title=Nouvelle Vague|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/37341/nouvelle-vague/|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref> The album includes versions of the [[Buzzcocks]] song, "[[Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)]]", of [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]", "[[The Killing Moon]]" by [[Echo & the Bunnymen]], "[[Don't Go (Yazoo song)|Don't Go]]" by [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]], "[[Eisbär (song)|Eisbär]]" by [[Grauzone]], and "[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]" by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]].

In 2008, Collin released an album titled ''Hollywood, mon amour'', consisting of recordings made following the Nouvelle Vague formula, of songs from 1980s film soundtracks.<ref name="bbc-hollywood">{{cite web|last1=Quinn|first1=Michael|title=Marc Collin, ''Hollywood, mon amour'' review|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/xh8c|publisher=[[BBC Music]]|access-date=24 March 2016}}</ref> The album includes new versions of "[[Eye of the Tiger]]" from ''[[Rocky III]]'', and of the song "[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]" from the [[Footloose (1984 film)|1984 film of the same name]].

The actress and singer [[Juliette Lewis]] performs a new arrangement of "[[This Is Not America]]" (from the 1985 film ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman]]'').

===2009: ''3''===
[[File:NouvelleVague Rockefeller Oslo.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Nadéah|Nadeah Miranda]] performing with Nouvelle Vague at Rockefeller, Oslo, 10 October 2009]]
On ''[[3 (Nouvelle Vague album)|3]]'' [[Depeche Mode]]'s [[Martin Gore]] sings "[[Master and Servant]]" with Nouvelle Vague singer [[Mélanie Pain]]; [[Ian McCulloch (singer)|Ian McCulloch]] of [[Echo & the Bunnymen]] duets with Pain on "All My Colours"; Marina Celeste performs "[[Our Lips Are Sealed]]" with [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]] of [[The Specials]] and [[Fun Boy Three]]; and [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]'s "Parade" is sung by [[Barry Adamson]] and Nouvelle Vague's Nadeah Miranda.

===2010: ''Best of'' and ''Couleurs sur Paris''===
In 2010 the group released an album of French-language remakes, ''[[Couleurs sur Paris]]''. The album features guest appearances from some well-known musicians, including [[Vanessa Paradis]], [[Olivia Ruiz]], and [[Cœur de pirate]].<ref name="express">{{cite news|last1=Médoni|first1=Gilles|title=L'album en demi teinte de Nouvelle Vague|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/l-album-en-demi-teinte-de-nouvelle-vague_935051.html|access-date=24 March 2016|work=[[L'Express]]|date=12 November 2010|language=fr}}</ref> It also features an appearance by Camille, who returns to perform a version of the song "Putain putain" by the Belgian band [[TC Matic]].

In the same year, the group also released a fifteen-track ''Best of'' compilation. A special edition version of the compilation features an additional disc of rare and unreleased material.

The band's critical and commercial success peaked with the release of their second album, ''Bande à Part''. With the release of ''3'' and ''Couleurs sur Paris'', critics gave the band less attention.<ref name="national"/> The band subsequently went into hiatus, releasing no new material and performing few live shows.<ref name="national"/> Collin later explained this hiatus, saying, "I was bored of myself doing covers," and citing diminishing critical acclaim: "With the first and second albums, all the media said: ‘This is a great idea, a great rendition’ – and after the third album it was suddenly, ‘OK, it’s always the same thing, the same concept, we don’t want to talk about it'."<ref name="national">{{cite news|last1=Garratt|first1=Rob|title=Nouvelle Vague are back – with a twist|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-life/music/nouvelle-vague-are-back--with-a-twist|access-date=24 March 2016|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=9 March 2016}}</ref>

===2016: ''I Could Be Happy''===
A new album ''I Could Be Happy'' was released on 4 November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2016/07/22/news-nouvelle-vague-announce-new-album-tour/|title=NEWS: Nouvelle Vague announce new album ‘I Could Be Happy,’ new EP ‘Athol Brose,’ and an upcoming tour|publisher= odisinthetvzine.co.uk|access-date= 2016-03-11}}</ref> The title track, a cover of the song by [[Altered Images]], was made available for download and digital streaming on 29 September.

===Misc===
In 2016 it was announced that the band would be releasing an "anniversary album" and a documentary, to be titled ''Nouvelle Vague by Nouvelle Vague and Some Friends''.<ref name="national"/> The album is expected to feature "four new remixes of existing material, four previously released covers re-recorded on location with traditional musicians in China, India, Mexico and Hungary, four new covers (provisional picks are tracks by The Ramones, Cocteau Twins, The Associates and Richard Hell) and – wait for it – four original songs."<ref name="national"/><br />

A new EP entitled ''Athol Brose'' was released on 2 September 2016.

==Singers==
Several of the vocalists who have performed with Nouvelle Vague have subsequently found success as solo singers.<ref name="bbc-talking">{{cite news|last1=Libaux|first1=Olivier|title=Talking Shop: Nouvelle Vague|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8133483.stm|access-date=24 March 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=7 July 2009}}</ref> Libaux has attributed this fact to Collin's talent for discovering female singers: "I think he is the best talent scout in the world for female singers. All the female singers we have worked with are just beginning their career. For these girls to be part of Nouvelle Vague for three years - meaning you play 200, 250 gigs - I think it's a very good way to learn about this job."<ref name="bbc-talking"/> The band's singers have included [[Camille (French singer)|Camille]],<ref>Jason Ankeny.
