He attended Citizen Comprehensive College in [[Epe, Lagos]] and later enrolled at Jibril Martin Memorial Grammar School in Iponri.<ref name="NotjustOk.com"/> Patoranking started his performing, arts career as a street jam and carnival dancer. In a 2012 interview with ''Entertainment Express'', he said his stage name was given to him by a Jamaican artist whom he met at Alpha Beach in Lagos. Patoranking has cited [[Buju Banton]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Fela Kuti]], [[Lucky Dube]], [[Chaka Demus]], [[Majek Fashek]], Blackky, [[Blackface Naija|Blackface]], [[Tuface]] and Marvelous Benjy as his key musical influences. In the aforementioned interview with ''Entertainment Express'', he described his music as a morally inclined variation of dancehall and said it references socio-political issues.<ref name="Entertainment Express">{{cite web | url=http://www.e-expressnigeria.com/blog/2012/07/reggae-the-music-of-the-future-patoranking | title=Reggae, the music of the future – Patoranking | publisher=Entertainment Express | date=13 July 2012 | access-date=6 June 2014 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714113327/http://www.e-expressnigeria.com/blog/2012/07/reggae-the-music-of-the-future-patoranking | archive-date=14 July 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>
