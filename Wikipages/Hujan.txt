'''Hujan''' is a Malaysian [[indie rock]] band formed in [[Kuala Lumpur]], in 2005. It was founded by vocalist [[Noh Salleh]] and lead guitarist [[AG Coco]]. Fans of Hujan are dubbed as  ''Raingers'', as the band's name translates to ''[[rain]]'' in [[Malay language|Malay]].<ref name="raingers">{{cite web|accessdate=28 August 2018|url=https://www.star2.com/entertainment/music/music-news/2016/04/27/hujan-fans-will-feel-nostalgic-about-new-album/|title=Hujan fans will feel nostalgic about new album|work=star2|date=27 April 2016|author=Angelin, Yeoh}}</ref> Despite the lack of love from certain quarters at early stage of the band, Hujan has had some of the most successful breakthrough music in [[Malaysia]].

In its early years, Hujan established itself as part of the Malaysian [[independent music]] scene, starting on the social media [[Myspace]]. Their first two EPs circulated around, namely ''[[Hujan#Discography|1, 2, 3, Go!]]'' (2007) and ''[[Hujan#Discography|Check Check Rock Rock]]'' (2007) released by independent record label Noh Phrofile Enterprise. They developed a sound that is unorthodox and uniquely stylistic within Malaysian music, often between combinations of [[alternative rock]] and [[jazz]] melodies. Hujan found unexpected mainstream success and strength of radio airplay with ''[[Hujan#Discography|Pagi Yang Gelap]]'', a single from their EP ''[[Hujan#Discography|1, 2, 3, Go!]]'' (2007). It was received with popularity on indie radio stations such as [[:ms:X FM|XFM]]. Another popular single, from their debut self-titled album Hujan (2008), ''[[Hujan#Discography|Bila Aku Sudah Tiada]]'' received many nominations, and most notably won at Anugerah Muzik Malaysia or AIM in 2009 as the Lagu Terbaik or Best Song. They have released six studio albums, as well as one live album ''Live at Planet Hollywood'' (2009).

Noh Hujan, the frontman of Hujan, has released his own music projects under his real name Noh Salleh, with notable albums such as Angin Kencang.

As of 11 April 2020, Hujan has released their entire discography, including their acclaimed self-titled "Hujan" album onto most major music streaming services, including Spotify and Apple Music.<ref>{{Cite web|title=@hujanband on Instagram: "Raingers!

== History ==

It all started in 2005, when [[Noh Salleh]] uploaded a few [[demo (music)|demos]] as a personal solo project onto then popular social media platform [[Myspace]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whiteboardjournal.com/interview/ideas/music-of-malaysia-with-noh-salleh/|title=Music of Malaysia with Noh Salleh|last=Jenie|first=Ken|date=26 November 2014|website=Whiteboard Journal|language=en-US|access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref> [[AG Coco]], who at the time was a music student, contacted Noh to perform his songs as study material. Hujan's main goal was to be a jazz band, but after end up being rock band with mixture of [[jazz]] elements. Noh Salleh and Hang Dimas played their first gig on 17 February 2006 at Malam Pesta Gagalis Ubu in Lost Generation Space as Hujan. The band released their first two EP ''[[Hujan#Discography|1, 2, 3, Go!]]'' and ''[[Hujan#Discography|Check Check Rock Rock]]'' both in 2007. Subsequently, after the releases, Hujan quickly turned into a musical phenomenon, and went on to win Best Rock Album and Best Rock Song categories on Anugerah Industri Muzik in 2009.<ref name="10yearshujan">{{cite web|accessdate=28 August 2018|url=https://www.star2.com/entertainment/music/music-news/2015/09/22/celebrate-10-years-of-hujan/|title=Celebrate 10 years of Hujan |work=star2|date=22 September 2015|author=Michael, Cheang}}</ref>

In an unfortunate incident in 2008 at [[Johor]], the band were victims of an elaborate set-up by promoter with malicious intent to humiliate and blatantly bully the band members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/people/2013/10/29/hujan-takes-bullying-and-booing-in-its-stride/|title=Hujan takes bullying and booing in its stride|last=Tan|first=Kevin|date=29 October 2013|website=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref> When they played their first song on set 'Aku Scandal' they were met by a barrage of insults by the crowd, which had bad blood with the band due to the fact that they were too 'mainstream'. The crowd continuously chanted 'mainstream' and the show was promptly ended by Hujan after completing the first song. The incident can be seen on YouTube.<ref>{{Citation|title=Hujan kena Maki|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRDqSxSZBY0|language=en|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>

In September 2009, [[Noh Salleh]] invited Izzat Uzaini to join Hujan through a text message, who was looking for a new bassist for Mencari Konklusi Tour.
