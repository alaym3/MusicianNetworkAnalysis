'''Deicide''' is an American [[death metal]] band formed in [[Tampa, Florida]] in 1987 by drummer [[Steve Asheim]] and guitarist brothers Eric and Brian Hoffman as "Carnage", then hiring bassist/vocalist [[Glen Benton]] and becoming "Amon". They would later change the band name to Deicide in 1989. The band rose to mainstream success in 1992 with their second album ''[[Legion (album)|Legion]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/deicide-mn0000194008/awards | title=Deicide - Awards | website=[[AllMusic|Allmusic.com]]|access-date =August 23, 2013}}</ref> and is credited as the second-best-selling death metal band of the [[Soundscan Era]], after [[Cannibal Corpse]].<ref name="death metal sales">{{cite news | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-cannibal-corpse-are-the-top-selling-death-metal-band-of-the-soundscan-era/ | title=It's Official: CANNIBAL CORPSE Are The Top-Selling Death Metal Band Of The SoundScan Era | work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date= November 2003 | access-date =May 17, 2008}}</ref> Since their debut album in 1990, Deicide has released twelve studio albums, one live album, two compilation albums and two live DVDs. In November 2003, their first two albums, ''[[Deicide (album)|Deicide]]'' and ''Legion'', were ranked second and third place respectively in best-selling death metal albums of the [[SoundScan]] era.<ref name="death metal sales"/> Deicide is known for their lyrics, which cover topics such as [[Satanism]], [[anti-Christianity]] and [[blasphemy]]. Their lyrics have resulted in bans, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and the public.

==History==
===Early days as Amon/Carnage (1987–1989)===
[[File:Deicide band 017.jpg|left|thumb|Bassist and vocalist [[Glen Benton]] is one of the two constant members of Deicide.]] Deicide was formed in [[Tampa, Florida]] on July 21, 1987, after guitarist [[Brian Hoffman (musician)|Brian Hoffman]] called [[Glen Benton]], replying to an advertisement the latter had placed in a local music magazine. Hoffman and his brother, along with drummer [[Steve Asheim]], had previously played together as the band "Carnage", which was in need of a bassist and vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bushmado.com/deicideinterview.html |title=DEICIDE Interview with Eric Hoffman |publisher=Bushmado.com |access-date=October 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116032947/http://www.bushmado.com/deicideinterview.html |archive-date=January 16, 2009 }}</ref> Carnage played cover songs by [[Slayer]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/786-steve-asheim |title=Interview with Steve Asheim |publisher=sickdrummermagazine.com |date=February 18, 2008 |access-date=August 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101072429/http://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/786-steve-asheim |archive-date=January 1, 2015 }}</ref>

The new band, called Amon, consisted of Benton (bass and vocals), Hoffman, Hoffman's brother [[Eric Hoffman (guitarist)|Eric]] (guitars) and [[Steve Asheim]] (drums).<ref>Mudrian, Albert (2004). ''Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore''. Feral House. {{ISBN|1-932595-04-X}}. pp. 90-91.</ref> Within a month, they had recorded the ''Feasting the Beast'' [[Multitrack recording|8-track]] demo in Benton's garage and had started playing the occasional gig in the Tampa area. <ref>Mudrian (2004), as above.</ref> In 1989, Amon recorded their second demo, ''Sacrificial'', at [[Morrisound Recording|Morrisound]] with producer [[Scott Burns (producer)|Scott Burns]].

[[Malevolent Creation]] guitarist Phil Fasciana recalls an early Carnage show: "It was like Slayer intensified a thousand times." "I guess Carnage had hollowed out a mannequin and filled it with fuckin' blood and guts from a butcher shop... and then they threw the fuckin' thing on the floor. [[Morbid Angel]] had these pit bulls with them back then and they were just tearing the meat up. It was a really weird scene, man. There was blood and meat everywhere."<ref>"Behind the Crooked Cross." Decibel: 72-78.</ref>

===As Deicide (1989–2004)===
[[File:Deicide band 016.jpg|right|thumb|Drummer [[Steve Asheim]] is one of the two constant members of Deicide.]]
Benton reportedly stormed into [[Roadrunner Records]]' [[A&R]] man [[Monte Conner]]'s office and presented him with the demo, saying, "Sign us, you fucking asshole!" The next day contracts were issued to the band.<ref>Mudrian (2004), as above, p. 162.</ref> In 1989 the band's name was changed to Deicide at the request of Roadrunner Records.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Deicide then released their [[Deicide (album)|self-titled debut album]], also produced by Scott Burns at Morrisound, in 1990. Their debut featured re-recorded versions of all six of the ''Sacrificial'' tunes that had secured them their record deal.
 
Both the Hoffman brothers tended to play technical solos at fast speeds and with overlapping [[riffs]], which gave Deicide the definitive heavy sound and complex song structures. This lineup remained intact until November 25, 2004, in the wake of increasing animosity between Glen Benton and the Hoffmans allegedly in regards to royalties and publishing.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rini|first=Frank|title=Interview with Amon guitarist, Eric Hoffman|url=http://allabouttherock.co.uk/interview-amon-guitarist-eric-hoffman//|work=All About the Rock|date=November 22, 2013|access-date=March 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314005105/http://allabouttherock.co.uk/interview-amon-guitarist-eric-hoffman/|archive-date=March 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Hoffman brothers later went on to reform Amon.

===Post-Hoffman brothers period (2004–present)===
[[File:Deicide band 010.jpg|left|thumb|Guitarist [[Jack Owen]] joined Deicide in 2004, replacing the Hoffman brothers, and remained as a member of the band until 2016.]]
Shortly after, the guitar roles were then filled by former [[Cannibal Corpse]] guitarist [[Jack Owen]], and [[Vital Remains]] guitarist [[Dave Suzuki]]. Following the tour, Suzuki was replaced by guitarist [[Ralph Santolla]]. Santolla stated he was a Catholic, which had received a small amount of shock and ridicule from some metal fans. In spite of this, Deicide's eighth studio album ''[[The Stench of Redemption]]'', which was released on August 22, 2006, received rave reviews.<ref>Bowar, Chad.

In January 2007, Benton left the European tour and returned home to the United States as a result of legal issues at home. Asheim announced that Seth van Loo, from opening act Severe Torture, and Garbaty "Yaha", from the Polish death metal band Dissenter, would be replacing Benton starting on January 9 in the Netherlands, until Benton could rejoin the tour. Benton rejoined the band in Paris on January 13.<ref>[http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/deicide-soldier-on-without-glen/ Deicide soldier on without Glen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722191940/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/deicide-soldier-on-without-glen/ |date=July 22, 2013 }}.

On January 6, 2009, Deicide posted a blog on their official Myspace page saying they had signed a worldwide record deal with [[Century Media]], with Ralph Santolla returning to the band for a European tour. They were said to be working on material for a summer 2010 release. In early 2009, they toured with Vital Remains and Order of Ennead. Guitarist Kevin Quirion of Order of Ennead joined the band in the summer of 2009.

In June 2010, Glen Benton revealed that the next Deicide album was to be titled ''[[To Hell with God]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalpaths.com/interviews/deicide-glen-benton,4129|title=Deicide (Glen Benton) interview|publisher=MetalPaths|date=June 6, 2010|first=K|last=Panagiotis|access-date=June 7, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609082103/http://www.metalpaths.com/interviews/deicide-glen-benton%2C4129|archive-date=June 9, 2010}}</ref> It was produced by Mark Lewis at Audiohammer Studios in Sanford, Florida, and was released on February 15, 2011.

==Controversy==
[[File:Kevin Quirion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Guitarist Kevin Quirion has occasionally been a member of Deicide since 2008.]]
Deicide has received considerable controversy relating to their albums and lyrics, which include vehement [[anti-Christian]] themes, such as "Death to Jesus", "Fuck Your God", "Kill the Christian", "Behead the Prophet" and "Scars of the Crucifix", among others. Drummer Asheim said, "The whole point of Satanic music is to blaspheme against the [[Christian Church|Church]]", "I don't believe in or worship a devil. Life is short enough without having to waste it doing this whole organised praying, hoping, wishing-type thing on some superior being".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/what-the-devil/2006/11/30/1164777708385.html | title=Death-metal gods Deicide are the yin to Barry Manilow's yang. | newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= December 1, 2006 | access-date =May 17, 2008}}</ref>

Most of the controversy surrounded frontman Benton for a rash of shocking interviews and wild statements. Benton has repeatedly branded an [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted cross]] into his forehead on at least 12 different occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzpBxFsZAjI |title=Glen Benton answers crowd questions at Deicide show |publisher=YouTube |access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> During an interview with ''[[NME]]'' magazine, he shot and killed a squirrel with a [[Air gun|pellet gun]] to prevent any further damage to his electrical system in the attic at the location the interview was held. This act garnered negative attention from critics and some animal rights activists. Benton had professed beliefs in [[theistic Satanism]] during Deicide's early years, claimed to slaughter rodents for fun, and that he held beliefs in demonic possession and that he was possessed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mXmn4cx_2I |title=Glen Benton Interview 1990 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> Such statements had eventually been concluded as [[tongue-in-cheek]] and little more than sensationalism by band members questioned alternatively.<ref name="Blabbermouth.net">{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=57924 | title=DEICIDE Frontman On JON NÖDVEIDT's Suicide: 'Only Cowards And Losers Choose That Option' | work=Blabbermouth.net | date=September 7, 2006 | access-date=May 17, 2008 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303074158/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=57924 | archive-date=March 3, 2008 }}</ref> Additionally, Benton claimed in the early 1990s that he would commit suicide at the age of 33 to "mirror" a lifespan opposite that of Jesus Christ. However, he passed that age in 2000 and did not commit suicide, rebutting in 2006 that these statements had been "asinine remarks" and that "only cowards and losers" choose to kill themselves.<ref name="Blabbermouth.net"/>

Deicide has been banned from playing in several venues (such as [[Valparaiso]], Chile over a promotional poster featuring [[Jesus Christ]] with a bullet hole in his forehead<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=43407 |title=Deicide banned in Chile |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=February 23, 2006 |access-date=May 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183756/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=43407 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>) and with various festivals such as [[Hellfest (punk festival)|Hellfest]], after several graves had been spray-painted with "When Satan Rules His World", a reference to a song from Deicide's 1995 album ''[[Once upon the Cross]]''. In addition, their music video for "Homage for Satan", which features blood-splattered zombies on a rampaging mission to capture a priest, was banned from UK music TV channel [[Scuzz]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=45283 |title='Homage For Satan' off the air |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=August 23, 2006 |access-date=May 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329150326/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=45283 |archive-date=March 29, 2008 }}</ref>

In 1992, Deicide was on tour in Europe with [[Atrocity (band)|Atrocity]] from Germany and [[Gorefest]], a Dutch death metal band. In [[Stockholm]], during the Gorefest set, a bomb was discovered on-stage.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/deicide/artist.jhtml#bio | title=Deicide Biography | publisher=MTV | year=2008 | access-date=May 17, 2008 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424093313/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/deicide/artist.jhtml#bio | archive-date=April 24, 2008 }}</ref> It exploded in the club in which they were playing. The bomb was located to the rear of the stage, behind a heavy, fireproof door. The explosion was big enough to deform the door and blow it off its hinges. Deicide managed to play three songs before the police decided to stop the concert and evacuate the club. At first, Benton blamed that attack on the Norwegian [[black metal]] scene, where Deicide's brand of death metal was despised. Many people blamed [[Animal rights movement|animal rights activists]] who were angered at Deicide's lyrical themes of animal sacrifice.<ref>Ekeroth, Daniel (2006).
