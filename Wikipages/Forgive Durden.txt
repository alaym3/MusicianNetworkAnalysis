They are signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]]. Fueled by Ramen released Forgive Durden's first full-length album, ''[[Wonderland (Forgive Durden album)|Wonderland]]'', on May 9, 2006.

On January 27, 2008, lead singer Thomas Dutton announced on the band's blog that the other three members had decided to leave the band, citing personality conflicts as the primary reason.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110929122719/http://www.forgivedurden.com/blog/?p=25 "Open the floodgate."] ''Forgivedurden.com''.
