'''Parry Gripp''' (born September 22, 1967<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/parry_p_gripp_born_1967_9878103 |title=The Birth of Parry Gripp |website=californiabirthindex.org |access-date=March 15, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Family Tree Legends">{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/39461?c=search&first=Parry&last=Gripp |title=Family Tree Legends |access-date=21 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821081357/http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/39461?c=search&first=Parry&last=Gripp |archive-date=2012-08-21}}</ref>) is an American singer-songwriter who is the lead vocalist and guitarist for the [[pop punk]] band [[Nerf Herder]]. Gripp has written numerous novelty songs for children and has been featured on several [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] television shows.

==Style and works==

===False jingles and other novelty songs===
As a songwriter, Gripp is known for fake jingles, as in his 2005 solo album ''For Those About to Shop, We Salute You'' - a 51-track concept album mimicking various musical styles as product commercials. It does not have one single concept; it goes through many various concept suites, such as trucks, beer, and insomnia. He also maintains a song-of-the-week website in December 2007 and a [[YouTube]] channel on August 12, 2006, in which he creates soundtracks to [[internet meme]]s<ref>[http://gawker.com/5109391/parry-gripp-the-weird-al-yankovic-of-youtube Parry Gripp, the Weird Al Yankovic of YouTube]</ref> as well as music videos for his own [[novelty song]]s. In January 2017, "It's Raining Tacos" was featured in an [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]] ad which began airing in early May 2017.

===The Wawa and Hallmark connections===
Along with his phony jingles, Gripp also has created some true advertising music, such as a series of [[Beatles]]-inspired tunes promoting the [[Wawa Inc.|Wawa Food Markets]]' summertime Hoagiefests<ref>[http://hoagiefest.com/ Wawa Hoagiefest website]</ref> and songs for the [[Hallmark Cards]] e-characters [[Hoops&Yoyo|hoops&yoyo]].

===Television theme songs===
Gripp also performs [[The Cockroach Kids]], ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]],'' ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse]],'' ''[[The 7D]],'' and ''[[StoryBots Super Songs]]'' theme songs.

Gripp also joined forces with [[MC Lars]] to perform some of the vocals, including the chorus to "Guitar Hero Hero (Beating Guitar Hero Doesn't Make You Slash)," a song commenting on the notion that video games like ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' take kids away from playing in bands and actually learning their instruments.

On July 9, 2009, Gripp debuted a new song called "The Girl at the Video Game Store" for the 1000th episode of the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 TV]] program ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' The video features the show's hosts [[Olivia Munn]] as the title character and [[Kevin Pereira]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Girl At The Video Game Store | work = [[Kotaku]] | date = July 9, 2009 | url = http://kotaku.com/5311760/the-girl-at-the-video-game-store}}</ref>

In October 2016, Gripp performed and wrote the theme song for the Netflix children‚Äôs show ‚Äú[[StoryBots Super Songs]]‚Äù, which is a spin-off show for the Netflix Original Show named ‚Äú[[Ask the StoryBots]]‚Äù. He also started performing and writing songs for both shows.

His 2011 released song "Space Unicorn" was featured in Daron Nefcy's ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]'' as a ringtone of character [[List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters|Marco Diaz]]'s cellphone.

In July 2012, the [[National Geographic Kids]] website uploaded his video, "Spooky Spider."

In April 2013, Gripp recorded the song "Backyard Hodge Podge" for the episode of the same name for the children's television show ''[[Phineas and Ferb]],'' and he also appeared in the episode in animated form.

Gripp has written songs for the 2019 adult animated webseries ''[[Hazbin Hotel]]'' and its spinoff ''[[Helluva Boss]]''.<ref>{{cite tweet |user= VivziePop|author = [[Vivienne Medrano]]|number= 896046407995371520|date= August 11, 2017|title=The song @parrygripp is making for #HazbinHotel is absolutely a BLAST!!

=== Children's music ===
Gripp has written numerous songs for children, with over 100 songs appearing on his YouTube channel, with over 250 million views. Gripp has released 5 studio albums for children, ''Do You Like Waffles?'', ''Fuzzy Fuzzy Cute Cute, Vol. 1'', ''Mega-Party'', ''Jingle Burgers'' and ''For Kids About to Rock''.

In July 2019, Gripp's "It's Raining Tacos" was used by the city of West Palm Beach to deter homeless people from congregating in some areas, along with the song "[[Baby Shark]]". Gripp requested they remove his title from their playlist and made donations to local homeless shelters.<ref>{{cite web|last=Palminteri|first=John|date=2019-07-24|title=Santa Barbara musician helps homeless after dispute with Florida city|url=https://www.keyt.com/news/santa-barbara-musician-helps-homeless-after-dispute-with-florida-city/1099505901|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903155730/https://keyt.com/news/santa-barbara-musician-helps-homeless-after-dispute-with-florida-city/1099505901|archive-date=2019-09-03|access-date=2019-09-03|website=[[KEYT-TV]]}}</ref>
