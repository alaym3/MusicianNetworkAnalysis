'''Dir En Grey''' (stylized as '''DIR EN GREY''' and previously as '''Dir en grey''') is a Japanese [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in February 1997<ref>{{Cite web|last=Konstantinos|date=2018-04-08|title=A Brief History Of Dir en grey|url=https://medium.com/@hiroyuki101/a-brief-history-of-dir-en-grey-33ed8fb6ac86|access-date=2021-01-11|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref> and currently signed to Firewall Div., a sub-division of [[Free-Will]]. With a consistent lineup of guitarists [[Kaoru (musician)|Kaoru]] and [[Die (musician)|Die]], vocalist [[Kyo (musician)|Kyo]], drummer [[Shinya (musician)|Shinya]] and bassist [[Toshiya (musician)|Toshiya]], they have released ten full-length records. Numerous stylistic changes have made the genre of their music difficult to determine, though it is generally considered to be a form of metal. Originally a [[visual kei]] band, the members later opted for more subtle attire,<ref name="blistering_deg">{{cite magazine| last = Mascia| first = Mike| title = Dir En Grey feature interview| magazine = [[Blistering]]| url = http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/12842/tempidx/5/menuid/3| access-date = 2007-08-07| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235505/http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/12842/tempidx/5/menuid/3| archive-date = September 26, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="kerrang_kyo_interview">{{Citation| last = Brannigan| first = Paul| title = The Perfect Stranger| newspaper = [[Kerrang!]]| pages = 42–43| date = 2008-11-19| url = http://www2.kerrang.com/2008/11/kerrang_magazine_19112008.html| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090116064207/http://www2.kerrang.com/2008/11/kerrang_magazine_19112008.html| archive-date = January 16, 2009| df = mdy-all}}</ref> but have continued to maintain a dramatic image on stage. However the band, especially vocalist Kyo, adopted a more visual look once again, usually sporting dramatic makeup looks and stylish costumes.

==History==

===1997–1999: Early career===
Dir En Grey was preceded by the [[Indie (music)|independent]] rock band La:Sadie's, which included four of Dir En Grey's members before disbanding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/groupe-groupe-Dir_En_Grey-l-en.html|title=Dir En Grey|publisher=Spirit of Metal|access-date=2009-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/database-artists-overview-44-dir-en-grey.html|title=Dir En Grey|publisher=Jame World|author=Cage|date=2009-06-11|access-date=June 14, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905000747/http://www.jame-world.com/us/database-artists-overview-44-dir-en-grey.html|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> They disbanded due to leader and bassist [[Kisaki]] not wanting to debut as he felt that it was too soon, but guitarist [[Kaoru (musician)|Kaoru]] believed that they were ready for it. After parting ways with Kisaki, members Kaoru, [[Kyo (musician)|Kyo]], [[Die (musician)|Die]] and [[Shinya (musician)|Shinya]] recruited bassist [[Toshiya (musician)|Toshiya]] and regrouped as a new band. After playing one show as a [[Kuroyume]] cover-band called ''DEATHMASK'' at the live house [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]] J on January 24, they officially formed "Dir en grey" on February 2, 1997.<ref name="yarouze_1999_p23">{{Citation| title = All about Dir En Grey| newspaper = Yarouze| publisher = TJ Mook| page = 23| date = 1999-10-02| isbn = 978-4-7966-1613-3}}</ref>

The band name is a combination of German "dir", French "en" and English "grey" and was thought to mean {{nihongo|"Grey Silver Coin"|灰色の銀貨|Haiiro no Ginka}},<ref name="Apres Guerre">''Apres Guerre'' #19 (March 1997)</ref> the Japanese translation was used as the name of their fanclub's magazine. They wanted to convey a musical image that was neither black nor white, so they picked grey. In an early interview,<ref name="Apres Guerre" /> vocalist Kyo explained that he knew the name before the band was formed. During the WOWOW Special in 2020, Kaoru elaborates that they took the name from another band that was famous around that time. This band was [[Lareine]], who had released a song called "Dir en gray" in 1995. The song starts with the line ''{{lang|ja-Hani|灰色のあなたに dir en gray|(Haiiro no anata ni dir en gray)}}'', with the Latin part being a correct translation of the Japanese part. Both mean "to you in grey". In a later interview, Kaoru explained that "at the time we chose the band name, it had some meaning but right now it doesn't express the band anymore, so it has come to not mean anything specific. We chose the band name because it sounded right, and it also reflects an image that probably doesn't exist elsewhere."<ref name="blistering_deg"/>

They released their first [[Extended play|EP]], [[Missa (EP)|Missa]], a few months later and attracted mainstream attention in 1998, by entering the top ten on the [[Oricon]] music charts with the still independently produced songs "Jealous" and "-I'll-".<ref name="amg_tmoab"/><ref name="oricon_singles">{{cite web| title = Single chart positions| work = oricon.co.jp| url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/artists/s/6902/| access-date = 2007-08-07}}</ref> Five subsequent singles, arranged and produced by [[X Japan]] co-founder [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki Hayashi]], were published during the first half of 1999. The band's first full-length record, ''[[Gauze (album)|Gauze]]'', followed. One of the shows in support for the album (filmed at the [[Osaka-jo Hall]]) would later become the first of several live concerts to be released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]].

===2000–2004: From ''Macabre'' to ''Vulgar''===
In 2000, vocalist Kyo was hospitalized with hearing trouble and several dates of the tour in support of Dir En Grey's then-upcoming album, ''[[Macabre (album)|Macabre]]'', had to be postponed. Tour 00 >> 01 Macabre eventually took off later the same year and was concluded at [[Nippon Budokan]] shortly after the release of the single "[[Ain't Afraid to Die]]" in April 2001.

In the following year, along with the release of a third full-length album, ''[[Kisou]]'', Dir En Grey gave their first performances abroad, touring China, Taiwan, and South Korea. Back in Japan, the last dates of the lengthy Rettou Gekishin Angya tour were already in support for the band's second EP, [[Six Ugly]]. In the same year, they released the single "Child Prey", which was featured as the second opening theme of the [[Baki the Grappler]] anime series, and also the beginning of their fourth album called ''Vulgar''. In summer 2003, Dir En Grey performed at [[Akasaka Blitz]] for five evenings in a single week, with each show (except the first) themed after a certain album, the last featuring songs from the then yet to be released ''Vulgar''. A DVD set, titled  ''Blitz 5 Days'', was later released exclusively for members of the band's official fan club, titled "A Knot". ''[[Vulgar (album)|Vulgar]]'' was released in September 2003 and tours in support for the record would last well into 2004.

===2005–2006: Early non-Asian touring===
In 2005, Dir En Grey performed in Europe for the first time. Their concerts in [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]] (as part of the It Withers and Withers tour) sold out without promotion save for newsletters by import record stores and internet-based word of mouth.<ref name="grammy_kabuki">{{cite web| last = Reesman| first = Brian| title = Kabuki Rock| work = grammy.com| date = 2006-11-30| url = http://www.grammylive.com/Latin/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2278| access-date = 2007-09-24| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928204954/http://www.grammylive.com/Latin/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2278| archive-date = September 28, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref> [[File:Deg kyo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Kyo performing live at [[Rock im Park]] in 2006]]
The band also performed at two major festivals, [[Rock am Ring]] and Rock im Park. Becoming more involved with the international music scene, French band [[Eths]] opened for them at the Paris concert and Dir en Grey invited American musician [[Wednesday 13]] and his band to play at a show in Japan. Dir En Grey also appeared at the Japanese leg of that year's [[Taste of Chaos]] tour.

2005 saw the group's first official European releases as well, beginning with ''[[Withering to Death.]]'' The band's music had previously been available through means of [[Import (international trade)|import]] and Internet [[file-sharing]] only for European fans. The album achieved Dir En Grey's first non-Asian chart position, reaching No.&nbsp;31 in the Finnish album charts. The subsequent single, "Clever Sleazoid", later climbed to No.&nbsp;15 on the singles charts in the same country.<ref name="finnish_charts">{{cite web| title = Finnish chart positions| work = finnishcharts.com| url = http://finnishcharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Dir+en+Grey| access-date = 2008-07-07}}</ref> Several Dir En Grey songs were also featured in the [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack]] of the 2005 film ''[[Death Trance]]''.<ref name="imbd_death_trace">{{cite web| title = Credits for ''Death Trance''| work = imdb.com| url = http://imdb.com/title/tt0443737/fullcredits| access-date = 2007-08-07}}</ref>

In early 2006 touring expanded to the United States. The band performed in [[Austin, Texas]] at the [[South by Southwest]] festival, [[New York City]] at the Avalon Club and [[Los Angeles, California]] at the [[Wiltern Theatre]], followed by the North American release of ''Withering to Death.'' Again, all shows sold out within days.<ref name="jp_invasion">{{cite magazine| last = La Franco| first = Robert| title = Japanese Invasion| work = wired.com| url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.08/posts.html?pg=2| access-date = 2007-08-07}}</ref> After more concerts and festival appearances in Germany during the summer, singer Kyo was again hospitalized due to inflamed vocal cords. While two concert dates in Japan had to be postponed, Dir En Grey was still able to join [[Korn]]'s [[Family Values Tour 2006]].<ref name="blabbermouth_fvt06_lineup">{{cite web| title = Family Values Tour 2006 lineup announcement| work = blabbermouth.net| date = 2006-04-18| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51141| access-date = 2007-08-07| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235439/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51141| archive-date = September 30, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref> In October, the band was back in Japan to perform at the [[Loudpark Festival]], along with bands such as [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]] and [[Children of Bodom]].<ref name="loudpark_2006_lineup">{{cite web| title = Loud Park 2006 lineup| work = loudpark.com| url = http://www.loudpark.com/06/index.html| access-date = 2007-08-07}}</ref> Their 22nd single "[[Agitated Screams of Maggots]]" was released on 15 November during the Japanese leg of the Inward Scream tour.

===2007–2009: ''The Marrow of a Bone'' and ''Uroboros''===
In February, Dir En Grey went on its first North American headlining tour, visiting sixteen cities<ref name="blabbermouth_inward_scream">{{cite web| title = Inward Scream U.S. leg announcement| work = blabbermouth.net| date = 2006-11-11| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=62008| access-date = 2007-08-07| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070910082538/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=62008| archive-date = September 10, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Newtype USA 2007-01 19">"Dir En Grey' cross the USA".

The group went on another international tour in September named after their most recent single "[[Dozing Green]]", beginning in Japan and continuing in Europe, including their first performance in the Netherlands and Switzerland. In late November, Dir En Grey opened two shows for [[Linkin Park]] at [[Saitama Super Arena]] and in December performed another Japan tour with [[10 Years (band)|10 Years]] as a supporting act. Commemorating Dir En Grey's tenth anniversary as a band, two greatest hits compilations, titled ''Decade 1998–2002'' and ''Decade 2003–2007'' respectively, were released on December 19.

At the beginning of 2008, Dir En Grey announced plans to begin recording a new studio album.<ref name="Planet-Loud interview ">{{cite web| title = Planet-Loud interview| work = planet-loud.com| url = http://www.planet-loud.com/v6/interview.php?interview_id=1078&bandname=Dir%20En%20Grey| access-date = 2007-12-03| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213031204/http://www.planet-loud.com/v6/interview.php?interview_id=1078&bandname=Dir%20En%20Grey| archive-date = December 13, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Their first touring of the year in May was another Japan tour with a conclusion of three shows at [[AgeHa|Shinkiba Studio Coast]], titled Death over Blindness. Between touring, Dir En Grey performed at one night of the two-night [[hide (musician)|hide]] memorial summit on May 4, alongside [[X Japan]], [[Luna Sea]], and others.<ref>{{cite web| title = hide memorial summit| work = hide-city.com| url = http://www.hide-city.com/mcontents/special/080407_summit/| access-date = 2008-04-29| language = ja| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428080339/http://www.hide-city.com/mcontents/special/080407_summit/| archive-date = April 28, 2008| df = mdy-all}}</ref> A second Japanese tour, titled Tour 08 The Rose Trims Again began on September 10, the same day as the release of their single "[[Glass Skin]]".

On August 1, Dir En Grey announced the release of their seventh studio album, ''[[Uroboros (album)|Uroboros]]'', which was released on November 11, 2008 in the United States. The band also toured the United States and Canada in support of the album,<ref name="yahooj">{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.co.jp/music_news/d/20080801-00000000-cdj-musi |title=Dir En Grey、シングル「Glass Skin」に続き、約2年ぶりとなるニュー・アルバム『Uroboros』が発売決定！ |access-date=2008-08-01 |date=2008-08-01 |format=News update |work=music.yahoo.co.jp |publisher=Yahoo Japan Corporation |page=1 |language=ja |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817184539/http://music.yahoo.co.jp/music_news/d/20080801-00000000-cdj-musi |archive-date=August 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="barks">{{cite web|url= http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000042249|title= DIR EN GREY : DIR EN GREY、「GLASS SKIN」に続き、新アルバム『UROBOROS』 / BARKS ニュース|access-date= 2008-08-05|date= 2008-08-02|format= News article|work= barks.jp|publisher= Aitimedia, Inc.|page= 1|language= ja}}</ref> with dates scheduled for November and December (overlapping the release of ''Uroboros''<ref name="jame_namerica">{{cite web|url= http://jame-world.com/us/news.php?archive=08/2008#34536|title= Dir En Grey North America Tour|access-date= 2008-08-12|format= News archive|work= jame-world.com|author= Jacob|publisher= Asian Music Entertainment|page= 1|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828051354/http://www.jame-world.com/us/news.php?archive=08%2F2008#34536|archive-date= August 28, 2008|url-status= dead}}</ref>) with opening act [[The Human Abstract (band)|The Human Abstract]]. Touring that fall included a series of four shows titled Bajra, two being fan-club exclusive, and a single show on December 29 under the moniker Uroboros -Breathing- at the famous [[Osaka-jo Hall]] where Dir En Grey had not performed since December 18, 1999 (as seen on ''1999.12.18 Osakajo Hall'').

Beginning in 2009, Dir En Grey made their first thorough tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland with ''[[Kerrang!]]'''s "Relentless Tour '09" alongside [[Mindless Self Indulgence]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Black Tide]] and [[In Case of Fire]]. In February, the band announced the public release of the live DVD, ''Tour 08 The Rose Trims Again'', as well as switching European record labels to the newly founded [[Okami Records]], a sister label of their former European representation, [[Gan-Shin]].

During spring of 2009, the band began to fully promote ''Uroboros'' with a series of nationwide tours under the title Tour 09 Feast of V Senses. The tour was interrupted briefly while in [[Sapporo]] and [[Sendai]], with an announcement on the band's official website, explaining that Kyo had been diagnosed with [[edema]] of the larynx, and would require the postponement of three shows, which were rescheduled for early May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direngrey.co.jp/english/0406.html|title=Postponement of Sendai & Sapporo shows|publisher=direngrey.co.jp|access-date=May 20, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923215011/http://www.direngrey.co.jp/english/0406.html|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Dir en grey 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Dir En Grey in [[Saarbrücken]], Germany, in 2009]]
Dir En Grey continued their Feast of V Senses tour in Europe, with a mixture of festival performances, headlining shows, and one co-headlining show with [[Killswitch Engage]]. The festival performances included their third appearances at Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, as well as their initial concerts at [[Download Festival]], [[Nova Rock]], and [[Metaltown]]. Among the headlining shows, Dir En Grey were also making debut concerts in Italy and the Czech Republic.

After several shows of their late-summer tour, All Visible Things, Dir En Grey announced their next single for December, "[[Hageshisa to, Kono Mune no Naka de Karamitsuita Shakunetsu no Yami]]", as well as a North American and South American tour also under the title All Visible Things. Their new single was released on December 2, 2009 and reached number 2 on the Oricon Weekly Chart: the highest position to date for the band. Their 2009 tour season ended with a three-live tour titled Dorje. They finally ended their long ''Uroboros'' centered tour by doing two back to back performances at the [[Nippon Budokan]], titled Uroboros: with the proof in the name of living…, where tickets sold out in 15 minutes.

===2010–2013: ''Dum Spiro Spero'' and ''The Unraveling''===
It was announced on April 7, 2010, that the band would be returning to the United Kingdom in August on the lineup for the [[Sonisphere Festival]] in Knebworth, playing on a bill headlined by [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Rammstein]]. According to the festival website, this was to be their only UK festival performance during the year. Regarding the announcement, Kaoru (on the Sonisphere UK website) is quoted as saying:

<!--When editing this section, please consider that throwing many unnecessary genres at the unsuspecting reader does little to provide an accessible overview.-->
Dir En Grey has been categorized in many genres such as [[extreme metal]], [[alternative music|alternative]], [[experimental music|experimental]], [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] and various others. Dir En Grey's format has been subject to change throughout their career, initially being a rather experimental form of [[alternative rock]]. Some tracks of their debut album ''[[Gauze (album)|Gauze]]'' also demonstrated a distinct [[pop music|pop]] appeal, which was largely dropped in favor of a more [[progressive rock|progressive]] sound on the following albums, ''[[Macabre (album)|Macabre]]'' and ''[[Kisou]]''. While up to that point some songs had already been more fast-paced, raw and aggressive than others, the band's music took a decisive turn with the release of the EP [[Six Ugly]], from then on sporting more [[heavy metal music|metal]] influences in general. Dir En Grey's style gravitated towards [[riff]]s and [[song structure (popular music)|song structures]] more along the lines of contemporary North American fusion genres, such as [[nu metal]] and [[metalcore]], until 2007's ''[[The Marrow of a Bone]]''. In a review of their sixth full-length album, ''[[The Marrow of a Bone]]'', [[AllMusic]]'s Thom Jurek comments on their evolution and diversity, saying:

{{quote |text = The band's sound has embraced tendencies of American metal and nu metal (they participated in Korn's Family Values tour in America), and Dir en Grey bring so many other sonic and musical elements into the mix that they extend not only the reach of their own music, but the boundaries of any music they happen to incorporate into their sound.|author=Thom Jurek, ''Allmusic''<ref name="amg_tmoab"/>}}

Since the release of their album ''[[Uroboros (album)|Uroboros]]'' in 2008, Dir En Grey have been repeatedly described as [[progressive metal]]. Uroboros and their 2011 album ''[[Dum Spiro Spero (album)|Dum Spiro Spero]]'' represent a particular musical departure from previous albums, with critics noting that their sound on these albums bears almost nothing in common to their earliest work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/146623-dir-en-grey-dum-spiro-spero/|title=Dir En Grey: Dum Spiro Spero|access-date=2016-07-07}}</ref> With Uroboros, and particularly on ''Dum Spiro Spero'', the band have moved away from their alternative rock roots towards a heavier metal sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/120471/album-review-dir-en-grey-dum-spiro-spero/|title=Album Review: Dir En Grey 'Dum Spiro Spero' |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=2011-07-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-07}}</ref> These albums feature complex song structures and guitarwork, longer track lengths, and a broader variety of particularly western influences, such as [[death metal]], [[deathcore]] and [[groove metal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/dir_en_grey/dum_spiro_spero/index.html|title=Dir En Grey: Dum Spiro Spero |website=Ultimate-guitar.com|access-date=2016-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dum-spiro-spero-mw0002173137|title=Dum Spiro Spero - Dir en Grey {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2016-07-07}}</ref>

They were all singing in English and I had no idea what they were saying. But I still remember the excitement that I experienced. I know as a listener that our fans can connect to our music in the same way — even with the language barrier." When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that "We consider our music [to be] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork." The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers "the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that." However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, so they also plan to use English when they feel the need.<ref name="metalsucks"/> The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of [[profanity]] has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on ''Uroboros''), and several songs rely heavily on [[double entendre]]s and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a [[kanji]] character.<ref name="centigrade_translations">{{cite web| last = Stewart| first = Brian| author2 = Sakuma, Takako| title = Lyrics translations with notes| work = centigrade-j.com| url = http://www.centigrade-j.com/translations/direngrey.htm| access-date = 2007-08-07| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070324061146/http://www.centigrade-j.com/translations/direngrey.htm| archive-date = March 24, 2007| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>

Dir en Grey have created some controversy in Japan as some of their music videos have been banned from television for "abrasive visuals including baby-eating, murder,[and] gore."
