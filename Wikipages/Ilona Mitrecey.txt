'''Ilona Mitrecey''' (born 1 September 1993 in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]]), more commonly known as '''Ilona''', is a French singer.

==Biography==

Ilona always dreamed to become a stuntwoman or filmmaker. Her parents knew an Italian music producer who was looking for a kid to record a song in French for the Italian market and asked Ilona. A few years after, the record label decided to release the song in France and that's when Ilona became famous.

She became famous in France after the release of her [[hit single]], "[[Un monde parfait|Un Monde parfait]]" ("A Perfect World"), a high-energy [[eurodance]] song which had already been released in Italy in March 2004 under the name 'Très Bien featuring Ilona', on 28 February 2005. The song reached #1 on France's [[SNEP]] charts on 6 March 2005, and stayed on top of the charts for 15 weeks. Her second single, "[[C'est les vacances]]", was released on 20 June 2005.

Ilona finished highschool at [[Lycée Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)|Lycée Pasteur]] in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] in [[Hauts-de-Seine]]. She has sung in many advertisements. Her father was the singer in the band playing in some shows of [[Canal Plus]] and he composed the music of some films of [[Max Pécas]], and her mother, Sylvie, works at the Michel Lafon publishing house. Her mother is now in a relationship with [[Rachid Arhab]], a famous French journalist.

Her [[Un Monde Parfait (album)|album]] was released on 10 October 2005.

Ilona very rarely does live performances, but she was coaxed into appearing on the nationally acclaimed show Hit Machine on [[Métropole 6|M6]] prior to the success of the single "[[Un monde parfait|Un Monde parfait]]".

In 2007, Ilona won an [[EBBA Awards|EBBA]] Award. Every year the EBBA recognizes the success of ten emerging artists or groups who reached audiences outside their own countries with their first internationally released album in the past year.

In 2007, she decided to stop her singing career to focus on her studies and enrolled in cinema studies between France and New York where she lived for one year. She has now finished her studies and is trying to find her dream job.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.programme-tv.net/news/musique/210275-ilona-mitrecey-que-devient-linterprete-du-cultissime-un-monde-parfait-video/|title=Ilona Mitrecey : que devient l'interprète du cultissime Un monde parfait ? (VIDEO)|last=Emile|first=Raphaël|date=2018-07-03|website=www.programme-tv.net|language=fr|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref> She still records voices for commercials in France from time to time because she finds it fun but does it anonymously because she prefers to keep it quiet.

Ilona currently has a YouTube account and still posts some of her albums, but prefers to keep it mononymously as 'Ilona'.
