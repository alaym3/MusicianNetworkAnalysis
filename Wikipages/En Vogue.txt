'''En Vogue''' is an American R&B/pop vocal group whose original lineup consisted of singers [[Terry Ellis]], [[Dawn Robinson]], [[Cindy Herron]], and [[Maxine Jones]].<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/artist/301747/en-vogue Biography – En Vogue] Billboard.com. Retrieved on February 17, 2015</ref> Formed in Oakland, California, in 1989, En Vogue reached No. 2 on the [[US Billboard Hot 100|US Hot 100]] with the single "[[Hold On (En Vogue song)|Hold On]]", taken from their 1990 debut album ''[[Born to Sing (En Vogue album)|Born to Sing]]''. The group's 1992 follow-up album ''[[Funky Divas]]'' reached the top 10 in both the [[US Billboard 200|US]] and [[UK Album Chart|UK]], and included their second US number two hit "[[My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)]]" as well as the US top 10 hits "[[Something He Can Feel|Giving Him Something He Can Feel]]" and "[[Free Your Mind (song)|Free Your Mind]]".

In 1996, "[[Don't Let Go (Love)]]" became the group's third, and most successful single, to reach number two in the US, and became their sixth number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs|US R&B chart]]. Robinson left the group in 1997 shortly before the release of their third album ''[[EV3]]'', which reached the US and UK top 10. Jones left the group in 2001, Amanda Cole joined shortly thereafter. However, in 2003, Cole left the group, and [[Rhona Bennett]] joined the group during the recording of their album ''[[Soul Flower]]''. In 2005, the original members briefly united before disassembling again. In 2009, the original members once again reunited for their "En Vogue: 20th Anniversary". Shortly after the tour, Robinson and Jones again departed from En Vogue, with Bennett rejoining the group as a trio.

==Band history==

===1989–1991: Formation and ''Born to Sing''===
In the late-1980s, when they were assembling their 1988 compilation project ''FM2'' for [[Atlantic Records]], Oakland-based production and songwriting duo [[Denzil Foster]] and [[Thomas McElroy]] first conceived the idea of a modern-day girl group in the tradition of commercially successful female bands that flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s .<ref name="nytimes19930131">{{cite web|first=Julia |last=Szabo|title=Sound of Style|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/31/style/sound-of-style.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 31, 1993|access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> Foster and McElroy envisioned an entertainment unit with interchangeable but not identical parts in which every member would qualify to take the lead vocals on any given number.<ref name="nytimes19930131"/> Thus, their plan was to recruit singers who possessed strong voices, noticeably good looks, and intelligence.<ref name="ew19920605">{{cite web|first=Meredith|last=Berkman |title=En Vogue rise to the top|url=http://ew.com/article/1992/06/05/en-vogue-rise-top/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=June 5, 1992 |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> Approximately 3,000 women attended the auditions held in 1988,<ref name="nytimes19930131"/> with [[Dawn Robinson]], [[Cindy Herron]], and [[Maxine Jones]] making the final cut.<ref name="vibe19940401">{{cite web|first=Guy|last=Trebay|title=Pillow Talk|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SsEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22advertisement+%22+%22EN+VOGUE%22+%22AUDITION%22&pg=PA41|publisher=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=April 1, 1994 |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> Originally conceived as a trio, Foster and McElroy decided to create a quartet after hearing the audition of [[Terry Ellis]] whose plane had been late from Houston, Texas.<ref name="vibe19971001">{{cite web|title=Holding On|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSsEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22EN+VOGUE%22+%22fm2%22&pg=PA117|publisher=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=October 1, 1997 |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> At first, they selected the band name 4-U but soon shifted to Vogue, ultimately settling on En Vogue, upon learning that another group had already claimed the Vogue name.<ref name="hp20160909">{{cite web|first=Lisa|last=Capretto|title=En Vogue Are 'So Glad' They Didn't Use Their Original Name|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/en-vogue-original-name_us_57dc618be4b04a1497b4be31|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=September 9, 2016|access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref>

After forming, the group began working with their producers on their debut album.

''[[Born to Sing (En Vogue album)|Born to Sing]]'' was released on April 3, 1990. The album peaked at No. 21 on the [[Billboard 200]] chart and No. 3 on Billboard's R&B Albums Chart. The first single, "[[Hold On (En Vogue song)|Hold On]]," was released to radio in late February 1990 and became a crossover pop hit, reaching No. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] singles chart, and No. 1 on both the R&B singles and Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. It later went to No. 5 in the UK and became a hit in Europe. The next two singles, "[[Lies (En Vogue song)|Lies]]" and "[[You Don't Have to Worry (En Vogue song)|You Don't Have to Worry]]," each went to No.  1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B charts, while the fourth and final single, "[[Don't Go (En Vogue song)|Don't Go]]," charted at No. 3 on the Billboard R&B. The album was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA.

"Hold On" was awarded a [[Billboard Music Award]] for "#1 R&B Single of the Year," a [[Soul Train]] Award for R&B/Urban Contemporary Single of the Year, Group, Band or Duo and have been nominated for a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award|Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]]. In 1990, En Vogue signed an endorsement deal to appear in a Diet Coke commercial directed by [[Spike Lee]].

===1992–1994: ''Funky Divas,'' ''Runaway Love'' and touring===
En Vogue's second album, ''[[Funky Divas]]'', was released in the spring of 1992. The album debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Billboard R&B and ultimately doubled the take of its predecessor, going multi-platinum. The album's first two singles: "[[My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)]]" and "[[Giving Him Something He Can Feel]]" both went top 10 and peaked at No. 1 on the R&B charts. The next single, "[[Free Your Mind (En Vogue song)|Free Your Mind]]" also went top 10. The final two singles "[[Give It Up Turn It Loose]]" and "[[Love Don't Love You]]" both were top 40 hits.

The album went on to sell more than five million copies, won an [[American Music Award]] for "Favorite Soul/R&B Album," and was nominated for five Grammy Awards. The music video for "Free Your Mind" earned the group three MTV Video Music Awards for Best Choreography, Best Dance Video, and Best R&B Video. They were honored with Soul Train's Entertainer of the Year Award. In addition to this, the group was featured in ''Rolling Stone'', ''Entertainment Weekly'', and ''Essence'', and other major publications.
They were the best group
Riding high on the success of ''Funky Divas'', a six-song EP titled ''[[Runaway Love (EP)|Runaway Love]]'' was released in the fall of 1993, spawning the hit "[[Runaway Love (En Vogue song)|Runaway Love]]."

The group was signed to an endorsement deal with [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], and was featured as an opening act on [[Luther Vandross]]' 1993 "Never Let Me Go" Tour. England, Germany, the Netherlands, and France were among the numerous countries toured. However, according to an article in ''Vibe'' magazine, Vandross (by his own admission in interviews) and his entourage clashed with the members of En Vogue during the tour, and he vowed never to work with them again.

En Vogue made numerous television appearances on such series as ''[[In Living Color]]'', ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]'', ''[[Roc (TV series)|Roc]]'' and ''[[Hangin' With Mr. Cooper]]'' (the latter two in which they also sang the shows' theme songs).

In 1993, En Vogue was featured on [[Salt-N-Pepa]]'s top 10 hit "[[Whatta Man]]", from Salt-N-Pepa's album ''[[Very Necessary]]''. The track appeared (slightly edited) on En Vogue's ''[[Runaway Love (EP)|Runaway Love]]'' EP.

===1994–1998: The departure of Robinson and ''EV3''===
In 1995, En Vogue was among numerous African American female vocalists featured on the song "[[Freedom (Theme from Panther)|Freedom]]" for the soundtrack to [[Mario Van Peebles]]'s film ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]'' (1995).<ref name="Vibe">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA132|title=Single File|journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=August 1995|page=132|access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref> Also in 1995, while band members [[Cindy Herron]] and [[Maxine Jones]] went on maternity leave, Ellis recorded and released a solo album titled ''[[Southern Gal]]'', which spun off the top 10 R&B single "Where Ever You Are." The same year, the band made a cameo appearance in [[Joel Schumacher]]'s superhero film ''[[Batman Forever]]''.<ref name="Vibe"/> In 1996, En Vogue recorded "[[Don't Let Go (Love)]]" for the soundtrack to the motion picture ''[[Set It Off (film)|Set It Off]]''. Released as the soundtrack's lead single in the fall 1996, it became the group's biggest hit yet, selling over 1.8 million copies worldwide and becoming certified platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref name="vibe1997">{{cite web|title=Holding On|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSPF0VG-zng| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/XSPF0VG-zng| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=1997-10-01|access-date=March 12, 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In response to the large commercial success of "Don't Let Go (Love)," the group worked on their third studio album.<ref name="vibe1997"/> As the album was nearing completion, Robinson chose to leave the group in march 1997 after contractual negotiations reached a stalemate.<ref name="vibe1997"/> Despite Robinson's abrupt departure, Ellis, Herron, and Jones continued on as a trio.<ref name="vibe1997"/>

Robinson's abrupt departure from En Vogue forced the remaining trio to re-record several of her original lead vocals on their forthcoming album ''[[EV3]]'', released in June 1997. A breakaway from previous projects, it marked En Vogue's first project to include a diverse roster of collaborators including credits from [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]], [[David Foster]], [[Diane Warren]], [[Andrea Martin (musician)|Andrea Martin]], and [[Ivan Matias]] along with regular contributors Foster and McElroy. Upon its release, ''EV3'' received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the band's vocal performances but were critical with overall production of the album. In the U.S., it debuted at number eight on both ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart and the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with sales of 76,500 units, the band's highest first-week numbers.<ref name="bb1">{{cite web|first=Datu|last=Faison|title=Rhythm Section|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQ4EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22EV3%22+%22EN+VOGUE%22&pg=PA20|date=1997-07-05|access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref> Two further singles released from the album, "[[Whatever (En Vogue song)|Whatever]]" and "[[Too Gone, Too Long]]", entered the top 20 and top 40 the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, respectively.<ref name="bb1"/>

In 1998, En Vogue recorded the song "[[No Fool No More]]" for the soundtrack to the film ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' (1998). A top 40 entry on the [[New Zealand Singles Chart]], it was later included on the band's first compilation album ''[[Best of En Vogue]]'', released in June 1999. A moderate success, the album reached the top 40 in Austria and the United Kingdom.

===2000–2003: ''Masterpiece Theatre'' and new member===
''[[Masterpiece Theatre (En Vogue album)|Masterpiece Theatre]]'', the group's fourth studio album, was released in May 2000. Their first project with [[Elektra Records]], the trio worked exclusively with their founders on the album who made heavy use of [[sample (music)|samples]] from classical music and traditional pop music to construct songs for recording.<ref name="bb1"/> Preceded by leading single "[[Riddle (En Vogue song)|Riddle]]", the album received a mixed reception from critics upon its release, who were divided by its overall sound, and became a commercial disappointment, reaching number 33 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart and number 67 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] only.<ref name="vibe2003">{{cite web|first=Ana|last=Martinez|title=Arithmetricks|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SYEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22MASTERPIECE+THEATRE%22+%22FLOPPED%22+%22EN+VOGUE%22&pg=PA64|date=May 1, 2003|access-date=March 10, 2018}}</ref> While ''Masterpiece Theatre'' and "Riddle" fared better in international territories, its poor performance resulted in the release of no further singles from the album and the band was soon dropped from the Elektra company.<ref name="vibe2003"/>

With Bennett, the trio began work on their sixth album ''[[Soul Flower]]''.

After failing to agree on business terms, Robinson once again chose to defect from En Vogue, and Bennett returned to complete the quartet. As a result, En Vogue was let go from the Firm and an album full of new original material did not materialize.<ref name="AcappellaNews"/> En Vogue continued to perform with Ellis, Herron, Jones, and Bennett on selected spot dates in North America, Europe, and Japan. During this time, they teamed with Flemish singer [[Natalia (Belgian singer)|Natalia Druyts]] on a remix version of her song "[[Glamorous (Natalia song)|Glamorous]]" which featured lead vocals by Bennett. Released as the second single from Druyts's third studio-album ''[[Everything and More (Natalia album)|Everything and More]]'' (2007), it reached number two on the [[Ultratop 50]] of the Flemish region of Belgium and launched the six-part ''Natalia Meets En Vogue feat.
