==Early life==
King was born Benjamin Earl Nelson on September 28, 1938, in [[Henderson, North Carolina]],<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> and moved to [[Harlem]], [[New York City|New York]], at the age of nine in 1947.<ref name="diesatage76">{{cite news|title='Stand By Me' singer Ben E.

==Career==
===The Drifters===
In 1958, King (still using his birth name) joined a doo-wop group called the Five Crowns.<ref name="NYT1"/> Later that year, the Drifters' manager [[George Treadwell]] fired the members of the original Drifters, and replaced them with the members of the Five Crowns.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Soul|url=http://souljoneswords.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/play-it-again-ben-ben-e-king-interview.html|title=Soul Jones Words: Play It Again, Ben - Ben E. King Interview|publisher=Souljoneswords.blogspot.co.uk|date=June 1, 2011|access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

King had a string of [[R&B]] hits with the group on [[Atlantic Records]]. He co-wrote and sang lead on the first Atlantic hit by the new version of the Drifters, "[[There Goes My Baby (The Drifters song)|There Goes My Baby]]" (1959). He sang lead on a succession of hits by the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]], including "[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]", "[[This Magic Moment]]", and "I Count the Tears".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> King recorded only thirteen songs with the {{nowrap|Drifters—}}two backing other lead singers and eleven lead vocal {{nowrap|performances—}}including a non-single called "Temptation" (later redone by Drifters vocalist [[Johnny Moore (musician)|Johnny Moore]]). The last of the King-led Drifters singles to be released was "Sometimes I Wonder", which was recorded May 19, 1960, but not issued until June 1962.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Marv|title=Marv Goldberg's R&B Notebooks: The Later Drifters|url=http://www.uncamarvy.com/DriftersLate/drifterslate.html|access-date=October 24, 2013}}</ref>

Due to contract disputes with Treadwell in which King and his manager, Lover Patterson, demanded greater compensation, King rarely performed with the Drifters on tour or on television. On television, fellow Drifters member [[Charlie Thomas (musician)|Charlie Thomas]] usually [[lip-synch]]ed the songs that King had recorded with the Drifters.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=About.com|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/soulmotown/p/In-The-Spotlight-Ben-E-King.htm|access-date=May 1, 2015|title=The Life and Times of Ben E.

===Solo career===
[[File:Ben E King Performing on the Final Day of the 2006 Summerfest.jpg|thumb|220px|King in 2006]]
In May 1960, King left the Drifters,<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> assuming the stage name Ben E. King in preparation for a solo career. Remaining with Atlantic Records on its [[Atco Records|Atco]] imprint, King scored his first solo hit with the ballad "[[Spanish Harlem (song)|Spanish Harlem]]" (1961).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

His next single, "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]", written with [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]], ultimately would be voted as one of the [[Songs of the Century]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. King cited singers [[Brook Benton]], [[Roy Hamilton]] and [[Sam Cooke]] as influences for his vocals of the song.<ref name=bbcobit>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32547474|title=Ben E King: R&B legend dies at 76|work=BBC News|date=May 1, 2015|access-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref> "Stand by Me", "There Goes My Baby", "Spanish Harlem", and "Save the Last Dance for Me" were all named in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockhall.com/exhibits/one-hit-wonders-songs-that-shaped-rock-and-roll/|publisher=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|title=Experience The Music: One Hit Wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll|access-date=May 1, 2015}}</ref> and each of those records has earned a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/music/obituaries-people-news/ben-e-king-dead-soul-singer-dies-stand-by-me-1201485566/|agency=Variety|title=Ben E.

In the summer of 1963, King had a Top 30 hit with "[[I (Who Have Nothing)]]", which reached the Top 10 on New York's radio station, [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/ben-e-king-soul-legend-sang-stand-dead-76-article-1.2206463|agency=The New York Daily News|title=Ben E.

King's records continued to place well on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart until 1965. British pop bands began to dominate the pop music scene, but King still continued to make R&B hits. Some of these hits include "What is Soul?", "Tears, Tears, Tears" , "So Much Love" , and "Til I Can't Take It Anymore". In 1975, King made a comeback on the top 40 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart with the Disco hit "[[Supernatural Thing (song)|Supernatural Thing]]". "Supernatural Thing" peaked at number 5 on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and peaked at number 1 on the Billboard R&B Charts. It was also nominated for a Grammy at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards in 1975 for "best R&B vocal performance, male". In 1977, King collaborated with [[Average White Band]] in releasing the album ''Benny & Us''. The album spawned two top 40 R&B hits, "A Star in the Ghetto" and "Get It Up".

King returned to the Drifters in late 1982 in England, and sang with them until the group's break-up and reorganization in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/king-ben-e-1938-2015/|title=BEN E. KING (1938-2015)|publisher=blackpast.org}}</ref> From 1983 until the band's break-up, the other members of this incarnation of the Drifters were Johnny Moore, Joe Blunt, and Clyde Brown.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

A 1986 re-issue of "Stand by Me" followed the song's use as the [[theme song]] to the movie ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' and re-entered the ''Billboard'' top ten after a 25-year absence. This reissue also reached Number 1 in the United Kingdom and Ireland for three weeks in February 1987.<ref name="NYT1"/> The reissue also made King the first act to reach the Hot 100's top 10 in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, either as a member of an act that reached that high (in this case, The Drifters) or as a solo act that did.<ref>[[Casey Kasem]], "[[American Top 40]]", 17 January 1987.</ref>

In 1990, King and [[Bo Diddley]], along with [[Doug Lazy]], recorded a revamped [[hip hop]] version of [[the Monotones]]' 1958 hit song "[[The Book of Love (The Monotones song)|Book of Love]]" for the [[soundtrack]] of the movie ''[[Book of Love (1990 film)|Book of Love]]''. He also recorded a children's album, ''[[I Have Songs In My Pocket]]'', written and produced by children's music artist [[Bobby Susser]] in 1998, which won the Early Childhood News Directors' Choice Award and Dr. Toy's/the Institute for Childhood Resources Award. King performed "Stand by Me" on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in 2007. [[Ahmet Ertegun]] said, "King is one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll and rhythm and blues."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beneking.info/index.cfm?TPID=2 |title=Ben E.
