'''Nuclear Assault''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band formed in New York City in 1984. Part of the mid-to-late 1980s thrash metal movement, they were one of the main bands of the genre to emerge from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] along with [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Whiplash (band)|Whiplash]], [[Toxik]], [[Carnivore (band)|Carnivore]], and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-a-z-of-anthrax|title=The A-Z of Anthrax|publisher=loudersound.com|date=October 28, 2016|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref> the latter was co-founded by Nuclear Assault bassist [[Dan Lilker]], who left Anthrax shortly after the release of [[Fistful of Metal|their first album]]. Nuclear Assault released five full-length albums and toured relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, and broke up in 1995. The band reunited briefly in 1997 and then permanently in 2002.

Nuclear Assault has released six studio albums to date, the latest being ''[[Third World Genocide]]'' (2005). Their most successful records are ''[[Survive (Nuclear Assault album)|Survive]]'' (1988) and ''[[Handle with Care (Nuclear Assault album)|Handle with Care]]'' (1989), which peaked at #145 and #126 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart respectively.<ref name="charthistory">{{cite magazine |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=nuclear assault|chart=all}} |title=Nuclear Assault Album & Song Chart History |access-date=December 21, 2012 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

==History==

===Early career (1984–1985)===
After the release of [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]'s debut album ''[[Fistful of Metal]]'', bassist [[Dan Lilker]], a founding member of the group, was fired by the band. He decided to pursue a more aggressive style of music and formed Nuclear Assault with guitarist/vocalist [[John Connelly (musician)|John Connelly]],<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5046|pure_url=yes}}|title=Nuclear Assault > Biography|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|author2=Franck, John |work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Macrovision]]|access-date=July 5, 2009}}</ref> who had been involved in an early version of Anthrax.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} They were joined by guitarist Mike Bogush and drummer Scott Duboys (later of Cities, [[Cycle Sluts from Hell]] and [[Warrior Soul]]).<ref name="Allmusic" /> They then recorded the first of two [[Demo (music)|demos]], which included the songs "Stranded in Hell", "The Plague", and "Hang the Pope".{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

The group's first live performance was at the Union Jack in [[South River, New Jersey]] in late 1984.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Guitarist Mike Bogush was later replaced by Anthony Bramante.<ref name="Allmusic" /> Bramante's first live performance with the group was at [[L'Amour (venue)|L'Amour]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York in April 1985.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Shortly after the performance, Duboys left the band and was replaced by drummer Glenn Evans formerly of New Jersey-based band [[T.T. Quick]].<ref name="Allmusic" />

===First three albums and rise to fame (1986–1990)===
The second demo ''Live Suffer Die'' was recorded and the band began touring the United States consistently. The band signed a multi-album contract with [[Combat Records]] and recorded the ''[[Game Over (Nuclear Assault album)|Game Over]]'' album in April 1986, released to critical acclaim later that year.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} [[Game Over (Nuclear Assault album)|''Game Over'']] was followed by an extended play called [[The Plague (Nuclear Assault EP)|''The Plague'']], which was released to coincide with a 1987 European tour with [[Agent Steel]] and [[Atomkraft]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metallipromo.com/na.html|title=Nuclear assault tour history with flyers|website=www.metallipromo.com|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> Later, feeling constrained by their contract with Combat, the band signed with [[I.R.S. Records]] and recorded ''[[Survive (Nuclear Assault album)|Survive]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bsnpubs.com/aandm/irs.html|title=I.R.S. label history|website=www.bsnpubs.com|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> The album reached number 145 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=nuclear assault|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History - Nuclear Assault|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|access-date=July 6, 2009}}</ref> and Nuclear Assault set off on a 180-day world tour<ref name=":0" /> in the United States and Europe; first as an opening act for [[Slayer]] and later headlining with British group [[Acid Reign]] as a support act.<ref name="MusicMight">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/new+york/new+york+city/nuclear+assault|title=Nuclear Assault biography|last=Sharpe-Young|first=Garry|publisher=[[MusicMight]]|access-date=July 6, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530134435/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/new+york/new+york+city/nuclear+assault|archive-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref> The next album, 1989's ''[[Handle with Care (Nuclear Assault album)|Handle with Care]]'', would see the band at their commercial peak, hitting the US chart at number 126,<ref name="Billboard" /> and peaking in the [[UK Albums Chart]] at No.&nbsp;60,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

===Two more albums, departure of Dan Lilker and split (1991–1995)===
Constant touring and recording was taking its toll on the band, and there was a rumor that the band might split.<ref>{{Citation|last=Roman Muster|title=Nuclear Assault Interview 1992|date=March 27, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7q2VUsHyVY|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> The recording of ''[[Out of Order (Nuclear Assault album)|Out of Order]]'' was problematic as all 4 members were in the process of making solo projects.<ref>{{Citation|last=Simon Morris|title=Nuclear Assault - Dan Lilker interviewed plus clips (1991)|date=September 8, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0hnigxfo30|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> Lead songwriter [[John Connelly (musician)|John Connelly]] was conspicuously absent from the recording process.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} He only sang on five of the songs and played the guitar on one (Quocustodiat his only full writing credit), leaving Evans and Lilker to do most of the recording alone.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} ''Out of Order'' was poorly received and during the subsequent tour in 1991–1992 there was some line up shuffling – John Connelly moved to vocals only for a time with second guitarist Dave DiPietro joining in 1992. Founding member [[Dan Lilker]] departed to concentrate on [[Brutal Truth]] and longtime guitarist Anthony Bramante followed by the end of the year.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Undaunted, Connolly Evens and DiPietro recorded the ''Something Wicked'' for IRS/EMI in 1993 with new bassist Scott Metaxas, the title track featuring in the film ''[[Warlock: The Armageddon]]''. Reviews again were somewhat unfavourable, as Nuclear Assault struggled to adapt to a less thrash friendly music scene.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} After touring Europe and the US for much of 1993 the band returned with a new line up of Dave Spitz on bass and a returning Anthony Bramante,<ref>{{Citation|last=NuclearAssaultVideos|title=Nuclear Assault "Behind Glass Walls" Unreleased Video 1995|date=April 22, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN0UJ3ZgFOQ|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> joining Connelly and Evens for more North American touring before slowly coming to a halt in early 1995.The band contributed their take on ''Die Hard'' for a Venom tribute album in 1995 before calling it a day.

Nuclear Assaults classic lineup later reunited for one concert in 1997 (put on by Eric Paone of 'Candy Striper Death Orgy' in [[New Hampshire]]) then, two more shows the following year with Eric Paone on bass guitar in New England before parting ways a second time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nuclear-assault/1997/the-colosseum-coventry-england-5bfb2f28.html|title=Nuclear Assault Setlist at The Colosseum, Coventry|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nuclear-assault/1998/sir-morgans-cove-worcester-ma-bc3f9ea.html|title=Nuclear Assault Setlist at Sir Morgans Cove, Worcester|website=setlist.fm|language=en|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>

===Nuclear Assault in the 21st century (2000–present)===
The classic line up reformed once again in 2002 to perform at the Metal Meltdown and Wacken festivals<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/Interviews/NUCLEAR-ASSAULT--7032.html|title=NUCLEAR ASSAULT - www.voicesfromthedarkside.de|website=www.voicesfromthedarkside.de|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> and subsequently recorded a live album entitled ''[[Alive Again (Nuclear Assault album)|Alive Again]]'', Bramante leaving for the last time and adding guitarist Eric Burke in time for several European tours, first with [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Death Angel]] in, then with [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and [[Agent Steel]] both in 2003.<ref name="MusicMight" /> A new studio album entitled ''[[Third World Genocide]]'' followed in 2005, with yet more touring, including a South American tour with Death Angel.<ref name="MusicMight" /> and a headlining European tour. The band released the ''Louder, Faster, Harder'' DVD before more US touring in 2006.

From 2007-2012 nuclear assault occasionally played shows, returning to Japan and South America along with a guest appearance at the [[Maryland Deathfest]] and at the Metal Merchants Festival in [[Oslo]], Norway, in January 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eternal-terror.com/articles/index.php?id=727&type=B|title=ETERNAL TERROR - NUCLEAR ASSAULT - Danny Lilker|website=www.eternal-terror.com|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>

In 2013, it was announced that Nuclear Assault was working on a new album, which was due for release in 2015. They released an EP on June 1, 2015, titled ''[[Pounder (EP)|Pounder]]'', which featured "four killer old-school thrash" songs written by [[Dan Lilker]] and [[John Connelly (musician)|John Connelly]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nuclear Assault To Release 'Pounder' EP In June|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nuclear-assault-to-release-pounder-ep-in-june/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=March 22, 2015|access-date=March 22, 2015}}</ref> The band embarked on the "Final Assault" tour to support the EP in 2015-16.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nuclear Assault To Release New Studio Album, Embark On 'Final Assault'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nuclear-assault-to-release-new-studio-album-embark-on-final-assault/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=August 22, 2014|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> Despite this, Nuclear Assault still performs live with new drummer [[Nicholas Barker|Nic Barker]] making special appearances and travelling to countries they have not previously played.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.songkick.com/artists/54963-nuclear-assault/gigography|title=Nuclear Assault Gigography|work=songkick.com|access-date=August 21, 2018}}</ref>
