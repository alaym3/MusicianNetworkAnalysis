===Early years===
[[Richard Henshall]], Matthew Marshall, and Ross Jennings had grown up as friends in their teenage years and first had the idea to form Haken in 2004, when they would regularly play together in "casual bedroom jams".<ref name="guitarguitar">{{cite interview|url=https://www.guitarguitar.co.uk/news/140576/|first=Richard|last=Henshall|title=The guitarguitar Interview: Haken|date=18 January 2019|work=guitarguitar|access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> Henshall mentioned on some occasions that "Haken" was the name of a fictional character he and some friends came up with in their school days,<ref name="guitarguitar"/> under the influence of alcohol<ref name=ProgSphere/> or weed.<ref name=DPRP>{{cite web|last1=Francis|first1=Basil|title=Haken (Richard Henshall)|url=http://www.dprp.net/wp/interviews/?page_id=1787|website=Dutch Progressive Rock Page|access-date=15 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622032905/http://www.dprp.net/wp/interviews/?page_id=1787|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the time the three considered the jams as a hobby, but they eventually chose to focus on studying their instruments and rejoined three years later to form the band.<ref name="guitarguitar"/> They completed their lineup with a keyboardist they met on an online forum, Peter Jones, as well as Jones' close friend Raymond Hearne.<ref name="sot">{{cite interview|url=https://www.seaoftranquility.org/article.php?sid=1565|title=Interview with Prog-Rock's Newest Sensations, Haken|interviewer=Pete Pardo|date=10 May 2010|first=Richard|last=Henshall|work=Sea of Tranquility|access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> [[To-Mera]] guitarist [[Thomas MacLean]] became the band's [[bassist]].<ref name="Allmusic biography">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/haken-mn0001369015/biography |title=Haken |first=Eduardo |last=Rivadavia |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref>

Haken recorded a [[demo album|demo]] in 2007, followed by a full-length demo titled ''Enter the 5th Dimension'' in 2008. Later that year, Marshall and Jones left the band to pursue other careers.
