==Early life and education==
Johnson was born and raised in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]] and attended [[Norman North High School]] where he graduated in 1999. He later attended the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]], where he studied history, but didn’t graduate.<ref name="WSJ"/> His goal was to later earn a law degree after completing his undergraduate studies. He began posting videos on YouTube during college. These videos were standard video blogs that Johnson published on a now-deleted channel. These early videos garnered a following of around 30 people.<ref name="Forbes1"/>

==Career==

===''Equals Three''===

Johnson began posting videos to his "Ray William Johnson" channel in April 2009. In 2011, the channel became YouTube's first to reach 5 million subscribers.<ref name="Forbes1"/> The channel had also attained nearly 2 billion total views.<ref name="WSJ"/> Originally, Johnson produced videos out of his [[New York City]] apartment, but, in 2011, he signed a deal with [[Maker Studios]] to produce videos on set in [[Culver City]], [[California]]. While at Maker Studios, Johnson produced a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-language version of the series, ''Igual a Tres'', and also produced a series of comedic animated music videos on a side channel called "Your Favorite Martian."<ref name="Forbes1"/><ref name="Forbes02">{{cite magazine | last=Humphrey| first=Michael| title =Maker Studios: The YouTube Savants Talk Channel Expansion| magazine = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]| date =7 November 2011 | url =https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2011/11/07/maker-studios-the-youtube-savants-talk-channel-expansion/| access-date =29 August 2015}}</ref>

In October 2012, Johnson announced that he would be leaving Maker Studios, contending that they had been pressuring him to sign a new contract that limited his access to his [[AdSense]] account and would reportedly take 40% of his earnings from the series. The contract also would have required Johnson to give up 50% of his [[intellectual property]] rights to the show and his other animated web project, ''Your Favorite Martian''.<ref name="TFSmith"/><ref name="BIMaker">{{cite web | last=Dickey| first=Megan Rose| title =This YouTube Star Is In The Middle Of A Very Ugly, Public Fight With His Studio| website = [[Business Insider]]| date =13 December 2012 | url =http://www.businessinsider.com/ray-william-johnson-fight-with-maker-studios-2012-12| access-date =27 August 2015}}</ref> In November 2012, Johnson founded his own production studio, Equals Three Studios, and continued producing ''Equals Three''.

===Other "Ray William Johnson" content===

Since his departure from ''Equals Three'', Johnson has continued producing comedic series for his main "Ray William Johnson" channel. These series included ''Booze Lightyear'', ''Top 6'', and ''Comedians On''.
