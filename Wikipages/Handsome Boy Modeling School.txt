==History==
Handsome Boy Modeling School was a conceptual hip hop duo that parodied and acted as a commentary on [[vanity|vain]], [[consumerism|consumerist]], [[economic materialism|materialistic]], and [[selfishness|self-absorbed]] members of [[upper class|upper class society]], such as [[supermodels]] and people from [[old money]]. The pair often satirized upper class [[snobbery]] and perceived beauty.

In 1999, they released the [[concept album]] ''[[So... How's Your Girl?]]'', which was loosely based on "The Prettiest Week of My Life", an episode of the [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Get a Life (American TV series)|Get a Life]]'' which starred [[Chris Elliott]]. The episode also contains the origin of the name Handsome Boy Modeling School, where Chris Elliott's character enrolls to become a [[male model]]. In the album, Dan and Paul assume the characters of Nathaniel Merriweather and Chest Rockwell, respectively. The Rockwell name is in reference to a pseudonym used by a porn star in 1997 film ''[[Boogie Nights]]''; the Merriweather name is likely an homage to the character Nathanial Mayweather, also played by Chris Elliott, in the 1994 comedic feature ''[[Cabin Boy]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://music.avclub.com/handsome-boy-modeling-school-so-hows-your-girl-1798193700|title=Handsome Boy Modeling School: So...

A number of guest musicians appear, including [[Róisín Murphy]] (one half of the duo [[Moloko]] at the time of the album's release), [[Del the Funky Homosapien]], [[J-Live]], [[Sean Lennon]], [[Miho Hatori]] (of [[Cibo Matto]]), [[Mike D]] (of the [[Beastie Boys]]) and [[Don Novello]] (as comic character [[Father Guido Sarducci]]).<ref name=":0" />

Their 1999 single "The Projects" in collaboration with [[David Jude Jolicoeur|Dave]] of [[De La Soul]] and Del the Funky Homosapien was featured in the 2001 film ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.what-song.com/Movies/Soundtrack/1640/Ocean-s-Eleven|title=Ocean's Eleven (2001) Soundtrack and Complete List of Songs|website=What-song|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref>

Their second album, ''[[White People (album)|White People]]'', was released in November 2004. Some collaborators from the first album returned, and new collaborators included [[RZA]], [[Cat Power]], [[Casual (rapper)|Casual]], [[Alex Kapranos]] of [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Chester Bennington]] and [[Mike Shinoda]] of [[Linkin Park]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]] of [[The Mars Volta]], [[Mike Patton]], [[El-P]], [[Pharrell]], [[John Oates]], [[Chino Moreno]], [[Lord Finesse]], [[Black Sheep (hip hop group)|Black Sheep]], and comedy actor [[Tim Meadows]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/albums/Handsome-boy-modeling-school/White-people|title=White People by Handsome Boy Modeling School|website=Genius|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref>
