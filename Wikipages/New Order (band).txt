'''New Order''' are <!-- Do not change to "is". "Are" is the correct grammar for UK English. See WP:ENGVAR. --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1980 by vocalist and guitarist [[Bernard Sumner]], bassist [[Peter Hook]] and drummer [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]]. The band formed after the demise of [[Joy Division]], following the suicide of lead singer [[Ian Curtis]]; they were joined by [[Gillian Gilbert]] on keyboards later that year. New Order's integration of [[post-punk]] with [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[dance music]] made them one of the most acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s.<ref>Ankeny, Jason. "[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5017|pure_url=yes}} New Order > Biography]". [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved on 24 August 2009.</ref> They were the flagship band for [[Manchester]]-based independent record label [[Factory Records]] and its nightclub [[The Haçienda]], and worked in long-term collaboration with graphic designer [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2011/may/29/joydivision-neworder|title=Peter Saville on his album cover artwork|newspaper=The Guardian|date=May 29, 2011|language=en|access-date=8 Feb 2019}}</ref>

While the band's early years were overshadowed by the legacy of Joy Division, their experience of the early 1980s [[New York City|New York]] club scene saw them increasingly incorporate dance rhythms and [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instrument]]ation into their work. Their 1983 hit "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]" became the best-selling [[12-inch single]] of all time and a popular [[club music|club]] track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/artists/new-order/biography|title=New Order Biography|work=XFM|access-date=28 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129230241/http://www.xfm.co.uk/artists/new-order/biography|archive-date=29 January 2013}}</ref> In the 1980s, they released successful albums such as ''[[Power, Corruption & Lies]]'' (1983), ''[[Technique (album)|Technique]]'' (1989), and the singles compilation ''[[Substance 1987|Substance]]'' (1987). They disbanded in 1993 to work on individual projects before reuniting in 1998. In the years since, New Order has gone through various hiatuses and personnel changes, most prominently the departure of Hook in 2007. They released their tenth studio album, ''[[Music Complete]]'', in 2015.

==History==

===Origins and formation: 1977–1980===
Between 1977 and 1980, [[Ian Curtis]], [[Peter Hook]], [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]], and [[Bernard Sumner]] were members of the post-punk band [[Joy Division]], often featuring heavy production input from producer [[Martin Hannett]].<ref>Rambali, Paul. "New Order". The Face, July 1983.</ref> Curtis took his own life on 18 May 1980, the day before Joy Division were scheduled to depart for their first American tour, and prior to the release of the band's second album, ''[[Closer (Joy Division album)|Closer]]''. The rest of the band decided soon after Curtis's death that they would carry on.<ref>Savage, Jon. "Joy Division: Someone Take These Dreams Away." ''Mojo''. July 1994.</ref> Prior to his death, the members of Joy Division had agreed not to continue under the Joy Division name should any one member leave. On 29 July 1980, the still unnamed trio debuted live at Manchester's Beach Club.<ref>Flowers, Claude. ''New Order + Joy Division: Dreams Never End.'' London: Omnibus Press, 1995. Pg. 44.</ref><ref>Johnson, Mark. ''An Ideal For Living: An History Of Joy Division.'' London: Bobcat Books, 1984. Pg. 69.</ref><ref>Middles, Mick. ''From Joy Division to New Order: The Factory Story.'' London: Virgin Books, 1996. Pg. 160.</ref> [[Rob Gretton]], the band's manager for over 20 years, is credited for having found the name New Order in an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' titled "The People's New Order of Kampuchea". The band adopted this name, despite its previous use for former [[The Stooges|Stooge]] [[Ron Asheton]]'s band [[The New Order (band)|The New Order]]. The group states that the name [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]] (as was also the case with [[Joy Division|"Joy Division"]]) does not draw a direct line to [[National Socialism]] or [[Fascism]].<ref name="story">''NewOrderStory'' [DVD]. Warner Bros., 2005.</ref>

The band rehearsed with each member taking turns on vocals. Sumner ultimately took the role, as he could sing when he wasn't playing his guitar. They wanted to complete the line-up with someone they knew well and whose musical skill and style was compatible with their own. Gretton suggested<ref name="story" /> Morris's girlfriend [[Gillian Gilbert]], and she was invited to join the band in early October 1980, as keyboardist and guitarist. Her first live performance with the band occurred at The Squat in Manchester on 25 October 1980.<ref>Flowers, Claude. ''New Order + Joy Division: Dreams Never End.'' London: Omnibus Press, 1995. Pg. 46.</ref><ref>Johnson, Mark. ''An Ideal For Living: An History Of Joy Division.'' London: Bobcat Books, 1984. Pg. 74.</ref>

===''Movement'': 1981–1982===
The initial release as New Order was the single "[[Ceremony (New Order song)|Ceremony]]", backed with "In a Lonely Place". These two songs were written in the weeks before Curtis took his own life.<ref name="story" /> With the release of ''[[Movement (New Order album)|Movement]]'' in November 1981, New Order initially started on a similar route as their previous incarnation, performing dark, melodic songs, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers. The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis' death. Hook commented that the only positive thing to come out of the ''Movement'' sessions was that producer [[Martin Hannett]] had showed the band how to use a mixing board, which allowed them to produce records by themselves from then on.<ref>Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984''. Penguin, 2005. Pg. 276. {{ISBN|0-14-303672-6}}</ref> More recently, Hook indicated a change of heart: "I think ''Movement'' gets a raw deal in general really – for me, when you consider the circumstances in which it was written, it is a fantastic record."<ref>{{cite web|last=Todd |first=C |title=Peter Hook: the Movement and Power, Corruption and Lies interview |website=Thedumbingofamerica.net |date=27 August 2013 |url=http://www.thedumbingofamerica.net/2013/08/27/peter-hook-the-movement-and-power-corruption-and-lies-interview/ |access-date=17 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108141738/http://www.thedumbingofamerica.net/2013/08/27/peter-hook-the-movement-and-power-corruption-and-lies-interview/ |archive-date=8 January 2014 }}</ref>

New Order visited New York City again in 1981, where the band were introduced to [[post-disco]], [[Freestyle music|freestyle]] and [[Electro (music)|electro]].<ref>Reynolds, pg. 275</ref> The band had taken to listening to [[Italo disco|Italian disco]] to cheer themselves up, while Morris taught himself drum programming.<ref>Reynolds, pg. 276</ref> The singles that followed, "[[Everything's Gone Green]]" and "[[Temptation (New Order song)|Temptation]]", saw a change in direction toward dance music.

[[The Haçienda]], [[Factory Records]]' own nightclub (largely funded by New Order) opened in May 1982 in Manchester and was even issued a Factory catalogue number: FAC51. The opening of UK's first ever [[superclub]] was marked by a nearly 23-minute instrumental piece originally entitled "Prime 5 8 6",<ref name="Johnson, Mark 1984. Pg. 103">Johnson, Mark. ''An Ideal For Living: An History Of Joy Division.'' London: Bobcat Books, 1984. Pg. 103.</ref> but released 15 years later as "[[Video 5 8 6]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/archive/history/ |title=Touch Archive, History |website=Touchmusic.org.uk |access-date=15 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608160345/http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/archive/history/ |archive-date=8 June 2011  }}</ref> Composed primarily by Sumner and Morris, "Prime 5 8 6"/"Video 5 8 6" was an early version of "5 8 6" that contained rhythm elements that would later surface on "Blue Monday" and "Ultraviolence".<ref name="Johnson, Mark 1984.

===''Power, Corruption & Lies'': 1983–1984===
{{Listen

''[[Power, Corruption & Lies]]'', released in May 1983, was a synthesiser-based outing and a dramatic change in sound from [[Joy Division]] and the preceding album, although the band had been hinting at the increased use of technology during the music-making process for a number of years then, including their work as Joy Division. Starting from what earlier singles had hinted, this was where the band had found their footing, mixing early techno music with their earlier guitar-based sound and showing the strong influence of acts like [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]]. Even further in this direction was the electronically sequenced, [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] single "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]". Inspired by [[Klein + M.B.O.]]'s "[[Dirty Talk (Klein + M.B.O. song)|Dirty Talk]]" and [[Sylvester James|Sylvester]]'s [[disco]] classic, "[[You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niagara.edu/neworder/singles/bm.html |title=New Order:Singles:Blue Monday |website=Niagara.edu |access-date=15 May 2011}}</ref> "Blue Monday" became the best-selling independent [[12-inch single|12" single]] of all time in the UK; however, (much to the chagrin of the buying public) it was not on the track list of ''[[Power, Corruption & Lies]]''. The song was included however on the cassette format in some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, and on the original North American CD release of the album, alongside its B-side, "The Beach". "Blue Monday" was also included on the 2008 collector's edition of ''Power, Corruption & Lies''.

The 1983 single "[[Confusion (New Order song)|Confusion]]" firmly established the group as a dance music force, inspiring many musicians in subsequent years. In 1984 they followed the largely synthesised single "Thieves Like Us" with the heavy guitar-drum-bass rumble of "Murder", a not-too-distant cousin of "Ecstasy" from the ''Power, Corruption & Lies'' album. KROQ Los Angeles DJ [[Jed the Fish]] claims New Order had more to do with the emergence of house music than the Warehouse music of Chicago and "Frankie Knuckles and the whole so-called House music scene. Unless you were actually from regional Chicago, had you ever heard of House music until New Order? Be real, now."

===''Low-Life'', ''Brotherhood'', and ''Substance'': 1985–1987===
1985's ''[[Low-Life]]'' refined and sometimes mixed the two styles, guitar-based and electronic, and included "[[The Perfect Kiss]]"—the video for which was filmed by [[Jonathan Demme]]—and "[[Sub-culture (song)|Sub-culture]]". In February 1986, the [[Pretty in Pink (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] to ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'' featuring "[[Shellshock (song)|Shellshock]]" was released on [[A&M Records]]. An instrumental version of "[[Thieves Like Us (song)|Thieves Like Us]]" and the instrumental "[[Elegia (New Order song)|Elegia]]" appeared in the film but were not on the soundtrack album. Later that summer, New Order headlined a line-up that included [[the Smiths]], [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], and [[A Certain Ratio]] during the [[Festival of the Tenth Summer]] at Manchester's [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|G-Mex]].<ref>Middles, Mick. ''From Joy Division to New Order: The Factory Story''. London: Virgin Books, 1996. Pg. 252. {{ISBN|0-7535-0041-8}}</ref>

''[[Brotherhood (New Order album)|Brotherhood]]'' (1986) divided the two approaches onto separate album sides. The album notably featured "[[Bizarre Love Triangle]]" (a Top 20 hit in Australia and New Zealand) and "Angel Dust" (of which a remixed instrumental version is available on the UK "True Faith" CD video single, under the title "Evil Dust"), a track which marries a synth break beat with ''Low-Life''-era guitar effects. While New Order toured North America with friends [[Echo & the Bunnymen]], the summer of 1987 saw the release of the compilation ''[[Substance 1987|Substance]]'', which featured the new single "[[True Faith (song)|True Faith]]". ''Substance'' was an important album in collecting the group's 12-inch singles onto CD for the first time and featured new versions of "Temptation" and "Confusion"—referred to as "Temptation '87" and "Confusion '87". A second disc featured several of the B-sides from the singles on the first disc, as well as additional A-sides "Procession" and "Murder". The single, "True Faith", with its surreal video, became a hit on MTV and the band's first American top 40 hit. The single's B-side, "[[Nineteen63|1963]]"—originally planned on being the A-side until the group's label convinced them to release "True Faith" instead—would later be released as a single in its own right several years later, with two new versions.

In December 1987, the band released a further single, "[[Touched by the Hand of God]]", with a [[Kathryn Bigelow]]-directed video parodying [[Glam metal|glam-metal]]. The song was one of four new tracks recorded for the American comedy film ''[[Salvation! (1987 film)|Salvatation!]]'', and reached number 20 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number 1 in the [[UK Independent Singles and Albums Charts|UK Independent Singles]] chart. However, it would not appear on an album until the 1994 compilation ''[[The Best of New Order]]''.

===''Technique'', ''Republic'' and first break-up: 1988–1993===
By this time, the group was heavily influenced by the [[Balearic house|Balearic]] sounds of [[Ibiza]], which were making their way into the Haçienda. Partly recorded at Mediterranean Sound studios on Ibiza, ''[[Technique (album)|Technique]]'' was released in February 1989. The album entered the charts at number one in the UK and contained a mix of acid house influence (as on opening track "[[Fine Time]]") and a more traditional rock sound (as on the single "[[Run 2]]"). The album is a blend of upbeat, accessible music coupled with blunt, poignant lyrics. During the summer of 1989, New Order supported ''Technique'' by touring with [[Public Image Ltd]], [[Throwing Muses]] and [[the Sugarcubes]] across the United States and Canada in what the press dubbed the "Monsters of Alternative Rock" tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8128737.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730202721/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8128737.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 July 2018|title=NEW ORDER IS HOLDING STEADY, PIL GOING STALE - The Boston Globe (Boston, MA) {{pipe}} HighBeam Research|date=30 July 2018}}</ref> Around this time, band members also began side projects including [[Electronic (band)|Electronic]] (Sumner with [[Johnny Marr]]) and [[Revenge (UK band)|Revenge]] (Hook with [[Davyth Hicks]]). Morris and Gilbert began to work together on outside TV theme production work. In 1991, the band were sued by the publishing company of American singer [[John Denver]], who alleged that the guitar break in "Run 2" was similar to his song "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]".<ref>{{cite web |first=Bob |last=Mack |title=Plane Tiff | work=Entertainment Weekly |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312964,00.html |date=1991-01-11 |access-date=2011-08-19}}</ref> The case was settled out of court and the song has since been credited to both New Order and John Denver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niagara.edu/neworder/singles/run2.html |title=New Order:Singles:Run 2 |website=Niagara.edu |access-date=2 October 2016}}</ref>

In 1990, New Order recorded the official song of the [[England national football team]]'s 1990 [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] campaign, "[[World in Motion]]", under the ad hoc band name EnglandNewOrder. The song, co-written with comedian [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]], was the band's sole number one UK hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/number-1-in-1990-england-new-order-set-the-world-in-motion__9782/|title=Number 1 in 1990: England & New Order set the World In Motion|access-date=11 July 2016}}</ref> The song was originally planned to be titled "E for England", however [[the Football Association]] vetoed the title upon realising that this was a reference to [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]]; a drug heavily associated with the Haçienda. (Allen claimed that his original draft lyrics included "E is for England, England starts with E / We'll all be [[Ecstasy Tablet|smiling]] when we're in Italy."<ref name="'World In Motion' 25 Years On">{{cite web|title='World In Motion' 25 Years On|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/world-in-motion-25-years-on-10-geeky-facts-about-the-new-order-football-classic|website=NME|date=9 June 2015|access-date=2 October 2015}}</ref>) The song also featured chanting from members of the England team and Allen, and a guest rap from England player [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]]. It was again produced by Stephen Hague, who the band chose to produce their next album.

The band's next album ''[[Republic (album)|Republic]]'' was shadowed by the collapse of their longtime label [[Factory Records]]. The label had been ailing due to financial difficulties, and was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msimanchester.org.uk/en/collection/stories/factory-records|title=Factory Records {{!}} Museum of Science and Industry|website=Museum of Science and Industry|access-date=11 July 2016}}</ref> New Order never had a formal contract with Factory. Although unusual for a major group, this was Factory's standard practice until the mid-1980s. Because of this, the band, rather than Factory Records, legally owned all of their recordings. This has been cited by Wilson himself<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6941846.stm|title=How Tony Wilson changed music|date=14 August 2007|newspaper=BBC|access-date=11 July 2016}}</ref> as the main reason [[London Records]]' 1992 offer to buy the ailing label fell through. Following Factory's collapse, New Order signed with London, as did Morris and Gilbert separately for their side project [[The Other Two (duo)|The Other Two]], whose [[The Other Two & You|debut album]] was originally intended for release on Factory. ''Republic'', released around the world in 1993, spawned the singles "[[Regret (New Order song)|Regret]]"—New Order's highest-charting single in the US—"[[Ruined in a Day]]", "[[World (The Price of Love)|World]]", and "[[Spooky (New Order song)|Spooky]]".

Following the release and promotion of ''Republic'', the band put New Order on hold while focusing on side projects; with [[The Other Two (duo)|The Other Two]]'s debut album released in 1993. In 1994, a second singles collection was released, entitled ''[[The Best of New Order]]''. It featured all of the band's singles since ''Substance'' as well as a few extra tracks: "Vanishing Point" (from 1989's ''Technique''), "The Perfect Kiss", "Thieves Like Us", "Shellshock", and remixes of "True Faith", "Bizarre Love Triangle", "1963", and "Round & Round". The new versions of "True Faith" and "1963" (the latter as a more guitar-oriented version produced by [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]) were released as singles to promote the album. In the US, the track listing was altered to set it apart from ''Substance'' as well as the UK release of ''The Best of New Order'' which had been available months prior. This collection was followed by a remix album, ''[[The Rest of New Order]]'', featuring a selection of existing and newly commissioned mixes of classic New Order tracks. Some versions contained an extra disc or cassette composed entirely of remixes of "Blue Monday". "Blue Monday" was released as a single for a third time to promote the collection.

===Reformation and ''Get Ready'': 1998–2003===
The group reconvened in 1998 at the suggestion of Rob Gretton. Nearly five years had passed since they had last seen each other. Sumner said, "We decided before we agreed to doing any gig, to have a meeting, and if anyone had any grudges to bear, to iron them out."<ref>{{cite web|title = Love Will Bring Us Together|url = http://www.neworderonline.com/Common/Topic.aspx?Topic=Article020|website = www.neworderonline.com|access-date = 8 November 2015|last = Raub|first = Kevin}}</ref> By the second meeting everyone agreed to continue playing, scheduling their reunion gig for the Phoenix Festival that same year. In addition to rarer songs, New Order also decided to begin playing Joy Division songs again.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=Raub, Kevin | title = Love Will Bring Us Together | magazine=RollingStone.com | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/neworder/articles/story/5926606/love_will_bring_us_together | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071202133130/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/neworder/articles/story/5926606/love_will_bring_us_together | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2 December 2007 | date = 24 March 1998| access-date=19 April 2007}}</ref> When the Phoenix Festival was cancelled due to low ticket sales, New Order instead played the last night of that year's [[Reading Festival]].<ref>{{cite news | title =Phoenix called off due to poor ticket sales | website=BBC.co.uk | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/110429.stm | date = 10 June 1998| access-date=22 April 2007}}</ref>

Their 2001 release ''[[Get Ready (New Order album)|Get Ready]]'' largely departed from their more electronic style and focused on more guitar oriented music. According to Sumner, "''Get Ready'' was guitar-heavy simply because we felt that we'd left that instrument alone for a long time."<ref>{{cite web | author=Gregory, James | title=New Order Reveal Details of Next Full-Length | website=PitchforkMedia.com | url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/33980-new-order-reveal-details-of-next-full-length | date=24 January 2005 | access-date=22 April 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222051418/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/33980-new-order-reveal-details-of-next-full-length | archive-date=22 December 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Longtime fan [[Billy Corgan]] of [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] played guitar and sang back-up on the track "Turn My Way," and in 2001 toured with the band on dates in the UK, US, and Japan for a short period of time. Phil Cunningham (formerly of Marion) joined the band in a live capacity, deputising for Gilbert who declined to tour in favour of caring for her and Morris' children. [[Primal Scream]]'s [[Bobby Gillespie]] provided vocals on the track "Rock the Shack". Singles from the album included "[[Crystal (song)|Crystal]]," "[[60 Miles an Hour]]" and [[Someone Like You (New Order song)|Someone Like You]]."

In 2002, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' featured New Order on their list of the "50 Bands to See Before You Die",<ref>{{cite web|title = Rocklist.net...Q Magazine Lists|url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html#Die%E2%80%A6|website = www.rocklistmusic.co.uk|access-date = 8 November 2015}}</ref> although this was as part of a sub-list of "5 Bands That Could Go Either Way". Both New Order and Joy Division were portrayed in the [[Michael Winterbottom]] film ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', depicting the rise and fall of Factory Records as seen through the eyes of label founder [[Tony Wilson]]. Cameos by Wilson himself, along with [[Mark E. Smith]] of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]] and former members of [[Happy Mondays]] and [[Inspiral Carpets]], lent a degree of legitimacy to the proceedings. The film touched on some of Factory's other artists, including [[Happy Mondays]] and [[the Durutti Column]]. The soundtrack featured the new track "[[Here to Stay (New Order song)|Here to Stay]]," produced by the [[Chemical Brothers]], which was released as a single. The single's music video highlighted scenes taken from the film.

===''Waiting for the Sirens' Call'', ''Singles'' and second break-up: 2004–2007===
[[File:2005-06-11 New Order live.jpg|thumb|right|300px|New Order performing in 2005]]
The band released a new album on 27 March 2005, titled ''[[Waiting for the Sirens' Call]]'', their first with new member Phil Cunningham. Cunningham replaced Gilbert (now married to Morris) so she could look after their children. Singles from this album were "[[Krafty]]", "[[Jetstream (song)|Jetstream]]" (which features guest vocals by [[Ana Matronic]] from [[Scissor Sisters]]), and the [[Waiting for the Sirens' Call (song)|title track]]. At the 2005 [[NME Awards]], New Order and Joy Division received the award for "Godlike Geniuses" (for lifetime achievement). Previous winners include [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[the Clash]], and [[Happy Mondays]]. In 2006 the album track "Guilt Is a Useless Emotion" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]].

In the autumn of 2005, the group released another greatest hits compilation, in the form of ''[[Singles (New Order album)|Singles]]''. The two-disc release was an updated version of the ''Substance'' collection and contained every single released from their 1981 debut all the way through to "Waiting for the Sirens' Call". However, unlike ''Substance'', which focused almost exclusively on the 12" versions of the group's singles, ''Singles'' collected the 7" versions, many of which (like "Ceremony", "Temptation" and "Confusion") had never been released on CD. The album was accompanied by a two-disc DVD set, titled ''Item'', that collected the extended UK version of ''NewOrderStory'' with a DVD of all New Order music videos as well as two newly commissioned videos for "[[Temptation (New Order song)|Temptation '87]]" and "[[Ceremony (New Order song)|Ceremony]]".

The ''[[Live in Glasgow (New Order DVD)|New Order: Live in Glasgow]]'' DVD was recorded at the Glasgow Academy in 2006 and features 18 tracks, including 4 Joy Division songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=31278_0_2_0_C |title=Live in Glasgow DVD for New Order |website=Side-line.com |date=29 April 2008 |access-date=15 May 2011}}</ref> Next to that, the release also contains a bonus disc of footage from the band's personal archive including 1980s footage from Glastonbury (June 1981), Rome, Cork, Rotterdam and Toronto.

In 2006, the band played several one-off live dates as well as short tours in the UK, Brazil and Argentina. After their [[Buenos Aires]] show in November 2006, Peter Hook suggested that the band should stop touring.<ref>{{cite web | title =The end of New Order? | website=NewOrderOnline.com | url = http://www.neworderonline.com/News/News.aspx?NewsID=1284 | date = 26 November 2006| access-date=20 April 2007}}</ref> In early May 2007, Hook was interviewed by British radio station [[XFM]] – originally to talk about his contribution to the debut album of [[Jane's Addiction]] singer [[Perry Farrell]]'s new band [[Satellite Party]] – and stated that "Me and Bernard aren't working together." Further complicating the news, NewOrderOnline, a website with support from New Order management, reported that according to "a source close to the band", "The news about the split is false... New Order still exists despite what [Hook] said ... Peter Hook can leave the band, but this doesn't mean the end of New Order."<ref>{{cite web | author=NewOrderOnline.com | title=New Order did not split | url=http://www.neworderonline.com/News/News.aspx?NewsID=1305 | date=17 May 2007 | access-date = 18 May 2007}}</ref> However, Sumner revealed in 2009 that he no longer wished to make music as New Order.<ref name="Mojo09">Wilkinson, Roy (August 2009).

On 22 September 2015, the band released a new album, ''[[Music Complete]]'', their first without [[Peter Hook]]. The album was produced mostly by the band themselves, except "Singularity" and "Unlearn This Hatred", both produced by Tom Rowlands, while "Superheated" features additional production by Stuart Price.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Order to release new album 'Music Complete' in September|url=http://www.neverenoughnotes.co.uk/2015/06/new-order-to-release-new-album-music-complete-in-september|access-date=22 June 2015|work=Never Enough Notes|publisher=Never Enough Notes|date=22 June 2015|ref=Never Enough Notes}}</ref>

In November 2015, Peter Hook sued Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert. In an objection, it was revealed that Sumner, Morris and Gilbert had set up a new company behind Hook's back, that it has generated an income of £7.8 million in four years while Hook received only a fraction of that. The three members argued they had treated Hook fairly and that his stake in the band's royalties was reasonable, despite the fact that in four years, Hook had only received "1.25 per cent of the band's royalties and other income from merchandising and performances". The judge ruled that there was "at least a reasonable prospect" of Hook proving that he was not getting a fair share of royalties and other income and rejected Sumner and Morris's lawyer argument. The judge was willing to hear the case but urged the parties to come to an agreement rather than suffer legal costs of around £900,000.<ref>[https://archive.today/20210604193524/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/12025791/Blue-Monday-for-New-Order-as-Peter-Hook-sues-them-for-many-millions-of-pounds.html  "Blue Monday for New Order as Peter Hook Sues The for Many Millions of Pounds"].

According to the band's official website, other stops on the tour included Cleveland, Ohio; Washington, DC; Toronto, Ontario; Long Beach, California; Kahului, Hawaii; and Honolulu, Hawaii. As of 24 August 2018, a single show in Santiago, Chile had been announced for 21 November 2018.

In January 2020, the band played a four night residency in Florida, and in February 2020, they announced a co-headlining tour in North America with the [[Pet Shop Boys]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neworder.com/newordernow/2020/2/24/the-unity-tour-2020.html |title=The Unity Tour 2020 |website=Neworder.com |date=2020-02-24 |access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> and that the only concert in the UK in 2020 would be at The O2 on 10 October.

==Other projects==
{{main|Electronic (band)|Bad Lieutenant (band)|Peter Hook and the Light|The Other Two (duo)|Monaco (band)}}
In 1988, Bernard Sumner teamed up with former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] guitarist [[Johnny Marr]] to form the group [[Electronic (band)|Electronic]], also enlisting the help of [[Neil Tennant]] and [[Chris Lowe]] of the [[Pet Shop Boys]]. Electronic regrouped in 1996 for ''[[Raise the Pressure]]'', which also featured [[Karl Bartos]] (formerly of [[Kraftwerk]]). The project's third album ''[[Twisted Tenderness]]'' was released in 1999 after which the band dissolved.

In June 2009, Sumner formed a new band called [[Bad Lieutenant (band)|Bad Lieutenant]] with [[Phil Cunningham (rock musician)|Phil Cunningham]] (guitar) and Jake Evans (guitar and vocals). Their album ''[[Never Cry Another Tear]]'' was released on 5 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=480755951&blogId=498683456 |title=Bad Lieutenant's Myspace Blog: Never Cry Another Tear |website=Blogs.myspace.com |date=5 July 2009 |access-date=15 May 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708022452/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=480755951&blogId=498683456 |archive-date=8 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition to Cunningham and Evans the album also features appearances by [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] (drums), [[Jack Mitchell (drummer)|Jack Mitchell]] (drums), Tom Chapman (bass) and [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]] (bass).

Peter Hook has been involved with several other projects. In the 1990s, Hook recorded with [[Killing Joke]] with a view to joining the band. However, original bassist [[Martin Glover|Martin 'Youth' Glover]] instead returned to the band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Hook Nearly Joined Killing Joke!|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/08320-killing-joke-peter-hook|date=5 September 1996|access-date=14 January 2013}}</ref> In 1995 he toured with [[the Durutti Column]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Durutti Column concert|url=http://www.mat.uc.pt/~rps/concerto_dc/index.html|date=5 September 1996|access-date=24 August 2008}}</ref> He has recorded one album with the band [[Revenge (UK band)|Revenge]] with Davyth Hicks and Chris Jones and two with [[Monaco (band)|Monaco]] (both as bassist, keyboardist and lead vocalist) with David Potts. Monaco scored a club and [[alternative rock|alternative]] radio hit with "What Do You Want From Me?" in 1997. Hook also formed a band called [[Freebass]] with fellow bass players [[Gary Mounfield|Mani]] ([[the Stone Roses]]) and [[Andy Rourke]] ([[the Smiths]]) and vocalist [[Gary Briggs (musician)|Gary Briggs]], which was active from 2007 to 2010. He also contributed to [[Perry Farrell]]'s [[Satellite Party]]. Hook's current band [[Peter Hook and the Light]] is touring [[Joy Division]] and New Order albums in their entirety.

In 1990 Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris formed their own band, [[The Other Two (duo)|The Other Two]]. The Other Two released its first single "Tasty Fish" in 1991 and released two albums, ''[[The Other Two & You]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Super Highways]]'' in 1999. They have also been involved in scoring television soundtracks, like ''[[Making Out (TV series)|Making Out]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ltmrecordings.com/the_other_two.html|title = The Other Two {{!}} Biography|date = December 2009|last = Nice|first = James}}</ref> In 2007, Gilbert and Morris remixed two tracks for the [[Nine Inch Nails]] remixes album ''[[Year Zero Remixed]]''.

===BeMusic===
"BeMusic" was a name the band used for their publishing company (the LP label for ''Movement'' says "B Music" in large letters, though using an [[italic type|italic]] [[ß]] for the letter [[B]]). All four members of the band used the name for production work for other artists' recordings between 1982 and 1985.<ref name="twice as nice">{{cite web|url=http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/ltmcd2398.html |title=Twice As Nice|website=Cerysmaticfactory.info |date=6 September 2004 |access-date=11 July 2011}}</ref>

The first BeMusic credit was for Peter Hook producing [[Stockholm Monsters]] in 1982. Other artists with producer or musician credit for "BeMusic" were [[52nd Street (band)|52nd Street]], [[Section 25 (band)|Section 25]], [[Marcel King]], [[Quando Quango]], [[Paul Haig]], [[Thick Pigeon]], [[Nyam Nyam (band)|Nyam Nyam]] and [[Life (band)|Life]].

Their production work as BeMusic was collected on two [[LTM Recordings]] compilation CDs, ''Cool As Ice: The BeMusic Productions''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ltmpub.freeserve.co.uk/bemusicnotes.html |title=New Order (as Be Music) CD sleevenotes at LTM |website=Ltmpub.freeserve.co.uk |access-date=11 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927074232/http://www.ltmpub.freeserve.co.uk/bemusicnotes.html |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and ''Twice As Nice'' (which also included production work by Donald Johnson, of [[A Certain Ratio]], and [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]).<ref name="twice as nice"/>

==Influences, style and legacy==
{{peacock|date=August 2017}}
New Order's music mixes rock with dance music, as can be seen on signature tracks such as 1982's "Temptation", 1983's "Blue Monday" and 1987's "True Faith". Founding member Hook stated that the band's shift from playing cold dark tracks from 1981 to producing electro/rock tracks from 1982 was inspired by the music of German electronic group [[Kraftwerk]], US rock band [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] who had produced disco/electro-rock music with producer [[Giorgio Moroder]] on their ''[[No. 1 in Heaven]]'' album, and also the Moroder/[[Donna Summer]] collaboration on "[[I Feel Love]]".<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Hook |title=Substance: Inside New Order |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2007}}</ref> Along with Kraftwerk, the English bands [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[the Human League]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD) educated singer Bernard Sumner that one "could make music without guitars".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.electronicbeats.net/max-dax-interviews-bernard-sumner/|title=Max Dax interviews Bernard Sumner|last=Dax|first=Max|date=2 September 2012|website=Electronic Beats|access-date=15 February 2021}}</ref> New Order's collaboration with New York DJ [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] was inspired by the records' sounds of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Hook |title=The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2011 |isbn=978-1847391773}}</ref>

According to a staff-written "[[Allmusic]]" history, the band are also regarded as "the first [[alternative dance]]" music group with their fusion of "used icy, gloomy [[post-punk]] with Kraftwerk-style [[Synthpop|synth-pop]]"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/alternative-dance-ma0000011883 | title=Alternative Dance | website=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=5 September 2014}}</ref> and were also labeled as synth-pop,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://pitchfork.com/news/35614-new-order-swap-peter-hook-for-blurs-alex-james-for-new-band-bad-lieutenant/ | title=New Order Swap Peter Hook for Blur's Alex James for New Band Bad Lieutenant | publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | date=15 June 2009 | access-date=5 September 2014 | author=Breihan, Tom}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABcc-gdqNZIC&q=new+order+%22synthpop%22&pg=PA26| isbn=978-1109192629 | title=Here We Go Again (again): The Eighties Nostalgia Movement in Contemporary Popular Culture | author=Cook, Jr., Philip C. | year=2009 | page=26}}</ref> post-punk,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/starsdontstandst00mcdo | url-access=registration | quote=new order post-punk. | title=Stars Don't Stand Still in the Sky: Music and Myth | year=1999 | publisher=NYU Press |author1=Kelly, Karen |author2=Evelyn McDonnell |name-list-style=amp | pages=[https://archive.org/details/starsdontstandst00mcdo/page/82 82] | isbn=0814747272}}</ref> [[new wave music|new wave]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundposts/2014/07/03/80s-new-wave-pioneers-new-order-to-play-paramount-concert-preview/ | title='80s New Wave pioneers New Order to play Paramount – Concert preview | newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=3 July 2014 | access-date=5 September 2014 | author=Albertson, Jeff}}</ref> [[dance-rock]]<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-new-order-hang-with-the-hoff-20140805 | title=Flashback: New Order Hang With the Hoff | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=5 August 2014 | access-date=5 September 2014 | author=Edwards, Gavin}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/inside-new-orders-triumphant-return-to-dance-rock-70593/|title=Inside New Order's Triumphant Return to Dance-Rock|first1=Kory|last1=Grow|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=23 September 2015}}</ref> and [[electronica]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music-live-electronica-veterans-move-with-the-times-1044355.html | title=Music: Live: Electronica veterans move with the times | work=[[The Independent]] | date=23 October 2011 | access-date=18 October 2015 | author=James, Martin}}</ref>

They have heavily influenced [[techno music|techno]], [[Rock music|rock]], and pop musicians including [[Moby]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Bernard Sumner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/arts/music/03play.html |title=Moby Meets New Order: New York Times, April&nbsp;3, 2005 |work=The New York Times |access-date=15 May 2011 |date=3 April 2005}}</ref> and were themselves influenced by the likes of [[David Bowie]] and [[Neu!]]. They have also significantly influenced [[electro (music)|electro]], [[Freestyle music|freestyle]] and [[House music|house]].  New Order's Kraftwerk influence was acknowledged by their single "[[Krafty]]", which had cover art referencing "[[Autobahn (song)|Autobahn]]".

Drummer Stephen Morris plays a mixture of acoustic and electronic drums, and in many cases plays along seamlessly with sequenced parts. All the band members could and did switch instruments throughout gigs, as evidenced on [[Jonathan Demme]]'s video for "The Perfect Kiss" and the concert videos ''Taras Shevchenko'' (recorded in New York, November 1981)<ref>{{cite web|url = http://factoryrecords.org/factory-records/fact-77-new-order-taras-shevchenko.php|title = Factory Records: FACT 77|website = factoryrecords.org}}</ref> and ''Pumped Full of Drugs'' (Tokyo, May 1985).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://factoryrecords.org/factory-records/fact-177-new-order-pumped-full-of-drugs.php|title = Factory Records: FACT 177|website = factoryrecords.org}}</ref> During such live gigs, Sumner alternated between guitar, keyboards, melodica and (on the track "Confusion") bass; Gilbert switched between keyboards and guitar, Morris between drums and keyboards, and Hook played both bass and electronic drums. ''Taras Shevchenko'' is also notable for the fact all four members of the group have left the stage before the final song, "Temptation", comes to a complete end.

=== Reputation ===
Both New Order and Joy Division were among the most successful artists on the Factory Records label, run by Granada television personality [[Tony Wilson]], and partnered with Factory in the financing of the Manchester club [[Fac 51 Haçienda|The Haçienda]]. Speaking in 2009, fellow synthpop musician [[Phil Oakey]] described New Order's slow-burn career as cult musicians as being unusually prolonged and effective: "If you want to make a lot of money out of pop, be number 3 a lot. Like New Order did."<ref name="Totally Wired: Postpunk Interviews and Overviews">{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|title=Totally Wired: Postpunk Interviews and Overviews|date=2 April 2009|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=9780571252299|pages=288–289}}</ref>

===Cover artwork===
Almost all New Order recordings bear minimalist packaging, art directed by [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]]. The group's record sleeves bucked the 1980s trend by rarely showing the band members (with the exception of the ''Low-Life'' album) or even providing basic information such as the band name or title of the release. Song names were often hidden within the shrink wrapped package, either on the disc itself (such as the "Blue Monday" single), on an inconspicuous part of an inner sleeve ("The Perfect Kiss" single), or written in a cryptic colour code invented by Saville (''Power, Corruption & Lies''). Saville said his intention was to sell the band as a "mass-produced secret" of sorts, and that the minimalist style was enough to allow fans to identify the band's products without explicit labelling.<ref name="story" /> Saville frequently sent the artwork straight to the printer, unreviewed by either the band or the label.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://the-talks.com/interviews/peter-saville/ |title= Peter Saville: "I never had to answer to anyone" |work= The Talks |date= 22 May 2013 |access-date= 20 July 2013 |quote= New Order didn't approve it, they rarely saw it. More often than not they would go directly from me; "Blue Monday" for example went directly from me to the printer.}}</ref>
