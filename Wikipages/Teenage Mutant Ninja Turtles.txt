'''''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''''', also known as '''''Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles''','' is an entertainment franchise created in 1983 by American comic book authors [[Peter Laird]] and [[Kevin Eastman]]. It follows [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], four [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] turtle brothers trained in [[ninjitsu]] who fight evil in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Harvey R.|date=April 15, 1990|title=Just How Powerful Are Those Turtles?|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/15/movies/just-how-powerful-are-those-turtles.html?scp=8&sq=ninja%20turtles&st=cse|access-date=August 7, 2010}}</ref>

Eastman and Laird conceived the characters as a parody of elements popular in [[superhero comics]] at the time. In 1984, they founded [[Mirage Studios]] and self-published the first issue of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' in 1984; it was a surprise success. They licensed the characters to [[Playmates Toys]], who developed a [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures|line of ''Turtles'' action figures]]. About $1.1 billion USD of ''Turtles'' toys were sold between 1988 and 1992, making them the third-bestselling toy figures ever at the time.

The action figures were promoted with the first [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|''Turtles'' animated series]], which premiered in 1987 and ran for almost a decade. In some European regions, the word "ninja" in the name was replaced with "hero" for its violent connotations. Three live-action films were released in the 1990s; the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|first film]] became the highest-grossing [[independent film]] up to that point. In 2009, the ''Turtles'' franchise was purchased by [[Nickelodeon]], a subsidiary of [[ViacomCBS|Viacom]]. Viacom commissioned a [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW Publishing)|new comic series]], two new live-action films, and new animated series.

=== 1983–1986: Conception and first comics ===
Comic book authors [[Kevin Eastman]] and [[Peter Laird]] met in Massachusetts and began working on illustrations together. In 1983, Laird invited Eastman to move in with him in [[Dover, New Hampshire]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|last=Fernandes|first=Megan|title=The birthplace of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'': Kevin Eastman recalls days in Dover|url=https://www.fosters.com/story/news/local/2021/07/27/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-kevin-eastman-dover-nh-origins-portsmouth-mini-con-peter-laird/7970644002/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-17|website=[[Foster's Daily Democrat]]|language=en-US}}</ref> That November, Eastman drew a masked turtle standing on its hind legs armed with [[Nunchaku|nunchucks]].''<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|date=2015-06-27|title=The complete history of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30862/complete-history-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-17|website=[[Mental Floss]]|language=en}}</ref>'' Laird added the words "teenage mutant".<ref name=":7" /> The concept parodied several elements popular in [[superhero comics]] of the time: the mutants of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]],'' the teenagers of ''[[New Teen Titans]]'' and the ninjas of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', combined with the comic tradition of [[funny animals]] such as ''[[Howard the Duck]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine|last=Collins|first=Sean T.|date=2014-08-14|title=Cowabunga: how ''TMNT'' went from joke to blockbuster|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/how-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-went-from-in-joke-to-blockbuster-230484/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-09|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

Developing the concept into a comic book, Eastman and Laird considered giving the turtles Japanese names, but instead named them [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] after the [[Italian Renaissance]] artists. Laird said the names "felt just quirky enough to fit the concept".<ref name=":6" /> They developed a backstory referencing further elements of ''Daredevil'': whereas [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] gains his superpowers through exposure to radioactive material, the turtles mutate into humanoid heroes; the Turtles' [[sensei]], [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], is a play on Daredevil's sensei, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]].<ref name=":0" />

In March 1984, Eastman and Laird founded a comic book company, [[Mirage Studios]], in their home.<ref name=":6" /> Using money from a tax refund and a loan from Eastman's uncle, they printed copies of first issue of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' and advertised it in ''Comics Buyer's Guide Magazine.<ref name=":6" />'' This attracted the interest of comic distributors, and all 3,000 copies were sold in a few weeks.''<ref name=":6" />'' Sales of further issues continued to climb.''<ref name=":6" />''

=== 1987–1989: Toys, animation and video games ===
In 1987, Eastman and Laird licensed ''Turtles'' to [[Playmates Toys]].<ref name=":0" /> Between 1988 and 1997, Playmates produced [[Turtles toys|''Turtles'' toys]] including around 400 figures and dozens of vehicles and playsets. About $1.1 billion USD of ''Turtles'' toys were sold in four years, making them the third-bestselling toy figures ever at the time, behind ''[[G.I. Joe|GI Joe]]'' and ''[[Kenner Star Wars action figures|Star Wars]]''.''<ref name=":6" />''

Influenced by the success of ''[[He-Man]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]'', which had promoted toy lines with animated series, PlayMates worked with [[Fred Wolf Films|Murakami-Wolf-Swenson]] to produce the first [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|''Turtles'' animated series]],<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|title=A bit of Ireland in those green ninja turtles|language=en-US|work=[[Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/08/21/a-bit-of-ireland-in-those-green-ninja-turtles/4e5bcfb8-d14e-497a-acb2-fa5069f43fe6/|access-date=2021-10-11|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> which premiered in 1987 and ran for almost a decade.<ref name=":0" /> It introduced ''Turtles'' elements such as their color-coded masks, catchphrases, love of pizza and distinct personalities.<ref name=":0" /> To make it acceptable to parents and television networks, the series had a lighter tone than the comics, with no expletives, less violence and less threatening villains.''<ref name=":6" />'' In the United Kingdom and some other European regions, the franchise was renamed ''Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles'' for the violent connotations of the word "ninja".<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=2018-01-10|title=Secrets Of The Ooze: 15 BTS Facts About Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II|url=https://www.cbr.com/behind-the-scenes-tmnt-2-secret-of-the-ooze/|access-date=2021-10-11|website=CBR|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite news|last=Cohen|first=Susan|date=1991-04-07|title=KID VIDEO GAMES|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1991/04/07/kid-video-games/0436d559-c2d9-4e66-9db4-0ddede435ea1/|access-date=2021-10-11|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

As of 2015, the Turtles had featured in 23 video games.''<ref name=":6" />''

In response to concerns that the series was drifting from its origins, Eastman and Laird published an editorial in the comic in 1989, writing: "We've allowed the wacky side to happen, and enjoy it very much. All the while, though, we've kept the originals very much ours."<ref>[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'']] vol. 1 No. 19, March 1989.</ref> Eastman later said there was "some stuff that we wish we hadn’t said yes to", and Laird wrote of his dislike for the softer tone of the animated series.''<ref name=":6" />''

Eastman and Laird's ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' premiered in May 1984, at a comic book convention held at a local Sheraton Hotel in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. It was published by [[Mirage Studios]] in an oversized magazine-style format using black and white artwork on cheap newsprint, limited to a print run of 3,250 copies.<ref>{{cite news|title= DYNAMIC DUO: Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird; Turning Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Into a Monster|work= The New York Times|date=December 25, 1988|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/25/business/dynamic-duo-kevin-eastman-peter-laird-turning-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-into.html?scp=1&sq=ninja%20turtles&st=cse&pagewanted=2|access-date=August 7, 2010 | first=Douglas C. | last=McGill}}</ref> Through a clever media kit that included a press release in ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' No. 89 and a full-page ad placed in ''Comic Buyer's Guide #547'', the public's interest was piqued and thus began the Turtle phenomenon. The small print runs made these early comics and trade magazines instant collector items, and within months, they were trading for over 50 times their cover price.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Mirage also published a bimonthly companion book entitled ''[[Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', featuring art by [[Ryan Brown (comics)|Ryan Brown]] and [[Jim Lawson (comic book writer)|Jim Lawson]], which was designed to fill in the gaps of continuity in the TMNT universe. This put the original series and ''Tales'' in the same mainstream [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. The title's first volume was from 1987 to 1989, released in alternating months with the regular Eastman and Laird book.

As the TMNT phenomenon proliferated to other media, Eastman and Laird found themselves administrating an international merchandising juggernaut. However, this prevented the two creators from participating in the day-to-day work of writing and illustrating a monthly comic book. So, many guest artists were invited to showcase their unique talents in the TMNT universe. The series lasted for 129 issues, spanning four separate volumes (having 62, 13, 23, and 32 issues in the four distinct volumes).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-06-27|title=The Complete History of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30862/complete-history-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles|access-date=2021-10-17|website=www.mentalfloss.com|language=en}}</ref>

Between 1984 and 1995, Mirage Studios published 75 regular issues, plus dozens of miniseries and other comics.<ref name=":6" /> After the Image Comics series ended, Laird returned the ''Turtles'' comic to Mirage in 2001 and disregarded the Image storylines. By 2010, 31 new issues had been produced.<ref name=":6" />

=== Image Comics (1996 – 1999) ===
In 1996, ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' moved from Mirage to [[Image Comics]], which produced thirteen issues and a miniseries. The series saw Splinter become a bat, Donatello a cyborg, Leonardo losing a hand and Raphael becoming the new Shredder. The series was canceled in 1999.<ref name=":6" />

=== First animated series (1987–1996) ===
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)}}

When little-known Playmates Toys was approached about producing a TMNT action figure line, they were cautious of the risk and requested that a television deal be acquired first.<ref>[http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 About the Creators] TMNT25.com (January 2009).

The series was produced by [[Murakami-Wolf-Swenson]].<ref name=":4" />

The show is more lighthearted than the comics. Here, the Turtles are portrayed as four funny but serious superheroes that fight the forces of evil from their sewer hideout. They love [[pizza]] and put weird toppings on it. They make their first appearance in masks color-coded to each turtle, where previously they had all worn red.<ref name="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles On TV">{{cite news|title= Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles On TV|work= IGN|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/774/774796p1.html|access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> The turtles were also well known for their use of idiomatic expressions characteristic of the surfer lingo of the time, especially by Michelangelo. Words and phrases included "bummer", "dude", "bogus", "radical", "far-out", "tubuloso", "bodacious", and possibly the most recognized, "cowabunga," a nonsense expression first coined by ''[[The Howdy Doody Show]]''{{'}}s Chief Thunderthud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/ninja_pedia.html |title=The Official TMNT Web Site! |publisher=Tmnt25.com |access-date=August 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414155020/http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/ninja_pedia.html |archive-date=April 14, 2009 }}</ref>

The cast included new and different characters, such as [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] and the Neutrinos. Original characters such as [[Splinter (TMNT)|Splinter]], [[Shredder (TMNT)|Shredder]], and the [[Foot Clan|Foot Soldiers]] stayed true to the comics in appearance and alignment only. Instead of being Hamato Yoshi's mutated pet rat, Splinter was a mutated Hamato himself. The Foot Soldiers changed from human ninjas to an endless supply of robotic grunts, allowing large numbers of them to be destroyed without anyone dying (this was a very important decision in terms of the show's child audience; excessive violence would have alienated parents of children, the show's target demographic). [[Krang]], one of the series' most memorable villains, was inspired by the design of the Utrom, a benign alien race from the Mirage comics. The animated Krang, however, was instead an evil warlord from [[Dimension X (TMNT)|Dimension X]]. [[Baxter Stockman]], whose race was changed from [[black people|black]] to [[white people|white]], was rewritten as a shy and meek lackey to Shredder, later mutating into an anthropomorphic [[housefly]]. During the final two seasons of the show, the lead villain switched to Lord Dregg, an evil alien overlord bent on world conquest by trying to distract the public into believing that the Turtles were the enemy instead of himself.

Starting on September 25, 1989, the series was expanded to weekdays and it had 47 more episodes for the new season. There were 28 new syndicated episodes for season 4 and only 13 of those episodes aired in 1990. The "European Vacation" episodes were not seen in the United States until [[USA Network]] started showing reruns in late 1993 and the "Awesome Easter" episodes were not seen until 1991. These episodes were delayed because of animation or scheduling problems.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131613/trivia "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" (1987/I) – Trivia] IMDB.com (February 2019). Retrieved on 2–21–09.</ref> On April 21, 1990, a drug-prevention television special was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[CBS]] named ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]'' that featured some of the most popular cartoons at the time; representing TMNT was Michelangelo, voiced by Townsend Coleman.

Starting on September 8, 1990 (with a different opening sequence), the show began its run on CBS. The CBS weekend edition ran for a full hour until 1994, initially airing a few Saturday-exclusive episodes back-to-back. Also, a brief "Turtle Tips" segment aired between the two episodes, which served as public-service announcement about the environment or other issues.  After 1994, the show was reduced to just a half-hour and only eight episodes per season were produced, grouped into a "CBS Action Zone" block that also featured ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s.]]'' and ''[[Skeleton Warriors]]'', both of which were canceled after one season; though TMNTs retained their "Action Zone" introduction. The series ran until November 2, 1996, when it aired its final episode. Its enormous popularity gave rise to its numerous imitators, including the ''[[Battletoads]]'', ''[[Cheetahmen]]'', ''[[Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa]]'', ''[[Road Rovers]]'', ''[[Street Sharks]]'', ''[[Extreme Dinosaurs]]'', and ''[[Biker Mice from Mars]]''. Currently, all 193 episodes are available on DVD and [[VHS]].

=== Original video animation ===
{{Main|Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen}}

In addition to the American series, a Japan-exclusive two-episode [[anime]] [[original video animation]] (OVA) series was made in 1996, titled ''Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen''. The OVA is similar in tone to the 1987 TV series and uses the same voices from [[TV Tokyo]]'s Japanese dub of the 1987 TV series. The first episode was made to advertise the ''TMNT Supermutants'' toys. It featured the Turtles as [[superhero]]es, that gained costumes and superpowers with the use of Mutastones, while Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady gained supervillain powers with the use of a Dark Mutastone. As with the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchises, the four Turtles could combine to form the giant Turtle Saint. The second episode was created to advertise the ''Metal Mutants'' toys in which the characters gain ''[[Saint Seiya]]''-esque mystical metal armor that can transform into beasts.

=== Live-action series (1997–1998) ===

{{Main|Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation}}

In 1997–1998, a live-action series, ''Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation,'' aired on Fox.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last1=staff|first1=T. H.

{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)}}

In 2003, a new TMNT series produced by [[4Kids Entertainment]] began airing on the "[[FoxBox]]" (later renamed "[[4Kids TV]]") programming block. It later moved to "[[The CW4Kids]]" block. The series was co-produced by Mirage Studios,<ref>{{cite news|title= TMNT Celebrates 25 Years, III – Peter Laird |work= Newsarama|url= http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080610-TMNT25-Laird.html|access-date=August 22, 2010}}</ref> and Mirage owned one-third of the rights to the series. Mirage's significant stake in creative control resulted in a cartoon that hews more closely to the original comics, creating a darker and edgier feel than the 1987 cartoon, but still kid-friendly enough to be considered appropriate for children.

This series lasted until 2009, ending with a feature-length television movie titled ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', which was produced in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the TMNTs franchise and featured the Turtles of the 2003 series teaming up with their counterparts from the 1987 series, and eventually are visited by the black and white comic versions of themselves in the final act. 4Kidstv.com featured all the episodes of the series, until September 2010, when [[Nickelodeon]] bought the series and air the series occasionally on Nicktoons and [[Nickelodeon]] normally during TMNTs marathons.

=== Third animated series (2012–2017) ===

==Films==
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in film}}

The Turtles have appeared in [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in film|six feature films]]. The first three are live-action features produced in the early 1990s: ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (1990), ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991), and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' (1993). The Turtles were played by various actors in costumes featuring [[animatronic]] heads, initially produced by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]]. The fourth film, a CGI-animated film titled simply ''[[TMNT (film)|TMNT]]'', was released in 2007.<ref name=":1" />

A reboot, also titled ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' produced by Platinum Dunes, [[Nickelodeon Movies]], and [[Paramount Pictures]], directed by Jonathan Liebesman, and produced by Michael Bay, was released in 2014. A sequel titled ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'' was released in 2016. A crossover film, called ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', was released in 2019.

==Merchandise==
Among the first licensed products to feature the TMNT was a [[tabletop role-playing game]] titled ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness]]'', published by [[Palladium Books]] in 1985, and featuring original comics and illustrations by Eastman and Laird. The game features a large list of animals, including elephants and sparrows, that are available as mutant [[player character]]s. Several more titles were in this genre, including ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures (role-playing game supplement)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures]]'', ''[[Truckin' Turtles]]'', ''[[Turtles Go Hollywood]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Guide to the Universe]]'', and ''[[Transdimensional Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.

In 1986, Dark Horse Miniatures in Boise, Idaho, produced an attendant set of lead [[figurine]]s; unlike later incarnations, the bandannas on the store's display set were painted all black before the multicolored versions were released to help younger readers distinguish between the four characters other than their weaponry. Palladium allowed the license to lapse in 2000, in part due to declining sales stemming from the "kiddification" of the animated and live-action incarnations to that point. However, Palladium's publisher, [[Kevin Siembieda]], has indicated a potential willingness to revisit the license given the franchise's recent moves closer to its roots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recordings.talkshoe.com/TS-9655.mp3 |title=Kevin Siembieda Interview, Part 2|date=February 19, 2007 |last=Meadows |first=Chris |access-date=February 20, 2007 |format=mp3 |work=Space Station Liberty}}</ref>

===Toys===
{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures}}

During the run of the 1987 TV series, Playmates Toys produced hundreds of TMNT [[action figure]]s, along with vehicles, [[playset]]s, and accessories, becoming one of the top collectibles for children.<ref>{{cite news|title= Rapid-Paced Turtle Sales Starting to Slow Down : Toys: Rival manufacturers see a cooling of the 'Ninja' fad as a chance to regain a larger share of the market. |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=December 23, 1991|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-23/business/fi-809_1_toy-manufacturers|access-date=November 9, 2010|first=Carla|last=Lazzareschi}}</ref> Staff artists at Northampton, Massachusetts-based Mirage Studios provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and creator credit can be found in the legal text printed on the back of the toy packaging. In addition, Playmates produced a series of TMNTs/''[[Star Trek]]'' crossover figures, due to Playmates holding the ''Star Trek'' action-figure license at the time. Playmates employed many design groups to develop looks and styles for the toy line, including Bloom Design, White Design, [[Pangea Corporation|Pangea]], Robinson-Clarke, and McHale Design. The marketing vice president of Playmates, Karl Aaronian, was largely responsible for assembling the talented team of designers and writers, which in turn, helped germinate continued interest in the toy line.

Never before in toy history did an action-figure line have such an impact for over two decades, generating billions of dollars in licensing revenue. The series was highly popular in the UK, where in the run-up to Christmas, the [[Army & Navy Stores (United Kingdom)|Army & Navy Store]] in London's [[Lewisham]] devoted its entire basement to everything Turtle, including games, videos, costumes, and other items. Playmates continued to produce TMNT action figures based on the 2003 animated series. The 2007 film ''TMNT'' also gave Playmates a new source from which to make figures, while [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] produced a series of high-quality action figures based on character designs from the original Mirage comics. In 2012, a new toy line and a new classic toy line from Playmates were announced to be released.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/02/01/new-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-toys-playmates-2012/ |title=Playmates Reveals 2012 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Action Figures – ComicsAlliance &#124; Comic book culture, news, humor, commentary, and reviews |work=ComicsAlliance |access-date=April 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618061436/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/02/01/new-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-toys-playmates-2012 |archive-date=June 18, 2013  }}</ref>

==Video games==
{{Original research section|date=October 2021}}{{Main|List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games}}

A number of ''TMNT'' video games had been produced, mostly by [[Konami]]. The first console video game based on the franchise, titled ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) under Konami's "Ultra Games" label in 1989 and later ported to home computers and eventually for the [[Wii]] on the [[Virtual Console]]. Also released by Konami in 1989 was an [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|arcade game, also titled simply ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'']], later ported to the NES as ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game'', leading to an NES-only sequel, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project]]'', which used the look of the arcade game, as opposed to the first NES game. The next Turtles game, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time]]'', was released in 1991 as an arcade game, and was later ported to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (Super NES) in 1992, titled ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time'', with a sequel numbering to the NES titles appended. ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist]]'' was also created for the [[Sega Genesis]] in the same year, and used many of the art assets from ''TMNT IV''.

There was also a trilogy of TMNT video games for the original [[Game Boy]] system made by Konami, consisting of: ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers]]'', and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue]]''. As the video game series progressed, and the Ninja Turtles' popularity began to decline in the mid-1990s, the video games changed direction.

{{Main|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles food tie-ins}}

During the height of their popularity, the Turtles had a number of food tie-ins.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Turtles' Tapes Being Served at Burger King|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=April 13, 1990|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-13/entertainment/ca-1355_1_burger-king|access-date=November 9, 2010|first=Dennis|last=Hunt}}</ref> Among the most notable of these products was Ninja Turtles Cereal, produced by [[Ralston-Purina]] as a kind of "Chex with TMNT-themed marshmallows." The cereal featured many different in-box premiums during its production run. Ralston also produced Pizza Crunchabungas, which were pizza-flavored corn snacks in the shape of whole, circular pizzas (the commercial starred the Ninja Turtles as [[Will Vinton]]-created claymations); [[Hostess (brand)|Hostess]] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Pies, featuring a crust covered in green glaze with vanilla pudding inside. Each pie came with either one of 5 yellow stickers with an illustration of one of the turtles on it, or one of 5 different TMNT II: Secret of the Ooze trading cards inside. There were also 4 TMNT mail away items available to order from Hostess. ; and Royal OOZE Gelatin Desserts, distributed by [[Nabisco]] under "Royal Gelatin" in three different flavors: orange, strawberry, and lime. [[Shreddies]] was a Canadian cereal with TMNT-themed box art and promos. One example of a TMNT prize was rings featuring a character from the cartoon (1992). [[Chef Boyardee]] also released a canned pasta with the pasta in the shapes of the four turtles. There were multiple versions of the pasta released, including one with Shredder added into the shapes. Customers could mail away for an exclusive Shredder action figure that was darker than the standard Playmates figure, it was shipped in a plastic baggy. This Shredder is one of the more valuable TMNT action figures today.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Mutant Merchandise|magazine= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 30, 1990|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317055,00.html|access-date=December 7, 2010}}</ref>

===Concert tour===
To capitalize on the Turtles' popularity, a concert tour was held in 1990, premiering at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on August 17.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Music news for August 17, 1990 – Prince and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles made news this week|magazine= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=August 17, 1990|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317967,00.html|access-date=December 7, 2010|first=Ron|last=Givens}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Review/Music; After the Hype, an Elaborate High-Tech Show for the Ninja Turtles Set |work= The New York Times|date=September 28, 1990|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/28/arts/review-music-after-hype-elaborate-high-tech-show-for-ninja-turtles-set.html?scp=4&sq=ninja%20turtles%20review&st=cse|access-date=November 9, 2010|first=Jon|last=Pareles}}</ref> The "Coming Out of Their Shells" tour featured live-action turtles playing music as a band (Donatello on keyboards; Leonardo on bass guitar; Raphael on drums and saxophone; and Michelangelo on guitar) on stage around a familiar plotline: April O'Neil is kidnapped by the Shredder, and the Turtles have to rescue her.<ref>{{cite news|title= Turtles Shell Out Ninja Concert Fun |newspaper= The Los Angeles Times|date=November 30, 1990|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-30/entertainment/ca-5464_1_ninja-turtle-sheets|access-date=August 27, 2010|first1=Ted|last1=Granberry|first2=Nancy|last2=Churnin}}</ref> The story had a very [[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure|Bill-n'-Ted]]-esque feel, with its theme of the power of [[rock n' roll]] literally defeating the enemy, in the form of the Shredder (who only rapped about how he hates music) trying to eliminate all music. A pay-per-view special highlighting the concert was shown, and a studio album was also released.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Shell Schlocked|magazine= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 12, 1990|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318331,00.html|access-date=December 7, 2010}}</ref>

The tour was sponsored by [[Pizza Hut]] in reality; thus, many references are made to their pizza. Empty Pizza Hut boxes are seen onscreen in the "Behind the Shells" VHS. As part of a cross-marketing strategy, Pizza Hut restaurants gave away posters, audio cassettes of "Coming Out of Their Shells", and "Official Tour Guides" as premiums. The original show of the tour was released on video with a making of video also released. The song "Pizza Power" was later used by [[Konami]] for the second arcade game ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time]]''. Cam Clarke and Peter Renaday reprised their roles as Leonardo and Splinter during spoken portions of the concert's kickoff event in Radio City Music Hall, though they went uncredited in the event's VHS release.

===At the Disney-MGM Studios theme park===
On June 30, 1990, the TMNT appeared in the "New York Street" section of [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] theme park in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Emerging from their Turtle Party Wagon, they would "ninja dance" across the stage while April performed the theme song to the show. After the main show was done, they posed for pictures and signed autographs. The Turtles also made appearances in Disney's Very Merry Christmas Parade to sing their own rendition of "Santa Claus is Coming to Town". They also appeared during the Easter parade dancing to their single "Pizza Power!" The Turtles' live shows and appearances ceased production in 1996.

===Roller coasters and amusement rides===

===Parodies===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cracked Issue 255.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Cover of ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' No. 255, August 1990]] -->

Although the TMNT had originated as something of a parody, the comic's explosive success led to a wave of small-press, black and white comic parodies of ''TMNT'' itself, including ''[[Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters]]'', ''[[Pre-Teen Dirty-Gene Kung-Fu Kangaroos]]'', and a host of others. Dark Horse Comics' ''[[Boris the Bear]]'' was launched in response to these TMNT clones; its first issue was titled "Boris the Bear Slaughters the Teenage Radioactive Black Belt Mutant Ninja Critters". Once the Turtles broke into the mainstream, parodies also proliferated in other media, such as in satire magazines ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' and ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' and numerous TV series of the period. The satirical British television series ''[[Spitting Image]]'' featured a recurring sketch "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turds".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX924HL3pV0&t=18m59s|title=Spitting Image Series 9 Episode 3 (full episode.)|last=Spitting Image Fun.|date=June 30, 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref>
