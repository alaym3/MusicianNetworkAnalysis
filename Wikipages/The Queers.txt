'''The Queers''' are an American [[punk rock]] band, formed in 1981 by the [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] native Joe P. King (a.k.a. Joe Queer) along with Scott Gildersleeve (a.k.a. Tulu), and Jack Hayes (a.k.a. Wimpy Rutherford). With the addition of Keith Hages in 1982 the band started playing their first live shows. The band originally broke up in late 1984, but reformed with Joe Queer and a new line-up in 1986. In 1990, the band signed with Shakin' Street Records and released their first album ''[[Grow Up (The Queers album)|Grow Up]]''. The album earned the band notability within [[New England]], but with the release of their next album 1993's ''[[Love Songs for the Retarded]]'', on [[Lookout! Records]], their following grew larger.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kembrew McLeod |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-queers-mn0000420097/biography |title=The Queers &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1999-01-21 |access-date=2015-03-11}}</ref>

In 2006, after releasing six albums on [[Lookout! Records]], the band rescinded their master rights from the label, citing breach of contract over unpaid royalties. Later that year they signed with [[Asian Man Records]].

The Queers' [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Wipe Out (instrumental)|Wipe Out]]" was featured in the 2007 [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Sony Pictures Imageworks|ImageWorks Studios]] [[mockumentary]] film ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]],'' produced by [[Sony Pictures Animation]] and [[National Geographic Films]].<ref>{{cite video

In 1986, King formed a new version of the band with [[DMZ (band)|DMZ]] guitarist J. J. Rassler, bassist Kevin Kecy, and drummer Hugh O'Neil. The band broke up again in 1989 after King bought a restaurant, but the next year were reformed by King and O'Neil, with new bassist B-Face.<ref name="Podcast" /> In 1990, this lineup released the band's debut album ''[[Grow Up (The Queers album)|Grow Up]]'' on a small English label called Shakin' Street Records. When ''Grow Up'' caught the attention of [[Screeching Weasel]] frontman [[Ben Weasel]], he convinced [[Lookout! Records]] owner [[Larry Livermore]] to sign The Queers, who released their second album, [[Love Songs for the Retarded]], on Lookout! in 1993.<ref name="auto"/> To promote the album the band went on tours with Screeching Weasel and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]].<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthnh.com/queers-elvis-room-20-joe-king/|title=From your boy|website=Portsmothnh.com|date=1 October 2019|access-date=20 September 2020}}</ref>

The recording for the band's next album, 1994's ''[[Beat Off]]'', was scheduled to take place partway through a U.S. tour, but O'Neill was once again sidelined by addiction. The Queers instead recruited Screeching Weasel drummer [[Dan Panic]], and also added his bandmate [[Dan Vapid]] as a second guitarist. Panic and Vapid would record ''Beat Off'' with The Queers, though Vapid's guitar parts were removed from the album before its release.<ref name="Prested, 77-78"/> They also played on the subsequent live album, ''[[Suck This]]'' (1995), and Vapid would play on 1995's ''[[Surf Goddess]]'' EP.<ref name="Punk USA"/><ref>{{cite web |last=DaRonco |first=Mike |title=Review: ''Suck This'' |website=[[AllMusic]]|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/suck-this-live-mw0000911280 |access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |date=1995 |title=[[Surf Goddess]] |type=CD liner notes |location=Berkeley, California |publisher=[[Lookout!

Records. The band had been offered a three-album deal with [[Epitaph Records]], which King was in favor of, but B-Face and O'Neil weren't.

==Music==
The Queers play a [[Ramones]]-derived style of [[pop punk]]. Much like [[The Ramones]], common lyrical themes are of girls, love, drugs, alcohol and having fun. Musically the band deviates slightly from the driving rhythm guitar sound of the Ramones and augments their songs with harmony vocals and guitar solos. They have been described by Livermore as "The Ramones meets The Beach Boys".<ref name="Livermore, 191-196">Livermore, pp. 191–196.</ref> [[Ben Weasel]] of [[Screeching Weasel]] infrequently collaborates on songwriting with Joe Queer. The band is well known for the variety of [[cover versions]] they include on their records and during live performances. Bands/artists covered by The Queers include [[The Beach Boys]], [[Ramones]] (including a complete re-recording of the ''[[Rocket to Russia]]'' album), Unnatural Axe, [[The Nobodys]], [[Angry Samoans]], [[The Mr. T Experience]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[The Fantastic Baggys]], [[The Who]], [[The Undertones]], [[The Hobos]], [[Tommy James and The Shondells]], [[Helen Love]], The Catalogs (from Hawaii, featuring Les Hernandez of The Quintessentials), The Banana Splits and many more.

==Controversy==
Joe Queer has been publicly outspoken against Nazism and white supremacy over the years as expressed in various interviews and in the song "You're Tripping" off of the 1993 [[Lookout Records]] release ''[[Love Songs for the Retarded]]''. The lyrics state "I hate white power... Can't you see, this ain't Nazi Germany".

In a 2014 open letter, Joe Steinhardt of [[Don Giovanni Records]] called on [[Asian Man Records]] and [[Recess Records]] to drop The Queers after Joe Queer made public statements in support of [[Ferguson, Missouri|Ferguson]] police officer [[Darren Wilson (police officer)|Darren Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=JOE QUEER BACKS OFFICER DARREN WILSON, PUNK COMMUNITY CONFUSED|publisher=Impose Magazine|url=http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/news/joe-queer-backs-officer-darren-wilson-punk-community-confused|access-date=2015-03-17}}</ref> Artist [[Mitch Clem]], who had previously done work for the band, publicly broke ties as well. Steinhardt later apologized for the open letter, stating "I remain personally appalled by Joe Queer's defense of Darren Wilson, his use of the term Obongo regarding [[Barack Obama|the president]]...at the same time, I recognize that a better way to go about this would be more thoughtful discussion directly with the people involved." Joe Queer later called Steinhardt a 'gutless wimp' and challenged him to a face to face debate to be filmed and put online. Steinhardt has yet to respond.<ref>{{cite web|title=Don Giovanni Records owner asks labels to drop The Queers and Screeching Weasel, then apologizes|publisher=PunkNews.org|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/55795/don-giovanni-records-owner-asks-labels-to-drop-the-queers-and-screeching-weasel-then-apologizes|access-date=2015-03-17}}</ref>

In an interview with Noisey, after their February 2016 show was cancelled due to a call for a petition to boycott the show from a local collective, Babely Shades, Joe Queer voiced his opinion when asked if he "supports racist, misogynistic or homophobic values?" he replied "Of course not. What normal minded person does? My closest pals here in Atlanta are Chris and Chester, two gay black guys. I was actually working a part time job. I was one of two white people on the whole job. If I was so racist, I wouldn't have worked there or be living in Atlanta! The whole city is predominantly black." He also voiced his opinion of the activist group [[Black Lives Matter]], stating 
"Black Lives Matter doesn't care about black people, they just want to cause trouble and hate white people. If they truly cared they'd be in the ghettos of America trying to help there instead of screaming about white America. That's where the murders of black people are happening, but according to BLM it's all white cops who are doing it! It's insane thinking and not getting to the root of the problem at all. [[All lives matter]]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/rygzvm/the-queers-ottawa-controversy|title=The Queers Are Fighting to Play in Ottawa and We Found Out Why|first=Griffin|last=Elliot|website=Vice.com|date=February 2, 2016|access-date=March 27, 2020}}</ref>

In a 2017 interview, Joe Queer stated "I get called a Nazi and racist because of our name, and then because I had an opinion about the Ferguson thing,” he says. “I'm liberal as hell, and I was taken aback by how quickly people attacked me. To this day, I'll get snide comments. I was jumped by Nazis as a gay person, even though I'm not gay. I fought Nazis, so to be called a Nazi is lame by this alt-left." In the same interview he states that humor is a way to social change, we shouldn't take ourselves so seriously and that many people are looking for a reason to be offended, "“In the old days of punk rock, all these bands were laughing at themselves, and they got their point across through humor,” King says. “The Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, the Circle Jerks, the Dickies, the Angry Samoans, Flipper, X — they were funny, but they had a message. They were laughing at themselves. I don't think the new liberals are really offended. I think they're just looking for a reason to say they're offended. They completely take everything out of context. It's so insincere, this faux outrage."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/joe-queer-of-the-queers-on-milo-yiannopoulos-darren-wilson-and-nazis-9199191|title=The Queers' Joe Queer Once Fought Nazis.

==Band members==
Since its formation, the band has gone through a few line-up changes, with Joe Queer as the only constant member. The band currently consists of Joe Queer (guitar/vocals),  Cheeto Bandito (bass), and Hoglog Rehab (drums). The first line-up was Joe Queer, Tulu, Keith Hages and Wimpy Rutherford. The mid-1980s line-up was Joe Queer, JJ Rassler, Hugh O'Neill with Kevin Kecy or Evan Shore. The best known line-up is from the 1990s Lookout Records era: Joe Queer, B-Face and Hugh O'Neill. After leaving Lookout Records, B-Face and Hugh O'Neill left and Dangerous Dave joined. The Queers continue to actively tour and a new record is in the works.
