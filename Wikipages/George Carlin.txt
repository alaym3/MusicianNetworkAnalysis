'''George Denis Patrick Carlin''' (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], actor, social critic, and author. Regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comics of all time, he was dubbed "the dean of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] comedians".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/people/index.ssf/2008/06/george_carlin_counterculture_c.html |title=George Carlin, counterculture comedians' dean, dies at 71 |first=Michael |last=Norman |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]] |date=June 23, 2008 |access-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref> He was known for his [[black comedy|dark comedy]] and reflections on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and [[taboo]] subjects. His "[[seven dirty words]]" routine was central to the 1978 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the government's power to [[Censorship in the United States#Broadcast censorship|censor indecent material]] on the public airwaves.

The first of Carlin's 14 stand-up comedy specials for [[HBO]] was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, his routines focused on [[Social criticism|sociocultural criticism]] of American society. He often commented on American political issues and satirized [[American culture]]. He was a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' during the three-decade [[Johnny Carson]] era and hosted the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975. His final comedy special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', was filmed less than four months before his death from cardiac failure.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/arts/23iht-24carlin.13905378.html |title=George Carlin, irreverent comedian, dies at 71 |first=Mel |last=Watkins |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 23, 2008 |access-date= December 22, 2020}}</ref> In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]].

Carlin joined the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] and trained as a radar technician. He was stationed at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]], and began working as a disc jockey at the radio station KJOE in nearby [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. Labeled an "unproductive airman" by his superiors, he received a [[general discharge]] on July 29, 1957. During his time in the Air Force, he had been [[court-martial]]ed three times and received many nonjudicial punishments and reprimands.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/2008/film/news/comedian-george-carlin-dies-at-71-1117987925/ |title=Comedian George Carlin dies at 71 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 22, 2008 |access-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>

In 1959, Carlin met [[Jack Burns]], a fellow DJ at radio station [[KMNY|KXOL]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html|title=Texas Radio Hall of Fame: George Carlin |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923044145/http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html |archive-date=September 23, 2004 |access-date=June 11, 2014}}</ref> They formed a comedy team and after successful performances at Fort Worth's [[Beat Generation|beat]] coffeehouse called The Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960.<ref name="james7"/>

Within weeks of arriving in California, Burns and Carlin put together an audition tape and created ''The Wright Brothers'', a morning show on [[KDAY]] in Hollywood. During their tenure at KDAY, they honed their material in [[beatnik]] coffeehouses at night.<ref name=bio60s>{{Cite news |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |title=Timeline – 1960s |work=George Carlin Biography |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000621020616/http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |archive-date=June 21, 2000 |access-date=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Years later when he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&entity_id=19830&source_type=A|title=Biographical information for George Carlin|publisher=Kennedy Center|access-date=July 30, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220184243/http://kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&entity_id=19830&source_type=A|archive-date=February 20, 2009}}</ref> Burns and Carlin recorded their only album, ''[[Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight]]'', in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.<ref name=bio60s /> After two years together as a team, they parted to pursue individual careers, but "remain[ed] the best of friends".{{sfn|Carlin|Hendra|2009|pp=47–8}}

In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows, where he played various characters:<ref name=timeline />
* The Indian Sergeant&nbsp;– "There will be a rain dance tonight ... weather permitting ..."
* Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO radio ...")&nbsp;– "The Beatles' latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says, 'Dummy! You're playing it backwards at slow speed!'"
* Al Sleet, the Hippie-Dippie Weatherman&nbsp;– "Tonight's forecast: Dark. Continued mostly dark tonight, changing to widely scattered light towards morning."
[[File:George Carlin 1969.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Carlin performing on ''This Is Tom Jones'' in 1969]]

Variations on these routines appear on Carlin's 1967 debut album, ''[[Take-Offs and Put-Ons]]'', which was recorded live in 1966 at The Roostertail in Detroit, Michigan and issued by [[RCA Victor]] in 1967.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |title=George Carlin's official site (see Timeline) |publisher=Georgecarlin.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008001351/http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |archive-date=October 8, 2009 |access-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>
During this period, Carlin became a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', initially with [[Jack Paar]] as host, and then with [[Johnny Carson]]. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast in ''Away We Go'', a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061235/fullcredits | title=Away We Go (1967– ) Full Cast & Crew | website=IMDb | access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> His material during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional", particularly when contrasted with his later [[anti-establishment]] material.<ref>''[[ABC World News Tonight]]''; June 23, 2008.</ref>

Carlin was present at [[Lenny Bruce]]'s arrest for obscenity. As the police began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning, they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail with Bruce in the same vehicle.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Profanity|episode-link=List of Bullshit! episodes|series=Penn & Teller: Bullshit!|series-link=Penn & Teller: Bullshit!|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|air-date=August 12, 2004|season=2|number=10}}</ref> In the late 1960s, Carlin was making about $250,000 annually.<ref name=Zoglin/> As a [[tax shelter]], he bought a twin-engine [[IAI Westwind|Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander]] private jet and hired pilots to fly him to various tour dates.<ref name=Jet>{{harvnb|Carlin|Hendra|2009|p=[https://archive.org/details/lastwords0000carl/page/151 151]}}</ref>

=== 1970s ===
Over time, Carlin changed his routines and his appearance; he grew his hair long, sported a beard and earrings, and typically dressed in T-shirts and blue jeans. He lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian at a time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. He hired talent managers Jeff Wald and Ron De Blasio to help him change his image, making him look more "[[Hip (slang)|hip]]" for a younger audience. Wald put Carlin into much smaller clubs such as [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood and [[The Bitter End]] in New York City, and later said that Carlin's income was thus reduced by 90% but his later career arc was greatly improved.<ref name=Zoglin>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xg1h5lBheQC&pg=PT34 |pages=34–35 |last=Zoglin |first=Richard |title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=9781596919440 |access-date=June 12, 2014}}</ref> In 1970, record producer [[Monte Kay]] formed the [[Little David Records]] subsidiary of Atlantic Records, with comedian [[Flip Wilson]] as co-owner.{{sfn|Sullivan|2010|p=114}} Kay and Wilson signed Carlin away from [[RCA Records]] and recorded a Carlin performance at Washington, D.C.'s [[The Cellar Door|Cellar Door]] in May 1971, which was released as ''[[FM & AM]]'' in January 1972. De Blasio was busy managing the fast-paced career of [[Freddie Prinze]] and was about to sign [[Richard Pryor]], so he released Carlin to Little David general manager Jack Lewis, who, like Carlin, was somewhat wild and rebellious.{{sfn|Sullivan|2010|p=158}} Using his own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by [[Ed Sullivan]] in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style.<ref name="GoldmarkBio">{{cite web|last=Goldmark|first=Tony|title=George Carlin – Biography|url=http://www.amoeba.com/george-carlin/artist/146678/bio|website=Amoeba Music|access-date=September 1, 2016|quote=He bridged these two sides of his persona with 'The Hair Piece,' a whimsical poem about public aversion to long hair that he performed on Ed Sullivan, effectively reintroducing and reinventing himself to America. FM & AM went Gold, got him a gig at Carnegie Hall, and won the Grammy award for Best Comedy Album.}}</ref>

Starting in 1972, singer-songwriter [[Kenny Rankin]] was Carlin's label mate on Little David Records, and Rankin served many times as Carlin's musical guest or opening act during the early 1970s. The two flew together in Carlin's private jet; Carlin says that Rankin relapsed into using cocaine while on tour since Carlin had so much of the drug available.<ref name=Jet/> The album ''[[FM & AM]]'' proved very popular. It marked Carlin's change from mainstream to counterculture comedy. The "AM" side was an extension of Carlin's previous style, with zany but relatively clean routines parodying aspects of American life. The "FM" side introduced Carlin's new style, with references to marijuana and birth control pills, and a playful examination of the word "shit". In this manner, Carlin renewed a style of radical social commentary comedy that Lenny Bruce had pioneered in the late 1950s.<ref name=Zoglin/>
[[File:George Carlin In concert at the Zembo Mosque, Harrisburg, Pa.jpg|thumb|left|Carlin performing in the 1970s]]

In this period, Carlin perfected his well-known "[[seven dirty words]]" routine, which most notably appears on ''[[Class Clown]]'' as follows: "'Shit', 'piss', 'fuck', 'cunt', 'cocksucker', 'motherfucker', and 'tits'. Those are the heavy seven. Those are the ones that'll infect your soul, curve your spine and keep the country from winning the war." On July 21, 1972, Carlin was arrested after performing this routine at [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Summerfest]] and charged with violating obscenity laws.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|title=Carlin's naughty words still ring in officer's ears|author=Jim Stingl|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=June 30, 2007|access-date=March 23, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124942/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|archive-date=September 29, 2007}}</ref> The case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as the "Milwaukee Seven", was dismissed in December when the judge declared that the language was indecent but that Carlin had the freedom to say it as long as he caused no disturbance.<ref>{{cite news |date=July 23, 1972 |title=Against Comedian: Charges Refused |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19720723&id=3RcfAAAAIBAJ&pg=3488,3633489 |work=The Tuscaloosa News |access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref> In 1973, a man complained to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] after listening with his son to a similar routine, "Filthy Words" from Carlin's ''[[Occupation: Foole]]'', which was broadcast one afternoon over radio station [[WBAI]]. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC for violating regulations that prohibit broadcasting "obscene" material. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld the FCC action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience.<ref>''[[F.C.C. v.

The controversy increased Carlin's fame. He eventually expanded the "dirty words" theme with a seemingly interminable end to a performance, finishing with his voice fading out in one HBO version and accompanying the credits in the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' special for the 1982–83 season, and a set of 49 web pages organized by subject and embracing his "Incomplete List of Impolite Words".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |title=BBS – Incomplete List of Impolite Words |publisher=George Carlin |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406052624/http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |archive-date=April 6, 2012 |access-date=June 12, 2014}}</ref> On stage, during a rendition of this routine, Carlin learned that his previous comedy album ''FM & AM'' had won a Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album ''Occupation: Foole'', he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper.

Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years, he rarely performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing specials for HBO as part of its ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'' series; he did 14 specials, including 2008's ''It's Bad For Ya!''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/george-carlin-9542307#comic-great |title=George Carlin stand up comedian does 14 specials for On Location |publisher=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (TV network)|FYI]] / [[A&E Networks]]) |access-date= October 8, 2016}}</ref> He later revealed that he had suffered the first of three [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] during this layoff period.<ref name="bravo">{{cite episode|title=George Carlin|series=Inside the Actors Studio|series-link=Inside the Actors Studio|network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo TV]]|air-date=October 31, 2004|season=11|number=4}}</ref> His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.<ref name="EssSplitsider2015">{{cite web|last1=Ess|first1=Ramsey|title=How George Carlin Changed comedy In His First HBO Special|url=http://splitsider.com/2015/04/how-george-carlin-changed-comedy-in-his-first-hbo-special/|website=Splitsider.com|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160617094322/http://splitsider.com/2015/04/how-george-carlin-changed-comedy-in-his-first-hbo-special/|archive-date=June 17, 2016 |date=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name="LeveretteOttBuckley2009">{{cite book|last1=Leverette|first1=Marc|last2=Ott|first2=Brian L|last3=Buckley|first3=Cara Louise|title=It's Not TV: Watching HBO in the Post-Television Era|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135902742|page=128|url=https://www.routledge.com/Its-Not-TV-Watching-HBO-in-the-Post-Television-Era/Leverette-Ott-Buckley/p/book/9780415960380|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901182100/https://www.routledge.com/Its-Not-TV-Watching-HBO-in-the-Post-Television-Era/Leverette-Ott-Buckley/p/book/9780415960380|archive-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref>

=== 1980s ===
In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing ''[[A Place for My Stuff]]'' and returning to HBO and New York City with the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' TV special, videotaped at [[Carnegie Hall]] and airing during the 1982–83 season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or two over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from this time forward are from the HBO specials.<ref>{{cite web|date=2020-08-22|title=The Late George Carlin Returns to HBO!|url=https://hbowatch.com/the-late-george-carlin-returns-to-hbo/|access-date=2021-08-13|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|date=2020-08-10|title=George Carlin to Get Two-Part Documentary From HBO and Judd Apatow|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/george-carlin-documentary-hbo-judd-apatow-1041957/|access-date=2021-08-13|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en}}</ref>

Carlin began to achieve prominence as a film actor with a major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'', starring [[Bette Midler]] and [[Shelley Long]]; it was his first notable screen role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series. Playing drifter Frank Madras, he poked fun at the lingering effect of the [[1960s counterculture]]. In 1989, he gained popularity with a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling mentor of the title characters in ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', and reprised his role in the film sequel ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]'' as well as the first season of the [[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|cartoon series]].

=== 1990s ===
[[File:Loz carlinbd2.jpg|thumb|160px|Carlin at a book signing for ''[[Brain Droppings]]'' at [[Barnes & Noble]] in 2004]]
Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the movie ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'', which starred [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Barbra Streisand]], portraying the gay neighbor of the main character's suicidal sister.<ref name="Grimes1992">{{cite web|last1=Grimes|first1=William|author-link=William Grimes (journalist)|title=George Carlin, Small but Amusing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/news/george-carlin-small-but-amusing.html|website=New York Times|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526055649/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/news/george-carlin-small-but-amusing.html|archive-date=May 26, 2015 |date=January 21, 1992}}</ref>

He also played the role of "Mr Conductor" on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' and narrated the show's sequences of the American and New Zealand version of the U.K. television series ''[[Thomas & Friends|Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'' from 1991 to 1995, replacing [[Ringo Starr]]. Carlin narrated the first four seasons of what would later become known as ''Thomas & Friends'' for use on ''Shining Time Station.'' According to [[Britt Allcroft]], who developed both shows, on the first day of the assignment, Carlin was nervous about recording his narration without an audience, so the producers put a stuffed teddy bear in the booth.<ref name=LAT>{{cite news|last=Allcroft |first=Britt |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oew-allcroft26-2008jun26,0,3849505.story |title=The George Carlin I knew |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 26, 2008 |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref>

In 1993, Carlin began a weekly [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom, ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'', playing New York City [[taxicab]] driver George O'Grady. <!--He quickly included a variation of the "seven words" in the plot.--> The show, created and written by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' co-creator [[Sam Simon]], ran 27 episodes through December 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html |title=1990–1999 |publisher=GeorgeCarlin.com |access-date=July 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130011335/http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html |archive-date=January 30, 2009 }}</ref> In his final book, the posthumously published ''[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]'', Carlin said about ''The George Carlin Show'', "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members [[Alex Rocco]], [[Christopher Rich (actor)|Chris Rich]], [[Anthony Starke|Tony Starke]]. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... [but] I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."{{sfn|Carlin|Hendra|2009}}{{page needed|date=November 2021}}

Carlin was honored at the 1997 [[Aspen Comedy Festival]] with a retrospective, ''[[George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]]. His first hardcover book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]'' (1997), sold nearly 900,000 copies and spent 40 weeks on the ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|title=The Kennedy Center|access-date=June 12, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111638/http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|archive-date=December 24, 2013}}</ref>

=== 2000s ===
Carlin later explained that there were other, more pragmatic reasons for abandoning his acting career in favor of standup. In an interview for [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']] magazine in 2001, he said, "Because of my abuse of drugs, I neglected my business affairs and had large arrears with the IRS, and that took me eighteen to twenty years to dig out of. I did it honorably, and I don't begrudge them. I don't hate paying taxes, and I'm not angry at anyone, because I was complicit in it. But I'll tell you what it did for me: it made me a way better comedian. Because I had to stay out on the road and I couldn't pursue that movie career, which would have gone nowhere, and I became a really good comic and a really good writer."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/george-carlin-quotes-0102 |title=What I've Learned: George Carlin |publisher=Esquire.com |date=June 23, 2008 |author=Larry Getlen |access-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>

In 2001, Carlin was given a [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the 15th Annual [[American Comedy Awards]]. In December 2003, Representative [[Doug Ose]] (R-California) introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's "seven dirty words",<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/3687|title=H.R.3687 - To amend section 1464 of title 18, United States Code, to provide for the punishment of certain profane broadcasts, and for other purposes.|date=December 8, 2003|website=congress.gov}}</ref> including "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)". The bill omitted "tits", but included "asshole", which was not one of Carlin's original seven words. The bill was referred to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties|House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution]] in January 2004, where it was tabled.<ref name=":0" />

Carlin performed regularly as a headliner in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], but in 2004 his run at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] was terminated after an altercation with his audience. After a poorly received set, filled with dark references to suicide bombings and beheadings, Carlin complained that he could not wait to get out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas; he wanted to go back east, he said, "where the real people are". He continued: "People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind of fucking people with very limited intellects." When an audience member shouted, "Stop degrading us!" Carlin responded, "Thank you very much, whatever that was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately fired, and soon thereafter his representative announced that he would begin treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction on his own initiative.<ref name="tagreviewj">{{cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |title=Dark Carlin |newspaper=reviewjournal.com |date=December 4, 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207042940/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |archive-date=December 7, 2004 |access-date=June 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/12/27/george.carlin/index.html? |title=George Carlin enters rehab |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=December 29, 2004 |access-date=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

At the first tour stop in February at the Tachi Palace Casino in [[Lemoore, California]], Carlin mentioned that the appearance was his "first show back" after a six-week hospitalization for heart failure and [[pneumonia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Carlin voiced a character in the 2006 [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. The character, Fillmore, is an anti-establishment hippie [[VW Microbus]] with a [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] paint job and the license plate "51237"&nbsp;– Carlin's birthday. In 2007, Carlin voiced the wizard in ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', his last film.

[[Louis C.K.]] dedicated his stand-up special ''Chewed Up'' to Carlin, and Lewis Black dedicated the second season of ''[[Lewis Black's Root of All Evil|Root of All Evil]]'' to him.

For a number of years, Carlin had been compiling and writing his autobiography, to be released in conjunction with a one-man Broadway show tentatively titled ''New York Boy''. After Carlin's death, [[Tony Hendra]], his collaborator on both projects, edited the autobiography for release as ''[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]''. The book, chronicling most of Carlin's life and future plans, including the one-man show, was published in 2009. The abridged audio edition is narrated by Carlin's brother, Patrick Jr.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Deahl |first=Rachel |title=Free Press Acquires Posthumous Carlin Memoir |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=July 14, 2009 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6670970.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716142423/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6670970.html |archive-date=July 16, 2009 |access-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>

== The "Carlin Warning" ==
After Carlin's [[seven dirty words]] routine and subsequent ''[[FCC v. Pacifica Foundation]]'' Supreme Court ruling in 1973, broadcasters started to use the "Carlin Warning" to remind performers of the words they could not say during a live performance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/438/726.html |title= FCC v. Pacifica Foundation |website=Findlaw}}</ref>

== Internet hoaxes ==
Many writings found on the internet have been falsely attributed to Carlin, including various joke lists, rants, and other pieces. The web site [[Snopes]], an online resource that debunks [[urban legend]]s and myths, has addressed these hoaxes. Many of them contain material that runs counter to Carlin's viewpoints; some are especially volatile toward racial groups, gay people, women, the homeless, and other targets. Carlin was aware of these bogus e-mails and debunked them on his own website, saying, "Here's a rule of thumb, folks: Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my website," and "It bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff." [[Weird Al Yankovic]] referenced these hoaxes in a line of his song "[[Alpocalypse#Track listing|Stop Forwarding That Crap to Me]]" by saying "And by the way, those quotes from George Carlin aren't really George Carlin".<ref>
