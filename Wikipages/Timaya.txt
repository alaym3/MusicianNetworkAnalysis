His father was a banker and his mother was a trader. For his early education, Odon attended Assemblies of God Nursery And Primary School.<ref name="Timaya Rise">{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201206110668.html|title=Nigeria: The Story Behind Timaya's Rise|last=Adamu|first= Naomi|date=10 July 2012|work=[[AllAfrica.com]]|publisher=[[AllAfrica Global Media]]|access-date=10 March 2014}}</ref> His secondary school education began at Nkpolu Oroworukwo in Port Harcourt.<ref name="plantain boy">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetidenewsonline.com/2009/12/05/timaya%E2%80%99s-plantain-boy-rules-music-scene%E2%80%A6-picks-n9-5m-escalade-jeep-new-lover/|title=Timaya's Plantain Boy Rules Music Scene… Picks N9.5m Escalade jeep, new Lover|newspaper=[[The Tide (Nigeria)|The Tide News]]|date=5 December 2009 |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref> He would often break house rules to attend late-night music events. Before Timaya could graduate from school, his mother arranged for him to travel with his older brother and older sister to Lagos. After moving to the city, he gained admission into Lagos' Ikeja Grammar School, where he eventually obtained a secondary school certificate.<ref name="vanguardngr2">{{cite news|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/01/timaya-plantain-seller-tells-his-story| title=Timaya, plantain seller tells his story| date=14 January 2012|work=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguardngr.com]]| publisher=[[Vanguard Media]]|access-date=7 March 2014}}</ref>

Soldiers were hunting down militants they alleged killed eight policemen. The village was burnt down and numerous people  killed. I bravely, tackled the issue years later and won instant street credibility for my boldness."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/feature/sixteen-years-after-massacre-odi-residents-want-obasanjos-apology.html|title=Sixteen years after massacre, Odi residents want Obasanjo’s apologues|website=[[The Punch]]|publisher=JESUSEGUN ALAGBE|access-date=27 September 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>
