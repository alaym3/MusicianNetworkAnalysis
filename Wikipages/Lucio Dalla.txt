'''Lucio Dalla''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|OMRI]]}} ({{IPA-it|ˈluːtʃo ˈdalla}}; 4 March 1943 – 1 March 2012) was an Italian singer-songwriter, musician and actor. He also played [[clarinet]] and keyboards.

Dalla was the composer of "[[Caruso (song)|Caruso]]" (1986), a song dedicated to Italian opera tenor [[Enrico Caruso]], and "L'anno che verrà" (1979).<ref>[https://www.rockit.it/articolo/lucio-dalla-anno-che-verra-canzone-testo Analysys of the text]</ref>

==Beginnings==
Dalla was born in [[Bologna]], Italy. He began to play the [[clarinet]] at an early age, in a [[jazz]] band in [[Bologna]], and became a member of a local jazz band called Rheno Dixieland Band, together with future film director [[Pupi Avati]]. Avati said that he decided to leave the band after feeling overwhelmed by Dalla's talent. He also acknowledged that his film, ''Ma quando arrivano le ragazze?'' (2005), was inspired by his friendship with Dalla.<ref>[http://www3.lastampa.it/spettacoli/sezioni/articolo/lstp/444725 La Stampa, "Pupi Avati "L'amicizia con Dalla l'ho girata in un film"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305114241/http://www3.lastampa.it/spettacoli/sezioni/articolo/lstp/444725 |date=5 March 2012 }}</ref>

In the 1960s the band participated in the first Jazz Festival at [[Antibes]], France. The Rheno Dixieland Band won the first prize in the [[trad jazz|traditional]] jazz band category and was noticed by a [[Rome|Roman]] band called Second Roman New Orleans Jazz Band, with whom Dalla recorded his first record in 1961 and had the first contacts with [[RCA records]], his future music publisher.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Singer-songwriter [[Gino Paoli]] hearing Dalla's vocal qualities, suggested that he attempt a soloist career as a soul singer. However, Dalla's debut at the [[Cantagiro]] music festival in 1965 was not successful probably due to both his physical appearance as well as his music, which was considered too experimental for the time. His first single, a rendition in Italian of the American traditional standard "[[Careless Love]]" was a failure, as it was his first album, ''1999'', that was released the following year. His next album, ''Terra di Gaibola '' (from the name of a [[Frazione|suburb]] of Bologna), was released in 1970 and contained some early Dalla classics. His first hit was "4 Marzo 1943", which achieved some success due to the [[Sanremo Festival]]. The original title of the song was supposed to be "Gesù bambino", however in those years there was still stiff censorial control over the content of songs, and the title was changed to Dalla's birth date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2012/03/01/news/dalla_i_dischi_e_le_canzoni_tra_il_jazz_e_ges_bambino-30756605/?ref=HREA-1|title=Lucio Dalla, canzoni camaleontiche tra jazz, Caruso e Gesù Bambino|publisher=repubblica.it|access-date=4 August 2013}}</ref>

==With Roberto Roversi==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Dalla's recording debut as a soloist took place in 1964, with the release of the 45 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]-single "Lei (non è per me)" (B-side: "Ma questa sera"). In the 1970s, Dalla started a collaboration with the Bolognese poet [[Roberto Roversi]]. Roversi wrote the lyrics to Dalla's next three albums ''Il giorno aveva cinque teste'' (''The Day Had Five Heads'') (1973), ''Anidride solforosa'' (''Sulphur dioxide'') (1975) and ''[[Automobili]]'' (''Automobiles'') (1976).

Although these albums did not sell in large numbers, they were noted by critics for the unusual mix of Roversi's lyrics with Dalla's improvisations, along with the latter's sometimes experimental twists and composition abilities. The duo had already broken up by the time the concept album ''Automobili'' was released. Roversi, who had been against the album's release, chose the pseudonym "Norisso" when it was time to register the songs. The album, however, included one of Dalla's most popular songs, "[[Tazio Nuvolari|Nuvolari]]", named after the famous 1930s Italian racer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italica.rai.it/scheda.php?scheda=canzone_dalla_nuvolari&hl=ita|title=Nuvolari|publisher=Italica.rai.it|access-date=4 August 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208162522/http://www.italica.rai.it/scheda.php?scheda=canzone_dalla_nuvolari&hl=ita|archive-date=8 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Solo career==
[[File:Salvioniedalla.JPG|thumb|226x226px|Lucio Dalla (right) sitting in the Teatro Comunale, in Bologna, next to music producer Gianluigi Salvioni.]]
Affected by the end of the collaboration, Dalla decided to write the lyrics of his next albums himself. The first album of this new phase was ''[[Com'è profondo il mare]]'' (1977), in which Dalla was accompanied by members of future pop band Stadio.

In 1979, his popularity was confirmed by the success of the ''[[Banana Republic (album)|Banana Republic]]'' album and the first of two self-titled albums, ''Lucio Dalla'', followed by ''Dalla'' in 1980.

The song "[[Caruso (song)|Caruso]]", released in 1986, has been covered by numerous international artists such as [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and [[Julio Iglesias]]. The version sung by Pavarotti sold over 9 million copies, and another version was a track on [[Andrea Bocelli]]'s first international album, ''[[Romanza]]'', which sold over 20&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref name="Columbus Dispatch">[http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2011/11/27/timeless-tenor.html Crossover superstar Andrea Bocelli finds beauty in wide range of music] [[The Columbus Dispatch]], 27 November 2011.</ref> [[Maynard Ferguson]] also covered the song on his album "Brass Attitude", after having previously paid tribute to Caruso with his rendition of "[[Vesti la giubba]]" (titled as "Pagliacci") on the album ''Primal Scream''.<ref>Maynard Ferguson, "Primal Scream", CD (Columbia Records, 1976)</ref>

The 1990 hit single "Attenti al lupo" gave Dalla wider success in Europe. He was invited to duet on ''Pavarotti and friends'', singing his hit "Caruso" with Pavarotti.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRGuFM4DR2Y|title=Luciano Pavarotti & Lucio Dalla|publisher=Youtube|date=18 December 2009|access-date=4 August 2013}}</ref>

In 2010, Dalla came back to work with [[Francesco De Gregori]] during the "Work in Progress" tour and album. Dalla's main influences were to be found in [[jazz]], but his songs ranged from [[Folk music|folk]] ("Attenti al lupo") and pop ("Lunedì"), from [[Italian singer-songwriters]] (the albums from ''Com'è profondo il mare'' to ''Dalla'') to classical and opera ("Caruso").<ref name="huffingtonpost1">{{cite news|author=Frances D'Emilio|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/01/lucio-dalla-dead_n_1313115.html|title=Lucio Dalla Dead: Italian Singer-Songwriter Dies At 68|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|date=1 March 2012|access-date=4 August 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Lucio Dalla was outed as gay after his funeral (at which his longterm associate and partner Marco Alemanno, with whom he had shared a house, spoke), although he had not publicly acknowledged this during his life, saying in a 1979 interview "Non mi sento omosessuale" ("I do not feel gay").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/03/05/news/dalla_dom_chessa-30986032|title=Le polemiche su Lucio Dalla sono una vendetta dei gay|publisher=La Repubblica|date=5 March 2012|access-date=21 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2012/03/06/spettacoli/dalla-confesso-non-mi-sento-omosessuale-Zmn5sHg5uUz1hJpzkyvpqI/pagina.html|title=Dalla confessò: non-mi sento omosessuale|publisher=La Stampa|date=6 March 2012|access-date=21 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://societa.panorama.it/Lucio-Dalla-gay-ma-quale-ipocrisia-Era-solo-una-persona-riservata-parola-di-Alfonso-Signorini|title=Lucio Dalla gay, ma quale ipocrisia?
