and used rules, dictated in the script, to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. As such, ELIZA was one of the first [[chatterbot]]s and one of the first programs capable of attempting the [[Turing test]].

ELIZA's creator, Weizenbaum, regarded the program as a method to show the superficiality of communication between man and machine, but was surprised by the number of individuals who attributed human-like feelings to the computer program, including Weizenbaum’s secretary.<ref name=":0" /> Many academics believed that the program would be able to positively influence the lives of many people, particularly those suffering from psychological issues, and that it could aid doctors working on such patients' treatment.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00005053-196602000-00005 |pmid=5936301 |title=A Computer Method of Psychotherapy |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=148–52 |year=1966 |last1=Colby |first1=Kenneth Mark |last2=Watt |first2=James B. |last3=Gilbert |first3=John P. }}</ref> While ELIZA was capable of engaging in discourse, ELIZA could not converse with true understanding.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.01.004 |title=Can machines talk?

[[Joseph Weizenbaum]]’s ELIZA, running the DOCTOR script, was created to provide a [[parody]] of "the responses of a non-directional psychotherapist in an initial psychiatric interview"<ref>Weizenbaum 1976, p. 188.</ref> and to "demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0747-5632(01)00004-8 |title=From Eliza to Internet: A brief history of computerized assessment |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=295–314 |year=2001 |last1=Epstein |first1=J. |last2=Klinkenberg |first2=W.

Weizenbaum named his program ELIZA after [[Eliza Doolittle]], a working-class character in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]''. According to Weizenbaum, ELIZA's ability to be "incrementally improved" by various users made it similar to Eliza Doolittle,<ref name=":1"/> since Eliza Doolittle was taught to speak with an [[upper-class]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] in Shaw's play.<ref name="weizenbaumobit">{{Citation |last=Markoff |first=John |title=Joseph Weizenbaum, Famed Programmer, Is Dead at 85 |date=2008-03-13 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/world/europe/13weizenbaum.html |author-link=John Markoff |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2009-01-07}}.</ref> However, unlike in Shaw's play, ELIZA is incapable of learning new patterns of speech or new words through interaction alone. Edits must be made directly to ELIZA’s active script in order to change the manner by which the program operates.

Weizenbaum first implemented ELIZA in his own [[SLIP (programming language)|SLIP]] list-processing language, where, depending upon the initial entries by the user, the illusion of human intelligence could appear, or be dispelled through several interchanges. Some of ELIZA's responses were so convincing that Weizenbaum and several others have anecdotes of users becoming emotionally attached to the program, occasionally forgetting that they were conversing with a computer.<ref name=":0" /> Weizenbaum's own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation. Weizenbaum was surprised by this, later writing: "I had not realized&nbsp;... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people."<ref name="Weizenbaum1">{{cite book |title=Computer power and human reason: from judgment to calculation |url=https://archive.org/details/computerpowerhum0000weiz |url-access=registration |last=Weizenbaum |first=Joseph |publisher=W.

In 1966, interactive computing (via a teletype) was new. It was 15 years before the personal computer became familiar to the general public, and three decades before most people encountered attempts at [[natural language processing]] in Internet services like [[Ask.com]] or PC help systems such as Microsoft Office [[Office Assistant|Clippit]]. Although those programs included years of research and work, ELIZA remains a milestone simply because it was the first time a programmer had attempted such a human-machine interaction with the goal of creating the illusion (however brief) of human–''human'' interaction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

At the [[International Conference on Computer Communications|ICCC 1972]] ELIZA was brought together with another early artificial-intelligence program named [[PARRY]] for a computer-only conversation. While ELIZA was built to speak as a doctor, PARRY was intended to simulate a patient with [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="PerryElizaAtlantic">{{cite magazine |last1=Megan |first1=Garber |title=When PARRY Met ELIZA: A Ridiculous Chatbot Conversation From 1972 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/when-parry-met-eliza-a-ridiculous-chatbot-conversation-from-1972/372428/ |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=19 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118165304/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/when-parry-met-eliza-a-ridiculous-chatbot-conversation-from-1972/372428/ |archive-date=2017-01-18 |url-status=live |date=Jun 9, 2014}}</ref>

==Design==

Weizenbaum originally wrote ELIZA in MAD-Slip for the IBM 7094, as a program to make natural-language conversation possible with a computer. To accomplish this, Weizenbaum identified five "fundamental technical problems" for ELIZA to overcome: the identification of critical words, the discovery of a minimal context, the choice of appropriate transformations, the generation of responses appropriate to the transformation or in the absence of critical words and the provision of an ending capacity for ELIZA scripts.<ref name=":1" /> Weizenbaum solved these problems in his ELIZA program and made ELIZA such that it had no built-in contextual framework or universe of discourse.<ref name=":4" /> However, this required ELIZA to have a script of instructions on how to respond to inputs from users.

ELIZA starts its process of responding to an input by a user by first examining the text input for a "keyword".<ref name=":6" /> A "keyword" is a word designated as important by the acting ELIZA script, which assigns to each keyword a precedence number, or a RANK, designed by the programmer.<ref name=":3" /> If such words are found, they are put into a "keystack", with the keyword of the highest RANK at the top. The input sentence is then manipulated and transformed as the rule associated with the keyword of the highest RANK directs.<ref name=":1" /> For example, when the DOCTOR script encounters words such as "alike" or "same", it would output a message pertaining to similarity, in this case “In what way?”,<ref name=":2" /> as these words had high precedence number. This also demonstrates how certain words, as dictated by the script, can be manipulated regardless of contextual considerations, such as switching first-person pronouns and second-person pronouns and vice versa, as these too had high precedence numbers. Such words with high precedence numbers are deemed superior to conversational patterns and are treated independently of contextual patterns.

Following the first examination, the next step of the process is to apply an appropriate transformation rule, which includes two parts: the "decomposition rule" and the "reassembly rule".<ref name=":1" /> First, the input is reviewed for syntactical patterns in order to establish the minimal context necessary to respond. Using the keywords and other nearby words from the input, different disassembly rules are tested until an appropriate pattern is found. Using the script's rules, the sentence is then "dismantled" and arranged into sections of the component parts as the "decomposition rule for the highest-ranking keyword" dictates. The example that Weizenbaum gives is the input "I are very helpful" (remembering that "I" is "You" transformed), which is broken into (1) empty (2) "I" (3) "are" (4) "very helpful". The decomposition rule has broken the phrase into four small segments that contain both the keywords and the information in the sentence.<ref name=":1" />

The decomposition rule then designates a particular reassembly rule, or set of reassembly rules, to follow when reconstructing the sentence.<ref name=":6" /> The reassembly rule takes the fragments of the input that the decomposition rule had created, rearranges them, and adds in programmed words to create a response. Using Weizenbaum's example previously stated, such a reassembly rule would take the fragments and apply them to the phrase "What makes you think I am (4)", which would result in "What makes you think I am very helpful?". This example is rather simple, since depending upon the disassembly rule, the output could be significantly more complex and use more of the input from the user. However, from this reassembly, ELIZA then sends the constructed sentence to the user in the form of text on the screen.<ref name=":1" />

These steps represent the bulk of the procedures that ELIZA follows in order to create a response from a typical input, though there are several specialized situations that ELIZA/DOCTOR can respond to. One Weizenbaum specifically wrote about was when there is no keyword. One solution was to have ELIZA respond with a remark that lacked content, such as "I see" or "Please go on".<ref name=":1" /> The second method was to use a "MEMORY" structure, which recorded prior recent inputs, and would use these inputs to create a response referencing a part of the earlier conversation when encountered with no keywords.<ref name=":5" /> This was possible due to Slip’s ability to tag words for other usage, which simultaneously allowed ELIZA to examine, store and repurpose words for usage in outputs.<ref name=":1" />

While these functions were all framed in ELIZA's programming, the exact manner by which the program dismantled, examined, and reassembled inputs is determined by the operating script. The script is not static and can be edited, or a new one created, as is necessary for the operation in the context needed. This would allow the program to be applied in multiple situations, including the well-known DOCTOR script, which simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist.

A [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] version of ELIZA, based on Weizenbaum's CACM paper, was written shortly after that paper's publication, by Bernie Cosell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codersatwork.com/bernie-cosell.html |title=Coders at Work: Bernie Cosell |website=codersatwork.com}}</ref><ref name="elizagen">{{cite web |url=http://elizagen.org/index.html |title=elizagen.org |website=elizagen.org}}</ref> A [[BASIC]] version appeared in [[Creative Computing]] in 1977 (although it was written in 1973 by Jeff Shrager).<ref>[http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/showpage.php?page=20 Big Computer Games: Eliza – Your own psychotherapist] at www.atariarchives.org.</ref> This version, which was ported to many of the earliest personal computers, appears to have been subsequently translated into many other versions in many other languages. Shrager claims not to have seen either Weizenbaum's or Cosell's versions.

In 2021 Jeff Shrager searched MIT's Weizenbaum archives, along with MIT archivist Myles Crowley, and found files labeled Computer Conversations. These included the complete source code listing of ELIZA in MAD-SLIP, with the DOCTOR script attached. The Weizenbaum estate has given permission to open-source this code under a Creative Commons CC0 public domain license. The code and other information can be see on the ELIZAGEN site.<ref name="elizagen" />

Another version of Eliza popular among software engineers is the version that comes with the default release of [[GNU Emacs]], and which can be accessed by typing <code>[[Meta key|M]]-x doctor</code> from most modern Emacs implementations.

==In popular culture==
In 1969, [[George Lucas]] and [[Walter Murch]] incorporated an Eliza-like dialogue interface in their screenplay for the feature film ''[[THX-1138]]''. Inhabitants of the underground future world of THX, when stressed, would retreat to "confession booths" and initiate a one-sided Eliza-formula conversation with a Jesus-faced computer who claimed to be "OMM".

ELIZA influenced a number of early [[computer games]] by demonstrating additional kinds of [[interface design]]s. [[Don Daglow]] wrote an enhanced version of the program called ''[[Ecala]]'' on a [[DEC PDP-10]] [[minicomputer]] at [[Pomona College]] in 1973 before writing the computer [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeon (computer game)|Dungeon]]'' (1975).

ELIZA is given credit as additional vocals on track 10 of the [[eponym]]ous [[Information Society (album)|''Information Society'']] album.

In the 2008 anime ''RD Sennou Chousashitsu'', also known as ''[[Real Drive]]'', a character named Eliza Weizenbaum appears, an obvious tribute to ELIZA and [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]. Her behavior in the story often mimics the responses of the ELIZA program.

The 2011 video game ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'' and the 2016 sequel ''[[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided]]'' features an artificial-intelligence Picus TV Network newsreader named Eliza Cassan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/08/25/deus-ex-mankind-divideds-ending-is-disappointing-in-a-different-way/|title='Deus Ex: Mankind Divided's Ending Is Disappointing In A Different Way|last=Tassi|first=Paul|website=Forbes|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

In [[Adam Curtis]]'s 2016 documentary, ''[[HyperNormalisation]]'', ELIZA was referenced in relationship to [[post-truth]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quietus {{!}} Opinion {{!}} Black Sky Thinking {{!}} HyperNormalisation: Is Adam Curtis, Like Trump, Just A Master Manipulator? |url=https://thequietus.com/articles/21077-adam-curtis-hypernormalisation-review-bbc-politics-doom |website=The Quietus |access-date=26 June 2021 |language=en-us}}</ref>

In the [[List of Young Sheldon episodes#ep12|twelfth episode]] of the American sitcom ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', aired in January 2018, starred the [[Sheldon Cooper|protagonist]] "conversing" with ELIZA, hoping to resolve a domestic issue.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/01/18/young-sheldon-episode-12-recap-familys-first-computer-almost-tears-it-apart.html |title=Young Sheldon Episode 12 recap: The family's first computer almost tears it apart |last=McCarthy |first=Tyler |date=2018-01-18 |work=Fox News |access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>

On August 12, 2019, [[independent game developer]] [[Zachtronics]] published a [[visual novel]] called ''[[Eliza (video game)|Eliza]]'', about an AI-based counseling service inspired by ELIZA.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/08/01/the-next-zachtronics-game-is-eliza-a-visual-novel-about-ai/ |title=The next Zachtronics game is Eliza, a visual novel about AI |last=O'Connor |first=Alice |date=2019-08-01 |website=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/eliza-review-startup-culture-meets-sci-fi-in-a-touching-fascinating-tale/ |title=Eliza review: Startup culture meets sci-fi in a touching, fascinating tale |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |date=August 12, 2019 |access-date=August 12, 2019 |work=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref>

==Response and legacy==
Lay responses to ELIZA were disturbing to Weizenbaum and motivated him to write his book ''[[Computer Power and Human Reason|Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation]]'', in which he explains the limits of computers, as he wants to make clear his opinion that the anthropomorphic views of computers are just a reduction of the human being and any life form for that matter. In the independent documentary film ''[[Plug & Pray]]'' (2010) Weizenbaum said that only people who misunderstood ELIZA called it a sensation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html |title=Content: Plug & Pray Film – Artificial Intelligence – Robots |last=maschafilm |website=plugandpray-film.de}}</ref>

The [[Israel]]i poet [[David Avidan]], who was fascinated with future technologies and their relation to art, desired to explore the use of computers for writing literature. He conducted several conversations with an [[APL (programming language)|APL]] implementation of ELIZA and published them – in English, and in his own translation to [[Hebrew]] – under the title ''My Electronic Psychiatrist – Eight Authentic Talks with a Computer''. In the foreword he presented it as a form of [[constrained writing]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Avidan |first=David |title=Collected Poems |volume=3 |year=2010 |publisher=Hakibbutz Hameuchad |location=Jerusalem |oclc=804664009}}.</ref>

There are many programs based on ELIZA in different programming languages. In 1980 a company called "Don't Ask Software" created a version called "[[Abuse (chatterbot)|Abuse]]" for the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari]], and [[Commodore 64]] computers, which verbally abused the user based on the user's input.<ref name="abusereview">{{cite news|last=Davidson |first=Steve |title=Abuse |newspaper=Electronic Games |date=January 1983 |volume=1 |issue=11 |url=http://www.atarimania.com/magazine_review.awp?id=86}}.</ref> Other versions adapted ELIZA around a religious theme, such as ones featuring Jesus (both serious and comedic), and another Apple II variant called ''I Am Buddha''. The 1980 game ''[[The Prisoner (computer game)|The Prisoner]]'' incorporated ELIZA-style interaction within its gameplay. In 1988 the British artist and friend of Weizenbaum [[Brian Reffin Smith]] created two art-oriented ELIZA-style programs written in [[BASIC]], one called "Critic" and the other "Artist", running on two separate [[Amiga 1000]] computers and showed them at the exhibition "Salamandre" in the Musée du Berry, [[Bourges]], France. The visitor was supposed to help them converse by typing in to "Artist" what "Critic" said, and vice versa. The secret was that the two programs were identical. [[GNU Emacs]] formerly had a <code>psychoanalyze-pinhead</code> [[Command (computing)|command]] that simulates a session between ELIZA and [[Zippy the Pinhead]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/lol/pinhead.html |title=lol:> psychoanalyze-pinhead}}</ref> The Zippyisms were removed due to copyright issues, but the DOCTOR program remains.

ELIZA has been referenced in popular culture and continues to be a source of inspiration for programmers and developers focused on artificial intelligence. It was also featured in a 2012 exhibit at [[Harvard University]] titled "Go Ask A.L.I.C.E", as part of a celebration of mathematician [[Alan Turing]]'s 100th birthday. The exhibit explores Turing's lifelong fascination with the interaction between humans and computers, pointing to ELIZA as one of the earliest realizations of Turing's ideas.<ref name=turing/>
