__NOTOC__

==History==
Urgehal was formed by Trondr Nefas and Enzifer in 1992. They released two demos in 1994 and 1995. Early in 1996 they got a record deal with the German label No Colours and recorded their debut album ''Arma Christi'' the same year. The follow-up, ''Massive Terrestrial Strike'', was released in 1997. The band then switched to the label Flesh For Beast. The album ''Atomkinder'' was released in 2001 and the next, ''Through Thick Fog 'till Death'', was released in 2003. Flesh For Beast then retired and their fifth album, ''Goatcraft Torment'', was released in 2006 through its sister label Agonia Records. Shortly after, a 15-year anniversary album called ''The Eternal Eclipse'' was released, containing rarities and a large photo booklet which traces the band's history. In 2007, the band signed to Season of Mist. Most of the songs for the next album were written that year. However, due to internal problems, the recording was stalled. The album, ''Ikonoklast'', was finally released in early 2009.<ref name=metalglory>[http://www.metalglory.de/interviews.php?nr=738 "Urgehal - Interview"]. ''Metal Glory'' magazine. 11 January 2010.

Guitarist/vocalist Trondr Nefas died in May 2012, aged 34. According to a statement from the band, the death was sudden but said that he "died a peaceful and natural death" in the woods "at one of his favorite places".<ref>{{cite web
