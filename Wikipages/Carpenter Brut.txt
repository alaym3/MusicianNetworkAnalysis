He later released two additional studio albums, ''Leather Teeth'' (2018) and ''Blood Machines OST'' (2020), along with one live album, ''CARPENTERBRUTLIVE'' (2017).

==History==
===Origins===
Hueso describes the beginnings of Carpenter Brut as "a joke," and contends that the name Carpenter Brut is a play on words, derived from the surname of filmmaker and composer [[John Carpenter]] and the champagne [[Charpentier Brut]].<ref name="GRIMMGENT-SEPT-2019-P4">{{cite web|url=https://www.grimmgent.com/interview-carpenter-brut-metalheads-who-are-used-to-digging-deeper-will-realize-the-music-is-kitschy-fun-and-not-kitschy-dumb-gmm-2019/4/|title=Interview Carpenter Brut – “Metalheads Who Are Used To Digging Deeper Will Realize The Music Is Kitschy Fun And Not Kitschy Dumb” (GMM 2019)|work=Grimm Gent|access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref> The idea to make electronic music stemmed from wanting to write music alone, rather than being in a band. Hueso explained in 2017 "Electro music is perfect for that [writing alone], especially when you’re not a good musician like me. I don’t know how to play guitar; it would have been a poor decision."<ref name="NEWRETROWAVE-MAR-2017-P4">{{cite web|url=https://newretrowave.com/2017/03/01/carpenter-brut-interview/|title=Carpenter Brut Interview|work=New Retro Wave|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>

===EPs & ''Trilogy'' (2012–2015)===
Carpenter Brut's 2012 and 2013 EP's were released on BlackBvs Records. The third EP, in 2015 (and all subsequent releases, {{as of|lc=y|April 2020}}), were released on Hueso's own No Quarter Prod label. The label was created with the intention of allowing Hueso to remain independent and maintain control over his own image and art.<ref name="RETRO-SYNTHWAVE-2017">{{Cite web |url=https://www.retro-synthwave.com/music/retro-interviews/carpenter-brut-interview |title=Carpenter Brut Interview |website=Retro Synthwave |access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref> Additionally, two songs from TRILOGY (Le perv and Roller Mobster) were used in the soundtrack for [[Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number]]. The track "Escape from Midwich Valley" was used in one of the game's trailers.

===''Leather Teeth'' (2018)===
Carpenter Brut's second full-length album was released at midnight on February 22, 2018 with no pre-release promotion.<ref name="METALSUCKS-FEB-2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2018/02/23/carpenter-brut-surprise-released-new-album-leather-teeth-last-night/|title=Carpenter Brut Surprise-Released New Album ''Leather Teeth'' Last Night!|work=MetalSucks.net|access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref> A press release accompanying the release read: "Leather Teeth is the soundtrack to a movie envisioned by Carpenter Brut, one that tells the story of a shy American teenager, Bret Halford, who can’t get the girl and will do anything he can to win her over, including becoming the singer of one of the most talked about bands in mid-‘80s glam-metal, Leather Patrol." The press release included a quote from Carpenter Brut, describing the album as "pure frenzy like [[Master of Puppets]], or any of the good old metal albums."<ref name="METALSUCKS-FEB-2018"/> ''Leather Teeth'' features [[Kristoffer Rygg]] of [[Ulver]] and [[Mat McNerney]] of [[Grave Pleasures]] on vocals.<ref name="MESSEDMAG-APR-2018"/>

In a December, 2018 interview, Hueso explained that ''Leather Teeth'' was inspired by "[[Judas Priest]], and the [[glam rock]] of the '80s."<ref name="VEHLINGGO-DEC-2019">{{cite web|url=https://vehlinggo.com/2018/12/06/carpenter-brut-interview/|title=The Changing Color of Carpenter Brut: A Q&A|work=Vehlinggo.com|access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref> It is the first album in a trilogy and tells the story of "[a] main character [who] is still a young student in love, and not yet the serial killer he will become in the second part of the trilogy. Even if he has tantrums as in “Monday Hunt” or “Hairspray Hurricane,” he is still convinced that he can conquer Kendra, the cheerleader."<ref name="VEHLINGGO-DEC-2019"/> Hueso described himself, in a 2018 interview, as being "tired of this race to whoever makes the darkest or most brutal music, it’s just bullshit," while describing ''Leather Teeth'''s sound as being "softer" and "more glamorous" than ''Trilogy'' "while flirting with a dark side that will be developed in the next album," a sequel which he intends to be "darker and more violent."<ref name="MESSEDMAG-APR-2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.messedmag.com/2018/04/17/carpenter-brut-shows-his-leather-teeth-interview/|title=Carpenter Brut shows his leather teeth: Interview|work=Messed Mag|access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="VEHLINGGO-DEC-2019"/>

===''Blood Machines OST'' (2020)===
Carpenter Brut's ''Blood Machines OST'' was released in April, 2020. It is the soundtrack to a 50-minute film directed by Seth Ickerman, director of the "Turbo Killer" music video. The idea came from online response to "Turbo Killer" and requests for a sequel; the film was devised by Ickerman while Hueso describes himself as being "in charge of the soundtrack."<ref name="NEWRETROWAVE-MAR-2017-P4"/><ref name="RETRO-SYNTHWAVE-2017"/>

===''Leather Terror'' (2022)===
Hueso has suggested that a new Carpenter Brut album may be released by the end of 2020 "at the very earliest."<ref name="GRIMMGENT-SEPT-2019-P2">{{cite web|url=https://www.grimmgent.com/interview-carpenter-brut-metalheads-who-are-used-to-digging-deeper-will-realize-the-music-is-kitschy-fun-and-not-kitschy-dumb-gmm-2019/2/|title=Interview Carpenter Brut – “Metalheads Who Are Used To Digging Deeper Will Realize The Music Is Kitschy Fun And Not Kitschy Dumb” (GMM 2019)|work=Grimm Gent|access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref> On May 19, 2021, he announced on Twitter that ''Leather Terror'' would be released in early 2022.<ref name=":0">{{cite tweet |author=Carpenter Brut |author-link=Carpenter Brut |user=carpenter_brut |number=1395038128252104709 |date=19 May 2021 |title="Leather Terror" will be released in early 2022 |language=en |access-date=27 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519181752/https://twitter.com/carpenter_brut/status/1395038128252104709 |archive-date=19 May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> The album will involve a "reinvention" of Carpenter Brut and taking the music "on a darker path." It will be a continuation of the ''Leather Teeth'' trilogy and will involve a story of "a character who wants to take revenge on the cheerleader who’s been making fun of him 'serial killer style'."<ref name="GRIMMGENT-SEPT-2019-P2"/> The album will include 12 tracks,<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Carpenter Brut |author-link=Carpenter Brut |user=carpenter_brut |number=1395039427026735116 |date=19 May 2021 |title=12 songs, from Madonna to In Slaughter Natives |language=en |access-date=27 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519224533/https://twitter.com/carpenter_brut/status/1395039427026735116 |archive-date=19 May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> with a North American and European tour to follow.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Carpenter Brut |author-link=Carpenter Brut |user=carpenter_brut |number=1395039893030686724 |date=19 May 2021 |title=North America / Europe tour and festivals will follow. |language=en |access-date=27 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519173136/https://twitter.com/carpenter_brut/status/1395039893030686724 |archive-date=19 May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> Hueso described one track off the album as "really long, really violent, and which will have much more of a black metal vibe to it. The ending will go on for about five minutes and will consist of only blast beats." Hueso suggested [[Ben Koller]] of [[Converge (band)|Converge]] would perform on the track.<ref name="GRIMMGENT-SEPT-2019-P2"/>

===Other appearances===
Hueso also wrote music for the 2016 video game [[Furi]], a process which he described as being "a lot less free" than composing music for Carpenter Brut. Hueso explained that he was required to work with scenes that the video game designers sent, while also working with loops that can go on for several minutes if the player decided to stay in the same place.<ref name="NEWRETROWAVE-MAR-2017-P4"/> Ultimately, Hueso described it as "a good experience," but wasn't sure he would attempt it again, citing a greater affinity for soundtracks for film than video games.<ref name="NEWRETROWAVE-MAR-2017-P4"/>

In 2019 Hueso appeared in the documentary film [[The Rise of the Synths]] which explored the origins and growth of the genre. Hueso appeared alongside various other composers from the Synthwave scene, including [[John Carpenter]] himself who also starred in and narrated the film.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Music videos==
===Music videos===
When working on a trailer for ''Festival de l’Etrange'', director duo  Raphaël Hernandez and Savitri Joly-Gonfard (working under the name [[Seth Ickerman]]) approached Hueso with the request to use the track "Hang'em All" for the trailer's soundtrack. Having been aware of the duo and liking their "DIY and smart" approach to their work, Hueso allowed use of the track and Ickerman went on to direct all of Carpenter Brut's music videos for the first three EP's.<ref name="RETRO-SYNTHWAVE-2017"/>

For the music video to "Turbo Killer," Hueso gave "carte blanche" to the directors, with the only stipulation that they "give birth to certain characters" he had in mind. Hueso saw the video two weeks before its wide release and described his reaction to it as "thrilled [...] like a kid opening his Christmas presents," and wondering "how the fuck did they do that?"<ref name="RETRO-SYNTHWAVE-2017"/>

The music videos for the album ''Leather Teeth'' were directed by [[Silver Strain]], who also created the visuals projected during Carpenter Brut's live performances.<ref name="GRIMMGENT-SEPT-2019-P1">{{cite web|url=https://www.grimmgent.com/interview-carpenter-brut-metalheads-who-are-used-to-digging-deeper-will-realize-the-music-is-kitschy-fun-and-not-kitschy-dumb-gmm-2019/|title=Interview Carpenter Brut – “Metalheads Who Are Used To Digging Deeper Will Realize The Music Is Kitschy Fun And Not Kitschy Dumb” (GMM 2019)|work=Grimm Gent|access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="GRIMMGENT-SEPT-2019-P2"/>

===Blood Machines (2020)===
Blood Machines is a film project with Seth Ickerman as director and scored by Carpenter Brut. A trailer for the film was released to Kickstarter backers on 20 May 2020 and on [[Shudder (streaming service)|Shudder]] the following day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bloodmachines.com/index.php/front-page-2/faq/ |title=FAQ |website=Blood Machines website |accessdate=19 December 2020 }}</ref> The official synopsis reads:

====History and overview====
Ickerman had wanted to make a feature length film using a Carpenter Brut soundtrack prior to the release of the Turbo Killer music video,<ref name="NEWRETROWAVE-MAR-2017-P4"/> and due to the success of Turbo Killer and fan requests for a follow-up, Blood Machines entered development.<ref name="NEWRETROWAVE-MAR-2017-P4"/> A successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign saw the film jump from an estimated run time of 30 minutes to 50 minutes;<ref name="JOBLO-MAY-2019"/> it is expected to be released in 2020 and will be a sequel to the Turbo Killer music video.<ref name="SCREENANARCHY-DEC-2016"/> As with their earlier collaborations, Ickerman have "free rein" in terms of the visuals, with Hueso describing himself as being "in charge of the soundtrack."<ref name="RETRO-SYNTHWAVE-2017"/> In December, 2016, David Sandberg, director of ''[[Kung Fury]]'' (2015), signed on to ''Blood Machines'' as producer; a press release for the announcement described the film's plot as "following two space hunters chasing the female ghost of a machine through the galaxy."<ref name="SCREENANARCHY-DEC-2016">{{cite web|url=https://screenanarchy.com/2016/12/kung-fury-helmer-signs-on-to-blood-machines.html|title=KUNG FURY Helmer Signs On To BLOOD MACHINES|work=Screen Anarchy|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>

==Influences==
"At the very beginning," Hueso commented, Carpenter Brut was influenced by [[Justice (band)|Justice]], but by 2017 he would be "much more inspired by [[progressive rock|prog rock]] artists," like [[Toto (band)|Toto]] and [[Supertramp]] along with [[Iron Maiden (band)|Iron Maiden]], [[Meshuggah]], [[Ulver]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Type O Negative]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Beatles]].<ref name="CRYPTICROCK-MAR-2017">{{Cite web |url=https://crypticrock.com/interview-carpenter-brut/ |title=Interview - Carpenter Brut |website=Cryptic Rock |access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref> In a 2019 interview with [[Kerrang!]], Hueso stated that his early musical influences included Iron Maiden, [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Napalm Death]].<ref name="KERRANG-FEB-2020">{{cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/how-carpenter-brut-are-revolutionising-heavy-music-at-the-forefront-of-the-synthwave-insurgency/|title=How Carpenter Brut Are Revolutionising Heavy Music At The Forefront Of The Synthwave Insurgency|work=Kerrang!|access-date=9 February 2020}}</ref> Hueso claimed in 2016 to not listen to horror movie soundtracks, but noted there were "themes that stand out," such as ''[[Creepshow]]'', ''[[Maniac Cop]]'' and ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' and that he does enjoy the compositions of [[John Williams]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Alan Silvestri]] and [[James Horner]].<ref name="DIABOLIQUE-SEPT-2016">{{cite web|url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/confessions-of-a-disco-zombi-carpenter-brut-interview/|title=Confessions of a Disco Zombi: Carpenter Brut Interview|work=Diabolique Magazine|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>

Cinematically, Hueso's influences include 1980s "Slasher/Horror/B-movies as well as blockbusters," and Hueso has specifically noted, "everything from [[Steven Spielberg]]" along with ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Street Trash]]'', ''[[Bad Taste]]'', ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', ''[[Nekromantik]]'' and ''Maniac Cop'', commenting, "not only did I find that these films were totally badass, but their soundtracks were too. Music was an integral part of the movies, that’s what I enjoyed." Ultimately he concluded that, "those influences run through everything Carpenter Brut does: the desire to give you something violent, cinematic and fun!"<ref name="KERRANG-FEB-2020"/><ref name="RETRO-SYNTHWAVE-2017"/>

Hueso bases his live performances on those of [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]], stating "I didn’t like playing live at the beginning [...] I just wanted to make music in my room. When it became clear that people wanted me to play I worked hard to put on a real show. It’s the same as Trent Reznor with Nine Inch Nails: if I’m going to play live, it needs to be huge."<ref name="KERRANG-FEB-2020"/>
