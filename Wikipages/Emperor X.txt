'''Chad R. Matheny''', known professionally as '''Emperor X''', is an American singer and songwriter.

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] in 1979,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11735-tectonic-membranethin-strip-on-an-edgeless-platform/ |title=Emperor X: Tectonic Membrane/Thin Strip on an Edgeless Platform |date=1 July 2004 |website=Pitchfork |language=en |access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref> Matheny got his start in music when he was given a [[Casio SK-1]] by his grandparents at age nine, and recorded his first album on a [[Tascam]] [[Multitrack recording|four-track]] before the age of 20.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Ubl|first1=Sam|title=Tectonic Membrane/Thin Strip on an Edgeless Platform Review|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11735-tectonic-membranethin-strip-on-an-edgeless-platform/|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>

Matheny tours across the [[United States]] regularly and performs around the world as well, including tours in [[Mexico]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Matheny|first1=Chad|title=A POORLY-FORMATTED BUT COMPLETE {{sic|LST|hide=y}} OF EVERY EMPEROR X {{sic|PERFO|RMACE|hide=y}} EVER SO FAR|url=http://emperorx.net/pastshows.html|website=Emperor X Official Website|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>

In a self-described attempt to "address the diminishing utility of physical copies of music and the expanding role of marketing in the experience of art",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wasoba|first1=Ryan|title=Emperor X On Stock Responses And Performative Marketing|url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2011/10/emperor_x_interview_tour_western_teleport.php|website=Riverfront Times|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref> Matheny often hides or buries one-off physical copies and associated visual artwork of [[b-sides]] at [[GPS]] coordinates and posts them online as a part of a [[geocaching]] game to unlock [[MP3]] copies of the audio. For the release of the 2011 Emperor X album ''[[Western Teleport]]'', 41 "translucent purple [[audio cassettes]]" were buried across [[North America]], many of which remain undiscovered. This received a feature on [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s "[[Weekend Edition]]" program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/10/08/130436918/digging-for-tunes-with-emperor-x|title=Digging For Tunes With Emperor X|website=NPR.org}}</ref>

In 2014, Matheny wrote the song "Don't Change Color, Kitty" for [[99% Invisible]], based on Françoise Bastide and Paolo Fabbri's concept of a [[Long-time nuclear waste warning messages|millennia-long nuclear waste warning message]] in the form of a folk song about genetically engineered cats. Matheny wrote it to be "so catchy and annoying that it might be handed down from generation to generation over a span of 10,000 years".<ref>{{cite news |title=Raycats and earworms: How scientists are using colour-changing cats and nursery rhymes to warn future generations of nuclear danger |url=https://www.cityam.com/how-scientists-are-using-colour-changing-cats-and-folklore-warn-future-generations/ |accessdate=7 November 2020 |work=CityAM |date=24 November 2014}}</ref>

In 2020, Matheny and Christian Holden from [[The Hotelier]] started an artist-managed record label cooperative known as Dreams of Field Recordings.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=emperorx|number=1222197007512670209|date=28 January 2020|title=Please meet @DreamsofField, an artist-managed record label cooperative that Christian @moldyfish @thehotelyear and I are setting up as our new label home. dreamsoffield.com}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Matheny is a former [[high school]] [[science]] teacher,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deusner|first1=Stephen|title=The Most Underrated Albums of 2011|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/12/24/the_most_underrated_albums_of_2011/|website=Salon|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref> and in 2004 he stopped his pursuit of a [[master's degree]] in [[physics]] in order to dedicate his career to music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emperor X Biography|url=http://www.bar-none.com/emperor-x/|website=Bar None Records}}</ref>

Matheny is a [[testicular cancer]] survivor and is [[legally blind]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Indieheads Podcast interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIdJZ8vwXXA#t=54m05s|website=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Greenspan|first1=Sam|title=Emperor X: 'We Are Much More Than The Sum Of The Diseases And Disabilities We Carry'|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/09/10/549489252/emperor-x-we-are-much-more-than-the-sum-of-the-diseases-and-disabilities-we-carr|website=NPR.org|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref>
