'''Haggard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|g|ər|d}}) is a German [[symphonic metal]] band founded in 1989.<ref name="me">{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Haggard/63 |title= Haggard |website=[[Encyclopaedia Metallum]] |access-date=17 May 2015}}</ref> The group combines [[classical music]] and [[early music]] with [[death doom metal]].

==History==
[[File:Haggard at Evolution Festival 02.jpg|thumb|Haggard in 2006]]
Haggard was founded in 1989 and originally played [[death metal]].<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|url={{allmusic|id=p541455|pure_url=yes}} |title=Haggard Biography |first=Chris |last=True |work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 April 2011}}</ref> They changed their musical style after their first [[Demo (music)|demo]] tape, ''Introduction'' in 1992, becoming a band with symphonic melodies and classical instruments but folk themes. The album ''[[And Thou Shalt Trust... the Seer]]'' marked their breakthrough in 1997. After their second album ''[[Awaking the Centuries]]'' (the life of the prophet Nostradamus), they toured through Mexico twice. In 2004, they released their third album ''[[Eppur Si Muove (album)|Eppur Si Muove]]'' which is about the life of Italian scholar [[Galileo Galilei]], sentenced to house arrest for [[heresy]] by the Catholic Church for supporting [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus']] claim that the Earth revolved around the sun.

Just before their album ''Awaking the Centuries'' was released, the group had its highest number of musicians at 21. All their songs are written by vocalist and guitarist [[Asis Nasseri]].

The fourth album, ''[[Tales of Ithiria]]'', was released in 2008 and is based on a fantasy story.

In 2010, the band had its first concert along with a symphonic orchestra. Haggard played together with the [[Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra|philharmonic orchestra of Plovdiv]] in the Bulgarian city of [[Plovdiv]] on 19 April 2010.

Although a new album with the title of ''Grimm'' was originally announced for the end of 2012, the album has since been postponed indefinitely.
