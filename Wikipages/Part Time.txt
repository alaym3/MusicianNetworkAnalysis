'''Part Time''' (stylized as '''PARTIME''') was an American [[pop music|pop]] band that was fronted by California-based musician David Loca (also credited as David Speck).<ref name="wolf">{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Wolf |title=Q&A: DAVIDA LOCA OF PART TIME |url=http://www.krtuindie.org/blog/2018/11/11/qampa-davida-loca-of-part-time |date=November 11, 2018|website=[[KRTU Indie]]}}</ref><ref name="AMBio">{{cite web |last1=Sendra |first1=Tim |title=Part Time |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/part-time-mn0002712688/biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hakimiam |first1=Rob |title=LA weirdo pop artist Part Time releases the smooth rock 'It's Alright With Me' |url=https://www.thefourohfive.com/music/article/la-weirdo-pop-artist-part-time-releases-the-smooth-rock-it-s-alright-with-me-153 |website=[[The 405 (website)|The 405]] |date=October 8, 2018}}</ref> Loca produced and wrote virtually all of the band's output, with most of it recorded by himself at his home. [[AllMusic]] critic Tim Sendra described the music as "equal parts [[psychedelic pop]], [[soft rock]], and primitive [[synth pop]]."<ref name="AMBio" />

==History==
Part Time was named so because it began as a solo sideproject of Loca's, who had been performing with groups from Texas and Oklahoma.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeVille |first1=Chris |title=Part Time – "My Jamey" (Stereogum Premiere) |url=https://www.stereogum.com/1696048/part-time-my-jamey-stereogum-premiere/mp3s/ |website=Stereogum |date=August 5, 2015}}</ref> Loca produced and wrote all the output, with the exception of some material enlisting bandmates and friends.<ref name="wolf"/> He is originally from [[Florida]], later moving to [[El Paso, Texas]], and started his first band at the age 17. The first Part Time recordings were made in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and were first issued on a label in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|date=2014|title=H.F.M.|url=https://plasticresponserecords.bandcamp.com/album/h-f-m|website=[[Bandcamp]]|publisher=Plastic Response Records}}</ref> Albums until ''Spell #6'' (2018) were recorded almost entirely by himself at his home.<ref name="AMBio" />

On July 21, 2020, [[Mexican Summer]] removed Part Time merchandise from their website and submitted takedown requests for the albums ''What Would You Say?'' and ''PDA'' on streaming services following the appearance of domestic abuse and sexual misconduct allegations against Loca and other artists affiliated with [[Burger Records]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sacher |first1=Andrew |title=Burger Records shuts down for good |url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/burger-records-shuts-down-for-good/ |website=Brooklyn Vegan |date=July 22, 2020}}</ref> On July 28, Loca issued a statement that said, in part, that he would "personally see to it that all of my music including myself be removed from all websites, online platforms and any and all music communities/scenes at this time."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Minsker |first1=Evan |title=Mexican Summer Pulls Part Time’s Albums Citing Abuse Allegations, David Loca Issues Apology no |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/mexican-summer-pulls-part-times-albums-citing-abuse-allegations-david-loca-issues-apology/ |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=July 27, 2020}}</ref>
