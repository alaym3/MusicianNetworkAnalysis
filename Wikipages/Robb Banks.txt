The project became a hit on the microblogging platform [[Tumblr]].<ref name="Tracy" /> He collaborated with producers like Nuri and SpaceGhostPurrp and began touring the country, developing an underground following.

===2013: ''Tha City''===
After a brief hiatus, Robb began working on another project titled ''Tha City''. He promoted the mixtape by releasing singles off the project including "Practice", "All the Way Live", and "On Me". ''Tha City'' was released on October 1, 2013.<ref name="Bein">{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/coldplay-at-hard-rock-stadium-august-28-9580512|title=Robb Bank$ Drops New Mixtape, T/H/A City: "People Aren't Going to Get It"|website=[[Miami New Times]]|first=Kat|last=Bein|date=October 1, 2013|access-date=September 4, 2017}}</ref> Prior to the release of this tape rumors had surfaced as to whether or not Shaggy was Robb's father, a fact that was formerly denied, but was soon confirmed by him to be true by making the cover for ''Tha City'' an old family photo of Banks and Shaggy. After the release of this mixtape, Robb went on a year-long hiatus as he continued touring and spreading his music around the world.

===2014‚Äì15: ''2PhoneShawty'', ''No Trespassing'' and ''Year of the Savage''===
{{main|Year of the Savage}}
Throughout 2014, Robb began touring around the world and rarely released new music, only to show that he is still working on [[Year of the Savage]]. This was until the end of the year, when he began hinting new projects that have been in the work. 
In December, Banks put out the first (promotional) single for his debut commercial release, called "2PhoneShawty". It ended up being the only song recorded in 2013 on the entire album.

In 2015, he started working on a new batch of music for YOTS, which would mainly feature production from his new affiliate Nuez.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://massappeal.com/robb-banks-talks-year-of-the-savage-and-signing-to-300.html |title=Robb Bank$ Talks Year of the Savage and Signing to 300 |publisher=massappeal.com |access-date=October 11, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
In April, Robb released two extended-plays: 2PhoneShawty and No Trespassing. The 2PhoneShawty EP consisted of outtakes from Year of the Savage, and No Trespassing was a collaboration between him and Memphis-born rapper [[Chris Travis]], all recorded in 2014.

On August 13, 2015, Banks released the lead single for his album, titled "Pressure". After that he continued to promote YOTS by releasing a bunch of freestyled tracks. It was during one of these freestyles ("Throw It Up") that he confirmed the release date for his long-awaited album.

On October 2, 2015, Robb Banks released ''Year of the Savage'' through [[300 Entertainment]]'s Dorian Distribution.<ref name="Noisey" />

== Influences ==
Banks' style is notorious for its heavy [[sampling (music)|sampling]] of old school [[R&B]], pop culture and Japanese [[anime]].<ref name="Tracy" /> Robb states his inspiration to rap comes from [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]] and that one of his favorite artists of all time is British [[quiet storm]]-style singer [[Sade (singer)|Sade]].<ref name="Tracy" /><ref name="Noisey" /> Robb has also mentioned [[Lil' Wayne]], [[Webbie]], [[SpaceGhostPurrp]], his father and [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]] as an influence to his sound. His tag "I Think I Might Be Happy" is synonymous with his music and is taken from a scene of the U.S. version of ''[[Skins (North American TV series)|Skins]]''. Banks frequently makes references to [[Japanese anime]] ''[[Naruto]]'' and calls it his favorite anime of all time. Banks also refers to himself as "[[Griffith (Berserk)|Femto]]" from the Japanese manga, [[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]].
