== Musical style ==
The band is known for their fast, punk-influenced two-piece bass and drum songs. At some point Wyatt says he switched from bass to guitar but most people didn't notice because of his style of playing and use of low notes. Their later music often contains synth in addition to or instead of the guitar and drums. Both their music and image being characterized by "DIY principles, thrift store-cum-glam fashion style and a vast list of influences."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vigil |first1=Dom |title=The Garden Share New Track, "Thy Mission" Featuring Mac DeMarco |url=https://thepreludepress.com/news/2019/4/10/the-garden-share-new-track-thy-mission-featuring-mac-demarco |website=The Prelude Press |date=April 10, 2019}}</ref> The brothers classify their sound as "vada vada," a philosophy which Wyatt Shears describes as "an idea that represents pure creative expression, that disregards all previously made genres and ideals".<ref>{{cite web |title=West Coast band 'The Garden' release the deliciously barbed 'HAHA' |url=https://www.fluxmagazine.com/band-the-garden/ |website=Flux Magazine}}</ref> The twins have described their influences from such diverse artists as: video game composer [[Manabu Namiki]], rappers [[E-40]] and [[Mykki Blanco]], country singer [[Johnny Paycheck]] and punk rock bands [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]] and [[Big Boys]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vincent |first1=Alice |title=The Garden - New Music |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/new-music/11280683/The-Garden-band.html |website=The Telegraph |date=December 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Porter |first1=Billie JD |title=So You Think You're Really Pretty? |url=https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2014/09/25/think-youre-really-pretty/ |website=Wonderland Magazine |date=September 25, 2014}}</ref>
