'''Vintersorg''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈvɪ̂nːtɛˌʂɔrj}}; "Winter Sorrow" in English) is a Swedish band from [[Skellefteå]], formed in 1994 under the name '''Vargatron''' ('''Wolfthrone''' in English).  Musically, Vintersorg has covered a wide number of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genres; while the band is mostly rooted in [[extreme metal]] styles, particularly [[black metal]] and [[Viking metal|Viking]]/[[folk metal]], it has also expanded into [[progressive metal]] and [[avant-garde metal]].  Lyrically, the band deals with topics on [[fantasy]], [[mythology]], [[nature]], the [[cosmos]], and [[metaphysics]].  Vintersorg means "[[Seasonal affective disorder|Winter Sorrow]]," but the name was taken from ''[[The Legend of the Ice People]]'' series by [[Margit Sandemo]], where the character Vintersorg is the son of a great pagan leader.

==History==
The project was originally formed in 1994 to "push the limits" of black metal music, where the vocals are mostly clean sung, and only a few parts per song that had the traditional [[death grunt|screaming vocals]].  The sound of Vintersorg has vastly changed over the years, as their earlier sound had more of a folk influence, and later on, more of an experimental sound. This transformation was most notably marked with the release of the ''[[Cosmic Genesis]]'' album, and the change in sound progressed from album to album, with the 2004 album ''The Focusing Blur'' being an extremely avant-garde album. The band's vocal elements have changed from album to album as well, starting out with low-pitched, powerful [[baritone]] singing, and gradually shifting towards softer, higher-pitched delivery with more use of harmony and layering with black metal vocals. ''Solens rötter'', marked a return to the earlier folk metal style, while retaining the more complex and non-traditional guitar arrangements and song structures of later albums. On ''[[Jordpuls]]'' and ''[[Orkan (album)|Orkan]]'' there was a continuation with the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] sung material and nature oriented themes. ''Till fjälls: Part II'', a double album was released in June 2017.<ref>[http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vintersorg-to-release-till-fjalls-del-ii-in-june/ VINTERSORG To Release 'Till Fjälls Del II' In June] Blabbermouth.net. 7 April 2017</ref>

Along with this change in musical style, the lyrical topics began to shift as well. On earlier albums, the lyrics are all written and performed in Swedish, and dealt with topics of nature and [[paganism]]. With the advent of ''Cosmic Genesis'', the lyrics were now written and sung mostly in English, and now dealt with scientific ideas such as [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], philosophies such as metaphysics, and other ideas such as [[astrology]]. In the ''Cosmic Genesis'' booklet, Vintersorg extends thanks to [[Carl Sagan|Dr. Carl Sagan]], author of the book [[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]].  Since, then, the band has alternated between both English and Swedish lyrics, sometimes using both on the same album.  In keeping with the band's return to its folk roots, the latter albums are also sung entirely in Swedish and deal with more traditional themes.

[[Andreas Hedlund]] (a.k.a. Vintersorg) is constantly creating music. He is the front-man of several bands including [[Otyg]], [[Borknagar]], Havayoth, [[Fission (band)|Fission]], [[Cronian]] and [[Waterclime]].
