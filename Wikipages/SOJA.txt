== History ==

===1997–05: Founding, early releases===
Before the band was founded, the members had performed together on and off for some years. Frontman Jacob Hemphill (vocals, guitar) and Bob Jefferson (bass) met in first grade shortly after Hemphill had returned with his family from living in [[Africa]], where Jacob's father was the [[IMF]] resident representative in [[Monrovia, Liberia]].<ref name="Jackson"/><ref name="aboutband"/> Hemphill and Jefferson then met Ryan Berty (drums), Eric Rogers (keyboards), and Ken Brownell (percussion) in middle school and high school.<ref name="Jackson" />

;''Creeping In'' (1998)

After forming SOJA in 1997, Jacob Hemphill, Eric Rogers, Bob Jefferson, Ryan "Byrd" Berty and Kenneth Brownell recorded their first album ''Creeping In'' in 1998.

;''SOJA EP'' (2000)

They released their first EP, self-titled ''[[SOJA (EP)|SOJA]]'',<ref name="allmusicsoja" /><ref name="sojaepdiscogs" /> independently with [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]] Jim Fox at LION and FOX Recording Studios in [[2000 in music|2000]].<ref name="reggaereviewsoja" /> It was positively received.<ref name="reggaereviewsoja" /> 
[[File:Eric SOJA with Bob.jpg|thumb|SOJA performing circa 2000. Bobby Lee Jefferson (left) and Eric Rogers (right).]]

;''Peace in Time of War'' (2002)

The band also released their first full-length album, ''Peace in a Time of War'' in 2002.

Eric Rogers was the talented heartbeat for the keyboard rhythms on ''Creeping In'', EP self-titled ''SOJA'', and ''Peace in a Time of War''. However, fans never really knew or saw the artist behind those keys. SOJA replaced Eric Rogers with Patrick O'Shea in 2002. Eric's distinct guitar riffs can be heard on "Time Come Due". It is a beautiful opus to his innate musical talent. The richness of his soul is felt through every pulse of the keyboard. His harmonious and distinguished vocal contributions can distinctly be heard on "Jah Atmosphere", "True Love", and "Brothers and Sisters". 

SOJA released a [[Dub music|Dub]] version of their ''Peace in a Time of War'' album titled, ''Dub in a Time of War'' in 2005.<ref name="almusicsoldiersofjah2">{{Cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/386708|title=Soldiers Of Jah Army|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>
