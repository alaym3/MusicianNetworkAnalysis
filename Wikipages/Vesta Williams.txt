==Biography==
Born in [[Coshocton, Ohio]], United States,<ref name="ABC-Obit"/><ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5836/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Ron Wynn |website=Allmusic.com |access-date=September 23, 2011}}</ref> Williams' father was a [[disc jockey]]. Her family moved from [[Ohio]] to Los Angeles in the 1960s. While there, Williams and her three sisters, Margaret, Marte and Marlena, appeared on the television show ''Jack and Jill'' as "The Williams Sisters".<ref name="music">{{cite web|last=Wynn |first=Ron |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vesta-williams-p5836 |title=Vesta Williams |website=AllMusic |access-date=2012-03-29}}</ref> Later, she returned to Ohio but decided to go back to Los Angeles in order to launch a solo career.<ref name="AMG"/> Former [[The 5th Dimension|Fifth Dimension]] member [[Ronald Townson|Ron Townson]] put Williams in his band [[Wild Honey (band)|Wild Honey]].<ref name="music"/> Following that stint, Williams found work as a [[session musician|backup singer]], working with artists such as [[Chaka Khan]], [[Gladys Knight]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Stephanie Mills]], [[Anita Baker]] and [[Gordon Lightfoot]]. Williams sang on the original version of [[Joe Sample]]'s "The Survivor",<ref name="music"/> and met producer David Crawford while working with his group [[Klique]]. After doing session work, she landed a [[recording contract]] with [[A&M Records]] and her debut album, ''Vesta'', was released in 1986.<ref name="music"/> The album featured her first [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] hit "Once Bitten, Twice Shy", which became her only UK hit and performed modestly on the US R&B charts.<ref name="AMG"/>

Her 1988 release, ''Vesta 4 U'', produced the Top 10 R&B hits "Sweet Sweet Love", "4 U", and "[[Congratulations (Vesta song)|Congratulations]]", with the latter peaking at #55 on the Hot 100 chart and #5 on the R&B chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=603}}</ref> "Congratulations" was Vesta's only single to enter the Hot 100 chart. The album was also her most successful,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} and her only album to appear on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at No. 131. There were persistent rumors that the song was inspired by the dissolution of her long-time relationship with [[Bruce Willis]] and that [[Demi Moore]] was directly responsible for ending it. In 1991, Williams released her third album entitled ''Special'', with the title track as a single. "Special" became her highest-charting song on the R&B chart at #2, but sales of the album were less than that of ''Vesta 4 U''. Her next album, 1993's ''Everything-N-More'', produced only a minor R&B hit, "Always".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wavenewspapers.com/newsinblack/VESTA-WILLIAMS-REPORTEDLY-FOUND-DEAD-130416578.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116075537/http://www.wavenewspapers.com/newsinblack/VESTA-WILLIAMS-REPORTEDLY-FOUND-DEAD-130416578.html |archive-date=2011-11-16 |title=VESTA WILLIAMS DIES, IN WHAT 'COULD BE A DRUG OVERDOSE'}}</ref>

In 1989, [[Polygram Records]] purchased A&M Records. Williams' 1998 album ''Relationships'' was released under the Polygram name, and it became a modest seller, appearing on the R&B charts. Following the release of ''Relationships'', A&M/Polygram did not renew her contract. Williams continued to work as a session singer, landing spots on albums by such artists as [[Phil Perry]], [[Howard Hewett]], and [[George Duke]]. Her voice could be heard by radio listeners in jingles for advertisers that included [[McDonald's]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Baskin-Robbins]], [[Diet Coke]], [[Revlon]] and [[Exxon]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Nsenga |url=http://www.theroot.com/buzz/rb-singer-vesta-williams-found-dead |title=R&B Singer Vesta Williams Found Dead |publisher=Theroot.com |date=2011-09-23 |access-date=2012-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329104116/http://www.theroot.com/buzz/rb-singer-vesta-williams-found-dead |archive-date=2012-03-29 }}</ref> That same year, she performed the opening theme to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[miniseries]], ''[[The Women of Brewster Place (TV miniseries)|The Women of Brewster Place]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zocial.tv/today/Film/27352256/the-women-of-brewster-place-theme-song-vesta-williams|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130418230730/http://www.zocial.tv/today/Film/27352256/the-women-of-brewster-place-theme-song-vesta-williams|url-status=dead|title=The Women of Brewster Place Theme Song- Vesta Williams - ZOCIAL.tv|archive-date=2013-04-18}}</ref>
