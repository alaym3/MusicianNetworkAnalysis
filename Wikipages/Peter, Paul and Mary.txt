'''Peter, Paul and Mary''' were an American [[Contemporary folk music|folk]] group formed in New York City in 1961, during the [[American folk music revival]] phenomenon. The trio was composed of [[tenor]] [[Peter Yarrow]], [[baritone]] [[Paul Stookey|Noel Paul Stookey]] and [[contralto]]<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/20/arts/pop-peter-paul-and-mary.html | title=Pop: Peter, Paul and Mary | first=Stephen | last=Holden | author-link=Stephen Holden | date=March 20, 1986 | work=The New York Times | access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref> [[Mary Travers]].  The group's repertoire included songs written by Yarrow and Stookey, early songs by [[Bob Dylan]], as well as covers of other folk musicians. They were enormously successful in the early and mid 1960s, with their debut album topping the charts for weeks, and helped popularize the folk music revival. After the death of Travers in 2009, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform as a duo under their individual names.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/peter-paul-mary-peter-yarrow-noel-paul-stookey/|title=Peter, Paul & Mary's Peter Yarrow & Noel Paul Stookey - Interviews - Tavis Smiley - PBS|work=Tavis Smiley - PBS}}</ref>

Mary Travers said she was influenced by [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[the Weavers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peterpaulandmary.com/history/f-ruhlmann1.htm |title=Beginnings |author=William Ruhlmann |date=April 12, 1996 |work=Peter, Paul and Mary A song to sing all over this land |publisher=Goldmine |access-date=2009-12-13}}</ref> In the documentary ''Peter, Paul & Mary: Carry It On — A Musical Legacy'', members of the Weavers discuss how Peter, Paul and Mary took over the torch of the social commentary of folk music in the 1960s.

The group was inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 1999. Peter, Paul and Mary received the [[Sammy Cahn]] Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2006.

==History==
===Early years (1961–1969)===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Entertainment, Vocalists Peter, Paul, and Mary.) - NARA - 542019.tif|250px|thumb|left|The trio performing at the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.]]]]
Manager [[Albert Grossman]] created Peter, Paul and Mary in 1961, after auditioning several singers in the New York folk scene, including [[Dave Van Ronk]], who was rejected as too idiosyncratic and uncommercial, and [[Carolyn Hester]]. After rehearsing Yarrow, Stookey and Travers out of town in Boston and Miami, Grossman booked them into [[The Bitter End]], a coffee house, nightclub and popular [[folk music]] venue in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]].

The group recorded their debut album, ''[[Peter, Paul and Mary (album)|Peter, Paul and Mary]]'', and it was released by Warner Bros. the following year. It included "[[Lemon Tree (Will Holt song)|Lemon Tree]]", "[[500 Miles]]", and the [[Pete Seeger]] hit tunes "[[If I Had a Hammer]]" (subtitled "The Hammer Song") and "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone|Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" The album was listed in the ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' Top Ten for 10 months, including seven weeks in the No. 1 position. It remained a main catalog-seller for decades to come, eventually selling over two million copies, earning [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States alone.

In 1963 the group released "[[Puff, the Magic Dragon]]", with music by Yarrow and words based on a poem that had been written by a fellow student at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Leonard Lipton]]. Despite rumors that the song refers to drugs, it is actually about the lost innocence of childhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSSYD1071420080306|title=Just A Minute With: Peter Yarrow|work=Reuters}}</ref> That same year, they appeared as the "mystery guest" on the [[CBS]] TV game show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] correctly guessed their identity.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's My Line? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw90sezjgCI&ab_channel=What%27sMyLine%3F | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211110/aw90sezjgCI| archive-date=2021-11-10 | url-status=live|website=[[CBS]] |access-date=28 December 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

That year the group performed "[[If I Had a Hammer]]" and "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" at the August 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], best remembered for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech. The [[Bob Dylan]] song "Blowin' in the Wind" was one of their biggest hit singles.<ref name=pc19>{{Pop Chronicles |19| 3| Peter Yarrow}}</ref> They also sang other Dylan songs, such as "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]", "[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]",<ref name=pc19/> and "[[When the Ship Comes In]]". Their success with Dylan's "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" helped Dylan's ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' album rise into the top 30; it had been released four months earlier.<ref>{{Citation | newspaper = [[The Times]] | type = obituary | title = Mary Travers | date = September 18, 2009}}</ref>

In December 1969 "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]", written by the group's friend [[John Denver]], became their only No. 1 single (as well as their final top 40 pop hit) and the group's sixth million-selling gold single. The track first appeared on their million-selling platinum certified ''[[Album 1700]]'' in 1967 (which also contained their No. 9 hit "[[I Dig Rock and Roll Music]]"). After [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s strong showing in the 1968 [[New Hampshire]] presidential primary, the group recorded "Eugene McCarthy For President (If You Love Your Country)" endorsing McCarthy, which was released without a record label.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7pR0yTGOiA| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211110/N7pR0yTGOiA| archive-date=2021-11-10 | url-status=live|title=1968 45-RPM Eugene McCarthy Campaign Recording: Peter, Paul, & Mary|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>  "[[Day Is Done (Peter, Paul and Mary song)|Day Is Done]]", a No. 21 hit in June 1969 from the trio's Grammy Award-winning album ''[[Peter, Paul and Mommy]]'', was the last Hot 100 hit the trio recorded.

===Breakup (1970–1978)===
The trio broke up in 1970 to pursue solo careers. Also that year, Yarrow was convicted of making sexual advances toward a 14-year-old girl. Years later, he received a [[presidential pardon]] from [[Jimmy Carter]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Kiernan |first=Laura A. |date=7 February 1981 |title=Folk Singer Peter Yarrow Pardoned by Carter |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/02/07/folk-singer-peter-yarrow-pardoned-by-carter/0216a782-817c-4091-a0c9-e4e82624ed95/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=15 September 1970 |title=Peter Yarrow, Folk Singer, Gets 3‐Month Jail Sentence |work=The New York Times |page=53 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/15/archives/peter-yarrow-folk-singer-gets-3month-jail-sentence.html}} {{small |([[Associated Press]], 14 September 1970)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hasson |first=Judi |date=6 February 1981 |title=Yarrow pardoned for morals offense |work=United Press International |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/02/06/Yarrow-pardoned-for-morals-offense/2858350283600/}}</ref>

During 1971 and 1972 Warner released a debut solo album, with the same style cover, by each member of the group. Travers did concerts and lectures across the United States. She also produced, wrote, and starred in a BBC-TV series. Stookey formed a Christian music group, the Body Works Band, and wrote "[[The Wedding Song (There Is Love)]]" for Yarrow's marriage to Marybeth McCarthy, the niece of [[Eugene McCarthy]]. Britain's [[Petula Clark]] also recorded a version of the song, which in 1973 charted strongly in the UK, Australia and others. Yarrow co-wrote and produced Mary MacGregor's ''[[Torn Between Two Lovers]]'' (No. 1, 1977) and earned an Emmy for three animated TV specials based on "Puff the Magic Dragon".<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame Foundation|url=http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/peter_paul_mary.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311032921/http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/peter_paul_mary.html|archive-date=2007-03-11}}</ref> 

While the group was de facto broken up and touring separately, it still managed to come together for a series of reunions before officially coming back together again. In 1972, the trio reunited for [[Together for McGovern]], a concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] to support [[George McGovern]]'s presidential campaign, and again in 1978 for a concert to protest [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. This concert was followed by a 1978 summer reunion tour. Included was a September 3 evening performance at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]].

A reunion album, ''Reunion'', was released by Warner in 1978. In ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] said the group's decision to cover [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)|Forever Young]]" as a "rinky-dink reggae like these three geezers means you've been middle-aged and liberal since you were fifteen."<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: P|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=P&bk=70|access-date=March 10, 2019|website=Robertchristgau.com}}</ref>

===Reconciliation (1981–2009)===
[[File:Peter, Paul and Mary 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Peter, Paul and Mary in 2006]]
The 1978 summer tour was so popular that the group decided to reunite more or less permanently in 1981. They continued to record albums and tour, playing around 45 shows a year, until Travers's 2009 death.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterpaulandmary.com/tour/f-tour.htm|title=Tour Schedule|website=Peterpaulandmary.com}}</ref> The trio was accompanied in concert by double-bassist Dick Kniss (who had been their bassist on their studio recordings and 1960s tours) and, starting in 1990, by multi-instrumentalist Paul Prestopino.

The trio received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award on September 1, 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214172308/http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html|url-status=dead|title=The Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Recipients List|archive-date=February 14, 2009}}</ref>

In 2004, Travers was diagnosed with [[leukemia]], leading to the cancellation of that year's remaining tour dates. She received a [[bone marrow transplant]]. She and the rest of the trio resumed their tour on December 9, 2005, with a holiday performance at [[Carnegie Hall]].

The trio canceled several dates of their summer 2007 tour, as Travers had to undergo a second surgery.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> She was unable to perform on the trio's tour in mid-2009 because of the effects of leukemia, but Yarrow and Stookey performed the scheduled dates as a duo, calling the show "Peter & Paul Celebrate Mary and 5 Decades of Friendship".

On September 16, 2009, Travers died at age 72, of complications from [[chemotherapy]], following treatment for leukemia.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/mary-travers-of-peter-paul-and-mary-dies/ | title=Mary Travers of Peter, Paul and Mary Dies | date=September 16, 2009 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref> It was the same year Peter, Paul and Mary were inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.
