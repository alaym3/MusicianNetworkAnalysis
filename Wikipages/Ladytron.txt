The band wore uniforms inspired by the science fiction movie ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|The Andromeda Strain]]'' until the end of 2003. Daniel Hunt said in an interview for Jound from 2001: "I'm really into ''The Andromeda Strain'', so that's kind of an influence on the title of the album and the uniforms we've got and stuff. But the design – me and Reuben just love that film".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ladytron |url=http://www.jound.com/will/interviews/ladytron.html |date=26 July 2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010726134411/http://www.jound.com/will/interviews/ladytron.html |archive-date=26 July 2001}}</ref> Also in an interview for Chaos Control magazine from 2002 Hunt explained the ''[[604 (album)|604]]'' album title: "It's the [[area code]] for [[British Columbia]]... we're glad we've attached this strange importance to that number, it crops up everywhere now. We noticed when we stayed in Hamburg in Germany (in a hotel called "Commodore" – pure coincidence), that the number to phone reception from your room was '604'. Moments afterwards the building had caught fire and we were lucky to escape with our lives. I'm not joking".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ladytron – Chaos Control Digizine |url=http://www.chaoscontrol.com/ladytron-2/ |date=9 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409215406/http://www.chaoscontrol.com/ladytron-2/ |archive-date=9 April 2012}}</ref>

Reuben Wu said about the process of making a new Ladytron album: "We start writing individually. We've never really lived in the same city before. We've always been geographically apart. [...] It's always been first as individuals, and then reviewing everything together, and then working on each other's songs. That's how we've always worked. And it goes well with how we make music. We do get together down the line and in the studio when we start fleshing out the tracks".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Interview: Ladytron's Reuben Wu – Shanghai – Shanghai Blogs Blog – City Weekend Guide |url=http://www.cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/articles/blogs-shanghai/shanghais-nightlife/interview-ladytrons-reuben-wu/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030190416/http://www.cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/articles/blogs-shanghai/shanghais-nightlife/interview-ladytrons-reuben-wu/ |archive-date=30 October 2013 |access-date=31 March 2013}}</ref>

During the early part of the ''Witching Hour'' tour, the band used to name their four [[Korg MS-2000]]B synths to easily differentiate them: ''Cleopatra'' (Marnie), ''Babylon'' (Aroyo), ''Ulysses'' (Hunt), and ''Gloria'' (Wu).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Korg – Artist Details |url=http://www.korg.com/Artist.aspx?artist=259 |date=2 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102035202/http://www.korg.com/Artist.aspx?artist=259 |archive-date=2 January 2010}}</ref> A staple of all Ladytron shows is [[Korg MS-20]] played by Mira Aroyo.
