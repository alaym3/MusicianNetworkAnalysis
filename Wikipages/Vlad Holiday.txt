==Early life==
Holiday was born in Bucharest, Romania on May 24, 1989. Holiday's father was a journalist who spoke out against the regime change in Romania once the country escaped communism in 1989, citing that the new regime was just as corrupt. This resulted in their family receiving death threats, which led to Holiday's father escaping to America with political asylum. It took the rest of the family 9 years to legally move to the US, and in September 1999, Holiday (age 10) moved to [[Bergen County, New Jersey]].<ref name="razorandtiemusicpublishing.com">{{cite web|url=http://razorandtiemusicpublishing.com/band/born-cages/|title=Born Cages – Razor & Tie Music Publishing|website=razorandtiemusicpublishing.com|accessdate=December 3, 2017}}</ref> He grew up in [[Mahwah, New Jersey]], where he attended [[Mahwah High School]].<ref>Mazzola, Jessica.

Accessed April 30, 2017. "Born Cages – which features township residents and recent Mahwah High School grads Vlad Holiday on guitar and lead vocals and Amanda Carl on keyboards and vocals – has a song on the new Now 45 CD."</ref> Holiday was the lead singer and founder of the New York City-based indie rock band [[Born Cages]], and the lead guitarist in his highschool band [[Jet Lag Gemini]].

==Career==

===Solo career (2017–present)===
With a downtown NYC lo-fi sound, writing and recording at his studio in the heart of historic Greenwich Village, Holiday started putting out songs as they are being written, not worrying about the pressures of albums or EP's or any other music industry constructs. On July 28, 2017, Vlad Holiday announced his solo project through [[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]. NYLON premiered his debut track, "Quit Playing Cool".<ref name="nylon.com"/> The song was also featured on [[Spotify]]'s "New Indie Mix" playlist, "Fresh Finds: Six Strings" playlist, as well as featured on All Genres Hot Tracks on iTunes and Apple Music.<ref name="spotify.com"/><ref name="auto"/> Quit Playing Cool's music video was released on VEVO's New Alternative playlist on September 1. The video features model/actress Yulia Kirillova and is directed by Polly Pierce.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnjXeOCnhcc|title=Vlad Holiday – Quit Playing Cool|last=VladHolidayVEVO|date=September 1, 2017|accessdate=December 3, 2017|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

On March 9, 2018, Holiday put out his second single "Children". The song was featured on Spotify's New Indie Mix playlist, as well as The Wild Honey Pie's "Buzzing Daily" and a [[Paste Magazine]] & [[Daytrotter]] Live Session.<ref>http://www.thewildhoneypie.com/buzzing-daily/vlad-holiday-children</ref><ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BgJoYWljv9U/</ref>

On April 6, 2018, "Tunnel Vision" premiered on The 405, where he spoke about the song's lyrics, which question the idea of extreme escapism. “Don't get me wrong, I love escaping from it all every now and then as much as anyone else, but at the end of the day you kinda have to snap back and face the world. There's a whirlpool of social movements happening right now that are actually changing the status quo, which would never have happened if everyone just sat back and waited for everything to resolve itself,” Holiday explains. Holiday held a single release show at Elsewhere Zone One in Brooklyn, NY on April 3, 2018. This third single was also featured on Spotify's New Indie Mix, and True Indie playlists (where Holiday held the cover).<ref>https://www.thefourohfive.com/music/article/escapism-meets-its-match-on-vlad-holiday-s-new-single-tunnel-vision-405-premiere-152</ref> Tunnel Vision was played on NYC's Q104.3 [[WAXQ]] Out of the Box radio show with Jonathan Clarke, as well as other college radio stations like [[WSOU]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://q1043.iheart.com/featured/jonathan-jc-clarke/content/2018-04-08-listen-david-byrne-in-studio-win-snow-patrol-tix-more/|title=LISTEN: David Byrne in Studio, Win Snow Patrol Tix & More! &#124; Q104.3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://campusbuzzwsou.blogspot.com/2018/03/03182018-playlist.html|title = The Campus Buzz on WSOU: 03.18.2018 Playlist|date = March 18, 2018}}</ref>
