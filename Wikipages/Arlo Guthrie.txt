Guthrie's best-known work is his debut piece, "[[Alice's Restaurant Massacree]]", a satirical [[talking blues]] song about 18 minutes in length that has since become a Thanksgiving anthem. His only top-40 hit was a cover of [[Steve Goodman]]'s "[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> His song "[[Massachusetts (Arlo Guthrie song)|Massachusetts]]" was named the official [[folk song]] of the state, in which he has lived most of his adult life. Guthrie has also made several acting appearances. He is the father of four children, who have also had careers as musicians.

==Early life==
Guthrie was born in the [[Coney Island]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], the son of the [[folk singer]] and composer [[Woody Guthrie]] and dancer [[Marjorie Guthrie|Marjorie Mazia Guthrie]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He is the fifth, and oldest surviving, of Woody Guthrie's eight children; two older half-sisters died of [[Huntington's disease]] (which also killed Woody in 1967), an older half-brother died in a train accident and a third sister died in childhood. His sister is the record producer [[Nora Guthrie]]. His mother was a professional dancer with the [[Martha Graham|Martha Graham Company]] and founder of what is now the Huntington's Disease Society of America. Arlo's father was from a Protestant family and his mother was Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nora |last=Guthie |url=http://www.voicesofoklahoma.com/woody_guthrie.html |title=Woody Guthrie |work=Voices of Oklahoma |access-date=May 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602161447/http://voicesofoklahoma.com/woody_guthrie.html |archive-date=June 2, 2012 }}</ref> His maternal grandmother was Yiddish poet [[Aliza Greenblatt]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Susanne A. |last=Shavelson |url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/greenblat-aliza |title=Aliza Greenblatt: 1885–1975 |work=Jewish Women's Archive |access-date=January 1, 2012}}</ref>

Guthrie received religious training for his [[bar mitzvah]] from [[Rabbi]] [[Meir Kahane]], who formed the [[Jewish Defense League]]. "Rabbi Kahane was a really nice, patient teacher," Guthrie later recalled, "but shortly after he started giving me my lessons, he started going haywire.

Guthrie attended Woodward School in [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]], from first through eighth grades and later graduated from the [[Stockbridge School]], in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]], Massachusetts, in 1965. He spent the summer of 1965 in London, eventually meeting [[Karl Dallas]], who connected Guthrie with London's folk rock scene and became a lifelong friend of his.<ref name="MSobit">{{cite web|url=https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-152b-Karl-Dallas|title=Karl Dallas|date=June 30, 2016|work=[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]|access-date=September 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630192044/http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-152b-Karl-Dallas|archive-date=June 30, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> He briefly attended [[Rocky Mountain College]], in [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], Montana. He received an honorary doctorate from [[Siena College]] in 1981 and from [[Westfield State College]] in 2008.

As a singer, songwriter and lifelong political activist, Guthrie carries on the legacy of his father.

=="Alice's Restaurant"==
[[File:ArloGuthrieMinnesotaZooAmphitheatre2005.jpg|thumb|Guthrie performing during his 2005 ''Alice's Restaurant Massacree 40th Anniversary'' tour]]
On November 26, 1965, while in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]], Massachusetts, during [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] break from his brief stint in college, 18-year-old Guthrie and his friend, Richard Robbins, were arrested for [[littering|illegally dumping]] on private property what Guthrie described as "a half-ton of [[garbage]]" from the home of his friends, teachers Ray and [[Alice Brock]], after he discovered the local [[landfill]] was closed for the holiday. Guthrie and Robbins appeared in court, pled guilty to the charges, were levied a nominal fine and picked up the garbage that weekend.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3747386/alices_restaurant_massacree/ | title = Youths Ordered to Clean Up Rubbish Mess | newspaper = Berkshire Eagle | date = November 29, 1965 | location = Pittsfield, Massachusetts | page = 25 | via = Newspapers.com | quote = Richard J.

This littering charge served as the basis for Guthrie's most famous work, "[[Alice's Restaurant Massacree]]", a [[talking blues]] song that lasts 18 minutes and 34 seconds in its original recorded version. In 1997, Guthrie pointed out that this was also the exact length of one of the infamous gaps in [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Nixon White House tapes|Watergate tapes]], and that Nixon owned a copy of the record. The Alice in the song is [[Alice Brock]], who had been a librarian at Arlo's boarding school in the town before opening her restaurant. She later opened an art studio in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alice |last=Brock |url=http://www.alicebrock.com/All%20About%20Alice.htm |title=All About Alice |work=AliceBrock.com |publisher=Alice Brock |access-date=January 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229200730/http://www.alicebrock.com/All%20About%20Alice.htm |archive-date=December 29, 2011 }}</ref>

The song lampoons the [[Vietnam War]] [[conscription|draft]]. However, Guthrie has stated in multiple interviews that the song is more an "anti-stupidity" song than an anti-war song, adding that it is based on a true incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ronbenningtoninterviews.com/2009/08/08/arlo-guthrie/|title=Ron Bennington Interviews Arlo Guthrie|website=Ronbenningtoninterviews.com|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref> In the song, Guthrie is called up for a draft examination and rejected as unfit for [[military service]] as a result of a criminal record consisting solely of one conviction for the aforementioned [[littering]]. Alice and her restaurant are the subjects of the refrain, but are generally mentioned only incidentally in the story (early drafts of the song explained that the restaurant was a place to hide from the police). Though her presence is implied at certain points in the story, Alice herself is described explicitly in the tale only briefly when she bails Guthrie and a friend out of jail. On the DVD commentary for the 1969 movie, Guthrie stated that the events presented in the song all actually happened (others, such as the arresting officer, [[William Obanhein]], disputed some of the song's details,<ref>Saul Braun, "Alice & Ray & Yesterday's Flowers," in ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'s'' Music Scene, Chicago, IL, 1972, pp. 122–125.

For a short period after its release in October 1967, "Alice's Restaurant" was heavily played on U.S. college and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] radio stations. It became a symbol of the late 1960s, and for many it defined an attitude and lifestyle that were lived out across the country in the ensuing years. Its leisurely finger-picking acoustic guitar and rambling lyrics were widely memorized and played by irreverent youth. Many stations in the United States have a Thanksgiving Day tradition of playing "Alice's Restaurant".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uguakxft-JwC&q=%22alice's+restaurant%22&pg=PT190|title=The Joy of Family Traditions: A Season-by-Season Companion to Celebrations|author=Thompson, Jennifer Trainer|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780307788849}}</ref>

A 1969 film, directed and co-written by [[Arthur Penn]], was based on the true story told in the song,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> but with the addition of a large number of fictional scenes. This film, also called ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]'', featured Guthrie and several other figures in the song portraying themselves. The part of his father Woody Guthrie, who had died in 1967, was played by actor Joseph Boley; Alice, who made a [[cameo appearance]] as an extra, was also recast, with actress [[Pat Quinn (American actress)|Pat Quinn]] in the title role<ref>{{IMDb title|0064002|Alice's Restaurant}}</ref> (Alice Brock later disowned the film's portrayal of her).<ref name=bostonglobe2008>Brown, Jane Roy (February 24, 2008).

Despite its popularity, the song "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" is not always featured on the setlist of any given Guthrie performance. Since putting it back into his setlist in 1984, he has performed the song every ten years, stating in a 2014 interview that the Vietnam War had ended by the 1970s and that everyone who was attending his concerts had likely already heard the song anyway. So, after a brief period in the late 1960s and early 1970s when he replaced the monologue with a fictional one involving "multicolored rainbow roaches", he decided to do it only on special occasions from that point forward.<ref name=rollingstone>Doyle, Patrick (November 26, 2014).

==Musical career and critical reception==
[[Image:Arlo Guthrie 2007.jpg|thumb|Guthrie performing with the Guthrie Family Legacy Tour 2007]]
The "Alice's Restaurant" song was one of a few very long songs to become popular just when albums began replacing hit singles as young people's main music listening. But in 1972 Guthrie had a highly successful single too, [[Steve Goodman]]'s song "[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]",<ref name="LarkinGE"/> a wistful [[paean]] to long-distance passenger [[railway|rail]] travel. Guthrie's first trip on that train was in December 2005 (when his family joined other musicians on a train trip across the country to raise money for musicians financially devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]], in the South of the United States). He also had a minor hit with his song "Coming into Los Angeles", which was played at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]], but did not get much radio airplay because of its plot (involving the smuggling of drugs from London by airplane),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rutlandherald.com/features/vermont_arts/alice-s-restaurant-is-back/article_18adacde-d843-53d5-8ec2-2d6b83a489f0.html|title='Alice's Restaurant' is back|author=Art Edelstein|website=Rutlandherald.com|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref> and success with a live version of "[[The Motorcycle Song]]" (one of the songs on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the ''Alice's Restaurant'' album). A cover of the folk song "[[Gypsy Davy]]" was a hit on the [[easy listening]] charts.

In the fall of 1975 during a benefit concert in Massachusetts, Guthrie performed with his band, Shenandoah, in public for the first time. They continued to tour and record throughout the 1970s until the early 1990s.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Although the band received good reviews, it never gained the popularity that Guthrie did while playing solo. Shenandoah consisted of (after 1976) David Grover, Steve Ide, Carol Ide, Terry A La Berry and Dan Velika<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kasten |first=Roy |url=http://archives.nodepression.com/2001/01/arlo-guthrie-outlasting-the-bluespower-of-love/ |title=Arlo Guthrie: Outlasting The Blues / Power Of Love (Koch) |journal=Not Fade Away |publisher=Americana and Roots Music – No Depression  |date=January–February 2001 |issue=31 |access-date=January 1, 2012}}</ref> and is not to be confused with the country music group [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]].

Guthrie's 1976 album ''[[Amigo (Arlo Guthrie album)|Amigo]]'' received a five-star (highest rating) from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and may be his best-received work. However, that album, like Guthrie's earlier [[Warner Bros. Records]] albums, is rarely heard today, even though each contains strong folk and folk rock music accompanied by widely regarded musicians such as [[Ry Cooder]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A number of musicians from a variety of genres have joined Guthrie onstage, including [[Pete Seeger]], [[David Bromberg]], [[Cyril Neville]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Judy Collins]], [[John Prine]], Wesley Gray, [[Josh Ritter]], and others. A video from a concert with Seeger at [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts|Wolf Trap]] in 1993 has been a staple of YouTube,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSF89swJ9IU| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/sSF89swJ9IU| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=Arlo Guthrie/I Can't Help Falling In Love With You|access-date=September 9, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> with Guthrie's story-telling showcased in a performance of [[Can't Help Falling in Love]].

On October 23, 2020, Guthrie announced via [[Facebook]] that he had "reached the difficult decision that touring and stage shows are no longer possible," due to a series of strokes that had impaired his ability to walk and perform. All of his scheduled tour appearances for 2020 were cancelled, and Guthrie said he will not accept any new bookings offered. His final performance at Carnegie Hall was on November 29, 2019. His final live touring concert was on March 7, 2020, at The Caverns in Pelham, Tennessee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arloguthrie.com//about|title=About &#124; Arlo Guthrie|website=Arloguthrie.com|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref> He had attempted to record some private concerts in the summer of 2020 but concluded his playing was no longer up to his standards.<ref name="GoneFishing"/>

==Acting==
Though Guthrie is best known for being a musician, singer, and composer, throughout the years he has also appeared as an actor in films and on television. The film ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]'' (1969) is his best known role, but he has had small parts in several films and even co-starred in a television drama, ''[[Byrds of Paradise]]''.

Guthrie has had minor roles in several movies and television series. Usually, he has appeared as himself, often performing music and/or being interviewed about the 1960s, folk music and various social causes.  His television appearances have included a broad range of programs from ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (1979) to ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' (1998).<ref>{{IMDb name|0349241}}</ref> A rare dramatic film part was in the 1992 movie ''[[Roadside Prophets]]''. Guthrie's memorable appearance at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] was documented in the [[Michael Wadleigh]] film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Guthrie also made a pilot for a TV variety show called ''The Arlo Guthrie Show'' in February 1987.  The hour-long program included story telling and musical performances and was filmed in Austin, Texas.  It was broadcast nationally on [[PBS]]. Special guests were Pete Seeger, [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[David Bromberg]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]].<ref>{{Cite web|via=YouTube|title=Amazing Grace ARLO GUTHRIE & FRIENDS|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhNHKlhTHoA| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/xhNHKlhTHoA| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|access-date=February 3, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.knowyoursong.com/Alices-Rock-Roll-Restaurant-by-Arlo-Guthrie-Lyrics.html/-line-64.html|title=Alice's Rock & Roll Restaurant by Arlo Guthrie|last=Guthrie|first=Arlo|website=Knowyoursong.com|access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref>

==Politics==
In his earlier years, at least from the 1960s to the 1980s, Guthrie had taken what seemed a left-leaning approach to American politics, influenced by his father. In his often lengthy comments during concerts, his expressed positions were consistently anti-war, anti-[[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], pro-drugs and in favor of making nuclear power illegal. However, he apparently did not perceive himself as the major youth culture spokesperson he had been regarded as by the media, as evidenced by the lyrics in his 1979 song "Prologue": "I can remember all of your smiles during the demonstrations ... and together we sang our victory songs though we were worlds apart."<ref>{{cite web|first=Alro |last=Guthrie |url=http://www.arlo.net/resources/lyrics/prologue.shtml |title=Prologue: Words and Music by Arlo Guthrie |work=Arlo.net |publisher=Arloco Music Inc |access-date=January 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106111253/http://www.arlo.net/resources/lyrics/prologue.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2011}}</ref> A 1969 rewrite of "Alice's Restaurant" pokes fun at then-former President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and his staff.

Commenting on the 2016 election, Guthrie identified himself as an independent, and said he was "equally suspicious of Democrats as I am of Republicans." He declined to endorse a candidate, noting that he personally liked [[Bernie Sanders]] despite disagreeing with parts of Sanders' platform. While he thought it "wonderful" that [[Donald Trump]] was not relying on campaign donations, he did not believe that it necessarily meant that Trump had the best interests of the country in mind.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/26/arlo-guthrie-on-stupid-politicians-and-50-years-of-thanksgiving-classic-alice-s-restaurant.html?via=desktop&source=facebook|title=Arlo Guthrie on 'Stupid' Politicians and 50 Years of Thanksgiving Classic 'Alice's Restaurant'|work=The Daily Beast|date=November 26, 2015|access-date=November 26, 2015}}</ref>

In 2018, Guthrie contacted publication Urban Milwaukee to clarify his political stance. He stated "I am not a Republican," and expressed deep disagreement with the Trump administration's views, especially the policies on immigration and treatment of detained immigrants by ICE. Guthrie further clarified, "I left the party years ago and do not identify myself with either party these days. I strongly urge my fellow Americans to stop the current trend of guilt by association, and look beyond the party names and affiliations, and work for candidates whose policies are more closely aligned with their own, whatever they may be. ... I don't pretend to be right all the time, and sometimes I've gone so far as to change my mind from time to time."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2018/07/02/im-not-republican-arlo-guthrie-says/|title="I'm Not Republican," Arlo Guthrie Says|work=Urban Milwaukee|date=July 2, 2018|access-date=July 4, 2018}}</ref>

Guthrie expressed support for the [[George Floyd protests]] in June 2020, stating that it would be good if politicians "embraced it rather than resist the evolving nature of what it means to be an American."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arlo.net/forums/blog/?permalink=15556|title=ArloNet News and Announcements|website=Arlo.net|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Arlo Guthrie-Bardentreffen 2010.JPG|thumb|Arlo Guthrie in 2010 in Nuremberg]]
Like his father, [[Woody Guthrie]], he often sings [[protest song|songs of protest]] against social injustice.  He collaborated with poet [[Adrian Mitchell]] to tell the story of Chilean folk singer and activist [[Víctor Jara]] in song.  He regularly performed with folk musician Pete Seeger, one of his father's longtime partners. [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], who had lived for two years in the Guthries' home before Arlo left for boarding school, had absorbed Woody's style perhaps better than anyone; Arlo has been said to have credited Elliott for passing it along to him. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 1991, Guthrie bought the church that had served as Alice and Ray Brock's former home in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts|Great Barrington]], Massachusetts, and converted it to the Guthrie Center, an interfaith meeting place that serves people of all religions.  The center provides weekly free lunches in the community and support for families living with HIV/AIDS, as well as other life-threatening illnesses. It also hosts a summertime concert series and Guthrie does six or seven fund raising shows there every year. There are several annual events such as the Walk-A-Thon to Cure Huntington's Disease and a "Thanksgiving Dinner That Can't Be Beat" for families, friends, doctors and scientists who live and work with Huntington's disease.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/11/AR2005081100624.html |work=The Washington Post |first=Richard |last=Harrington |title=Arlo Guthrie's Storied Career |date=August 12, 2005 |access-date=October 24, 2012}}</ref>

One of the title characters in the comic strip ''[[Arlo and Janis]]'' is named after Guthrie. Cartoonist [[Jimmy Johnson (cartoonist)|Jimmy Johnson]] noted he was inspired by a friend who resembled Guthrie to name one of his characters Arlo.<ref name="Barbie">[https://books.google.com/books?id=BPWpLufrz_MC&pg=PA90&dq=arlo+%26+janis&hl=en&ei=0ENOTI6kNIn2tgOKksztDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=arlo%20%26%20janis&f=false Johnson, Rheta ''Enchanted Evening Barbie and the Second Coming: A Memoir''], NewSouth Books, 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-58838-250-4}} p. 90</ref>

==Personal life==
Guthrie owns a home in [[Washington, Massachusetts]], where he and Jackie Hyde, his wife of 43 years, were longtime residents.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} Jackie died on October 14, 2012, shortly after being diagnosed with liver cancer.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} He and fiancé Marti Ladd live in [[Micco, Florida]].<ref>https://www.sebastiandaily.com/community/exclusive-arlo-guthrie-to-get-married-in-sebastian-31240/</ref>

Guthrie's son Abe Guthrie and his daughters Annie, [[Sarah Lee Guthrie]], and Cathy Guthrie are also musicians.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} Abe Guthrie was formerly in the folk-rock band Xavier and has toured with his father.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} Annie Guthrie writes songs, performs, and takes care of family touring details.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Sarah Lee performs and records with her husband [[Johnny Irion]].{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} Cathy plays [[ukulele]] in Folk Uke, a group she formed with Amy Nelson, a daughter of [[Willie Nelson]].{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

On October 23, 2020, Guthrie announced he was retired from touring and stage shows, citing health issues, including a stroke on Thanksgiving Day 2019 which required brief hospitalization and physical therapy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=John |title='Gone Fishing': Arlo Guthrie, citing health, says he's retired from touring |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/10/24/arlo-guthrie-citing-health-says-hes-retired-touring/6020897002/ |website=usatoday.com |publisher=USA Today |access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref> On his official website and in social media, he posted, "A folksinger's shelf life may be a lot longer than a dancer or an athlete, but at some point, unless you're incredibly fortunate or just plain whacko (either one or both) it's time to hang up the 'Gone Fishing' sign. Going from town to town and doing stage shows, remaining on the road is no longer an option."<ref name="GoneFishing">{{Cite web |last=Guthrie |first=Arlo |date=2020-10-23 |title=Gone Fishing |url=https://www.arloguthrie.com//news/gone-fishing |access-date=2020-10-26 |website=arloguthrie.com |language=en}}</ref>

On October 23, 2021, Guthrie announced that he was engaged to Marti Ladd, with whom he had been in a relationship since shortly after Jackie's death in 2012. It will be the second marriage for each of them. Guthrie met Ladd 20 years ago when he went to Woodstock, New York with his wife Jackie to do a film. They were put up at The Wild Rose Inn, where Ladd was the owner/operator. In September 2016, Ladd sold the Inn and moved in with Guthrie. <ref>{{Cite web|last=Andy Hodges|date=2021-10-24|title=Exclusive: Arlo Guthrie to get married in Sebastian|url=https://www.sebastiandaily.com/community/exclusive-arlo-guthrie-to-get-married-in-sebastian-31240/|access-date=2021-10-24|website=Sebastian Daily|language=en-US}}</ref>
