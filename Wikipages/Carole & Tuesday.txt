In her review of the show for ''[[Syfy]]'', Laura Dale criticized the LGBTQ representation in the show, writing that it kept her from enjoying the anime. She argued that the show often uses "minority characters as punchlines, stereotypes for plot progression, or...presents one particular minority group as dangerous violent monsters created by poor environmental factors."<ref name="Dale2020">{{Cite web |last1=Dale |first1=Laura |title=Poor LGBTQIA+ representation kept me from enjoying one of Netflix's sweetest anime |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/poor-lgbtqia-representation-kept-me-from-enjoying-one-of-netflixs-sweetest-anime |website=[[Syfy]] |access-date=August 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413231642/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/poor-lgbtqia-representation-kept-me-from-enjoying-one-of-netflixs-sweetest-anime |archive-date=April 13, 2020 |date=April 13, 2020 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Dale further stated that, in their view, the efforts by the show at LGBTQ representation were frustrating because the show has a "really sweet, soft queer energy," stated that Marie, ex-wife of Carole and Tuesday's manager, the only positive example of representation in the anime itself, and remained disappointed that the show had "repeated harmful representations of queer characters."
