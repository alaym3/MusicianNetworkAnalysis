In February 2020, it was publicly reported that CFO$ had been in a dispute with their publisher over the previous several months, due to money CFO$ states was owed to them per their publishing deal. CFO$ attempted to have WWE buy them out of their publishing deal and have them work in-house but the publisher rejected the proposal. As a result, WWE has used no new CFO$ music since. In August 2020, CFO$ were released from their recording contract and disbanded shortly afterwards.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Henry |first1=Justin |title=Update On Why Theme Music Creators CFO$ No Longer Work For WWE |url=https://cultaholic.com/posts/update-on-why-theme-music-creators-cfo-no-longer-work-for-wwe |access-date=25 December 2020 |work=Cultaholic |date=20 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Sapp |first1=Sean Ross |title=Exclusive: Why CFO$ Isn't Working With WWE |url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/exclusives/exclusive-why-cfo-isn-t-working-wwe |access-date=25 December 2020 |work=Fightful Wrestling |date=20 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>
