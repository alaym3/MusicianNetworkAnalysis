==Biography==
Immature was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1990 by [[Marques Houston|Marques "Batman" Houston]], [[Young Rome|Jerome "Romeo" Jones]] and Don "Half-Pint" Santos. Kelton "LDB" Kessee (the group's drummer) joined the group in 1994 replacing Santos due to his parents pulling him from the group in 1994 after they starred together in House Party 3. In 1999 the group would change their name to IMx, feeling Immature no longer reflected the band.

===After IMx===
In 2002, the group disbanded. Houston and Jones (under the name [[Young Rome]]) began pursuing solo careers, while Kessee continued his work as a [[record producer]]. Houston became the first former member to release a solo album, ''[[MH (Marques Houston album)|MH]]'', in 2003. Jones followed suit with the release of his debut solo album in 2004, entitled ''[[Food for Thought (Young Rome album)|Food for Thought]]''. Houston later released five additional albums:  ''[[Naked (Marques Houston album)|Naked]]'' (2005), ''[[Veteran (Marques Houston album)|Veteran]]'' (2007), ''[[Mr. Houston]]'' (2009), ''[[Mattress Music]]'' (2010) and ''[[Famous (Marques Houston album)|Famous]]'' (2013).

Houston and Jones have also pursued acting careers, with both starring in the dance film, ''[[You Got Served]]'' (2004). Houston co-starred on ''[[Fat Albert]]'' (2004) and starred in [[UPN]]'s comedy ''[[Cuts (TV series)|Cuts]]''. He also starred in the horror film ''[[Somebody Help Me (film)|Somebody Help Me]]''. He appeared as Roger on the show ''[[Sister Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]'' (1994–1998).
