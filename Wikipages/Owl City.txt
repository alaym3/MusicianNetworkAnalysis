'''Owl City''' is an American [[electronic music]] project created in 2007 in [[Owatonna, Minnesota]]; it is one of several projects by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Young. Young created the project while experimenting with music in his parents' basement. Owl City developed a following on the [[social networking site]] [[MySpace]], like many musicians who achieved success in the late 2000s, before signing with [[Universal Republic Records]], now [[Republic Records]], in 2008.

After two independent releases, Owl City gained mainstream popularity with the 2009 major label debut album ''[[Ocean Eyes (album)|Ocean Eyes]]'', which includes the six-time Platinum single "[[Fireflies (Owl City song)|Fireflies]]". The album was certified Platinum in the United States in April 2010.

In June 2011, Owl City released its third studio album, ''[[All Things Bright and Beautiful (album)|All Things Bright and Beautiful]]'', which was followed by ''[[The Midsummer Station]]'' in August 2012. Owl City has recorded songs for several animated films, including ''[[Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole]]'', ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'', ''[[The Croods]]'' and ''[[The Smurfs 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio|url=http://www.owlcitymusic.com/bio/|website=Owl City|publisher=Republic Records|access-date=June 20, 2014}}</ref> Owl City also has released several charting singles, most notably "[[Good Time (Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen song)|Good Time]]" and "Fireflies".

The [[viral phenomenon]] that was building through Myspace caught the attention of Universal Republic presidents Avery and [[Monte Lipman]] who approached Young with a view to signing the artist.<ref name="hitquarters"/> Republic recommended Young partner up with 27-year-old manager Steve Bursky of Foundations Artist Management and the two began working together in late 2008. When later asked by [[HitQuarters]] why the label chose him for a major label act given his relative inexperience, Bursky said:

<blockquote>"I think they saw Owl City as representing the future of our business. This idea of a kid in a tiny town in rural U.S. being able to make songs in his basement that sound like Top 40 radio could never have happened ten years ago. By hiring a young management company who understands the business circa 2011 over a seasoned industry vet, who might not understand the online spaces well, showed a lot of understanding of where this kid was going to end up having success."<ref name="hitquarters"/></blockquote>

Owl City's label deal with Universal Republic was finally confirmed in February 2009.<ref name="CrazedHits">{{cite web |url=http://www.crazedhits.com/owl-city-signs-to-universal-republic/ |title=Owl City Signs To Universal Republic |publisher=crazedhits.com |date=February 7, 2009 |access-date=July 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206001930/http://www.crazedhits.com/owl-city-signs-to-universal-republic/ |archive-date=December 6, 2018 |url-status=usurped }}</ref> According to Bursky there was initially some disagreement about the direction Owl City should follow, telling HitQuarters: "They were ready to send him into the studio with big producers and polish him up to try to become this thing that he wasn't. But we put our foot down and said, 'Look, the reason you signed this kid is because it's working. Whatever it is about him—his music, his interaction with his fans, his brilliance in the online space—these things are connecting with people, and as soon as you change that you lose what's special about this artist.' To their credit, they really listened and they got it."<ref name="hitquarters"/>

===''Ocean Eyes'' (2009–10)===

In 2010, Young revealed a new musical project known as Sky Sailing, which moved away from his usual [[electronica]] genre of music and introduced acoustic guitar and piano accompaniments into his work. The unrefined tracks were recorded in the summer of 2006 before he began making music as Owl City.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957530/owl-citys-adam-young-releases-a-new-old-project |title=Owl City's Adam Young Releases A New Old Project |last=Lipshutz |first=Jason |work=Billboard |date=July 2, 2010 |access-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref> His first album under this new project is entitled ''[[An Airplane Carried Me to Bed]]'', and was released July 13, 2010, via iTunes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.myspace.com/skysailing |title=Sky Sailing |publisher=MySpace |date=May 13, 2010 |access-date=May 28, 2010}}</ref>

[[Taylor Swift]]'s song "[[Speak Now|Enchanted]]", released on October 25, 2010, was rumored to be about the time she met Adam Young.

==Musical styles and influences==
Owl City's music is described as [[indietronica]] and [[synth-pop]] and is often described as belonging to the [[electronic music]] genre.<ref name="leahey1">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1050183|pure_url=yes}} |title=Owl City > Overview |last=Leahey |first=Andrew |work=AllMusic |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |access-date=November 5, 2009 |quote=He eventually combined those diversions into a blend of electronica and emo-pop, ...}}</ref> Young has stated that he is inspired by [[disco]] and European electronic music, as well as instrumental genres such as drone, ambient, and post-rock. He cites his biggest influences as Johnathon Ford of [[Unwed Sailor]] and [[Thomas Newman]]. Young also incorporates some of his Christian faith into his music, since he is a vocal Christian.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview Of Adam Young Master Mind Behind Owl City|url=http://www.azteenmagazine.com/band-reviews.php?article=714|website=Azteenmagazine.com|date=March 1, 2010|access-date=February 21, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522182910/http://www.azteenmagazine.com/band-reviews.php?article=714|archive-date=May 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fitzmaurice |first=Larry |title=Hot New Band: Owl City |url=https://www.spin.com/articles/hot-new-band-owl-city |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=June 1, 2008 |access-date=November 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611150729/https://www.spin.com/articles/hot-new-band-owl-city |archive-date=June 11, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Moring|first=Mark|title=Owls, Fireflies, and Jesus|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/music/interviews/2010/adamyoung-april10.html|publisher=Christianity Today|access-date=February 19, 2011}}</ref> Young's faith is evident on the album, ''All Things Bright and Beautiful'', especially in "Galaxies". Explaining why the faith-filled song was added to the mix, he said, "I feel like if I were ever to hide the fact that that's what's so important to me, it would be a crime, that I should probably be put in jail for that."<ref>[http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/owl-city-all-things-bright-beautiful-goodwyn.aspx Owl City Reveals "All Things Bright and Beautiful], ''CBN.com''.</ref>

Owl City also has been compared to [[The Postal Service]], often critically, for his combination of fuzzy synths, ironic lyrics and use of female guest singers.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Westhoff |first=Ben |title=Owl City: The Latest In A Long Line Of Rip-Offs |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2009-10-29/music/owl-city-the-latest-in-a-long-line-of-rip-offs/ |newspaper=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=October 28, 2009 |access-date=November 26, 2009}}</ref> [[Pitchfork.com]] goes to say that "The surprise No.&nbsp;1 single in the country, Owl City's 'Fireflies', jacks the Postal Service in such a bald-faced, obvious manner that getting into specifics feels redundant at best and tacky at worst."<ref>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Ian |title=Track Reviews: Owl City – "Fireflies" |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11613-fireflies/ |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=November 5, 2009 |access-date=November 26, 2009}}</ref> In response to the suggestion that his work is derivative, Young suggested in a 2009 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' that ''Ocean Eyes'' is perhaps the "next chapter" after The Postal Service: "The Postal Service released a record in 2003, and that was it. There was really nothing to compare it to until some one else came along and wrote the next chapter. Maybe that's this record. Maybe that's this band."<ref>{{cite news |last=Sisario |first=Ben |title=From Mom's Basement to the Top of the Chart |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/21/arts/music/21owl.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |date=November 21, 2009 |access-date=March 12, 2010}}</ref>
