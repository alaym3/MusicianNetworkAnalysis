A '''camel''' is an [[even-toed ungulate]] in the genus ''Camelus'' that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and, as [[livestock]], they provide food ([[camel milk|milk]] and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from [[camel hair|hair]]). Camels are [[working animal]]s especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped [[dromedary]] makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped [[Bactrian camel]] makes up 6%. The [[Wild Bactrian camel]] is a separate species and is now [[critically endangered]].

The word ''camel'' is also used informally in a wider sense, where the more correct term is "camelid", to include all seven species of the family [[Camelidae]]: the true camels (the above three species), along with the "New World" camelids: the [[llama]], the [[alpaca]], the [[guanaco]], and the [[vicuña]].<ref name=bornstein10>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1751-0147-52-S1-S17 | issn = 1751-0147 | volume = 52 | issue = Suppl 1 | page = S17 | last = Bornstein | first = Set | title = Important ectoparasites of Alpaca (Vicugna pacos) | journal = Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica | year = 2010 | pmc = 2994293 }}</ref> The word itself is derived via {{lang-la|camelus}} and {{lang-grc-gre|κάμηλος}} (''kamēlos'') from Hebrew, Arabic or Phoenician: ''gāmāl''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The New Oxford American Dictionary|edition=2nd|title=camel|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Herper | first = Douglas | title = camel | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | access-date = 28 November 2012 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camel | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927090522/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camel | archive-date = 27 September 2013 }}</ref>

The male dromedary camel has an organ called a [[dulla (organ)|dulla]] in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] to assert dominance and attract females.

===Ecological and behavioral adaptations===
Camels do not directly store water in their humps; they are reservoirs of fatty tissue. When this tissue is metabolized, it yields more than one gram of water for every gram of fat processed. This [[lipolysis|fat metabolization]], while releasing energy, causes water to evaporate from the lungs during [[breathing|respiration]] (as oxygen is required for the metabolic process): overall, there is a net decrease in water.<ref name=vannjones>{{cite web|url=http://www.djur.cob.lu.se/Djurartiklar/Kamel.html|title=What secrets lie within the camel's hump?|first=Kerstin|last=Vann Jones|publisher=Lund University|location=Sweden|access-date=7 January 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523104134/http://www.djur.cob.lu.se/Djurartiklar/Kamel.html|archive-date=23 May 2009}}</ref><ref name=rastogi71>{{cite book | publisher = New Age International | isbn = 9788122412796 | last = Rastogi | first = S.

Camels are able to withstand changes in [[body temperature]] and water consumption that would kill most other mammals. Their temperature ranges from {{convert|34|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} at dawn and steadily increases to {{convert|40|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} by sunset, before they cool off at night again.<ref name=roberts86 /> In general, to compare between camels and the other livestock, camels lose only 1.3 liters of fluid intake every day while the other livestock lose 20 to 40 liters per day (Breulmann, et al., 2007).<ref>Breulmann, M., Böer, B., Wernery, U., Wernery, R., El Shaer, H., Alhadrami, G., ...

The camel [[immune system]] differs from those of other mammals. Normally, the Y-shaped [[antibody]] molecules consist of two heavy (or long) chains along the length of the Y, and two light (or short) chains at each tip of the Y. Camels, in addition to these, also have antibodies made of only two heavy chains, a trait that makes them smaller and more durable. These "heavy-chain-only" antibodies, discovered in 1993, are thought to have developed 50&nbsp;million years ago, after camelids split from ruminants and pigs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koenig |first1=R. |title=VETERINARY MEDICINE: 'Camelized' Antibodies Make Waves |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5855 |page=1373 |year=2007 |pmid=18048665 |doi=10.1126/science.318.5855.1373|s2cid=71028674 }}</ref> Camels suffer from [[surra]] caused by ''[[Trypanosoma evansi]]'' wherever camels are domesticated in the world,<ref name="Sazmand-Joachim-2017">{{cite journal | last1=Sazmand | first1=Alireza | last2=Joachim | first2=Anja | title=Parasitic diseases of camels in Iran (1931–2017) – a literature review | journal=[[Parasite (journal)|Parasite]] | publisher=[[EDP Sciences]] | volume=24 | year=2017 | issn=1776-1042 | doi=10.1051/parasite/2017024 | pages=1–15 | s2cid=13783061 | pmid=28617666 | pmc=5479402}} Article Number 21. p.{{nbs}}2</ref> and resultantly camels have evolved trypanolytic antibodies as with many mammals.

Like [[horse]]s, camels originated in North America and eventually spread across [[Beringia]] to Asia. They survived in the Old World, and eventually humans domesticated them and spread them globally. Along with many other megafauna in North America, the original wild camels were wiped out during the spread of the first [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from Asia into North America, 10 to 12,000 years ago; although fossils have never been associated with definitive evidence of hunting.<ref name=worboys10 /><ref name=macphee99 />

Martin Heide's 2010 work on the domestication of the camel tentatively concludes that humans had domesticated the Bactrian camel by at least the middle of the third millennium somewhere east of the [[Zagros Mountains]], with the practice then moving into Mesopotamia. Heide suggests that mentions of camels "in the patriarchal narratives may refer, at least in some places, to the Bactrian camel", while noting that the camel is not mentioned in relationship to [[Canaan]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heide | first1 = Martin | year = 2011 | title = The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible | journal = Ugarit-Forschungen | volume = 42 | pages = 367–68 | doi =10.13140/2.1.2090.8161 }}</ref>

Recent excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] by Lidar Sapir-Hen and Erez Ben-Yosef discovered what may be the earliest domestic camel bones yet found in Israel or even outside the [[Arabian Peninsula]], dating to around 930 BC.

The existence of camels in Mesopotamia—but not in the eastern Mediterranean lands—is not a new idea. The historian [[Richard Bulliet]] did not think that the occasional mention of camels in the Bible meant that the domestic camels were common in the Holy Land at that time.<ref name=Time>{{cite news|last= Dias|first= Elizabeth|title= The Mystery of the Bible's Phantom Camels|url= http://world.time.com/2014/02/11/the-mystery-of-the-bibles-phantom-camels/|access-date= 22 February 2014|newspaper= Time|date =Feb 11, 2014|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140215013057/http://world.time.com/2014/02/11/the-mystery-of-the-bibles-phantom-camels/|archive-date= 15 February 2014}}</ref> The archaeologist [[William F.

The official report by Sapir-Hen and Ben-Joseph notes:

<blockquote>The introduction of the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) as a pack animal to the [[southern Levant]] ... substantially facilitated trade across the vast deserts of Arabia, promoting both economic and social change (e.g., Kohler 1984; Borowski 1998: 112–116; Jasmin 2005). This ... has generated extensive discussion regarding the date of the earliest domestic camel in the southern Levant (and beyond) (e.g., Albright 1949: 207; Epstein 1971: 558–584; Bulliet 1975; Zarins 1989; Köhler-Rollefson 1993; Uerpmann and Uerpmann 2002; Jasmin 2005; 2006; Heide 2010; Rosen and Saidel 2010; Grigson 2012). Most scholars today agree that the dromedary was exploited as a pack animal sometime in the early [[Iron Age]] (not before the 12th century [BC])</blockquote>

and concludes:

<blockquote>Current data from copper smelting sites of the [[Arabah|Aravah Valley]] enable us to pinpoint the introduction of domestic camels to the southern Levant more precisely based on stratigraphic contexts associated with an extensive suite of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]]. The data indicate that this event occurred not earlier than the last third of the 10th century [BC] and most probably during this time. The coincidence of this event with a major reorganization of the copper industry of the region—attributed to the results of the campaign of Pharaoh [[Shoshenq I]]—raises the possibility that the two were connected, and that camels were introduced as part of the efforts to improve efficiency by facilitating trade.<ref name="Sapir-Hen 2013 277–285"/></blockquote>

By at least 1200 BC the first camel saddles had appeared, and [[Bactrian camels]] could be ridden. The first saddle was positioned to the back of the camel, and control of the Bactrian camel was exercised by means of a stick. However, between 500 and 100 BC, Bactrian camels came into military use. New saddles, which were inflexible and bent, were put over the humps and divided the rider's weight over the animal. In the seventh century BC the military Arabian saddle evolved, which again improved the saddle design slightly.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last= Fagan|editor-first= Brian M|editor-link= Brian M.

When his arrangements were complete, he gave his troops orders to slay all the other Lydians who came in their way without mercy, but to spare Croesus and not kill him, even if he should be seized and offer resistance. The reason why Cyrus opposed his camels to the enemy's horse was because the horse has a natural dread of the camel, and cannot abide either the sight or the smell of that animal. By this stratagem he hoped to make Croesus's horse useless to him, the horse being what he chiefly depended on for victory. The two armies then joined battle, and immediately the Lydian war-horses, seeing and smelling the camels, turned round and galloped off; and so it came to pass that all Croesus's hopes withered away. | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121201230133/http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.html | archive-date = 1 December 2012 }}</ref><ref name="historygroup-nz">{{cite web | publisher = History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | title = Cameliers and camels at war | work = New Zealand History online | access-date = 5 December 2012 | date = 30 August 2009 | url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/camel-corps | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120316110701/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/camel-corps | archive-date = 16 March 2012 }}</ref>

The ''[[Tropas Nómadas]]'' (Nomad Troops) were an auxiliary regiment of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] tribesmen serving in the colonial army in Spanish Sahara (today [[Western Sahara]]). Operational from the 1930s until the end of the Spanish presence in the territory in 1975, the ''Tropas Nómadas'' were equipped with small arms and led by Spanish officers.

====21st century competition====
At the King Abdulaziz Camel Festival, in Saudi Arabia, thousands of camels are paraded and are judged on their lips and humps. The festival also features camel racing and camel milk tasting and has combined prize money of $57m (£40m). In August 2021, it was reported that 12 camels had been disqualified from the beauty contest after their owners had tried to improve their good looks with injections of [[botox]], into the animals' lips, noses and jaws.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-42802901 |title=Camels banned from Saudi beauty contest over Botox |work=BBC News |date=24 January 2018 |access-date=26 August 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Muslims]] consider camel meat ''[[halal]]'' ({{lang-ar|حلال}}, 'allowed'). However, according to some [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic schools of thought]], a state of impurity is brought on by the consumption of it.

He was asked about saying prayer in places where the camels lie down. He replied: Do not offer prayer in places where the camels lie down. These are the places of Satan. He was asked about saying prayer in the sheepfolds. He replied: You may offer prayer in such places; these are the places of blessing.}}</ref> Also, some Islamic schools of thought consider it ''[[haram]]'' ({{lang-ar|حرام}}, 'forbidden') for a Muslim to perform ''[[Salat]]'' in places where camels lie, as it is said to be a dwelling place of the ''[[Devil (Islam)|Shaytan]]'' ({{lang-ar|شيطان}}, '[[Devil]]').<ref name="purification"/> According to [[Abu Yusuf]] (d.798), the [[camel urine|urine of camel]] may be used for medical treatment if necessary, but according to [[Abū Ḥanīfa]]h, the drinking of camel urine is discouraged.<ref name="alden">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=John Alden|title=The Word of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAj-DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA98|access-date=25 October 2016|year=1994|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-79076-6|page=98|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408182755/https://books.google.com/books?id=rAj-DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA98|archive-date=8 April 2017}}</ref>

===Cultural depictions===
What may be the oldest carvings of camels were discovered in 2018 in Saudi Arabia. They were analysed by researchers from several scientific disciplines and, in 2021, were estimated to be 7,000 to 8,000 years old.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-58570259 Saudi Arabia camel carvings dated to prehistoric era]'', BBC, September 15, 2021</ref> The dating of [[rock art]] is made difficult by the lack of organic material in the carvings that may be tested, so the researchers attempting to date them tested animal bones found associated with the carvings, assessed erosion patterns, and analysed tool marks in order to determine a correct date for the creation of the sculptures. This [[Neolithic]] dating would make the carvings significantly older than Stonehenge (5,000 years old) and the Egyptian pyramids at Giza (4,500 years old) and it predates estimates for the domestication of camels.

A small population of introduced camels, dromedaries and Bactrians, wandered through [[Southwestern United States]] after having been imported in the 19th century as part of the [[U.S. Camel Corps]] experiment. When the project ended, they were used as draft animals in mines and escaped or were released. Twenty-five U.S. camels were bought and exported to Canada during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].<ref name=mantz06/>

The Bactrian camel is, {{as of|2010|lc=yes}}, reduced to an estimated 1.4&nbsp;million animals, most of which are domesticated.<ref name=fedewa00/><ref name=dolby10>{{cite book| publisher = Random House Digital, Inc| isbn = 9780307716255| last = Dolby| first = Karen| title = You Must Remember This: Easy Tricks & Proven Tips to Never Forget Anything, Ever Again| date = 10 August 2010 | page=170}}</ref><ref name=denverzoo>{{cite web|publisher=Denver Zoo |title=Bactrian Camel |access-date=7 December 2012 |url=http://www.denverzoo.org/downloads/dzoo_bactrian_camel.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512074950/http://www.denverzoo.org/downloads/dzoo_bactrian_camel.pdf |archive-date=12 May 2013 }}</ref> The [[Wild Bactrian camel]] is a separate species and is the only truly wild (as opposed to feral) camel in the world.
