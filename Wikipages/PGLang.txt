==History==
Kendrick Lamar and Dave Free met when the two were in high school, and also co-directed music videos together under the name The Little Homies.<ref>{{cite web |last=Yoo |first=Noah |title=Dave Free No Longer Co-President of Top Dawg Entertainment: Report |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/dave-free-no-longer-co-president-of-top-dawg-entertainment-report/ |website=Pitchfork}}</ref> In 2019, Free announced his departure from [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] after being the co-president of the label, saying "None of the tactics we used back in the day to break Kendrick, [[Ab-Soul]], [[Jay Rock]], or [[Schoolboy Q|Schoolboy]] would work now. It's a whole new game. Blogs were very influential back then and I'd have to build a lot of relationships with blogs and now it's just more about streaming. You have to have the relationships with the streaming sites and it can't just be a fake relationship."<ref>{{cite web |title=Dave Free Leaves Top Dawg Entertainment |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/top-dawg-entertainment-dave-free-split-894781/ |website=Rolling Stone}}</ref>
