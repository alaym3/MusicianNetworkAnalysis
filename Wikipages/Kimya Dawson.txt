'''Kimya Dawson''' (born November 17, 1972) is an American [[Folk music|folk]] singer-songwriter, best known as one half of the [[anti-folk]] duo [[the Moldy Peaches]]. Dawson's work with the Moldy Peaches earned her a [[cult following]] and critical acclaim, with their 2001 song "[[Anyone Else but You|Anyone Else But You]]" landing a spot in multiple acclaimed indie film soundtracks. [[Anyone Else but You|"Anyone Else But You"]] as performed by [[Michael Cera]] and [[Elliot Page]] charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] after its prominent inclusion in the 2007 film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'', the soundtrack of which includes several songs by Dawson and her associated musical acts. The song remains Dawson's highest charting single to date. In addition to her work with the Moldy Peaches, Dawson has released seven solo studio albums and collaborated with various other artists from a diverse range of genres, including  [[Aesop Rock]], [[They Might Be Giants]], [[The Mountain Goats]], and [[Third Eye Blind]].

==Career==

Dawson's children's album, ''[[Alphabutt]]'', was released on September 10, 2008. Song titles include "The Alphabutt Song," "Seven Hungry Tigers," "Little Monster Babies," "Wiggle My Tooth" and "Pee Pee in the Potty," and collaborators include former [[Third Eye Blind]] guitarist Kevin Cadogan and a number of Dawson's other musical friends and their children. She has also been invited to participate in the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' television program.<ref name="reuters1">{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN0229071320080402 |title=Singer extends Juno buzz with kids album |publisher=Reuters/[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]] |access-date=April 5, 2008 |last=Graff |first=Gary |date=April 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110015859/http://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN0229071320080402 |archive-date=January 10, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Soundtrack work==
Dawson's songs are featured in the films ''[[The Guatemalan Handshake]]'' and ''Glue'', both of which were shown at the Olympia Film Festival in November 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|title=From K Records to the silver screen|url=http://www.theolympian.com/film/story/305029-p2.html|last=Gilmore|first=Molly|publisher=The Olympian|access-date=December 20, 2007|date=December 20, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 2008 Dawson contributed the song "Anthrax"—about [[September 11 attacks|9/11]]—to the soundtrack of the ''[[Body of War]]'' documentary.<ref name="reuters1" />

"[[Anyone Else But You]]", a song she recorded with the Moldy Peaches, was used in the documentary ''[[Murderball (film)|Murderball]]'', about a team of wheelchair rugby players. This song was also used in the film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]''. The melody of this song, with new lyrics, was used in a commercial for Atlantis.com.

Critics warmly received the music in ''Juno'', where Dawson's "sweetly melancholic acoustic-strummed tunes" helped define the character of a pregnant young teenager who decides to have her baby.<ref name=twsGxxx>{{cite news

Dawson's authentic persona has a demeanor which is "sheepish and guileless and awkward in a way that you really can't fake" and who sometimes looks "legitimately terrified" during performances, according to ''Village Voice'' music critic Rob Harvilla.<ref name=twsJunGi88/>
