'''Vitaly Vladasovich Grachev''' ({{lang-ru|Виталий Владасович Грачёв}}; {{lang-uk|Віталій Владасовіч Грачов|Vitali Vladasovich Hrachov}}; born 19 February 1979), known professionally as '''Vitas''' ({{lang-rus|Витас||ˈvʲitəs}}), is a Ukrainian-Russian singer, songwriter and actor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mk.ru/incident/2013/05/20/856834-vitas-menyal-prava-kak-perchatki.html|title=Витас менял права как перчатки|website=mk.ru|access-date=20 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://vesti.ua/kultura/63196-vitas-gotov-otkazatsja-ot-ukrainskogo-grazhdanstva|title=Витас готов отказаться от украинского гражданства|website=vesti.ua|date=29 July 2014}}</ref> Vitas is known for his unique [[falsetto]] and his eclectic musical style, which incorporates elements of [[operatic pop]], [[techno]], [[dance music|dance]], [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], and [[folk music|folk]].

Having achieved prominence through Russian television in the early 2000s, Vitas crossed into Asian markets in 2005.<ref name="vitas.com.ru">{{cite web|url=http://www.vitas.com.ru/pressa_eng.php |title=Vitas' official site.

(from his 2002 [[Smile! (Vitas album)|album of the same name]]) achieved [[Viral video|viral success]]; the unusual music videos for "Opera #2" and "The 7th Element" have been cited as the most prominent examples of this.<ref name="disc" />

Vitas has performed with entertainment labels such as [[Universal Music Group]], and has toured extensively in several countries.<ref name="vitas.com.ru" /><ref name="gemini">{{cite web|url=http://vitas.com.ru/gemini_press_release_eng.htm|title=Gemini Sun Records Press Release|date=29 January 2008|publisher=Vitas.com.ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729164445/http://vitas.com.ru/gemini_press_release_eng.htm|archive-date=29 July 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=28 September 2010}}</ref> He designs his own stage costumes,<ref>[http://english.sina.com/ent/1/2008/0130/144214.html Source: ''Shanghai Daily'']</ref> and employs a [[backing band]] named DIVA during live performances.<ref>[http://www.gruppa-diva.narod.ru/index_.html DIVA website] (Russian)</ref>

==Early life==
Vitaly Vladasovich Grachev was born in [[Daugavpils]], which was then in the [[Latvian SSR]], on 19 February 1979.<ref>http://www.mega-stars.ru/music_stars/vitas.php</ref> He soon moved with his parents to Ukraine, where he was raised in [[Odessa]]. He is the son of Lilia Mihailovna Gracheva, who was Russian, and Vladas Arkadevich Grachev. His paternal grandfather, Arkadiy Davidovich Marantzman, was [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] while his paternal grandmother was of [[Latvians|Latvian]] descent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zen.yandex.ru/media/imya/kto-po-nacionalnosti-vitas-i-gde-on-seichas-ego-roditeli-ne-inoplanetiane-nado-je-5dedf37fec575b00b206c4bbHe|title=Biography of Vitas|access-date=2021-03-17}}</ref> He showed an interest in music from an early age; his grandfather taught him to play the accordion at the age of 5 and wrote his first song, "Rain in [[Tbilisi]]", when he was 6. He later said that he had composed at least 1,000 songs by the age of 12. He attended an art school in Odessa from the age of seven, and appeared in various theatrical productions as a teenager.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mega-stars.ru/music_stars/vitas.php|title=Biography of Vitas|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> His dean at the art school in Odessa reportedly hailed him as "a gift from God".

==Career==
[[File:Автограф Витаса.jpg|150px|thumb|Vitas' signature]]
Vitas came to public attention in Russia in December 2000 with the song "Opera #2", which was notable for his surprisingly high-pitched and energetic vocals. In the music video, he portrays an eccentric lonely man with fish gills who lives in a bathtub with jars of fish and plays the accordion naked. In February 2001, he held his first concert, "Opera #...", at the "Russia" Concert Hall in Moscow, and presented his first concert tour, Philosophy of Miracle, which ended in early 2003.<ref>{{Citation|title=VITAS - Full Concert: "Opera #..." (Moscow, 2001)|date=February 2001|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4xp1fSF1zw|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>

Vitas received an invitation from [[Lucio Dalla]], the composer who created [[Caruso (song)|"Caruso"]], to perform this song together with the author at the "San Remo in Moscow" concert in the [[State Kremlin Palace]] in 2003. Mr. Dalla then invited Vitas to come to Rome to take part in the rehearsals of "Toska", a modern version of Puccini's opera.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In dedication to his mother who died in 2001, Vitas released two albums, "The Songs of My Mother" and "Mama".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Витас споет в Одессе в память о трагически погибшей матери|url=https://od.vgorode.ua/news/sobytyia/93595|access-date=2020-07-22|website=od.vgorode.ua|language=ru}}</ref> "The Songs of My Mother" included classic Russian songs which are sometimes considered to be the "gold reserves" of Russian pop-music. In November 2003, Vitas presented his second tour program, "The Songs of My Mother" in the Russia Concert Hall in Moscow. Compared to the flamboyant nature of his previous "Philosophy of Miracle" tour, "The Songs of My Mother" was more conservative, drawing on classic Russian songs. From 2004 to 2006, Vitas' management, the "Pudovkin" Production Center continued "The Songs of My Mother" tour in Russia and the [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Israel]] and the [[Baltic states]].<ref name="vitas.com.ru" />

In addition to his singing career, Vitas also starred in a murder mystery television series called "Сволочь ненаглядная" ("Beloved Scoundrel"), in which he played a pop singer with an unusually high voice.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beloved Scoundrel (Сволочь ненаглядная) - Part 1|date=December 2002|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FM4yoqQ9ps|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> He also starred in a comedy called Crazy Day.<ref>{{Citation|title=Crazy Day|date=2005|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeQNyCw8ioM|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>

In June 2006, Vitas was invited by [[China Central Television]] to take part in a grand event entitled "The Year of Russia in China" in Beijing. Vitas performed two songs, "The Star" and "Opera #2" during the event, marking the beginning of his popularity in China.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Vitas' "Return Home" tour, beginning in 2006, had a conservative atmosphere similar to the "Songs of My Mother" tour. The concert performed in [[Saint Petersburg]] on 4 March 2007 was later released on DVD on Vitas' website, as well as officially in some countries, albeit with many songs removed. The full concert in Moscow was later released on DVD.

In October 2007, Vitas was signed with now-defunct American label Gemini Sun Records. Gemini Sun released the Audio Visual Connect Series Vitas compilation CD + DVD set featuring eight music videos with the corresponding songs also on audio CD, in addition to a bonus audio track.<ref>[http://www.vitas.com.ru/titul_eng.php "Vitas: Artist Who You Have Been Waiting For"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928104349/http://vitas.com.ru/titul_eng.php |date=28 September 2010 }}</ref> In 2008, Vitas also released "Light of A New Day", a 40-minute track of non-lyrical vocalization and instrumentation. The song is available as a free download on his website.

The "Sleepless Night" tour included concerts in China and more elaborate presentations than the more conservative "Return Home" program. Vitas performed his "Return Home" concert in [[Bucharest]], Romania on 25 February 2009. The concert was broadcast on the Romanian TVR2 and TVRi television networks, achieving their highest ratings in twelve months.<ref name="Vitas">{{cite web |url=http://www.vitas.com.ru/titul_eng.php |title=Vitas'official site. News |publisher=Vitas.com.ru |access-date=28 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928104349/http://vitas.com.ru/titul_eng.php |archive-date=28 September 2010  }}</ref> A benefit concert, with Vitas performing "The Star", was held on 12 May 2009 in [[Sichuan]] province in memory of the victims of the previous year's earthquake there; a song known as "Mommy and Son" was released in late October 2009 in remembrance of the victims. It was the very first title track of the "Mommy and Son" album (released 1 September 2011), which included new songs, such as "C'est La Vie" ([[French language|French]] for "Such is life"), "Once More", "Let the Father Teach!", "Young Rook" and others.<ref name="disc" />

Vitas played the role of Gude in the Chinese film ''[[Mulan (2009 film)|Mulan]]'', which premiered in [[Beijing]] on 16 November 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mulan.ent.sina.com.cn/ |title=《花木兰》电影官方网站 |publisher=Mulan.ent.sina.com.cn |access-date=28 September 2010}}</ref> He recorded music for the film's soundtrack.<ref name="vitas.com.ru"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://asianfanatics.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=646744&st=-40&p=646744&#entry646744 |title=Vitas Guest Stars in 'Mulan' – AsianFanatics Forum |publisher=Asianfanatics.net |date=20 April 2009 |access-date=28 September 2010}}</ref>

In early 2011, Vitas performed a series of seven "Sleepless Night" concerts in [[New York City]], [[Toronto]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]], [[Vancouver]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[San Francisco]]. Later that year, he played the role of Bolshevik [[Comintern]] official [[Grigori Voitinsky]] in the Chinese propaganda film ''[[The Founding of a Party]]''. He also starred with [[Huang Shengyi]] in the musical ''A Night to Be a Star''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In March 2011, Vitas' concert tour "Mommy and Son" started in several cities of Russia. His large-scale concert at the Palace of Arts "Ukraina" in Kyiv in March 2012 was broadcast in Ukraine's main TV channels and later released in DVD. In 2013 he brought the tour to Germany, performing in several cities.

In June 2015, Vitas' unusual music video for his 2001 song "The 7th Element", which features him as a kind of humanoid alien performing on a ''[[Top of the Pops]]''-esque show, became popular after it was posted on [[Reddit]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Reddit - Videos|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3bmkei/i_was_looking_for_fifth_element_videos_and_went_2/|website=www.reddit.com|date=30 June 2015|access-date=2016-11-20}}</ref>

In 2017, Vitas' song "Smile" became popular in [[Brazil]], where [[Facebook]] pages such as "South America Memes" were responsible for [[internet memes|memes]] using footage from his performance of the song at the "Songs of My Mother" tour. On 5 October, he thanked the pages for his popularity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/vitas.official/photos/a.161163537292989.40214.154744307934912/1474800815929248/?type=3|title=Vitas|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-22}}</ref>

In August 2020, Vitas' 20th anniversary EP ''OPERA20'' was released in China.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Announcement post of Vitas' anniversary EP "OPERA20" on Weibo.|url=https://weibo.com/1418661771/JdC7XnJSR?from=page_1004061418661771_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime}}</ref> The album contained songs in English, Russian, and Chinese, as well as a collaboration with Chinese singer [[Elvis Wang]]. 1,000 limited edition vinyl copies were issued.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Announcement post of the vinyl release of Vitas' anniversary EP "OPERA20"|url=https://weibo.com/7214112629/Jdkr6eM6h?from=page_1006067214112629_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Noted for fiercely guarding his private life, Vitas has frequently declined interviews. He married his wife, Svetlana, in 2006.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} They have a daughter and a son. In an unusual move, he allowed himself and his family to be interviewed on the talk show ''Let Them Talk'' in January 2012.

In 2007, Vitas appeared on the talk show ''Everybody Is At Home'' to discuss his personal history and his development as an artist. Later that year, he appeared on the show again to address a man's allegations that he was Vitas' biological father. After much backlash from friends and family, and the man's admission of lying, the DNA results proved that he was not Vitas' father. To show that he had no hard feelings, Vitas sang and danced with the man's mother on the show.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On 10 May 2013, Vitas was arrested after hitting a cyclist with his car near the [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre|VVC Exhibition Centre]] in [[Moscow]]. The cyclist was uninjured and proceeded to film the scene with police afterward, which depicted an unkempt and possibly intoxicated Vitas being held by authorities. The accident was widely covered by [[Russia-1]] and [[Channel One Russia]],<ref>[http://russia.tv/video/show/video_id/393812/brand_id/5403 TV news of ''Russia-1'' about Vitas' incident on 10 May 2013] (Russian)</ref><ref>[http://www.1tv.ru/news/social/232665 TV news of ''Channel One Russia'' about Vitas' incident on 10 May 2013] (Russian)</ref> two of many other TV channels who broadcast Vitas' driving license with his personal data, which had been presented to journalists by a police officer.<ref name="1tv">[http://www.1tv.ru/news/social/232799 Russian television Channel One Russia shown Vitas' Ukrainian driving license after accident on 10 May 2013 with all personal data] (Russian)</ref><ref name="russia1">[http://russia.tv/video/show/video_id/399983/brand_id/5403 Russian television Russia-1 shown Vitas' Ukrainian driving license after accident on 10 May 2013 with all personal data] (Russian)</ref>
