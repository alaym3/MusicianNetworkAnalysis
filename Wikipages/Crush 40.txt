'''Crush 40''' is a Japanese-American [[hard rock]] band. The group consists of guitarist and composer [[Jun Senoue]] and vocalist [[Johnny Gioeli]], although Senoue has featured other lead vocalists on a Crush 40 album.  Crush 40 is best known for their contributions to the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' video game series.

Senoue is employed by [[Sega]] as a composer and sound director, and has worked with Sega as a composer since 1993.  While preparing music for ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', he contacted Gioeli to record the game's title track, "Open Your Heart".  They also recorded the soundtrack for ''[[NASCAR Arcade]]'' under the name "Sons of Angels" and released it in 2000 in Japan as the album ''Thrill of the Feel''.  Afterward, Senoue and Gioeli stayed in contact and continued to record new music for further ''Sonic'' games, as well as their own original music, and performed live concerts.

Crush 40 has released a total of two studio albums, two live albums, two compilations, an EP, and individual tracks, mostly under Sega's [[Wave Master]] label.  The band's musical style of hard rock, considered by some to be a continuation of [[glam rock]], has created a legacy with fans of the ''Sonic'' video game series.

According to Allegra Frank and Philip Kollar of [[Polygon (website)|''Polygon'']], Crush 40 and Senoue have made "some of the most memorable [[Hard rock|butt rock]] tracks from Sonic history (and the history of video games in general)".<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Sonic series' high point is not a game|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/5/12053024/sonic-adventure-2-city-escape-best-song-ever|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|last2=Kollar|first2=Philip|date=July 5, 2016|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230215534/https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/5/12053024/sonic-adventure-2-city-escape-best-song-ever|archive-date=December 30, 2019|access-date=May 13, 2020}}</ref> Writing for [[Vice (magazine)|''Vice'']], Andy McDonald stated that Crush 40 helped to keep [[glam rock]] alive after [[grunge]] had supplanted it as a more popular style of rock music.<ref name=":1" /> Reviewing the album ''Crush 40'', Chris Greening of ''Video Game Music Online'' highlights the hard rock sound and showing of Gioeli's experience in the vocals, stating that "Live and Learn" is "an ecstatic Americana rock anthem featuring Johnny at his best", while also stating the instrumentals are inspired by early 1990s [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].  He calls the album "among the best of the genre in [[Video game music|game music]]".<ref name=":0" />

Gioeli, who is not a [[gamer]], described his songwriting process with Senoue for games as being akin to writing a soundtrack for a movie, watching scenes from the game or looking at [[storyboard]]s.  According to Gioeli, "Jun and I have our system—he starts with a musical feeling and sometimes a melody idea and then I go nuts with it! The lyrics do have to be approved for content, but that's it. We have the freedom to write what we feel is the right song for the scene."<ref name=":1" /> He has stated that among his three main projects—Crush 40, Hardline, and performing with [[Axel Rudi Pell]]—all three are different styles of rock music and he has to set himself in the "right emotions" to perform.<ref name=":10" />

When interviewed about his style and that of the band, Jun Senoue said, "I know what my style is, and I know what my favourite genres of music are. I listen to a lot of metal music, as well as other genres of music, and my inspiration is always there. The style of the music in the game does change, and it gives a great sense of progression... When we got together to write stuff for ''Shadow'' [''the Hedgehog''], we found that our fresh ideas were a lot different to the songs we'd written back in 2002 – our sound had changed."<ref>{{cite web|title=Q&A with Jun Senoue Part 1|url=http://junsenoue.com/content/view/114/19/|author=Tuff|first=Adam|date=August 14, 2006|website=junsenoue.com|publisher=[[Jun Senoue]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223060735/http://junsenoue.com/content/view/114/19/|archive-date=February 23, 2007|access-date=August 14, 2006}}</ref>

Writing for ''Fanbyte'', Sean Aitchison stated that Crush 40 provided a signature musical style for the ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' series and expanded the musical tastes of ''Sonic'' fans.  According to Aitchison, "The band embedded themselves in the memories and hearts of an entire generation of ''Sonic'' fans. Though their contributions to the ''Sonic'' franchise may be small in number, they are massive in impact."<ref name=":2" /> Kofi-Charu Nat Turner's 2008 study of media usage in an American urban middle school listed the band as a common interest within the group studied.<ref name=Turner/>
