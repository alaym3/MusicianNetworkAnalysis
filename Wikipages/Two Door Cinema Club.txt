In the United States, where the band are signed to [[Glassnote Records]], the album was released on 27 April 2010.

The band's second album ''[[Beacon (album)|Beacon]]'' was released on 3 September 2012, debuted at number one on the [[Irish Albums Chart]]<ref name="irish-charts.com">{{cite web|first=Steffen |last=Hung |url=http://www.irish-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Two+Door+Cinema+Club |title=Discography Two Door Cinema Club |publisher=irishcharts.com |access-date=3 September 2012}}</ref> and reached number two in the [[UK Albums Chart]].

The band's third album ''[[Gameshow (album)|Gameshow]]'' was released on 14 October 2016. The first single, "[[Are We Ready? (Wreck)]]" was released on 14 June 2016 and was debuted on [[Annie Mac (radio show)|Annie Mac's Hottest Record]] on [[BBC Radio 1]]. Two more singles, "Bad Decisions" and the title track "Gameshow" were released prior to the album and are also included on the track list.

==Formation==

Trimble and Halliday first met while attending [[Bangor Grammar School]]; the pair later met Baird while he was flirting with girls who were known to his future bandmates.<ref name="ameliasmagazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.ameliasmagazine.com/music/two-door-cinema-club-an-interview/2009/10/27/|title=Two Door Cinema Club – An Interview|access-date=28 December 2009|date=27 October 2009|work=Amelia's Magazine}}</ref> The three first performed as a band at the age of 16 on ''[[ATL Rock School]]'' under the name Life Without Rory; the band finished in last place.

Trimble, Halliday and Baird formed another band shortly after the demise of their first musical project; on this occasion, a permanent drummer was not included.
