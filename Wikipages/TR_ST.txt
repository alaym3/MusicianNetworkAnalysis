'''TR/ST''' (previously known as '''Trust''') is a Canadian [[electronic music]] project of Robert Alfons. It was formed as a band in 2010 when Alfons met [[Maya Postepski]] of [[Austra (band)|Austra]].<ref name="music.cbc.ca"/> The project has spawned four albums so far: ''[[Trst (album)|TRST]]'' (2012), ''[[Joyland (TR/ST album)|Joyland]]'' (2014), ''[[The Destroyer (Part 1)]]'' and ''[[The Destroyer (Part 2)]]'' (2019). Alfons has also produced remixes for [[Feist (singer)|Feist]], [[Moby]], Zhala and [[Jonna Lee (singer)|Jonna Lee]].

==History==
===2010–2013: Formation and ''TRST''===
Alfons and Postepski met in late 2009, started writing songs together,<ref name="nowtoronto.com_1 March 2012"/> and formed the band in January 2010,<ref name="nowtoronto.com_17 June 2010"/> insisting that they were more than just an Austra side project.<ref name="nationalpost_1 March 2012"/> The band started out with [[Sacred Bones Records]], releasing their debut single "Candy Walls" and "Bulbform" in 2011,<ref name="collectionscanada.gc.ca1"/> on the strength of the former, they were signed to record label Arts & Crafts in the same year.<ref name="exclaim.ca_20 September 2011"/>

They released their critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Trst (album)|TRST]]'' on 28 February 2012 on the Arts & Crafts label.<ref name="collectionscanada.gc.ca2"/> Critic Luis-Enrique Arrazola of the ''[[National Post]]'' said (of their Toronto release party), "Trust gave an outstanding performance proving that they're an act worthy of all the hype. With a set far past midnight, they're the perfect ending to a wild night in the city, taking you on a relentless trip through a set list dripping with sexual tension before winding down to the last pulses of the synthesizer."<ref name="nationalpost_5 March 2012"/>

Larry Fitzmaurice of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' rated the album 7.4 out of 10 saying "...I quite like Alfons' voice; it has a slithering, grimy quality to it that increases the raunch-factor on particularly dirty-sounding tracks like "Shoom" and "Bulbform", and when he struts his stuff on "Sulk" and "Dressed for Space", he sounds like the kind of personality-heavy singer indie culture's been hesitant to embrace over the last few years."<ref name="pitchfork_28 February 2012"/> It was listed at number eight on [[Insound]]'s Top Albums of 2012<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.albumoftheyear.org/list/178-insounds-top-10-albums-of-2012.php|title=Insound's Top 10 Albums of 2012|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref> and at number thirty-seven on ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'''s Top 50 Albums of 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.albumoftheyear.org/list/176-under-the-radars-top-50-albums-of-2012.php|title=Under the Radar's Top 50 Albums of 2012|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref>

Soon after the release of the album Postepski left the band to focus on Austra's growing commitments and her own solo project 'Princess Century'.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://exclaim.ca/News/robert_alfons_explains_trusts_evolution_with_joyland_shares_new_tarantula_x_remix |title=Robert Alfons Explains Trust's Evolution with 'Joyland,' Shares New Tarantula X Remix |work=Exclaim! |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Coplan |first=Chris |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/01/listen-trusts-provocative-new-single-rescue-mister/ |title=Listen: Trust's provocative new single, "Rescue, Mister" |publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref>

===2014–2015: ''Joyland''===
[[File:Trust live Durham 2014.JPG|thumb|TR/ST performing at The Pinhook in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] on 15 April 2014]]
''Joyland'' was released on 3 March 2014 by [[Arts & Crafts Records|Arts & Crafts]]. The album received generally favorable reviews. ''[[MusicOMH]]'' gave it a score 4 out of 5, describing the album as doing an "excellent job of sharpening and streamlining Trust’s sound into something even better than that displayed on the debut."<ref name=omh>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/trust-joyland|title=Trust - Joyland|work=[[MusicOMH]]|date=22 April 2014|last=Lee|first=Tim}}</ref> The album debuted at No. 12 on the ''Billboard'' Dance/Electronic Albums chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.billboard.com/album/5931258/joyland|title = Dance/Electronic Albums|website = Billboard}}</ref>
