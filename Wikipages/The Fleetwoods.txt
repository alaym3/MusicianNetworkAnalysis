'''The Fleetwoods''' were an American [[Vocal Group|vocal group]] from [[Olympia, Washington]], United States, whose members were Gary Troxel, Gretchen Christopher, and Barbara Ellis.<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2002|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-937-0|page=143}}</ref>

==Early history==
The band members met as high school students in Olympia, Washington. Originally the band consisted of only Gretchen Christopher and Barbara Ellis, but Gary Troxel was asked to accompany them with jazz trumpet, later switching to vocals.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|title=The Fleetwoods - Music Inductees|url=http://vocalgroup.org/inductees/the-fleetwoods/|access-date=2021-03-15|website=The Vocal Group Hall of Fame|language=en-US}}</ref> They then started performing in 1958 as "Two Girls and a Guy" but later changed the name to the Fleetwoods after the Fleetwood [[telephone exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Fleetwoods' Gretchen Christopher Reflects on Topping the Hot 100 60 Years Ago Today|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506925/the-fleetwoods-gretchen-christopher-come-softly-to-me|access-date=2021-03-15|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref> 

In 1959, they were noticed by producer and [[Dolton Records]] founder Bob Reisdorff  with whom they recorded their self-written first hit "[[Come Softly to Me]]", which was also covered by others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefleetwoods.us/biographies/the-fleetwoods-then-a-now.html|title=Teen Angst and Soft Rock 'n Roll|first=Howard A.|last=DeWitt|website=TheFleetwoods.us|access-date=December 13, 2020}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[Frankie Vaughan]] and [[The Kaye Sisters]] had a Top 10 [[Record chart|chart]] hit in the United Kingdom with the song, though The Fleetwoods exceeded them, simultaneously charting in the UK's Top 5.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

The Fleetwoods continued recording into the 1960s.  They hit the Top 10 again with a remake of [[Thomas Wayne (singer)|Thomas Wayne]]'s "[[Tragedy (Thomas Wayne song)|Tragedy]]" in 1961.<ref name="Larkin50"/>  Though they went on to have a total of eleven hits on the Hot 100, the beginning of the end for the group came when Troxel had to fulfill his obligation to go onto active duty in the [[United States Navy]].  He joined the Naval Reserve in 1956. Additionally, the [[British Invasion]] of the mid 1960s changed the public's taste. The trio's hits ended in 1963 with Barbara Ellis singing melody on "Goodnight My Love".  [[Vic Dana]], who was to go on to a successful solo career,<ref name="Larkin50"/> replaced Troxel in the group when he was in the service, solely for live performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/the-fleetwoods |title=The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=2015-05-29}}</ref>

== Later years ==
By the late 1970s, Troxel was working in a plywood [[Factory|plant]] in Washington, Ellis was managing a trailer park in [[California]] and Christopher was a housewife and modern jazz dance teacher in Washington at St. Martin's College and at The Evergreen State College.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Archive-Frank-Tortorici|title=The Fleetwoods' Gretchen Christopher|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/621585/the-fleetwoods-gretchen-christopher/|access-date=2021-03-15|website=MTV News|language=en}}</ref> Ellis is now retired from performing. In 1983, Troxel gave his written resignation from The Fleetwoods leaving Christopher as manager with the sole authority to contract for both the original and replacement Fleetwoods. Troxel formed a new Fleetwoods group in the 1980s. His group has been performing regularly since the mid 1980s doing several "oldies" concerts each year with two performances on the PBS Doo Wop series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefleetwoods.us |title=The Fleetwoods - The Fleetwoods |publisher=Thefleetwoods.us |access-date=2015-05-29}}</ref>

While Christopher trained replacement Fleetwoods, she also resumed her solo music career, billing herself as "Gretchen Christopher of the Fleetwoods." Both Troxel and Christopher each continue to perform and occasionally release new recordings. A new Fleetwoods version of "Graduation's Here" appeared on Christopher's autobiographical solo album, ''Gretchen's Sweet Sixteen (Suite 16)'', which is one of the 2007 ''Billboard'' critics' picks for 10 Best Albums of the Year. It included both the hit arrangement of "Come Softly To Me" and an [[a cappella]] version, with Christopher singing all the parts.

Since their 1988 induction into the Northwest Area Music Association Hall of Fame, and their 2005 induction into the [[Olympia High School (Olympia, Washington)|Olympia High School]] Alumni Association Hall of Fame, The Fleetwoods have been inducted into both the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] and the Doo-Wop Hall of Fame of America in 2006.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foster|first=James|title=The Fabulous Fifties|publisher=Page Publishing, Inc.|isbn=1634172078}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>

The November 2007 release of ''Gretchen's Sweet Sixteen (Suite 16)'' was launched in Las Vegas with the second Annual Cool Bobby B Doo Wop Convention and Grand Finale Concert, headlined by 'The Fleetwoods starring Gretchen Christopher.'<ref>{{Cite web|last1=August 23|first1=Ron CarsonPublished|last2=2019|title=An Iconic Musical Legend Checks In On The Sat AM Chat|url=https://wsbs.com/an-iconic-musical-legend-checks-in-on-the-sat-am-chat/|access-date=2021-03-15|website=WSBS 860AM, 94.1FM|language=en}}</ref> A year later, though all three originals were inducted and invited to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, Christopher was the only original member of the Fleetwoods who accepted, attended and performed, dedicating songs to each of her absent partners. Troxel had every intention of attending but decided it was more important to be with his wife, because of her breast cancer treatment.

In 2000, Troxel and his wife Jenifer lost ''[[Troxel v. Granville]]'', a landmark grandparents' rights case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The court held that under the [[United States Constitution]], non-parents seeking custody or visitation rights of a child against the wishes of the child's parents must prove that the parents are not acting in the best interest of the child in refusing custody or visitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-138.ZS.html |title=Troxel V. Granville |publisher=Supct.law.cornell.edu |access-date=2015-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Challenging Legal Notion Of 'Family'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-01/09/040r-010900-idx.html|access-date=2021-03-15|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

In 2008 and 2009, Christopher testified before the [[Washington State Senate]] in support of the [[Truth in Music Advertising|Truth in Music Advertising Bill]]. In 2009, it passed both the House and Senate unanimously, and was signed into law by Governor [[Chris Gregoire]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=SB 6577|url=https://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2007-08/Htm/Bill%20Reports/Senate/6577.SBR.htm|access-date=2021-03-15|website=apps.leg.wa.gov}}</ref> The law provides that a performing group shall not be advertised by the name of a recording group, unless the performing group includes from the hit-making recording group at least one original member who is authorized to use the name. That authorization resides solely with Christopher, according to the performance contract and resignation signed by Troxel.
