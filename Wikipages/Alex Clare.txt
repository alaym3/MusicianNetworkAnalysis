==Early life==
Clare was born in [[Southwark]], [[London]], England. He grew up listening to his father's [[jazz]] records and was drawn to [[blues]] and [[soul music|soul]] artists such as [[Donny Hathaway]] and [[Stevie Wonder]], which eventually led to interests in [[drum and bass]], [[dubstep]] and [[UK garage]]. Though he took up the trumpet and drums when he was young, he eventually placed an emphasis on guitar and songwriting, playing [[open mic]] nights with original material.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kellman|first=Andy|title=Alex Clare|url=http://www.pandora.com/alex-clare|publisher=Pandora|access-date=12 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111223904/http://www.pandora.com/alex-clare|archive-date=11 November 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Clare attended [[Bishop Challoner School]] in Bromley and then [[Westminster Kingsway College]] from 2002, studying for an [[National Vocational Qualification]] (NVQ) in [[catering]].

His debut album, ''[[The Lateness of the Hour (album)|The Lateness of the Hour]]'', produced by [[Mike Spencer]] and [[Major Lazer]]<ref name="producer"/> was released in July 2011.

==Personal life==
Brought up in what he has described as a "very, very secular" environment, Clare became a ''[[baal teshuva]]'' to [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the mid-2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thejc.com/arts/arts-interviews/68842/amy-winehouses-ex-alex-clare-hits-big-time |title=Amy Winehouse's ex, Alex Clare, hits the big time | work = The Jewish Chronicle |date=14 June 2012 |access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Schreiber |first=Abby |url= http://www.papermag.com/2012/07/alex_clare_interview.php |title=Alex Clare Talks Hit Single, "Too Close" (And the Commercial That Made It Famous) |publisher = Papermag |date= 23 July 2012 |access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref> As such, he does not perform, travel or work on [[Shabbat]] or on Jewish holidays. He has said that he lost one-record deal opportunity due to this observance,<ref>Tzvi Gluckin. ''Judaism, Sacrifice, and the Education of Alex Clare.'' [http://www.aish.com/sp/so/Judaism-Sacrifice-and-the-Education-of-Alex-Clare.html aish.com] Retrieved 4 September 2014</ref> but has found other ways to continue his career successfully. Clare also keeps a strictly [[kashrut|kosher]] diet, and maintains a schedule of [[Talmud]] study on tour.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title = British pop star balances stardom and Orthodoxy|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/british-pop-star-balances-stardom-and-orthodoxy/|website = The Times of Israel|access-date = 10 November 2015}}</ref> He lost an album deal with [[Island Records]] because he had to turn down a radio concert for BBC in observance of the Succoth holiday in October 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-10-26|title=Alex Clare: The singer who chose his faith over Adele tour|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59007454|access-date=2021-10-27}}</ref>

He lived in [[Golders Green]], an area in northwest London,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=290284|title=British pop sensation balances stardom, Orthodoxy|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}</ref> before moving to [[Jerusalem]] in late 2015 together with his family.<ref name=":2" />
