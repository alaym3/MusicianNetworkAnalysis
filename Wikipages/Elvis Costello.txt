'''Declan Patrick McManus''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 25 August 1954),<ref>His full given name is sometimes inaccurately listed as '''Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus''', including as published in the Birthday Honours List 2019, in which he received his OBE and which is often considered authoritative of such matters, but Aloysius was not one of his names at birth. Costello began using the name "Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus" (or sometimes, "D.P.A. MacManus") in both the writing and production credits of his albums in 1986, although this was largely phased out by the mid-1990s. It has been suggested that Aloysius could be his confirmation name, or that the use of the name Aloysius is a reference to English comedian [[Tony Hancock]], born Anthony John Hancock, who became famous in the UK playing a comic character who went by the name Anthony Aloysius St. John Hancock. <br>In addition, his father's surname was originally McManus 'before my Dad added an ''a'' to make it "MacManus" because it looked posher and better in print'. (See the autobiography ''Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink'', Chapter One, pp. 1-2, Penguin Random House UK, {{ISBN|978-0-241-00346-6}}.)</ref> known professionally as '''Elvis Costello''', is an English singer-songwriter.

Costello began his career as part of London's [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk and new wave movement that emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/20021018elvisrecp1.asp |first=Ed |last=Masley |date=18 October 2002 |title=The Best of Elvis Costello |newspaper=[[Post-Gazette]] |access-date=30 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/139589/Elvis-Costello |title=Elvis Costello |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=25 August 1954 |access-date=30 July 2011}}{{dubious|date=July 2011|We don't usually cite other encyclopedias}}</ref> His critically acclaimed debut album ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' was released in 1977. Shortly after recording it, he formed [[the Attractions]] as his [[backing band]]. His second album ''[[This Year's Model]]'' was released in 1978, and was ranked number 11 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' on its list of the best albums from 1967 to 1987. His third album ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]'' was released in 1979, and features his highest-charting single, "[[Oliver's Army]]" (number 2 in the UK). His first three albums all appeared on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].

Costello and the Attractions toured and recorded together for the better part of a decade, though differences between them caused a split by 1986. Much of Costello's work since has been as a solo artist, though reunions with members of the Attractions have been credited to the group over the years. Costello's lyrics employ a wide vocabulary and frequent [[wordplay]]. His music has drawn on many diverse genres; one critic described him as a "pop encyclopaedia", able to "reinvent the past in his own image".<ref>Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r4598|pure_url=yes}} ''Get Happy!!'' <nowiki>[Ryko Bonus Tracks]</nowiki>], Allmusic. Retrieved 17 September 2007.</ref>  Since 2002, his touring band (featuring a rotating cast of musicians) has been known as The Imposters.  

Costello has co-written several original songs for films, including "God Give Me Strength" from ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'' (1996, with [[Burt Bacharach]]) and "[[The Scarlet Tide]]" from ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' (2003, with [[T-Bone Burnett]]). For the latter, Elvis was nominated (along with Burnett) for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media]].

==Early life==
Declan Patrick MacManus was born on 25 August 1954 at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] in [[Paddington]], London, and is of Irish descent on his father's side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elviscostello.info/articles/r/rolling_stone.820902a.html |title=Interview with Elvis Costello |publisher=elviscostello.info |date=2 September 1982 |access-date=10 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merseysidermagazine.com/site/extras/the-merseyside-roots-of-elvis-costello/ |title=The Merseyside Roots of Elvis Costello |work=Merseysider Magazine |access-date=21 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923054039/http://www.merseysidermagazine.com/site/extras/the-merseyside-roots-of-elvis-costello/ |archive-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is the son of Lilian Alda (''née'' Ablett; 1927–2021)<ref>{{cite web |title=It is with sadness but the acceptance of mercy that I must report the passing of my dear Mam, Lillian MacManus. |url=https://www.elviscostello.com/#!/news/299589 |website=www.elviscostello.com |access-date=20 July 2021}}</ref> and [[Ross McManus|Ross MacManus]] (1927–2011), a jazz trumpeter who sang with the [[Joe Loss]] Orchestra<ref name=NYer2010/> and who later performed as a solo [[cabaret]] act. MacManus senior had a hit in Australia (as Day Costello) with his cover version of [[The Beatles]]' "[[The Long and Winding Road]]" in 1970.

MacManus lived in [[Twickenham]], attending both St. Edmund's Catholic Primary School in nearby [[Whitton, London|Whitton]], and then Archbishop Myers [[Secondary Modern]] R.C. School – which is now [[St Mark's Catholic School, Hounslow|St Mark's Catholic School]] – in neighbouring [[Hounslow]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Inglis |url=http://www.elviscostello.info/biography.php |title=The Rise And Rise of Elvis Costello |publisher=elviscostello.info |access-date=17 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Elvis Costello – Biography |publisher=Tiscali UK Limited trading as TalkTalk |url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/music/biography/artist/elvis-costello/biography/19879 |access-date=6 September 2010}} {{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

In 1971, the 16-year-old MacManus moved with his mother to Birkenhead – not far from her home city of Liverpool – where he formed his first band, a [[folk music|folk]] duo called "Rusty", with Allan Mayes.<ref>[https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/obe-elvis-costello-queens-birthday-16396146 "OBE for Elvis Costello in Queen's Birthday honours list"]. ''Liverpool Echo'', By Alan Weston, 7 June 2019</ref> After completing his education at [[St. Francis Xavier's College (Liverpool)|St. Francis Xavier's College]] in Liverpool, MacManus worked at a number of office jobs to support himself, most famously at [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.|Elizabeth Arden]], where he was employed as a data entry clerk.<ref>[https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/first-video-of-elvis-costello-performing-live-1974/ "Watch the first ever video of Elvis Costello performing live, 1974"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709195210/https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/first-video-of-elvis-costello-performing-live-1974/ |date=9 July 2019 }}. ''Far Out Magazine'', Lee Thomas-Mason, 2 June 2019</ref> This is immortalised in the lyrics of "I'm Not Angry" as the "vanity factory". He also worked for a short period as a computer operator at the [[Midland Bank]] computer centre in [[Bootle]].<ref>[https://www.loudersound.com/features/mop-stars-the-jobs-musicians-did-before-they-got-famous "Mop stars: the jobs musicians did before they got famous"]. ''Louder'', By Felix Rowe 9 November 2019</ref>

He moved back to London in 1974, where he formed a [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] band called Flip City,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/flipcity/flipcity.htm |title=Flip City – the True Story|publisher= Flip City website |access-date=17 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612085247/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/flipcity/flipcity.htm |archive-date=12 June 2009}}</ref> who were active from 1974 until early 1976. Costello's first broadcast recording was with his father in a television commercial for [[R. White's Lemonade]] ("I'm a Secret Lemonade Drinker") which aired in 1974. His father sang the song, and Costello sang backing vocals; the advertisement won a silver award at the 1974 International Advertising Festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britvic.com/our-brands/brands-a-z/r-whites |title=R White's |website=Britvic.com |language=en |access-date=1 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809102732/http://www.britvic.com/our-brands/brands-a-z/r-whites |archive-date=9 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He continued to write songs and began looking for a solo recording contract. He was signed in 1976 to independent label [[Stiff Records]] on the basis of a demo tape. His manager at Stiff, [[Jake Riviera]], suggested that the singer, then calling himself D.P. Costello, start using the first name Elvis.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14418836 Elvis Costello, interview by Terry Gross], ''[[Fresh Air]] from WHYY'', [[NPR]], [[WHYY-FM]], Philadelphia, 28 February 1989 (rebroadcast 14 September 2007). Retrieved 16 September 2007.</ref>

== Career ==
=== 1970s ===
Costello's first single for Stiff was "[[Less Than Zero (song)|Less Than Zero]]", released on 25 March 1977. Four months later, his debut album, ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (1977), was released to moderate commercial success (No.&nbsp;14 in the UK and, later, Top 40 in the US) with Costello appearing on the cover in what became his trademark oversize glasses, bearing some resemblance to [[Buddy Holly]]. Costello failed to chart with his early singles, which included  "Less Than Zero" and the ballad "[[Alison (song)|Alison]]". Stiff's records were initially distributed only in the UK, which meant that Costello's first album and singles were available in the US as imports only. In an attempt to change this, Costello was arrested for [[Street performance|busking]] outside a London convention of [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] executives, protesting that no US record company had yet seen fit to release his records in the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Jones |first=Allan |author-link=Allan Jones (editor) |title=A Day in the Life of a Bunch of Stiffs |magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |date=1 August 1977 |url=http://www.elviscostello.info/articles/m/melody_maker.770801a.html |access-date=12 May 2010 }}</ref> Costello signed to [[Columbia Records]], CBS in the U.S., a few months later.

The backing for Costello's debut album was provided by American West Coast band [[Clover (band)|Clover]], a country outfit living in England whose members would later go on to join [[Huey Lewis and the News]] and [[the Doobie Brothers]]. Costello released his first major hit single, "[[Watching The Detectives (song)|Watching the Detectives]]", which was recorded with [[Steve Nieve]], Steve Goulding (drums) and Andrew Bodnar (bass)—the latter two being members of [[Graham Parker]]'s backing band [[the Rumour]]. The song, added to the U.S. version of ''My Aim Is True'', contains scathing verses about the vicarious enjoyment of TV violence over a reggae beat. Later in 1977, Costello formed his own permanent backing band, [[the Attractions]], consisting of Steve Nieve (piano), [[Bruce Thomas]] (bass guitar), and [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]] (drums; no relation to Bruce Thomas).

[[File:Elvis Costello 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Costello onstage at [[Massey Hall]], Toronto, April 1979]]
On 17 December 1977, Costello and the Attractions, as a replacement act for the [[Sex Pistols]], were scheduled to play "Less Than Zero" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''; however, in imitation of a rebellious act by [[Jimi Hendrix]] on a BBC show, Costello stopped the song mid-intro, yelling "Stop! Stop!" to his band, and played "Radio Radio" instead – a song that criticises the commercialisation of the airwaves, which [[NBC]] and [[Lorne Michaels]] had forbidden them to play.<ref name="SNL"/> Costello was subsequently banned from the show (the ban was lifted in 1989) and he received considerable attention as an angry young man.<ref>{{cite book |author=Larry David Smith |title=Elvis Costello, Joni Mitchell, and the Torch Song Tradition |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=30 April 2004 |page=139 |isbn=9780275973926 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO5hQBVPoOAC&pg=PA139}}</ref> His insistence on performing "Radio Radio" on ''SNL'' proved a boon to his debut album, and its popularity exploded in the U.S. after the performance.<ref name="SNL">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/week-in-rock-history-elvis-costello-defies-saturday-night-live-20111212 "Week in Rock History: Elvis Costello Defies 'Saturday Night Live'"]. ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved 18 September 2014</ref>

Following a tour with other Stiff artists – captured on the ''[[Live Stiffs Live]]'' album, which includes Costello's version of the [[Burt Bacharach]]/[[Hal David]] standard "[[I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself]]" – the band recorded ''[[This Year's Model]]'' (1978). Some of the more popular tracks include the British hit "[[(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea]]" and "[[Pump It Up (Elvis Costello song)|Pump It Up]]". His U.S. record company saw Costello as such a priority that his last name replaced the word Columbia on the label of the disc's original pressing. The Attractions' first tour of Australia in December 1978 was notable for a controversial performance at Sydney's [[Regent Theatre (Sydney)|Regent Theatre]] when, angered by the group's failure to perform an encore after their brief 35-minute set, audience members destroyed some of the seating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elviscostello.com/lies-inventions/page3 |title=Lies and Inventions page 3 |work=official website |publisher=Elvis Costello |access-date=30 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192055/http://www.elviscostello.com/lies-inventions/page3 |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> By the end of the 1970s Costello was firmly established as both performer and songwriter, with Linda Ronstadt and Dave Edmunds having success with his compositions.

A tour of the U.S. and Canada also saw the release of the much-[[bootleg recording|bootlegged]] Canadian promo-only ''[[Live at the El Mocambo (Elvis Costello album)|Live at the El Mocambo]]'', recorded at a Toronto rock club, which finally saw an official release as part of the ''[[2½ Years]]'' box set in 1993.

In 1979, he released his third album ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]'' (originally to have been titled ''Emotional Fascism'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/elvis-costello-repents-249155/|title=Elvis Costello Repents|first1=Greil|last1=Marcus|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2 September 1982}}</ref> a phrase that appeared on the album's inner sleeve). American editions included a 45rpm EP recorded live at the Hollywood High School Gymnasium in Hollywood in 1978. Both the album and the single "[[Oliver's Army]]" went to No.&nbsp;2 in the UK, and the opening track "[[Accidents Will Happen]]" gained wide television exposure thanks to its innovative animated music video, directed by [[Annabel Jankel]] and [[Rocky Morton]]. Costello also found time in 1979 to produce [[Specials (album)|the debut album]] of the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] ska revival band [[the Specials]] and worked as a backing vocalist on ''This Is Your Life'', an album by new wave band Twist.

Costello's standing in the U.S. was bruised for a time when in March 1979, during a drunken argument with [[Stephen Stills]] and [[Bonnie Bramlett]] at a [[Holiday Inn]] bar in [[Columbus, Ohio]], the singer referred to [[James Brown]] as a "jive-ass [[nigger]]", then upped the ante by pronouncing [[Ray Charles]] a "blind, ignorant nigger".<ref>{{cite book |first=Greil |last=Marcus |title=In The Fascist Bathroom |year=1993 |work=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=0-14-014940-6 |page=229}}</ref> Costello addressed the controversy at a New York City press conference a few days later, claiming that he had been drunk and had been attempting to be obnoxious to bring the conversation to a swift conclusion, not anticipating that Bramlett would bring his comments to the press. According to Costello, "it became necessary for me to outrage these people with about the most obnoxious and offensive remarks that I could muster." In his liner notes for the expanded version of ''[[Get Happy!! (Elvis Costello album)|Get Happy!!]]'' Costello writes that some time after the incident he had declined an offer to meet Charles out of guilt and embarrassment, though Charles himself had forgiven Costello, saying "Drunken talk isn't meant to be printed in the paper." Costello worked extensively in Britain's [[Rock Against Racism]] campaign both before and after the incident. In an interview with [[Questlove]] (drummer for [[the Roots]], whom Costello collaborated with in 2013), he stated: "It's upsetting because I can't explain how I even got to think you could be funny about something like that", and further elaborating with, "I'm sorry. You know? It's about time I said it out loud."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Courtney E. |title=Elvis Costello Opens Up About 1979 Racial Slurs in Interview With ?uestlove |url=http://radio.com/2013/10/17/elvis-costello-opens-up-about-1979-racial-slurs-in-interview-with-uestlove/ |website=Radio.com |access-date=10 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916121400/http://radio.com/2013/10/17/elvis-costello-opens-up-about-1979-racial-slurs-in-interview-with-uestlove/ |archive-date=16 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Costello is also an avid country music fan and has cited [[George Jones]] as his favourite country singer. In 1977, he appeared on Jones' duet album ''[[My Very Special Guests]]'', contributing "[[Stranger in the House (song)|Stranger in the House]]", which they later performed together on an [[HBO]] special dedicated to Jones.

===1980s===
The soul-infused ''Get Happy!!'' was the first of Costello's many experiments with genres beyond those with which he is ordinarily associated. It also marked a distinct change in mood from the angry, frustrated tone of his first three albums to a more upbeat, happy manner. The single, "[[I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down]]" was an old [[Sam and Dave]] song (though Costello increased the [[tempo]] considerably). Lyrically, the songs are full of Costello's signature word play, to the point that he later felt he had become something of a self-parody and toned it down on later releases; he has mockingly described himself in interviews as "rock and roll's [[Scrabble]] champion". His only 1980 appearance in North America was at the [[Heatwave (festival)|Heatwave]] festival in August near Toronto.

In January 1981, Costello released ''[[Trust (Elvis Costello album)|Trust]]'' amidst growing tensions within the Attractions, particularly between Bruce and Pete Thomas. In the U.S., the single "Watch Your Step" was released and played live on [[Tom Snyder]]'s ''Tomorrow'' show, and received airplay on FM rock radio. In the UK, the single "[[Clubland (song)|Clubland]]" scraped the lower reaches of the charts; follow-up single "[[From a Whisper to a Scream (song)|From a Whisper to a Scream]]" (a duet with [[Glenn Tilbrook]] of [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]]) became the first Costello single in over four years to completely miss the charts. Costello also co-produced Squeeze's popular 1981 album ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]'' (with [[Roger Bechirian]]) and performed backing vocals on the group's hit "Tempted".

October saw the release of ''[[Almost Blue]]'', an album of country music cover songs written by the likes of [[Hank Williams]] ("Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?)"), [[Merle Haggard]] ("Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down") and [[Gram Parsons]] ("How Much I Lied"). The album, which received mixed reviews,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/how-elvis-costello-outlined-his-future-with-almost-blue-120065/|title=How Elvis Costello Outlined His Future With 'Almost Blue'|first1=Will|last1=Hodge|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=21 October 2016}}</ref> was a tribute to the country music that Costello had grown up listening to, especially George Jones. The first pressings of the record in the UK bore a sticker with the message: "WARNING: This album contains country & western music and may cause a radical reaction in narrow minded listeners." ''Almost Blue'' did spawn a surprise UK hit single in a version of George Jones' "[[Good Year for the Roses]]" (written by [[Jerry Chesnut]]), which reached No.&nbsp;6.

''[[Imperial Bedroom]]'' (1982) had a much darker sound, due in part to the lavish production of [[Geoff Emerick]], famed for engineering several [[The Beatles|Beatles]] records. It remains one of his most critically acclaimed records, but again it failed to produce any hit singles—"[[You Little Fool]]" and the critically acclaimed "[[Man Out of Time]]" both failed to reach the Top 40 in the UK. Costello has said he disliked the marketing pitch for the album. ''Imperial Bedroom'' also features Costello's song "[[Almost Blue (song)|Almost Blue]]", inspired by the music of jazz singer and trumpeter [[Chet Baker]], who would later perform and record a version of the song (on ''Chet Baker in Tokyo'').

In 1983, he released ''[[Punch the Clock]]'', featuring female backing vocal duo ([[Afrodiziak]]) and a four-piece horn section ([[the TKO Horns]]), alongside the Attractions. [[Clive Langer]] (who co-produced with Alan Winstanley), provided Costello with a melody which eventually became "[[Shipbuilding (song)|Shipbuilding]]", which featured a trumpet solo by Baker. Prior to the release of Costello's own version, a version of the song was a minor UK hit for former [[Soft Machine]] founder [[Robert Wyatt]].

Under the pseudonym The Imposter, Costello released "Pills and Soap", an attack on the changes in British society brought on by [[Thatcherism]], released to coincide with the run-up to the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 UK general election]]. ''Punch the Clock'' also generated an international hit in the single "[[Everyday I Write the Book]]", aided by a music video featuring lookalikes of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] undergoing domestic strife in a suburban home. The song became Costello's first [[Top 40]] hit single in the U.S. Also in the same year, Costello provided vocals on a version of the [[Madness (band)|Madness]] song "Tomorrow's Just Another Day" released as a [[B-side]].

Tensions within the band – notably between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas – were beginning to tell, and Costello announced his retirement and the break-up of the group shortly before they were to record ''[[Goodbye Cruel World (Elvis Costello album)|Goodbye Cruel World]]'' (1984). Costello would later say of this record that they had "got it as wrong as you can in terms of the execution". The record was poorly received upon its initial release; the liner notes to the 1995 [[Rykodisc]] re-release, penned by Costello, begin with the words "Congratulations! You've just purchased our worst album". Costello's retirement, although short-lived, was accompanied by two compilations, ''Elvis Costello: The Man'' in the UK, Europe and Australia, and ''[[The Best of Elvis Costello & The Attractions]]'' in the U.S.

In 1985, he appeared in the [[Live Aid]] benefit concert in England, singing the Beatles' "[[All You Need Is Love]]" as a solo artist. (The event was overrunning and Costello was asked to "ditch the band".) Costello introduced the song as an "old northern English folk song", and the audience was invited to sing the chorus. In the same year Costello teamed up with friend [[T-Bone Burnett]] for the single "The People's Limousine" under the moniker of The Coward Brothers. That year, Costello also produced ''[[Rum Sodomy & the Lash]]'' for the Irish punk/folk band [[the Pogues]].

1985 also saw Costello appear in the Alan Bleasdale film [[No Surrender (film)|''No Surrender'']], playing a small role as a very bad stage magician hired to perform at a seedy Liverpool night club on a bleak New Year's Eve.

Growing antipathy between Costello and Bruce Thomas contributed to the Attractions' first split in 1986 when Costello was preparing to make a comeback. Working in the U.S. with Burnett, a band containing a number of [[Elvis Presley]]'s sidemen (including [[James Burton]] and [[Jerry Scheff]]), and minor input from the Attractions, he produced ''[[King of America]]'', an acoustic guitar-driven album with a country sound. It was billed as performed by "The Costello Show featuring the Attractions and Confederates" in the UK and Europe and "The Costello Show featuring Elvis Costello" in North America. Around this time he legally changed his name back to Declan MacManus, adding Aloysius as an extra middle name. Costello retooled his upcoming tour to allow for multiple nights in each city, playing one night with the Confederates, one night with the Attractions, and one night solo acoustic. In May 1986, he performed at [[Self Aid]], a benefit concert held in [[Dublin]] that focused on the chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time.

Later that year, Costello returned to the studio with the Attractions and recorded ''[[Blood and Chocolate (album)|Blood and Chocolate]]'', which was lauded for a [[post-punk]] fervour not heard since 1978's ''This Year's Model''. It also marked the return of producer [[Nick Lowe]], who had produced Costello's first five albums. While ''Blood and Chocolate'' failed to chart a hit single of any significance, it did produce what has since become one of Costello's signature concert songs, "[[I Want You (Elvis Costello song)|I Want You]]". On this album, Costello adopted the alias Napoleon Dynamite, the name he later attributed to the character of the [[emcee]] that he played during the [[vaudeville]]-style tour to support ''Blood and Chocolate''. (The pseudonym had previously been used in 1982, when the B-side single "Imperial Bedroom" was credited to Napoleon Dynamite & the Royal Guard; whether the title of the 2004 film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' was inspired by Costello is disputed). After the tour for ''Blood & Chocolate'', Costello split from the Attractions, due mostly to tensions between Costello and Bruce Thomas. Costello would continue to work with Attraction Pete Thomas as a session musician for future releases.

Costello's recording contract with Columbia Records ended after ''Blood & Chocolate''. In 1987 he released compilation album, ''[[Out of Our Idiot]]'' on his UK label, [[Demon Records]] consisting of B-sides, side projects, and unreleased songs from recording sessions from 1980 to 1987. He signed a new contract with [[Warner Bros.]] and in early 1989 released ''[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]'', which spawned his biggest single in the U.S., the Top 20 hit "[[Veronica (song)|Veronica]]", one of several songs Costello co-wrote with [[Paul McCartney]]. At the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]] on 6 September in Los Angeles, "Veronica" won the MTV Award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video|Best Male Video]].<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/winners-by-category.jhtml 1989 MTV Video Music Awards: Video Vanguard Award] MTV. Retrieved 7 December 2011</ref>

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Costello released ''[[Mighty Like a Rose]]'', which featured the single "[[The Other Side of Summer]]". He also co-composed and co-produced, with [[Richard Harvey]], the [[G.B.H. (soundtrack)|title and incidental music for the mini-series]] ''[[G.B.H. (TV series)|G.B.H.]]'' by [[Alan Bleasdale]]. This entirely instrumental, and largely orchestral, soundtrack garnered a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], for Best Music for a TV Series for the pair.

In 1993, Costello experimented with classical music with a critically acclaimed collaboration with the [[Brodsky Quartet]]<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Juliet Letters (review) |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |date=18 March 1993 |magazine=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-juliet-letters-19930318}}</ref><ref>1993 Review of "The Juliet Letters" by Bradley Smith. Retrieved May 2009{{dubious|date=July 2011|publication not listed, unverifiable}}</ref> on ''[[The Juliet Letters]]''. During this period, he wrote a full album's worth of material for [[Wendy James]], and these songs became the tracks on her 1993 solo album ''Now Ain't the Time for Your Tears''. Costello returned to rock and roll the following year with a project that reunited him with the Attractions, ''[[Brutal Youth]]''. In 1995, he released ''[[Kojak Variety]]'', an album of cover songs recorded five years earlier, and followed in 1996 with an album of songs originally written for other artists, ''[[All This Useless Beauty]]''. This was the final album of original material that he issued under his Warner Bros. contract, and also his final album with the Attractions.

In the spring of 1996, Costello played a series of intimate club dates, backed only by Steve Nieve on the piano, in support of ''All This Useless Beauty''. An ensuing summer and fall tour with the Attractions proved to be the death knell for the band. With relations between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas at a breaking point, Costello announced that the current tour would be the Attractions' last. The quartet performed their final U.S. show in [[Seattle]], Washington on 1 September 1996, before wrapping up their tour in Japan. Costello would still continue to work frequently with Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas; eventually, both would be members of Costello's new back-up band, The Imposters.

To fulfill his contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Costello released a greatest hits album titled ''[[Extreme Honey]]'' (1997). It contained an original track titled "The Bridge I Burned", featuring Costello's son, Matt, on bass. In the intervening period, Costello had served as artistic chair for the 1995 [[Meltdown Festival]], which gave him the opportunity to explore his increasingly eclectic musical interests. His involvement in the festival yielded a one-off live [[Extended play|EP]] with jazz guitarist [[Bill Frisell]], which featured both cover material and a few of his own songs.

In 1998, Costello signed a multi-label contract with [[Polygram Records]], sold by its parent company the same year to become part of the [[Universal Music Group]]. Costello released his new work on what he deemed the suitable imprimatur within the family of labels. His first new release as part of this contract involved a collaboration with [[Burt Bacharach]]. Their work had commenced earlier, in 1996, on a song called "God Give Me Strength" for the movie ''[[Grace of My Heart]]''. This led the pair to write and record the critically acclaimed album ''[[Painted From Memory]]'', released under his new contract in 1998, on the [[Mercury Records]] label, featuring songs that were largely inspired by the dissolution of his marriage to [[Cait O'Riordan]]. Costello and Bacharach performed several concerts with full orchestral backing, and also recorded an updated version of Bacharach's "[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]" for the soundtrack to ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', with both appearing in the film to perform the song. He also wrote "I Throw My Toys Around" for ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'' and performed it with [[No Doubt]]. The same year, he collaborated with [[Paddy Moloney]] of [[The Chieftains]] on "The Long Journey Home" on the soundtrack of the [[PBS]]/[[Disney]] [[The Irish in America: Long Journey Home]] miniseries. The soundtrack won a [[Grammy]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title=1999 Grammy Awards|work=Billboard|date=6 March 1999}}</ref>

In 1999, Costello contributed a version of "[[She (Charles Aznavour)|She]]", released in 1974 by [[Charles Aznavour]] and [[Herbert Kretzmer]], for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'', with [[Trevor Jones (composer)|Trevor Jones]] producing. For the 25th anniversary of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', Costello was invited to the programme, where he re-enacted his abrupt song-switch: This time, however, he interrupted the [[Beastie Boys]]' "Sabotage", and they acted as his backing group for "Radio Radio".

=== 2000s ===
[[File:Elvis Costello 15 June 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Costello performing at Glastonbury, 2005]]
[[File:Elvis costello.jpg|thumb|Costello performing in 2006]]

From 2001 to 2005, Costello re-issued his back catalogue in the U.S., from ''My Aim Is True'' (1977) to ''All This Useless Beauty'' (1996), on double-disc collections on the [[Rhino Records]] label. These releases, which each contained second discs of bonus material, ultimately fell out of print by 2007 after Universal Music acquired the rights to Costello's catalogue. Universal subsequently released new deluxe editions of ''My Aim Is True'' and ''This Year's Model'' with new bonus material of full-length concerts from the time of each album's release. These deluxe editions also fell out of print and Universal has reverted to re-releasing Costello's pre-1987 albums in their original context without bonus material.

In 2000, Costello appeared at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|the Town Hall]], New York, in Steve Nieve's opera ''[[Welcome to the Voice]]'', alongside [[Ron Sexsmith]] and [[John Flansburgh]] of [[They Might Be Giants]]. In 2001, Costello was artist-in-residence at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and wrote the music for a new ballet. He produced and appeared on an album of pop songs for the classical singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]]. He released the album ''[[When I Was Cruel]]'' in 2002 on [[Island Records]], and toured with a new band, the Imposters (essentially the Attractions but with a different bass player, [[Davey Faragher]], formerly of [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]]). He appeared as himself in the "[[How I Spent My Strummer Vacation]]" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

On 23 February 2003, Costello, along with [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Steve Van Zandt]], and [[Dave Grohl]], performed a version of [[the Clash]]'s "[[London Calling (song)|London Calling]]" at the 45th Grammy Awards ceremony, in honour of Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]], who had died the previous December.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/17-bruce-springsteen-collaborations-from-chuck-berry-to-lada-gaga-20110124/london-calling-with-dave-grohl-and-elvis-costello-0751054 |title=Great Bruce Springsteen Collaborations: 'London Calling' With Dave Grohl and Elvis Costello |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=27 September 2015}}</ref> In March, Elvis Costello & the Attractions were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. He announced his engagement in May to Canadian [[jazz]] singer and pianist [[Diana Krall]], whom he had seen in concert and then met backstage at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in Australia. That September, he released ''[[North (Elvis Costello album)|North]]'', an album of piano-based ballads concerning the breakdown of his former marriage, and his falling in love with Krall. Also that year, Costello made an appearance in the television series ''[[Frasier]]'' as a folk singer in the Cafe Nervosa, sending Frasier and Niles on a search for a new coffee bar.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0582393/ "''Frasier'':Farewell, Nervosa"].

On 12 March 2003, Costello filled in for [[David Letterman]] on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' for the evening while Letterman was recovering from an eye infection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elviscostello.info/wiki/index.php/TV_2003-03-12_David_Letterman |title=TV – David Letterman |website=Elviscostello.info |publisher=The Elvis Costello Wiki |date=12 March 2003 |access-date=19 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514124425/http://www.elviscostello.info/wiki/index.php/TV_2003-03-12_David_Letterman |archive-date=14 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The song "Scarlet Tide" (co-written by Costello and T-Bone Burnett and used in the film ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'') was nominated for a [[Academy Awards|2004 Academy Award]]; he performed it at the awards ceremony with [[Alison Krauss]], who sang the song on the official soundtrack. Costello co-wrote many songs on Krall's 2004 CD, ''[[The Girl in the Other Room]]'', the first of hers to feature several original compositions. In July 2004, Costello's first full-scale orchestral work, ''[[Il Sogno]]'', was performed in New York. The work, a ballet after [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', was commissioned by Italian dance troupe Aterballeto, and received critical acclaim from the classical music critics. Performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], the recording was released on CD in September by [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. In September 2004, Costello released the album ''[[The Delivery Man]]'', recorded in [[Oxford, Mississippi]], on [[Lost Highway Records]], and it was hailed as one of his best.

[[File:Elvis Costello - European Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|left|Costello's hand prints on the European Walk of Fame, [[Rotterdam]]]]
A CD recording of a collaboration with [[Marian McPartland]] on her show ''[[Piano Jazz]]'' was released in 2005. It featured Costello singing six jazz standards and two of his own songs, accompanied by McPartland on piano. In November, Costello started recording a new album with [[Allen Toussaint]] and producer [[Joe Henry]]. ''[[The River in Reverse]]'' was released in the UK on the [[Verve Records|Verve]] label the following year in May.

A 2005 tour included a gig at [[Glastonbury]] that Costello considered so dreadful that he said "I don't care if I ever play England again. That gig made up my mind I wouldn't come back. I don't get along with it. We lost touch. It's 25 years since I lived there. I don't dig it, they don't dig me....British music fans don't have the same attitude to age as they do in America, where young people come to check out, say [[Willie Nelson]]. They feel some connection with him and find a role for that music in their lives."<ref name="indep07"/>

After [[Hurricane Katrina]], Costello and Allen Toussaint performed in New York at a series of Hurricane Relief benefit concerts in September 2006.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/12/arts/music/12elvi.html|title=Elvis Costello and Allen Toussaint: A Bouncy Take on the Grim|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=21 September 2013|first=Nate|last=Chinen|date=12 July 2006}}</ref> By week's end, Costello had written "The River in Reverse", performed it with Toussaint and discussed plans for an album with Verve Records executives. The result was Costello's ''The River in Reverse'' which is a collaboration with New Orleanian, Allen Toussaint and recorded with The Crescent City Horns. Costello turned to older songs to reflect the national malaise at the time.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

In a studio recording of Nieve's opera ''[[Welcome to the Voice]]'' (2006, Deutsche Grammophon), Costello interpreted the character of Chief of Police, with [[Barbara Bonney]], [[Robert Wyatt]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and Amanda Roocroft, and the album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the ''Billboard'' classical charts. Costello later reprised the piece on the stage of the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris in 2008, with Sting, [[Joe Sumner]] (Sting's son) and Sylvia Schwartz. Also released in 2006 was a live recording of a concert with the Metropole Orkest at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]], entitled ''My Flame Burns Blue''. The soundtrack for ''[[House (TV series)|House, M.D.]]'' featured Costello's interpretation of "Beautiful" by [[Christina Aguilera]], with the song appearing in the second episode of Season 2.

Costello was commissioned to write a [[chamber opera]] by the Danish Royal Opera, [[Copenhagen]], on the subject of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s infatuation with Swedish soprano [[Jenny Lind]]. Called ''The Secret Songs'', it remained unfinished.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-costello-idUKTRE54E5WH20090515 |title=Elvis Costello Reveals 'Secret' New Album' |agency=Reuters |first=Gary |last=Graff |date=15 May 2009 |work=Billboard}}</ref> In a performance in 2007 directed by [[Kasper Bech Holten]] at the Opera's studio theatre ([[Takkelloftet|Takelloftet]]), finished songs were interspersed with pieces from Costello's 1993 collaborative classical album ''[[The Juliet Letters]]'', featuring Danish soprano Sine Bundgaard as Lind. The 2009 album ''[[Secret, Profane & Sugarcane]]'' includes material from ''Secret Songs''.

On 22 April 2008, ''[[Momofuku (album)|Momofuku]]'' was released on [[Lost Highway Records]], the same imprint that released ''The Delivery Man'', his previous studio album. The album was, at least initially, released exclusively on vinyl (with a code to download a digital copy). That summer, in support of the album, Costello toured with [[the Police]] on the final leg of their [[The Police Reunion Tour|2007/2008 Reunion Tour]]. Costello played a homecoming gig at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on 25 June 2006.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jade|last=Wright |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2008/02/05/elvis-costello-show-at-the-phil-is-sure-to-be-a-classic-100252-20437846/ |title=Elvis Costello Show at the Philharmonic |work=Liverpool Echo |date=5 February 2008 |access-date=10 August 2010}}</ref> and, that month, gave his first performance in Poland, appearing with The Imposters for the closing gig of the [[Lake Malta|Malta]] theatre festival in [[Poznań]].

===Vegetarianism===
A vegetarian since the early 1980s, Costello says he was moved to reject meat after seeing the documentary ''[[The Animals Film]]'' (1982), which also helped inspire his song "Pills and Soap" from 1983's ''Punch the Clock''.<ref name=NYer2010>{{cite magazine |last1=Paumgarten |first1=Nick |date=8 November 2010 |title=Brilliant Mistake: Elvis Costello's boundless career |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |pages=48–59 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/08/101108fa_fact_paumgarten |access-date=22 January 2011 }}</ref> In January 2013, Costello teamed up with [[Paul McCartney]] to create an ad campaign backing vegetarian foods produced by the [[Linda McCartney Foods]] brand.<ref>{{cite news |title=Elvis Costello voices ad for new Linda McCartney vegetarian food range |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/elvis-costello-voices-ad-for-new-linda-mccartney-vegetarian-food-range-8456232.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Adam |last=Sherwin |date=18 January 2013}}</ref>

===Football===
Costello is a keen [[Association football|football]] fan, supporting [[Premier League]] football club [[Liverpool F.C.]] since childhood, and appeared on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Football Italia]]'' as a pundit.<ref name="Isranbul"/> On 25 May 2005, Costello was due to take the stage with his band at a gig in Norwich, which clashed with Liverpool appearing in the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final]] against AC Milan.<ref name="Isranbul">Costello, Elvis (30 May 2005). "Fretting while the scarlet tide make history". ''The Times''.</ref> With Liverpool losing 3–0 at half time, Costello was due on stage and began warming up his voice in preparation for the gig, before deciding: "I might as well see the first few minutes of the second half."<ref name="Isranbul"/> With Liverpool staging a remarkable comeback (since dubbed the ''Miracle of Istanbul'') by scoring three goals in six minutes and making it 3–3, Costello delayed his appearance on stage for over an hour.<ref name="Isranbul"/> With the game going to penalties, after much delay he had no choice but to take the stage, with Costello recalling: "I tried my best to keep my eyes from the TV screen over the bar at the back of the room but the words 'Oh shit, he's missed' might have accidentally crept into the lyrics of 'Good Year for the Roses'".<ref name="Isranbul"/> With Liverpool prevailing while he was on stage, an ecstatic Costello broke out into a performance of the club's anthem "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]".<ref name="Isranbul"/>

=== Health ===
In July 2018, Costello cancelled the remaining six dates of his European tour on doctor's orders, while recovering from surgery to treat cancer.
