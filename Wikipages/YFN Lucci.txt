== Artistry ==

Discussing how he developed his sing-song style in an interview with [[Vice (magazine)#Website|Noisey]], Lucci said; "Growing up, I always had this high-pitched voice. I couldn't ever sing, you feel me, but I had a little high-pitched voice when I talked loud. I used to listen to Ja Rule. I knew how to rap, and I used to write my verses. And if it don't sound right when I rap it, I sing it.  And it'd sound better. I used to let all my friends hear it, and they were like, 'I like that.' I just ran with it. If I can't rap it, I sing it."<ref name="noisey">{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/yfn-lucci-is-making-boss-moves|title=YFN Lucci, Atlanta's Most Likable New Star, Is Making Boss Moves|work=[[Vice (magazine)#Website|Noisey]]|date=October 26, 2016|access-date=December 13, 2016}}</ref>
