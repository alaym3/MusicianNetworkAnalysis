The Heavy released two singles in the last half of 2007. "That Kind of Man", the first single, was released on Don't Touch Recordings and was mixed by Corin Dingley who was the original drummer and co producer of the first album before Ninja Tune discovered them and promptly signed the band, Swaby, Taylor and Dingley.
