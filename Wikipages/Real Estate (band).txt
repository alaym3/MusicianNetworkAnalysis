==History==
===Formation and early years===
Courtney, Bleeker and [[Matt Mondanile]] were childhood friends in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]], [[New Jersey]]. Courtney and Bleeker first met in third grade,<ref name=Iqbal>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/oct/28/real-estate-this-is-definitely-a-growing-up-record|title=Real Estate: 'This is definitely a growing-up record' |last=Iqbal|first=Nosheen|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2014-10-24|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref> and became friends in eighth grade over a mutual interest in [[Weezer]], [[Built to Spill]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]].<ref name=McGovern>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2014/02/real-estate-atlas-interview/|title=The Boys Next Door: Real Estate's Subtle Charms|last=McGovern|first=Kyle|website=Spin.com|date=2014-02-27|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref> When Courtney and Bleeker were students in [[Ridgewood High School (New Jersey)|Ridgewood High School]], Courtney met Mondanile, who was a year above him, while on the school bus. Mondanile was listening to [[The Impossibles (American band)|the Impossibles]] on his [[Walkman]] and asked if Courtney wanted to listen. From there, Courtney became acquainted with Mondanile and his friends, and even auditioned to join the latter's band as a bass player before being rejected in favor of an older kid who had a car.<ref name=McGovern /> Mondanile and Bleeker also took guitar lessons from the same teacher, along with school friend and future Real Estate guitarist Julian Lynch. After lessons, Mondanile would teach Bleeker how to play [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] songs. Meanwhile, Courtney was a proficient bassist who played in the school's jazz band.<ref name=Greenhaus1>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/features/2012/04/05/real-estate-s-wonder-years|title=Real Estate's Wonder Years|last=Greenhaus|first=Mike|website=Jambands.com|date=2012-04-05|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref>

On Courtney's 15th birthday, he organized a show in his parents' back yard, with performances by all of his friends who were in bands. This was the first time that he, Bleeker and Mondanile performed live together.<ref name=Iqbal /> Throughout high school, all three would play in various bands, facilitated by the school's Open Mic Nights.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2010/08/12/129162870/ridgewood-n-j-why-here-why-now|title=Ridgewood, N.J.: Why Here? Why Now?|last=Yenigun|first=Sami|work=NPR|date=2010-08-13|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref>

After graduating from Ridgewood High School, they went their separate ways to study in college. Courtney attended [[The Evergreen State College]] in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; Mondanile attended [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], [[Massachusetts]] where he became involved in the burgeoning local noise scene and started his own recording project which he named [[Ducktails (band)|Ducktails]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journeyofafrontman.com/2014/12/13/on-the-line-with-matt-mondanile-of-real-estate-and-ducktails/|title=On the line with Matt Mondanile of Real Estate and Ducktails|last=Obert|first=Obert|work=Journey of a Frontman|date=2014-12-13|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref> and Bleeker attended [[Bennington College]] in [[Bennington, Vermont|Bennington]], [[Vermont]]. Each would continue writing songs on their own and pass them among each other.<ref name=Fitzmaurice>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9342-real-estate-suburban-dreams/|title=Real Estate: Suburban Dreams|last=Fitzmaurice|first=Larry|website=Pitchfork.com|date=2014-02-27|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref>

During a summer break  while they were in college, Courtney, Mondanile and Bleeker reunited as Lese Majesty, the recording and touring backing band for their high school friend Julian Lynch, with Lynch as the lead singer and guitarist, Courtney on Fender Rhodes piano, Mondanile on bass and Bleeker on guitar. Playing drums was Etienne Pierre Duguay, an acquaintance of Mondanile's in Massachusetts with whom he had formed a band called Predator Vision that was named after watching the movie ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' while listening to a cassette recording of them jamming in the basement of Mondanile's house, high on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]. Lese Majesty recorded an album at Courtney's uncle's house in Maine and embarked on a U.S. tour, though Courtney had to opt out due to still being in college and not having the freedom to tour.<ref name=Greenhaus1 />

Courtney's songs in particular inspired the others to suggest forming another band to perform them. Courtney shared some song ideas with Mondanile over G-chat<ref name=Greenhaus1/> and, when they moved back to Ridgewood in summer 2008, they wrote more songs which formed the basis of what would become Real Estate.<ref name=McGovern /> After recording several songs, they were eventually joined by Bleeker and Duguay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stereogum.com/archives/band-to-watch/band-to-watch-real-estate_047651.html |title=Band To Watch: Real Estate |last=Stosuy|first=Brandon|website=Stereogum.com |date=2009-01-23 |access-date=2014-03-27}}</ref> They would jam in the basement of Courtney's parents' house, and during a night of drinking vodka by the backyard pool, Courtney came up with the bass line for "Suburban Beverage." Bleeker briefly moved to Philadelphia while the others continued developing the band, and when Bleeker asked to rejoin, he took up the bass so that Courtney could play guitar, making it easier for him to sing.<ref name=Greenhaus1 /> Spurred on by the success of local bands [[Titus Andronicus (band)|Titus Andronicus]] and [[Vivian Girls]], they decided to take the band seriously. After lengthy deliberation, they chose the name Real Estate because Courtney was studying to acquire his real estate license at the same time the band started, and even managed to sell his grandmother's house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/interview-real-estate-frontman-martin-courtney-on-touring-with-girls-the-romance-of-the-suburbs-and-selling-his-grandmothers-house-6646346|title=Interview: Real Estate Frontman Martin Courtney on Touring with Girls, the Romance of the Suburbs, and Selling His Grandmother's House|last=Miller|first=Michael E.|work=Village Voice|date=2009-11-16|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref> While rehearsing at Courtney's house, his parents also suggested that they all get real estate licenses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/20/arts/music/realestate-concert.html?_r=0|title=Live Performance and Q&A With the Indie Rock Band Real Estate|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2017-03-20|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref> The band also had the idea of working for Courtney's parents' real estate agency in case their music career didn't achieve success.<ref name=Greenhaus2>{{cite web|url=https://www.relix.com/articles/detail/woods-and-real-estate-a-scene-of-their-own|title=Woods and Real Estate : A Scene of Their Own|last=Greenhaus|first=Mike|website=Relix.com|date=2011-12-19|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref>

The band is influenced by [[the Feelies]], as Real Estate said to Still in Rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2014/04/interview-still-in-rock-real-estate.html |title=Brooklyn based Music Blog: Interview Still in Rock : Real Estate (Breeze Pop) |publisher=Still in Rock |date=2004-02-26 |access-date=2015-12-04}}</ref>

===''Real Estate'', ''Days'', and ''Atlas'' (2009–2015)===
After issuing singles on the Underwater Peoples and [[Woodsist]] labels, the band's 2009 [[Real Estate (album)|self-titled debut]] received critical acclaim, including an 8.5 rating and Best New Music tag from [[Pitchfork Media]].<ref name="pitchfork1">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13703-real-estate/ |title=Real Estate: Real Estate &#124; Album Reviews |website=Pitchfork.com |date=2009-11-17 |access-date=2014-03-27}}</ref> Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] gave the album a normalised rating of 79%, indicating "generally favourable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|title=Metacritic – Real Estate reviews|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/real-estate|website=Metacritic.com|access-date=21 November 2011}}</ref> Tours followed, supporting acts such as [[Girls (band)|Girls]], [[Kurt Vile]], [[Woods (band)|Woods]], and [[Deerhunter]]. In 2010, Real Estate performed at the [[Pitchfork Music Festival]] in Chicago and the [[Primavera Sound Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OlasKoolKitchenOnRadio23RealEstateLivePrimavera2010 |title=Ola's Kool Kitchen on Radio 23 Real Estate Live Primavera 2010 : DJ Ola : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |website=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |access-date=2013-02-01}}</ref> in [[Barcelona]].

In 2011, Real Estate signed with the [[Domino Recording Company]]. After initial recording sessions and prior to signing the deal, the band parted ways with Duguay, not wanting to be legally-bound to the drummer due to his unreliability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2011/10/12/real-estate-jams|title=Real Estate Jams|last=Schnipper|first=Matthew|work=The Fader|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref> Subsequently, the second album, ''[[Days (album)|Days]]'', features one song with Duguay, "Out of Tune," while the rest of the drum tracks were performed by Courtney, Mondanile and Samuel Franklin. For live shows, the band recruited drummer Jackson Pollis, formerly of [[Tiny Masters of Today]], and keyboardist Jonah Maurer, a friend of Mondanile's at [[Buxton School (Massachusetts)|Buxton]] boarding school in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guestofaguest.com/interview/interview-real-estate-band-member-jonah-maurer-talks-the-rise-of-real-estate-and-whats-next-for-the-band|title=Interview: Real Estate Band Member Jonah Maurer Talks The Rise Of Real Estate, And What's Next For The Band|last=Markey|first=Morgan|work=Guest of a Guest|date=2012-08-02|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref><ref name=Fitzmaurice />

The group issued ''[[Days (album)|Days]]'', on October 18, 2011.

===Mondanile's departure and ''In Mind'' (2016–2019)===
[[File:Real Estate Piknik i Parken 2017 (174849).jpg|thumb|Real Estate on stage in 2017]]
On May 25, 2016, the band announced that Julian Lynch had replaced Matt Mondanile, who "will continue to focus his creative energy on Ducktails."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realestatetheband.com/news/2016/5/25/sxfn3lrnqi1r3jl6x252ndkt817c58 |title=A Message From The Band â€" Real Estate the Band |date=2016-05-25 |access-date=2017-04-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630210542/http://www.realestatetheband.com/news/2016/5/25/sxfn3lrnqi1r3jl6x252ndkt817c58 |archive-date=2016-06-30 }}</ref> Regarding Mondanile's departure, Courtney admitted that it was less than amicable. "He didn’t just quit. I mean, there’s more to it. It’s kind of stuff that I don’t necessarily want to talk about. So I don’t know, its just complicated. It’s definitely a little more mutual than I guess what people might think is the case," said Courtney.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hyden|first=Steven|url=http://uproxx.com/music/real-estate-martin-courtney-in-mind/3/|title=Real Estate's Martin Courtney Would Rather You Didn't Describe His Band As 'Chill'|website=Uproxx.com|date=2017-03-17|access-date=2017-04-27}}</ref>

After Mondanile's exit, the band considered recording their fourth album as a four-piece, with an additional guitarist brought in for live shows. While Courtney was in Madison, Wisconsin for a solo show, he met with Lynch, who by then already had several solo albums to his name and had collaborated with the members of Real Estate in various forms since high school in Ridgewood. When Courtney mentioned a vacancy in Real Estate, Lynch offered his services. After Courtney consulted with Bleeker and gained the latter's approval, Lynch officially joined and participated in writing and recording the band's fourth album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Warburton|first=Bob|url=http://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/03/15/guitarist-julian-lynch-newest-member-real-estate/99165282/|title=Guitarist Julian Lynch is newest member of Real Estate|website=NorthJersey.com|date=2017-03-15|access-date=2017-04-28}}</ref>

Regarding the change in guitarists, Courtney said, "Removing Matt from the band definitely changes the equation, but I'm pretty sure I met Julian on the same day I met Matt Mondanile. So this isn't just some new guy; we have a long history with him, too."<ref>{{cite web|last=Carew|first=Anthony|url=http://themusic.com.au/interviews/all/2017/03/13/real-estate-martin-courtney-anthony-carew/|title=On Juggling Two Loves: Music & Family|website=Themusic.com.au|date=2017-03-13|access-date=2017-04-28}}</ref> As for Lynch's contribution to the band's sound, Courtney commented, "He's a very different musician from Matthew, all around. We weren't asking him to join to replace Matthew. We were asking him to join in order to make the band new. He was a friend, yes, but it was an added bonus that he would be pretty different from Matt. So it was exciting for us to see what that meant."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lindsay|first=Cam|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/past-lives-and-future-days-a-conversation-with-real-estate|title=Past Lives and Future Days: A Conversation With Real Estate|website=Noisey.vice.com|date=2017-03-15|access-date=2017-04-27}}</ref>

During the band's Fall 2016 tour, Lynch was unable to participate due to a five-month visit to India from September to February with the purpose of research for his Ph.D dissertation in ethnomusicology.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Julian|url=https://twitter.com/juleslynch/status/757683876600741888 |title=Considering buying an LP via julianlynch.bandcamp.com?
