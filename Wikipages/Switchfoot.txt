According to Jon Foreman, the name "[[Switchfoot (slang)|Switchfoot]]" comes from a surfing term. "We all love to surf and have been surfing all our lives so to us, the name made sense.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1996–2002)===
Switchfoot was founded in 1996 as Chin Up, consisting of Jon Foreman and his brother Tim, along with Chad Butler on drums. After playing a few shows including the Foreman brothers' dad's megachurch [[North Coast Calvary Chapel]] in [[Carlsbad, California]], the band was contacted by music industry veteran [[Charlie Peacock]] and eventually signed to his indie label [[Rethink (record label)|Re:think Records]] under the current moniker, Switchfoot. Re:think went on to distribute the first three Switchfoot albums, ''[[The Legend of Chin]]'', ''[[New Way to Be Human]]'', and ''[[Learning to Breathe (Switchfoot album)|Learning to Breathe]]''. Because Re:think was bought by Christian giant [[Sparrow Records]] before Switchfoot's first release, however, the band's and Peacock's intentions of being marketed outside of the [[Contemporary Christian music]] scene and reaching a wider audience were put on hold. Consequently, the band was mostly marketed to Christian radio and retail outlets early in their careers, a time Jon Foreman has described as when "half of who we were was lost."<ref name="christianitytoday03">

Jon Foreman, Tim Foreman, Chad Butler, Jerome Fontamillas, Drew Shirley 
</ref> Their major label debut, ''The Beautiful Letdown'', under [[Columbia Records]]/[[Red Distribution|Red Ink]], represented the band's evolution from the predominantly [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]], [[indie rock]] sound of their early albums, toward a more layered, synth-influenced sound that helped launch the band to mainstream popularity. This shift sonically could be attributed to the fact that the album was the first to include keyboardist Jerome Fontamillas, formerly of [[Industrial music|industrial]] bands [[Mortal (band)|Mortal]] and [[Fold Zandura]]. Fontamillas had been touring with Switchfoot since 2000, following the release of ''Learning to Breathe''.

''The Beautiful Letdown'' has since been certified double platinum, selling more than 2.6 million copies,<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19341966.html|title=Switchfoot keeps roots, shows crossover appeal|publisher=The Topeka Capital-Journal|first=Phil|last=Anderson|date=October 25, 2008|access-date=January 29, 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> on the strength of constant touring and the huge mainstream radio hits "Meant to Live" and "Dare You to Move". A live DVD depicting one of the band's live concerts, ''[[Live in San Diego (film)|Live in San Diego]]'', went platinum as well, and a third single, "[[This Is Your Life (song)|This Is Your Life]]" was released to radio. In addition, the song "[[Gone (Switchfoot song)|Gone]]" received major airplay on Christian radio stations as well.

Following the runaway success of ''The Beautiful Letdown'', a compilation titled ''[[The Early Years: 1997-2000]]'' was released, which featured Switchfoot's first three indie albums released under Re:think records including the original artwork for all the albums. This collection has since been certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]], with total sales of over 500,000 copies.<ref>[http://wereawakening.blogspot.com/2008/09/switchfoot-early-years-goes-gold.html Switchfoot – "The Early Years" Goes Gold!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181042/http://wereawakening.blogspot.com/2008/09/switchfoot-early-years-goes-gold.html |date=March 3, 2016 }} – Published September 27, 2008 (Retrieved September 28, 2008).</ref>

"Neither party has any hard feelings," he said of the split a few months later. "I think for us, the reason why we signed with Columbia was because of the people that were there.

On May 7, 2021, Switchfoot released "I Need You (To Be Wrong)" as the first single from their twelfth studio album 
''Interrobang''. The album was released on August 20, 2021.<ref>https://fanlink.to/sfineedyoutobewrongpresave</ref>

==Style and influences==
Since Switchfoot's first release in 1997, the band's sound has changed significantly. The style of the early albums with independent label Re:think Records consisted primarily of guitar-driven alternative rock, hard rock with characteristics of a three-man lineup, though they also incorporated string arrangements with slower songs.<ref name="IVMNW2BH">

==Switchfoot and Christian music==
Switchfoot is often referred to as a [[Christian rock]] band; even after having been signed to the mainstream [[Columbia Records]] from 2003–2007, [[Atlantic Records]] from 2008–2016, and currently, [[Vanguard Records]], their albums are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through [[Sparrow Records]]/[[EMI CMG]], their songs are featured on Christian radio and charts, they play at Christian festivals, and they are presented with [[GMA Music Awards|Dove Awards]]. The band has always philosophically disagreed with this label; "We're Christian by faith, not genre," Tim Foreman explained to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 2003.<ref>Miller, Kirk (September 24, 2003). How God, Surfing and Bono Inspired This San Diego band. ''Rolling Stone Magazine''</ref>

Says Jon Foreman, "We've always been very open and honest about where the songs are coming from. For us, these songs are for everyone. Calling us 'Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them, and that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mind—and that's what we want".<ref name="Boston Globe">

"[Signing to Columbia was] a realization of something that we'd wanted to be from the beginning," Foreman explains. "When we were signed to re:think Records [an indie label], the goal was to get the music out to everybody. [But] when Sparrow [a Christian label] bought re:think Records, it was evident that our music wasn't going to be in the hands of everybody. As a Christian, I have a lot to say within the walls of the church. But also, as a Christian, I've got a lot to say just about life in general ... So to be able to be on Columbia ''and'' on Sparrow felt like the realization of the two sides of what we had to say. It's a dream come true to be able to have songs that are outside of the box."<ref name="christianitytoday06">

Following the release of ''The Beautiful Letdown'', the band temporarily stopped playing at Christian festivals and doing interviews with Christian organizations, as they found the speculation about their faith to be distracting from the music. Three years later, they went back to headlining at large Christian-based music festivals, and also agreed to be featured on the June 2006 cover of ''[[CCM Magazine]]'' after declining the opportunity for years.<ref>Swartzendruber, Jay (June 2006). Learning To Breathe. ''CCM Magazine'' Archives. Retrieved 2012-8-2, from [http://ht.salemweb.net/ccm/ccmmagazine/pdf/200606.pdf SalemWeb.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510080122/http://ht.salemweb.net/ccm/ccmmagazine/pdf/200606.pdf |date=May 10, 2012 }}</ref> Yet in many ways they used the opportunity to describe their split from the CCM industry. This has caused some, such as ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' writer Andrew Beaujon, to take the view that "their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning for the rest of us. They try to relate to two different groups of people at once".<ref name="jsonline">
