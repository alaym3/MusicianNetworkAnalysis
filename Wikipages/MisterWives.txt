==History==

===Formation===
MisterWives was formed in late 2012 when lead singer Mandy Lee wanted an 80s cover band for her birthday party. She partnered with fellow musicians Etienne Bowler and William Hehir. Lee met Hehir through a mutual friend, and was introduced to Bowler a short time later.<ref name=pigeonsandplanes>{{cite web|title=Introducing: MisterWives|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2013/05/introducing-misterwives/|website=Pigeons and Planes|publisher=Complex Media|access-date=6 November 2014}}</ref> At the time, the two had been working at restaurants just a block apart in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5930272/misterwives-keeping-busy-on-the-road-ahead-of-recording-debut |title=MisterWives Keeping Busy On The Road Ahead Of Recording Debut Album |publisher=Billboard |date=2013-02-01 |access-date=2015-09-04}}</ref> Eventually the band would expand to its current set-up of five members by bringing Bowler's friends Blum and Campbell (not including the band's saxophonist Mike Murphy), and play its first show as 'MisterWives' (a gender-flipped play on the term for the practice of polygamy, [[Mormonism and polygamy|sister wives]]<ref>[https://play.spotify.com/user/misterwives/playlist/3G7wcQ8bbHW6jgQOuqXgUM]{{dead link|date=September 2015}}</ref>) on February 1, 2013 at the Canal Room in New York City.

===Early career===
The day after playing the Canal Room, the band was signed to [[Photo Finish Records]]. They would spend the better part of that year on tour and making their first EP. The group began touring with [[Half Moon Run]] in October 2013 that ended with a performance at the [[CMJ]] Music Marathon. This was shortly followed by a six-week tour with [[American Authors]] and [[The Royal Concept]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://photofinishrecords.com/artists/misterwives/ |title=MisterWives |publisher=Photo Finish Records |access-date=2015-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905174855/http://photofinishrecords.com/artists/misterwives/# |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> All the while, the group prepared songs for their debut EP, ''[[Reflections (EP)|Reflections]]''.

On December 24, 2013, MisterWives released a [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]] remix of "Coffins" with the [[Pegboard Nerds]] under [[Monstercat]].

===''Reflections EP''===
The band released ''Reflections'' on January 7, 2014. The EP has 6 songs, including the title track, which was iTunes' free Single of the Week for the week of January 6.

In July 2014, "Vagabond" was made the opening theme of the MTV Teen Drama ''[[Finding Carter]]''. Then the band opened for [[Twenty One Pilots]] as part of the ‘Vessel’ tour. They would later go on to open for them again on the ''Banditø'' world tour.
