The group's first album, ''[[Totally Krossed Out]]'', was released in 1992 and went multi-platinum due to their singles "[[Jump (Kris Kross song)|Jump]]" and "[[Warm It Up]]", both written and produced by Dupri. He established his own record label called [[So So Def]] in 1993. Shortly after, he discovered female R&B group [[Xscape (band)|Xscape]] at a festival in Atlanta and signed them to the label.
