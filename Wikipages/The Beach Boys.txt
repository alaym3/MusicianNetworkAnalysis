'''The Beach Boys''' are<!--- "Are" is correct; see the talk page for more information ---> an American [[Rock music|rock]] band that formed in [[Hawthorne, California]], in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], and [[Carl Wilson]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and friend [[Al Jardine]]. Distinguished by their [[vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]], adolescent-oriented themes, and musical ingenuity, they became one of the most influential acts of the rock era. They drew on the music of [[traditional pop|older pop]] [[vocal group]]s, 1950s [[rock and roll]], and black<!--- Quote from Geoffrey Himes: "black R&B was crucial to their sound." There is a notable distinction between the "white" and "black" R&B records of the 1950s, as explained by Carl Wilson: "The black artists were so much better in terms of rock records in those days that the white records almost sounded like put-ons." ---> [[R&B]] to create their unique sound, and under Brian's direction, often incorporated [[classical music|classical]] or [[jazz]] elements and [[Recording studio as an instrument|unconventional recording techniques]] in innovative ways.

One of the first self-contained rock groups, the Beach Boys began as a [[garage band]], managed by the Wilsons' father [[Murry Wilson|Murry]], and with Brian as composer, arranger, producer, and ''de facto'' leader. In 1963, they had their first national hit with "[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]", beginning a [[The Beach Boys discography#1960s|string of top-ten singles]] that reflected a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance, dubbed the "[[California sound]]". They were one of the few American rock bands to sustain their commercial standing during the [[British Invasion]]. Starting with 1965's ''[[The Beach Boys Today!]]'', they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and "[[Good Vibrations]]" single raised the group's prestige as rock innovators. After scrapping the ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' album in 1967, Brian gradually ceded control of the group to his bandmates.

In the late 1960s, the group's commercial momentum faltered in the US, and despite efforts to maintain an [[experimental music|experimental]] sound, they were widely dismissed by the [[Music journalism#20th century rock criticism|early rock music press]]. Carl took over as the band's musical leader; records from this period later enjoyed a [[cult following]] among fans. In the mid-1970s, as their concerts drew larger audiences, the band transitioned into an [[oldies]] act. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Brian soon became estranged from the group. Following Carl's death from lung cancer in 1998, the band granted Love legal rights to [[The Beach Boys (touring band)|tour under the group's name]]. In the early 2010s, the original members briefly reunited for the band's [[The 50th Reunion Tour|50th anniversary]]. {{As of|2021}}, Wilson and Jardine do not perform with Love's edition of the Beach Boys, but remain official members of the band.

The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed and [[List of best-selling music artists|commercially successful bands]] of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. They helped legitimize [[popular music]] as a recognized art form and influenced the development of music genres and movements such as [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], [[power pop]], [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[alternative rock|alternative]], and [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]]. Between the 1960s and 2010s, the group had 36 songs reach the US [[Top 40]] (the most by an American band), with four topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 2004, they were ranked number 12 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|greatest artists of all time]]. The founding members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988. {{toclimit|4}}

==History==
===1958–1961: Formation ===
[[File:Beach Boys Landmark - Plano general I.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beach Boys Historic Landmark|Historical landmark in Hawthorne, California]], marking where the Wilson family home once stood]]

At the time of his 16th birthday on June 20, 1958, [[Brian Wilson]] shared a bedroom with his brothers, [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson|Carl]]{{mdash}}aged 13 and 11, respectively{{mdash}}in their family home in [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]]. He had watched his father [[Murry Wilson]] play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as [[the Four Freshmen]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} After dissecting songs such as "[[Ivory Tower (1956 song)|Ivory Tower]]" and "[[Good News (musical)|Good News]]", Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=12}} For his birthday that year, Brian received a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]]. He learned how to [[overdub]], using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} Brian played piano with Carl and [[David Marks]], an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, playing guitars they had each received as Christmas presents.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=1}}

Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to [[Johnny Otis]]' [[KFRN|KFOX]] radio show.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the [[rhythm and blues]] songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin [[Mike Love]]. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} Later, Brian, Love and two friends performed at [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=5}} Brian also knew [[Al Jardine]], a high school classmate.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=103}} Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. Love gave the fledgling band its name: "The Pendletones", a pun on "[[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]]", a style of woolen shirt popular at the time.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=21}} Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group, and he suggested that the group write songs that celebrated the sport and the lifestyle that it had inspired in [[Southern California]].{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}}{{refn|group=nb|Nick Venet said that none of the members, including Dennis, surfed until after the fact.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=60}}}} Brian finished the song, titled "[[Surfin'|Surfin{{'-}}]]", and with Mike Love, wrote "[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]".{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}} Murry recalled, "They had written a song called 'Surfin{{'-}}', which I never did like and still don't like, it was so rude and crude."{{sfn|Murphy|2015|p=99}}

Murry Wilson, who was a sometime songwriter, arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher Hite Morgan.<ref name=RockHallofFame /> He said: "Finally, [Hite] agreed to hear it, and Mrs. Morgan said 'Drop everything, we're going to record your song. I think it's good.' And she's the one responsible."{{sfn|Murphy|2015|p=99}} On September 15, 1961, the band recorded a demo of "Surfin{{'"}} with the Morgans. A more professional recording was made on October 3, at World Pacific Studio in Hollywood.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=104}} David Marks was not present at the session as he was in school that day.<ref>{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Andy |title=Exclusive QA: Original Beach Boy David Marks on the Band's Anniversary Tour |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-q-a-original-beach-boy-david-marks-on-the-bands-anniversary-tour-20120316 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 16, 2012 |access-date=February 19, 2013}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Since he did not appear on the first performance by the band that would become "the Beach Boys", most historians discount him as a true founding member of the group.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}}}} Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of [[Candix Records]] and [[Era Records]], and he signed the group on December 8.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}} When the single was released a few weeks later, the band found that they had been renamed "the Beach Boys".{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=104}} Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers until [[Russ Regan]], a young promoter with Era Records, noted that there already existed a group by that name. He suggested calling them the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Murphy|2015|p=117}} "Surfin{{'"}} was a regional success for the West Coast, and reached number 75 on the national [[Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It was so successful that the number of unpaid orders for the single bankrupted Candix.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=104}}

===1962–1967: Peak years ===
==== ''Surfin' Safari'', ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', ''Surfer Girl'', and ''Little Deuce Coupe''====
[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|right|The Beach Boys, in [[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]] outfits, performing at a local high school, late 1962]]
By this time the de facto manager of the Beach Boys, Murry landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]].{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}} In their earliest public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts that local surfers favored{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=19}} before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=187}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=106}} In early 1962, Morgan requested that some of the members add vocals to a couple of instrumental tracks that he had recorded with other musicians. This led to the creation of the short-lived group Kenny & the Cadets, which Brian led under the pseudonym "Kenny". The other members were Carl, Jardine, and the Wilsons' mother Audree.<ref name="Kenny"/>{{refn|group=nb|The only songs the group recorded were two Morgan compositions, "Barbie" and "What Is a Young Girl Made Of?"<ref name="Kenny">{{cite web|author-link=Richie Unterberger|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Kenny & the Cadets |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kenny-the-cadets-mn0000070397|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>}} In February, Jardine left the Beach Boys to study dentistry and was replaced by David Marks.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}} Murry remembered that after "Surfin{{'"}}, the group had a difficult time being picked up by another label; "they [all] thought [the group was] a one-shot record."<ref name="Nolan2">{{cite news |last1=Nolan |first1=Tom |title=Beach Boys: A California Saga, Part II |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beach-boys-a-california-saga-part-ii-19711111 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 11, 1971}}</ref>

After being turned down by [[Dot Records|Dot]] and [[Liberty Records|Liberty]], the Beach Boys signed a seven-year contract with [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="photobucket13">{{cite magazine |url=http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q476/marcus1970/hit%20parader%201966/HitParaderp6October1966.jpg|title=The Beach Boy Empire|last=Taylor|first=Derek|date=October 5, 1966|magazine=Hit Parader|page=13|author-link=Derek Taylor}}</ref> This was at the urging of Capitol executive and staff producer [[Nick Venet]] who signed the group, seeing them as the "teenage gold" he had been scouting for.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=62}} On June 4, 1962, the Beach Boys debuted on Capitol with their second single, "Surfin' Safari" backed with "409". The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'', which praised Love's lead vocal and said the song had potential.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=June 9, 1962 |title=Reviews of New Singles |magazine=Billboard Magazine |volume= 74 |issue= 23 |page=40  |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ|page=4}} |access-date=April 27, 2013}}</ref> "Surfin' Safari" rose to number 14 and found airplay in New York and Phoenix, a surprise for the label.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}}

The Beach Boys completed their first album, ''[[Surfin' Safari]]'', with production credited to Nick Venet. Carl later denied that Venet had any significant role in the group's early music, saying that Venet "would be in the booth, and he would call the take number, and that was about it. I wouldn't call him a musical heavy by any ... Brian didn't want anything to do with Venet."<ref name="Nolan2" /> ''Surfin' Safari'', released in October 1962, was different from other rock albums of the time in that it consisted almost entirely of original songs, primarily written by Brian with Mike Love and friend [[Gary Usher]].{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}} Another unusual feature of the Beach Boys was that, although they were marketed as "surf music", their repertoire bore little resemblance to the music of other surf bands, which was mainly instrumental and incorporated heavy use of [[spring reverb]]. For this reason, some of the Beach Boys' early local performances had young audience members throwing vegetables at the band, believing that the group were poseurs.<ref name="Emami">{{cite news |last1=Emami |first1=Gazelle |title=Surf Music Evolution: From The Beach Boys To Punk |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/surf-music-evolution_n_3322063 |work=[[HuffPost]] |date=December 6, 2017}}</ref>

In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten single, "[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts. It was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use [[double tracking]] on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=32}} The [[Surfin' U.S.A.|album of the same name]] followed in March and reached number 2 on the ''Billboard'' charts.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p={{page needed|date=May 2018}}}} Its success propelled the group into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze,{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}} albeit the Beach Boys' vocal approach to the genre, not the original instrumental style pioneered by [[Dick Dale]].<ref name="Emami"/>  Biographer Luis Sanchez highlights the "Surfin' U.S.A." single as a turning point for the band, "creat[ing] a direct passage to California life for a wide teenage audience ... [and] a distinct Southern California sensibility that exceeded its conception as such to advance right to the front of American consciousness."{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=10, 13}}

Throughout 1963, and for the next few years, Brian produced a variety of singles for outside artists. Among these were [[the Honeys]], a surfer trio that comprised sisters Diane and [[Marilyn Wilson|Marilyn Rovell]] with cousin Ginger Blake. Brian was convinced that they could potentially be a successful female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and he produced a number of singles for them, although they could not replicate the Beach Boys' popularity.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=39–41, 44}} He also attended some of [[Phil Spector]]'s sessions at [[Gold Star Studios]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=50}} His creative and songwriting interests were revamped upon hearing [[the Ronettes]]' 1963 song "[[Be My Baby]]", which was produced by Spector. The first time he heard the song was while driving, and was so overwhelmed that he had to pull over to the side of the road and analyze the chorus.{{sfn|Wilson|Greenman|2016|p=73}} Later, he reflected: "I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song."{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=47}}

''Surfer Girl'' marked the first time the group used outside musicians on a substantial portion of an LP.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=107}} Many of them were the musicians Spector used for his [[Wall of Sound]] productions.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=111}} To close 1963, the band released a standalone Christmas-themed single, "[[Little Saint Nick]]", backed with an [[a cappella]] rendition of the [[Lord's Prayer|scriptural]] song "[[The Lord's Prayer (1935 song)|The Lord's Prayer]]". The A-side peaked at No. 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Christmas chart.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=45}}

====British Invasion, ''Shut Down'', ''All Summer Long'', and ''Christmas Album'' ====
The surf music craze, along with the careers of nearly all surf acts, was slowly replaced by the [[British Invasion]].{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|pp=1313–1314}} Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the Beach Boys returned home to face their new competition, [[the Beatles]]. Both groups shared the same record label in the US, and Capitol's support for the Beach Boys immediately began waning. This caused Murry to fight for the band at the label more than before, often visiting their offices without warning to "twist executive arms".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=50}} Carl said that Phil Spector "was Brian's favorite kind of rock; he liked [him] better than the early Beatles stuff. He loved the Beatles' later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it."<ref name=HimesSurf/> According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles closer than anyone else in the band, while Brian was the most "rattled" by the Beatles and felt tremendous pressure to "keep pace" with them.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=88, 104, 184}} For Brian, the Beatles ultimately "eclipsed a lot [of what] we'd worked for ... [they] eclipsed the whole music world."{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=52}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=70}}{{refn|group=nb|He remembered "flipping out [over the Beatles]. I couldn't understand how a group could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, '[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but the[ir fans] just screamed at it. ... It got us off our asses in the studio.

[[File:Sullivan Beach Boys.jpg|thumb|right|Performing "[[I Get Around]]" on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in September 1964 ]]

Brian wrote his last surf song in April 1964.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=51}} That month, during recording of the single "[[I Get Around]]", Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. He remained in close contact with the group and attempted to continue advising on their career decisions.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=112–113}}  When "I Get Around" was released in May, it would climb to No. 1 in the US and Canada, their first single to do so (also reaching the Top 10 in Sweden and the UK), proving that the Beach Boys could compete with contemporary British pop groups.{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|p=42}} In July, the album that the song appeared on, ''[[All Summer Long (album)|All Summer Long]]'', reached No. 4 in the US. ''All Summer Long'' introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys' sound exemplified by the [[piccolo]]s and [[xylophone]]s of [[All Summer Long (The Beach Boys song)|its title track]].{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=110}} The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|pp=72–73}} Before this, a live album, ''[[Beach Boys Concert]]'', was released in October to a four-week chart stay at No. 1, containing a set list of previously recorded songs and covers that they had not yet recorded.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}

In June 1964, Brian recorded the bulk of ''[[The Beach Boys' Christmas Album]]'' with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with [[The Four Freshmen|Four Freshmen]] arranger [[Dick Reynolds (musician)|Dick Reynolds]]. The album was a response to Phil Spector's ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector|A Christmas Gift for You]]'' (1963). Released in December, the Beach Boys' album was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs, and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=59–60}} It would be regarded as one of the finest [[holiday album]]s of the rock era.{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|p=42}} One single from the album, "[[The Man with All the Toys]]", was released, peaking at No. 6 on the US ''Billboard'' Christmas chart.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=75}} On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]'', a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=30–31}}

====''Today!'', ''Summer Days'', and ''Party!''====
By the end of 1964, the stress of road travel, writing, and producing became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a [[panic attack]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=63–64}} In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, session musician [[Glen Campbell]] served as Brian's temporary replacement in concert.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=77, 79}} Carl took over as the band's musical director onstage.<ref name="Jarnow15" />{{refn|group=nb|Contracts at that time stipulated that promoters hire "Carl Wilson plus four other musicians".<ref name="Jarnow15" /> Additionally, in February, July, and October, Brian rejoined the live group for one-off occasions.<ref name=GIGS65>{{cite web|last1=Doe|first1=Andrew G.

Released in March 1965, ''[[The Beach Boys Today!]]'' marked the first time the group experimented with the "album-as-art" form. The tracks on side one feature an uptempo sound that contrasts side two, which consists mostly of emotional ballads.<ref name="Bolin2012" /> Music writer Scott Schinder referenced its "[[suite (music)|suite-like structure]]" as an early example of the [[Album Era|rock album format]] being used to make a cohesive artistic statement.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=111}} Brian also established his new lyrical approach toward the autobiographical; journalist [[Nick Kent]] wrote that the subjects of Brian's songs "were suddenly no longer simple happy souls harmonizing their sun-kissed innocence and dying devotion to each other over a honey-coated backdrop of surf and sand. Instead, they'd become highly vulnerable, slightly neurotic and riddled with telling insecurities."{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=13}} In the book ''Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop'', [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]] remarked that "Brian was aiming for [[Johnny Mercer]] but coming up [[indie rock|proto-indie]]."{{sfn|Stanley|2013|pp=219–220}}  In 2012, the album was voted 271 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-beach-boys-the-beach-boys-today-20120524 |title= 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: The Beach Boys, 'The Beach Boys Today' |work=Rolling Stone |date=May 31, 2012 |access-date= August 12, 2012}}</ref>

In April 1965, Campbell's own career success pulled him from touring with the group. [[Columbia Records]] staff producer [[Bruce Johnston]] was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio, beginning with the June 4 vocal sessions for "[[California Girls]]", which first appeared in the band's next album ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)]]'' and eventually charted at number three in the US while the album went to number two. The album also included a reworked arrangement of "[[Help Me, Rhonda]]" which became the band's second number one US single in the spring of 1965.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=111–112}}

To appease Capitol's demands for a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, Brian conceived ''[[Beach Boys' Party!]]'', a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]", and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier songs.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}} The album was an early precursor of the "[[MTV Unplugged|unplugged]]" trend. It included a cover of [[The Regents (doo-wop band)|the Regents]]' song "[[Barbara Ann]]" which unexpectedly reached number two when released several weeks later.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=113}} In November, the group released another top-twenty single, "[[The Little Girl I Once Knew]]". It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}} The single continued Brian's ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=59}} It was the band's second single not to reach the US top ten since their 1962 breakthrough, peaking at number 20.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-beach-boys/chart-history/hsi/|title=The Beach Boys The Little Girl I Once Knew Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=March 13, 2018}}</ref> According to Luis Sanchez, in 1965, Bob Dylan was "rewriting the rules for pop success" with his music and image, and it was at this juncture that Wilson "led The Beach Boys into a transitional phase in an effort to win the pop terrain that had been thrown up for grabs."{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=76}}

For ''Pet Sounds'', Brian desired to make "a complete statement", similar to what he believed the Beatles had done with their newest album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', released in December 1965.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=44}} Brian was immediately enamored with the album, given the impression that it had no [[Filler (media)|filler tracks]], a feature that was mostly unheard of at a time when 45&nbsp;rpm singles were considered more noteworthy than full-length LPs.{{sfn|Fusilli|2005|p=80}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=114}} He later said: "It didn't make me want to copy them but to be as good as them.

Released on May 16, 1966, ''Pet Sounds'' was widely influential and raised the band's prestige as an innovative rock group.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}} Early reviews for the album in the US ranged from negative to tentatively positive, and its sales numbered approximately 500,000 units, a drop-off from the run of albums that immediately preceded it.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=85}} It was assumed that Capitol considered ''Pet Sounds'' a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience upon which the Beach Boys had built their commercial standing.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=47}} Within two months, the label capitulated by releasing the group's first [[greatest hits]] compilation, ''[[Best of the Beach Boys]]'', which was quickly certified gold by the [[RIAA]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=85–86}} By contrast, ''Pet Sounds'' met a highly favorable critical response in Britain, where it reached number 2 and remained among the top-ten positions for six months.{{sfn|Gillett|1984|p=329}} Responding to the hype, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' ran a feature in which many pop musicians were asked whether they believed that the album was truly revolutionary and [[progressive music|progressive]], or "as sickly as peanut butter".

In its evaluation of ''Pet Sounds'', the book ''101 Albums that Changed Popular Music'' (2009) calls it "one of the most innovative recordings in rock", and states that it "elevated Brian Wilson from talented bandleader to studio genius".{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=38}} In 1995, a panel of numerous musicians, songwriters and producers assembled by ''Mojo'' voted ''Pet Sounds'' the greatest record ever made.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=115}} [[Paul McCartney]] frequently spoke of his affinity with the album, citing "God Only Knows" as his favorite song of all time, and crediting it with furthering his interest in devising melodic bass lines.<ref name="McCartney1997">{{cite AV media notes |first=David |last=Leaf |author-link=David Leaf |chapter=The Observers: Paul McCartney |title=The Pet Sounds Sessions |others=The Beach Boys |year=1997 |publisher=[[Capitol Records]] |type=Booklet|chapter-url=http://albumlinernotes.com/George_Martin_Comments.html}}</ref><ref name="Martin1997">{{cite AV media notes |chapter=The Observers: George Martin |title=The Pet Sounds Sessions |others=The Beach Boys |year=1997 |publisher=[[Capitol Records]] |type=Booklet|chapter-url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Paul_McCartney_Comments.html}}</ref> He said that ''Pet Sounds'' was the primary impetus for the Beatles' 1967 album ''[[Sgt.

==== "Good Vibrations" and ''Smile''====
Throughout the summer of 1966, Brian concentrated on finishing the group's next single, "[[Good Vibrations]]".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=5}} Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, he limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or "modules"). Through the method of [[tape splicing]], each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time.<ref name="ARP"/> Coming at a time when pop singles were usually recorded in under two hours, it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, with sessions for the song stretching over several months in four major Hollywood studios. It was also the most expensive single ever recorded to that point, with production costs estimated to be in the tens of thousands.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41–46}}{{refn|group=nb|In contemporary advertisements, its productions costs were placed at $10,000.{{sfn|Priore|1995|p=245}} one reported estimate is $50,000.

[[File:Van Dyke Parks 1967.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Van Dyke Parks]], Brian's lyricist and collaborator for the unfinished album ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'']]

In the midst of "Good Vibrations" sessions, Wilson invited session musician and songwriter [[Van Dyke Parks]] to collaborate as lyricist for the Beach Boys' next album project, soon titled ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''. Parks agreed.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=129}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=114}} Wilson and Parks intended ''Smile'' to be a continuous suite of songs linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated on the major songs' musical themes.{{sfn|Williams|2010|pp=94–98}} It was explicitly American in style and subject, a conscious reaction to the overwhelming British dominance of popular music at the time.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=117}} Some of the music incorporated chanting, cowboy songs, explorations in Indian and Hawaiian music, jazz, classical [[tone poem]]s, cartoon sound effects, ''[[musique concrète]]'', and yodeling.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Sean|title=The Once and Future King: 'SMiLE' and Brian Wilson's Very American Dream|url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/161935-the-once-and-future-king-smile-and-brian-wilsons-very-american-dream/|website=Popmatters|access-date=July 17, 2014|date=August 28, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' writer [[Jules Siegel]] recalled that, on one October evening, Brian announced to his wife and friends that he was "writing a teenage symphony to God".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=101}}

Recording for ''Smile'' lasted about a year, from mid-1966 to mid-1967, and followed the same modular production approach as "Good Vibrations".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=390}} Concurrently, Wilson planned many different multimedia side projects, such as a sound effects collage, a comedy album, and a "health food" album.<ref name="Nolan1971">{{cite magazine|last=Nolan|first=Tom|title=The Beach Boys: A California Saga|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 28, 1971|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-beach-boys-a-california-saga-19711028|issue=94|access-date=May 13, 2018|archive-date=July 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718092340/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-beach-boys-a-california-saga-19711028|url-status=dead}}</ref> Capitol did not support all these ideas, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, [[Brother Records]]. According to biographer [[Steven Gaines]], Wilson employed his newfound "best friend" [[David Anderle]] as head of the label.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=164}}

Throughout 1966, [[EMI]] flooded the UK market with previously unreleased Beach Boys albums, including ''Beach Boys' Party!'', ''The Beach Boys Today!'' and ''Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!)'',{{sfn|Savage|2015|p=476}} and ''Best of the Beach Boys'' was number two there for several weeks at the end of the year.<ref name="Mawer/OCC">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217020406/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/album_chart_history_1966.php|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/album_chart_history_1966.php|first=Sharon|last=Mawer|title=Album Chart History: 1966|publisher=[[Official Charts Company|The Official UK Charts Company]]|date=May 2007|archive-date=December 17, 2007|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref> Over the final quarter of 1966, the Beach Boys were the highest-selling album act in the UK, where for the first time in three years American artists broke the chart dominance of British acts.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Andrews |first1=Grame |date=March 4, 1967 |title=Americans Regain Rule in England |magazine=Billboard|volume=79 |issue=9 |pages=1, 10 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=CykEAAAAMBAJ |page=1}} |access-date=April 27, 2013}}</ref> In 1971, ''[[New York (magazine)|Cue]]'' magazine wrote that, from mid-1966 to late 1967, the Beach Boys "were among the vanguard in practically every aspect of the counter culture".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Pet Sounds|magazine=Cue|date=1971|volume=40|issue=27|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EwgwAQAAIAAJ}}}}</ref>

Released on October 10, 1966, "Good Vibrations" was the Beach Boys' third US number-one single, reaching the top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in December, and became their first number one in Britain.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=155-156}} That month, the record was their first single certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=86}} It came to be widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}} In December 1966, the Beach Boys were voted the top band in the world in the ''NME''{{'}}s annual readers' poll, ahead of the Beatles, [[the Walker Brothers]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[the Four Tops]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=86–87}}

Throughout the first half of 1967, the album's release date was repeatedly postponed as Brian tinkered with the recordings, experimenting with different takes and mixes, unable or unwilling to supply a final version. Meanwhile, he suffered from delusions and paranoia, believing on one occasion that the would-be album track "[[The Elements: Fire|Fire]]" caused a building to burn down.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=118}} On January 3, 1967, Carl Wilson refused to be drafted for military service, leading to indictment and criminal prosecution, which he challenged as a [[conscientious objector]].<ref name="CW">{{cite web |url=http://reasonabledoubt.org/index.php/criminallawblog/entry/january-3-1967-beach-boy-carl-wilson-becomes-draft-dodger-today-in-crime-history |title=January 3, 1967, Beach Boy Carl Wilson Becomes a Draft Dodger – Today in Crime History |last=Buchanan |first=Michael |date=January 2, 2012 |access-date=August 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225084530/http://reasonabledoubt.org/index.php/criminallawblog/entry/january-3-1967-beach-boy-carl-wilson-becomes-draft-dodger-today-in-crime-history |archive-date=February 25, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The FBI arrested him in April,{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=100}} and it took several years for courts to resolve the matter.<ref name="MF1976">{{cite magazine|title=The Beach Boys|magazine=Music Favorites|volume=1|issue=2|date=1976}}</ref>

After months of recording and media hype, ''Smile'' was shelved for personal, technical, and legal reasons.{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2017|pp=xiv, 60–63, 77–78}} A February 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|255000|1967|end_year={{Inflation-year|US}}}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) was launched against [[Capitol Records]] over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit was an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=170, 178, 243}} Many of Wilson's associates, including Parks and Anderle, disassociated themselves from the group by April 1967.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=120}} Brian later said: "Time can be spent in the studio to the point where you get so next to it, you don't know where you are with it—you decide to just chuck it for a while."<ref name="An American Band">{{cite AV media | people = Leo, Malcolm (Director) | year=1985 | title =[[The Beach Boys: An American Band]]| medium =Documentary}}</ref>

In May 1967, the Beach Boys attempted to tour Europe with four extra musicians brought from the US, but were stopped by the British musicians' union.

It was met with general confusion and underwhelming reviews, and in the ''NME'', [[Jimi Hendrix]] famously dismissed it as a "psychedelic barbershop quartet".

The Beach Boys immediately recorded a new album, ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'', an excursion into [[soul music]].

====''Friends'', ''20/20'', and Manson affair====
The Beach Boys were at their lowest popularity in the late 1960s, and their cultural standing was especially worsened by their public image, which remained incongruous with their peers' "heavier" music.<ref name="Christgau1975">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=June 23, 1975|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/chicago-75.php|title=Beach Boys at Summer's End|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=September 14, 2018}}</ref> At the end of 1967, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' co-founder and editor [[Jann Wenner]] printed an influential article that denounced the Beach Boys as "just one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles.

After meeting [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at a [[UNICEF]] Variety Gala in Paris, Love and other high-profile celebrities such as the Beatles and [[Donovan]] traveled to [[Rishikesh]], India, in February–March 1968. The following Beach Boys album, ''[[Friends (The Beach Boys album)|Friends]]'', had songs influenced by the [[Transcendental Meditation]] the Maharishi taught. In support of ''Friends'', Love arranged for the Beach Boys to [[The Beach Boys' 1968 US tour with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|tour with the Maharishi in the U.S.]]. Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was canceled when the Maharishi withdrew to fulfill film contracts. Because of disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's withdrawal, 24 tour dates were canceled at a cost estimated at $250,000.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=196}} ''Friends'', released on June 24, peaked at number 126 in the US.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=120}} In August, Capitol issued a collection of Beach Boys backing tracks, ''[[Stack-o-Tracks]]''. It was the first Beach Boys LP that failed to chart in the US and UK.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=120–121}}

[[File:Dennis Wilson in 1966.png|thumb|Dennis in 1966]]

In June 1968, Dennis befriended [[Charles Manson]], an aspiring singer-songwriter, and their relationship lasted for several months. Dennis bought him time at Brian's home studio, where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|pp=168–70, 340}}{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=202, 208}} Dennis then proposed that Manson be signed to Brother Records. Brian reportedly disliked Manson, and a deal was never made.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=168}} In July 1968, the group released a standalone single, "[[Do It Again (The Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]", in the style of their earlier songs. Around this time, Brian admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital; his bandmates wrote and produced material in his absence.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=140-141}} Released in January 1969, the album ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' consisted mostly of outtakes and leftovers from recent albums; Brian produced virtually none of the newer recordings.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=213}}

The Beach Boys recorded one song by Manson without his involvement: "Cease to Exist", rewritten as "[[Never Learn Not to Love]]", which was included on ''20/20''.  As [[Manson Family|his cult of followers]] took over Dennis's home, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=224}} According to Leaf, "The entire Wilson family reportedly feared for their lives."{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=137}}

In August, the Manson Family committed the [[Tate–LaBianca murders]]. According to Jon Parks, the band's tour manager, it was widely suspected in the Hollywood community that Manson was responsible for the murders, and it had been known that Manson had been involved with the Beach Boys, causing the band to be viewed as pariahs for a time.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Tom|title=Chaos: Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG92DwAAQBAJ|year=2019|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-47757-4}}</ref> In November, police apprehended Manson, and his connection with the Beach Boys received media attention. He was later convicted for several counts of murder and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to murder.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=219}}

====Selling of the band's publishing====
{{Further|Sea of Tunes}}
In April 1969, the band revisited its 1967 lawsuit against Capitol after it alleged an audit revealed the band was owed over $2 million for unpaid royalties and production duties.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=221}} In May, Brian told the music press that the group's funds were depleted to the point that it was considering filing for bankruptcy at the end of the year, which ''[[Disc & Music Echo]]'' called "stunning news" and a "tremendous shock on the American pop scene". Brian hoped that the success of a forthcoming single, "[[Break Away (The Beach Boys song)|Break Away]]", would mend the financial issues.<!-- <ref name="May69"/> -->{{Citation needed|reason=ref name May69 not defined.|date=December 2018}} The song, written and produced by Brian and Murry, reached number 63 in the US and number 6 in the UK,{{sfn|Badman|2004}} and Brian's remarks to the press ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with [[Deutsche Grammophon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=149}} The group's Capitol contract expired two weeks later with one more album still due,{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=238}} after which the label deleted the Beach Boys' catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=221}} The lawsuit was later settled in their favor and they acquired the rights to their post-1965 catalog.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=}}

In August, [[Sea of Tunes]], the Beach Boys' catalog, was sold to Irving Almo Music for $700,000 (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|700000|1969|end_year={{Inflation-year|US}}}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}).{{sfn|Love|2016|p=226}} According to his wife, [[Marilyn Wilson]], Brian was devastated by the sale.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=224–225}} Over the years, the catalog generated more than $100 million in publishing royalties, none of which Murry or the band members ever received.{{sfn|Love|2016|p=227}}

===1970–1978: Reprise era===

====''Sunflower'' and ''Surf's Up''====
The group was signed to [[Reprise Records]] in 1970.<ref name="allmusic" /> Scott Schinder described the label as "probably the hippest and most artist-friendly major label of the time."{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=121–122}} The deal was brokered by Van Dyke Parks, who was then employed as a multimedia executive at [[Warner Music Group]]. Reprise's contract stipulated Brian's proactive involvement with the band in all albums.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=150}} By the time the Beach Boys' tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music.<ref>{{cite magazine| date=November 14, 1970 |title=The Best Kept Secret in the World: "The Most Dynamic Vocal Group Rock Has Produced" |magazine=Billboard Magazine |volume= 82 |issue= 46 |page=4 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ|page=4}} |access-date=April 27, 2013}}</ref>

After recording over 30 different songs and going through several album titles, their first LP for Reprise, ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'', was released on August 31, 1970.<ref name="White2000">{{cite AV media notes| title = Sunflower/Surf's Up | others= The Beach Boys| year = 2000| first = Timothy| last = White|author-link=Timothy White (editor)|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=CD Liner|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Sunflower_Surf_s_Up.html}}</ref> ''Sunflower'' featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=73}} Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of ''Sunflower'''s 12 songs and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=153–154}} The album received critical acclaim in both the US and the UK.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=153}} This was offset by the album reaching only number 151 on US record charts during a four-week stay,<ref name=White2000 /> becoming the worst-selling Beach Boys album at that point.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=154}} Fans generally regard the LP as the Beach Boys' finest post-''Pet Sounds'' album.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=122}} In 2003, it placed at number 380 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s "Greatest Albums of All Time" list.{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|p=45}}

[[File:Beach Boys Good Vibrations from Central Park 1971.jpg|thumb|left|The Beach Boys performing in Central Park for ABC-TV special in 1971|alt=]]

In mid-1970, the Beach Boys hired radio presenter [[Jack Rieley]] as their manager. One of his initiatives was to encourage the band to record songs featuring more socially conscious lyrics.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=155}} He also requested the completion of "Surf's Up" and arranged a guest appearance at a [[Grateful Dead]] concert at [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[Fillmore East]] in April 1971 to foreground the Beach Boys' transition into the counterculture.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=241–242}} During this time, the group ceased wearing matching uniforms on stage.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=155–156}} In July 1971, the Beach Boys filmed a concert for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] in [[Central Park]], which aired as ''[[Schaefer Music Festival|Good Vibrations from Central Park]]'' on August 19, 1971. The concert also featured performances by [[Boz Scaggs]], [[Kate Taylor]], [[Carly Simon]], and [[Ike & Tina Turner]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-see-beach-boys-cover-merle-haggards-okie-from-muskogee-122238/|title=Flashback: See Beach Boys Cover Merle Haggard's 'Okie From Muskogee'|last=Betts|first=Stephen L.|date=April 27, 2017|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

On August 30, 1971, the band released ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'', which included the title track. The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at [[Carnegie Hall]]; their live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of their previous songs,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=155–158}} with their [[set list]]s culling from ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile''.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=140}} Dennis injured his hand during the ''Surf's Up'' sessions, leaving him temporarily unable to play the drums.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=122}}

==== ''Carl and the Passions'', ''Holland'', and greatest hits LPs ====
[[Ricky Fataar]] and [[Blondie Chaplin]] joined the band in early 1972, with Johnston departing shortly thereafter. The new line-up released the comparatively unsuccessful ''[[Carl and the Passions – "So Tough"]]'' in May, followed by ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]'' in January 1973. Reprise felt ''Holland'' needed a strong single. Following the intervention of Van Dyke Parks, this resulted in the inclusion of "[[Sail On, Sailor]]", a long-germinating collaboration between Brian, Parks, [[Tandyn Almer]], [[Raymond Louis Kennedy|Ray Kennedy]] and Rieley that featured a lead vocal by Chaplin.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=184, 305}} Reprise approved, and the resulting album outpaced ''Carl and the Passions'' from a commercial standpoint, peaking at number 37. Brian's musical children's story, ''[[Mount Vernon and Fairway]]'', was included as a bonus [[extended play|EP]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=181–182}}

In August 1973, [[41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti|the 41-song soundtrack]] to ''[[American Graffiti]]'' was released, including the band's early songs "Surfin' Safari" and "All Summer Long". The album was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reaffirmed the relevance of the Beach Boys in the popular American consciousness.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-10-greatest-summer-songs-20130522/6-the-beach-boys-all-summer-long-0368776 |title=Readers' Poll: The 10 Greatest Summer Songs Pictures – 6.

It rose to the top of the ''Billboard'' charts in October and remained on the charts for two years, the longest of any Beach Boys release.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=123}} In April 1975, Capitol followed up with a second compilation, ''[[Spirit of America (The Beach Boys album)|Spirit of America]]'', which also sold well. With these compilations, the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock, propelling themselves from opening for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] in the summer of 1974 to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=193–194}} ''Rolling Stone'' named the Beach Boys the "Band of the Year" for 1974.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=194}}

Fataar remained with the band until 1974, when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by future [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] member [[Joe Walsh]]. By this juncture, businessman and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] producer [[James William Guercio]] had replaced Chaplin in the touring band at the behest of Dennis, a longtime friend. He started offering the group career advice that resulted in his becoming their new manager. A new album was attempted, with sessions held at Guercio's [[Caribou Ranch]] recording studio in Colorado and at the band's [[Brother Studios]] in L.A. Only a scattering of material from these sessions saw eventual release.{{sfn|Carlin|2006}}{{pages needed|date=October 2021}}

The impetus had shifted from recording new material to large venue touring, and under Guercio, the Beach Boys staged a successful [[Beachago|1975 joint concert tour with Chicago]]. As part of the program, each group performed some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's single "[[Wishing You Were Here]]". While their concerts continuously sold out, the group reverted from a contemporary stage presentation followed by oldies encores to a show made up of mostly pre-1967 music.{{sfn|Carlin|2006}}{{pages needed|date=October 2021}}

====''15 Big Ones'', ''Love You'', and ''M.I.U. Album''====
Brian spent the majority of two years secluded in the chauffeur's quarters of his home, abusing alcohol, taking drugs (including heroin), overeating, and exhibiting other self-destructive behavior.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} In 1975, Brian attempted to join [[California Music]], a Los Angeles collective that included Bruce Johnston and Gary Usher.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=198}} The Beach Boys' recent ''Endless Summer'' compilation was selling well, and the band was touring nonstop, making them the biggest live draw in the US. Guercio was then fired by the group and replaced by Steve Love, who urged the group to encourage Brian to return to the production helm.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=205}} In October, Marilyn persuaded Brian to admit himself to the care of psychologist [[Eugene Landy]], who kept him from indulging in substance abuse with constant supervision.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=253–255}}{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198–199}}

[[File:Brian Wilson 1976 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Brian Wilson behind [[Brother Studios]]' mixing console in 1976]]

At the end of January 1976, the Beach Boys returned to the studio with Brian producing once again.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=358}} Brian decided the band should do an album of rock and roll and [[doo wop]] standards. Carl and Dennis disagreed, feeling that an album of originals was far more ideal, while Love and Jardine wanted the album out as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=358}} Released on July 5, 1976, ''[[15 Big Ones]]'' was generally disliked by fans and critics.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=364}} Its lead single, a cover of Chuck Berry's "[[Rock and Roll Music (song)|Rock and Roll Music]]", peaked at number five.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=124}} Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=364}} An August 1976 [[NBC]]-TV special, ''[[The Beach Boys: It's OK!|The Beach Boys]]'', was produced by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]], and featured appearances by ''SNL'' cast members [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. In December, Brian was released from Landy's program due to disputes over Landy's fee.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=215}}

From late 1976 to early 1977, Brian made sporadic public appearances and produced the band's next album, ''[[The Beach Boys Love You]]'', a collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced alone.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=290}} Released on April 11, 1977, ''Love You'' peaked at number 53 in the US and number 28 in the UK.{{sfn|Badman|2004}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}} It was divided between fans and critics. Some saw the album as a work of "eccentric genius" whereas others dismissed it as "childish and trivial".{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=124}} The album was released weeks after the band signed a new record deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]].{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=149}} Afterward, Brian assembled ''[[Adult/Child]]'', an unreleased effort largely consisting of new songs he had written with select [[big band]] arrangements by Dick Reynolds.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=222}} Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=226}}

The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at [[Central Park]] on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining neutral.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=216–217}} Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac, Dennis declared to ''Rolling Stone'' on September 3 that he had left the band.<ref name=Swenson1977>{{cite magazine|last1=Swenson|first1=John|title=The Beach Boys – No More Fun Fun Fun|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 20, 1977|url=http://smileysmile.net/board/index.php?topic=6867.0}}</ref> The band was broken up until a meeting on September 17 at Brian's house.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=371}}{{refn|group=nb|Love denied that the group had broken up, explaining that, "It was just the end of the tour, Dennis had a lot on his mind, Carl had a lot on his mind.

Dennis started to withdraw from the group to focus on his second solo album, ''[[Bambu (Dennis Wilson album)|Bambu]]'', which was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=124}} Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts (especially at appearances for their 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=226–227}} Mike Love recalled, "We were in Australia, and the Wilsons were upset that some of us were not trying heroin with them.

In an April 1980 interview, Carl reflected that "the last two years have been the most important and difficult time of our career. We were at the ultimate crossroads.

====Lawsuits, ''Summer in Paradise'', ''Stars and Stripes, Vol. 1'', and death of Carl====
{{See also|Andy Paley sessions}}
Love filed a defamation lawsuit against Brian due to how he was presented in Brian's 1992 memoir ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]''. Its publisher [[HarperCollins]] settled the suit for $1.5 million. He said that the suit allowed his lawyer "to gain access to the transcripts of Brian's interviews with his [book] collaborator, Todd Gold. Those interviews affirmed—according to Brian—that I had been the inspiration of the group and that I had written many of the songs that [would soon be] in dispute."{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=353–354}} Other defamation lawsuits were filed by Carl, Brother Records, and the Wilsons' mother Audree.{{sfn|Love|2016|p=353}}

In early 1997, Carl was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking.

After Carl's death, Jardine left the touring line-up and began to perform regularly with his band  "Beach Boys: Family & Friends" until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license.

In 2000, ABC-TV premiered a two-part television miniseries, ''[[The Beach Boys: An American Family]]'', that dramatized the Beach Boys' story.

In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]'', a reinterpretation of the unfinished ''Smile'' project. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the ''[[Daily Mail|Mail On Sunday]]'' that included Beach Boys songs he had recently rerecorded, five of which he co-authored with Love.

==Musical style and development==
{{See also|Brian Wilson#Artistry}}
In ''Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis'', musicologist Daniel Harrison writes:
{{quote|Even from their inception, the Beach Boys were an [[experimental music|experimental]] group. They combined, as Jim Miller has put it, "the instrumental sleekness of [[the Ventures]], the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between [[the Lettermen]] and [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[the Teenagers]]" with lyrics whose images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager. ... [But] it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever. ... Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as [[the Association]], shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so. They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, [[a cappella]] glee-club arrangements containing multiple [[suspension (music)|suspensions]], passing [[musical form|formations]], complex chords, and both [[chromatic]] and [[enharmonic]] [[modulation (music)|modulations]].{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}}}}

The Beach Boys began as a [[garage band]] playing 1950s style [[rock and roll]],{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=15}} reassembling styles of music such as surf to include [[vocal jazz]] [[jazz harmony|harmony]], which created their unique sound.{{sfn|Zager|2011|p=216}} In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the [[pop ballad]] by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=35}} Among the distinct elements of the Beach Boys' style were the nasal quality of their singing voices, their use of a falsetto harmony over a driving, locomotive-like melody, and the sudden chiming in of the whole group on a key line.<ref name="nasal">{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jonathan|title=The Influence of the Beatles on the Music of Rock & Roll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgoYAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Columbia College, Columbia University|date=1966|journal=King's Crown Essays}}</ref> Brian Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, even though he was not properly credited on most of the early recordings.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=26}}

[[File:1967 Rickenbacker 360-12 12 string electric guitar owned and photographed by Greg Field.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A [[Rickenbacker 360/12]] identical to the 12-string guitar used by Carl Wilson in the early to mid-1960s]]
Early on, Mike Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed guitar lines on the group's ballads.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Jim Miller commented: "On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead ... on ballads, Brian played his [[falsetto]] off against lush, [[jazz]]-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures."{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Harrison adds that "even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}} Although Brian was often dubbed a perfectionist, he was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding of music was mostly self-taught.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105, 114}} At the lyric stage, he usually worked with Love,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=73}} whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=108}} Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle, in the examples "[[Lonely Sea]]" and "[[In My Room]]".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=27}}

Brian's bandmates resented the notion that he was the sole creative force in the group.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=110}} In a 1966 article that asked if "the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian", Carl said that although Brian was the most responsible for their music, every member of the group contributed ideas.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=146–147}} Mike Love wrote, "As far as I was concerned, Brian ''was'' a genius, deserving of that recognition. But the rest of us were seen as nameless components in Brian's music machine ... It didn't feel to us as if we were just riding on Brian's coattails."{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=145–147}} Conversely, Dennis defended Brian's stature in the band, stating: "Brian Wilson ''is'' the Beach Boys. He is the band. We're his fucking messengers. He is all of it. Period. We're nothing. He's everything."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=316}}

===Influences===
{{Further|List of songs covered by the Beach Boys}}
The band's earliest influences came primarily from the work of Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=16}} Performed by the Four Freshmen, "[[Their Hearts Were Full of Spring]]" (1961) was a particular favorite of the group.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=34, 54}} By analyzing their arrangements of [[pop standards]], Brian educated himself on [[jazz harmony]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=5}} Bearing this in mind, Philip Lambert noted, "If [[Bob Flanigan (singer)|Bob Flanigan]] helped teach Brian how to sing, then [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]], [[Jerome Kern|Kern]], [[Cole Porter|Porter]], and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song."{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=6}} Other general influences on the group included [[the Hi-Los]],{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=16}} [[the Penguins]], [[the Robins]], [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], [[Otis Williams]], [[the Cadets (doo wop)|the Cadets]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[the Shirelles]], [[The Regents (doo-wop band)|the Regents]], and [[the Crystals]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=14–15}}

|quote=Though the Beach Boys are often caricatured as the ultimate white, suburban act, black [[R&B]] was crucial to their sound.
|source= — [[Geoffrey Himes]]<ref name=HimesSurf />}}
The eclectic mix of white and black vocal group influences – ranging from the rock and roll of Berry, the jazz harmonies of the Four Freshmen, the pop of [[the Four Preps]], the folk of [[the Kingston Trio]], the R&B of groups like [[the Coasters]] and [[the Five Satins]], and the doo wop of [[Dion and the Belmonts]] – helped contribute to the Beach Boys' uniqueness in American popular music.{{sfn|Murphy|2015|p=58}} Carl remembered: "Most of [Mike's] classmates were black. He was the only white guy on his track team. He was really immersed in doo-wop and that music and I think he influenced Brian to listen to it. The black artists were so much better in terms of rock records in those days that the white records almost sounded like put-ons."<ref name=HimesSurf /> On Jimi Hendrix and "heavy" music, Brian said he felt no pressure to go in that direction: "We never got into the heavy musical level trip. We never needed to. It's already been done."<ref name=CoynePart1>{{cite magazine|last1=Coyne|first1=Wayne|author-link1=Wayne Coyne|title=Playing Both Sides of the Coyne Part One|magazine=Stop Smiling|date=2000|issue=9|url=http://www.stopsmilingonline.com/story_detail.php?id=224}}</ref>

Another significant influence on Brian's work was [[Burt Bacharach]].{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2017|p=37}} He said in the 1960s: "Burt Bacharach and [[Hal David]] are more like me. They're also the best pop team – per se – today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=64}} Regarding surf rock pioneer [[Dick Dale]], Brian said that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2005/08/10/brian-wilson-interview-with-brian-wilson/|title=Interview with Brian Wilson|publisher=theaquarian.com|access-date=November 22, 2009}}</ref> Carl credited Chuck Berry, [[the Ventures]], and [[John Walker (musician)|John Walker]] with shaping his guitar style, and that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of the Ventures' songs by ear early in their career.<ref name="Hinsche">{{cite magazine|last1=Hinsche|first1=Billy|author-link1=Billy Hinsche|title=Carl Wilson Interview|magazine=[[Guitar One]]|url=http://www.billyhinsche.com/story4.html|date=November 2001}}</ref>

In 1967, [[Lou Reed]] wrote in ''[[Aspen (magazine)|Aspen]]'' that the Beach Boys created a "hybrid sound" out of old rock and the Four Freshmen, explaining that such songs as "Let Him Run Wild", "Don't Worry Baby", "I Get Around", and "Fun, Fun, Fun" were not unlike "Peppermint Stick" by the Elchords.{{sfn|Unterberger|2009|p=122}} Similarly, [[John Sebastian]] of [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] noted, "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like [[the Crew Cuts]]. Look what gold he mined out of that."{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=16}}

===Vocals===
Brian identified each member individually for their [[vocal range]], once detailing the ranges for Carl, Dennis, Jardine ("[they] progress upwards through G, A, and B"), Love ("can go from bass to the E above middle C"), and himself ("I can take the second D in the [[treble clef]]").<ref name="PopGenius"/>{{refn|group=nb|Starting with the 1970 sessions for the ''Surf's Up'' album, Stephen Desper remembers the emerging corrosive effects of Brian's incessant [[chain smoking]] and [[cocaine]] use: "He could still do falsettos and stuff, but he'd need Carl to help him. Either that or I'd modify the tape speed-wise to make it artificially higher, so it sounded like the old days."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=160}}}} He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing to his fascination with a voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a "groovy sectional sound."<ref name="PopGenius">{{cite magazine|title=Brian Pop Genius!|magazine=Melody Maker|date=May 21, 1966|url=http://i1218.photobucket.com/albums/dd420/kwan_dk/MMMay211966.jpg}}</ref> He added, "The harmonies that we are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake."{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=17}}<ref name="PopGenius"/> For a period, Brian avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying, "I thought people thought I was a [[fairy (gay slang)|fairy]]...the band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'"<ref name=RCMSharp>{{cite magazine|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|title=Christmas with Brian Wilson|magazine=[[Record Collector]]|date=January 2006|pages=72–76|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>

From lowest [[interval (music)|intervals]] to highest, the group's vocal harmony stack usually began with Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top, according to Jardine,<ref name=Sharp2013>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|title=Al Jardine of the Beach Boys: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About "SMiLE" (Interview)|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/al-jardine-smile-beach-boys-interview/|website=Rock Cellar Magazine|access-date=July 2, 2014|date=April 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714111352/http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/al-jardine-smile-beach-boys-interview/|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> while Carl said that the blend was Love on bottom, Carl above, followed by Dennis or Jardine, and then Brian on top.<ref name="HimesSurf">{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|author-link=Geoffrey Himes|title=Surf Music|url=http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|website=teachrock.org|publisher=Rock and Roll: An American History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125223127/http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|archive-date=November 25, 2015}}</ref> Jardine explains, "We always sang the same vocal intervals. ... As soon as we heard the chords on the piano we'd figure it out pretty easily. If there was a vocal move [Brian] envisioned, he'd show that particular singer that move. We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that [was] never a problem for us."<ref name=Sharp2013/> Striving for perfection, Brian insured that his intricate vocal arrangements exercised the group's calculated blend of [[intonation (music)|intonation]], [[attack (music)|attack]], [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], and [[musical expression|expression]].{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|pp=17–19}} Sometimes, he would sing each vocal harmony part alone through multi-track tape.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=106}}

On the group's blend, Carl said: "[Love] has a beautifully rich, very full-sounding bass voice. Yet his lead singing is real nasal, real punk. [Jardine]'s voice has a bright timbre to it; it really cuts. My voice has a kind of calm sound. We're big oooh-ers; we love to oooh. It's a big, full sound, that's very pleasing to us; it opens up the heart."<ref name=HimesSurf/> Rock critic [[Erik Davis]] wrote, "The 'purity' of tone and genetic proximity that smoothed their voices was almost creepy, pseudo-[[castrato]], [and] a '[[barbershop music|barbershop]]' sound."<ref name="Davis1990">{{cite news|last=Davis |first=Erik |title=Look!

===Use of studio musicians===
[[File:The Beach Boys TV.jpg|thumb|The Beach Boys performing in 1964]]
Nine months after forming, the group achieved national success, and demand for their personal appearance skyrocketed. Biographer James Murphy said, "By most contemporary accounts, they were not a very good live band when they started. ... The Beach Boys learned to play as a band in front of live audiences", eventually to become "one of the best and enduring live bands".<ref name=RCMMurphy>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|date=November 6, 2011|title=Catch A Wave: A Chat with Beach Boys Author James B.

Their assistance was needed because of the increasingly complicated nature of the material.{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=127}} Afterward, the members only performed the instrumental tracks to certain recordings.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=18}} It is the belief of [[Richie Unterberger]] that, "Before session musicians took over most of the parts, the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self-contained unit."{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}}

Carl was an exception among the group in that he played alongside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=114}} In archivist Craig Slowinski's view, "One should not sell short Carl's own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio. Carl's guitar playing [was] a key ingredient."<ref name="slowtoday">{{cite web |url=http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/custommusic2/craigslowinskicom.pdf#page=42 |title= The Beach Boys – The Beach Boys Today! |first= Craig|last=Slowinski|year=2007 |access-date=October 27, 2012}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Carl's lead and rhythm guitar playing is featured on several of the band’s singles, including "I Get Around", "Fun, Fun, Fun", "Don’t Worry Baby",<ref name="Slowinski2014">{{cite AV media notes| title = Keep an Eye on Summer 1964 | others= The Beach Boys| year = 2014|first1=Alan|last1=Boyd|first2=Mark|last2=Linette|first3=Craig|last3=Slowinski|author-link1=Alan Boyd|author-link2=Mark Linett|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=Digital Liner|url=http://www.thebeachboys.com/#?news=4111}} ([http://fridaynightboys300.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/the-beach-boys-1964-keep-eye-on-summer.html Mirror])</ref> "When I Grow Up (To Be A Man)", "Do You Wanna Dance?", and "Dance, Dance, Dance".<ref name="slowtoday"/>}}

===Spirituality===
The band members often reflected on the spiritual nature of their music (and music in general), particularly for the recording of ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile''.{{sfn|Sellars|2015|pp=8–9}} Even though the Wilsons did not grow up in a particularly religious household,{{sfn|Sellars|2015|p=8}} Carl was described as "the most truly religious person I know" by Brian, and Carl was forthcoming about the group's spiritual beliefs stating: "We believe in God as a kind of [[universal consciousness]]. God is love. God is you. God is me. God is everything right here in this room. It's a spiritual concept which inspires a great deal of our music."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=85}} Carl told ''Rave'' magazine in 1967 that the group's influences are of a "religious nature", but not any religion in specific, only "an idea based upon that of Universal Consciousness. ... The spiritual concept of happiness and doing good to others is extremely important to the lyric of our songs, and the religious element of some of the better [[church music]] is also contained within some of our new work."<ref name=Rave1967>{{cite news|last1=Grant|first1=Mike|title='Our influences are of a religious nature': the Beach Boys on Smile|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/11/beach-boys-smile-brian-wilson|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

Brian is quoted during the ''Smile'' era: "I'm very religious. Not in the sense of churches, going to church; but like the essence of ''all'' religion."{{sfn|Sellars|2015|p=8}} During the recording of ''Pet Sounds'', Brian held [[prayer meeting]]s, later reflecting that "God was with us the whole time we were doing this record ... I could feel that feeling in my brain."{{sfn|Fusilli|2005|p=97}} In 1966, he explained that he wanted to move into a [[religious music|white spiritual sound]], and predicted that the rest of the music industry would follow suit.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=94}} In 2011, Brian maintained the spirituality was important to his music, and that he did not follow any particular religion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yakas|first1=Ben|title=Our Ten Minutes With Beach Boys Legend Brian Wilson|url=http://gothamist.com/2011/10/27/brian_wilson.php|date=October 27, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725054715/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/27/brian_wilson.php|archive-date=July 25, 2015}}</ref>

Carl said that ''Smile'' was chosen as an album title because of its connection to the group's spiritual beliefs.<ref name=Rave1967/> Brian referred to ''Smile'' as his "teenage symphony to God",{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=4}} composing a [[hymn]], "[[Our Prayer]]", as the album's opening spiritual invocation.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=41, 270}} Experimentation with [[psychotropic]] substances also proved pivotal to the group's development as artists.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Griffiths|first1=David|title=Dennis Wilson: "I Live With 17 Girls"|magazine=Record Mirror|date=December 21, 1968}}</ref>{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=58}} He spoke of his LSD trips as a "religious experience", and during a session for "Our Prayer", Brian can be heard asking the other Beach Boys: "Do you guys feel any acid yet?".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=94, 116}} In 1968, the group's interest in [[transcendental meditation]] led them to record the original song, "[[Transcendental Meditation (song)|Transcendental Meditation]]".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=215}}

Brian Wilson's artistic control over the Beach Boys' records was unprecedented for the time.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=54–55}} Carl Wilson elaborated: "Record companies were used to having absolute control over their artists. It was especially nervy, because Brian was a 21-year-old kid with just two albums. It was unheard of. But what could they say? Brian made good records."<ref name="Himes1983"/> This made the Beach Boys one of the first rock groups to exert studio control.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}} Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on Brian's influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}}

===California sound===
{{Main|California sound}}
[[File:The Beach Boys 1963 Billboard 2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The Beach Boys appearing in a ''Billboard'' advertisement on June 29, 1963]]
Professor of cultural studies James M. Curtis wrote in 1987, "We can say that the Beach Boys represent the outlook and values of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|white Protestant Anglo-Saxon]] teenagers in the early sixties. Having said that, we immediately realize that they must mean much more than this. Their stability, their staying power, and their ability to attract new fans prove as much."{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=101}} Cultural historian [[Kevin Starr]] explains that the group first connected with young Americans specifically for their lyrical interpretation of a mythologized landscape: "Cars and the beach, surfing, the California Girl, all this fused in the alembic of youth: Here was a way of life, an iconography, already half-released into the chords and multiple tracks of a new sound."{{sfn|Starr|2009|p=373}} in [[Robert Christgau]]'s opinion, "the Beach Boys were a touchstone for real rock and rollers, all of whom understood that the music had its most essential roots in an innocently hedonistic materialism."<ref name="Christgau1975"/>

The group's "California sound" grew to national prominence through the success of their 1963 album ''Surfin' U.S.A.'',{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=32}} which helped turn the surfing subculture into a mainstream youth-targeted advertising image widely exploited by the film, television, and food industry.{{sfn|May|2002|pp=114–115}} The group's surf music was not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=13}} However, previous surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}} The band's earlier surf music helped raise the profile of the state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for [[Southern California]], as opposed to [[Hollywood]].{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=103}} California ultimately supplanted New York as the center of popular music thanks to the success of Brian's productions.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=54–55}}

[[File:Little Deuce Coupe.jpg|thumb|right|The 1932 Ford that appeared on the cover to the platinum certified album ''Little Deuce Coupe'']]
A 1966 article discussing new trends in rock music writes that the Beach Boys popularized a type of drum beat heard in [[Jan and Dean]]'s "[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]", which sounds like "a locomotive getting up speed", in addition to the method of "suddenly stopping in between the chorus and verse".<ref name="nasal"/> [[Pete Townshend]] of the Who is credited with coining the term "[[power pop]]", which he defined as "what we play—what the [[Small Faces]] used to play, and the kind of pop the Beach Boys played in the days of 'Fun, Fun, Fun' which I preferred."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Altham |first=Keith |title=Lily Isn't Pornographic, Say Who |journal=[[NME]] |issue=May 20, 1967}}</ref>

The California sound gradually evolved to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=61–62, 83}} Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as [[sexual freedom]], [[black pride]], [[drugs]], [[Opposition (politics)|oppositional politics]], other [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] motifs, and [[war]].{{sfn|Shuker|1994|p=35}} [[Sunshine pop|Soft pop]] (later known as "sunshine pop") derived in part from this movement.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=69}} Sunshine pop producers widely imitated the orchestral style of ''Pet Sounds''; however, the Beach Boys themselves were rarely representative of the genre, which was rooted in [[easy-listening]] and [[Jingle|advertising jingles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/sunshine-pop-54224|title=Gateways to Geekery: Sunshine Pop|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|date=April 7, 2011|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=Onion Inc.|access-date=November 27, 2015}}</ref>

By the end of the 1960s, the California sound declined due to a combination of the West Coast's cultural shifts, Wilson's professional and psychological downturn, and the Manson murders, with David Howard calling it the "sunset of the original California Sunshine Sound ... [the] sweetness advocated by the California Myth had led to chilling darkness and unsightly rot".{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=84}} Drawing from the Beach Boys' associations with Charles Manson and former California governor Ronald Reagan, Erik Davis remarked, "The Beach Boys may be the only bridge between those deranged poles. There is a wider range of political and aesthetic sentiments in their records than in any other band in those heady times—like the state [of California], they expand and bloat and contradict themselves."<ref name="Davis1990"/>

During the 1970s, advertising jingles and imagery were predominately based on the Beach Boys' early music and image.{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=8}} The group also inspired the development of the West Coast style later dubbed "[[yacht rock]]". According to ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]''{{'}}s Dan O'Sullivan, the band's aesthetic was the first to be "scavenged" by yacht rock acts like [[Rupert Holmes]]. O'Sullivan also cites the Beach Boys' recording of "Sloop John B" as the origin of yacht rock's preoccupation with the "sailors and beachgoers" aesthetic that was "lifted by everyone, from [[Christopher Cross]] to [[Eric Carmen]], from '[[Buffalo Springfield]]' folksters like [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] to '[[Philly Sound]]' rockers like [[Hall & Oates]]."<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Dan|title="California Über Alles": The Empire Yachts Back|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/09/the-yacht-rock-counterrevolution/|work=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=September 4, 2012}}</ref>

===Innovations===
{{see also|Recording studio as an instrument}}
''Pet Sounds'' came to inform the developments of genres such as pop, rock, jazz, [[electronic music|electronic]], [[experimental music|experimental]], [[punk rock|punk]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref name="Pitchfork50">{{cite web |last1=Hart |first1=Ron |title=The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds Celebrates its 50th Anniversary: Artists Pay Tribute to the Eternal Teenage Symphony |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9870-the-beach-boys-pet-sounds-celebrates-its-50th-anniversary-artists-pay-tribute-to-the-eternal-teenage-symphony/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=April 12, 2016}}</ref> Similar to subsequent [[experimental rock]] LPs by [[Frank Zappa]], the Beatles, and [[the Who]], ''Pet Sounds'' featured countertextural aspects that called attention to the very recordedness of the album.{{sfn|Lowe|2007|pp=38, 219}} Professor of American history [[John Robert Greene]] stated that the album broke new ground and took rock music away from its casual lyrics and melodic structures into what was then uncharted territory. He furthermore called it one factor which spawned the majority of trends in post-1965 rock music, the only others being ''Rubber Soul'', the Beatles' ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', and the contemporary folk movement.{{sfn|Greene|2010|p=155}} The album was the first piece in popular music to incorporate the [[Electro-Theremin]], an easier-to-play version of the [[theremin]], as well as the first in rock music to feature a theremin-like instrument.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=240}} With ''Pet Sounds'', they were also the first group to make an entire album that departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format.<ref name="Sommer2016">{{cite web |last1=Sommer |first1=Tim |author-link=Tim Sommer |title=This Is Your Brain on 'Pet Sounds' |url=http://observer.com/2016/05/this-is-your-brain-on-pet-sounds/ |website=[[The Observer]] |date=May 16, 2016}}</ref>

According to David Leaf in 1978, ''Pet Sounds'' and "Good Vibrations" "established the group as the leaders of a new type of pop music, [[Art Rock]]."{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=74}} Academic [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] states that the band opened a path in rock music "that went from ''Sgt. Pepper's'' to ''[[Close to the Edge (Yes album)|Close to the Edge]]'' and beyond". He argues that the advancing technology of [[multitrack recording]] and [[mixing board]]s were more influential to experimental rock than [[electronic instruments]] such as the [[synthesizer]], allowing the Beatles and the Beach Boys to become the first crop of non-[[classically trained]] musicians to create extended and complex compositions.{{sfn|Martin|2015|p=75}} In ''Strange Sounds: Offbeat Instruments and Sonic Experiments in Pop'', Mark Brend writes:
{{quote|Other artists and producers, notably the Beatles and Phil Spector, had used varied instrumentation and multi-tracking to create complex studio productions before. And others, like [[Roy Orbison]], had written complicated pop songs before. But "Good Vibrations" eclipsed all that came before it, in both its complexity as a production and the liberties it took with conventional notions of how to structure a pop song.{{sfn|Brend|2005|p=19}} }}

The making of "Good Vibrations", according to Domenic Priore, was "unlike anything previous in the realms of classical, jazz, international, soundtrack, or any other kind of recording",{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=55}} while biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] wrote that it "sounded like nothing that had ever been played on the radio before."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=95–96}} It contained previously untried mixes of instruments, and was the first successful pop song to have cellos in a juddering rhythm.{{sfn|Brend|2005|pp=18–19}} Musicologist [[Charlie Gillett]] called it "one of the first records to flaunt studio production as a quality in its own right, rather than as a means of presenting a performance".{{sfn|Gillett|1984|p=329}} Again, Brian employed the use of Electro-Theremin for the track. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins while increasing awareness of [[analog synthesizer]]s, leading [[Moog Music]] to produce their own brand of [[ribbon controller|ribbon-controlled]] instruments.{{sfn|Pinch|Trocco|2009|pp=102–103}}{{refn|group=nb|Even though the Electro-Theremin was not technically a theremin, the song became the most frequently cited example of the theremin in pop music.{{sfn|Brend|2005|p=16}}}} In a 1968 editorial for ''[[Jazz & Pop]]'', Gene Sculatti predicted that the song "may yet prove to be the most significantly revolutionary piece of the current rock renaissance ... In no minor way, 'Good Vibrations' is a primary influential piece for all producing rock artists; everyone has felt its import to some degree".<ref name="scullati" />

Discussing ''Smiley Smile'', Daniel Harrison argues that the album could "almost" be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that the group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced [[atonality|atonal]] and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, "The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable ... as it is in, say, [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s [[Drei Klavierstücke (Schoenberg)|op. 11 piano pieces]]."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=47}} However, such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=59}} Harrison concludes: "What influences could these innovations then have? The short answer is, not much. ''Smiley Smile'', ''Wild Honey'', ''Friends'', and ''20/20'' sound like few other rock albums; they are ''sui generis''. ... It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=59}} Musicologist [[David Toop]], who included the ''Smiley Smile'' track "[[Fall Breaks and Back to Winter]]" on a companion CD for his book ''[[Ocean of Sound]]'', placed the Beach Boys' effect on sound pioneering in league with [[Les Baxter]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[King Tubby]], and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ocean-of-sound-mw0000538713|title=Ocean of Sound – David Toop|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 11, 2014}}</ref>

''Sunflower'' marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by ''Smiley Smile''.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} After ''Surf's Up'', Harrison wrote, their albums "contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead," until 1974, "the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock 'n' roll act and became an oldies act."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}}

==Critical perspective==
Between 1965 and 1967, the Beach Boys developed a musical and lyrical sophistication that contrasted their work from before and after. This divide was further solidified by the difference in sound between their albums and their stage performances.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p= {{page needed|date=May 2018}}}} When the band's studio recordings grew more complex, they were unable to effectively reproduce them in their live show.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=187}} Starting in 1966, band publicist Derek Taylor was instrumental in campaigning the idea of Brian Wilson as a "genius" to members of the burgeoning rock press, painting him as a mastermind who stays at home composing while the rest of the band tour. All of these elements combined to create a split fanbase corresponding to two distinct musical markets. One group is the conservative audience who enjoys the band's early singles as a wholesome representation of American popular culture from before the political and social movements brought on in the mid 1960s. The other group also appreciates the early songs for their energy and complexity, but not as much as the band's ambitious work that was created during the formative [[psychedelic era]].{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p={{page needed|date=May 2018}}}}

Initially, rock music journalists valued the Beach Boys' early records over their experimental work.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p=218}}{{refn|group=nb|For example, critics from ''Rolling Stone'' were wary of the group's changing music, with [[Ralph J. Gleason]] writing in January 1968: "The Beach Boys, when they were a reflection of an actuality of American society (i.e., Southern California hot rod, surfing and beer-bust fraternity culture), made music that had vitality and interest. When they went past that, they were forced inexorably to go into electronics and this excursion, for them, is of limited scope, good as the vibrations were."{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p=218}}}} Real surfers were critical of the band for not being true adherents of the sport. As [[authenticity (art)|authenticity]] became a higher concern among critics, the group's legitimacy in rock music became an oft-repeated criticism, especially since their early songs appeared to celebrate a politically unconscious youth culture.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=18, 33–36}} Music critic Kenneth Partridge blamed the lack of "edginess" on the group's early records for why they are "rarely talked about in the same breath as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and when they are, it's really only because of two albums".<ref name=PartridgeCoS2015>{{cite magazine|last1=Partridge|first1=Kenneth|title=Why a Comprehensive Beach Boys Biopic Would Likely Fail|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/06/why-a-comprehensive-beach-boys-biopic-would-likely-fail/|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=June 5, 2015}}</ref> The "particular appeal" of Wilson's genius, according to music critic [[Barney Hoskyns]], was "the fact that the Beach Boys were the very obverse of hip – the unlikeliness of these songs growing out of disposable surf pop – and in the singular naivety and ingenuousness of his personality."<ref name="Hoskyns95">{{cite news|last1=Hoskyns|first1=Barney|title="Brian Wilson is a Genius": The Birth of a Pop Cult|url=https://barneyhoskyns.com/2016/10/13/he-is-brian-wilson/|work=[[The Independent]]|date=September 1, 1995}}</ref> Luis Sanchez argued that despite the immaturity of their early songs, "what matters is that it captured a lack of self-consciousness—a ''genuineness''—that set them apart from their peers. And it was this quality that came to define Brian's oeuvre as he moved beyond and into bigger pop productions that would culminate in ''Smile''."{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=32}}

Generally, the record-buying public came to view the music made after ''Smile'' as the point marking their artistic decline.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p={{page needed|date=May 2018}}}} After ''Smiley Smile'', the group was virtually blacklisted by the music press, to the extent that reviews of the group's records were either withheld from publication or published long after the release dates.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=200}} Mike Love said that, unlike Brian, he was never concerned about being taken seriously by critics, and considered the negatively described "simplicity" of their early songs as "elitism at its worst: because so many people loved our music, there must be something wrong with it."{{sfn|Love|2016|p=146}} In a review of ''The Smile Sessions'' for ''[[NewMusicBox]]'', Frank Oteri argued that the popular caricature of the Beach Boys' as a "light-hearted party band" ensured that they will never earn themselves "the same pride of place in American music history held by other great innovators".<ref name=Oteri2011>{{cite web|last1=Oteri|first1=Frank J.|title=Sounds Heard: The Beach Boys—The Smile Sessions|url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/sounds-heard-the-beach-boys-the-smile-sessions/|website=New Music Box|access-date=July 2, 2014|date=December 8, 2011}}</ref> Peter Ames Carlin summarized the group's various phases: "Once surfin' pin-ups, they remade themselves as [[avant-garde pop]] artists, then psychedelic oracles. After that they were down-home hippies, then retro-hip icons. Eventually they devolved into none of the above: a kind of perpetual-motion nostalgia machine."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Carlin |first1=Peter Ames |author-link=Peter Ames Carlin|title=MUSIC; A Rock Utopian Still Chasing An American Dream|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/arts/music-a-rock-utopian-still-chasing-an-american-dream.html|date=March 25, 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Erik Davis wrote that by 1990, "the Beach Boys are either dead, deranged, or dinosaurs; their records are Eurocentric, square, unsampled; they've made too much money to merit hip revisionism."<ref name="Davis1990"/> Two years later Jim Miller wrote, "They have become a figment of their own past, prisoners of their unflagging popularity—incongruous emblems of a sunny myth of eternal youth belied by much of their own best music. … The group is still largely identified with its hits from the early Sixties."{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=192, 195}}}}

Since the 1990s, there has been an increasing tendency to recontextualize the Beach Boys outside of their typical iconography, with academic Kirk Curnutt citing such examples as the use of "[[Sloop John B]]" as [[Vietnam]] allegory in the film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994) and "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times" as an [[LSD]]-inspired underscore for one episode of the television drama ''[[Mad Men]]'' (2012).{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p=22}}

The concert was the first-ever appearance of South African [[Ricky Fataar]] as an official member of the band and Filipino [[Billy Hinsche]] as a touring member, essentially changing The Beach Boys' live and recording act's line-up into a multi-cultural group. This shifted the band into an essential and important creative period from 1972-1973 that included the recording of their critically acclaimed 'Holland' LP, and Rolling Stone magazine naming them 'Band of the Year.'
