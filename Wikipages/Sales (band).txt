Their latest musical project, SALES, is based on vocal and instrumental improvisation as well as [[sampling (music)|sampling]].<ref name="AFP Yahoo May 23"/>

On January 31, 2014, the first day of the [[Chinese New Year]], the band released their second single titled "Chinese New Year".<ref>{{cite web| date = January 31, 2014 | title=SALES Bandcamp |url=http://sales.bandcamp.com/track/chinese-new-year| work = [[Bandcamp]] |accessdate= August 27, 2014}}</ref> The band subsequently received positive acclaim from music [[blogs]], including [[CMJ]], [[Stereogum]], and [[Pigeons and Planes]].<ref name="Plaugic CMJ">{{cite web|last=Plaugic|first=Lizzie| date = January 31, 2014 | title=Listen: SALES – "Chinese New Year"|url=http://www.cmj.com/news/listen-sales-chinese-new-year/| work = [[CMJ]] |accessdate= August 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rettig|first=James| date = January 31, 2014 | title=Sales – "Chinese New Year"|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1652602/sales-chinese-new-year/mp3s/

CMJ described the track as a "...sandy, sashaying tune with singer Lauren Morgan's slightly cooing vocals skipping over upbeat guitars and a little synthy buzz. At least the Year of the Horse is sounding pretty good so far."<ref name="Plaugic CMJ"/>

On September 16, the band announced the release of their debut [[Extended play|EP]], along with a remix by fellow Orlando musician [[XXYYXX]].<ref>{{cite web |date = October 19, 2014 | title = premiere: SALES – toto (XXYYXX remix)
