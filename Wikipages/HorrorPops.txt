'''HorrorPops''' are a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Punk rock|punk]] band that formed in 1996. The band's sound is rooted in [[psychobilly]], [[rockabilly]], and [[punk rock]].

==History==

=== 1996–1999: Formation ===
Band founders [[Patricia Day]] and [[Kim Nekroman]] first met when Day's now-defunct band, the [[punk rock]] group Peanut Pump Gun, opened for Nekroman's [[psychobilly]] band, [[Nekromantix]], at the POPKOM festival in [[Cologne, Germany]] in 1996. Despite both belonging to the subculture scene of [[Copenhagen, Denmark]], the two had never met before, but they became friends over their mutual interest in [[alternative music]]. The two would eventually marry. <span>The two both loved [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], as well as [[Surf rock|Surf]], [[Ska]], and Punk.</span>

Day and Nekroman decided to form a band where they could experiment with many genres outside of their normal bands, and decided to start by switching instruments. Nekroman taught Day how to play an upright bass, while she taught him how to play guitar. The two began auditioning for a drummer, with Nekromantix guitarist Peter Sandorff even being a possible choice. They eventually chose Niedermeier to drum, a friend of Day's and a member of the band Strawberry Slaughterhouse, and officially started HorrorPops in 1998. After touring for a while as a trio, the band recruited Niedermeier's old bandmate, Caz the Clash, as a second guitarist.

=== 2000–2003: Demo tape and signing ===
In 2000, Day recruited two friends, Mille and [[Kamilla Vanilla]], co-workers at the [[body piercing]] shop she worked at to act as [[go-go dancer]]s for the band's live show. The group also recorded a 7-song demo for use in a [[press kit]], but it was somehow leaked to the public, and resulted in two of the group's singles, "Ghouls" and "<span>Psychobitches outta Hell"</span> becoming club hits in Denmark. The group spent the next few years touring [[Europe]], until 2003, when they began recording 6 more demo tracks. During this time, Caz the Clash became a father and left the band to focus on parenting. He was replaced by another Strawberry Slaughterhouse member, Karsten. [[Hellcat Records]], [[Tim Armstrong]]'s record label, decided to sign HorrorPops based on their demos. The band was able to release a [[vinyl single]] in September 2003, and began a [[United States|U.S.]] headlining tour.

<span>HorrorPops ventured out on their first US tour as headliner for the "Aloha from hell tour" with 9 shows across California and Arizona. This also brought the first US interview to HorrorPops which happened to be with Vogue. Later same year the band got a great preview of their upcoming show with Rancid in LA weekly and a show with Rancid and Tiger Army at the Wiltern, LA. This show brought HorrorPops out to a lot of new people.</span>

=== 2004: Hell Yeah ===
[[Hell Yeah! (HorrorPops album)|Hell Yeah!]] was released February 10, 2004; the interest in the band grew and when they did their release show at [[Amoeba Records]], it was packed, to the surprise of everyone in HorrorPops. HorrorPops was then supposed to follow up with a grand U.S. tour, but got stuck in immigration paperwork and had to cancel the whole tour. [[The Offspring]] was just about to head out on their month-long European tour and with a three-day warning HorrorPops got offered the chance to join them as main support. Horrorpops played every night for audiences numbering between 5000 and 16000 people, and then continued with their own {{frac|1|1|2}}-month headline tour in Europe. Shortly after the European tour ended, Horrorpops returned to the states to play [[Jimmy Kimmel Live]] and a few California shows, but realizing the work that lay ahead and how time-consuming the band had become, Mille had to leave the band to go back to school. Mille got replaced by another good friend of the band, Naomi, who was quickly renamed NoNo. HorrorPops started touring the states, first on Punks VS Psychos, then as main support for [[Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards]] and then back to Europe for another tour. The band toured continuously in 2004 and the band enjoyed it. The Horrorpops also played in a movie called ''The Punk Rock Halocust'' and therefore made them more popular. Later, Karsten had to leave the band; he met the love of his life and wanted to spend time with her which was hard to do with the band's tour schedule. HorrorPops played around 110 shows in 2004 and went back to Los Angeles to start work on their second album. They played one last show for the year in West Hollywood to announce their new guitar player.

=== 2005–2008: Bring it On and Kiss Kiss Kill Kill ===
The band soon relocated from Denmark to [[Los Angeles, California]]. The band's second album, ''[[Bring It On! (HorrorPops album)|Bring It On!]]'', was released on September 13, 2005 and featured their new rhythm guitarist, [[Geoff Kresge]]. <span>The HorrorPops spent most of 2006 touring Canada, Asia, Europe, and the States, including a Warped Tour stint. Kresge left the group before the band's next album, bringing the group back to three members.</span>

Their third album, released on February 5, 2008, is called ''[[Kiss Kiss Kill Kill]]''. The band<span> began a North American tour around the time the album was released. They began the tour with an electric show in San Luis Obispo, CA, USA where they have a fairly loyal following, and are currently touring with two bands from Los Angeles, CA. Their opening bands include </span>[[Rocket (California band)|Rocket]]<span>, which is an [[all-female band]], and </span>[[The Pink Spiders]]<span>, a pop punk band. They are on Vans Warped Tour all summer. After the release of </span>''Kiss Kiss Kill Kill''<span>, they began to have a much larger fan base.</span><!-- (Highlights of 2004: debut release, Offspring support tour, performing at Jimmy Kimmel, sold out Troubadour W.

=='Barbie doll' controversy==
On 23 December 2010, Patricia Day filed a lawsuit in an [[Indianapolis]] federal court against the  [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock casino]], charging infringement of the [[Personality rights|right of publicity]] and false [[Testimonial|endorsement]]. In her lawsuit, the HorrorPops singer claimed Hard Rock and [[Mattel Inc.|Mattel]] had been selling a [[Barbie doll]] in her image without her authorization.

Mattel and Hard Rock have released a series of rock ‘n’ roll-themed Barbies, featuring pioneering female musicians such as [[Debbie Harry]] of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Joan Jett]] or [[Cyndi Lauper]]. In the lawsuit it is alleged that another doll, called the “Hard Rock Café Barbie Doll" or the “Rockabilly Barbie,” is made in the image<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barbies.es/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/imagen3.gif |title=Image of "Hard Rock Barbie" |access-date=2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316131147/http://www.barbies.es/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/imagen3.gif |archive-date=2012-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of the HorrorPops lead singer but without direct acknowledgement of nor permission by Patricia Day.<ref>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/dec/25/singer-alleges-barbie-doll-made-her-likeness/ "Singer alleges Barbie doll made in her likeness"] ''Las Vegas Sun'', 25 December 2010</ref>
