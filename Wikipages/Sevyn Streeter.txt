==Early life==
Streeter was born on July 7, 1986, in [[Haines City, Florida]], to Tim and Karen Streeter.<ref name="birthdate"/> She grew up singing in church and talent shows; by the time she was 5, Streeter already knew she wanted to sing for a living. At the age of 10, she competed on ''[[Showtime at the Apollo]]'' and tied for first place by singing "My Funny Valentine".

==Career==

===2001–12: TG4 and RichGirl===
Streeter received her first record deal at the age of 9 years, performing in the girl group [[Tom Gurl Four|TG4]], which was put together by [[Chris Stokes (director)|Chris Stokes]] and [[The Ultimate Group|T.U.G. Entertainment]], where Stokes served as their manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://groups.msn.com/tg4ownsthespottomgirlsfour |title=TG4 owns the spot |publisher=groups.msn.com |access-date=October 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031012014941/http://groups.msn.com/tg4ownsthespottomgirlsfour/ |archive-date=October 12, 2003 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He offered Sevyn Streeter the first spot in the T.U.G./A&M group after she opened for B2K and [[IMx]] at a concert in Orlando, Florida in early 2001. Davida, Ashley, and Keisha fell in line after a series of successful auditions. The name TG4 is short for Tom Girls 4. "We're like four Tom Girls," said Amber, who tied for first place on Showtime at the Apollo when she was 10. "'When you're a girl and you act like a boy, you're a tomboy. We're girls and we act like guys but love being girls, so we're tom girls." The group opened for [[B2K]], [[IMx]] and [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]] for their Scream II Tour, presented an award at the 9th Annual Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards at the [[Pasadena Civic Center District|Pasadena Civic Center]] in [[Pasadena, California]] on August 23, 2003, and performed on [[Soul Train]].

The group's only major single was "Virginity", which peaked at number 88 on the [[United States|US]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/2002-11-09/r-b-hip-hop-songs |title=Billboard Top Music Charts – Music Genre Sales |publisher=Billboard.com |date=November 9, 2002 |access-date=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Their second single from the album was "2 Minutes", which a [[music video]] was filmed for. It failed to chart on [[Billboard Hot 100]]. The group also appeared on the track, "Sexy Boy" on the B2K album ''[[Santa Hooked Me Up]]''. The group parted ways with their original label and their album, ''Time for the New'', was shelved indefinitely. After Davida Williams departed from the group to focus on her acting career, they renamed the group "Tomgirls 4 Eva" and they were signed to Soul Chemistry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://groups.msn.com/tg4ownsthespottomgirlsfour/myinterviewwithtg4snewmanagerkaren.msnw |title=Interview: TG4 owns the spot |publisher=groups.msn.com |access-date=October 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040411190805/http://groups.msn.com/tg4ownsthespottomgirlsfour/myinterviewwithtg4snewmanagerkaren.msnw |archive-date=April 11, 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shortly thereafter, the group disbanded.

Amber was later discovered by [[Rich Harrison]] on MySpace, and signed onto the RichCraft label as Se7en. Amber "Se7en" Streeter signed a deal with [[Jive Records]] and the RichCraft label in 2007 as a member of Rich Harrison's girl group, [[RichGirl]]. The girls released their mixtape on Valentine's Day 2011 ''[[Fall in Love with RichGirl]]''. The group later disbanded after all members of the group pursued solo careers and different endeavors. The group opened for [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]] for her concert tour [[I Am... World Tour]] and toured with [[Mario (American singer)|Mario]] before disbanding. On March 21, 2012, Streeter released a song titled "Red Handed" along with a statement that confirmed her disbandment from the group and revealed that she had signed with [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]]'s CBE imprint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/03/21/new-music-se7en-red-handed/ |title=New Music: Se7en – 'Red Handed' |publisher=Rap-Up.com |date=March 21, 2012 |access-date=March 25, 2012}}</ref>

===2013–15: ''Call Me Crazy, But...'' and ''Shoulda Been There''===
