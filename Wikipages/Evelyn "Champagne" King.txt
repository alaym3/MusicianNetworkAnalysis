==Biography==
Evelyn King was born on July 1, 1960, in [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and raised in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. She is one of eight children. Growing up King's childhood nickname was 'Bubbles'.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-07-16|title=After 30 Years, Evelyn ‘Champagne’ King Still Has Her Pop|url=https://lasentinel.net/after-30-years-evelyn-champagne-king-still-has-her-pop.html|access-date=2021-05-08|website=Los Angeles Sentinel|language=en-US}}</ref> Her uncle [[Avon Long]] had played the part of Sportin' Life in the first Broadway revival of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and worked with [[Lena Horne]] at the [[Cotton Club]]. Her father sang back-up for groups at [[Harlem]]'s [[Apollo Theater]]. Her mother managed a group called Quality Red.

King was discovered as a young woman while working with her mother at [[Philadelphia International Records]] as an office cleaner. Producer Theodore T. Life overheard her singing in a washroom and began coaching her. She was eventually signed to a production deal with Life's Galaxy Productions and a recording contract with [[RCA Records]].<ref>Hogan, Ed. "[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=evelyn "champagne" king|bio=true}} Biography]". ''Billboard''.</ref>

In 1990, King married smooth jazz guitarist Freddie Fox. In 1997, she lost three family members to various illnesses. In 1987 her daughter Johnniea was born with brain damage and other health problems, dying two years later.<ref name="Unsung">''Unsung'' on [[TV One (U.S. TV network)|TV One]]. Season 4, Episode 6. Airdate 7/11/11</ref>

==Career==
At the beginning of her career the name Evelyn King sounded "too grown-up" so the name 'Champagne' was added.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kane|first=Peter-Astrid|date=2018-06-07|title=Champagne for Everyone!|url=https://www.sfweekly.com/topstories/champagne-for-everyone/|access-date=2021-05-08|website=SF Weekly|language=en-US}}</ref> King released her debut album, ''[[Smooth Talk (album)|Smooth Talk]]'', in 1977. It included the song "[[Shame (Evelyn "Champagne" King song)|Shame]]", which is her only top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at #9; the song also reached #7 Soul and #8 on the dance chart. The record was eventually certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]]. Another single from that album, "[[I Don't Know If It's Right]]", peaked at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #7 Soul; it would become her second certified gold single. In 1981, the single "I'm in Love" was released from the same-titled album; it reached #1 on the R&B singles chart and dance chart in August of that year; it also peaked at #40 on the pop chart.

In 1982, King released the album, ''Get Loose''.  It yielded a top twenty pop and #1 Soul hit with the single, "[[Love Come Down]]".  The song also peaked at #1 on the dance chart and reached the [[UK Singles Chart]] top ten, peaking at #7 for three weeks. The follow-up, "Betcha She Don't Love You", peaked at #2 on the Soul chart and #49 on the pop chart. From the mid- to late-1980s, King would continue to chart on the Soul chart, placing eight singles in the Soul top twenty, with three making it to the top ten.

On September 20, 2004, King's "Shame" became one of the first records to be inducted into the  [[Dance Music Hall of Fame]] at a ceremony held in New York's Spirit club.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Return to music==
On August 14, 2007, King released her first studio album in 12 years, ''Open Book''.  It featured the single "The Dance", which peaked at #12 on the [[Hot Dance Club Play]] Chart. In 2011, King also collaborated with deep house producer [[Miguel Migs]], on the track "Everybody", which was included on his album ''[[Outside the Skyline]]''. The single for "Everybody" was released on July 19, 2011.

In 2015, King formed a group with disco vocalists [[Martha Wash]] and [[Linda Clifford]] called [[First Ladies of Disco]].
