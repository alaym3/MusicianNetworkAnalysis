'''Procol Harum''' ({{IPAc-en|'|p|r|oʊ|k|əl|_|'|h|ɑː|r|əm}}) are an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1967. Their best-known recording is the 1967 hit single "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]", one of the few singles to have [[List of best-selling singles|sold over 10 million copies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 – The British Are Coming!

In 2018, the band was honoured by the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] when "A Whiter Shade of Pale" was inducted into the new Singles category.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/04/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_int.html|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame introduces new category for singles|work=cleveland.com|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8333912/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-inducts-songs-born-to-be-wild-louie-louie|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inducts Songs for the First Time, Including 'Born to Be Wild' & 'Louie Louie'|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-05-10}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Origins, The Paramounts, early years and formation (1964–67) ===
[[The Paramounts]], based in [[Southend-on-Sea]], [[Essex]], led by [[Gary Brooker]] and [[Robin Trower]] and including [[Chris Copping]] and [[B. J. Wilson]], scored a moderate British success in 1964 with their version of [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]'s "[[Poison Ivy (song)|Poison Ivy]]", which reached number 35 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/10947/paramounts/|title=PARAMOUNTS {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|publisher=Official Charts Company|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref> Unable to generate any follow-up success, the group disbanded in 1966.<ref name="Strong">{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |year=2000 |title=The Great Rock Discography |edition=5th |publisher=Mojo Books |location=Edinburgh |pages=776–777 |isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref>

The Paramounts were signed to EMI UK for their releases; until one day before Procol Harum linked with EMI UK again, they were called The Pinewoods. A last-minute offer from [[Chris Blackwell]]'s fledgling [[Island Records]] label was rejected by Brooker and band.

In April 1967, Brooker began working as a singer-songwriter and formed Procol Harum with non-Paramounts [[Keith Reid]] (poet), [[Hammond organ]]ist [[Matthew Fisher (musician)|Matthew Fisher]], guitarist Ray Royer and bassist [[David Knights]].<ref name="Strong"/> [[Guy Stevens]], their original manager, named the band after a [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese cat]], which had been bred by Eleonore Vogt-Chapman and belonged to Liz Coombes.{{sfn|Johansen|2000|p=67}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://procolharum.com/young_cat-marcus-gray.htm |title=A shaggy cat story of wondrous complexity and scholarship • Marcus Gray, for BtP |website=Procolharum.com |access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref> The cat's "[[cat fancy]]" name was Procul [[Harun]], Procul being the breeder's prefix.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.procolharum.com/cat_index.htm |title=About the Cat Whose Name the Band Adopted: Illustrated |website=procolharum.com |access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref>

In the absence of a definitive origin, the band's name has attracted various interpretations,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.procolharum.com/doglatin.htm |title=Doglatin |website=procolharum.com |access-date=27 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819052206/http://www.procolharum.com/doglatin.htm |archive-date=19 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> being said to be (incorrect) [[Latin]] for "beyond these things"; the correct Latin would be ''procul hīs''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=procul |title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, prŏcul |website=perseus.tufts.edu |access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref> The name of the band is frequently misspelled; often with "Procul", "Harem", both, or other variations.

=== "A Whiter Shade of Pale", commercial success and debut album (1967) ===
[[File:Procol Harum 1967.png|thumb|The group in late 1967|alt=]]
At [[Olympic Studios]], southwest London, with [[session musician|session]] drummer (and non-Paramount) [[Bill Eyden]], producer [[Denny Cordell]] and [[audio engineering|sound engineer]] Keith Grant, the group recorded "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]", and it was released on 12 May 1967. With a structure reminiscent of [[Baroque music]], a [[Counter-melody|countermelody]] based on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s [[Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068|Orchestral Suite N° 3 in D Major]] played by Fisher's [[Hammond organ]], Brooker's vocals and Reid's lyrics, the single reached No.&nbsp;1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]] chart. It did almost as well in the [[United States]], reaching No.&nbsp;5 on 29 July 1967.<ref name="Strong"/> In [[Australia]], it was No.&nbsp;1 for many weeks, setting a record of 8 weeks in [[Melbourne]].

After "A Whiter Shade of Pale" became a hit, the band set out to consolidate its studio success by touring, with new official drummer [[Bobby Harrison]] added to the line-up; its live debut was opening for [[Jimi Hendrix]] in 1967. The group's follow-up single, "[[Homburg (song)|Homburg]]", with a line-up change of former Paramounts [[B. J. Wilson]] on drums and [[Robin Trower]] on guitar (replacing Harrison and Royer, respectively, who exited to form the band Freedom), reached No.&nbsp;6 in the UK, No.&nbsp;15 in Canada, and No.&nbsp;34 in the US.

The group's [[Procol Harum (album)|eponymous debut studio album]] was recorded between the two hit singles, and was released in early September in the US, but was held back until December 1967 in the UK. A series of singles charted poorly in the US and UK, though rarely both at the same time.

=== Follow-up albums and break-up (1968–77) ===
The band's follow-up album, ''[[Shine On Brightly]]'' was released the following year and saw a greater excursion into [[progressive rock]] stylings. Their third album, ''[[A Salty Dog]]'' (1969), was very popular among fans and their first album to sell well in the UK. The title track in particular gained a good deal of US [[FM radio]] [[airplay]], and the album is now considered a rock classic, appealing to fans of [[The Beatles]], [[The Moody Blues]] and [[Pink Floyd]]. 

The group would have many subsequent personnel changes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.procolharum.com/99/ph_pedigree1b.htm |title=A Graphical Pedigree of Procol Harum (Old Testament) |website=procolharum.com |access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref> the first being Fisher, who produced ''[[A Salty Dog]]'', departing the band soon after its release.<ref name="Strong"/> The line-up for the first three albums was Brooker (piano and lead vocals), Trower (guitar and lead vocals), Fisher ([[organ (music)|organ]] and lead vocals), Knights (bass), Wilson (drums), and Reid (lyricist). Former Paramount [[Chris Copping]] joined on organ and bass in 1970.<ref name="Strong"/> The group appeared at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tobler |first=John |year=1992 |title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |edition=1st |publisher=Reed International Books Ltd |location=London |page=215 |id=CN 5585}}</ref> By 1971, the disparities in style had become too great and, after the release of the fifth album ''[[Broken Barricades]]'', Trower left to form his own [[power trio]] band and was replaced by [[Dave Ball (musician)|Dave Ball]].<ref name="Strong"/> From late 1972 until 1977, the group's guitarist was Mick Grabham.

Procol Harum returned to success on the record charts in the following years with a [[symphonic rock]] sound, often backed by [[symphony orchestra]]s. At this it was one of the first groups to achieve success; ''[[Procol Harum Live: In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra]]'' was a No.&nbsp;5 [[music recording sales certification|gold]] album in the US in 1972, as well as reaching No.&nbsp;48 in Britain. "[[Conquistador (Procol Harum song)|Conquistador]]" (a track from their first album, re-charted for accompaniment by the Edmonton Symphony in 1971) was a [[hit single]] in 1972, getting to No.&nbsp;16 on 29 July 1972 in the US, five years to the date after "Whiter Shade of Pale" peaked at No.&nbsp;5, and No.&nbsp;7 in Canada, whilst reaching No.&nbsp;22 in the UK. Their follow-up album, ''[[Grand Hotel (album)|Grand Hotel]]'', did fairly well, reaching No.&nbsp;21 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in 1973.<ref name="Strong"/>
The album also received a Silver Certification (over 60,000 copies sold) in the United Kingdom.

In 1975, Procol Harum played the final night at the [[Rainbow Theatre (Finsbury Park)|Rainbow Theatre]] in London.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=1998 |title=Guinness Rockopedia |edition=1st |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd. |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/337 337–338] |isbn=0-85112-072-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/337 }}</ref> More personnel changes contributed to declining sales in the later part of the 1970s, with "Pandora's Box" being the final UK [[Top 40|Top 20]] hit in 1975.<ref name="Strong"/> Its parent album ''[[Procol's Ninth]]'' saw a reconnection with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller who both produced and wrote with the band. The band broke up in 1977, after seeing ''[[Something Magic]]'' stall at No.&nbsp;147 in the US Billboard 200 chart.<ref name="Roberts"/> It reunited for a single performance five months later, when "A Whiter Shade of Pale" was named joint winner (along with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]") of the Best British Pop Single 1952–1977 at the [[BRIT Awards]], part of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1977 |title=1977 |website=brits.co.uk |access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref>
The group also had one album, billed as "Liquorice John Death" and had the title "Ain't Nothin' To Get Excited about" with the Paramounts' original lineup reuniting and doing covers of Rock Tunes as well

=== Reformation and the 1990s ===
The band reformed in 1991 with Brooker, Fisher, Trower and Reid (Wilson had died in 1990), and released ''[[The Prodigal Stranger]]'', but sales were modest.<ref name="Roberts"/> After the album's release, a new incarnation of the band, with Brooker and Fisher but not Trower, toured the US and the world for a few years in the first half of the 1990s.<ref name="Strong"/>

In August 1995, Procol Harum played at the [[Cropredy Festival|Cropredy Music Festival]], as guests of [[Fairport Convention]]. They also toured US and UK the same year, performing at several locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.procolharum.com/ph_95-tour.htm |title=1995 tour |publisher=Procol Harum |access-date=2015-08-19}}</ref>

In July 1997, fans arranged the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the success of "A Whiter Shade of Pale", and invited the then-inactive band to play a concert at [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], [[Surrey]].

In late 1999, Brooker promised that "Procol will play in 2000", and in September the band played an open air gig with the New London Sinfonia in [[Guildford]].

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Procol Harum received some attention after the song "In Held Twas in I" appeared on the band [[Transatlantic (band)|Transatlantic's]] debut album.

Since 2001 the band, comprising Brooker, Fisher, [[Geoff Whitehorn]] (guitar), [[Matt Pegg]] (bass) and [[Mark Brzezicki]] (drums), has made several tours of mostly Europe, but also Japan and the US. A 2001 concert in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] was released on DVD in 2002. In 2003 the band released a new studio album, ''[[The Well's on Fire]]'', and appeared at the [[Progman Cometh]] festival in [[Seattle]]. Their concert in London on Friday 12 December 2003, with much of the material from that album, was released on DVD in 2004: ''Live at the Union Chapel''. Fisher left Procol Harum in 2004.

The band resumed a limited touring schedule in 2005, with Josh Phillips replacing Fisher on Hammond, leaving Brooker as the only original performing member. In June 2006 they played at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 2006|Isle of Wight Festival]]. In August they played two outdoor concerts with the [[Danish National Chamber Orchestra|Danish Radio Orchestra]] at Ledreborg Castle in Denmark, which were tele-recorded. An hour-long edit of the show was broadcast on Christmas morning 2008 on Danish Channel DR2 and the full concert was issued on DVD on 11 May 2009 (with six extra tracks from a Danish television recording of the band from 1974).

Later in 2006 they played in [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]] and Denmark, but with [[Geoff Dunn]] replacing Brzezicki on drums, because the latter's other band [[Casbah Club]] was touring with [[The Who]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.procolharum.com/procolgd.htm |title=Geoggrey Dunn |website=procolharum.com |access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref> However, Dunn ended up replacing Brzezicki for the band's European tour in 2007. Recordings from the [[Italy|Italian]] concerts were later released as ''[[One Eye to the Future – Live in Italy 2007]]''. Procol Harum also played an orchestral concert in [[Sweden]] on 30 June. They performed with the Gävle Symphony Orchestra at the outdoor opera venue [[Dalhalla]], near [[Rättvik]].

On 20 and 21 July 2007, fans arranged the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the success of "A Whiter Shade of Pale", and invited the band to play. This took the form of two concerts at St John's, Smith Square in London. 20 July saw Procol Harum play a mixture of songs from their early days through to the début of a couple of new songs, "Sister Mary" and "Missing Persons". The following night 'Gary Brooker and Guests' performed a fixture of obscure songs by Brooker–Reid that had either never been recorded, never been performed live before or were significantly different from the versions they recorded.

Although there was no Procol Harum activity in 2008, their manager Chris Cooke, on the web site [https://web.archive.org/web/20151127071407/http://www.procolharum.com/ Beyond the Pale], announced plans for a live DVD and a new album in 2009, as well as festival concerts in Norway on 17 July and Finland on 23 July.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://procolharum.com/procolnews.htm |title=Procol Harum News |website=procolharum.com |access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref> Just before the latter concert, Brooker fell off a pile of road-side logs in [[Finland]] and broke several ribs. The show went ahead but he was unable to sing properly, and many of the songs were performed either as [[instrumental]]s or sung by others in the band. In October 2009, with Brooker fully recovered, the band performed four concerts &nbsp;– in [[Hagen]] (Germany), [[Drammen]] (Norway), [[Moscow]] and [[St Petersburg]]. ''All This and More'', a four disc retrospective (three CDs and a DVD with historical notes) was released in the autumn of 2009, and Salvo also issued all of the band's previous albums as remastered CDs with extra tracks, some never previously heard.

=== 2010s ===
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}
Procol played a string of US (and [[Toronto]]) concert dates in June 2010, mostly opening for [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]. On 22 July Procol again headlined at the Keitelejazz Festival in [[Äänekoski]], Finland – the venue where the band performed with an injured Brooker in 2009. They described this loyal Finnish audience as "the best in the world" and played a unique three-verse version of "A Whiter Shade of Pale" with a guitar solo from Geoff Whitehorn. 48 hours later Procol were invited to give a free concert at the courtyard of the Palace of the Province of [[Bergamo]] in [[Italy]]. In August 2010 they appeared in [[Bad Krozingen]] in [[Germany]] and a Rock Legends event at the Dolina Charlotty Amphitheater in [[Poland]]. After a Halloween gig in [[Leamington Spa]] (their first in the UK for three years) the band returned to North America in November, including a return orchestral event with the [[Edmonton Symphony Orchestra]] on 9 November. After playing in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] on 18 November, they returned to the US for an orchestral concert in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] on 4 December. Over 13,000 people saw eight New Year concerts with the Danish Radio Orchestra in Copenhagen and other Danish cities in January 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dr.dk/Koncerthuset/Kalender/2011/januar/dr-nytaarskoncerter-med-procol-harum-d15 |language=da |title=DR Nytarskoncerter med Procol Harum |website=dr.dk |date=15 January 2011 |access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref>

On 29 May 2012, Gary Brooker was hospitalised after suffering a fall in his hotel room in [[Cape Town]]. He was due to have performed with his band at GrandWest Arena on the 30th, with fellow Brits [[10cc]] and [[The Moody Blues]], in a tour billed as the 'British Invasion' and then again in [[Johannesburg]] on Friday 1 June 2012. Brooker (whose birthday it was) had been in his room at the five-star Table Bay Hotel. He was admitted to the ICU of the [[Christiaan Barnard]] Memorial Hospital with a serious skull fracture.

The band returned to Denmark for the Kløften Festival on 25 June before embarking on a 27-date U.S. tour supporting [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. In 2012 the Japanese artist [[Yumi Matsutoya]] came to London to record "A Whiter Shade of Pale" with Procol Harum, a band she considered an inspiration for her work. She sang a duet with Gary Brooker on this new version of the 1967 classic, which featured three verses and a guitar solo by Geoff Whitehorn. Yumi and Procol Harum then played a series of December concerts in major Japanese cities, one of which was recorded for a later television showing (on 31 March 2013).

In 2012, Henry Scott-Irvine published a biography of the band, ''Procol Harum – The Ghosts of A Whiter Shade of Pale''. Scott-Irvine also hosted a rare Procol Harum film evening at the BFI on the South Bank, which was attended by members of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.procolharum.com/hsi-procolbook_prom-shindig.htm|title=Henry Scott-Irvine's Procol Harum book • 'Shindig' promo|website=Procolharum.com|access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref>

In March and April 2013, Procol Harum played a series of five orchestral concerts in Denmark and two such events in [[Wuppertal]] in Germany. Four band-only concerts in Sweden & Finland were held in early October.

In September 2012, Procol Harum was among fifteen final nominees for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] Class of 2013 (induction 18 April 2013). In the subsequent election that December, however, the band failed to gain enough votes for election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/04/showbiz/music/rock-roll-hall-fame-nominees/index.html |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees Announced – CNN.com |last=France |first=Lisa Respers |date=4 October 2012 |website=[[CNN.com]] |access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, the band toured again in France, Switzerland, Germany, Canada (Ottawa with orchestra) and the Eastern U.S. The band also played a five-song set at [[Kenney Jones]]' Rock'n'Horsepower charity event at [[Ewhurst, Surrey]] in June, on a bill including [[Alvin Stardust]], [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]], [[Nick Kershaw]], [[Mike Rutherford]], [[Judie Tzuke]] and [[The Who]]. A twin CD, ''Inside & Outside'', was issued with studio tracks from the Chrysalis years and a live CD including new material and performances of tracks from their first four Zonophone albums. On Monday 24 November Procol Harum appeared at the Dominion Theatre in London with the BBC Concert Orchestra and the Crouch End Festival Chorus in an event recorded for broadcast on BBC Radio 2's Friday Night is Music Night on 28 November. Guitarist Geoff Whitehorn was hospitalised during rehearsals and at short notice [[Rick Wakeman]]'s guitarist Dave Colquhoun deputised (on crutches, after a broken ankle). He played a guitar solo in the first extended, orchestrated version of Keith Reid's [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] tribute song "Blink of an Eye", dedicated by Gary Brooker to the brave firefighters of the 8th Avenue station who the band often talked with after gigs in New York.

The band's 13th album, ''[[Novum (album)|Novum]]'', was released on 21 April 2017 and the band played 36 dates in the UK and Europe to promote it. However, the most significant concert of the year came in March when the band played with an orchestra at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London. Whilst leaving the stage at the end of the first half, Gary Brooker fell and was seriously hurt. He reappeared for the second half with his head bandaged and nursing "a broken hand". In 2018 the band again toured in Europe, including an orchestral show at the [[London Palladium]] on 9 October. They commenced 2019 with a Caribbean cruise hosted by [[Justin Hayward]], with many well-known rock acts. A US tour was due to follow.
