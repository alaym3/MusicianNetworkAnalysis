===2014&ndash;2020: Focus on music===

This enabled their music to be mixed and released on the iTunes Store via third party distributor [[TuneCore]].<ref name="westside-wired" /><ref name="pop-stardom">{{cite news|url=http://www.omaha.com/go/next-up-for-omaha-s-jack-jack-pop-stardom/article_438af171-c2f9-5ce7-8f13-ded31a42e321.html|title=Next Up For Omaha's Jack & Jack?
