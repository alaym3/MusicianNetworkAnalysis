Their [[fictional universe]] is presented in music videos, interviews and short cartoons.

Musician [[Damon Albarn]] and comic artist [[Jamie Hewlett]] met in 1990 when guitarist [[Graham Coxon]], a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview [[Blur (band)|Blur]], which Albarn and Coxon had recently formed.<ref name="Elliot">{{cite journal|last=Elliot|first=Paul|date=August 2001|title=FEATURE: Damon and Jamie Interview.

Hewlett initially thought Albarn was "arsey, a wanker;" and despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver.<ref name=Elliot /> Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on [[Westbourne Grove]] in London in 1997.<ref>{{cite journal |first = Chris |last = Heath |author-link = Chris Heath |date=November 2007 |url=http://www.vblurpage.com/articles/stories/q_07.htm |title = The 21 People Who Changed Music: Damon Albarn |journal = [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |page = 87 |access-date =24 April 2017}}</ref> Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with [[Justine Frischmann]] of [[Elastica]].<ref name=Elliot />

The idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were watching [[MTV]]. Hewlett said, "If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell&nbsp;– there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a virtual band, something that would be a comment on that."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/gorillaz.html |title=Keeping It (Un)real|access-date=5 October 2008|first=Neil|last=Gaiman|author-link=Neil Gaiman|date=July 2005|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105225835/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/gorillaz.html|archive-date=5 January 2010|url-status=live}}<!-- Page 2 archive URL: https://www.webcitation.org/5mqkDI6O2?url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/gorillaz.html?pg%3D2%26topic%3Dgorillaz%26topic_set%3D --></ref> Albarn recalled the idea similarly, saying "This was the beginning of the sort of boy band explosion... and it just felt so manufactured.

Although not released under the Gorillaz name, Albarn has said that "one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes" was [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s 1997 single "[[On Your Own (Blur song)|On Your Own]]", which was released for their fifth studio album ''[[Blur (Blur album)|Blur]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/media/s2854145.htm|last1=McDougall|first1=Lindsay|title=Gorillaz's Damon Albarn interview (part 2)|date=23 March 2010|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=12 May 2015}}</ref>

From 1998 to 2000, Albarn recorded for Gorillaz' [[Gorillaz (album)|self-titled debut album]] at his newly opened Studio 13 in London as well as at Geejam Studios in [[Jamaica]].<ref name="Gorillaz">{{cite AV media notes|title=Gorillaz|others=Gorillaz|publisher=[[Parlophone]]|type=CD liner|year=2001|id=7243 531138 1 0}}</ref> The sessions resulted in the band's first release, the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Tomorrow Comes Today]]'', released on 27 November 2000. This EP consisted mostly of tracks which later appeared on the album, and it also included the band's first music video for "Tomorrow Comes Today", which introduced the virtual band members for the first time.

With ''Gorillaz'', Albarn began to branch out into other genres which he had not explored with Blur, such as [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[dub music|dub]] and [[Latin music]], a process he described as liberating: "One of the reasons I began Gorillaz is I had a lot of rhythms I never thought I could use with Blur. A lot of that stuff never really seemed to manifest itself in the music we made together as Blur."<ref name="Gorillaz Interview">{{cite journal|year=2001|title=Gorillaz Interview|url=http://damonalbarnunofficial.blogspot.com/2012/01/gorillaz-interview-2001-q-magazine.html|journal=[[Q magazine|Q]]|access-date=12 July 2020}}</ref>  Albarn originally began work on the album by himself, however eventually invited American hip-hop producer [[Dan the Automator|Dan "the Automator" Nakamura]] to serve as producer on the album, explaining "I called Dan the Automator in after I'd done more than half of it and felt it would benefit from having somebody else's focus. So I just rang him and asked whether he was interested in helping me finish it off."<ref name="Gorillaz Interview"/> Nakamura and Albarn had recently collaborated on ''[[Deltron 3030 (album)|Deltron 3030]]'', the debut album by the [[Deltron 3030|hip-hop supergroup of the same name]] featuring rapper [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] and DJ [[Kid Koala]], both of whom Nakamura recruited to assist in finishing Gorillaz material. Del featured on two tracks on the album, including the lead single "[[Clint Eastwood (song)|Clint Eastwood]]", while Kid Koala contributed turntables to various tracks.<ref name="Gorillaz"/> The album featured additional collaborations with [[Ibrahim Ferrer]] of [[Buena Vista Social Club]], [[Miho Hatori]] of [[Cibo Matto]] and [[Tina Weymouth]] of [[Talking Heads]] and [[Tom Tom Club]], representing a pattern of collaboration with a wide range of artists which later became a staple of Gorillaz as a project.

Hewlett also helmed the design of the band's website, which was presented as an interactive tour of the band's fictional "Kong Studios" home and recording studio, featuring interactive games and explorative elements.<ref>{{cite journal|date=16 March 2001|title=Gorillaz in Our Midst|journal=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Following the release of the album, the band embarked on a [[Gorillaz Live|brief tour]] of Europe, Japan and the United States to support the album in which a live band featuring Albarn played completely obscured behind a giant screen on which Hewlett's accompanying visuals were projected. The virtual band member's voice actors were also present at some shows and spoke live to the audience to give the impression that the fictional band was present on stage. In later interviews, Albarn described the band's first tour as difficult due to the limitations imposed by the band playing behind a screen: "For someone who had just spent the last ten years out front being a frontman [with Blur], it was a really weird experience. And I have to say, some nights I just wanted to get a knife and just cut [the screen] and stick my head through."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gogOkQ2GsuI&t=737s |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 July 2020 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803142949/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gogOkQ2GsuI&t=737s |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album was followed by the B-sides compilation ''[[G-Sides]]'' released in December 2001.

After the success of the debut album, Albarn and Hewlett briefly explored the possibility of creating a Gorillaz theatrical film, but Hewlett claimed the duo later lost interest: "We lost all interest in doing it as soon as we started meeting with studios and talking to these Hollywood executive types, we just weren't on the same page. We said, fuck it, we'll sit on the idea until we can do it ourselves, and maybe even raise the money ourselves."<ref name="Big Issue">{{cite journal|last=Joseph|first=Michael|date=2 November 2006|title=Gorillaz in the Midst|journal=The Big Issue in Scotland|issue=604|page=13}}</ref>

Albarn spent the majority of 2003 on tour with Blur in support of their newly released album ''[[Think Tank (Blur album)|Think Tank]]''; however, upon completion of the tour, he decided to return to Gorillaz, reuniting with Hewlett to prepare for a second album.

Albarn and Hewlett's next project together was the opera ''[[Monkey: Journey to the West]]'' based on the classical Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', which premiered at the 2007 [[Manchester International Festival]]. While not officially a Gorillaz project, Albarn mentioned in an interview that the project was "Gorillaz, really but we can't call it that for legal reasons."<ref>[http://gorillaz-unofficial.com/Jamie08/jamie.html Jamie Hewlett : The Gorillaz-Unofficial 2008 Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqx5KHTW?url=http://gorillaz-unofficial.com/Jamie08/jamie.html|date=17 January 2010}}</ref>

After completing work on ''Monkey'' in late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on a new Gorillaz project entitled ''Carousel'', described by Albarn as being about "the mystical aspects of Britain". Hewlett described ''Carousel'' in a 2008 interview as "even bigger and more difficult than ''Monkey''... It's sort of like a film but not with one narrative story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles. Originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well. Damon's written around 70 songs for it, and I’ve got great plans for the visuals."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://glidemagazine.com/12210/damon-albarn-jamie-hewlett-name-next-project-carousel/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 July 2020 |archive-date=16 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200716051720/https://glidemagazine.com/12210/damon-albarn-jamie-hewlett-name-next-project-carousel/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The ''Carousel'' concept was eventually dropped with Albarn and Hewlett's work evolving into the third Gorillaz studio album ''[[Plastic Beach]]''.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/audio/2009/nov/28/showing-off-damon-albarn|title=Audio: Paul Morley interviews Blur's Damon Albarn|first=Paul|last=Morley|date=28 November 2009|access-date=23 October 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

Following the release of ''DoYaThing'' and the publicization of Albarn and Hewlett's fall-out in 2012, Gorillaz entered a multiyear hiatus.

Albarn chose Khan from a list of possible producers compiled by [[Parlophone]], the band's record label after Albarn and Khan spoke via Skype. ''Humanz'' was also co-produced by [[Remi Kabaka Jr.]], a friend of Albarn's who had worked with him in the non-profit musical organization [[Africa Express (organization)|Africa Express]] and also has been the voice actor for the Gorillaz virtual band member [[Russel Hobbs]] since 2000.<ref name="Inside Track: Gorillaz 'Charger'"/><ref name="imgur.com"/> In conceptualizing the album, Albarn and Khan envisioned ''Humanz'' as being the soundtrack for "a party for the end of the world", with Albarn specifically imagining a future in which [[Donald Trump]] won the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]] as context for the album's narrative (Trump becoming president was still considered an unlikely event at the time of recording), explaining "Let's use that as a kind of dark fantasy for this record, let's imagine the night Donald Trump wins the election and how we're all going to feel that night."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpldsoUROC8&t=1591s |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 July 2020 |archive-date=1 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001200018/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpldsoUROC8&t=1591s |url-status=dead }}</ref> Khan stated that "The idea of Donald Trump being president allowed us to create a narrative together. I suggested that the album should be about joy, pain and urgency. That was to be our state of mind before we even touched a keyboard or an MPC. Especially in American music, dare I say black music, there's a way of communicating joy that at the same time allows you to feel the struggle the person has been through. And the urgency is there because something needs to be done. So that was the mantra. I wanted to blend Damon, a Briton, with the joy and pain and struggle that African-American music can express."<ref name="Inside Track: Gorillaz 'Charger'"/> ''Humanz'' again featured a large cast of featured artists, including [[Popcaan]], [[Vince Staples]], [[DRAM (rapper)|DRAM]], [[Jehnny Beth]], [[Pusha T]], [[Peven Everett]], [[Danny Brown]], [[Grace Jones]] and [[Mavis Staples]], among others. The first track from the album released publicly was "[[Hallelujah Money]]" featuring [[Benjamin Clementine]], released on 20 January 2017 with an accompanying video featuring Clementine. While not an official single, Albarn explained that the band chose to release the track on the day of Trump's [[inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] because "It was meant to be something sung at the imaginary inauguration of Donald Trump, which turned out to be the real inauguration of Donald Trump, so we released it because we had imagined that happening and it did happen."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46UfK7818Hg&t=109s |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 July 2020 |archive-date=3 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200903214011/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46UfK7818Hg&t=109s |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band embarked on the [[Humanz Tour]] to support the album from the summer of 2017 to early 2018. Like the band's previous tour, the Humanz Tour featured the live band in full view of the audience with a large screen behind them displaying Hewlett-created visuals and featured several of the different collaborative artists from the band's history. The tour was preceded by a handful of European warm-up shows, including the first Demon Dayz Festival held on 10 June 2017 at the [[Dreamland Margate]] theme park, a Gorillaz curated music festival which was later repeated in Los Angeles in October 2018.  On 8 June 2017 the band released the non-album single "[[Sleeping Powder]]" with an accompanying music video and on 3 November 2017 a "Super Deluxe" version of ''Humanz'', featuring an additional 14 unreleased tracks from the album's sessions, including alternative versions of previously released songs as well as the single "[[Garage Palace]]" featuring [[Little Simz]].

===''The Now Now'' (2018–19)===
Albarn continued recording while on the road during the Humanz Tour, and mentioned in an interview with ''[[Q Magazine]]'' in September 2017 that he was planning on releasing the material as a future Gorillaz album. Comparing the production of the album to ''The Fall'', which was also recorded while the band was on tour, Albarn mentioned that "It will be a more complete record than ''The Fall'', but hopefully have that spontaneity."<ref name="mixmag.net">{{cite web|title=The Gorillaz might drop a surprise album on us|url=http://mixmag.net/read/the-gorillaz-might-drop-a-surprise-new-album-on-us-news|website=Mixmag|access-date=20 December 2017}}</ref> Albarn signaled his desire to complete and release the album quickly, adding that "I really like the idea of making new music and playing it live almost simultaneously" and "If we're going to do more Gorillaz we don't want to wait seven years because, y'know, we're getting on a bit now.<ref name="mixmag.net"/> The band later debuted a new song "Idaho", which was later included on the album, at a concert in Seattle on 30 September 2017 with Albarn saying it had been written in the days prior.<ref>[https://www.idahostatesman.com/entertainment/article176791296.html] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref>

During a break in the Humanz Tour in February 2018, Albarn returned to London where he worked with producer [[James Ford (musician)|James Ford]], known for his work with [[Arctic Monkeys]] and [[Florence and the Machine]], and Kabaka Jr. to finish the newly written material, resulting in the band's sixth studio album ''[[The Now Now]]'' released on 29 June 2018. Featuring "simple, mostly upbeat songs" and 1980s [[new wave music|new wave]] influences,<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-now-now-mw0003183127|title=The Now Now - Gorillaz|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref> the album was noted for its distinctly small list of featured artists compared to previous Gorillaz work, with only two tracks featuring any outside artists (the album's lead single "[[Humility (song)|Humility]]" featuring [[George Benson]] and "[[Hollywood (Gorillaz song)|Hollywood]]" featuring Snoop Dogg and [[Jamie Principle]]). Albarn mentioned that the few numbers of featured artists was partially due to the album's quick production, which in turn was a result of Albarn wanting to finish the album before the band's touring schedule resumed: "We've been very lucky to be offered all the festivals this year on the back of the last record [''Humanz'']... but I didn't want to do that unless I had something new to work with, so the only option was to make another record really quickly and not have lots of guests on it, because that takes a long time to organize; just do it all myself, really."<ref>{{cite interview|last=Albarn|first=Damon|subject-link=Damon Albarn|interviewer=[[Gordon Smart]]|title=Why Damon Albarn Shunned A Collaboration With Prince|url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/gorillaz/damon-albarn-shunned-prince-collaboration|access-date=11 June 2018|publisher=Radio X|location=London|date=31 May 2018|quote=We've been very lucky to be offered all the festivals this year on the back of the last record&nbsp;... but I didn't want to do that unless I had something new to work with, so the only option was to make another record really quickly and not have lots of guests on it, because that takes a long time to organise; just do it all myself, really.}}</ref> Albarn also explained that with ''The Now Now'' he sought to make a Gorillaz album "where I'm just singing for once" and that the album is "pretty much just me singing, very sort of in the world of [[2-D (character)|2-D]]."<ref>{{cite news|last=Serota|first=Maggie|date=31 May 2018|title=Gorillaz {{em dash}} "Humility" and "Lake Zurich"|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/05/gorillaz-humility-and-lake-zurich/|access-date=1 June 2018}}</ref>

Before the release of ''[[Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez]]'', Gorillaz started a radio show on [[Apple Music]] called ''Song Machine Radio'' where each virtual character has a turn to invite special guests and play some of their favourite tunes.

A few days from the release of ''Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez'', Albarn confirmed that the band already has a song for Season Two of ''Song Machine'' prepared for release, and also mentioned that the second part of the project will be released earlier than expected.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Del Real|first=Andrés|url=https://www.latercera.com/culto/2020/10/18/damon-albarn-nuestra-mayor-crisis-existencial-es-nuestra-relacion-con-internet/|title=Damon Albarn: "Nuestra mayor crisis existencial es nuestra relación con internet"|date=18 October 2020|website=[[La Tercera]]|access-date=23 October 2020}}</ref>

 |quote  = "[Influencing] to us, is the greatest achievement of Gorillaz. It's that we know that a very large percentage of our audience are kids, who go on gorillaz.com, who go on gorillaz-unofficial.com, and through seeing the cartoons and hearing the tune, buying the record, are finding out about this stuff that they knew nothing about. So they're learning about Vlad The Impaler, or Ronald Searle, or The Specials... so it's like an education. They really get into it. And they discover it, the music we grew up on."
