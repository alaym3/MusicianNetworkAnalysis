'''Voyage''' was a French [[disco]] and [[pop music|pop]] [[musical ensemble|group]], consisting of André "Slim" Pezin ([[guitar]]/vocals), Marc Chantereau ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]/vocals), Pierre-Alain Dahan ([[drum kit|drums]]/vocals) and Sauveur Mallia ([[bass guitar|bass]]), together with British [[singing|lead vocalist]] [[Sylvia Mason-James]], who sang on the group's first two albums, ''[[Voyage (Voyage album)|Voyage]]'' (1977) and ''[[Fly Away (Voyage album)|Fly Away]]'' (1978).

For their next two albums, Pierre-Alain Dahan became the lead vocalist on ''Voyage 3'' (1980) and on ''One Step Higher'' (1982), and the group's sound changed from disco to pop.

Before Voyage, Pezin, Chantereau, Dahan and Mallia worked together in a band called V.I.P. Connection in [[1975 in music|1975]] with two disco songs: "Please Love Me Again" and "West Coast Drive", songs known by fans and collectors of early disco music.

They also worked as session musicians or in live performance in France, with artists such as: [[Manu Dibango]], [[Cerrone]], [[Alec R. Costandinos]] & the Synchophonic Orchestra, [[Michel Sardou]] for Slim Pezin; [[Michel Legrand]], Jean Musy, [[Bernard Lavilliers]] for Sauveur Mallia; [[Léo Ferré]], [[Michel Delpech]], [[Guy Béart]] or [[Johnny Hallyday]] for Marc Chantereau; [[Nino Ferrer]], [[Jean-Claude Petit]] and [[Stéphane Grappelli]].

From the late 1960s until the mid 1970s, they were in demand in France, Europe and worldwide, in all styles of music: jazz with Grappelli, French [[chanson]] with Ferré, world music and jazz with Dibango, rock with Hallyday, and French pop with Sardou and Delpech.

Their lone [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] entry was "Souvenirs," which hit No. 41 in 1979.<ref name="Chart">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p14657/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic - Charts & Awards]</ref>  They had more success on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hot Dance Club Play]] [[record chart|chart]], where two of their [[album]]s, ''Voyage'' ([[1978 in music|1978]]) and ''Fly Away'' ([[1979 in music|1979]]), hit [[Chart-topper|number one]].

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the group had three chart [[single (music)|singles]]. A double [[A-side and B-side|A-side]], "From East To West"/"Scotch Machine" (the latter song retitled "Scots Machine" because the term "Scotch" is no longer used in Scotland) reached No. 13 in 1978, while later that  year "Souvenirs" made No. 56. Also popular was the song "Lady America".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

In their home country, France, they were successful in the nightclubs of Paris, and featured on radio and television promoting their songs, but they ranked only three singles, "From East To West" peaked at #20 on May 26, 1978, then "Souvenirs" peaked at No. 53 on January 12, 1979, and "Tahiti - Tahiti" peaked at No. 43 on May 5, 1979.<ref name=infodisc>{{cite web|url=http://www.infodisc.fr/Artistes.php |title=Infodisc - Artistes français (French Artists)|publisher=Infodisc.|access-date=2013-01-12}}</ref> However, the four musicians couldn't replicate their successful French record sales  in the United States. In spite of the quality of their albums, their songs, "I Don't Want To Fall In Love Again" in 1980 and "Let's Get Started" in 1982 failed to chart. As disco went on the wane, they turned to making albums with a more funky sound.

After Voyage, the group members worked separately with a number of singers, including [[Françoise Hardy]], [[Alain Chamfort]], [[Mylène Farmer]], [[Guesch Patti]], [[Jean-Louis Murat]]. Slim worked on the French movie soundtrack [[Betty Blue]] in 1986 and produced a French hit "Caressé Mwen" sung by Marijosé Alie in 1987. Sauveur Mallia worked on several movies soundtracks like ''Moonstruck'' with [[Cher]] in 1987, ''Breakfast of Champions'' with [[Bruce Willis]] in 1999, and was involved in other projects with Chantereau and Dahan.
