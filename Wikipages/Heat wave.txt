A '''heat wave''', or '''heatwave''',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/heatwave|title=heatwave noun - Definition|website=gcunoxfohoarnersdictionaries.com}}</ref> is a period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high [[humidity]], especially in [[oceanic climate]] countries.

The term is applied both to hot weather variations and to extraordinary spells of hot which may occur only once a century. Severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures, thousands of deaths from [[hyperthermia]], and widespread power outages due to increased use of air conditioning. A heat wave is considered [[extreme weather]] that can be a natural disaster, and a danger because heat and sunlight may overheat the human body.  Heat waves can usually be detected using [[forecasting]] instruments so that a [[Alarm device|warning call]] can be issued.

== Definitions ==
A definition based on Frich et al.'s Heat Wave Duration Index is that a heat wave occurs when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by {{convert|5|C-change|0|lk=on}}, the normal period being 1961–1990.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Frich |first= A. |author2=L.V.

A formal, [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] definition from the ''Glossary of Meteorology'' is:<ref name="Glossary of Meteorology">{{cite book |last=Glickman |first=Todd S. |title=Glossary of Meteorology |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=June 2000 |location=Boston |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary |isbn=978-1-878220-49-3 }}</ref>

<blockquote>A period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot and usually humid weather.
: To be a heat wave such a period should last at least one day, but conventionally it lasts from several days to several weeks. In 1900, A. T. Burrows more rigidly defined a "hot wave" as a spell of three or more days on each of which the maximum shade temperature reaches or exceeds {{convert|90|°F|°C|1|abbr=on}}. More realistically, the comfort criteria for any one region are dependent upon the normal conditions of that area.</blockquote>

The [[World Meteorological Organization]], defines a heat wave as five or more consecutive days of prolonged heat in which the daily maximum temperature is higher than the average maximum temperature by 5&nbsp;°C (9&nbsp;°F) or more.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/heat-wave-meteorology|title=Heat wave {{!}} meteorology|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> However, some nations have come up with their own criteria to define a heat wave.

[[Image:Temperature anomalies 2007.gif|thumb|right|Temperature anomalies, March to May 2007]]

In the Netherlands, a heat wave is defined as a period of at least five consecutive days in which the maximum temperature in [[De Bilt]] exceeds {{convert|25|°C|°F}}, provided that on at least three days in this period the maximum temperature in De Bilt exceeds {{convert|30|°C|°F}}. This definition of a heat wave is also used in Belgium and [[Luxembourg]].

In Denmark, a national heat wave (''hedebølge'') is defined as a period of at least 3 consecutive days of which period the average maximum temperature across more than fifty percent of the country exceeds {{convert|28|°C|°F|1}} – the [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] further defines a "warmth wave" (''varmebølge'') when the same criteria are met for a {{convert|25|°C|°F|1}} temperature,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/danmark_faar_varme-_og_hedeboelge |title=Danmark får varme- og hedebølge |language=da |publisher=[[Danish Meteorological Institute]] |date=22 July 2008 |access-date=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723170544/http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/danmark_faar_varme-_og_hedeboelge |archive-date=23 July 2008 }}</ref> while in Sweden, a heat wave is defined as at least five days in a row with a daily high exceeding {{convert|25|°C|°F|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/klimat/varmebolja-1.22372 |title=Värmebölja &#124; Klimat &#124; Kunskapsbanken &#124; SMHI |language=sv |publisher=Smhi.se |access-date=17 July 2013}}</ref>

In Greece, according to the [http://www.hnms.gr/emy/el/ Hellenic National Metereological Service], a heat wave is defined as three consecutive days at or above {{convert|39|°C|°F}} and a minimum temperature in the same period at or over {{convert|26|°C|°F}}, with no winds or with weak winds, and the above conditions being observed in a broad area.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Met Office]] operates a Heat Health Watch system which places each Local Authority region into one of four levels. Heatwave conditions are defined by the maximum daytime temperature and minimum nighttime temperature rising above the threshold for a particular region. The length of time spent above that threshold determines the particular level. Level 1 is normal summer conditions. Level 2 is reached when there is a 60% or higher risk that the temperature will be above the threshold levels for two days and the intervening night. Level 3 is triggered when the temperature has been above the threshold for the preceding day and night, and there is a 90% or higher chance that it will stay above the threshold in the following day. Level 4 is triggered if conditions are more severe than those of the preceding three levels.  Each of the first three levels is associated with a particular state of readiness and response by the social and health services, and Level 4 is associated with more widespread response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/heat-health/ |title=Heat-health watch |publisher=Met Office |date=31 August 2011 |access-date=17 July 2013}}</ref>

== Formation ==
[[File:Heat Wave.jpg|thumb|High pressure in the upper atmosphere traps heat near the ground, forming a heat wave]]Heat waves form when [[High-pressure area|high pressure aloft]] (from {{convert|10000|-|25000|ft|m|abbr=off}}) strengthens and remains over a region for several days up to several weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/hi|title=NWS JetStream - Heat Index|last=US Department of Commerce|first=NOAA|website=www.weather.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> This is common in summer (in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres) as the [[jet stream]] 'follows the sun'. On the equator side of the jet stream, in the upper layers of the atmosphere, is the [[High-pressure area|high pressure area]].

Summertime weather patterns are generally slower to change than in winter. As a result, this upper level high pressure also moves slowly. Under high pressure, the air subsides (sinks) toward the surface, warming and drying [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatically]], inhibiting [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] and preventing the formation of clouds. Reduction of clouds increases [[shortwave radiation]] reaching the surface. A [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] at the surface leads to surface wind from lower latitudes that brings warm air, enhancing the warming. Alternatively, the surface winds could blow from the hot continental interior towards the coastal zone, leading to heat waves there, or from a high elevation towards low elevation, enhancing the subsidence and therefore the adiabatic warming.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Climate |title=A Model Study of Heat Waves over North America: Meteorological Aspects and Projections for the Twenty-First Century |volume=25 |pages=4761–4784 |year=2012 |last1=Lau |first1=N |last2=Nath |first2=Mary Jo|issue=14 |doi=10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00575.1 |bibcode=2012JCli...25.4761L |doi-access=free }}</ref>

In the Eastern United States a heat wave can occur when a [[High-pressure area|high pressure system]] originating in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] becomes stationary just off the Atlantic Seaboard (typically known as a [[Bermuda High]]). Hot humid air masses form over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea while hot dry air masses form over the desert Southwest and northern Mexico. The SW winds on the back side of the High continue to pump hot, humid Gulf air northeastward resulting in a spell of hot and humid weather for much of the Eastern States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heat Index |publisher=Pasquotank County, NC, U.

In the [[Western Cape]] Province of [[South Africa]], a heat wave can occur when a [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] offshore and [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] inland air combine to form a [[Bergwind]]. The air warms as it descends from the Karoo interior, and the temperature will rise about 10&nbsp;°C from the interior to the coast. Humidities are usually very low, and the temperatures can be over 40&nbsp;°C in summer. The highest official temperatures recorded in South Africa (51.5&nbsp;°C) was recorded one summer during a bergwind occurring along the Eastern Cape coastline.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bergwind Info |publisher=1stweather.com |url=http://www.1stweather.com/regional/education/bergwind.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415080019/http://www.1stweather.com/regional/education/bergwind.shtml |archive-date=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Natural Hazards - Heat Wave|publisher=City of Cape Town, South Africa Website|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/DRM/Pages/HeatWave.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608111607/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/DRM/Pages/HeatWave.aspx|archive-date=8 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Health effects ==
{{HeatTable}}
The ''[[heat index]]'' (as shown in the table above) is a measure of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored with the actual air temperature.
[[Hyperthermia]], also known as heat stroke, becomes commonplace during periods of sustained high temperature and humidity. Older adults, very young children, and those who are sick or overweight are at a higher risk for heat-related illness. The chronically ill and elderly are often taking prescription medications (e.g., [[diuretic]]s, [[anticholinergic]]s, [[antipsychotic]]s, and [[antihypertensive]]s) that interfere with the body's ability to dissipate heat.<ref name=fema>{{cite web|title=Extreme Heat |work=FEMA:Are You Ready? |url=http://www.fema.gov/areyouready/heat.shtm |access-date=27 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805063519/http://www.fema.gov/areyouready/heat.shtm |archive-date=5 August 2006 }}</ref>

Heat [[edema]] presents as a transient swelling of the hands, feet, and ankles and is generally secondary to increased [[aldosterone]] [[secretion]], which enhances water retention. When combined with peripheral vasodilation and [[venous stasis]], the excess fluid accumulates in the dependent areas of the extremities. The heat edema usually resolves within several days after the patient becomes acclimated to the warmer environment. No treatment is required, although wearing support stockings and elevating the affected legs will help minimize the edema.

[[miliaria|Heat rash]], also known as prickly heat, is a [[maculopapular rash]] accompanied by acute inflammation and blocked sweat ducts. The sweat ducts may become dilated and may eventually rupture, producing small pruritic vesicles on an [[erythema]]tous base. Heat rash affects areas of the body covered by tight clothing. If this continues for a duration of time it can lead to the development of chronic [[dermatitis]] or a secondary [[bacteria]]l infection. Prevention is the best therapy. It is also advised to wear loose-fitting clothing in the heat. However, once heat rash has developed, the initial treatment involves the application of [[chlorhexidine]] lotion to remove any [[desquamation|desquamated]] skin. The associated itching may be treated with topical or systemic antihistamines. If infection occurs a regimen of [[antibiotic]]s is required.

[[Image:Summer 1936 US Temperature.gif|thumb|right|The [[1936 North American heat wave]]. Record temperatures were based on 112-year records]] [[Heat cramps]] are painful, often severe, involuntary spasms of the large muscle groups used in strenuous exercise. Heat cramps tend to occur after intense exertion. They usually develop in people performing heavy exercise while sweating profusely and replenishing fluid loss with non-electrolyte containing water. This is believed to lead to [[hyponatremia]] that induces cramping in stressed muscles. [[Fluid replacement|Rehydration]] with salt-containing fluids provides rapid relief. Patients with mild cramps can be given oral .2% salt solutions, while those with severe cramps require [[intravenous therapy|IV]] [[isotonicity|isotonic]] fluids. The many [[sport drink]]s on the market are a good source of [[electrolyte]]s and are readily accessible.

[[Heat syncope]] is related to heat exposure that produces [[orthostatic hypotension]]. This hypotension can precipitate a near-syncopal episode. Heat syncope is believed to result from intense sweating, which leads to [[dehydration]], followed by peripheral vasodilation and reduced venous blood return in the face of decreased vasomotor control. Management of heat syncope consists of cooling and rehydration of the patient using [[oral rehydration therapy]] (sport drinks) or isotonic IV fluids. People who experience heat syncope should avoid standing in the heat for long periods of time. They should move to a cooler environment and lie down if they recognize the initial symptoms. Wearing support stockings and engaging in deep knee-bending movements can help promote venous blood return.

Heat exhaustion is considered by experts to be the forerunner of heat stroke ([[hyperthermia]]). It may even resemble heat stroke, with the difference being that the neurologic function remains intact. Heat exhaustion is marked by excessive dehydration and electrolyte depletion. Symptoms may include [[diarrhea]], [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[dizziness]], [[tachycardia]], [[malaise]], and [[myalgia]]. Definitive therapy includes removing patients from the heat and replenishing their fluids. Most patients will require fluid replacement with IV isotonic fluids at first. The salt content is adjusted as necessary once the electrolyte levels are known. After discharge from the hospital, patients are instructed to rest, drink plenty of fluids for 2–3 hours, and avoid the heat for several days. If this advice is not followed it may then lead to heat stroke.

One public health measure taken during heat waves is the setting-up of air-conditioned public cooling centers.

Our concern now is focusing on predicting the future likelihood of heat waves and their severity. In addition, because in most of the world most of those suffering the impacts of a heat wave will be inside a building, and this will modify the temperatures they are exposed to, there is the need to link climate models to building models. This means producing example time series of future weather.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eames |first1=M. |last2=Kershaw |first2=T.

; Underreporting and "Harvesting" effect
The number of heat fatalities is likely highly underreported due to a lack of reports and misreports.<ref name="heat epidemiology"/> Part of the mortality observed during a heat wave, however, can be attributed to a so-called "[[Mortality displacement|harvesting effect]]", a term for a ''short-term forward mortality displacement''. It has been observed that for some heat waves, there is a compensatory decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks after a heat wave. Such compensatory reductions in mortality suggest that heat affects especially those so ill that they "would have died in the short term anyway".<ref name=pmid11401757>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3454704 |pmid=11401757 |pmc=1240305 |jstor=3454704 |title=The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=463–70 |year=2001 |last1=Huynen |first1=Maud M. T. E |last2=Martens |first2=Pim |last3=Schram |first3=Dieneke |last4=Weijenberg |first4=Matty P |last5=Kunst |first5=Anton E }}</ref>

Another explanation for underreporting is the social attenuation in most contexts of heat waves as a health risk. As shown by the deadly [[2003 European heat wave#France|French heat wave]] in 2003, heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Poumadère | first1 = M. | last2 = Mays | first2 = C. | last3 = Le Mer | first3 = S. | last4 = Blong | first4 = R. | year = 2005 | title = The 2003 Heat Wave in France: Dangerous Climate Change Here and Now | url = http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/majorhazards/activites/murcia_26-27oct2009/heatwave2003_poumadere2005.pdf| journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 25 | issue = 6| pages = 1483–1494 | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2005.00694.x | pmid = 16506977 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.577.825 | s2cid = 25784074 }}</ref>

=== Psychological and sociological effects ===
In addition to physical [[stress (biology)|stress]], excessive heat causes psychological stress, to a degree which affects performance, and is also associated with an increase in violent crime.<ref name="heat and stress">{{cite journal |last=Simister |first=John |author2=Cary Cooper |title=Thermal stress in the U.S.A.: effects on violence and on employee behaviour |journal=[[Stress and Health]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=3–15 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1002/smi.1029 }}</ref> High temperatures are associated with increased conflict both at the interpersonal level and at the societal level. In every society, [[crime]] rates go up when temperatures go up, particularly violent crimes such as assault, murder, and rape. Furthermore, in politically unstable countries, high temperatures are an aggravating factor that lead toward civil wars.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hsiang |first1=Solomon |last2=Burke |first2=Marshall |last3=Miguel |first3=Edward |title=Climate and Conflict |journal=Annual Review of Economics |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=577–617 |year=2015 |doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115430 |s2cid=17657019 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c8a494fd49af3e3b5a0988f438ac7dc6f05ed89f }}</ref>

Additionally, high temperatures have a significant effect on income. A study of [[counties in the United States]] found that economic [[productivity]] of individual days declines by about 1.7% for each degree Celsius above {{convert|15|°C|°F}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Solomon |first1=Hsiang |last2=Tatyana |first2=Deryugina |title=Does the Environment Still Matter? Daily Temperature and Income in the United States |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 20750 |date=December 2014 |doi=10.3386/w20750 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Power outages ===
Abnormally hot temperatures can cause electricity demand to increase during the peak summertime hours of 4 to 7 p.m. when air conditioners are straining to overcome the heat. If a hot spell extends to three days or more, however, nighttime temperatures do not cool down, and the thermal mass in homes and buildings retains the heat from previous days. This heat build-up causes air conditioners to turn on earlier and to stay on later in the day. As a result, available electricity supplies are challenged during a higher, wider, peak electricity consumption period.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Heat waves often lead to electricity spikes due to increased air conditioning use, which can create power outages, exacerbating the problem. During the [[2006 North American heat wave]], thousands of homes and businesses went without power, especially in California. In Los Angeles, electrical [[transformer]]s failed, leaving thousands without power for as long as five days.<ref>{{cite news |last=Doan |first=Lynn |author2=Covarrubias, Amanda |title=Heat Eases, but Thousands of Southern Californians Still Lack Power |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=27 July 2006 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-heat27jul27,1,4111447.story |access-date=16 June 2014}}</ref>
The [[Early 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave|2009 South Eastern Australia Heat Wave]] caused the city of [[Melbourne, Australia]] to experience some major power disruptions which left over half a million people without power as the heat wave blew transformers and overloaded a power grid.

=== Wildfires ===
If a heat wave occurs during a drought, which dries out vegetation, it can contribute to bushfires and wildfires. During the disastrous heat wave that [[European heat wave of 2003|struck Europe in 2003]], fires raged through Portugal, destroying over {{convert|3010|km2|sqmi}} or {{convert|301000|ha|acre}} of forest and {{convert|440|km2|sqmi}} or {{convert|44000|ha|acre}} of agricultural land and causing an estimated [[euro|€]]1&nbsp;billion worth of damage.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bell |first=M. |author2=A.

Heat waves cause wildfires.

=== Physical damage ===
Heat waves can and do cause roads and highways to buckle and melt,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23315384|title=When does tarmac melt?|work=BBC News|date=15 July 2013}}</ref> water lines to burst, and power transformers to detonate, causing fires. See the [[2006 North American heat wave]] article about heat waves causing physical damage.

Heat waves can also damage rail roads, such as buckling and kinking rails, which can lead to slower traffic, delays, and even cancellations of service when rails are too dangerous to traverse by trains. Sun kinking is caused when certain types of rail design like short section rails welded together or fish plate rails expand and push on other sections of rail causing them to warp and kink. Sun kinking can be a serious problem in hotter climates like Southern USA and the Middle East, etc.

In the [[2013 heatwave in England]], [[gritter]]s (normally only seen in snow) were sent out to grit melting tarmac roads.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-23379578|title=Gritter used to stop road melting|work=BBC News|date=19 July 2013}}</ref>

== Global warming ==
Climate models reveal that future heat waves will have a more intense geographic pattern.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last1=Tebaldi|first1=Claudia|last2=Meehl|first2=Gerald A.|date=13 August 2004|title=More Intense, More Frequent, and Longer Lasting Heat Waves in the 21st Century|journal=Science|language=en|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=994–997|doi=10.1126/science.1098704|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15310900|bibcode=2004Sci...305..994M|doi-access=free}}</ref> Model results show that areas associated with the severe heat waves in [[1995 Chicago heat wave|Chicago in 1995]] and [[2003 European heat wave|Paris in 2003]] will experience more intense, more frequent, and longer-lasting heat waves in the second half of the 21st century.<ref name=":02" /> Heat waves today in Europe and North America happen parallel to the conditions of atmospheric circulation.<ref name=":02" /> Increased anthropogenic activities causing increased [[greenhouse gas emissions]] show that heat waves will be more severe.<ref name=":02" />

Policy makers, funders and researchers responding to the increasing heatwaves created the [[Extreme Heat Resiliance Alliance|Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance]] coalition under the [[Atlantic Council]] to advocate for naming heatwaves, measuring them, and ranking them to build better awareness of their impacts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance: Reducing Extreme Heat Risk for Vulnerable People|url=https://wcr.ethz.ch/news-and-events/EHRA.html|access-date=2020-09-02|website=wcr.ethz.ch|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The world's getting hotter.

In addition to posing a threat to human health, heat waves significantly threaten agricultural production. In 2019, heat waves in the [[Mulanje]] region of [[Malawi]] experienced temperatures as high as {{cvt|40|°C}}. Heat waves and a late rain season resulted in significant leaf scorching of tea leaves in Malawi, leading to reduced yields.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Malawi heatwaves threaten tea yields and livelihoods – Future Climate Africa|url=https://futureclimateafrica.org/news/malawi-heatwaves-threaten-tea-yields-and-livelihoods/|access-date=2020-09-24|language=en-US}}</ref>

In July 2019, over 50 million people in the United States were present in a jurisdiction with any type of heat advisory. Scientists predicted that in the days following the issuance of these warnings, many records for highest low temperatures will be broken: i.e. the lowest temperature in a 24-hour period will be higher than any low temperature measured before.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rosane |first1=Olivia |title=50 Million Americans Are Currently Living Under Some Type of Heat Warning |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/heat-wave-central-eastern-us-2639217633.html |access-date=19 July 2019 |agency=Ecowatch}}</ref>

[[File:Atlanta thermal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Illustration of urban heat exposure via a temperature distribution map: blue shows cool temperatures, red warm, and white hot areas.]]
The [[2021 Western North America heat wave]] resulted in some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in the region, including {{cvt|49.6|°C}}, the highest temperature ever measured in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Berardelli|first=Jeff|date=2021-06-29|title=Pacific Northwest bakes under once-in-a-millennium heat dome|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heat-wave-dome-2021-seattle-portland-weather/|access-date=2021-06-30|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

A study that investigated 13,115 cities found that extreme heat exposure of a [[wet bulb globe temperature]] above 30 °C tripled between 1983 and 2016. It increased by ~50% when the population growth in these cities is not taken into account. Urban areas and living spaces are often significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas, partly due to the [[urban heat island]] effect. The researchers compiled a comprehensive inventory of past urban extreme heat events.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Henson |first1=Bob |title=Exposure to extreme urban heat has tripled worldwide since the 1980s, study finds |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/11/09/extreme-heat-exposure-urban-climate/ |access-date=15 November 2021 |work=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tuholske |first1=Cascade |last2=Caylor |first2=Kelly |last3=Funk |first3=Chris |last4=Verdin |first4=Andrew |last5=Sweeney |first5=Stuart |last6=Grace |first6=Kathryn |last7=Peterson |first7=Pete |last8=Evans |first8=Tom |title=Global urban population exposure to extreme heat |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=12 October 2021 |volume=118 |issue=41 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2024792118 |language=en |issn=0027-8424}}</ref>
