'''Zwei''' is a Japanese duo formed in 2003 composed of Megu on bass guitar and Ayumu on vocals. 
"Zwei" is the German word for "two", referencing how they are a duo.

== Biography ==
Megu and Ayumu started their career as Zwei in 2004 under [[VAP (company)|VAP, Inc.]] They released their debut single "Movie Star" in May 2004. Since then, the band started developing a techno-rock style with some similarities with [[Depeche Mode]]. In October 2004, they released their debut album ''Pretty Queen''. The following year, they continued releasing singles, and a second album, but in general, the sales of both the albums and the singles was limited. Probably the most popular song of this era was "Dragon", released in July 2005.

In 2007, Zwei officially left VAP and signed on with [[Universal Music Group]]. However, in 2010, the band left Universal and moved to [[5pb.]]. They started singing songs for some of the video games developed by the same company. As a result, the popularity of the band started growing moderately. In 2012, they sang the opening theme for the [[visual novel]] ''[[Robotics;Notes]]'', developed by 5pb. too. The band also sings the opening theme for the [[anime]] adaptation of ''Robotics;Notes''.

In 2013, the duo announced they would be releasing their first album in 8 years, titled "Re:Set," on April 24.

Their song "Last Game" is used as the ending theme to the anime series ''[[Steins;Gate 0 (TV series)|Steins;Gate 0]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-02-13/kanako-itou-zwei-perform-steins-gate-0-anime-theme-songs/.127730 |title=Kanako Itou, Zwei Perform Steins;Gate 0 Anime's Theme Songs |date=February 13, 2018 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |access-date=November 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213205243/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-02-13/kanako-itou-zwei-perform-steins-gate-0-anime-theme-songs/.127730 |archivedate=February 13, 2018 }}</ref>
