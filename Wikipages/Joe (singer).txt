He followed it with a series of successful albums under [[Jive Records]], including ''[[All That I Am (Joe album)|All That I Am]]'' (1997), the international bestseller ''[[My Name Is Joe (album)|My Name Is Joe]]'' (2000) as well as the multi-certified albums ''[[Better Days (Joe album)|Better Days]]'' (2001) and ''[[And Then...]]'' (2003).

The album spawned two singles, "[[Let's Stay Home Tonight (song)|Let's Stay Home Tonight]]", which reached number 18 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and the [[Adult R&B Songs]] chart-topper "[[What If a Woman]]". A critical success, ''Better Days'' became his second album to receive a Grammy nomination in the Best R&B Album category, while "Let's Stay Home Tonight" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance|Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]]. In 2002, Joe did another collaboration with [[Mariah Carey]] on the remix version of "[[Through the Rain]]", the first single from her album ''[[Charmbracelet]]'' (2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459180/.jhtml|title=For the Record: Quick News on Snoop Dogg, Nas, Nelly, Mariah Carey, Godsmack, Whitesnake & More|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|date=December 16, 2002|access-date=July 14, 2018}}</ref>

Kelly]], and [[The Underdogs (production team)|The Underdogs]]. Released in late 2003, ''[[And Then...]]'' reached number 26 on the US ''Billboard'' 200. While Kelly-penned lead single "[[More & More (Joe song)|More & More]]" became a top 20 R&B in the US, it was released on [[double A-side]] with "[[Ride Wit U]]", a collaboration with rap group [[G-Unit]], elsewhere.
