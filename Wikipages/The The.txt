They have been active in various forms since 1979, with singer-songwriter [[Matt Johnson (singer)|Matt Johnson]] being the only constant band member. {{Not a typo|The The}} achieved critical acclaim and commercial success in the UK, with 15 chart singles (seven reaching the Top 40), and their most successful album, ''[[Infected (The The album)|Infected]]'' (1986), spent 30 weeks on the chart. They followed this with the Top Ten albums ''[[Mind Bomb]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dusk (The The album)|Dusk]]'' (1993).<ref>{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|page=555|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years (1977–1981)===
In November 1977, Matt Johnson placed an [[advertising|advertisement]] in ''[[NME]]'', asking for "Bass/lead guitarist into [[The Velvet Underground]]/[[Syd Barrett]]". Johnson later placed a second advertisement in the ''NME'', stating his new influences as "[[The Residents]]/[[Throbbing Gristle]]".

While trying to get his band going, in 1978 Johnson had recorded a demo solo [[album]] (''See Without Being Seen'') which he continued to sell at various underground gigs on cassettes. In 1979, working with Colin Lloyd-Tucker (a friend and colleague at [[De Wolfe Music]], the Soho music publisher/recording studio) Johnson recorded his first album proper, ''Spirits''. This album remains unreleased, although the track "What Stanley Saw" was later licensed to [[Cherry Red Records]] for their ''Perspectives & Distortion'' [[compilation album]], which also featured [[Virgin Prunes]], [[Lemon Kittens]], [[Thomas Leer]], [[Kevin Coyne]] and [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]].

{{Not a typo|The The}} made their debut at London's Africa Centre on 11 May 1979,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.thethe.com/sections/library/gigography/gigography.html |title=This Is {{Not a typo|The The}} Day – Library |publisher=Thethe.com |access-date=2011-04-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717040926/http://www.thethe.com/sections/library/gigography/gigography.html |archive-date=17 July 2011}}</ref> third on the bill to [[Scritti Politti]] and [[PragVEC]], using backing tape tracks that Johnson created at his day job at De Wolfe studios for the drums and bass. The band at this point consisted of Johnson on vocal, electric piano, guitar and tapes and [[Keith Laws]] on synthesiser and tapes. It was Keith Laws who suggested the name '{{not a typo|The The}}' to Matt Johnson.

As {{Not a typo|the The}} was now getting underway, Johnson was simultaneously working with experimental synth-pop combo the Gadgets, a studio group he formed with Colin Lloyd Tucker, his colleague at De Wolfe recording studios.

[[Peter Ashworth]], then known as 'Triash' and later to become a noted photographer, became {{Not a typo|the The's}} drummer in 1980, and Tom Johnston (also managing {{Not a typo|the The}} at this point and later to become a cartoonist for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspapers) was added on bass.<ref>{{cite book

 }}</ref> Although both Ashworth and Johnston were credited with appearing on {{Not a typo|the The's}} debut single ("Controversial Subject"/"Black and White") on [[4AD|4AD Records]], neither actually played on the [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]], which were produced by [[Wire (band)|Wire]] members [[Bruce Gilbert]] and [[Graham Lewis]]. All [[musical instrument|instruments]] were played by Johnson and Laws. Johnston and Ashworth soon dropped out of {{Not a typo|the The}} and returned to their respective day jobs. As a duo (Johnson and Laws), {{Not a typo|the The}} began performing concerts with [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]], [[This Heat]], [[The Birthday Party (band)|the Birthday Party]] and [[Scritti Politti]].

In early 1981 {{Not a typo|the The}} also contributed the composition 'Untitled' to the [[Some Bizzare Album]]. In September of that year Johnson and Laws signed a deal with [[Some Bizzare Records]] and released the 7" single "Cold Spell Ahead". By this stage Matt Johnson had begun playing all the instruments himself so Laws left to pursue his studies, leaving Johnson as a solo artist using a group moniker.

Johnson was signed up later in 1981 to 4AD Records by [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] to record a solo album, ''[[Burning Blue Soul]]''. Although all of the instruments and vocals were performed by Johnson, the album featured various producers including Wire's [[Bruce Gilbert]] and [[Graham Lewis]], Ivo and Johnson himself. Years later, owing to a request from Johnson, it would be re-issued and credited to {{Not a typo|the The}} so all of his albums would be in the same rack together.

Towards the end of 1981, Colin Lloyd-Tucker and [[Simon Fisher-Turner]] joined the band for a series of stripped down {{Not a typo|the The}} acoustic concerts in London.

===The solo years (1982–1987)===
Now freed from the politics of a permanent group line-up, Johnson was able to take {{Not a typo|the The}} up to the next level, and spent the next few years collaborating with a diverse range of creative individuals, freely changing personnel from project to project.

{{Not a typo|The The's}} next single was a retooling of "Cold Spell Ahead", now entitled "Uncertain Smile". Produced in New York by [[Mike Thorne]], it reached No.&nbsp;68 UK. This version is different from the more familiar album version, and featured sax and flute by session player Crispin Cioe rather than (as on the album version) the piano of [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]]'s [[Jools Holland]].

In 1982, the intended debut album by {{Not a typo|the The}} (''The Pornography of Despair'') was recorded, but was never officially mixed nor released.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.interzone23.com/thethe/albums.html {{Not a typo|The The}} Discography – Albums] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107023657/http://www.interzone23.com/thethe/albums.html |date=7 January 2010 }}</ref> Johnson apparently ran off some cassette copies for friends, and several tracks ("Mental Healing Process", "Leap into The Wind", "Absolute Liberation") were subsequently issued as additional tracks on the "This Is the Day" single. "Three Orange Kisses from Kazan" and "Waitin' for the Upturn" (featuring [[Steve James Sherlock]] playing flute and saxophone) also date from this era, and appeared as B-sides.  Some of the previously-mentioned cuts, along with the tracks "The Nature of Virtue" and "Fruit of the Heart" (which were similarly recorded around the same time), appeared as bonus selections on a cassette-only issue of the band's eventual debut album, but ''The Pornography of Despair'' album as a whole remains unissued.

Around 1982 {{Not a typo|the The}} played a series of four concerts at the Marque Club in Wardour Street, Soho, entitled 'An evening of Rock n Roll with {{Not a typo|The The}}'. These concerts were weekly for four weeks and featured [[Marc Almond]] on guitar and vocals.

{{Not a typo|The The}} released their official album debut, the synth-noir classic ''[[Soul Mining]]'', in 1983. It featured the minor UK No.&nbsp;71 hit "[[This Is the Day (The The song)|This Is the Day]]", as well as a new recording of {{Not a typo|the The}} performing "Uncertain Smile". Produced by Johnson and [[Paul Hardiman]], it featured guest appearances from [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]]'s drummer [[Zeke Manyika]], [[Jools Holland]], [[Thomas Leer]] and [[J. G. Thirlwell]] (aka [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]]).

During {{Not a typo|the The's}} more prolific period of releases, from ''Soul Mining'' (1983) to ''Dusk'' (1992), most artwork used on the albums and single releases was produced by Johnson's brother [[Andy Dog Johnson|Andrew Johnson]], using the pseudonym Andy Dog. The artwork has a distinctive style, and sometimes courted controversy, most notably the initial release of the 1986 single "Infected", which featured a masturbating devil and was withdrawn from sale and re-issued with an edited version of the same drawing.

For the 1986 album ''[[Infected (The The album)|Infected]]'', {{Not a typo|the The}} still consisted only of Johnson, but was augmented by session musicians and featured friends such as Manyika and [[Rip Rig + Panic]] singer [[Neneh Cherry]] and [[Anna Domino]]. This album spawned four charting singles in the UK, notably "Heartland", which made the UK Top 30.<ref name=uk/> It was also unusual for having a full-length accompanying film. Costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, ''Infected: The Movie'' was shot on locations in Bolivia, Peru and New York. Different songs were directed by different directors, mainly [[Tim Pope]] and [[Peter Christopherson|Peter 'Sleazy' Christopherson]] (of [[Throbbing Gristle]]).

Throughout 1986-1987 Johnson toured the world extensively with ''Infected: The Movie'', showing the film in cinemas in place of performing live concerts. The film was also shown twice in its entirety on [[Channel 4]] in the UK and on [[MTV]]'s [[120 Minutes]] in the [[United States|US]].

In 1987 Johnson also took some tentative steps back into live performance. Whilst promoting ''Infected: The Movie'' in Australia he had a chance encounter with [[Billy Bragg]], who persuaded him to return to Britain and support [[Red Wedge]], a coalition of like-minded musicians supporting the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in its election campaign. Johnson agreed and enrolled longtime friend and collaborator Manyika to join him in performing shows in London featuring stripped-down versions of political {{Not a typo|the The}} songs such as "Heartland". This experience convinced Johnson to put a band together once again.

===Return to a full band (1988–2002)===
By 1988, {{Not a typo|the The}} was an actual band again, Johnson having recruited ex-[[The Smiths|Smiths]] guitarist [[Johnny Marr]], ex-[[Nick Lowe]] bassist [[James Eller]] and ex-[[ABC (band)|ABC]] drummer [[David Palmer (drummer)|David Palmer]] as fully-fledged members. This line-up, plus guest singer [[Sinéad O'Connor]], recorded the album ''[[Mind Bomb]]'', which debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and featured the band's highest charting single to that time, "The Beat(en) Generation", which peaked at No.&nbsp;18 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=uk/> The first single from ''Mind Bomb'' was actually scheduled to be "Armageddon Days Are Here (again) but with its chorus of "Islam is rising, the Christians mobilising" and sensitivities over the [[Salman Rushdie]] affair that had recently erupted, this song was deemed unsuitable for release by Epic/CBS.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Keyboardist D.C. Collard was added to the official line-up in 1989 (keyboard player [[Steve Hogarth]], who'd played on ''[[Infected (The The album)|Infected]]'', had initially been asked to join but opted instead to become the new lead vocalist of [[Marillion]]). The band embarked on a lengthy world tour in 1989–90 called ''{{Not a typo|the The}} Versus The World''. The live film of the same name, directed by [[Tim Pope]], was filmed during the three nights {{Not a typo|the The}} performed at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] at the end of the tour. Vocalist Melanie Redmond, who had just completed a world tour with Duran Duran, joined the tour during the European leg as a session musician.

The studio EP ''Shades of Blue'' was released in 1990. This included cover versions of [[Fred Neil]]'s "Dolphins" and [[Duke Ellington]]'s "Solitude" as well as a new original song "Jealous of Youth" and a live version of "Another Boy Drowning" from ''Burning Blue Soul''. This and a later EP of remixes, 1993's ''Dis-infected'', were compiled into a 1994 full-length album for the North American market called ''Solitude''.

In 1993, with Johnson, Marr, Collard, Eller and Palmer, [[Some Bizzare Records]]/Epic issued the album ''[[Dusk (The The album)|Dusk]]'', which debuted at No.&nbsp;2 in the UK and spun off three Top 40 singles in the UK,<ref name=uk/> led by "Dogs of Lust". Another world tour followed, the ''Lonely Planet'' tour, at which point the band's line-up was reshuffled; Marr and Eller left, and were replaced by Atlanta-based guitarist Keith Joyner and New York bassist Jared Michael Nickerson after Johnson relocated the band to the U.S. Also added was Boston harmonica player Jim Fitting (formerly of [[Treat Her Right]]), who auditioned in New York in early 1993. <!-- prove it: The version of their hit "This Is The Day" featuring Fitting was often dubbed "''That Was'' The Day".--> Palmer bowed out partway through the tour and was replaced by ex-[[Stabbing Westward]] drummer [[Andy Kubiszewski]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The band headlined the main stage at the 1993 [[Reading Festival]].

Another full-length film, directed by longtime collaborator [[Tim Pope]], was made for this album. ''From Dusk Til Dawn'' was shot in New Orleans and New York, and along with Johnson and Johnny Marr also featured various characters from the New York underground scene such as sexologist [[Annie Sprinkle]], writer and raconteur [[Quentin Crisp]], [[Guardian Angels]] founder [[Curtis Sliwa]], and porn star Rick Savage amongst many carnival characters.

Now permanently relocated to New York, {{Not a typo|the The's}} next project was 1995's ''[[Hanky Panky ({{Not a typo|The The}} album)|Hanky Panky]]'', an album that consisted entirely of [[Hank Williams]] cover tunes. ''Hanky Panky'' was recorded by a new group consisting of Johnson, Collard, Fitting, ex [[Iggy Pop]] guitarist [[Eric Schermerhorn]], ex [[David Bowie]] bass guitarist [[Gail Ann Dorsey]] (billed as "Hollywood" Dorsey), and drummer the "Reverend" [[Brian MacLeod (U.S. musician)|Brian MacLeod]]. Their cover version of "I Saw The Light" hit No.&nbsp;31 UK.Released by Some Bizzare Label / Epic

An experimental album called ''Gun Sluts'' was recorded in 1997, but left unreleased by the band after it was rejected for being too uncommercial by their label.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> {{Not a typo|The The}} severed their eighteen-year relationship with Sony and moved to [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], on [[Trent Reznor]]'s [[Nothing Records]] imprint.

In 2000, {{Not a typo|the The}}, now consisting of Johnson, Schermerhorn, Nashville bassist Spencer Campbell and New Jersey drummer Earl Harvin, released ''[[NakedSelf]]'' and embarked on yet another lengthy world tour, the ''Naked Tour'', this one lasting 14 months. Not counting soundtrack albums, ''[[NakedSelf]]'' remains {{Not a typo|the The's}} final released studio album to date.

This same line-up also recorded two new tracks, "Deep Down Truth", featuring [[Angela McCluskey]] on vocals and "Pillar Box Red". Both songs were produced by [[Clive Langer]] and [[Alan Winstanley]] for the 2002 compilation album ''[[45 RPM: The Singles of {{Not a typo|The The}}]]''

In June 2002 {{Not a typo|the The}} made a sole live appearance at the [[Meltdown Festival]] at London's Royal Festival Hall as guests of [[David Bowie]]. At this point, the band consisted solely of Johnson and longtime friend and collaborator [[J. G. Thirlwell]] aka [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]] on tapes and loops, and young film director [[Benn Northover]] on film and video.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

This was the last live performance by {{Not a typo|the The}} for sixteen years; Johnson had stated on the official {{Not a typo|the The}} website in the FAQ section that "There are no plans for one-off shows or tours in the near future but there will undoubtedly be another {{Not a typo|The The}} tour at some point."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thethe.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10 |title=Thethe.com |publisher=Thethe.com |access-date=2011-04-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717043314/http://www.thethe.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10 |archive-date=17 July 2011}}</ref>

===Hiatus (2003–2017)===
Since 2003, the reclusive Johnson has kept well away from the public eye and has concentrated primarily on soundtrack work, scoring numerous documentaries, films and art installations. {{Not a typo|The The's}} music has featured in a diverse range of cinema over many years, from cult classics such as Jürgen Muschalek's ([[Muscha]]) ''Decoder'' ("Three Orange Kisses From Kazan") and [[Gregg Araki]]'s ''Nowhere'' ("Love is Stronger Than Death") to big-budget epics such as [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s ''Judge Dredd'' ("Darkness Falls"), prompting Johnson's move into film soundtrack composition.

For English director [[Nichola Bruce]] it has included the documentary ''One Man Show: Dramatic Art of Steven Berkoff'' (1995) and a documentary feature film about the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon landings]], ''[[moonbug (film)|Moonbug]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nicholabruce.com/moonbug.html |title=Nicholabruce.com |publisher=Nicholabruce.com |access-date=2011-04-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512163859/http://nicholabruce.com/moonbug.html |archive-date=12 May 2010}}</ref> which was completed in autumn 2010 and won the Special Jury Remi Award for Theatrical Feature Documentary at the 2011 Houston International Film Festival. The soundtrack was released in 2012 as volume 2 in the series of original soundtrack albums produced through Johnson's Cineola imprint.

For Swedish filmmaker Johanna St Michaels this has included ''Best Wishes Bernhard'' (prize winning film of Dokumentär Films Premien Nordic Panorama 2003), ''Snapshots From Reality'' (Nominated for Best International Short at the [[Birds Eye View]] Film festival at London's [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] 2007) ''The Track'' (2007), ''Going Live'' (2008), ''The Island Amid the Worlds'' (2010) and ''Bilder av Dina'' (2010). The latest collaboration between Johnson and St Michaels, ''Penthouse North'' premiered at the [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]] in May 2014.

In June 2009 it was announced that {{Not a typo|the The}} had created an original soundtrack to the Gerard Johnson debut feature film ''[[Tony (2009 film)|Tony]]'', released February 2010 on {{Not a typo|the The's}} Cineola imprint in March 2010, as the first volume of several forthcoming soundtrack and instrumental albums.

In May 2014, {{Not a typo|the The}} completed an original soundtrack for Gerard Johnson's subsequent film, ''Hyena''. Starring [[Peter Ferdinando]], [[Stephen Graham (actor)|Stephen Graham]] and [[Neil Maskell]]. The album was released on 6 March 2015 as the third part in the Cinéola series.

''Je t'aime Infiniment'', a film co-directed by Lebanese filmmaker Corine Shawi and Danish director Nikolaj Bendix Skyum Larsen, was completed in 2010. The latest film collaboration between Johnson and Larsen is ''End of Season'' a Turkish film which premiered at the [[SALT (institution)]] in Istanbul in January 2014.

In May 2007 {{Not a typo|the The}} released a new download-only single on their web site. Entitled "Mrs. Mac", the track is an autobiographical song about Johnson's first day at school as a child in Stratford, East London. All instruments and vocals on the track were performed by Johnson.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web |url=http://billboardpublicitywire.com/releases/2007/5/prweb529230.htm |title=British Band {{Not a typo|The The}} Release 'Mrs Mac' – Their First Single in Over Five Years |publisher=Billboardpublicitywire.com |access-date=2011-04-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070509010520/http://billboardpublicitywire.com/releases/2007/5/prweb529230.htm |archive-date=9 May 2007}}</ref>

A press release was issued along with this track, announcing a forthcoming {{Not a typo|the The}} album called ''The End of the Day'' with various songs from {{Not a typo|the The's}} catalogue being performed by some of Johnson's favourite artists including [[Elysian Fields (band)|Elysian Fields]], [[J.G. Thirlwell]], [[Thomas Leer]], [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]], [[Rob Ellis (producer)|Rob Ellis]], [[John Parish]], [[Anna Domino]], [[Meja]], [[Angela McCluskey]], Ergo Phizmiz, "Rustin Man" aka [[Paul Webb]] among others.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> To date, the album remains a work in progress, although a preview can be heard at the band's official site.

Since 2009, "This Is The Day" has been extensively used in high-profile advertising campaigns for [[Levi's]] Dockers, [[M&M's]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]. It was used as the opening song for the movie [[I Feel Pretty (film)|''I Feel Pretty'']] (2018).

{{Not a typo|The The's}} music continued to appear on British radio and television such as in [[Shane Meadows]] 2010 [[Channel 4]] series ''[[This Is England '86]]'' and in 2013 in the award-winning British sit-com ''[[Fresh Meat (TV series)|Fresh Meat]]''. In 2011 "This Is The Day" was covered by British band [[Manic Street Preachers]].

Matt Johnson has created several new arms of {{Not a typo|the The}}:
* Cinéola; a label specifically created for soundtrack and spoken word releases and which are released as CDs within small, hardback books, complete with photographs and text.
* Radio Cinéola; a 15-minute 'shortwave radio' broadcast downloadable from the official web site and featuring previews of upcoming releases, works in progress, chats with collaborators and, from the vault, previously unheard material. The broadcasts are presented by Johnson and other guests. Shows have so far included contributions from, and collaborations with, musicians [[DJ Food]], Deadly Avenger, Hayley Willis, Thomas Feiner, [[Angela McCluskey]], Colin Lloyd Tucker plus poet John Tottenham, photographer [[Steve Pyke]], actress Marlene Kaminsky, spiritual healer Abdi Assadi and many others. Monthly downloadable Radio Cineola broadcasts ceased at the end of December 2010, although the broadcasts continue at randomly chosen dates.
* Fifty First State Press; a book publishing company whose name is inspired by the chorus of Johnson's 1986 song "Heartland". The first release, in 2012, was ''Tales From The Two Puddings'', a memoir by Matt's dad, Eddie, which recounts the Johnson family's time owning one of East London's most notorious pubs and music houses, the Two Puddings in Stratford. It features many of the legendary customers of this famous pub, such as [[Jackie Charlton]], the [[Kray Twins]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Bobby Moore]], [[Clyde McPhatter]], [[The Who]], [[Daniel Farson]], [[Terry Spinks]] and countless others. <!-- not relevant, put it in Johnson's article: The book has been endorsed by personalities as varied as [[Barrie Keeffe]], [[Iain Sinclair]] and [[Harry Redknapp]]. [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] called it "An unadulterated, honest and affecting account of a time when landlords truly were the aristocrats of the working class."

During this period, Johnson's political activity has been limited to conservation issues in his native east London. He was a founder member of the [[Save Shoreditch]] committee and directed and narrated a short film for its cause. Along with fellow artists such as Brad Lochore, [[Tracey Emin]] and [[Lucinda Rogers]] he has been fighting the eastwards expansion of the [[City of London]] into [[Shoreditch]] and the probable demolition of much of this East London neighbourhood. The day after the London Olympics finished in August 2012 Johnson made a rare public appearance on the [[BBC's]] ''[[Newsnight]]'' current affairs programme, in order to debate with [[Robin Wales]], the Mayor of [[Newham]], about the impact and legacy of the [[Olympic Games]] upon [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], the part of London Johnson grew up in.-->

In the spring of 2014, it was announced by [[Sony Music Entertainment]] that they plan to release a ''Soul Mining 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition Boxset'' in the summer of 2014. The reissue was remastered by Matt Johnson at [[Abbey Road Studios]].

[[Harper Collins]] imprint [[The Friday Project]] announced in the spring of 2014 that they would be publishing the first official biography of {{Not a typo|the The}}. Authored by Neil Fraser, it will apparently{{according to whom|date=October 2018}} have the full cooperation of Matt Johnson.

Johnson told ''Uncut'' magazine in early 2015 that he was starting to write the first new vocal-based {{Not a typo|the The}} album since 2000's ''Nakedself''.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} This has not yet materialised.

===Reformation and new material (2017–present)===

For 2017's [[Record Store Day]], after premiering the song on a Radio Cineola broadcast, {{Not a typo|the The}} released a new 7" record called "We Can't Stop What's Coming", collaborating once again with [[Johnny Marr]]. On 10 September, it was announced that Johnson would be touring as {{Not a typo|the The}} again for the first time in 17 years. Two dates were announced, in Denmark on 1 June 2018 and at [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 5 June 2018. The Royal Albert Hall tickets sold out, with two extra performances added at O2's Brixton Academy and The Troxy, both in London. Several more shows around the UK and Europe were subsequently added, as well as eight shows in the US. {{Not a typo|The The}} also played on 2 & 3 October 2018 in the [[Sydney Opera House]].

The touring announcement came subsequent to {{Not a typo|the The}} announcing a new triple-vinyl limited-edition box set, Radio Cineola: Trilogy, to be released when they kick off their first gigs since 2002. Featuring three albums – ''The End of the Day'', ''The Inertia Variations'', and ''Midnight to Midnight'' – the triple box set package, available for pre-order from 6 October 2017, also came with 48-page bound book which included album lyrics and exclusive photos. ''The End of the Day'' contains interpretations of a selection of {{Not a typo|the The}} songs from singers across the globe and includes {{Not a typo|the The's}} recent single "We Can't Stop What's Coming". ''The Inertia Variations'' features Johnson narrating John Tottenham's epic poetic cycle. "''Midnight To Midnight'' includes interviews and soundscapes taken from Johnson's 12-hour UK Election Day Radio Cineola shortwave broadcast plus the electronic score from ''The Inertia Variations'' documentary," said a spokesperson for the band, speaking to The Quietus.

In January 2021, the soundtrack to the 2019 film ''Muscle'', directed by Gerard Johnson, was released. The first track on this EP was "I Want 2 B U", a new song that was released as a 7" single for Record Store Day 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://post-punk.com/the-the-channels-this-is-the-day-with-new-single-i-want-2-bu/|title=The The Channels "This Is The Day" With New Single: I Want 2 BU"|date=3 September 2020}}</ref>

On 29 October 2021, {{Not a typo|the The}} released ''The Comeback Special'' on Cinéola/earMUSIC, a live album recorded at the Royal Albert Hall gig in 2018. This album was released in a number of formats, including one release with an art book and a film of the performance<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-the-announce-multi-format-project-the-comeback-special-2946235|title=The The announce multi-format project 'The Comeback Special'|date=22 May 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thethe.com/comeback-special-live-royal-albert-hall-2018/|title=THE COMEBACK SPECIAL – LIVE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL IN 2018|date=21 May 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicpopmag.com/2021/05/the-the-announce-the-comeback-special-multi-format-release/|title=The The announce The Comeback Special multi-format release|date=24 May 2021}}</ref>
