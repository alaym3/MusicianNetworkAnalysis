'''The Vibrators''' are a British [[punk rock]] band that formed in 1976.

==Early career==
The Vibrators were founded by Ian '[[Knox (musician)|Knox]]' Carnochan, bassist Pat Collier, guitarist [[John Ellis (guitarist)|John Ellis]], and drummer John 'Eddie' Edwards. They first came to public notice at the [[100 Club]] when they backed [[Chris Spedding]] in 1976. On Spedding's recommendation, [[Mickie Most]] signed them to his label [[RAK Records]]. Most produced their first [[single (music)|single]], "We Vibrate". The band also backed Spedding on his single, "Pogo Dancing".

The Vibrators recorded sessions for [[John Peel]] at [[BBC Radio 1]] in October 1976, June 1977, and February 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/t/thevibrators/| title=BBC - Radio 1 - Keeping It Peel - The Vibrators|access-date=2007-12-03}}</ref>  They were one of the pioneering punk bands that played at London's [[The Roxy (Covent Garden)|Roxy Club]]. They headlined in January 1977, supported by [[The Drones (British band)|the Drones]], and in February they played twice at the venue.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|year=2000|title=20th Century Rock & Roll-PUNK|publisher=Collector’s Guide Publication, Ontario, Canada|pages=61–62|isbn=978-1-896522-27-2}}</ref> In March 1977, the band supported [[Iggy Pop]] on his British tour. Later that year, they backed ex-[[Mott the Hoople]] frontman [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]].

==Epic Records==
The band signed to [[Epic Records]] in early 1977. Their debut album, ''[[Pure Mania]]'' was co-produced with Robin Mayhew, the sound engineer for [[David Bowie]]'s [[Ziggy Stardust Tour|Ziggy Stardust live shows]], and reached the top 50 of the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album is well regarded by some music critics and, 17 years after its release, ''The [[Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]'' named ''Pure Mania'' one of the 50 best punk albums of all time.<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Alternative Rock''|last= Thompson|first= Dave|year= 2000|publisher= Miller Freeman Books|location= San Francisco|isbn= 0-87930-607-6|quote=''Flashes of sheer brilliance (‘Whips & Furs’), weirdness (the many Ramones go down the pub songs), and endearing gaucheness (the perfect pop of ‘Baby Baby’ pummelled by the Stones-whipped lead guitar)''.|page= 710}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r21230|pure_url=yes}} |first=Mark |last=Deming |title= Review of 'Pure Mania' on Allmusic|quote= ''Both Knox and Pat Collier had a genius for writing short, punchy songs with sneering melody lines and gutsy guitar breaks. If the Vibrators were into punk as a musical rather than a sociopolitical movement, it's obvious that they liked the music very much, and on that level their debut album stands the test of time quite well.''}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|title=All Time Top 1000 Albums|publisher=Guinness Publishing, Enfield|isbn=978-0-7535-0258-7|no-pp=true|page=[https://archive.org/details/alltimetop1000al0000lark/page/ Chapter 9]|year=1998|url=https://archive.org/details/alltimetop1000al0000lark/page/}}</ref>

Their follow-up album, ''V2'', narrowly missed the UK top 30. The only single to be taken from that album, "Automatic Lover", was the only Vibrators’ single to reach the [[UK Singles Chart|UK top 40]] where it reached No.&nbsp;35.<ref name="guinness">{{Cite book

The Vibrators’ final single on Epic, "Judy Says (Knock You in the Head)", was released in June 1978. It reached No.&nbsp;70 on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="guinness" /> Years later it was included in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine's list of the best punk rock singles of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=October 2001|title=100 Punk Scorchers|pages=Issue 95}}</ref>

==Later years==
A lack of further chart activity, and with only one UK top 40 single to their credit, saw the Vibrators join the list of [[one-hit wonder]]s; a list that includes other UK punk and [[New wave music|new wave]] acts such as [[the Banned]], [[the Flying Lizards]], [[Graham Fellows|Jilted John]], [[999 (band)|999]], the [[Radio Stars]], and the [[Rich Kids]].

During the 1980s, John Ellis recorded with [[Peter Gabriel]], as well as recording and touring frequently with [[Peter Hammill]], then subsequently [[the Stranglers]], eventually joining the latter full-time in the 1990s. Pat Collier went on to work closely with [[the Soft Boys]], producing their seminal album ''[[Underwater Moonlight]]'', and [[Robyn Hitchcock]], producing and mixing some of his solo albums (to which Knox also sometimes contributed). Phil Ram went on to form Able Ram and brought out two singles, "Disco in Moscow" and "Hope We Make It", although without any chart success.  Despite numerous line-up changes, the Vibrators continued to record and tour as a three-piece, with "Eddie" being the only original member.<ref>{{cite web|first=John J.|last=Moser|title=Concert on final tour of seminal punk band The Vibrators changes venues|date=13 Sep 2018|website=[[The Morning Call]]|url=https://www.mcall.com/entertainment/lehigh-valley-music/mc-ent-the-vibrators-venue-change-20180913-story.html|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref>

In 2020, the original lineup of Knox, Eddie, Ellis and Collier reunited to record and release the studio album ''Mars Casino'' with [[Chris Spedding]] providing production, additional guitar, and vocals.<ref>[https://newnoisemagazine.com/news-the-vibrators-reunite-with-chris-spedding-for-new-album/ News: The Vibrators Reunite with Chris Spedding for New Album].

==Influence==
The band [[Stiff Little Fingers]] took its name from the Vibrators' song of the same title. The song was penned by John Ellis, and appeared on the Vibrators' debut album ''[[Pure Mania]]''.  [[Street punk|Second wave punk]] band [[the Exploited]] covered the Vibrators' song "Troops of Tomorrow" and used it as the title track for their [[Troops of Tomorrow|1982 album]]. A cover of "Troops of Tomorrow" was also recorded by the Polish [[death metal]] band [[Vader (band)|Vader]], and released as a bonus track on the band's 2011 album, ''[[Welcome to the Morbid Reich]]''.
