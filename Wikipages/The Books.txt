'''The Books''' were an American-Dutch duo, formed in [[New York City]] in 1999, consisting of guitarist and vocalist [[Zammuto_(band)|Nick Zammuto]] and cellist Paul de Jong. Their releases typically incorporated [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of obscure sounds and speech.<ref>{{cite web |author=Richardson, Mark |title=Album review: ''The Books - Thought for Food'' |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/854-thought-for-food/ |date=2002-07-23 |work=[[Pitchfork Media]] |publisher= |accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Mintz, Hillary |title=Album review: ''The Books - Thought for Food'' |url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/226 |date=2002-06-11 |work= |publisher=Published by Dusted Magazine |accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> They released three critically acclaimed albums on the German label [[Tomlab]], and released their fourth studio album, ''[[The Way Out (The Books album)|The Way Out]]'', on [[Temporary Residence Limited]] in July 2010.

==History==

===1999–2002: Thoughts and ''Thought for Food''===
Zammuto and de Jong first met in [[New York City]] in 1999 as they shared the same apartment building.<ref name=bostonglobe2>{{cite web |first=James |last=Reed |title=On the search for sounds |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/04/10/on_the_search_for_sounds/?page=2 |work=[[Boston Globe]] website |publisher=Published by [[The New York Times Company]] |date=2009-04-10 |page=Page 2 of 2 |accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> De Jong invited Zammuto to dinner at his apartment, where he played him some of his collection of audio and video samples, including a [[Shooby Taylor]] record.<ref name=nytimeout>{{cite web | author=Ruttenburg, Jay | title=Aural recipe | url=http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/music/70686/aural-recipe | work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out New York]] | publisher= | date=2005-04-28 | accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> Zammuto said of their meeting that "we both kind of knew at that moment that we listened (to music) in interesting ways and had similar approaches to music".<ref name=junkmedia/> Soon after, they began playing what they considered [[pop music]], in comparison to their own works, under the name the Books.<ref name=junkmedia>{{cite web | author=Bolle, Susanna | title=The Books | url=http://www.junkmedia.org/index.php?i=963 | work=Junk Media | date=2004-03-15 | accessdate=2009-06-03 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928100209/http://www.junkmedia.org/index.php?i=963 | archivedate=2011-09-28 }}</ref>

In 2000, the Books started work on their début album ''[[Thought for Food]]''.<ref name=bookswebsite>{{cite web| author1=Paul de Jong| author2=Nick Zammuto| name-list-style=amp| title=About The Books| url=http://www.thebooksmusic.com/news/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729015752/http://www.thebooksmusic.com/news/| url-status=dead| archive-date=2005-07-29| work=The Books' website| accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> Zammuto and de Jong moved often during this time,<ref name=bookswebsite/> recording in New York, [[Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], and finally in the basement of a hostel in [[North Carolina]] where Zammuto worked for a while after hiking the [[Appalachian Trail]].<ref name=junkmedia/><ref name=imposemagazine>{{cite web | author=Sarna, Dan | title=Interview: Nick Zammuto of The Books | url=http://www.imposemagazine.com/interview-the-books/765/ | work=Impose Magazine | date=May 2007 | accessdate=2009-06-03 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608004122/http://www.imposemagazine.com/interview-the-books/765/ | archivedate=2009-06-08 }}</ref> ''Thought for Food'' was released on October 22, 2002.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Books: Thought For Food | url=http://www.hbdirect.com/album_detail.php?pid=546205 | work=HBDirect.com | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2009-06-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Praised by critics for its distinctive sound,<ref>{{cite web | author=Richardson, Mark | title=Album review: The Books - Thought for Food | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r613714|pure_url=yes}} | work=[[Allmusic]] | publisher=Published by [[All Media Guide]] | date= | accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> it featured extensive sampling from obscure sources coupled with mostly acoustic instrumentation.

===2002–2003: ''The Lemon of Pink''===
Shortly after the release of ''Thought for Food'', the band relocated to [[North Adams, Massachusetts]], near where Zammuto had graduated from [[Williams College]] in 1999, studying [[chemistry]] and [[visual arts]].<ref name=siff>{{cite web | title=2008 Keynote speaker: Nick Zammuto | url=http://siffest.com/?q=node/82 | work=Student Independent Film Festival website | publisher= | date= | accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> Zammuto and de Jong began the recording of ''[[The Lemon of Pink]]'' around this time. Anne Doerner, a guest vocalist on the album, said the process was much more arduous than the recording of ''Thought for Food'', with Zammuto working on the album for five straight months.<ref name=junkmedia/>

''The Lemon of Pink'' was released to critical acclaim<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/books/lemonofpink | title=Reviews of ''The Lemon of Pink'' - The Books | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=Published by [[CNET Networks|CNET Networks, Inc.]] | accessdate=2009-06-04 }}</ref> on October 7, 2003.<ref>{{cite web | author=Carr, Daphine | title=Album review: The Books - The Lemon of Pink | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r659623|pure_url=yes}} | work=Allmusic | publisher=Published by All Media Guide | date= | accessdate=2009-06-04}}</ref> It is similar in style to ''Thought for Food'', but oriented more around vocals performed mostly by Anne Doerner.

===2003–2006: ''Lost and Safe'', ''Music for a French Elevator'', ''Prefuse 73 Reads the Books''===
In 2004, the French [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] asked the Books to compose music for a new elevator in their building. The Books released a [[Mini CD]] of this work in 2006, under the name ''[[Music for a French Elevator and Other Short Format Oddities by the Books]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Music for a French Elevator EP | url=http://www.thebooksmusic.com/garage/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050728235123/http://www.thebooksmusic.com/garage/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=2005-07-28 | work=The Books website | accessdate=2009-06-06 }}</ref>

On April 5, 2005, the Books released their third studio album, ''[[Lost and Safe]]''. Zammuto has a greater vocal presence in this album, and the album was criticized for this change of sound.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gaerig, Chris | title=Playing by The Books | url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/playing-books | work=[[Michigan Daily]] | date=2005-04-11 | accessdate=2009-06-24}}</ref> Aside from this, ''Lost and Safe'' was well received by critics.<ref>{{cite web | title=Reviews of ''Lost and Safe'' - The Books | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/books/lostandsafe?q=lost%20and%20safe | work=Metacritic | publisher=Published by CNET Networks, Inc. | date= | accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> Throughout early 2005, the Books collaborated with the electronica artist [[Prefuse 73]]. The Books appear on his album [[Surrounded by Silence (album)|Surrounded by Silence]] ("Pagina Dos"), and the E.P. ''[[Prefuse 73 Reads the Books E.P.]]'' collects remixes of material sourced from the Books' albums.

===2006–2012: Hiatus, ''The Way Out'' and break-up===
Following the release of ''Music for a French Elevator'', the band took a break from recording to tend to their new families, tour in support of their albums, and pursue some of their own projects, which included Zammuto scoring a feature documentary about the [[Biosphere 2]].<ref name=siff/>

In 2007, the Books released ''Play All'', a DVD of thirteen music videos and three previously unreleased tracks.<ref>{{cite web | title=Play All: A DVD of Videos | url=http://www.thebooksmusic.com/garage/bv_play_all.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011211326/http://thebooksmusic.com/garage/bv_play_all.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2007-10-11 | work=The Books website | accessdate=2009-06-04 }}</ref> The ''Play All'' videos are composed of found footage transformed into a collage that matches their music.

The Books toured heavily between 2005 and 2007, including two tours in Europe and two Canadian shows.<ref name=bookswebsite/> In early 2009 the Books covered the [[Nick Drake]] song "Cello Song" in collaboration with [[José González (singer)|José González]] for the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'' fund-raising album.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hall, Tara |title=Jose Gonzalez maps North American jaunt |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/19193.html |work=Livedaily |publisher=Published by Ticketmaster |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529171542/http://www.livedaily.com/news/19193.html |archivedate=2009-05-29 }}</ref>

The Books began working on ''[[The Way Out (The Books album)|The Way Out]]'' in late 2008.<ref name=april5blog/> Zammuto spoke of the album's [[New Age]] themes in an interview in April 2009, saying they took samples from [[self-help]] and [[hypnotherapy]] cassettes. When asked to describe the album, Zammuto said "You're getting verrry sleepy."<ref name=bostonglobe2/> On April 5, 2010, the duo announced that ''The Way Out'' would be released through [[Temporary Residence Limited]] in July.<ref name=april5blog>{{cite web | author=Zammuto, Nick | title=Temporary Residence! | url=http://thebooksmusic.tumblr.com/ | work=The Books' Blog | date=2010-04-05 | accessdate=2010-04-29 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213201718/http://thebooksmusic.tumblr.com/ | archivedate=2010-02-13 }}</ref> On April 27 [[Pitchfork Media]] began streaming the track "Beautiful People",<ref>{{cite web | author=Dombal, Ryan | title=New Books track: "Beautiful People" | url=http://pitchfork.com/news/38626-new-books-track-beautiful-people/ | work=Pitchfork Media | date=2010-04-27 | accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> which Zammuto described as "a three part christian harmony mixed with a sort of euro-disco-trash beat, an orchestra’s worth of sampled brass and lyrics about the [[twelfth root of two]] (my favorite irrational number), [[trigonometry]] and [[tangram]]s".<ref>{{cite web | author=Zammuto, Nick | title=Beautiful People | url=http://thebooksmusic.tumblr.com/ | work=The Books' Blog | publisher=[[Tumblr]] | date=2010-04-28 | accessdate=2010-04-29 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213201718/http://thebooksmusic.tumblr.com/ | archivedate=2010-02-13 }}</ref> The album was released on July 20.

The Books played the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP New York 2010]] music festival in Monticello, New York, in September 2010 and then toured North American tour with [[The Black Heart Procession]]. The band had been chosen by [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] & ATP to perform at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP I'll Be Your Mirror]] festival that they planned to curate in July 2011 at London's Alexandra Palace.<ref>[http://www.atpfestival.com/events/ibymportishead.php ATP: I'll Be Your Mirror London]</ref>

In January 2012, Nick Zammuto announced in an interview via [[Pitchfork Media]] that the Books were splitting up to focus on other projects.<ref name=pitchfork20120126>{{cite web|title=Nick Zammuto Talks About Ending the Books, Starting His New Project|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/45239-nick-zammuto-talks-about-ending-the-books-starting-his-new-project/|publisher=Pitchfork|author=Ryan Dombal|date=26 January 2012}}</ref>

==Musical style==

The Books are commonly cited by critics to be of a genre of their own.<ref>{{cite web | author=Richardson, Mark | title=Album review: The Books - The Lemon of Pink | url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/855-the-lemon-of-pink/ | work=[[Pitchfork Media]] | publisher= | date=2003-10-08 | quote=''The Lemon of Pink'' may sound a bit like this duo's debut, but it also sounds like nobody else.
