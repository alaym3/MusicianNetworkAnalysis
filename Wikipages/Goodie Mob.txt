'''Goodie Mob''' is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. It was formed in 1991 by [[Big Gipp]], [[Khujo]], [[CeeLo Green]], and [[T-Mo]]. In 1995, Goodie Mob released their debut album, ''[[Soul Food (Goodie Mob album)|Soul Food]]'', which was critically acclaimed and certified Gold. The album aired social and political issues such as racism, discrimination, geopolitics, and gentrification. The debut single "[[Cell Therapy (song)|Cell Therapy]]" reached number 39 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the ''Billboard'' [[Rap Songs|Hot Rap Singles]] chart. Goodie Mob is part of the [[Dungeon Family]], a hip hop/R&B musical collective, based in Atlanta, Georgia.

In 1998, Goodie Mob released a second album, ''[[Still Standing (Goodie Mob album)|Still Standing]]''. The album continued the group's style of social commentary, and CeeLo's singing talents were used more frequently. The group's third album, ''[[World Party (album)|World Party]]'', veered away from their gritty style and instead incorporated lighter beats and party related subject matter. During its production, CeeLo left the group to pursue a solo career when he was unhappy with the project's direction. Goodie Mob's fourth album, ''[[One Monkey Don't Stop No Show (album)|One Monkey Don't Stop No Show]]'', was released in 2004 and suffered a poor reception, resulting in Big Gipp also leaving the group. T-Mo and Khujo, as the Lumberjacks, released the album ''[[Livin' Life as Lumberjacks]]'' in 2005.

In 2006, all four members of Goodie Mob performed together following a Gnarls Barkley concert, marking the group's reunion. In 2011, Goodie Mob signed with Elektra Records and worked on a new album, which would eventually become 2013's ''[[Age Against the Machine]]''.

After a seven years gap, they released a new album Survival Kit in November 2020.
