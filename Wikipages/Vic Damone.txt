==Life and work==

===Early life===
[[File:Finbar RCC Benson Av B19 St jeh.jpg|thumb|St Finbar's Church, Brooklyn]]
Damone was born Vito Rocco Farinola in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to Rocco and Mamie (Damone) Farinola, Italian emigrants from [[Bari]], Italy. His father was an electrician and his mother taught piano. His cousin was the actress and singer [[Doretta Morrow]]. Inspired by his favorite singer, [[Frank Sinatra]], Damone began taking voice lessons. He sang in the choir at St. Finbar's Church in [[Bath Beach, Brooklyn]], for Sunday Mass under organist Anthony Amorello.

When his father was injured at work, Damone had to drop out of [[Lafayette High School (New York City)|Lafayette High School]]. He worked as an usher and elevator operator at the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theater]] in Manhattan.<ref name="am">{{cite web|title =Vic Damone: Biography |first=Steve|last=Huey |publisher=AllMusic| url ={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=vic-damone-p12681/biography|pure_url=yes}} |access-date =November 23, 2010}}</ref>

===Career===
Damone met [[Perry Como]] while at the Paramount Theater. Damone stopped the elevator between floors and sang for him. Como was impressed and referred him to a friend for an audition.<ref name="Damone 2009">{{cite book|title=Singing Was the Easy Part|url=https://archive.org/details/singingwaseasypa0000damo/page/67|url-access=registration|last1=Damone|first1=Vic|last2=Chanoff|first2=David|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2009|isbn=978-0-312-35025-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/singingwaseasypa0000damo/page/67 67-69]}}</ref>  

He began his career at the New York radio station WHN when he was 17, singing on the ''Gloom Dodgers'' show, which provided light  entertainment to fans of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. He changed his name at the suggestion of a regular on the show, comedian [[Morey Amsterdam]].<ref name="Eagle 1946">{{cite news |last1=McKeon |first1=Shiela |title=Shop Talk For Manhunters |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/27336175/early_vic_damone_article/ |access-date=18 January 2019 |work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle |date=21 June 1946|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref><ref name="Damone 2009" /> 

Damone entered the talent search on ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' and won in April 1947. This led to his becoming a regular on Godfrey's show. He met [[Milton Berle]] at the studio and Berle got him work at two night clubs. By mid-1947, Damone had signed a contract with [[Mercury Records]].

His first release, "[[I Have But One Heart]]", reached number seven on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart. "You Do" reached the same peak. These were followed by a number of other hits. In 1948, he got his own weekly radio show, ''Saturday Night Serenade''.<ref name="am"/>

He was booked into the [[Mocambo (nightclub)|Mocambo]] nightclub on the [[Sunset Strip]] in 1949, residing briefly at the Strip's famed [[Garden of Allah Hotel]].<ref>''Singing Was the Easy Part'', Vic Damon and David Chanoff, Macmillan, 2009, p. 111</ref> In April 1949 he made his television debut on ''[[The Morey Amsterdam Show]]'' performing [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[So in Love]]". In January 1950 he made his first of several guest appearances on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Toast of the Town]]'', including a duet, the first of many, with the vocalist and future TV hostess [[Dinah Shore]]. Over the next 30 years he became a regular featured guest performer on every major variety series on network television. Among the programs on which he appeared are ''[[Four Star Revue|All Star Revue]]'', ''[[Texaco Star Theatre]]'' with [[Milton Berle]], ''[[The Arthur Murray Party]]'', ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'', ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'', ''[[Perry Como|The Perry Como Show]]'', ''[[The Bell Telephone Hour]]'', ''[[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show]]'', ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'', ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', ''[[Jack Paar|The Jack Paar Program]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'', ''[[Mickie Finn's (TV series)|Mickie Finn's]]'', ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'', ''[[The Jonathan Winters Show]]'', ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', ''[[Della Reese|Della]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and several [[Bob Hope]] television specials.

In 1951, Damone appeared in two movies, ''[[The Strip (1951 film)|The Strip]]'', where he played himself, and ''[[Rich, Young and Pretty]]''. From 1951 to 1953, he served in the [[United States Army]], but before going into the service he recorded a number of songs that were released during that time. He served with future Northwest Indiana radio personality Al Evans and country music star [[Johnny Cash]]. After leaving the service, he married the Italian actress [[Pier Angeli]] (Anna Maria Pierangeli) in 1954 and made two movies, ''[[Deep in My Heart (1954 film)|Deep in My Heart]]'' and ''[[Athena (film)|Athena]]''. In 1955 he played the Caliph in ''[[Kismet (1955 film)|Kismet]]''. In 1960, he played an effective dramatic role in the war film ''[[Hell to Eternity]]''.

In 1955, Damone had one song on the charts, "Por Favor", which did not make it above number 73. However, he did have major roles in two movie musicals, ''[[Hit the Deck (1955 film)|Hit the Deck]]'' and ''[[Kismet (1955 film)|Kismet]]''. In early 1956, he moved from Mercury to [[Columbia Records]], and had some success on that label with hits such as "[[On the Street Where You Live]]" (from ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', his final pop top 10) and "[[An Affair to Remember (Our Love Affair)|An Affair to Remember]]" (from [[An Affair to Remember|the movie of the same name]]). His six original albums on Columbia between 1957 and 1961 were ''That Towering Feeling'', ''Angela Mia'', ''Closer Than a Kiss'', ''This Game of Love'', ''On the Swingin' Side'', and ''Young and Lively''.
[[File:Peggy Lee Harold Arlen Vic Damone 1961.JPG|thumb|180px|Damone with composer [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Peggy Lee]], 1961]]
In 1961, he was released by Columbia. Moving over to [[Capitol Records]], he filled the gap left by Frank Sinatra's leaving to help found [[Reprise Records]]. He lasted at Capitol only until 1965; however, he recorded some of his most highly regarded albums there, including two which made the ''Billboard'' chart, ''Linger Awhile with Vic Damone'' and ''The Lively Ones'', the latter with arrangements by [[Billy May]], who also arranged another of Damone's Capitol albums, ''Strange Enchantment''. Other original Capitol albums included ''My Baby Loves to Swing'', ''The Liveliest'', and ''On the Street Where You Live''.

Damone did limited acting on television in the early 1960s. He played Stan Skylar in the 1960 episode "Piano Man" of [[CBS]]'s ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]''. He was cast as Jess Wilkerson in the 1961 episode "The Proxy" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] series ''[[The Rebel (American TV series)|The Rebel]]'', starring [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]]. In 1962, he played the crooner Ric Vallone in the episode "Like a Sister" on the CBS sitcom ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', during which he sang "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World". In the summers of 1962 and 1963, Damone hosted a television variety series on NBC called ''The Lively Ones'', which showcased current jazz, pop, and folk performers, as well as comedians. His group of musical guests over two seasons included [[Count Basie]], [[Louie Bellson]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Chris Connor]], [[Matt Dennis]], [[Frances Faye]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Buddy Greco]], [[Woody Herman]], [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]], [[Stan Kenton]], [[Gene Krupa]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Nellie Lutcher]], [[Shelly Manne]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Ruth Olay]] and [[Oscar Peterson]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Damone's other notable television work during this time included three guest appearances from 1963 to 1964 on CBS's ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''. He also guested on UK television, among other programs on ''The Tommy Cooper Hour'' Christmas special in 1974. In addition to his solo performances, Garland and he sang duet medleys of songs from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', ''[[West Side Story]]'' and ''Kismet''.

In 1964, he sang "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]" before the [[Indianapolis 500]] car race.<ref>Recording of 1964 Indy 500, Indianapolis Radio Network, May 30, 1964</ref>

In 1965, Damone next moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]] with the albums ''You Were Only Fooling'' and ''Country Love Songs''. On Warner Bros., he had one top 100 chart hit: "You Were Only Fooling (While I Was Falling In Love)". The next year, he switched record labels again, moving to [[RCA Victor]] and releasing the albums ''Stay with Me'', ''Why Can't I Walk Away'', ''On the South Side of Chicago'', and ''The Damone Type of Thing''. In 1967, Damone hosted ''The Dean Martin Summer Show'', which was rerun in 1971. In 1969, he released his last US chart record, a cover of the 1966 song "To Make A Big Man Cry", which made the ''Billboard'' Easy Listening chart.

Also in 1965, he appeared on the Firestone album series, ''Your Favorite Christmas Music, Volume 4'', singing "It Came Upon A Midnight Clear" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas".

===Later career===
In 1971, Damone started playing Las Vegas casinos as a performer, and although he had to declare bankruptcy in the early 1970s, he earned enough as a casino performer to clear up his financial difficulties. He extended his geographical range, touring through the United States and the [[United Kingdom]], and as a result of his popularity, decided to record some albums again for RCA. In the UK, he appeared on [[Tommy Cooper]]'s ''Christmas Special'' television show in 1974.

In 1972, he was offered the role of Johnny Fontane in ''[[The Godfather]]'' after singer [[Al Martino]], who was previously given the role by producer [[Albert S. Ruddy]], had the role stripped when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] became director and awarded the role to Damone.<ref name="VF">{{cite web |title=The ''Godfather'' Wars |author=Mark Seal |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/03/godfather200903 |date=March 2009 |access-date=July 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714155852/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/03/godfather200903.print |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live|author-link=Mark Seal}}</ref> According to Martino, after being stripped of the role, he went to [[Russell Bufalino]], his godfather and a crime boss, who then orchestrated the publication of various news articles that claimed Coppola was unaware of Ruddy giving Martino the part.<ref name="VF" /> Damone eventually dropped the role because he did not want to provoke the mob or Frank Sinatra, whom Damone profoundly respected, in addition to being paid too little.{{sfn|Jones|2007|p=50}}<ref name="VF" /><ref name="Santopietro 2012">{{cite book|last=Santopietro|first1=Tom|title=The Godfather Effect: Changing Hollywood, America, and Me|publisher=Macmillan|year=2012|isbn= 978-1-4299-5262-0|page=159}}</ref> Ultimately, the part of Johnny Fontane was given to Martino.<ref name="VF" />

Damone appeared in a [[Diet Pepsi]] commercial first aired during [[Super Bowl XXV]] in January 1991. Damone and other stars, including [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]], [[Charo]] and [[Bo Jackson]], attempt to sing Diet Pepsi's theme song, "You've Got the Right One Baby (Uh-Huh)", which was performed by [[Ray Charles]].

His final album was issued in 2002, with other albums being repackaged and re-released. In 2003, Vic decided to release some previously unreleased material and formed Vintage Records with his son, Perry Damone. He planned to release a 7 CD series called The Vic Damone Signature Collection, and in May 2003 released Volume 1, produced by Perry and Frank Sinclair. In May 2004, Vic released his second CD in the Signature Series, again produced by his Perry and Sinclair, and decided to limit the collection to the two CDs released. He recorded over 2,000 songs over his entire career. He garnered new fans following the 2002 launch of the Vic Damone website www.vicdamone.com, created by Perry and Sinclair, and ultimately managed by his son-in-law William "Bill" Karant.

One of his final public performances was on January 19, 2002, at the [[Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. Damone suffered a stroke the same year and subsequently retired.<ref name="palmbeachpost.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/entertainment/music/legendary-singer-vic-damone-loved-the-art-not-the-/nMNgm |title=Legendary singer Vic Damone loved the art, not the biz |website=Palmbeachpost.com |date=June 29, 2009 |access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref> Damone did, however, step out of retirement on January 22, 2011, when he once again performed at the Kravis Performing Arts Center in Palm Beach, to a sold-out crowd. Damone dedicated this performance to his six grandchildren, who had never seen him perform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vicdamone.com/news_updates.html|title=News and Updates|website=Vicdamone.com|access-date=January 22, 2011}}</ref> Damone stated that "I don't need the money&nbsp;... But, you know, my six grandkids have never seen me on stage. It will be the first time. I will introduce them. It's going to be exciting for me. Before I die, I want them to have heard me perform at least once".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwd.com/eye/people/the-magic-of-vic-damone-3436779/|title=The Magic of Vic Damone|first=David|last=Moin|date=January 21, 2011|access-date=November 20, 2016}}</ref>

In [[Brett Ratner]]'s movie ''[[Money Talks (1997 film)|Money Talks]]'', [[Chris Tucker]]'s character sees a commercial about Vic Damone and then pretends to be Damone's son. At the time, Vic's real-life son, Perry, had some laughs about that "15 minutes of fame," and made mention of it on his midday radio show on Phoenix radio station KEZ.

On June 12, 2009, Vic Damone released his autobiography titled ''Singing Was the Easy Part'' from [[St. Martin's Press]]. In the book, Damone claimed he had been held dangling out of a window of a New York hotel by a "thug". Damone claimed he had been engaged to the thug's daughter, but ended the relationship when she insulted Damone's mother. He wrote that his life was spared when, during a Mafia meeting to determine the singer's fate, New York mob boss [[Frank Costello]] ruled in Damone's favor.<ref name="Damone 2009" />  

In 2010, Damone called Canadian crooner [[Michael Bublé]] talented but "cocky" and criticized him for smoking and drinking "straight alcohol" after a show, believing that it would damage his vocal cords. Bublé responded by saying that he knew what he was doing, but promising that from now on he would always mix his alcohol with soda or orange juice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/side-dishes-michael-buble-responds-vic-damone-calls-crooner-talented-cocky-article-1.171733 |title=Side Dishes: Michael Bublé defends self against 'cocky' label |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=March 13, 2010 |access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref>

In 2020 Damone appeared in one of a series of interviews for the documentary ''[[Jay Sebring....Cutting to the Truth]]''.

==Personal life==
Damone suffered a stroke in 2002 and another health scare in 2008. He recovered from both, and lived until 2018.<ref name="palmbeachpost.com" /> Damone was married five times and divorced four:
# [[Pier Angeli]] (1954–1958), actress, singer (one son – Perry Damone, 1955–2014)

# Rena Rowan-Damone (1998–2016), fashion designer, businessperson, philanthropist

Damone had six grandchildren from his daughters (Tate, Paige, Sloane, Rocco, Daniella, Grant).

Damone's first wife, Pier Angeli, was previously in a well-publicized relationship with [[James Dean]], but was forced to leave him to marry Damone, a move that garnered great media attention.<ref>{{cite book|last=Donnelley|first=Paul|title=Fade to Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries|publisher=Omnibus|year=2003|page=55|isbn=0-7119-9512-5}}</ref> It was reported that Dean had watched the wedding from across the road on his motorcycle, even gunning the engine during the ceremony, although Dean later denied doing anything so "dumb". Six years after divorcing Angeli, Damone was arrested on October 15, 1964 on Angeli's charge that he had kidnapped their 9‐year‐old son Perry (named for [[Perry Como]]) and taken him from New York to Los Angeles. He was released three hours later after having pled not guilty to being a fugitive from a kidnapping charge. At the same time, a California judge awarded him custody of Perry.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/10/15/vic-damone-is-arrested-but-wins-preliminary-fight.html|title=Vic Damone Is Arrested But Wins Preliminary Fight|date=October 15, 1964|website=nytimes.com|access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name="kinney">{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/2000/062900.html|title=Bahai News - Music, faith can guide us, a singer believes|website=Bahai-library.com|date=June 29, 2000 |access-date=November 26, 2016}}</ref> However, Angeli would ultimately gain custody of Perry and left Hollywood for her native Italy, taking Perry with her.<ref name="kinney" /> Perry would however return to California after Angeli's death.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.broadwaytovegas.com/October20,2002.html|title=Love triangle biopic news to next of kin|website=broadwaytovegas.com|date=October 20, 2002|access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref> Perry died of [[lymphoma]] aged 59, on December 9, 2014.<ref name="FHTimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhtimes.com/obituaries/perry-damone/article_b7269152-904f-11e4-89cf-0ff1fa836751.html|title=Perry Damone|website=fhtimes.com|date=December 30, 2014|access-date=November 26, 2016}}</ref>

He married actress Diahann Carroll in 1987. The union, which Carroll admitted was turbulent, had a legal separation in 1991, reconciliation, and divorce in 1996.

Damone was raised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and served as an altar boy, claiming to have never found deep meaning in his original faith.<ref name="palmbeachpost.com" /> In the late 1950s, he was introduced to the [[Baháʼí Faith]] by a drummer in his band. Damone said his rendition of "On the Street Where You Live" incorporates gestures meant to summon a sustaining vitality from [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]].<ref name="kinney" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/Long%20Island%20City%20NY%20Star%20Journal/Long%20Island%20City%20NY%20Star%20Journal%201960/Long%20Island%20City%20NY%20Star%20Journal%201960%20-%202032.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&u=ffffffffc3b60e4a&DocId=4168067&Index=Z%3a\Index%20U-F-P&HitCount=2&hits=1d+1e+&SearchForm=C%3a\inetpub\wwwroot\Fulton_New_form.html&.pdf |title=Singer Damone - A New Man|work= Long Island Star-Journal |date=March 30, 1960 |publisher=Fultonhistory.com |access-date=February 10, 2013}}</ref> He officially joined the religion in the early 1960s.
