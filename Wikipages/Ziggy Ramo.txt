'''Ziggy Ramo Burrmuruk Fatnowna''', known professionally as '''Ziggy Ramo''', is an [[Indigenous Australian]] singer, songwriter and activist.

==Early life==
Ziggy Ramo Burrmuruk Fatnowna was born to an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Solomon Islander]] father and a mother of [[Scottish heritage]] in [[Bellingen, New South Wales]] and brought up across [[Arnhem Land]] and [[Perth, Western Australia]].<ref name="QandA">{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/qanda/ziggy-ramo/12545250|title=QandA Ziggy Ramo|website=ABC|date=13 August 2020|access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref>

Ramo Burrmuruk Fatnowna moved to Perth when he was six years old and began pursuing music in his mid-teens, the social messaging of classic US hip-hop resonating with him. After graduating from school, he  embarked on a Pre-Medicine degree, determined to advocate for Indigenous health, before switching back to music, aiming to represent Indigenous Australian perspectives in rap.<ref name="NME2020">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/ziggy-ramo-debut-album-black-thoughts-black-lives-matter-2697470|title=Ziggy Ramo is the Indigenous rapper who made 2020’s most important Australian album – five years ago|website=NME|date=29 June 2020|access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Ziggy Ramo performs at Adelaide Festival 2021 wearing a variation of the Australian aboriginal flag.jpg|thumb|Ziggy Ramo wears a custom variation of the Aboriginal flag while performing at Adelaide Festival 2021]]
In 2015, Ramo completed his debut album ''Black Thoughts''; an album that incisively addressed colonial dispossession, systemic racism and intergenerational trauma. Yet he worried that non-Indigenous Australia wasn't ready to engage with his truth-telling, so he shelved the album. Instead, in 2016, an EP of the same name was released.<ref name="NME2020"/>

The EP spawns the singles "Black Thoughts"<ref name="BlackThoughtsSingle"/> and "Black Face".<ref name="BlackFace"/>

Following the [[murder of George Floyd]] in [[Minneapolis]] on 25 May 2020, and the subsequent global [[Black Lives Matter]] protests against police brutality, Fatnowna decided to "rush release" the album saying "It was just still so relevant".<ref name="NME2020"/>

In August 2020, Ramo performed the album live at [[Sydney Opera House]] as part of its ''From Our House to Yours'' weekly program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/digital/season/music/ziggy-ramo.html|title=Ziggy Ramo at SOH |website=Sydney Opera House|access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref> In March 2021 Ramo was the headline artist at the [[Adelaide Festival of the Arts|Adelaide Festival]]'s hip hop finale concert which featured an all-indigenous line-up of artists. Other performers included [[Jimblah]], [[JK-47]] and J-Milla.

==Influences==
Ramo lists his musical influences including [[Lauryn Hill]] and [[Yasiin Bey]] and Aboriginal activists such as [[Charles Perkins (Aboriginal activist)|Charlie Perkins]] and [[Gary Foley]].<ref name="QandA"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/ziggy-ramo|title=Ziggy Ramo JJJ Unearthed|website=ABC Triple J Unearthed|access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref>
