A key player during the formative years of British [[jazz fusion]], [[psychedelia]] and [[progressive rock]], Wyatt's own work became increasingly interpretative, collaborative and politicised from the mid 1970s onwards. His solo music has covered a particularly individual musical terrain ranging from covers of [[pop music|pop]] [[single (music)|singles]] to shifting, amorphous song collections drawing on elements of [[jazz]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[nursery rhyme]].

Wyatt retired from his music career in 2014, stating "there is a pride in [stopping], I don’t want [the music] to go off."<ref name="uncutdec2014">{{cite news|title=Robert Wyatt: "I've stopped making music"|url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/news/robert-wyatt-i-ve-stopped-making-music-2683/|access-date=18 February 2020|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|issue=211|date=December 2014}}</ref> He is married to English painter and songwriter [[Alfreda Benge]].

==Early life==
Wyatt was born in [[Bristol]]. His mother, [[Honor Wyatt]], was a journalist with the [[BBC]], and his father, George Ellidge, was an [[Industrial Psychology|industrial psychologist]]. Honor Wyatt was a cousin of [[Woodrow Wyatt]], whose political stance influenced Robert in joining the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].<ref>O'Dair, Marcus (2014). Different Every Time (1st ed.). London: Serpents Tail. pp. 20–22</ref> Wyatt had two half-brothers from his parents' previous marriages, Honor Wyatt's son, actor [[Julian Glover]],<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theatrerecord.org/Archives/2004/archive15-2004.html |title=Prompt Corner |author=Ian Shuttleworth |magazine=[[Theatre Record]] |year=2004 |access-date=10 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309011315/http://www.theatrerecord.org/Archives/2004/archive15-2004.html |archive-date=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all |author-link=Ian Shuttleworth }}</ref> and George Ellidge's son, press photographer [[Mark Ellidge]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calyx-canterbury.fr/mus/wyatt_robert.html |title=Robert Wyatt |publisher=Calyx: The Canterbury Music Website |access-date=10 January 2016}}</ref> His parents' friends were "quite bohemian", and his upbringing was "unconventional".<ref name=Nickson>{{cite web |url=http://disco-robertwyatt.com/images/Robert/interviews/Discoveries_1998/index.htm |last=Nickson |first=Chris |title=Going Back a Bit - An Alternative History of Robert Wyatt |work=Discoveries |date=December 1998 |access-date=11 January 2016}}</ref> Wyatt said "It seemed perfectly normal to me. My father didn't join us until I was six, and he died ten years later, having retired early with multiple sclerosis, so I was brought up a lot by women."<ref name=Nickson/> Wyatt attended the [[Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys]], Canterbury<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neo-romantic.org.uk/ent-wyatt.html|title=Encyclopedia of British Neo-Romanticism|publisher=Neo-romantic.org.uk|access-date=10 January 2016}}</ref> and as a teenager lived with his parents in [[Lydden]] near [[Dover]], where he was taught drums by visiting American [[jazz]] drummer George Neidorf. It was during this period that Wyatt met and became friends with expatriate Australian musician [[Daevid Allen]], who rented a room in Wyatt's family home.

In 1962, Wyatt and Neidorf moved to [[Majorca]], living near the poet [[Robert Graves]]. The following year, Wyatt returned to England and joined the [[Daevid Allen Trio]] with Allen and [[Hugh Hopper]]. Allen subsequently left for France, and Wyatt and Hopper formed [[the Wilde Flowers]], with [[Kevin Ayers]], [[Richard Sinclair]] and [[Brian Hopper]]. Wyatt was initially the drummer in the Wilde Flowers, but following the departure of Ayers, he also became lead singer.

==Soft Machine and Matching Mole==
[[File:Robert Wyatt 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|Wyatt on [[VPRO|VPRO-TV]], September 1967]]
In 1966, the Wilde Flowers split into two bands—[[Caravan (band)|Caravan]] and the [[Soft Machine]]—and Wyatt, along with Mike Ratledge, was invited to join [[Soft Machine]] by [[Kevin Ayers]] and [[Daevid Allen]]. Wyatt both drummed and shared vocals with Ayers, an unusual combination for a stage rock band.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> In 1970, after chaotic touring, three albums and increasing internal conflicts in Soft Machine, Wyatt released his first solo album, ''[[The End of an Ear]]'', which combined his vocal and multi-instrumental talents with tape effects.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> A year later, after becoming increasingly unhappy about his musical ideas being rejected by the others, Wyatt left Soft Machine.<ref name=":0"/> He participated in the [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] bigband [[Centipede (band)|Centipede]],<ref name=":0"/> and performed at the [[JazzFest Berlin]]'s New Violin Summit, a live concert with violinists [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], [[Don "Sugarcane" Harris]], [[Michał Urbaniak]] and Nipso Brantner, guitarist [[Terje Rypdal]], keyboardist [[Wolfgang Dauner]] and bassist [[Neville Whitehead (bassist)|Neville Whitehead]],<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r39965|label=New Violin Summit}}</ref> formed his own band [[Matching Mole]] (a pun, "machine molle" being French for 'Soft Machine'), a largely instrumental outfit that recorded two albums.<ref name=":0"/>

===Accident===
Matching Mole gradually disbanded, and Wyatt began writing material that would eventually appear on his second 'solo' album in Venice. He began to assemble a new band in England to record these numbers, but on 1 June 1973, during a birthday party for [[Gong (band)|Gong]]'s [[Gilli Smyth]] and June Campbell Cramer (also known as [[Lady June]]) at the latter's [[Maida Vale]] home, an inebriated Wyatt fell from a fourth-floor window.<ref name=Johnson>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview-robert-wyatt-the-only-way-is-up-when-youve-hit-rock-bottom-1241992.html | title = Interview with Robert Wyatt | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | last = Johnson | first = Phil | date = 30 September 1997 | access-date = 14 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=Cumming>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/22/popandrock2 | title = 'I've no idea what's next' | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | last = Cumming | first = Tim | date = 22 September 2003 | access-date = 14 November 2019}}</ref> He was [[paraplegia|paralysed from the waist down]] and has used a [[wheelchair]] for mobility ever since. On 4 November that year, [[Pink Floyd]] performed two benefit concerts, in one day, at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], supported by Soft Machine, and compered by [[John Peel]]. The concerts raised a reported £10,000 for Wyatt.

In a [[BBC Radio 4]] profile aired in 2012, Wyatt revealed that he and his wife [[Alfreda Benge]] were also given generous help by friends of Benge's, including supermodel [[Jean Shrimpton]], who gave them a car, and actress [[Julie Christie]], who gave them use of a flat in London, which they subsequently purchased from her. In the same interview, Wyatt also observed that, ironically, his accident probably saved his life – although he did not drink at all when he was younger, he quickly fell into a pattern of heavy drinking while touring the US in the late 1960s supporting [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], and that he often caroused with heavy-drinking colleagues like [[Mitch Mitchell]], [[Noel Redding]] and especially [[Keith Moon]] (who introduced him to the practice of alternating shots of [[tequila]] and [[Southern Comfort]]). By his own estimation, he was an alcoholic by the early 1970s, and he felt that, had the accident not intervened to change his lifestyle, his heavy drinking and reckless behaviour would have eventually killed him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n11cz|title=BBC Radio 4 - The Voices of..., Robert Wyatt|website=BBC|access-date=2 January 2019}}</ref>

==Solo career==
The injury led Wyatt to abandon the Matching Mole project, and his rock drumming (though he would continue to play drums and percussion in more of a "jazz" fashion, without the use of his feet). He promptly embarked on a solo career, and with musician friends (including [[Mike Oldfield]], [[Ivor Cutler]] and [[Henry Cow]] guitarist [[Fred Frith]]) released his solo album ''[[Rock Bottom (album)|Rock Bottom]]'' on 26 July 1974.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> The album had been largely composed prior to Wyatt's accident, but during Wyatt's convalescence, he rethought the arrangements to adjust to his new circumstances, and many of the lyrics were completed during this period.<ref name=":0"/> The album was met with mostly positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|last=Powers |first=Jim |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r22326 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Rock Bottom – Robert Wyatt: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |date=1 June 1974 |access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=wyatt |title=CG: wyatt |publisher=Robert Christgau |access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/classic-album-robert-wyatt-rock-bottom-domino-963827.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327103810/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/classic-album-robert-wyatt-rock-bottom-domino-963827.html |archive-date=27 March 2010 |title=Classic Album: Robert Wyatt, Rock Bottom (Domino) – Reviews, Music – The Independent |url-status=dead |access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-robertwyatt.com/images/Robert/interviews/Mojo2005/index.htm |title=The MOJO Interview – Mojo N° 144 – November 2005 – A Robert Wyatt discography |publisher=Disco-robertwyatt.com |date=1 June 1973 |access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref>

Two months later Wyatt put out a single, a [[cover version]] of "[[I'm a Believer]]", which hit number 29 in the UK chart.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> Both were produced by Pink Floyd drummer [[Nick Mason]]. There were strong arguments with the producer of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' surrounding Wyatt's performance of "I'm a Believer", on the grounds that his use of a wheelchair "was not suitable for family viewing", the producer wanting Wyatt to appear on a normal chair. Wyatt won the day and "lost his rag but not the wheelchair". A contemporary issue of ''[[New Musical Express]]'' featured the band (a stand-in acting for Mason), all in wheelchairs, on its cover. Wyatt subsequently sang lead vocals on Mason's first solo album ''[[Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports|Fictitious Sports]]'' (1981), a suite of songs composed by American jazz musician [[Carla Bley]].

His follow-up single, a reggae ballad remake of [[Chris Andrews (singer)|Chris Andrews]]'s hit "[[Yesterday Man]]", again produced by Mason, was eventually given a low-key release, "the boss at Virgin claiming that single was 'lugubrious', the delay and lack of promotion denting Wyatt's chances of a follow-up hit."<ref>Quote taken from the liner notes of Wyatt's ''EPs'' boxset.</ref>

Wyatt's next solo album, ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'' (1975), produced by Wyatt apart from one track produced by Mason, was more jazz-led, with [[free jazz]] influences.<ref name=":0"/> Guest musicians included [[Brian Eno]] on guitar, synthesizer and "direct inject anti-jazz ray gun". Wyatt went on to appear on the fifth release of Eno's [[Obscure Records]] label, ''Jan Steele/John Cage: Voices and Instruments'' (1976), singing two [[John Cage|Cage]] songs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jan Steele / John Cage – Voices And Instruments|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jan-Steele-John-Cage-Voices-And-Instruments/release/349087|publisher=[[Discogs.com]]|access-date=6 September 2012}}</ref>

Throughout the rest of the 1970s Wyatt guested with various acts, including [[Henry Cow]] (documented on their ''[[Concerts (Henry Cow album)|Concerts]]'' album), [[Hatfield and the North]], [[Carla Bley]], Eno, [[Michael Mantler]],<ref name=":0"/> and [[Roxy Music]] guitarist [[Phil Manzanera]], contributing lead vocals to lead track "Frontera", from Manzanera's 1975 solo debut ''Diamond Head''. In 1976 he was featured vocalist on Mantler's settings of the poems of [[Edward Gorey]], appearing alongside [[Terje Rypdal]] (guitar) [[Carla Bley]] (piano, clavinet, synthesizer), [[Steve Swallow]] (bass) and [[Jack DeJohnette]] (drums) on the album ''The Hapless Child and Other Stories''.<ref name=":0"/>

His solo work during the early 1980s was increasingly politicised, and Wyatt became a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].<ref name=":0"/> In 1983, his original version of [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Clive Langer]]'s [[Falklands War]]-inspired song "[[Shipbuilding (song)|Shipbuilding]]",<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Shipbuilding |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01r0g4h |access-date=18 March 2013 |series=Soul Music |station=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=5 March 2013 }}</ref> which followed a series of political cover-versions (collected as ''[[Nothing Can Stop Us (album)|Nothing Can Stop Us]]''), reached number 35 in the UK Singles Chart,<ref name="UK Chart stats">{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/The%20Crown |title=The Official Charts Company – Robert Wyatt – Shipbuilding |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=6 November 2010}}</ref> having reached number 2 in [[John Peel]]'s [[Festive Fifty]] for 1982-released tracks.<ref name=":0"/> In 1984 Wyatt provided guest vocals, along with [[Tracey Thorn]] and Claudia Figueroa, on "Venceremos (We Will Win)", a song expressing political solidarity with Chilean people suffering under [[Pinochet]]'s military dictatorship, released as a single by UK soul-jazz dance band [[Working Week (band)|Working Week]], also included on their debut album released the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/working-nights-mw0001269384|title=Working Nights - Working Week &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|via=www.allmusic.com}}</ref>

In 1985 Wyatt released ''[[Old Rottenhat]]'', his first album of original songs since ''[[Rock Bottom (album)|Rock Bottom]]''.<ref name=":0"/> The album featured strongly political songs with relatively sparse arrangements played largely by Wyatt alone.

In the late 1980s, after collaborations with other acts such as [[News from Babel]], [[Scritti Politti]], and Japanese recording artist [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], he and his wife [[Alfreda Benge]] spent a sabbatical in Spain, before returning in 1991 with a comeback album ''[[Dondestan]]''. His 1997 album ''[[Shleep]]'' was also praised.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

In 1999 he collaborated with the Italian singer [[Cristina Donà]] on her second album ''[[Nido (album)|Nido]]''. In the summer of 2000 her first EP ''[[Goccia]]'' was released and Wyatt made an appearance in the video of the title track.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Wyatt contributed "Masters of the Field", as well as "The Highest Gander", "La Forêt Rouge" and "Hors Champ" to the soundtrack of the 2001 film ''[[Le Peuple Migrateur|Winged Migration]]''. He can be seen in the DVD's Special Features section, and is praised by the film's composer [[Bruno Coulais]] as being a big influence in his younger days.

In June 2001, Wyatt was curator of the [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]] festival, and sang "[[Comfortably Numb]]" with David Gilmour at the festival. It was recorded on Gilmour's DVD ''[[David Gilmour in Concert]]''.

In January 2003, [[BBC Four]] broadcast ''Free Will and Testament'', a programme featuring performance footage of Wyatt with musicians Ian Maidman, Liam Genockey, [[Annie Whitehead]] and Janette Mason, and interviews with John Peel, Brian Eno, Annie Whitehead, Alfie and Wyatt himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8a7871cc|title=Free Will and Testament Robert Wyatt (2003)|website=BFI|access-date=17 January 2019}}</ref> Later in 2003, the [[Mercury Music Prize]] nominated album ''Cuckooland'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/robert-wyatt-3-1362046|title=ROBERT WYATT - IT'LL BE A 'DISGRACE' IF I WIN MERCURY PRIZE|last=NME|date=22 July 2004|website=NME|access-date=17 January 2019}}</ref>

In 2004 Wyatt collaborated with [[Björk]] on the song "Submarine" which was released on her fifth album ''[[Medúlla (album)|Medúlla]]''. He sang and played cornet and percussion with [[David Gilmour]] on Gilmour's album ''[[On an Island]]'', and read passages from the novels of [[Haruki Murakami]] for [[Max Richter (composer)|Max Richter]]'s album ''Songs from Before''. In 2006 Wyatt collaborated with [[Steve Nieve]] and [[Muriel Teodori]] on the opera ''[[Welcome to the Voice]]'' interpreting the character 'the Friend', both singing and playing pocket trumpet.

Wyatt released ''[[Comicopera]]'' in October 2007 on [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]], who went on to re-release ''Drury Lane'', ''[[Rock Bottom (album)|Rock Bottom]]'', ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'', ''[[Nothing Can Stop Us (album)|Nothing Can Stop Us]]'', ''[[Old Rottenhat]]'', ''[[Dondestan]]'', ''[[Shleep]]'', ''EPs'' and ''[[Cuckooland]]'' on CD and vinyl the following year. In 2009 he appeared on the album ''Around Robert Wyatt'' by the French Orchestre National de Jazz.<ref>Chris Jones (5 May 2009). [[BBC]] [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/nvqv review of ''Around Robert Wyatt'']. Retrieved on 22 June 2009.</ref>

Wyatt was one of the guest editors of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme, working on the 1 January 2010 programme.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8405000/8405859.stm | work=BBC News | title=Today guest editors 2009 | date=10 December 2009 | access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> Among other things he advocated greater prominence for amateur choirs, and admitted to a preference for them over professional choirs "because there's a greater sense of commitment and meaning in their singing."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8411000/8411234.stm "''Today'': Monday 14 December 2009"], BBC Radio 4 page, at 08.23</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8406000/8406457.stm "Your choir on ''Today''"] BBC Radio 4 page, 14 December 2009</ref>

October 2014 saw the release of ''Different Every Time: The Authorised Biography of Robert Wyatt'' by [[Marcus O'Dair]]. In promotion of the book Wyatt appeared at ''[[The Wire (magazine)|the Wire]]''{{'s}} "Off the Page" festival in Bristol on 26 September, and at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on 23 November. A companion compilation album, ''Different Every Time – Ex Machina / Benign Dictatorships'' was released on 18 November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/56668-robert-wyatt-announces-double-album-of-rarities-and-collaborations-different-every-time/|title=Robert Wyatt Announces Double Album of Rarities and Collaborations, Different Every Time|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|first=Molly|last=Beauchemin|date=11 September 2014|access-date=17 October 2014}}</ref>

Wyatt performed the soundtrack to [[Jimmy McGovern]]'s 2014 BBC production, ''[[Common (film)|Common]]''.

In an interview with ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine in December 2014, Wyatt announced that he had "stopped" making music. He cited age and greater interest in politics as his reasons.<ref name="uncutdec2014" />

In January 2015 Wyatt's biography ''Different Every Time'' was featured as [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Book of the Week]]'', abridged by Katrin Williams and read by [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04xxrfl |title=BBC Radio 4 - Book of the Week, Different Every Time |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-01-10 |access-date=2015-03-04}}</ref>

==Influence on other artists==
The [[Tears for Fears]] song "[[I Believe (Tears for Fears song)|I Believe]]" from their 1985 album ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' was originally written by bandmember [[Roland Orzabal]] for Wyatt, and is dedicated to him. As a further tribute to Wyatt, on the B-side of the single, Orzabal performs a cover version of "Sea Song", from the ''[[Rock Bottom (album)|Rock Bottom]]'' album. This recording later appeared on the compilation album ''[[Saturnine Martial & Lunatic]]'' and the remastered versions of ''Songs from the Big Chair''.

"Sea Song" was also covered by [[The Unthanks|Rachel Unthank and the Winterset]] on their 2007 album ''[[The Bairns (album)|The Bairns]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s David Peschek said of the cover: "That’s the best version of that I’ve ever heard".<ref>{{cite news|last=Peschek|first=David|title=Interview: David Peschek meets Rachel Unthank and the Winterset|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/14/folk|access-date=27 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 September 2007|location=London}}</ref> In November 2011, [[The Unthanks]] released a live album, ''[[The Songs of Robert Wyatt and Antony & the Johnsons]]'', and Wyatt is quoted on the cover of the album as saying "I love the idea. It makes me happy just thinking about it."

[[Dev Hynes]] credited Wyatt's album, ''Old Rottenhat'' as an influence on the song, "Take Your Time" from Hynes' 2018 album (as Blood Orange), ''[[Negro Swan]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/song-by-song/blood-oranges-dev-hynes-breaks-down-every-song-on-his-new-album-negro-swan/ |title=Blood Orange's Dev Hynes Breaks Down Every Song on His New Album, ''Negro Swan'' |magazine=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |last=Torres |first=Eric |date=23 August 2018 |access-date=17 October 2018}}</ref>

==="Wyatting"===
The verb "Wyatting" appeared in some blogs and music magazines to describe the practice of playing unusual tracks, in particular songs from Wyatt's album ''[[Dondestan]]'', on a pub jukebox to annoy the other pub goers. Wyatt was quoted in 2006 in ''The Guardian'' as saying "I think it's really funny" and "I'm very honoured at the idea of becoming a verb."<ref>{{cite news |author=Ned Beauman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/10/popandrock |title=Wyatting (vb): when jukeboxes go mad |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 July 2006 |access-date=19 May 2009 | location=London}}</ref> When asked if he would ever try it himself, he said: "I don't really like disconcerting people, but even when I try to be normal I disconcert anyway."<ref>{{cite news |author=Tim Adams |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/10/popandrock |title=Robert Wyatt, Comicopera |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |date=16 September 2007 |access-date=19 May 2009 | location=London}}</ref> However, Alfreda Benge said it made her angry "that Robert should be used as a means of clever dicks asserting their superiority in pubs ... It's so unlike Robert, because he's so appreciative of the strengths of pop music. So that, I think, is a real unfairness. The man who coined it, I should like to punch him in the nose."<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Dair|first1=Marcus|title=Different Every Time|date=2014|publisher=Serpents Tail|location=London|isbn=9781846687594|pages=309–310|edition=1st}}</ref>
