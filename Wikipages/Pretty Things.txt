'''The Pretty Things''' were an [[England|English]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]], formed in September 1963 in [[Sidcup]], [[Kent]]. They took their name from [[Willie Dixon]]'s 1955 song "[[Pretty Thing]]". A pure [[rhythm and blues]] band in their early years, with several singles charting in the United Kingdom, they later embraced other genres such as [[psychedelic rock]] in the late 1960s (with 1968 ''[[S.F. Sorrow]]'' being one of the first [[rock opera]]s), [[hard rock]] in the early 1970s and [[new wave music|new wave]] in the early 1980s. Despite this, they never managed to recapture the same level of commercial success of their early releases.

==History==
===1962–1964: Formation===
The Pretty Things were preceded by Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys, which consisted of [[Dick Taylor]], fellow [[Sidcup Art College]] student [[Keith Richards]], and [[Mick Jagger]], among others. When [[Brian Jones]] was recruiting for his own band, all three joined Brian and Ian Stewart and were dubbed "[[The Rolling Stones|Rollin' Stones]]" by Jones in June 1962. Because there were too many guitar players in the band, Taylor switched to bass. He quit the Stones five months later, when he was accepted at the [[Central School of Art and Design]] in London. [[Phil May (singer)|Phil May]], another Sidcup student, convinced him to form a new band.<ref name="ALLMUSIC">{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-pretty-things-mn0000489676/biography |title=The Pretty Things &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=16 July 2015}}</ref><ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book

They recruited [[John Stax]] on bass, [[Brian Pendleton]] on rhythm guitar, and Pete Kitley on drums.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=1993/4}}</ref> Kitley was soon replaced by Viv Andrews, also known as Viv Broughton.<ref>[http://willy-rock.blogspot.co.uk/2009/09/pretty-things-philippe-de-barge-acetate.html "The Pretty Things / Philippe de Barge acetate 1968"], Willy-rock.blogspot.co.uk, 27 September 2009.</ref>

A fellow student at the Art College where May and Taylor studied, [[Bryan Morrison]], was recruited as their manager. Morrison was to manage them for the rest of the 1960s, building his own Bryan Morrison Agency. This agency represented [[Pink Floyd]] among many other bands. Forming a partnership with songwriter Jimmy Duncan, he got the Pretty Things a recording contract with [[Fontana Records]] in early 1964.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> At this point, Viv Andrews was replaced by [[Viv Prince]], a more experienced drummer who had played with [[Carter-Lewis and the Southerners]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

===1964–1966: Early career===
[[File:Pretty Things op Schiphol. Vlnr John Stax (basgitarist), Viv Prince (drummer), , Bestanddeelnr 917-6655.jpg|thumb|Pretty Things in 1965]]
The Pretty Things' early material consisted of hard-edged [[blues]]-[[rock music|rock]] influenced by [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Jimmy Reed]]. Their first three singles appeared in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1964 and 1965: "[[Rosalyn (song)|Rosalyn]]" No. 41, "[[Don't Bring Me Down (Pretty Things song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]" No. 10, and the self-penned "Honey I Need" at No. 13.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book|title=The Great Rock Discography|last=Strong|first=Martin C.|publisher=Mojo Books|year=2000|isbn=1-84195-017-3|edition=5th|location=Edinburgh|pages=769–770}}</ref><ref name="ALLMUSIC"/> They never had a [[hit record|hit]] in the United States, but had considerable success in their native United Kingdom and in Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands. Their appearance and behaviour was provocative, with May claiming to have the longest hair in the UK and Prince often causing chaos wherever he went.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/>

The band later blamed their lack of success in the US on the fact their management opted for a tour of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in July–August 1965. During their two weeks in New Zealand, they caused so much outrage in the media that the [[New Zealand Parliament]] addressed the issue of granting entry permits to musicians such as the Pretty Things. The band was never actually banned from re-entering New Zealand, contrary to what can be read in some sources.<ref>Stax, Neil & Baker, p. 90</ref>

The first of what would be many personnel changes over the years also began, with Prince, whose wild antics had become too much for the other members to endure, being the first to go in November 1965.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He was replaced by [[Skip Alan]].<ref>Stax, Neill & Baker, pp. 94–98</ref> In early 1966, the band made a short [[film]] ''The Pretty Things on Film''; it featured live footage and a [[music video]] prototype for "Can't Stand the Pain", which also featured their manager, Morrison. Rarely screened at the time, the film can be found as a bonus multimedia item on the Snapper [[Compact disc|CD]] re-issue of ''Get the Picture''. 1966 saw the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] scene fall into decline and the Pretty Things began moving away, flirting with [[soul music]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> In mid-1966, they made the UK Singles Chart for the final time with a [[cover version|cover]] of [[the Kinks]] song "[[A House in the Country]]". In December 1966 came the single "Progress", where the band were joined by a [[brass section]].

Pendleton left in December 1966 and will be replaced on stage by Billy Harrison from [[Them (band)|Them]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Stax followed in January 1967.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> [[Jon Povey]] and [[Wally Waller]], both former Fenmen from [[Bern Elliott and the Fenmen]], joined and made the band a five-piece once again.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===1967–1971: ''S.F. Sorrow'' and ''Parachute''===
Their final album for [[Fontana Records]] was a contractual obligation [[record producer|produced]] by [[Steve Rowland (record producer)|Steve Rowland]] and the subject of controversy, since ''[[Emotions (Pretty Things album)|Emotions]]'' was laden with brass and string [[arrangement]]s arranged by Reg Tilsley. [[EMI]] producer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]] expressed interest in working with them and at the end of September 1967, the Pretty Things signed to EMI's [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] [[record label|label]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In November 1967 they released "Defecting Grey", a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] effort that failed to sell. This was followed three months later by a [[double A-side]] single, "Talking About the Good Times" / "Walking Through My Dreams".

That single marked the beginning of sessions for the ''[[S.F. Sorrow]]'' album.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Released in December 1968, it was the first [[rock opera]], preceding the release of [[the Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' in May 1969.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> It was recorded between December 1967 and September 1968 at the [[Abbey Road Studios]], while Pink Floyd were working on ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]'' (also produced by Norman Smith) and [[the Beatles]] worked on the ''[[White Album]]''. In March 1968, drummer Skip Alan left the group.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> [[Twink (musician)|Twink]] replaced him to help the band to complete the album.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

In March 1969, the British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported that [[Motown Records]] vice-president Barney Ales had visited London to sign the Pretty Things as the U.S. label's first British act.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

Sorrow'' was commercially unsuccessful, with no immediate release in the United States.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The work received only modest support from [[EMI]], and its depressing narrative probably did not help sales. The American release, on Motown's [[Rare Earth Records]] label, came out more than a year late, leading to the impression that ''S.F. Sorrow'' was merely following the trend set by the Who's ''Tommy''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/><ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

1969 saw the band feeling disillusioned by the failure of ''S.F. Sorrow'' and that June, Taylor left the group.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The Pretty Things borrowed guitarist Victor Unitt from the [[Edgar Broughton Band]] to replace Taylor. During the summer of 1969, they recorded an album for a young French millionaire Philippe DeBarge, which was intended only to be circulated among his social circle. The [[acetate disc|acetate]] has since been [[Copyright infringement|bootleg]]ged.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In 2010, it was picked up by Mike Stax, owner of 1960s music magazine ''[[Ugly Things]]''. He unearthed one of the two acetates and had it mixed and mastered and then as a ''piece de resistance'', had the classic Pretty Things line-up, which Dick Taylor had just left at the time of the recording of the tracks with DeBarge, record a song entitled "Monsieur Rock" (''Ballad of Philippe'') a bonus track for this release on Ugly Things UTCD-2207.

Twink left at the end of 1969 to form the [[Pink Fairies]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Skip Alan returned to the drumstool in time for the band's return to Abbey Road to start work on ''[[Parachute (Pretty Things album)|Parachute]]'', which kept the psychedelic sound.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Shortly before the release of ''Parachute'', Unitt left to rejoin the Edgar Broughton Band and was replaced by Pete Tolson, former guitarist for [[Eire Apparent]]. Despite much stage work and acclaim, their records were still failing to sell at all well.<ref name="Alan Lakey 2002">Alan Lakey, ''The Pretty Things: Growing Old Disgracefully'' (2002).</ref> With Tolson, they released a few singles before disbanding in mid-1971.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

During the late 1960s, the group made some extra money by recording for music library company DeWolfe. Some of these songs ended up in low-budget films including ''[[What's Good for the Goose]]'' (1969), ''[[The Haunted House of Horror]]'' (1969), and a couple of [[softcore porn]] films. Not intended for official release, these songs were later compiled on a number of records and released under the alias Electric Banana: ''Electric Banana'' (1967), ''More Electric Banana'' (1968), ''Even More Electric Banana'' (1969), ''Hot Licks'' (1970), and ''Return of the Electric Banana'' (1978). The initial releases featured one side of vocal and one side of [[instrumental]] tracks. Subsequent releases of these albums generally keep the true identity of the band secret.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===1970s===
Pretty Things reformed in late 1971. Wally Waller, who had become assistant producer at EMI, was replaced by Stuart Brooks (ex-[[Black Cat Bones]]). They signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and released ''[[Freeway Madness]]'' at the end of 1972.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Although Waller was no longer a member of the band, he produced the album under a pseudonym and contributed lead vocals to the song "Over the Moon". The album was commercially unsuccessful.

In 1973, [[David Bowie]] covered two of their songs, "Rosalyn" and "Don't Bring Me Down", on his album ''[[Pin Ups]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Around this time, the band recruited a sixth member, Gordon John Edwards (born 26 December 1946, [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]]). A versatile musician, Edwards could play the guitar as well as the keyboards, and he also sang.

In 1974, Pretty Things were one of the first acts signed by [[Swan Song Records]], the label created by [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] became their manager. Stuart Brooks left the band before the recording of their first album for Swan Song, ''[[Silk Torpedo]]''. The bass lines on the album were recorded by guitarist Pete Tolson before the arrival of a new bass player, [[Jack Green (musician)|Jack Green]], who only contributed backing vocals.

''Silk Torpedo'' was the first British album release on Zeppelin's own label [[Swan Song Records|Swan Song]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> It charted in the lower reaches of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, for the first time in the band's history. [[Jimmy Page]] later remarked:

:{{quote|"The Pretty Things were a band that were really changing their music and had done because they probably did one of the best singles way back in the day with 'Rosalyn'. That's wild! That's serious! And then they'd gone through ''S.F. Sorrow'' and the music that they were doing on Swan Song was incredible. It was the sort of band that, when someone said, 'Oh, some tapes have come in,' I was keen to hear what they'd done, because it was always so good! Good writing, good performance from everybody. A fine band."<ref>Bonner, Michael: "An Audience with Jimmy Page", ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', January 2015, pp18</ref>}}

During the recording of ''[[Savage Eye]]'', the follow-up to ''Silk Torpedo'', tensions arose between the members of the band, with May finding himself at odds with newcomers Edwards and Green. After the release of ''Savage Eye'', May did not show up at a major London gig, and he was fired soon after. Alan, Edwards, Green and Tolson tried to form a new band called Metropolis, but Swan Song was not interested in offering them a contract and they went their separate ways. Edwards briefly joined [[the Kinks]] for their ''[[Misfits (Kinks album)|Misfits]]'' tour, while Green became a member of [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] for a few weeks before launching a solo career.

===1980s===
[[File:The Pretty Things 1999 - Phil May and Skip Alan.jpg|thumb|upright|Phil May and Skip Alan in 1999]]
The 1967 line-up of Alan, May, Povey, Taylor and Waller reformed in 1978 for a one-off gig in the Netherlands. Adding Pete Tolson, the six-piece recorded ''[[Cross Talk]]'' for Warner Bros. Records in 1980.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The new wave sounds did not improve their sales figures, and Pretty Things split up again in 1981, after an appearance in the horror film ''[[The Monster Club]]'' (1981).

Throughout the 1980s, May and Taylor kept the band's name alive with a rotating cast of supporting musicians,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> touring extensively in continental Europe, especially Germany where they retained a loyal fanbase. In 1987, they released ''Out of the Island'', a live-in-the-studio album consisting of new recordings of songs from their catalogue which was their first CD release. They did a successful European blues tour in late 1990 with [[Stan Webb]]'s [[Chicken Shack]] and [[Luther Allison]]. This outfit included drummer Hans Waterman (formerly of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] rock group [[Solution (band)|Solution]]), bassist Roelf ter Velt and guitarist/keyboardist Barkley McKay ([[Waco Brothers]], [[Pine Valley Cosmonauts]], [[Jon Langford]], [[the Mekons]]) on guitar. This line-up regularly toured the European mainland until late 1994.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===1990s===
[[File:The Pretty Things 1999.jpg|thumb|Pretty Things live 1999]]
May and Taylor, together with former [[Yardbirds]] drummer [[Jim McCarty]], recorded two albums in [[Chicago]] as Pretty Things/Yardbird Blues Band. They were ''The Chicago Blues Tapes 1991'' and ''Wine, Women, Whiskey'', both produced by [[George Paulus]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> They also recorded one album with members of the [[Inmates]] and [[Matthew Fisher (musician)|Matthew Fisher]] of [[Procol Harum]] under the name Pretty Things n' Mates. It was released in 1992 as ''Rockin' the Garage''.

The early 1990s were taken up with a battle against EMI. This was over unpaid royalties stemming back to a deal EMI set up with Motown subsidiary Rare Earth in 1968. The band never received any royalties from Rare Earth nor had received any monies from EMI for many years. The band won the legal case, the result being that in 1993 EMI gave them back all their master tapes, copyrights and an undisclosed sum of money as settlement.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> On friendly terms again, the 1967 line-up decided to return with the addition of Pete Tolson, Taylor's replacement in 1970, just like they had done in 1980 on ''Cross Talk''. After much rehearsal, Tolson grew disillusioned and quit with Frank Holland taking Tolson's place.<ref name="Alan Lakey 2002"/>

Their label, Snapper Music, issued remastered [[CD]]s with many bonus tracks, plus a [[DVD]] of the September 1998 live netcast re-recording of ''S.F. Sorrow'' at Abbey Road Studios, with [[David Gilmour]] and [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] as guest players. They played a tour of the U.S. for the first time in decades.

===2000s to present===
[[File:Dick Taylor and Phil May of the Pretty Things at Saltburn Spa (9973779823).jpg|thumb|Phil May and Dick Taylor in 2013]]
Original rhythm guitarist Brian Pendleton died of [[lung cancer]] on 16 May 2001 in [[Maidstone]]. Their ex-guitarist and keyboard player Gordon Edwards, who also played for [[the Kinks]] in the late 1970s, died on 28 February 2003 due to depression-related suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gofundme.com/gordonjohnedwards|title=Click here to support MEMORIAL for Gordon John Edwards organised by Melanie Antoinette Wheeler|website=Gofundme.com|access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref>

In 1999, they released the studio album ''Rage Before Beauty'' and in the early 2000s, they released several [[compilation album]]s, a [[live album]] and [[DVD]]. In 2003, Alan Lakey's biography of the band, ''Growing Old Disgracefully'', was published by Firefly. The book dealt with the long and involved history of the band, and paid special attention to the legal proceedings issued against EMI in the 1990s.

Skip Alan suffered heart problems in 2001 restricting his commitment to the band, with Mark St. John (not to be confused with former KISS / White Tiger guitarist of the same name) deputising on the drums as required. In mid-2007, the Pretty Things released their eleventh studio album ''[[Balboa Island (album)|Balboa Island]]'' on [[Zoho Music|Zoho Roots]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/the-pretty-things-balboa-island-2496212829.html|title=The Pretty Things: Balboa Island|last=Sheppard|first=Doug|date=September 26, 2007|website=PopMatters|language=en}}</ref> Family illnesses meant Waller and Povey were unable to commit to the band's live schedule. A new line-up emerged around May and Taylor with Frank Holland on guitar, Jack Greenwood on drums and George Woosey on bass.

[[File:Pretty Things im Downtown Blues Club 2017-04-07.jpg|thumb|Dick Taylor, Phil May, Jack Greenwood, George Woosey, Frank Holland @ the Downtown Blues Club (Hamburg) in April 2017]]

In June 2009, May, Taylor, Waller, Povey and Alan reunited to receive the "Heroes" award at the annual ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' Awards ceremony. Waller, Povey, Alan and Tolson reunited in the middle of 2010 to re-record ''Parachute'', to commemorate its 40th anniversary. Using the byline 'The XPTs', the album was released by Esoteric Recordings on 30 April 2012. Tolson died in April 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/uglythings/posts/10156851441840434|title=Ugly Things Magazine|website=Facebook.com|access-date=18 October 2020}}</ref>

On 30 April 2012, a re-imagining of ''S.F. Sorrow'', entitled ''Sorrow's Children'' and featuring covers by contemporary bands of each track, was released on [[Fruits de Mer Records]], only on vinyl and in a limited edition of 700.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.piccadillyrecords.com/products/VariousArtists-SorrowsChildrenTheSongsOfS.F.Sorrow-FruitsDeMerRecords-83135.html |title=Sorrow's Children – The Songs of S.F. Sorrow |publisher=Piccadilly Records |access-date=26 February 2013}}</ref> The album included an interview with May and Taylor, and had a live version of "Loneliest Person". The latter was recorded at their gig at London's [[100 Club]] in December 2010, at which they played the whole of their first album.

In 2012, the band returned to New Zealand for the first time since the bad publicity of 1965. They also toured Australia and were reunited with original bass player, John Stax, for their [[Melbourne]] shows. This was the first time May, Taylor and Stax had played together since 1967.<ref name="3news.co.nz">{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/British-band-back-after-47-year-ban/tabid/418/articleID/279926/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= British band back after 47-year ban| date=10 December 2012}}</ref>

In 2013 the Pretty Things celebrated their 50th Anniversary Tour with dates in the UK and Europe.   The band's studio album, ''[[The Sweet Pretty Things (Are in Bed Now, of Course...)]]'', was released on 10 July 2015.

In 2018, the band announced that they were splitting up at the end of the year. All current and forthcoming dates throughout 2018 were billed as part of a farewell tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/bluesfestivalsuk/photos/a.489620581146799.1073741837.487632131345644/1488216304620550/?type=3&theater|title=Blues Festival UK|website=Facebook.com|access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thestrangebrew.co.uk/http:/thestrangebrew.co.uk/the-pretty-things-retire/|title=The Pretty Things to retire from electric performances – The Strange Brew|website=Thestrangebrew.co.uk|access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref>
