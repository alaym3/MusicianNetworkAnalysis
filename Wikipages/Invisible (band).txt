'''Invisible''' was an [[Argentine]] band formed by [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] following the breakup of [[Pescado Rabioso]] in 1973 and the release of ''[[Artaud (album)|Artaud]]''. The original lineup of the band was completed by Carlos "Machi" Rufino (bass, backing vocals) and Héctor "Pomo" Lorenzo (drums), both of whom conformed [[Pappo's Blues]]' rhythm section at the time. From 1976 until their breakup a year later, the band expanded into a quartet with the inclusion of guitarist Tomás Gubitsch.

Invisible's first live performance took place at the [[Teatro Astral]] on 23 November 1973. The following year, they recorded their first single and their first album, self-titled ''Invisible''. The group secluded more and more in their rehearsals and dropped live performances in small places; they only performed in big theaters or stadiums, but never in festivals.

After a long hiatus, they changed recording company (from Talent - Microfón to multinational [[CBS]]) and announced their second LP, ''Durazno Sangrando'' in 1975. The premiere took place in the [[Teatro Coliseo]] on 21 and 22 November that year. A cover version of "Amor de primavera," a song originally composed and performed by [[Tanguito]], was Invisible's only sign of activity until the release of their third and last LP, ''[[El jardín de los presentes]]'', in which the band incorporated Tomás Gubitsch on lead guitar. The album obtained massive success almost immediately{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and contains "[[El Anillo del Capitán Beto]]", considered a classic of [[Argentine rock]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rock.com.ar/especiales/100temas/las100.shtml|title= Las 100 de los 40|date= 2007|website= Rock.com.ar|access-date= 11 October 2013 }}</ref> The album also featured a guest appearance by [[bandoneón]] virtuoso [[Rodolfo Mederos]] on "Las Golondrinas de Plaza de Mayo". The new material included in this LP would be first performed live on 6 August 1976 in the Estadio [[Estadio Luna Park|Luna Park]]. About "El Anillo del Capitán Beto," Spinetta once said: 
{{Quote|text="''I remember myself with Pomo and Machi, having a great time in the coffee shop that was next to Teatro Astral and thinking of possible names for that astronaut who has gone through the fight of ages (in Spanish: ''lucha de las eras'')... ''Las eras''... Las Heras y Bustamante (an intersection in [[Buenos Aires]]). I imagined that his spaceship was similar to the [[DMC DeLorean|DeLorean]] of ''[[Back to the Future]]'', or something like that, that took off due to a science that only Beto understands, and goes far away... Actually, Beto does not want to come back. He has conquered something impressive but, as any conqueror, he can't avoid comparison and distance to the world he left behind.''" |author=[[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] |source= ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Argentine edition, March 2002. }}

Invisible had its last concert on 12 December 1976 in the [[Estadio Luna Park|Luna Park]]. In early 1977, the group disbanded due to the different opinions among its members on which musical style to follow.
