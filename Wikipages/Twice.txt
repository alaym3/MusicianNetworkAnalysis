'''Twice''' ({{ko-hhrm|트와이스}}; {{lang-ja|トゥワイス}}), commonly stylized as '''TWICE''', is a South Korean [[girl group]] formed by [[JYP Entertainment]]. The group is composed of nine members: [[Nayeon]], [[Jeongyeon]], [[Momo Hirai|Momo]], [[Sana (singer)|Sana]], [[Jihyo]], [[Mina (Japanese singer)|Mina]], [[Dahyun]], [[Chaeyoung]], and [[Tzuyu]]. Twice was formed under the television program ''[[Sixteen (TV series)|Sixteen]]'' (2015) and debuted on October 20, 2015, with the [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[The Story Begins]]''.

Twice rose to domestic fame in 2016 with their single "[[Cheer Up (song)|Cheer Up]]", which charted at number one on the [[Gaon Digital Chart]], became the [[List of Gaon Digital Chart number ones of 2016|best-performing single]] of the year, and won "Song of the Year" at the [[Melon Music Awards#Song of the Year|Melon Music Awards]] and [[2016 Mnet Asian Music Awards|Mnet Asian Music Awards]]. Their next single, "[[TT (song)|TT]]", from their third EP ''[[Twicecoaster: Lane 1]]'', topped the Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. The EP was the highest selling Korean girl group album of 2016. Within 19 months after debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2&nbsp;million units of their four EPs and special album. Following the release of their seventh EP, ''[[Fancy You (EP)|Fancy You]]'', Twice had sold over 3.75&nbsp;million albums in Korea in 2019. As of December 2020, the group has sold over 10&nbsp;million albums in South Korea and Japan.

The group debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017, under [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music Japan]], with the release of a compilation album titled ''[[Twice (Twice album)|#Twice]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Twice |url=https://wmg.jp/twice/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422041327/https://wmg.jp/twice/ |archive-date=April 22, 2019 |access-date=June 23, 2018 |publisher=[[Warner Music Group|Warner Music Japan]]}}</ref> The album charted at number 2 on the [[Oricon Albums Chart]] with the highest first-week album sales by a K-pop artist in Japan in two years. It was followed by the release of Twice's first original Japanese [[maxi single]] titled "[[One More Time (Twice song)|One More Time]]" in October. Twice became the first Korean girl group to earn a [[Recording Industry Association of Japan#Certification awards|platinum]] certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ) for both an album and [[CD single]] in the same year. Twice ranked third in the Top Artist category of ''[[Billboard Japan]]'''s 2017 Year-end Rankings, and in 2019, they became the first Korean girl group to embark on a Japanese dome tour.

Twice is the first female Korean act to simultaneously top both ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Billboard charts#Albums|World Albums]] and [[World Digital Song Sales]] charts with the release of their first studio album ''[[Twicetagram]]'' and its lead single "[[Likey]]" in 2017. With the release of their single "[[Feel Special (song)|Feel Special]]" in 2019, Twice became the third female Korean act to chart into the [[Canadian Hot 100]]. After signing with [[Republic Records]] for American promotions as part of a partnership with JYP Entertainment, the group has charted into the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[More & More (EP)|More & More]]'' and ''[[Eyes Wide Open (Twice album)|Eyes Wide Open]]'' in 2020. They have been dubbed the next "Nation's Girl Group", and their point choreography—including for "Cheer Up" (2016), "TT" (2016), "[[Signal (EP)|Signal]]" (2017), and "[[What Is Love? (Twice song)|What Is Love?]]" (2018)—became dance crazes and viral [[Internet meme|memes]] imitated by many celebrities.

On February 11, 2015, [[J. Y.

Park then announced that he would increase the size of the group from seven members to nine by adding [[Tzuyu]], who was known as the "audience's pick" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and [[Momo Hirai|Momo]], who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. The decision was controversial at the time, with many people complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yoon |first=Hyo-jin |date=July 8, 2015 |title='식스틴 논란' JYP 측 "모모 추가합격, 완성도 높은 트와이스를 위해 결정" (공식입장) |language=ko |work=Naver |publisher=The Financial news |url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=014&aid=0003462829 |url-status=live |access-date=April 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321085702/https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=014&aid=0003462829 |archive-date=March 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Kim |first=Min-gi |date=July 8, 2015 |title=JYP측 "트와이스 모모 합류 이유있어...내정설, 사실 아니다" |language=ko |work=Naver |publisher=Money Today |url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=008&aid=0003503412 |url-status=live |access-date=April 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321085710/https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=008&aid=0003503412 |archive-date=March 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Kang |first=Seo-jeong |date=July 8, 2015 |title=JYP 측 "논란 겸허히 받아들인다..서툰 점 양해해달라"[공식입장 전문] |language=ko |work=Naver |publisher=OSEN |url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=109&aid=0003108190 |url-status=live |access-date=April 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702011109/https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=109&aid=0003108190 |archive-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref> The group's name, Twice, was chosen by Park, explaining that "the group will touch people's hearts twice: once through the ears, and once again through the eyes."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kim |first=Yena |date=April 29, 2015 |title='식스틴' 박진영 "그룹명 트와이스, 와일드+엣지 느낌 살릴 것" |url=http://bntnews.hankyung.com/apps/news?popup=0&nid=04&c1=04&c2=04&c3=00&nkey=201504291513593&mode=sub_view |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201121022737/http://bntnews.hankyung.com/apps/news?popup=0&nid=04&c1=04&c2=04&c3=00&nkey=201504291513593&mode=sub_view |archive-date=November 21, 2020 |access-date=October 4, 2019 |website=Bnt News Hankyung |publisher=Bnt News |language=ko}}</ref> Fans of Twice are known as "Once", commonly stylized as ONCE, illustrated by the members' statement "If you love us even once, we will repay your love with twice of our love" on social media in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bailey |first=Alyssa |date=June 9, 2020 |title=Twice on Their Album More & More, Favorite Hair Colors, and Quarantine Entertainment |url=https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a32792828/twice-more-and-more-album-interview/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200616014146/https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a32792828/twice-more-and-more-album-interview/ |archive-date=June 16, 2020 |access-date=June 17, 2020 |website=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=May 26, 2016 |title=10 K-Pop fandom names (and their meanings) |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2016/05/25/10-k-pop-fandom-names-and-their-meanings |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225100553/https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2016/05/25/10-k-pop-fandom-names-and-their-meanings |archive-date=December 25, 2019 |access-date=May 23, 2020 |website=SBS}}</ref>

Twice is most notable for their consistent employment of "cute" concepts which was further supported by the group's bubblegum pop sound, which was seen as a departure from the usual retro style of music that was seen in their predecessor labelmates and fellow girl groups [[Wonder Girls]] and [[Miss A]].
