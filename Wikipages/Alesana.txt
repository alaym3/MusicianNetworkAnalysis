'''Alesana'''<!--- Please view the source directly to the right and do not change pronunciation ---> ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|ᵻ|s|ˈ|æ|n|ə}} {{respell|AL|iss|AN|ə}}) is an American [[post-hardcore]] band from [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. The group was founded by Shawn Milke, Dennis Lee and Patrick Thompson during the fall of 2004, and is currently signed to Revival Recordings and [[Artery Recordings]]. Alesana has collectively released three EPs and five full-length studio albums. The band gained a wide audience after their debut, ''On Frail Wings of Vanity and Wax'' was released, featuring a musical style shifting between light and heavy sounds along with a wide influence ranging  from pop punk, metal and even classic rock bands such as [[the Beatles]]. Their audience grew heavily after the release of their third album, ''[[The Emptiness (album)|The Emptiness]]'', which released in early-2010. Their band name is derived from street named Aliceanna Street, which was the street that vocalist/rhythm guitarist Shawn Milke and lead guitarist Patrick Thompson grew up on, in Baltimore.

==History==

===Formation and ''Try This with Your Eyes Closed'' (2004–2005)===
Although the band's members first began playing together in Baltimore,<ref name=amg/> [[Maryland]], Alesana officially formed in October 2004 in Raleigh, [[North Carolina]] and was founded by Shawn Milke, Patrick Thompson, Dennis Lee, Steven Tomany, and Daniel Magnuson. The name of the band is inspired from Aliceanna St., which Shawn Milke and Patrick Thompson lived on when playing in Baltimore, MD.  Aliceanna St. is located in Fells Point, a neighborhood in Baltimore.  Alesana was the first band to join Tragic Hero Records in 2005,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/alesana-mn0000984242|title=Alesana &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> and their three demo songs titled "Apology", "Beautiful in Blue"  and "Goodbye, Goodnight for Good" were featured on the compilation ''All The Tragedy Money Can Buy''. In May 2005 they released their debut EP, ''Try This With Your Eyes Closed''. Alesana then toured across the United States, including an appearance at the [[Cornerstone Festival]], despite not being a Christian band. In the same year, founding drummer Daniel Magnuson was replaced by Will Anderson.

===''On Frail Wings of Vanity and Wax'' (2006–2008)===
In 2006, the group added a new drummer Jeremy Bryan to replace Will Anderson and added guitarist/vocalist Adam Ferguson to their lineup.<ref name=amg>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p795156|pure_url=yes}} Alesana] at [[AllMusic]]</ref> They followed with a full-length album, entitled ''On Frail Wings of Vanity and Wax'', produced by Kit Walters, during the summer of 2006. In late 2006 Alesana signed to Fearless Records, which re-released their LP in March 2007 to mixed reviews and released a music video for "Ambrosia". In the same year, the song "Apology" in an acoustic version was featured on the compilation release, ''[[Punk Goes Acoustic 2]]''. The group played the entire [[Warped Tour]] 2007, but afterwards, bassist Steven Tomany left Alesana. The record is also the first to feature Shawn Milke's sister, Melissa Milke, who performs all female vocals.

In early 2008, ''On Frail Wings of Vanity and Wax'' charted on the [[Billboard magazines|Billboard]] Heatseekers chart, peaking at #44.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p795156|pure_url=yes}} Billboard], [[AllMusic]]</ref>

===''Where Myth Fades to Legend'' (2008–2009)===
In 2008, Alesana finished recording their second album, ''[[Where Myth Fades to Legend]]''. It was released on June 3, 2008, but was leaked on popular torrent sites a month beforehand. ''Where Myth Fades to Legend'' was also the title of their headlining tour with [[Sky Eats Airplane]], [[Our Last Night]], [[Lovehatehero]], and [[The Chariot (band)|The Chariot]] that supported the album. At the time of preparing for the record a year before, the band lacked an official bass player. Shane Crump, who previously played in a band named Your Name in Vain and originally a merchandise salesman for Alesana, was invited into the group after an audition, thus making the record Crump's debut.

On the 2008 Warped Tour, Shane Crump briefly left due to personal matters at home and Jake Campbell, formerly of [[Twelve Gauge Valentine]], became a temporary fill in-bassist. Upon Crump's return, Adam Ferguson and the band parted ways and Campbell became the new guitarist/vocalist. Shane Crump also took care of all the backing unclean to this point.

On January 20, 2009, the music video for "Seduction", the song features a few screams made by Ferguson before he left the band, because of that Shane Crump lip sync all his screams. On March 10, 2009 the album ''[[Punk Goes Pop 2]]'' was released which includes Alesana's cover of "[[What Goes Around...Comes Around]]" by Justin Timberlake. Alesana's ''Where Myth Fades to Legend'' has also charted on the Billboard 200 at #96 and on the Billboard Hard Rock Album at #13.

===''The Emptiness'' (2009–2010)===

In late February, Shawn Milke announced Alesana had started writing new material for their upcoming album. They began recording their third studio album, in July 2009, in Portland, Oregon, with producer [[Kris Crummett]].

===Live album problems (2015–2016)===
In December 2015, Shawn Milke did an AMA on the Revival Recordings' YouTube channel, a user named Shane Waters asked: "So when's the live album going to be released? Thought it was going to be last year?" and Shawn Milke answered: "So when we opened the session from the Live performance there were a lot of corrupt files.  We've been working to see if the session is salvageable.  Fingers crossed, I appreciate you asking about it!" It leaves unlikely expectations for the release. During this time, most of the vinyls for ''Confessions and The Emptiness'' were delayed with logistics problems.

On July 26, 2016, the page [http://www.theannabeltrilogy.com www.theannabeltrilogy.com]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theannabeltrilogy.com|title=Home|website=The Annabel Trilogy}}</ref> was officially released along with the announcement of a new tour and that the band would be releasing a new novel entitled "Annabel," which is based on the group's three concept albums.

"Origins" was scheduled for release on Black Friday, 2017. On November 22, 2017, they released the first single off of the upcoming ''The Lost Chapters'' EP, entitled "Fits and Starts". The new single was accompanied by a brand new music video, which is mainly a compilation of fan made videos sent to the band.

While there has been discussion for a sixth full-length Alesana album, progression within the band has recently slowed due to the member's personal lives such as Milke and his wife Naima having three children. Guitarist Campbell and his wife Nikita recently had a second child. While lead guitarist Thompson was married in 2018 to wife Jessica. Jessica gave birth to a daughter in 2020. Vocalist Lee and long time girlfriend Cayce were married in 2019. They too welcomed a daughter in 2020. In the meantime bassist Crump and drummer Bryan are both engaged to their girlfriends and working on a side-project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundfiction.net/2017/10/31/alesana-announces-origins-available-black-friday-1124|title=ALESANA ANNOUNCES 'ORIGINS' – AVAILABLE BLACK FRIDAY (11/24)|website=Soundfiction}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revivalrecs.com/shop/alesana-origins|title=Alesana – Origins (U.S. Only)|website=Revival Recordings|access-date=November 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127042034/http://www.revivalrecs.com/shop/alesana-origins|archive-date=November 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Alesana's overall genre has been proven difficult to determine due to their frequent use of light and poppy influence combined with heavy outputs and metal influenced-screaming vocals.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barnett|first=Daryl|title=Ground Control - Alesana - <nowiki>[Album]</nowiki>|url=http://www.groundcontrolmag.com/detail/3/2711/|publisher=Ground Control|access-date=27 December 2011|archive-date=April 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072622/http://www.groundcontrolmag.com/detail/3/2711/|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to Corey Apar, Alesana's music combines [[post-hardcore]] and [[heavy metal music]] with [[pop music|pop]]-influenced hooks.<ref name=alesanabio>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alesana-mn0000984242|title=Alesana at Allmusic|author=Corey Apar|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 18, 2014}}</ref> Alesana has been described as [[emo]],<ref name=Idaho>{{cite web |url=https://www.idahopress.com/emo-sextet-alesana-aim-for-legendary-sweetcore/article_981aeeee-8882-51c5-97cc-9b19c388994d.html |title=Emo sextet Alesana aim for legendary 'sweetcore' |work=[[The Idaho Press-Tribune]] |last=Runkle |first=Christin |date=April 10, 2009 |access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref> [[screamo]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.altpress.com/aptv/underground-screamo-bands-2000s/ |title=10 Underground Screamo Legends from the early 2000s You Need to Know |work=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] |last=Makar |first=Bobby |date=August 14, 2018 |access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/music/mc-alesana-crocodile-rock-allentown-20150402-story.html |title=Metal/pop band Alesana, coming to Allentown, gets all sci-fi on new album |work=[[The Morning Call]] |last=Sculley |first=Alan |date=April 2, 2015 |access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref><ref name="alesanabio" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://noisecreep.com/alesana-write-their-own-horror-love-story-on-the-emptiness/ |title=Alesana Write Their Own Horror/Love Story on 'The Emptiness' |publisher=[[Noisecreep]] |last=Sciarretto |first=Amy |date=January 7, 2010 |access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref> [[metalcore]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shepherdexpress.com/music/today-milwaukee/alesana/ |title=Alesana |work=[[Shepherd Express]] |date=September 12, 2009 |access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/lehigh-valley-music/mc-top-5-concerts-of-the-coming-week-cody-simpson-the-decemberists-alesana-the-devil-wears-prada-rick-b-20150401-column.html |title=Top 5 Concerts of the Coming Week |work=[[The Morning Call]] |last=Moser |first=John J. |date=April 1, 2015 |access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref> and [[post-hardcore]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/tonight-alesana-leads-post-hardcore-bill-at-culture-room-6477133 |title=Tonight!
