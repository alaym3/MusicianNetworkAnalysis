'''The Real McKenzies''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Celtic punk]] band founded in 1992 and based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. They are one of the founders of the [[Celtic punk]] movement, albeit 10 years after [[The Pogues]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/music/canadian-stories-fuel-real-mckenzies-songs|title=Canadian stories fuel Real McKenzies' songs|work=The Georgia Straight - Vancouver News and Entertainment Weekly|access-date=October 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022192126/http://www.straight.com/music/canadian-stories-fuel-real-mckenzies-songs|archive-date=October 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In addition to writing and performing original music, Real McKenzies perform traditional [[Scottish people|Scottish]] songs, giving them a new [[Punk rock|punk]]-influenced sound. They have shared stages with many other bands including [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[Shane MacGowan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brokenheadphones.com/?p=4347|title=Interview: Paul McKenzie of The Real McKenzines|access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref> [[DragStrip Riot]], [[NOFX]], [[Flogging Molly]], Xcrosscheckx, [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], [[Metallica]], and [[Voodoo Glow Skulls]].

==History==
Founding member Paul McKenzie has been the only consistent member of the band since its inception. The band released its first album, ''Clash of the Tartans'', in 1998.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011109082734/http://chartattack.com/damn/2001/11/0702.cfm "Real McKenzies Slag Sh*thead"]. ''Chart Attack'', November 07, 2001</ref> McKenzie claims as many as 100 different musicians have performed as members of the band,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vueweekly.com/the_real_mckenzies1/|title=The Real McKenzies|work=Vue Weekly|access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref> including piper Alan "Raven" MacLeod, of the pioneering Scottish folk band [[The Tannahill Weavers]] and "Bourne and MacLeod".

McKenzie said in 2014 that he "fired all the Americans" in the band and returned to full Canadian lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://labeat.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3440:the-real-mckenzies-to-bring-new-all-canadian-line-up-back-to-lethbridge&catid=1:latest-news&Itemid=50|title=The Real McKenzies to bring new all Canadian line up back to Lethbridge|access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref> Despite that claim, Aspy Luison is from [[Cambre]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]].

In September 2014 the band announced they would be recording their next album for [[Fat Wreck Chords]] at Motor Studio in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/therealmckenzies/posts/10152708349349890/|title=Tonight is our last show of the tour.... - The Real McKenzies - Facebook|access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref> Michael "[[Fat Mike]]" Burkett will be producing the album.

Their previous album, ''[[Westwinds]]'', was released on March 27, 2012 with Fat Wreck Chords.
