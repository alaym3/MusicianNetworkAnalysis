'''Q Lazzarus''' (born December 12, 1965){{citation needed|date=September 2020}} is an American bus driver and retired singer known for her 1988 song "[[Goodbye Horses]]". She is noted for her mysterious profile as little is known about the singer's identity or private life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/43946/1/where-is-q-lazzarus-goodbye-horses-mystery|title=Searching for Q Lazzarus|date=8 April 2019}}</ref>

“Goodbye Horses” was written by William Garvey, which was featured in the films ''[[Married to the Mob]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', both of which were directed by [[Jonathan Demme]].

==Career==
Q Lazzarus has a deep, husky, [[contralto]] voice. She was born in New Jersey, married young, and fled an abusive marriage that later inspired her to write the song "Tears of Fear." Moving to New York City, she became a nanny for an English man named Swan, who tried to steer her toward a "practical occupation" rather than encourage her musical gifts. Q decided to drive a taxi instead and continued making music independently with her band, The Resurrection. It was while working as a cabbie that she was discovered as a singer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/173522-the-mysterious-legacy-of-q-lazzarus-goodbye-horses-2495740649.html|title=The Mysterious Legacy of Q Lazzarus|last=Sawdey|first=Evan|date=July 17, 2013|website=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref> One of her fares was director [[Jonathan Demme]], who heard her demo playing in the taxi. Demme took her to Hollywood, where, despite his encouragement, record companies refused to sign her because they believed she couldn't be marketed. Q replied, "I market myself, I'm an [[African-American]] woman who wears [[dreadlock|locks]] and sings American rock and roll."

Q Lazzarus' music was featured in the films ''[[Twisted (1986 film)|Twisted]]'', ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'', and ''[[Married to the Mob]]'', where "Goodbye Horses" originally debuted. "[[Goodbye Horses]]", written by William Garvey, is most remembered from ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. In the film, the song is played as [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Buffalo Bill]] applies makeup (while wearing a scalp from a previous victim) and cavorts in front of a [[camcorder]] before hastily [[tucking]] his genitals between his thighs to approximate a [[vulva]] before posing before the camera. At the same time, his captive, Catherine Martin, attempts to lure his dog into the pit she is held in with a [[chicken drumstick]]. Its use in the film led to its reissue as a single in 1991. The scene, including the song, has been parodied in film, television, and video games, including ''[[Clerks II]]'', ''[[Fully Flared]]'', ''[[Maniac (2012 film)|Maniac]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', ''[[Skate 3]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The Last Man on Earth (TV series)|The Last Man on Earth]]'', and ''[[Nip Tuck]]''. 
Between 1988 and 1992 Q Lazzarus was active in London, where her band of the same name included Mark Barrett (guitar), Jon Alexander Bouillot (bass) and Rick Duce (drums). They played numerous well-received shows at venues such as the Marquee, Astoria and Hippodrome, and filmed a video for the single release of "Goodbye Horses" to co-incide with ''The Silence of the Lambs''. The band fell apart in late 1991.

Q Lazzarus recorded a cover of the [[Talking Heads]] song "[[Heaven (Talking Heads song)|Heaven]]" for Demme's next film, 1993's ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''.

Q Lazzarus' band was called Q Lazzarus and the Resurrection. The members included Mark Barrett, Garvey, Glorianna Galicia, Janicia, and backup singers Denise, Liz and Yvette W., Howie Feldman, and Ron Resigno. Q Lazzarus and the Resurrection appeared at [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] gallery parties and often performed at Boy Bar on [[8th Street / St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|Saint Mark's Place]] and the [[Pyramid Club (New York)|Pyramid Club]]. The group disbanded sometime before 1996, and Q Lazzarus dropped from the public eye shortly following.
