'''Lake Street Dive''' is a multi-genre band that was formed in 2004 at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] in [[Boston]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2014/02/15/lake-street-dive-takes-long-road-overnight-success/LOMamhsqvfro3Dbe3FUP2L/story.html|title=Lake Street Dive takes the long road to overnight success|last=Garelick|first=Jon|date=February 15, 2014|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> The band's founding members are [[Rachael Price]], Mike "McDuck" Olson, [[Bridget Kearney]], and Mike Calabrese.

The band is based in [[Brooklyn]] and frequently tours in North America, Australia, and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bighassle.com/publicity/lake-street-dive#photos|title=''Lake Street Dive On Tour''|publisher=bighassle.com|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref>

==Early history==
The group was formed in 2004 as a "free country band"; they intended to play country music in an improvised, avant-garde style.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Lake Street Dive'' |url=http://www.signaturesounds.com/lake-street-dive.html |publisher=signaturesounds.com |access-date=September 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915114200/http://www.signaturesounds.com/lake-street-dive.html |archive-date=September 15, 2015 }}</ref> This concept was abandoned in favor of something that "actually sounded good", according to Mike Olson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanbluesscene.com/2016/09/12-new-old-soul-acts-you-need-to-hear-right-now/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160909175538/https://www.americanbluesscene.com/2016/09/12-new-old-soul-acts-you-need-to-hear-right-now/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 9, 2016|title=''14 'New Old Soul' Acts You Need to Hear Right Now''|publisher=American Blues Scene|access-date=June 26, 2017}}</ref>

In 2005, bandmember Bridget Kearney won the Jazz Category of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest with the band's performance of her song "Sometimes When I'm Drunk and You're Wearing My Favorite Shirt".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jlsc.com/winners/2005b/lennon_awards.php|title=John Lennon Songwriting Contest|website=Jlsc.com|access-date=13 March 2021}}</ref>  Using their prize ($1,000 cash and 1,000 CDs produced by Disc Makers) Lake Street Dive released their debut album ''In This Episode...'' in 2006. The band released their next album ''Promises, Promises'' in 2008. The full-length concert film and live album ''[[Live at the Lizard Lounge]]'' was recorded in 2010 and released in 2011.

In the early years, Lake Street Dive juggled their tours with other commitments.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lake Street Dive Biography, Discography, Chart History|url=https://top40-charts.com/artist.php?aid=15313|access-date=2021-02-28|website=Top40-Charts.com|language=en}}</ref> Between their first brief performance in a [[Des Moines, Iowa]] rock club in 2007 and their May 2011 appearance at The Berkeley Cafe in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], they performed around 100 times in 24 states.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |title=''Lake Street Dive On Tour'' |url=http://www.lakestreetdive.com/tour.html |publisher=lakestreetdive.com |access-date=September 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215180822/http://www.lakestreetdive.com/tour.html |archive-date=December 15, 2013 }}</ref> In September and October 2011 they traveled to 13 states and played in 22 venues.<ref name="auto"/>

===Signature Sounds===
Lake Street Dive released their first [[Signature Sounds Recordings]] album, ''Lake Street Dive'', in November 2010. They credit Jim Olsen, president of Signature Sound, as being the band's dad, “because of all the support he gave us when we were so infantile.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmoremagazine.com/2014/11/features/lake-street-dive-and-father-jim|title=Lake Street Dive and Father Jim|date=25 November 2014|website=Elmore Magazine|access-date=13 March 2021}}</ref>

By 2012 the four-piece band decided to make a strong commitment as a group and to tour. Bridget Kearney left her other band, [[Joy Kills Sorrow (band)|Joy Kills Sorrow]], to concentrate on Lake Street Dive.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/bridget-kearney-exits-joy-kills-sorrow/ "Kearney announcement"] John Lawless, 'Bridget Kearney exits Joy Kills Sorrow' ''Bluegrass Today'', September 4, 2012</ref> Mike Calabrese also left his other band, [[Ward Hayden and The Outliers|Ward Hayden and The Outliers (then known as Girls, Guns, and Glory)]], to focus on Lake Street Dive. They went into the studio<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/greatnorthsoundsociety/|title=Great North Sound Society|website=Facebook.com|access-date=13 March 2021}}</ref> to record the album ''Fun Machine'' and some singles in November 2012.

Lead singer [[Rachael Price]] was still under contract with another label, Claire Vision. This prevented them from releasing the album recorded in the fall of 2012 featuring Price.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In late 2013, an agreement was reached and Lake Street Dive announced the release of their album ''Bad Self Portraits'' in February 2014.<ref>Wall Street Journal, 22 Aug 2013 [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324165204579026661243487586 WSJ online]</ref>

In 2013 and 2014 they played over 300 gigs in more than 175 different cities, spread between 43 states and 8 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bandsintown.com/|title=Bandsintown &#124; Live Music, Concert Tickets, Tour Dates & Live Streams|website=Bandsintown.com|access-date=13 March 2021}}</ref> Their Bad Self Portraits tour sold out in 40 venues at the start of 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bandsintown.com/a/274349-lake-street-dive?came_from=251|title=Lake Street Dive|website=Bandsintown.com|access-date=13 March 2021}}</ref>

On YouTube, their [[Jackson 5]] cover of "I Want You Back" on a street corner has received more than 6 million views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EPwRdVg5Ug|title=Lake Street Dive Plays "I Want You Back" On a Boston Sidewalk|access-date=2019-04-21|date=2012-05-17|website=youtube.com}}</ref> Its viral success helped promote the band's visibility and popularity.<ref name=":0" /> Their performance at the 2013 FreshGrass Festival<ref>{{Citation|last=FreshGrass Festival|title=FreshGrass Presents...

In December 2013, [[T Bone Burnett]] asked them to perform on the ''Another Day, Another Time'' show at [[The Town Hall (New York City)]] featuring music from and inspired by the [[Coen brothers]] film ''[[Inside Llewyn Davis]]''. Lake Street Dive has appeared on many television shows: ''[[The Colbert Report]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/cjdkxj/the-colbert-report-lake-street-dive|title=Colbert Report 5 February 2014|date=2014-02-05|access-date=2019-04-21|website=cc.com}}</ref> [[Late Show with David Letterman|''The Late Show with David Letterman'']],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCHiB1IymBQ |title=David Letterman 21 February 2014 |access-date=25 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209183355/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCHiB1IymBQ |archive-date=9 February 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Conan (talk show)|''Conan'']] , and [[Ellen DeGeneres Show|''The Ellen DeGeneres Show'']].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ellentv.com/artists/lake-street-dive/ |title=Ellen DeGeneres Show 18 March 2014 |access-date=20 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421082131/http://www.ellentv.com/artists/lake-street-dive/ |archive-date=21 April 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> {{cns|date=March 2021|They are also frequent guests on the public radio variety show ''[[Live From Here]]''.}}

The band has uploaded numerous videos, including their annual, humorous Halloween covers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Love Shack cover – Lake Street Dive |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=19&v=Alg4eBa5hGU |publisher=Lake Street Dive|access-date=September 15, 2015}}</ref>

The band made some significant changes in their operations in 2015. In the winter of that year they started work with [[Dave Cobb]] on a new record/CD in Nashville, signed with [[Nonesuch Records]] in November, and prepared for the release of the new album. In 2015 they performed at only 98 venues. However, they toured Australia and New Zealand in March, then picked up their usual pace until December.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lake Street Dive Tour Dates |url=http://www.lakestreetdive.com/#!tour/cjg9 |publisher=lakestreetdive.com |access-date=September 15, 2015}}</ref> Their traditional Halloween video was "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqEiWN44L3M Bohemian Rhapsody]", done in the style of Queen.

===Nonesuch Records===
Lake Street Dive signed with [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2015 and released ''[[Side Pony]]'' in February 2016 with their new label.<ref>Nonesuch Journal, 12 November 2015,  [http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/lake-street-dive-nonesuch-debut-side-pony-february-19-tour-2015-11-12 Nonesuch Journal]</ref>  The album's name refers to a hairstyle adopted by Kearney and is slang for "unexpectedly diverting the mind's attention". The band made 183 appearances in 2017 and 2018, including tours through North America, Europe, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Lake Street Dive Tour Dates'' |url=http://www.lakestreetdive.com/#!tour/cjg9 |publisher=lakestreetdive.com|access-date= January 1, 2019}}</ref>

The band released their second album with Nonesuch, ''Free Yourself Up'' in May 2018. Kearney says, "This album is based in the realities in our time which have inevitably become part of everyone's daily life. It's something you think about and obsess over—and write songs about. Free Yourself Up is about empowering yourself, emboldening yourself, no matter what's going wrong."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/lake-street-dive-new-album-free-yourself-out-now-2018-05-04|title=Lake Street Dive's New Album, "Free Yourself Up," Out Now; Band Shares "Good Kisser" Video|date=2018-05-24|access-date=2019-04-21|website=nonesuch.com}}</ref> In November 2018, they released ''Freak Yourself Out'', a five-song EP of songs written but not recorded for ''Free Yourself Up''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/lake-street-dives-freak-yourself-out-vinyl-10-now-nonesuch-store-2018-12-07|title=Lake Street Dive's "Freak Yourself Out" Vinyl 10" Now in the Nonesuch Store – Nonesuch Records|website=Nonesuch Records Official Website|language=en|access-date=2019-01-02}}</ref>

On May 10, 2021, trumpeter and guitarist Mike "McDuck" Olson announced he would be leaving Lake Street Dive after 16 years of performing with the band.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mike 'McDuck' Olson Departs Lake Street Dive |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/lake-street-dive-mike-olson-departure |website=JamBase |access-date=10 May 2021}}</ref>

In 2021 the band was inter alia part of the [[Newport Folk Festival]] in July.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Newport Folk Festival stage schedule 2021 |url=https://newportfolk.org/2021-schedule/ |access-date=2021-09-21 |website=newportfolk.org}}</ref>

== Influences ==
All the band members were singing and/or playing musical instruments by the time they were in third grade. Most had some classical music training growing up and their parents were musicians. Each had migrated to jazz by the time they met. However, the band says they were influenced by the music their parents were playing at home. This ranged from classic jazz to '60s soul to rock and roll.<ref>{{cite interview| publisher=The Living Room|title=Artist-Rachael Price|location=New York, New York |date=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview| website=Perfectsnotes.blogspot.com |author = Bradley Carter| title=Interview with Bridget Kearney of Lake Street Dive | date= 2013}}</ref>

The band members profess to love the entire [[Beatles]] discography. Kearney wrote "Hello? Goodbye!" and the band plays "Don't Make Me Hold Your Hand", both referencing Beatles tunes. Olson says he was inspired by [[Paul McCartney]]'s love/vice lyrical concept in "Got to Get You Into My Life" when he wrote "You Go Down Smooth".

The band's traditional Halloween specials and covers on the EP release ''Fun Machine''<ref>{{Citation|title=Fun Machine Ep|date=2014-05-06|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fun-Machine-Lake-Street-Dive/dp/B008A3LZUS|publisher=Imports|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref> give an idea of the genres that influence them. These range from songs by [[the Mamas and the Papas]],<ref>{{Citation|last=Lake Street Dive|title=Lake Street Dive Plays "Dedicated To The One I Love". HAPPY HALLOWEEN!|date=2012-10-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTPwziETx8|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref> [[ABBA]], [[the Drifters]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Jackson 5]] and [[Paul McCartney]].

The band has been influenced by classic pop and swing era jazz. "We want it to sound like the Beatles and Motown had a party together," says drummer Mike Calabrese.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/04/lake-street-dive-beatles-motown-boston-jackson-5|title=Lake Street Dive: 'We aim to sound like the Beatles and Motown had a party'|last=John|first=Emma|date=2014-05-03|work=The Observer|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref> Critics describe their music as "Sounds Like: Llewyn Davis's favorite pop group; Motown meets the Brill Building in jazzy, soulful, woulda-been Sixties chart toppers."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/10-new-artists-you-need-to-know-january-2014-20140124/lake-street-dive-0466021|title=Lake Street Dive|date=January 24, 2014|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>

Price has said that the band's performances are influenced by the audience in front of them. "We are translating [crowd energy] on stage, trying to figure out what kind of energy to put out to the crowds. For the first time we feel we can mold the energy of a room."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicradioeast.org/post/after-years-performing-lake-street-dive-reaps-sold-out-shows|title=After Years Of Performing, Lake Street Dive Reaps Sold-Out Shows|website=Publicradioeast.org|access-date=13 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/07/07/328522745/lake-street-dive-and-the-chemistry-of-harmony|title=Lake Street Dive And The Chemistry Of Harmony|date=July 7, 2014|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en}}</ref>
