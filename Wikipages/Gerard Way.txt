==Early life==
Way was born in [[Summit, New Jersey]], on April 9, 1977,<ref name="BBC interview">{{Cite web |title=Radio 1 Presents...

His maternal grandmother, Elena Lee Rush, was a great creative influence who taught him to sing, paint, and perform from a young age; he has said that "she has taught me everything I know".<ref name="INO">{{Cite web |title=Gerard's Biography |url=http://www.imnotokay.net/my-chemical-romance/gerard-way/ |access-date=April 8, 2007 |publisher=ImNotOkay.net}}</ref>  Also, while in elementary school, the [[glam metal]] band [[Bon Jovi]] was instrumental in forming his love of music<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gerard Way & Jon Bon Jovi – Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY9qgRy-mXM |access-date=2012-03-14 |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> and [[Bruce Springsteen]] is the first concert that he watched ever.

At the age of 15, Way was held at gunpoint. As he said in an April 2008 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, "I got held up with a [[.357 Magnum]], had a gun pointed to my head and put on the floor, execution-style." He went on to say that "no matter how ugly the world gets or how stupid it shows me it is, I always have faith [in it]".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Future of Music: Gerard Way |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/future-of-music-gerard-way-20071115 |access-date=February 28, 2011 |publisher=rollingstone.com}}</ref> At age 16, he appeared on an episode of ''[[Sally (1983 TV series)|Sally Jesse Raphael]]'' to discuss the controversy surrounding the publicizing of serial killer [[Jeffrey Dahmer]]'s crimes in [[comic book]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Buzznet.com |date=February 27, 2008 |title=Sally Jesse Raphael with Hart D.

==Music career==
===2001–2013, 2019–present: My Chemical Romance===

[[File:Gerard Way East Scene.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Gerard Way in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], during the [[10th Annual Honda Civic Tour|Honda Civic Tour]] in August 2011]]
As teenagers, Gerard and his brother Mikey Way, who later became the bassist of [[My Chemical Romance]], were influenced by artists including [[Iron Maiden]], [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Morrissey]], and [[The Smiths]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=100 greatest artists of all time – Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/queen-20110426 |magazine=Rollingstone.com |access-date=4 October 2014}}</ref> Way originally wanted to be a guitarist. His grandmother bought him his first guitar at the age of eight, and he played in short-lived bands such as Ray Gun Jones and Nancy Drew with future bandmate Ray Toro. When he was not successful (one band kicked him out due to his lack of skill with the guitar), he chose to concentrate on his art career.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gerard Way at MASS Canvas |url=http://apps.masscanvas.com/facebook/artist/14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003021850/http://apps.masscanvas.com/facebook/artist/14 |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |access-date=February 12, 2014}}</ref>

Way was working as an intern for [[Cartoon Network]] in New York City during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Seeing the effects of the attacks first-hand prompted Way to change his views on life in the following weeks. He told ''Spin'' magazine, "I literally said to myself, 'Fuck art. I've gotta get out of the basement. I've gotta see the world. I've gotta make a difference.'"<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=May 31, 2005 |title=My Chemical Romance |url=https://www.spin.com/2005/05/my-chemical-romance/ |url-status=dead |magazine=Spin Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427170340/https://www.spin.com/2005/05/my-chemical-romance/ |archive-date=April 27, 2011}}</ref> To help deal with the emotional effects the attacks had on him, Way wrote the lyrics to the song "Skylines and Turnstiles", which became the first song by [[My Chemical Romance]].<ref name="Yahoo">{{Cite web |last=Alex Henderson |title=My Chemical Romance Biography |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/my-chemical-romance/biography/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812224542/http://new.music.yahoo.com/my-chemical-romance/biography/ |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |access-date=February 10, 2007 |publisher=Yahoo.com}} Retrieved from Internet Archive 13 February 2014.</ref>

Way has also contributed vocally to other bands' songs such as [[Every Time I Die|Every Time I Die's]] "Kill the Music", [[Head Automatica|Head Automatica's]] "Graduation Day", [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything's]] "In Defense of the Genre", and [[The Oval Portrait (band)|The Oval Portrait's]] "From My Cold Dead Hands" and "Barnabus Collins Has More Skeletons in His Closet Than Vincent Price".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gerard Way Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gerard-way-mn0000167530/credits |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref name="mtv.com">{{Cite web |title=Lions and Madsen and Every Time I Die Oh my! |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1509079/lions-and-madsen-and-every-time-i-die-oh-my/ |publisher=MTV}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Oval Portrait Life In Death |url=http://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=44516&amp}}</ref>

In interviews, Way has stated that music and his artwork were effective outlets for his longtime battles against [[clinical depression|depression]], [[alcoholism]], and [[substance abuse|prescription drug abuse]]. Using music to resolve personal battles has also led Way to create deeply personal songs such as "[[Helena (My Chemical Romance song)|Helena]]," which he wrote in memory of his late grandmother.<ref>{{Cite web |last=James Montgomery |title=My Chemical Romance: They're Okay (I Promise) |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/my_chemical_romance/news_feature_022805/ |access-date=February 13, 2014 |publisher=MTVNews.com}}</ref>

Way was credited as Garry Way.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Exclusive First Look at MCR's Gerard Way's On Raven's Wings |url=http://www.pulpsecret.com/post/5949/exclusive-first-look-at-mcrs-gerard-ways-on-ravens-wings |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204220325/http://www.pulpsecret.com/post/5949/exclusive-first-look-at-mcrs-gerard-ways-on-ravens-wings |archive-date=February 4, 2010 |publisher=pulpsecret.com}} Retrieved from Internet Archive 13 February 2014.</ref>

Way struggled with [[alcoholism]] and prescription drug addiction for many years but as of 2007 was maintaining sobriety.<ref name="INO" /> In a November 2010 issue of ''Spin'' magazine, he said that having become a happier person and feeling more in control, he had been able to enjoy the occasional recreational drink.<ref name="spin-nov-2010">{{Cite web |last=Eells |first=Josh |date=16 November 2010 |title=My Chemical Romance Bounce Back From The Brink |url=https://www.spin.com/2005/05/my-chemical-romance/-bounce-back-brink |access-date=7 November 2012 |publisher=Spin.com}}</ref>

On September 3, 2007, after a concert in Colorado, Way married Lyn-Z, bassist of [[Mindless Self Indulgence]], backstage on the final date of the [[Projekt Revolution]] tour. A member of Live Nation's touring staff who was also an ordained minister performed the low-key ceremony.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 5, 2007 |title=MCR: Gerard ties the knot |url=http://www2.kerrang.com/2007/09/mcr_gerard_ties_the_knot.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909100026/http://www2.kerrang.com/2007/09/mcr_gerard_ties_the_knot.html |archive-date=September 9, 2007 |access-date=September 5, 2007 |publisher=Kerrang Magazine}}</ref> Their daughter, Bandit Lee Way, was born on May 27, 2009.

In 2014, Way began openly discussing his [[gender identity]] struggles online and in interviews. In a [[Reddit]] [[R/IAmA|Ask Me Anything]] (AMA) hosted by Way in October 2014, he stated, "I have always been extremely sensitive to those that have gender identity issues as I feel like I have gone through it as well, if even on a smaller scale. I have always identified a fair amount with the female gender, and began at a certain point in MCR to express this through my look and performance style. So it's no surprise that all of my inspirations and style influences were pushing gender boundaries. Freddy [''sic''] Mercury, Bowie, Iggy, early glam, T-Rex. Masculinity to me has always made me feel like it wasn't right for me."<ref>{{Cite web |title=15 Things We Learned From Gerard Way's Reddit AMA |url=http://www.kerrang.com/23452/15-things-learned-gerard-ways-reddit-ama/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704211824/http://www.kerrang.com/23452/15-things-learned-gerard-ways-reddit-ama/ |archive-date=2015-07-04 |access-date=2015-06-03 |website=Kerrang.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Sherman |first=Maria |title=My Chemical Romance's Gerard Way Opens Up About Gender Identity |url=https://fuse.tv/2014/10/my-chemical-romance-gerard-way-gender-identity |access-date=2019-12-02 |website=Fuse.TV}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=r/IAmA – I am Gerard Way, musician, artist, creator, and cousin of Joe Rogan- Ask me anything!

In January 2015, Way was featured in ''The Boyzine'', an independent zine published by [[SWMRS]] frontman Cole Becker. Way again discussed his gender identity, commenting, "I never really subscribed to the archetype masculinity growing up, I had no interest in sports or anything like that. There was a time where I was called a girl so often that when I discovered the idea of transgenderism I considered myself to be more of a girl. So I identify with trans people and women a lot because I was a girl to a lot of people growing up."<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 19, 2015 |title=I Considered Myself To Be More Of A Girl" A Conversation With Gerard… |url=http://theboyzine.com/2015/01/i-considered-myself-to-be-more-of-a-girl-a-conversation-with-gerard-way/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150119081928/http://theboyzine.com/2015/01/i-considered-myself-to-be-more-of-a-girl-a-conversation-with-gerard-way/ |archive-date=January 19, 2015 |access-date=June 3, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> In June 2015, Way tweeted that he uses he/they pronouns.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 7, 2015 |title=no, was just commenting on the use of they/them as a widely accepted generic neutral pronoun.
