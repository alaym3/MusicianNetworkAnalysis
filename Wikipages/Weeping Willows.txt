'''Weeping Willows''' is a Swedish [[indie rock]] group that started in 1995.

==History==
The band's first two albums are primarily influenced by the [[popular music]] of the late 1950s to early 1960s.  With their third album ''Into the Light'', Weeping Willows took a stylistic turn towards a more modern sound with [[alternative rock]] leanings.

Singer Magnus Carlson has also made albums as a solo artist and sang with fellow Swedish band [[West End Girls (Swedish band)|West End Girls]] on a cover of the [[Pet Shop Boys]]' single "[[What Have I Done to Deserve This? (song)|What Have I Done to Deserve This?]]" in 2008.

The lyrics typically deal with unhappy love, loneliness and heart-ache.

In the end of August 2006 Weeping Willows were the 99th most successful band in Sweden since 1985 (just after [[Elton John]]) at the list ''Tracks'' (statistics maintained by the [[Swedish Radio]]).

In 2005 they were the at place 80 on the most played bands in the Swedish radio (with a top position of 5 in 2002). Most played songs are "Touch Me" (7th most played song in 2002 in Swedish Radio) and "Stairs" (8th most played song 2004 in Swedish Radio.)

The band has collaborated with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] member [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]] on several occasions. Weeping Willows guitarist/keyboardist Niko Röhlcke has also collaborated with English guitarist and singer/songwriter [[Marty Willson-Piper]] on a project called MOAT. They are currently working on their second release.
