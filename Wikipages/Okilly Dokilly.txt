'''Okilly Dokilly''' is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States, that plays "Nedal" music; a subgenre of metal music themed around the animated character [[Ned Flanders]] from the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. All four of the band's members perform dressed as Flanders, and the majority of the lyrics to their songs are quotes of his.

The band members go by the pseudonyms: Head Ned, Shred Ned, Zed Ned, Dread Ned and Bed Ned. The unusual concept behind the group has resulted in worldwide attention. The lead singer, Head Ned, said that Nedal music is "Not as fast as [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]<nowiki/>core, and a little cleaner than [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] Punk”, references to [[hardcore punk]] and [[crust punk]], respectively.

As of June 3, 2019, the band has acquired over 66,000 [[Like button|likes]] on [[Facebook]].<ref name="okilly1">{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/3997729/okilly-dokilly-ned-flanders-metal-band/|title=There's a Ned Flanders Metal Band Called Okilly Dokilly|website=Time.com|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="okilly2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/the-simpsons-ned-flanders-inspires-heavy-metal-band-to-create-nedal-music-20150814-giz4ez.html|title=The Simpsons' Ned Flanders inspires heavy metal band to create 'Nedal' music|first=Peter|last=Vincent|date=14 August 2015|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="okilly3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/blogs/sounddiego/Howdilly-Doodilly-Okilly-Dokilly-352962131.html|title=Say "Howdilly Doodilly" to Okilly Dokilly|website=Nbcsandiego.com|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="okilly4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/various-artists-841-1222823|title=Ned Flanders-themed band Okilly Dokilly reveal they are writing 'an ode to the Leftorium' |website=Nme.com|date=18 August 2015|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref> The band's first studio album, ''[[Howdilly Doodilly]]'', was released on November 11, 2016.<ref name="okilly5">{{Cite web|url=https://junkee.com/category/music|title=Music News, Views And All The Latest From Junkee|website=Junkee.com|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="okilly6">{{Cite web|url=https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/ned-flanders-themed-metal-band-okilly-dokilly-releasing-album/|title=That Ned Flanders-Themed Metal Band Okilly Dokilly Are Releasing An Album|date=1 November 2016|website=Musicfeeds.com.au|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref> They announced their first nationwide tour via YouTube on February 5, 2017.

Then 'The Simpsons' Called"|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> After the release of their second album, Okilly Dokilly spent the remainder of the year touring the United States and Europe. In early 2020, they released the single "Slaughterhouse" and toured in Australia, but the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] made further touring impossible. The ''When the Comet Gets Here Tour'' that was planned for April and May 2020 had to be postponed twice, at first to 2021 and then to 2022. On November 2, 2021, the band announced that the tour was renamed to ''Tourdilly Do '22'' and that it would be the last tour before an indefinite hiatus.
