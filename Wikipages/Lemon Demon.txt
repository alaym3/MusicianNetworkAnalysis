'''Lemon Demon''' is a musical project and band created by American comedian and musician [[Neil Cicierega]] in 2003 in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. Most Lemon Demon music is performed solely by Cicierega, who is the project's sole official member, but a full band is usually assembled for live performances. Cicierega previously released instrumental music and several remixes of video game music under the monikers "Trapezoid" and "Deporitaz".
