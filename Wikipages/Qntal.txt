'''Qntal''' is a [[Music of Germany|German]] "electro-medieval" [[band (music)|band]] founded in 1991 by Michael Popp and [[Ernst Horn]]. They later added [[singing|vocalist]] Syrah (Sigrid Hausen) to complete the band. It has roots in [[Estampie (band)|Estampie]], a band of similar genre but different style; Michael Popp and Syrah are the principal members. Horn left the group in 1999, to concentrate on his other band, [[Deine Lakaien]]. He later formed [[Helium Vola]] in 2001. Philipp Groth (a.k.a. Fil) then joined Qntal. In 2008, singer and violist Sarah M. Newman (Mariko) left the New York-based band [[Unto Ashes]] to work with Qntal and Estampie in Germany.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mariko—Folge deinem Traum |first=Christoph |last=Kutzer |journal=Zillo Medieval |language=de |page=45 |year=2012 |issue=2}}</ref>

The band's lyrics are primarily drawn from historical sources. Throughout their first three albums, lyrics were primarily in [[Latin]], medieval [[German language|German]],<!--This is Middle High German, correct?--> Galician-Portuguese and a few other European tongues. On ''Qntal IV'', the band added a few songs in [[English language|English]] to their body of work. Two tracks from this album, ''Cupido'' and ''Flamma'', reached the 2005 DAC, peaking at № 1 and № 8 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.djcharts.de/jahrescharts2005/DAC/index.html |title=Deutsche Alternative Charts - Jahrescharts 2005 - Top100 Single Charts |publisher=Djcharts.de |access-date=2012-09-27}}</ref>

"Qntal" is an unknown word that appeared in one of Syrah's dreams. Its pronunciation varies among sources. However, Syrah herself, during live performances, pronounces it {{IPA-de|kn̩tal|}}.

Qntal has headlined at significant goth and industrial music festivals such as [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] and [[M'era Luna Festival|M'era Luna]]. Qntal's debut U.S. concert took place in September 2004 at Dracula's Ball in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. In 2007, 2008, and 2011 the band was featured in the Bad Faerie Ball at the Baltimore FaerieCon.
