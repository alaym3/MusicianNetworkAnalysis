===''Transistor'' (2014)===
Korb would compose the soundtrack for ''[[Transistor (video game)|Transistor]]'', Supergiant Games' follow up to ''Bastion'', as well.<ref name=Freeman2014/> Korb described the genre of the ''Transistor'' soundtrack as "Old-world Electronic Post-rock".<ref>{{cite web|last=Pitcher|first=Jenna|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/26/5751006/transitor-soundtrack-new-genre-Old-world-Electronic-Post-rock|title=Transistor soundtrack creation saw vocals recorded in wardrobe and the birth of a new genre|website=Polygon|date=May 26, 2014|access-date=July 8, 2015}}</ref> Korb has stated that he and his team, "spent a lot of time prototyping the art and audio to make sure that they were 'of a piece' this time. That was one of our goals. ''Bastion'', I thought, turned out really nicely, but a goal on this project was to more seamlessly integrate the look and feel of the art with the feel of the audio."<ref name=Freeman2014/> Some of the music on soundtrack was composed to create feelings of tension; Korb has stated, "one thing I like to do for building tension is to have rhythmic elements that fight a bit. In 'Gateless', for example, the piece is in five but the bass line for the B section is in three, so it ends up feeling really tense. I also tend to use a lot of chords with close intervals for tension building as well."<ref name=VanOrd2014>{{cite web|last=VanOrd|first=Kevin|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-music-of-transistor-in-the-key-of-red/1100-6420099/|title=The Music of Transistor: In The Key of Red|publisher=Gamespot|date=June 4, 2014|access-date=July 8, 2015}}</ref> ''[[GameSpot]]'' also noted that Korb used "dissonant chords in the upper range to create unease".<ref name=VanOrd2014/>

On the instruments used in ''Transistor'', Korb has stated that "there is a lot of heavily delayed electric guitar and sampled drums, but I also tried to include a number of 'old-world' instruments: accordion, harp, mandolin, etc.".<ref name=VanOrd2014/> Korb worked with Barrett once again on ''Transistor'', as she voiced the game's protagonist, Red.<ref name=Martens2015>{{cite news|last=Martens|first=Todd|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/games/grammys-soundtrack-category-has-yet-to-embrace-video-game-scores/|title=Grammys soundtrack category has yet to embrace video game scores|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 7, 2015|access-date=July 8, 2015}}</ref> On their collaboration, Korb stated, "after working with Ashley on a couple projects now, I feel like I've gotten a better sense of how to write for her voice. For me, that's the main consideration that affects my writing process. Our sessions are pretty laid back. If a melody line doesn't feel quite right in her voice we will change it on the fly."<ref name=VanOrd2014/>
