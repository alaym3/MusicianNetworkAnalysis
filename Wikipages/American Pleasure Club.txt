'''American Pleasure Club''', also known as '''Teen Suicide''', is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

==History==
Teen Suicide formed initially as a solo project of [[Ricky Eat Acid|Sam Ray]] in 2009 and released a 2011 compilation, ''bad vibes forever'', which consisted of "early early demos." Soon after this, Eric Livingston joined the band making a duo with Ray on vocals, guitar, synthesizers, drum machines, and bass, and Livingston on drums and vocals, occasionally accompanied by various unofficial members such as Alec Simke and Caroline White.

In February of the following year, they released an EP titled ''DC snuff film''. They followed up that EP with a three-song EP titled ''goblin problems'' in June 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jewell|first1=Sean|title=Teen Suicide (the Band)|url=http://lineout.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2012/06/21/teen-suicide-the-band|publisher=The Stranger|accessdate=10 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132721/http://lineout.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2012/06/21/teen-suicide-the-band|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A full-length album entitled ''waste yrself'' was also being produced around the same time, but it was left uncompleted. Instead, the tracks intended for release on the album were included as part of the compilation Rarities, Unreleased Stuff, and Cool Things, then released separately shortly afterward.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teen Suicide - waste yrself|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/61095/Teen-Suicide-waste-yrself/|publisher=Sputnik Music}}</ref> In September 2012, Teen Suicide released their debut full-length album titled ''i will be my own hell because there is a devil inside my body''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teen Suicide: i will be my own hell because there is a devil inside my body|url=http://www.portalsmusic.com/2012/12/features/portals-albums-2012-2/|publisher=Portals Music|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Sacher|first1=Andrew|title=Alex G played Knitting Factory, touring with Teen Suicide|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/12/alex_g_played_k.html|publisher=Brooklyn Vegan|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref> Around this time, Alec Simke became a full-fledged member of the band.

Although their attitude towards recording and releasing new material was unclear after their reformation, Teen Suicide contributed a new song to Paper Trail Records' ''Thanks for Listening'' compilation<ref>{{cite web|url=https://papertrailrecords.bandcamp.com/album/thanks-for-listening|title=Thanks for Listening, by Paper Trail Records|website=Paper Trail Records|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref> and released a 7" entitled ''Sonic Youth'' on November 6, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joyvoid.com/products/561163-joy-void-001-sonic-youth-7|title=Joy Void #001 - 'Sonic Youth' 7|website=Joyvoid.com|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref> However, ''Sonic Youth'' is not officially credited to the band.
