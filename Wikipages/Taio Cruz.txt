Then in the UK we have [[The Saturdays]], [[JLS]], [[Daniel Merriweather]]—who've all been twittering and writing on their blogs how much they love them. So yeah, it's definitely my new album 'Rokstarr' and the fashion brand that are my two main focuses at the moment."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/456/taio_cruz_rokstarr_in_the_making |title=Rokstarr In The Making – Pete Lewis Interviews Taio Cruz |publisher=Blues & Soul |date=2 October 2009 |access-date=2 October 2009}}</ref>

Meanwhile, speaking again to Lewis in April 2010, Cruz gave his brand more free publicity: "We're currently looking to expand the brand and possibly go into things like watches. I've also got a new [[subsidiary]] of Rokstarr called 'Rok By Rokstarr'. And we've just started doing things like jeans and T-shirts, and stuff that more of the fans of Taio Cruz can buy. Because with Rokstarr in itself being so expensive, a lot of the kids out there who want to buy Rokstarr things can't. So we're bringing in stuff that's a little bit more High Street and more affordable."<ref>{{cite web| last= Lewis| first= Pete| title=Taio Cruz Comes Clean| url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/535/taio_cruz_comes_clean/ | work= Blues & Soul|access-date=27 April 2011|date=May 2010}}</ref>

In 2012 the brand, in a vain attempt to revive its fortunes was renamed to RXTR, a [[backronym]] for Riots and Twelve Rebels. The new name came along with new products, watches, which were immediately stocked at [[Selfridges]] on [[Oxford Street]] in London.<ref>[http://www.time2.co.uk/blog/time-chats-to-taio-cruz-at-ltd-s-rxtr-watch-launch/ "TIME² Chats To Taio Cruz At The LTD RXTR Watch Launch"]. Time2. Retrieved 11 July 2012</ref>

As of 2015, the RXTR website redirects to Cruz's personal website, and the brand's Facebook account has not been updated for over a year.

===Philanthropy===
Cruz filmed a public service announcement with [[Little Kids Rock]], a national nonprofit that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlekidsrock.org/friends/our-big-fans/taio-cruz/|title=Taio Cruz|work=Little Kids Rock|access-date=8 August 2015}}</ref>
