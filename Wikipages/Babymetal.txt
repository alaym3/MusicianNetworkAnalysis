{{Nihongo|'''Babymetal'''|ベビーメタル|Bebīmetaru|lead=yes}} (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese [[kawaii metal]] band. The band consists of [[Suzuka Nakamoto]] as "Su-metal" and [[Moa Kikuchi]] as "Moametal". The band is produced by [[Kobametal]] from the [[Amuse, Inc.|Amuse talent agency]]. Their vocals are backed by heavy metal instrumentation, performed by a group of [[session musicians]] known as the "Kami Band" at performances.

The band was formed in 2010, with the original lineup of Su-metal (vocal and dance), Moametal (scream and dance), and [[Yui Mizuno]] as "Yuimetal" (scream and dance), with the concept of creating a fusion of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Japanese idol]] genres. Originally a sub-unit of the Japanese idol group [[Sakura Gakuin]], Babymetal became an independent act in 2013, following Nakamoto's departure from Sakura Gakuin. Babymetal released their [[Babymetal (album)|eponymous debut album]] in February 2014. Their second album ''[[Metal Resistance]]'' was released worldwide in April 2016. Babymetal has also embarked on several tours, with a majority of their tour dates [[List of J-pop concerts held outside Asia|taking place outside of Asia]].

On October 19, 2018, Babymetal announced that Yui Mizuno had decided to leave the band due to poor health, following her absence from live performances since December 2017.<ref>{{Citation|title=BABYMETAL issue statement as Yuimetal leaves band and release surprise new track|date=October 28, 2019|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/babymetal-issue-statement-as-yuimetal-leaves-band-2391634/amp|access-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref> Since her departure, the band has performed with [[backup dancers]] at live performances. In 2019, the band introduced three backup dancers called "Avengers" who performed in rotation at each live show to form a trio with Moametal and Su-metal.

They have since been referred to by band members and fans as "Gods of Metal" and more recently "Kami Band". From late 2012 to early 2014, the two groups would alternate, with the Kami Band being used more for festival appearances and special events. At the Babymetal Death Match Tour in May 2013, the Kami Band performed all music live for the first time.<ref name="hwm">{{cite interview |last=Yamamoto |first=Noboru |interviewer=<!--- 山本昇 ---> |title=Hotwave |publisher=[[Television Saitama]] |location=[[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]] |date=June 19, 2013 }}</ref> As of early 2014, the Babybones band has been quietly retired, and the Kami Band has since been established as Babymetal's primary backing band.

The Kami Band has consisted of a rotating line-up of different musicians since its debut in late 2012. As of early 2018, however, the line-up has been relatively stable, consisting of guitarists [[Takayoshi Ohmura]], Leda, and Isao, bassist Boh, and drummers Hideki Aoyama and Yuya Maeta with members occasionally substituting for one another if needed. Kami Band member Leda has contributed to Babymetal's music, most notably on their album ''[[Metal Resistance]]'' (credited as Ledametal).

Babymetal's music videos, which showcase their distinct visual aesthetic, have helped the band gain broad attention. Their video for "Gimme Chocolate!!" went viral in 2014 with ''USA Today'''s Brian Mansfield commenting that the "video looks like some kind of bizarre animé, with a dark-goth set and band members playing in skeleton costumes, and the three girls execute intricate choreography, flash heart signs and make windmill arm motions like they're playing air guitar"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/03/06/babymetal-video-give-me-choco/6115605/|title=Babymetal's video is the greatest ever — or the worst|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=September 30, 2019}}</ref>

In regards to their music video for the song "Karate", Moametal said that she's "very proud that they are now representing this culture that came from Japan through their music, and it's a way for more people outside of Japan to also learn what karate is all about."<ref name="auto1"/> The lyrics talk about never giving up and moving forward. Yuimetal stated that the choreography for the song represented the lyrics and that "it's important to be able to express the messages that they want to put across through the music with their dance moves."<ref name="auto1"/> The majority of their lyrics are in Japanese and they see their choreography as a way to break the language barrier.<ref name="auto1"/>

According to Kei "[[Kobametal]]" Kobayashi, the band's executive producer, the band was formed under the idea of a new type of metal, and the members of the band receive "divine messages" from the Fox God, though Nakamoto explained that the messages received were indirect, as they would be sent to Kobametal first.<ref name="nylon">{{cite magazine |first=Mickey |last=Stanley |url=http://www.nylon.com/articles/baby-metal-interview |title=Japanese Idol Group Babymetal Talk Ariana Grande and The Fox God |magazine=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]] |date=September 24, 2015 |access-date=May 12, 2016}}</ref> He stated that it was up to the people's decision to accept or reject the idea.

The fanbase, collectively referred to as "The One",<ref name="nylon" /> has been noted by Mizuno to be a mixed demographic of varying age. Noting the fans of metal and pop, she described the "metalheads" who look like themselves, and the pop fans who dress and [[cosplay]] as them. She further emphasized the importance of being able to reach out to younger music fans branching out to the metal genre via Babymetal, noting her own lack of experience of metal before joining the band.<ref name="admit"/>
