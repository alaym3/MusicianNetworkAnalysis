'''Girls' Generation''' ({{ko-hhrm|소녀시대||Sonyeo Sidae}}), also known as '''SNSD''', is a South Korean [[girl group]] formed by [[SM Entertainment]]. The group is composed of eight members: [[Taeyeon]], [[Sunny (singer)|Sunny]], [[Tiffany Young|Tiffany]], [[Kim Hyo-yeon|Hyoyeon]], [[Kwon Yu-ri|Yuri]], [[Choi Soo-young|Sooyoung]], [[Im Yoon-ah|Yoona]], and [[Seohyun]]. Originally a nine-piece ensemble, [[Jessica Jung|Jessica]] departed from the group in September 2014. Among the prominent [[Korean wave|South Korean figures]] and most popular [[K-pop]] groups worldwide, Girls' Generation has earned [[List of awards and nominations received by Girls' Generation|numerous accolades]] and the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|honorific nickname]] "The Nation's Girl Group" in their home country.

Girls' Generation debuted on August 5, 2007, with the single "[[Into the New World (song)|Into the New World]]" from their [[Girls' Generation (2007 album)|eponymous Korean album]]. The group rose to fame in 2009 with the single "[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]", which claimed the top spot on [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]]'s ''[[Music Bank (TV series)|Music Bank]]'' for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was [[Melon (online music service)|Melon]]'s most popular song of the 2000s decade. The group consolidated their popularity in Asia with follow-up singles "[[Tell Me Your Wish (Genie) (song)|Genie]]", "[[Oh! (Girls' Generation song)|Oh!]]", and "[[Run Devil Run (Girls' Generation song)|Run Devil Run]]", which were released between mid-2009 and early 2010. Their second Korean studio album, ''[[Oh! (Girls' Generation album)|Oh!]]'' (2010), won the [[Golden Disc Awards|Golden Disc]] award for Album of the Year (Disk Daesang), making the group the first and only female act to win the Album Daesang.

Girls' Generation ventured into the Japanese music scene in 2011 with their [[Girls' Generation (2011 album)|eponymous Japanese album]], which became the first album by a non-Japanese girl group to be certified [[List of music recording certifications|million]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan|RIAJ]]. The group's third Korean studio album, ''[[The Boys (Girls' Generation album)|The Boys]]'', was the best-selling album of 2011 in South Korea. An English version of the single "[[The Boys (Girls' Generation song)|The Boys]]" was released in an attempt to expand the group's endeavor to the global music scene. The group's fourth Korean studio album, ''[[I Got a Boy]]'' (2013), was supported by the [[I Got a Boy (song)|title track]], which won Video of the Year at the inaugural [[YouTube Music Awards]]. Girls' Generation continued to build upon their popularity with their fifth and sixth Korean studio albums, ''[[Lion Heart (album)|Lion Heart]]'' (2015) and ''[[Holiday Night]]'' (2017).

The group's signature musical styles are characterized as [[electropop]] and [[bubblegum pop]], though their sound has varied widely, incorporating various genres including [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[electronic dance music|EDM]].

Ceejay Lee from feminist magazine ''[[Fem (magazine)|Fem]]'' criticized the "generic" themes of Korean girl groups like [[Wonder Girls]] or Girls' Generation as "sexist": "[They] infantilize themselves to emasculate males by pandering childlike, puritanical innocence [...] It only reinforces that females are weak beings that serve to gratify males and that males need to be 'man' enough to 'protect' them."<ref name="fem">{{cite web|url=http://femmagazine.com/2014/11/28/venturing-into-enemys-territory-k-pop-and-feminism/|title=Venturing into Enemy's Territory?

Writing for ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', Soyoung Kim wrote that "the representation of females in K-pop has been problematic" and singled out Girls' Generation's "Gee" as an embodiment; its repetitive lyrics "What should I do?" ({{lang|ko|어떻게?}}), "fool" ({{lang|ko|바보}}), or "I don't know" ({{lang|ko|몰라}}) suggest that the girls are "utterly clueless children" who "dumb [themselves] down" just to attract a partner. He further cited the single "I Got a Boy" as an epitome of the group's non-empowering lyrics, with lines such as "I got a boy, he's awesome / I got a boy, he's kind / I got a boy, handsome boy, my heart's been taken away [...] My prince! / When will you rescue me?"
