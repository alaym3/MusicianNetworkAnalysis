==History==
Formed in a suburb of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], United States, the Poni-Tails - Toni Cistone, Karen Topinka and Patti McCabe (Patricia Ann McCabe, July 6, 1939 – January 17, 1989)<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DykffzkFALoC&q=%22patti+mccabe%22+1939+1989&pg=PA404|title=Rock Obituaries: Knocking On Heaven's Door|first=Nick|last=Talevski|date=April 7, 2010|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9780857121172|via=Google Books}}</ref> - started singing at [[Charles F.

"Heart" was [[cover version|covered]] by the then-15-year-old [[Joy Layne]] and became a nationwide [[hit record|hit]].<ref name=amg>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p115134|pure_url=yes}} The Poni-Tails] at [[Allmusic]]</ref> The next release was "Can I Be Sure" on Marc Records, which was not a success; following this release Topinka left the group and was replaced by LaVerne Novak.

Soon after this, the group signed to [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount]] and released "Just My Luck to Be Fifteen", a flop.<ref name="Larkin"/> Following this was "Come on Joey, Dance With Me" b/w "[[Born Too Late (song)|Born Too Late]]". The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] was the one that caught the attention of [[radio]] DJs and became the group's biggest hit, reaching #11 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B singles chart]] and #7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1958. Follow-ups "Seven Minutes In Heaven" (#85 Pop) and "[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]" (#87 Pop) fared less well, and the group's last single, 1960's "Who, When And Why", did not chart.<ref name=amg/>

ABC-Paramount attempted to sign the group to a further five-year contract, but they turned it down. The members left the [[music industry]] and pursued careers in other fields in Ohio.<ref name="Larkin"/> They reunited to play a Cleveland festival, Moon Dog Coronation ball, in 1997.<ref name=amg/> A [[Compact disc|CD]] released by Poni Records with 12 tracks credited to the Poni-Tails contains only one Poni-Tails song ("[[Born Too Late (song)|Born Too Late]]") and 11 tracks recorded by other groups.<ref name=amg/>

In 1991, LaVerne (Novak) Glavac was working for a [[real estate]] agent in Mentor, Ohio, and had five grandchildren. Toni (Cistone) Costabile was working at a [[high school]] in [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]]. Patti (McCabe) Barnes died of [[cancer]] on January 17, 1989. Tom Illius subsequently became a top executive with the [[William Morris Agency]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He died on September 7, 2011, in Los Angeles.
