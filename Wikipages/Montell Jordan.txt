According to interviews with Jordan, musicians [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Shanice|Shanice Wilson]] attended the show. From there he made his first [[Mixtape|mix-tape]]  and flew out to New York with producer [[Russell Simmons]] of [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam Records]].

Jordan's first single was the 1995 No. 1 hit "[[This Is How We Do It]]," which sampled [[Slick Rick]]'s earlier Def Jam hit "[[Children's Story]]".<ref name="Larkin90"/> According to interviews with Jordan, the song is a "reflection of what street life was for a kid who grew up in the neighborhood."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/montell-jordan-is-now-a-megachurch-pastor-4169821|title=Montell Jordan Is Now a Megachurch Pastor|last=Nibokun|first=Imade|date=May 22, 2013|work=L.A.

Thanks to the enormous success of the single, Jordan's first album went platinum, selling over a million copies.

In 1996, Jordan opened for [[Boyz II Men]] in Vancouver. During the performance a staged flare disoriented him, causing him to fall off the seven-foot stage and hit his head. Despite being taken to the hospital, Jordan sustained no injuries. Jordan would later describe the event as a "modern-day miracle" and that he owed his life to Boyz II Men.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://religiomag.com/meeting-god-exclusive-interview-with-montell-jordan/|title=Meeting God: Exclusive Interview with Montell Jordan|date=February 24, 2016|work=Religio Magazine {{!}} Faith and Religion|access-date=April 17, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2003 Jordan left Def Soul, citing artistic differences as the reason for the departure. In recent interviews, Jordan recalls issues he had with his image under Def Soul. In particular, Jordan wished to leave his image as a sex symbol behind and mature artistically. Jordan was marketed as a sex icon since his start at Def Soul, despite having been married to Kristin Hudson before even signing. Whenever he was asked about his relationship status, Jordan would simply respond that he was "married to [his] music."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blackdoctor.org/470747/montell-jordan-megachurch-pastor/2/|title=Pastor Montell Jordan: 'This Is How God Does It'|date=December 4, 2015|work=BlackDoctor|access-date=April 17, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Realizing Def Soul was committed to maintaining Jordan's current image as their prominent R&B artist, Jordan left the label to sign with [[Entertainment One Music|Koch Records]].
