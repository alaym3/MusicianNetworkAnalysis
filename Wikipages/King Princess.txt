== Early life ==
Straus was born and raised in [[Brooklyn, New York]]; she is the child of recording engineer Oliver H. Straus Jr. and Agnes "Aggie" Mullaney. Her parents divorced while she was young. On her mother's side she is of Irish, Italian and Polish descent. On her father's side, her great-great-grandparents include [[Isidor Straus]], a U.S. Congressman and co-owner of [[Macy's]], and [[Ida Straus]]; they were from [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] families, who emigrated to the United States from the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The couple died in the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]] of the passenger ship [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].<ref>Straus, Isidor. Autobiography of Isidor Straus.

Straus spent much of her childhood following her father to work at his recording studio, Mission Sound. There, she learned several instruments, including [[bass guitar|bass]], guitar, piano, and drums, as well as music-production techniques and insight into the music industry. Straus' inspiration in those years had come from the rock music of the bands [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], as well as [[Jack White]].<ref name="vice" /> She attended high school at [[Avenues: The World School]], a private school in Manhattan, and played volleyball.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ny.milesplit.com/athletes/pro/4180778/stats | title=Mikaela Straus – Stats}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://issuu.com/thehighliner/docs/issue5 | title=Issue 5}}</ref>

After high school, Straus moved to Los Angeles to study at the [[USC Thornton School of Music]]. However, after a year, she dropped out in favor of her music career.<ref name="vice" />

== Career ==
[[File:King Princess Boston Close Up 1.25.19.jpg|thumb|left|King Princess performing at Royale in Boston, Massachusetts (2018)]]
A [[music label]] offered to sign Straus at the age of 11, but she refused to do so, because of her experience watching other artists work with a music label in her father's studio. The labels would control the artists' product, and change the feel of the music. She did not want to sign with a record label until she had a definition of her music, how she wanted to run the production and with whom she would work.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2D4dMc-Rnw "King Princess interview (part 1)"].

She finds “queer pop” to be troubling as [[sexuality]] is not a genre.<ref name=":0" /> She feels her success should be taken as the beginning of something bigger, and that we are ready [[queer culture]] and representation to become more mainstream.<ref name="Them" /> Her song [[1950 (song)|1950]] has particularly made an impact on pop music and queer culture<ref>{{Cite news|date=2019-01-10|title=BBC Sound of 2019: 'Queer icon' King Princess is the runner-up|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46757979|access-date=2021-11-24}}</ref> with the headliner song “[[Cheap Queen]]” not explicitly about [[queerness]] but rather classic pop lyrics about a relationship.<ref name=":3" /> This album has raised questions of [[cultural appropriation]] of [[fetishization]] of [[Drag queen|drag]] as KP is pictured on the alum art in full campy [[Drag queen|drag]] [[Cosmetics|makeup]], however these critiques emphasize [[Sex organ|genitalia]] and the physical body while [[Drag queen|drag]] is meant to be an inclusive deconstruction of [[gender]].<ref name=":3" />
