'''Zlatan Stipišić''' (born 13 August 1968), also known as '''Gibonni''', is a Croatian singer-songwriter and composer.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=V08A6qa0SwUC&pg=PA48&dq=Gibonni&hl=en&ei=3NzfS4SYAdGGkAWI7em3CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Gibonni&f=false Lonely Planet Croatia] by Vesna Maric.

Among his earliest solo works, "Činim pravu stvar" and "Divji cvit" are widely considered to be one of the most emotional Croatian-language songs of all time.<ref>[https://www.tportal.hr/showtime/clanak/gibonni-iskreno-zasto-rijetko-nastupa-kako-odmara-zivce-i-zbog-kojeg-se-poraza-osjecao-super-foto-20171002 Gibonni iskreno: Zašto rijetko nastupa, kako odmara živce i zbog kojeg se poraza osjećao super]</ref><ref>[https://100posto.jutarnji.hr/scena/znaju-se-cijeli-zivot-a-ona-je-zbog-njega-odustala-od-svojih-snova-a-financirala-kad-je-pocinjao-i-nista-mu-nije-islo-od-ruke LJUBAVNA PRIČA: SANJA I GIBONNI Znaju se cijeli život, a ona je zbog njega odustala od svojih snova, a financirala kad je počinjao i ništa mu nije išlo od ruke]</ref><ref>[https://www.hds.hr/clan/stipisic-gibonni-zlatan/ HDS Hr Gibonni (in Croatian)]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liberoportal.hr/foto-libar-zeljka-tutnjevica/stradun-nikad-puniji--pogledajte-tko-se-sve-zabavljao-na-koncertu-gibonnija-fotogalerija|title=Pogledajte tko se sve zabavljao na koncertu Gibonnija (FOTOGALERIJA)}}</ref>

==Career== 
Born in a family with a strong musical tradition (his father, [[Ljubo Stipišić|Ljubo]], was a well-known composer and poet), Zlatan Stipišić who later embraced the nickname ''Gibonni'', began his career in the 1980s with the heavy metal band [[Osmi putnik]]. After the group disbanded, Stipišić joined [[Divlje jagode]], recording a few demo tapes before disbanding. It was [[Zele Lipovača]], the [[lead guitar]]ist of Jagode, who gave Stipišić the nickname ''Gibonni''.<ref>[http://dnevnik.hr/showbizz/celebrity/ekskluzivno-poslusajte-kako-je-gibonni-pjevao-u-divljim-jagodama.html Ovo sigurno niste znali o Gibonniju]. ''dnevnik.hr''. Retrieved April 14, 2012.</ref>

Gibonni started his solo career in the 1990s with songs that combined elements of rock, modern pop and Dalmatian folk songs. He soon created a huge following, especially among Croatian youth. Gibonni's popularity continued to grow beyond Croatia and he is currently one of the most popular and influential musicians in the territories of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Gibonni wrote the song "Cesarica" for [[Oliver Dragojević]] which became one of Oliver's signature hit songs and one of the most popular and well-known songs in Croatia.

In 2003 Stipišić was appointed a [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]]. He is involved in many humanitarian concerts and organizations fighting hunger and poverty. Gibonni released his long-awaited and critically appraised album ''Unca fibre'' in May 2006, after a five-year period following his award-winning album ''Mirakul''. In 2010 he released the album ''Toleranca'', and in 2013, he released ''20th Century Man'', sung entirely in English. This album was used partially as a fundraiser for SOS children's village.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ina.hr/default.aspx?id=6701|title=Zamjena koksnih komora na postrojenju Kokinga KP-4 u Rafineriji nafte Sisak po sistemu "ključ u ruke"|website=ina.hr}}</ref> In 2016 Gibonni released the album ''Familija'', which was made in collaboration with Oliver Dragojević, featuring 10 tracks. Soon afterwards, Gibonni released his Best of Collection consisting of his most popular songs, including some from his early 90s career.<ref name="spotify.com">{{cite web|url=https://play.spotify.com/album/6udkwQUjEFn2qpgWDHCRYg|title=Familija|date=8 April 2016}}</ref>
