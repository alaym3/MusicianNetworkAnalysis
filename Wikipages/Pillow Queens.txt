'''Pillow Queens''' are an Irish indie rock band from [[Dublin]].<ref name="irishtimes2018">{{cite web|work=[[The Irish Times]]|title=Pillow Queens: 'If I saw a band like us onstage, I'd be obsessed'|author=Una Mullally|date=2018-07-18|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/pillow-queens-if-i-saw-a-band-like-us-onstage-i-d-be-obsessed-1.3571398}}</ref><ref name="othervoices">{{cite web|work=[[Other Voices (Irish TV series)|Other Voices]]|title=Pillow Queens Q&A|author= Danny Carroll|date=2019-08-23|url=https://www.othervoices.ie/content/pillow-queens-qa}}</ref>

==History==

Pillow Queens was started by Sarah Corcoran and Pamela Connolly.<ref name="irishtimes2018"/> After leaving their previous bands, the two wanted to go further with their new band, which they decided would consist of four queer women.<ref name="thelineofbestfit2020">{{cite web|work=[[The Line Of Best Fit]]|title=Queerness is in Pillow Queens' DNA|author=Mia Hughes|date=2020-09-20|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/queerness-is-in-pillow-queens-dna}}</ref> They were then joined by Cathy McGuinness and Rachel Lyons, who they had known for years. In late 2016 the group released their first demo EP entitled ''Calm Girls''.<ref name="othervoices"/> The release of this record was followed by performances on the Irish festival circuit, including at [[Electric Picnic]] and All Together Now.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nialler9.com/all-together-now-irish-2019-2/ |title=10 Irish acts to see at this year's All Together Now |publisher=Nialler9 |date=2019-07-30 |accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.electricpicnic.ie/line-up/artist/pillow-queens |title=Pillow Queens &#124; Electric Picnic |publisher=Electricpicnic.ie |date=2019-09-01 |accessdate=2019-09-12}}</ref> After the release of their second EP, ''State of the State'', the group performed with the likes of [[Pussy Riot]], [[Future Islands]], [[Idles (band)|Idles]] and performed in the [[Irish Music Rights Organisation|IMRO]] room at ''[[Other Voices (Irish TV series)|Other Voices]]''.<ref name="irishtimes2018"/>
 
In a mid-2019 interview with [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], the band stated that they were in the studio working on their debut LP, tentatively due to be released in mid-2020.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|title=Interview: Pillow Queens dream a little dream|author=Michael Donovan|date=2019-06-19|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2019/0619/1056331-interview-pillow-queens-dream-a-little-dream/}}</ref> On 1 November 2019, Pillow Queens released the single "Brothers",<ref name=brothers>{{cite web|work=[[iTunes]]|title=Brothers|author=Apple Music|date=2019-11-01|url=https://music.apple.com/ie/album/brothers-single/1482240747}}</ref> and the accompanying "Brothers (Acoustic)".<ref name=brothersacoustic>{{cite web|work=[[iTunes]]|title=Brothers (Acoustic)|author=Apple Music|date=2019-11-01|url=https://music.apple.com/ie/album/brothers-acoustic-single/1482241498}}</ref>{{better source|date=September 2020}} The band played two further songs from their upcoming album, "Child of Prague" and "Liffey", on 9 November 2019, during a set in [[Reykjavík]] as part of [[Iceland Airwaves]] 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pillow Queens - Full Performance (Live on KEXP)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=2020-02-11|accessdate=2020-09-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhINlOM1pbY&t=644s&ab_channel=KEXP}}</ref>

In 2020, their single ''Gay Girls'' featured on the soundtrack to the Amazon Original Irish film ''[[Dating Amber]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Clayton-Lea|first=Sarah|title='Gay Girls' Features on Soundtrack of Irish Film, Dating Amber – Pillow Queens|url=https://pillowqueens.com/gay-girls-features-on-soundtrack-of-irish-film-dating-amber/|access-date=2020-06-28|language=en-US}}</ref> That year, the band also were part of "[[Irish Women in Harmony]]", an [[Irish people|Irish]] collective of female singers and musicians that recorded a version of [[Dreams (The Cranberries song)|Dreams]] in aid of the charity ''SafeIreland'', which deals with [[domestic abuse]] which had reportedly risen significantly during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland|COVID-19 lockdown]].<ref name="it-1">{{cite news |last1=Bol |first1=Rosita |title=Irish Women in Harmony record Cranberries song in aid of Safe Ireland |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/irish-women-in-harmony-record-cranberries-song-in-aid-of-safe-ireland-1.4283348 |accessdate=3 July 2020 |work=The Irish Times |language=en}}</ref>

The band announced on 10 February 2021 that they had signed to the record label [[Sub Pop]]'s publishing arm<ref>{{Cite news|date=11 January 2021|title=Pillow Queens sign deal with Seattle label Sub Pop|work=RTÉ|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2021/0211/1196446-pillow-queens/|access-date=6 August 2021}}</ref> and confirmed in August of that year they had begun recording their second LP.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1422851594173964289|user=PillowQueens|title=Album 2 is it?

==Style==

The band has both pop and punk influences; however, they have been hesitant to define their work as either, in order to avoid being labeled.<ref name="paste2019">{{cite web|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|title=Meet Pillow Queens, the Irish Band Making "Puppy Pop"|author=Clare Martin|date=2019-01-25|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/01/meet-pillow-queens-the-irish-band-making-puppy-pop.html}}</ref>

Pillow Queens have been described by [[Paste (magazine)|Paste magazine]] as having a "sonic palette" crossed with "ragged-edged" guitars, combined with "smooth harmonies".<ref name="paste2019"/>
