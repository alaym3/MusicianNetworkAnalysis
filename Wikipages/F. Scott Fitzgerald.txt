'''Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald''' (September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940) was an American novelist, essayist, short story writer and screenwriter. He was best known for his novels depicting the flamboyance and excess of the [[Jazz Age]]—a term [[Tales of the Jazz Age|he popularized]]. During his lifetime, he published four novels, four story collections, and 164 short stories. Although he achieved temporary popular success and fortune in the 1920s, Fitzgerald received critical acclaim only after his death and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.

Born into a middle-class family in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], Fitzgerald was raised primarily in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]] where he befriended future literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]]. Owing to a failed romantic relationship with Chicago socialite [[Ginevra King]], he dropped out in 1917 to join the [[United States Army]] during [[World War I]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he met [[Zelda Sayre]], a Southern debutante who belonged to Montgomery's exclusive country-club set. Although she initially rejected Fitzgerald's marriage proposal due to his lack of financial prospects, Zelda agreed to marry him after he published the commercially successful ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). The novel became a cultural sensation and cemented his reputation as one of the eminent writers of the decade.

His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him further into the cultural elite. To maintain his affluent lifestyle, he wrote numerous stories for popular magazines such as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', and ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]''. During this period, Fitzgerald frequented Europe, where he befriended [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the "[[Lost Generation]]" expatriate community, including [[Ernest Hemingway]]. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), received generally favorable reviews but was a commercial failure, selling fewer than 23,000 copies in its first year. Despite its lackluster debut, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now hailed by some literary critics as the "[[Great American Novel]]". Following the deterioration of his wife's mental health and her placement in a mental institute for [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).

Struggling financially because of the declining popularity of his works amid the [[Great Depression]], Fitzgerald moved to [[Hollywood]] where he embarked upon an unsuccessful career as a screenwriter. While living in Hollywood, he cohabited with columnist [[Sheilah Graham]], his final companion before his death. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he attained sobriety only to die of a heart attack in 1940, at 44. His friend Edmund Wilson completed and published an unfinished fifth novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), after Fitzgerald's death.

Born on September 24, 1896, in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to a middle-class [[Catholicism|Catholic]] family, Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was named after his distant cousin, [[Francis Scott Key]], who wrote the lyrics for the American national anthem "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]".{{efn|name=Namesake|Fitzgerald was also named after his deceased sister, Louise Scott Fitzgerald, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth.{{sfn|Schiff|2001|p=21}}}}{{sfnm|Mizener|2020|Donaldson|1983|2p=2}} His mother was Mary "Molly" McQuillan Fitzgerald, the daughter of an Irish immigrant who became wealthy as a wholesale grocer.{{sfnm|Donaldson|1983|1p=2|Bruccoli|2002|2p=5}} His father, Edward Fitzgerald, descended from [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[English American|English]] ancestry,<ref>{{harvnb|Donaldson|1983|p=2}}: Fitzgerald wrote in a letter to John O'Hara: "I am half black Irish and half [[Old Stock Americans|old American stock]] with the usual exaggerated ancestral pretensions."</ref> and had moved to Minnesota from Maryland after the [[American Civil War]] to open a wicker-furniture manufacturing business.{{sfn|Turnbull|1962|p=6}} Edward's first cousin twice removed, [[Mary Surratt]], was hanged in 1865 for conspiring to assassinate [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfnm|Mizener|1951|1p=2|Bruccoli|2002|2p=11}}

Living in luxury at the [[New York Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in New York City,{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|p=128}} the newlywed couple became national celebrities, as much for their wild behavior as for the success of Fitzgerald's novel.

Fitzgerald's ephemeral happiness mirrored the societal giddiness of the Jazz Age, a term which [[Tales of the Jazz Age|he popularized]] in his essays and stories.{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1p=224|Mizener|1951|2p=110}} He described the era as racing "along under its own power, served by great filling stations full of money."<ref name="Filling stations">{{harvnb|Fitzgerald|1945|p=18}}: "In any case, the Jazz Age now raced along under its own power, served by great filling stations full of money."</ref> In Fitzgerald's eyes, the era represented a morally permissive time when Americans became disillusioned with prevailing [[social norms]] and obsessed with self-gratification.<ref name="Hedonism">{{harvnb|Fitzgerald|1945|p=15}}: "[The Jazz Age represented] a whole race going hedonistic, deciding on pleasure."</ref> 

During this hedonistic era, alcohol increasingly fueled the Fitzgeralds' social life,{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=131–132}} and the couple consumed [[Gin and juice (cocktail)|gin-and-fruit concoctions]] at every outing.{{sfn|Turnbull|1962|p=110}} Publicly, their alcohol intake meant little more than napping at parties, but privately it led to bitter quarrels.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=131–132}} 

As their quarrels worsened, the couple accused each other of marital infidelities.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|p=479}} They remarked to friends that their marriage would not last much longer.{{sfn|Turnbull|1962|p=112}}  After their eviction from the Commodore Hotel in May 1920, the couple spent the summer in a cottage in [[Westport, Connecticut]], near [[Long Island Sound]].{{sfn|Turnbull|1962|p=110}}

The Fitzgeralds rented "Ellerslie", a mansion near [[Wilmington, Delaware]], until 1929.{{sfn|Turnbull|1962|p=171}} Fitzgerald returned to his fourth novel but proved unable to make any progress due to his alcoholism and poor work ethic.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=261, 267}} In Spring 1929, the couple returned to Europe.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|p=269}} That winter, Zelda's behavior grew increasingly erratic and violent.{{sfnm|Bruccoli|2002|1pp=288–289|Milford|1970|2p=156}} During an automobile trip to Paris along the mountainous roads of the [[Grande Corniche]], Zelda seized the car's steering wheel and tried to kill herself, Fitzgerald, and their 9-year-old daughter by driving over a cliff.{{sfn|Milford|1970|p=156}} Following this homicidal incident, doctors diagnosed Zelda with [[schizophrenia]] in June 1930.{{sfnm|Mizener|1951|1p=217|Tate|1998|2p=23}}<ref>{{harvnb|Milford|1970|p=179}}: Zelda's biographer, Nancy Milford, quotes Dr. Oscar Forel's psychiatric diagnosis: "The more I saw Zelda, the more I thought at the time: she is neither a pure neurosis (meaning psychogenic) nor a real psychosis—I considered her a constitutional, emotionally unbalanced psychopath—she may improve, never completely recover."</ref> The couple traveled to [[Switzerland]], where she underwent treatment at a clinic.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|p=291}} They returned to America in September 1931.{{sfnm|1a1=Bruccoli|1y=2002|1p=313|2a1=Bruccoli|2a2=Baughman|2y=1996|2p=3}} In February 1932, she underwent hospitalization at the [[Phipps Clinic]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland.{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1p=204|Milford|1970|2p=210}}

Mencken]] believed Fitzgerald's career as a novelist was in jeopardy due to his wife's mental illness.]]
In April 1932, when the psychiatric clinic allowed Zelda to travel with her husband, Fitzgerald took her to lunch with critic H. L. Mencken, now the literary editor of ''[[The American Mercury]]''.{{sfn|Mencken|1989|pp=44–45}} In his private diary, Mencken noted Zelda "went insane in Paris a year or so ago, and is still plainly more or less off her base."{{sfn|Mencken|1989|pp=44–45}} Throughout the luncheon, she manifested signs of mental distress.{{sfn|Mencken|1989|pp=44–45}} A year later, when Mencken met Zelda for the last time, he described her mental illness as immediately evident to any onlooker and her mind as "only half sane."{{sfn|Mencken|1989|p=56}} He regretted Fitzgerald could not write novels, as he had to write magazine stories to pay for Zelda's psychiatric treatment.{{sfn|Mencken|1989|pp=44–45}}

During this time, Fitzgerald rented the "La Paix" estate in the suburb of [[Towson, Maryland]], and worked on his next novel, which drew heavily on recent experiences.{{sfn|Bruccoli|Baughman|1996|pp=3–4}} The story concerned a promising young American named Dick Diver who marries a mentally ill young woman; their marriage deteriorates while they are abroad in Europe.{{sfn|Bruccoli|Baughman|1996|pp=3–4}} While Fitzgerald labored on his novel, Zelda wrote—and sent to Scribner's—her own fictionalized version of these same autobiographical events in ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'' (1932).{{sfn|Milford|1970|p=220}} Piqued by what he saw as theft of his novel's plot material, Fitzgerald would later describe Zelda as a plagiarist and a third-rate writer.{{efn|name=Plagiarism|Fitzgerald objected to Zelda naming her heroine's husband Amory Blaine, the name of the protagonist in ''[[This Side of Paradise]]''.{{sfn|Berg|1978|p=235}}}}{{sfn|Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald|2002|p=162}} Despite his annoyance, he insisted upon few revisions to the work,{{efn|name=Revisions|Contrary to [[Nancy Milford]]'s 1970 biography ''Zelda'',{{sfn|Milford|1970|p=225}} scholarly examinations of Zelda's earlier drafts of ''Save Me the Waltz'' and the final version discerned fewer alterations than previously claimed.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald|2002|p=162}} According to [[Matthew J. Bruccoli]], the revised galleys were "in Zelda Fitzgerald's hand. F. Scott Fitzgerald did not systematically work on the surviving proofs: only eight of the words written on them are clearly in his hand."{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1991|p=9}}}} and he persuaded Perkins to publish Zelda's novel.{{sfnm|1a1=Fitzgerald|1a2=Fitzgerald|1y=2002|1p=162|2a1=Fitzgerald|2y=1991|2p=9}} Scribner's published Zelda's novel in October 1932, but it was a commercial and critical failure.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=327–328}}

Fitzgerald's own novel debuted in April 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' and received mixed reviews.{{sfnm|1a1=Bruccoli|1a2=Baughman|1y=1996|1p=28|2a1=Turnbull|2y=1962|2p=243}} Its structure threw off many critics who felt Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.{{sfn|Turnbull|1962|p=243}} Hemingway and others argued that such criticism stemmed from superficial readings of the material and from Depression-era America's reaction to Fitzgerald's status as a symbol of Jazz Age excess.{{sfn|Stern|1970|p=96}} The novel did not sell well upon publication, with approximately 12,000 sold in the first three months,{{sfnm|Cowley|1951|Turnbull|1962|2p=246}} but, like ''The Great Gatsby'', the book's reputation has since risen significantly.{{sfn|Bruccoli|Baughman|1996|pp=50, 157}}

Amid the [[Great Depression]], Fitzgerald's works were deemed elitist and materialistic.{{sfnm|Josephson|1933|Mizener|1960}} In 1933, journalist [[Matthew Josephson]] criticized Fitzgerald's short stories saying that many Americans could no longer afford to drink champagne whenever they pleased or to go on vacation to [[Montparnasse]] in Paris.{{sfnm|Josephson|1933|Mizener|1960}} As writer [[Budd Schulberg]] recalled, "my generation thought of F. Scott Fitzgerald as an age rather than a writer, and when the economic stroke of 1929 began to change the [[The Sheik (film)|sheiks]]{{efn|name=Sheiks|A "[[The Sheik (film)|sheik]]" referred to young men in the [[Jazz Age]] who imitated the appearance and dress of iconic film star [[Rudolph Valentino]].{{sfn|Savage|2007|pp=206–207, 225–226}} The female equivalent of a "sheik" was called a "sheba".{{sfn|Perrett|1982|pp=151–152}} Both "sheiks" and "shebas" were older in age than the younger "[[flapper]]" generation who were children during World War I.{{sfn|Perrett|1982|pp=151–152}}}} and [[flappers]] into unemployed boys or underpaid girls, we consciously and a little belligerently turned our backs on Fitzgerald."{{sfnm|Kazin|1951|1p=110|Rodgers|2005|2p=376}}

With his popularity decreased, Fitzgerald began to suffer financially and, by 1936, his book royalties amounted to $80.{{sfn|Fassler|2013}} The cost of his opulent lifestyle and Zelda's medical bills quickly caught up, placing him in constant debt. He relied on loans from his agent, [[Harold Ober]], and publisher Perkins.{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1pp=299–300|Mizener|1951|2pp=283–284}} When Ober ceased advancing money, an ashamed Fitzgerald severed ties with his agent believing Ober had lost faith in him due to his alcoholism.{{sfnm|1a1=Turnbull|1y=1962|1pp=299–300|2a1=Mizener|2y=1951|2pp=283–284|3a1=Rath|3a2=Gulli|3y=2015}}

As he had been an alcoholic for many years,{{efn|name=Fitzgerald's alcoholism|In a letter, Fitzgerald insisted he only became an alcoholic after college.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|p=479}} He wrote that he had never been "drunk at Princeton—or in the army, except one night when I retired to the locker room."{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|p=479}}}} Fitzgerald's heavy drinking undermined his health by the late 1930s.{{sfn|Markel|2017}} His alcoholism resulted in [[cardiomyopathy]], [[coronary artery disease]], [[angina]], [[dyspnea]], and [[Arrhythmia|syncopal spells]].{{sfn|Markel|2017}} According to biographer [[Nancy Milford]], Fitzgerald's claims of having [[tuberculosis]] (TB) served as a pretext to cover his drinking ailments.{{sfn|Milford|1970|p=183}} Fitzgerald scholar [[Matthew J. Bruccoli]] contends Fitzgerald did in fact have recurring TB.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=60, 269, 300, 327}} Another biographer, [[Arthur Mizener]], notes Fitzgerald suffered a mild attack of TB in 1919 and conclusively had a tubercular hemorrhage in 1929.{{sfn|Mizener|1951|p=259}} In the 1930s, as his health deteriorated, Fitzgerald had told Hemingway of his fear of dying from congested lungs.{{sfn|Hemingway|1964|pp=163–164}}

Fitzgerald's deteriorating health, chronic alcoholism, and financial woes made for difficult years in Baltimore. His friend H. L. Mencken wrote in a June 1934 diary entry that "the case of F. Scott Fitzgerald has become distressing. He is boozing in a wild manner and has become a nuisance. His wife, Zelda, who has been insane for years, is now confined at the Sheppard-Pratt Hospital, and he is living in Park Avenue with his little daughter, Scottie".{{sfn|Mencken|1989|pp=62–63}} By 1935, alcoholism disrupted Fitzgerald's writing and limited his mental acuity.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1966|p=286}} From 1933 to 1937, he was hospitalized for alcoholism eight times.{{sfn|Markel|2017}} In September 1936, journalist Michel Mok of the ''[[New York Post]]'' publicly reported Fitzgerald's alcoholism and career failure in a nationally syndicated article.{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1pp=279–280|Fitzgerald|2004|2pp=xiv, 123–125}} The article damaged Fitzgerald's reputation and prompted him to attempt suicide after reading it.{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1p=280|Fitzgerald|2004|2pp=xiv, 123–125|McInerney|2007}}

By that same year, Zelda's intense suicidal mania necessitated her extended confinement at the [[Highland Mental Hospital|Highland Hospital]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].{{sfnm|Bruccoli|2002|1p=480|Milford|1970|2p=308}} Nearly bankrupt, Fitzgerald spent most of 1936 and 1937 living in cheap hotels near Asheville.{{sfnm|Mizener|1951|1pp=257–259|Turnbull|1962|2p=257|Bruccoli|2002|3pp=393–394}} His attempts to write and sell more short stories faltered.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=405, 408}} He later referred to this period of decline in his life as "The Crack-Up" in a [[The Crack-Up|short story]].{{sfnm|Tate|1998|1p=43|Fitzgerald|1936|Bruccoli|2002|3pp=400–401}} The sudden death of Fitzgerald's mother and Zelda's mental deterioration led to his marriage further disintegrating.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=405–407}} He saw Zelda for the last time on a 1939 trip to Cuba.{{sfn|Fassler|2013}} During this trip, spectators at a [[cockfight]] beat Fitzgerald when he tried to intervene against [[animal cruelty]].{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1pp=298–299|Mizener|1951|2p=283}} He returned to the United States and—his ill-health exacerbated by excessive drinking—underwent hospitalization at the [[Doctors Hospital (Manhattan)|Doctors Hospital]] in Manhattan.{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1pp=298–299|Mizener|1951|2p=283}}

=== Return to Hollywood ===

Fitzgerald's dire financial straits compelled him to accept a lucrative contract as a [[screenwriter]] with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) in 1937 that necessitated his relocation to Hollywood.{{sfn|Hook|2002|p=90}}{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|p=200}} Despite earning his highest annual income up to that point ($29,757.87, {{Inflation|US|29757.87|1937|fmt=eq}}),{{sfn|Hook|2002|p=90}} Fitzgerald spent the bulk of his income on Zelda's psychiatric treatment and his daughter Scottie's school expenses.{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1a2=Frank|1y=1958|1p=188|2a1=Ring|2y=1985|2p=114}} During the next two years, Fitzgerald rented a cheap room at the [[Garden of Allah Hotel|Garden of Allah bungalow]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. In an effort to abstain from alcohol, Fitzgerald drank large amounts of [[Coca-Cola]] and ate many sweets.{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1a2=Frank|1y=1958|1p=273|2a1=Fitzgerald|2y=1966|2p=150}}

Estranged from Zelda, Fitzgerald attempted to reunite with his first love Ginevra King when the wealthy Chicago heiress visited Hollywood in 1938.{{sfnm|West|2005|1pp=86–87|Corrigan|2014|2p=59|Smith|2003}} "She was the first girl I ever loved and I have faithfully avoided seeing her up to this moment to keep the illusion perfect," Fitzgerald informed his daughter Scottie, shortly before the planned meeting.{{sfn|Smith|2003}} The reunion proved a disaster due to Fitzgerald's uncontrollable alcoholism, and a disappointed Ginevra returned east to Chicago.{{sfnm|West|2005|1pp=86–87|Corrigan|2014|2p=59|Smith|2003}}

Soon after, a lonely Fitzgerald began a relationship with nationally syndicated gossip columnist [[Sheilah Graham]], his final companion before his death.{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|pp=vii–ix, 172–173}} After a heart-attack in [[Schwab's Drug Store]], a doctor ordered Fitzgerald to avoid strenuous exertion. Fitzgerald had to climb two flights of stairs to his apartment, while Graham lived on the ground floor.{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1a2=Frank|1y=1958|1p=323|2a1=Fitzgerald|2y=1966|2pp=117, 151}} Consequently, he moved in with Graham, who lived in Hollywood on North Hayworth Avenue, one block east of Fitzgerald's apartment on North Laurel Avenue.{{sfnm|Ring|1985|1p=104|Bruccoli|2002|2p=485}}

Throughout their relationship, Graham claimed Fitzgerald suffered from constant guilt over Zelda's mental illness and confinement.<ref>{{harvnb|Graham|Frank|1958|p=308}}: "The day came when he realized he was drinking to escape—not only to escape the growing sense of his wasted potentialities but also to dull the guilt he felt over Zelda. 'I feel that I am responsible for what happened to her. I could no longer bear what became of her.'"</ref> He repeatedly attempted sobriety, suffered from depression, had violent outbursts, and attempted suicide.{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|pp=255–257, 275, 281, 296, 309}} On occasions that Fitzgerald failed his attempt at sobriety,{{efn|name=Fitzgerald Drinking|According to Graham, Fitzgerald "had begun drinking, as a young man, because in those days everyone drank. 'Zelda and I drank with them. I was able to drink and enjoy it. I thought all I needed anywhere in the world to make a living was a pencil and paper. Then I found I needed liquor too. I needed it to write.'"{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|p=308}}}} he would ask strangers, "I'm F. Scott Fitzgerald. You've read my books. You've read ''The Great Gatsby,'' haven't you? Remember?"{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|p=202}} As Graham had read none of his works, Fitzgerald attempted to buy her a set of his novels.{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|pp=186–187}} After visiting several bookstores, he realized they had stopped carrying his works.{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|pp=186–187}} The realization that he was largely forgotten as an author further depressed him.<ref>{{harvnb|Graham|Frank|1958|p=217}}: Upon realizing that no one attended stage adaptations of his works, Fitzgerald became "silent and depressed".</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Turnbull|1962|p=110}}: Scott believed, "as Oscar Wilde said, [that] the only thing worse than being talked about is being forgotten."</ref>

During this last phase of his career, Fitzgerald's screenwriting tasks included revisions on ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'' (1943) and an unused dialogue polish for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939)—a book which Fitzgerald disparaged as unoriginal and an "old wives' tale".{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1pp=294–295|Mizener|1951|2pp=282–283}} Both assignments went uncredited.{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1pp=294–295|Mizener|1951|2pp=282–283}} His work on ''[[Three Comrades (1938 film)|Three Comrades]]'' (1938) became his sole screenplay credit.{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1pp=294–295|Mizener|1951|2pp=282–283}} To the studio's annoyance, Fitzgerald ignored scriptwriting rules and included descriptions more fitting for a novel.{{sfn|Brooks|2011|pp=174–176}} In his spare time, he worked on his fifth novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'',{{efn|name=The Love of the Last Tycoon}} based on film executive [[Irving Thalberg]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1a2=Frank|1y=1958|1pp=214–215|2a1=Turnbull|2y=1962|2pp=305–307|3a1=Bruccoli|3y=2002|3pp=257, 458}} In 1939, MGM terminated his contract, and Fitzgerald became a freelance screenwriter.{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1pp=294–295|Bruccoli|2002|2p=449}} During his work on ''[[Winter Carnival (film)|Winter Carnival]]'' (1939), Fitzgerald suffered an alcoholic relapse and sought treatment by New York psychiatrist [[Richard H. Hoffmann|Richard Hoffmann]].{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=182, 451}}

Director [[Billy Wilder]] described Fitzgerald's foray into Hollywood as like that of "a great sculptor who is hired to do a plumbing job".{{sfnm|Krystal|2009|McGrath|2004}} Edmund Wilson and [[Aaron Latham]] suggested Hollywood sucked Fitzgerald's creativity like a vampire.{{sfn|Brooks|2011|pp=174–176}} His failure in Hollywood pushed him to return to drinking, and he drank nearly 40 beers a day in 1939.{{sfn|Markel|2017}} Beginning that year, Fitzgerald mocked himself as a Hollywood [[Hack writer|hack]] through the character of Pat Hobby in a sequence of 17 short stories. ''Esquire'' originally published the Pat Hobby Stories between January 1940 and July 1941.{{sfnm|Mizener|1951|1p=285|Bruccoli|2002|2pp=468–469}} Approaching the final year of life, Fitzgerald wrote regretfully to his daughter: "I wish now I'd never relaxed or looked back—but said at the end of ''The Great Gatsby'': I've found my line—from now on this comes first. This is my immediate duty—without this I am nothing."{{sfnm|Kazin|1951|1p=15|Mizener|1951|2p=248}}

=== Final year and death ===

Fitzgerald achieved sobriety over a year before his death, and Graham described their last year together as one of the happiest times of their relationship.{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1a2=Frank|1y=1958|1pp=309–311, 314|2a1=Bruccoli|2y=2002|2pp=446–447}} On the night of December&nbsp;20, 1940, Fitzgerald and Graham attended the premiere of ''[[This Thing Called Love (1940 film)|This Thing Called Love]]''.{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|pp=326–327}} As the couple left the [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]], a sober Fitzgerald experienced a dizzy spell and had difficulty walking to his vehicle.{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|pp=326–327}} Watched by onlookers, he remarked in a strained voice to Graham, "I suppose people will think I'm drunk."{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|pp=326–327}}

On learning of her father's death, Scottie telephoned Graham from Vassar and asked she not attend the funeral for social propriety.<ref>{{harvnb|Graham|Frank|1958|p=333}}: "By the way, Sheilah—we're going to bury Daddy in Baltimore.

Zelda eulogized Fitzgerald in a letter to a friend: "He was as spiritually generous a soul as ever was... It seems as if he was always planning happiness for Scottie and for me. Books to read—places to go. Life seemed so promising always when he was around.&nbsp;... Scott was the best friend a person could have to me".{{sfn|Turnbull|1962|pp=321–322}} At the time of his death, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] denied the family's request that Fitzgerald, a non-practicing Catholic, be buried in the family plot in the Catholic [[Saint Mary's Cemetery (Maryland)|Saint Mary's Cemetery]] in [[Rockville, Maryland]]. Fitzgerald was buried instead with a simple Protestant service at [[Rockville Union Cemetery]].{{sfnm|Turnbull|1962|1pp=321–322|Milford|1970|2p=350}} When Zelda died in a fire at the Highland Mental Hospital in 1948, she was buried next to him at Rockville Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Young|1y=1979|2a1=Mangum|2y=2016|2pp=27–39|3a1=Fitzgerald|3a2=Fitzgerald|3y=2002|3pp=385–386}} In 1975, Scottie successfully petitioned to have the earlier decision revisited, and her parents' remains were moved to the family plot in Saint Mary's.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=2014|2a1=Fitzgerald|2a2=Fitzgerald|2y=2002|2pp=385–386}}

At the time of his death, Fitzgerald believed his life a failure and that his work was forgotten.{{sfnm|Donahue|2013|Mizener|1951|2p=300}} The few critics who were familiar with his work regarded him as a failed alcoholic—the embodiment of Jazz Age decadence.{{sfn|Willett|1999}} His ''New York Times'' obituary hailed him as a brilliant novelist but deemed his work forever tied to an era "when [[Bathtub gin|gin]] was the national drink and sex the national obsession".{{sfn|''New York Times'' Obituary|1940}} As late as 1941, his works were still regarded as period pieces with English literary historian [[Peter Quennell]] dismissing ''The Great Gatsby'' as having "the sadness and the remote jauntiness of a [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] tune".{{sfn|Mizener|1960}}

Fitzgerald died before he could complete his fifth novel. His friend, literary critic Edmund Wilson, completed the manuscript using Fitzgerald's extensive notes for the unwritten part of the novel's story.{{sfnm|Mizener|1951|1p=287|Adams|1941}} When Wilson published his finished version entitled ''The Last Tycoon'' in 1941,{{efn|name=The Love of the Last Tycoon|Scribner's later reissued the book under Fitzgerald's preferred title, ''The Love of The Last Tycoon''.{{sfnm|Bruccoli|2002|1p=463|Ring|1985|2p=102}}}} he included ''The Great Gatsby'' within the edition, sparking new interest and discussion among critics.{{sfn|Mizener|1960}} Amid [[World War&nbsp;II]], ''The Great Gatsby'' gained further popularity when the [[Council on Books in Wartime]] distributed free [[Armed Services Edition]] copies to American soldiers serving overseas. The [[Red Cross]] distributed the novel to prisoners in [[Prisoner of War#Empire of Japan|Japanese and German POW camps]].{{sfn|Gross|Corrigan|2014}} By 1945, over 123,000 copies of ''The Great Gatsby'' had been distributed among U.S. troops.{{sfn|Gross|Corrigan|2014}} By 1960—thirty-five years after the novel's original publication—the book was selling 100,000 copies per year.{{sfn|Tredell|2007|p=90}} This renewed interest led ''The New York Times'' editorialist Arthur Mizener to proclaim the novel a [[masterwork]] of [[American literature]].{{sfn|Mizener|1960}} 

By the 21st century, ''The Great Gatsby'' had sold millions of copies, and the novel is required reading in many high school and college classes.{{sfn|Donahue|2013}} Despite its publication over a century ago, the work continues to be cited by scholars as relevant to understanding contemporary America.{{sfn|Edwards|1992}} According to Professor John Kuehl of [[New York University]]: "If you want to know about Spain, you read Hemingway's ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''. If you want to know about the South, you read [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]. If you want to know what America's like, you read ''The Great Gatsby''. Fitzgerald is the quintessential American writer."{{sfn|Edwards|1992}}

''The Great Gatsby''{{'}}s popularity led to widespread interest in Fitzgerald himself.{{sfnm|Wilson|1965|1pp=16–17|Mizener|1960|Gopnik|2014}} By the 1950s, he had become a [[cult figure]] in American culture and was more widely known than at any period during his lifetime.{{sfnm|Wilson|1965|1pp=16–17|Mizener|1960|Gopnik|2014}} In 1952, critic [[Cyril Connolly]] observed that "apart from his increasing stature as writer, Fitzgerald is now firmly established as a myth, an American version of the [[Death or departure of the gods|Dying God]], an [[Adonis]] of letters" whose rise and fall inevitably prompts comparisons to the Jazz Age itself.{{sfn|Wilson|1965|pp=16–17}}

Seven years later, Fitzgerald's friend Edmund Wilson remarked that he now received copious letters from female admirers of Fitzgerald's works and that his flawed alcoholic friend had posthumously become "a semi-divine personage" in the popular imagination.{{sfn|Wilson|1965|pp=16–17}} Echoing these opinions, writer [[Adam Gopnik]] asserted that—contrary to Fitzgerald's claim that "there are no second acts in American lives"—Fitzgerald became "not a poignant footnote to an ill-named time but an enduring legend of the West".{{sfn|Gopnik|2014}}

Decades after his death, Fitzgerald's childhood Summit Terrace home in St. Paul became a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1971.{{sfn|Gamble|Preston|1968}} Fitzgerald detested the house and deemed it an architectural monstrosity.{{sfn|Palmer|2018}} In 1990, [[Hofstra University]] established the F. Scott Fitzgerald Society, which later became an affiliate of the [[American Literature Association]].{{sfn|Edwards|1992}} During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the society organized an online reading of ''This Side of Paradise'' to mark its centenary.{{sfn|Thorpe|2020}} In 1994, the World Theater in St. Paul—home of the radio broadcast of [[A Prairie Home Companion]]—was renamed the [[Fitzgerald Theater]].{{sfnm|Diamond|2016|Bloom|2009}}

}}
As one of the leading authorial voices of the Jazz Age, Fitzgerald's literary style influenced a number of contemporary and future writers.{{sfn|Stern|1970}} Similar to Edith Wharton and [[Henry James]], Fitzgerald's style often used a series of disconnected scenes to convey plot developments.{{sfn|Mizener|1951|p=170}} His lifelong editor Max Perkins described this particular technique as creating the impression for the reader of a railroad journey in which the vividness of passing scenes blaze with life.{{sfn|Kazin|1951|p=86}} In the style of [[Joseph Conrad]], Fitzgerald often employed a narrator's device to unify these passing scenes and imbue them with deeper meaning.{{sfn|Mizener|1951|p=170}}

Fitzgerald's literary output was not without its critics. Fitzgerald's close friend and literary critic Edmund Wilson believed that Fitzgerald was a gifted writer with a vivid imagination who did not have any intellectual ideas to express.{{sfn|Kazin|1951|pp=77–78}} Wilson argued that Fitzgerald's early works such as ''This Side of Paradise'' suffer from the defects that they are meaningless and lacked intellectual substance.{{sfn|Kazin|1951|pp=77–78}} Likewise, H. L. Mencken concurred that Fitzgerald's literary output lacked any engagement with the issues of his day.{{sfn|Kazin|1951|pp=90–91}} Mencken nevertheless praised Fitzgerald for maturing as a writer with each work—a development which for most authors usually occurred in the opposite direction.{{sfn|Kazin|1951|pp=90–91}} By the time that Fitzgerald published ''The Great Gatsby'', both Wilson and Mencken believed Fitzgerald had become a masterful writer and his literary works more thematically unified.{{sfn|Kazin|1951|pp=81–83, 90–91}}

''Gatsby'' remains Fitzgerald's most influential literary work as an author. The publication of ''The Great Gatsby'' prompted poet T. S. Eliot to opine that the novel was the most significant evolution in American fiction since the works of Henry James.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1945|p=310}} [[Charles R. Jackson|Charles Jackson]], author of ''[[The Lost Weekend (novel)|The Lost Weekend]]'', wrote that ''Gatsby'' was the only flawless novel in the history of American literature.{{sfn|Jackson|1996|p=149}} Later authors Budd Schulberg and [[Edward Newhouse]] were deeply affected by it, and [[John O'Hara]] acknowledged its influence on his work.<ref>{{harvnb|Mizener|1960}}: "Writers like John O'Hara were showing its influence and younger men like Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg, who would presently be deeply affected by it, were discovering it."</ref> [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]], a writer often compared to Fitzgerald, hailed ''The Great Gatsby'' as showcasing Fitzgerald's miraculous talent and triumphal literary technique.{{sfn|Yates|1981|p=3}} An editorial in ''The New York Times'' summarized the considerable influence of Fitzgerald upon contemporary writers and Americans in general during the Jazz Age: "In the literary sense he invented a 'generation'&nbsp;... He might have interpreted them, and even guided them, as in their middle years they saw a different and nobler freedom threatened with destruction."{{sfn|''New York Times'' Editorial|1940}}

=== Adaptations and portrayals ===

Behind her is a large circular mirror with a thick gold trim.|The 1921 silent film ''[[The Off-Shore Pirate]]'' was among the first cinematic adaptations of Fitzgerald's works.]]
Fitzgerald's stories and novels have been adapted into a variety of media formats. His earliest short stories were cinematically adapted as flapper comedies such as ''[[The Husband Hunter]]'' (1920), ''[[The Chorus Girl's Romance]]'' (1920), and ''[[The Off-Shore Pirate]]'' (1921).{{sfnm|Mizener|1951|1p=330|''The New York Times''|1920|2p=D2}} Other Fitzgerald short stories have been adapted into episodes of [[Anthology series|anthology television series]],{{sfn|Hischak|2012|p=23}} as well as the 2008 film ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]''.{{sfn|Scott|2008}} Nearly every novel by Fitzgerald has been adapted for the screen. His second novel ''The Beautiful and Damned'' was filmed in [[The Beautiful and Damned (film)|1922]] and 2010.{{sfn|Tate|1998|p=14}} His third novel ''The Great Gatsby'' has been adapted numerous times for both film and television, most notably in [[The Great Gatsby (1926 film)|1926]], [[The Great Gatsby (1949 film)|1949]], [[The Great Gatsby (Playhouse 90)|1958]], [[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|1974]], [[The Great Gatsby (2000 film)|2000]], and [[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|2013]].{{sfnm|Hall|1926|Coppola|2013|Cieply|2013}} His fourth novel ''Tender Is the Night'' was made into a 1955 CBS television episode, an [[Tender Is the Night (film)|eponymous 1962 film]], and a BBC television miniseries in 1985.{{sfn|Hischak|2012|p=240}} ''The Last Tycoon'' has been adapted into a [[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|1976 film]],{{sfn|Canby|1976}} and  a 2016 [[Amazon Prime]] TV [[miniseries]].{{sfn|Ryan|2017}}

Beyond adaptations of his works, Fitzgerald himself has been portrayed in dozens of books, plays, and films. He inspired Budd Schulberg's novel ''[[The Disenchanted]]'' (1950),{{sfn|Gopnik|2014}} later adapted into a Broadway play starring [[Jason Robards]].{{sfn|Atkinson|1958}} Other theatrical productions of Fitzgerald's life include [[Frank Wildhorn]]'s 2005 musical ''[[Waiting For The Moon (musical)|Waiting for the Moon]]'',{{sfn|Nash|2005}} and a musical produced by the Japanese [[Takarazuka Revue]].{{sfn|Buckton|2013}} Fitzgerald's relationships with Sheilah Graham and [[Frances Kroll Ring]] respectively served as the basis for the films ''[[Beloved Infidel]]'' (1959) and ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002).{{sfn|Graham|Frank|1958|pp=vii–ix, 172–173}}{{sfnm|Genzlinger|2002|Ring|1985}} Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda have appeared as characters in the films ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'' (2011) and ''[[Genius (2016 film)|Genius]]'' (2016).{{sfnm|Berger|2011|Scott|2016}} Other depictions of Fitzgerald include the TV movies ''[[Zelda (film)|Zelda]]'' (1993), ''[[F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood]]'' (1976), ''[[F. Scott Fitzgerald and 'The Last of the Belles'|The Last of the Belles]]'' (1974), and the TV series ''[[Z: The Beginning of Everything]]'' (2015).{{sfn|Wollaston|2017}}

=== Lost manuscripts ===
In 2004, the [[University of South Carolina]] purchased a newly discovered cache of 2,000 pages of screenplay work that Fitzgerald wrote for MGM while in Hollywood.{{sfn|McGrath|2004}} The cache demonstrates that Fitzgerald put considerable effort into his attempts at screenwriting during his final years.{{sfn|McGrath|2004}} He 
approached each screenplay assignment by MGM as if it were a novel, and he wrote extensive back-stories for every character before typing a single word of dialogue.{{sfn|McGrath|2004}} Despite these herculean efforts, the studio nonetheless found his work unsatisfactory and chose not to renew his contract.{{sfn|McGrath|2004}}

In 2015, ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' published an 8,000-word lost manuscript by Fitzgerald entitled "Temperature", dated July 1939.{{sfnm|Begley|2015|Miller|2015}} Long thought lost, the manuscript was found by a researcher in Princeton's archives.{{sfnm|Begley|2015|Miller|2015}} The story recounts the illness and decline of an alcoholic writer among Hollywood idols in Los Angeles while suffering lingering fevers and indulging in light-hearted romance with a Hollywood actress.{{sfnm|Begley|2015|Miller|2015}} Two years later, Scribner's published a rediscovered cache of Fitzgerald's short stories in a collection titled ''I'd Die For You''.{{sfn|McAlpin|2017}}
