They released their debut EP ''[[Obscene Humanity]]'' in 2009, followed by the studio albums ''[[Unsilent Death]]'' (2010), ''[[Abandon All Life]]'' (2013) and ''[[You Will Never Be One of Us]]'' (2016), and a split EP with [[Full of Hell (band)|Full of Hell]]. Gradually, Nails have achieved widespread critical acclaim for their savage, [[death metal]]-infused sound.

== History ==
The band formed in 2009. They have since released three full-length albums and two EPs. As of June 2014, the band is signed to [[Nuclear Blast]]. They released their third album, ''[[You Will Never Be One of Us]]'', on June 17, 2016.

On July 25, 2016, the band abruptly canceled a European tour, with promoters claiming the band were on a hiatus and "had no plans to play live or record again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/rumors/nails-cancel-tour-dates-reportedly-go-on-hiatus|title=NAILS Cancel Tour Dates, Reportedly Go On Hiatus|publisher=Metal Injection|first=Robert|last=Pasbani|date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref> This also led to canceling their appearance at [[Knotfest#"Ozzfest Meets Knotfest" California|Ozzfest Meets Knotfest]]. Todd Jones later stated that the band had never taken a hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/news/2016-10-18/nails-we-never-went-on-hiatus|title=Nails: We never went on hiatus|publisher=Team Rock|first=Stef|last=Lach|date=October 18, 2016|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref> In December 2016, the band returned by playing at The Power of the Riff festival and releasing a split 7" with [[Full of Hell (band)|Full of Hell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/tour-dates/nails-to-play-the-power-of-the-riff-festival-in-december|title=NAILS To Play THE POWER OF THE RIFF Festival In December|publisher=Metal Injection|first=Greg|last=Kennelty|date=October 17, 2016|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fullofhell.com/post/151710214780/nails-full-of-hell-split-7-coming-december-2nd|title=NAILS / FULL OF HELL SPLIT 7" COMING DECEMBER 2ND|publisher=Full of Hell|date=October 12, 2016|accessdate=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101102517/http://fullofhell.com/post/151710214780/nails-full-of-hell-split-7-coming-december-2nd|archive-date=November 1, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Decibel" />

On November 30, 2020, following the announcement of the 10th anniversary reissue of ''Unsilent Death'', Young announced that he quit the band in early Spring. The day later, John Gianelli also confirmed his departure from the band. From this point, Todd Jones is the only member of the band.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kennelty |first1=Greg |title=NAILS Bassist John Gianelli Also Quits the Band |url=https://metalinjection.net/news/breakups/nails-bassist-john-gianelli-also-quits-the-band |website=Metal Injection |access-date=December 2, 2020 |date=December 1, 2020}}</ref>

In a review of ''[[Abandon All Life]]'', ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that "Nails cram their brief but constantly shifting tracks with a chaotic, complex blend of [[hardcore punk]], [[D-beat]], [[grindcore]], [[powerviolence]], and [[death metal]]."<ref name="PitchforkAAL">{{cite web|last1=Stosuy|first1=Brandon|title=Nails – ''Abandon All Life''|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17784-nails-abandon-all-life/|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}</ref> In a 2013 interview for [[Invisible Oranges]], Todd Jones named [[crust punk]], death metal, and [[Japanese hardcore]] as the band's foremost musical influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.invisibleoranges.com/interview-todd-jones-of-nails/|title=Interview: Todd Jones of Nails|publisher=[[Invisible Oranges]]|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}</ref> Rushonrock cited Nails, alongside [[Trap Them]], as key players of the contemporary American crust scene.<ref name="rush">{{cite web|title=Totem Skin – ''Weltschmerz''|url=http://rushonrock.com/2016/04/28/review-totem-skin/|last=Holmes|first=Richard|publisher=Rushonrock|date=April 28, 2016|accessdate=November 2, 2017|quote=}}</ref>
