'''Thomas Andrew Lehrer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛər|ər}}; born April 9, 1928) is a retired American musician, singer-songwriter, [[satirist]], and mathematician, having lectured on mathematics and musical theater. He is best known for the pithy and humorous songs that he recorded in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though he usually created original melodies when doing so. A notable exception is "[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]", in which he set the names of the [[chemical element]]s to the tune of the "[[Major-General's Song]]" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Pirates of Penzance]]''.

Lehrer's early musical work typically dealt with non-topical subject matter and was noted for its [[black humor]] in songs such as "[[Poisoning Pigeons in the Park]]". In the 1960s, he produced a number of songs that dealt with social and political issues of the day, particularly when he wrote for the U.S. version of the television show ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]''. The popularity of these songs has far outlasted their topical subjects and references. Lehrer quoted a friend's explanation: "Always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet."<ref>{{cite episode|last=Ford|first=Andrew|title=Tom Lehrer|series=The Music Show|transcript=Interview transcript|transcript-url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/musicshow/tom-lehrer/3344656#transcript|date=July 8, 2006|station=[[Radio National]]|network=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> In the early 1970s, Lehrer largely retired from public performances to devote his time to teaching mathematics and musical theater history at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].

Lehrer remained in Harvard's doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at the [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]].<ref name=sf>{{cite web |url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/that-was-the-wit-that-was/Content?oid=2138455 |title=That Was the Wit That Was |first=Jack |last=Boulware |work=[[SF Weekly]] |date=April 19, 2000 |access-date=November 27, 2018 }}</ref>

Lehrer was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957, working at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). (Lehrer has stated that he invented the [[Jello shot]] during this time, as a means of circumventing the base's ban on alcoholic beverages.)<ref name=sf/> 
Despite holding a master's degree in an era when American conscripts often lacked a high school diploma, Lehrer served as an [[enlisted soldier]], achieving the rank of [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist Third Class]], which he described as being a "[[Corporal#United States Army|corporal]] [[Minister without portfolio|without portfolio]]".<ref>Monologue self-introduction on ''[[Tom Lehrer Revisited]]''.</ref> These experiences became fodder for songs, such as "The Wild West is Where I Want to Be" and "It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1U2fpzw4qNI | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/1U2fpzw4qNI| archive-date=2021-11-18 | url-status=live|title=The Wild West is Where I Want to Be: spoken introduction |first=Tom |last=Lehrer |work=[[The Remains of Tom Lehrer]] |date=May 23, 2000 |access-date=August 15, 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> It was many years before Lehrer publicly revealed that he had been assigned to the NSA, since the mere fact of its existence was classified at the time; this left him in the interesting position of implicitly using nuclear weapons work as a cover story for something more sensitive.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Jeremy|title=Quantum Profiles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2020|isbn=9780190056865}}</ref>

In 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time math studies at Harvard.<ref name=toobin/>

From 1962, Lehrer taught in the [[political science]] department at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200709/ |title=Tom Lehrer |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709231900/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200709/ |archive-date=July 9, 2012 |last=Longley |first=Eric |encyclopedia=[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]] |publisher=CBS Interactive Resource Library |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1965 he gave up on his mathematics dissertation on [[Mode (statistics)|modes]] in statistics, after having worked on it intermittently for 15 years.<ref name=bensmith/>

In 1972, Lehrer joined the faculty of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], teaching an introductory course entitled ''The Nature of Mathematics'' to liberal arts majors—"math for tenors", according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in [[musical theater]]. He occasionally performed songs in his lectures.<ref name=kapslecture>Lehrer performance excerpt, {{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/lehrer |title=Irving "Kaps" Kaplansky's 80th Birthday Celebration|date=1997 |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>

===Mathematical publications===
The [[American Mathematical Society]] database lists him as co-author of two papers:

==Musical career==
===Style and influences===
Lehrer was mainly influenced by [[musical theater]]. According to [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]]'s book ''Seriously Funny'',<ref>{{cite book |last1= Nachman |first1=Gerald |author-link1= Gerald Nachman (journalist) |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s|url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access= registration |location=New York, NY |publisher=Pantheon Books |publication-date=2003 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659] |isbn=  9780375410307 <!-- 0375410309 --> |oclc=50339527  |year= 2004}}</ref> the Broadway musical ''[[Let's Face It!]]''  made an early and lasting impression on him. Lehrer's style consists of [[Parody music|parodying]] various forms of [[popular song]]. For example, his appreciation of [[list song]]s led him to write "[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]", which lists the [[chemical element]]s to the tune of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s "[[Major-General's Song]]".

In author and [[Boston University]] professor [[Isaac Asimov]]'s second autobiographical volume, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recounted seeing Lehrer perform in a [[Boston]] nightclub on October 9, 1954. Lehrer sang a song about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, "...and after a while you gathered the 'it' was [[venereal disease]] The song was likely "[[Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer|I Got It From Agnes]]". Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every known [[sexual perversion|perversion]] without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable outside a nightclub." Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the [[Boston subway]] system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. "I haven't gone to nightclubs often," said Asimov, "but of all the times I have gone, it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time."<ref>Asimov, Isaac, ''In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978''. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1980, p. 15.</ref>

===Recordings===
Lehrer was encouraged by the success of his performances, so he paid $15 ({{Inflation|US|15|1953|fmt=eq}}) for some studio time in 1953 to record ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]''. The initial pressing was 400 copies. Radio stations would not air his songs because of his controversial subjects, so he sold the album on campus at Harvard for $3,  {{Inflation|US|3|1953|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}, while "several stores near the Harvard campus sold it for $3.50, taking only a minimal markup as a kind of community service. Newsstands on campus sold it for the same price."<ref name=barryhansen>

Like herpes, rather than ebola."<ref>Maslon, Laurence, ''Make Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America'', Hachette Book Group, 2008, pg. 81</ref>

The album included the macabre "I Hold Your Hand in Mine", the mildly risqué "Be Prepared", and "[[Lobachevsky (song)|Lobachevsky]]" regarding plagiarizing mathematicians. It became a [[Cult following|cult success]] by word of mouth, despite being self-published and without promotion. Lehrer embarked on a series of concert tours and recorded a second album in 1959. He released the second album in two versions: the songs were the same, but ''[[More of Tom Lehrer]]'' was a studio recording and ''[[An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer]]'' was recorded live in concert.  In 2013, Lehrer recalled the studio session for "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park", which referred to the practice of controlling pigeons in Boston with [[strychnine]]-treated corn:<ref name="faulkner">{{Cite journal |last=Faulkner |first=Clarence |date=May 1, 1999 |title=As It Was in Region 5, 1949–1964 |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=icwdmprobe |journal=The Probe |volume=200 |pages=7 |via=DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln, "City-wide pigeon control in Boston, MA using strychnine-treated whole corn"}}</ref>

===Touring===
Lehrer had a breakthrough in the United Kingdom on December 4, 1957, when the [[University of London]] awarded a [[doctor of music]] degree ''[[honoris causa]]'' to [[Princess Margaret]], and the public orator, Professor J. R. Sutherland, said it was "in the full knowledge that the Princess is a connoisseur of music and a performer of skill and distinction, her taste being catholic, ranging from Mozart to the [[Calypso music|calypso]] and from opera to the songs of Miss [[Beatrice Lillie]] and Tom Lehrer."<ref>{{cite book |title=East Africa and Rhodesia |year=1957 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h64qAAAAMAAJ |page=493 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/51200645/|title=The Kansas City Times from Kansas City, Missouri · Page 4|date=December 5, 1957|work=The Kansas City Times|agency=[[Associated Press]]|location=Kansas City, Missouri|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7KVCLZuC58| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/V7KVCLZuC58| archive-date=2021-11-18 | url-status=live|title=British Pathé, quoted only "from Mozart to calypso"}}{{cbignore}}</ref> This prompted significant interest in Lehrer's works and helped to secure distribution for his five-year-old debut album in Britain.

Lehrer made a short tour in Norway and Denmark in 1967, performing some of the songs from the television program.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} His performance in Oslo on September 10 was recorded on video tape and aired locally that autumn, then released on DVD some 40 years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://premiereoperaintl.com/dvd16802tomlehrerlivefromoslo.aspx|title = Premiere Opera}}</ref> He performed as a prominent international guest at the ''Studenterforeningen'' (student association) in Copenhagen, which was televised, and he commented on stage that he might be America's "revenge for [[Victor Borge]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/6funswede |title=The Tom Lehrer Wisdom Channel |publisher=YouTube |date=September 11, 1967 |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref> He performed original songs in a Dodge automobile industrial film distributed primarily to automobile dealers and shown at promotional events in 1967, set in a fictional American wild west town and titled ''The Dodge Rebellion Theatre presents Ballads For '67''.<ref name=barryhansen/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dodge industrial Film|url=http://home.broadpark.no/~emeyn/tl/dodge.html|website=The Tom Lehrer Wisdom Channel|access-date=March 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420112540/http://home.broadpark.no/~emeyn/tl/dodge.html|archive-date=April 20, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> He attempted to adapt [[Sweeney Todd]] as a Broadway musical, working with [[Joe Raposo]], to star [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]].

===Departure from the music scene===
In the 1970s, Lehrer concentrated on teaching mathematics and musical theater, although he also wrote ten songs for the educational children's television show ''[[The Electric Company]]''. His last public performance for many years took place in 1972, on a fundraising tour for Democratic US presidential candidate [[George McGovern]].<ref name=bensmith/>

There is a false rumor that Lehrer gave up [[political satire]] when the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1973.  He did comment that awarding the prize to Kissinger made political satire obsolete,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2008/10/29/645761/-Tom-Lehrer-supports-Obama-Who-Tom-Lehrer-Who-Tom-Lehrer |title=Tom Lehrer supports Obama !

Lehrer denied this in a 2003 interview.<ref name="smh">{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/stop-clapping-this-is-serious-20030301-gdgcoz.html |title=Stop clapping, this is serious |newspaper=smh.com.au |date=March 1, 2003 |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>

When asked about his reasons for abandoning his musical career in an interview in the book accompanying his CD box set, released in 2000, Lehrer cited a simple lack of interest, a disdain of touring, and the monotony of performing the same songs repeatedly.  He observed that when he was moved to write and perform songs, he did, and when he was not, he did not, and that after a while he simply lost interest. Even though Lehrer was "a hero of the anti-nuclear, civil rights left" and covered its political issues in many of his songs, and even though he shared the [[New Left]]'s opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], and advocated for civil rights, he disliked the aesthetics of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and stopped performing as the movement gained momentum.<ref name=bensmith/>

Lehrer's musical career was relatively brief.  He once mentioned that he performed a mere 109 shows and wrote 37 songs over 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andrews |first=Dale |url=https://www.sleuthsayers.org/search/label/Tom%20Lehrer |title=Tom Lehrer |publisher=SleuthSayers |date=April 9, 2013 |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>  Nevertheless, he developed a significant following in the United States and abroad.

===Revivals and discographic reissues===
In 1980, [[Cameron Mackintosh]] produced ''[[Tomfoolery]]'', a revue of Lehrer's songs that was a hit on the London stage. Lehrer was not initially involved with the show, but he was pleased with it; he eventually gave the stage production his full support and updated several of his lyrics for the show. ''Tomfoolery'' contained 27 songs and led to more than 200 productions,<ref name="Jim Bessman 1997"/> including an Off-Broadway production at the [[Village Gate]] which ran for 120 performances in 1981.<ref>{{iobdb title|2186|Tomfoolery}}</ref> Lehrer made a rare TV appearance on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' show in conjunction with the ''Tom Foolery'' premiere in 1980 at the [[Criterion Theatre]] in London, where he sang "I Got It from Agnes".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/43413/tom-lehrer-collection-cd-dvd-the/ |title=The Tom Lehrer Collection (CD + DVD) : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|EDeRYmB4t6Q|Tom Lehrer: I Got It From Agnes}}—from "Parkinson" 1980</ref> There were "Tomfoolery" performances in San Francisco about 1982 and in 2018-19. In 1993, he wrote "That's Mathematics" for the closing credits to a [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] video<ref>{{cite web|title=Fermat's Last Theorem - The Theorem and Its Proof: An Exploration of Issues and Ideas|url=http://videodl.msri.org/data/000/022/041/original/fermat-fermat-QuickTime.mov|website=MSRI|publisher=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|location=Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco|date=July 28, 1993}}</ref> celebrating the proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].

On June 7 and 8, 1998, Lehrer performed in public for the first time in 25 years at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]] as part of the show ''[[Hey, Mr. Producer!]]'' celebrating the career of Cameron Mackintosh, who had produced ''Tom Foolery''. The June 8 show was his only performance before [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Lehrer sang "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" and an updated version of the nuclear proliferation song "Who's Next?"<ref>{{YouTube|yhuMLpdnOjY|Poisoning Pigeons in the Park}} (original version). Retrieved March 25, 2008.</ref>

In 2000 Lehrer commented that he doubted his songs had any real effect on those not already critical of the establishment: "I don't think this kind of thing has an impact on the unconverted, frankly. It's not even preaching to the converted; it's titillating the converted&nbsp;... I'm fond of quoting [[Peter Cook]], who talked about the satirical Berlin [[kabarett]]s of the 1930s, which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the Second World War."<ref name="avclub" />

Lehrer has said, jokingly, of his musical career, "If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worth the while."<ref name="Songs 1997" />
In 2003, Lehrer commented that his particular brand of political satire is more difficult in the modern world: "The real issues I don't think most people touch. The Clinton jokes are all about Monica Lewinsky and all that stuff and not about the important things, like the fact that he wouldn't ban land mines&nbsp;... I'm not tempted to write a song about George W. Bush. I couldn't figure out what sort of song I would write. That's the problem: I don't want to satirize George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporize them."<ref name="smh" />

In 2000, the boxed CD set ''The Remains of Tom Lehrer'' was released by [[Rhino Entertainment]]. It included live and studio versions of his first two albums, ''That Was The Year That Was'', the songs that he wrote for ''The Electric Company'', and some previously unreleased material, a small hardbound lyrics book with an introduction by [[Dr. Demento]]. In 2010, [[Shout! Factory]] launched a reissue campaign, making Lehrer's out-of-print albums available digitally. The CD/DVD combo ''The Tom Lehrer Collection'' was also issued, including his best-known songs, with a DVD featuring an Oslo concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126189232 |title=Tom Lehrer: '60s Satirist Still Strikes A Chord |publisher=NPR |date=April 30, 2010 |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>

In a February 2008 phone call, [[Gene Weingarten]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' interviewed Lehrer [[Off the record (journalism)|off the record]]. When Weingarten asked if there was anything he could print for the record, Lehrer responded, "Just tell the people that I am voting for [[Barack Obama|Obama]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/02/05/DI2008020502027.html |title=Chatological Humor: A Tribute to Tom Lehrer |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 12, 2008 |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>

In 2012 rapper [[2 Chainz]] sampled Lehrer's song "Dope Peddler", on his 2012 debut album, ''[[Based on a T.R.U. Story]].'' In 2013, Lehrer said he was "very proud" to have his song sampled "literally sixty years after I recorded it".  Lehrer went on to describe his official response to the request to use his song: "As sole copyright owner of 'The Old Dope Peddler', I grant you [[motherfucker]]s permission to do this. Please give my regards to Mr. Chainz, or may I call him 2?"<ref name=bbc /><ref>{{cite magazine | last=Prospero | date=October 17, 2017 | title=Who can fill the role of Tom Lehrer today? | magazine=[[The Economist]] | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/10/wit| access-date=January 1, 2018}}</ref>

In 2020, at the age of 92, Lehrer donated all of his lyrics and music written by him to the [[public domain]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sanderson |first=David |date=October 22, 2020 |title=Copyright-busting website is invitation to have a laugh with Tom Lehrer |language=en |work=The Times |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/copyright-busting-website-is-invitation-to-have-a-laugh-with-tom-lehrer-k99b6b9gh |access-date=October 22, 2020 |issn=0140-0460}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Satirist Tom Lehrer has put his songs into the public domain |first= Justin|last= Ho|work=Marketplace | date=21 October 2020 | url=https://www.marketplace.org/2020/10/21/satirist-tom-lehrer-put-his-songs-into-public-domain/ | access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref>

==Musical legacy==
In 1967, Swedish actor [[Lars Ekborg]], known outside Sweden for his part in Ingmar Bergman's ''[[Summer with Monika]]'', made an album called ''I Tom Lehrers vackra värld'' ("In the beautiful world of Tom Lehrer"), with 12 of Lehrer's songs interpreted in Swedish. Lehrer wrote in a letter to the producer Per-Anders Boquist that, "Not knowing any Swedish, I am obviously not equipped to judge, but it sounds to me as though Mr. Ekborg is perfect for the songs," along with further compliments to pianist Leif Asp for unexpected additional flourishes.<ref>Liner notes (translation): {{cite book|last1=Holmgren|first1=Pontus|title=Lars Ekborg i Tom Lehrer's Vackra Värld|date=2002|publisher=Amigo|location=Sweden|url=http://www.tomlehrer.org/covers/ekborgnotes1.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621060642/http://www.tomlehrer.org/covers/ekborgnotes1.html|archive-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref>

Composer [[Randy Newman]] said of Lehrer, "He's one of the great American songwriters without a doubt, right up there with everybody, the top guys. As a lyricist, as good as there's been in the last half of the 20th century."<ref name=bbc /> Singer and comedian [[Dillie Keane]] has acknowledged Lehrer's influence on her work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/otherresources/interviews/DillieKeane.htm|title=The British Theatre Guide: Interview with Dillie Keane|access-date=December 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008023413/http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/otherresources/interviews/DillieKeane.htm|archive-date=October 8, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Dr. Demento]] praised Lehrer as "the best musical satirist of the twentieth century." Other artists who cite Lehrer as an influence include [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], whose work generally addresses more [[pop culture|popular]] and less technical or political subjects,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/faq.htm |title=Weird Al's FAQs |author="Weird Al" Yankovic |author-link="Weird Al" Yankovic|publisher=Weirdal.com |access-date=June 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518102319/http://weirdal.com/faq.htm |archive-date=May 18, 2008 }}</ref> and educator and scientist [[H.

From January 16 to February 25, 2006 the play ''[[Letters from Lehrer]]'', written and performed by Canadian [[Richard Greenblatt (playwright)|Richard Greenblatt]], ran at [[Canadian Stage Company|CanStage]] in Toronto. It followed Lehrer's musical career, the meaning of several songs, the politics of the time, and Greenblatt's own experiences with Lehrer's music, while playing some of Lehrer's songs.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ouzounian|first=Richard|date=2006-01-29|title=Letters From Lehrer|url=https://variety.com/2006/legit/reviews/letters-from-lehrer-1200518948/|access-date=2021-11-11|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref>

Performers influenced by Lehrer's style include American political satirist [[Mark Russell]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holecity.com/asp/newshole.asp?issue=10&sec=7&hole=1 |title=NewsHole |publisher=Holecity.com |date=March 5, 2000 |access-date=June 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212746/http://holecity.com/asp/newshole.asp?issue=10&sec=7&hole=1 |archive-date=October 13, 2007  }}</ref> Canadian comedian and songwriter [[Randy Vancourt]], and the British duo [[Kit and The Widow]].

In 2004, British medical satirists [[Amateur Transplants]] acknowledge the debt they owe to Lehrer on the back of their first album, ''[[Fitness to Practice]]''. Their song "The Menstrual Rag" uses the tune of Lehrer's "The Vatican Rag", and "The Drugs Song" mirrors Lehrer's song "The Elements", both using the tune of the "Major-General's Song" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. The Amateur Transplants' second album, ''[[Unfit to Practise]]'', opens with an update of Lehrer's "The Masochism Tango" called "Masochism Tango 2008".{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}
