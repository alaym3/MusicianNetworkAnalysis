==History==
=== Formation and early years (1985—1989) ===
L7 were formed by [[Donita Sparks]] and [[Suzi Gardner]] in 1985.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Both artists were active in the [[Art punk]] community of [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] and had met in 1984 through mutual contacts at the cultural hub of the ''[[LA Weekly]]''. Of their meeting and on hearing Gardner play a tape of her songs in progress, Sparks described it as "one of the happiest days of my life" with a clear synchronicity in the music they were each interested in creating.<ref name=":3" /> At the time, Gardner was also active as a poet.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/l7-to-hell-and-back-120783/|title=L7: To Hell and Back|last=Grant|first=Sarah|date=November 21, 2017|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=October 6, 2019}}</ref> A year prior, Gardner had performed backing vocals on the college radio hit "[[Slip It In]]" by [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Rock and Roll Woman: The 50 Fiercest Female Rockers|last=Ochs|first=Meredith|publisher=Sterling Publishing Co.|year=2018|isbn=9781454930624|location=New York|pages=134–137}}</ref> Gardner and Sparks began performing regularly in Los Angeles at punk and metal venues along with a revolving list of supporting musician in the early years.

The punk rock duo brought [[Jennifer Finch]] on board as bass guitarist and Roy Koutsky on drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://l7theband.tumblr.com/post/130755440360/suzisafari-l7-kerrang-magazine-if-you-can-zoom|title=Kerrang Magazine|website=17theband.tumblr.com|date=October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://l7theband.tumblr.com/post/138159846332/l7theband-l7-with-their-original-drummer-anne|title=L7's Brief Drummer|date=1990|website=17theband.tumblr.com|access-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> Finch, with the strongest Californian roots of the trio, connected the band with an even wider network, including [[Brett Gurewitz]] of Epitaph Records where the band recorded their first demo.<ref name=":16">{{Cite journal|last=Halbersberg|first=Elianne|date=1990|title=L7 Ain't No Bad Place to Be|url=https://l7theband.tumblr.com/image/130755440360|journal=Kerrang!}}</ref> Their [[L7 (album)|eponymous debut album]], described as "intense, energetic" and "fast straightforward punk music" was released by Epitaph Records in 1987.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/67426/L7-L7/|title=Review L7: L7|last=Schroer|first=Brendan|date=June 16, 2015|work=Sputnik Music|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> L7 reported challenges in the early years with finding a suitable, stable drummer.

==== Rock for Choice ====
In 1991, the band formed [[Rock for Choice]], a [[pro-choice]] women's rights group and concert series that raised funds to cover legal expenses due to the prolonged [[Anti-abortion violence]] and women's clinic bombings of the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://floodmagazine.com/60756/l7s-donita-sparks-on-old-punks-new-music-and-continuing-harassment/|title=L7's Donita Sparks on Old Punks, New Music, and Continuing Harassment|last=Amorosi|first=A.

Later Rock for Choice concerts included the Foo Fighters, Ween, [[Pearl Jam]],  and other prominent bands of the era.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> L7 returned their focus to their music, reducing their involvement with Rock for Choice, which continued on independently through 2001.

L7's sixth studio album, ''[[Slap-Happy]]'', was released on the band's own label Wax Tadpole Records in 1999.<ref name=":0" /> To promote the record, on July 17, 1999, L7 had a plane fly over the crowd at the [[Lilith Fair]] at the Rose Bowl in [[Pasadena, California]], with a banner that read, "Bored? Tired? Try L7." The following day, an airplane towed a banner over the crowd at the [[Warped Tour]] at the Stone Pony lot in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]].

However, the band's live performances consistently garnered praise, including a September 1999 review by rock critic [[Greg Kot]] in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that stated "Gardner and Sparks favor low-end guitar chug, a sound that suggests the idling engine of a Harley-Davidson more than the high-end squeal of most lead guitarists. They intersect with bassist Janis Tanaka to create a thick, sludgy bottom that rumbles the floorboards and shoots right through the sternums of innocent passersby. Their secret weapon remains drummer Dee Plakas."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/169247870/?terms=Donita%2BSparks|title=L7 Raises the Heat|last=Kot|first=Greg|date=September 6, 1999|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=October 7, 2019|page=44}}</ref>

By 2001, L7 were no longer touring. The band listed the following statement on their website, ''"L7 are on an indefinite hiatus. We know that's vague, but that's just the way it is. The future of the band is a bit up in the air at the moment."''  L7 appeared to be defunct for all practical purposes. From 2007 - 2012, Sparks pursued another project, along with Plakas on drums, in their band [[Donita Sparks and the Stellar Moments|Donita Sparks and The Stellar Moments]].

Throughout the mid-2000s, the band's song "[[Bricks Are Heavy|Shitlist]]" was used as the entrance music of professional wrestler [[Jon Moxley]], who would later become widely known under the name Dean Ambrose upon joining [[WWE]] in 2011. The song was also used in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] by [[Brian Pillman]] (under his loose cannon gimmick) in 1996, until his departure the following year.

==Controversy==
During their performance at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals line-ups#1992|1992 Reading Festival]], the band experienced "technical difficulties with their audio equipment" and were forced to stall their set. The rowdy crowd grew restless and began throwing mud onto the stage, repeatedly pelting the band. In protest, lead vocalist Donita Sparks removed her [[tampon]] on-stage and threw it into the crowd yelling "Eat my used tampon, fuckers!" Sparks has remained unapologetic about the incident,<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-44p7V2TrUC&q=L7+tampon&pg=PA369 |author=Mark Yarm |title=Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge |date=March 2012 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |page=369|isbn=9780307464446 }}</ref> and the tampon has been referred to as one of the "most unsanitary pieces of rock memorabilia in history."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2009/11/10/l7-throws-tampon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716120819/http://www.spinner.com/2009/11/10/l7-throws-tampon|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 16, 2011|title=L7 Throws Tampon |date=August 28, 1992 |access-date=August 19, 2011}}</ref>

Later in 1992, Sparks caused controversy in the United Kingdom when she dropped her jeans and underwear on live television, appearing nude from the waist down, during an L7 performance on the late night UK programme ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brewer |first=Mary F. |title=Exclusions in Feminist Thought: Challenging the Boundaries of Womanhood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PWEpoc-W-0C&q=Donita+Sparks+The+Word+1992&pg=PA127 |date=January 1, 2002 |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |isbn=978-1-902210-63-6 |pages=127 |access-date=May 30, 2015}}</ref> Of the incident, Sparks later commented that the Word show L7 appeared on had a number of chaotic aspects already underway including "a men’s bum contest" and a "hidden camera in [[Oliver Reed]]’s dressing room, showing him intoxicated with his shirt off, which was really fucked up. So I added my contribution to this craziness."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/turning-points-l7s-donita-sparks/|title=Turning Points: L7's Donita Sparks|last=Tehabsim|first=Anna|date=March 18, 2015|work=Crack Magazine|access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref>

In 2000, the band raffled a one-night stand with Demetra Plakas at a London gig.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/photos/25-jaw-dropping-rock-facts-1427940|title=25 jaw-dropping rock facts|date=October 8, 2009|work=NME|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/apr/13/artsfeatures3|title=Bad grrls live forever|last=Simpson|first=Dave|date=April 12, 2000|work=The Guardian|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> The winner got to spend the night on the tour bus. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reported that Plakas and her bandmates decided “We’re not being hypocritical about rock & roll anymore. Rock & roll is prostitution.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-year-in-weird-120391/|title=The Year in Weird: Santana's shoes, Ziggy's hemp bars and more weirdness from 2000|last=Sprague|first=David|date=December 29, 2000|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==
L7's sound has been described as "unique and unforgiving, mixing a punk rock attitude with heavy sludge metal."<ref name=":13" /> A 2019 article on L7 in ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' stated that "In the early-’90s underground, L7 were positively bulletproof and larger than life. Not as come-hither nymphs or saucy rock star minxes bestowed with privilege but as a hard-rocking unit" that could not be messed with.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/l7-scatter-the-rats-interview/|title=L7 Still Kick Ass and Have Good Table Manners 20 Years Later|last=Pettigrew|first=Jason|date=June 12, 2019|work=Alternative Press|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref>

Aesthetically, their style was subversive with a long-standing resistance to the expectation to be eye-candy. L7 called themselves "slob girls" with ratty hair and clothes and bassist Jennifer Finch frequently performed barefoot onstage.<ref name=":0" /> Sparks summarized “If we were gonna be looked at, we were gonna be thrashin."<ref name=":14" /> 

A reviewer in 1995 stated that "L7 plays slow-riffing hard rock, fast punk rock and bluesy, catchy midtempo songs: generic forms upgraded by smart lyrics and pure irreverence on stage."<ref name=":15" />

Influences on the group include the Ramones and [[Frightwig]].<ref name=":0" />

[[The Prodigy]] covered the ''[[Hungry for Stink]]'' track "Fuel My Fire" on their 1997 album ''[[The Fat of the Land]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fzvr/|title=The Prodigy: Fat Of The Land Review|last=Pattison|first=Louis|date=2008|work=BBC|access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/04/prodigy-fat-of-the-land-review/|title=Review: Prodigy – Fat of the Land|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|date=2017|work=Spin|access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> In 2015, ''Spin'' listed ''Bricks Are Heavy'' as number 249 on their list of the top 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985 - 2014).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2015/05/the-300-best-albums-of-the-past-30-years-1985-2014/|title=The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985-2014)|date=May 11, 2015|work=Spin|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]'' ranked the songs from L7's ''Bricks Are Heavy'' as part of their Hall of Fame Countdown in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2016/06/09/hall-of-fame-countdown-l7-s-bricks-are-heavy/|title=Hall of Fame Countdown: L7's Bricks Are Heavy|last=Solis|first=Matt|date=June 9, 2016|work=Decibel|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref> In 2017, ''Metal Injection'' ranked L7 at number 7 on their list of "10 Heaviest Grunge Bands".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/lists/10-heaviest-grunge-bands|title=10 Heaviest Grunge Bands|work=Metal Injection|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref>

The band was listed by ''Kerrang!'' in 2019 as one of "Ten Bands No One Expected to be So Influential Today."<ref name=":17">{{Cite news|url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/10-bands-no-one-expected-to-be-so-influential-today/|title=10 Bands No One Expected to be So Influential Today|last=Krovatin and Alex Brown|first=Chris|date=June 2, 2019|work=Kerrang!|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref> The group was described as "one of rock’s most volatile and respected acts.
