'''Frank Reyes''' born June 4, 1969, he is one of the best known [[bachata (music)|bachata]] artists, famous throughout Latin America. He was born in the town of [[Tenares]] in the Dominican Republic. Reyes discovered his musical talent when he was a young boy. He and his brothers started their own musical group and had great singing talent. When he was only 12 years old, he decided to travel to [[Santo Domingo]] where he worked hard and had many jobs, always dreaming of having his own business. Because he had a beautiful voice he became very successful over the years.

As he got older he recorded his first album ''Tu serás mi reina'' and became the self-appointed "prince of bachata" (''El príncipe de la bachata'').
