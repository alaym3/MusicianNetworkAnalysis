'''Like Moths to Flames''' is an American [[metalcore]] band from [[Columbus, Ohio]], formed in 2010 by former members of various bands, including [[Emarosa]], Agraceful, [[the Crimson Armada]], and [[My Ticket Home]]. The band has released four studio albums and three [[Extended play|EP]]s through [[Rise Records]]. The band's current line-up consists of lead vocalist Chris Roetter, bassist Aaron Evans, lead guitarist Jeremy Smith, and rhythm guitarist Zach Pishney. Roetter and Evans are the only two members of the original line-up that remain in the band.

==History==
===Formation and ''Sweet Talker'' (2010)===
The band was formed in early 2010. Vocalist Chris Roetter, having sung for the bands Agraceful and [[Emarosa]] beforehand, formed Like Moths to Flames with four of the six members of Ohio metalcore band TerraFirma: Aaron Evans (who joined playing rhythm guitar before later moving to bass); Zach Huston (lead guitar); Aaron Douglas (bass); and Jordan Matz (drums).<ref>{{cite web|title=About Like Moths To Flames|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/like-moths-to-flames/biography/|publisher=mtvk|access-date=November 10, 2015}}</ref> The band released their debut single titled "Dead Routine" on February 7, 2010. Prior to the release of debut EP ''[[Sweet Talker (Like Moths to Flames EP)|Sweet Talker]]'', they would release two more demos, "Avada Kedavra" and "Death Eaters". Death Eaters featured Michael Guilford of [[Legion (band)|Legion]] a deathcore band from the same area.

On October 17, 2010, it was announced that Like Moths to Flames had been signed to [[Rise Records]] and were already working on their first EP. Two months later, the band released their EP titled ''[[Sweet Talker (Like Moths to Flames EP)|Sweet Talker]]'' on December 14, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Like Moths to Flames - Sweet Talker EP|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2072242|publisher=absolutepunk|access-date=March 27, 2015}}</ref> To help support their new music, the band set out with fellow acts [[Texas in July]] and [[A Hero A Fake]] on the "A Metal Christmas" tour through late 2010. Sometime before their EP was released, drummer Jordan Matz left Like Moths to Flames, and was replaced by Lance Greenfield.

===''When We Don't Exist'' and line-up changes (2011–2012)===
With continuous touring through 2011, the band decided to settle back down and head into the studio to record their first full-length studio album. Right before the band headed to the studio, bassist Aaron Douglas parted ways with the band. The band had Eli Ford (formerly of My Ticket Home) join on guitar and Aaron Evans moved to bass. ''[[When We Don't Exist]]'' was released on November 8 through Rise Records. In January 2012, the band headed out on the S.I.N. Tour with acts [[Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows|D.R.U.G.S.]], [[Hit the Lights]] and [[Sparks the Rescue]] to support the album. Soon after, they toured with bands [[Texas in July]] and [[Hundredth (band)|Hundredth]].<ref>{{cite web|title=D.R.U.G.S. and Hit the Lights headline the S.I.N.

===''An Eye for an Eye'' (2013–2014)===
The band then spent the first half of 2013 headlining the Rise Records tour around the US with supporting acts [[Crown the Empire]], [[the Color Morale]], [[Palisades (band)|Palisades]] and [[My Ticket Home]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h20V-IV518g|title=The Rise Records Tour 2013|last=riserecords|date=January 28, 2013|access-date=January 18, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> The band recorded their second full-length album with Will Putney at (The Machine Shop) in Hoboken, New Jersey and was released July 9, 2013. On May 29, 2013, the band confirmed the new album was called ''[[An Eye for an Eye (Like Moths to Flames album)|An Eye for an Eye]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEWS: Like Moths To Flames confirm details of second album, 'An Eye for an Eye'!|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/25321/news-like-moths-to-flames-confirm-details-of-second-album-an-eye-for-an-eye|publisher=Dead Press!|access-date=March 27, 2015}}</ref> The album debuted at number 63 on the Billboard 200 top sales. They toured with the Vans Warped Tour over the summer of 2013 on the Monster Energy Stage. Shortly after the All Stars Tour 2014, guitarist Zach Huston decided to part ways with the band citing that he wants to pursue other interests. It wasn't until late in 2015 that he was replaced by guitarist Jeremy Smith, formerly of [[City Lights (band)|City Lights]].

===''The Dream Is Dead'' and ''The Dying Things We Live For'' (2015–2016)===
