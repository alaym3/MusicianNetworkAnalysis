'''The Chieftains''' are a traditional Irish band formed in [[Dublin]] in  1962, by [[Paddy Moloney]], [[Sean Potts]] and [[Michael Tubridy]]. Their sound, which is almost entirely instrumental and largely built around [[uilleann pipes]], has become synonymous with [[traditional Irish music]] and they are regarded as having helped popularise Irish music across the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/the-chieftains-out-of-this-world-3038454.html |title=The Chieftains... out of this world! |publisher=Independent.ie |date=3 March 2012 |access-date=14 February 2013}}</ref> They have won six [[Grammy]]s during their career and they were given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the prestigious [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]] in 2002.

==Name==
The band's name came from the book ''Death of a Chieftain'' by Irish author [[John Montague (poet)|John Montague]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.shaw.ca/chieftains/history.html|title=Shaw Communications|website=Members.shaw.ca|access-date=4 August 2018}}</ref> Assisted early on by [[Garech Browne]], they signed with his company [[Claddagh Records]]. They needed financial success abroad, and succeeded in this, as within a few years their third album's sleeve note section was printed in three languages.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Career==
===Origins===
[[Paddy Moloney]] came out of [[Ceoltóirí Chualann]], a group of musicians who specialised in instrumentals, and sought to form a new band. They had their first rehearsals at Moloney's house, with David Fallon and [[Martin Fay]] joining the original three. The group remained only semi-professional up until the 1970s and by then had achieved great success in Ireland and the United Kingdom. 

===Rise to international fame===
In 1973, their popularity began to spread to the United States when their previous albums were released there by [[Island Records]]. They received further acclaim when they worked on the [[Academy Award]]–winning soundtrack to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1975 film ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'', which triggered their transition to the mainstream in the US.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/arts/music/stones-chieftains-beach-boys-and-el-gran-combo-turn-50.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Ratliff | title=Stones, Chieftains, Beach Boys and El Gran Combo Turn 50 | date=3 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/keyword/chieftains |title=Articles about Chieftains – Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |access-date=14 February 2013}}</ref>

===Successful career===
The group continued to release successful records throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and their work with [[Van Morrison]] in 1988 resulted in the critically acclaimed album ''[[Irish Heartbeat]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sean Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/22/chieftains-bon-iver-decemberists |title=Chieftains team up with Bon Iver and the Decemberists |work=The Guardian |date= 22 November 2011|access-date=14 February 2013 |location=London}}</ref> They went on to collaborate with many other well-known musicians and singers; among them [[Luciano Pavarotti]], the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]] and [[Roger Daltrey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/02/14/146821406/the-chieftains-for-50-years-irish-music-for-the-world |title=The Chieftains: For 50 Years, Irish Music For The World |publisher=NPR |date=14 February 2012 |access-date=14 February 2013}}</ref> 

===50th anniversary===
In 2012, they celebrated their 50th anniversary with an ambitious album and tour. The album, ''Voice of Ages'', was produced by [[T-Bone Burnett]] and featured the Chieftains collaborating with many musicians including [[Bon Iver]], [[Paolo Nutini]] and [[The Decemberists]]. It also included a collaboration with [[NASA]] astronaut [[Catherine Coleman]] playing the flute aboard the [[International Space Station]] as it orbited the earth. The Chieftains performed at [[Carnegie Hall]] on March 17, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/03/16/chieftains-celebrating-50th-anniversary-with-carnegie-hall-concert/|title=Chieftains Celebrating 50th Anniversary With Carnegie Hall Concert|date=March 16, 2012|publisher=[[CBS New York]]|access-date=February 2, 2020}}</ref>

===The Irish Goodbye Tour===
In February 2019, The Chieftains embarked on an extensive farewell tour entitled the "Irish Goodbye Tour", including a 2019 European leg, a 2020 Canadian leg and two 2019 and 2020 US legs.<ref name="The Chieftains tours">{{cite web |url=https://www.thechieftains.com/tours/ |title=Tours |date= 13 March 2020 |publisher=The Chieftains |access-date= 13 March 2020}}</ref> 

On 13 March 2020, the band announced that a few tour dates of their "Irish Goodbye Tour" had been postponed (until further notice) following the [[coronavirus]] situation.{{refn|group=nb|Five shows scheduled for mid-March 2020 in the US had to be postponed due to the [[coronavirus]] situation in the US: on 13 March at [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] in [[Boston, MA]]; on 14 at the U of CT-Jorgensen Center in [[Storrs, CT]]; on 15 at the NJ Performing Arts Centre in [[Newark, NJ]]; on 17 at the Town Hall in [[New York, NY|New York City]]; on 19 at the George Mason University in [[Fairfax, VA]].

The band have become known for their vast work of collaborations with popular musicians of many genres, including [[country music]], [[Galician traditional music]], [[Newfoundland music]], and [[rock and roll]].  Their widespread work as collaborators resulted in the Irish Government awarding the group the honorary title of Ireland's Musical Ambassadors in 1989.<ref name=JP06>{{cite book | last = McCarthy| first = John Patrick  |  title = Ireland: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present| publisher = Infobase| year =2006 | page =216| isbn =978-0-8160-5378-0 }}</ref>

In May 1986, they performed at [[Self Aid]], a benefit concert held in Dublin that focused on the problem of chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time. In 1994, they appeared in [[Roger Daltrey]]'s production, album and video of ''[[A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who]]''.

They also performed with Canadian astronaut Cmdr. [[Chris Hadfield]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas|TX]] on 15 February 2013. Cmdr. Hadfield sang and played guitar on "Moondance" from aboard the [[International Space Station]].

==Success and legacy==
The band has won six [[Grammy Award]]s and been nominated eighteen times. They have won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and a [[Genie Award|Genie]] and contributed tracks, including their highly praised version of the song ''[[Women of Ireland]]'', to [[Leonard Rosenman]]'s [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning score for [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1975 film ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''.<ref name=JP06/> In 2002 they were given a ''[[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards#2002|Lifetime Achievement Award]]'' by the UK's [[BBC Radio 2]].

Dr. Gearóid Ó hAllmhuráin<ref>''Pocket History of Irish Traditional Music''. Dublin: The O'Brien Press, p. 155</ref> said the success of The Chieftains helped place Irish traditional music on a par with other musical genres in the world of popular entertainment. By collaborating with pop and rock musicians, they have taken Irish music to a much wider audience. They have become, in effect, musical ambassadors for Ireland. This de facto role was officially recognised by the Irish Government in 1989 when it awarded the group the honorary title of Ireland's Musical Ambassadors.<ref name=JP06/>

==Notable performances==
They played in a concert for [[Pope John Paul II]], before an audience of more than one million people in 1979 in Phoenix Park in Dublin, to mark the Papal visit to Ireland.<ref name=JP06/>

In 1983, they were invited by the Chinese Government to perform with the Chinese Broadcasting Art Group in a concert on the [[Great Wall of China]], becoming the first western musical group to do so.<ref>{{cite news | last =Lannert | first = John| title = An Irish Tradition For 29 Years, The Chieftains Have Been Entertaining Audiences And Attracting The Admiration of Fellow Performers|  publisher = Sun-Sentinel| date = 6 March 1992| url = http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-03-06/features/9201120378_1_paddy-moloney-chieftains-traditional-irish-music/3| access-date =27 February 2011 }}</ref> They were the first group to perform in the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., invited by Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] and the former Speaker of the House, [[Tip O'Neill]].<ref name=JP06/>
