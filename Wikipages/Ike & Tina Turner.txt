'''Ike & Tina Turner''' were an American musical duo consisting of husband and wife [[Ike Turner]] and [[Tina Turner]]. From 1960 to 1976, they performed live as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, supported by Ike Turner's band the [[Kings of Rhythm]] and [[backing vocalist]]s called [[the Ikettes]]. The Ike & Tina Turner Revue was regarded as "one of the most potent live acts on the R&B circuit".<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ike-tina-turner-mn0000094224/biography|work=allmusic.com|author=Steve Huey|title= Ike & Tina Turner Biography}}</ref>

The release of "[[River Deep – Mountain High]]" in 1966, followed by a tour of the UK with [[the Rolling Stones]], increased their popularity in Europe. Their later works are noted for interpretive soul-infused re-arrangements of [[rock music|rock]] songs such as "[[Come Together]]", "[[Honky Tonk Women|Honky Tonk Woman]]", and "[[Proud Mary]]", the latter of which won them a [[Grammy Award]] in 1972.<ref name=":4" /> Ike & Tina Turner received the first Golden European Record Award for their international hit "[[Nutbush City Limits]]" in 1974.<ref name=":1" /> They released dozens of albums; their most successful being ''[[Workin' Together]]'' and ''[[What You Hear Is What You Get - Live at Carnegie Hall|Live at Carnegie Hall]]''.

==Career==
===1954–1959: Origins===
In 1954, [[musician]] and [[bandleader]] Ike Turner visited his sister Lee Ethel Knight in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref name=":0" /> Soon after, he returned with his band, the [[Kings of Rhythm]], to perform at Ned Love's club in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]. Love eventually convinced Turner to relocate his band from [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/we-like-ike/Content?oid=2471513|title=We Like Ike|last=Durchholz|first=Daniel|date=May 16, 2001|website=Riverfront Times}}</ref> By 1956, Turner and his band became one of the most popular [[Concert|live attractions]] in the St. Louis and neighboring East St. Louis club scene. Prior to his move, Turner worked as a talent scout and session musician for [[Sun Records]], [[Modern Records]], and [[RPM Records (United States)|RPM Records]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLgqFaYmgw8C&pg=PA172|author=Bob Gulla |title=Icons of R&B and Soul, Vol. 1: An Encyclopedia of The Artists Who Revolutionized Rhythm | publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-31334-044-4 |date=2007|page=172}}</ref> Around this time, Ann Bullock<!-- This is not a typo.

She began attending a predominantly [[African American]] nightclub, [[Manhattan Club (nightclub)|Manhattan Club]], where she saw the Kings of Rhythm for the first time. She later recalled that she "almost went into a trance" watching Turner play.<ref name="book" />

Bullock eventually got to know Turner and his band. She began dating his saxophonist [[Raymond Hill (musician)|Raymond Hill]], with whom she had her first child, Raymond Craig Hill (later renamed Craig Raymond Turner) born in 1958.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/27/tina-turner-scatters-sons-ashes-pacific-after-apparent-suicide/848942002/|title=Tina Turner scatters son Craig's ashes in the Pacific: 'He will always be my baby'|last=Deerwester|first=Jayme|date=July 27, 2018|website=USA Today|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLgqFaYmgw8C&pg=PA174|author=Bob Gulla |title=Icons of R&B and Soul, Vol. 1: An Encyclopedia of The Artists Who Revolutionized Rhythm | publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-31334-044-4 |date=2007|page=174}}</ref> In 1957, Bullock, who had tried to convince Turner to let her perform onstage with him, was given a microphone from the band's drummer Eugene Washington.

In 1958, Bullock sang on her first record, the Ike Turner tune "[[Boxtop (Ike Turner song)|Boxtop]]", under the name "Little Ann". The single was released on the St. Louis label, Tune Town Records. Bullock later moved into Turner's home in East St. Louis where she was trained by him on vocal control and performance.<ref name="Bob Gulla 2007 175"/> They developed a close friendship, and acted more like "brother and sister". However, their friendship eventually turned into a romantic relationship and she became pregnant in January 1960.<ref name="book" />

=== 1960–1965: Early success ===
In March 1960, Ike scheduled his band to record a song he wrote titled, "[[A Fool in Love|A Fool In Love]]," for singer [[Art Lassiter]]. Lassiter failed to show up for the recording session at [[Technisonic Studios]] in St. Louis.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/March-2010/A-Conversation-With-Robbie-Montgomery/|title=A Conversation With Robbie Montgomery|last=Cooperman|first=Jeannette|date=February 26, 2010|website=St. Louis Magazine|language=en-us}}</ref> Having already booked the studio time, Ike allowed Bullock to record the song as a [[demo (music)|demo]] with Lassiter's backing vocalists, the Artettes: [[Robbie Montgomery]], Frances Hodges, and Sandra Harding.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rock and Roll is Here to Stay: An Anthology|publisher=W.W.

Murray was impressed by Bullock's vocal delivery and bought the rights to the song.

"A Fool In Love" became an immediate hit after its release in July [[1960 in music|1960]], reaching No. 2 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Hot R&B Sides]] on August 15.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=August 15, 1960|title=Billboard Hot R&B Sides|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/60s/1960/Billboard%201960-08-15.pdf|journal=Billboard|pages=42}}</ref> Ike formed the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, which included the Kings of Rhythm, male vocalist [[Jimmy Thomas]], and a trio of female vocalists called [[the Ikettes]].<ref name=":0" /> As the single climbed the pop chart they went from playing in clubs to theaters such as the [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]].

The success of the single was followed with another hit, "[[I Idolize You]]" and the release of their debut album ''[[The Soul of Ike & Tina Turner]]'' in February 1961. That same month, before a gig at [[Howard Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Tina decided to have her hair bleached, but a miscue resulted in her hair falling out. To cover up the incident Ike bought Tina a wig, which became incorporated into her stage appearance.<ref name="book" /> Later that year, the duo released their next hit, "[[It's Gonna Work Out Fine]]".

In April 1974, Ike and Tina released the album ''[[The Gospel According to Ike & Tina|The Gospel According to Ike & Tina Turner]]''. A few months later in August, Tina released her first solo album titled ''[[Tina Turns the Country On!]]''. Both albums received Grammy nominations at the [[17th Annual Grammy Awards]].

In early 1975, [[Gerhard Augustin]], co-founder of ''[[Beat-Club]]'' and former head of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] at United Artists in [[Munich]], became Ike and Tina's manager.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=February 8, 1975|title=Executive Turntable|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1975/Billboard%201975-02-08.pdf|journal=Billboard|pages=4}}</ref> He had previously co-produced a few of their singles and the album ''Feel Good'' (1972).

The lead single "[[Baby, Get It On]]" became the duo's last charting single together, peaking at No. 31 on the R&B chart.<ref name=":8" /> It was a hit in Europe where the Turners had a strong following, reaching No. 20 in [[Belgium]] and No. 9 in the [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Ike+%26+Tina+Turner&titel=Baby%2C+Baby+Get+It+On&cat=s|title=Ike & Tina Turner – Baby Get It On|website=Dutch Charts}}</ref>

===1976–78: The end of the duo===
By 1976, Ike's [[Cocaine dependence|cocaine addiction]] had caused a hole in his [[nasal septum]], leading to [[Epistaxis|nosebleeds]] from which he would relieve himself by using more of the drug.<ref name="Christian-10-2008" /> In March 1976, Ike and Tina headlined at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria]] in New York City. They also signed a deal with [[CBS|CBS-TV]] for nine television shows revolving around the Ike & Tina Turner Revue with the possibility of it becoming a regular series.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=April 15, 1976|title=Trouble Trails Tina Turner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcADAAAAMBAJ&q=turner|journal=Jet|pages=58–61}}</ref> Ike was planning for them to leave United Artists for a new record company, [[Cream Records]], for a reported annual amount of $150,000. The contract had a key person clause, meaning they would have to sign it in four days, keeping Tina contractually tied to Ike for five more years.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLgqFaYmgw8C&pg=PA184|author=Bob Gulla |title=Icons of R&B and Soul, Vol. 1: An Encyclopedia of The Artists Who Revolutionized Rhythm | publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-31334-044-4 |date=2007|page=184}}</ref>

On July 1, 1976, the Ike & Tina Turner Revue flew to [[Dallas, Texas]] where they had a gig at the [[Dallas Statler Hilton]]. While en route to the hotel, the Turners got into a physical altercation in the car. Soon after their arrival, Tina fled to the nearby [[Ramada Inn]] and later hid at several friends' homes.<ref name="book" /> On July 27, 1976, Tina filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293534,00.html |title=Tina's Independence Day |work=EW.com |date=August 2, 1996 |access-date=July 4, 2012 |author=Cheo Tyehimba}}</ref> Years later in her 1986 autobiography ''[[I, Tina|I, Tina: My Life Story]]'', she alleged that Ike had abused her throughout their marriage.<ref name="book" /> Ike claimed in his 1999 autobiography, ''[[Takin' Back My Name|Takin' Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner]]'', that Tina initiated their final fight by purposely irritating him so that she would have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign their new contract.<ref name=":0" />

Their divorce was finalized on March 29, 1978. In the settlement, Tina gave Ike her share of their Bolic Sound recording studio, publishing companies, real estate, and he kept his four cars. Tina retained her songwriter [[Royalty payment|royalties]] from songs she had written, but Ike received the publishing royalties for his [[Musical composition|compositions]] and hers. She also kept her two [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguars]], furs and jewelry along with her stage name. Tina took responsibility for the debts incurred from their missed concert dates as well as an [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] lien.<ref name="book" />

United Artists responded to the abrupt split by finishing albums from their last recording sessions, releasing ''[[Delilah's Power]]'' (1977) and ''[[Airwaves (Ike & Tina Turner album)|Airwaves]]'' (1978). In 1980, Ike released the single "Party Vibes"/"[[Shame, Shame, Shame (Shirley & Company song)|Shame, Shame, Shame]]" taken from ''[[The Edge (Ike Turner album)|The Edge]]'' (1980). The single peaked at No. 27 on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Disco Top 100]] chart.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=November 1, 1980|title=Billboard Disco Top 100|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/80s/1980/BB-1980-11-01.pdf|journal=Billboard|pages=39}}</ref>

After Tina's resurgence as a solo artist in the mid-1980s, compilation albums containing unreleased material were released, including ''[[Get Back (Ike & Tina Turner album)|Get Back]]'' (1985) and ''[[Golden Empire (Ike & Tina Turner album)|Gold Empire]]'' (1985). ''Get Back'' reached No. 189 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top Pop Albums]] chart.<ref name=":8" />
