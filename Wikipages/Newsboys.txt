== History ==

=== 1980s ===

The band was formed in [[Mooloolaba]], Queensland, Australia in 1985<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribdem.com/features/christian-bands-to-rock-war-memorial-in-big-church-night/article_94aa0fdc-d69c-11e7-aa12-672f9a34a19a.html|title=Christian bands to rock War Memorial in Big Church Night Out|first=KELLY URBAN|last=KURBAN@TRIBDEM.COM|website=The Tribune-Democrat|access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref> by two young men: [[Peter Furler]] and his school mate George Perdikis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2015/01/21/i-co-founded-one-of-the-most-popular-christian-rock-bands-ever-and-im-now-an-atheist/|title=I Co-Founded One of the Most Popular Christian Rock Bands Ever… and I'm Now An Atheist|work=Friendly Atheist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/newsboys-co-founder-im-now-an-atheist-richard-dawkins-had-an-influence-on-my-spiritual-journey.html|title=Newsboys Co-Founder: I'm Now an Atheist, Richard Dawkins' Had an Influence on My Spiritual Journey|website=The Christian Post|access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref> Furler and Perdikis practised in a garage on the Sunshine Coast, well known for being a "surfer's paradise". Two other teens were added soon after: Furler's best friend, John James, and bassist Sean Taylor. The band's original name was The News but they changed to Newsboys to prevent confusion with US-based band [[Huey Lewis and the News]]. Newsboys came to the United States in late 1987 after getting signed with Refuge Communications and released the album ''Read All About It'' in 1988 in the United States.

=== 1990s ===

After signing with Star Song Communications, they released two more albums in 1990 and 1991: ''[[Hell Is for Wimps]]'' and ''[[Boys Will Be Boyz]]'', with its first self-titled video. None of the band's first three albums garnered much attention, and the band's line-up changed with every release.

It wasn't until their 1992 album, ''[[Not Ashamed]]'' (containing a cover of the [[DeGarmo & Key]] song "Boycott Hell"), that the band gained notice in the Christian music scene with its second self-titled video that followed a year later. [[Steve Taylor]], a singer-songwriter and producer, began a partnership with the band, producing the band's record and writing most of the lyrics for their songs. Furler remained the band's primary songwriter and beginning with this album began sharing lead vocal duties with James and continued to do so until James' departure. The song "I'm Not Ashamed" uses the chorus from the [[Nik Kershaw]] song [[Wouldn't It Be Good]]. It is unclear if it was done as a copyright protected parody or used with/without permission since Nik is not credited as a writer.

In 1994, amidst continued line-up changes (which included the addition of mainstays Jody Davis and Duncan Phillips), the band released ''[[Going Public (Newsboys album)|Going Public]]'', their fifth album and first real success. The record proved to be a watershed for the group, winning a 1995 [[Dove Award]] for "Rock Album of the Year".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 1995 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020023036/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> It also produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: "Spirit Thing", "Real Good Thing", "Truth and Consequences", and, most notably, "[[Shine (Newsboys song)|Shine]]". "Shine" won the 1995 Dove for "Rock Recorded Song of the Year". In 2006, [[CCM Magazine]] listed "Shine" in the top 10 in its ranking of the 100 Greatest Songs in Christian music.

The 1996 follow-up album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (Newsboys album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'' was recorded with an expanded line up with new additions bassist [[Phil Joel]] and keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein. The album produced three more pop No.&nbsp;1 hits: "Reality", "Let It Go", and the title track, two rock No.&nbsp;1 hits: "Cup O' Tea" and "Breathe", as well as fan favourite and concert staple "Breakfast". This album also won the group's third Dove, this time for "Recorded Music Packaging of the Year".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 1997 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022843/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> This album spawned the Newsboys' first movie, ''[[Down Under the Big Top]]'' (1996), which was based on the song "Reality".

In late 1997, James announced he would be leaving the band to start a preaching ministry. In 2007, he revealed the actual reason was due to a drug and alcohol addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/print.php?Article_ID=25790 |title=John James: The Newsboys Ex-lead Singer Speaks About His Fall And Restoration |publisher=Crossrhythms.co.uk |date=26 January 2007 |access-date=15 October 2011}}</ref> With his departure, Furler moved from drums to vocals and auditions were held for the now-vacant drum position. Eventually, Duncan Phillips, who had previously played keyboards and percussion for the band moved over to the drum kit. From 1998 to 2003, the band's line-up of Furler, bassist [[Phil Joel]], guitarist Jody Davis, keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein, and Phillips stayed constant.

The first post-James record, ''[[Step Up to the Microphone]]'', sold well and produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: "Entertaining Angels", "WooHoo", "Believe", and the title track. It also spawned the Newsboys' live video, "Live One Night In Pennsylvania" a year later. "Entertaining Angels" won the 1999 Dove for "Short Form Music Video of the Year".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 1999 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022952/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref>

The band returned in 1999 with ''[[Love Liberty Disco]]'', the band's only album to significantly deviate from their pop rock sound. Instead, this particular album featured more of a disco sound. Still, it produced several hits, including the No.&nbsp;1 hits "Beautiful Sound" and "Good Stuff", as well as the title track. The LLD tour was significantly more popular than the album. This tour featured an inflatable arena, called the Air Dome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/newsboys/features/newsboys-love-libery-disco-tour-the-stats/ |title=Newsboys' Love Libery Disco Tour: The Stats |publisher=Today's Christian Music |access-date=27 November 2014}}</ref>

In 1999, [[Peter Furler|Furler]] co-founded [[Inpop Records]] with Wes Campbell as an independent contemporary Christian music record label.

=== 2000s ===
[[File:Newsboys at the 2001 National Lutheran Youth Gathering.jpg|thumb|Newsboys at the 2001 National Lutheran Youth Gathering, with Phil Joel in the foreground]]
In 2000, Newsboys headlined the annual, travelling [[Contemporary Christian Music|CCM]] concert, Festival Con Dios, with [[Audio Adrenaline]] and [[The O.C. Supertones]]. That same year, Newsboys released a greatest hits compilation, ''[[Shine: The Hits]]'', which did not include any songs from the ''Love Liberty Disco'' album, but included four new songs, two of which ("Joy" and "Who?") went to No.&nbsp;1. After this album, the band did not release any new material until the 2002 release of ''[[Thrive (Newsboys album)|Thrive]]'', a record that produced two No.&nbsp;1 singles: "Million Pieces (Kissin' Your Cares Goodbye)" and the praise and worship-driven "It Is You", which proved to be the biggest hit of their career up to that point also with its video, ''Thrive: From The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame''. Also in 2002, The Newsboys recorded the track "In the Belly of the Whale" for the end credits of the 2002 movie ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]''.

After the success of "It Is You", the Newsboys then followed with two praise and worship albums: ''[[Adoration: The Worship Album]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Devotion (Newsboys album)|Devotion]]'' in 2004. Late in 2003, Davis departed and was replaced by [[Bryan Olesen]] on guitar. In 2005, The Newsboys co-authored a book of devotions with Jim Laffoon entitled ''Our Daily Blog'' which was published by Inspiro and released on 1 November.<ref>{{cite book|title=Our Daily Blog: Devotions by Pastor Jim Laffoon: Books: Jim Laffoon, Newsboys |id={{ASIN|0310811694|country=uk}} }}</ref> They also recorded their Creation 2005 set for a live DVD to be released with their upcoming album.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 2006, Oleson left the band to focus on his own band [[VOTA|Casting Pearls]] and was replaced by [[Paul Colman]], formerly of [[Paul Colman Trio]].

More radio hits came in 2006 with a live version of "I Am Free" (originally written by Jon Egan of the [[Desperation Band]]), and "Wherever We Go". On 31 October 2006, The Newsboys released a pop/rock record entitled ''[[Go (Newsboys album)|GO]]''. ''GO'' featured David Eri as a co-writer and the songs "Something Beautiful" and "In Wonder" were big hits on Christian Radio.<ref name=RR2007CHR>[http://www.radioandrecords.com/Formats/Charts/YearEnd/07/Christian_CHR_songs.asp 2007 Year End Charts/Top Christian CHR songs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525095330/http://www.radioandrecords.com/Formats/Charts/YearEnd/07/Christian_CHR_songs.asp |date=25 May 2009 }}, [[R&R (magazine)|R&R magazine]]. Retrieved 6 January 2008</ref> That December, Joel announced that he would leave the band to pursue his own projects and albums. On 8 May 2007, the band released ''[[GO Remixed]]'' which was made up of new versions of the songs from ''GO'' and featured remixes by [[Tedd T.]], Jeff Frankenstein, Max Hsu of [[Superchick]] and Lee Bridges.
[[File:Peter Furler2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Furler]] spent 12 years as lead singer of the band]]
On 20 November 2007 the Newsboys released their second greatest hits compilation, ''[[The Greatest Hits (Newsboys album)|The Greatest Hits]]''. The eighteen-song CD also features two new songs "I Fought the La..." and "Stay Strong". This album was followed by ''Newsboys Live: [[Houston We Are GO]]'', a CD/DVD combo recording package of a show from the GO Tour, which was released on 30 September 2008. Also in 2008, the band, with Steve Taylor providing vocals, recorded the song "Yo Ho Hero" for ''[[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie]]''.

On 5 January 2009, Colman announced he would be leaving The Newsboys to return to his solo projects. At the same time, it was announced that Davis would return to the band, after a five-year hiatus. "I am thrilled to be returning to the band and back with my bandmates, who are some of my best friends," says Davis, "this is a big change in my life, and I'm looking forward to the tour and new record with excitement."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsboys.com/2009/01/jody-davis-returns-to-newsboys/ |title=Jody Davis Returns To Newsboys! |publisher=Newsboys.com |access-date=15 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006185129/http://newsboys.com/2009/01/jody-davis-returns-to-newsboys/ |archive-date=6 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Newsboys 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Newsboys with Michael Tait in 2009]]

In 2009, it was announced that Furler, having toured with The Newsboys since the band's inception, had decided to step back into a support role and would continue as the band's primary songwriter and producer. Because of this, a replacement lead vocalist was required so the band could continue touring. On 9 March 2009, it was announced that [[Michael Tait]], formerly of [[dc Talk]], would be the new lead singer. "Michael Tait will be touring with the band as lead singer with Furler making special appearances throughout the year. Furler will continue with the band and his trademark songwriting and production will remain as he focuses his professional career toward future Newsboys recordings."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsboys.com/2009/03/michael-tait-to-join-newsboys/ |title=Michael Tait To Join Newsboys |publisher=Newsboys.com |access-date=15 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006190528/http://newsboys.com/2009/03/michael-tait-to-join-newsboys/ |archive-date=6 October 2011  }}</ref> On 17 March, Tait performed his first full concert as lead singer in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.

The Newsboys released the studio album ''[[In the Hands of God]]'' on 5 May on [[Inpop Records]] with Max Hsu producing the album. Long-time collaborator Steve Taylor co-wrote all the songs and sang on one song. During their concert of 11 September in Orlando, Furler announced that this would be his final guest appearance with the band.
