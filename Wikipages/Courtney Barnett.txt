The album was eventually released on 18 May 2018 and titled ''[[Tell Me How You Really Feel]]''. The album dealt, in part, with Barnett's thoughts about isolation in the social media age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/you_must_be_having_so_much_fun_everythings_amazing/|title=Courtney Barnett: You Must Be Having So Much Fun.

On 7 July 2021, Barnett released "Rae Street", the lead single from her third studio album, ''[[Things Take Time, Take Time]]'', which was released on 12 November 2021.<ref name="Rae Street">{{cite web|url=http://www.noise11.com/news/courtney-barnett-says-she-has-a-new-album-20210708|title=Courtney Barnett Says She Has A New Album|website=noise11|date=8 July 2021|access-date=8 July 2021|author=Cashmere, Paul}}</ref>

== Equipment and playing style ==
Barnett plays left handed, using mostly left-hand constructed guitars, with standard tuning and string order for left-handed players (low strings at top, high strings at the bottom).<ref name=thatmag /> She occasionally plays right-handed guitars flipped upside down, but does not prefer it.  She learned to play on acoustic guitars, and disliking the sound of a [[Plectrum|pick]], developed her own method of [[fingerstyle guitar]] which she later translated to use on the electric guitar.  She is capable of using a pick and claims she could probably play better with one, but prefers to play with just her fingers; strumming with both her thumb and index finger on rhythm parts, and using her index finger as one would use a pick for lead parts. She prefers to play in [[standard tuning]], but has used [[open G tuning]] for slide guitar.<ref name = PG>{{cite web|last1=Gluckin|first1=Tzvi|title=Courtney Barnett: The New Sensation (interview)|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/22424-courtney-barnett-the-new-sensation|website=Premier Guitar|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

Among her guitars she uses for performance and recording are a [[Harmony Company|Harmony H59]], and a number of [[Fender Guitar|Fenders]], including [[Fender Jaguar|Jaguars]], [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocasters]], and [[Fender Telecaster|Telecasters]], which she strings with [[Ernie Ball]] Power Slinky strings in the 0.011−0.048 gauge. She plays through Fender Hot Rod Deville and Fender Deluxe amplifiers, with a number of [[effects pedal]]s, including a Fulltone OCD overdrive pedal, a "cheap delay pedal", and a chorus pedal.<ref name = PG/><ref>{{cite web|title=Courtney Barnett|url=http://equipboard.com/pros/courtney-barnett|website=Equipboard.com|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Barnett is a [[lesbian]]. She was in a relationship with fellow musician [[Jen Cloher]] from 2012 to 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://controlzine.com/interviews/listen-music-death-and-memory-jen-cloher-and-jo-syme-in-conversation/|title=Listen {{!}} Music, Death and Memory – Jen Cloher and Jo Syme in Conversation {{!}} Control|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xpressmag.com.au/jen-cloher-happy-wife/|title=JEN CLOHER Happy wife... |website=Xpressmag.com.au|access-date=2018-03-15}}</ref> and the song "Numbers" was co-written by the pair about their relationship. Barnett's song "Pickles from the Jar" also details their relationship, and Cloher is mentioned in the first line of "Dead Fox". Barnett called Cloher a "huge constant influence" on her music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/14/courtney-barnett-kurt-vile-album-lotta-see-lice-interview |title=Courtney Barnett: 'It's easy to feel hopeless and lost in this weird world' |publisher=The Observer |date=2017-10-14 |author=Kathryn Bromwich |access-date=2017-10-14}}</ref> She also played guitar in Cloher's band from 2012 to 2018.
