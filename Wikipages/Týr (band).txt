'''Týr''' ({{IPA-fo|tʰʊɪːɹ|lang}}) is a [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] [[folk metal]] band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/T%C3%BDr/14435 |title=Týr - Encyclopaedia Metallum |publisher=[[The Metal Archives]] |date=11 November 2003 |access-date=14 November 2013}}</ref> They have been characterised as one of "the islands' two most successful metal bands".<ref>Joshua Green, 'From the Faroes to the World Stage', in ''The Oxford Handbook of Popular Music in the Nordic Countries'', ed. by Fabian Holt, Antti-Ville Kärjä (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017), pp. 111-29 (p. 119); {{ISBN|9780190603908}}.</ref> Their subject matter revolves almost entirely around [[Vikings|Viking]] lore, [[Norse mythology|mythology]], and history,<ref>''Færøsk Rock: Rock on the rocks'' Jyllands-Posten | 1 May 2001 | Kunst_og_Kultur | Side 10 | 1212 ord (portrait of the band)</ref> taking their name from [[Týr]], the god of war in [[Norse religion]].

==History==
[[file:Tyr-logo.svg|thumb|upright|The band logo]]
Before Týr, [[Heri Joensen]] and Gunnar H. Thomsen formed their first band, Cruiser, at the age of 17. Streymoy also played with them for a short while. They later changed their name to Wolfgang. Although neither band released any albums, Wolfgang, who are still active, recorded an undisclosed number of songs that, according to Joensen, are "pretty much ready to release".<ref>Pre-''Týr'' info is discussed in this [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206084159/http://deadtide.com/interviews/page.php?id=110 Deadtide Interview]</ref>

Týr formed in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark in 1998.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal |last1=Spracklen |first1=Karl |title='To Holmgard … and Beyond': Folk metal fantasies and hegemonic white masculinities |journal=Metal Music Studies |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=359–377 [368]|doi=10.1386/mms.1.3.359_1|url=http://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/1664/3/MMS%20Special%20Issue%20-%20Metal%20and%20Marginalisation-spracklen-folkmetal-RESUBMITTED%2022%20Maydocx.pdf }}</ref> Heri Joensen met his old bandmate, Kári Streymoy, at a party in January in Copenhagen. Joensen suggested to Streymoy that they should meet up and [[Jam session|jam]]. Streymoy initially declined, but later took him up on his offer. They were soon joined by another former bandmate, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen, expanding the duo into a trio. In 2001, guitarist Terji Skibenæs joined the band.

They signed a worldwide deal with Austria's [[Napalm Records]] in early 2006, while signed to the Faroese record label [[Tutl]]. In September 2012, they signed a three-album deal with [[Metal Blade Records]].<ref name="auto"/>

They began making music which was heavily inspired by [[Norse mythology]], [[kvæði]] (Faroese traditional music), and [[heavy metal music]] in general. According to the band's frontman Heri Joensen:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=4&id=5859 |title=Interview with Heri Joensen |work=The Metal Observer |date=March 2004 |access-date=24 October 2012}}</ref>

{{cquote|"Týr's musical mission is to break down the walls that are erected between all the kinds of metal that have arisen over the years. Power, doom, black, progressive, gothic, viking, folk, ethnic and epic metal. Walls and labels do nothing but fill people with prejudice."
| author = Heri Joensen
}}

Accordingly, scholarship has found that the band's lyrics and imagery promote pan-Nordic ideologies, and draw on well established, transnational genre conventions from metal music; but has also suggested that the band's insistence on their Faroese identity, which has been [[Commodity fetishism|fetishised]] by international audiences, could be "regarded as a form of [[Exoticism|self-exoticisation]]".<ref>Joshua Green, 'From the Faroes to the World Stage', in ''The Oxford Handbook of Popular Music in the Nordic Countries'', ed. by Fabian Holt, Antti-Ville Kärjä (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017), pp. 111-29 (p. 123-24); {{ISBN|9780190603908}}.</ref> The band's handling of traditional songs is characterised by fidelity to traditional melodies, but more complex and innovative handling of associated [[Chord progression|chord progressions]] and harmonies.<ref>Mark David Deeks, '[https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/16034/1/Deeks_MD_Music_PhD_2016.pdf National Identity in Northern and Eastern European Heavy Metal]' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Leeds, 2016), pp. 163-66.</ref>

The band has been accused of promoting [[Nazi]] ideologies through their use of runes and other imagery appropriated by Nazis. The band responded to these accusations with the song "Shadow of the [[Swastika]]" on the album ''Lay of Thrym'' (2011), which in the assessment of Karl Spracklen, "attacks the far-right for appropriating...heathen symbols and images associated with pre-Christian northern Europe". Even so, scholars have, in the words of Catherine Hoad and Samuel Whiting, suggested that "through imagining the Viking as an ancestral, genetic category, the 'common past' of the Nordic people is constructed as a self-identity apart from other people" in the work of Týr.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hoad |first1=Catherine |last2=Whiting |first2=Samuel |title=True Kvlt?

They were part of the Paganfest tour in Europe and the U.S. in 2008, with [[Ensiferum]] headlining. Other bands on the tour included [[Eluveitie]], [[Turisas]] in the United States, and [[Moonsorrow]] and [[Korpiklaani]] joined them on the European part of the tour.

In 2009, the band also took part in the "Black Sails over Europe" tour, supporting [[Alestorm]], who were promoting their album ''[[Black Sails at Midnight]]''.

Later, in 2010, the band would support [[Amon Amarth]] and [[Holy Grail (band)|Holy Grail]] on Amon Amarth's North American tour for select dates.

In January 2011 and 2013, Týr played on the [[70000 Tons of Metal]] cruise ship event with 40 other bands.

In 2012, the band supported [[Korpiklaani]] on their "Manala" tour in the U.S. and Canada along with [[Metsatöll]] and Moonsorrow.

During April 2013, Týr joined [[Ensiferum]], [[Heidevolk]] and others for the North American leg of the Paganfest tour.

The band took part in a European tour between 6 September and 14 October 2013 with Finnish folk metal band [[Finntroll]] and Icelandic band [[Skálmöld]]. The tour was called "Blodsvept over Europe".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centurymedia.com/newsdetailed.aspx?IdNews=12882&IdCompany=3 |title=Finntroll: announce "Blodsvept Over Europe Tour 2013" |date=27 May 2013 |website=Centurymedia.com |publisher=Century Media Records |access-date=5 October 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Metalmania 2007 TYR Terji Skibenas 001.jpg|thumb|Terji Skibenæs at [[Metalmania]] 2007]]

Singer [[Pól Arni Holm]] and guitarist Jón Joensen (Heri Joensen's brother) were part of the band while they recorded ''How Far to Asgaard'' but left soon after its release.

Terji Skibenæs joined after Jón Joensen had left the band. Allan Streymoy (Kári Streymoy's brother) took over singing duties for a brief time during which they released the single "Ólavur Riddararós". After Allan left, Heri Joensen took over the vocals. It was this line up which recorded ''Eric the Red''.

Skibenæs left the band for a while after the release of ''Eric the Red''. The band played as a trio for some time. In the summer of 2004 they were joined by Icelandic guitarist Ottó P. Arnarson for a very brief time. When Arnarson left, Skibenæs came back.

Kári Streymoy had a back injury in January 2008, which made him unable to tour until October the same year. Amon Djurhuus, a Faeroese drummer and student of Kári Streymoy, played the drums on the European part of the Paganfest, Merlin Sutter from Eluveitie filled for him on the US part and Daniel Ryan from Gigan on the Canadian part. After that for the festival tour in Europe Amon Djurhuus filled for Kári again. In October 2008 Kári Streymoy was ready to go again for the Ragnarök's Aaskereia Festival Tour.

Týr announced on 12 May 2013 via their official website as well as their [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Myspace]] pages that they had parted ways with longtime drummer Kári Streymoy, owing to the back injury he had received in 2008 which had affected his drumming. On 15 May 2013, they announced that [[George Kollias (drummer)|George Kollias]] will record drums for their seventh album ''Valkyrja''. Amon Djurhuus enters temporarily in the band, once again, for the tour with Finntroll between September and October 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalblade.com/us/news/tyr-recruits-george-kollias-to-track-drums/|title=TÝR recruits George Kollias to track drums  |website=Metalblade.com|date=15 May 2013 |access-date=15 May 2013}}</ref>

In August 2018, after 17 years with the band, Terji Skibenæs announced his departure, stating "There's no drama or anything going on between me and the others. It's just me not having any joy to play the music in the style of TÝR anymore. I want to thank Heri Joensen and Gunnar Thomsen for the all the time we had and I wish TÝR all the best in the future."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/longtime-tyr-guitarist-terji-skibenaes-exits-band/|title=Longtime TÝR Guitarist TERJI SKIBENÆS Exits Band|website=Blabbermouth.com|date=2 August 2018|access-date=4 August 2018}}</ref> The opening left by Skibenæs' exit was filled by former [[Nevermore]] and [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] guitarist Attila Vörös.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/tyr-recruits-former-nevermore-guitarist-attila-voros/|title=TÝR Recruits Former NEVERMORE Guitarist ATTILA VÖRÖS|website=Blabbermouth.com|date=3 August 2018|access-date=4 August 2018}}</ref>

In June 2021, it was announced that Hans Hammer would be Attila Vörös' replacement.

===Side projects===
Current Týr lead singer, [[Heri Joensen]], is working on a side project with the band Heljareyga. They released their self-titled debut album in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metal-sound.net/interviews/|title=Interviews|date=2 March 2016|website=Metal-sound.net|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref> All lyrics on the album are in [[Faroese language|Faroese]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=400889611&blogId=528799135 |title=Heljareyga album update van Heljareyga op Myspace |website=Blogs.myspace.com |date=9 February 2010 |access-date=1 December 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708104449/http://www.myspace.com/heljareyga/blog/528799135 |archive-date=8 July 2012 }}</ref> It was released first as a download on 12 February 2010 at digital retailers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=400889611&blogId=529025055 |title=Download the new Heljareyga Album van Heljareyga op Myspace |website=Blogs.myspace.com |date=12 February 2010 |access-date=21 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=7 February 2009 }}</ref> but CD copies came later available at Tutl Records.

Joensen also has the side project 'Surma' with his Czech girlfriend Viktorie Surmová. Their first album, ''The Light Within'', was released on 1 November 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surma.band/merch/p/reveal-the-light-within-cd-2020|title=Reveal the Light Within CD|website=surma.band|date=8 September 2020|access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref>
