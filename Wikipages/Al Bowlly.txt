'''Albert Allick Bowlly''' (7 January 1898<ref>{{BFI|id=4ce2bad287dec|name=Al Bowlly}}</ref> – 17 April 1941) was a [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambican]]-born [[South Africa]]n–[[British people|British]] vocalist and jazz guitarist, who was popular during the 1930s in Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flashbak.com/the-wednesday-and-the-death-of-the-crooner-al-bowlly-414748/|title='The Wednesday' – and the Death of the Crooner Al Bowlly|first=Rob|last=Baker|website=Flashbak.com|date=16 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="Larkin"/> He recorded more than 1,000 songs.

His most popular songs include "[[Midnight, the Stars and You]]", "[[Goodnight, Sweetheart (1931 song)|Goodnight, Sweetheart]]", "[[Close Your Eyes (Bernice Petkere song)|Close Your Eyes]]", "[[The Very Thought of You]]", [[Guilty (1931 song)|"Guilty"]], “[[Heartaches (song)|Heartaches]]" and "[[Love Is the Sweetest Thing]]". He also recorded the only English version of  [[Dark Eyes (Russian song)|"Dark Eyes"]] by [[Adalgiso Ferraris]], as "Black Eyes", with the words of Albert Mellor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD4uJa8N2eo|title=Al Bowlly - Dark Eyes|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

==Early life==
Bowlly was born in [[Lourenço Marques]] (today Maputo) in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony of Mozambique.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=170}}</ref> His parents were [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]].<ref name="Bush">{{cite web |last1=Bush |first1=John |title=Al Bowlly |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-bowlly-mn0000608166/biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=23 September 2018}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.memorylane.org.uk/the_al_bowlly_story.htm|title=The Al Bowlly Story|publisher=Memorylane.org.uk|access-date=1 January 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204175506/http://www.memorylane.org.uk/the_al_bowlly_story.htm|archive-date=4 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They met en route to Australia and moved to [[South Africa]]. Bowlly was brought up in [[Johannesburg]].<ref name="Bush" />

==Career==
After a series of odd jobs in South Africa, including barber and jockey, he sang in a dance band led by Edgar Adeler on a tour of South Africa, [[Southern Rhodesia|Rhodesia]], [[British Raj|India]] and [[Indonesia]] during the mid-1920s. He was fired from the band in [[Surabaya]], Indonesia.

Jimmy Liquime hired him to sing with the band in India and Singapore.<ref name="Bush" /> In 1927 Bowlly made his first record, a cover version of "[[Blue Skies (Irving Berlin song)|Blue Skies]]" by [[Irving Berlin]] that was recorded with Adeler in [[Berlin]], Germany. During the next year, he worked in London, with the orchestra of [[Fred Elizalde]].<ref name="Bush" />

The onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 resulted in Bowlly losing his job; he returned to several months of busking to survive. In the 1930s, he signed two contracts—one in May 1931 with [[Roy Fox]], singing in his live band for the Monseigneur Restaurant, a stylish restaurant on [[Piccadilly]] in [[London]], the other a record contract with bandleader [[Ray Noble (musician)|Ray Noble]] in November 1930.<ref name="Larkin"/>

During the next four years, he recorded over 500 songs. By 1933, [[Lew Stone]] had ousted Fox as the Monseigneur's bandleader and Bowlly was singing Stone's arrangements with Stone's band.<ref name="Larkin"/> After much radio exposure and a successful British tour with Stone, Bowlly was inundated with demands for appearances and gigs — including undertaking a solo British tour — but continued to make most of his recordings with Noble. There was considerable competition between Noble and Stone for Bowlly's time. For much of the year, Bowlly spent the day in the recording studio with Noble's band, rehearsing and recording, then the evening with Stone's band at the Monseigneur. Many of these recordings with Noble were issued in the United States by [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]], which meant that by the time Noble and Bowlly came to America, their reputation had preceded them.

Bowlly performed in England with his band, the Radio City Rhythm Makers.<ref name="Bush" /> By 1937, the band had broken up when vocal problems were traced to a wart in his throat, briefly causing him to lose his voice. Separated from his wife and with his band dissolved, he borrowed money from friends and travelled to [[New York City]] for surgery.<ref name="Larkin"/>

His absence from the UK in the early 1930s damaged his popularity with British audiences, despite his association with pianist Monia Liter as his accompanist. His career began to suffer as a result of problems with his voice, which affected the frequency of his recordings. He played a few small parts in films, but the parts were often cut and scenes that were shown were brief. Noble was offered a role in Hollywood, although the offer excluded Bowlly because a singer had already been hired. Bowlly moved back to London with his wife Marjie in January 1937.

With diminished success in Britain, he toured regional theatres and recorded as often as possible to make a living, moving from orchestra to orchestra, working with [[Sydney Lipton]], [[Geraldo (bandleader)|Geraldo]] and [[Ken "Snakehips" Johnson]].<ref name="Larkin"/> In 1940, there was a revival of interest in his career when he worked in a duo with Jimmy Messene in ''Radio Stars with Two Guitars'' on the London stage.<ref name="Larkin"/> It was his last venture before his death in April 1941. The partnership was uneasy; Messene was an alcoholic and he was occasionally unable to perform. Bowlly recorded his last song two weeks before his death. It was a duet with Messene of Irving Berlin's satirical song about [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], "When That Man Is Dead and Gone".

==Personal life and death==
In December 1931, Bowlly married Constance Freda Roberts (died 1934) in St Martin's Register Office, London; the couple separated after a fortnight and sought a divorce. He remarried in December 1934 to Marjie Fairless; this marriage lasted until his death.

On 16 April 1941, Bowlly and Messene had given a performance at the Rex Cinema in Oxford Street, [[High Wycombe]]. Both were offered an overnight stay in town, but Bowlly took the last train home to his flat at 32 Duke Street, Duke's Court, St James, London. He was killed by a [[Luftwaffe]] [[parachute mine]] that detonated outside his flat at ten past three in the morning.<ref name="auto"/> His body appeared unmarked. Although the explosion had not disfigured him, it had blown his bedroom door off its hinges, and the impact against his head was fatal. He was buried with other bombing victims in a mass grave at [[City of Westminster Cemetery, Hanwell|Hanwell Cemetery]], Uxbridge Road, [[Hanwell]], where his name is given as Albert Alex Bowlly.

A [[blue plaque]] commemorating Bowlly was installed in November 2013 by [[English Heritage]] at Charing Cross Mansion, 26 [[Charing Cross Road]], described as "his home at the pinnacle of his career".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/wg-news-1.nsf/0/B29B64CC82627D3A80257C2F0033417A?OpenDocument|title=Blue Plaque For Singer Al Bowlly|date=25 November 2013|access-date=19 September 2014|publisher=English Heritage}}</ref>
