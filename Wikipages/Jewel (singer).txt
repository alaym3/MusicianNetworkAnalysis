'''Jewel Kilcher''' (born May 23, 1974){{Sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=152}} is an American singer-songwriter, musician, actress, and author. She has received four [[Grammy Award]] nominations and, as of 2021, has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.<ref name=varga/>

Jewel was raised near [[Homer, Alaska]], where she grew up singing and [[yodeling]] as a duo with her father, a local musician. At age fifteen, she received a partial scholarship at the [[Interlochen Arts Academy]] in Michigan, where she studied operatic voice. After graduating, she began writing and performing at clubs and coffeehouses in [[San Diego]], California. Based on local media attention, she was offered a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]], which released her debut album, ''[[Pieces of You]]'', in 1995; it went on to become one of the best-selling debut albums of all time, going 12-times platinum. The debut single from the album, "[[Who Will Save Your Soul]]", peaked at number 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; two others, "[[You Were Meant for Me (Jewel song)|You Were Meant for Me]]" and "[[Foolish Games]]", reached number two on the Hot 100, and were listed on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1997|1997 year-end singles chart]], as well as ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1998|1998 year-end singles chart]].

Her subsequent album, ''[[Spirit (Jewel album)|Spirit]]'', was released in 1998, followed by ''[[This Way (Jewel album)|This Way]]'' (2001). In 2003, she released ''[[0304]]'', which marked a departure from her previous folk-oriented records, featuring electronic arrangements and elements of [[dance-pop]]. In 2008, she released ''[[Perfectly Clear]]'', her first [[country music|country]] album; it debuted atop ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top Country Albums [[Billboard charts|chart]] and featured three singles, "[[Stronger Woman]]", "[[I Do (Jewel song)|I Do]]", and "[[Perfectly Clear|'Til It Feels Like Cheating]]". Jewel released her first independent album, ''[[Lullaby (Jewel album)|Lullaby]]'', in 2009.

Jewel has also had endeavors in writing and acting; in 1998 she released a collection of [[poetry]], and the following year appeared in a supporting role in [[Ang Lee]]'s [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[Ride with the Devil (film)|Ride with the Devil]]'' (1999) which earned her critical acclaim.

According to Kilcher, the first song she learned to sing was "[[Saint Louis Blues (song)|Saint Louis Blues]]".<ref>{{cite episode|series=Later...

At age fifteen, while working at a dance studio in Anchorage, she was referred by the studio instructor to [[Interlochen Arts Academy]] in [[Interlochen, Michigan]], where she applied and received a partial scholarship to study operatic voice.<ref>{{cite interview|first=Jewel|last=Kilcher|date=May 24, 2010|interviewer=[[Howard Stern]]|work=The Howard Stern Show|title=Interview with Jewel|publisher=Sirius XM Radio}}</ref> Local businesses in her hometown of Homer donated items for auction to help allocate additional funds, and raised a total of $11,000 to pay the remainder of her first year's tuition.<ref name=bio/> She subsequently relocated to Michigan to attend Interlochen, where she received classical training, and also learned to play guitar.{{sfn|McFarland|1998|p=27}} She began writing songs on guitar at age sixteen.{{Sfn|DeMain|2004|p=200}} While in school, she would often perform live in [[coffeehouse]]s.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAsEAAAAMBAJ&q=jewel+kilcher+coffee+house&pg=PA26|title=Popular Uprisings|author=Borzillo, Carrie|date=February 4, 1995|page=26|via=Google Books}} {{Free access}}</ref> After graduating, she relocated to [[San Diego]], California, where she worked in a coffee shop and as a phone operator at a computer warehouse.{{sfn|McFarland|1998|p=34}}

Jewel was discovered by Inga Vainshtein in August 1993 when John Hogan, lead singer from the local San Diego band Rust, whom Vainshtein was managing, called to tell her about a girl surfer who sang at a local coffee shop on Thursdays. Vainshtein drove to The Inner Change with a representative of [[Atlantic Records]], and after the show called Danny Goldberg, the head of Atlantic Record's West Coast operations, and asked him to pay for her demo, since at the time she was living in a van and lacked the means to record any of her own music.{{Sfn|DeMain|2004|p=200}} Vainshtein, who at the time was working as a Vice President of Productions at Paramount, went on to become her manager and was instrumental in creating a major bidding war that led to her deal with Atlantic Records.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Instauration|volume=23–35|publisher=Howard Allen Enterprises|year=1997|page=11|title=She's a Jewel}}</ref> She continued to manage Jewel until the end of the first album cycle and shaped the path of the first five years of Jewel's career. Jewel's debut album ''[[Pieces of You]]'' was released under the eponym of Jewel, in 1995 when she was 21 years old.{{sfn|McFarland|1998|p=118}} Recorded in a studio on singer [[Neil Young]]'s ranch, it included Young's backing band, The Stray Gators, who played on his ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' and ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' albums. Part of the album was recorded live at The Inner Change Cafe in San Diego, where she had risen to local fame. The album stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years, reaching number four at its peak.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/304592/Jewel/chart?f=332|work=Billboard|title=Jewel|series=Chart history|access-date=December 28, 2016|archive-date=April 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407210306/http://www.billboard.com/artist/304592/Jewel/chart?f=332|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album spawned the Top 10 hits "You Were Meant for Me", "[[Who Will Save Your Soul]]", and "[[Foolish Games]]".

In the late 1990s, Mike Connell created an electronic mailing list for fans, known as "Everyday Angels". Although Jewel herself does not subscribe to this mailing list, she maintained communication with her EDA fans. On July 18 and 19, 1996, she gave a two-day concert known as "JewelStock" at the Bearsville Theatre. Jewel allowed the concert to be taped, and fans circulated the concert without profit.<ref>{{cite web|title = Jewel EveryDay Angels List Homepage & Guide|url = http://www.quackquack.net/jewel/|website = Quackquack.net|access-date =October 11, 2015}}</ref>

Jewel has said: "I don't think I started off young as a feminist. I read a lot of books in Alaska, I was pretty isolated where I grew up, and I think that I never thought I was any different than a man; I was raised in a place where pioneer women were very strong still. They'd shoe horses and build their own homes and were very self-sufficient. It wasn't really until I've gotten older that I really became a fan of women. And a fan of what women are capable of balancing and achieving, by just being them."<ref>{{cite web |last=Hatch |first=Holly |title=Folk Artist Jewel on Feminism and LGBT Courage |date=March 14, 2014 |url=http://outfrontonline.com/social/high-society/ofc-exclusive-folk-artist-jewel-on-feminism-and-lgbt-courage/ |newspaper=[[Out Front (newspaper)|Out Front]] |access-date=June 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906002441/http://outfrontonline.com/news/interviews/ofc-exclusive-folk-artist-jewel-on-feminism-and-lgbt-courage/ |archive-date=September 6, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>
