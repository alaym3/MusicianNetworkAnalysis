A '''starship''', '''starcraft''', or '''interstellar spacecraft''' is a theoretical [[spacecraft]] designed for [[interstellar travel|traveling between planetary systems]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com|title=What Would a Actually Look Like?|publisher=Popularmechanics|language=en|author=Erik Sofge|date=20 September 2012|access-date=9 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010713000027/http://www.yahoo.com/|archive-date=13 July 2001|url-status=live}}</ref>

The term is mostly found in [[science fiction]]. Reference to a "star-ship" appears as early as 1882 in ''[[Oahspe: A New Bible]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gailallen.com/rel/Oahspe/index.htm|title=Oahspe - Index|website=gailallen.com|access-date=2015-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304224128/http://gailallen.com/rel/Oahspe/index.htm|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}; {{cite web|url=http://gailallen.com/rel/Oahspe/oah223.htm|title=Oahspe - Book of Divinity: Chapter XVI|website=gailallen.com|access-date=2015-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208164942/http://gailallen.com/rel/Oahspe/oah223.htm|archive-date=2015-12-08|url-status=live}}</ref>

While [[NASA]]'s [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']] and [[Pioneer program|''Pioneer'']] probes have traveled into local interstellar space, the purpose of these uncrewed craft was specifically interplanetary, and they are not predicted to reach another star system (although ''[[Voyager 1]]'' will travel to within 1.7 [[light year]]s of [[Gliese 445]] in approximately 40,000 years).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/22783-voyager-1-interstellar-space-star-flyby.html|title=Voyager 1 Has Date with a Star in 40,000 Years|work=Space.com|access-date=2015-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724115732/http://www.space.com/22783-voyager-1-interstellar-space-star-flyby.html|archive-date=2015-07-24|url-status=live}}</ref> Several preliminary designs for starships have been undertaken through [[exploratory engineering]], using [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] with modern technology or technology thought likely to be available in the near future.

==Research==
[[Image:Daedalusschip1.png|thumb|right|Artist's conception of British Interplanetary Society's [[Project Daedalus]] (1978), a fusion powered interstellar probe]]
To travel between stars in a reasonable time using [[rocket]]-like technology requires very high [[effective exhaust velocity]] jet and enormous energy to power this, such as might be provided by [[fusion power]] or [[antimatter]].

There are very few scientific studies that investigate the issues in building a starship. Some examples of this include:

*[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] (1958–1965), mostly manned interplanetary spacecraft
*[[Project Daedalus]] (1973–1978), unmanned interstellar probe
*[[Project Longshot]] (1987–1988), unmanned interstellar probe
*[[Project Icarus (Interstellar Probe Design Study)|Project Icarus]] (2009–2014), unmanned interstellar probe
*[[Hundred-Year Starship]] (2011), manned interstellar craft <!--DARPA study-->

The [[Bussard ramjet]] is an idea to use nuclear fusion of [[interstellar gas]] to provide propulsion.

Examined in an October 1973 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', the [[Enzmann Starship]] proposed using a 12,000-ton ball of frozen [[deuterium]] to power pulse propulsion units. Twice as long as the [[Empire State Building]] and assembled in-orbit, the proposed spacecraft would be part of a larger project preceded by [[interstellar probe]]s and telescopic observation of target star systems.

The NASA [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (1996–2002) was a professional scientific study examining advanced [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems.

==Theoretical types==
A common literary{{clarify|is this section about fictional starships and "literary devices"? or is it about real physics and theoretical possibilites about real starships that might be plausible given physics?, as the section title implies|date=June 2020}} device is to posit a [[faster-than-light]] [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system (such as [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drive]]) or travel through [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], although some starships may be outfitted for centuries-long journeys of slower-than-light travel. Other designs posit a way to boost the ship to near-lightspeed, allowing relatively "quick" travel (i.e. decades, not centuries) to nearer stars. This results in a general categorization{{according to whom|date=June 2020}} of the kinds of starships:{{cn|date=June 2020}}

* [[Sleeper ship|Sleeper]], which put their passengers into [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] during a long trip. This includes [[cryonics]]-based systems that freeze passengers for the duration of the journey.
* [[Generation ship|Generation]], in which the destination would be reached by descendants of the original passengers.
* [[Theory of relativity|Relativistic]], taking advantage of [[time dilation]] at close-to-light-speeds, so long trips will seem much shorter (but still take the same amount of time for outside observers).
* [[Faster-than-light]], which can move between places very quickly (using inter-dimensional shortcuts or [[wormholes]]). There is a theoretical means of achieving FTL (Faster-than-light) travel within our current understanding of physics however; it is also known as a "warp drive" and was introduced by Mexican physicist [[Miguel Alcubierre]] in 1994. The paper, entitled "The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity", showed that space itself could be topographically warped to create a local region of spacetime wherein the region ahead of the "warp bubble" is compressed, allowed to resume normalcy within the bubble, and then rapidly expanded behind the bubble creating an effect that results in apparent FTL travel. His paper showed that all this could be achieved within the pre-established confines of General Relativity, without the introduction of wormholes.<ref> Alcubierre, Miguel https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0009013</ref>

==Fictional examples==
{{main|List of fictional spacecraft#Interstellar}}
There are widely known vessels in various science fiction franchises. The most prominent cultural use and one of the earliest common uses of the term ''starship'' was in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]''.
