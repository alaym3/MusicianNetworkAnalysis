'''Kirill "Kirka" Babitzin''' (22 September 1950 – 31 January 2007) was one of the most commercially successful [[Finnish people|Finnish]] musicians. His career spanned from the late 1960s until his death in 2007.

Previously associated with [[Ilkka Lipsanen]]'s The Islanders band, Kirka went on to record a wide array of rock and pop music. Some of his most famous songs include Hetki Lyö (Beat the Clock), Leijat (Kites) and Varrella virran (Down by the River). His 1988 album Surun Pyyhit Silmistäni (The Sadness in Your Eyes) went on to be one of the best sold records in Finnish history. He also represented Finland in the [[1984 Eurovision Song Contest]].

==Early life==
Kirill Babitzin was born in [[Helsinki]] in 1950 to a Russian family. His father, Leon Babitzin was from [[St. Petersburg]] and fled to Finland in the aftermath of [[the October Revolution]]. His mother, Elizaveta Babitzin (née Zarubina) was partially of [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|German-Russian]] descent and was born in [[Lappeenranta]]. He first got into music at the age of five when his grandmother gave him an [[accordion]]. He won an accordion competition at the age of ten.

== Musical career ==
His first band was ''The Creatures'', which he joined in 1964 assuming stage name Kirka.

Kirka began attaining fame  when he joined the band ''The Islanders'' in 1967. Originally led by [[Ilkka Lipsanen|Ilkka "Danny" Lipsanen]], the band became hugely popular. Kirka also recorded with [[Blues Section]]. Kirka used his fame to launch into a solo career soon-after. Kirka cited his 1960's breakthrough ''Hetki lyö'' (orig. ''Beat The Clock'' composed by [[Richard Gottehrer|Gottehrer]]-Stroll, a 1968 ''Elfstone'' B side) with The Islanders as his greatest achievement. Despite his initial success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kirka suffered from money-troubles through the late 1970s.

Kirka represented Finland in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984]], finishing a strong ninth with the song ''Hengaillaan''. Four years later, he got his greatest chart success with ''Surun pyyhit silmistäin'', a melancholic [[schlager|pop-schlager]]. True to his rock'n'roll roots, however, he never fully appreciated this success, repeatedly

Babitzin was awarded the [[Emma-gaala|Emma award]] for best male singer twice, first in 1984 and then in 2000. He died suddenly on 31 January 2007 at his home of undisclosed acute illness. His widow Paula Nummela is a jewellery designer.

==Family==
Several Babitzin siblings are established musicians in their own right. In 1978, Kirka released a duet album with sister [[Anna Babitzin|Anna]]; the next year, another sister Marija ("[[Muska]]") joined in.

Kirka's brother was popular rock musician [[Sammy Babitzin]], who was killed in a car crash in 1973. Sammy's signature hit ''Daada daada'' tells a story of high-speed automotive cruising.

==Discography==
Kirka Babitzin released 78 singles and almost 60 albums, including 15 collections. Kirka's album ''Surun pyyhit silmistäni'' (1988) became the biggest selling album in Finnish history; it has now been relegated to all-time third place.
