==Early life==
Simco was born on January 29, 1982, in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], to Anita Isaacs, a maid, and Ronald Simco, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran with severe [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], who worked various jobs, including as a police officer and [[Walmart]] manager.<ref name="laweekly5">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/09/riff_raff_real_story.php|title=Becoming Riff Raff: How a White Suburban Kid Morphed Into Today's Most Enigmatic Rapper|newspaper=LA Weekly|first=Ben|last=Westhoof|date=September 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140129232811/http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2013/09/riff_raff_real_story.php|archive-date=January 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/09/aap-rocky-riff-raff-come-together-hilarious-interview/ |title=Watch Part Two Of A$AP Rocky & Riff Raff's Hilarious Interview - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=September 19, 2013 |access-date=September 23, 2013}}</ref><ref name="familysearch">{{cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VDYJ-FD3|title=Personal Details for Horst Christian Simco|publisher=FamilySearch|date=December 5, 2014}}</ref> His mother grew up in [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]], descending from a family of [[History of the Jews in Germany|German]] and [[History of the Jews in Lithuania|Lithuanian]] Jews that included several survivors and victims of the [[Holocaust]].<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-weird-world-of-riff-raff-20131008?page=2 |title=Inside Riff Raff's Weird World &#124; Music News |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=April 27, 2014}}</ref> Riff Raff was the second of four siblings. He and his family lived in [[Copperfield, Texas|Copperfield]], a suburb 25 miles northwest of Houston. Growing up he was obsessed with basketball, playing frequently with other children in his neighborhood. By the middle of the decade, the Simcos had moved to nearby Stone Creek. He attended [[Langham Creek High School]], where he was [[shooting guard]] on his school's basketball team, before dropping out in his senior year.<ref name="laweekly5" /> Shortly thereafter he obtained his [[GED]].<ref name="rollingstone.com"/>

After his parents divorced, his father was diagnosed with tonsil cancer and the family moved to [[Duluth, Minnesota]] to get his father out of the heat into a cooler environment. For a time, Riff Raff and his siblings were shuttled back and forth between Duluth and Houston, where their mother remained. In 2001, he enrolled at [[Hibbing Community College]] in [[Hibbing, Minnesota]], where he played on the basketball team for a month and majored in liberal arts.<ref name="laweekly5" /><ref name="rollingstone.com"/> Feeling out of place, he dropped out in 2003 and moved back to Houston, where he painted cars in the in-vogue "candy-colored" style and gradually built his new identity.<ref name="laweekly5" /> He eventually relocated to Los Angeles and began to take his rapping career seriously.<ref name="laweekly"/>

==Musical career==
===2008–2009: Beginnings===
Riff Raff started rapping in 2005, making homemade CDs of his rapping over other artists' beats, and passing them out at various malls in the [[Greater Houston Area]] including [[Katy Mills Mall]]. He credited his early influences being Texas veteran rappers [[Devin the Dude]] and [[Paul Wall]].<ref name="rollingstone.com"/> Riff Raff took advantage of social media on [[Myspace]], [[YouTube]] and [[WorldStarHipHop]] in late 2008, releasing songs, freestyle-videos, and sketch clips, which showcased his talent as [[slapstick]] and [[performance art]]. He did this with the help of his first talent manager, DB da Boss, whose studio provided recording and video services. DB spoke with ''LA Weekly'' about the rapper, saying "He was very driven, very ambitious. You couldn't deny his work ethic", going on to say, "Underneath that shell is a very intelligent man."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/becoming-riff-raff-how-a-white-suburban-kid-morphed-into-todays-most-enigmatic-rapper-4168686|title=Becoming Riff Raff: How a White Suburban Kid Morphed Into Today's Most Enigmatic Rapper|last=Westhoff|first=Ben|date=September 10, 2013|work=L.A. Weekly|access-date=June 28, 2018}}</ref> He looked up to Northside Houston rappers from label [[Swishahouse]], who were blowing up around that time, including Paul Wall, [[Chamillionaire]] and [[Slim Thug]]. He began doing his hair up in braids popular among "Northsiders" like Slim Thug and shopping for bling at TV Jewelry, a store co-owned by Paul Wall and charismatic Vietnamese immigrant "TV" [[Johnny Dang]], from whom Riff Raff also purchased gold grills. Like many other artists from Houston, Riff Raff also spent much of his time selling CDs at colleges and malls, occasionally alongside other local talent such at Fat Tony and Freestyle Bully.<ref name="laweekly5" />

In an effort to get on television he went on many auditions, including for a part in a peanut butter commercial intended for a teenager. He and his friend also tried out for [[P. Diddy]]'s ''[[Making the Band]]'', to no avail. He was so determined to become famous that he flew to [[Atlanta]] to try out for [[MTV]]'s reality show ''[[From G's to Gents]]''. When he learned that he had made the cast for the [[From G's to Gents (season 2)|program's second season]], before taping had even begun, he immediately got a giant MTV logo tattooed on his neck and adjusted his stage name to "MTV Riff Raff". Though he was eliminated from the series on the second episode, he left an impression on viewers through his extravagant way of dressing and funny ad-libs.<ref name="laweekly5"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/08/seven-embarrassing-incidents-of-rappers-caught-on-camera-before-they-were-famous/7/ |title=Seven Embarrassing Incidents Rappers Had Before They Were Famous - Page 7 of 8 - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=August 8, 2013 |access-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|author=Artist Biography by David Jeffries |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mtv-riff-raff-mn0002915904/biography |title=MTV Riff Raff &#124; Biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=September 23, 2013}}</ref> Upon the season's debut in early 2009, appearance on the show would garner an immediate reaction to him, which catapulted his career.<ref name="laweekly5"/>

The same year actor, comedian and rapper [[Simon Rex]] noticed Riff Raff after being shown to him by notable producer [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]]. Rex contacted Riff Raff after watching one of his freestyle videos in which he revealed his phone number, and soon enough the two became friends and began recording as Riff Raff and Dirt Nasty.<ref name="laweekly5" /> The pair later formed a rap group [[Three Loco]] along with comedian [[Andy Milonakis]], increasing Riff Raff's popularity by tapping into the two celebrities' fan bases.<ref name="laweekly5" /><ref name="allmusic1"/>

===2010–2012: SODMG, Mad Decent, various mixtapes===
Beginning in 2011, Riff Raff began to be managed by [[OG Ron C]] (of [[Swishahouse]] fame) and moved to Los Angeles.<ref name="laweekly5"/> Riff Raff then started releasing more music videos that furthered the artist's internet fame. Those include songs such as "Jose Canseco",<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.thefader.com/2011/06/28/video-riff-raff-sodmg-jose-canseco/|title=Video: Riff Raff SODMG, "Jose Canseco"|magazine=The Fader|first=Duncan|last=Cooper|date=June 28, 2011}}</ref> and "Marc Jacobs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vladtv.com/blog/119149/riff-raff-marc-jacobs-music-video/|title=Riff Raff – "Marc Jacobs" (Music Video)|publisher=VLAD TV|date=September 3, 2012}}</ref> Then in mid-2011, Riff Raff signed to Soulja Boy's label [[S.O.D.

However, Riff Raff still wore the imprint's chain, got its logo tattooed, and again adjusted his stage name, this time to Riff Raff SODMG.<ref name="laweekly5"/> They would remain affiliated for around a year, but the label did not push or pay Riff Raff, which would result in him leaving the label. Soulja Boy publicly called Riff Raff a "cokehead" following their split.<ref name="laweekly5"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2012/06/riff-raff-talks-beef-with-soulja-boy/ |title=Riff Raff Talks Beef With Soulja Boy - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=June 19, 2012 |access-date=September 23, 2013}}</ref>

==''Spring Breakers'' controversy==
On February 15, 2012, film director [[Harmony Korine]] contacted Riff Raff about appearing in an upcoming movie of his, which would turn out to be ''[[Spring Breakers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/07/riff-raff-speaks-on-spring-breakers-lawsuit-what-hed-do-with-10-million/ |title=RiFF RaFF Speaks On 'Spring Breakers' Lawsuit, What He'd Do With $10 Million - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=July 19, 2013 |access-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref> Once the details of the movie came out, there was speculation that the main character Alien was based on Riff Raff.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/james-franco-play-riff-raff-upcoming-harmony-korine-film|title=James Franco to Play Riff Raff in Upcoming Harmony Korine Film|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|first=Stephanie|last=Long|date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> However, according to [[James Franco]], his character was based on the underground rap artist Dangeruss. He said "Of course Harmony and I looked at some of Riff Raff's videos as inspiration, but he was one of a number of people we looked at. I would say the biggest influence on the role was this local Florida rapper named Dangeruss. He's fairly unknown, but he was down there in the place, living the life, and he became the biggest model for me, and he's in the movie."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.gq.com/style/blogs/the-gq-eye/2012/05/last-nighttalking-cornrows-with-james-franco.html|title=Last Night...Talking Cornrows with James Franco|magazine=[[GQ]]}}</ref>
