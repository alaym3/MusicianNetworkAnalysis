RBD <small>(abbreviation for "ReBelDe")</small> formed on October 30, 2004, which followed the premiere of the Mexican telenovela ''[[Rebelde (Mexican telenovela)|Rebelde]]''. The members were  [[Anahí]], [[Alfonso Herrera]], [[Dulce María]], [[Christopher von Uckermann]], [[Maite Perroni]] and [[Christian Chávez]]. The band released their debut single, "[[Rebelde (song)|Rebelde]]", exactly one month before the group officially formed. Their debut album [[Rebelde (album)|of the same name]] was released on November 11, 2004, by [[EMI]]. All four singles from the album were number-one hits in Mexico.

''Rebelde''  sold well in the United States, reaching number 95 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number two on the [[Latin Albums]] chart. In July 2005, a live CD/DVD, [[Tour Generación RBD En Vivo]], was released. The CD/DVD documented their tour around Mexico that included 45 sold-out concerts across the country, including sixteen in Mexico City. In Spain, ''Rebelde'' spent five weeks on the top of the charts and was certified 3× Platinum for having sold over 240,000 copies.

With the success of the telenovela, the group used the hiatus between the first and second season to release their second album ''[[Nuestro Amor]]'', on September 22, 2005. This album included twelve songs plus "Una Canción", a live recording, and "Liso, Sensual", a studio version of the song previously performed on their last tour. The album set new record sales in Mexico, selling 127,000 copies on its release day and 160,000 copies in its first week. In the U.S., the album topped the Latin Albums chart for three weeks and peaked at number 88 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The first four singles reached number one in Mexico. In the U.S., "[[Nuestro Amor (song)|Nuestro Amor]]", "[[Aún hay algo]]" and "[[Este corazón]]" charted on the [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart at numbers six, 24 and 10, respectively. ''Nuestro Amor'' was certified 2× Platinum in Spain. In November 2005, a Portuguese version of their debut album was released, titled ''[[Rebelde (Edição Brasil)]]''.

===2006–2007: ''Celestial'' and ''Rebels'' ===
In early 2006, the group went on tour across the United States for the first time, which was recorded and released as a CD/DVD in April 2006, titled ''[[Live in Hollywood (RBD album)|Live in Hollywood]]''. It peaked at number six on the Latin Albums chart. Since that year, former singer [[Lynda Thomas]], who had been uncredited with the group since their debut, officially became a recurring contributor for them. The first song credited to her was "[[No pares|No Pares]]", performed by Dulce María.

In May 2006, the group released a Portuguese version of ''Nuestro Amor'', titled ''[[Nosso Amor Rebelde]]'', targeted for the Brazilian market. ''Nosso Amor Rebelde'' is their second album in Portuguese, released only in Brazil. The album contains Portuguese versions of 11 songs from ''Nuestro Amor''. The album, however, did not have a full week of album sales because of its Friday release. Despite this, it became their first album to peak or chart in the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003465594 |title=First (and only) debut within top 20 |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=August 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027114447/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003465594 |archive-date=October 27, 2012 }}</ref> RBD was nominated for the [[Latin Grammy Awards]] in 2006 in the category [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Album by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Pop Album by a Group or Duo]] for ''Nuestro Amor''.

=== 2008–2009: ''Empezar Desde Cero'' and ''Para Olvidarte De Mí'' ===
On March 2, 2007, Chávez revealed he is [[gay]] after pictures were discovered of him marrying another man in Canada. In a letter on the group's website, he asked fans for understanding and acceptance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grupo-rbd.com/static/ChristianChavezEN.htm |title=Christian reveals sexuality |publisher=Grupo-rbd.com |access-date=August 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225150926/http://www.grupo-rbd.com/static/ChristianChavezEN.htm |archive-date=December 25, 2010  }}</ref> After this, the group worked two side-projects; ''Sálvame'', an organization that helps homeless youth get an education and shelter, and ''[[RBD: La Familia]]'', their new sitcom. The group was nominated four times in three categories for the 2007 [[Billboard Latin Music Awards]].

In early 2007, the group began to rehearse for their upcoming concert tour called ''Tour Celestial'', which started in Ecuador on April 20, 2007. On May 28, 2007, [[Donald Trump]] invited the group to perform three songs at the [[Miss Universe 2007]] finals in Mexico City. They performed a [[Medley (music)|medley]] of "Wanna Play", "Cariño Mio" and "Money Money" at the event. In June 2007, the group recorded the accompanying [[music video]] for their single "Bésame sin miedo" in [[Transylvania]] while on tour in Romania where ''Celestial'' was released. It was the same year they were chosen to headline a series of [[Pepsi]] commercials with [[The Black Eyed Peas]] to air in [[South America]] and Spanish-speaking countries. On July 19, 2007, the group performed "Bésame sin miedo" at the Premios Juventud 2007 ceremony and won seven awards that night, including "Voice of the Moment" and "Favorite Concert". RBD broke the record for most albums in the top 20 in Brazil, having three different albums in the top 20 for the week ending January 20, 2007. Their single "[[Tu Amor (Jon B. song)#RBD version|Tu amor]]" was nominated for Best International Song in France. In an interview in Mexico, Christopher von Uckermann stated that it has always been an honor to be compared to [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]] and [[Timbiriche]], but mentioned that RBD surpassed those groups by accomplishing much more in only five years, being the only Mexican group to gain worldwide fame.

The first worldwide "RBD Day" was held on October 4, 2007. The group celebrated the day with fans in Houston, Texas. During their press conference, they confirmed that their fifth album would be titled ''[[Empezar Desde Cero]]'', produced by Carlos Lara and Armando Ávila. The first single from ''Empezar Desde Cero'', "[[Inalcanzable (song)|Inalcanzable]]", debuted in October 2007 and peaked at number two on Mexican charts. ''Empezar Desde Cero'' was released on November 20, debuting at number one on the ''Billboard'' Latin Albums chart and peaking within the top-ten in a variety of countries such as Brazil (their first album that did not top the charts in that country, peaking at number three) and Mexico. As of November 2008, ''Empezar Desde Cero'' had sold over a million copies worldwide. It was voted by ''Billboard'' readers as the third best album released in 2007.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090423000832/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/yearend/2007/readers/index.html "2007 Billboard Readers Choice"].

On August 14, 2008, they released a compilation album of their greatest hits titled ''RBD The Best Of''. 

On August 15, 2008, the group announced through a press release that they would disband in 2009.<ref name="Comunicado de RBD">[http://www2.esmas.com/rbd/fotos/comunicado-rbd/9543 Comunicado official] Retrieved August 12, 2009.</ref>  The group's manager, [[Pedro Damián]], explained that although there wasn't any fights among the members, it was best that they should disband for the ones who were already planning different solo activities. Herrera and Perroni were occupied with their television projects (the former with the TV series ''Terminales,'' and the latter as the protagonist of ''[[Cuidado con el ángel|Cuidado Con El Ángel]]''). Chávez was in the middle of a tour with the musical ''[[Avenue Q]]'''s Mexican stage production, and was planning to build his career as a solo artist, actor and producer. Anahí managed her own clothing store in Mexico City and began an organization to help those who have [[eating disorder]]s. Dulce María was involved with shooting a film "Alguién a visto a Lupita" and a variety of projects, such as dubbing a cartoon character in a Mexican film. Later, Uckermann starred in the TV show ''Kdabra'', produced by [[Fox Networks Group|Fox]] in Colombia. On November 25, RBD released ''[[Best Of (RBD album)|Best Of]]'' (in Brazil: ''Hits Em Português''; in the United States: ''Greatest Hits''), which was a CD/DVD that features their singles and a DVD with music videos as part of their goodbye. A Portuguese version of the album was also released.

''[[Para Olvidarte De Mí]]'' (2009) was the sixth and final album to be released by the group. The album is preceded by the only single "Para Olvidarte De Mí". On December 2, 2009, the live concert DVD, ''[[Tournée do Adeus]]'', recorded in [[São Paulo]] was released, containing the group's last show in Brazil.

=== 2020: Social networks, streaming relaunch and ''Ser O Parecer Virtual Concert'' ===
After years with the music of RBD out of online streaming platforms (after Universal Music bought EMI), in August 2020 the former members announced on their social media that their six studio albums and the Brazilian versions would be available in all streaming services on September 3, 2020. In that day, it was also announced that the albums will be available in stores 

To celebrate the launch of their music on streaming, the group announced a virtual show that took place on December 26 and reunited 4 of the original members, Anahí, Maite Perroni, Christian Chavez and Christopher von Uckermann. Alfonso Herrera and Dulce Maria did not take part in the reunion, with the latter confirming that she couldn't join because of her pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seroparecer.world/ |title=RBD - Ser o Parecer |publisher=seroparecer.world |access-date=October 4, 2020}}</ref>

A week of snippets on the band's [[Instagram]] account teasing a new song followed soon after. On Tuesday, November 17 "Siempre He Estado Aquí" was released simultaneously in all streaming platforms. The group created a TikTok challenge for the song. An animated music video was released on December 3 on the group's YouTube channel.

==Documentary about the group ==
In late 2012, Pedro Damián told Televisa that the group would return to the stage in 2013. According to Damián, the project was to do something amazing and interesting, "Let's talk to them. Let's convince them to do something amazing, something interesting." He stated he was determined to revive the group and would be chatting with members and try to convince them to reunite. Following Damián's statements, Dulce María said in an interview with Televisa that it was too early for a comeback; however, she did not rule out the possibility of ever doing a reunion with her former group members. "I do not know about the future," she stated in the interview, "but right now there's no way. Each of us are focused on his or her career. It's still very early. But never say never." Around the same time, in an interview for [[MTV]] Brasil, Christian Chávez said it was possible for a reunion in 2014, which was confirmed by Damián. On July 27, 2013, however, there was no official statement from Dulce María, Herrera, Uckermann, Anahí, or Perroni of this occurring or a set date.

With resistance from some members, Damián decided to develop a documentary about the group in celebration of the sextet's 10 year anniversary. In an interview with Televisa, Damián said he will have something more concrete on the project later in the year, "I have something like 800 hours of recordings&nbsp;... We are already working."

''Tour Celestial'' is RBD's second tour where they performed in Latin America, the U.S., and Europe. On June 22, 2007, RBD filmed their concert in [[Madrid, Spain]] with over 40.000 in attendance for a DVD called ''[[Hecho en España (DVD)|Tour Celestial 2007: Hecho en España]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esmas.com/rbd/noticias/639662.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222012117/http://www.esmas.com/rbd/noticias/639662.html |archive-date=February 22, 2008 |title=::RBD:: Sitio Oficial-Noticias |publisher=Esmas.com |access-date=August 4, 2012}}</ref>

In early October, it was confirmed by Roptus.com that the rest of the tour would be postponed until further notice. The reason the website gave for these actions was that RBD wants to give their audience a much well-deserved show by performing some songs off their new album, ''[[Empezar desde Cero]]'', which was released on November 20, 2007. RBD grossed $5,400,000 on North American shows and a combined total of 293,742 tickets worldWide.

== Legacy ==
RBD was one of the most important phenomenons of Latin pop culture in the 2000s despite their short transition into the music scene. The cultural phenomenon led by the soap opera ''[[Rebelde (Mexican telenovela)|Rebelde]]'' and the pop group, accompanied by advertising strategies from 2004 to 2009, resulted in recognition from a young audience who followed the career of the group, leaving a legacy of six studio albums, two TV ''s''eries and multiple awards.<ref>{{cite news |title=RBD graba nueva serie en México |url= http://www.peopleenespanol.com/article/rbd-graba-nueva-serie-en-mexico |access-date= February 13, 2014 |work=[[People en Español]] |date=October 25, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://los40.com/los40/2018/02/22/cinetv/1519311785_800799.html|title=El creador de 'Rebelde' trabaja en una nueva versión de la serie|last=LOS40|date=February 22, 2018|website=LOS40|language=es|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvynovelas.com/mx/tv-y-novelas/rbd-rebelde-5-mejores-canciones-telenovela/|title=Las 5 mejores canciones de RBD|date=September 23, 2018|website=TVyNovelas México|language=es-MX|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elobservatodo.cl/noticia/sociedad/rbd-el-regreso-la-banda-prepara-su-reencuentro-luego-de-seis-anos|title=RBD el regreso, la banda prepara su reencuentro luego de seis años|website=El Observatodo.cl, Noticias de La Serena y Coquimbo|language=es|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref> On March 2, 2007, photos of Chávez marrying a Canadian BJ Murphy were leaked, and the singer spoke about this in a statement, officially coming out.

== Fundación Sálvame ==
In February 2006, thousands of RBD fans in Brazil attended an event where the six members signed merchandise and performed some of their songs. After the event concluded, a white van that was thought to contain the group was spotted leaving the area. Due to this, thousands of people ran in excitement and in the commotion, 43 people were injured and three others were killed. Later during their Celestial tour, the group spoke about the incident and stated "It is something that struck us all. No one would tell us what happened until we were on our way back to Mexico, and to know that your fans were killed at your event is a horrible feeling because you think 'Wow, they were there to see me and because of that they’re gone now' it’s such an indescribable feeling and we can’t explain how heartbroken we are". The group later confirmed they had met and spoken with the families of the victims.<ref>[http://www.surnoticias.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2636 RBD crea fundación ''Salvame''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105183020/http://surnoticias.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2636 |date=January 5, 2010 }} Retrieved August 12, 2009</ref>
