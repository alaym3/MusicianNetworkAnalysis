In 1988, the [[RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg|RTL TV]] channel in Luxembourg invited Fabian to represent the country at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|33rd Eurovision Song Contest]], held that year in [[Dublin]], Ireland.

The album went gold in 1993, and platinum the following year. The success of upbeat [[Dance-pop]] singles such as "Le jour où tu partira", "Les murs", and "Qui pense à l'amour" gave Fabian radio exposure. She received several nominations at the 1993 ''ADISQ awards'', and a poll{{by whom|date=May 2017}} published around that time voted her Québec's most promising singer.

===1994–1996: Breakthrough album: ''Carpe diem''===
{{See also|Carpe diem (Lara Fabian album)}}
Constant touring in [[Québec]] helped Fabian's 1994 album ''[[Carpe diem (Lara Fabian album)|Carpe diem]]'' become her breakthrough album. The album went ''Gold'' three weeks after its release, and spawned three hit singles: "Tu t'en vas", "Si tu m'aimes", and "Leïla". The following year, the album went triple platinum.

Fabian received two [[Félix Award|Félix]] awards at the 1995 ADISQ gala: Best Show Of The Year and Best Female Singer Of The Year (a category that is voted for by the public).

In 1996, [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Walt Disney Studios]] hired Fabian as the voice of the character of Esmeralda in the Canadian French version of the animated feature ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.

''Pure'' sold more than two million copies in France; the album went platinum in less than two weeks, and spawned several hit singles: "Tout", "Je t'aime", "Humana", each of which sold more than a million copies, and the anti-[[homophobia]] anthem "La Différence". The album won a [[Félix Award|Félix]] for Popular Album of the Year at the 1997 [[ADISQ]] gala and was nominated for two [[Juno Award]]s in the Best Selling French Album category, and for Fabian as Best Female Singer.

In December, she was named as Revelation of the Year by [[Paris Match]], which put her on its cover to mark this occasion.

In March 1999, Fabian released her first live album, named ''[[Live 1999 (Lara Fabian album)|Live]]'', which debuted at #1 on the French charts. This helped seal an international recording contract with [[Sony]] Music. In May 1999, Fabian was honoured at the ''[[World Music Awards]]'' in Monaco, where she received Best Selling Record for the Year 1998 for her album ''Pure''.  In July 1999, with over six million records already sold across Europe, Polydor rereleased Fabian's [[Lara Fabian (French album)|self-titled debut album]].

In Europe, the single "Adagio" charted at #5 on the French singles chart and #3 on the Belgian singles chart.

During this period, Fabian recorded songs for several Hollywood motion picture soundtracks, including "The Dream Within" for the ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' soundtrack, and "For Always" for the ''[[A.I. (movie)|AI:Artificial Intelligence]]'' soundtrack, which contained both a solo version and a duet with [[Josh Groban]].

===2001–2003: ''O Canada 2001'' and return to French roots: ''Nue'', ''Live 2002'' and ''En toute intimité''===
{{See also|Nue (Lara Fabian album)|Live 2002 (Lara Fabian album)|En Toute Intimité (Lara Fabian album)}}
''[[Nue (Lara Fabian album)|Nue]]'' (Naked), Fabian's fourth French album, was released in the Fall of 2001 in both Québec and France. ''Nue'' is a documentation of her emotional ride in the years since success of the previous album.  The album reached #1 in Belgium and #2 in France but had little impact in Québec. The album was also released in Portugal and reached the top 10 on the album charts during the Fall of 2001.

The first single, released in the summer of 2001, was the anthem "J'y crois encore" was a top 20 French hit.  Other singles followed, including "Immortelle", "Aimer Déjà" and in 2002 "[[Tu es mon autre]]" (a duet with fellow Belgian, [[Maurane]] which was nominated for song of the year and reached the top 5 in France).

Also in 2001, she collaborated with [[David Foster]] and the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]] to record the Canadian national anthem, ''[[O Canada]]'', in an English version, a French version, and a bilingual (French/English) version, for a promotion of the Government of Canada.

In 2002, Fabian contributed to the ''World Soccer Championship'' CD release, with the song ''World at Your Feet'' written and produced by [[Gary Barlow]].

Towards the end of 2002, Fabian released her second live album, ''[[Live 2002 (Lara Fabian album)|Live 2002]]'', from her latest tour, together with a DVD showcasing concerts recorded in December 2001 in Belgium at the Forest National and at [[Le Zénith]] in Paris.

Her 2003 stint at the Casino de Paris every Monday night consisted of concerts to small audiences which were released as a live CD and DVD at the end of 2003, under the title ''[[En Toute Intimité (Lara Fabian album)|En toute intimité]]''.

===2004: Second English language release: ''A Wonderful Life''===
{{See also|A Wonderful Life (Lara Fabian album)}}
In 2004, Fabian released her second English album, ''[[A Wonderful Life (Lara Fabian album)|A Wonderful Life]]''.

The project was commercially unsuccessful but critically praised.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The more organic sound on the album is attributed to the work of French guitarist [[Jean-Félix Lalanne]], and producers [[Desmond Child]], [[Anders Bagge]] and the British team True North (composed of Take That singer [[Gary Barlow]] and [[Elliot John Kennedy]]).  "Review My Kisses", written by Desmond Child, was first recorded by [[LeAnn Rimes]] in 2002 for her album ''Twisted Angel''.

The first single released for radio was "The Last Goodbye" in the US and a number of other countries (except France). In France, the song "No Big Deal" was the first single.  Neither of the songs achieved success and the album was not promoted; and its release was canceled in the United States.

In Brazil, the song "I Guess I Loved You" achieved moderate success when included on a soap opera entitled "[[Senhora do Destino]]" (Her own Destiny), a well-known Brazilian television series. The song also gained some popularity in Portugal, for the same reason, though it was never officially released or promoted.

===2005–2006: A new musical direction: ''9'' and ''Un Regard 9''===
{{See also|9 (Lara Fabian album)|Un regard 9 Live}}
After a sabbatical in 2004, Fabian returned to the music scene spring of 2005 with her fifth French album, ''[[9 (Lara Fabian album)|9]]''.  The album is performed in a new style, with smoothness, serenity and joy, a departure from the deep, dramatic style of earlier recordings.

''9'' yielded the hit single "La Lettre", a song co-written with her new partner, [[Jean-Félix Lalanne]], with whom she produced the album's 11 tracks.  Other singles released included "Ne lui parlez plus d'elle", "Un Ave Maria", "Il ne manquait que toi" and the gospel-infused "L'homme qui n'avait pas de maison".

In October 2006, Fabian released a CD and DVD of this associated tour, both titled ''[[Un regard 9 Live]]'' and recorded during the concert of March 29, 2006, at [[Le Zénith]] in Paris.  The CD presents 15 live performances and a new song, "Aime", recorded in a studio in [[Montreal]], Quebec.

===2006–2007: An Italian collaboration and live concerts in Europe===
In June 2007 Fabian worked in Rome and Los Angeles to record tracks for her next studio album.

In the meantime, the single "Un Cuore Malato" (with [[Gigi D'Alessio]]) reached the top of the Italian charts and #16 in France.

In Los Angeles, Fabian worked with [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] on a multilingual album, reputed to include songs in English, Spanish, French, Italian, and a few other languages.  This album was planned for release in late 2008.{{update after|2008|12|31}}

Also in 2007, Fabian was in Québec to perform a two night concert at the Olympia de Montreal. In October she was a surprise guest a concert Gigi D'Alessio gave in France at the Olympia in Paris. Soon after, her daughter was born.

===2009: Return to the music scene: ''Toutes les femmes en moi''===
{{See also|Toutes les femmes en moi}}
A few months after her daughter's birth, Fabian carried out a tour of Ukraine, Russia and Greece.  She also made a few TV appearances (such as 60th Anniversary of Israel where Fabian performed a Hebrew song and duetted with Israeli singer [[Achinoam Nini|Noa]]).

During 2008, Fabian was in Belgium preparing to record a French album with pianist [[Mark Herskowitz]]. The album, ''[[Toutes les femmes en moi]]'', was partly recorded in Montreal, and was released in May 2009. The first single, [[Soleil, Soleil]], is a cover of the [[Nana Mouskouri]] song. The second single was ''Toutes les Femmes en moi'', the only original song on the album.

===2010: "Tour Les Femmes Font Leur Show", ''Mademoiselle Zhivago''===

Throughout the first half of 2010, Fabian embarked on a European tour of concerts, throughout France, Switzerland, and Belgium, incorporating the main repertoire of her last album "Toutes Les Femmes En Moi" along with some classic and fan favorites. She also performed again in Eastern Europe, with a more acoustic set (piano-voice), and included English recordings from the album Every Woman in Me. 
In September 2010, she finally released her 2009 album "Toutes Les Femmes En Moi" in Québec. She also recorded the album "Nuit Magique" with Canadian singer Coral Egan.

Later in 2010, Fabian released a concept album in Russia and Ukraine called ''[[Mademoiselle Zhivago]]'' which has sold over 800.000 copies in Russia. It features 11 songs in different languages by Russian composer [[Igor Krutoy]]. It features stories about a woman who experiences several lives over the years and centuries. Eleven music videos, one each song, were combined to create a full-length film, produced and directed by Ukrainian film producer [[Alan Badoev]].  The album itself, containing a CD and a DVD, was first released in Ukraine in October 2010 and in Russia in November.

The whole set of songs composed by Fabian with Igor Krutoy is in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Russian. She first introduced one of these songs in 2009 during the New Wave Festival in Latvia, performing "Demain n'existe pas". Later, in 2010, she returned to that same stage performing new songs from the already finalized project. She has been promoting this project in both countries both on television and by performing a series of concerts presenting the new songs live to the eastern European public. She has since established herself as a superstar in Russia and Ukraine. Fabian was a guest performer on the show of October 30 of the Ukrainian X Factor, singing "Mademoiselle Hyde" and "Demain N'Existe Pas", taken from the album and also her longtime classic "Adagio".

In 2012 she sang "Ma Solitude", a duet with Greek singer [[George Perris]], on his album [[Un Souhait]].

===2013: "Deux ils, Deux elles" and "Le Secret"===
Fabian released her new album ''[[Le Secret (album)|Le Secret]]'' on April 15, 2013, which consists of 17 brand new songs. On the same day of the album release she showcased her new songs at the [[Théâtre de Paris]]. Her first single is "[[Deux ils, Deux elles]]", released February 20, 2013. The song talks about the love between two men and two women, speaks about tolerance and [[Straight ally|acceptance]] of the [[LGBT community]] – just like her previous song "[[La Différence]]".

===2014: "Make Me Yours Tonight" / "Al Götür Beni"===
Planned tour dates in early 2014 were cancelled and recording delayed while Fabian recovered from ear damage.<ref name=malade>[http://www.leparisien.fr/loisirs-et-spectacles/malade-lara-fabian-annule-la-fin-de-sa-tournee-20-01-2014-3512527.php "Malade, Lara Fabian annule sa tournée"].
