==Career==
Elderbrook first ventured into music at the age of 16. He began playing as member of an [[Independent music|indie]] band, before at nineteen switching to a singer-songwriter. During an interview with [[Red Bull]], he stated it was a "folky acoustic thing" part of his career. He then attended university, where he says he was first exposed to quality electronic dance music and subsequently began listening to various dance genres.<ref name=redbull>{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=Bella|title=5 things you should know about Elderbrook|url=https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/essential-facts-about-elderbrook-and-a-remix-premiere|publisher=[[Red Bull]]|date=9 September 2015}}</ref>

Before moving into the [[electronic music]] genre, he wanted to pursue a more [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and soulful sound with his distinct vocals.<ref name=redbull />

Kotz began to use the moniker Elderbrook after finishing university and debuted with the track and EP of the same name, Could. His debut [[extended play]] featured a number of tracks that went on to garner over a million views on [[SoundCloud]] and similar platforms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elderbrook|url=https://soundcloud.com/elderbrook|publisher=SoundCloud}}</ref> The EP featured three tracks, ''Could, Rewinding'' and ''How Many Times''. All three tracks received positive reviews, with the latter becoming Elderbrook's first major hit.

Elderbrook first major inroads into the music industry when he collaborated with the German duo, Andhim. The track was a reworked version of the original ''How Many Times'' from Elderbrook's first EP. The track received positive reviews throughout the music industry. It was released in mid-2015, becoming a dance classic and pushing Elderbrook's name out into the wider dance music genre. ''[[Mixmag]]'' were one of the most complimentary of the collaboration, giving the track 8/10.<ref name=mixmag>{{cite magazine|title=Elderbrook X andhim Review|url=http://mixmag.net/read/elderbrook-x-andhim-reviews|magazine=[[Mixmag]]}}</ref> It also went onto be listed as one of ''Mixmag''{{'}}s top tracks for 2015.

Following the success of his first EP, he released a second in the same year. ''Travel Slow'' contained three tracks, "Be There Soon", "Good Enough" and "Travel Slow".<ref>{{cite web|title=Travel Slow EP|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/travel-slow-single/1013295322?app=music&ign-itsct=1013295322-1013295322&ign-itscg=0177&ign-mpt=uo%3D4|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]}}</ref> While working on his first two EP's he also became heavily involved in remixing. He released a number of well-known remixes of songs which performed well on various ''Billboard'' charts. One of the most notable during 2015 was Pablo Nouvelle's "Take Me to a Place".<ref name=redbull />

During 2016, Elderbrook toured and supported a number of well-known acts. One of the main acts he worked with during 2016, was [[Gorgon City]].

In 2017, Elderbrook announced his first tour of the UK, where he sold out XOYO and Oval Space in London. Elderbrook shot to commercial fame when he collaborated with [[CamelPhat]]. The song they produced was titled "[[Cola (CamelPhat and Elderbrook song)|Cola]]", and went onto become one of the biggest selling song globally in 2017. It was co-written by British electronic house duo CamelPhat, with Elderbrook on vocals. The lyrics over the top of an [[electro house]] beat, follow a woman's night out, involving mixing various drinks involving [[Coca-Cola]]. The song performed well during the summer months as a club anthem in many places throughout Europe and the United States, before becoming a chart single later in the year.

The song received critical acclaim during November 2017, when it reached number one on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Dance Club Songs]] chart when it entered the charts on 11 November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/dance-club-play-songs/2017-11-11|title=Hot Dance Club Songs – November 11, 2017|work=Billboard|date=31 October 2017|access-date=31 October 2017}}</ref> The song also reached number one on the [[UK Independent Singles and Albums Charts|UK Indie chart]] during November 2017.

==Musical style==
He is known for his versatility as a musician, as he is recognised as a multi-instrumentalist. He has taken influences from country and soul to rock and gospel, classically trained in both piano and guitar. His production techniques follow his ambition to "make some I haven't heard before". He has been known to sample unique sounds such as the breaking of reading glasses and crackling ice in a warm coffee. He also stated in an interview that he would "often bang the table I’m sat at, sample it and use that as my drums".

Following the release of his first single on the label Black Butter, Elderbrook's vocals were complimented by ''Mixmag'', describing them as flawless.<ref name=mixmag /> When speaking about his style of production, Elderbrook stated "phonetics are as important as lyrics. My voice adds another important harmonic element to the sounds." [[Red Bull]] stated that his sound and tracks regularly contained "tender vocals and ambient beats."
