'''The Neville Brothers''' were an American [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[soul music|soul]]/[[funk]] group, formed in 1977 in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].

==History==
The group notion started in 1976, when the four brothers of the Neville family, [[Art Neville|Art]] (1937–2019), [[Charles Neville (musician)|Charles]] (1938–2018), [[Aaron Neville|Aaron]] (b. 1941), and [[Cyril Neville|Cyril]] (b. 1948) came together to take part in the recording session of [[the Wild Tchoupitoulas]], a [[Mardi Gras Indians|Mardi Gras Indian]] group led by the Nevilles' uncle, George Landry ("Big Chief Jolly").<ref name="LarkinBlues">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Blues]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-673-1|page=280/1}}</ref>

Their debut album ''The Neville Brothers'' was released in 1978 on [[Capitol Records]].<ref>{{cite AV media |people=The Neville Brothers |date=1978 |title=The Neville Brothers|medium=LP|location=Hollywood, CA |publisher=Capitol |id=ST-11865|oclc=5004448}}</ref>

In 1987, the group released ''[[Uptown (Neville Brothers album)|Uptown]]'' on the [[EMI]] label, featuring guests including [[Branford Marsalis]], [[Keith Richards]], and [[Carlos Santana]]. The following year saw the release of ''[[Yellow Moon]]'' from [[A&M Records]] produced by [[Daniel Lanois]]. The track "Healing Chant" from that album won the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]] at the 1990 [[32nd Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy ceremony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/32nd-annual-grammy-awards|title=32nd Annual GRAMMY Awards|date=2017-11-28|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-23}}</ref>

In 1990, the Neville Brothers contributed "[[In the Still of the Night (Cole Porter song)|In the Still of the Night]]" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Various artists |date=1990 |title=Red Hot & Blue|medium=CD|location=Hollywood, CA |publisher=Chrysalis |id=F2 21799 |oclc=947953022}}</ref> 

Also in 1990, they appeared on the bill at that year's [[Glastonbury Festival]].<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book|first=John|last=Tobler|year=1992|title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|edition=1st|publisher=Reed International Books Ltd|location=London|page=471|id=CN 5585}}</ref> Due to Art Neville devoting more time to his other act, [[The Meters]], the band kept a low profile in the late 1990s onto the early 2000s. They made a comeback in 2004, however, with the album, ''Walkin' in the Shadow of Life'', on Back Porch Records, their first newly recorded effort in five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/walkin-in-the-shadow-of-life-mw0000140004|title=Walkin' in the Shadow of Life - Neville Brothers &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|access-date=March 9, 2021|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

All brothers except Charles, a Massachusetts resident, had been living in New Orleans, but following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in [[2005 in music|2005]] Cyril and Aaron moved out of the city. Aaron moved to Austin briefly at the invitation on his friend, the late blues club impresario, [[Clifford_Antone|Clifford Antone]]. They had not been performing in New Orleans since Katrina hit the city; however, they finally returned to perform there at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]] in 2008, being given the closing spot which had been reserved for them for years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSGOR58294620071117|title=Neville Bros. return to New Orleans jazz festival|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|website=reuters.com|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nola.com/keithspera/2008/05/the_neville_brothers_triumphan.html|title=The Neville Brothers' triumphant Jazzfest return|website=nola.com|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref>

Infrequently, Aaron's son [[Ivan Neville]] ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]) and Art's son Ian Neville ([[electric guitar]]), both of the band [[Dumpstaphunk]], have played with the Neville Brothers. 

The final Neville Brothers studio album, titled ''Walkin' in the Shadow of Life'', was released in 2004.<ref name="Spera">{{cite news |last=Spera |first=Keith |date=December 19, 2018 |title=Art Neville, founding member of the Neville Brothers and the Meters, has retired |url=https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/entertainment_life/keith_spera/article_8dbea740-03e7-11e9-bf95-bb276a49b614.html |work=The New Orleans Advocate|access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> The group formally disbanded in 2012 but reunited in 2015 for a farewell concert in New Orleans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/jazzfest/index.ssf/2015/05/neville_brothers_farewell_show.html|title=Neville Brothers farewell concert was both celebratory and confounding|last=Spera|first=Keith|date=May 3, 2015|website=Nola.com|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref>
