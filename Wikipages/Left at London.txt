==Career==
===2014-2018: Career beginnings, Vine, and demo EPs ===
Puff first began writing songs in fifth grade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artisthome.org/left-at-london-on-being-yourself-no-matter-what/|title=Left at London on Being Yourself, No Matter What|website=Artist Home|first=Jake|last=Uitti|date=June 21, 2019|access-date=August 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190809151115/http://artisthome.org/left-at-london-on-being-yourself-no-matter-what/|archive-date=August 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Left at London project originally started as a band, though after the project fell apart Puff kept the previous group's monicker as her stage name, as she was uncomfortable using her legal name. The name Left at London comes from an experience where Puff misread the sign of a local bar called "The Loft at Tandem".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/left-at-london-interview/|title=Left at London Shares What Went Into "Do You See Us" and "As Blue As A Bruise"|last=Uitti|first=Jacob|website=American Songwriter|date=20 July 2020|access-date=21 September 2020}}</ref> She began posting short videos on [[Vine (service)|Vine]] in 2014.<ref name="dazed"/> In 2014 and 2015 while still in high school, Puff released three demo EPs, ''Youth Group Computer'', ''2 Rowdy 4 Dennys / Give Peace a Break'', and ''Will Write Songs 4 Money'', all receiving very limited releases.
