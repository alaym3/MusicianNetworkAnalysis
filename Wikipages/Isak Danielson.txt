It's a mixture of soulful ballads, with a couple of acoustic folk pop romps thrown in for good measure."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scandipop.co.uk/album-isak-danielson-volume-1/|title= ALBUM: Isak Danielson ''Volume 1''|website=Scandipop|date=22 April 2015|accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref>

In April 2020, Danielson released his second studio album, ''Remember to Remember Me''. The album title is a message to the listener to follow along on his personal journey, where no topic is too delicate to explore. In the songs "Light Up", "Silence" and "Religion", Danielson reflects on his own relationship with anxiety and his message that no one should ever feel alone in their struggle with anxiety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/clap-your-hands/pressreleases/album-isak-danielson-blottar-sitt-moerker-i-nya-studioalbumet-2992025|title=ALBUM.

Per Magnusson from ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' gave the album 3 out of 5 saying "Isak Danielson makes pop music so emotional and sad that it almost forgets to breathe" and that "he sings well beyond his age".<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Aftonbladet]] |url= https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/a/Wb52pg/isak-danielson-blandar-en-livsfarlig-cocktail-av-kanslor|title=Isak Danielson blandar en livsfarlig cocktail av känslor|language=Swedish|date=17 April 2020|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>
