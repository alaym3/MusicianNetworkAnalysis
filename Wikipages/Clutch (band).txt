==History==
===Early years and breakthrough: 1991–2003===
Clutch was formed in 1991<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td14V_hTX1M|title=CLUTCH ~Tim Sult Interview!|last=Vodka Broad Whorizons|date=May 12, 2013|access-date=March 23, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> by Dan Maines (bass), Jean-Paul Gaster (drums), Tim Sult (guitar), and Roger Smalls (vocals)<ref name="LarkinHR"/> in [[Germantown, Maryland]]. Before settling on the name Clutch, the band used the early names Glut Trip and Moral Minority. Smalls soon departed and was replaced by Neil Fallon,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> a longtime schoolmate of the other members at Seneca Valley High School. The band quickly gained notice through constant touring. The 12" single "Passive Restraints" on the [[Earache Records|Earache]] label was Clutch's first commercial release, garnering attention from other labels.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Their debut LP, ''[[Transnational Speedway League]]'', was released in 1993.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> It was followed by a [[Clutch (Clutch album)|self-titled album]] two years later that gained Clutch mainstream exposure.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The band moved to the larger Columbia label for the 1998 album ''[[The Elephant Riders]]''.<ref name="allmusic" /> They followed it in 1999 with a self-released groove-based album ''[[Jam Room]]''.

The album ''[[Pure Rock Fury]]'' was released by [[Atlantic Records]] in 2001. The title track was initially released as the first single. The program director for North Carolina rock station [[WXQR]] (Rock 105), Brian Rickman, suggested that the label switch singles to another track from the album, "Careful with That Mic". Atlantic did so, and Clutch achieved a surprise hit single. The follow-up tracks, "Immortal" and "Open Up the Border", were also well received by American rock stations. In 2003 they issued ''[[Live at the Googolplex]]'' and the rarities record ''[[Slow Hole to China]]''.

===Commercial and critical success: 2004–2011===
The album ''[[Blast Tyrant]]'' was released in 2004, their first for [[DRT Entertainment]]. The band once again enjoyed more rock radio airplay and heavy rotation on the Music Choice cable service thanks to the single "The Mob Goes Wild". Its accompanying video was directed by [[Bam Margera]], and featured Margera's ''[[Viva La Bam]]'' co-stars; [[Ryan Dunn]], [[Brandon DiCamillo]], and [[Don Vito]]. The video was filmed at Rex's in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-rock.com/index.cfm?page=media&categoryid=2&mid=4 |title=CLUTCH : Media |website=Pro-rock.com |access-date=June 29, 2014}}</ref> The 2005 release ''[[Pitchfork & Lost Needles]]'' combined Clutch's 1991 ''Pitchfork'' 7-inch release with previously unreleased demos and early tracks. In 2005 the band saw their first lineup change since the early 1990s with the addition of organist Mick Schauer, who performed on the albums ''[[Robot Hive/Exodus]]'' (2005) and ''[[From Beale Street to Oblivion]]'' (2007). The later album was produced by [[Joe Barresi]] who has also produced for [[Kyuss]], [[Melvins]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], and [[Tool (band)|Tool]].

The band's first live DVD, ''[[Full Fathom Five: Video Field Recordings|Full Fathom Five]]'', and [[Full Fathom Five (album)|accompanying CD]], produced and directed by Agent Ogden, were released in September 2008. The band also released a remastered version of ''[[Slow Hole to China: Rare and Unreleased]]'' on April 28, 2009. The band's ninth studio album ''[[Strange Cousins from the West]]'', was released on July 14, 2009. Songs from the album were played live on tour prior to the album's recording. A two-disc DVD set ''Clutch Live at the 9:30'' was released on May 11, 2010 by the band's own label, [[Weathermaker Music]]. The set includes the entire December 28, 2009 show at Washington, D.C.'s 9:30 club, in which the band performed its entire 1995 self-titled LP.

On May 10, 2011, Clutch reissued their 2004 album ''[[Blast Tyrant]]'' on Weathermaker Music. The new edition contained a bonus album known as ''Basket of Eggs'' that includes unreleased songs as well as acoustic versions of previous hits.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pro-rock.com/index.cfm?page=headlines&hid=150|title=Blast Tyrant/Basket of Eggs|website=Pro-Rock.com|date=February 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/03/18/clutch-tight-like-that-acoustic/|title=The acoustic version of Clutch's 'Tight Like That'|date=March 18, 2011|work=Metal Sucks}}</ref> In its first week of release ''Blast Tyrant'' sold close to three thousand copies nationally, landing it at No. 26 on the Billboard Hard Rock Top 100, more than seven years after the original version debuted at No. 15.

===Recent releases: 2012–present===
On June 10, 2012, the band released a new single, "Pigtown Blues", backed with an acoustic version of "Motherless Child" from ''[[Strange Cousins from the West]]''.

On March 16, 2013 Clutch released their tenth album ''[[Earth Rocker]]'' which entered the [[Billboard Top 200]] chart at No. 15 giving Clutch their highest chart position to date. It remained on the chart for a total of five weeks. The album also reached No. 4 on iTunes' overall Top 100 album charts and was No. 1 on their rock chart. ''Earthrocker'' won Album of the Year 2013 from British publication ''[[Metalhammer]]'', and was rated highly on many rock and metal magazines' and websites' end-of-the-year "top-tens".

In an interview on January 7, 2015 with music and entertainment company 88 Miles West, Fallon stated that the band was heading to Dripping Springs, Texas, to record their upcoming eleventh album. Fallon states the venture to Texas was due to the relocation of [[Machine (producer)|record producer Machine]], with whom they worked on ''Blast Tyrant'' and ''Earth Rocker'', and who recently opened a new studio there.  He stated in the interview that "Septemberish, give or take a couple of months" is when they hope to release the new album.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://88mileswest.com/article/Interviews/434#.VLrp_9LF-6K|title=Video Interview with Neil Fallon of Clutch|date=January 7, 2015|work=88 Miles West|access-date=January 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119210825/http://88mileswest.com/article/Interviews/434#.VLrp_9LF-6K|archive-date=January 19, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Their eleventh studio album is titled ''[[Psychic Warfare]]'', and was released October 2, 2015. Fallon said the concept is influenced by [[science fiction]] author [[Philip K. Dick]]. "His general philosophy and questions have always crept into my lyrics, because I share an interest in it", he added. "On ''Earth Rocker'', 'Crucial Velocity' was definitely a Philip Dick song for me. On this record, 'X-Ray Visions' certainly is." Gaster described the new material as more diverse than ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/clutch_aim_for_diverse_11th_album.html|title=Clutch Aim for 'Diverse' 11th Album|website=Ultimate-guitar.com|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref>

In April 2018, Neil Fallon announced through the radio station The Eagle Rocks that the band's twelfth studio album would be titled ''[[Book of Bad Decisions]]''. The album was released on September 7, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/clutch_releasing_new_album_book_of_bad_decisions_in_september.html|title=Clutch Releasing New Album 'Book of Bad Decisions' in September|website=Ultimate-guitar.com|access-date=September 19, 2019}}</ref> The album was recorded at Sputnik Sound Studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with producer and engineer [[Vance Powell]].

Former keyboardist Mick Schauer died in September 2019.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-clutch-keyboardist-mick-schauer-dies/|title=Former CLUTCH Keyboardist MICK SCHAUER Dies|date=September 16, 2019|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=September 19, 2019}}</ref>

In an August 2020 interview on the Detroit-based radio station [[WRIF]], drummer Jean-Paul Gaster stated that Clutch would "probably" begin recording their thirteenth studio album in the winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/clutch-will-probably-begin-recording-new-album-in-the-winter/|title=CLUTCH Will 'Probably' Begin Recording New Album In The Winter|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=August 6, 2020|date=August 6, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''Metal Kaoz'' in April 2021, Gaster offered an update on the new album, saying: "Over the last year, we've written a lot of songs for our new album, and we've done some streaming shows too, which was something we knew nothing about prior to the pandemic. But we educated ourselves quickly, and that kept us busy for a lot of last year as well. We've been writing now for our new album that we will record in the fall, and I think we're spending more time than ever in the studio, just trying out different ideas. And most of the ideas don't ever really make it to the end; we try 10 things and we keep one." Gaster also stated that their new album will likely not be released until early 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/clutch-has-written-a-lot-of-songs-for-next-studio-album/|title=CLUTCH Has Written 'A Lot Of Songs' For Next Studio Album|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=May 1, 2021|date=April 29, 2021}}</ref>

==Other projects==
In the late 1990s, Clutch and its sibling project [[The Bakerton Group]] (an [[instrumental]] [[jam band]] composed of all four Clutch members) formed an independent record label, River Road Records, to release their own music. River Road does not sign any other artists. The Bakerton Group has released one three-track EP titled ''Space Guitars'' and two full-length albums titled ''[[The Bakerton Group (album)|The Bakerton Group]]'' and ''[[El Rojo]]'' respectively. Clutch/Bakerton Group now runs its own independent record label for its own releases, [[Weathermaker Music]].{{cn|date=January 2021}}
