'''''Don't Hug Me I'm Scared''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] adult [[Surreal humour|surreal]] [[comedy horror]] [[web series]] created by Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling. It consists of six episodes, released from 29 July 2011 to 19 June 2016 through the artists' website, [[YouTube]], and [[Vimeo]].<ref name ="Beckyandjoes">{{cite web |last1=Sloan |first1=Becky |last2=Pelling |first2=Joseph |work=Becky & Joe's Art |title=Awards. Festivals. Talks. |date=3 March 2014 |url=http://beckyandjoes.com/where/}}.</ref> The series combines segments in [[live action]], [[puppetry]], [[traditional animation]], [[flash animation]], [[clay animation]], and [[computer animation]].

Each episode starts like a typical [[Children's television series|children's series]], consisting of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] puppets akin to those featured in ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and other popular children's television programmes. The series parodies and satirize these TV programmes by contrasting this childlike, colourful environment and its inhabitants against disturbing themes; each episode features a [[surrealism|surreal]] [[plot twist]] in the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], including [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] content and imagery involving [[graphic violence]] [[Black comedy|dark humour]] and [[existential]] and [[psychological horror]]. The six episodes explore and discuss the subjects of [[creativity]], [[time]], [[love]], [[technology]], [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[dreams]].

On 7 July 2020, it was announced by creator Becky Sloan that the Don't Hug Me I'm Scared TV series will be airing on [[Channel 4]] as a television series in the future.<ref name="bfi">{{cite web|title=Latest Young Audiences Content Fund production slate announced|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/announcements/young-audiences-content-fund-production-slate|access-date=8 July 2020|publisher=British Film Institute|language=en}}</ref>

==Plot==
Each episode revolves around three characters: a yellow childlike [[humanoid]] with blue hair and overalls, an anthropomorphic green [[mallard duck]] with a plaid coat, and a red humanoid with a mop-like head. They have no names explicitly stated within the series, but are often referred to as Red Guy, Yellow Guy, and Duck. Yellow Guy's father, Roy, also occasionally appears.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/27/dont-hug-me-im-scared-youtube-viral-puppet-show-interview|title=Don't Hug Me I'm Scared: the puppets who sing, dance and eat raw meat|date=27 January 2016|website=the Guardian}}</ref> An episode typically goes with the three main characters meeting one or several [[anthropomorphic]] characters, who begin a musical number related to a basic concept of day-to-day life with an upbeat melody similar to that of a nursery rhyme. As each song progresses, it becomes apparent that its moral or message is nonsensical or self-contradicting, and that the "teacher" character has ulterior or sinister motives. The climax of each episode typically involves a plot twist involving the addition of [[graphic violence]] or other warped themes. Later in the series, the characters begin questioning the nature of their reality and the bizarre messages of the teachers.

==Production==
Sloan and Pelling met while studying Fine Art and Animation respectively at [[Kingston University]], where they started THIS IS IT Collective with some friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/18301/1/beckyjoe-are-this-weeks-dazed-visionaries|title=Becky&Joe are this week's Dazed Visionaries|author=Matt Mansfield |date=6 January 2014|website=Dazed|access-date=19 June 2016}}</ref> They produced the first episode of ''Don't Hug Me I'm Scared'' in their free time with no budget. When they started on the project they imagined making it into a series, but initially dropped the idea after finishing the first episode. After the short film gained popularity, they decided to revisit that idea.<ref name="Metro Interview">{{cite web |last=Boult |first=Adam |url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/26/dont-hug-me-im-scared-interview-with-creators-becky-joe-5462591/ |title=Don't Hug Me I'm Scared: Interview with creators Becky & Joe |date=26 October 2015 |work=Metro News |access-date=17 April 2016}}</ref> Channel 4's Random Acts commissioned the second episode. The show soon attracted mainstream commissioners; however, Sloan and Pelling turned these offers down because they "wanted to keep it fairly odd" and "have the freedom to do exactly what we wanted".<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web |last=Coldwell |first=Will |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/27/dont-hug-me-im-scared-youtube-viral-puppet-show-interview |title=Don't Hug Me I'm Scared: the puppets who sing, dance and eat raw meat |work=The Guardian |date=27 January 2016 |access-date=17 April 2016}}</ref>

In May 2013, Sloan and Pelling announced that they would start a [[Kickstarter]] fundraising campaign to make four or more additional episodes, one every three months, starting in September 2014. They uploaded low-quality camera footage of the characters being taken [[hostage]] and held for [[ransom]].<ref name="kickstarter">{{cite web | url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1127979050/dont-hug-me-im-scared-the-series | title=Don't Hug Me I'm Scared : The Series by Becky and Joe | publisher=Kickstarter |date=20 May 2014 | access-date=27 May 2014}}</ref> A 12-year-old American boy tried to use hacked credit card information to donate £35,000 to the campaign, but he was caught and those funds were thrown out.<ref name="Credit.com">{{cite web |url=http://blog.credit.com/2014/06/12-year-old-used-stolen-credit-cards-to-fund-puppet-show-85832/ |title=12-Year-Old Used Stolen Credit Cards to Fund Puppet Show |first=Christine |last=DiGangi |work=Credit.com |date=25 June 2014 |access-date=17 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830053637/http://blog.credit.com/2014/06/12-year-old-used-stolen-credit-cards-to-fund-puppet-show-85832/ |archive-date=30 August 2014}}</ref> Their Kickstarter goal of £96,000 was reached on 19 June 2014, and in total £104,935 was raised.<ref name="kickstarter"/> YouTuber [[TomSka]] became an executive producer on the series after donating £5,000 to the Kickstarter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teneightymagazine.com/2014/06/14/tomska-pledges-5k-to-dont-hug-me-im-scared-series/|title=TomSka pledges £5K to Don't Hug Me I'm Scared series}}</ref>

==Themes==
In a faux interview, Becky and Joe jokingly described the plot as "three best friends who go on a journey to find a magic pirate ship and save the day".<ref>{{cite web |last=Gilbert |first=Jan |publisher=Sundance London |date=1 May 2012 |title=Directors of Short Films at Sundance London |url=http://flicksandthecity.com/interviews-short-film-directors-sundance-london/ |access-date=17 March 2014}}</ref>

A student writer for ''[[Nouse]]'' compared the appeal of the first episode to themes in [[Gothic fiction|Gothic literature]], arguing that they are both "tapping into the same cultural fear of a violent subconscious hiding beneath the façade of normality".<ref name="Nouse">{{cite web |url=http://www.nouse.co.uk/2013/10/22/when-youtube-gets-dark/|title=When YouTube gets dark |first=Jordan |last=Licht |work=[[Nouse]] |date=22 October 2013 |access-date=17 April 2016}}</ref> In ''[[The Wesleyan Argus]]'', another student writer called the series a "fine example of the era of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]]" and noted that, "There is a building meta-commentary on the relationships between viewer, perception, creator, participant, and art (and perhaps death) that began with the first episode, but what that commentary is trying to say is not yet entirely clear. However, there is an absolute sense that the series is building toward a culmination."<ref name="Wesleyan Argus">{{cite web |last=McGhee |first=Will |url=http://wesleyanargus.com/2015/10/22/dont-hug-me-im-scared/|title='Don't Hug Me I'm Scared' Melds Comedy with Horror |work=[[The Wesleyan Argus]] |date=22 October 2015 |access-date=17 April 2016}}</ref>

They have also co-written and did puppeteer work for [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' episode "The Puppets" (season five, episode 40). Sloan and Baker Terry provided voices of Grady, Frank, and Howdy (the three puppets featured in the episode, who trap the main characters Gumball and Darwin in their world). This episode features a song where the puppets sing about never-ending fun to Darwin with toned-down disturbing content similar to the ''Don't Hug Me I'm Scared'' series in theme. A series of shorts based on the episode followed, titled ''[[Waiting for Gumball]]'', made by the same team as the original TV episode.
