C19</ref>

She then created the role of the Witch in Sondheim-Lapine's ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987). Peters is "considered by many to be the premier interpreter of [Sondheim's] work," according to writer Alex Witchel.<ref name="nytimes1999"/> Raymond Knapp wrote that Peters "achieved her definitive stardom" in ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and ''Into the Woods''.<ref>Knapp, p. 215</ref> Sondheim has said of Peters, "Like very few others, she sings and acts at the same time," he says. "Most performers act and then sing, act and then sing ... Bernadette is flawless as far as I'm concerned. I can't think of anything negative."<ref>Crews, Chip.

She next starred in the musical adaptation of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Goodbye Girl (musical)|The Goodbye Girl]]'' with music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] (1993). Peters won her second Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as [[Annie Oakley]] in the 1999 Broadway revival of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''. Among many glowing notices, critic [[Lloyd Rose]] of ''The Washington Post'' commented: "[Peters] banishes all thoughts of Ethel Merman about two bars into her first number, 'Doin' What Comes Natur'lly.' Partly this is because Merman's Annie was a hearty, boisterous gal, while Peters plays an adorable, slightly goofy gamine. ... For anyone who cares about the American musical theater, the chance to see Peters in this role is reason enough to see the show."<ref>Rose, Lloyd.

In 2003, Peters starred as Mama Rose in the Broadway revival of ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'', earning another Tony nomination. [[Ben Brantley]] in ''The New York Times'' wrote, "Working against type and expectation under the direction of Sam Mendes, Ms. Peters has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career, and she has done this in ways that deviate radically from the Merman blueprint."<ref>Brantley, Ben.

{{quote|Peters debuts on record as a first-rate pop torch singer: [[Melissa Manchester]] with soul, Bette Midler on pitch. Her album has already spawned the hit single "Gee Whiz," a laid-back, doo-wop version&nbsp;... that makes Peters' piping, little-girl voice seem almost like a cutesy novelty.  There are also a couple of [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]] rock tunes in which she sounds slightly trashy and out of her depth. The [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]] songs on side two are really more her style.  In fact, the whole second half of ''Bernadette Peters'' is just about perfect, from the star's semi-C&W rendition of [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]]'s "Pearl's a Singer" to a wistful recap of [[Harry Warren]] and Mark Gordon's romantic "You'll Never Know."  But the best cuts are in between. "Other Lady," written by [[Lesley Gore]] (!) with [[Ellen Weston]], tackles an age-old problem with... devastating eloquence... and Peters delivers it with the proper brooding introspection. Allen's compositions, "Only Wounded" (co-written with [[Carole Bayer Sager]]) and the torchy "I Never Thought I'd Break" (co-written with [[Dean Pitchford]]), feature the finest singing on the LP...the unusual absence of airbrushing echo places heavy demands on the chanteuse's sultry soprano. That Bernadette Peters rises to the occasion makes her performance that much more impressive.<ref>"Bernadette Peters: MCA records", ''Rolling Stone'' (1980)</ref>}}

In ''The New York Times'' review of the 1986 Broadway cast recording of ''Song and Dance'' (titled ''Bernadette Peters in Andrew Lloyd Webber<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 'Song & Dance'''), Stephen Holden wrote that the recording was "a personal triumph for a singer and actress who is rapidly establishing herself as the first lady of the Broadway musical. Performing material whose music borders on kitsch and whose lyrics and story suggest a verbose soap opera, Miss Peters nevertheless projects an astounding emotional generosity and conviction. Almost singlehandedly she turns the inconsequential erotic misadventures of Emma ... into a touching romantic fable about love and its defenses and the loss of innocence. ...  Miss Peters has always oozed a cuddlesome Shirley Temple-like sweetness and vulnerability. This quality, which used to seem more like an adorable child-star affectation than a deep-seated trait, has proved to be an essential ingredient of Miss Peters's personality.  A delivery that once seemed coy and cutesy has deepened and ripened into an honesty and compassion that pour out in singing that is childlike but also resilient."<ref>Holden, Stephen.

In 2003, Andrew Gans wrote in ''Playbill.com'' of Peters's recording sessions for ''Gypsy'': "What is it about her voice that is so moving? Part womanly and part girlish, it is a powerful instrument, not only in volume (though that is impressive) but in the wealth of emotion it is able to convey. ... her voice – that mix of husky, sweet, rounded, vibrato-filled tones – induces a response that spans the emotional scale." Of her "Rose's Turn", Gans wrote: "...her rendition of this song may be the highlight of a career already filled with many highlights: She has taken a song that has been delivered incredibly by others and brought it to a new level."<ref>Gans, Andrew.
