== History ==

=== ''Lincoln'' (self-titled album) (1997) ===
Formed by singer-songwriter [[Chris Temple]], a former [[landscaper]],<ref name=Ledger>Miller, Jay N. (March 21, 1998). "CD Reviews: Lincoln: Lincoln", ''[[The Patriot Ledger]]'', p. 37.</ref> the band released their first and only (self-titled) album in 1997. The album was noted to show versatility in songwriting, ranging from [[Indie pop|alt-pop]] to [[country rock]] to [[synthpop]].<ref>Damas, Jason. "[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r308140|pure_url=yes}} Lincoln]", [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on 2009-09-19.</ref> The lyrics were often observations of life, ranging from relationships (and their end) in "Stop" and "Wish you Were Dead" via [[hedonism|hedonistic]] car driving in "Sucker", drug habits in "Straight", the burden of keeping up appearances in "Unhappy" to an anti-anthem for Temple's hometown [[Carversville, Pennsylvania]] in "Carversville".<ref>[Announcement by Temple during the Atlanta concert on their 1998 tour]</ref> The album got positive reviews, both from critics and fans.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r308140|pure_url=yes}} Lincoln - album review on allmusic.com]</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Lincoln/product-reviews/B0000057C7/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_summary?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending Lincoln album reviews on amazon.com]</ref> Gary Graff of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote that the album put Lincoln on a short list of "quirky pop groups that know how to wrap their irreverence in irresistible songs."<ref>Graff, Gary (July 20, 1997). "Lincoln: Lincoln", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', p. 40.</ref> ''[[The Patriot Ledger]]'''s critic wrote that "Lincoln explores the same nerdy pop domain as their mentors, They Might Be Giants, with clever lyrics and slightly skewed rock."<ref name=Ledger /> In a positive review, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared the band's songs to "long-lost '70s Top 40 hits."<ref>Browne, David (August 8, 1997). "[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288983,00.html Music Review: Lincoln: Lincoln]", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Retrieved on 2009-09-19.</ref>

=== Tours ===
On tours, Lincoln opened for [[They Might Be Giants]], [[Susanna Hoffs]] and [[Marcy Playground]]. (Although they toured together, Lincoln did not take its name from They Might Be Giants' album ''[[Lincoln (album)|Lincoln]]''.)<ref>Saldana, Hector (November 7, 1997). "They Might Be Giants: More than 'quirky'", ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', p. H13.</ref> In a review of one of the performances, the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' wrote that Lincoln "specializes more in charisma and less in invention: While lead singer Chris Temple is endearing, his band's music is mostly guitar-oriented pop. It's mostly harmless but quite memorable."<ref>Gilbertson, Jon M. (October 20, 1997). "They Might Be Giants keeps it fun", ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', p. 8.</ref>

=== Breakup ===
While touring with [[Marcy Playground]] in the fall of 1998, guitarist Miller left the band. They played at least one concert (in [[Atlanta]]) with only the three remaining members,<ref>[witnessed by the author wniehues]</ref> but then the band broke up. Dan Miller and Danny Weinkauf went on to join [[They Might Be Giants]]. [[Gonzalo Martinez de la Cotera|Gonzalo "Gonz" Martinez de la Cotera]] became drummer of [[Marcy Playground]], replacing [[Dan Rieser]], but left the band before their 2009 tour. [[Chris Temple]] went on to pursue his solo career, as he also contributed a song for the film ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse]]''.
