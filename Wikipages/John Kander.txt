'''John Harold Kander''' (born March 18, 1927)<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = The World of Musical Comedy: The Story of the American Musical Stage as Told through the Careers of Its Foremost Composers and Lyricists|last = Green|first = Stanley|publisher = Da Capo|year = 1984|isbn = 0498023443|location = New York, NY|page = 331}}</ref> is an [[United States|American]] [[composer]], known largely for his work in the musical theater. As part of the songwriting team [[Kander and Ebb]] (featuring lyricist [[Fred Ebb]]), Kander wrote the scores for 15 musicals, including ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' (1966) and ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' (1975), both of which were later adapted into acclaimed films. He and Ebb also wrote the standard "[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]" (also known as "Theme from ''New York, New York''").

==Early life==

Kander attended his first opera performances at the age of nine, when the San Carlo Opera came to Kansas City with their productions of ''[[Aida]]'' and ''[[Madama Butterfly]].'' According to Kander, "My mother took me and we sat in the first row. There were these giants on the stage, and my feet were dangling over my seat. It was overwhelming for me, even though I could see the strings that held the beards on the Egyptian soldiers.... My interest in telling a story through music in many ways derived from early experiences like those."<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Kander and Ebb (Yale Broadway Masters Series)|last=Leve|first=James|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0300114874|location=New Haven|page=12}}</ref>

Kander was raised in Kansas City, and attended Westport High School, before transferring to [[The Pembroke Hill School|the Pembroke Country-Day School]]. During the 1940s, Kander joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] Cadet Corps. After completing his training in California and sailing between San Francisco and Asia, Kander left the Corps on May 3, 1946.<ref name=":1"/>

However, due to rule changes governing national service, Kander was forced to enlist in the Army Reserves in September of the same year, after having already completed one semester at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. During the Korean War, Kander was ordered back into active duty, but he was forced to remain in New York City for six months of observation after a medical physical revealed scars on his lungs. He was officially discharged on July 3, 1957.<ref name=":1"/>

Kander studied music at [[Oberlin College]] and [[Columbia University]], where he was a protégé of [[Douglas Moore]]<ref>{{NewMusicBox|id=john-kander-passing-through-curtains|title=Passing Through Curtains|composer=John Kander|author=[[Frank J. Oteri]]|conducted=April 7, 2010|published=May 1, 2010}}</ref> and studied composition with [[Jack Beeson]] and [[Otto Luening]]. He earned his master's degree from Columbia University in 1953.<ref name=":0"/>

==Career==
Following his studies, Kander began conducting at summer theaters before serving as a rehearsal pianist<ref name=":0"/> for the musical ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Jerome Robbins]] in New York. While working, Kander met the choreographer, Jerome Robbins, who suggested that Kander compose the dance music for the show in 1959. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} After that experience, he wrote dance arrangements for ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/personlistpage/person-list?production=00000150-aea6-d936-a7fd-eef600d00005 |title=Person List |website=[[Playbill]] |access-date=January 10, 2018 }}</ref>

Kander's first produced musical was ''[[A Family Affair (musical)|A Family Affair]]'' in 1962, written with [[James Goldman|James]] and [[William Goldman]]. The same year, Kander met [[Fred Ebb]] through their mutual publisher, Tommy Volando.<ref name=":0"/> The first song Kander and Ebb wrote together, "My Coloring Book", was made popular by a recording from Sandy Stewart and their second song, "I Don't Care Much", was made famous by [[Barbra Streisand]], and Kander and Ebb became a permanent team.<ref name=":0"/>

In 1965, Kander and Ebb wrote music for their first show on Broadway, ''[[Flora the Red Menace]]'', produced by [[Hal Prince]], directed by [[George Abbott]], and with book by George Abbott and [[Robert W. Russell|Robert Russell]], in which [[Liza Minnelli]] made her Broadway debut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/production/flora-the-red-menace-alvin-theatre-vault-0000000893 |title=Flora, the Red Menace Broadway @ Alvin Theatre - Tickets and Discounts |website=[[Playbill]] |access-date=January 10, 2018 }}</ref>

Kander and Ebb have since been associated with writing material for both [[Liza Minnelli]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/production/liza-winter-garden-theatre-vault-0000011544 |title=Liza Broadway @ Winter Garden Theatre - Tickets and Discounts |website=[[Playbill]] |access-date=January 10, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/16105/ |title=Suddenly Liza |last=Schillinger |first=Liesl |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |publisher=New York Media, LLC |access-date=January 10, 2018 }}</ref> and [[Chita Rivera]] (including the musicals ''Zorba'', ''Chicago'', ''The Rink'', and ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'') and have produced special material for their appearances live and on television, such as ''Liza with a Z''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Broadway musicals ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' have been made into films. The film version of ''Chicago'' won several 2002 [[Academy Award]]s, including for best picture, film editing, costume design, art direction and sound.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/24/movies/chicago-big-oscar-winner-but-pianist-surprises-hollywood-glamour-still-stars.html |title='Chicago' Is Big Oscar Winner, but 'Pianist' Surprises; Hollywood Glamour Still Stars at Ceremony, but Security and War Play Supporting Roles |last=Lyman |first=Rick |date=March 24, 2003 |work=[[The New York Times]]  |access-date=January 10, 2018 }}</ref> In his musicological and biographical study of the collaboration of Kander and Ebb, James Leve discusses the full history of ''Cabaret'' and ''Chicago'' in chapters titled "The Divinely Decadent Lives of ''Cabaret''" and "''Chicago'': Broadway to Hollywood". As Leve notes, ''Cabaret'', which is a musical adaptation of [[Christopher Isherwood]]'s ''The Berlin Stories'',  was an "ideal vehicle for Kander and Ebb's brittle and self-referential brand of musical theater."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kander and Ebb|last=Leve|first=James|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-300-11487-4|pages=35}}</ref>  This insight also holds true for ''Chicago.''

Kander, along with Ebb, also wrote songs for [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'', and it was set to premiere in London, but the rights were pulled by Wilder's nephew. He also says that [[Harvey Schmidt]] and [[Tom Jones (writer)|Tom Jones]], the writers of ''[[The Fantasticks]]'', wrote a musical of Wilder's ''[[Our Town]]'' and it took them thirteen years to write, only to have the rights pulled as well by the nephew.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/InDepth-InterView-John-Kander-20101102-page2 |title=InDepth InterView: John Kander |last=Cerasaro |first=Pat |date=November 2, 2010 |website=Broadway World |access-date=November 24, 2010 }}</ref>
