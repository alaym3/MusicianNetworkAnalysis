'''Golden Earring''' was a Dutch [[rock music|rock]] band, founded in 1961 in [[The Hague]] as The Golden Earrings. They achieved worldwide fame with their international hit songs  "[[Radar Love]]" in 1973, which went to number one on the Dutch charts, reached the top ten in the United Kingdom, and went to number thirteen on the United States charts,<ref name=huey/><ref>''US-Singles: Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–2006''. Billboard Books, New York 2007, {{ISBN|0-89820-172-1}} / ''US-Alben: The Billboard Albums von Joel Whitburn'', 6th Edition, Record Research 2006, {{ISBN|0-89820-166-7}}</ref> "[[Twilight Zone (Golden Earring song)|Twilight Zone]]" in 1982, and "[[When the Lady Smiles]]" in 1984.<ref name=huey/> During their career they have had nearly 30 top-ten singles on the Dutch charts while releasing 25 studio albums.

The band went through a number of early line-up changes, though the band reached a stable line-up in 1970, consisting of [[Rinus Gerritsen]] (bass and keyboards), [[George Kooymans]] (vocals and guitar), [[Barry Hay]] (vocals, guitar, flute and saxophone), and [[Cesar Zuiderwijk]] (drums and percussion), which remained unchanged until the band broke up in 2021 following the diagnosis of Kooymans with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. A number of other musicians also appeared in short stints with the band over its history as well.

==History==
===Early years (1961–1969)===
What became Golden Earring was formed in 1961 in [[The Hague]] by 13-year-old George Kooymans and his 15-year-old neighbor, Rinus Gerritsen.{{cn|date=November 2021}} Originally called "the Tornados", the name was changed to '''the Golden Earrings'''<ref name="LarkinHR"/> when they discovered that the name [[the Tornados]] was already in use by another group.{{cn|date=November 2021}} The name "the Golden Earrings" was taken from an instrumental called "Golden Earrings" performed by the British group [[The Hunters (instrumental band)|the Hunters]], for whom they served as opening and closing act. Initially a pop-rock band with Frans Krassenburg on lead vocals and [[Jaap Eggermont]] on drums, the Golden Earrings had hit with their debut single "Please Go", recorded in 1965.<ref name=huey/><ref name="LarkinHR"/> Dissatisfied with Dutch recording studios, the band's manager and co-discoverer Fred Haayen arranged for the next single to be recorded at the [[Pye Records]] studios in London. The record cut at Pye, "That Day", reached number two on the Dutch charts.{{cn|date=November 2021}} The definite article was dropped from the name in 1967, while the "s" was dropped in 1969).<ref name=huey>{{cite web|author1=Steve Huey|title=Golden Earring Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/golden-earring-mn0000669303/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=28 July 2015}}</ref>

In 1966, [[Barry Hay]] joined the band, replacing Krassenburg as frontman.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Two years later, the band earned their first number one hit in the Netherlands with the song "Dong Dong Diki Digi Dong".<ref name="LarkinHR"/> In the United States, ground work for entering the US market was being laid by East Coast FM radio disc jockey and music critic Neil Kempfer-Stocker, who is credited as the first radio DJ to play the band in the US. This single was followed by a successful psychedelic album ''[[Eight Miles High (album)|Eight Miles High]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> which featured an 19-minute version of the title track, a cover of the [[Eight Miles High|1966 hit song]] by [[the Byrds]]. The song, played throughout their US tour, "became the core performance of their live shows", and the experience in the US led them to make their studio albums resemble their live shows, rather than the other way around.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqU5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT219 |page=219 |title=Made in the Low Countries: Studies in Popular Music |series=Routledge Global Popular Music Series |editor1-first=Lutgard |editor1-last=Mutsaers |editor2-first=Gert |editor2-last=Keunen |publisher=Routledge |year=2017 |isbn=9781317417941 |first=Maarten |last=Steenmeijer |chapter=Before and After: Golden Earring Before and After the 'Dutch Invasion'}}</ref> The band's American records at this time period were issued by the Perception Records label in New York, and the band's ''[[Golden Earring (album)|Golden Earring]]'' LP, known as ''Wall of Dolls'', and single "Back Home" performed poorly in the US but became a number 1 hit in the Netherlands.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

===International fame (1970s and 1980s)===
[[File:Barry Hay 2 - Golden Earring - 1974.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lead vocalist|Lead singer]] [[Barry Hay]] in 1974]]
In 1969, drummer [[Cesar Zuiderwijk]] joined the band,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> completing what has become Golden Earring's classic line-up. The band enjoyed brief international fame in the 1970s when the single version of "[[Radar Love]]" (1973),<ref name="LarkinHR"/> from the gold-certified album ''[[Moontan]]'' became a hit in both Europe and the US.<ref name=huey/> Golden Earring embarked on their first major US tour in 1969–1970.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Owing to American influences, their music evolved towards hard rock,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> and they performed along with [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Procol Harum]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. Between 1969 and 1984, Golden Earring completed 13 US tours. During this period, they performed as the opening act for [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[King Crimson]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[38 Special (band)|.38 Special]]. During 1973–74, when "Radar Love" was a hit, they had [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Aerosmith]] as their opening acts. While signed to the UK Track Records label, the band rented the superb quadraphonic sound system normally used exclusively by [[the Who]].
 
Golden Earring enjoyed a brief period of US stardom,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> but were unable to secure further chart success until 1982's "[[Twilight Zone (Golden Earring song)|Twilight Zone]]".<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The music video of the song, directed by [[Dick Maas]], was played on the recently launched [[MTV]] in the United States, and helped the song to become a US hit, spending 27 weeks on the Billboard chart.<ref name=internationale>{{cite news |url=https://www.nu.nl/muziek/6114669/het-internationale-succes-van-golden-earring-van-nummer-1-tot-gebande-clip.html |website=NU.nl |accessdate=8 November 2021 |title=Het internationale succes van Golden Earring: van nummer 1 tot gebande clip |date=5 February 2021}}</ref>

"[[When the Lady Smiles]]" became an international hit in 1984, reaching No.&nbsp;3 in Canada and becoming the band's fifth number one hit in their native country, but was not successful in the United States, reaching no higher than #76 on the US Singles Chart. The video was banned from MTV because of its "unholy desires about a nun and a lobotomy";<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tampabay.com/nothing-to-smile-about-in-this-truly-odd-golden-earring-video/2213316/ |newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]] |title=Nothing to smile about in this truly odd Golden Earring video |first=Kevin |last=Wuench |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=8 November 2021}}</ref> this was Dick Maas's second video for the band, and helped launch his career as a film director.<ref name=internationale/> While touring the US in 1984, the band played at the Great Arena [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] in New Jersey on May 11 and were in the midst of their performance when a fire broke out at the [[Haunted Castle (Six Flags Great Adventure)|Haunted Castle]] on the opposite side of the theme park, killing eight teenagers. Following this tour, Golden Earring turned their focus toward Europe where they continue to attract standing-room-only crowds. The group paused briefly after the release of ''[[The Hole (album)|The Hole]]'' in 1986 to focus on other projects, with Hay and Kooymans both releasing solo albums (''Victory of Bad Taste'' and ''Solo'', respectively) the following year. The group then reconvened to record their final album of the 1980s, releasing ''[[Keeper of the Flame (Golden Earring album)|Keeper of the Flame]]'' in 1989.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

===Later years (1990s–2021)===
In 1991, Golden Earring had another hit in the Netherlands with "Going to the Run", a rock-ballad about a [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang member who was a friend of the band and died in a crash. The Russian rock band [[Aria (band)|Aria]] made a successful cover of "Going to the Run" as "Беспечный ангел" ("Careless Angel"). Between 1992 and 2004, the band released three acoustic live unplugged albums, which became quick successes. The acoustic albums feature unplugged versions of famous hits of the band, and have been some of the band's best-selling albums, such as ''The Naked Truth'', which sold over 500,000 copies in the Netherlands.

Golden Earring performed over 200 concerts a year, mainly in their home country and occasionally in Belgium, Germany, and the UK. These energetic live performances have been recorded on several live albums—''[[Live (Golden Earring album)|Live]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=187/8}}</ref> recorded at London's Rainbow Theater in 1977; ''[[2nd Live]]'', 1981; ''[[Something Heavy Going Down]]'', 1984 (also released on DVD as ''Live from the Twilight Zone''); and ''[[Last Blast of the Century]]'', a live recording of their last concert of the 20th century (available on both CD and DVD). Furthermore, the band's acoustic live albums include ''The Naked Truth'' (1992), ''Naked II'' (1997) and ''Naked III'' (2005). Their latest live album, ''Live from Ahoy 2006'', is a DVD with bonus CD.

Golden Earring celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2011, which the [[PostNL|Dutch postal service]] honored with a stamp that contained a music link: when a smartphone with a special app is held up to the music stamp, Golden Earring's "Radar Love" plays.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

On 11 May 2012, the band released their latest studio album, entitled ''Tits 'n Ass''. The album was recorded in [[London]] during summer of 2011 with producer [[Chris Kimsey]] and peaked at No. 1 in the Dutch album charts twice. The album's song "Still Got the Keys to My First Cadillac" was issued as a single. A video for the song featured young impersonators of Golden Earring.

On 25 June 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Golden Earring among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

On 5 February 2021, the band's manager announced to the Dutch press that their active career was over due to George Kooymans' serious illness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nos.nl/l/2367435|title=Ziekte George Kooymans betekent het einde van Golden Earring|website=Nos.nl|access-date=18 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://netherlandsnewslive.com/golden-earring-guitarist-george-kooymans-seriously-ill-show/80504/|title=Golden Earring guitarist George Kooymans seriously ill &#124; Show|website=Netherlandslive.com|date=5 February 2021|access-date=18 July 2021}}</ref>
