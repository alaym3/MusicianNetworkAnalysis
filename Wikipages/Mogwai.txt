==History==
===Formation (1991–1995)===
Stuart Braithwaite and Dominic Aitchison met in April 1991, and four years later formed Mogwai with old schoolfriend [[Martin Bulloch]].<ref name="Strong">Strong, Martin C. (2003) ''The Great Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-335-0}}, p. 872</ref> The band's name comes from the name of the creatures in the feature film ''[[Gremlins]]'', although guitarist Stuart Braithwaite comments that "it has no significant meaning and we always intended on getting a better one, but like a lot of other things we never got round to it."<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web | title = FAQ | url = http://www.mogwai.co.uk/words/Frequently_Asked_Questions/Frequently_Asked_Questions/ | year = 2006 | publisher = mogwai.co.uk | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060421044521/http://www.mogwai.co.uk/words/Frequently_Asked_Questions/Frequently_Asked_Questions/ | archive-date = 21 April 2006 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The word ''[[Mogwai (Chinese culture)|mogwai]]'' means "evil spirit" or "devil" in [[Cantonese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Whitely |first1=Sheila |title=Christmas, Ideology and Popular Culture |date=2008 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748631872 |page=165}}</ref>

The band debuted in February 1996 with the "Tuner"/"Lower" single and by the end of the year they received 'single of the week' from ''[[NME]]'' for "Summer", a feat repeated early in 1997 with "New Paths to Helicon".<ref name="Strong" /> After playing a few shows the band expanded with the introduction of [[John Cummings (musician)|John Cummings]] on guitar, and then [[Teenage Fanclub]] drummer [[Brendan O'Hare]] joined while they recorded their debut album ''[[Mogwai Young Team]]''.<ref name="Strong" />

===''Mogwai Young Team ''(1995–1997)===
The album, released in October 1997, reached No. 75 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and featured a guest appearance from [[Aidan Moffat]] of [[Arab Strap (band)|Arab Strap]].<ref name="Strong" /> In 1998 the band had their first singles chart success with a split single with [[Magoo (band)|Magoo]] of [[Black Sabbath]] [[cover version]]s reaching No. 60 in the UK and an [[Extended play|EP]] of "Fear Satan" remixes reaching No. 57.<ref name="Strong" /> In the same year, an album of remixes of the band's tracks by the likes of [[Kevin Shields]], [[Alec Empire]], and [[Mike Paradinas|μ-ziq]] was issued (''[[Kicking a Dead Pig: Mogwai Songs Remixed]]'').<ref name="Wolk">Wolk, Douglas (1999) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=8yoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=mogwai&client=firefox-a&cd=2#v=onepage&q=mogwai&f=false Our Gang]", ''[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]'', May 1999. Retrieved 17 April 2010</ref> The band also remixed tracks for [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]] and [[Manic Street Preachers]].<ref name="Wolk" /> O'Hare was sacked after the release of the album (reportedly after upsetting the rest of the band by talking all through a performance by [[Arab Strap (band)|Arab Strap]]).<ref name="Strong" />

===''Come On Die Young ''(1998–1999)===
[[Barry Burns]] was brought in prior to the recording of ''[[Come On Die Young]]'', the band's second album. He had already played a few shows with the band, as a [[flautist]] and as an occasional pianist. According to Stuart, Barry was invited into the band because he was a "good laugh".<ref name="FAQ" /> The album reached No. 29 in the UK.<ref name="Strong" /> The band line up remained unchanged from 1998 until November 2015, when John Cummings left to pursue other projects. Fellow Scottish musician [[Luke Sutherland]] has contributed violin (and more recently vocals and guitar) to Mogwai's records and live performances.

===''Rock Action ''(2000–2001)===
The band's 2001 album ''[[Rock Action (album)|Rock Action]]'' gave them their highest UK album chart placing, reaching No. 23.<ref name="Strong" /> The album was less guitar-led than previously, featuring more electronics; a larger than usual number of tracks also featured vocals, guest vocalists included [[David Pajo]] of [[Slint]], [[Gruff Rhys]] of [[Super Furry Animals]] and [[Gary Lightbody]] of [[Snow Patrol]]. Shortly afterwards the band released "[[My Father My King]]", a cacophonous 20-minute song which closed their ''Rock Action''-period shows, and was billed as a companion piece to the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/1255/Mogwai-My-Father-My-King/ |title=My Father My King review |author=Scott Herren|work=[[Sputnikmusic]]|date=16 January 2005 |access-date=5 August 2011}}</ref>

===''Happy Songs For Happy People ''(2002–2003)===
Mogwai's 2003 album ''[[Happy Songs for Happy People]]'' continued the band's movement into the use of electronica and more spacious arrangements. It was the band's first album to sell in any numbers in the US, reaching No. 13 on the [[Independent Albums|Billboard Independent Albums Chart]] and even spending one week in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mogwai|chart=all}} |title=''Happy Songs for Happy People'' on Billboard |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=5 July 2003 |access-date=6 August 2011}}</ref> Reviews were generally favourable, although as [[Pitchfork Media]] said in 2008<ref name="PHIH">{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12241-the-hawk-is-howling/ |title=''The Hawk Is Howling'' review| author=Grayson Currin |work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=23 September 2008 |access-date=6 August 2011}}</ref> "...(the album's) reception ranged from middling to favorable. Some praised the band's scope, grandeur, and willingness to explore beyond the bounds of the quiet-loud-louder dynamic it had mastered; others lamented a lack of the same, alternately calling Happy Songs too soft, too small, or too stiff."

===''Mr Beast ''(2004–2006)===
[[File:mogwailive.jpg|thumb|left|Mogwai playing at [[Somerset House]], London, 7 July 2007]]

In March 2006, the album ''[[Mr Beast]]'' was released in a regular format and in a limited deluxe edition package that came with both the album on CD and a DVD documenting the recording process entitled ''[[The Recording of Mr Beast]]''. The album was described by [[Creation Records]] head [[Alan McGee]] as "probably the best art rock album I've been involved with since [[Loveless (My Bloody Valentine album)|Loveless]].

==Musical style==
The band's influences include [[Fugazi]], [[MC5]], [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[The Cure]] and post-rock pioneers [[Slint]].<ref name="Buckley">Simmonds, Jeremy: "Mogwai", in Buckley, Peter (2003) ''The Rough Guide to Rock'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|978-1-84353-105-0}}, p. 684-6</ref> Mogwai's style has easily identifiable connections to genres such as [[shoegaze]], [[math rock]], and [[art rock]]. Debut album ''Mogwai Young Team'' was described as "stunningly dynamic...[shifting] seamlessly from tranquil, bleakly beautiful soundscapes to brain scrambling white noise and sledgehammer riffing".<ref name="Strong" /> [[Douglas Wolk]], writing for ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]'' in 1999 said of the band: "Their compositions have gotten increasingly drawn-out and austere over time, sometimes barely more than a single [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated chord]] or two evolving for ten minutes or more, whisperingly brutal in a way that recalls Slint more than any other band".<ref name="Wolk" /> Barry Burns once stated in an interview that he and the rest of the band do not like the categorisation of post-rock because he believes it over-analyses everything.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLiZEVKED8Y#t=2m46s| title = Chillville Interviews Mogwai| access-date = 27 November 2009| publisher = Chillville.com| date = 12 September 2008}}</ref>

Their strong international fanbase is based, in part, on the band's music being largely lyric-free.<ref name="Ind20151025">{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/post-rock-legends-mogwai-re-gain-popularity-thanks-to-hit-drama-the-returned-a6706407.html |title=Mogwai get new lease of life thanks to hit drama The Returned |date=2015-10-25 |website=The Independent |access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> Braithwaite has commented on the absence of lyrics in most of Mogwai's music, saying:
{{quote|I think most people are not used to having no lyrics to focus on. Lyrics are a real comfort to some people.
