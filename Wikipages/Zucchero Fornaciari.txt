The first song he played to Fornaciari was ''[[(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay]]'' by [[Otis Redding]], and this immediately inspired his interest in soul music. The friend taught Fornaciari how to play on the guitar songs by Redding, [[Marvin Gaye]], and [[Sam & Dave]].<ref name="Strait1997"/><ref name="Romanzo2011"/> Fornaciari then got together with friends to play [[rhythm and blues]], finding his own way to fuse [[black music]] and Mediterranean music.<ref name="Strait1997"/> He started writing his own songs when he was 13 or 14 years old, and after learning basic instruments, from 16 he moved on to learning the [[tenor saxophone]]. In Forte dei Marmi, he finished his technical high school studies,<ref name="Biografia"/> and moved again, this time to the city of [[Carrara]].<ref name="Libro"/>

==Musical career==

===1970–1989: Early career, success in Italy with ''Blue's'' and ''Oro Incenso & Birra''===
His musical [[career]] began in 1970, with several small bands such as I Duca, Le nuove luci, I Decals, Sugar & Daniel, Sugar & Candies. At that time, he  was studying [[veterinary medicine]]; although he liked animals and the course (taking 39 out of the 51 exams),<ref name="Libro"/> he wanted to be different from his parents and withdrew from the course in order to pursue his aspirations.<ref name="Libro"/> In 1975, he went to [[San Francisco]], and there met the then-young Corrado Rustici from [[Naples]], his future record producer. They talked about a future collaboration on a project with Afro-American influences which was then unusual for Italy <ref name="Strait1997"/><ref name="Biografia"/>

In 1979, Zucchero wrote "Tutto di te" by [[Fred Bongusto]], and the hit "Te ne vai" by Michele Pecora.<ref name="Libro"/> He found initial success with a band named Taxi, with whom he won the [[Castrocaro Music Festival]] in 1981.<ref name="Libro"/> He made his first appearance in the famous [[Sanremo Music Festival]] in 1982 with the song "Una notte che vola via" but without success.<ref name="SanremoEncyclopedia">{{cite book |last=Giannotti |first=Marcello |date=2005 |title=L'enciclopedia di Sanremo: 55 anni di storia del festival dalla A alla Z |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1HE8o8RTXgC |language=it |publisher=Gremese Editore |pages=85, 106, 226 |isbn=9788884403797}}</ref> However, he wrote and produced the festival hit song "Lisa" by Stefano Sani.<ref name="Libro"/> In the 1983 festival, he had a similar success with "Nuvola", and went on to write four other festival songs, including "Volevo dirti", sung by Donatella Milani, which was placed second.<ref name="Libro"/><ref name="SanremoEncyclopedia"/> His first album, ''[[Un po' di Zucchero]]'', was released the same year with moderate success.<ref name="Libro"/> Although as a young songwriter, he had great success, his solo career did not initially reach the same level of success that he and producers had expected.<ref name="Libro"/>

Disappointed with his solo career, in 1984 he temporarily moved to [[San Francisco]] in [[California]], where he collaborated with his old friend Corrado Rustici.<ref name="BioBluesSingers"/><ref name="Libro"/> The result of these sessions, with a backing band that included bassist [[Randy Jackson]], was the 1985 album ''Zucchero & The Randy Jackson Band'', and the song "Donne" (in English, "Women").<ref name="BioBluesSingers"/> He again played at the Sanremo festival and, although the song "Donne" ended up in a disappointing penultimate place (due to the festival critics), it became a hit single and one of the classic Italian songs.<ref name="Libro"/><ref name="SanremoEncyclopedia"/> After the relative success of ''Zucchero & The Randy Jackson Band'', Fornaciari joined Rustici again in California to work on a follow-up album.  ''[[Rispetto]]'' (1986) (in English, "Respect") included several Italian hit singles, including the title track and "Come il sole all'improvviso" (in English, "Suddenly, like the sun"). It went platinum and sold over 300,000 copies.<ref>{{cite news |title=Quando il rock si mette la maschera |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,16/articleid,0971_01_1987_0051_0017_13322852/ |date=1 March 1987 |language=it |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |access-date=2 March 2016 |quote=addirittura pronto a ricevere il disco di plation, a suggellare dodici messi di meritato successo}}</ref>

Although ''Zucchero & The Randy Jackson Band'' and ''Rispetto'' were commercially successful, it was the 1987 album ''[[Blue's]]'' that went on to become the highest selling album in Italian history (until his following album in 1989),<ref name="BioBluesSingers"/> selling 1.5 million copies in 1987 alone; it made Fornaciari a household name in Italy, and neighbouring countries.<ref name="Strait1997"/> The album, again produced by Rustici and featuring musical performances by [[Clarence Clemons]], [[The Memphis Horns]] and [[David Sancious]], included the Italian hit singles "Con Le Mani" (in English, "With the hands"), with lyrics by [[Gino Paoli]], the controversial "Solo una sana..." (in English "Only a healthy...."), and the original version of "[[Senza una donna]]" (in English, "Without a woman") which later became an international hit in a duet version with [[Paul Young (singer and guitarist)|Paul Young]]. During the following Blue's Tour Fornaciari shared the stage with [[Joe Cocker]] (for a cover of "[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]"), [[Ray Charles]] and [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]]. In the same year, he also composed the soundtrack for the film ''[[Snack Bar Budapest]],'' written and directed by [[Tinto Brass]].<ref name="Libro"/>

In 1989, Fornaciari and his band recorded the album ''[[Oro Incenso & Birra]]'' in Memphis. The album, which was greatly influenced by American soul music, included guest appearances by [[Ennio Morricone]], [[Eric Clapton]], and blues singer [[Rufus Thomas]]; Fornaciari's band by that time included former [[E-Street Band]] member [[David Sancious]].<ref name="Libro"/> The album still stands as not only one of Fornaciari's, but also Italian most successful albums, outselling even ''Blue's'' and includes the Italian hit singles "Diamante" (lyrics written by [[Francesco De Gregori]], dedicated to Zucchero's grandmother Diamante), "Overdose (d'Amore)", "Il Mare" and "Wonderful World".<ref>{{cite web |title=Zucchero: Oggi È Il 25esimo Compleanno di "Oro, Incenso & Birra" |url=http://www.radioitalia.it/news/zucchero/evento/8458_zucchero_oggi_e_il_25esimo_compleanno_di_%E2%80%9Coro_incenso_birra%E2%80%9D.php |date=13 June 2014 |language=it |publisher=Radio Italia |access-date=2 March 2016 |quote=album che detiene ancora oggi il record come il disco più venduto della musica italiana}}</ref> The single "Diamante" included new version of the song "Dune Mosse" recorded along [[Miles Davis]].

===1990–2009: International success with ''Miserere'', ''SpiritoDiVino'', ''Bluesugar'', ''Shake'', ''Fly''===
After the million selling success of ''Blue's'' and ''Oro Incenso & Birra'' in Italy, and his live collaborations with Joe Cocker, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], Eric Clapton (whom supported on tour and performed at [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]]) and Miles Davis,<ref name="Libro"/> Fornaciari from 1990 on attempted to conquer the rest of Europe. The album ''Blue’s'' was released the following year in the United Kingdom, and in 1990 ''Zucchero Sings His Hits in English'', an album that featured songs from the ''Blue's'' and ''Oro Incenso & Birra'' albums, some of which translated to English by Frank Musker, was released worldwide.

{{quote box|width=36%|align=right|quote="When I do the English version of a song, I lose something. I would like to find a way to translate my songs from Italian to English better, because my lyrics are very personal and I use a lot of slang, the typical Italian way to say something. When they translate this, you lose the sarcasm or irony. People in England and America only know me for ballads, but my fast songs are very sarcastic. I'm really more like [[Tom Waits]] or [[Charles Bukowski]] than [[Whitney Houston]]".|source=— Zucchero, on the advice by record producers to translate songs to English to achieve international popularity.<ref name="Strait1997"/>}}

Fornaciari's best known hit "[[Senza una donna]]" ("Without a Woman"), in a [[duet]] with [[Paul Young (singer and guitarist)|Paul Young]], is from this album. The first pressing of the album didn't feature the duet: the song was performed by Fornaciari only. The duet was a great success worldwide,<ref name="Strait1997"/> it topped the [[European Hot 100 Singles|European Hot 100]], Italian, Belgian, Norwegian, and Swedish charts, and reached the top 3–5 in other international charts in 1991 including UK and US.<ref name="November 1992">{{cite journal |last=Duffy |first=Thom |date=28 November 1992 |title=The Language Of Zucchero |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRAEAAAAMBAJ |journal=Billboard |volume=104 |issue=48 |pages=42 |access-date=2 March 2016}}</ref> Other European singles from the Hits album include English versions of "Diamante", and "Wonderful World" (with Eric Clapton). Diamante was later released as a duet with [[Randy Crawford]], a variant not available on any album until the special edition of ''[[Zu & Co.]]'' (2004). Although advised to record in English to achieve international popularity he expressed doubt; "unfortunately, the only songs you can translate easily into English are the ballads, the love songs. That is a shame".<ref name="Strait1997"/><ref name="November 1992"/>

Between 1991 and 1993 Fornaciari continued duetting with some of the world's most famous artists, such as [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], a young [[Andrea Bocelli]] (who after the Zucchero's collaboration on "Miserere" started to get growing popularity<ref>{{cite book |last=High |first=Caroline |date=2015 |title=For the Love of Classical Music: A Companion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goyhCgAAQBAJ |publisher=Summersdale Publishers LTD - ROW |isbn=9781783726509}}</ref>), [[Peter Maffay]], [[Elton John]], [[Brian May]] and Eric Clapton. Many of these duets would later be included in the compilation ''Zu & Co.'' (2004).

In 1992 Fornaciari released the million selling album ''[[Miserere (album)|Miserere]]''. Again produced by Corrado Rustici, it was a much darker album than Fornaciari's previous works, which was made clear by the title track "Miserere" (Have Mercy), a duet with [[Luciano Pavarotti]].<ref name="November 1992"/> The "darkness" reflects his intimate personal life from the time when lived in solitude and depression after the divorce.<ref name="Repubblica12013"/><ref name="Biografia"/> [[Elvis Costello]] co-wrote the track "Miss Mary", [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] was responsible for the English version of the "Miserere", and Paul Buchanan of [[The Blue Nile]] co-wrote two tracks.<ref name="Libro"/> On the album and during the tour, Fornaciari was accompanied by former [[Santana (band)|Santana]] drummer [[Michael Shrieve]].
