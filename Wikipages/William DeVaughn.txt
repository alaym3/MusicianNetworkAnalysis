'''William Edward DeVaughn Jr.''' (born November 28, 1947, in Washington, D.C.)<ref>[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=1&new=1&MSAV=1&msT=1&gss=angs-g&gsfn=William+Edward&gsln=DeVaughn&msbdy=1948&msbpn__ftp=Washington%2c+USA&msbpn=50&msbpn_PInfo=5-%7c0%7c1652393%7c0%7c2%7c3248%7c50%7c0%7c0%7c0%7c0%7c&cpxt=1&catBucket=rstp&uidh=jq5&msbdp=5&cp=12&pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&h=61213101&db=USpublicrecords3&indiv=1] {{dead link|date=August 2015}}</ref> is an American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[Soul music|soul]] singer, songwriter and guitarist, best known for the million-selling [[hit record|hit]] song "[[Be Thankful for What You Got]]" in 1974.

==Biography==
DeVaughn was a salaried government employee as a drafting technician, and a part-time singer.<ref>Drafting technician: Nathan, citing an unspecified 1974 issue of the British magazine ''[[Blues & Soul]].'' Singer: Nathan, citing an unspecified 1980 interview in ''Blues and Soul.''</ref> He wrote a song called "A Cadillac Don't Come Easy", which was eventually re-written to become "Be Thankful for What You Got", in 1972. He spent $900 towards getting it recorded with Omega Sound, a Philadelphia production house. The record's producer at Omega, John Davis (a member of the MFSB studio session group), came up with a smooth arrangement, eventually booking time to record at [[Sigma Sound Studios]] in Philadelphia, used by [[Philadelphia International Records]]. Studio owner and chief engineer Joe Tarsia recorded and mixed the track.

The session featured members of the [[MFSB]] group – guitarists [[Norman Harris (musician)|Norman Harris]] and [[Bobby Eli]], drummer [[Earl Young (drummer)|Earl Young]], [[vibraphone|vibraphonist]] [[Vince Montana]] and percussionist Larry Washington; secured by [[Allan Felder]], who also developed the separate ad-lib back-up chorus with his sister's vocal group. John Davis played keyboards on the track. Frank Fioravanti, the executive producer and co-ordinator, secured the song's release on Roxbury Records, a subsidiary of [[Chelsea Records]], run by industry veteran [[Wes Farrell]].

The [[gramophone record|record]] sold nearly two million copies on its release in spring 1974, reaching No. 1 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] and No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>Chart positions and sales figure: Nathan.</ref> The track saw two chart entries in the UK, with the record peaking at #31 (1974) and also #44 (1980), in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

}}</ref> With a sound and content influenced by [[Curtis Mayfield]], its simple and encouraging [[lyrics]] hit home, to the extent that it became featured on [[gospel music|gospel]] radio stations. When his success as a recording artist seemed guaranteed, DeVaughn quit his government job.

DeVaughn released an album, mainly of songs with a religious character, and its second single, "Blood Is Thicker than Water", reached No. 10 R&B and No. 43 pop later in 1974; "Give the Little Man a Great Big Hand" had only minor R&B chart success early the following year.<ref>Nathan.</ref> Live, DeVaughn preached to and admonished his audience from the stage. He lost interest in the [[music industry]] not long afterwards, working in a record store and again as a draftsman.

Fioravanti destined DeVaughn's 1980 effort, named after a new song by DeVaughn, ''Figures Can't Calculate'' to TEC Records in Philadelphia.  The title song climbed to No. 37 in the Billboard R&B chart, and a remake of "Be Thankful for What You Got" was also included on the album. The album was co-produced by Fioravanti, Pal Rakes, and Louis deLise and arranged and conducted by deLise. Soon after, DeVaughn recorded a Fioravanti-co-written tune, "Creme de Creme," released on the [[Houston Connection Recording Corporation]] label in the U.S.,<ref name= "Discogs">[https://www.discogs.com/William-DeVaughn-Cr%C3%A8me-De-Cr%C3%A8me/master/193613 William DeVaughn- "Creme de Creme" @Discogs.com] Retrieved June 24, 2017.</ref> Excaliber in the UK, and Red Bus in Europe.

In 2004, DeVaughn released a new single, "I Came Back", on his own Mighty Two Diamond Records.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 2014, two previously unreleased DeVaughn tracks, "Staying Power" and "Love Ballad of the Year" were included on the Sound Gems Records oldies compilation ''Lost Soul Gems''.  In December 2016, an additional previously unreleased track, "Love in Any Language" was added to the ''Lost Soul Gems'' collection. All of these later tracks were written by Fioravanti and others.

On May 12, 2017, a two-song medley, "What Does It Take (to Win Your Love for Me)" & "I Gotta Dance To Keep From Crying" was released on Sound Gems Records.
