'''Buster''' were an [[England|English]] [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed on [[the Wirral]], near [[Liverpool]], in 1972.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1972–77)===
Buster was formed in March 1972 on the Wirral, near Liverpool, England. Its original members included Pete Leay ([[lead guitar]]), Kevin Roberts ([[bass guitar]]) and Les Brians ([[drum]]s) (Rob Fennah ([[rhythm guitar]]) joined a year later). They were originally called 'The New Attraction', and began playing the cabaret circuit in north Wales. The average age of the members was thirteen.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The band released a [[limited edition]] [[Extended play|7" EP]] in January 1974. They signed to [[RCA Records|RCA]] immediately on leaving school and changed their name to 'Buster'.

In May 1976, Buster released their debut [[Single (music)|single]], "Sunday", which reached #46 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

RVC (presently [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]) which was the [[Japan]]ese division of RCA released "Sunday" in Japan in January 1977. The single was a [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[hit record|hit]]. Four further singles followed and all were Top 20 hits in Japan. At Christmastime in 1977, the band toured Japan, the [[Philippines]], [[Australia]] and [[Germany]].

Buster played live on Japanese television and performed two sell-out concerts at the [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] arena in one day. The band also picked up a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] for record sales in Japan.

In Australia the band performed as part of the Festival of Sydney in 1977, on the steps of the [[Sydney Opera House]].

===Returning to Britain and Alternative Radio (1978–82)===
In January 1978, the band arrived back in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. They had achieved five hit singles and three best selling albums overseas and expectations were high, but Buster's teenage image was outdated, and RCA and the band parted the company in 1979.

Their new manager suggested they changed their name to 'The Jax'. In 1980, on a small [[independent record label]], they released one single under this name with a [[cover version]] of "[[Bits and Pieces (song)|Bits and Pieces]]", which was originally [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] by [[The Dave Clark Five]]. The single did not make any impression, and the band split from the manager and re-grouped.

Rob Fennah had started to write songs with his younger brother, Alan, and they got a local [[pirate radio station]], Merseyland Alternative Radio (MAR), to play some of their [[Demo (music)|demos]]. The twosome also played in local [[public house|pubs]] and [[nightclub|clubs]] as the [[Duet (music)|duo]] Rob and Alan Fennah. Pete Leay left the band to concentrate on [[recording studio|studio]] recording.

During 1981, Buster's three original members Fennah, Brians and Roberts became Alternative Radio. In 1982, they decided to enter the Liverpool 'Battle of the Bands' competition, which they won. However, with only two of its original members left, Buster was officially disbanded in October 1982.

===Recent years (2008–present)===
When footage of the band turned up on the internet, there was interest in the group and demand for the re-release of old recordings. They were able to buy back the rights to the recordings, and Buster's records were produced again for the Japanese market. They also showed some of their early footage on their website.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-life-features/liverpool-arts/2008/01/15/music-brothers-tune-in-for-a-rare-performance-64375-20350186/ | title= Music: Brothers tune in for a rare performance | work=Liverpool Daily Post| first=Philip |last=Key| date=23 July 2008 |access-date=21 May 2010}}</ref>

Fennah, Leay, and Roberts were invited to the Liverpool Museum at the opening of The Beat Goes On, an exhibition of Liverpool popular music and culture. Buster are featured in the "Global Impact" section of the exhibition, in recognition of the band's success in Japan.
