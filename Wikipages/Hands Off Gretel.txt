==History==

The band was formed in 2015, Tate already having released an album as a solo artist.  A preview for a Southampton concert in the ''[[Basingstoke Gazette]]'' reported "Hands Off Gretel's frontwoman Lauren Tate has made it her mission to ensure that strong young women have a voice in today's music industry."<ref name=gazette1>{{cite web|url=https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/leisure/music/15279264.hands-off-gretel-at-the-talking-heads/|title=Hands Off Gretel at The Talking Heads|website=Basingstoke Gazette|access-date=19 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219092356/https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/leisure/music/15279264.hands-off-gretel-at-the-talking-heads/|archive-date=19 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Tate is also credited for the band's videos, album artwork, and designing of the band's merchandise.

In 2016, they released their debut album ''Burn The Beauty Queen'', which received praise from Ged Babey in ''[[Louder Than War (website)|Louder Than War]]'':  "a massive achievement and over-ambitious album which marks the start of a career that could well see them becoming as big as Nirvana, Marilyn Manson or Miley Cyrus over time….. given the breaks, and skillful management."<ref name="ltw">{{Cite web|url=https://louderthanwar.com/hands-off-gretel-burn-beauty-queen-album-review2/|title=Hands Off Gretel: Burn the Beauty Queen - Album Review|first=Ged|last=Babey|date=18 September 2016|access-date=11 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327102019/https://louderthanwar.com/hands-off-gretel-burn-beauty-queen-album-review2/|archive-date=27 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Their performance at The Great British Alternative Festival at [[Butlins]] in [[Skegness]] was reviewed by ''[[Vive Le Rock (magazine)|Vive Le Rock]]''. Reviewer Paula Frost commented on how Tate "entered with yet aother iconic look, this time dressed in gold with lines drawn across her face [...] She knows how to get the audience snapping away."<ref name="Vivegretel">Hands Off Gretel live review from The Great British Alternative Festival 2018 by Paula Frost accompanied by full page photograph of singer Lauren Tate by Gerry Underwood, ''Vive Le Rock'', Issue 58 pp102-103</ref>

A second album ''I Want The World'' was released on 29 March 2019. ''Vive Le Rock'''s Paula Frost awarded the album 8/10, commenting "It's not often you get a band who can emit intimidation and cuteness all at once."<ref>Hands Off Gretel ''I Want The World'' review by Paula Frost, ''[[Vive Le Rock]]''issue 61, p87</ref>  Later that year, Tate released a new solo album, ''Songs for Sad Girls''.<ref name=sadkerrang>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/lauren-tates-track-by-track-guide-to-her-new-album-songs-for-sad-girls/|title=Lauren Tate's Track By Track Guide To Her New Album Songs For Sad Girls|website=Kerrang!|access-date=10 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110204242/https://www.kerrang.com/features/lauren-tates-track-by-track-guide-to-her-new-album-songs-for-sad-girls/|archive-date=10 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
