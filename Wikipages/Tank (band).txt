'''Tank''' (stylized as '''TANK''') is the name of two British [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, both of which stem from a band formed in 1980 by [[Algy Ward]], a former member of [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]].<ref name="LarkinHM"/> The original band is known as part of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement. Tank was often compared to [[Motörhead]] as both bands were trios fronted by singing bassists, and played a loose, almost [[punk rock|punk]]-styled metal music with often colourful lyrics.<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{cite web |title= NWOBHM Encyclopedia |url= http://www.tankfilthhounds.net/nwobhmenc.htm |access-date=20 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= The Collector's Guide To Heavy Metal Volume 2: The Eighties |last= Popoff, Martin |author-link= Martin Popoff |year= 2005 |publisher= Collector's Guide Publishing |location= Toronto |isbn= 1-894959-31-0 |page= 350 }}</ref>

After legal and creative disputes, Algy Ward led one version of the group while guitarists Mick Tucker and Cliff Evans led the other. 

==History==
[[File:Tank Port Talbot 1982.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Tank performing live in 1982]]
Their 1982 debut album, ''[[Filth Hounds of Hades]]'', was positively received by both punk and metal fans as well as most critics, regarded now as one of the best albums of the NWOBHM movement.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} AllMusic critic, Eduardo Rivadavia; described it as "Tank's best album ever, and qualifying it as an essential item in the record collection of any serious '80s metal fan."<ref>{{cite web|author=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/filth-hounds-of-hades-mw0000809101 |title=Filth Hounds of Hades - Tank &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=26 July 2014}}</ref>

As was the case with many other bands of the era, Tank was never able to build on the promise shown by their first album. The band continued on for years through lineup changes and waning commercial fortunes before finally disbanding in 1989.<ref name="LarkinHM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=354}}</ref> Ward resurrected the band in 1997 playing tour dates around Europe and Japan for a couple of years. A new album, ''Still At War'', emerged in 2002. In August 2006, Ward reported that he was putting the finishing touches on the demos for the next Tank album, ''Sturmpanzer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=57453|title=TANK Mainman Putting Finishing Touches On 'Sturmpanzer'|website=Roadrunnerrecords.com}}</ref>

On 20 December 2008, a new lineup was announced. Guitarists Mick Tucker and Cliff Evans were joined by original drummer [[Mark Brabbs]] and former [[Bruce Dickinson]] bassist Chris Dale. Algy Ward was replaced by former [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] singer [[Doogie White]]. For 2010, the band replaced Brabbs with Voodoo Six drummer, Dave Cavill and released the new Tank album ''War Machine'', with this lineup in released in October 2010. For 2011, the band replaced Cavill with heavy metal drummer, [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]].

In February 2012, the band announced their first live DVD recorded the previous summer in Poland with additional footage to be recorded in March 2012. The band also released details of the return of former drummer, Steve Hopgood, along with details of the forthcoming album, ''War Nation''. The album was released on 4 June on Metal Mind Productions, produced by Phil Kinman at his west London studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalmind.pl/index.php?dzial=newsy&more=3514 |title=Metalmind |publisher=Metalmind.pl |date=9 March 2012 |access-date=26 July 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, it emerged that Algy Ward has resurrected his own version of the band, with all tracks on a new album called ''Breath of the Pit'' being "written, played and shouted" by Ward himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=189353 |title=Algy Ward's Tank: 'Breath Of The Pit' Cover Artwork Unveiled |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=29 April 2013 |access-date=26 July 2014}}</ref> According to Algy Ward, ''Sturmpanzer'' was to be released sometime in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALGY WARD TO RELEASE NEW TANK ALBUM 'STURMPANZER' IN 2015|url=http://www.ztmag.com/blog/news/?p=22866|work=[[Zero Tolerance (magazine)|Zero Tolerance]]|access-date=28 March 2015|date=10 October 2014}}</ref> Tank led by Tucker/Evans was scheduled to release their third album that year as well. The album, called ''Valley of Tears'', was scheduled to be released on 9 June, but was pushed back to 18 September.<ref>{{cite web|title=TANK: 'Valley Of Tears' Artwork, Track Listing Unveiled|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/tank-valley-of-tears-artwork-track-listing-unveiled/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=3 April 2015|date=9 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TANK's 'Valley Of Tears' Pushed Back To September|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/tanks-valley-of-tears-pushed-back-to-september/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=12 June 2015|date=29 April 2015}}</ref>

In January 2016, Ward stated that Sturmpanzer was finished and would be finally released in early 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Welcome to the Official TANK website! Hammer On!|url = http://www.tankfilthhounds.net/frames1.htm|website =Tankfilthhounds.net|access-date = 8 January 2016}}</ref> However, it was later delayed,<ref>{{cite web|title=TANK Leader ALGY WARD Confirms May Release Date For Sturmpanzer Album|url=http://bravewords.com/news/tank-leader-algy-ward-confirms-may-release-date-for-sturmpanzer-album|website=Bravewords.com|access-date=31 December 2017|date=22 December 2017}}</ref> and finally released in November 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.angrymetalguy.com/tank-sturmpanzer-review/|title=Tank - Sturmpanzer Review|first=Huck N.|last=Roll|website=Angrymetalguy.com|date=13 November 2018}}</ref>

In June 2019, the Tucker-Evans Tank embarked on their debut Australian tour (the first visit of Tank in general to the country), co-headlining with [[Girlschool]] and [[Raven (band)|Raven]], after [[Venom Inc.]] had to pull out due to health reasons.
