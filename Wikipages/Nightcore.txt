A '''nightcore''' edit is a version of a track that increases the pitch and speeds up the pace of its source material by 10–35%. This gives an effect similar to playing a [[LP record|33.3 RPM vinyl record]] at [[Single (music)#7-inch format|45 RPM]]. The name is derived from Nightcore, a Norwegian duo who released pitch-shifted versions of [[Trance music|trance]] and [[eurodance]] songs. Nightcore is also commonly associated and accompanied with [[anime]], with many [[YouTube]] thumbnails of nightcore remixes containing anime characters and art, and this practice is a standard among fans of a popular song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Summers |first1=Joan |title=What the Hell Is Nightcore, the Manic Music Genre That Somehow Keeps My Freak-Outs in Check? |url=https://jezebel.com/what-the-hell-is-nightcore-the-manic-music-genre-that-1845026968 |website=Jezebel |access-date=2020-09-12 |language=en-us}}</ref>

==History==
===2000s: Origins===
The nightcore term was first used in 2001 as the name for a school project by [[Norway|Norwegian]] DJ duo Thomas S. Nilsen and Steffen Ojala Søderholm, known by their stage names as DJ TNT and DJ SOS respectively. The name, Nightcore, means "we are the core of the night, so you'll dance all night long", stated in their website named "''Nightcore is Hardcore''".<ref name="biography">{{cite web|url=http://www2.hemsida.net/steffie/nightcore/biography.html|title=:!: Nightcore is Hardcore :!: biography|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070902142730/http://www2.hemsida.net/steffie/nightcore/biography.html|archive-date=2007-09-02|access-date=2016-10-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> The two were influenced by pitch-shifted vocals in German group [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]]'s hardcore songs "[[Nessaja]]" and "[[The Logical Song#Scooter version|Ramp! (The Logical Song)]]", stating in an interview that "There were so few of these kinds of artists, we thought that mixing music in our style would be a pleasure for us to listen to" and "Nightcore has become a style of music, a way to make the music happier – 'happy hardcore' as they say."<ref name="interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesupersuper.com/featured/nightcore-interview/|title=NIGHTCORE INTERVIEW <nowiki>|</nowiki> SUPERSUPER!

The duo set a template of a track in the style: a 25–30% sped-up (commonly to around 160 to 180 [[tempo (music)|beats per minute]]) of a [[trance (music)|trance]] or [[eurodance]] song.<ref name = "NESTHQ"/> The nightcore music has been compared to [[happy hardcore]] and bubblegum bass due to its fast tempos, energetic feel and high-pitched vocals.<ref name="NESTHQ" /><ref name="DanceMusicNW">Harshman, Heath (July 25, 2015).

Nightcore's works started appearing on services such as [[LimeWire]] in mid-2003, and [[YouTube]] in 2006. The first nightcore track to appear on the latter site was "Dam Dadi Doo" by the duo. Only two of the project's albums have surfaced on the Internet.<ref name = "NESTHQ"/> One of the first people to distribute nightcore music on [[YouTube]] was a user going by the name Maikel631, starting in 2008. He first uploaded around 30 original tracks by Nightcore on the website. In 2009, he found a "new" nightcore track, as well as the technique to make material in the style: {{quote|I came to the realization that Nightcore songs could be made by everyone, using reasonably simple audio software. I was at least one of the first people to really use that knowledge to make Nightcore edits. oShyGuyzo did this before me with Nightcore II. Another channel which I followed and started exploring fan-made Nightcore around the same time was Nasinocinesino.<ref name = "NESTHQ"/>}}

===2010s: Popularity===
One of the first major nightcore videos was for [[Rockefeller Street]], a song by [[Getter Jaani]] performed at [[Eurovision 2011]]. The song became an internet meme after the nightcore version was posted to [[YouTube]] by a user known as "Andrea", who was known as an ''[[Osu!]]'' player.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rockefeller Street|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rockefeller-street|access-date=2021-05-26|website=Know Your Meme}}</ref> From there, the music rose in popularity with more people applying the nightcore treatment to more non-dance genres such as [[pop music]] and [[hip-hop]]. Many of the pioneer uploaders of nightcore including Maikel631 have called these non-dance edits "fake".<ref name = "NESTHQ"/> The nightcore scene then crossed over to [[SoundCloud]] with the help of artist lilangelboi, who had released around ten to fifteen edits on the service before being signed to Manicure Records. The head of Manicure, Tom "Ghibli" Mike, recalled, "I just got totally obsessed with it. I put up that one he did, "Light", we had him up here to DJ a few parties, and then he moved here. That was totally how nightcore became a thing for us."<ref name = "NESTHQ"/> The label's #MANICURED playlist consisted of nightcore renditions of [[K-pop]] and [[electro house]] tracks, a few of them also incorporating production techniques outside of pitch-shifting and speeding up the source material, such as "Mile High" by Chipped Nails and Ponibbi and "Fave Hours" by F I J I.<ref name = "NESTHQ"/>

By the mid-2010s, the nightcore scene had garnered attention from musicians such as [[Djemba Djemba]], Maxo and Harrison, [[Nina Las Vegas]], [[Ryan Hemsworth]], [[Lido (musician)|Lido]], Moistbreezy, and [[PC Music]] founders [[Danny L Harle]] and [[A. G. Cook]].<ref name = "NESTHQ"/> Harle and Cook have claimed nightcore to be influences in interviews,<ref name = "NESTHQ"/> the former saying in an interview, {{quote|From the second I first heard it, it's been so intensely emotional for me to listen to. I don't feel like it's an interaction from another human to me, it's just MP3 sound making me feel emotional in my head. With that kind of stuff, it's just a representation of heightened emotion for me.<ref>Graham (June 1, 2015).

Like that iconic, oft-sampled sound, nightcore's inescapable appeal lies in loud, brash, low-brow fun, a heart-pounding blunderbuss of gooey, candy-coated sounds. It's an artifact indebted to an earlier, less formalized internet, one where file-sharing and forum culture reigned supreme, and where many aspiring producers first experienced the thrill of connecting with a larger community online."<ref name="THUMP">Arcand, Rob (August 15, 2016).

Dance Music Northwest described nightcore as "too catchy, too danceable, and far too much fun to not welcome into the dance music mainstream."<ref name = "DanceMusicNW"/> David Turner of [[MTV]] described a nightcore remix of "[[7 Years (Lukas Graham song)|7 Years]]" by [[Lukas Graham]] as the same as "the normal [...] song" and "[[plagiarism]]".<ref name=MTV>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2886505/lukas-graham-7-years-remixes/ |last=Turnet |first=David |title=Seven '7 Years' EDM Remixes for Your Memorial Day Weekend |date=May 27, 2016 |access-date=September 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915001749/http://www.mtv.com/news/2886505/lukas-graham-7-years-remixes/ |archive-date=2018-09-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>
