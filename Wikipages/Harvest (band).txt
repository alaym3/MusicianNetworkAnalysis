</ref>  Williams spent some time playing the guitar on Texas streets before becoming a pastor in Bloomington, [[Indiana]].<ref name="Herald" />   

Along with Jerry Williams, the original members of Harvest were Ed Kerr and Paul Wilbur, both of whom were music students.<ref name="Works" /> Wilbur had met Williams at a church where Williams was the youth pastor, and Williams had been influential in Wilbur's decision to become a Christian.<ref name="CBN">

</ref> Ed Kerr, who graduated from Indiana University with an M.A. in piano performance, was a mutual friend of both Williams and Wilbur.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kerrtunes.com {{!}} Resources For Worship Musicians|url=https://www.kerrtunes.com/about/|access-date=2021-10-14|website=www.kerrtunes.com}}</ref><ref name="CBN" /> Kerr met Williams at a rally at [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] and made a decision to become a Christian afterwards.<ref name="Herald" />  The three men collaborated on the first two albums created by Harvest: ''Harvest'' and ''Morning Sun''. 

Later in 1981, personal problems forced Williams to disband the original Harvest group, which at one time had numbered five.<ref name="Kentucky" /> The group was reformed as a duo of Williams and Kerr.<ref name="lighthouse" /> Williams and Kerr were together for the production of many records, including ''It's Alright Now'', ''Send Us to the World'', ''Voices'', ''Only the Overcomers'', ''Give Them Back'', ''Holy Fire'' and ''Carry On''. In 1982 the magazine ''[[CCM Magazine|CCM]]'' took notice of the duo in its article, "A Bountiful Harvest."<ref name="CCM">{{cite news

The writer praised the group's vocal harmonies and was especially fond of the song "Because I Am" (found on the album ''It's Alright Now'').<ref name="CCM" />

In 1988, it was the Discovery Broadcasting Network that took note of the band.  The network recorded a live video of Harvest in concert.  On the cover of the video, the network stated that Harvest averages "over 100 concerts a year."<ref name="DBN">{{cite video

By 1991, Ed Kerr left the group and Harvest became a five-player band led by Williams.<ref name="lighthouse" />  With various members,<ref name="lighthouse" /> Williams' band produced ''Let's Fight (For a Generation)'', ''Mighty River'', and ''41 Will Come''.  In 1992 the band went on an "Olympic and European Tour."  They performed in Spain at the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] and at the Sevilla [[Seville Expo '92|World Expo]].  Their tour also took them into Germany as part of [[Operation Mobilisation]]'s "Love Europe" crusade.  Harvest finished its tour with a performance in the Netherlands.

==Music Style==
According to Jerry Williams in 1988, Harvest's sound is "light middle-of-the-road to light contemporary rock."<ref name="Kentucky" />  He described it as hard to classify because it was a real mixture of styles.<ref name="Kentucky" />  The group sound incorporated a little bit of rock, some country, and really good harmonies.<ref name="Kentucky" />  Williams likened the group's harmonization to the Gatlin Brothers, who he had grown up listening to.<ref name="Kentucky" />  Williams also said that "Every time people have tried to figure out who we sound like, we sound like Harvest.  There's really no one else who sounds like us."<ref name="Kentucky" />  But, when pressed to liken the band's sound to another's style, Williams would say the band's style was similar to that of Christian performer Wayne Watson.<ref name="Kentucky" />
