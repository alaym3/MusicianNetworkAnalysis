'''Chad Lamont Butler''' (December 29, 1973 – December 4, 2007), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Pimp C''', was an American rapper and record producer. He was best known for his work with [[Bun B]] as one half of the hip-hop duo [[UGK|Underground Kingz (UGK)]].

Signing to [[Jive Records]] in 1992, UGK released their major-label debut album ''[[Too Hard to Swallow]]'' to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_toohardtoswallow.html |title=U.G.K.

The group went on hiatus for the first half of the 2000s after Pimp C was sentenced to eight years in prison for a probation violation. During this time both members pursued solo careers, with Pimp C releasing his solo debut, ''[[Sweet James Jones Stories|The Sweet James Jones Stories]]'', in 2005, composed of material recorded prior to his sentencing. After being released from prison in December 2005, he released his second solo album, ''[[Pimpalation]]'', in 2006. UGK released their [[Underground Kingz|eponymous fifth studio album]] in 2007, which spawned the hit single "[[International Players Anthem (I Choose You)]]" featuring [[OutKast]], which peaked at #70 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

Pimp C was found dead in his hotel room on December 4, 2007, with a coroner's report allegedly attributing his death to complications stemming from heavy consumption of [[purple drank]] and his pre-existing condition of [[sleep apnea]].<ref name="ksanneh">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/arts/music/05pimpc.html|title=Pimp C, Southern Hip-Hop Rapper, Dies at 33|first=Kelefa|last=Sanneh|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 5, 2007}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofthegulfcoast.org/ugk|title=UGK|work=Museum of the Gulf Coast|access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Chad Lamont Butler was born December 29, 1973, in [[Crowley, Louisiana]], but was raised in [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. Butler was the only child of Charleston Butler and Weslyn "Mama Wes" Butler Jacob Monroe.<ref name="boxden.com">{{Cite web|url=https://boxden.com/showthread.php?t=1018261|title=Dec 13 - OBITUARY for: Mr. Chad Lamont Butler "Pimp C"|website=boxden.com}}</ref> Butler was born prematurely and suffered numerous health issues, including a birth defect that caused his legs to point inward, which required braces to fix. He also had to be propped up when he slept due to digestive problems.<ref name="jamfeed.com"/> His eyesight was poor, and he almost went blind after a severe bout of [[pinkeye]]. Butler also suffered from [[pneumonia]] at least nine times as a child.<ref name="jamfeed.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamfeed.com/news/2015/09/30-things-i-learned-from-reading-weet-jone-pimp-cs-trill-life-story/|title=30 Things I Learned From Reading '$weet Jone$: Pimp C's Trill Life Story'|date=September 10, 2015}}</ref>

As the son of a trumpet player, Butler had an interest in music since childhood: "I come from a classical background, I came up singing [[Italian sonnets]], [[Negro spirituals]], and shit of that nature." Even before studying [[musical notation]] in school he learned to play many instruments by ear, including piano, trumpet, drums and flugelhorn. His vocal style was once described as "high-voiced, unstable and provocateur, as likely to slap your face as to sing you a love song." Influenced by [[Run-DMC]], he started [[Synthesizer|synthesizing]] beats to rap over after receiving a [[drum machine]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] one Christmas.<ref name=chicago>{{cite book |last=Westoff |first=Ben |title=Dirty South: OutKast, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, and the Southern Rappers Who Reinvented Hip-Hop |date=2011 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=978-1569766064 |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pgc6mAEACAAJ |access-date=3 August 2019}}</ref>

Butler joined the choir as a teenager and played numerous instruments at school, and after being encouraged by his stepfather Bill Monroe, began writing and creating his own music. Butler was particularly interested in the emerging [[hip hop music|hip hop]] genre as a child, and soon bonded and became friends with Bernard "[[Bun B]]" Freeman over their shared passion for music.<ref name="boxden.com"/>

== Music career ==

=== UGK ===
====Early career (1987–1996)====
{{Main|UGK}}
Butler formed the rap group [[UGK|Underground Kingz]] (often referred to as UGK) with best friend Bernard "[[Bun B]]" Freeman in 1987 in [[Port Arthur, Texas]].<ref>Jayson Rodriguez, [http://www.mtv.com/news/1575990/ugks-bun-b-remembers-pimp-c-it-just-wasnt-in-him-to-not-say-what-he-felt/ "UGK's Bun B Remembers Pimp C: 'It Just Wasn't In Him To Not Say What He Felt',"] [[MTV News]], December 6, 2007.</ref><ref name="ksanneh"/> Initially signed to independent label Big Tyme Recordz, the duo released two EPs, ''[[The Southern Way]]'' and ''[[Banned (EP)|Banned]]'', in 1992 to moderate local success, which lead to the group being signed to [[Jive Records]] later that year. In November, they released their major label debut, ''[[Too Hard to Swallow]]'' through Jive, which peaked at #37 on the US [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart.<ref name="vh1.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/|title=New Music Videos, Reality TV Shows, Celebrity News, Pop Culture|website=VH1}}</ref><ref name="UGK allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p133449/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=UGK – Biography|last=Bush|first=John|year=2007|publisher=allmusic|access-date=2009-05-02}}</ref><ref name="Rapreviews.com"/><ref name="Leo Stanley"/>

UGK's second album, ''[[Super Tight]]'' was released in 1994 to critical acclaim and commercial success, charting at #95 on the [[Billboard 200]] and #9 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In 1996, UGK's third album, ''[[Ridin' Dirty]]'', became their most successful, reaching #2 on the ''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #15 on the Billboard 200, receiving widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, having sold 850,000 copies to date.<ref name="vh1.com"/><ref name="UGK allmusic"/><ref name="Rapreviews.com"/><ref name="Leo Stanley"/>

====Hiatus and national attention (1996–2001)====
After taking a short hiatus from music in the late 1990s, UGK returned in 2000, appearing on [[Jay-Z]]'s smash hit single "[[Big Pimpin']]", which peaked at #18 on the [[Billboard 200]], as well as "[[Sippin' on Some Syrup]]" by [[Three 6 Mafia]], which peaked at #30 on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]. Both of these collaborations greatly increased the duo's reputation, and helped fuel anticipation for their next project. Jive Records failed to capitalize on this new-found interest in UGK, as their fourth album, ''[[Dirty Money (album)|Dirty Money]]'', was released in 2001 with little to no advertisement or promotion.

====Prison sentence and solo career (2002–2006)====

After Pimp C was sentenced to eight years in prison in August 2002, UGK was once again forced to go on hiatus, which led to both members pursuing solo careers. Pimp C's debut studio album, The ''[[Sweet James Jones Stories]]'' was released in March 2005, composed of material recorded prior to Pimp C's incarceration. After being released from prison in December 2005, Pimp C released his second solo studio album ''[[Pimpalation]]'' in July 2006 and peaked at #3 on the US [[Billboard 200]] and topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

====UGK Reunited====

On August 7, 2007, UGK reunited to release their [[Underground Kingz|eponymous fifth studio album]], debuting at #1 on both the Billboard 200 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop charts. The album was the last UGK album released during Pimp C's lifetime, and spawned the hit single "[[International Players Anthem (I Choose You)]]", and received universal acclaim from critics.<ref>{{cite web|first=David |last=Jeffries |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/underground-kingz-mw0000445788 |title=Underground Kingz - UGK |publisher=AllMusic |date=August 7, 2007 |access-date=May 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Chris |last=Schonberger |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20049671,00.html |title=Underground Kingz Review |publisher=EW.com |date=August 3, 2007 |access-date=May 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/music/cdreviews/5034476.html |title=The latest by UGK puts duo in rapper royalty |publisher=Chron.com |date=August 8, 2007 |access-date=May 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2007_08F_undergroundkingz.html |title=Feature for August 7, 2007 - UGK's "Underground Kingz" |publisher=Rapreviews.com |date=August 7, 2007 |access-date=May 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sanneh |first=Kelefa |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/arts/music/07sann.html |title=Pimp C - Bun B - UGK - Music - New York Times |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 7, 2007 |access-date=May 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829045743/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/arts/music/07sann.html |archive-date=August 29, 2011 }}</ref>

==Personal life==

Butler married his wife, Chinara, while he was in prison in 2003.<ref name="boxden.com"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.revolt.tv/2016/11/2/20817553/exclusive-pimp-c-s-wife-speaks-on-the-struggles-of-being-a-widow-in-hip-hop|title=Exclusive: Pimp C's wife speaks on the struggles of being a widow in hip-hop|first=Nadine|last=Graham|date=November 2, 2016|website=REVOLT}}</ref> They have one child together, a daughter named Christian, and he has two older sons, Chad Lamont Butler II and Dahcory Butler both of whom are from previous relationships.

==Legal issues==
On December 16, 2000, Butler was arrested in [[Houston]]'s [[PlazAmericas|Sharpstown Mall]] after allegedly holding a woman, Lakita Hulett, at gunpoint and threatening to shoot her after a confrontation in a shoe store. After both Butler and Hulett had exchanged words in the store, Hulett alleged that Butler pushed a gun into her side and said, "Bitch, I'll shoot you," before she ran away and informed police. Butler claimed he simply lifted his jacket to show the gun and did not remove it from his waistband.<ref name="Beverly">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/65zwjx/pimp-c-prisons-excerpt|title=The Story of How Pimp C Ended up in Prison|first=Julia|last=Beverly|date=September 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Pimp C allmusic"/><ref name="mtv.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1517515/ugks-pimp-c-to-be-released-from-prison-within-a-month/|title=UGK's Pimp C To Be Released From Prison Within A Month|website=MTV News}}</ref>

As Butler attempted to exit the mall and enter his car, numerous officers surrounded him and instructed him to surrender. Butler ignored the orders and was forced to the ground by officers, who handcuffed him and brought him back into the mall. Shortly after, Butler was transported to Houston Central Jail where he was charged with [[aggravated assault]] with a deadly weapon. Butler claimed police used excessive force to restrain him, and alleges they knocked him unconscious twice and refused to let doctors at a local hospital perform a routine [[CT scan]], instead transporting him straight to jail.<ref name="Beverly"/><ref name="Pimp C allmusic"/><ref name="mtv.com"/>

Butler posted $10,000 bail the following day and was initially sentenced to probation after pleading no contest in early 2001. He was sent back to prison in January 2002 after failing to report to his probation officer on several occasions, failing to keep up with his community service hours or pay outstanding court fees, as well as testing positive twice for marijuana. On August 5, 2002, Butler was sentenced to eight years in prison.<ref name="Beverly"/><ref name="Pimp C allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p114577/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Pimp C > Biography|last=Jeffries|first=David|year=2007|publisher=allmusic|access-date=2009-05-02}}</ref><ref name="mtv.com"/>

His arrest was widely protested by the hip-hop community, who along with Bun B immediately initiated a grassroots "Free Pimp C" campaign.<ref name="Obituary AP">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Obituary/article/282767|title=Chad Butler, 33: Rap musician known as Pimp C|last=Pearson|first=Ryan|date=2007-12-05|work=Toronto Star|agency=Associated Press|access-date=2009-05-02}}</ref> Butler spent the later portion of his sentence at the [[Terrell Unit]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas]] and was transferred to the [[Huntsville Unit]] a week prior to his release.<ref>"[http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/entertainment&id=3770742 Rapper Pimp C released from prison]."

== Death ==
In early December 2007, Butler had been staying at the [[Mondrian Hotel]] in [[West Hollywood, California]], where he had been working on new music and performing with [[Too $hort]]. On the morning of December 4, 2007, he was scheduled to fly back home, where his wife, Chinara, was waiting with his cousin Ed at the airport to pick him up. After not hearing from him the morning of the scheduled flight, his wife called the hotel and requested that they check on him. Hotel staff discovered Butler unresponsive in his hotel room, where he was pronounced dead shortly after. He was 25 days away from his 34th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F4fQy0Rc6Q| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/7F4fQy0Rc6Q| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title='Long Live the Pimp': A Documentary on the Life and Legacy of Pimp C - Complex|last=Complex|date=4 April 2016|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="ksanneh"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/houstonchronicle/obituary.aspx?n=chad-lamont-butler&pid=99446736&referrer=0&preview=false|title=Chad Butler Obituary - Houston, TX &#124; Houston Chronicle|website=[[Legacy.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxden.com/showthread.php?t=1018261|title=Dec 13 - OBITUARY for: Mr. Chad Lamont Butler"Pimp C"|website=boxden.com}}</ref>

The coroner's report allegedly ruled that his death was accidental, attributing it to the effects of Butler's heavy usage of "[[purple drank]]", a combination of [[codeine]] and [[promethazine]], in conjunction with his pre-existing condition of [[sleep apnea]].<ref name="auto"/><ref>Winton, Richard.

According to [[DJ Paul]] of [[Three 6 Mafia]], he got a call from Pimp C's manager, Rick Martin, who gave him the news. DJ Paul saw Pimp C's body in the hotel room, saying: "He was laying down like he was praying but there was blood around like he was shot. They thought he was shot in the head, but they didn't know what the hell happened because there was blood everywhere. They thought he was shot. He was knelt down like he was praying and the candles were all the way burnt down, so they knew he'd probably been dead for a day or so because he always lit those candles to sleep. He lit those big tall candles and they had been burnt down so he probably was dead for a while. We did the song "Rest In Peace" and that was the last song he recorded."<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq0p2Z1WkhY</ref>

Butler's body was transported back to his hometown of [[Port Arthur, Texas]], shortly after. His funeral was held at the Bob Bowers Civic Center in Port Arthur on December 13, 2007.<ref name="MTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1576462/pimp-c-is-given-uplifting-heartfelt-farewell-at-funeral/|title=Pimp C is Given Uplifting, Heartfelt Farewell at Funeral|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|work=MTV.com|date=December 13, 2007|access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref> Port Arthur Mayor Deloris Prince, Pimp C's mother Weslyn Monroe, and [[Bun B]] were among the speakers at the service.<ref name="MTV"/>

Numerous rappers paid tribute to Pimp C in the wake of his passing.
