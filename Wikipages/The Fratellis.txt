==Side projects==
During the band downtime, Jon went on to form a new band with singer/songwriter [[Lou Hickey]] called [[Codeine Velvet Club]]. He released an [[Codeine Velvet Club (album)|self-titled album]] with the band in December 2009 and toured during late 2009 and early 2010. The band came to a finish and he decided to become a solo artist. He released his debut solo album, ''[[Psycho Jukebox]]'' in 2010 and intended to release a second, titled ''[[Bright Night Flowers]]'' in 2012 but this was shelved due to the Fratellis reuniting.

Barry initially stated that he was starting his own musical project and would let Fratellis fans know about it via the Fratellis website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefratellis.com/forum/view.php?t=12168|title=the flame still burns? – Post by BarryFratelli on The Fratellis forum|website=thefratellis.com|access-date=25 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929073414/http://www.thefratellis.com/forum/view.php?t=12168|archive-date=29 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> He didn't let fans know his musical ventures until November 2011, where he revealed he had joined Birmingham band [[the Twang]], who he played with until August 2012 when he rejoined the Fratellis. He is also a regular on the DJ circuit, and still DJs now when he can.

Mince initially joined a heavy metal band called Throne o' Diablo,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/throneodiablo|title=Throne o' Diablo &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's|author=Un|publisher=Myspace.com|access-date=3 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Throne-o-Diablo/239517394648|title=Throne o' Diablo|publisher=Facebook|access-date=3 April 2012}}</ref> before leaving the band for unknown reasons. He would go on to join Jon's solo band as a second drummer, backing vocalist and occasional guitarist during live shows for his ''Psycho Jukebox'' tour.

After the recording of ''In Your Own Sweet Time'', Jon had quietly re-recorded his shelved 2012 solo album ''Bright Night Flowers'' and after the main bulk of touring was finished for ''In Your Own Sweet Time'', Jon announced his solo album would be released in February 2019, supported with two shows in London and Glasgow. His first solo shows in 6 years featured nearly the entirety of ''Bright Night Flowers'' with only one song from his previous solo album showing up along with Fratellis' favourites "Whistle for the Choir" and "Laughing Gas" in rearranged forms and a series of covers.
