[[File:SNice.svg|thumb|Example of a smiley face]]

A '''smiley''', sometimes referred to as a smiley face, is a basic [[ideogram]] that represents a smiling face. Since the 1950s it has become part of [[popular culture]] worldwide, used either as a standalone ideogram, or as a form of communication, such as [[emoticon]]s. The smiley began as two dots and a line to represent eyes and a mouth. More elaborate designs in the 1950s emerged, with noses, eyebrows, and outlines. A yellow and black design was used by the New York based radio station [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] for its ''"[[WMCA (AM)#Good Guys era|Good Guys]]"'' campaign in the early 1960s. More yellow and black designs appeared in the 1960s and 70s including works by [[Franklin Loufrani]] and [[Harvey Ross Ball]]. Today, [[The Smiley Company]] holds many rights to the smiley ideogram and has become one of the biggest licensing companies globally.

In the 1970s Loufrani trademarked the name and his design in [[France]] while he was working as a journalist for ''[[France Soir]]''. Competing terms were used such as ''smiling face'' and ''happy face'' before consensus was reached on the term ''smiley'', less often spelled "smilie".{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Today, the smiley face has evolved from an [[ideogram]] into a template for communication and use in written language. This began with [[Scott Fahlman]] in the 1980s when he first theorized [[ascii|ascii characters]] could be used to create faces and demonstrate emotion in text. Since then, those Fahlman's designs have become digital [[pictogram]]s, known as [[emoticon]]s. They are loosely based on the ideograms designed in the 1960s and 70s, continuing with the yellow and black design.

==Terminology==
The online Merriam-Webster dictionary list 1848 as the earliest known use of "smiley" as an adjective for "having a smile" or "smiling."<ref name="MWsmiley">{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smiley|title="smiley" the online Merriam-Webster dictionary|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2021-06-16}}</ref> Early designs were often called ''"smiling face"'' or ''"happy face."'' This began in 1961 with [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]]'s Good Guys, where they first incorporated a black smiley onto a yellow sweatshirt, and it was nicknamed the "happy face." The Spain brothers and [[Harvey Ross Ball]] both had designs in the 70s that concentrated more on slogans than the actual name of the smiley. 
When Ball's design was completed, it was not given an official name. It was however labeled as ''"The Smile Insurance Company"'' which appeared on the back of the badges he created. The label was due to the fact the badges were designed for commercial use for an insurance company. The Spain brothers used the slogan [[Have a nice day]], which is now frequently known for the slogan rather than the naming of the smiley.

The word smiley was used by [[Franklin Loufrani]] in France, when he registered his smiley design for trademark while working as a journalist for [[France Soir]] in 1971. The smiley accompanied positive news in the newspaper and eventually became the foundation for the licensing operation, [[The Smiley Company]].

The name smiley became commonly used in the 70s and 80s as the yellow and black [[ideogram]] began to appear more in [[popular culture]]. The ideogram has since been used as a foundation to create [[emoji|emoticon emoji]]s. These are digital interpretations of the smiley ideogram and have since become the most commonly used set of emojis since they adopted by [[Unicode]] in 2006 onwards. Smiley has since become a broader term that often includes both the ideogram design, but also [[emoji]]s that use the same yellow and black design.

==Ideogram history==
===Early history of smiling faces===
For thousands of years, smiling faces have been used as [[ideogram]]s and as [[pictogram]]s. In recent times, the face now known as a smiley has evolved into a well-known image and brand, recognisable for its yellow and black features. It wasn't until the 1900s that the design evolved from a basic eye and mouth design, into a more recognisable design.

The oldest known smiling face was found by a team of [[archaeology|archaeologists]] led by Nicolò Marchetti of the [[University of Bologna]]. Marchetti and his team pieced together fragments of a [[Hittites|Hittite]] pot from approximately 1700 BC that had been found in [[Karkamış]], [[Turkey]]. Once the pot had been pieced together, the team noticed that the item had a large smiling face engraved on it, becoming the first item with such a design to be found.<ref>{{cite news |last=Borschel-Dan  |first=Amanda |date=19 July 2017 |title=History's 'oldest smile' found on 4,000-year-old pot in Turkey |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/historys-oldest-smile-found-on-4000-year-old-pot-in-turkey/ |work=The Times of Israel |access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref>

The Danish poet and author [[Johannes V. Jensen]] was amongst other things famous for experimenting with the form of his writing. In a letter sent to publisher Ernst Bojesen in December 1900, he includes both a happy face and a sad face.

One of the first commercial uses of a smiling face was in 1919, when the Buffalo Steam Roller Company in [[Buffalo, New York]] applied stickers on receipts with the word ''"thanks"'' and a smiling face above it. The face contained a lot of detail, having eyebrows, nose, teeth, chin and facial creases, reminiscent of "man-in-the-moon" style characteristics.

Another early commercial use of a smiling face was in 1922 when the Gregory Rubber Company of Akron, Ohio ran an ad for "smiley face" balloons in The Billboard This smiley face had hair, a nose, teeth, pie eyes, and triangles over the eyes.<ref name="ad1">{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:The_Billboard_1922-03-18-_Vol_34_Iss_11_(IA_sim_billboard_1922-03-18_34_11).pdf&page=28|title="The Gregory Rubber Co Toys ad on page 20 of The Billboard March 18, 1922"|website=commons.wikimedia.org|access-date=2021-06-16}}</ref>

[[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1948 film ''[[Port of Call (1948 film)|Port of Call]]'' includes a scene where the unhappy Berit draws a ''sad'' face {{ndash}} closely resembling the modern "frowny", but including a dot for the nose {{ndash}} in lipstick on her mirror, before being interrupted.<ref>''Ingmarbergman.se''. [http://ingmarbergman.se/sites/default/files/hamnstad_1948-26_005_huvudbild_webb.jpg A still from the scene].</ref> In 1953 and 1958, similar happy faces were used in promotional campaigns for the films ''[[Lili]]'' (1953) and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958).

===The yellow and black happy face===
Despite the use of smiling faces in popular culture during the early 20th century in the [[United States]], no one in the 1960s had commercialised a smiley-design. The first time a combination of yellow and black was used for a smiling face was in late 1962, when New York City radio station WMCA released a yellow sweatshirt as part of a marketing campaign.<ref name=billboard>{{cite web |title=Focus on Deejay Scene |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRgEAAAAMBAJ&q=WMCA+sweatshirt+1962&pg=PA34 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=34 |date=15 December 1962}}</ref> By 1963, over 11,000 sweatshirts had been given away. They had featured in [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]] and numerous celebrities had also been pictured wearing them, including actress [[Patsy King]] and [[Mick Jagger]].<ref>{{cite web |title=New York "Good Guys" show |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwsEAAAAMBAJ&dq=WMCA+sweatshirt&pg=PA31 |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=July 20, 1963}}</ref> The radio station used the happy face as part of a competition for listeners. When the station called listeners, any listener who answered their phone "WMCA Good Guys!" was rewarded with a "WMCA good guys" sweatshirt that incorporated the yellow and black happy face into its design.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9059885/Smileys-People-Radio-4-The-million-dollar-smile.html |title= Smiley's People (Radio 4): The million dollar smile |first= Alastair |last= Sooke |date= 3 February 2012 |work= The Telegraph |quote= [Loufrani] points out that a smiley face was a key feature of a well-known promotional campaign for a radio network on America's East Coast in the late Fifties.}}</ref><ref name=nyt2001 /><ref name=lennox /> The features of the WMCA smiley was a yellow face, with black dots as eyes and had a slightly crooked smile.

A number of [[United States]]-based designers created yellow and black happy faces over the next decade. In [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], graphic designer [[Harvey Ross Ball]] created a happy face to raise the morale of the employees at the State Mutual Life Assurance Company.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stamp|first1=Jimmy|title=Who really invented the Smiley face|date=13 March 2013|publisher=Smithsonian|location=Washington DC|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|access-date=29 May 2015}}</ref> Ball created the design in ten minutes and was paid $45 ({{Inflation|US|45|1963|fmt=eq}}). His rendition, with a bright yellow background, dark oval eyes, full smile, and creases at the sides of the mouth,<ref name=lennox/> was imprinted on more than fifty million buttons and became familiar around the world. The design is so simple that it is certain that similar versions were produced before 1963, including those cited above. However, Ball's rendition, as described here, has become the most iconic version.<ref name=nyt2001>{{cite news |first=William H. |last=Honan |author-link=William H. Honan |title=H. R.

Tenagi's design was used in an advertising campaign for Seattle-based University Federal Savings & Loan. The ad campaign was inspired by [[Lee Adams]]'s lyrics in "Put on a Happy Face" from the musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]''. Stern, the man behind this campaign, also later incorporated the Happy Face in his run for Seattle mayor in 1993.<ref name="Adams"/> The Philadelphia-based brothers, Bernard and Murray Spain, also used the design on novelty items. They focused on the slogan "have a happy day", which mutated into "[[have a nice day]]." As with Harvey Ball, they also produced happy face badges, producing over 50 million with New York button manufacturer NG Slater.<ref name="Peter Shapiro 2001, pp44-49">Peter Shapiro, "Smiling Faces Sometimes", in ''The Wire'', issue 203, January 2001, pp. 44–49.</ref>

===Evolution into the smiley===
In 1972, Frenchman Franklin Loufrani legally [[trademarked]] the use of a smiley face. He used it to highlight the good news parts of the newspaper ''[[France Soir]]''. He simply called the design "Smiley" and launched [[The Smiley Company]]. In 1996 Loufrani's son Nicolas Loufrani took over the family business and built it into a multinational corporation. Nicolas Loufrani was outwardly skeptical of [[Harvey Ball]]'s claim to creating the first smiley face. While noting that the design that his father came up with and Ball's design were nearly identical, Loufrani argued that the design is so simple that no one person can lay claim to having created it. As evidence for this, Loufrani's website points to early cave paintings found in France (dating from 2500 BC) that he claims are the first depictions of a smiley face. Loufrani also points to a 1960 radio ad campaign that reportedly made use of a similar design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|title=Who Really Invented the Smiley Face?|first=Jimmy|last=Stamp|work=Smithsonian}}</ref>

The earliest known smiley-like image in a written document was drawn by a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] notary to indicate his satisfaction with the state of his town's municipal financial records in 1635.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/smileyoldestslovakia.html |title=17th-century Emoji |last=Votruba |first=Martin |work=Slovak Studies Program |publisher=University of Pittsburgh }}</ref> The gold smiling face was drawn on the bottom of the legal document, appearing next to lawyer's Jan Ladislaides signature.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ghosh |first1=Shreesha |title=World's Oldest Emoji Discovered?

A disputed early use of the smiley in a printed text may have been in [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]]'s poem ''To Fortune'' (1648),<ref>{{cite news|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|title=The First Emoticon May Have Appeared in ... 1648|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/the-first-emoticon-may-have-appeared-in-1648/360622/|access-date=15 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|date=14 April 2014}}</ref> which contains the line "Upon my ruins (smiling yet :)". Journalist Levi Stahl has suggested that this may have been an intentional "orthographic joke", while this occurrence is likely merely the colon placed inside parentheses rather than outside of them as is standard typographic practice today: "(smiling yet):". There are citations of similar punctuation in a non-humorous context, even within Herrick's own work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/04/15/emoticon_robert_herrick_s_17th_century_poem_to_fortune_does_not_contain.html|title=Emoticon: Robert Herrick's 17th-century poem "To Fortune" does not contain a smiley face.|work=Slate Magazine|date=15 April 2014}}</ref> It is likely that the parenthesis was added later by modern editors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2014/04/smileys-emoticons-typewriter-art.html|title=smileys, emoticons, typewriter art|work=Text Patterns - The New Atlantis}}</ref>

On the [[Internet]], the smiley has become a visual means of conveyance that uses images. The first known mention on the Internet was on 19 September 1982, when [[Scott Fahlman]] from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] wrote:

{{poemquote| :
<code> I propose that<!-- sic --> the following character sequence for joke markers:
 
 :-)
 
 Read it sideways. Actually, it is probably more economical to mark
 things that are NOT jokes, given current trends. For this, use

Yellow graphical smileys have been used for many different purposes, including use in early 1980s [[video game]]s. [[Yahoo! Messenger]] (from 1998) used smiley symbols in the user list next to each user, and also as an icon for the application.  In November 2001, and later, smiley emojis inside the actual chat text was adopted by several chat systems, including Yahoo Messenger.

The smiley is the printable version of characters 1 and 2 of (black-and-white versions of) [[codepage 437]] (1981) of the first [[IBM PC]] and all subsequent PC compatible computers.

These were introduced for compatibility with the ad-hoc implementation of [[emoticon]]s by Japanese telephone carriers in unused ranges of the [[Shift JIS]] standard.
This resulted in a de facto standard in the range with lead bytes 0xF5 to 0xF9.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.fileformat.info/info/emoji/docomo.htm | title=Original Emoji from DoCoMo | publisher=FileFormat.info}}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
The smiley has now become synonymous with culture across the world. It is used for [[communication]], imagery, branding and for topical purposes to display a range of [[emotion]]s. Beginning in the 1960s, a yellow ''happy face'' was used by numerous brands in print to demonstrate happiness.

===In print===
Franklin Loufrani used the word smiley when he designed a smiling face for the newspaper he was working for at the time. The Loufrani design came in 1971, when Loufrani designed a smiley face for the newspaper, ''[[France-Soir]]''. The newspaper used Loufrani's smiley to highlight stories that they defined as ''"feel-good news."''<ref name="vice2" /> This particular smiley went onto form [[The Smiley Company]]. [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine notably used the smiley a year later in 1972 across their entire front page for the April edition of the magazine. This was one of the first instances that the smiling face had been adapted, with one of the twenty visible smileys pulling a face.<ref>{{cite news |title=Front cover of Mad |issue=150 |publisher=[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]] |date=April 1972 |pages=1}}</ref>

In the [[United States]], there were many instances of smiling faces in the 1900s. However, the first industry to mass adopt the smiley was in [[comics]] and cartoons.

The logo for and cover of the omnibus edition of the ''[[Watchmen]]'' comic book series is a smiley badge, worn by the character the Comedian, with blood splattered on it from the murder which initiates the events of the story.

===Music and film===
As music genres began to create their own cultures from the 1970s onwards, many cultures began to incorporate a smiling face into their culture. In the late 1970s, the [[United States|American]] band [[Dead Kennedys]] launched their first recording, "[[California über alles]]". The single cover was a collage aimed to look like that of a [[Nazi]] rally prior to [[World War II]]. The usual [[swastika]] banners used at rallies, was replaced on the single cover with three large smileys.<ref>Johnson, Heather. "[http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_dead_kennedys/index.html Dead Kennedys' 'California Uber Alles'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110093019/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_dead_kennedys/index.html |date=2014-11-10 }}". ''[[Mix Online]]''. 1 October 2005.</ref> In the UK, the happy face has been associated with [[psychedelic culture]] since [[Ubi Dwyer]] and the [[Windsor Free Festival]] in the 1970s and the [[electronic dance music]] culture, particularly with [[acid house]], that emerged during the [[Second Summer of Love]] in the late 1980s. The association was cemented when the band [[Bomb the Bass]] used an extracted smiley from the comic book series ''[[Watchmen]]'' on the center of its "[[Beat Dis]]" hit single.

[[File:Watchmen-smiley.svg|thumb|The ''[[Watchmen]]'' comic series logo]]

In addition to the movie adaption of the ''[[Watchmen]]'', the film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' has the character [[Deadshot]] staring into the window of a clothing store. Behind a line of mannequins is a yellow smiley face pin, which had been closely associated to another DC comic character, [[Comedian (character)|Comedian]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Steinberg |first1=Nick |title=20 Hidden Details In 'Suicide Squad' You May Have Missed |date=10 August 2016 |url=https://www.goliath.com/movies/20-hidden-details-in-suicide-squad-you-may-have-missed/ |publisher=Goliath}}</ref> The 2001 film ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'' has a three-eyed smiley for its logo. It was later carried onto the movie's spin-off cartoon, ''[[Alienators: Evolution Continues]]''.
In the ''[[Mork and Mindy]]'' episode Mork vs. the Necrotons Part 2 (Season Two, Episode 12, 1979), Mindy is kidnapped by people in a van which has the Smiley Face emblem on its side.

In the film ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' it is implied the titular character inspired the smiley face design after wiping his face on a T-shirt whilst running coast to coast.

In the late-1980s, the smiley again became a prominent image within the [[music industry]]. It was adopted during the growth of [[acid house]] across [[Europe]] and the UK in the late 1980s. According to many, this began when DJ, [[Danny Rampling]], used the smiley to celebrate [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s birthday.<ref>{{cite web |title=The strange, tangled history of the acid house smiley |url=https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/history-of-the-acid-house-smiley |publisher=[[Red Bull]]}}</ref> This sparked a movement where the smiley moved into various dance genres, becoming a symbol of 1980s dance music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Acid History: How The Smiley Became The Iconic Face Of Rave |url=https://www.electronicbeats.net/the-feed/untold-history-rave-smiley/ |work=ElectronicBeats magazine|date=5 January 2017 }}</ref>

===Physical products===
[[Vittel]] announced in 2017 that they would be using the smiley on a special edition design of its [[water bottle]]s. [[AdAge]] referred to its use as a "feel-good effect" and water bottles using the smiley icon had an 11.8% increase in sales, compared to the standard bottles, with 128 million bottles sold across Europe which featured the smiley-design.<ref name=adage>{{cite web |title=How Smiley's "Defiant Optimism" Helps Brands emerge from Darker Times |date=June 2021 |url=https://adage.com/article/smiley/how-smileys-defiant-optimism-helps-brands-emerge-dark-times/2339736 |publisher=[[AdAge]]}}</ref>

===Art and fashion===
As part of his early works, graffiti artist [[Banksy]] frequently used the smiley in his art. The first of his major works that included a smiley was his Flying Copper portrait, which was completed in 2004.

In 1997, Franklin Loufrani and Smiley World attempted to acquire trademark rights to the symbol (and even to the word "smiley" itself) in the United States. This brought Loufrani into conflict with [[Wal-Mart]], which had begun prominently featuring a happy face in its "Rolling Back Prices" campaign over a year earlier. Wal-Mart responded first by trying to block Loufrani's application, then later by trying to register the smiley face itself; Loufrani, in turn, sued to stop Wal-Mart's application, and in 2002 after the issue went to court,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4984138.stm| date=8 May 2006| title=Wal-Mart seeks smiley face rights| work=BBC News| access-date=9 May 2006}}</ref> where it would languish for seven years before a decision.

Despite that, Wal-Mart sued an online parodist for alleged "trademark infringement" after he used the symbol. The District Court found in favor of the parodist when in March 2008, the judge concluded that Wal-Mart's smiley face logo was not shown to be "inherently distinctive" and that it "has failed to establish that the smiley face has acquired secondary meaning or that it is otherwise a protectable trademark" under [[United States trademark law|U.S. law]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.citizen.org/litigation/forms/cases/getlinkforcase.cfm?cID=206| date=28 March 2008| title=Smith v.
