== Artistry ==
Lafuente has been cited as "an old soul based in the hills of Aragón with Andalusian air and with a Valencian heart; an old soul, that has no other explanation for a sensitivity typical of the greats of Spanish-Latin music".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poplacara.com/es/bandas/guitarricadelafuente|title=El alma vieja de Guitarricadelafuente {{!}} Revista independiente de música|website=www.poplacara.com|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> The singer describes his music as "real music, with truth and without any arrangement or production; with clear and concise messages that I didn't realise could touch the hearts of this many people" he states that "there is no songwriting process in my songs, they occur to me on the go".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://los40.com/los40/2019/07/29/musica/1564416683_104534.html|title=Guitarricadelafuente: "Me he llegado a inspirar en Nathy Peluso y Bad Gyal para mi última canción"|last=LOS40|date=2019-07-29|website=LOS40|language=es|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>

The singer has cited urban artists like [[Nathy Peluso]] or [[Bad Gyal]] as major influences for his songs. He gets inspired by their persona other than their musical genre. He has also stated that he has listened a lot to [[Loquillo (singer)|Loquillo]] and [[Extremoduro]] while growing up but doesn't think that it will influence his music. He has also cited South American culture as a major influence by saying "I like all the Southern American imaginary, it is a very rich and colorful culture. Very nice to tell. With many stories, it transmits a lot".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://los40.com/los40/2019/07/29/musica/1564416683_104534.html|title = Guitarricadelafuente: "Me he llegado a inspirar en Nathy Peluso y Bad Gyal para mi última canción"|date = 31 July 2019}}</ref>
