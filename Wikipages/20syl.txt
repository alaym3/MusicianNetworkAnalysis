== Biography ==
Richard, originally a [[graphic designer]], graduated from the Graduate School of Fine Arts in [[Nantes Metropolis|Nantes Métropole]]. He began his musical career in his bedroom at his parents' house in [[Rezé]].

In 1995, Richard and Cambia released their first [[mixtape]], ''Première Formule.'' Recorded in a makeshift studio, the first self-produced cassette was sold in the courtyard of their school. In 1997, they associated with DJ Greem, a high school friend of Richard's, to form the group [[Hocus Pocus (group)|Hocus Pocus]], and released their first album as a trio, ''Seconde Formule'', in 1998. Hocus Pocus mixes elements specific to [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] (scratches, samples, rap) to an instrumental sound influenced by [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. Alongside Hocus Pocus, they created in collaboration with DJ Atom and DJ Pfel, a group called [[C2C (group)|C2C]] (also known as "Coups2Cross"). C2C was the world champion [[Disco Mix Club|DMC]] team four years in a row from 2003 to 2006. They found the collaboration of two [[MC (hip hop)|MCs]] and a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] did not work on stage and went their separate ways; Richard continued his production as 20syl and DJ Greem invested specifically in C2C.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalmusic.fr/artiste/11135-hocus-pocus/bio|title=Biographie de Hocus Pocus - Universal Music France|website=Universal Music France|language=fr-FR|access-date=4 December 2016}}</ref>

In 2001, Richard worked again with DJ Greem and Cambia on stage as Hocus Pocus. The same year, they created the label ''On & On'' and released the maxi ''Sick'', which sold around 4000 copies. Three years later, they released the album ''73 Touches'' (in reference to the number of piano keys). Largely influenced by jazz, they refer to [[Miles Davis]] and [[Billie Holiday]]. Mathieu Lelièvre on keyboard, Hervé Godard on bass and David Le Deunff on guitar complement the trio. The same album was reissued in 2006 with a new version of ''Sick'' and six new titles.<ref name=":0" />

The album ''Place 54'', released in October 2007, increased their willingness to create acoustic hip-hop. For this album, they signed with the label Motown France to promote and distribute it. The album was well received and attracted interest from mainstream TV and radio. In 2008, Hocus Pocus was nominated for a [[Victoires de la Musique]] award in the category "Urban Music Album of the Year".<ref name=":0" />

Richard published his first solo [[Extended play|EP]], ''Motifs,'' on the 9 June 2014; the site [http://Sourdoreille.net sourdoreille.net] considers this EP as "a real gem"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sourdoreille.net/20syl-et-ibrahim-maalouf-duo-de-choc/ |title=Le premier EP de 20syl est une pépite {{!}} Sourdoreille |url-status=live |archive-date=14 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914053818/http://www.sourdoreille.net/20syl-et-ibrahim-maalouf-duo-de-choc |access-date=4 December 2016 }}</ref> whilst [http://wordplaymagazine.com/ wordplaymagazine.com] praises Richard's style as "frankly remarkable".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wordplaymagazine.com/2015/06/articles/reviews/20-syl-motifs-2/|title=20 Syl – Motifs 2|date=13 June 2015|newspaper=Wordplay Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=4 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220222425/http://wordplaymagazine.com/2015/06/articles/reviews/20-syl-motifs-2/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> His second EP, ''Motifs <abbr>II</abbr>'', was published on 11 May 2015. Regarding the cover of ''Motifs <abbr>II</abbr>'' <abbr>Richard</abbr> explains: "For the first volume, I played on the contrast between the zebra and the checkerboard. For this one, I wanted another animal. I like animals with a solemn air, which release an aesthetic force. When I came across this owl, I found him mysterious and chic. I also chose the motif of the opposition in the checkered plumage. It is a way to symbolize the two aspects of my music: electronic and organic. This refined and enigmatic image raises questions."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/20syl-j-ai-envie-de-tout-controler_1685660.html|title=20syl: "I want to control everything"|date=4 December 2016|newspaper=LExpress.fr|access-date=4 December 2016}}</ref>
