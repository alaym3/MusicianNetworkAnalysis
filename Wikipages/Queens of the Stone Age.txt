'''Queens of the Stone Age''' (commonly abbreviated '''QOTSA''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1996 in [[Palm Desert, California]]. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist [[Josh Homme]], who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line-up changes. The current line-up consists of Homme alongside [[Troy Van Leeuwen]] (guitar, [[Lap steel guitar|lap steel]], keyboard, percussion, backing vocals), [[Michael Shuman]] (bass guitar, keyboard, backing vocals), [[Dean Fertita]] (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and [[Jon Theodore]] (drums, percussion). The band also have a large pool of [[List of Queens of the Stone Age contributors|contributors and collaborators]].<ref name="allmusic" /> Queens of the Stone Age are known for their [[blues]], [[Krautrock]] and [[electronica]]-influenced style of [[riff]]-oriented and rhythmic [[hard rock]] music, coupled with Homme's distinct falsetto vocals and unorthodox guitar scales. 

Formed after the dissolution of Homme's previous band [[Kyuss]],<ref name="thefade old">{{cite web| url = http://thefade.net/oldsite/transcripts/00xxxxguitardotcom.html |title = Old QOTSA Archived Interview on thefade.net |access-date = August 25, 2010}}</ref> the band originated from the [[Palm Desert Scene|Palm Desert music scene]], known for its distinct "[[Palm_Desert_Scene|desert rock]]" sound and highly collaborative nature. Their [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self-titled debut album]] was recorded by former Kyuss bandmates [[Alfredo Hernández]] on drums and Homme on all other instruments. It was well received by critics for its [[stoner rock]] sound which Homme has described as "robot rock". [[Nick Oliveri]] joined the band as bassist and vocalist along with additional vocalist [[Mark Lanegan]] for the recording of [[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|''Rated R'']], which was commercially and critically successful. Now with three singers and a myriad of other collaborators, ''Rated R'' diversified their musical palette with forays into [[psychedelic rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and featured their breakout single "[[Feel Good Hit of the Summer]]", which lists six recreational drugs. Featuring former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer and [[Foo Fighters]] singer [[Dave Grohl]] on drums and contributions from [[Alain Johannes]] and [[Natasha Shneider]], ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]'' was released in 2002, to universal acclaim and commercial success. The album saw the band further experiment with instrumentation, such as string and horn arrangements, and featured some of the band's most enduring singles "[[No One Knows]]" and "[[Go with the Flow]]". By this time the band had achieved considerable international recognition, and have since embarked on successive world tours. Homme fired Oliveri and Lanegan left as a core member but continued to occasionally contribute vocals, making Homme the primary singer for 2005's ''[[Lullabies to Paralyze]]'' and 2007's electronic-influenced [[Era Vulgaris (album)|''Era Vulgaris'']]. 

After a few years of inactivity while the band members worked on other projects, the more somber and introspective ''[[...Like Clockwork]]'' was released in 2013, receiving critical acclaim. The band released [[Villains (Queens of the Stone Age album)|''Villains'']] in 2017 with [[Mark Ronson]] as producer.<ref name="allmusic" />

The band have been nominated for [[Grammy Award|Grammy Awards]] seven times; four times for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]], twice for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]], and once for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 23, 2020|title=Queens Of The Stone Age|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/queens-stone-age/8455|access-date=February 3, 2021|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and debut album (1996–1999)===
After the breakup of his previous band, [[Kyuss]], in 1995, [[Josh Homme]] briefly joined [[Screaming Trees]] as a touring guitarist,<ref>{{cite web

In 1996 they released the eponymous ''[[Gamma Ray (EP)|Gamma Ray]]'' EP, featuring "Born to Hula" and "If Only Everything" (which would later appear on their self-titled debut as "If Only"). The EP featured [[Matt Cameron]] of [[Soundgarden]] and [[Pearl Jam]], Van Conner from Screaming Trees, and percussionist [[Victor Indrizzo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefade.net/oldsite/discography/gammaray.html|title=Discography entry for ''Gamma Ray''|website=thefade.net|access-date=May 9, 2007}}</ref>

Gamma Ray changed their name in 1997 after the German [[power metal]] band [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] threatened to sue. The name "Queens of the Stone Age" came from a nickname given to Kyuss by their producer [[Chris Goss]]. Homme said of the name: "Kings would be too macho. The Kings of the Stone Age wear armor and have axes and wrestle. The Queens of the Stone Age hang out with the Kings of the Stone Age's girlfriends when they wrestle ... Rock should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls. That way everyone's happy and it's more of a party. Kings of the Stone Age is too lopsided."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/08/queens-of-the-stone-age-sexy-rock|title=Music To Strip To: Queens of the Stone Age Are the Only Rock Band That Understands Sex|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=July 22, 2017}}</ref>

The first release under the Queens of the Stone Age name was the song "18 A.D.," released on the compilation album ''Burn One Up! Music for Stoners'' which featured members of the Dutch [[stoner rock]] band [[Beaver (band)|Beaver]]. The band's first live appearance was on November 20, 1997, at [[OK Hotel]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], with Cameron on drums, [[Mike Johnson (bassist)|Mike Johnson]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]] on bass and John McBain of [[Monster Magnet]] on guitar. In December that year, the band released a split EP, ''[[Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age]]'', which featured three tracks from the Gamma Ray sessions as well as three Kyuss tracks recorded in 1995 prior to their breakup.<ref>{{cite web

Queens of the Stone Age released their [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self-titled debut]] in 1998 on [[Stone Gossard]]'s and [[Regan Hagar]]'s label [[Loosegroove Records]], and on vinyl by [[Man's Ruin Records]]. Homme played guitar and bass on the album (the latter credited to Homme's alter-ego Carlo Von Sexron), [[Alfredo Hernández]] on the drums, and several other contributions by Chris Goss and Hutch. Homme reportedly asked Screaming Trees vocalist [[Mark Lanegan]] to appear on the record, but he was unable due to other commitments.<ref>[http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2008/01/03/mark-lanegan-the-man-comes-around/ Mark Lanegan: The Man Comes Around] – MAGNET Magazine Inc. 2011</ref>

Soon after the recording sessions were finished for the album, former Kyuss bassist [[Nick Oliveri]] joined the group, and touring commenced with a band consisting entirely of ex-Kyuss members. Guitarist [[Dave Catching]] joined shortly after. From this point forward, the band's line-up would change frequently; by the time their second album was being recorded, Hernández had left the group to play in other bands.<ref>{{cite web

2000's ''[[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|Rated R]]'' featured myriad musicians familiar with Homme and Oliveri's work and "crew" of sorts: among others, drummers Nick Lucero and [[Gene Trautmann]], guitarists [[David Catching|Dave Catching]], [[Brendon McNichol]], and Chris Goss contributed, and even [[Judas Priest]] frontman [[Rob Halford]], recording next door, stepped in for a guest spot on "[[Feel Good Hit of the Summer]]."<ref name="WEIRD">

{{quote|There's a robotic element to our albums, like the repetition of riffs. We also wanted to do a record that had a lot of dynamic range.

During the 2001 [[Rock in Rio]] show, bassist Nick Oliveri was arrested after performing on stage naked, with only his bass guitar covering his genitals. Oliveri apologized to officials, saying that he did not know it was a crime in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1438389/nude-queens-stone-age-bassist-arrested-rio.jhtml|title=Nude Queens Of The Stone Age Bassist Arrested In Rio|date=June 22, 2001|publisher=MTV.com|author=Moss, Corey}}</ref>

Towards the end of the ''Rated R'' tour, the band's performance at the 2001 [[Rock am Ring]] festival in Germany was, according to Homme, "the worst show we've ever played and it was in front of 40,000 people."<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://www.fhmonline.com/site/content/article.aspx?ID=34373 | title = Album Reviews: Era Vulgaris | magazine = FHM | access-date = December 7, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100107182742/http://fhmonline.com/site/content/article.aspx?ID=34373 | archive-date = January 7, 2010 }}</ref> The band decided to [[tattoo]] themselves with the starting time of the performance, "Freitag 4:15." As Oliveri explained:

{{quote|Me, Mark [Lanegan], Josh [Homme] and Hutch, our soundman, have the same tattoo, it's from Rock am Ring festival. The time we had to play was 4:15 in the afternoon and it was just a terrible show. It sucked, it was horrible. That's why I tattooed it on my ribs, where it would hurt, so I'd never forget.|Oliveri, interview with ''Daredevil Magazine'' (2005)}}

===''Songs for the Deaf'', mainstream exposure and Oliveri's departure (2001–2004)===
[[File:Nick Oliveri V Festival 2003.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Nick Oliveri]], bassist 1998–2004, performing with the band at the [[V festival#V2003|2003 V Festival]]]]

[[Foo Fighters]] frontman and former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer, [[Dave Grohl]], joined in late 2001 to record drums for their third album. ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]'' was released in August 2002, again featuring Lanegan, along with former [[A Perfect Circle]] guitarist [[Troy Van Leeuwen]] to the touring line-up following the album's release. Also featured on ''Songs for the Deaf'' for the final track "Mosquito Song" were former A Perfect Circle bassist [[Paz Lenchantin]] on viola and piano, and [[Dean Ween]] on guitar.

{{quote|This record was supposed to sound bizarre—like lightning in a bottle. We also were extremely fucked up. It even sounds that way to me, like a crazy person.

''Songs for the Deaf'' was a critical hit and was [[Music recording sales certification|certified gold]] in 2003, with sales of over 900,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/q/queens_of_the_stoneage/news_feature_032805|title=Queens of the Stone Age: A Stone Unturned|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref> The singles "[[No One Knows]]" and "[[Go with the Flow]]" became hits on radio and [[MTV]], with the former just outside the [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Top 40]]. "No One Knows" and "Go with the Flow" were also featured on the first iterations of the popular video games ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and ''Rock Band'' (respectively). The song "You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire" was featured as the theme song in Naughty Dog's "[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]" in 2005 along with "A Song For The Dead".

<!-- This is not clear, Did Dave Grohl leave in 2004 ? I don't think so -->
The ''Songs for the Deaf'' tour culminated in a string of headline dates in Australia in January 2004. Grohl returned to his other projects and was replaced on the European leg of the tour by former [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] drummer [[Joey Castillo]], who joined the band full-time. After the tour, Homme fired Oliveri, as he was convinced that Oliveri had been physically abusive to his girlfriend: "A couple years ago, I spoke to Nick about a rumor I heard. I said, 'If I ever find out that this is true, I can't know you, man.'"<ref>{{cite magazine| last=Cohen | first=Jonathan | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62176/homme-comes-clean-on-oliveri-firing | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]] | title=Homme Comes Clean On Oliveri Firing | date=July 6, 2005 | access-date=May 9, 2007}}</ref> Homme considered breaking up the band after firing Oliveri, but found a new determination to continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/queens-of-the-stone-age/52832|title=Josh Homme: 'I considered breaking up Queens after Nick Oliveri left' &#124; News|date=September 2, 2010|publisher=Nme.Com|access-date=May 28, 2014}}</ref> Oliveri countered in the press that the band had been "poisoned by hunger for power" and that without him, they were "Queens Lite."

In late 2004, Homme, along with [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]] multi-instrumentalist [[Alain Johannes]] and remaining band members Van Leeuwen and Castillo recorded the Queens' fourth studio album, ''[[Lullabies to Paralyze]]'', a title taken from a lyric in "Mosquito Song" from their previous album.<ref name="Vertigo">{{cite news| url=http://www.vertigo.fm/main.php?site=artist_texte&artist_id=1639 | publisher=Vertigo | title=Queens of the Stone Age Interview | access-date=May 9, 2007}}</ref> The album featured guests including [[ZZ Top]]'s [[Billy Gibbons]]. Despite Lanegan reportedly turning down an invitation to remain with the band, he recorded vocals on new tracks (notably the solo vocalist on the opening track "This Lullaby") and appeared on the supporting tour as scheduling and his health permitted.

''Lullabies to Paralyze'' was leaked onto the internet in February 2005 and was aired by Triple J radio in Australia on March 3, 2005 as an unsubstantiated 'World Premiere'. It was then officially released on Tuesday, March 22, 2005 in the US, debuting in the number 5 slot on the [[Billboard Music Chart]], the greatest debut of any Queens record until ''...Like Clockwork'' debuted at number 1 in June 2013.

On May 14, 2005, the group was the [[List of Saturday Night Live hosts and musical guests|musical guest on Saturday Night Live]], hosted by Will Ferrell. One of Ferrell's popular Saturday Night Live characters, fictional [[Blue Öyster Cult]] cowbellist [[More cowbell|Gene Frenkle]], made a re-appearance on the show, playing with the Queens on their first song of the night, "[[Little Sister (Queens of the Stone Age song)|Little Sister]]." Frenkle played the song's wood block part using a cowbell along with the band.

On November 22, 2005, Queens of the Stone Age released a live album/DVD set, ''[[Over the Years and Through the Woods]]'', featuring a live concert filmed in London, England, and bonus features which included rare videos of songs from 1998 to 2005. In 2005, the group supported [[Nine Inch Nails]] on their North American tour of ''[[With Teeth]]'' along with [[Autolux]] (for the first half of the tour) and [[Death from Above 1979]] (for the second). NIN's guitarist [[Aaron North]] appeared as an onstage guest with the Queens for the songs "Born to Hula," "Regular John," "[[Avon (song)|Avon]]," "[[Monsters in the Parasol]]" and "Long, Slow Goodbye" at the [[Wiltern Theatre|Wiltern LG]] in Los Angeles on December 19 and 20, 2005.

Another onstage guest for the December 20 performance was Homme's former Kyuss bandmate [[John Garcia (singer)|John Garcia]], the first time that Homme and Garcia had played together since 1997. As a special encore they performed three Kyuss songs: "Thumb," "Hurricane" and "Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop."<ref name="NME">{{cite web | title = Queens Of The Stone age joined by unexpected guest | publisher = [[NME]]| date= December 21, 2005 | url =https://www.nme.com/news/queens-of-the-stone-age/21827| access-date = July 3, 2007}}</ref> Homme stated that the band's lowest point was during the ''Lullabies'' era,<ref>{{cite video

The band began a North American Tour in 2007, which they named the "Duluth Tour" because they were going to many small towns and cities they had never played before, such as [[Duluth, Minnesota]].<ref name="Duluth">{{cite web| url =http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_tours/queens_of_the_stone_age_the_duluth_tour_details.html| title =Queens of the Stone Age: The "Duluth Tour" Details| access-date =October 3, 2007| date= June 3, 2007| publisher =[[Ultimate Guitar]]}}</ref> The tour was extended to other areas, such as the United Kingdom, where the band played more shows than on any of their previous UK tours. The band toured in Australia in late March to early April 2008, on the V festival tour, including a string of side shows. Throughout the beginning of May 2008, the band completed the Canadian leg of its touring.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/47386-pumpkins-jamc-qotsa-air-css-rock-aussie-v-fest| title =Pumpkins, JAMC, QOTSA, Air, CSS Rock Aussie V Fest| access-date =June 4, 2008| publisher =[[Pitchfork Media]]| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070724132847/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/47386-pumpkins-jamc-qotsa-air-css-rock-aussie-v-fest| archive-date =July 24, 2007}}</ref>

In November 2007, Queens of the Stone Age performed a semi-acoustic set in an underground salt mine in Germany, performing a selection of hits, rarities, covers and an unreleased song named "Cathedral City."<ref>{{cite news|title=QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE Performs At Former Salt Mine; Teaser Clip Available |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/queens-of-the-stone-age-performs-at-former-salt-mine-teaser-clip-available/|work=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=July 12, 2016}}</ref> A DVD of the concert was planned but aside from a trailer promoting the DVD and a number of photographs, no footage of the concert has been released.

On July 2, 2008, Queens of the Stone Age's former keyboardist Natasha Shneider died of lung cancer at the age of 52. The news broke with a message posted on the MySpace page of the band Sweethead, of which Natasha's close friend and former bandmate Troy Van Leeuwen is a member. The band's homepage was updated with a memorial message by Homme replacing the normal front page. The band performed a concert in celebration of Natasha Shneider's life at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on August 16, 2008. They were joined on stage by Shneider's husband Alain Johannes, [[Jack Black]] and [[Kyle Gass]], [[Matt Cameron]], [[Brody Dalle]], [[Jesse Hughes (musician)|Jesse Hughes]], Chris Goss and [[PJ Harvey]], playing a variety of QOTSA and non-QOTSA songs, including covers of songs from bands such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[The Doors]]. [[Tenacious D]] and PJ Harvey also performed acoustic sets at the show. Proceeds from the concert went to defray the costs associated with Natasha's illness.

On August 22 and 23, 2008, Queens of the Stone Age performed the last shows of their ''Era Vulgaris'' tour at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in the UK, and Josh Homme announced in an interview with the BBC and during the show that he would be returning to the studio to work on the next album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading and Leeds Festivals 2008 - Queens of the Stone Age|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/readingandleeds/2008/artists/queensofthestoneage/video2.shtml#emp|publisher=BBC|access-date=December 5, 2015}}</ref>

=== Homme's health issues, debut re-release and promotional tour (2009–2011) ===
During 2009 and 2010, band members worked on side projects during the down time. Troy Van Leeuwen started up a new band, [[Sweethead]]. Joey Castillo played for [[Eagles of Death Metal]] on their ''[[Heart On]]'' tour. Bassist Michael Shuman continued his work as drummer and vocalist with [[Mini Mansions]], while Dean Fertita became the guitarist/keyboardist for [[Jack White]]'s newest group, The Dead Weather. Josh Homme formed [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Them Crooked Vultures]] with [[Dave Grohl]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122919|title=JOSH HOMME, JOHN PAUL JONES, DAVE GROHL Collaborate On New Project|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704214952/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122919|archive-date=July 4, 2009}}</ref> After Them Crooked Vultures finished touring in June, the band toured and released a two-CD deluxe edition of ''Rated R'' on August 3, 2010. This edition featured the original CD along with six B-sides and live recordings from the band's Reading performance in 2000.

In 2010, Homme suffered from complications during a botched knee surgery, during which his heart stopped for a short time due to [[asphyxia]]tion; doctors had to use a [[defibrillator]] to revive him. Following this, he was bedridden for four months and plunged into a deep depression, during which he considered giving up his music career altogether.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/home-sweet-homme-29293913.html|title=Home, sweet Homme - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=July 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref> He elaborated on this experience further in an interview on [[Marc Maron]]'s [[WTF with Marc Maron|WTF podcast]], explaining that he had contracted a [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection which his immune system could not fight due to stress.

After Homme recovered, Queens of the Stone Age released a remastered version of their self-titled debut album in early 2011, and performed the album in its entirety in a promotional tour.<ref name="roadrunnerrecords" /> The band performed on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on April 14,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=156919|title=Queens of the Stone Age performs on ''Conan''|publisher=Roadrunner Records/Blabbermouth|access-date=April 18, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421072513/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=156919|archive-date=April 21, 2011}}</ref> and later played at the Australian music festival [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]].<ref name="official"/> Throughout the summer of 2011, the band appeared at various European festivals, including the [[Glastonbury Festival]], in [[Somerset]], UK. They also played at Pearl Jam's 20th Anniversary Festival at Alpine Valley in East Troy, WI on September 3 and 4, 2011, which would be their last with drummer Joey Castillo.

The album debuted in the number one position in the US and is the first QOTSA album to achieve this ranking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Queens of the Stone Age's 'Like Clockwork' Debuts At No. 1|url=https://variety.com/2013/music/news/queens-of-the-stone-at-no-1-1200495889/|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC|access-date=September 20, 2013|author=Christopher Morris|date=June 12, 2013}}</ref>

Following a performance by QOTSA at the [[Jay Z]]-owned [[Made In America Festival]] in the summer of 2013, Homme made comments about the rap star during a radio interview with CBC Radio 2's ''Strombo Show''. Homme explained that his band was frisked by the event's security team prior to the performance and referred to Jay Z's personal interaction with the band as a marketing stunt. Homme stated:

{{cquote|He has his security frisking the bands on the way in. I just told them if you open up my bag I'm not playing so I guess it's up to you whether we are playing or not ... The idea they frisked all my guys, means you're in some different place, no-one has ever done that [to me] ... He also gave us some champagne and wanted us to take a photo with it. And I thought, "That's not a gift, that is a marketing tool." So I destroyed it. Because I thought it was rude overall. And you shouldn't frisk my guys, you should fuck off.<ref>{{cite web|title=Josh Homme has 99 problems and Jay Z is one|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/36955/Josh-Homme-has-99-problems-and-Jay-Z-is-one|work=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|access-date=20 September 2013|author=Sarah Smith|date=17 September 2013}}</ref>}}
