'''Deerhoof''' are an American [[independent music]] group formed in San Francisco in 1994. They currently consist of founding drummer [[Greg Saunier]], bassist and singer Satomi Matsuzaki, and guitarists John Dieterich and Ed Rodriguez. Beginning as an improvised [[noise punk]] band, Deerhoof became widely renowned and influential in the 2000s through self-produced albums that combine "[[noise music|noise]], sugary <nowiki>[</nowiki>pop<nowiki>]</nowiki> melodies, and an [[experimental music|experimental]] spirit into utterly distinctive music" (AllMusic).<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web|author=Heather Phares |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/deerhoof-mn0000190210/biography |title=Deerhoof &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=August 14, 2014}}</ref>

===Breakthrough===

[[Chris Cohen (musician)|Chris Cohen]] joined Deerhoof on guitar in 2002, between ''Reveille''{{'s}} completion and release.<ref name="huliq"/>

In contrast to ''Reveille''{{'s}} protracted, painstaking, and digital production process, 2003's ''[[Apple O']]'' was played almost entirely live to tape in one nine-hour session with [[Jay Pellicci]] engineering.<ref name="huliq"/> Extinction, [[nuclear holocaust]], [[invasive species]], and the Greek god of music all figure prominently in the album's themes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Karen O]] chose ''Apple O{{'}}'' in the Rolling Stone 2003 Music Awards, Artists' Top Albums,<ref name="killrockstars.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.killrockstars.com/press/429/|title=Press I Deerhoof I The Runners Four|website=Killrockstars.com|access-date=January 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109033544/http://www.killrockstars.com/press/429/|archive-date=January 9, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the album received some critical praise, notably in the ''New York Times''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} But in what was to become a pattern for Deerhoof, the album's critical appraisal improved with time, and ''[[Apple O']]'' was later listed by Pitchfork as one of the top albums of the 2000s.<ref>[https://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7706-the-top-200-albums-of-the-2000s-200-151/ Staff Lists: The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s: 200–151].

By 2003 Deerhoof had become the longest-running band on [[Kill Rock Stars]].<ref name="killrockstars.com"/> Matsuzaki was editing a Bay Area Japanese magazine, Cohen was waiting tables at a Thai restaurant, and Dieterich and Saunier were doing data entry for legal and consulting firms,<ref name="huliq" /> but that year they all decided to quit their jobs simultaneously and focus on touring.<ref name="huliq" /> That year they contributed to ''Azadi!

Deerhoof's next record took its inspiration from a crudely drawn character created by Japanese artist [[Ken Kagami]].<ref name="huliq" /> 2004's [[Milk Man (Deerhoof album)|''Milk Man'']] the album featured an opulent, campy sound inspired by [[Musical Theatre|Broadway]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref name="huliq" />{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}} It was nominated for "Outstanding Alternative Album" in the California Music Awards,<ref name="killrockstars.com"/> and stayed at #1 on the Dusted Radio Chart for six straight weeks, and reached #1 on the [[CMJ]] Core Chart.<ref name="killrockstars.com" /> Also in 2004 Deerhoof received the Editor's Choice Award from ''[[7x7 (magazine)|7x7]]'' magazine, and was voted "Best Local Rock Band" by readers of SF Weekly.<ref name="killrockstars.com"/> In 2006 ''Milk Man'' was adapted to a children's ballet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://milkmanballet.com/|title=Deerhoof's Milk Man Ballet|website=Milkmanballet.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324005638/http://milkmanballet.com/|archive-date=March 24, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=November 26, 2010}}</ref>

Deerhoof's next release was their first to be sung in Matsuzaki's native language of Japanese.<ref name="huliq" /> 2005's mini-album ''[[Green Cosmos]]'' combined an orchestral sound with dance music styles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} 

Deerhoof spent several months in 2005 in a rented rehearsal space in Oakland, writing and recording daily as a full band.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} When the result was released that fall, the double album ''[[The Runners Four]]'' featured each band member taking turns as vocalist, singing unusually wordy lyrics in which Arks and time capsules recur, as though foretelling that this would be the final recording of this lineup.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Instrumental roles were reversed for Matsuzaki (now on guitar) and Cohen (now on bass).{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} 

In 2006, [[Danielson]] released the critically acclaimed ''[[Ships (album)|Ships]]'', which featured Deerhoof as the backing band for many of the tracks.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://stereogum.com/archives/deerhoof_sufjan_to_appear_on_new_danielson_record_002060.html |title = Deerhoof, Sufjan to Appear On New Danielson Record|publisher = [[Stereogum]] |date=March 1, 2006|access-date= November 26, 2010}}</ref> Later that year, after an extensive world tour that ended at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], Deerhoof composed and performed a live soundtrack to [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]]'s hour-long animation masterpiece ''[[Heaven and Earth Magic]]'' at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sffs.org/content.aspx?catid=22%2C37&pageid=624|title=49th San Francisco International Film Festival Music/Film Programming Spans Diverse Genres|date=March 2, 2006|website=San Francisco Film Society|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025059/http://www.sffs.org/content.aspx?catid=22%2C37&pageid=624|archive-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=November 26, 2011}}</ref> This was to be Cohen's last activity with Deerhoof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/atp-recordings/deerhoof/ |publisher=ATP Recordings |title=Deerhoof |first=Michael |last=Azerrad |access-date=January 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011112857/http://atpfestival.com/atp-recordings/deerhoof/ |archive-date=October 11, 2007 }}</ref> The split was amicable and, to commemorate Cohen, Deerhoof posted [[Untitled Deerhoof EP|a free EP]] on their website, one of several they have posted over the years.<ref name="huliq"/> [[Chris Cohen (musician)|Chris Cohen]] now records and tours as a solo act.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://capturedtracks.com/artist/chris-cohen |title=Chris Cohen Captured Tracks page|publisher=Captured Tracks|access-date=February 23, 2019}}</ref>

===Reconfiguration===
Matsuzaki, Saunier, and Dieterich began a new recording as a trio.

By January 2008 Deerhoof became a quartet again with the addition of [[The Flying Luttenbachers]]/[[Gorge Trio]]/[[XBXRX]] guitarist and longtime friend Ed Rodriguez. That summer Deerhoof released the song "Fresh Born" online as sheet music only, anticipating similar experiments by [[Beck]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] by several years. Fans recorded and uploaded their own versions of the song to a special site, before anyone outside the band had heard Deerhoof's own version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://deerhoof.cashmusic.org/|title=Fresh Born|website=Deerhoof.cashmusic.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725142006/http://deerhoof.cashmusic.org/|archive-date=July 25, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=November 26, 2011}}</ref> The October 2008s album ''[[Offend Maggie]]'' received critical praise from VH1, NPR, Entertainment Weekly, Alternative Press, The Guardian, and Mojo.<ref>[https://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/deerhoof/offendmaggie Offend Maggie Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic].

In April 2010 Deerhoof curated the Belgian music festival Sonic City, inviting an eclectic array of European acts including [[The Go! Team]], [[Paolo Pandolfo]], and sitting in with the Belgian punk band [[The Kids (Belgian band)|The Kids]]. Then in April and July 2010, Deerhoof and [[Xiu Xiu]] joined to perform [[Joy Division]]'s album ''Unknown Pleasures'' live at the Donaufestival in Austria, and at Brooklyn's Williamsburg Waterfront.

===Format experimentation===
Building on "I Did Crimes For You", they continued during this time to record themselves in a rented rehearsal space in Oakland. Musical influences from [[the Beach Boys]], [[new romanticism]], [[tropicalia]], and the [[Congotronics series]] all found their way onto 2011's ''[[Deerhoof vs. Evil]]''. The band released the album one track at a time via different media outlets online, with a full map and schedule available on their own website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deerhoofvsevil.com|title=Global Album Leak|website=Deerhoof vs. Evil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128065607/http://deerhoofvsevil.com/|archive-date=January 28, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> The album received critical acclaim notably from Entertainment Weekly, MOJO, and Paste.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve LaBate |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/01/deerhoof-deerhoof-vs-evil.html |title=Deerhoof: Deerhoof vs. Evil |website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=January 25, 2011 |access-date=August 14, 2014}}</ref> Matt Goldman's design was the second Deerhoof album cover to feature a mushroom cloud.

In 2012 Deerhoof also began home-recording their next record ''[[Breakup Song]]''. The band said that the album was a response to the tradition of breakup songs, which they felt included too many sad songs and too few empowering ones. After a long final mixing session at Saunier's apartment, Matsuzaki took the front cover photo of a garbage truck in the early morning hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1120341/progress-report-deerhoof/franchises/progress-report/ |title=Progress Report: Deerhoof |publisher=Stereogum |date=August 9, 2012 |access-date=August 14, 2014}}</ref> The Polyvinyl Records release was also released on [[Joyful Noise Recordings]] in "flexi-book" format, allowing the listener to flip from song to song as if each track were a page in a storybook.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deerhoof Release 'Break-Up Song' as Flexi-Book via Joyful Noise! |url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/deerhoof-release-flexi-book-via-joyful-noise.html |publisher=Joyful Noise Recordings |access-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003134312/http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/deerhoof-release-flexi-book-via-joyful-noise.html |archive-date=October 3, 2013 }}</ref> Deerhoof hero Simeon of [[Silver Apples]] made a remix of "Mario's Flaming Whiskers III".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/deerhoof-music/marios-flaming-dessert-remix|title=Mario's Flaming Dessert (Remix by Simeon Silver Apples)|website=soundcloud.com|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref> Revealing some of Deerhoof's working methods and group chemistry, a rare full-band interview, with former MTV VJ [[John Norris (reporter)|John Norris]], appeared in the fall 2012 ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/deerhoof-breakup-song/#_ |title=Deerhoof Does Parties - Page |magazine=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |access-date=August 14, 2014}}</ref>

Deerhoof's twelfth album, 2014's [[La Isla Bonita (Deerhoof album)|''La Isla Bonita'']] was self-recorded live in guitarist Ed Rodriguez's basement during a "weeklong sleepover arguing over whether to try and sound like [[Joan Jett]] or [[Janet Jackson]]". The recordings were meant as demos to be rerecorded with former music journalist and Mr. Dream drummer Nick Sylvester, but the band liked the raw DIY versions so much, they just kept them and recorded the vocals with Sylvester. The lyrics were heavily influenced by ''24/7'', a book by Columbia professor [[Jonathan Crary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/03/12/deerhoof-new-video/|title=Deerhoof on two decades of weirdness and a brand new video|first=Corinne|last=Bagish|website=mashable.com|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref> The album art was by [[Sara Cwynar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polyvinylrecords.com/#news/1510 |title=Deerhoof Announce New Album - La Isla Bonita |publisher=Polyvinyl Records |date=August 20, 2014}}</ref> Their music video for "Exit Only" featured [[Michael Shannon]] playing two roles, with a cameo by Rodriguez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRGEHF_vLHw|title=Deerhoof - Exit Only [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO]|date=November 11, 2014|access-date=April 10, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> The Guardian, on their exclusive preview stream of ''La Isla Bonita'', collected testimonials about Deerhoof from a variety of notable musicians and artists, including [[Radiohead]]'s [[Jonny Greenwood]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s [[Graham Coxon]], [[Adam Green (musician)|Adam Green]], the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]]'s [[Brian Chase]], and [[David Shrigley]].<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/oct/27/deerhoof-la-isla-bonita-exclusive-album-stream|title=Deerhoof – La Isla Bonita: Exclusive album stream|date=October 27, 2014|website=The Guardian|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref> The album received high praise from NPR, A.V.
