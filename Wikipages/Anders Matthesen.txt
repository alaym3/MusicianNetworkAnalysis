'''Anders "Anden"''' (''"The Duck"'') '''Matthesen''' (born 6 July 1975) is a Danish stand-up comedian, actor, and rapper. He is known for creating a wide array of memorable characters and stereotypes, which he uses as alter egos in performances.

After failing as a [[rapping|rapper]], Matthesen started his stand-up career at the Danish Stand-Up Championship in 1993, where he finished in second place. After making a name on this scene, as well as through his comedy radio stories, he also contributed to several other projects. For example, a television [[Advent Calendar#The Scandinavian Julekalender/Julkalender|"Julekalender"]], ''Jul på Vesterbro'', featured fourteen characters of his invention, all of them played by himself. These included the drunken, prostitute-addicted sailor Stewart Stardust and his junkie son, Danny. The story revolves around Stewart's [[hot dog stand]], which a band of terrorists attempts to use to detonate a nuclear device during a UN meeting in [[Copenhagen]].

Anders Matthesen has also released several CDs with his radio material, in addition to the animated movie ''[[Terkel in Trouble]]'', based on one of these. He has also acted in a few plays, including one about the life of Danish travel [[tycoon]] [[Simon Spies]]. In 2006, he revisited rapping on his album ''Soevnloes'', to great success, earning a Gold record.

Recently, Anders Matthesen has gone back to his stand-up roots, touring Denmark with shows like ''Bytte, bytte købmand'' (in collaboration with stand-up comedian Thomas Hartmann) from 2009 and the one-man show ''ANDERS'', which was released on DVD on 11 November 2013.
