'''Chesney Henry''' "'''Chet'''" '''Baker Jr.''' (December 23, 1929 – May 13, 1988) was an American [[jazz]] trumpeter and vocalist. He is known for major innovations within the [[cool jazz]] subgenre leading him to be nicknamed the "prince of cool".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/centuryofjazz0000carr|title=A century of jazz|first=Roy|last=Carr|date=December 2, 2004|publisher=London : Hamlyn|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Baker earned much attention and critical praise through the 1950s, particularly for albums featuring his vocals (''[[Chet Baker Sings]]'' (1954), ''[[(Chet Baker Sings) It Could Happen to You|It Could Happen to You]]'' (1958)). Jazz historian [[Dave Gelly]] described the promise of Baker's early career as "[[James Dean]], [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]], and [[Bix Beiderbecke|Bix]], rolled into one".<ref name="Gelly">{{cite book|last1=Gelly|first1=Dave|title=Icons of Jazz: A History in Photographs, 1900–2000|date=2000|publisher=Thunder Bay Press|location=San Diego, California|isbn=1-57145-268-0|edition=North American|url=https://archive.org/details/iconsofjazz00gell}}</ref> His well-publicized [[Substance dependence|drug habit]] also drove his notoriety and fame.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Baker was born and raised in a musical household in [[Yale, Oklahoma|Yale]], Oklahoma. His father, Chesney Baker Sr., was a professional guitarist, and his mother, Vera Moser, was a pianist who worked in a perfume factory. His maternal grandmother was Norwegian.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gavin |first=James |title=Deep In A Dream: The Long Night Of Chet Baker |page=10 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2011 |isbn=9781569767573}}</ref> Baker said that owing to the [[Great Depression]], his father, though talented, had to quit as a musician and take a regular job. At age 10 in 1940, his family relocated to [[Glendale, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chet Baker {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chet-baker-mn0000094210/biography|access-date=2021-03-15|website=AllMusic|language=en}}</ref>

Baker began his musical career singing in a church choir. His father gave him a trombone, which was replaced with a trumpet when the trombone proved too large. His mother said that he had begun to memorize tunes on the radio before he was given an instrument. After "falling in love" with the trumpet, he improved noticeably in two weeks. Peers called Baker a natural musician to whom playing came effortlessly.<ref name="documentary">''[[Let's Get Lost (1988 film)|Let's Get Lost]]'' (1988) documentary by [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]]</ref>

Baker received some musical education at Glendale High School, but he left school at the age of 16 in 1946 to join the [[United States Army]]. He was assigned to Berlin, Germany, where he joined the 298th Army Band. After leaving the Army in 1948, he studied music theory and harmony at [[El Camino College]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chet-baker-mn0000094210/biography|title=Chet Baker|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref> He dropped out during his second year to re-enlist. He became a member of the Sixth Army Band at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]] in San Francisco,<ref name=":0" /> spending time in clubs such as [[Bop City]] and the [[Black Hawk (nightclub)|Black Hawk]].<ref name="McKeever2014">{{cite book|last=McKeever|first=Stuart A. |title=Becoming Joey Fizz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rin2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17|access-date=25 April 2018|date=19 June 2014|publisher=Author House|isbn=978-1-4969-1521-4|pages=17–}}</ref> He was discharged from the Army in 1951 and proceeded to pursue a career in music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohemian.com/northbay/chet-baker/Content?oid=2180067|title=Chet Baker|last=Cahill|first=Greg|website=North Bay Bohemian|access-date=2017-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016125846/https://www.bohemian.com/northbay/chet-baker/Content?oid=2180067|archive-date=October 16, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Career===
[[File:Chet Baker (1955 portrait).jpg|thumb|Baker in 1955]]
Baker performed with [[Vido Musso]] and [[Stan Getz]] before being chosen by [[Charlie Parker]] for a series of West Coast engagements.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Gordon |title=Jazz West Coast : the Los Angeles jazz scene of the 1950s |page=[https://archive.org/details/jazzwestcoastlos00gord/page/72 72] |publisher=Quartet Books |year=1986 |isbn=9780704326033 |url=https://archive.org/details/jazzwestcoastlos00gord/page/72 }}</ref>

In 1952, Baker joined the [[Gerry Mulligan]] Quartet. Rather than playing identical melody lines in unison like Parker and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], Baker and Mulligan complemented each other with counterpoint and anticipating what the other would play next. "[[My Funny Valentine]]", with a solo by Baker, became a hit, and was associated with Baker for the rest of his career.<ref>{{cite web|author=Davis Inman|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2012/01/chet-baker-my-funny-valentine/|title=Chet Baker, 'My Funny Valentine' |work=American Songwriter |date=January 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427215330/https://americansongwriter.com/2012/01/chet-baker-my-funny-valentine/|access-date=January 21, 2015|archive-date=April 27, 2015}}</ref> With the quartet, Baker was a regular performer at Los Angeles jazz clubs such as [[The Haig]] and the [[Tiffany Club]].<ref name="documentary"/>

Within a year, Mulligan was arrested and imprisoned on drug charges. Baker formed a quartet with a rotation that included pianist [[Russ Freeman (pianist)|Russ Freeman]], bassists [[Bob Whitlock (musician)|Bob Whitlock]], [[Carson Smith (musician)|Carson Smith]], [[Joe Mondragon]], and Jimmy Bond, and drummers [[Larry Bunker]], Bob Neel, and [[Shelly Manne]]. Baker's quartet released popular albums between 1953 and 1956. Baker won reader's polls at ''[[Metronome (magazine)|Metronome]]'' and ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazines, beating trumpeters Miles Davis and Clifford Brown. In 1954, readers named Baker the top jazz vocalist. In 1956, [[Pacific Jazz Records]] released ''[[Chet Baker Sings]]'', an album that increased his visibility and drew criticism. Nevertheless, Baker sang throughout the rest of his career.

Hollywood studios saw an opportunity in Baker's chiseled features. He made his acting debut in the film ''[[Hell's Horizon]]'', released in the fall of 1955. He declined a studio contract, preferring life on the road as a musician. Over the next few years, Baker led his own combos, including a 1955 quintet with [[Francy Boland]], where Baker combined playing trumpet and singing. In 1956, he completed an eight-month tour of Europe, where he recorded ''Chet Baker in Europe.''<ref name="Inc.1956">{{cite magazine|title=Review spotlight on... Jazz Albums |magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA86|access-date=13 November 2015|date=10 November 1956|page=86}}</ref>

In late 1959, he returned to Europe, recording in Italy what became known as the Milano sessions, with arranger and conductor [[Ezio Leoni]] (Len Mercer) and his orchestra. Baker was arrested for drug possession and jailed in Lucca, forcing Leoni to communicate through the prison warden to coordinate arrangements with Baker as they prepared for recording.<ref>Chet Baker - 1959 Milano Sessions - Promo Sound, CD 4312 ADD</ref>

During most of the 1960s, Baker played [[flugelhorn]], and recorded music that could be classified as [[West Coast jazz]].<ref name="Ruhlmann" />

In 1963 he appeared, as himself, in the British film ''[[Stolen Hours]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/stolen-hours-v46945/cast-crew|title=Stolen Hours (1963) - Daniel Petrie &#124; Cast and Crew &#124; AllMovie}}</ref>

===Drug addiction and decline===
Baker said he began using heroin in 1957.<ref name="Gioia1998">{{cite book|author=Ted Gioia|title=West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California, 1945-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O-b1Qmta2wsC&pg=PA191|year=1998| publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21729-4|pages=191–}}</ref> Author Jeroen de Valk and pianist [[Russ Freeman (pianist)|Russ Freeman]] say that Baker started heroin in the early 1950s. Freeman was Baker's musical director after Baker left the Mulligan quartet. Sometimes Baker pawned his instruments to buy drugs. During the 1960s, he was imprisoned in Italy on drug charges and was expelled from Germany and the UK on drug-related offences. He was deported to the U.S. from Germany for getting into trouble with the law a second time. He settled in [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], California, performing in San Francisco and San Jose between jail terms for prescription fraud.<ref name="Ruhlmann">{{cite web|last1=Ruhlmann|first1=William|title=Chet Baker| url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chet-baker-mn0000094210/biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=13 November 2015}}</ref>

In 1966, Baker was beaten, probably while attempting to buy drugs,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Cool-jazz-s-tortured-king-Drugs-abuse-marked-3306745.php|title='Cool' jazz's tortured king / Drugs, abuse marked trumpeter's career|first=Joel|last=Selvin|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 12, 2002}}</ref> after performing at [[The Trident (restaurant)|The Trident restaurant]] in [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]]. In the film ''[[Let's Get Lost (1988 film)|Let's Get Lost]]'', Baker said an acquaintance attempted to rob him, but backed off, only to return the next night with a group of men who chased him. He entered a car and was surrounded. Instead of rescuing him, the people inside the car pushed him back out onto the street, where the chase continued. He received cuts and one of his teeth was cracked. This incident has been often misdated or otherwise exaggerated partly because of his own unreliable testimony on the matter.<ref name="Ruhlmann"/> The breaking of his tooth did, however, ruin his [[embouchure]], leaving him unable to play trumpet. He worked at a gas station until concluding that he had to find a way back to music, and retrained his embouchure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzS-euLdCvc|title=Chet Baker interview about drug and jazz1980| publisher=YouTube| language=it|access-date=12 February 2017}}</ref>

===Comeback===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
[[File:Getz&BakerSandvika1983x.jpg|thumb|Chet Baker (right) and [[Stan Getz]], 1983]]

After developing a new embouchure resulting from dentures, Baker returned to the straight-ahead jazz that began his career. He moved to New York City and began performing and recording again, including with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]]. Later in the 1970s, Baker returned to Europe, where he was assisted by his friend Diane Vavra, who took care of his personal needs and helped him during his recording and performance dates.

From 1978 until his death in 1988, Baker lived and played almost exclusively in Europe, returning to the U.S. once a year for a few performances. This was Baker's most prolific era as a recording artist.

In 1983, British singer [[Elvis Costello]], a longtime fan of Baker, hired the trumpeter to play a solo on his song "[[Shipbuilding (song)|Shipbuilding]]" for the album ''[[Punch the Clock]]''. The song exposed Baker's music to a new audience. Later, Baker often featured Costello's song "[[Almost Blue (song)|Almost Blue]]" (inspired by Baker's version of Ray Henderson's “The Thrill Is Gone", not to be confused with the Roy Hawkins song of the same name, made famous by B.B. King) in his concert sets, and recorded the song for ''Let's Get Lost''.

In 1986, ''Chet Baker: Live at Ronnie Scott's London'' presented Baker in an intimate stage performance filmed with Elvis Costello and [[Van Morrison]] as he performed a set of standards and classics, including "Just Friends", "My Ideal", and "Shifting Down". Augmenting the music, Baker spoke one-on-one with friend and colleague Costello about his childhood, career, and struggle with drugs.

Baker recorded the live album ''Chet Baker in Tokyo'' with his quartet featuring pianist [[Harold Danko]], bassist [[Hein Van de Geyn]], and drummer [[:nl:John Engels|John Engels]] {{in lang|nl}} less than a year before his death, and it was released posthumously. ''Silent Nights'', a recording of Christmas music, was recorded in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] with saxophonist Christopher Mason, pianist Michael Pellera, bass player James Singleton, and drummer Johnny Vidacovich in 1986 and released in 1987.

In 2006, "Jazz Icons: Chet Baker: Live in '64 & '79" was released, featuring two European concerts filmed 15 years apart. The 1964 performance took place in a Belgian TV studio, and the 1979 set was recorded in Norway. Other musicians featured are saxophonist Jacques Pelzer, French pianist René Urtreger, and vibraphonist [[Wolfgang Lackerschmid]]. Songs include the Miles Davis classic "So What", the jazz standard "Time After Time", "Blue Train", and many others. <!-- (retrieved from "Jazz Icons" series) -->

==Compositions==

Some of Baker's notable compositions include "[[Chetty's Lullaby]]", "[[Freeway (song)|Freeway]]", "Early Morning Mood", "Two a Day", "''[[So che ti perderò]]''" ("I Know I Will Lose You"), "''[[Il mio domani]]''" ("My Tomorrow"), "''[[Motivo su raggio di luna]]''" ("Contemplate on a Moonbeam"), "The Route", "Skidaddlin'", "New Morning Blues" (with [[Duke Jordan]]), "Blue Gilles", "Dessert", "Anticipated Blues", "Blues for a Reason",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Chet-Baker-Quintet-Featuring-Warne-Marsh-Blues-For-A-Reason/release/2593699|title=Chet Baker Quintet* Featuring Warne Marsh - Blues For A Reason|website=Discogs|access-date=January 30, 2019}}</ref> "We Know It's Love", and "Looking Good Tonight".

==Legacy==
Baker was photographed by [[William Claxton (photographer)|William Claxton]] for his book ''Young Chet: The Young Chet Baker''. An Academy Award-nominated 1988 documentary about Baker, ''[[Let's Get Lost (1988 film)|Let's Get Lost]]'', portrays him as a cultural icon of the 1950s, but juxtaposes this with his later image as a drug addict. The film, directed by fashion photographer [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], was shot in black-and-white, and includes a series of interviews with friends, family (including his three children by third wife Carol Baker), musical associates, and female friends, interspersed with footage from Baker's earlier life, and interviews with Baker in his last years. In ''Chet Baker, His Life and Music'', author De Valk and others criticize the film for presenting Baker as a "washed-up" musician in his later years. The film was shot during the first half of 1987, prior to career highlights such as the Japanese concert, released on ''[[Chet Baker in Tokyo]]''.

''Time after Time: The Chet Baker Project'', written by playwright James O'Reilly, toured Canada in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2001/legit/reviews/time-after-time-the-chet-baker-project-1200467920/ |title=Time After Time: The Chet Baker Project |first=Robert |last=Crew |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 6, 2001 |access-date=November 13, 2015}}</ref>

He is portrayed by [[Ethan Hawke]] in the 2015 film ''[[Born to Be Blue (film)|Born to Be Blue]]''. It is a reimagining of Baker's career in the late 1960s, when he is famous for both his music and his addiction, and he takes part in a movie about his life to boost his career.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/berlin-ethan-hawke-hawks-jazz-pic-1201423420/ |title=Berlin: Ethan Hawke Brings Jazz Pic 'Born to Be Blue' to Fest |first=Leo |last=Barraclough |work=Variety |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=November 13, 2015}}</ref> [[Steve Wall (actor)|Steve Wall]] plays Baker in the 2018 film ''[[My Foolish Heart (2018 film)|My Foolish Heart]]''.

Australian musician [[Chet Faker|Nick Murphy]] chose "Chet Faker" as his stage name as a tribute to Baker. Murphy said, "I listened to a lot of jazz and I was a big fan of ... the way he sang, when he moved into mainstream singing. He had this really fragile vocal style—this really, broken, close-up, and intimate style. The name is kind of just an ode to Chet Baker and the mood of music he used to play—something I would like to at least pay homage to in my own music."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-03-16|title=Discovery: Chet Faker|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/discovery-chet-faker|access-date=2021-03-13|website=Interview Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref>
