'''Dru Hill''' is an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] group, whose repertoire included [[soul music|soul]], [[hip hop soul]] and [[gospel music]]. The group was founded in [[Baltimore]] in 1992 and is still active. Dru Hill recorded seven [[Top 40]] hits, and is best known for the R&B number-one hits "[[In My Bed (Dru Hill song)|In My Bed]]", "[[Never Make a Promise]]", and "[[How Deep Is Your Love (Dru Hill song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]". Its original members were lead singer [[Sisqó|Mark "Sisqó" Andrews]], Tamir "Nokio" Ruffin, Larry "Jazz" Anthony and James "Woody Rock" Green. The group achieved popularity in the 1990s.

Signing to [[Island Records]] through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, ''[[Dru Hill (album)|Dru Hill]]'' and ''[[Enter the Dru]]'', before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisqó and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's ''Soul Music'' LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisqó's debut album, ''[[Unleash the Dragon]]'', and its hit singles, "[[Thong Song]]" and "Incomplete", were major pop successes, and established Sisqó as a household name outside Dru Hill. Sisqó's second album, ''[[Return of Dragon]]'', did not perform as well.

In 2002, by then part of the [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Soul]] record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Scola to the lineup for their third album, ''[[Dru World Order]]'', after that album underperformed the group met with New Label President LA Reid about a follow up . Due to groups failure to produce any new music featuring Sisqo(he chose not to lend his vocals to new recordings) Def Jam cited the group as non productive and destructive and dropped the group from Def Soul. In 2009, the group signed to Kedar Entertainment Group and released their fourth album, ''[[InDRUpendence Day]]'', the following year, with new member Tao taking the place of the again departed Woody.

==History==

===Early career===
The members of Dru Hill are natives of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore.]] The group became known getting jobs at The Fudgery, a local [[fudge]] factory at [[Harborplace]] at Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]], beginning a store tradition of singing and performing to entertain guests while making fudge.<ref name="fudgery">{{Cite web|title=The Fudgery's Company History |publisher=The Fudgery |url=http://fudgeryfudge.com/about.html |format=ASP |access-date=June 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106085111/http://www.fudgeryfudge.com/about.html |archive-date=January 6, 2015 }}</ref> The group's name comes from Baltimore's [[Druid Hill Park]], which is commonly shortened in the [[Baltimore accent|local vernacular]] to "Dru Hill".

Between their first and second albums, Dru Hill contributed "We're Not Making Love No More", a number 2 R&B and number 13 pop hit, to the ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'' [[soundtrack]]. "We're Not Making Love No More" was written and produced by producer [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]]. Dru Hill and [[rapper]] [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]] recorded "Big Bad Mama", a remake of [[Carl Carlton]]'s 1981 hit "She's a Bad Mama Jama (She's Built, She's Stacked)", which was the main single for the soundtrack to the 1997 [[Bill Bellamy]] film ''[[Def Jam's How to Be a Player]]''. The group was also instrumental in writing and producing for new University artist [[Mýa]], whose first two singles "[[It's All About Me]]" and "[[Movin' On (Mýa song)|Movin' On]]", were co-written by Sisqó, who also performs guest vocals on "It's All About Me".{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In 1997, Dru Hill filed a lawsuit against Island Records, seeking a release from its contract, after an Island employee hit one of the group's managers, Keith Ingram, over the head with a [[pool cue]].<ref name=Brown>Brown, Ann (March 1998).

At an October 1997 deposition hearing, Eric Kronfeld, president and [[chief operating officer]] of Island's parent company [[PolyGram]], was asked why he had hired such an individual. His response was that if he were not to hire African-Americans with criminal records, then "there would be virtually no African-Americans employees in our society or in our industry."<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428392/11131997/dru_hill.jhtml#/news/articles/1428393/11121997/dru_hill.jhtml "Dru Hill Suit Thickens And Settles?"] ''MTV.com'', November 12, 1997.

Kronfield's remarks set off a wave of controversy when word of them reached the media in November. The Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] became personally involved, publicly stating that the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-based PolyGram had "a pattern of race and sex exclusion."<ref name=Brown /> Jackson met with PolyGram chairman Alain Levy and several other executives, who issued a public apology for Kronfield's statement, and replaced Kronfield as president with [[Motown Records]]' chairman Clarence Avant.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428392/11131997/dru_hill.jhtml#/news/articles/1428392/11131997/dru_hill.jhtml "PolyGram Apologizes for Racist Executive, Jesse Jackson Councils"], ''MTV.com'', November 13, 1997.

===''Enter the Dru''===
Dru Hill's third Top 20 pop hit came in the form of 1998's "How Deep Is Your Love" (Pop #3), which was included on the soundtrack to the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Chris Tucker]] film ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]''. The single "This Is What We Do", featuring a guest rap from [[Method Man]] , set the tone for the group's second album, ''[[Enter the Dru]]''. The album featured several other mid-tempo tracks in the vein of "How Deep Is Your Love", as well as the R&B Top 5 single "These are the Times" (Pop #21), co-written and co-produced by Babyface, and featuring guitar work from Atlanta-based session guitarist and former [[Earth Wind & Fire]] member Dick Smith.

''Enter the Dru'' eventually sold two million copies by 1999.<ref name="RIAA-certification">RIAA certifications for Dru Hill. Retrieved from [https://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp Recording Industry Association of America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228071417/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp |date=February 28, 2007 }} website by way of database search, on May 24, 2007.</ref> That year, Dru Hill recorded a version of "Enchantment Passing Through" for the soundtrack to the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'', which was also featured on Sisqó's album ''Unleash the Dragon''.

Sisqó released his debut ''[[Unleash the Dragon]]'' LP, and had a minor hit with his first single, "Got to Get It" featuring [[Make It Hot]]. His second single, "[[Thong Song]]", became a major hit during the spring of 2000, and his third, "[[Incomplete (Sisqó song)|Incomplete]]", became a number-one hit during the summer.

===''Dru World Order''===
''Dru World Order'' was released on November 26, 2002, two years after its original planned release date. Nearly all of the album's tracks were produced by Nokio, who sung lead on the tracks "She Said" and "Men Always Regret". Producers such as [[Bryan Michael Cox]], Eric "Nealante" Phillips and [[Kwamé]] also made contributions. Most of the album's tracks featured Sisqó, Jazz, Woody, and Scola sharing the leads, including the lead single "I Should Be...". "I Should Be..." was a Top 30 pop hit and a Top 10 R&B hit.

Def Soul released a [[greatest hits]] compilation, ''Dru Hill: Hits'', on October 11, along with a corresponding [[DVD]] collection of the group's music videos. Both collections included Sisqó's biggest solo hits, "Thong Song" and "Incomplete", alongside the Dru Hill songs.

===Woody's and Scola's departure===
In early 2008, the original quartet version of Dru Hill began touring alongside fellow 1990s acts [[Tony! Toni! Toné!]], [[Bell Biv Devoe]], and a former producer on their first Album Keith Sweat. The group held a contest in their native Baltimore for a replacement for Woody, settling upon a new singer, Antwuan "Tao" Simpson. The group never said why they did not keep Scola in the group, although it was later stated by Nokio that "five people [mess] up the money".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCZz3AWgN0A|title=Dru Hill sing Lately and respond to departure of Woody...|last=Behind The Music Tales|date=June 29, 2008|access-date=April 28, 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>

===''InDRUpendence Day''===
''[[InDRUpendence Day]]'' is Dru Hill's fourth album, released on July 27, 2010. It features the group's new member, Tao, who was Woody's replacement. The album has released three singles: "Love MD", "Remain Silent" and "Back to the Future". It was released under the label Kedar Entertainment.

===''The Second Coming''===
Jazz left the group in early 2018 to work on his solo album and Tao left in early 2019 to work on a solo project because he did not like the direction Dru Hill was going.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://youknowigotsoul.com/tao-soprano-discusses-leaving-dru-hill-how-he-got-start-with-group-solo-project-exclusive |title=Tao Soprano Discusses Leaving Dru Hill, How He Got Start With Group, Solo Project (Exclusive) |author=YKIGS |date=11 May 2019 |work=[[YouKnowIGotSoul]] |access-date=11 November 2019}}</ref>
