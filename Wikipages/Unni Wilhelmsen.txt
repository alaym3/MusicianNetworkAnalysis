'''Unni Elisabeth Wilhelmsen''' (born 12 July 1971) is a Norwegian singer, songwriter, and musician. Her musical influences are pop music and the American tradition of the singer-songwriter in which the lyrics play an important role as well as the music.<ref name=mic>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mic.no/nmi.nsf/micdoc/art2006053111032095219501 |title=Unni Wilhelmsen Biography – Norsk musikkinformasjon MIC.no}} (in Norwegian)</ref> She lives in Oslo but has throughout her career had the whole of Norway as a venue. When she made her breakthrough in 1996 with her debut album ''[[To Whom It May Concern (Unni Wilhelmsen album)|To Whom It May Concern]]'' ([[Polygram]]), she became an important mediator of the singer-songwriter genre, a genre that has a broad audience in Norwegian popular music.<ref name=snl>{{Cite web |url=http://snl.no/Unni_Wilhelmsen |title=Unni Wilhelmsen – Biography}} [[Store Norske Leksikon]] (in Norwegian)</ref><ref name=puls>{{Cite web |url=http://www.puls.no/16241.html |title=Unni Wilhelmsen: 7 – Puls.no}} (in Norwegian)</ref>

== Career ==
Wilhelmsen was born in [[Oslo]].  She was given a guitar as a teenager and so the guitar became her first instrument. However, she had always dreamed of playing the piano, and later took it up. Her first tune featuring the piano came in 2006. She writes most of her music herself, but from time to time collaborates with others. Wilhelmsen is a full-time musician and releases her music on her own [[indie label]], ''St. Cecilia Music''. In addition to pursuing her solo career, in September 2013, Unni joined the Norwegian Band "[[Di Derre]]" as a guitarist and vocalist.

Her debut as singer was at ''Smuget'' in Oslo, where music journalist [[Finn Bjelke]] was present. He liked what he heard and mentioned her to music producer [[Ole Evenrud]] at [[Polygram]].<ref name=mic/> This led to her first record contract, and her debut album ''To Whom It May Concern'' was released on Polygram 1996. She was awarded [[Spellemannprisen]] 1996 in two categories for this album.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.artist.no/artister/unni-wilhelmsen.aspx |title=Unni Wilhelmsen – JS Artist.no}}</ref> International release on [[Universal Music]] of ''To whom it may concern'' in Germany followed, but her international career was slow to develop. She started her own record company to be in charge. Now her audience outside Norway is growing; in effect she functions as her own distributor and a subcontractor for her former label, Universal.<ref name=snl/>

==Private life==
Wilhelmsen lives in Oslo, Norway. She has installed her own studio in the kitchen, ''Fett Studio'', and most of her album ''Til Meg'' (St. Cecilia Music, 2006) was recorded there.<ref name=mic/>
