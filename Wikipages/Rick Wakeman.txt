'''Richard Christopher Wakeman''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 18 May 1949) is an English keyboardist, songwriter, producer, television and radio presenter, actor and author. He is best known for being in the [[progressive rock]] band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] across five tenures between 1971 and 2004 and for his solo albums released in the 1970s.

Born and raised in [[West London (sub region)|West London]], Wakeman intended to be a concert pianist but quit his studies at the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1969 to become a full-time [[session musician]]. His early sessions included playing on "[[Space Oddity]]", among others, for [[David Bowie]], and songs by [[Junior's Eyes]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], [[Elton John]], and [[Cat Stevens]]. Wakeman became a member of [[Strawbs|The Strawbs]] in 1970 before joining Yes a year later, playing on some of their most successful albums across two stints until 1980. Wakeman began his solo career in 1973; his highest-selling solo albums are his first three: ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' (1973), ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Earth (album)|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'' (1974), and ''[[The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table]]'' (1975), all [[concept albums]]. He formed his rock band, The English Rock Ensemble, in 1974, with which he continues to perform, and scored his first film, ''[[Lisztomania (film)|Lisztomania]]'' (1975).

Wakeman pursued solo projects in the 1980s that varied in levels of success; his most successful album was [[1984 (Rick Wakeman album)|''1984'']], released in 1981, which was followed by his minor pop hit single, "Glory Boys", from ''[[Silent Nights]]'' (1985). He hosted the television show ''[[Gastank]]'', and recorded his first of several [[New-age music|New-age]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[Christian music]] albums with ''[[Country Airs]]'' (1986) and ''The Gospels'' (1987), respectively. From 1988 to 1990 he was a member of [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]] which led to his third Yes stint until 1992. He returned twice more between 1995 and 2004, during which he completed several more solo projects and tours, including his most significant of the decade, ''[[Return to the Centre of the Earth]]'' (1999). From 2016 to 2020, Wakeman was a member of [[Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman]]. He continues to record albums and perform concerts worldwide in various capacities; his most recent album is ''[[The Red Planet]]'' (2020).

Wakeman's [[Rick Wakeman discography|discography]] includes over 90 solo albums<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.worthingherald.co.uk/leisure/INTERVIEW-Rick-Wakeman39s-Grumpy-Old.3942964.jp | title= INTERVIEW: Rick Wakeman's Grumpy Old Picture Show | work=Worthing Herald | date= 3 April 2008 |access-date=12 July 2010}}</ref> spanning a range of musical styles. He has made many television and radio appearances; in recent years he became known for his contributions to the BBC comedy series ''[[Grumpy Old Men (TV series)|Grumpy Old Men]]'', ''[[Watchdog (TV programme)|Watchdog]]'' and his radio show on [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]] that aired from 2005 to 2010. Wakeman has written three books; an autobiography and two memoirs. In 2017, Wakeman was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of [[Yes (band)|Yes]].<ref name="rrhofyes">{{cite web|title=Inductees: Yes|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/yes|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref>

==Early life==
Wakeman was born on 18 May 1949 in the west London suburb of [[Perivale]].<ref name=wooding23>Wooding 1979, p. 23.</ref> The only child of Cyril Frank Wakeman and Mildred Helen Wakeman (née Eastment),<ref name=wooding23/> the three lived in Wood End Gardens in nearby [[Northolt]].<ref name=wooding46/> Cyril played the piano in a dance band while he was in the army<ref name=wooding23/> and worked at a [[Building material|building suppliers]], joining as an office boy at fourteen to become one of its directors.

When Wakeman turned seven, his father paid for weekly piano lessons with Dorothy Symes which lasted for eleven years. She recalled that Wakeman "passed everything with a distinction" and was an "enjoyable pupil to teach, full of fun and with a good sense of humour", but noted his lack of self-discipline when it came to practising.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 24.</ref> In 1960, Symes entered Wakeman in his first music competition<ref name=1991tourbook/><ref name=wooding25>Wooding 1979, p. 25.</ref> and he went on to win many awards, certificates, and cups in contests held around London.<ref name=woodig28/> Wakeman then took up the clarinet at age twelve<ref name=1991tourbook/> and in his teenage years, attended church and learned the [[church organ]], became a [[Sunday school]] teacher, and chose to be baptised at eighteen.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 26.</ref><ref name=contemporarykeyboard1976>{{Cite journal|journal=Contemporary Keyboard|title=Rick Wakeman: Rock Powerhouse|date=March 1976|first=Dominic|last=Milano|url=http://zenponies.com/yitp/1976/mar/marxx_76.html}}</ref>

Wakeman described himself at school as "a horror ... I worked hard in the first year, then eased up".<ref name=wooding29/> In 1961, during his time at Drayton Manor school, Wakeman played in his first band, the [[trad jazz]] outfit Brother Wakeman and the Clergymen,<ref name=chorleyguardian2015>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chorley-guardian.co.uk/what-s-on/music/the-interview-rick-wakeman-1-7442858|title=The interview: Rick Wakeman|date=3 September 2015|first=Malcolm|last=Wyatt|publisher=Chorley Guardian|access-date=13 January 2016}}</ref> with a uniform of the school shirt put on the wrong way round.<ref name=1991tourbook/> In 1963, at fourteen, Wakeman joined the Atlantic Blues, a local blues group that secured a year's residency at a mental health rehabilitation club in [[Neasden]].<ref name=1991tourbook/><ref name=woodig27>Wooding 1979, p. 27.</ref> Two years later, Wakeman passed his [[GCE Ordinary Level|O Levels]] in English, maths, art and music, and went on to study music, art, and British constitution at [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-level]].<ref name=1991tourbook/> In 1966, he joined the Concordes, later known as the Concorde Quartet, playing dance and pop songs at local events with his cousin [[Alan Wakeman]] on saxophone and clarinet.<ref name=woodig28>Wooding 1979, p. 28.</ref> Wakeman used the money earned from their gigs to buy a [[Pianet]], his first electronic instrument.<ref name=woodig28/>

That year he also formed a dance band called the Green Dolphin Trio, spending a year's residency at a social club in [[Alperton]], and Curdled Milk, a joke on "[[Strange Brew (song)|Strange Brew]]" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]], to play at the annual school dance.<ref name=1991tourbook/> The band were unpaid after Wakeman lost control of his car and drove across the headmaster's rose garden at the front of the school, thereby forfeiting their performance fee to pay for the damage.<ref name=woodig27/> In 1967, Wakeman began a tenure with the Ronnie Smith Band, a dance group based at the [[Top Rank Suite|Top Rank]] ballroom in [[Watford]]. He was sacked in the following year after not taking the dance music seriously enough, but was reinstated and performed in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. It was there where he met their singer Ashley Holt, who later sang on many of Wakeman's future albums and tours.<ref name=1991tourbook/>

In 1968, Wakeman secured a place at the [[Royal College of Music]] in London, studying the piano, clarinet, [[orchestration]], and modern music, with the intention of becoming a concert pianist.<ref name=1976tourbook/> To enter he needed to pass eight music exams to earn his [[A-level]] in the subject, which required him, as his mother remembered, "to do two years' work in ten months".<ref name=wooding29>Wooding 1979, p. 29.</ref> Wakeman put in the effort following a ten [[shilling]] bet with his music teacher who believed he would not succeed,<ref name=wooding29/> and refusing his father's offer to work with him.<ref name=wooding30>Wooding 1979, p. 30.</ref> Wakeman joined the Royal College on a performers course before a change to the teachers course, but quickly found out that "everyone else there was at least as good as me; and a lot of them much better."<ref name=1976tourbook/> He adopted a more relaxed attitude to his studies, spending much of his time drinking in pubs and with the staff at the Musical Bargain Centre, a music shop in [[Ealing]].<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 61.</ref>

Wakeman's first booking as a [[session musician]], and his first time in a recording studio, occurred when guitarist [[Chas Cronk]] entered the shop one morning in need of an organist and brass arranger for members of the [[Ike & Tina Turner]] band.<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 62.</ref> During the session Wakeman met producers [[Tony Visconti]], [[Gus Dudgeon]], and [[Denny Cordell]]<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 64.</ref><ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 66.</ref> Cordell was impressed with his performance and offered him more session work for artists at [[Regal Zonophone Records]], which Wakeman accepted<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 69.</ref> and he began skipping college in favour of sessions.<ref name=1976tourbook/>

==Career==
===1969–1971: Session work, The Strawbs, and joining Yes===
In 1969, Wakeman left the Royal College of Music to become a full-time session musician, playing keyboards and arranging music for various artists between fifteen and eighteen times a week.<ref name=contemporarykeyboard1976/><ref name=1991tourbook/> His ability to produce what was needed in a short amount of time led to his nickname, One Take Wakeman.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 112.</ref> Among his first sessions were playing on ''Battersea Power Station'' by [[Junior's Eyes]] and, in June 1969, the [[Mellotron]] on "[[Space Oddity]]" by [[David Bowie]] for a £9 fee after [[Gus Dudgeon|Dudgeon]] needed a player, as neither knew much about the instrument.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 34.</ref><ref>Wooding 1979, p. 37.</ref> Wakeman went on to play on several tracks for Bowie's second album, ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'', and organ and piano on American singer [[Tucker Zimmerman]]'s only single, "Red Wind".<ref>{{cite web|last=Marchese |first=Joe |url=http://theseconddisc.com/2015/11/10/rpm-reissues-lost-album-by-david-bowie-favorite-tucker-zimmerman-collects-australian-dream-babes/ |title=RPM Reissues Lost Album By David Bowie Favorite Tucker Zimmerman, Collects Australian "Dream Babes" |publisher=The Second Disc |date=10 November 2015 |access-date=21 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuckerzimmerman.org/discography/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131021182828/http://www.tuckerzimmerman.org/discography |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 October 2013 |title=Discography |publisher=Tucker Zimmerman |access-date=21 November 2015 }}</ref> During this time, Wakeman left the Ronnie Smith group and, for several months, played in a pub band named the Spinning Wheel.<ref name=1991tourbook/> Visconti had Wakeman play a single bass note on the piano at the end of "[[I Walk on Guilded Splinters|Walk On Guilded Splinters]]" by [[Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1946)|Marsha Hunt]] so he could be paid the session fee.<ref name=holmes/> In 1970, Wakeman performed on ''Seasons'' by [[Magna Carta (band)|Magna Carta]],<ref name=contemporarykeyboard1976/> and records by [[Brotherhood of Man]], Paper Bubble, [[Shawn Phillips]], and [[White Plains (band)|White Plains]]. He soon became disillusioned with session work, "I was getting good bread, but I wasn't getting a chance to be part of the music".<ref name=contemporarykeyboard1976/>

Wakeman's prominence rose during his tenure with the [[folk rock]] group [[Strawbs|The Strawbs]] from 1969 to 1971. He first played the piano for them as a session musician on ''[[Dragonfly (Strawbs album)|Dragonfly]]'', the first album released with Wakeman's name on its credits.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 52.</ref> In March 1970, he joined the band as a full-time member and married his first wife, Rosaline Woolford, at the age of twenty.<ref name=wooding46>Wooding 1979, p. 46.</ref> The group then performed a series of dates in Paris for a rock and roll circus with various bands backing the circus acts. During one performance, Wakeman pushed [[Salvador Dalí]] off the stage as he made a special guest appearance during his piano solo. He wrote, "I didn't know who he was. I thought, 'Silly old sod, coming on the stage waving his stick'."<ref>Wooding 1979, pp. 54–55.</ref><ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 94.</ref> Wakeman's first major show with The Strawbs followed on 11 July 1970 at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London which was recorded for their live album, ''[[Just a Collection of Antiques and Curios]]''. The set included an extended organ solo and Wakeman's piano piece titled "Temperament of Mind", which received a standing ovation.<ref>Wooding 1979, pp. 56–57.</ref> The piece originated from improvisations when the band would lose power during a show, leaving Wakeman to fill time by playing the piano. Following the Queen Elizabeth Hall concert, Wakeman appeared on the front page of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' for the first time; the paper named him "tomorrow's superstar".<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 58.</ref>

During the writing sessions for the next Strawbs album, Wakeman resumed session work to help pay for his new home in [[West Harrow]].<ref name=wakeman1995-103>Wakeman 1995, p. 103.</ref> He bought a [[Minimoog]] synthesizer at half price from actor [[Jack Wild]], who thought that it was defective because it only played [[Monophony|one note at a time]].<ref name="interview_2009">{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Jeb |title=Henry at the Hampton: An Exclusive Interview with Rick Wakeman |publisher=Classic Rock Revisited |year=2009 |url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewrickwakeman.htm |access-date=26 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116190637/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewrickwakeman.htm |archive-date=16 November 2009 }}</ref> Wakeman played the piano on "[[Morning Has Broken]]" by [[Cat Stevens]] for his 1971 album, ''[[Teaser and the Firecat]]''. Wakeman was omitted from the credits and for many years, was never paid for it; Stevens later apologised and paid Wakeman for the error. Wakeman played further sessions in 1971, including "[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]" by [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], three tracks on ''[[Madman Across the Water]]'' by [[Elton John]], and "[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]", "[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]", and "[[Life on Mars?]]" for Bowie's album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''. Bowie invited Wakeman to his home and played the outline of the tracks for him to learn; Wakeman later called them "the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life".<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 105.</ref> He also developed music for the 1972 film, ''[[Zee and Co.]]''<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 77.</ref> In late 1971, an album compiled of pop tunes played by Wakeman on the piano was released as ''[[Piano Vibrations]]'' by [[Polydor Records]]. Wakeman did not receive any royalties from it; he was paid £36 for the four sessions it took to make.<ref>Wooding, pp. 107–108.</ref>

Wakeman's final album with The Strawbs, ''[[From the Witchwood]]'', was released in July 1971. It marked the growing differences between himself and the group; he made the better paid sessions a priority and made no substantial contributions to the writing of the music.<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 104.</ref> With his income from The Strawbs failing to cover his mortgage and bills, Wakeman opted to leave. In July 1971, he was faced with "one of the most difficult decisions" of his career after Bowie chose him for his new backing band, [[The Spiders from Mars]], with guitarist [[Mick Ronson]]. Later the same day, he received a call at two in the morning from bassist [[Chris Squire]] of the [[progressive rock]] group [[Yes (band)|Yes]], who explained that Yes needed a keyboardist as [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]] had been asked to leave, following his resistance to learn instruments other than the piano and organ.<ref name=welch113>Welch 2008, p. 113.</ref><ref name="Valentine">{{cite news |title= Just Another Yes Man... |first=Penny |last=Valentine |author-link=Penny Valentine |newspaper=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] |publisher= Spotlight Publications |date= 28 August 1971|page= 7}}</ref> Wakeman agreed to meet the band as they rehearsed for their fourth album, ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'', in August 1971. During his first session, the basis of "[[Heart of the Sunrise]]" and "[[Roundabout (song)|Roundabout]]" were put together.<ref>Morse 1996, p. 27.</ref> Thinking that Yes presented more favourable opportunities for his career, Wakeman declined Bowie's offer and played his final gig with The Strawbs for a BBC recording for [[John Peel]]'s radio show. Wakeman then reappeared on the front cover of ''Melody Maker'', his second in a year, regarding his move to Yes.<ref>Wakeman 1995, pp. 108–109.</ref> His earnings increased from £18 to £50 per week.<ref name=telegraph2014/> Towards the end of 1971, Wakeman signed a five album solo recording contract with [[A&M Records]].<ref name=1991tourbook/><ref name=rockcellar2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2017/01/12/rick-wakeman-interview-piano-portraits-yes-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-david-bowie/#sthash.sKeo1PtR.dpbs|title=Rick Wakeman: On 'Piano Portraits,' David Bowie, Yes in the Rock Hall of Fame and More (Q&A)|publisher=Rock Cellar Magazine|first=Ken|last=Sharp|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref>

===1971–1974: First Yes run, ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII'', and ''Journey to the Centre of the Earth''===
Yes made ''Fragile'' in five weeks, partly to resume touring quickly so they could finance a new set of keyboards for Wakeman. The album features a solo track written by each member; Wakeman's track, "Cans and Brahms", is adaptation of the third movement of [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 4]] by [[Johannes Brahms]] played on electronic keyboards.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 115.</ref> He called it "dreadful" as contractual disputes between [[Atlantic Records]], who had signed Yes, and A&M prevented him from writing his own composition.<ref>Morse 1996, p. 29.</ref> Wakeman claimed he was never credited for his contributions on ''Fragile'', including piano sections on "[[Heart of the Sunrise]]" and "[[South Side of the Sky]]", despite being told that management would sort the issue. He enjoyed the music too much to cause further rifts.<ref>Welch 2008, p. 117.</ref> ''Fragile'' reached the top ten in the UK and the US, and the [[Fragile Tour]] marked Wakeman's first visit to North America.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 73.</ref> Its commercial success allowed Wakeman to buy a new home in [[Gerrards Cross]] and start car collection,<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 117.</ref> which he rented out through his new business, the Fragile Carriage Company.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 82.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.duedil.com/company/01214548/fragile-carriage-company-limited-the |title=The Fragile Carriage Company Limited |publisher=DueDil |date=1975-06-02 |access-date=2015-09-05}}</ref> In late 1971, Wakeman played two notable piano sessions, on "It Ain't Easy" on Bowie's album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' and on ''[[Orange (Al Stewart album)|Orange]]'' by [[Al Stewart]].

In the 1972 ''Melody Maker'' readers' poll, Wakeman ranked second in the Top Keyboardist category behind [[Keith Emerson]].<ref name=wooding-89-90>Wooding 1979, pp. 89–90.</ref> That year, Yes followed ''Fragile'' with ''[[Close to the Edge]]'' which is considered a landmark progressive rock album and features Wakeman playing a church organ and harpsichord. He is credited on the final track, "[[Siberian Khatru]]". Wakeman picked the album as "one of the finest moments of Yes's career."<ref>Morse 1996, p. 152.</ref> The [[Close to the Edge Tour]] marked the first time Wakeman wore a cape on stage after a fan offered his own for one of the band members to wear. He then had his own made; the first was made of sequins and cost US$300.<ref name=wooding-85>Wooding 1979, p. 85.</ref> Wakeman is featured on the concert film ''[[Yessongs (film)|Yessongs]]'', filmed in 1972 at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] which features his solo spot in the show. Also that month at the venue, Wakeman was a guest musician at [[The Who]]'s orchestral performances of ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]''.

In January 1973, Wakeman released his debut solo album, ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]''.<ref name=wooding98/> It was recorded in 1972 during gaps in touring and recording with Yes, and features members of the band, the Strawbs, and other guest musicians. The album is instrumental with its [[concept album|concept]] based on Wakeman's musical interpretations of the characteristics of the [[wives of Henry VIII|six wives]] of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The album was previewed with Wakeman performing excerpts on the BBC television show, ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]''.<ref name=wooding98>Wooding 1979, p. 98.</ref> Much of the television audience that night planned to watch ''[[Blue Movie]]'', a controversial film by [[Andy Warhol]], but it was temporarily banned from being broadcast. Wakeman explained: "It seems most of them, rather than watch repeats, switched over to ''Whistle Test'' and saw my preview of ''Henry'' ... and suddenly it seemed as if the whole country had discovered my music ... it was a tremendous break."<ref name=wooding99>Wooding 1979, p. 99.</ref> The album reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 30 in the US, and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named the record one of the best albums of the year.<ref>{{cite news | title=Music: The Year's Best | date=31 December 1973 | work=Time Magazine | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910925,00.html | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20081214065014/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910925,00.html | url-status =dead | archive-date =14 December 2008 | access-date =21 June 2010 }}</ref> At the ''Melody Maker'' readers poll awards in September 1973, Wakeman came out first in the top keyboardist category.<ref name=wooding-89-90/> 

Yes's double concept album ''[[Tales from Topographic Oceans]]'' was released in November 1973, containing four side long pieces based on ideas from Hindu scriptures in ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'' by [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]. Wakeman had doubts about its esoteric concept, and felt a lot of its music was too experimental which required further rehearsal. He distanced himself from the group, and spent time in the bar at [[Morgan Studios]] and played on "Sabbra Caddabra" on ''[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]'' by [[Black Sabbath]] in the adjacent studio.<ref>''I am Ozzy''.

Pages 160–162. {{ISBN|978-0-446-56989-7}}.</ref> Yes toured the album for six months, playing the album in its entirety which Wakeman also disagreed with. He openly criticised the album to the press, and his growing frustrations culminated in an incident whereby he ate a curry on stage during a show in [[Manchester]].<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 110.</ref> In 2006, Wakeman clarified that his total dislike of the album is "not entirely true" and recognises some "very, very nice musical moments", but "we had too much for a single album but not enough for a double, so we padded it out and the padding is awful".<ref>{{cite video|people=Wakeman, Rick|date=2007|minutes=1:23:48–1:24:49|title=Classic Artists: Yes.

During the ''Topographic Oceans'' tour Wakeman recorded his new 40-minute work ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Earth (album)|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'', based on [[Jules Verne]]'s same-titled [[A Journey to the Center of the Earth|science-fiction novel]]. He came up with the idea in 1971, but shelved the project until ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII'' was complete.<ref name=journeyprogramme>Concert programme for ''Rick Wakeman: Journey to the Centre of the Earth''. 18 January 1974.</ref> After working on the music with [[Lou Reizner]], [[David Measham]], [[Wil Malone]], and Danny Beckerman,<ref name="Wooding 1979, p. 13">Wooding 1979, p. 13.</ref><ref>Wooding 1979, p. 11.</ref><ref name=wood12>Wooding 1979, p. 12.</ref> which features an orchestra, choir, and a rock band, Wakeman chose to record the piece in concert due to the high costs of a studio.<ref name=wood12/> To help finance the project, he sold some of his cars and "mortgage[d himself] up to the hilt", all of which cost around £40,000.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 15.</ref> Two concerts were held at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]] on 18 January 1974 with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], the [[English Chamber Choir]], actor [[David Hemmings]] as narrator, and a five-piece band formed of musicians that Wakeman played with in a west London pub: vocalists Ashley Holt and [[Gary Pickford-Hopkins]], drummer [[Barney James]], bassist Roger Newell, and guitarist Mike Egan.<ref name="Wooding 1979, p. 13"/> A&M wanted more better known musicians, but Wakeman wanted the album to be known for its music rather than the performers.<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 120.</ref> After cutting the album A&M refused to sell it,<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 123.</ref> but as Wakeman was under contract with its US division, a cassette was sent to co-founder [[Jerry Moss]] who liked it and ordered its worldwide release.<ref name="Wakeman 1995, p. 124">Wakeman 1995, p. 124.</ref>

After touring ''Topographic Oceans'', Wakeman retreated to his Devonshire home. He heard early ideas for Yes's next album, felt he could no longer contribute to the style of music they were making, and confirmed his departure from the band on his twenty-fifth birthday. Later that day, A&M informed him that ''Journey'' had entered the UK charts at No. 1, a first for the label.<ref name="Wakeman 1995, p. 124"/><ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 125.</ref> ''Journey'' also reached No. 3 in the US, and earned Wakeman a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] nomination.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 22.</ref> The album has sold an estimated 14 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rick Wakeman, six wives and one hell of a party|date=1 May 2009|work=The Times|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6200354.ece|access-date=28 October 2010}}</ref> On 27 July 1974, Wakeman headlined the [[Crystal Palace Bowl|Crystal Palace Garden Party concert]], performing selections from ''Six Wives'' and ''Journey'' in its entirety.<ref>Wooding 1979, pp. 120–121.</ref> By this time, his excessive smoking and alcohol consumption, a lack of sleep five days prior to the show, and a wrist injury from a fall, took a toll on his health, and he needed morphine injections to get through the performance.

===1974–1980: ''King Arthur'', ''No Earthly Connection'', second Yes run, and ''Criminal Record''===
During his recovery at [[Wexham Park Hospital]], Wakeman wrote "The Last Battle", the first song for his new concept album, ''[[The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table]]''. Despite being advised to reduce his workload and improve his health, Wakeman continued with his career as well as his smoking and drinking.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 126.</ref> He began a 20-date North American tour in September 1974 with the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]], the Choir of America, and his rock band. Under doctors' orders, Wakeman was required to pass a heart monitor test before each performance.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 128.</ref> Wakeman later revealed that the tour cost him £125,000.

In January 1975, Wakeman finished recording ''King Arthur'' at [[Morgan Studios]] with the New World Orchestra, English Chamber Choir, and the Nottingham Festival Vocal Group.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 133.</ref> Based on the stories about [[King Arthur]] and related figures, its release in April 1975 was a commercial success, reaching No. 2 in the UK and No. 21 in the US. It also earned Gold certifications in Brazil, Japan, and Australia.<ref>Booklet notes to Wakeman's 1994 live album, ''Live on the Test'' (1994).</ref> The album was promoted with three sold out shows at [[Wembley Arena]] in May 1975 with Wakeman performing the album with an orchestra, choir, and his rock band to a total of 27,000 people. As the arena floor was already set up as an ice rink for a different attraction, Wakeman chose to present the show as an ice pageant with fourteen ice skaters and the musicians' stage placed in the round and decorated as a castle. The shows, though well received and a contributory factor to the album's commercial success, were expensive to produce.<ref name="interview_2009"/><ref>{{cite web| last = Miller | first = Jonathan | title = Rick Wakeman: Cirque Surreal | publisher=Sound On Sound |date = November 1995| url = http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/nov95/rickwakeman.html?print=yes | access-date =26 October 2009 }}</ref> 

Before production even began, animal-welfare groups called for the show to be shut down once it was announced horses would be part of it, a clamour Wakeman stilled only with a press conference in which it was shown that they were to be ''wooden'' horses. At the actual show, there were several instances where props and costumes, including Wakeman's, failed visibly. The [[Theatrical smoke and fog#Carbon dioxide and dry ice|dry ice fog]] caused mist to accumulate over the ice, making it hard for musicians to see their instruments.<ref name="2020 Vanity Fair story">{{cite magazine|last=Kushner|first=David|title=The Stranger-Than-Fiction Secret History of Prog-Rock Icon Rick Wakeman|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/the-stranger-than-fiction-secret-history-of-prog-rock-icon-rick-wakeman|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=June 25, 2020|access-date=July 24, 2021}}</ref>

At the end, six skaters dressed as knights took the ice and fought to their mutual "deaths". Well before the song was over, one knight appeared to have survived, skating aimlessly around the ice. Wakeman realized that one of the skaters had called in sick that day and the production had failed to find a replacement. The skater solved the problem by pretending to throw himself on his sword.<ref name="2020 Vanity Fair story" />

In 2009, the concerts were listed in 79th position on the ''100 Greatest Shocking Moments in Rock and Roll'' program broadcast on [[VH1]].<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Most Shocking Moments in Rock & Roll |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=62200 |publisher=Vh1.com |access-date=17 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605050147/http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=62200 |archive-date=5 June 2011 }}</ref> By 2008, the album had sold an estimated 12 million copies worldwide.<ref name=timesinterview>{{cite web| title = Prog Rock Britannia celebrates the men in loon pants| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5320354.ece |author=John Bungey|work=The Times |location=UK | date= 20 December 2008 |access-date =2 March 2010}}</ref>

Wakeman toured ''King Arthur'' with an augmented formation of the English Rock Ensemble for three months from October 1975, across North and South America.<ref name=1976tourbook/> The tour marked his first association with new drummer [[Tony Fernandez (musician)|Tony Fernandez]] who would perform on many of Wakeman's future albums and tours. During its stop in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Wakeman met [[Ronnie Biggs]], one of those involved in the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|1963 Great Train Robbery]]. The two went drinking, played football, and exchanged a gift of shirts, including one that Biggs allegedly wore during the robbery.<ref name=1976tourbook>{{Cite book|title=Rick Wakeman: In Concert tour programme|date=1976|url=http://www.rwcc.com/programmes/1976RWInConcert.pdf}}</ref> In late 1975, Wakeman composed the [[Lisztomania (album)|soundtrack]] for ''[[Lisztomania (film)|Lisztomania]]'', a biography film about composer [[Franz Liszt]] written and directed by [[Ken Russell]]. Wakeman appears in the film as [[Thor]], the god of thunder.<ref name=1991tourbook/> A few years later, he recalled the album in a more negative light as "there was hardly anything of mine on it in the end", and criticised its mixing and production.<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 147.</ref>

In 1976, with the top rate of UK income tax at 83 per cent,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/harold-wilson|title=Harold Wilson|website=gov.uk|access-date=23 August 2020}}</ref> Wakeman began living in [[Switzerland]] as a [[tax exile]].<ref>{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HSoqSV16SpQC&q=rick+wakeman+tax+exile&pg=PT252 | title= Close to the Edge: The Story of Yes | author=Chris Welch | date= 11 November 2009 | isbn=978-1847721327 | publisher=Omnibus Press | access-date=23 August 2020}}</ref> He recorded his fourth solo album, ''[[No Earthly Connection]]'', with the English Rock Ensemble at [[Château d'Hérouville|Chateau Studios]] in [[Hérouville]], France from January to March 1976.

Following the ''No Earthly Connection'' tour, Wakeman fell into financial trouble. Though it was not "an all tax issue", Wakeman's expenses far exceeded the profits made from the tour which only met its minimal expectations,<ref name=wooding172>Wooding 1979, p. 172.</ref> leaving him to come up with £350,000 "in a matter of weeks".<ref>Wooding 1979, p. 171.</ref> He sold his Rolls-Royces, ended his Fragile car service, and disbanded the English Rock Ensemble.<ref name=wooding172/><ref>Wooding 1979, p. 173.</ref> Wakeman's situation improved after A&M agreed to pay Wakeman's royalties ahead of time. Soon after, Lane suggested that Wakeman talk with [[Bill Bruford]] and [[John Wetton]] who were thinking of forming a new band. After a private meeting, the three rehearsed for six weeks before the story was reported in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in October 1976, which effectively caused the group to end.<ref name="autogenerated1">Wooding 1979, p. 175.</ref> Wakeman took up work recording the soundtrack to ''[[White Rock (film)|White Rock]]'', a documentary film about the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] directed by [[Tony Maylam]]. The film premiered in February 1977 as a double bill with the [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] concert film, ''[[Genesis: In Concert]]''. The [[White Rock (album)|album]] was released in the same year. The track "After the Ball" was one that Wakeman forgot to write; he proceeded to play it as a completely improvised single take, rather than confessing to the producers.

Wakeman's fortunes changed in November 1976 when Lane invited him to meet Yes in Switzerland as they were writing ''[[Going for the One]]'' in [[Mountain Studios]], [[Montreux]]. Wakeman's replacement, Swiss musician [[Patrick Moraz]], left during the early stages in part due to the "enormous psychological pressures within the group."<ref>Hedges, p. 108.</ref> Upon hearing the band's new material of more accessible and concise songs, Wakeman agreed to play on the album as a session musician. Lane and Squire convinced him to rejoin as a full-time member; Wakeman noticed the new edition of ''Melody Maker'' with the headline "Wakeman rejoins Yes" appeared hours after he agreed. He asked Lane what would have happened if he declined, and said: "It's just one of those decisions a manager has to make."<ref>''YesYears'' documentary, 1991.</ref> Wakeman described the record as "the album Yes should have made instead of ''Topographic Oceans''."<ref name=guardian2014/> Released in July 1977, the album spent two weeks at No. 1 in the UK and spawned the No. 7 single, "Wonderous Stories". Wakeman considered its fifteen-minute track "[[Awaken (Yes song)|Awaken]]" as one of the band's best.

During the ''Going for the One'' tour, Wakeman released ''[[Rick Wakeman's Criminal Record]]'', a solo album loosely based on criminality with Squire on bass, [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] on drums, [[Frank Ricotti]] on percussion, and [[Bill Oddie]] on lead vocals on "The Breathalyser". The album went to No. 25 in the UK.

Wakeman recorded the next Yes album, ''[[Tormato]]'', in early 1978. He is reputed to have given the album its name by throwing a tomato at a showing of the art used for the album's cover.<ref name="interview_2002">{{cite web| last = Wright | first = Jeb | title = Rick Wakeman of Yes | publisher=Classic Rock Revisited |date = May 2002| url = http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviews02/Rick+Wakeman.htm | access-date =24 October 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040106024554/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviews02/Rick+Wakeman.htm |archive-date = 6 January 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Tiano | first = Mike | title = Conversation with Roger Dean [nfte #308] | publisher=Notes From the Edge| date = 3 September 2008 | url = http://www.nfte.org/interviews/RD308.html| access-date =24 October 2009}}</ref> In 1978 Wakeman, along with [[Mick Jagger]], [[Peter Frampton]], and [[Paul Simon]], invested in the formation of the [[Philadelphia Fury (1978–1980)|Philadelphia Fury]], an American soccer team that disbanded in 1980.

''[[Rhapsodies (album)|Rhapsodies]]'', released as a [[double album]] in 1979, was Wakeman's final studio album for A&M Records. It features [[Bruce Lynch]] on bass, [[Frank Gibson Jr.]] on drums, and [[Tony Visconti]] on acoustic guitar.

In March 1980, after several writing sessions for a new Yes album in Paris failed, Wakeman and Jon Anderson left the group.

===1980–1988: ''1984'', ''Silent Nights'', ''Country Airs'', and ''The Gospels''===
In 1980, Wakeman reformed the English Rock Ensemble and completed a European tour.<ref name=wakeman95-140/> He came close to forming a band with drummer [[Carl Palmer]], bassist [[John Wetton]], and guitarist [[Trevor Rabin]], but opted out "on a matter of principle" as the record company was prepared to sign them without hearing any of the group's music.

In June 1981, Wakeman released ''[[1984 (Rick Wakeman album)|1984]]'', a concept rock album based on [[George Orwell]]'s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|dystopian novel]], with a band including [[Steve Barnacle]] on bass, [[Gary Barnacle]] on saxophone, and [[Frank Ricotti]] on drums. The album features tracks with [[Chaka Khan]], [[Jon Anderson]], [[Kenny Lynch]], and [[Tim Rice]] - the album's lyricist - on lead vocals. ''1984'' reached number 24 in the UK. Plans to have the album adapted into a musical were cancelled after lawyers from Orwell's estate blocked its development.<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 143.</ref> During Wakeman's 1981 tour of Europe and South America, he first met [[Nina Carter]]. In the same year, Wakeman recorded the soundtrack to the slasher horror film ''[[The Burning (film)|The Burning]]'' in New York City.<ref name=1991tourbook/>

After the 1981 tour, Wakeman attended the annual [[Midem]] music festival where he secured the rights to a previously unreleased album that had he recorded in Switzerland in 1979. Initially titled ''Maybe '80'' and renamed ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Prophet]]'', it is a humorous spoof on the pop group [[The Buggles]] and was released in 1982 on Wakeman's own label, Moon Records.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Midem Meanderings|date=2 February 1983|journal=Variety|page=104|volume=310|issue=1|issn=0042-2738|id={{ProQuest|1438374961}}}}</ref><ref name=1991tourbook/><ref name=1985tourbook>{{cite book|url=http://www.rwcc.com/programmes/1985SilentNights.pdf|title=Rick Wakeman: Silent Nights Tour Book|date=1985|publisher=Concert Publishers|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref> A single from the album, "I'm So Straight I'm a Weirdo", was released in 1980.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title="I'm So Straight I'm a Weirdo"/"Do You Believe in Fairies?"|publisher=A&M Records|id=AMS 7510|year=1971}}</ref> In 1982, Wakeman hosted the [[Channel 4]] music show ''[[Gastank]]'' with [[Tony Ashton]] that aired in January and February 1983.<ref name=1985tourbook/> He then released a second album for Charisma, ''[[Cost of Living (Rick Wakeman album)|Cost of Living]]'', a mixture of instrumental and rock tracks with Rice on vocals, which "did nothing" to improve his finances.<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 148.</ref> Wakeman wrote about his situation by 1983, to the point where he was "managerless, penniless and homeless".<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 151.</ref> In February 1983, he and Carter moved to [[Camberley]], Surrey after the birth of their daughter Jemma.<ref name=1985tourbook/> Wakeman took up work by recording the soundtrack to the official [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] documentary film ''[[G'olé!]]'', which was released around the same time as ''Cost of Living'' which hampered potential album sales.<ref name=1985tourbook/> He wrote the soundtrack for the film ''[[She (1984 film)|She]]'' with assistance from [[Justin Hayward]] and [[Maggie Bell]],<ref name=1985tourbook/> and his second Russell feature, ''[[Crimes of Passion (1984 film)|Crimes of Passion]]'', with Bell on vocals, Fernandez on drums, and past Strawbs bandmate [[Chas Cronk]] on bass.

In 1984, Wakeman signed a recording deal with [[President Records]] and produced ''[[Silent Nights]]'', his first solo album for over two years, in two-and-a-half months at Herne Place Studios in [[Sunningdale]] with Fernandez, Cronk, and [[Rick Fenn]] on guitar.<ref name=1985tourbook/> The album was released in 1985 and its single, "Glory Boys", became a minor hit in the UK.<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 158.</ref> In March 1985, Wakeman finished work on his part of the soundtrack to the comedy film ''[[Playing for Keeps (1986 film)|Playing for Keeps]]'', and returned to England to begin rehearsals for his tour to promote ''Silent Nights'',<ref name=1985tourbook/> which visited the UK, North America, and Australia.<ref name=wakeman95-177>Wakeman 1995, p. 177.</ref> A live album recorded during the tour in London was released as ''[[Live at Hammersmith (Rick Wakeman album)|Live at Hammersmith]]''.

In a change in musical direction, Wakeman produced his first of a series of [[New-age music|new-age]] albums titled ''[[Country Airs]]'', a piano album released in mid-1986 that went to number one on the UK new age chart.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UiQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT74|journal=Billboard|title=Monthly British New Age Chart|page=63|date=23 August 1986|access-date=14 December 2016|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Wakeman followed this with a tour of the [[Far East]], and soundtrack work for ''[[Hero (1987 film)|Hero]]'', the film to the [[1986 World Cup]], and the BBC film ''The Day After the Fair''.<ref name=1987southbank/> His next album was ''[[The Family Album (Rick Wakeman album)|The Family Album]]'' in 1987, featuring tracks dedicated to each of his family members and pets.

===1988–1997: ABWH, third and fourth Yes runs, ''Phantom Power'', and ''The Piano Album''===
In March 1988, Wakeman and Carter sold their Camberley home and moved to the [[Isle of Man]] in a move to help improve their finances. To save money, a recording facility was built in a converted coach house next to his home that he named Bajonor Studios.<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 188.</ref> He then released two studio albums throughout the year, both recorded at Studio House in [[Wraysbury]]: ''A Suite of Gods'', based on [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] with Fernandez and Remedios, and ''Zodiaque'' with Fernandez featuring tracks dedicated to each of the [[Zodiac#The twelve signs|twelve signs of the zodiac]].

In late 1988, Wakeman received a call from Brian Lane who invited him to form [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]] with former Yes band members [[Jon Anderson]], [[Bill Bruford]] and [[Steve Howe]]. Anderson wished to make an album that reflected Yes's 1970s sound and wanted to record on the island of [[Montserrat]]. The album was released in June 1989 and sold 750,000 copies. The band's world tour ran from July 1989 to March 1990. During the tour, Wakeman released two more solo albums: ''Black Knights at the Court of Ferdinand IV'' with Italian musician Mario Fasciano and ''[[Sea Airs]]'', a sequel to ''Country Airs''.

In 1990, Wakeman released ''In the Beginning'', his second Christian album that was produced in aid of ASSIST, a Christian charity founded by music journalist and Wakeman's biographer, Dan Wooding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-05/entertainment/ca-256_1_rick-wakeman|title=Wakeman Album Aids Church Group|first=Mike|last=Boehm|date=5 August 1991|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=latimes1994/> The album contains a series of Biblical readings by Carter with Wakeman supplying the background music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-beginning-mw0000914199|title=In the Beginning|first=Stephen|last=Raiteri|website=AllMusic|access-date=1 January 2017}}</ref> Also in 1990, work on a second Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe began in France, but its development was interrupted when the group merged their tracks with an in-progress Yes album to create ''[[Union (Yes album)|Union]]''. Wakeman, along with the combined members of both bands then joined to form a Yes supergroup (made up of past and present members of Yes) for the subsequent tour in 1991–92. When the tour ended a year later, Wakeman left again.

In October 1992, Wakeman embarked on a world tour with Fernandez, guitarist and bassist [[Alan Thomson (musician)|Alan Thomson]], and his son [[Adam Wakeman]] on additional keyboards. The tour lasted through 1993, and was organised as Wakeman wished to tour with a second keyboardist to "free [him] up to do more things" on stage.<ref name=latimes1993>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-25/entertainment/ca-6929_1_keyboardist-rick-wakeman|title=Just Say Yes to Progressive Rock: Keyboardist Rick Wakeman, on a career-reaffirming tour that stops at the Coach House, pines for the old days|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=25 June 1993|first=Buddy|last=Seigal|access-date=1 January 2017}}</ref>

In 1993, Wakeman released ''Heritage Suite'', a solo piano album about the Isle of Man, and an album with Adam, ''Wakeman with Wakeman''. Later in 1993, Wakeman's financial situation worsened when he was served with a demand for close to £70,000 from the [[Inland Revenue]], for interest charges and unpaid penalties related to tax he had paid for the preceding six years. He paid it, as he wrote, "with help from Brian Lane's office and Yes's accountants, in my signing away all publishing income from everything I had ever written ... Twenty-two years' work had vanished in the three seconds it had taken to sign my name."<ref>Wakeman 1995, p. 194.</ref>

In 1994, Wakeman performed a series of solo piano concerts in aid for ASSIST.<ref name=latimes1994>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-18/entertainment/ca-24331_1_concert-march|title=Wakeman Plans Church Concert|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=18 February 1994|first=Mike|last=Boehm|access-date=1 January 2017}}</ref> Two shows recorded in [[Virginia]] and the Calvary Chapel in [[Costa Mesa, California]], attended by almost 8,000 people, was released as ''The Piano Album'' in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/piano-album-mw0000379464|title=The Piano Album|first=Mike|last=DeGagne|website=AllMusic|access-date=1 January 2017}}</ref>

In 1995, he wrote music for the [[Cirque Surreal]]. The same year he scored the soundtrack to ''[[Bullet to Beijing]]'', a [[made-for-television]] film starring [[Michael Caine]] and [[Jason Connery]], and also scored the sequel, ''[[Midnight in Saint Petersburg]]'', the following year.<ref name=sos1995>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/nov95/rickwakeman.html |title=Rick Wakeman: Cirque Surreal |publisher=Soundonsound.com |access-date=2015-09-05}}</ref> It was also during this year that he played keyboards on [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s album ''[[Ozzmosis]]'' and performed on the [[Retirement Sucks Tour]].

In late 1995, Wakeman returned to Yes for a fourth time. Yes then played three nights at the [[Fremont Theater]] in [[San Luis Obispo, California]] from 3–6 March 1996. He then recorded the ''[[Keys to Ascension]]'' (1996) and ''[[Keys to Ascension 2]]'' (1997) albums with Yes. In March 1997, Wakeman staged the North American premiere of ''The New Gospels'' for five dates after it was reworked and extended into a two-hour [[oratorio]] with a 30-piece choir, in 1994. The concerts were free with donations to ASSIST.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-28/entertainment/ca-43043_1_rick-wakeman|title=Religious Experience|date=28 March 1997|first=Mike|last=Boehm|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> Wakeman left Yes in May 1997 before he could tour with them, due to scheduling conflicts and lack of coordination between the artists' management.

===1997–2008: ''Return to the Centre of the Earth'', ''Out There'', and fifth Yes run===
In October 1997, Wakeman received a Golden Badge Award from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]] (BASCA), given for outstanding contributions to the British music and entertainment industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldbadgeawards.com/archive/1990-1999/gold-badge-awards-1997/|title=Gold Badge Awards – Archive – 1990–1999 – 1997|publisher=Gold Badge Awards|access-date=24 December 2016}}</ref> In 1998, he started work on ''[[Return to the Centre of the Earth]]'', a sequel album to commemorate the 25th anniversary of ''Journey to the Centre of the Earth''. The idea first came to Wakeman in 1991 during a tour of Italy, which led to discussions about the project with [[Atlantic Records]] that year about a re-recording of the original album with new equipment and arrangements, but the idea was rejected. It was revived in 1996 when Wakeman received offers from three record companies willing to fund and release a new "epic" album.<ref name=1999interview>{{cite web|url=http://yesmuseum.org/WakeView1.html|title=Rick Wakeman – Interview – Madrid, 21th [sic] April 1999|publisher=YesMuseum.org|date=21 April 1999|access-date=14 December 2016}}</ref> After a deal with [[EMI Classics]] was made, a story based on three unnamed travellers and their attempt to follow the original route was finalised, and recording began in 1998 with a band, the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], the [[English Chamber Choir]], [[Patrick Stewart]] as the narrator, and guest performances from [[Trevor Rabin]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Bonnie Tyler]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Return to the Centre of the Earth|publisher=EMI Classics|id=724355676320|year=1999}}</ref> Recording was temporarily disrupted because of Wakeman's health.<ref name=mirrorhealth/><ref>Welch 2008, p. 279.</ref><ref name="welch-284">Welch 2008, p. 284.</ref> In December 1998, Wakeman was featured on an episode of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]''.<ref name=welch-278>Welch 2008, p. 278.</ref>

In February 2000, Wakeman began his An Evening with Rick Wakeman tour of the UK, playing keyboards and piano on tracks spanning his entire career. In September that year, he accepted an invitation to perform a series of concerts in South America with the English Rock Ensemble following a renewed interest in progressive rock there.<ref name="welch-284"/> He recruited Fernandez, [[Damian Wilson]] on vocals, [[Adam Wakeman]] on keyboards, Ant Glynne on guitar, and Lee Pomeroy on bass.

Following months of speculation, Yes management announced Wakeman's return to the band for a fifth time, on 16 April 2002.<ref name="welch-284"/> Wakeman remembered it took "eight months to get the paper work together" to make his return happen.<ref name=welch-285/> Upon Wakeman's return, the group entered rehearsals for their [[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#Full Circle Tour|Full Circle Tour]] that ran from July 2002 to October 2003. This was followed by their [[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#35th Anniversary Tour|35th Anniversary Tour]], running from April to September 2004. Wakeman described the band's playing during his return: "It was far and away the best the band had ever been ... there was no staleness, there was a lot of freshness."<ref name=gloucester2015>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gloucestershireecho.co.uk/marriages-rock-star-past-grumpy-old-man-Rick/story-26253354-detail/story.html|title=Four marriages, a rock star past an being a grumpy old man – Rick Wakeman opens up to Weekend|date=30 March 2015|first=Corrie|last=Bond-French|work=Gloucestershire Echo|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814024847/http://www.gloucestershireecho.co.uk/marriages-rock-star-past-grumpy-old-man-Rick/story-26253354-detail/story.html|archive-date=14 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2005, [[Fidel Castro]] invited Wakeman to perform in [[Cuba]] with his band.

In 2008, Wakeman toured with Rick Wakeman's Grumpy Old Picture Show, featuring an evening of music and stories from his career. In May 2009, Wakeman performed ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII'' in its entirety for the first time at [[Hampton Court Palace]] for two nights. In 2010, Wakeman was awarded the Spirit of Prog Award at the annual [[Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i380e27368bb3e68cd49c42cece12498c | title= AC/DC, Stones, Slash Win At Classic Rock Awards | first= Emma | last=Johnston |work=Billboard | date= 11 November 2010 |access-date=17 November 2010}}</ref> In 2013, Wakeman played on ''[[The Theory of Everything (Ayreon album)|The Theory of Everything]]'' by [[Ayreon]].<ref>{{YouTube|id=uSqMrzZxdz0&list=TLLG7nOWx0a4E|title=Rick Wakeman to guest on Ayreon Theory of Everything}} Official Arjen Lucassen channel (2013)</ref> The following year, he completed a 14-date UK tour to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of ''Journey to the Centre of the Earth''.

In January 2016, [[Trevor Rabin]] announced he planned to perform with Wakeman and [[Jon Anderson]] as [[Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman|Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman]] (ARW), later in the year.

Although Wakeman is a noted player of the [[grand piano]], [[electric piano]], [[pipe organ]], [[Hammond organ]], [[Minimoog]] and many later models of synthesiser, he is well known as a proponent (for a time) of the [[Mellotron]] – an analogue [[electronic musical instrument]] that uses a bank of pre-recorded magnetic tape strips, each of which is activated by a separate key on its keyboard and lasts approximately 8 seconds. Wakeman featured playing this instrument, to varying degrees, on the David Bowie track "Space Oddity", the Yes albums ''Fragile'', ''Close to the Edge'' and ''Tales From Topographic Oceans'', as well as the solo albums ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII'' and ''White Rock''. An [[urban legend]] claims that Wakeman got so frustrated with one Mellotron that he poured petrol on it and set fire to it, but this was debunked in a 2010 interview. Wakeman did however confirm the urban legend in a 2016 interview.<ref name=holmes>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-discovery.com/Interviews/rickwakeman_interview_2010_pt3.htm|title=Interview with Rick Wakeman|first=Mark|last=Holmes|publisher=Metal Discovery|date=28 July 2010|access-date=8 November 2013}}</ref> He subsequently worked with David Biro to develop the [[Birotron]], which used the then popular [[8-track tape|8-track]] cassette format rather than tape strips. Because of the advent of digital keyboards at that time, and expensive components used in the instruments' manufacture, the Birotron was never a commercial or technical success. Only 35 Birotrons were produced.<ref name="The Birotron">{{cite web|url=http://www.8trackheaven.com/birotron.html|title=The Birotron<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=31 July 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607174731/http://www.8trackheaven.com/birotron.html|archive-date=7 June 2007}}</ref> These days, he can be found with more modern instruments such as the Korg Kronos, Yamaha Montage, and the [[Memotron]], a new digital version of the original Mellotron.

In 2011 [[MusicRadar]] included Wakeman among "The 27 greatest keyboard players of all time".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/the-27-greatest-keyboard-players-of-all-time-484228 |title=The 27 greatest keyboard players of all time |first=Scot |last=Solida |publisher=[[MusicRadar]] |date=27 July 2011 |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref> In 2019 readers of ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'' voted him the second greatest progressive rock keyboard player, with the magazine stating, "Wakeman's time with Yes helped define prog as we know it, being filled with timeless brilliance [...] The man's style is fluent, and underlines a love of many genres, all cohesively brought into focus."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-top-ten-keyboard-players-in-prog |title=The top ten keyboard players in prog |first=Jerry |last=Ewing |website=loudersound.com |date=21 July 2019 |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref> Keyboardists who have cited Wakeman as an influence included [[Dave Greenfield]] of [[the Stranglers]]<ref name="JENKINS">{{cite book |last1=Jenkins |first1=Mark |title=Analog Synthesizers: Understanding, Performing, Buying--From the Legacy of Moog to Software Synthesis |date=October 2009 |publisher=CRC Press |page=150 |isbn=9781136122781 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iI77AwAAQBAJ&q=greenfield+korg+vc-10&pg=PA150}}</ref> and [[Mark Kelly (keyboardist)|Mark Kelly]] of [[Marillion]], who cited Wakeman as his primary influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musicplayers.com/2007/04/marillions-mark-kelly-keyboards-eden/|title=Marillion's Mark Kelly: Keyboards in Eden|website=musicplayers.com|first=Scott|last=Kahn|date=6 April 2007|access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref> [[Keith Emerson]] was also a close friend of Wakeman's and expressed admiration for his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/rick-wakeman-david-bowie-piano-man-yes-animal-rescue-interview-564924|title=Rick Wakeman's Piano Journey Into Yes, Bowie|website=Newsweek|first=Jeff|last=Perlah|date=8 March 2017|access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref>
