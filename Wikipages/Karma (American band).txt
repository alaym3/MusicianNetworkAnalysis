'''Karma''' was an American soul/funk/jazz band, which recorded two albums for the [[A&M Records]] imprint [[Horizon Records]] in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/|title=AllMusic &#124; Record Reviews, Streaming Songs, Genres & Bands|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref>  Its members included [[Ernie Watts]], trombonist [[George Bohanon]], trumpeter [[Oscar Brashear]], keyboardist [[Reggie Andrews]], bassist Curtis Robertson Jr and drummer [[Joe Blocker]].

After recording two albums, the group disbanded in 1978. Group members Reggie Andrews and George Bohanon became record producers - the former becoming successful in overseeing albums by [[Patrice Rushen]] and [[The Dazz Band]]. Ernie Watts would later tour with [[The Rolling Stones]], while Vander "Stars" Lockett would appear on [[Donald Fagen]]'s 1982 solo debut, ''[[The Nightfly]]''.
