==History==

===Formation, early years and ''Vancouver'' (2004–2007)===
La Dispute was formed in Grand Rapids, Michigan in late 2004 by cousins Jordan Dreyer and Brad Vander Lugt, Kevin Whittemore, Derek Sterenberg and Adam Kool; Dreyer was never a singer and did not write any music prior to forming the band but was a writer, primarily writing [[poetry]] and [[Short story|short fiction]].<ref name="one21music intro">{{cite web|url=http://www.one21music.com/la-dispute/|title=La Dispute, Post-Hardcore, Talk Music Christian Music Artist|publisher=one21music|access-date=June 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602153343/http://www.one21music.com/la-dispute/ |archive-date=June 2, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Syracuse-interview 2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.syracusenewtimes.com/newyork/article-5793-la-dispute.html |title=La Dispute |author=Bill DeLapp |work=[[Syracuse New Times]] |publisher=All Times Publishing |date=April 25, 2012 |access-date=November 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130630095300/http://www.syracusenewtimes.com/newyork/article-5793-la-dispute.html |archive-date=June 30, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="blunt-into the wild"/> During this time the band mainly played [[House concert|house shows]] or at the Division Avenue Arts Collective (a volunteer-run [[DIY]] music venue, community center, and art gallery) in Downtown Grand Rapids. Chad Sterenberg replaced his older brother Derek in 2006 the day after the release of their debut EP, ''[[Vancouver (EP)|Vancouver]]'' (released April 14, 2006), which was the only release the band produced while on the Friction Records roster.<ref name="Syracuse-interview 2013"/> [[Indiana]] based friend of the band Adam Vass later joined in 2007. It wasn't until the loss of Derek Sterenberg and Adam Kool that they took the project seriously.<ref name="Syracuse-interview 2013"/><ref name="fromthegarage 2010 interview"/>

La Dispute signed to Southern California-based record label [[No Sleep Records]] in early 2008. Jordan Dreyer describes this move to the label as sharing a similar perspective on music, stating: "The primary attraction with No Sleep for us was that it was obvious through talking to Chris [Hansen] that his intentions with the label were in line with ours as a band."<ref name="Recoil mag 1"/> To fill in the gap between their debut release ''Vancouver'' and their upcoming album the band released an exclusive [[vinyl record]], ''[[Untitled 7"]]'', consisting of two tracks which were extra songs from the writing sessions of their debut album. Also in May, the EP ''[[Here, Hear.]]'' was released, which would soon follow sequels, with Dreyer stating: "''Here Hear'' we did as a challenge to ourselves creatively as a way to expand our horizons and also broaden the context for anyone else who is interested in checking who we are as a band".<ref name="Syracuse-interview 2013"/><ref name="UTGR-7/Interview">{{cite web|url=http://underthegunreview.net/2008/06/10/untitled-7-la-dispute-and-interview/ |title=Untitled 7" – La Dispute in 2008 on Forest Life Records[AND INTERVIEW!!!!!&#93; | author = James Shotwell  | work = Under the Gun Review | publisher = ([[Buzzmedia]]) | date = June 10, 2008 | access-date = September 22, 2012}}</ref> On November 11, 2008, La Dispute released their debut album ''[[Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair]]'' through No Sleep Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://underthegunreview.net/2008/10/03/la-dispute-somewhere-at-the-bottom-of-the-river-between-vega-and-altair/ |title=La Dispute – Somewhere At The Bottom Of The River Between Vega and Altair |publisher=Underthegunreview.net |date=October 3, 2008 |access-date=April 5, 2010}}</ref> La Dispute recorded the album at StudiOtte in Grand Rapids with Joel and Troy Otte.<ref name="Recoil mag 1"/> The album's lyrical themes base around an Asian folk tale regarding the plight of a prince and a princess who are separated after marriage by a river they are not allowed to cross.

The band has always used a band logo similar to what they do now.

===Musical style===
Jordan Dreyer, the band's singer, has commented on the use of tags to describe the band's style, saying: "In general, I think boxing art into categories only serves as a way to exclude people from exploring different variations of the same thing.
