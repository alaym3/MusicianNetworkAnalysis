The following year Coggins-Wynn left the group and Xscape became a quartet. They were discovered by [[Jermaine Dupri]] who signed the group to his [[So So Def Recordings|So So Def]] label. The group released their debut album ''[[Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha]]'' in 1993, which spawned two of their biggest hits "[[Just Kickin' It]]" and "[[Understanding (song)|Understanding]]". The album was certified Platinum on February 1, 1994.

===''Traces of My Lipstick'' and hiatus (1998–2002)===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
In early 1998, Xscape was featured on the [[Keith Sweat]] produced single, a cover of Atlantic Starr's "Am I Dreamin'", by R&B newcomer group [[Ol' Skool]]. The single was a success in [[North America]], peaking at #31 on the "Hot 100", and was later featured on Xscape's third album ''[[Traces of My Lipstick]]''.

Although their unofficial third single was released, "Softest Place on Earth" reached #28 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

After ''Traces of My Lipstick'', LaTocha Scott initially left the group to pursue a solo career. She later joined her sister Tameka Scott and Tameka Cottle to reform the group. The three members requested Burruss also rejoin.  When Burruss declined, she was asked to sign a "leaving member notice", signing over her rights to the Xscape name. She signed and the remaining three original members went on to make appearances on the ''[[Big Momma's House]]'' and ''[[Hardball (film)|Hardball]]'' soundtracks, before going on another hiatus until 2005.

=== Failed comeback (2005–2006) ===
After a five-year hiatus, sisters [[LaTocha Scott]] and [[Tamika Scott]] reunited with [[Tameka Cottle|Tameka "Tiny" Cottle]] and new member Kiesha Miles to record a fourth album, ''Unchained''. The new single, "What's Up", was released on a [[mixtape]] and later got some airplay in hometown [[Atlanta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.s2smagazine.com/content/content.asp?issueid=200503&listid=01|title=Xscape breaks the chains by Jamie Foster Brown with the assistance of Ericka Boston and Calvin Terrell|publisher=s2smagazine.com}}</ref> However, the album was not released due to lack of promotion from the record label.

=== Reunion (2017–present) ===
On June 25, 2017 the original four group members had their first performance together in over 18 years at the 2017 BET Awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xscape performs hit medleys|url=https://www.bet.com/video/betawards/2017/performances/xscape-medley-understanding-who-can-i-run-to-just-kickin-it.html|website=BET}}</ref> They would also perform at the Essence Festival and at Chene Park in Detroit.

In September 2017, the group announced a reunion tour featuring 29 cities from late November through early January 2018, and were to be joined by Monica and Tamar Braxton.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xscape Tour|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2017/09/19/xscape-the-great-xscape-tour-dates/|website=Great Xscape Tour}}</ref> On September 22 of the same year, the group made their first appearance together on daytime television on [[The Wendy Williams Show]], performing "My Little Secret" and "Understanding".<ref>{{cite web|title=Xscape Reunites|url=http://www.wendyshow.com/2017/09/22/xscape-reunites/|website=Wendy Williams}}</ref> On November 12, Kandi publicly announced that she would not be making new music with Xscape at this time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xscape's New Music Without Kandi|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYLnLttHnCc|website=YouTube}}</ref> Two new singles titled "Wifed Up" and "Dream Killa" were released on December 1, neither single featuring Burruss.

In late 2017, Kandi Burruss indicated in numerous interviews her lack of interest in recording new music as Xscape, stating that she was pursuing Broadway roles instead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/xscape-is-recording-new-music-without-kandi-burruss|title=Xscape Is Recording New Music, But Kandi Burruss Isn't Participating|date=November 13, 2017|work=Bravo TV Official Site|access-date=September 2, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Because of this, Tiny, LaTocha and Tamika formed the subunit XSCAP3, which included three of the five original Xscape members, with the notable exception of Burruss. As a trio, XSCAP3 signed with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in January 2018 for representation in all areas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8098866/xscap3-formerly-xscape-signs-with-caa|title=XSCAP3, Formerly Xscape, Signs With CAA|work=Billboard|access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref> The trio also formally created a recording label, XSCAP3 Entertainment. In late 2017 to early 2018, the members of XSCAP3 recorded six original songs that were later included in their subunit's debut EP. 

On March 2, 2018 "XSCAP3" released their EP titled "[[Here for It]]" on all digital outlets.

On May 8th 2021, [[Verzuz]] presented a pre-Mother's day battle featuring both Xscape and another popular 1990s female R&B group, [[SWV]]. Both DJs, AONE and [[Spinderella]], were responsible for music play for both groups.
