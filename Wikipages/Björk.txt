=== 1965–1984: Early life and career beginnings ===
Björk was born on 21 November 1965 in [[Reykjavík]],<ref name=saga /> where she grew up. Her mother was activist Hildur Rúna Hauksdóttir (7 October 1946 – 25 October 2018<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ösp |first1=Auður |title=Hildur Rúna er látin |url=https://www.dv.is/frettir/2018/11/02/hildur-runa-er-latin/ |website=[[DV (newspaper)|DV]] |access-date=26 December 2020 |language=Icelandic |date=2 November 2018}}</ref>), who protested against the development of Iceland's [[Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant]].<ref>{{cite news| title= Selective justice at Kárahnúkar says Björk's father| date= 8 March 2005| url = http://icelandreview.com/news/2005/08/03/selective-justice-karahnukar-says-bjorks-father| work= Iceland Review| access-date= 26 January 2010}}</ref> Her father is [[Guðmundur Gunnarsson]], a union leader and electrician.

The recording was nationally broadcast and, after hearing it, a representative of the [[Fálkinn]] record label offered Björk a recording contract. Her début, ''[[Björk (album)|Björk]]'', was recorded when she was 11 years old and was released in Iceland in December 1977.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/down_the_rabbit_hole_with_bjoerks_first_album_recorded_at_the_age|title=Down the rabbit hole with Björk's first album, recorded at the age of eleven|date=27 August 2013|work=DangerousMinds|access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref>

During her teens, after the diffusion of [[punk rock]] music in Iceland, Björk formed the [[All-female band#1970s|all-girl punk band]] Spit and Snot. In 1980, she formed a [[jazz fusion#1970s|jazz fusion]] group, Exodus, collaborated in another group, JAM80, and graduated from music school.<ref name="saga" /> In 1982, she and bassist Jakob Magnússon formed another group, [[Tappi Tíkarrass]] ("Cork the Bitch's Ass" in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), and released [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Bitið fast í vitið]]'' ("Bite Hard Into Hell" in Icelandic), in August 1982. Their album ''[[Miranda (album)|Miranda]]'' was released in December 1983. The group was featured in the documentary ''[[Rokk í Reykjavík]]'', with Björk being featured on the cover of the [[VHS]] release.<ref name=saga /><ref>{{cite web|title=Rokk í Reykjavík!|url=http://www.grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/Rokk-i-Reykjavik|work=The Reykjavík Grapevine|access-date=5 March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305222821/http://www.grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/Rokk-i-Reykjavik|archive-date=5 March 2014}}</ref> Around this time, Björk met guitarist Þór Eldon and [[surrealism|surrealist]] group Medusa, which also included poet [[Sjón]], with whom she started a lifelong collaboration and formed a group, Rokka Rokka Drum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Björk Introduces Sjón|url=http://www.fsgworkinprogress.com/2013/08/bjork-introduces-sjon/|work=Work in Progress|date=16 August 2013|publisher=Work in Progress|access-date=5 March 2014}}</ref> Björk appeared as a featured artist on "Afi", a track from the Björgvin Gíslason 1983 record ''Örugglega''.<ref name="secrethistory" />

Due to the imminent discontinuance of radio show ''Áfangar'', two radio personalities, Ásmundur Jónsson and Guðni Rúnar, requested musicians to play on a last [[live radio]] show. Björk joined with Einar Melax (from the group Fan Houtens Kókó), [[Einar Örn Benediktsson]] (from Purrkur Pillnikk), [[Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson]] and [[Sigtryggur Baldursson]] (from Þeyr), and Birgir Mogensen (from Spilafífl) to perform in the concert.<ref name=kuklgunni>{{cite web|title=The Rise And Fall Of Kukl|url=http://www.grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/The-Rise-And-Fall-Of-Kukl|work=The Reykjavík Grapevine|access-date=5 March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305222107/http://www.grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/The-Rise-And-Fall-Of-Kukl|archive-date=5 March 2014}}</ref> The group developed a [[gothic rock]] sound. During this experience, Björk began to develop her vocalisation – punctuated by howls and shrieks.<ref name=saga />{{Better source needed|date=May 2018}} The project performed as Gott kvöld during the concert. When they later decided to keep playing together as a group, they used the name {{lang|is|[[Kukl (band)|Kukl]]}} ("[[Witchcraft|Sorcery]]" in Icelandic).<ref name="kuklgunni" /> Björk's acquaintance gave the group their studio to record in and released their first single in 1983.<ref name="kuklgunni" /> Their first big performance at a festival in Iceland was headlined by English [[anarchism|anarchist]] punk band [[Crass]], whose record label, [[Crass Records]] offered the band a record deal. ''[[The Eye (KUKL album)|The Eye]]'' was released in 1984, followed by a two-month tour in Europe, which also included a performance at [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark.

Kukl's second album, ''[[Holidays in Europe (The Naughty Nought)]]'', came out in 1986. The band split up due to personal conflict, with Björk keeping a collaboration with Guðlaugur, which was named [[the Elgar Sisters]]. Some of the songs they recorded ended up as B-sides to Björk solo singles.<ref name=saga /><ref name=part25>{{cite web |title=Dr. Gunni's History of Icelandic Rock Part 25 |url=http://www.grapevine.is/Music/ReadArticle/Dr-Gunnis-History-of-Icelandic-Rock-Part-25 |work=The Reykjavik Grapevine |access-date=5 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305222257/http://www.grapevine.is/Music/ReadArticle/Dr-Gunnis-History-of-Icelandic-Rock-Part-25 |archive-date=5 March 2014}}</ref>

Björk had her first acting role on ''[[The Juniper Tree (film)|The Juniper Tree]]'' (filmed in 1986, released in 1990), a tale of [[witchcraft]] based on the [[Brothers Grimm]] story, directed by [[Nietzchka Keene]]. Björk played the role of Margit, a girl whose mother has been killed for practising witchcraft.<ref name=saga /> That summer, former band member Einar Örn and Eldon formed the arts collective ''[[Bad Taste (record label)|Smekkleysa]]'' ("Bad Taste" in Icelandic), created with the intention of being both a record label and book publishing company.<ref name=saga /><ref name="part25" /> Various friends, namely Melax and Sigtryggur from Kukl, along with [[Bragi Ólafsson]] and Friðrik Erlingson from Purrkur Pillnikk, joined the group and a band coalesced in the collective solely to make money.<ref name="part25" /> They were initially called Þukl, but they were advertised as Kukl (the name of the previous band). At a later concert supporting Icelandic band Stuðmenn, they referred to themselves as ''Sykurmolarnir'' ("Sugarcubes" in Icelandic). Their first double A-side single "Einn mol'á mann", which contained the songs "[[Birthday (The Sugarcubes song)|Ammæli]]" ("Birthday") and "Köttur" ("Cat"), was released on 21 November 1986, Björk's 21st birthday.<ref name="part25" /> At the end of that year, the band was signed by [[One Little Indian]].<ref name="part25" /> Their first English single, "Birthday", was released in the United Kingdom on 17 August 1987; a week later, it was declared single of the week by ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name="part25" /> The Sugarcubes also signed a distribution deal with [[Elektra Records]] in the United States and recorded their first album, ''[[Life's Too Good]]'', which was released in 1988.<ref name=part27>{{cite web |title=Dr. Gunni's History of Icelandic Rock / Part 27 |url=http://www.grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/the-sugarcubes |work=The Reykjavik Grapevine |access-date=5 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305222351/http://www.grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/the-sugarcubes |archive-date=5 March 2014}}</ref> After the release of the album, Eldon and Björk divorced soon after the birth of their child despite being in the same group.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=The Sugarcubes {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-sugarcubes-mn0000919525/biography|access-date=15 May 2018|website=AllMusic}}</ref> The album went on to sell more than one million copies worldwide.<ref name="part27" /> Björk contributed as a background vocalist on 1987 album ''[[Loftmynd]]'' by [[Megas]], for whom she provided background vocals also on his subsequent album ''[[Höfuðlausnir]]'' (1988) and ''[[Hættuleg hljómsveit & glæpakvendið Stella]]'' (1990).<ref name="secrethistory" />

In the last quarter of 1988, the Sugarcubes toured North America to positive reception.<ref name="part27" /> On 15 October, the band appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Björk alone contributed a rendition of the [[Christmas]] song "Jólakötturinn" ("The Christmas Cat") on the compilation ''Hvít Er Borg Og Bær''.<ref name="secrethistory" /> The band went on hiatus following the lack of reception of ''[[Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week!]]'' (1989) and a lengthy international tour.<ref name=":0" /> During this time, Björk started working on her solo projects. In 1990 she provided background vocals on ''Gums'' by Bless.<ref name="secrethistory" /> In the same year, she recorded ''[[Gling-Gló]]'', a collection of popular [[jazz]] and original work, with the jazz group [[Tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar]], which {{as of|2011|lc=y}} was still her best-selling album in her home country.<ref name=saga /><ref name="part27" /> Björk also contributed vocals to [[808 State]]'s album ''[[ex:el]]'', with whom she cultivated her interest in [[house music]]. She contributed vocals on the songs "Qmart" and on "Ooops", which was released as a single in the UK in 1991.<ref name="secrethistory" /> She also contributed vocals to the song "Falling", on the album ''[[Island (HÖH and Current 93 album)|Island]]'' by [[Current 93]] and [[Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson]].<ref name="secrethistory" /> In the same year she met [[harpist]] [[Corky Hale]], with whom she had a recording session that ended up as a track on her future album ''[[Debut (Björk album)|Debut]]''.<ref name=saga />

At this point, Björk had decided to leave the band to pursue her solo career, but their contract included the making of one last album, ''[[Stick Around for Joy]]'' (1992), with a subsequent promotional tour, which she agreed to do.<ref name="part27" /> Björk was featured on two tracks of the soundtrack for the 1992 film ''[[Remote Control (1992 film)|Remote Control]]'' (known as ''Sódóma Reykjavík'' in Iceland).<ref name="secrethistory" /> The Sugarcubes split up after they played one last show in Reykjavík.<ref name="part27" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' has called them "the biggest rock band to emerge from Iceland".<ref>{{cite web |title=Bjork – Biography |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bjork/biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707111540/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bjork/biography |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 July 2011 |work=Rolling Stone |publisher=Jann S.

=== 1993–1996: ''Debut'' and ''Post'' ===

Björk moved to [[London]] to pursue a solo career; she began working with producer [[Nellee Hooper]] (who had produced [[Massive Attack]], among others). Their partnership produced Björk's first international solo hit, "[[Human Behaviour]]", a clattering dance track based on a guitar rhythm sampled from [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]]. In most countries, the song was not widely played on radio, but its music video gained strong airtime on MTV. It was directed by [[Michel Gondry]], who became a frequent collaborator for Björk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michel Gondry |url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/342088 |publisher=Filmbug |access-date=15 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520191226/http://filmbug.com/db/342088 |archive-date=20 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Her first adult solo album, ''[[Debut (Björk album)|Debut]]'', was released in June 1993 to positive reviews; it was named album of the year by ''[[NME]]'' and eventually went [[platinum album|platinum]] in the United States.<ref name="RIAA" /> ''Debut'' was the leap Björk made from being in numerous bands during her teens and early twenties to her solo career. She named the album ''Debut'' to signify a start of something new. ''Debut'' had a mix of songs Björk had been writing since she was a teenager, as well as more recent lyrical collaborations with Hooper. The [[Dance music|dance]]-oriented album varied in instrumentation. One single from the album, "[[Venus as a Boy]]", featured a [[Bollywood]]-influenced string arrangement. Björk covered the jazz standard "[[Like Someone in Love]]" to the accompaniment of a harp, and the final track, "The Anchor Song", was sung with only a saxophone ensemble for accompaniment.

At the [[1994 Brit Awards]], Björk won the awards for [[Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist|Best International Female]] and [[Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act|Best International Newcomer]].<ref>[http://www.everyhit.com/awardbrit.html The Brit Awards]. everyHit.com. Retrieved 28 February 2011.</ref> The success of ''Debut'' enabled her to collaborate with British and other artists on one-off tracks. She worked with [[David Arnold]] on "[[Play Dead (song)|Play Dead]]", the theme to the 1993 film ''[[The Young Americans (film)|The Young Americans]]'' (which appeared as a bonus track on a re-release of ''Debut''), collaborated on two songs for Tricky's ''[[Nearly God]]'' project, appeared on the track "Lilith" for the album ''[[Not for Threes]]'' by [[Plaid (band)|Plaid]], and co-wrote the song "[[Bedtime Story (Madonna song)|Bedtime Story]]" for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1994 album ''[[Bedtime Stories (Madonna album)|Bedtime Stories]]''. Björk also had an uncredited role as a runway model in the 1994 film ''[[Prêt-à-Porter (film)|Prêt-à-Porter]]''.

''[[Post (Björk album)|Post]]'' was Björk's second solo studio album. Released in June 1995, the album was produced in conjunction with [[Nellee Hooper]], [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], [[Graham Massey]] of [[808 State]], and electronica producer [[Howie B]]. Building on the success of ''Debut'', Björk continued to pursue different sounds, taking particular interest in dance and [[techno]]. Production by Tricky and Howie B also provided trip hop/electronica-like sounds on tracks like "[[Possibly Maybe]]" and "Enjoy". It was these producers' influence along with older friend Graham Massey that inspired Björk to create material like the storming [[industrial music|industrial]] beats of "[[Army of Me (Björk song)|Army of Me]]". The album was ranked number 7 in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'''s "Top 90 Albums of the '90s" list and number 75 in its "100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/list/unj/spin_magazines_top_90_albums_of_the_90s |title=SPIN Magazine's Top 90 albums of the 90's |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |access-date=23 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spin.com/spin25/125-best-albums-past-25-years#page=6 |title=125 Best Albums of the Past 25 Years |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=30 November 2010 |access-date=23 December 2011}}</ref> ''Post'' and ''[[Homogenic]]'' were placed back to back on [[Pitchfork Media]]'s "Top Albums of the '90s" list at numbers 21 and 20, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5923-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/8/ |title=Staff Lists: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=17 November 2003 |access-date=23 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5923-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/9/ |title=Staff Lists: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=17 November 2003 |access-date=23 December 2011}}</ref> In 2003, the album was ranked number 373 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/post-bj-246-rk-19691231 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909003500/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/post-bj-246-rk-19691231 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 September 2012 |title=500 Greatest Albums: Post – Bjork |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=23 December 2011}}</ref> During this period, the press exalted Björk's eccentricity by creating a "[[pixie]]" persona around her,<ref name="PytlikX">{{harvnb|Pytlik|2003|p=x}}</ref> a descriptor she later confronted with her following albums.<ref name="NME97">{{cite magazine|last=Kessler|first=Ted|date=20 September 1997|title=Björk: Homogenic|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101000356reviews.html|url-status=dead|magazine=NME|page=54|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817222509/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101000356reviews.html|archive-date=17 August 2000|access-date=27 October 2015}}</ref>

=== 1997–2000: ''Homogenic'' and ''Dancer in the Dark'' ===
[[File:Björk 1997.jpg|left|thumb|Björk performing during the [[Homogenic Tour]] in 1997]]
Björk left London for Spain, where she recorded the album ''[[Homogenic]]'',<ref name="theGuardianJuly2001">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/jul/22/features.magazine27|title='I used to think I'd live forever...'|last=Ellen|first=Barbara|date=22 July 2001|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref> released in 1997. Björk worked with producers [[Mark Bell (British musician)|Mark Bell]] of [[LFO (British band)|LFO]] and [[Howie B]], as well as [[Eumir Deodato]]; numerous remixes followed. ''Homogenic'' is regarded as one of Björk's most experimental and extroverted works, with enormous beats that reflect the landscape of Iceland, most notably in the song "[[Jóga]]", which fuses lush strings with rocky electronic crunches. The album was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the US in 2001.<ref name="RIAA" /> The album was backed by string of [[music video]]s, several of which received airplay on [[MTV]]. The video for "[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]" was directed by frequent collaborator [[Michel Gondry]], while "[[All Is Full of Love]]" was directed by [[Chris Cunningham]]. The single "All is Full of Love" was also the first [[DVD]] single to ever be released in the US, which paved the way for other artists to include DVD video and other [[multimedia]] features with their singles. Björk began to write more personally, saying "I realised that I'd come to the end of the extrovert thing. I had to go home and search for myself again."<ref name="theGuardianJuly2001" />

In 1999, Björk was asked to write and produce the musical score for the film ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'', a musical drama about an immigrant named Selma who is struggling to pay for an operation to prevent her son from going blind. Director [[Lars von Trier]] eventually asked her to consider playing the role of Selma, convincing her that the only true way to capture the character of Selma was to have the composer of the music play the character.<ref>[http://www.bjork.com/facts/about/right.php?id=629 Why she decided to act], bjork.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222180117/http://www.bjork.com/facts/about/right.php?id=629 |date=22 December 2007 }}</ref> Eventually, she accepted. Filming began in early 1999, and the film debuted in 2000 at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival|53rd Cannes Film Festival]]. The film received the [[Palme d'Or]], and Björk received the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Award]] for her role.<ref name="festival-cannes.com" /> It was reported that the shoot was so physically and emotionally tiring that she vowed never to act again.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Chris Heath |url=https://www.gq.com/story/lars-von-trier-gq-interview-bjork-john-c-reilly-kirsten-dunst-nicole-kidman-extras |title=Lars and His Real Girls |magazine=GQ |date=17 October 2011 |access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref> Björk later stated that she always wanted to do one musical in her life, and ''Dancer in the Dark'' was the one.<ref>[http://www.bjork.com/facts/about/right.php?id=541 Why she won't make another movie], bjork.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222180111/http://www.bjork.com/facts/about/right.php?id=541 |date=22 December 2007 }}</ref> The soundtrack Björk created for the film was released with the title ''[[Selmasongs]]''. The album features a duet with [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]] titled "[[I've Seen It All]]", which was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and was performed at the 2001 Oscars (without Yorke), while Björk was wearing her celebrated [[swan dress]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/3167702/Liz-Hurley-safety-pin-dress-voted-the-greatest-dress.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Urmee | last=Khan | title=Liz Hurley 'safety pin' dress voted the greatest dress | date=9 October 2008}}</ref>

=== 2001–2003: ''Vespertine'' and ''Greatest Hits'' ===
[[File:Björk and the Swan Dress.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Björk at the 2001 Academy Awards, wearing her [[swan dress]]]]
In 2001, Björk released the album ''[[Vespertine]]''. It featured chamber orchestras, choirs, hushed vocals, microbeats made from household sounds, and personal, vulnerable themes. For the album, she collaborated with experimental musicians such as [[Matmos]], Denmark-based [[Thomas Knak|DJ Thomas Knak]], and harpist [[Zeena Parkins]]. Lyrical sources included the works of American [[poetry|poet]] [[E. E. Cummings]], the American independent filmmaker [[Harmony Korine]], and English playwright [[Sarah Kane]]'s penultimate play, ''[[Crave (play)|Crave]]''. To coincide with the album's release, [[Björk (book)|an eponymous coffee table book]] of loose prose and photographs was published.<ref>[http://unit.bjork.com/specials/book/book3.htm Björk : book, A project by Björk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028072125/http://unit.bjork.com/specials/book/book3.htm|date=28 October 2006}} Official Bjork website. Retrieved 23 December 2011.</ref> Björk embarked on the [[Vespertine World Tour]]. The shows were held in theatres and opera houses in order to have "the best acoustics possible." She was accompanied by Matmos, Parkins and an [[Inuit]] choir, whom she had held auditions for on a trip to Greenland prior to the tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bjork/articles/story/5933169/bjork_gets_orchestric |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106221048/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bjork/articles/story/5933169/bjork_gets_orchestric |title=Bjork Gets Orchestric: Bjork |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |archive-date=6 January 2008 |url-status=dead |access-date=6 August 2001}}</ref> At the time, ''Vespertine'' was Björk's fastest selling album to date, having sold two million copies by the end of 2001.<ref>''Q Magazine'', February 2002, Q Concert Review, "Björk – Haskolaboi, Reykjavik", by Nick Duerden.</ref>

''Vespertine'' spawned three singles: "[[Hidden Place]]", "[[Pagan Poetry]]", and "[[Cocoon (Björk song)|Cocoon]]". [[MTV2]] played the album's first video, "Hidden Place", which was subsequently released as a DVD single. The next video, for "Pagan Poetry", brought Björk to an even higher level of controversy with the channel. The video features graphic piercings, Björk's exposed nipples, and simulated [[fellatio]].<ref>[https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/nsfw-its-the-18-most-explicit-music-videos-ever-6778 NSFW! – It's The 18 Most Explicit Music Videos Ever]. Nme.Com. Retrieved 28 February 2011.</ref> As a result, the clip was banned from MTV. In 2002, it was aired unedited as part of a late night special on MTV2 titled, "Most Controversial Music Videos". The video for "Cocoon" also featured a seemingly naked Björk (actually wearing a close fitting bodysuit), this time with her nipples secreting a red thread that eventually enveloped her in a cocoon. The video was directed by Japanese artist [[Eiko Ishioka]] and was not aired by MTV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/bjork-cocoon-banned-music-videos/|title=Bjork, 'Cocoon' – Banned Music Videos|website=Diffuser.fm|language=en|access-date=29 April 2018}}</ref> She was invited to record "[[Gollum's Song]]" for the film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' but declined the invitation, as she was then pregnant; the song was instead recorded by another Icelander, [[Emilíana Torrini]].

In 2002 the CD box set ''[[Family Tree (Björk album)|Family Tree]]'' was issued. It comprised selected rarities as well as previously unreleased versions of her compositions, including her work with the [[Brodsky Quartet]]. Also released alongside ''Family Tree'' was the album ''[[Greatest Hits (Björk album)|Greatest Hits]]'', a retrospective of the previous 10 years of her solo career as deemed by the public. The songs on the album were chosen by Björk's fans through a poll on her website. A DVD edition of the CD was also released. It contained all of Björk's solo music videos up to that point. The new single from the set, "It's in Our Hands" charted in the UK at number 37.<ref name=":1" /> The video, directed by [[Spike Jonze]], features a heavily pregnant Björk. She gave birth to daughter Isadora Bjarkardottir Barney on 3 October 2002.<ref>[http://www.biography.com/people/bj%C3%B6rk-9542528 Björk Biography]. Biography.com. Retrieved 30 May 2015.</ref> Björk and the Brodsky Quartet recorded "Prayer of the Heart", a composition written for her by composer [[John Tavener]]  in 2001, and it was played then for a slide show presentation in 2003 for the American photographer, [[Nan Goldin]]. In 2003, Björk released a box set, ''[[Live Box]]'', consisting of four CDs containing [[concert|live recordings]] of her previous albums and a DVD featuring a video of one track from each CD. Each of the four CDs was later released separately at a reduced price.

=== 2004–2006: ''Medúlla'' and ''Drawing Restraint 9'' ===
In August 2004, Björk released ''[[Medúlla]]''. During production, Björk decided the album would work best as an entirely vocal-based album. This initial plan was modified, as the majority of the sounds on the album are indeed created by vocalists but several feature prominent basic electronic programming, as well as the occasional musical instrument. Björk used the vocal skills of [[Inuit throat singing|throat singer]] [[Tanya Tagaq]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] [[beatboxing|beatboxer]] [[Rahzel]], Japanese beatboxer [[Dokaka]], avant-rocker [[Mike Patton]], [[Soft Machine]] drummer/singer [[Robert Wyatt]], and several [[choir]]s. She again appropriated text from E. E. Cummings for the song "Sonnets/Unrealities XI". At the time, ''Medúlla'' became her highest charting album in the US, debuting at number 14.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bjork/chart-history/tsl/|title=Björk Medulla Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=4 March 2018}}</ref>

In August 2004, Björk performed the song "[[Oceania (song)|Oceania]]" at the [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]] of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]]. As she sang, her dress slowly unfurled to reveal a 10,000 square foot (900&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) map of the world, which she let flow over all of the Olympic athletes. The song "Oceania" was written especially for the occasion and features the talents of [[Shlomo (beatboxing artist)|Shlomo]], a [[Leeds]]-based [[beatboxing|beatboxer]], and a London choir. An alternative version of the song began circulating on the Internet with additional vocals by [[Kelis]]. It originally appeared on the promotional "Oceania" single released to radio stations and later became available to the public as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the "[[Who Is It (Björk song)|Who Is It]]" single, which charted at number 26 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/20041024/7501/|title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref> This was followed in early 2005 by "[[Triumph of a Heart]]", charting at number 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/20050306/7501/|title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref> A video for the potential next single, "[[Where Is the Line]]", was filmed in collaboration with the Icelandic artist [[Gabríela Friðriksdóttir]] in late 2004. This was initially a sequence from an art installation movie of the artists but was released exclusively on the ''[[The Medúlla Videos|Medúlla Videos]]'' DVD as an official promo for the track.

[[File:Björk2006.jpg|right|thumb|Björk DJing off of her laptop in 2006]]
In 2005, Björk collaborated with partner [[Matthew Barney]] on the experimental art film ''[[Drawing Restraint 9]]'', a dialogueless exploration of [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Björk and Barney both appear in the film, playing two occidental guests on a Japanese factory whaling vessel who ultimately transform into two whales. She is also responsible for the film's soundtrack, her second after ''Selmasongs''. Björk also appeared in the 2005 documentary ''[[Screaming Masterpiece]]'', which delves into the Icelandic music scene. The movie features archive footage of the Sugarcubes and [[Tappi Tíkarrass]] and an ongoing conversation with Björk herself. During this era, Björk earned another [[BRIT Awards]] nomination for Best International Female Solo Artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjork.com/news/?id=568;year=2006|title=bjork.com / news|date=12 June 2007|access-date=30 November 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612090709/http://bjork.com/news/?id=568;year=2006|archive-date=12 June 2007}}</ref> She was also awarded the Inspiration Award at the Annual ''[[Q magazine|Q Magazine]]'' Awards in October 2005, accepting the prize from Robert Wyatt, with whom she collaborated on ''Medúlla''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20051010_Q.shtml |title=Q Awards Play Safe |work=[[BBC]] |access-date=23 December 2011}}</ref> In 2006, Björk remastered her first three solo studio albums (''Debut'', ''Post'', ''Homogenic'') and her two soundtrack albums (''Selmasongs'' and ''Drawing Restraint 9'') in 5.1 surround sound for a re-issue in a new box-set titled ''[[Surrounded (Björk album)|Surrounded]]'', released on 27 June.

[[File:Bjork Amsterdam 2007 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Björk performing in Amsterdam (2007)]]
Björk's sixth full-length studio album, ''[[Volta (album)|Volta]]'', was released on 7 May 2007. It features 10 tracks.

It also uses the [[Reactable]], a novel "tangible-interface" synthesizer from the [[Universitat Pompeu Fabra]] in [[Barcelona]], which on ''Volta'' is played by Damian Taylor. The first single from the album, "[[Earth Intruders]]", was released digitally on 9 April 2007 and became her second-ever [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] entry in the United States. ''Volta'' debuted at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, becoming her first top 10 album in the US, netting week-one sales of 43,000.

In late 2012, it was reported that Björk had undergone surgery for a [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]] on her vocal cords.

They had a son, Sindri Eldon Þórsson, born 8 June 1986, the same day that the band was formed.<ref name=":0" /> They had divorced before the end of 1986, but continued to work together in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icelandtravel.is/blog/bjork-iceland/|title=Bjork - Iceland|work=Iceland Travel|date=27 January 2020}}</ref>

=== Move to London/Spain ===
Following the breakup of the Sugarcubes, Björk moved to [[London]], where she was immediately offered a record deal. She became engaged to London based DJ [[Goldie]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cadwalladr |first1=Carole |title=Goldie Interview, The Alchemist |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/30/goldie-interview-the-alchemist |website=The Guardian |date=30 January 2011 |access-date=8 March 2021}}</ref> but broke up with him in 1996.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Strong |first1=Martin |title=The Great Rock Discography |date=2000 |publisher=Mojo Books |location=Edinburgh |isbn=1-84195-017-3 |page=389}}</ref> She also had a brief relationship with musician [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] in the 1990s.<ref>Tom Mann (12 June 2013). "Tricky on Massive Attack, Bjork, Obama and false idols". FasterLouder. FasterLouder Pty Ltd. Archived from the original on 17 July 2013. Retrieved 4 August 2013.</ref> During this period, she became involved with the [[trip hop]] scene with which Goldie and Tricky were associated. Björk also began her work with fashion designer [[Alexander McQueen]]. As a result of her time spent in London, Björk developed a [[cockney]] accent, evident in her interviews given in English at the time.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eloise |first1=Mariane |title=Your guide to Björk, one of our greatest living artists |url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/32551/1/bjork-ultimate-guide |website=Dazed Digital |date=24 August 2016}}</ref>

In London, Björk grew tired of public life and the constant harassment from the paparazzi, in particular over her relationships with Tricky and Goldie. She moved to Spain after receiving an offer to stay there from Trevor Morais, her tour drummer, who had a residential studio at [[Marbella]], [[Andalusia]],<ref>Andrew Purcell "Bjork goes public with her broken heart on Vulnicura" March 13, 2013 https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/bjork-goes-public-with-her-broken-heart-on-vulnicura-20150310-13yt8m.html</ref> where she produced ''[[Homogenic]]'' (1997).

=== Matthew Barney ===
In the late 1990s, Björk lived in New York, where she met artist [[Matthew Barney]] in the art scene. The pair formed a relationship and started living together, moving to [[Brooklyn Heights]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robledo |first1=S.

Barney and Björk initially kept their work separate, but then collaborated on Barney's art film ''[[Drawing Restraint 9]]'', a long-term project released in 2005; Björk acted in the film and also contributed musical elements.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Romney |first1=Jonathon |title=Matthew Barney:The Bizarre Genius of Bjork's Boyfriend |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/matthew-barney-the-bizarre-genius-of-bjork-s-boyfriend-402351.html |work=The Independent |date=18 September 2011 |access-date=8 March 2021}}</ref> The couple broke up in 2013. At the time, she described it as "the most painful thing" that she had ever experienced. The album ''[[Vulnicura]]'', and in particular the track "Black Lake", were written about the breakup.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bjork Discusses the Breakdown of relationship with artist Matthew Barney which inspired Vulnicura |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/bjork-39-1216925 |website=New Musical Express |date=21 January 2015 |publisher=New Musical Express |access-date=9 March 2021}}</ref> Björk began to reside half of each year in Brooklyn Heights and the other half in two residences in Iceland with her daughter.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cahill |first1=Mikey |title=Bjork's Journey through a heart of darkness and the mending of a broken heart |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/bjoumlrks-journey-through-a-heart-of-darkness-and-the-mending-of-a-broken-heart/news-story/1245c2fe2019b9723df285937bd142a8 |website=Herald Sun |date=31 January 2015 |publisher=New Limited |access-date=8 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Purcell |first1=Andrew |title=Bjork goes public with her broken heart on Vulnicura |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/bjork-goes-public-with-her-broken-heart-on-vulnicura-20150310-13yt8m.htm |access-date=8 March 2021 |work=Sydney Morning Herald. |publisher=Fairfax limited |date=13 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Paparazzi confrontations ===
In February 1996, Björk arrived at [[Don Mueang International Airport|Bangkok International Airport]] with her son Sindri after a long-haul flight. Reporters were present, despite Björk's early request that the press leave her and her son alone until a press conference.<ref name="SalonMay2001">{{cite web|author=Chris Colin|date=1 May 2001|title=Bjork|url=http://www.salon.com/2001/05/01/bjork/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926080532/http://www.salon.com/people/bc/2001/05/01/bjork/print.html|archive-date=26 September 2011|access-date=2 January 2016|website=Salon.com}}</ref> As Björk attempted to walk away from the [[paparazzi]], television reporter Julie Kaufman approached Sindri and said, "Welcome to Bangkok!" In response, Björk lunged at Kaufman, knocking her to the ground and banging her head against the concrete floor until security intervened.<ref name="SalonMay2001" /> Björk later apologized to Kaufman, who declined to press charges.<ref name="SalonMay2001" />

On 13 January 2008, Björk attacked a photographer who had photographed her arrival at [[Auckland International Airport]] in New Zealand for her scheduled performance at the [[Big Day Out]] festival.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/bpeopleb-bjork-goes-berserk-at-nz-airport/2008/01/14/1200159319463.html "Bjork attacks photographer"].

== Other ventures ==

=== Charitable work ===
After the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami]] that struck [[Southeast Asia]] in late 2004, Björk began work on a new project titled ''[[Army of Me: Remixes and Covers]]'' to help raise money for a relief fund. This project recruited fans and musicians from around the world to either cover or remix the 1995 track "Army of Me." From over 600 responses, Björk and her co-writer Graham Massey picked the best 20 versions to appear on the album. The album was released in April in the UK and in late May 2005 in the US. By January 2006, the album had raised about £250,000 to help [[UNICEF]]'s work in the southeast Asian region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjork.com/news/?id=566;year=2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612044715/http://bjork.com/news/?id=566%3Byear%3D2006 |archive-date=12 June 2007 |title=Army of Me : The progress |date=12 June 2007 |access-date=20 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Björk visited [[Banda Aceh]] in February 2006 to view some of UNICEF's work with the children who were affected by the tsunami.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080411064101/http://www.unicef.org.uk/photogalleries/gallery.asp?gallery_id=29&nodeid=g29 Björk visits UNICEF's work in Banda Aceh photo gallery], 2008</ref>

On 2 July 2005, Björk took part in the [[Live 8]] series of concerts, headlining the [[Live 8 concert, Chiba|Japan show]] with [[Do As Infinity]], [[Good Charlotte]] and [[McFly]].

=== Political activity ===
Björk's years in [[Kukl (band)|Kukl]] aligned her with the [[anarchist]] [[Crass Collective]].<ref>{{cite web| author= Vidar Ringstrøm | url= http://www.hanshan.org/musikk/kukl.php| title= Kukl| publisher= Hanshan.org| access-date= 9 January 2011}}</ref> While she has since been hesitant to be seen as an overtly political figure, and has said so on her website,<ref name=cmomse>[http://bjork.com/news/?id=779;year=2008 "Statement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307190346/http://bjork.com/news/?id=779%3Byear%3D2008 |date=7 March 2008 }}, ''björk.com/news 2008'', 4 March 2008.

She dedicated her song "[[Declare Independence]]" to [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], which caused a minor controversy in the Faroes. After Björk twice dedicated "Declare Independence" to the people of [[Kosovo]] during a concert in Japan,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7276891.stm Asia-Pacific | Bjork makes 'free Tibet' gesture].

Tibet!" during the song. China's [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Culture]] issued a denunciation through state news agency [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]], stating that Björk "broke Chinese law" and "hurt Chinese people's feelings" and pledged to further tighten control over foreign artists performing in China.

Björk has also taken an interest in environmental issues in Iceland. In 2004, she took part in the Hætta concert in Reykjavík, organised in protest against the building of [[Alcoa]] [[aluminium]] smelters in the country, which would make Iceland the biggest smelter in Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4143741-interview--bjork-talks-piracy-punk-lady-gaga-and-biophilia|title=Interview: Bjork talks piracy, punk, Lady Gaga and Biophilia|work=DrownedInSound|access-date=14 May 2018|language=en|archive-date=14 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514214106/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4143741-interview--bjork-talks-piracy-punk-lady-gaga-and-biophilia|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/2008/10/bj-rk-speaks-iceland-sold-out-to-big-industry|title=Björk Speaks!

Björk wrote the [[foreword]] to the English translation of the Icelandic bestseller by [[Andri Snær Magnason]] titled "Dreamland."

On 21 May 2010, Björk wrote an open letter in ''[[The Reykjavík Grapevine]]'' calling on the Icelandic government to "do everything in its power to revoke the contracts with [[Magma Energy]]," the Canadian company that owns Icelandic geothermal company [[Alterra Power|HS Orka]].<ref>{{cite web| author= [http://www.grapevine.is/ grapevine.is]| year= 2010| title= Björk on Magma Energy| url= http://grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Letter-From-Bjork-About-Magma-Energy| access-date= 21 May 2010| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100524161308/http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Letter-From-Bjork-About-Magma-Energy| archive-date= 24 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/40844-bjork-talks-about-icelandic-energy-controversy/|title=Björk Talks About Icelandic Energy Controversy|website=Pitchfork|date=3 December 2010|access-date=9 January 2011}}</ref>

In 2014, Björk helped to organise Stopp, Let's Protect the Park, an event organised to raise money and awareness for the preservation of Icelandic nature. This included a show at [[Harpa (concert hall)|Harpa Concert Hall]], at which she performed three songs. The concert initially raised $310,000<ref>{{cite web| year= 2014| title= Bjork and friends raise ISK 35 million for nature protection| url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2014/03/18/bjork-and-friends-raise-isk-35-million-nature-protection| access-date=1 May 2014}}</ref> and went on to raise £3 million overall, with plans to use the money to establish a national park.<ref>{{cite web| year= 2014| title= Björk: Even venture capitalists understand our future is in nature| website= [[TheGuardian.com]]| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/15/bjork-venture-capitalists-iceland-understand-future-in-nature| access-date=15 June 2014}}</ref>

=== Protégés ===
Over her extensive career, Björk has frequently used her position and influence to help launch new acts or [[mentor]] them as they establish themselves as recording artists.

The first example was the Iranian-born [[electronica]] producer [[Leila Arab]], who was initially recruited to play [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and provide backing vocals on Björk's first international solo [[Debut Tour|tour]] in 1993 in support of ''Debut''. In 1995, Björk recalled Arab for her second touring band for tour in support of ''Post''. This time, Arab was given her first opportunity to experiment with live output mixing from the stage rather than playing keyboards. This would later form the basis of Arab's own solo music career, in which she has integrated live mixing into her own compositions and live shows. Arab went on to release three international solo albums throughout the 1990s and appears on the influential [[electronica]] labels [[Rephlex Records]], [[XL Recordings]] and [[Warp (record label)|Warp Records]].<ref>[http://wearsthetrousers.com/2009/09/10/leila-arab-her-own-private-revolution/ words in edgeways with leila arab « wears the trousers magazine :: a women in music compendium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923181028/http://wearsthetrousers.com/2009/09/10/leila-arab-her-own-private-revolution/|date=23 September 2009}}. Wearsthetrousers.com (10 September 2009). Retrieved 28 February 2011.</ref>

In 1998, Björk established her own short-lived record label, Ear Records, which operated under the [[One Little Indian Records]] umbrella. Her only signee that received a release was her longtime friend Magga Stína, who recorded her debut solo album under the production of Björk's longtime collaborator [[Graham Massey]] (of the British electronica act [[808 State]]). The album was simply titled ''An Album'' and featured just one single release, "Naturally." In 1998, Björk invited Magga to perform as her support act on the Homogenic Tour, and in 2004 Magga contributed to the production of ''[[Medúlla]]''. Magga still performs and records in Iceland.

In 2001, Björk became aware of Canadian [[Inuit throat singing|Inuit throat singer]] [[Tanya Tagaq]] and invited her to perform on several dates of Björk's [[Vespertine World Tour]] as a special guest. In 2004, Tagaq was invited to collaborate on the [[a cappella]] album ''Medúlla'', in which the duet "Ancestors" was recorded. "Ancestors" was later featured on Tagaq's first solo album, ''[[Sinaa]]'', in 2005.

In 2004, Arab discovered the work of Finnish multimedia artist Heidi Kilpeläinen, who had taken her combination of [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]], homemade [[electro (music)|electro]] pop with her own self-produced [[music videos]] and combined them under the [[alter ego]] character [[HK119]]. Leila soon referred HK119's work to Björk, who started mentioning HK119 in various press and interviews. In 2004, Arab announced HK119 as her favourite act of 2004. HK119 was soon signed to Björk's parent label One Little Indian Records, which released her [[HK119 (album)|debut album]] in 2006. HK119 and Björk appeared in a joint interview in ''[[Dazed|Dazed & Confused]]'' magazine in 2006, in which Björk stated about HK119's work: "It's unique. Even if I gave you $3 million, you couldn't improve on it... [Its] simplicity is [its] strength."<ref>[http://rachaelwarner.com/images/ts/7.jpg HK119 & Björk Interview, Dazed & Confused] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222145915/http://rachaelwarner.com/images/ts/7.jpg |date=22 February 2010 }}</ref> HK119 later released her albums ''[[Fast, Cheap and Out of Control (album)|Fast, Cheap and Out of Control]]'' in 2008 and ''Imaginature'' in 2013, both on One Little Indian Records.

In 2009, Björk used her website and various radio interviews to promote two more new acts. The first was fellow Icelandic musician [[Ólöf Arnalds]], who is also a member of the Icelandic [[folktronica]] band [[múm]]. In 2006, Arnalds released her debut solo album ''[[Við Og Við]]'' in Iceland. Björk mentioned Arnalds among her favourite recent new acts during a radio interview, and encouraged One Little Indian Records to reissue the album in the UK and Europe in 2009. Björk also praised the works of English artist [[Micachu]] and Syrian vocalist [[Omar Souleyman]]. She later used her website to host the premiere of [[Micachu]]'s debut video for [[Rough Trade Records]], "Turn Me Well."<ref>[http://bjork.com/news/?id=947;year=2009 björk.com/news 2011]. Bjork.com.
