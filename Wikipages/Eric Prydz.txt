===2009–2013: ''Eric Prydz Presents Pryda''===
In 2009, Prydz released "Miami to Atlanta", where the "Pryda snare" was first used. The Pryda snare is a popular technique in [[house music|house]] and [[trance music]] consisting of using a compressed and sustained snare sample at the end of a bar. Commonly used to mark progressions in a song structure, it has been widely sampled in the electronic dance music world, notably by producers such as [[Martin Garrix]], [[Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike]], and [[W&W]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://splice.com/blog/pryda-snare/|title=The Pryda Snare; History and Recreating it|date=2014-09-23|website=Splice blog|access-date=2016-05-01}}</ref>

On 21 May 2012, Prydz released his debut artist album, ''[[Eric Prydz Presents Pryda]]'', as a 3-disc album on [[Virgin Records]] ([[Astralwerks]] in the USA). Disc 1 is made up of new unreleased Pryda productions, which some fans may have heard as works in progress (including [[Old and Wise|Shadows]], Agag, Mighty Love, [[Polarkreis 18|Allein]] and the intro edit of [[Pjanoo]]). Discs 2 and 3 bring together many of the classic tracks from the Pryda catalogue, sequenced and continuously mixed by the man himself, including some of his special re-edits.<ref>{{cite web | title=Eric Prydz Presents: Pryda | publisher=EmiMusic.com | url=http://assets.emi.com/ericprydz/pryda/ | access-date=2012-03-21 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323205003/http://assets.emi.com/ericprydz/pryda/ | archive-date=March 23, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>
