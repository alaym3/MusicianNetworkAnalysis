'''Motorama''' is a Russian [[post-punk]] band from [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Russia]]. The band was formed in 2005. The group has received popularity not only in Russia but also abroad, especially in Europe, Latin America and Asia.

==Musical style and influences==
The band performs songs in [[English language|English]]. Vladislav Parshin's vocals have often been compared with the voice of [[Ian Curtis]], the frontman of the British band [[Joy Division]]. This, and the fact that Motorama played their first two [[Mini-LP|mini-albums]] in a style close to the sound of classic post-punk, led to the fact that the group is often accused of copying Joy Division. Motorama’s singles demonstrate a more melodic and ghostly sound than Joy Division’s dark and fast paced punk.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chaotischundcharmant.com/2011/03/motorama-interview-36.html |title=motorama. interview #36 |publisher=chaotisch und charmant |access-date=2015-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128132929/http://www.chaotischundcharmant.com/2011/03/motorama-interview-36.html |archive-date=2015-01-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Aston|first=Martin|title=Motorama Calendar Review|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/xp9p/|url-status=live|website=[[BBC Music]]}}</ref> The situation has changed with the release of the group's first LP, ''Alps''. This album featured intonations of [[New wave music|New Wave]] and Indie pop, and the music in general became more bright and melancholic than depressive. 
The band is influenced by Soviet post-punk bands like [[Kino (band)|Kino]] and [[Zvuki Mu]], as well as [[ethereal wave]]. 

In 2010, a side-project of participants of the Motorama, the group Utro ({{Lang-ru|Утро|links=no|lit=Morning}}), released a [[Russian language|Russian-language]] album.

Motorama's second studio album, ''Calendar'', was released October 18, 2012 on the French label [[Talitres]].

Vladislav Parshin and Irene Parshina formed another side-project, Leto v Gorode ({{Lang-ru|Лето в городе|links=no|lit=Summer in the city}}), in 2012. 

On June 27, 2014 Oleg Chernov became the new touring drummer, replacing Roman Belenky, who left the band for family reasons.

Irene Parshina became a tour manager of Motorama and Utro.

The third album, ''Poverty'', was released January 26, 2015 via Talitres.

Single song "One Moment" was released on a special fifteenth anniversary Talitres vinyl in 2016.

The fourth album, ''Dialogues'', was released in 2016 via Talitres.
