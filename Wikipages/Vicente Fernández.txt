'''Vicente''' "'''Chente'''" '''Fernández Gómez''' (born 17 February 1940) is a Mexican retired singer, actor, and film producer. Nicknamed "'''El Charro de Huentitán'''" (The [[Charro]] from Huentitán),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonacich |first1=Drago |title=Vicente Fernández, Jr. {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vicente-fern%C3%A1ndez-jr-mn0000804242 |website=allmusic.com |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> "'''El Ídolo de México'''" (The Idol of Mexico),<ref name="billboardbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/430831/vicente-fernandez/biography|title=Vicente Fernández – Biography|author=Jeff Tamarkin ([[Rovi Corporation]])|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=15 August 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170921032644/https://www.billboard.com/artist/430831/vicente-fernandez/biography |archive-date = 21 September 2017}}</ref> and "'''El Rey de la Música Ranchera'''" (The King of [[Ranchera]] Music),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tamarkin |first1=Jeff |title=Vicente Fernández <nowiki>|</nowiki> Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vicente-fern%C3%A1ndez-mn0000197424/biography |website=allmusic.com |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> Fernández started his career as a [[street performance|busker]], and has since become a [[cultural icon]], recording more than 50 albums and contributing to more than 30 films. His repertoire consists of rancheras and other Mexican classics. He is accompanied live by a mariachi group, but he is not technically a mariachi musician, as he only sings live. Vicente's fame rose after the death of [[Javier Solís]] (El Rey del Bolero Ranchero).

Fernández's work has earned him three [[Grammy Awards]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/vicente-fernandez|title=Vicente Fernandez|date=17 March 2014|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|access-date=14 January 2019}}</ref> eight [[Latin Grammy Awards]], fourteen [[Lo Nuestro Awards]], and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He has sold over 50 million copies worldwide, making him one of the best-selling regional Mexican artists of all time.<ref name="billboardbio" /> In 2016, Fernández retired from performing live, although he continues to record and publish music.

== Early life ==
Born on 17 February 1940<ref name="billboardbio" /> in the suburb of Huentitán El Alto in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Fernández spent his early years on his father Ramon's ranch on the outskirts of Guadalajara. He also worked at a young age as a waiter, dish washer, cashier, and finally manager of his uncle's restaurant. "Chente", as he was commonly known, became fond of the idyllic ranch lifestyle. His mother often took him to see the films of [[Pedro Infante]]; he has said of these films' significance: "When I was  6 or 7, I would go see Pedro Infante's movies, and I would tell my mother, 'When I grow up, I'll be like him.'" By age 8 he had taken up the guitar and was practicing singing in the style of the ranchera singers he heard on the radio. As a boy, Fernández sang at a festival in [[Arandas, Jalisco|Arandas]], Mexico where he won the contest. Later, at 12, he won 31 pesos in another contest. In 1954 he won an amateur contest sponsored by a [[Guadalajara]] television station. It was his first break into performing and he began to play at local clubs and gatherings. Around this time, however, Fernández's father lost the ranch and the family moved into the city of [[Tijuana]]. Fernández, who had dropped out of school in fifth grade, began working jobs in the city such as janitor, dishwasher, waiter and whatever else he could find, all the while holding to his musical aspirations.

In 1960, Fernández devoted himself to music full-time. He went back to [[Jalisco]], where he performed as a [[busker]] and occasionally appeared on the television show ''La calandria musical''. After a couple of years Fernández tried his luck in [[Mexico City]], where he found a job singing in a restaurant called "El Amanacer Tapatío". When he wasn't working, he was auditioning -unsuccessfully— for record companies. Discouraged, he left around 1963 to marry María del Refugio "Cuca" Abarca Villasenor. They now have three sons: Vicente Jr., Gerardo, and Alejandro.<ref name="sortmusic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.sortmusic.com/_v/vicente-fernandez-biography,len.html|title=Vicente Fernández Biography|publisher=Sortmusic.com|access-date=13 November 2015}}</ref> Vicente Jr was born 3 months premature in 1963; Fernández's mother died the same week.

== Career ==
{{expand section|date=August 2021}}
In the spring of 1966, Javier Solís, Mexico's most popular traditional singer, died. Discos CBS, the recording label in the Mexican department of [[CBS Records International]], offered Fernández a recording contract. He released his first recording, "Perdóname", with the company in 1966; Fernández still records for the label, which is now [[Sony Music Latin]] of [[Sony Music Entertainment]].

He branched into acting with the 1971 film ''Tacos al carbón''. His first hit movie, for which he did the soundtrack, was 1974's ''La ley del monte''.  He stopped acting in 1991. Maintaining the ranchera tradition, Fernández always performs wearing the [[charro]], an embroidered suit, and sombrero.

In 1970, just as Fernández was about to go onstage, his father died. Overwhelmed by the news but determined not to let the crowd go without a show, Fernández went onstage and performed. By the end of the night the critics were comparing him to other famous ranchera artists like [[José Alfredo Jiménez]], [[Jorge Negrete]], and Javier Solís. Since then his music has expanded rapidly. In 1998, he continued to tour despite the kidnapping of his oldest son. (He was released 4 months later with a ransom of $3.2 million.)<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kidnapping won't drive Fernandez from Mexico|url=https://www.deseret.com/1998/9/26/19403319/kidnapping-won-t-drive-fernandez-from-mexico|last=News|first=Deseret|date=1998-09-26|website=Deseret News|language=en|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref>

Fernández has recorded more than 50 albums in 35 years and claims to have recorded 300 more songs, making another 30 albums possible even if he retires. When he records an album, he spends 12–13 hours in the studio recording up to 18 songs; he takes a day off, then returns for another marathon session of recording another 15 or more songs. From this accumulation, he and his producer choose 12 tracks. Fernández's greatest hit was ''"[[Volver Volver|Volver, volver]],"'' released in 1972; his first million-selling album was 1983's ''15 Grandes con el número uno''. In 1987 he launched his first tour outside the United States and Mexico when he traveled to [[Bolivia]] and [[Colombia]].
On 16 April 2016, Fernández performed for the last time in his career at [[Estadio Azteca]] effectively announcing his retirement.

==Politics and controversies==
Fernández has long been associated with the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI), which governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and again between 2012 and 2018. Fernández was one of the many performers who participated in the "Solidaridad" campaign during the administration of [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Solidaridad Official Song |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCbnnewabpE}}</ref> and has also performed at PRI rallies, attended PRI events or met with politicians from that party; on one occasion, he performed the song "Estos celos" for then-President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] (a PRI member) during an official celebration.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vicente Fernández le canta a Peña Nieto 'Estos celos' |url=https://www.vertigopolitico.com/politica/federal/vicente-fernandez-le-canta-a-pena-nieto-estos-celos |access-date=25 May 2020 |publisher=Vertigo Politico |date=19 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Meeting between a PRI candidate and Fernández. |url=https://twitter.com/tstlajomulco/status/989972974227734528 |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Quiroz |first1=Carlos |title=Comienza transformación de Jalisco: Aristóteles Sandoval |url=https://www.imagenradio.com.mx/comienza-transformacion-de-jalisco-aristoteles-sandoval |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>

Fernández sparked controversy after some statements he made during an interview in May 2019 regarding his health. Fernández stated that he had been interned at a hospital in [[Houston]], United States to undergo a liver surgery, but he decided to reject a transplant because he did not "want to sleep with [his] wife while having the liver of another man, who could have been a homosexual or a drug user".<ref>{{cite web |title=Vicente Fernández rechazó trasplante de hígado por temor a que fuera de un homosexual o drogadicto |date=8 May 2019 |url=https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/vicente-fernandez-rechazo-trasplante-de-higado-por-temor-que-fuera-de-un-homosexual-o |publisher=El Universal |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>

In January 2021, Fernández sparked another controversy after placing his hand on a fan's breast while taking a picture with her family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amicohoops.net/silence-is-broken-by-a-fan-touching-vicente-fernandezs-breast/|title=Silence Is Broken By A Fan Touching Vicente Fernandez's Breast|date=January 23, 2021|first=Arzu|last=Daniel|website=Amico Hoops|access-date=January 26, 2021}}</ref> A few days later, Fernández issued an apology to the woman's family, stating that "I admit that I was wrong, I don't know if I was joking, maybe it was a joke [...] I don't know. I do not remember, there were many people (with whom I took photos), sincerely I offer an apology".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/america/entretenimiento/2021/01/26/no-fui-santo-pero-nunca-me-vieron-vicente-fernandez-respondio-al-escandalo-de-tocamientos-indebidos-a-seguidoras/|language=Spanish|trans-title="Harassing is that I have lowered her blouse": this is how Vicente Fernández responded to the scandal of the video with his follower|title="Acosar es que yo le haya bajado la blusa": así respondió Vicente Fernández al escándalo del video con su seguidora|date=January 26, 2021|website=[[Infobae]]|access-date=January 26, 2021}}</ref>

==Falling accident==
Fernández was hospitalized in serious condition after falling at his home in Guadalajara on 6 August 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/vicente-fernandez-in-serious-but-stable-condition-after-severe-fall-170262|title=Vicente Fernández in 'Serious But Stable' Condition After Severe Fall|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref> He was placed on a [[ventilator]] under the intensive care unit and had injured his [[cervical vertebrae|cervical spine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abc13.com/vicente-fernandez-hospitalized-legendary-mexican-singer-news-king-of-rancheras/10942536/|title=Vicente Fernández news: Legendary Mexican singer on ventilator in ICU after fall|publisher=ABC|access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref>
