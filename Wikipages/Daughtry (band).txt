==History==
===2005–08: ''Daughtry'' and breakthrough success===
Chris Daughtry, who finished in fourth place on the [[American Idol (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2006, stated that he would form a new band after turning down [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]]'s offer to make him their lead singer.<ref name="news14charlotte">{{cite web|url=http://www.news14charlotte.com/content/top_stories/default.asp?ArID=121114 |title=TWC News - Charlotte - Salisbury, Gastonia |publisher=News14charlotte.com |access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref> On July 10, 2006, Chris Daughtry had signed with [[19 Entertainment]] and [[RCA Records]], which holds contracts with fellow ''American Idol'' finalists [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Kellie Pickler]], among others. Chris Daughtry is a singer-songwriter himself and has collaborated with several other songwriters, such as [[Live (band)|Live]]'s [[Edward Kowalczyk|Ed Kowalczyk]], [[Seether]]'s [[Shaun Morgan]], [[Goo Goo Dolls]]'s [[John Rzeznik]], [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]]'s [[Carl Bell (musician)|Carl Bell]], [[3 Doors Down]]'s [[Brad Arnold]], [[Matchbox Twenty]]'s [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]], [[SR-71 (band)|SR-71]]'s [[Mitch Allan]],<ref name="mtvnews">{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1538728/20060816/index.jhtml?headlines=true |title=Chris Daughtry Drafts Fuel Guitarist For LP – News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=August 16, 2006 |access-date=September 20, 2011}}</ref> [[Shinedown]]'s [[Brent Smith]], [[Three Days Grace]]'s [[Adam Gontier]], and the former [[The Click Five]] singer [[Eric Dill]], [[Theory of a Deadman]]'s Tyler Connolly, [[Lifehouse (band)|Lifehouse]]'s [[Jason Wade]] and [[Nickelback]]'s [[Chad Kroeger]].

Daughtry and members of his label held auditions. Ultimately, they chose four members for the band: Jeremy Brady, 21, guitarist (no longer in the band); Josh Steely, 36, lead guitarist; [[Josh Paul (musician)|Josh Paul]], 29, bassist who played for [[Suicidal Tendencies]]; Joey Barnes, 30, drummer, (no longer with the band). Two of the band members hail from [[North Carolina]] – Barnes, whom Chris Daughtry had known for some time, and Brady, who was introduced to him a month before the audition. Steely and Paul are both from California.<ref name="americanidolworship">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanidolworship.com/2006/10/daughtry-band-members-announced-perform-in-la/ |title=Daughtry Band Members Announced, Perform in L.A. – American Idol Worship |publisher=Americanidolworship.com |date=October 17, 2006 |access-date=September 20, 2011}}</ref> The decision was made to name the band "Daughtry" in order to keep name recognition. In an interview, Chris Daughtry said, "We could have come out with a really obscure name, but coming from a TV show and having name recognition, it was easier just to go with my last name."

The band's [[Daughtry (album)|self-titled debut album]] was produced by [[Howard Benson]] and was released by [[RCA Records]] on November 21, 2006. Chris Daughtry wrote and co-wrote all but two songs on the album – "[[Feels Like Tonight]]" and "[[What About Now (Daughtry song)|What About Now]]".<ref name="mtvnews"/> Other notable songwriters [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Max Martin]] contributed to the album, and session drummer [[Josh Freese]] played on all tracks. However, at the time the album was recorded, Chris Daughtry was the only official member of the band, leading some to mistakenly believe that the band Daughtry is his solo career.

''Daughtry'' was an instant success and spawned several hits for the group, starting with its first single "[[It's Not Over (Daughtry song)|It's Not Over]]", which debuted on the radio on December 6, 2006, after being delayed from a planned September release<ref name="mtvnews"/> and reaching number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and hitting the top 3 in several other charts.  Shortly thereafter, Jeremy Brady departed and was replaced with Brian Craddock, 31, from Virginia. In interviews, Chris Daughtry and Craddock have discussed having known each other when Chris Daughtry was still a member of Absent Element.<ref name="leaving">{{cite web|url=http://www.daughtryofficial.com/news/breaking-news-chris |title=Daughtry Breaking News From Chris &#124; The Official Daughtry Site |publisher=Daughtryofficial.com |access-date=September 20, 2011}}</ref>

After the success of "It's Not Over," the second single from the album, "[[Home (Daughtry song)|Home]]" was released and peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, after debuting at number 83, weeks ahead of its official release to radio. The song was also the official "kick-off" song on sixth season of ''[[American Idol]]'', played after a contestant was voted off the show, also the case during season five of ''[[Australian Idol]]''. The Brazilian version of ''Idol'', called ''[[Ídolos Brazil]]'', used this song as well in its second season.  The album's third single, "[[What I Want (Daughtry song)|What I Want]]", was released to rock radio on April 23, 2007, featuring musician [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] on lead guitars. The single has peaked at number 6 on the rock charts and is featured as a playable song on [[Guitar Hero: On Tour]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. The band's fourth single "[[Over You (Daughtry song)|Over You]]" was released on July 24, 2007. The band performed this single live on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on June 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3234617/ |title=Now on ABC News Video - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref>  "[[Crashed]]", the album's fifth single, was released to rock stations on September 10, 2007, where it was also used in a commercial for [[Lego]] [[Bionicle]]. The song was also performed on the Pre-Race show on ABC for the [[NASCAR]] [[NEXTEL Cup]] [[Chevy Rock and Roll 400]]. The album's sixth single, "[[Feels Like Tonight]]", was released on January 8, 2008, just over a year after the album's release. The video debuted in January and the song was used for the 2007 WWE Tribute to the Troops. Their song "There and Back Again" was also the official theme song for [[WWE Backlash]] in 2007.

Due to the success of the singles, ''Daughtry'' was certified 4x Platinum on April 24, 2008. The group is on page 8 on [[Myspace.com]] of the most played artists, with over 29 million plays. In addition, the group has appeared on the famous [[compilation album]] series ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' five times, with their songs "[[It's Not Over (Daughtry song)|It's Not Over]]", "[[Home (Daughtry song)|Home]]", "Over You", "[[Feels Like Tonight]]" and "[[What About Now (Daughtry song)|What About Now]]". The band was also nominated for four [[Grammy Awards]] in 2008, for [[Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], [[Best Rock Album]], [[Best Rock Song]] and [[Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]. According to billboard.com, Daughtry has had twenty number one hits around the world.

A deluxe edition of Daughtry's self-titled album was released on September 9, 2008. Along with the original CD, this expanded CD/DVD package features four bonus tracks, including acoustic versions of "What About Now," "It's Not Over", and "Home", plus a cover of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s "[[Feels Like the First Time (Foreigner song)|Feels Like the First Time]]". The DVD contains all five of Daughtry's music videos, two rarely seen live clips, and exclusive behind-the-scenes tour footage.

A shortened version of their massive hit single "Home" was used at the end of the English League Cup Final in February 2008 when the compilation of Tottenham Hotspur victory over Chelsea was shown at the end of the Sky coverage.

===2009–10: ''Leave This Town'' ===

==Band name==
Daughtry is often mistakenly believed to be Chris Daughtry's solo project. However, in a manner similar to [[Bon Jovi]], [[Dio (band)|Dio]], [[Dokken]] and [[Van Halen]], Daughtry is a band, taking Chris Daughtry's surname as their moniker. In an interview, Daughtry explained, "We could've come out with a really obscure name, but coming from [[American Idol|the TV show]] and having name recognition, it was easier just to go with my last name." He also joked, "[[Steel Dragon]] would have been great."

==Tours==
The band has been touring non-stop since January 2007. They have performed across the U.S. and Canada, along with shows in the UK, Germany, and Singapore.
