==Career==
Saha was born on November 1, 1991 in [[Bangladesh]]. The following year, he moved with his family to the United States, and studied at [[Herricks High School]] on Long Island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.momandpopmusic.com/jai-wolf/|title=Jai Wolf|website=Mom+Pop|accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref>

In 2011, Saha started producing electronic music under the moniker No Pets Allowed. Within a few years, his mashups and bootleg remixes began to generate attention, quickly rising within the internet music community.

In February 2014, Saha decided to part ways with the project and begin what is now known as Jai Wolf. Within the first few months, the project began to land a string of official remix opportunities for established artists including [[Melanie Martinez (singer)|Melanie Martinez]], [[Dirty South (musician)|Dirty South]], [[Alesso]] and [[Odesza]] – each remix landing the #1 spot on [[Hype Machine]]. In late 2014, [[Skrillex]] turned Jai Wolf's bootleg remix of "Ease My Mind" into an official remix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/11/20/skrillex-ease-my-mind-jai-wolf-remix|title=Someone Tweeted This Remix At Skrillex And Now He's Releasing It|website=The FADER|accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref>

In 2015, Jai Wolf released his debut single "Indian Summer" through [[ODESZA]]'s label, Foreign Family Collective.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/jai-wolf-makes-his-massive-debut-with-indian-summer-on-odeszas-foreign-family-collective|title=Jai Wolf Makes His Massive Debut With "Indian Summer" on ODESZA's Foreign Family Collective|website=Thump|accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref> "Indian Summer" reached number 31 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot Dance/Electronic song's chart. The track also earned a spot on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2015|Triple J 2015 Hottest 100]] in Australia.
