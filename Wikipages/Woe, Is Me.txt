'''Woe, Is Me''' was an American [[metalcore]] band from [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Formed in 2009, the group was signed to [[Rise Records]] and its subsidiary, Velocity Records. Their debut album, ''[[Numbers (Woe, Is Me album)|Numbers]]'', was released on August 31, 2010 and charted at number 16 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers]] chart. Due to many lineup changes and conflicts, the only original member who remained in the band through its entire run was guitarist Kevin Hanson. The band broke up in September 2013.

==History==

===Formation and ''Numbers'' (2009–2010)===
Woe, Is Me was founded during the fall of 2009 in Atlanta by former [[Of Machines]] drummer Austin Thornton, who started the band along with Kevin Hanson, Cory Ferris, and Ben Ferris, who were all formerly of a local Atlanta-based band named Cheyne Stokes. Tim Sherrill, who played lead guitar of another local group named Shooter McGavin, also joined in.<ref name="PureGrainAudio">{{cite web|url=http://puregrainaudio.com/news/woe-is-me-signs-with-velocity-recordsrise-records-band-to-begin-recording-debut-this-month|title=WOE, IS ME Signs with Velocity Records/Rise Records; Band to Begin Recording Debut This Month|last=Gondafirst=Chris|work=PureGrainAudio.net}}</ref> 
These five members then recruited vocalists Michael Bohn and Tyler Carter respectively for unclean and clean vocal positions after Michael's and Tyler's departure from A Path Less Traveled, another local group. With this [[septet|seven-member lineup]], the band recorded a three-song demo with producer Cameron Mizell containing the songs "Hell, or High Water", "I" and "If Not, for Ourselves"<ref name="PureGrainAudio"/> which were released to their Myspace profile.
The group later recorded and released a cover of the [[Kesha]] song "[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]", also showcased online within a few months of being a band. Soon after these recordings were released, The Artery Foundation took notice of them. [[Rise Records]], along with their imprint label, [[Rise Records#Velocity Records|Velocity Records]], signed Woe, Is Me before even playing their first show.<ref>{{cite web|title=Woe, Is Me Cover Ke$ha, Sign to Velocity Records - SMNnews.com|url=http://www.smnnews.com/2010/04/12/woe-is-me-cover-keha-sign-to-velocity-records/|access-date=August 15, 2010|date=April 12, 2010}}</ref> They recorded their debut album, ''[[Numbers (Woe, Is Me album)|Number[s]]]'' during the same month that they were signed.

In an interview with radio station The Gunz Show, Carter stated that the band would be recording a [[music video]] for "[&] Delinquents" in September 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Woe, Is Me Radio Interview - The Gunz Show NY|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIAuOf2lQSA&feature=mfu_in_order&playnext=1&videos=yQrVGokw5rw|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=November 3, 2010|date=September 20, 2010}}</ref> The group embarked on a Canadian tour supporting Abandon All Ships from October 1, 2010 to the 28th of that month.

On August 10, 2011, clean vocalist, Tyler Carter left the band.

On September 15, 2011, Woe, Is Me announced via-video update their new singer, Hance Alligood. Alligood was once a part of a local Atlanta band, "[[Oh, Manhattan]]". Along with this update, the group also played various clips from a new single entitled, "Vengeance", which was released on September 27. On March 7, 2012, Michael Bohn and both Ferris brothers left the band due to personal, professional, and musical differences

"It came to a point where we could either continue on the path they saw fit, or we could create our own path and find happiness in our own ways," said Bohn and the Ferris brothers in a statement made shortly after their departure from the band.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Yancey|first=Bryne|title=Exclusive: Former members of Woe, Is Me release statement|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_former_members_of_woe_is_me_release_statement|magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref> They have since reconciled with former bandmate, Tyler Carter, and created a new band named [[Issues (band)|Issues]] with their friend, Case Snedecor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who's That Band: Issues|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/marshall-promotions/whos-that-band-issues-woe-is-me/385617671505972|access-date=July 28, 2012}}</ref>

On April 16, 2012, touring members Doriano Magliano (former vocalist for That's Outrageous!) and bassist Brian Medley officially announced they had joined Woe, Is Me. The band set to enter the studio throughout summer 2012 with a release set sometime later this year.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Woe, Is Me announce new vocalist|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/woe_is_me_announce_new_vocalist|magazine=Alternative Press}}</ref> On April 19, 2012, Woe, Is Me were announced as part of the "[[Scream It Like You Mean It]] 2012" tour (July–August 2012) alongside headliner [[Attack Attack!]] with [[We Came as Romans]], [[The Acacia Strain]], [[Oceano (band)|Oceano]], [[Like Moths to Flames]], [[Close to Home (band)|Close to Home]], [[Impending Doom (American band)|Impending Doom]], [[Abandon All Ships]], [[Secrets (post-hardcore band)|Secrets]], Volumes, [[For All Those Sleeping]], [[The Chariot (band)|The Chariot]], [[Glass Cloud]], At The Skylines, [[Texas in July]], [[In Fear and Faith]], and [[Hands Like Houses]].

===''American Dream'' EP and break-up (2013)===
On March 8, 2013 the band released a statement that they had parted ways with drummer and founding member Austin Thornton, due to personal differences. David Angle from At The Skylines was pulled in as his replacement. As of Thornton's departure, Kevin Hanson was the only original member in the band. With the release of the statement, the band also stated that they are planning on releasing a new single in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/woeis/posts/10151487359511797 |title=Woe, Is Me - After much deliberation, conversation, we... |publisher=Facebook |access-date=January 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Whitt|first=Cassie|title=Alternative Press - News - Woe, Is Me part ways with drummer and founding member, Austin Thornton|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/woe_is_e_part_ways_with_drummer_austin_thornton|magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=March 12, 2012}}</ref> On April 25, Woe, Is Me stated on their Facebook page that they will be tracking  their new music with Tom Denney. They plan to release it during the summer. A recent interview with the band and lead singer Hance in particular gave insight towards the feel of the new album that they are working on. "The singing/screaming ratio is more balanced, whereas Genesis had a lot more screaming and heavy parts. Doriano and I will share vocal responsibilities and have equal singing/screaming parts. Genesis had lots of breakdowns/chug parts, which don’t get me wrong, were cool. But, the heavy parts on this new stuff will be more riffy and more fun to move to. The choruses will still have the same pop feel to them as the ones from ''Genesi[s]''". 

On June 15, 2013, during the first show of Warped Tour, Woe, Is Me announced they would be releasing a new EP later in the year.  They later released a new song called "Stand Up," which was announced as the first single from the EP, titled ''[[American Dream (Woe, Is Me EP)|American Dream]]''. It is the first record to not have the Woe, Is Me symbol [s]. Before the new EP dropped, Andrew Paiano had an emergency forcing him to leave in late July and the group continued playing Warped Tour as a 5-piece.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZhD2BUWFA4|title=Woe Is Me at Warped Tour in August of 2013}}</ref>


While the band had a plan to record a third album,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/woeis/status/364521504358555648 |title=Twitter / woeis: So now that Warped is over |publisher=Twitter.com |date=August 5, 2013 |access-date=January 21, 2014}}</ref> [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] confirmed during September 2013 that the band had ended. Woe, Is Me included a personal post from vocalist Hance Alligood stating that he had "lost passion" for the genre and had decided to leave the band on good terms. As a result, the remaining members decided to disband instead of going through yet another line-up change.
