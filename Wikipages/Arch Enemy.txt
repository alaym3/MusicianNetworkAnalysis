'''Arch Enemy''' is a Swedish [[melodic death metal]] band, originally a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], from [[Halmstad]], formed in 1995. Its members were in bands such as [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], [[Armageddon (Swedish band)|Armageddon]], [[Carnage (band)|Carnage]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Spiritual Beggars]], [[The Agonist]], [[Nevermore]], and [[Eucharist (band)|Eucharist]]. It was founded by [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] guitarist [[Michael Amott]] along with [[Johan Liiva]], who were both originally from the [[death metal]] band [[Carnage (band)|Carnage]]. The band has released ten [[studio album]]s, three [[live album]]s, three [[video album]]s and four [[Extended play|EPs]]. The band was originally fronted by Johan Liiva, who was replaced by German vocalist [[Angela Gossow]] in 2000. Gossow left the band in March 2014 to become the group's manager and was replaced by Canadian vocalist [[Alissa White-Gluz]].

==History==

===Early years and ''Black Earth'' (1995–1997)===
Arch Enemy, the brainchild of [[Michael Amott]] ([[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], [[Carnage (band)|Carnage]], and [[Spiritual Beggars]]), was originally assembled when Amott left Carcass. He and his younger brother [[Christopher Amott|Christopher]] ([[Armageddon (Swedish band)|Armageddon]]) joined with vocalist [[Johan Liiva]] (ex-Carnage, Furbowl, Devourment) and session drummer [[Daniel Erlandsson]] ([[Eucharist (band)|Eucharist]]).

The band's debut, entitled ''[[Black Earth (Arch Enemy album)|Black Earth]]'', was recorded in [[Studio Fredman]] and released by the now defunct [[Regain Records|Wrong Again Records]] in 1996. It obtained a fair amount of success in [[Japan]], achieving MTV rotation with their first single "Bury Me an Angel", as well as moderate success in Sweden.

===''Stigmata'', ''Burning Bridges'', and Gossow (1998–2000)===
[[File:Arch Enemy (Erlandsson) 01.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Arch Enemy drummer Daniel Erlandsson]]
After the release of ''Black Earth'' the band switched labels, signing a contract with [[Century Media Records|Century Media]]. In 1998 Arch Enemy released ''[[Stigmata (Arch Enemy album)|Stigmata]]'', for which bassist Martin Bengtsson and drummer Peter Wildoer joined the band. The album gained a wider audience and popularity in [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]]. This was also the first Arch Enemy album to be released worldwide.

In 1999, [[Sharlee D'Angelo]] (ex-[[King Diamond]], ex-[[Mercyful Fate]]) assumed the role of Arch Enemy's bassist, and Daniel Erlandsson ([[Eucharist (band)|Eucharist]], ex-[[Carcass (band)|Carcass]]) was again recruited as the drummer. ''[[Burning Bridges (Arch Enemy album)|Burning Bridges]]'' was released, and was followed by the live album ''[[Burning Japan Live 1999]]''. During the touring-cycle for ''Burning Bridges'', D'Angelo was temporarily replaced twice; first by [[Dick Lövgren]] ([[Meshuggah]], ex-[[Armageddon (Swedish band)|Armageddon]]) and then by [[Roger Nilsson]] (ex-[[Spiritual Beggars]], [[Firebird (band)|Firebird]], [[The Quill (band)|the Quill]]).

In November 2000, vocalist Johan Liiva left and was replaced by German death metal vocalist [[Angela Gossow]].

===''Wages of Sin'' and ''Anthems of Rebellion'' (2001–2004)===
The first album with songs featuring Gossow was ''[[Wages of Sin]]'', released in 2001. In December of the same year, Arch Enemy took part in the "Japan's Beast Feast 2002" concert, playing alongside [[Slayer]] and [[Motörhead]].

''[[Anthems of Rebellion]]'' was released in 2003 and brought some innovations, such as the use of a second voice singing in harmony; such as in the "End of the Line" and "Dehumanization" tracks. In November of the following year, the band released the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Dead Eyes See No Future]]'', which featured live recordings, along with covers of [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] songs. In June 2004, the band embarked upon yet another Japan tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/arch-enemy-japanese-support-acts-announced/|title=ARCH ENEMY: Japanese Support Acts Announced |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=2004-06-05|access-date=2009-08-10}}</ref>

===''Doomsday Machine'' (2005–2006)===
In June 2005, Arch Enemy finished the recording for their sixth album, ''[[Doomsday Machine (album)|Doomsday Machine]]''. In July 2005, guitarist Christopher Amott left the band in order to focus on his personal life. He was temporarily replaced by guitarist [[Gus G.]] ([[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Firewind]]) and then by [[Fredrik Åkesson]] in September 2005. Christopher returned on a permanent basis in March 2007, shortly before the band entered the studio to begin recording their new album with producer Fredrik Nordström (who had previously worked with the band on their first four albums).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=69181 |title=Arch Enemy: Guitarist Christopher Amott Rejoins The Fold |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=2007-03-22 |access-date=2010-08-22}}</ref> Åkesson went on to become [[Opeth]]'s new lead guitarist in May 2007.
