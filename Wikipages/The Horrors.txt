==History==

===Origins (2005–2006)===
In the early 2000s, the Horrors coalesced around shared interests in obscure [[gramophone record|vinyl]] and DJing. During trips to London and on the Southend circuit, Webb met Badwan (formerly of the Rotters<ref>{{Cite web|title = Strange Fascination: Inside The Cult of The Horrors|url = http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/interviews/strange-fascination-inside-the-cult-of-the-horrors|access-date = 2015-06-20|date = 2 May 2014|website = theskinny.co.uk|last = Monroe|first = Jazz}}</ref>) and Furse through their mutual interest in 1960s [[garage rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] as well as [[post-punk]] bands such as [[The Birthday Party (band)|the Birthday Party]] and [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]].

In 2005, the three formed a band with Hayward and Spurgeon. The band was centred around Junkclub, an underground club founded by Webb and Oliver Abbott. Their first rehearsal consisted of two covers: [[the Sonics]]' "The Witch" and [[Screaming Lord Sutch]]'s "Jack the Ripper" (interpreted in the tradition of previous garage covers such as those by [[the Fuzztones]], One-Way Streets and [[the Gruesomes]]). The latter rendition was later rerecorded as the opening track of their debut album, ''[[Strange House]]''.<ref>Stool Pigeon magazine, April 2007.</ref> The Horrors made their first live performance at The Spread Eagle on Kingsland Road in London on 16 August 2005.

The Horrors drew the attention of critics and the public with their debut single, "[[Sheena Is a Parasite]]". Their second release, "[[Death at the Chapel]]", a high-profile [[concert|show]] at London's [[100 Club]] in July 2006, and an appearance on the cover of ''[[NME]]'' that August greatly increased their profile. The band played the [[NME Awards Indie Rock Tour]] in early 2007 along with [[Mumm-Ra (band)|Mumm-Ra]], [[The View (band)|the View]] and [[the Automatic]], which helped garner further fame.

===''Strange House'' (2007–2008)===
After the release of ''Strange House'' in March 2007, the Horrors embarked on an 18-month promotional world tour.<ref name=":0" /> A slot supporting [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]] in the United States in summer 2007 was cancelled because of lack of funds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://com2.runboard.com/bhorrors.f2.t10092|title=Forum &#124; Runboard|website=Com2.runboard.com}}</ref> but the band instead headlined a US tour that June. They made a number of festival appearances throughout 2007, including the [[Glastonbury Festival]], the [[Carling Weekend]] (on the [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]/[[NME]] stage), various Scandinavian festivals, the [[Summer Sonic Festival]] in Japan and [[Splendour in the Grass]] in Australia. Their setlists throughout that summer included a cover of "No Love Lost" by [[Joy Division]]. In December 2007, they featured in the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrows Parties]] festival curated by [[Geoff Barrow]] of [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].<ref name=":0" /> The Horrors also appeared in the third series of ''[[The Mighty Boosh (TV series)|The Mighty Boosh]]'' in December as the fictional band "the Black Tubes", and supported the [[Arctic Monkeys]] on their short sellout tour of the UK, receiving a mixed reception. The band played an [[NME Awards]] show in 2008 with [[Crystal Castles (band)|Crystal Castles]], Ulterior and [[These New Puritans]], and supported the Sonics on 23 March. Another London show followed at Bethnal Green's [[Rich Mix Cultural Foundation]] on 23 May of the following year. On 18 January 2008, ''Counting in Fives'', a documentary of the band's 2007 US tour, was unveiled at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6lhuw1LoCA|title=THE HORRORS + COUNTING IN FIVES|last=NYLON Video|date=11 January 2008|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

Eventually, ''Strange House'' reached No. 37 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Following the "[[She Is the New Thing]]" single release in June 2007, the band recorded a cover of [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]]'s "Shadazz" for [[Blast First|Blast First Petite]] as part of their tribute to [[Alan Vega]] in October 2008, their only release before their new material in 2009.

===''Primary Colours'' (2009–2010)===
At the end of 2007, the Horrors announced the forthcoming recording of a new album, which was produced by the band, Craig Silvey, Barrow and music video director [[Chris Cunningham]].<ref name="DiS Horrors">{{cite web|url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/3876525|title=The Horrors: Fantasy Faris and Portishead-related new album info|publisher=[[Drowned in Sound]]|access-date=10 September 2008|archive-date=10 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910072535/http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/3876525|url-status=dead}}</ref> Recording took place in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] during the summer of 2008. Barrow's influence brought the use of keyboards and electronics. The band were forced to pull out of their planned appearance at the [[Underage Festival]] due to recording schedule conflicts. After they left [[Loog Records]] in 2007, the band signed to [[XL Recordings]].

A number of songs from the new album were leaked a few weeks before the album's release. The album's first single, "[[Sea Within a Sea]]", was released only as a [[music download|digital download]] on 17 March 2009, together with a music video directed by [[Douglas Hart]] which was posted on the band's website on the same day. Their second album, ''[[Primary Colours (The Horrors album)|Primary Colours]]'', was officially released on 4 May 2009 to critical acclaim, and reached No.&nbsp;25 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = The Horrors Interview|url = http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/the-horrors-interview|date = 13 May 2009|website = clashmusic.com|publisher = Clash Magazine|first = Mike|last = Diver}}</ref> The single "[[Who Can Say]]" was released on 7" vinyl one week later.

''Primary Colours'' was nominated for the 2009 [[Mercury Prize]]. ''NME'' later awarded the album first place in the 50 Best Albums of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/list/50-best-albums-of-2009/159978/page/5 |title=50 Best Albums of 2009 |work=NME|access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref> After headlining London's [[Offset Festival]] and touring for ''Primary Colours'', the Horrors indicated a desire to build their own studio to record at obscure hours.

===''Skying'' (2011–2012)===
In April 2010, singer Badwan announced on the band's official forum that the Horrors had already started working on their third album, to be called ''[[Skying]]'', and had been in the studio for some months. A track from the album, "Endless Blue", was first unveiled at the [[Latitude Festival]] in July 2010, and later performed at Poland's [[Off Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUg_H__LGto |title=The Horrors – Endless Blue (NEW SONG!!!) @ Lokerse Feesten 07-08-2010 |publisher=YouTube |date=11 August 2010 |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref> and Belgium's Lokerse Feesten in August 2010. In February 2011, after rumours that the album had been delayed, Badwan announced via the official forum that the album would be released in July. The first single, "[[Still Life (The Horrors song)|Still Life]]", premiered on 24 May on Zane Lowe's [[BBC Radio 1]] show.
