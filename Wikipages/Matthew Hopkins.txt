'''Matthew Hopkins''' ({{circa}}&nbsp;1620&nbsp;– 12 August 1647) was an English [[witch-hunt]]er whose career flourished during the [[English Civil War]]. He claimed to hold the office of Witchfinder General, although that title was never bestowed by [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. His activities mainly took place in [[East Anglia]].<ref name="Robbins">{{cite book |author=Rossell Hope Robbins |chapter=Hopkins, Matthew|title=The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology |publisher=New York Crown Publishers|year=1959 |ref=ASIN:B0006AW066|quote=After Essex, he turned to Norfolk and Suffolk. By the next year, he had extended his operations with a team of six - himself, John Stearne, and four prickers - to the counties of Cambridge, Northampton, Huntingdon, and Bedford. He had become indeed the Witch Finder General.}}</ref>

Hopkins' witch-finding career began in March 1644{{efn|At this time the New Year did not occur until 25&nbsp;[[New Year's Day#History|March]]; all [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style Date]]s have been rendered as [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]], with the year beginning on 1&nbsp;January}} and lasted until his retirement in 1647. He and his associates were responsible for more people being [[hanging|hanged]] for [[witchcraft]] than in the previous 100&nbsp;years,<ref>[[#history of witchcraft|Russell 1981]]: pp. 97–98</ref><ref>[[#Magic|Thomas 1971]]: p. 537, ... in Essex there were no executions after 1626 until 1645.</ref> and were solely responsible for the increase in witch trials during those years.<ref>[[#Witchfindergeneral|Deacon 1976]]: p. 41</ref><ref>[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 164</ref><ref>[[#Magic|Thomas 1971]]: p. 528</ref> He is believed to have been responsible for the executions of over 100 alleged witches between the years 1644 and 1646.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharpe|2002|p=3}}</ref> 

It has been estimated that all of the English witch trials between the early 15th and late 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500&nbsp;executions for witchcraft.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Therefore, presuming the number executed as a result of investigations by Hopkins and his colleague [[John Stearne (witch-hunter)|John Stearne]] is at the lower end of the estimates,<ref>[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 194, quoting Stearne who "boasted that he knew of  200"</ref><ref>[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 195, quoting [[James Howell]] [[Epistolae Ho-Elianae|''Familiar Letters'']], II 551, dates February 3, 1646/7 of "near 300"</ref><ref>[[#Magic|Thomas 1971]]: pp. 544, 537,"...when the campaign of Matthew Hopkins and his associates resulted in the execution of several hundred witches..."</ref> their efforts accounted for about 20% of the total. In the 14&nbsp;months of their crusade Hopkins and Stearne sent to the [[gallows]] more accused people than all the other witch-hunters in England of the previous 160 years.<ref>[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 195</ref>

==Early life==
Little is known of Matthew Hopkins before 1644, and there are no surviving contemporary documents concerning him or his family.<ref>
[[#biography|Cabell 2006]]: p. 9; it is the author's opinion that "unfortunately one cannot dispute that all Hopkins documentation was deliberately destroyed after his death".
</ref> He was born in [[Wenham Magna|Great Wenham]], Suffolk<ref name="Gas9">[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 9
</ref><ref name="Dea13">
[[#Witchfindergeneral|Deacon 1976]]: p. 13
</ref><ref name=dnb /> and was the fourth son<ref name="Gas9"/> of six children.<ref>[[#Witchfindergeneral|Deacon 1976]]: pp. 15–17</ref> His father, James Hopkins, was a Puritan [[clergy]]man and  [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]] of  St John's of Great Wenham, in Suffolk.<ref name=dnb /><ref>[[#Witchfindergeneral|Deacon 1976]]: pp. 13, 17</ref> The family at one point held title "to lands and tenements in [[Framlingham Castle|Framlingham]] 'at the castle{{'"}}.<ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 23; [[#Witchfindergeneral|Deacon 1976]]: p. 17; quoting James Hopkins' last will and testament</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.witchtrials.co.uk/matthew.html|title=Matthew Hopkins – Witch–finder General|last=Knowles|first=George|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305051928/http://witchtrials.co.uk/matthew.html|archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> His father was popular with his parishioners, one of whom in 1619 left money to purchase Bibles for his then three children James, John and Thomas.<ref name="Dea13"/> 

Thus Matthew Hopkins could not have been born before 1619, and could not have been older than 28 when he died, but he may have been as young as 25.<ref>
[[#biography|Cabell 2006]]: p. 6</ref> Although James Hopkins had died in 1634,<ref name="Dea13"/>  when the iconoclast [[William Dowsing]], commissioned in 1643 by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]]  [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]]<ref>[[#biography|Cabell 2006]]: p. 19</ref> "for the destruction of monuments of idolatry and superstition", visited the [[parish]] in 1645 he noted that "there was nothing to reform".<ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 13</ref> Hopkins' brother John became [[Minister (Christianity)|Minister]] of [[South Fambridge]] in 1645 but was removed from the post one year later for neglecting his work.<ref>[[#Witchfindergeneral|Deacon 1976]]: p. 14</ref> Hopkins states in his book ''The Discovery of Witches'' (1647)<ref name="Discovery">The Discovery of Witches – In Answer to Several Queries, Lately Delivered to the Judges of Assize for the County of Norfolk; London; 1647</ref> that he "never travelled far&nbsp;... to gain his experience".<ref>[[#biography|Cabell 2006]]: p. 15</ref>

In the early 1640s, Hopkins moved to [[Manningtree]], Essex, a town on the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]], about {{convert|10|mi}} from Wenham. According to tradition, Hopkins used his recently acquired inheritance of a hundred [[Mark (money)#England and Scotland|marks]]<ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 23</ref> to establish himself as a [[gentleman]] and to buy the Thorn Inn in [[Mistley]].<ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 27</ref> From the way that he presented evidence in trials, Hopkins is commonly thought to have been trained as a [[lawyer]], but there is scant evidence to suggest this was the case.<ref>[[#Witchfindergeneral|Deacon 1976]]: pp. 58–59</ref>

[[File:Matthewhopkins.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Frontispiece from Matthew Hopkins' ''The Discovery of Witches'' (1647), showing [[witches]] identifying their [[familiar spirit]]s]]
Following the Lancaster Witch Trials (1612–1634), [[William Harvey]], physician to King [[Charles I of England]], had been ordered to examine the four women accused,<ref>{{cite web |title=Witchcraft Trials|url= http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Witchcraft_Trials|publisher=The National Archives|access-date= 22 February 2018|quote=SP 16/269 –  SP16/271}}</ref> and from this there came a requirement to have material proof of being a witch.<ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: pp. 46–47</ref> The work of Hopkins and [[John Stearne (witch-hunter)|John Stearne]] was not necessarily to prove any of the accused had committed acts of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]], but to prove that they had made a covenant with the [[Devil]].<ref>[[#Magic|Thomas 1971]]: p 543; [[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p 47</ref> Prior to this point, any malicious acts on the part of witches were treated identically to those of other criminals, until it was seen that, according to the then-current beliefs about the structure of witchcraft, they owed their powers to a deliberate act of their choosing.<ref>[[#Magic|Thomas 1971]]: pp. 521, 542–543</ref> 

Witches then became heretics to Christianity, which became the greatest of their crimes and sins.<ref>[[#Magic|Thomas 1971]]: pp. 542–543</ref> Within continental and Roman Law witchcraft was ''crimen exceptum'': a crime so foul that all normal legal procedures were superseded. Because the Devil was not going to "confess", it was necessary to gain a confession from the human involved.<ref>[[#Demonology|Robbins 1959]]: p. 498</ref>

The witch-hunts undertaken by Stearne and Hopkins mainly took place in [[East Anglia]], in the counties of [[Suffolk]], [[Essex, England|Essex]], [[Norfolk]], [[Cambridgeshire]] and [[Huntingdonshire]], with a few in the counties of [[Northamptonshire]] and [[Bedfordshire]].<ref name="Robbins" /> They extended throughout the area of strongest Puritan and Parliamentarian influences which formed the powerful and influential [[Eastern Association]] from 1644 to 1647, which was centred on Essex.<ref>[[#Witchfindergeneral |Deacon 1976]]: p. 39</ref><ref>[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 197</ref> Both Hopkins and Stearne would have required some form of letters of safe conduct<ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 79</ref><ref>[[#biography|Cabell 2006]]: p. 46</ref> to be able to travel throughout the counties.<ref>[[#Witchfindergeneral|Deacon 1976]]: pp. 70–71 Deacon proposing that Hopkins knew [[John Thurloe]] future spy master for [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], who facilitated any travelling. See also .[[#biography|Cabell 2006]]: p33</ref>

According to his book ''The Discovery of Witches'',<ref name="Discovery"/> Hopkins began his career as a witch-finder after he overheard women discussing their meetings with the Devil in March 1644 in [[Manningtree]]. In fact, the first accusations were made by Stearne,   and Hopkins was appointed as his assistant. Twenty-three women were accused of witchcraft and were tried at [[Chelmsford]] in 1645. With the [[English Civil War]] under way, this trial was conducted not by [[Assizes (England and Wales)|justices of assize]], but by [[justices of the peace]] presided over by the [[Earl of Warwick#1618 creation|Earl of Warwick]].<ref name="Thomas 1971: p. 545">[[#Magic|Thomas 1971]]: p. 545</ref> Four died in prison and nineteen were convicted and hanged. During this period, excepting [[Middlesex]] and [[Municipal corporation#United Kingdom|chartered towns]], no records show any person charged of witchcraft being sentenced to death other than by the judges of the assizes.<ref>[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 201</ref>

Hopkins and Stearne, accompanied by the women who performed the [[pricking]], were soon travelling over eastern England, claiming to be officially commissioned by [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to uncover and prosecute witches. Together with their female assistants, they were well paid for their work, and it has been suggested that this was a motivation for his actions.<ref>[[#history of witchcraft|Russell 1981]]: p98</ref> Hopkins states<ref name="Discovery"/> that "his fees were to maintain his company with three horses",<ref>[[#biography|Cabell 2006]]: p36</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 193</ref> and that he took "twenty [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] a town".<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The records at [[Stowmarket]] show their costs to the town to have been £23 (£{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|23|1646|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) plus his travelling expenses.<ref>[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p183 & p193; quoting A.G. Hollingsworth, ''History of Stowmarket'' (Ipswich 1844)</ref> 

The cost to the local community of Hopkins and his company were such that, in 1645, a special local tax rate had to be levied in [[Ipswich]].<ref>[[#Magic|Thomas 1971]]: p544, quoting Ipswich and East Suffolk R.O. Quarterly Sessions Order Book, 1639 – 57, and Memorials of Old Suffolk, ed V.B.Redstone(1908).</ref> Parliament was well aware of Hopkins and his team's activities, as shown by the concerned reports of the [[Bury St. Edmunds witch trials|Bury St Edmunds witch trials of 1645]]. Before the trial, a report was carried to the Parliament{{spaced ndash}}"as if some busie men had made use of some ill Arts to extort such confession"<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 178</ref>{{spaced ndash}}that a special [[Oyer and terminer|Commission of Oyer and Terminer]] was granted for the trial of these witches.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> After the trial and execution the [[Gilbert Mabbot|''Moderate Intelligencer'']], a parliamentary paper published during the English Civil War, in an editorial of 4–11 September 1645 expressed unease with the affairs in Bury.

===Methods of investigation===
Methods of investigating witchcraft heavily drew inspiration from the ''[[Daemonologie]]'' of [[King James VI and I|King James]], which was directly cited in Hopkins' ''The Discovery of Witches''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hopkins|first1=Matthew|title=The Discovery of Witches|date=1647|location=Query 10}}</ref> Although [[torture]] was nominally unlawful in England, Hopkins often used techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] to extract confessions from his victims.<ref>[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 167; three days and nights of "watching" brought Elizabeth Clarke to "confess many things";</ref> He would also cut the arm of the accused with a blunt knife, and if she did not bleed, she was said to be a witch. Another of his methods was the [[Dunking|swimming test]], based on the idea that as witches had renounced their [[baptism]], water would reject them. Suspects were tied to a chair and thrown into water: all those who "swam" (floated) were considered to be witches. Hopkins was warned against the use of "swimming" without receiving the victim's permission first.<ref name="Cabell 2006: p. 22">[[#biography|Cabell 2006]]: p. 22</ref> This led to the legal abandonment of the test by the end of 1645.<ref name="Cabell 2006: p. 22"/> 

Hopkins and his assistants also looked for the [[Witches' mark|Devil's mark]]. This was a mark that all witches or [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] were thought to possess that was said to be dead to all feeling and would not bleed – although it was sometimes a [[Nevus|mole]], birthmark or an [[Supernumerary nipple|extra nipple]] or [[Accessory breast|breast]].<ref>[[#Demonology|Robbins 1959]]: p. 552</ref> If the suspected witch had no such visible marks invisible ones could be discovered by pricking. Therefore, "witch prickers" were employed, who [[pricking|pricked]] the accused with knives and special needles looking for such marks, normally after the suspect had been shaved of all body hair.<ref>[[#Demonology|Robbins 1959]]: p. 398</ref><ref>[[#Demonology|Robbins 1959]]: p. 469; ...justification for shaving applied especially, but not exclusively, in England"</ref> It was believed that the witch's [[familiar spirit|familiar]], an animal such as a cat or dog, would drink the witch's blood from the mark, as a baby drinks milk from the nipple.

===Opposition===
Hopkins and his company ran into opposition very soon after the start of their work,<ref name="Thomas 1971: p. 545"/> but one of his main antagonists was [[John Gaule]], vicar of [[Great Staughton]] in [[Huntingdonshire]].<ref name="ReferenceC">[[#Witchcraft|Notestein 1911]]: p. 187</ref><ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: pp. 219–220</ref> Gaule had attended a woman from [[St Neots]] who was held in gaol charged with witchcraft until such time as Hopkins could attend. Upon hearing that the woman had been interviewed, Hopkins wrote a letter<ref name="ReferenceC"/><ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 220</ref> to a contact asking whether he would be given a "good welcome". Gaule hearing of this letter wrote his publication ''Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and Witchcrafts'';  London, (1646)<ref>{{cite web|last=Gaule|first=John |title= Select Cases of Conscience Touching Witches and Witchcraft|url=https://archive.org/details/JohnGauleSermonOnWitches}}</ref>{{spaced ndash}}dedicated to [[Valentine Walton|Colonel Walton of the House of Commons]]<ref name="ReferenceC"/>{{spaced ndash}}and began a programme of Sunday sermons to suppress witch-hunting.<ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 220</ref> 

In Norfolk both Hopkins and Stearne were questioned by justices of the assizes about the torturing and fees.<ref>[[#Demonology|Robbins 1959]]: p. 252</ref> Hopkins was asked if methods of investigation did not make the finders themselves witches, and if with all his knowledge did he not also have a secret,<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Gaskill238">[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 238</ref> or had used "unlawful courses of torture".<ref name="Gaskill238"/> By the time this court session resumed in 1647 Stearne and Hopkins had retired, Hopkins to [[Manningtree]] and Stearne to [[Bury St Edmunds]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Gaskill238"/><ref>[[#Demonology|Robbins 1959]]: p. 253</ref>

===Colonial impact===
Hopkins' witch-hunting methods were outlined in his book ''The Discovery of Witches,'' which was published in 1647.  These practices were recommended in law books.<ref name= Jewett>Jewett, Clarence F. The memorial history of Boston: including Suffolk County, Massachusetts. 1630–1880. Ticknor and Company. 1881 Pgs. 133–137</ref> During the year following the publication of Hopkins' book, trials and executions for witchcraft began in the [[New England]] colonies with the hanging of [[Alse Young]] of Windsor, Connecticut on May 26, 1647, followed by the conviction of [[Margaret Jones (Puritan midwife)|Margaret Jones]].  As described in the journal of Governor [[John Winthrop]], the evidence assembled against Margaret Jones was gathered by the use of Hopkins' techniques of "searching" and "watching".<ref name= Jewett /> 

Jones' execution was the first in a [[witch-hunt]] that lasted in New England from 1648 until 1663.<ref name=Fraden>Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. Pg. 15</ref>  About eighty people throughout New England were accused of practising witchcraft during that period, of whom fifteen women and two men were executed.<ref name=Fraden /> Some of Hopkins' methods were once again employed during the [[Salem Witch Trials]],<ref name="Upham">{{cite book|last=Upham|first=Caroline|title=Salem Witchcraft in Outline|url=https://archive.org/details/salemwitchcraft08uphagoog|year=1895|publisher=E. Putnam|pages=[https://archive.org/details/salemwitchcraft08uphagoog/page/n22 5]}}</ref> which occurred primarily in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], Massachusetts in 1692–93. These trials resulted in 19 executions for witchcraft,<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/essex/ecca/vol1/071.html The Death Warrant of Bridget Bishop]</ref><ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/archives/BPL/B05A.html Death Warrant for Sarah Good, Rebecca Nurse, Susannah Martin, Elizabeth How & Sarah Wilds],</ref> one man, [[Giles Corey]], [[Crushing (execution)|pressed to death]] [[peine forte et dure|for refusing to plead]],<ref>[[#Salemvillage|Boyer & Nissenbaum 1972]]: p. 8</ref> and 150 imprisonments.

==Death and legacy==
{{See also|Matthew Hopkins in popular culture}}
Matthew Hopkins died at his home in [[Manningtree]], Essex, on 12&nbsp;August 1647, probably of pleural [[tuberculosis]]. He was buried a few hours after his death in the graveyard of the Church of St Mary at [[Mistley|Mistley Heath]].<ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]:p. 263</ref> In the words of historian Malcolm Gaskill, Matthew Hopkins "lives on as an anti-hero and bogeyman&nbsp;– utterly ethereal, endlessly malleable".<ref>[[#Witchfinders|Gaskill 2005]]: p. 283</ref>  According to historian [[Rush Rhees Library#Rossell Hope Robbins Library|Rossell Hope Robbins]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Rossell Hope Robbins|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/217605.Rossell_Hope_Robbins|website=Rossell Hope Robbins|publisher=Good Reads|access-date=28 February 2016}}</ref> Hopkins "acquired an evil reputation which in later days made his name synonymous with fingerman or [[Common Informers Act 1951|informer]] paid by authorities to commit perjury".<ref>[[#Demonology|Robbins 1959]]: p. 248</ref>

What historian James Sharpe has characterised as a "pleasing legend" grew up around the circumstances of Hopkins' death, according to which he was subjected to his own swimming test and executed as a witch, but the parish registry at Mistley confirms his burial there.<ref name=dnb>{{citation |last=Sharpe |first=James |contribution=Hopkins, Matthew (d. 1647) |title=Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13751 |format={{ODNBsub}} |access-date=18 October 2009}}</ref>
