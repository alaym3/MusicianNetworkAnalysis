In 2013, Meighan began a project with rapper Wottee Watnot (Andrew Wattie) called Mic Rockers, described as "a hip hop/rock collaboration". The first video from the duo, "Mic Rockers", was released on 13 November 2013.

He also added that he had recorded several songs that were "ready to share."<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nme.com/news/music/tom-meighan-shares-teaser-of-solo-track-would-you-mind-music-is-my-therapy-3070422|title=Tom Meighan shares teaser of solo track 'Would You Mind': "Music is my therapy"|work=NME|date=14 October 2021|accessdate=14 October 2021}}</ref> On 31 October 2021, "Would You Mind" was released as Meighan's debut solo single.

==Media image==
Meighan earned a reputation for media provocation early in Kasabian's career, especially concerning other musicians. He became well-known for his insults, such as calling [[Julian Casablancas]] "a posh fucking skier", [[Pete Doherty]] "a fucking tramp" and [[Justin Timberlake]] "a midget with whiskers".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.thefashionspot.com/f63/brit-rockers-attack-timberlake-midget-whiskers-48057.html |title=Brit Rockers Attack Timberlake: 'a Midget With Whiskers'... – the Fashion Spot |publisher=Forums.thefashionspot.com |access-date=11 December 2011}}</ref> Regarding the depressing nature of [[emo music]] and its listeners, he was quoted remarking that "Teenagers are better than that. I want to tell them to be positive about life. You've been brought up well by your parents, so don't sit around in your bedroom cutting your wrists. Grow up."<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1541950/20060928/index.jhtml?headlines=true&rsspartner=rssBloglines Kasabian Singer On Emo: 'All It Causes Is Moaning Teenagers'] – MTV.com</ref>

Meighan also offered more serious critiques of the effects of the Internet upon the music industry,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/kasabian/49853 |title=Kasabian's Tom Meighan: 'The internet has killed rock stars' &#124; News |work=NME |date=20 February 2010 |access-date=11 December 2011}}</ref> and was one of a number of celebrities to criticize [[Simon Cowell]]'s handling of [[Susan Boyle]], stating, "It will torture her for the rest of life. She is not ready for it and she is not made for it. She is being manipulated. It's horrible."<ref name="DRecord">"The hex factor", ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'', 25 November 2009, p. 145</ref>

As of 2009, Meighan was making an attempt to tone down his controversial image. In an interview with the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'', he said, "When we released the first album, it didn't help in interviews that we slagged everyone off. We were only messing about, we were having fun but everyone took it a little too seriously…We did it for effect but we were portrayed as monsters instead of just a bunch of lads in a band. They got us so wrong. I don't regret anything we said but it was ridiculous."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2009/11/25/kasabian-frontman-tom-meighan-hits-out-over-x-factor-simon-cowell-and-susan-boyle-86908-21849009/ |title=Kasabian frontman Tom Meighan hits out over X Factor, Simon Cowell and Susan Boyle |work=Daily Record |access-date=11 December 2011}}</ref>

Meighan has supported numerous charities including [[Oxfam]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/845566-kasabians-tom-meighan-donates-designer-gear-to-oxfam |title=Kasabian star Tom Meighan donates designer clothes to Oxfam |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=29 October 2010 |access-date=2 January 2012}}</ref> [[UNICEF]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/kasabian/53108 |title=Kasabian's Tom Meighan records new song with Leicester band for charity |work=NME |date=22 September 2010 |access-date=11 December 2011}}</ref> and the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]].

==Personal life==
Meighan has a daughter, Mimi Malone Meighan, with his former girlfriend Kim James. The couple split in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tom Meighan Opens Up About Split From Partner & Death Of "Great Friend" |url=http://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/kasabian/news/tom-meighan-split-from-long-term-partner-death/ |publisher=[[Radio X (United Kingdom)|Radio X]] |access-date=23 April 2017}}</ref>

On July 7, 2020, less than 24 hours after his departure from Kasabian was announced, Meighan pleaded guilty to assaulting his fiancée Vikki Ager. At the time of the trial, prosecutor Naeem Valli said the "sustained assault" had left Ager with bruises on her knees, elbow, and ankle, as well as red marks around her neck. The court was told that Meighan "smelt heavily of intoxicants" as he assaulted Ager. He was ordered to 200 hours of community service.<ref name="Halliday"/>

The following day, Meighan issued a public apology. "I would like to make a statement about recent events and publicly apologise to my partner Vikki, my bandmates, my friends, family and fans. I am very sorry and deeply regret my recent behaviour. In no way am I trying to condone my actions or make excuses. I am completely to blame and accept my responsibility." Meighan said he has been struggling with an alcohol addiction and was diagnosed with ADHD, commenting: "The incident in April was a wake-up call for me, for who I was, and what I was becoming. I was spiralling out of control. My mental health was becoming more and more unstable and I was at breaking point."

Meighan said he left rehab three weeks prior and was intent on staying sober. He added his ADHD diagnosis does not excuse his behaviour, but it has helped him to understand more about his "behavioural issues". The musician concluded the post by assuring his fans the assault was an isolated incident, adding: "Vikki and I are still very much in love and we are looking forward to rebuilding our life together with the support of those close to us."<ref>{{cite news |last=Harrison |first=Ellie |date=2020-07-07 |title=Tom Meighan: Former Kasabian frontman issues statement after domestic violence conviction|work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/tom-meighan-statement-domestic-violence-abuse-kasabian-vikki-ager-a9608861.html  |access-date=2020-08-07 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
