'''Israel Vibration''' are a [[reggae]] harmony group, originating from [[Kingston, Jamaica]].  Lascelle "Wiss" Bulgin, Albert "Apple Gabriel" Craig, and Cecil "Skelly" Spence all suffered from childhood [[polio]], and went on to be a [[Jamaica]]n [[roots reggae]] group in the 1970s. The trio initially met as children at a rehabilitation center.

==History==
Bulgin (born 1955), Craig (1955–2020), and Spence (born 1952) first met as children at the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic, all sufferers of polio in the epidemic that spread through Jamaica in the 1950s. Several years later that they formed Israel Vibration.<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2002) ''Reggae & Caribbean Music'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}, p. 133-135</ref><ref name="Brown">Brown, Joe (1991) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20140611025828/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1048499.html Reggae Culture Has Vibrations]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 8 February 1991, retrieved 16 September 2012 {{HighBeam}}</ref><ref name="Block">Block, Melissa & Siegel, Robert (2004) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20140611025809/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-103235913.html Interview: Gary Himmelfarb discusses a reggae adaptation of some of Bob Dylan's songs]", [[NPR]], 27 August 2004, retrieved 16 September 2012 {{HighBeam}}</ref> Craig attended the [[Alpha Boys School]] but ran away at the age of fourteen, living on the streets.<ref name="Thompson" /> Spence was a member of the band Hot Lickers, appearing on Jamaican television with the group at the age of twelve.<ref name="Thompson" /> He also played in the Jamaican [[wheelchair basketball]] team but was forced out in 1969 after adopting the [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] faith, something which the three had in common when they were later reunited.<ref name="Thompson" /> 

Spence and Craig got together in Kingston and sought out Bulgin, who at the time was working as a tailor.<ref name="Thompson" /> They formed a vocal group, initially adopting the name Israel Vibration Israel Vibrates, soon becoming simply Israel Vibration.<ref name="Thompson" /> They survived on money earned singing in the streets for several years, and in 1975 attempted to launch a recording career at [[Channel One Studios]], but the track they recorded there ("Bad Intention") was not released.<ref name="Thompson" />

Funding for their first album came in the form of a grant from the [[Mansions of Rastafari#Twelve Tribes of Israel|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] branch of Rastafarai after Hugh Booth, a member of the Twelve Tribes, had overheard the three men singing in a wooded area outside Kingston. Apple and Wiss were living in the area, which they had converted into a home. Recorded at the [[Treasure Isle]] studio in 1976, their debut release was the single "Why Worry", released on the Twelve Tribes label late that year.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Barrow">Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) ''The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn.'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-329-4}}, p. 204</ref> The single was successful enough for the group to be offered support slots at shows by artists such as [[Dennis Brown]], [[Inner Circle (band)|Inner Circle]], and [[Bob Marley]].<ref name="Thompson" />

They then began working with producer [[Tommy Cowan]], releasing "The Same Song" (on which they were backed by members of Inner Circle) on his Top Ranking label in 1977, and an album of the same name followed in 1978.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Barrow2">Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (1999) ''Reggae – 100 Essential CDs: The Rough Guide'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-85828-567-4}}, p. 83-4</ref> The album, and its [[Dub music|dub]] counterpart, ''Israel Tafari'' (aka ''Same Song Dub'') were a success internationally, leading to a deal with [[EMI]] label [[Harvest Records|Harvest]] to reissue the album in the UK, the label also releasing a second album, ''Unconquered People'' in 1980.<ref name="Thompson" />

For their third album, ''Why You So Craven'' (the title track aimed at their former producer Cowan), they worked with [[Henry "Junjo" Lawes]] but disagreements meant that they left the album unfinished, with Lawes getting [[The Tamlins]] to complete it.<ref name="Thompson" />

The group relocated to New York in 1982 to seek professional health care, and escape the growing [[dancehall]] movement in Jamaica, but struggled to break through there and they split up.<ref name="Thompson" /><ref name="Brown" /><ref name="Miller">Miller, Mark R.

''Strength of my Life'' was the group's fourth album.<ref name="Thompson" /> The band stayed with RAS into the 21st century, releasing more than a dozen albums for the label.<ref name="Thompson" />
