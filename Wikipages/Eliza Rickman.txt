'''Eliza Rickman''' is an American [[independent music|indie]] singer, songwriter, and pianist from Los Angeles, California. She is best known for her use of unconventional musical instruments, such as the [[toy piano]], and her vintage Victorian Era dresses, as well as her collaborations with the podcast [[Welcome to Night Vale]] and musician [[Jason Webley]].

==Early life==
Eliza Rickman was born on August 17, 1983, in [[Okinawa, Japan]]. Her father was in the military, and then became a [[Baptist]] preacher,<ref name="Zine">Victoria Chiu.

Rickman attended the College of Music and the Arts at the Evangelical University [[Azusa Pacific University]] in Los Angeles, California, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in music and orchestration,<ref name="Zine"/> with her primary focus on piano performance.<ref name="RedFence"/> Her original intention was to be a concert pianist, and she had never previously considered a career as a singer-songwriter.<ref name="Filk">'' Filk''.

Through this class a professor encouraged her to continue singing.<ref name="RedFence"/>

==Career==
The lineup of her first band consisted of musicians she met through Azusa Pacific University, some of whom she met while attending college there, while others she met after graduation. Alex Russell, the violinist and professor at Azusa Pacific, started playing for Rickman after she graduated.<ref name="RedFence"/> After graduating, she began booking shows at various small venues, but found she attracted more of an audience in her street performances.<ref name="Zine"/> In 2009, she recorded her first [[Extended play|EP]], entitled ''Gild the Lily'', which was recorded by one of Rickman's frequent collaborators, [[Robert DeLong]], on his laptop in a haunted chapel.<ref name="Parx">''Parx-E Web Zine'', "[http://parx-e.com/eliza-rickman-interview/  Eliza Rickman Interview]. February 29, 2012. Retrieved October 8, 2017.</ref> ''Gild the Lily'' was released on March 7, 2009.

She primarily stayed and performed in Los Angeles, due to its prominence as a primary music scene. Owing to demands from fans, she sought to record and release a number of songs she had written and performed on a full-length [[Long Play|LP]]. According to Rickman, she went through her favorite CDs and made a list of the engineers and producers and began contacting them. Since [[Andrew Bird]] is among her favorite artists, his engineer Mark Greenberg was on the top of her list. Greenberg expressed interest in recording Rickman and her band. The majority of her first full-length album, entitled ''O, You Sinners'', was recorded in December 2011 and January 2012 in The Mayfair Recordings studio and JoyRide Studio of Mark Greenberg in Chicago, Illinois<ref name="AudioPerv">Ace Ubas.

Following this, Rickman grew disheartened from not being able to secure industry attention, and after recording ''O, You Sinners'' in Chicago, she decided to "uproot" herself and begin a nomadic stage of her career. She gave up her home in Los Angeles, and even her beloved cat into the care of friends,<ref name="FAQ"/> to tour and perform at any venue she could secure, including house concerts, to build up a fan base.<ref name="Zine"/> After six years of following this lifestyle, she has returned to Los Angeles and is working on touring more effectively.<ref name="Mooky">''MookyChick'', "[http://www.mookychick.co.uk/reviews/music/eliza-rickman-interview.php  Eliza Rickman – Talking Truth and Beauty]".

In 2014, Eliza Rickman was invited to tour with [[Welcome to Night Vale]] to perform as the opening act and during ″the weather″ portion of their live shows. She performed "Cinnamon Bone" for ''The Librarian'' tour (2014), and "Maker of My Sorrow"<ref>''[https://nightvale.bandcamp.com/album/the-investigators-live  Welcome to Night Vale – The Investigators] ''. Retrieved October 8, 2017</ref> for ''The Investigators'' tour (2015). She also performed for ″the weather″ in the ''Ghost Stories'' tour (2016) and in the first half of the U.S. portion of the ''All Hail'' tour (2017). On April 15, 2015, Rickman had her song "Pretty Little Head" featured as ″the weather″ on Welcome to Night Vale Episode 45 – "A Story About Them".

Also in 2014, Rickman was invited by [[Jason Webley]], a longtime friend of hers,<ref name="Mooky"/> to participate in a collaborative project called ''[[Margaret (album)|Margaret]]'' (2014). Webley had grown interested in an unknown, nearly forgotten woman named Margaret Rucker, who was from his hometown of [[Everett, Washington]], and who wrote poetry and lived a tragic life. He asked Rickman, [[Jherek Bischoff]], [[Parenthetical Girls|Zac Pennington]], and several others to each write and record two songs about Margaret.<ref>Jason Webley. ''Margaret'', "Once Upon a Pyramid". Eleven Records. 2014. Page 76-79.</ref> Webley had chosen Rickman in particular due to her love of time-worn things, such as the scrapbook of Margaret Rucker that was found in the bottom of a dumpster by [[Chicken John]] Rinaldi. Part of the arrangement was that Rickman would be allowed to use her songs from ''Margaret'', "Lark of My Heart" and "Maker of My Sorrow", on her next album, ''Footnotes for the Spring''.<ref name="Mooky"/>

In 2015, Eliza Rickman announced that she would be releasing her second full-length LP, entitled ''Footnotes for the Spring''. Since the recording and release of ''O, You Sinners'', Rickman had undergone a great deal of stress and anxiety, resulting in health and neurological issues, from perpetually living on the road,<ref name="LAWeekly">Liz Ohanesian.

''Footnotes for the Spring'' was originally intended to be about the [[Southern United States|American South]], but owing to her experiences over the previous few years, the album's content came to reflect more her life experiences.<ref name="Zine"/> ''Footnotes for the Spring'' was primarily recorded and arranged by Jason Webley in his studio in [[Everett, Washington]], though much of the piano material was recorded at The Jackstraw Cultural Center in Seattle.<ref>[https://elizarickman.bandcamp.com/album/footnotes-for-the-spring  Footnotes for the Spring – Bandcamp]. Retrieved October 8, 2017</ref> The album was officially released on October 20, 2015.

Rickman announced in 2015 that she would be releasing an album composed of covers of various artists,<ref name="WPR">''Wyoming Public Radio''.

A release date has yet to be announced. The album takes its name from a lyric in the [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter]] duet "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]."<ref name="Zine"/> On January 11, 2018, Rickman announced the release of one of her covers, "Riches and Wonders" by [[The Mountain Goats]], performed with [[Jherek Bischoff]],<ref>[https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/album/i-only-listen-to-the-mountain-goats I Only Listen to The Mountain Goats – Bandcamp].

===Musical style===
Due to her aesthetics, both in fashion and musically, Rickman has been regarded as being hard to classify. She does not feel that "singer songwriter" is a label that fits her. A term she prefers is "post-prince charming" or "the Disney princess who’s been through some shit."<ref name="FAQ"/><ref name="LAWeekly"/> For example, her song ''Pretty Little Head'' has been called "disconcerting," “borderline childlike," “subliminal peculiarity," and "the feel of a nursery rhyme that’s just starting to teeter off the rails."<ref>Mark Hirsh. ''National Public Radio''. "[https://www.npr.org/2012/05/23/153296147/eliza-rickman-a-cockeyed-pop-song  Eliza Rickman – A Cockeyed Pop Song]". March 23, 2012. Retrieved November 8, 2017</ref>

===Instruments===
Other than her standard piano, one of Rickman's signature instruments is a [[toy piano]]. Her first toy piano was a 1960s′ Schoenhut, which was purchased for her by her mother at an antique store for her 23rd birthday, though the signature pink piano used in live performances was a gift from the [[Schoenhut Piano Company]].<ref name="FAQ">Eliza Rickman. [http://www.elizarickman.com/faq/  Official Website – FAQ]. Retrieved September 8, 2017.</ref> The antique Schoenhut was purchased as a piece of furniture, but after growing tired of transporting a large keyboard to and from live performances, she opted to use the toy piano for small-venue shows, which was well received by fans. She has since made the toy piano a staple of her live shows.<ref name="Zine"/>

Another instrument Rickman commonly uses is the [[autoharp]]. Like her toy piano, her autoharp is antique, and she purchased it in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. She claims she originally started to play the [[autoharp]] because it made her look like a "damsel",<ref name="FAQ"/> but has become a central instrument in her writing and performances.

Rickman and her band use and experiment with a variety of instruments, some of which are unconventional, such as wine or liquor bottles.<ref name="RedFence"/> Other instruments include the [[ukulele]] (which was introduced to her by Jason Webley), [[accordion]], [[pump organ]], singing wine glasses, [[tambourine]], [[ratchet (instrument)|ratchets]], children's bells, [[kazoo]], and other [[noisemaker]]s.<ref name="AudioPerv"/>

===Influences===
There are a number of musicians, performers, artists, and film directors that Eliza Rickman attributes as major influences on her music. Among the most influential are [[Siouxsie Sioux]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Andrew Bird]],<ref name="RedFence"/> [[Elton John]], [[The Beatles]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Patsy Cline]],<ref name="Zine"/> [[Joan Baez]], [[Édith Piaf]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Echo & the Bunnymen]], [[Bryan Ferry]], and the [[Cocteau Twins]],<ref name="FAQ"/> along with [[Alfred Hitchcock]]<ref name="Zine"/> and [[Tim Burton]]<ref name="RedFence"/> as non-musical inspirations.
