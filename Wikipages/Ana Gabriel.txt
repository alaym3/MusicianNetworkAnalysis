'''María Guadalupe Araujo Yong''' (born December 10, 1955), better known as '''Ana Gabriel''', is a Mexican singer and songwriter from Comanito, [[Sinaloa]], Mexico. She first sang on the stage at age six, singing "Regalo A Dios" by [[José Alfredo Jiménez]]. She moved to [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]] and studied accounting. At age 21, in 1977, she recorded her first song, titled "Compréndeme". During her long career, she has hits in three different [[Music genre|genres]] of music: [[Latin pop]] and [[Mariachi]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

As of 2013, Gabriel had released twenty studio albums, three live albums, and fifteen [[compilation albums]]. Three Gabriel albums reached number one on the [[Latin Pop Albums|''Billboard'' Latin Pop Albums]], and seven singles reached number one on the [[Hot Latin Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Latin Songs]] chart, including "[[Ay Amor (Ana Gabriel song)|Ay Amor]]", "[[Es Demasiado Tarde]]", and "[[Quién Como Tú (song)|Quién Como Tú]]". Her work earned her numerous awards and accolades, including a [[Grammy Award]] nomination, four [[Latin Grammy Award]] nominations, thirteen [[Lo Nuestro|Lo Nuestro Award]]s, as well as awards from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]; in 2006, she received the [[Lo Nuestro Excellence Award|Excellence Award]] at the Lo Nuestro Awards.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.terra.com/musica/noticias/ana_gabriel_sera_maxima_excelencia_de_lo_nuestro/oci75923 | language = Spanish | accessdate = August 15, 2011 | title = Ana Gabriel será Máxima Excelencia de Lo Nuestro | date = February 13, 2006 | publisher = terra.com}}</ref>

==Career==

In 1987, Ana Gabriel won third place at the [[OTI Festival]], celebrated in [[Lisbon]], Portugal, where she performed an orchestral version of the pop-power ballad song "''[[Ay Amor (Ana Gabriel song)|Ay Amor]]''", which later was released as a single in its album version; it climbed to the top position in Mexico, throughout Ibero-America and on the [[Hot Latin Tracks|Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart]] for 14 consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formulamexicana.com/?p=2946|title=Ana Gabriel|access-date=November 13, 2013 |publisher=formulamexicana.com|language=es}}</ref> 
 
In 1988 Gabriel released her first album, ''Tierra de Nadie'', followed by ''Pecado Original'' in 1989, which met with some chart success. Her 1990 album ''Quién Como Tú'' made her a force within the Mexican music industry. Eight months later, her live album ''En Vivo'' showcased her powerful stage act and scored several hits: "Hice Bien Quererte", "Propuesta", and "Solamente una Vez".

Throughout the 1990s Gabriel released an album almost every year. A versatile singer, she showcased her talent as an interpreter of many different musical styles, from lambada to mariachi and romantic ballads to pop music. She also honed her skills as a songwriter and a producer, releasing ''Mi México'', a ranchera-influenced, mariachi-backed pop album, in 1991. This unique blend of styles was also reflected in the songs, all written by Gabriel. Her lyrics described strong, active women involved in their love lives, counter to their passive, traditional depiction in older songs. The album also included a tribute to Mexico's most popular singer-songwriter, [[Juan Gabriel]] (no relation).

Gabriel scored a number-one hit with the duet "[[Cosas del Amor (song)|Cosas del Amor]]" in 1991, which she sang with [[Vikki Carr]], a Mexican-American pop singer. The single earned Gabriel a [[Lo Nuestro]] Award for Song of the Year in 1992. At the same awards ceremony, Gabriel was also named Female Artist of the Year in the Regional Mexican category and Pop Female Artist of the Year; ''[[Mi México]]'' was named Regional Mexican Album of the Year. In 1993, Gabriel was awarded [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1993|Best Pop Female Performer]] at the Lo Nuestro Awards.<ref name="lo-nuestro-a-gabriel"/> The following year, she appeared as a guest artist on [[Plácido Domingo]]'s Grammy-nominated<ref name=Lannert>{{cite journal|last1=Lannert|first1=John|title=Latin Notas|journal=[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]|date=January 21, 1995|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAsEAAAAMBAJ&q=de+mi+alma+latina+grammy+nomination&pg=PA36|access-date=October 4, 2015}}</ref> album, ''[[De Mi Alma Latina]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=De mi alma latina|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/de-mi-alma-latina-mw0000121451|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 5, 2015}}</ref>

In 1996 she released the pop-oriented ''Vivencias''. She followed this with the traditional ranchera album ''Con un Mismo Corazón'' in 1997, an album she wrote and produced herself. Of particular interest is her title-track duet with [[Vicente Fernández]], one of the most prolific and popular ranchera singers in Mexican history. Burr{{Who|date=August 2019}} wrote of the duet, "The beauty here lies in the melding of two great voices—Gabriel's husky sensuality and Fernandez's powerful, understated expressions—set against a 25-piece symphony."{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Gabriel released another live album in 1998, ''En la Plaza de Toros México'', a 30-track boxed set. That same year she traveled to Miami to work with the renowned producer Emilio Estefan, Jr., on her 1999 album ''Soy Como Soy''. The result was a pop-influenced ranchera album that went gold in the Latin music market and helped Gabriel win the Ritmo Latino Music Award for Female Pop Artist of the Year in 2000.

With the release of ''Eternamente'' in 2000, Gabriel returned to mariachi love ballads, using only guitar as accompaniment. That same year she also appeared with other Mexican music icons in an independence day television special called ''Viva Mexico'', a celebration of Mexican music and history. In 2001 Gabriel released ''Huelo a Soledad'', once again balancing the traditional sounds of Eternamente with sophisticated pop songs, a cappella numbers, and dance tracks.

In 2002, Gabriel's platinum-selling album ''Sagitario'' was released. In that same year, she won the Billboard Latin Music Estrella Award in recognition of her contribution to the Latin music industry, performed at a tribute concert for Vicente Fernandez sponsored by the Latin Music Awards, and participated in the ninth annual Las Cruces International Mariachi Concert and Festival in New Mexico. In December of that year, she was scheduled to perform at the eleventh annual Christmas Mariachi Festival in Phoenix, Arizona, but was denied a work visa and refused entry into the United States.

In 2017, Gabriel appeared in the multi award-winning documentary film ''[[The American Epic Sessions]]'' directed by [[Bernard MacMahon (filmmaker)|Bernard MacMahon]]. In the film Gabriel recorded live on the restored first [[History of sound recording#The electrical era (1925 to 1945) (including sound on film)|electrical sound recording]] system from the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/american-epic-return-of-the-lathe/|title=The Long-Lost, Rebuilt Recording Equipment That First Captured the Sound of America|work=WIRED|access-date=February 27, 2018}}</ref> She performed [[Lydia Mendoza]]'s "Mal Hombre" accompanied by a large band featuring [[Omar Rodríguez-López]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://interactive.wttw.com/playlist/2017/06/05/performers-american-epic-sessions|title=The Performers in 'The American Epic Sessions'|date=June 6, 2017|work=WTTW Chicago Public Media – Television and Interactive|access-date=February 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirteen.org/13pressroom/files/2017/04/American-Epic-Sessions-song-list.pdf|title=American Epic Sessions song list|website=Thirteen.org|access-date=February 27, 2018}}</ref> Stephen Dalton in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described her performance as "fantastic".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/american-epic-sessions-london-review-831315|title='The American Epic Sessions': London Review|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=February 27, 2018}}</ref>
