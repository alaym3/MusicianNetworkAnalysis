Referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#S|Queen of Dancehall]]", Spice is recognised as one of the most prominent dancehall artists in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|date=7 March 2020|title=Spice to be crowned Queen of Dancehall at Reggae Sumfest 2020|url=https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/entertainment/20200307/spice-be-crowned-queen-dancehall-reggae-sumfest-2020|url-status=live|access-date=14 May 2021|website=Jamaica Gleaner}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Kelly|first=Emma|date=2018-10-23|title=Love & Hip-Hop star Spice denounces colourism by 'bleaching skin' for new single|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/23/love-hip-hop-star-spice-shocks-fans-by-bleaching-skin-but-its-a-publicity-stunt-to-denounce-colourism-8066466/|access-date=2021-05-28|website=Metro|language=en}}</ref>

Beginning her career in the early 2000s, Spice had her first major success with the controversial single "Romping Shop" with [[Vybz Kartel]] in 2009. She subsequently signed with [[VP Records]], and released her debut EP, ''[[So Mi Like It]]'' (2014), which was preceded by the single of the same name. In 2018, Spice joined the cast of [[VH1]]'s reality television series ''[[Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta]]'' in season seven, after appearing as a guest star in season six.

Spice's first full-length project, a mixtape titled ''[[Captured (mixtape)|Captured]]'' (2018), debuted at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Reggae Albums chart. It was preceded by the single "Black Hypocrisy", which addresses the issue of [[colorism]] in the black community. ''Captured'' was released independently following a dispute with Spice's record label over the release of her long-delayed debut studio album, [[10 (Spice album)|''10'']] (2021).

==Career==
===2000–2007: Career beginnings===
Spice made her debut when she was given the opportunity to perform at the annual dancehall festival Sting in 2000. It was her first major appearance on a stage show, where she earned several encores from the crowd.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Russell-Garcia|first1=Sherina|title=Ms. Grace "Spice" Hamilton|url=http://www.caribbeanposh.com/music-entertainment/ms-grace-%E2%80%9Cspice%E2%80%9D-hamilton|website=Caribbean Posh|accessdate=22 March 2016|archive-date=19 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819082229/http://www.caribbeanposh.com/music-entertainment/ms-grace-%E2%80%9Cspice%E2%80%9D-hamilton|url-status=live}}</ref> During this early stage of her career, Spice went on to gain a reputation for her performing abilities, despite not having any hit record.

While on tour in the UK, Spice earned the attention of [[Baby Cham]], who later introduced her to renowned record producer [[Dave Kelly (producer)|Dave Kelly]]. From there, she released her first single for Kelly's [[Madhouse Records]] label entitled "Complain", then followed by her singles on the Bad Gal [[riddim]], "Right There" with Toi and "Hype". At that time, she was featured on [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s "I Want I Do I Get" from his album ''Black Magic'' (2004) and on [[Beenie Man]]'s "Hot" from his album ''[[Concept of Life]]'' (2006). For her first hit single, Spice used the popular Eighty Five [[riddim]] to create "Fight Over Man", which became popular in the dancehall scene. In 2007, she went on a hiatus due to the birth of her son but soon returned to performing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Spice juggles motherhood, music - Entertainment - Jamaica Star - September 3, 2011|url=http://old.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20110903/ent/ent3.html|access-date=2020-12-21|website=old.jamaica-star.com|url-status=live}}</ref>

===2008–2012: Breakthrough and continued success===
In late 2008, Spice collaborated with fellow dancehall artist [[Vybz Kartel]] on the single "Romping Shop", which samples "[[Miss Independent (Ne-Yo song)|Miss Independent]]" by [[Ne-Yo]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Serwer|first1=Jesse|title=Vybz Kartel featuring Spice, "Ramping Shop"|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1070906/vybz-kartel-featuring-spice-ramping-shop|website=Billboard|accessdate=18 February 2017|archive-date=19 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219123109/http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1070906/vybz-kartel-featuring-spice-ramping-shop|url-status=live}}</ref> The song quickly achieved international recognition, receiving immense rotation on mainstream urban stations in the US.
