'''I the Mighty''' was an American rock band based out of [[San Francisco]], California, United States, formed in 2007. As of 2019, the band has released two singles, four EPs, and four studio albums. Their major label debut, [[Satori (I the Mighty album)|Satori]], peaked at #10 on the Billboard Heatseekers Charts. As of July 24, 2020, the band is taking an indefinite hiatus following sexual assault allegations against vocalist Brent Walsh.

==History==
===Formation (2007–2011)===
Formed in 2007, the band began while vocalist Brent Walsh and Ian Pedigo were still in high school together. The two taught themselves how to play guitar, and then started writing songs together as a two-man acoustic project, ''Breakpoint'',<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=Elgart|first=Gordon|title=10 Quick Questions with I the Mighty|url=http://spinningplatters.com/2009/08/20/10-quick-questions-with-i-the-mighty/|publisher=Spinningplatters.com|accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref> but changed their name due to copyright issues. They released an acoustic self-titled EP in 2008. Later they recruited Chris Hinkley, who Brent and Ian met five years prior to the band's formation while he was playing with another band. The three then began to practice acoustic songs that Walsh and Pedigo had penned. Blake Dahlinger saw the trio performing at the Retox Lounge and asked the group if they needed a drummer.

For their debut album, ''We Speak'', Dahlinger and Hinkley simply wrote the parts for their instruments for the existing songs that had already been written. The lyrics were written mostly by Walsh, with the exception of the song ''101'', which was written by Pedigo.<ref>We Speak CD Booklet.</ref> ''We Speak'' was to be released through Bay Area indie label Talking House Records, the first label that signed the band, but the label went under before the album could officially be released.<ref name=":0" /> They released a free EP called ''Hearts and Spades'' containing five songs from ''We Speak'', when they were unable to release the album as a whole. The group caught the attention of Brad Wiseman, a booking agent for [[Equal Vision Records]]. They sent him early demos of their songs "Cutting Room Floor" and "Escalators". The label sent the head of A&R out to see one of the band's shows in LA.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Brent Walsh of I the Mighty|url=http://thewellzstreetjournal.com/2013/07/05/interview-with-brent-walsh-of-i-the-mighty/|publisher=Thewellzstreetjournal.com|accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref> They were signed to the label in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=I The Mighty|url=http://www.equalvision.com/artists/i-the-mighty/|website=www.equalvision.com|publisher=Equal Vision Records|accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref>

===''Karma Never Sleeps'' and ''Satori'' (2012–2014)===
The band worked with Erik Ron for their third EP, ''Karma Never Sleeps''. It was released on March 27, 2012, and serves as their debut on Equal Vision Records. It was met with positive reviews from fans and critics. The band embarked on a series of tours that year. In late 2012, they were a part of the Rock Yourself to Sleep Tour alongside bands [[Dance Gavin Dance]], and [[A Lot Like Birds]]. The group supported [[Hands Like Houses]] on their US tour in March 2013,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Substream|title=Hands Like Houses, I The Mighty and more storm through Cleveland|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/40769/20150612/i-the-mighty-connector-beg-grander-prog-rock-sound.htm|website=substreammagazine.com|publisher=Substream Magazine|accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref> and later [[Set It Off (band)|Set It Off]] on their North American tour.

The band started writing and recording for their major label debut album in late 2012. The band aimed to produce an album similar to Karma Never Sleeps, but still have some diversity. In an interview with Property of Zack, Walsh said, "It's kind of along the same lines as Karma Never Sleeps. I think we all stepped our game up a little bit. Everyone pushed themselves as hard as they possibly could. We wrote a bunch of stuff that's extremely hard for us to sing and play, that we're kind of learning now. Everyone pushed themselves really hard and everyone put everything they possibly had into this record. I think it shows when you listen to it".<ref>{{cite web|last=Richman|first=Jess|title=POZ Interview: I the Mighty|url=http://propertyofzack.com/post/48627665778/poz-interview-i-the-mighty|work=Property of Zack|accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>

''Satori'' was released on June 11, 2013 to positive reviews. Again, the band worked with Erik Ron for the album. They toured extensively to support the album's release. They were a part of the [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything]] on their Say Anything: Rarities and More Tour from June 23 to July 12. Then in the fall they supported [[A Skylit Drive]] on their Rise Up Tour, and later [[Coheed and Cambria]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: I the Mighty Premiere New Music Video, "Four Letter Words"|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/exclusive-i-the-mighty-premiere-new-music-video-four-letter-words.html|website=revolvermag.com|publisher=Revolver|accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref> They continued to tour in 2014, first supporting [[letlive.]] and [[Architects (UK band)|Architects]]. The band later announced they would be a part of [[Vans Warped Tour 2014]]. While on tour, they released new song, "Love Your Sin", along with acoustic versions of "The Dreamer", and "Speak to Me".

===''Connector'' (2015–2016)===
In early 2015, the band toured with [[Enter Shikari]], [[Stray from the Path]], and [[Hundredth]] in the Mindsweep Tour North America. On March 26, 2015, the band released a new single, ''Playing Catch with .22'' from their next album ''[[Connector (I the Mighty album)|Connector]]'', during the tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=I The Mighty to begin recording new album in January|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/i_the_mighty_to_begin_recording_new_album_in_january|website=altpress.com|publisher=AP|accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title = I the Mighty "Playing Catch With .22"|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesQmoU4nYw|date = 2015-03-26|accessdate = 2016-02-22|last = Equal Vision Records}}</ref> The album's release date was revealed to be June 2, 2015.

==Musical style==
I the Mighty play a style of [[post-hardcore]] music mixed with [[progressive rock]], [[experimental rock]] and [[alternative rock]]. [[Indie rock]] elements can be heard in their songs. The founding members Walsh and Pedigo draw strongly from [[Coheed and Cambria]] as a musical influence, and this is shown in much of their music.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hey I'm Brent Walsh, singer and guitarist for I the Mighty.
