'''Matt Monro''' (born '''Terence Edward Parsons''', 1 December 1930 – 7 February 1985)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/leisure/music/13610307.Son_keeps__man_with_the_golden_voice__music_going|title=Son keeps 'man with the golden voice' music going|work=[[Southern Daily Echo]]|location=Southampton, UK|first=Hilary|last=Porter|date=18 August 2015|access-date=3 October 2015}}</ref> was an English singer who became one of the most popular entertainers on the international music scene during the 1950s and 1970s. Known as ''The Man with the Golden Voice'', he filled [[cabaret]]s, [[nightclub]]s, music halls, and stadiums across the world in his 30-year career. [[AllMusic]] has described Monro as "one of the most underrated pop vocalists of the '60s", who "possessed the easiest, most perfect [[baritone]] in the business".<ref name="bush">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/this-is-matt-monro-mw0001223014|title=This Is Matt Monro|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|first=John|last=Bush|access-date=3 October 2015}}</ref>
His recordings include the UK Top 10 hits: "[[Portrait of My Love]]", "[[My Kind of Girl]]", "[[Softly, as I Leave You (song)|Softly As I Leave You]]", "[[Warum nur, warum?|Walk Away]]" and "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]" (originally by [[The Beatles]]). He also recorded several film themes such as "From Russia with Love" for the [[From Russia with Love (film)|James Bond film of the same name]], "[[Born Free (Matt Monro song)|Born Free]]" for the [[Born Free (film)|film of the same name]] and "[[On Days Like These]]" for ''[[The Italian Job]]''.

==Early career==
He was born Terence Edward Parsons in [[Finsbury]], London<ref>GRO Register of Births: MAR 1931 1b 748 FINSBURY – Terence E. Parsons, mmn = Reed</ref> and attended Duncombe School in Islington, and [[Elliott School (London)|Elliott School, Putney]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-real-school-of-rock-780693.html|title=The real school of rock|date=11 February 2008|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> He was first noticed while serving in the British armed forces in [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1670134/hong-kong-dj-uncle-ray-cordeiro-still-plays-and-breaks-records-90|title=Hong Kong DJ 'Uncle' Ray Cordeiro still plays and breaks records at 90|last1=Chou|first1=Oliver|date=29 December 2014|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=25 August 2015|quote="For a measure of Hong Kong music guru Ray Cordeiro's longevity, consider this: as a young DJ of 29, he hosted a radio talent show called Talent Time, in which a young British serviceman by the name of Terry Parsons took part and won week after week. The year was 1953, and the young serviceman would later change his name to Matt Monro and earn the nickname the 'Man with the Golden Voice' as he recorded smash hits of the 1960s, including film theme songs Born Free and From Russia With Love."}}</ref>

A regular guest (and frequent winner) of [[Rediffusion Television|Radio Rediffusion]]'s ''Talent Time'' show, he was invited by then-host [[Ray Cordeiro]] to perform in his own one-off show, on the condition that he would bow out of future ''Talent Time'' episodes to make way for others. Agreeing to the deal, he performed his first on-air concert for Rediffusion on 27 June 1953.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chou|first1=Oliver|date=8 July 2012|title=An Audience with Uncle Ray|format=PDFlocation=Hong Kong|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708093931/http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/|archive-date=8 July 2012|url=http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP|access-date=25 August 2015|quote="In Talent Time, a certain Terry Parsons showcased his impeccable voice and won so often that Cordeiro offered him his own one-off show, on the condition that he would not take part in Talent Time again. He accepted the offer and, on June 27, 1953, performed his first concert on air. Two songs from that show are featured in the Matt Monro Special Reserve Collection, recently released in Britain. 'Terry Parsons was Matt's real name, and he was in Hong Kong for two years in the military. With his consecutive wins, I made the offer because, otherwise, nobody would have signed up for the show. Many years later, when I was in London on a training course at the BBC, I looked him up in the studio. But he was in a rehearsal. I asked the man at the gate to tell him Ray from Hong Kong was waiting to see him. Munro stopped the session, running down the aisle, embracing me like a long-lost brother. He loved Hong Kong and remembered his good days here and came to my show whenever he was in town.'}} [http://www.sjcoba.org/publish/pdf/uncleray_scmp080712.pdf Alt URL]</ref>

By 1956, Monro had become a featured vocalist with the [[BBC]] Show Band. An important influence on his early career was the [[pianist]] [[Winifred Atwell]], who became his mentor, provided him with his stage name, and helped him sign with [[Decca Records]].<ref name="Larkin60">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0149-X|pages=315/6}}</ref>

In 1957, Monro released ''Blue and Sentimental'', a collection of standards.<ref name="Larkin60"/> Despite the album's critical acclaim, Monro languished among the young male singers trying to break through at the end of the 1950s, many of them emulating [[Frankie Vaughan]] by [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] [[cover version]]s of American [[hit record|hits]]. (Monro even recorded a version of Vaughan's "[[The Garden of Eden (song)|Garden of Eden]]" during this period.)<ref name="Larkin60"/> A short [[recording contract]] with [[Fontana Records]] followed.

By the end of the 1950s, Monro's mid-decade fame had evaporated, and he returned to relative obscurity. He and his wife Mickie lived from her wages as a [[song plugger]] and his [[royalties]] from a TV advertising [[jingle]] for [[Camay]] soap.<ref name="Larkin60"/> In 1959, he recorded a [[country music|country]] [[pastiche]] song, "Bound for Texas", for ''[[The Chaplin Revue]]'', a feature-length compilation of [[Charlie Chaplin]] shorts. It would be the first of many Monro [[soundtrack]] [[theme tune|themes]].

==International success==
Prior to producing the [[Peter Sellers]] album ''Songs for Swingin' Sellers'' in 1960, [[George Martin]] asked Monro to record "You Keep Me Swingin'", a satirical ditty to help the comedian imitate the song with a [[Frank Sinatra]]-type styling.<ref name="Larkin60"/> When Sellers heard the recording he decided to use it to be the opening track on the record, rather than record his own version. However, Sellers billed Monro as "Fred Flange," and though it was a demoralising experience at the time, the incident developed into a lifelong friendship with Martin, who subsequently asked Monro to begin recording with him for [[EMI]]'s [[Parlophone]] [[record label]].<ref name="Larkin60"/> Their second single and Monro's highest UK chart success, "[[Portrait of My Love]]", written by Cyril Ornadel and Norman Newell OBE (using the pseudonym "David West"), reached number three in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="Larkin60"/>

By the following year, he had been named Top International Act by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.  In February 1961, the British music magazine, ''[[NME]]'' reported that Monro had won [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s ''A Song for Britain'' with "My Kind of Girl".<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

At the 1964 [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|Eurovision Song Contest]], singing "[[I Love the Little Things]]," Monro finished second behind Italy's 16-year-old [[Gigliola Cinquetti]], despite an "excellent performance of the only English language song of the night".<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> The Austrian entry "[[Warum nur warum?]]", performed  by songwriter [[Udo Jürgens]], caught Monro's ear, despite its sixth-place finish, and he recorded an English version titled "Walk Away" (lyric by Monro's manager [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]), earning him another [[hit single]] late in 1964.<ref name="Larkin60"/> He also had a hit with [[the Beatles]]' "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]" in 1965, releasing the first single of the most recorded song of all time, predating even the Beatles' own.<ref name="Larkin60"/>

The following year, Monro sang the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning title song for the film, ''[[Born Free]],'' which became his [[signature tune]]. It was also his second collaboration with [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], following "From Russia With Love". Monro went on to record two further songs from Barry film scores: "Wednesday's Child" (from the film ''[[The Quiller Memorandum]]'') and "This Way Mary" (from ''[[Mary, Queen of Scots (1971 film)|Mary, Queen of Scots]]''). Both "Born Free" and "[[On Days Like These]]" (from the film ''[[The Italian Job]]'') had lyrics by Don Black.

In the late 1960s he recorded another [[Udo Jürgens]] song with the name "Was Ich Dir Sagen Will". It was adapted to English as "The Music Played". Monro recorded a Spanish version of the song with the adapted title of "Alguien Cantó". The Spanish version was a top sales hit (Superventas) in Spain in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listadesuperventas.blogspot.com/2010/02/1969.html|title=Listas de superventas: 1969|date=12 February 2010|website=Listadesuperventas.blogspot.com|access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> Additionally, Monro recorded an English version of Jürgens' 1966 Eurovision winner "[[Merci, Chérie]]", but it failed to chart when released as a UK single.

On 31 December 1976, Monro performed Black's "Walk Away" on [[BBC1]]'s ''[[A Jubilee of Music]]'', celebrating British pop music for Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s impending [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]].
  
Monro achieved fame in the United States when "My Kind of Girl" (1961) and "Walk Away" (1964) hit the Top 40. In 1966, following the death of [[Nat King Cole]], EMI moved Monro from Parlophone to [[Capitol Records|Capitol]]. After relocating to [[California]] and recording several albums with American [[arrangement|arrangers]], Monro returned to the UK and began appearing on EMI's [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] label, his final U.S. album release being ''Close To You'' in 1970. This LP contained "We're Gonna Change The World", a semi-satirical song about women's liberation, which was not a hit in either the US or the UK but was nevertheless widely played, and became enduringly popular on [[BBC Radio 2]]. A re-recording in 1995 did however just scrape into the UK chart.

He continued touring and recording until just before his death, releasing a single and promoting it throughout the UK and Australia in 1984. In one of his final appearances Monro praised [[Boy George]], noting the importance of quality recordings in all musical genres.

==Marriages==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}
Monro was married twice, to:
* Iris Jordan, in 1953 (divorced); one son Mitchell
* Mickie Schuller (born 19 July 1933 in Berlin; died 25 February 2010 aged 76, in Middlesex, England of bone cancer), married 1959–1985; one daughter Michele and one son, [[Matt Monro Jnr]]

==Death and legacy==
Monro was a heavy smoker and battled [[alcoholism]] from the 1960s until 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-02-08-mn-4672-story.html|title=Matt Monro, Britain's 'Cockney Como,' Dies at 54|date=8 February 1985|access-date=24 April 2019|website=Latimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/155023/Matt-Monro-Tragedy-of-the-singing-bus-driver|title=Matt Monro: Tragedy of the singing bus driver|first=John|last=Triggs|date=30 January 2010|website=Express.co.uk}}</ref> He died from [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] on 7 February 1985 at the Cromwell Hospital, [[Kensington]], London,<ref>GRO Register of Deaths: FEB 1985 13 2160 KENSINGTON & CHELSEA – Matt Monro, DoB = 1 December 1930, (should be 31 Dec?)</ref> aged 54, leaving a widow, Mickie, and three children: Mitchell, Michele, and [[Matt Monro Jnr|Matthew]]. Mitchell, a professional pilot, also died of cancer in 2003.  Matt Monro was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]]. The ashes were removed by the family.<ref>Golders Green Crematorium guide notes</ref> A memorial service was also held in Harrow.

The 20th anniversary of Monro's death spotlighted the continuing interest in his music, with a [[Top 40|Top 10]] tribute [[compilation album|compilation]] [[Compact Disc|CD]] (UK), a No. 1 [[concert]] [[DVD]] (UK), and a BBC TV documentary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mattmonro.com/|title=Matt Monro - Biography Titan Publishing - 29th January 2010|website=Mattmonro.com|access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> all appearing in 2005. A 2007 compilation CD entitled ''From Matt With Love'' reached the [[Top 40]] of the [[UK Albums Chart]] during its first week of release. His songs were featured on ''[[Friday Night is Music Night]]'' on 8 October 2010.

In late 2005, [[Matt Monro Jnr]]. toured the United Kingdom with a tribute concert commemorating the anniversary. Also, EMI  re-released ''Matt Sings Monro'', a 1995 duet album that combined his voice with the senior Monro's.<ref name="Larkin60"/> Another posthumous Matt Monro duet, with [[Cliff Richard]], appeared on Richard's duets CD, ''Two's Company'', in 2007.

Monro never recorded a "live" concert album, preferring the technical purity of the recording studio and wanting his public performances to retain an element of uniqueness. However, in the past few years, commercially released concert albums have emerged following meticulous remastering of radio and television shows, private recordings he commissioned. These include an intimate 1967 cabaret performance from his first tour of Australia; a 1967 BBC concert with Nelson Riddle; a 1966 arena concert before 24,000 fans in Manila; and one of his final concerts, recorded on the last night of his fourteenth and final Australian tour in 1984.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

His daughter Michele has written a biography, ''The Singer's Singer: The Life and Music of Matt Monro'' and has been instrumental, along with sound engineer Richard Moore, in releasing rare and unreleased material by Matt Monro in recent years.

Through the years, Monro's recordings have been featured regularly in radio and television commercials. In July 2020, the [[Unilever]] brand [[Axe (brand)|Axe]] began airing an American TV campaign for its [[deodorant]] line that spoofed the restrictions on [[dating]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], with Monro's "[[Born Free (Matt Monro song)|Born Free]]" as the soundtrack theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ispot.tv/ad/nCxs/axe-readjusting-wont-be-easy-song-by-matt-monro|title=Axe TV Commercial, 'Readjusting Won't Be Easy' Song by Matt Monro|website=iSpot.tv|access-date=23 July 2020}}</ref>

In March 2020, Monro reached no. 8 in the UK Albums Chart with an album of performances with a quintet recorded in New York. These recordings, later overdubbed by Dave Cavenaugh in Hollywood, were released for the first time as Monro wanted them to be.

What would have been Monro's 90th birthday in December 2020, was celebrated by his family with the creation of an official YouTube page, and the four part audio documentary, ''The Boy From Shoreditch''.

==His music==
{{Listen|filename=Matt Monro - On Days Like These excerpt.ogg|title=Matt Monro – On Days Like These excerpt|description=An excerpt from "On Days Like These"}}
Most of Monro's recordings were produced or overseen by [[George Martin]]. Unlike his contemporaries, Monro recorded very few [[Tin Pan Alley]] standards during his career. (The exception was ''Matt Monro Sings Hoagy Carmichael'', one of his most highly regarded albums.)<ref name="Larkin60"/> Instead, he and Martin searched for material written by promising newcomers and commissioned English lyrics for dramatic melodies written by European [[composer]]s.

Monro also covered many of the most popular stage and screen songs of the 1950s and 1960s. Over the years, his recordings featured arrangements by [[Sid Feller]], [[Billy May]], [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], [[Buddy Bregman]], [[Kenny Clayton]] and Colin Keyes, and Martin himself. He also had a long and fruitful musical partnership with British arranger [[Johnnie Spence]]. Monro also teamed up with American star arrangers [[Nelson Riddle]] and [[Billy May]] and leading British bandleader [[Ted Heath (bandleader)|Ted Heath]], for concerts broadcast by the BBC.

In 1973, Monro released a vocal version of the popular ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' TV-series [[Eye Level|theme]] titled "And You Smiled", with lyrics written by Melvyn Taggart. It was his final hit. In 1977,  he recorded the Don Black penned, "If I Never Sing Another Song", which became a latter-day standard among his contemporaries, its lyrics referring to the "heyday" of fan mail, awards, and other trappings of celebrity that had faded for them.

In 1979 Monro recorded his final studio album, the third all-Spanish album produced by Leonardo Schultz and Gary Mason. Schultz and Mason hoped to capitalize on the success of the earlier hit song "Alguien Cantó", which Leonardo Schultz had adapted to Spanish. The album, entitled ''Un Toque De Distinción'', was recorded in George Martin's Air London Studios, as well as in Miami, Los Angeles, and New York. The arranger was Kenny Woodman, and it was engineered by Tom Greto.  The album was eventually released in 1982. The album was a critical success, and was a hit in various Latin American countries. The song "Volveré Alguna Vez" from the album made it on to the singles chart; the song was subsequently sung by [[José Feliciano]] and became a hit.
