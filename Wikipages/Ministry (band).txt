'''Ministry''' is an American [[industrial metal]] band founded in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1981 by producer, singer and instrumentalist [[Al Jourgensen]]. Originally a [[synth-pop]] outfit, Ministry evolved into one of the pioneers of [[industrial metal]] in the late 1980s. The band's lineup has changed frequently, leaving Jourgensen as the sole original member left in Ministry.{{sfn|Brooks|2017|p=49}} Musicians who have contributed to the band's studio or live activities include vocalists [[Nivek Ogre]], [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]], [[Gibby Haynes]], [[Burton C. Bell]] and [[Jello Biafra]], guitarists [[Mike Scaccia]] and [[Tommy Victor]], bassists [[Paul Barker]], [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]], [[Jason Christopher]], [[Tony Campos]] and [[Paul D'Amour]], drummers [[Bill Rieflin]], [[Martin Atkins]], [[Rey Washam]], [[Max Brody]], [[Joey Jordison]] and [[Roy Mayorga]], keyboardist [[John Bechdel]], and rappers and producers [[DJ Swamp]] and [[Arabian Prince]].

Ministry attained commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s with three of their studio albums: ''[[The Land of Rape and Honey]]'' (1988), ''[[The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste]]'' (1989) and ''[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs|Psalm 69]]'' (1992). The first two were certified gold while ''Psalm 69'' was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Ministry&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA.com]] |access-date=September 27, 2017}}</ref> ''Psalm 69'' was followed by ''[[Filth Pig]]'' (1996), which was a stylistic departure for the band, and earned Ministry its highest chart position on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number nineteen, although it was met with mixed reception by critics and marked the beginning of the band's commercial decline.<ref name="bill01">{{cite web|title=Ministry – Chart history|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/ministry|website=Billboard|access-date=November 27, 2017}}</ref> The lackluster response to their next album, ''[[Dark Side of the Spoon]]'' (1999), resulted in [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] dropping Ministry from the label and the group entered an extended hiatus in early 2000s, when Jourgensen entered [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] after years of [[substance abuse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ministry {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ministry-mn0000420133/biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref>

Following Jourgensen's recovery, Ministry resurfaced in 2003 with ''[[Animositisomina]]'', which turned out to be their last album with Paul Barker, who had left the band early the next year after nearly two decades as an official member.<ref>{{cite web|title=Founding Bassist Paul Barker Leaves Ministry|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1484541/founding-bassist-paul-barker-leaves-ministry/|last=Archive-Jon-Wiederhorn|website=MTV News|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref> Ministry returned to their thrash/industrial style of ''Psalm 69'' and released three albums critical of then-President of the United States, [[George W. Bush]], dubbed the "Bush Trilogy": ''[[Houses of the Molé]]'' (2004), ''[[Rio Grande Blood]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Last Sucker]]'' (2007); these albums effectively revitalized the band's commercial viability, selling over five-thousand copies and enjoying chart success in certain countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pissarmy.com/viewtopic.php?p=196456#196456 |title=I come bearing a gift: Ministry's official soundscan numbers |last=Neilstein, Vince |date=2007-02-07 |publisher=pissarmy.com |access-date=2021-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030550/http://pissarmy.com/viewtopic.php?p=196456 |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/?p=2479|title=THIS WEEK'S SOUNDSCAN NUMBERS REVEALED|last=Neilstein, Vince|date=2007-09-26|publisher=MetalSucks|access-date=2021-04-13}}</ref> Although ''The Last Sucker'' was initially intended to be the band's final album, Ministry reformed in 2011 and released ''[[Relapse (Ministry album)|Relapse]]'' in the following year. On December 23, 2012, longtime guitar contributor Mike Scaccia died of a heart attack, and he was posthumously featured in the next Ministry album, ''[[From Beer to Eternity]]'' (2013), which was again supposed to be their last album, as Jourgensen thought his death was the end of the band.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Al Jourgensen Announces the End of Ministry|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/al_jourgensen_announces_the_end_of_ministry.html|website=www.ultimate-guitar.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref> Despite this, Ministry has since released two more albums: ''[[AmeriKKKant]]'' (2018) and ''[[Moral Hygiene]]'' (2021), and they are working on new material for a sixteenth studio album as of October 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=43722|title=Ministry - Releasing Next Full Length In 2022|publisher=[[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]]|access-date=October 21, 2021|date=October 21, 2021}}</ref>

The band has been nominated for six [[Grammy Award]]s and has performed at several music festivals, including the second annual [[Lollapalooza]] tour in 1992, co-headlining [[Big Day Out]] in 1995 and performing at [[Wacken Open Air]] thrice (in 2006, 2012 and 2016).

==History==
===Formation and early days (1981–1982)===
Ministry's origins date to 1978, when Jourgensen moved from [[Denver]] to [[Chicago]] to attend the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. He was introduced to the local underground scene by his then-girlfriend, and in 1979 he replaced Tom Hoffmann on guitars in [[Special Affect]], a post-punk group which featured vocalist Frank Nardiello ([[Groovie Mann]] of [[My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult]]), drummer Harry Rushakoff ([[Concrete Blonde]]) and bassist Marty Sorenson.<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|2000|p=497}}; {{harvnb|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|pp=45–46}}</ref><ref name="Nothing Exceeds Like Excess">{{cite magazine|last=Wolanski |first=Coreen |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/ministry-nothing_exceeds_like_excess|title=Ministry – Nothing Exceeds Like Excess|magazine=[[Exclaim!]]|date=March 1, 2003 |access-date=December 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Revolver TracRec">{{Cite magazine |last=Angle |first=Brad |date=December 1, 2007 |title=Ministry: Track Record |url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/ministry-track-record |magazine=[[Revolver Magazine]] |access-date=December 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Following Special Affect's split in 1980, Jourgensen formed a short-lived band called The Silly Carmichaels, which featured members of [[The Imports]] and played two shows.<ref name="Prongs_Krug">{{cite web|url=http://www.prongs.org/ministry/Krug1 |title=Interview with Ben Krug regarding the Silly Charmichaels |website=Prongs.org |date=March 18, 2006 |access-date=March 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|p=47}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/11/12/hyde-park-postpunks-the-imports-couldve-been-americas-joy-division|title=Hyde Park postpunks the Imports could've been America's Joy Division {{!}} Bleader|last=Krakow|first=Steve|date=December 11, 2016|website=[[Chicago Reader]]|access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref><ref name="ONO Unabridged">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecompmagazine.com/ono/ |title=ONO – An Unabridged History In Conversation |last=Alamo-Costello |first=Chester |date=August 7, 2016 |website=The COMP Magazine |access-date=December 4, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1981, Jourgensen met Jim Nash and Danny Flesher, co-founders and co-owners of the indie record label and shop [[Wax Trax! Records]] who recommended him as a touring guitarist for [[Divine (performer)|Divine]].{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|pp=47–48}} After playing a few concerts with the latter, Jourgensen began to write and record songs in his apartment, using a newly bought [[ARP Omni]] synthesizer, a drum machine, and a reel-to-reel tape recorder.<ref name="Ordained by Dance"/> He presented a demo to Jim Nash, who suggested Jourgensen record a single and form a touring band, which Jourgensen decided to call Ministry.{{efn|In an article published in the September 1982 issue of ''Illinois Entertainer'', Jourgensen was said to discuss several possible names for the band (including "Fallen Pillar", "Ministry of Fear" and "Ministry of Funk"), before settling on Ministry as it combined "the doom / gloom chromosomes of Fear and the dance feel of Funk."<ref name="Ordained by Dance"/> Much later publications has Jourgensen giving a credit to [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1944 movie ''[[Ministry of Fear]]'' for inspiring the band's name;<ref name="RockNames">{{Cite book|title=Rock Names: From ABBA to ZZ Top: How Rock Bands Got Their Names|last=Dolgins|first=Adam|publisher=Carol Pub.

The first line-up of Ministry consisted of keyboardists Robert Roberts and John Davis, bassist Sorenson, and drummer [[Stephen George (musician)|Stephen George]]; Jourgensen claimed he didn't want to perform vocals, but decided to do so after he auditioned several singers "who all sucked."<ref name="Prongs Rob.

The album continued their success in the underground music scene. ''The Land of Rape and Honey'' made use of synthesizers, keyboards, tape loops, jackhammering drum machines, dialogue excerpted from movies, unconventional electronic processing, and, in parts, heavy distorted electric guitar and bass.

The album was supported by a tour in 1988 and the singles and music videos for "[[Stigmata (song)|Stigmata]]" and "[[Flashback (Ministry song)|Flashback]]". "Stigmata" was also used in a key scene in Richard Stanley's 1990 film ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'', although the band shown performing the song was [[Gwar]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZGHDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA87|title=British Film Music and Film Musicals|format=electronic book|first=K.|last=Donnelly|date=August 16, 2007|publisher=Springer|access-date=March 7, 2018|pages=87–90|isbn=9780230597747|via=Google Books}}</ref>

The follow-up album, ''[[The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste]]'', was released in 1989. Due to the complex nature of the album's drumming, a second drummer, [[Martin Atkins]] (formerly of [[Public Image Ltd.]] and [[Killing Joke]]), was hired.

===Jourgensen's recovery from drug addiction and comeback (2001–2007)===
Around 2001, Jourgensen almost lost his arm when he was bitten by a venomous spider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/jourgensens%20heroin%20wake-up%20call |title=Ministry – Jourgensen's Heroin Wake-Up Call|website=Contactmusic.com|df=mdy-all|date=November 8, 2005|access-date=March 16, 2011|postscript=. Also cited in: {{harvnb|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|pp=193–194}}.}}</ref> By his own admission, Jourgensen was suicidal during this period and decided to call an acquaintance he had met years earlier; the acquaintance, Angelina Luckacin, helped Jourgensen give up his massive substance habit, which included heroin and cocaine "[[speedball (drug)|speedballs]]", [[crack cocaine|crack]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], various pharmaceuticals and as many as two full bottles of [[Old Bushmills Distillery|Bushmills]] whiskey per day (Luckacin and Jourgensen married soon after).{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|pp=XXIV, 59–61, 196, 199–207}} Jourgensen and Barker, along with [[Max Brody]] who had joined as a saxophone player for the 1999 tour, focused on developing songs for a new record during 2001 and 2002, with the band issuing ''[[Animositisomina]]'' on Sanctuary Records in 2003. The sound was strongly heavy metal with voice effects, though it featured an almost-pop cover of [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]'s "The Light Pours Out Of Me". ''Animositisomina'', compared to previous releases, sold poorly and singles for "Animosity" and "Piss" were canceled before they could be released.

Barker announced his departure from Ministry in January 2004. He stated that the trigger was his father dying while the band was wrapping up a summer tour in Europe, and also stated that his family life was his main focus at that particular time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1484541/founding-bassist-paul-barker-leaves-ministry/|title=Founding Bassist Paul Barker Leaves Ministry|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|date=January 22, 2004|website=MTV News|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> Lukacin stated in 2013 that Jourgensen fell out with Barker over the band's finances.{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|pp=213–215}} Jourgensen continued Ministry with Mike Scaccia and various other musicians.

[[File:Ministry, Mera Luna 2006.JPG|thumb|Ministry performing live at the 2006 [[M'era Luna Festival]] ([[Hildesheim]], Germany)]]
For Ministry's next album, Jourgensen released the song "[[No W]]", a song critical of then-U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]; an alternate version of the track was placed on the multi-performer compilation ''[[Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1]]''. The follow-up LP, ''[[Houses of the Molé]]'' (2004), contained the most explicitly political lyrics Jourgensen had yet written, with songs played more crudely than on previous recordings, giving the album the most metal-oriented sound of their career. In 2006, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Blood]]'', an LP on Jourgensen's own [[13th Planet Records]]. With [[Prong (band)|Prong]]'s [[Tommy Victor]] and [[Killing Joke]]'s [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]], the album featured an even heavier thrash metal sound drawing comparison to [[Slayer]]. The single "Lieslieslies" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. It, along with another song on the album, "The Great Satan", is also available as a [[downloadable content]] song for the 2008 video game ''[[Rock Band 2]]''. In July 2007, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Dub]]'', an album featuring remixes from the band's 2006 ''[[Rio Grande Blood]]'' album.

===Breakup and posthumous releases (2008–2011)===
Jourgensen remixed and co-produced Spyder Baby's "Bitter", which was released by Blind Prophecy Records in early 2008.

A song titled "[[Keys to the City (song)|Keys to the City]]", which became the theme song for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], was released on March 5, 2008. In addition to this single, two albums of covers/remixes, ''[[Cover Up (Ministry album)|Cover Up]]'' (April 1, 2008) and ''[[Undercover (Ministry album)|Undercover]]'' (December 6, 2010) were released. All of these releases are credited to '''Ministry and Co-Conspirators''', since they feature [[collaboration]]s between Jourgensen and other musicians.

Ministry's "farewell" tour, the "C-U-LaTour", started its North American leg on March 26, 2008 with [[Meshuggah]] performing as special guests and [[Hemlock (band)|Hemlock]] as an opening act.

During the performance, Jourgensen repeatedly reaffirmed it would indeed be the last Ministry show. Due to a large demand for tickets, an extra gig was added at the Tripod on July 19, 2008. The band again played to a full house. Ministry's final song at this show (and ostensibly their last live performance) was a rendition of their cover version of "[[What a Wonderful World]]".<ref name="PopMatters_Ministry in Dublin 18.07.12">{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/161320-ministry-18-july-2012-dublin-ireland-2495829574.html|title=Ministry: 18 July 2012–Dublin, Ireland|last=Brown|first=Dean|date=August 2, 2012|website=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref>

A [[documentary film]] called ''Fix: The Ministry Movie'' was planned for release sometime in 2010. However, the release date was pushed back to early 2011. Eventually, it premiered at the Chicago International Movies & Music Festival. Jourgensen sued the filmmaker, Doug Freel, for failing to fulfill a portion of the contract giving Jourgensen approval over the final cut, along with "thousands of dollars".<ref>{{cite web|first=Gina |last=McIntyre |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/04/ministry-frontman-al-jourgensen-sues-makers-of-behind-the-scenes-documentary-fix-.html |title=Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen sues makers of behind-the-scenes documentary 'Fix' |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=April 20, 2011 |access-date=July 1, 2011}}</ref> The lawsuit was dropped in July 2011.

Jourgensen told ''Metal Hammer'' in August 2011 that Ministry was working on a new album called ''[[Relapse (Ministry album)|Relapse]]'', which they hoped to release by Christmas. Regarding the sound of the new material, he explained, "We've only got five songs to go. I've been listening to it the last couple of weeks and I wasn't really in the mood, I was just taking it as a joke. Just to pass the time at first but [Mikey's] raving about it. It's like, dude c'mon, this is not about Bush, so ... that part's over. The ulcers are gone and Bush is gone so it's time for something new. I think this is actually gonna wind up being the fastest and heaviest record I've ever done. Just because we did it as anti-therapy therapy against the country music we would just take days off and thrash faster than I've done in a long time, faster than Mikey's done in a long time.
