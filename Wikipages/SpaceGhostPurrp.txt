Jitt died in 2010. SpaceGhostPurrp recruited various rap artists to Raider Klan, including [[Denzel Curry]], [[Yung Simmie]], Nell, Chris Travis, Xavier Wulf, Rell, Amber London, and Key Nyata, among many others.

At the tail end of 2010 and early 2011, SpaceGhostPurrp began collaborating with [[Lil Ugly Mane]].<ref>[https://liluglymane.bandcamp.com/album/doing-badass-improvisational-stuff-rag-for-piano Doing Badass Improvisational Stuff Rag For Piano | Lil Ugly Mane].

After ''[[Blackland Radio 66.6]]'' was released on May 1, 2011, a few weeks later SpaceGhostPurrp announced he was working on five mixtapes that were all to be released in 2011 called MIND OF PURRP, SUMMA PHONK VOL.ONE, TRILLUMINATTI, BLVCK MVRDOC, and a collaboration project with Mishka NYC called SON OF EYE.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy5kgFskHUmqHmsrlAiilkKhTzda_3E1P BLVCK MVRDOC | MIND OF PURRP | SON OF EYE | SUMMA PHONK VOL. 1 | TRILLUMINATTI].

In the summer of 2011, SpaceGhostPurrp was also working with fellow rappers [[Speak!]] and [[Juicy J]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/therealjuicyj/status/97924331413307392 juicy j on Twitter: "@SXXXXXXXXXXXXXP yess sirrr! um pullin em up na"].

SpaceGhostPurrp went on to NY in August 2011 to live and work with members from the [[ASAP Mob]]. In late september 2011, SpaceGhostPurrp announced he was dismissing Trilluminatti and now was working on a new mixtape to be called GOD OF BLVCK. This mixtape later dropped in February 2012.

===2012–2013: ''Mysterious Phonk: The Chronicles of SpaceGhostPurrp''===
In early 2012 SpaceGhostPurrp signed a one-off record deal with British [[independent record label|indie]] label 4AD and began remixing tracks from his earlier mix tapes for his debut album. Most of his early songs feature samples from sources such as train whistles, female porn stars, and drops from the soundtrack of the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' video game, as well as other video game series.<ref name="youtube1"/> In addition to his own songs, he also produces beats for other artists (mostly those in the Raider Klan), but has made beats for other people as well. He produced one track titled ''T.A.P.'' for [[Taylor Allderdice (mixtape)|Taylor Allderdice]], a mixtape by [[Wiz Khalifa]] as well as "Keep it G" & "Pretty Flacko" for [[ASAP Rocky]].

His debut album, titled ''[[Mysterious Phonk: Chronicles of SpaceGhostPurrp]]'', was released on June 12, 2012, and consists of mostly remixed tracks from previous mixtapes. He occasionally worked with rapper Juicy J and has produced a number of tracks from Juicy J's "Blue Dream & Lean". He also guest stars on Juicy J's "Deez Bitches Rollin'" with rapper fellow Speakz. SpaceGhostPurrp also featured on [[Domo Genesis]]'s & [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]]'s debut collaboration album "[[No Idols]]" on the track "Daily News" (also featuring [[Earl Sweatshirt]] & [[Action Bronson]]), as well as [[Freddie Gibbs]]' "Kush Cloud" along with [[Krayzie Bone]]. 

SpaceGhostPurrp revealed in an interview<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2012/06/18/spaceghostpurrp-talks-new-album-new-sound.html|title= SpaceGhostPurrp talks new sound, new album |website= [[BET]] |date= June 18, 2012 |access-date= September 17, 2012}}</ref> that there is an upcoming project between him and rap group [[OFWGKTA|Odd Future]], which has supported him by playing his music at shows since he released the mixtape ''BLACKLAND RADIO 66.6''.
On July 16, 2012, SpaceGhostPurrp began his first tour with hardcore punk band [[Trash Talk (band)|Trash Talk]]. The mini tour lasted from July 16 to 23rd - performing four shows in California, one in Oregon, and two in Washington.

===2014–2015: ''Intoxxxicated'' and other projects===
On January 19, 2014, SpaceGhostPurrp released a compilation titled ''58 Blunts of Purrp'', consisting of his own songs, hard to find tracks, and some he either produced or had a feature on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.datpiff.com/Purrp-SpaceGhostPurrp-58-Blunts-Of-Purrp-Compilation-Mixtape.573356.html |title=Mixtape Not Found |publisher=Datpiff.com |access-date=2015-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209055538/http://www.datpiff.com/Purrp-SpaceGhostPurrp-58-Blunts-Of-Purrp-Compilation-Mixtape.573356.html |archive-date=February 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On February 28, 2014, SpaceGhostPurrp released an 18-track mixtape called ''B.M.W. 2: IntoXXXicated'', which included no features and returned to the lo-fi sound of his earlier mixtapes. Subsequently, he released a slightly different version of "B.M.W. 2: IntoXXXicated" that had tempos of certain songs changed, and while the overall sound quality was slightly improved it still retained much of the lo-fi qualities as before.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://datpiff.com/SpaceGhostPurrp-IntoXXXicated-mixtape.805554.html |title=IntoXXXicated Mixtape by SpaceGhostPurrp  |publisher=Datpiff.com |access-date=2016-09-26  |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A few months later it was remastered, had some tracks removed, a new track added, and released as an album on iTunes under the name ''IntoXXXicated''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/intoxxxicated/id877748547 |title=iTunes - Music - IntoXXXicated by SpaceGhostPurrp |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2014-05-27 |access-date=2015-08-29}}</ref>

Early in 2015, SpaceGhostPurrp released two new projects, the first of which was titled ''Dark Angel'' and released on January 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spaceghostpurrp.bandcamp.com/album/dark-angel-project-part-1|title=Dark Angel Project Part 1.|access-date=January 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128172107/http://spaceghostpurrp.bandcamp.com/album/dark-angel-project-part-1 |archive-date=January 28, 2015 }}</ref> The second project, a 5-track EP called ''Money Mendoza'' was released on January 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/SPACEGHOSTPURRP-MONEY-MENDOZA-mixtape.684574.html |title=Mixtape Not Found |publisher=Datpiff.com |access-date=2015-08-29}}</ref> Later that year, SpaceGhostPurrp left Miami, and moved to Atlanta, where he made music with artists such as Father and OG Maco. In April 2015, SpaceGhostPurrp released two compilations. 

One was titled ''VENENO'', it being an extended version of the EP released earlier that year, and the other was titled ''PYRO Era'', consisting mostly of loose tracks released in 2014 and 2015. On the 9th of May, a new EP called ''Richest Revenge'' under the moniker, Money Mendoza, was released through his Instagram account. In May 2015, Raider Klan released ''Raider Klan Records: The Mixtape'' which featured some production and vocals from SpaceGhostPurrp. 

On June 24, 2015, Dej Loaf released a song featuring Young Thug titled "Shawty", co-produced by Young Roc which featured a sample of the song "RAIDER PRAYER"'s instrumental off of SpaceGhostPurrp's album ''Mysterious Phonk: The Chronicles of SPACEGHOSTPURRP''. SpaceGhostPurrp was uncredited by the producer resulting in a minor conflict via Twitter which was soon resolved peacefully.

===2016–present: ''Blackland Radio 66.6 2 and 3''===

On May 9, 2016, SpaceGhostPurrp released a mixtape entitled ''Blackland Radio 66.6 Pt. 2.'' exclusively on Datpiff. He had stated that he had plans to release subsequent volumes under Part 2, but eventually opted to skip straight to the release of Blackland Radio 3 on March 4, 2018.

As 2016 concluded, ''[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]'' recognized SpaceGhostPurrp's Black Money Boys Death Row (BMB) collective as one of its favorite labels for 2016, noting that:<ref>{{cite web|title=2016: Favorite Labels|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/2016-favorite-labels|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|access-date=8 January 2017}}</ref>

{{quote|text=BMB’s sound is a sinister twist on the MySpace-era material churned out by [[Soulja Boy]] and [[Lil B]], tinged with [[Glo Gang]]’s hazy drill hedonism. Affiliates’ discographies are often spread across multiple SoundCloud accounts, hosted by friends, buried in prolific back catalogues, and are sometimes deleted days after their conception. To follow BMB Death Row is to keep their web presence under constant surveillance or risk missing out on a clutch new cut.}}

In early 2017,  SpaceGhostPurrp signed a deal with label Yeah We On Entertainment, LLC, with the label distributing previously released works by SpaceGhostPurrp under its name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yeah We On Entertainment, LLC. - Artists & Releases – artistxite.co.uk|url=https://artistxite.co.uk/label/Yeah-We-On-Entertainment-LLC|website=artistxite|access-date=15 March 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref>

== Influences ==
SpaceGhostPurrp has listed many artists as an influence, which include [[Kanye West]], [[Wiz Khalifa]], [[Gucci Mane]], [[Poison Clan]], [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.okayplayer.com/news/spaceghostpurrp-mysterious-phonk-interview-trayvon-trill-porn.html|title=The Okayplayer Interview: SpaceGhostPurrp Reveals The Mysteries of Phonk - Okayplayer|date=August 31, 2012}}</ref> [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[UGK]], [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]], [[Big L]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], and [[DJ Screw]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.4ad.com/artists/spaceghostpurrp| title= SpaceGhostPurrp|access-date=June 29, 2012}}</ref>

He has collaborated with many of his influences, namely Juicy J on his mixtape "Blue Dream & Lean" released in 2012. SpaceGhostPurrp often attributes his dark "[[phonk]]" sound to the dangerous and violent environment he grew up around in Carol City which he refers to as "Blackland", linking it with his references to hell, and the satanic symbolism in his critically acclaimed mixtape [[Blackland Radio 66.6]]. 

He as well as other Raider Klan members have made references to the shooting of Trayvon Martin, and he has made a tribute song titled "No Evidence" which was released on his album "Mysterious Phonk: The Chronicles of SpaceGhostPurrp". SpaceGhostPurrp has also stated he is a big fan of extreme metal bands such as [[Meshuggah]].

His name is derived from that of the [[Space Ghost|central character]] of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s 1966 TV series ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'' and its 1994 parody talk show spinoff ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''.

== Personal life ==
In a [[YouTube]] stream on August 25, 2019 that was later re-uploaded, SpaceGhostPurrp addressed that he is on the [[autism spectrum]].<ref>{{cite web |title=SpaceGhostPurrp Opens Up About His Mental Disabilities|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLkO7zfRNww|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
In late 2011, [[ASAP Yams]], an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] artist and co-founder of the then-independent [[ASAP Mob]] artist collective, discovered SpaceGhostPurrp and his music through [[Tumblr]]. Yams told SpaceGhostPurrp he enjoyed his ''[[Blackland Radio 66.6]]'' mixtape and invited him to join up with [[ASAP Mob]] in New York City. SpaceGhostPurrp began producing music for ASAP Rocky who was a big fan of SpaceGhostPurrp's music, including "Keep it G" from Rocky's breakout mixtape, ''[[Live. Love. ASAP|Live. Love. A$AP]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/albums/live+love+aap|title=Album Search for "live love asap"|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> 

SpaceGhostPurrp and ASAP Mob remained friends until SpaceGhostPurrp had an argument with ASAP Twelvyy on Twitter in December 2011. This led to Rocky dissing Raider Klan on a song called "Yao Ming (Remix)". That release from Rocky furthered the Twitter fight between SpaceGhostPurrp and ASAP Mob, but the fight was short lived when other ASAP Mob members spoke for SpaceGhostPurrp's sake. 

About a week afterward, Rocky dropped "Pretty Flacko" as a shout-out to the Trillwave genre and SpaceGhostPurrp. SpaceGhostPurrp and ASAP Mob members were on good terms again up until April 2012 when ASAP Mob played an unreleased SpaceGhostPurrp track at Coachella, leading to another short-lived argument ending on bad terms, this time between SpaceGhostPurrp and ASAP Yams. Through the rest of 2012 and early 2013, ASAP Mob used some of SpaceGhostPurrp's music production without giving him credit to make the tracks "I Need Money" (which later became "Max Julien") and "Suddenly" by ASAP Rocky.

The feud was quiet and they seemed to be on good terms until former Raider Klan member Stoops was assaulted by [[ASAP Twelvyy]]<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=HAM ON EVERYTHING|title=SpaceGhostPurrp Talks Raider Klan, BMB, ASAP, Yams, Florida & More|date=2017-07-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abV5meYcvBc|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> in June 2012. This caused the feud between SpaceGhostPurrp and Twelvyy to reach its peak and eventually extend to the entirety of Raider Klan and ASAP Mob. The feud quickly turned physical in November 2012 when affiliates of Raider Klan alongside SpaceGhostPurrp attacked members of ASAP Mob outside Miami. This led to ASAP Nast calling the police and SpaceGhostPurrp being arrested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/11/spaceghostpurrp-arrested-after-raider-klanaap-mob-confrontation|title=SpaceGhostPurrp Arrested After Raider Klan/A$AP Mob Confrontation|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/01/spaceghostpurrp-soundcloud-interview|title=SpaceGhostPurrp Opens Up About His Beef With A$AP Mob|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> 

In March 2013, SpaceGhostPurrp and affiliates once again attacked ASAP Mob in their home city of New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MATTSTOOPS/status/316414848168755200|title=@Richie2koolRMS rocky dont never come out lmaoo|last=MATTFUCKINSTOOPS|date=2013-03-25|website=@MATTSTOOPS|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> The feud quickly began to die down in terms of aggression and took to social media. According to SpaceGhostPurrp, the feud with ASAP Mob was resolved before the death of ASAP Yams in 2015, but ASAP Bari prevented SpaceGhostPurrp and ASAP from reuniting, thus perpetuating the conflict.<ref name=":0" />
