Glocca Morra was formed in 2009 in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] by Zack Schwartz and JP Casanova, who attended high school together and played  in the band Set Fire To Failure. The band released their first full-length album, ''The Working Bones, A Health Decline'' on Livid Records with Arik Dayan on drums and Ruben Gallego on second guitar and synthesizers.<ref name="punknews">{{cite web|last1=Shultz|first1=Brian|title=The Working Bones, A Health Decline (2009)|url=https://www.punknews.org/review/8763/glocca-morra-the-working-bones-a-health-decline|publisher=[[PunkNews]]|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> According to Schwartz, he and JP met Dayan because he was their substitute teacher once in high school.
