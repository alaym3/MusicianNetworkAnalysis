She was raised in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], and graduated from the [[University of Waterloo]] with a degree in [[environmental studies]] in the early-mid 1990s.<ref name="WRR2008" />

Dale's musical passion began with taking [[piano]] lessons and writing poetry as a child. This early exposure led to a familiarity with a wide variety of classical and folk instruments.<ref name="CornishCanadian" />

== Career ==
At the age of eighteen, while a student at the University of Waterloo,<ref name="WRR2008" /> she discovered Medievalism through the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], and began composing songs inspired by Arthurian legend and other fantasy books she had grown up enjoying. Soon after, she began going to [[science fiction convention]]s in [[Toronto]], and there found a welcoming community. She made her very first recordings in 1992, and released her first album ''The Trial of Lancelot'' in 2000. ''Trial'' included her most popular song, "Mordred's Lullaby", which went viral after release and counted over twenty million views on YouTube as of August 2020.<ref name="CornishCanadian" />

As a teenager, she developed aspirations of living an independent, entrepreneurial life, modelled after what she could see [[Loreena McKennitt]] doing with her career.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Strecker|first=James|date=April 23, 2019|title=HEATHER DALE: CELTIC SINGER-SONGWRITER DESCRIBES 20TH CD: “SPHERE FOCUSES ON STORIES OF WOMEN BREAKING FREE FROM SILENCE — THEY FIND THEIR OWN POWER, THEIR OWN VOICE….: LAYERING THE OLD WITH THE NEW MAKES ME FEEL CONNECTED TO MY CELTIC ROOTS, EVEN AS I’M LIVING MY LIFE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. ….

Since around 2005, Dale has worked closely with multi-instrumentalist Ben Deschamps, who has co-written and co-produced with her for much of her career, as well as performing and touring with her as duo and as part of the "Heather Dale Band" (occasionally the "Heather Dale Trio") and providing instrumentation on her recordings.<ref name="Chronicle-Guide March 2018" /><ref name="CelticHeritage">

In analyzing Dale's portrayal of [[the Lady of Shalott]] in her song "Lily Maid", scholar Ann F. Howey notes that "in many of Dale's songs, the lyrics function as a dramatic monologue, so that Dale as a singer "speaks" in the persona of a particular character."<ref name="Afterlives">

Dale's early album ''The Trial of Lancelot'' (1999, with songs written between 1996 and 1999), features instrumentation that includes piano, guitars, flute, fiddle, cello, and various kinds of drums.

|text="The Lily Maid" consists of Elaine of Astolat's instructions to [[Lancelot]]. In "The Trial of Lancelot," various [[Knights of the Round Table|knights]] speak about Lancelot's guilt and fate, each one influenced by his own relationship to the knight; Lancelot's replies make up the chorus. In "Miles to Go," Guenevere voices her thoughts as she chooses to enter a nunnery. "The [[Prydwen]] Sails Again" is a song about the quest to [[Caer Sidi|Caer Siddi]]. "[[Mordred]]'s Lullaby" is a haunting, disturbing lullaby sung by Morgan (here Mordred's mother) as she trains him from the cradle to seek revenge. "Hawthorn Tree" is the story of [[Merlin]] and [[Lady of the Lake|Vivian]], while "Culhwch and Olwen" retells that story [ie the story of ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'']. "Tarnished Silver" is a song about Lancelot and Guenevere years later. The last song, "Measure of a Man," is about [[King Arthur|Arthur]]'s death.}}

''May Queen'' (2003) also uses Arthurian legend as its primary subject matter. She re-recorded most of the songs from ''Trial'' and ''May Queen'' in her later album ''Avalon'' (2010).<ref name="Arthuriana" /><ref name="Afterlives" />{{Sup|:122}}

''Call the Names'' (2001) has much barer instrumentation than ''Trial'', and according to the BBC features "humorous and poignant" songs inspired by the everyday challenges of Renaissance life.<ref name="CornishCanadian" />

''This Endris Night'' (2002) is a collection of medieval Christmas music, including [[This Endris Night|the titular song]].<ref name="CornishCanadian" /> ''This Endris Night'' also includes a trilingual version of the "[[Huron Carol]]", a seventeenth century carol composed by [[Jesuit missionaries|Jesuit missionary]] [[Jean de Brébeuf]] at [[Sainte-Marie among the Hurons]]. Dale sings the song in [[Wyandot language|Wyandot]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]].<ref>

According to [[Alan M. Kent]]'s 2007 essay "Towards a History of Popular Music in Cornwall, 1967–2007", Dale's music is "explicitly 'Celtic' and keenly [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] and [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] in theme." Kent identifies Dale as infusing Cornish popular music with "ethereal and soaring female vocalization," placing her in a genre also occupied by artists including [[Mary Black]], Loreena McKennitt, [[Maire Brennan]], and [[Enya]]. Despite Dale's inspiration by the Society for Creative Anachronism, Kent notes that throughout both ''The Trial of Lancelot'' and ''May Queen'', she makes use of Cornish historical literary material, for instance the story of [[Tristan and Iseult]] (recounted in her song "Tristan and Isolt" on ''May Queen'').<ref name="AlanMKent" /> She likewise draws on specifically Welsh stories. Her song about the legend of Culhwch and Olwen is, according to a 2011 essay by Megan MacAlystre, "one of only a handful of musical settings of the tale to be found", and is "among the most readily available"-- the long legend of "how Culhwch won Olwen" is shortened into a "jaunty" five minute-long song that stands out from what MacAlystre calls identifies as more familiar tales on the ''Trial of Lancelot'' album.<ref>

''The Road to Santiago'' (2005) extends beyond the Celtic styles of her earlier albums, and includes influences from "[[jazz]], [[art song]], [[Sea shanty|shanties]], Spanish/North African rhythms and modal melodies, [[Medieval music|medieval court music]] and contemporary [[Pop music|pop]] balladry," according to a review in the [[Toronto Star]].<ref name="TSRoots" /> ''The Road to Santiago'' also features the song "Sedna", a retelling of the [[Inuit]] creation myth involving the goddess [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]] that includes archival recordings of [[Inuit throat singing]].<ref name="CelticHeritage" />

Her song "The Maiden and the Selkie" (from ''The Green Knight'' (2009)) is an example of her drawing on Norse and Celtic folklore, both in style (as a sea shanty) and subject matter (the song is about a romance between a woman and a male [[Selkie]]).<ref>
