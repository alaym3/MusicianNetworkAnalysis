'''Angels & Airwaves''' (also written as '''Angels and Airwaves'''; stylized and abbreviated as '''ΛVΛ''') is an American rock band,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fuse.tv/2016/05/angels-airwaves-warped-tour-world-supergroup|title=How Angels and Airwaves Became the Only Scene Supergroup|date=May 23, 2016|access-date=August 23, 2017|author=Maria Sherman|publisher=[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]}}</ref> comprising [[Tom DeLonge]] (lead vocals, guitars, keyboards), [[David Kennedy (guitarist)|David Kennedy]] (guitars, keyboards), [[Ilan Rubin]] (drums, keyboards, backing vocals), and Matt Rubano (bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals). Former members include [[Ryan Sinn]] (bass guitar, backing vocals), [[Adam Willard|Adam "Atom" Willard]] (drums), [[Matt Wachter]] (bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and [[Eddie Breckenridge]] (bass guitar).

The band formed after [[Blink-182]] went on hiatus in 2005. They continued to record and tour despite DeLonge reigniting his career with Blink-182 in 2009, and after DeLonge subsequently parted with Blink-182 in 2015, he began to focus on Angels & Airwaves more extensively. To date, the band has released six studio albums: ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper]]'' (2006), ''[[I-Empire]]'' (2007), ''[[Love (Angels & Airwaves album)|Love]]'' (2010), ''[[Love: Part Two]]'' (2011), ''[[The Dream Walker]]'' (2014) and ''[[Lifeforms (Angels & Airwaves album)|Lifeforms]]'' (2021). The project also resulted in the documentary film ''[[Start the Machine (film)|Start the Machine]]'' (2008). In 2011, accompanying the two ''Love'' albums, the group scored and produced the [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[Love (2011 film)|Love]]'' by director [[William Eubank]] in 460 theatres nationwide during their multimedia event, [[Angels & Airwaves Presents Love Live|Love Live]]. The band released an animated short named ''[[Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker]]''<ref name="alterthepress6-6-2014">{{cite web|url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2014/06/atp-feature-tom-delonge-talks-to-stars.html |last=Ableson |first=Jon |title=ATP!

Other related media, such as comic books and a live-action film, followed in 2015.

The group has been described by DeLonge as more than a band, but more accurately "an [[Art group|art project]] [that approaches] larger [[Theme (literature)|human themes]] and tackles them in [[Media (communication)|different mediums]]", or simply "a multimedia project".<ref name="illinoisentertainer">{{cite web |url=http://illinoisentertainer.com/2011/08/cover-story-blink-182/comment-page-1/ |title=Cover Story: Blink-182 – Everything Hits At Once |author=Steve Forstneger |date=August 1, 2011 |work=Illinois Entertainer: In Print and Online |publisher=Illinois Entertainer |access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref> This has been seen in the group's films, live events, and novel approach to fan-artist interaction.<ref name="signonsan-film">{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/aug/08/tom-delonge-discusses-angels-airwaves-debut-film/ |title=Tom DeLonge discusses Angels & Airwaves' debut film |author=George Varga |date=August 8, 2011 |work=[[U-T San Diego]] |access-date=August 10, 2011| quote=I always thought that when a band creates a concept record, it seems to live and die in a period of a year.

Of the first two albums, the band says that they were mainly influenced by the music of [[Radiohead]] and [[Pink Floyd]], combining them with the grandiosity of [[U2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/music/features/angels-and-airwaves_0606.htm |title=Angels & Airwaves |work=musicOMH |access-date=November 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907041552/http://www.musicomh.com/music/features/angels-and-airwaves_0606.htm |archive-date=September 7, 2011 }}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and origins (2004–2005)===
Tom DeLonge began working on new material during Blink-182's final tour in 2004 and shortly after they began their break in February 2005. For half a year he worked alone in his home studio before gathering musicians to form the band. Upon fiddling randomly for several weeks with the band's logo, DeLonge realized that if he were to invert the middle "A" of the band's acronym into what appeared to be a "V", he would have the name of his daughter, Ava. As rumors were floating around about the band's "break-up", DeLonge chose to abstain for six months from any interviews surrounding the issue and his future plans; instead he concentrated on writing and recording in his home-based studio. In September 2005, he finally spoke publicly in ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine, where he unveiled the name of his new band, Angels & Airwaves. The band included former [[Hazen Street]] guitarist and high-school friend [[David Kennedy (guitarist)|David Kennedy]], former [[Rocket from the Crypt]] and [[The Offspring]] drummer [[Atom Willard]] and former [[The Distillers]] bass guitarist [[Ryan Sinn]]. Atom Willard told ''[[Shave (magazine)|Shave]]'' magazine that the experience of all the members of the band made the band formation very easy. "There's nobody trying to figure out what is and what isn't going to work, not just for themselves but for music and for a band, what life's going to be like on the road and all that kind of stuff. Everybody had enough experience to just buckle down and do the work. It really has made it easier than anything else."<ref name="shavemagazine">{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/angels-and-airwaves-adam-atom-willard |title=Interview: Atom Willard |publisher=ShaveMagazine.com |first=Match |last=Stevens |access-date=July 8, 2011}}</ref>

===''We Don't Need to Whisper'' (2005–2007)===
[[File:Angels and Airwaves (Hyde Park).jpg|thumb|Angels & Airwaves performing at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in June 2006.]]
Soon after forming, the band began recording its first album in DeLonge's studio in California from mid-2005 to early 2006. However, after a fan e-mail hacked DeLonge and stole four demos, Angels & Airwaves had no other choice but to release "[[The Adventure]]" as their first single, which was leaked onto radio stations, causing a premature release on May 18, 2006. A few days later, on May 23, they released their first album, ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper]]''. The album reached No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard 200, and went gold in both the US and Canada. Despite this success, critics gave generally mixed reviews, with one noting that "while well-intentioned [the band] failed to reach the lofty heights to which they aspire", especially in light of claims made by DeLonge that the album would be "the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1509766/blinks-tom-delonge-promises-the-greatest-rock-and-roll-revolution/|title=Blink's Tom DeLonge Promises 'The Greatest Rock And Roll Revolution'|publisher=MTV News|access-date=August 29, 2017}}</ref> Yet, later that year, popularity picked up with the release of singles "[[The War (Angels & Airwaves song)|The War]]", "[[Do It For Me Now]]" and "[[It Hurts (Angels & Airwaves song)|It Hurts]]". The remainder of the year into 2007 was taken up with tours, and in early 2007, the supergroup returned to the studio to work on a follow-up album.

However, problems accumulated and on April 23, 2007, Angels & Airwaves announced that Ryan Sinn would not play at the Free Earth Day concert at the [[M.I.T.]] campus due to difficulties within the band. Following this incident, on May 15, Sinn posted on the Army of Angels fan club message board stating that he was "no longer a part of Angels & Airwaves" and had received a call on the evening of April 19 concluding his relationship with the band. [[Matt Wachter]] (the former bassist of [[30 Seconds to Mars]]), filled in for the show and was later confirmed as a permanent member.

===''I-Empire'' (2007–2009)===
The second studio album, titled ''[[I-Empire]]'' and the first song "[[Everything's Magic]]" were leaked to the Internet, and on August 25, 2007, it was the most requested song on California radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]]. Angels & Airwaves began streaming the song on their [[MySpace]] profile on August 28, 2007. It also became available on [[iTunes]], and reached number three on the iTunes Rock Chart on September 11, 2007, before the song was even made available for nationwide airplay. The band recorded the video for the single on January 20 and 21, and it was premiered on [[MTV2]] Unleashed on February 25, 2008. Their second single "Secret Crowds" was released on February 4, 2008, along with an accompanying video. The band released a third single, "Breathe", that was released onto the Internet on June 20.

Angels & Airwaves performed at every location on [[Warped Tour 2008]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?p=8574076#post8574076 |title=Chat: Kevin Lyman |publisher=Absolutepunk.net |access-date=August 10, 2011| archive-url= https://archive.today/20110723002440/http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?p=8574076| archive-date= July 23, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> They also made a fall tour in support of [[Weezer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/08/05/weezer-announce-tour-with-angels-and-airwaves-tokyo-police-club/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809180557/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/08/05/weezer-announce-tour-with-angels-and-airwaves-tokyo-police-club/|url-status=dead|title=Weezer Announce Tour With Angels & Airwaves, Tokyo Police Club|archive-date=August 9, 2008}}</ref> DeLonge revealed that during the duration of the first two albums, he was addicted to painkillers due to suffering a [[Spinal disc herniation|slipped disc]] in his back some years prior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2007/11/15/exclusive-tom-delonge-talks-about-blink-182-and-being-spun-out-while-building-an-empire/ |title=Exclusive: Tom DeLonge Talks About Blink-182 And Being 'Spun Out' While Building An 'Empire' |publisher=MTV |date=November 15, 2007 |access-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref>

The band took a break from performing in 2009 while DeLonge reunited with Blink-182 for a summer tour. During their time off, Atom Willard joined [[Social Distortion]] as touring drummer, while Matt Wachter and David Kennedy began work on the upcoming film.

===''Love'' and ''Love Album: Part Two'' (2009–2012)===
When DeLonge and Willard returned in the fall, the band resumed production of its next album. ''[[Love (Angels & Airwaves album)|Love]]'' is the third studio album by Angels and Airwaves, which was officially released worldwide on February 14, 2010, after being delayed from Christmas 2009. [[Fox Sports 2#History|Fuel TV]] also released it two days earlier for [[Modlife]] members, along with Mark Hoppus' remix of "Hallucinations" available to those who donated when downloading the album.<ref>[http://modlife.com/angelsandairwaves/lovealbumfueltv ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215122917/http://modlife.com/angelsandairwaves/lovealbumfueltv |date=February 15, 2010 }}</ref> The album was released free of charge due to "corporate underwriting". They began producing it in January 2009 but progress was slow due to Blink-182 reuniting and going on tour. The band finished the album in time for its release on Valentine's Day 2010. ''Love'' was downloaded nearly 500,000 times during the first 48 hours after its release day.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The first single from the album, "Hallucinations", was made available for free through the band's Modlife on December 23, 2009. The band also released the video via Modlife on March 7, 2010.

The band toured North America, starting on March 27 in Anaheim, California. The tour ended on May 30 in [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], California, and DeLonge returned to Blink-182 to prepare for their upcoming album and European tour. DeLonge originally revealed that there would be another tour, rumored to have UK dates, after the release of the [[Love (2011 film)|''Love'' film]] in the autumn, but plans were changed due to DeLonge's commitments with Blink-182.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959289/angels-airwaves-delonge-talks-love-tour-movie |title=Angels & Airwaves' DeLonge Talks 'Love' Tour, Movie |work=Billboard |date=September 14, 2009 |access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref> "Epic Holiday" is on the soundtrack to the German film ''[[Kokowääh]]'' with [[Til Schweiger]].

Before the release of ''Love: Part II'', DeLonge revealed that Angels & Airwaves had already begun working on two new albums and two corresponding films. On October 4, it was announced on their Facebook page that drummer Atom Willard had left the band. The departure seemed to be a mutual understanding and Atom thanked the members of Angels & Airwaves for a great six years of making music together.<ref>{{cite web| last = Common| first = Tyler| title = Angels & Airwaves working on two more movies| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = August 14, 2011| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/angels_airwaves_working_on_two_more_movies| access-date = August 16, 2011}}</ref> On October 7, it was announced that Angels & Airwaves would be part of the lineup for the [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave Festival]] in Australia, in February and March 2012.

On November 9, 2012, a new EP bundle pack titled ''[[Stomping the Phantom Brake Pedal]]'' was announced as limited pressing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152218464400144&set=a.144012620143.232344.12431865143&type=1|title=Timeline Photos – Angels and Airwaves |via=Facebook}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=May 2019}}

===''The Dream Walker'' (2014–2016)===
On April 1, 2014, Tom DeLonge announced via his official Facebook page that the band's fifth album would be released on October 31, 2014. The announcement came with another still from the ''POET'' film depicting a futuristic city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/officialtomdelonge/photos/a.161059613916386.30214.161055970583417/714394638582878/?type=1&relevant_count=1|title=Tom DeLonge – Timeline Photos |via=Facebook}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=May 2019}} In an interview with ''Alter The Press!'' published on June 6, 2014, DeLonge confirmed the scheduled release date and says of the album: "There are things that will never change, like my melodic sensibility and the way that I write. But the song structures, arrangements, chord progressions and tonalities have all changed radically."<ref name="alterthepress6-6-2014" />
This came in the wake of recent reflections in the nature of the previous albums. DeLonge felt it was a needed departure for the band since he felt like everything was beginning to sound the same.
It was revealed on June 24 that [[Matt Wachter]] had left the band to concentrate on his family. DeLonge posted a message on Facebook explaining that they are still both close friends and that Matt would possibly join them again one day. On July 4, Angels & Airwaves completed filming their new music video for the new single on the album that comes out on Halloween. On July 9, Tom DeLonge confirmed in a photo post on the band's Facebook page that [[Eddie Breckenridge]] (of the post-hardcore band [[Thrice (band)|Thrice]]) had joined Angels & Airwaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/angelsandairwaves/photos/a.144012620143.232344.12431865143/10154334987520144/?type=1 |title=Timeline Photos – Angels & Airwaves|date=July 9, 2014|via=Facebook|access-date=October 8, 2014}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=May 2019}}

A new song from the upcoming album, titled "Paralyzed", was made available for purchase via [[MixRadio]]. Engineer Aaron Rubin confirmed that this version was not yet mastered. He also confirmed that the final version will be released on October 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blastoutyourstereo.com/music/music-news/stream-new-angels-and-airwaves-song-paralyzed-11366|title=Angels & Airwaves Bring The Heat With New Single "Paralyzed"|work=Blast Out Your Stereo|access-date=October 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006145246/http://blastoutyourstereo.com/music/music-news/stream-new-angels-and-airwaves-song-paralyzed-11366|archive-date=October 6, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> DeLonge announced via his Twitter account that "Paralyzed" is not the first single off ''[[The Dream Walker]]''.

In light of recent speculation as to the status of David Kennedy and Eddie Breckenridge with the band, DeLonge confirmed during an interview with Rock Sound on November 11 that both members were still involved with Angels & Airwaves, though he did not specify to what extent, claiming "I think people are just confused. I get it, but I try to tell people to look at the whole project, not at any one piece. This isn't just a band, it's a little bit of a moving target and a much bigger project.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/features/read/tom-delonge-this-has-never-been-done-in-the-history-of-rock-n-roll|title=Tom DeLonge: "This Has Never Been Done In The History Of Rock 'N' Roll."|work=Rock Sound Magazine}}</ref>

On January 28, 2015, the music video for "Tunnels" was released, featuring footage from DeLonge's animated film, ''[[Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker]]''. The video also features David Kennedy and Eddie Breckenridge playing alongside DeLonge and Rubin. There came news that video was finished in July 2014, but was released later, bringing to speculation whether Kennedy and Breckenridge are still in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2015/01/28/angels-and-airwaves-tunnels-video-premiere/|title=Angels and Airwaves premieres half-animated video for 'Tunnels'|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}</ref>
