'''Judy Garland''' (born '''Frances Ethel Gumm'''; June 10, 1922 – June 22, 1969) was an American actress, singer, dancer, [[vaudevillian]] and television and radio presenter. She is widely known for playing the role of [[Dorothy Gale]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).<ref name="Supernova">{{cite news|last=Bayard|first=Louis|date=April 16, 2000|title=Supernova|page=X9|work=Washington Post|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/52656045.html?dids=52656045:52656045&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+16%2C+2000&author=Louis+Bayard&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=Supernova&pqatl=google|url-status=dead|access-date=July 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120090506/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/52656045.html?dids=52656045:52656045&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+16%2C+2000&author=Louis+Bayard&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=Supernova&pqatl=google|archive-date=January 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Brogan|first=Scott|title=The Judy Room – Easter Parade|url=http://www.thejudyroom.com/ep/index.html|website=thejudyroom.com}}</ref> With a career spanning 45 years, she attained international stardom as an actress in both musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist, and on the concert stage.

Garland began performing in vaudeville as a child with her two older sisters, in a vaudeville group "[[#The Gumm/Garland Sisters|The Gumm Sisters]]" and was later signed to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] as a teenager. She appeared in more than two dozen films for MGM. Garland was a frequent on-screen partner of both [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Gene Kelly]] and regularly collaborated with director and second husband [[Vincente Minnelli]]. Other starring roles during this period included ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (1946), ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), and ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950). In 1950, after 15 years with MGM, the studio released her amid a series of personal struggles that prevented her from fulfilling the terms of her contract.

Although her film career became intermittent thereafter, two of Garland's most critically acclaimed roles came later in her career: she received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954) and a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961). She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released [[Judy Garland discography#Studio albums|eight studio albums]], and hosted her own [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated television series, ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' (1963–1964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]], and in 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked her as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|eighth-greatest female screen legend]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood cinema]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx| title= Stars| publisher= American Film Institute| website= AFI.com}}</ref>

Garland struggled in her personal life from an early age. The pressures of early stardom affected her physical and mental health from the time she was a teenager; her self-image was influenced by constant criticism from film executives who believed that she was physically unattractive and who manipulated her onscreen physical appearance.<ref name= Petersen>{{cite book |author1=Petersen, Anne H. |author-link1=Anne Helen Petersen |title=Scandals of Classic Hollywood |date=2014 |publisher=Plume (Penguin) |location=New York |isbn=978-0142180679 |pages=157–78 [164, 166–69] |chapter=10. Judy Garland: Ugly Duckling}}</ref> Throughout her adulthood she was plagued by alcohol and substance use disorders, as well as financial instability, often owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in [[back taxes]]. Her lifelong [[substance use disorder]] ultimately led to her death in London from an accidental [[barbiturate overdose]] at age 47 in 1969.

==Early career==
===The Gumm/Garland Sisters===
[[File:The Gumm Sisters.jpg|thumb|The Gumm Sisters, also known as the Garland Sisters, c. 1935: Top row: Mary Jane and Dorothy Virginia Gumm; bottom: Frances Ethel (Judy Garland) Gumm]]

In 1928, the Gumm Sisters enrolled in a dance school run by Ethel Meglin, proprietress of the [[Meglin Kiddies]] dance troupe. They appeared with the troupe at its annual Christmas show.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|pp=29–30}} Through the Meglin Kiddies, they made their film debut in a short subject called ''The Big Revue'' (1929), where they performed a song-and-dance number called "That's the Good Old Sunny South". This was followed by appearances in two [[Vitaphone]] shorts the following year: ''A Holiday in Storyland'' (featuring Garland's first on-screen solo) and ''The Wedding of Jack and Jill''. They next appeared together in ''[[Bubbles (film)|Bubbles]]''. Their final on-screen appearance was in an MGM [[Technicolor]] short entitled ''[[La Fiesta de Santa Barbara]]'' (1935).{{sfn|Finch|1975|pp=43–47, 76}}

The trio had toured the vaudeville circuit as "The Gumm Sisters" for many years when they performed in Chicago at the [[Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre|Oriental Theater]] with [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] in 1934. He encouraged the group to choose a more appealing name after "Gumm" was met with laughter from the audience. According to theater legend, their act was once erroneously billed at a Chicago theater as "The Glum Sisters".<ref name="nytobit">{{cite news |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/09/specials/garland-obit.html |title=Judy Garland, 47, Found Dead |date=June 23, 1969 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 3, 2018 |quote=critics noted that her voice had lost some of its quality. At the same time they noted that her personality retained its full impact.}}</ref>

Several stories persist regarding the origin of their use of the name Garland. One is that it was originated by Jessel after [[Carole Lombard]]'s character Lily Garland in the film ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934), which was then playing at the [[Nederlander Theatre (Chicago)|Oriental]] in Chicago; another is that the girls chose the surname after drama critic Robert Garland.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Judy: Beyond the Rainbow|series=Biography|series-link=Biography (TV series)|air-date=January 1, 1999}}</ref> Garland's daughter [[Lorna Luft]] stated that her mother selected the name when Jessel announced that the trio "looked prettier than a garland of flowers".{{sfn|Luft|1999|p=26}} A TV special was filmed in Hollywood at the [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]] premiere of ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' on September 29, 1954, in which Jessel stated:

{{Blockquote|I think that I ought to tell the folks that it was I who named Judy Garland, "Judy Garland." Not that it would have made any difference{{spnd}}you couldn't have hid[den] that great talent if you'd called her "Tel Aviv Windsor Shell", you know, but her name when I first met her was Frances Gumm and it wasn't the kind of a name that so sensitive a great actress like that should have;&nbsp;... and so we called her Judy Garland, and I think she's a combination of [[Helen Hayes]] and [[Al Jolson]], and maybe [[Jenny Lind]] and [[Sarah Bernhardt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Star-Born-Disc-Special-DVD/dp/B00006L9X5|title=Pantages Premiere TV Special on disc 2 of A Star is Born DVD|author=Jessel, George|publisher=Warner Home Video}}</ref>}}

A later explanation surfaced when Jessel was a guest on [[The Judy Garland Show|Garland's television show]] in 1963. He said that he had sent actress [[Judith Anderson]] a telegram containing the word "garland" and it stuck in his mind.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 12|series=The Judy Garland Show|air-date=November 1, 1963|season=1|number=12}}</ref> However, Garland asked Jessel just moments later if this story was true, and he blithely replied "No".

By late 1934, the Gumm Sisters had changed their name to the Garland Sisters.<ref>"Program of Comedy Due – Eddie Conrad Will Head Ebell Vaudeville". ''Los Angeles Times''. December 7, 1934. p. 15.</ref> Frances changed her name to "Judy" soon after, inspired by a popular [[Hoagy Carmichael]] song.{{sfn|Edwards|1975|p=27}} The group broke up by August 1935, when Suzanne Garland flew to [[Reno, Nevada]], and married musician Lee Kahn, a member of the Jimmy Davis orchestra playing at [[Cal Neva Lodge & Casino|Cal-Neva Lodge]], Lake Tahoe.<ref>"Nuptials Turn Trio to Duet – Cupid Robs Radio Team – Suzanne Garland Flies to Reno to Become Bride of Musician".

===Signed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
[[File:Love Finds Andy Hardy trailer.JPG|thumb|Garland and [[Mickey Rooney]] in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938)]]
In September 1935, [[Louis B. Mayer]] asked songwriter [[Burton Lane]] to go to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles)|Orpheum Theater]] in downtown Los Angeles to watch the Garland Sisters' vaudeville act and to report to him. A few days later, Judy and her father were brought for an impromptu audition at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]]. Garland performed "[[Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart]]" and "Eli, Eli", a Yiddish song written in 1896 and regularly performed in vaudeville.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/yiddish-musical-theater-in-united-states|title=Yiddish Musical Theater in the United States |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive |access-date=March 27, 2016}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=October 2019|reason=does not mention Judy Garland}} The studio immediately signed Garland to a contract with MGM, presumably without a [[screen test]], though she had made a test for the studio several months earlier. The studio did not know what to do with her; aged thirteen, she was older than the traditional child star, but too young for adult roles.<ref>{{cite book |title=Get happy: the life of Judy Garland |last1=Clarke |first1=Gerald |publisher=Dell |isbn=978-0-307-55633-2 |chapter=Chapter 5: The Men of Her Dreams |date=November 11, 2009 }}</ref>

Her physical appearance was a dilemma for MGM. She was only {{convert|4|ft|11+1/2|in|cm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, and her "cute" or "[[girl-next-door]]" looks did not exemplify the most glamorous persona then required of leading female performers. She was self-conscious and anxious about her appearance. "Judy went to school at Metro with [[Ava Gardner]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], real beauties", said [[Charles Walters]], who directed her in a number of films. "Judy was the big money-maker at the time, a big success, but she was the [[The Ugly Duckling|ugly duckling]]&nbsp;... I think it had a very damaging effect on her emotionally for a long time. I think it lasted forever, really."<ref>{{cite episode |title=Judy: Impressions of Garland |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0813809 |series=Omnibus |air-date=1972}}</ref> Her insecurity was exacerbated by the attitude of studio chief Louis B. Mayer, who referred to her as his "little hunchback".{{sfn|Wayne|2003|p=204}}

During her early years at the studio, she was photographed and dressed in plain garments or frilly juvenile gowns and costumes to match the "girl-next-door" image created for her. They had her wear removable [[Crown (dentistry)|caps]] on her teeth and rubberized discs to reshape her nose.{{sfn|Frank|1975|p=73}} Eventually, on the set of ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' when she was 21 years old, Garland met Dorothy "Dottie" Ponedel, a makeup artist who worked at MGM. After reviewing the additions to her look, Garland was surprised when Ponedel said that the caps and discs that Garland had been using were not needed, as she was "a pretty girl". Ponedel became Garland's makeup artist. The work that Ponedel did on Garland for ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' made Garland so happy that Ponedel became Garland's advisor every time she worked on a film under MGM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/288816%7C0/Behind-the-Camera-Meet-Me-in-St-Louis.html|title=Behind the Camera – Meet Me in St. Louis|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref>

On November 16, 1935, 13-year-old Garland was in the midst of preparing for a radio performance on the ''[[Shell Chateau]]x Hour'' when she learned that her father had been hospitalized with [[meningitis]] and had taken a turn for the worse. Frank Gumm died the following morning at age 49, leaving her devastated.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Frank Avent Gumm (1886-1935) - Find A Grave...|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8689/frank-avent-gumm|access-date=November 27, 2021|website=www.findagrave.com|language=en}}</ref> Her song for the ''Shell Chateau Hour'' was her first professional rendition of "Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart", a song which became a standard in many of her concerts.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=58}}

Garland performed at various studio functions and was eventually cast opposite [[Deanna Durbin]] in the musical-short ''[[Every Sunday]]'' (1936). The film contrasted her vocal range and swing style with Durbin's operatic soprano and served as an extended screen test for them, as studio executives were questioning the wisdom of having two girl singers on the roster.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=73}}

Garland came to the attention of studio executives when she sang a special arrangement of "[[You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)]]" to [[Clark Gable]] at a birthday party that the studio arranged for the actor. Her rendition was so well regarded that she performed the song in the all-star extravaganza ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'' (1937), when she sang to a photograph of him.{{sfn|Edwards|1975|p=47}}
[[File:Judy Garland in Love Finds Andy Hardy trailer.jpg|thumb|Garland in ''Love Finds Andy Hardy'' (1938)]]
MGM hit on a winning formula when it paired Garland with [[Mickey Rooney]] in a string of what were known as "backyard musicals".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=9718 |title=dOc DVD Review: Mickey Rooney & Judy Garland Collection (Babes in Arms/Strike Up the Band/Babes on Broadway/Girl Crazy) (1939–1943) |publisher=Digitallyobsessed.com |date=April 1, 2009 |access-date=April 3, 2010}}</ref> The duo first appeared together as supporting characters in the [[B movie]] ''[[Thoroughbreds Don't Cry]]'' (1937). Garland was then put in the cast of the fourth of the Hardy Family movies as a literal girl-next-door to Rooney's character Andy Hardy, in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938), although Hardy's love interest was played by [[Lana Turner]]. They teamed as lead characters for the first time in ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939), ultimately appearing in five additional films, including Hardy films ''[[Andy Hardy Meets Debutante]]'' (1940) and ''[[Life Begins for Andy Hardy]]'' (1941).

Garland stated that she, Rooney, and other young performers were constantly prescribed [[amphetamine]]s in order to stay awake and keep up with the frantic pace of making one film after another.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bertram|first=Colin|title=Judy Garland Was Put on a Strict Diet and Encouraged to Take "Pep Pills" While Filming 'The Wizard of Oz'|url=https://www.biography.com/news/judy-garland-pills-diet-wizard-of-oz|access-date=November 27, 2021|website=Biography|language=en-us}}</ref> They were also given [[barbiturate]]s to take before going to bed so they could sleep.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Judy Garland: By Myself |series=[[American Masters]] |air-date=February 25, 2004}}</ref> This regular use of drugs, she said, led to addiction and a life-long struggle. She later resented the hectic schedule and believed MGM stole her youth. Rooney, however, denied their studio was responsible for her addiction: "Judy Garland was never given any drugs by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Mr. Mayer didn't sanction anything for Judy. No one on that lot was responsible for Judy Garland's death. Unfortunately, Judy chose that path."<ref name="mgm3">{{cite episode |title=The Lion in Winter |series=MGM: When the Lion Roars |credits=Stewart, Patrick (host)}}</ref>

Garland's weight was within a healthy range, but the studio demanded she constantly diet. They even went so far as to serve her only a bowl of soup and a plate of lettuce when she ordered a regular meal.<ref name= Petersen /> She was plagued with self-doubt throughout her life, despite successful film and recording careers, awards, critical praise, and her ability to fill concert halls worldwide, she required constant reassurance she was talented and attractive.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|pp=135–36}}

===''The Wizard of Oz''===
[[File:The Wizard of Oz Judy Garland 1939.jpg|thumb|Garland in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939)]]
In 1938 when she was sixteen, Garland was cast as the young Dorothy Gale in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939), a film based on the 1900 children's book by [[L. Frank Baum]]. In the film, she sang the song with which she would be constantly identified afterward, "[[Over the Rainbow]]". Although producers [[Arthur Freed]] and [[Mervyn LeRoy]] had wanted to cast her in the role from the beginning, studio chief Mayer first tried to borrow [[Shirley Temple]] from [[20th Century Fox]], but they declined. [[Deanna Durbin]] was then asked, but was unavailable; this resulted in Garland being cast.{{sfn|Juneau|1974|p=37}}

Garland was initially outfitted in a blonde wig for the part, but Freed and LeRoy decided against it shortly into filming. Her blue [[gingham]] dress was chosen for its blurring effect on her figure, which made her look younger.{{sfn|Finch|1975|pp=134–35}} Shooting commenced on October 13, 1938,{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=95}} and it was completed on March 16, 1939,{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=100}} with a final cost of more than US$2&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Edwards|1975|p=61}} With the conclusion of filming, MGM kept Garland busy with promotional tours and the shooting of ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (also 1939), directed by [[Busby Berkeley]]. She and Rooney were sent on a cross-country promotional tour, culminating in the August 17 New York City premiere at the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theater]], which included a five-show-a-day appearance schedule for the two stars.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|pp=102–03}}

Reports of Garland being put on a diet consisting of cigarettes, chicken soup, and coffee are erroneous; as clarified in the book ''The Road to Oz: The Evolution, Creation, and Legacy of a Motion Picture Masterpiece'' by Oz historians Jay Scarfone and William Stillman, at that time in her life Garland was an anti-smoker, and she was allowed solid food. For example, for a main meal she was sometimes allowed to eat a bowl of soup and a plate of lettuce.<ref name= Petersen /> In a further attempt to minimize her curves, her diet was accompanied by swimming and [[hiking]] outings, plus games of [[tennis]] and [[badminton]] with her stunt double Bobbie Koshay.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/11059785/How-Judy-Garland-was-forced-to-starve-herself-for-the-screen.html |title=How Judy Garland was forced to starve herself for the screen |website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

''The Wizard of Oz'' was a tremendous critical success, though its high budget and promotions costs of an estimated $4&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|4|1939|r=1}} million in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), coupled with the lower revenue that was generated by discounted children's tickets, meant that the film did not return a profit until it was re-released in the 1940s and on subsequent occasions.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=104}} At the [[12th Academy Awards|1939 Academy Awards]] ceremony, Garland received her only [[Academy Award]], an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] for her performances in 1939, including ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms''. She was the fourth person to receive the award as well as only one of twelve in history to ever be presented with one.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=105}}

==Adult stardom==
[[File:Judy Garland in Meet Me in St Louis trailer 2.jpg|thumb|Garland sings "The Trolley Song" in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944)]]
Garland starred in three films released in 1940: ''[[Andy Hardy Meets Debutante]]'', ''[[Strike Up the Band (film)|Strike Up the Band]]'', and ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]''. In the last, she played her first adult role, a dual role of both mother and daughter. ''Little Nellie Kelly'' was purchased from [[George M. Cohan]] as a vehicle for her to display both her audience appeal and her physical appearance. The role was a challenge for her, requiring the use of an accent, her first adult kiss, and the only death scene of her career.{{sfn|Juneau|1974|pp=55–56}} Her co-star [[George Murphy]] regarded the kiss as embarrassing. He said it felt like "a hillbilly with a child bride".<ref name= Petersen />

During this time, Garland was still in her teens when she experienced her first serious adult romance with bandleader [[Artie Shaw]]. She was deeply devoted to him and was devastated in early 1940 when he eloped with [[Lana Turner]].{{sfn|Frank|1975|pp=148–49}} Garland began a relationship with musician [[David Rose (songwriter)|David Rose]], and on her 18th birthday, he gave her an engagement ring. The studio intervened because, at the time, he was still married to actress and singer [[Martha Raye]]. They agreed to wait a year to allow for his divorce to become final. During that time, Garland had a brief affair with songwriter [[Johnny Mercer]]. After her break-up with Mercer, Garland and Rose were wed on July 27, 1941.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=155}} "A true rarity" is what media called it.<ref name= Petersen /> The couple agreed to a [[trial separation]] in January 1943, and divorced in 1944.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=211}}
[[File:Judy Garland in Presenting Lily Mars.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Garland was given the Hollywood "glamor treatment" for [[Presenting Lily Mars]] (1943)]]
In 1941, Garland had an abortion while pregnant with Rose's child at the insistence of her mother and the studio since the pregnancy wasn't approved. She had a second one in 1943 when she became pregnant from her affair with [[Tyrone Power]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/07/classic-hollywood-abortion|title=Classic Hollywood's Secret: Studios Wanted Their Stars to Have Abortions|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|access-date=May 27, 2019}}</ref>

In her next film, ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]'' (1942), Garland performed with [[Gene Kelly]] in his first screen appearance. She was given the "glamor treatment" in ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'' (1943), in which she was dressed in "grown-up" gowns. Her lightened hair was also pulled up in a stylish fashion. However, no matter how glamorous or beautiful she appeared on screen or in photographs, she was never confident in her appearance and never escaped the "girl-next-door" image that the studio had created for her.{{sfn|Frank|1975|p=175}}

One of Garland's most successful films for MGM was ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), in which she introduced three standards: "[[The Trolley Song]]", "[[The Boy Next Door (song)|The Boy Next Door]]", and "[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]". This was one of the first films in her career that gave her the opportunity to be the attractive leading lady. [[Vincente Minnelli]] was assigned to direct, and he requested that make-up artist Dorothy Ponedel be assigned to Garland. Ponedel refined her appearance in several ways, including extending and reshaping her eyebrows, changing her hairline, modifying her lip line and removing her nose discs and dental caps. She appreciated the results so much that Ponedel was written into her contract for all her remaining pictures at MGM.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

At this time, Garland had a brief affair with film director [[Orson Welles]], who at that time was married to [[Rita Hayworth]]. The affair ended in early 1945, and they remained on good terms afterwards.<ref>{{cite book|title=Orson Welles: A Biography|last=Leaming|first=Barbara|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0879101997|publisher=Limelight|orig-year=1985|year=2004}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2019}}

During the filming of ''Meet Me in St. Louis'', Garland and Minnelli had some initial conflict between them, but they entered into a relationship and married on June 15, 1945.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hopper|first=Hedda|author-link=Hedda Hopper|title=No More Tears for Judy|work=[[Woman's Home Companion]] |date=September 1954}}</ref> On March 12, 1946, daughter [[Liza Minnelli|Liza]] was born.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=223}} The couple divorced by 1951.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judy Garland Files Suit for Divorce|publisher=U.P.|date=February 22, 1952}}</ref>

''[[The Clock (1945 film)|The Clock]]'' (1945) was Garland's first straight dramatic film; [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]] was cast in the main male role. Though the film was critically praised and earned a profit, most movie fans expected her to sing. She did not act again in a non-singing dramatic role for many years. Garland's other films of the 1940s include ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (1946), in which she introduced the Academy Award-winning song "[[On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe]]", and ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946).<ref>{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/25018|access-date=November 27, 2021|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>

==Last MGM motion pictures==
In April 1948, during filming for ''[[The Pirate (1948 film)|The Pirate]]'', Garland suffered a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and was placed in a private [[sanatorium]].{{sfn|Edwards|1975|p=108}} She was able to complete filming, but in July she made her first suicide attempt, making minor cuts to her wrist with a broken glass.{{sfn|Frank|1975|p=231}} During this period, she spent two weeks in treatment at the [[Austen Riggs Center]], a psychiatric hospital in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/judy-garland/career-timeline/601/ |title=Judy Garland – Career Timeline &#124; American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=July 7, 2004 |access-date=April 3, 2010}}</ref>

''The Pirate'' was released in May 1948 and was the first film in which Garland had starred since ''The Wizard of Oz'' not to make a profit. The main reasons for its failure were not only its cost, but also the increasing expense of the shooting delays while Garland was ill, as well as the general public's unwillingness to accept her in a sophisticated film. Following her work on ''The Pirate'', she co-starred for the first and only time with [[Fred Astaire]] (who replaced Gene Kelly after Kelly had broken his ankle) in ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), which became her top-grossing film at MGM.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[File:TillTheClouds3.jpg|thumb|Garland in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]

Thrilled by the huge box-office receipts of ''Easter Parade'', MGM immediately teamed Garland and Astaire in ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]''. During the initial filming, Garland was taking [[Medical prescription|prescription]] barbiturate sleeping pills along with illicitly obtained pills containing [[morphine]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Clarke|first=Andrew|date=June 14, 2019|title=50 years on: Judy Garland self-destructive genius or the girl never allowed to grow up?|url=https://www.edp24.co.uk/things-to-do/the-tortured-genius-that-was-judy-garland-1407438|access-date=November 27, 2021|website=Eastern Daily Press|language=en-UK}}</ref> Around this time, she also developed a serious problem with alcohol. These, in combination with [[migraine]] headaches, led her to miss several shooting days in a row. After being advised by her doctor that she would only be able to work in four- to five-day increments with extended rest periods between, MGM executive [[Arthur Freed]] made the decision to suspend her on July 18, 1948. She was replaced in the film by [[Ginger Rogers]].{{sfn|Shipman|1992|p=225}}

When her suspension was over, she was summoned back to work and ultimately performed two songs as a guest in the [[Rodgers and Hart]] biopic ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1948), which was her last appearance with Mickey Rooney. Despite the all-star cast, ''Words and Music'' barely broke even at the box office. Having regained her strength, as well as some needed weight during her suspension, Garland felt much better and in the fall of 1948, she returned to MGM to replace a pregnant [[June Allyson]] for the musical film ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949) co-starring [[Van Johnson]]. Although she was sometimes late arriving at the studio during the making of this picture, she managed to complete it five days ahead of schedule. Her daughter Liza made her film debut at the age of two and a half at the end of the film. ''In The Good Old Summertime'' was enormously successful at the box office.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Gerald|title=Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland|url=https://archive.org/details/gethappylifeofju00clar|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Random House|page=[https://archive.org/details/gethappylifeofju00clar/page/240 240]|isbn=9780375503788}}</ref>

Garland was then cast in the film adaptation of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' in the title role of [[Annie Oakley]]. She was nervous at the prospect of taking on a role strongly identified with [[Ethel Merman]], anxious about appearing in an unglamorous part after breaking from juvenile parts for several years, and disturbed by her treatment at the hands of director [[Busby Berkeley]]. Berkeley was staging all the musical numbers, and was severe with Garland's lack of effort, attitude, and enthusiasm. She complained to Mayer, trying to have Berkeley fired from the feature. She began arriving late to the set and sometimes failed to appear. At this time, she was also undergoing electroshock therapy for depression.<ref>{{cite web

She was fired from the picture on May 10, 1949, and was replaced by [[Betty Hutton]], who stepped in to  perform all the musical routines as staged by Berkeley.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=255}}
Garland underwent an extensive hospital stay at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital|Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, in which she was weaned off her medication, and after a while, was able to eat and sleep normally. During her stay, she found solace in meeting with disabled children; in a 1964 interview regarding issues raised in ''[[A Child Is Waiting]]'' (1963) and her recovery at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Garland had this to say: "Well it helped me by just getting my mind off myself and ... they were so delightful, they were so loving and good and I forgot about myself for a change".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Garland |first1=Judy |title= Judy Garland: 1964 Australian Interview |url=https://thejudygarlandexperience.blogspot.com/2012/07/judy-australia-1964.html |location=Sydney, Australia |date=May 1964 |quote=Well it helped me by just getting my mind off myself and ... they were so delightful, they were so loving and good and I forgot about myself for a change}}</ref>

Garland returned to Los Angeles heavier, and in the fall of 1949, was cast opposite Gene Kelly in ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950). The film took six months to complete. To lose weight, Garland went back on the pills and the familiar pattern resurfaced. She began showing up late or not at all. When principal photography on ''Summer Stock'' was completed in the spring of 1950, it was decided that Garland needed an additional musical number. She agreed to do it provided the song should be "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]".

In addition, she insisted that director [[Charles Walters]] choreograph and stage the number. By that time, Garland had lost 15&nbsp;pounds and looked more slender. "Get Happy" was the last segment of ''Summer Stock'' to be filmed. It was her final picture for MGM. When it was released in the fall of 1950, ''Summer Stock'' drew big crowds and racked up very respectable box-office receipts, but because of the costly shooting delays caused by Garland, the film posted a loss of $80,000 to the studio.<ref name="Mannix">{{Citation | title = The Eddie Mannix Ledger | publisher = Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study | place = Los Angeles}}.</ref>

Garland was cast in the film ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' with Fred Astaire after June Allyson became pregnant in 1950. She failed to report to the set on multiple occasions, and the studio suspended her contract on June 17, 1950. She was replaced by [[Jane Powell]].{{sfn|Frank|1975|p=271}} Reputable biographies following her death stated that after this latest dismissal, she slightly grazed her neck with a broken glass, requiring only a [[Band-Aid]], but at the time, the public was informed that a despondent Garland had slashed her throat.<ref name=Shana>{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Shana|title=Judy's New Rainbow|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date=June 2, 1961}}</ref>

"All I could see ahead was more confusion", Garland later said of this suicide attempt. "I wanted to black out the future as well as the past. I wanted to hurt myself and everyone who had hurt me."<ref name=Hyams>{{cite news|last=Hyams|first=Joe|author-link=Joe Hyams|title=Crack-Up

==Later career==

===Appearances on Bing Crosby's radio show===

Garland was a frequent guest on ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', hosted by her friend [[Bing Crosby]]. Following Garland's second suicide attempt, Crosby, knowing that she was depressed and running out of money, invited her on to his radio show{{snd}}the first of the new season{{snd}}on October 11, 1950.

{{Blockquote|text= She was standing in the wings of it trembling with fear. She was almost hysterical. She said, "I cannot go out there because they're all gonna be looking to see if there are scars, and it's gonna be terrible." Bing said "What's going on?" and I told him what happened and he walked out on stage and he said: "We got a friend here, she's had a little trouble recently. You probably heard about it – everything is fine now, she needs our love. She needs our support. She's here – let's give it to her, OK? Here's Judy." And she came out, and that place went crazy. And she just blossomed.|sign=[[Hal Kanter]], Writer for Bing}}

Garland made eight appearances during the 1950–51 season of ''[[The Bing Crosby – Chesterfield Show]]'', which immediately reinvigorated her career. Soon after, she toured for four months to sellout crowds in Europe.<ref>{{Cite episode |title= Bing Crosby Rediscovered|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/bing-crosby/full-film-bing-crosby-rediscovered/3605/|access-date=August 23, 2015 |series=American Masters|network=PBS|date=December 26, 2014|season=28|time= 30:00 minutes in|language=en}}</ref>

===Renewed stardom on the stage===
[[File:Judygarland astarisborn warnerbros publicitystill 19542.jpg|thumb|right|Garland in a publicity still (1954)]]
In 1951, Garland began a four-month concert tour of Britain and Ireland, where she played to sold-out audiences throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland.{{sfn|Frank|1975|p=304}} The successful concert tour was the first of her many comebacks, with performances centered on songs by [[Al Jolson]] and revival of vaudevillian "tradition". Garland performed complete shows as tributes to Jolson in her concerts at the [[London Palladium]] in April and at New York's [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theater]] later that year.<ref name=Radano/>

Garland said after the Palladium show: "I suddenly knew that this was the beginning of a new life&nbsp;... Hollywood thought I was through; then came the wonderful opportunity to appear at the London Palladium, where I can truthfully say Judy Garland was reborn."<ref name=Radano>Radano, Ronald M., editor, ''Music and the Racial Imagination'', Univ. of Chicago Press (2000) p. 135</ref> Her appearances at the Palladium lasted for four weeks, where she received rave reviews and an ovation described by the Palladium manager as the loudest he had ever heard.<ref>{{cite news|title=British Give Judy Garland Big Ovation|agency=Associated Press|date=April 10, 1951}}</ref><ref name = MacPherson>{{cite news|last=MacPherson|first=Virginia|title=Judy Garland in Comeback with Palladium Contract|publisher=UPI|date=April 10, 1951}}</ref>

Garland's engagement at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]] in Manhattan in October 1951 exceeded all previous records for the theater and for Garland, and was called "one of the greatest personal triumphs in show business history".<ref>{{cite news|last=Garver|first=Jack|title=Judy Garland Ends Triumphant Vaudeville Run|publisher=UPI|date=February 24, 1952}}</ref> Garland was honored with a [[Special Tony Award]] for her contribution to the revival of vaudeville.<ref>{{cite web|title=Judy Garland|publisher=American Theatre Wing|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search|access-date=December 24, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831204617/http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search|archive-date=August 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Garland divorced Minnelli that same year.{{sfn|Juneau|1974|p=108}} On June 8, 1952, she married [[Sidney Luft]], her tour manager and producer, in [[Hollister, California]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Garver|first=Jack|title=Judy Garland Married With Simple Ceremony|publisher=UPI|date=June 12, 1952}}</ref> Garland gave birth to [[Lorna Luft]], who herself became an actress and singer, on November 21, 1952, and to Joey Luft on March 29, 1955.{{sfn|Edwards|1975|p=166}}

===Hollywood comeback===
[[File:Garland Star Born recrop.jpg|thumb|Garland in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954)]]
Garland appeared with [[James Mason]] in the [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954), the first remake of [[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|the 1937 film]]. She and Sidney Luft, her then-husband, produced the film through their [[production company]], Transcona Enterprises, while Warner Bros. supplied finance, production facilities, and crew.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=308}} Directed by [[George Cukor]], it was a large undertaking to which she initially fully dedicated herself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brief Descriptions and Expanded Essays of National Film Registry Titles {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/descriptions-and-essays/ |website=Library of Congress, Washington, DC |access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref>

As shooting progressed, however, she began making the same pleas of illness that she had so often made during her final films at MGM. Production delays led to cost overruns and angry confrontations with Warner Bros. head [[Jack L. Warner]]. Principal photography wrapped on March 17, 1954. At Luft's suggestion, the "Born in a Trunk" medley was filmed as a showcase for her and inserted over director Cukor's objections, who feared the additional length would lead to cuts in other areas. It was completed on July 29.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=319}}

Upon its world premiere on September 29, 1954, the film was met with critical and popular acclaim. Before its release, it was edited at the instruction of Jack Warner; theater operators, concerned that they were losing money because they were only able to run the film for three or four shows per day instead of five or six, pressured the studio to make additional reductions. After its first-run engagements, about 30 minutes of footage were cut, sparking outrage among critics and filmgoers. Although it was still popular, drawing huge crowds and grossing over $6,000,000 in its first release, ''A Star is Born'' did not make back its cost and ended up losing money. As a result, the secure financial position Garland had expected from the profits did not materialize.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=325}} Transcona made no more films with Warner.{{sfn|Juneau|1974|p=126}}

Garland was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and, in the run-up to the [[27th Academy Awards]], was generally expected to win for ''A Star Is Born''. She could not attend the ceremony because she had just given birth to her son, Joseph Luft, so a television crew was in her hospital room with cameras and wires to broadcast her anticipated acceptance speech. The Oscar was won, however, by [[Grace Kelly]] for ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' (1954). The camera crew was packing up before Kelly could even reach the stage. [[Groucho Marx]] sent Garland a telegram after the awards ceremony, declaring her loss "the biggest robbery since [[Great Brink's Robbery|Brinks]]".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chicago Tribune: Chicago news, sports, weather, entertainment|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/|access-date=November 27, 2021|website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' labeled her performance as "just about the greatest one-woman show in modern movie history".{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=326}} Garland won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress in a Musical]] for the role.<ref name=Globes>{{cite web|title=Judy Garland|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29377|access-date=December 24, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111182936/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29377|archive-date=January 11, 2008}}</ref>

Garland's films after ''A Star Is Born'' included ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961) (for which she was Oscar- and Golden Globe-nominated for Best Supporting Actress), the animated feature ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]'' (1962), and ''[[A Child Is Waiting]]'' (1963) with [[Burt Lancaster]].

===Television, concerts, and Carnegie Hall===
[[File:Judy Garland at Greek Theater.jpg|thumb|Garland in her dressing room at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] (1957)]]

Garland appeared in a number of television specials beginning in 1955. The first was the 1955 debut episode of ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]''; this was the first full-scale color broadcast ever on [[CBS]] and was a ratings triumph, scoring a 34.8 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]]. She signed a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network. Only one additional special was broadcast in 1956, a live concert-edition of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', before the relationship between the Lufts and CBS broke down in a dispute over the planned format of upcoming specials.{{sfn|Sanders|1990|p=24}}

She felt so warmly embraced by the British that she announced her intention to move permanently to England.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=349}}

At the beginning of 1960, Garland signed a contract with [[Random House]] to write her autobiography. The book was to be called ''The Judy Garland Story'', and would be a collaboration with [[Fred F. Finklehoffe]]. Garland was paid an advance of $35,000, and she and Finklehoffe recorded conversations about her life to be used in producing a manuscript. Garland would work on her autobiography on and off throughout the 1960s, but never completed it. Portions of her unfinished autobiography were included in the 2014 biography, ''Judy Garland on Judy Garland: Interviews and Encounters'' by Randy L.

===''The Judy Garland Show''===
[[File:Dean Martin, Judy Garland and Frank Sinatra in 1962.jpg|thumb|Dean Martin, Garland, and Frank Sinatra (1962)]]
In 1961, Garland and CBS settled their contract disputes with the help of her new agent, [[Freddie Fields]], and negotiated a new round of specials. The first, titled ''The Judy Garland Show'', aired on February 25, 1962<ref>{{cite web|url=https://letterboxd.com/film/judy-frank-dean-once-in-a-lifetime/|title=Judy, Frank & Dean – Once in a Lifetime (1962)|website=Letterboxd.com}}</ref> and featured guests [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]].{{sfn|Sanders|1990|p=29}} Following this success, CBS made a $24&nbsp;million offer (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|24|1962|r=1}} million in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) to her for a weekly television series of her own, also to be called ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'', which was deemed at the time in the press to be "the biggest talent deal in TV history". Although she had said as early as 1955 that she would never do a weekly television series,<ref name=Parsons>{{cite news|last=Parsons|first=Louella|author-link=Louella Parsons|title=TV Spectacular Gives New Rainbow to Judy|work=[[The Daily Review]]|date =September 23, 1955}}</ref> in the early 1960s, she was in a financially precarious situation. She was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the [[Internal Revenue Service]], having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the failure of ''A Star is Born'' meant that she received nothing from that investment.{{sfn|Edwards|1975|p=175}}

Following a third special, ''Judy Garland and Her Guests [[Phil Silvers]] and [[Robert Goulet]]'', Garland's weekly series debuted September 29, 1963.{{sfn|Sanders|1990|p=391}} ''The Judy Garland Show'' was critically praised,{{sfn|Sanders|1990|pp=108–09}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Richard Warren|title=The TV Troubles of Judy Garland|work=[[The Saturday Evening Post]]|date=December 7, 1963}}</ref> but for a variety of reasons (including being placed in the time slot opposite ''[[Bonanza]]'' on [[NBC]]), the show lasted only one season and was cancelled in 1964 after 26 episodes. Despite its short run, the series was nominated for four [[Emmy Award]]s, including Best Variety Series.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Judy Garland Show|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/judy-garland-show|access-date=January 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114115820/http://www.emmys.com/shows/judy-garland-show|archive-date=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

During this time Garland had a six-month affair with actor [[Glenn Ford]]. Garland's biographer [[Gerald Clarke (author)|Gerald Clarke]], Ford's son Peter, singer [[Mel Tormé]] and her husband Sid Luft wrote about the affair in their respective biographies. The relationship began in 1963 while Garland was doing her television show. Ford would attend tapings of the show sitting in the front row while Garland sang. Ford is credited with giving Garland one of the more stable relationships of her later life. The affair was ended by Ford (a notorious womanizer according to his son Peter) when he realized Garland wanted to marry him.<ref>Ford, Peter. Glenn Ford: A Life (Wisconsin Film Studies).

==Political views==
Garland was a life-long and relatively active [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. During her lifetime, she was a member of the Hollywood Democratic committee, and a financial and moral supporter of various causes, including the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. She donated money to the campaigns of Democratic presidential candidates [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Adlai Stevenson II]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive]] candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShcCbLFdwpoC&q=Judy+Garland+Hollywood+Democratic+committee&pg=PA45|title=Hollywood's New Deal|first=Giulana|last=Muscio|date=2010|publisher=Temple University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1439904824}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu/exhibits/hollywood-democratic-committee/election-campaigns|title=Election Campaigns |website=Wcftr.commarts.wisc.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qz6vYqLoJGgC&q=Judy+Garland+Hollywood+Democratic+committee&pg=PA43|title=Celebrity Politics|first=Mark|last=Wheeler|year=2013|publisher=Polity|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0745652481}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzcZXEAyzB8C&q=Judy+Garland+Hollywood+Democratic+committee&pg=PA232|title=FDR, Dewey, and the Election of 1944|first=David M.|last=Jordan|year=2017|publisher=Indiana University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0253356833}}</ref>

In September 1947, Garland joined the [[Committee for the First Amendment]], a group formed by Hollywood celebrities in support of the [[Hollywood Ten]] during the hearings of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), an investigative committee of the [[United States House of Representatives]] led by [[J. Parnell Thomas]], which was formed to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and organizations suspected of having communist ties. The Committee for the First Amendment sought to protect the civil liberties of those accused.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLK8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA297 |page=297 |author=Joseph C.

Other members included [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Dorothy Dandridge]], [[John Garfield]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Lena Horne]], [[John Huston]], [[Gene Kelly]], and [[Billy Wilder]].  Garland took part in recording an all-star October 26, 1947, radio broadcast, ''[[Hollywood Fights Back]]'', during which she exhorted listeners to action: "Before every free conscience in America is subpoenaed, please speak up! Say your piece! Write your congressman a letter{{snd}}air mail special. Let the Congress know what you think of its Un-American Committee."<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLK8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA297 |page=297 |author=Joseph C.

Garland was a friend of President [[John F. Kennedy]] and his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]], and she often vacationed in [[Hyannis Port]], Massachusetts. The house she stayed in during her vacations in Hyannis Port is known today as The Judy Garland House because of her association with the property.<ref name="Luft">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/memyshadowsfamil00luft|title=Me and my shadows: a family memoir|first=Lorna|last=Luft|date=1998|publisher=New York: Pocket Books|isbn=9780671018993|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Garland would call the President weekly, often ending her phone calls by singing the first few bars of "Over the Rainbow".<ref name="Luft"/>

On August 28, 1963, Garland and other prominent celebrities such as [[Josephine Baker]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Rita Moreno]], and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] took part in the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], a demonstration organized to advocate for the civil and economic rights of African Americans.  She had been photographed by the press in Los Angeles earlier in the month alongside [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Marlon Brando]], and [[Charlton Heston]] as they planned their participation in the march on the nation's capital.

On September 16, 1963, Garland{{snd}}along with daughter Liza, [[Carolyn Jones]], [[June Allyson]], and Allyson's daughter Pam Powell{{snd}}held a press conference to highlight and protest the recent [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], that resulted in the death of four young African American girls. They expressed their shock at the events and requested funds for the families of the victims. Pam Powell and Liza Minnelli both announced their intention to attend the funeral of the victims during the press conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/license/515512382|title=Meeting with the press actresses Carolyn Jones June Allison and Judy...}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://judygarlandnews.com/2018/06/03/on-this-day-in-judy-garlands-life-and-career-june-3/|title=On This Day In Judy Garland's Life And Career |date=June 3, 2018}}</ref>

==Final years==
In 1963, Garland sued [[Sidney Luft]] for divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty. She also asserted that he had repeatedly struck her while he was drinking and that he had attempted to take their children from her by force.<ref name=Divorce>{{cite news|title=Judy Wins Divorce From Sid Luft|work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]]|date=May 20, 1965}}</ref> She had filed for divorce from Luft on several previous occasions, even as early as 1956, but they had reconciled each time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Irwin|first=Elson|title=Judy Garland: Femme Fatale|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|date=November 17, 1968}}</ref>

[[File:Mickey Deans Judy Garland Allan Warren.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Mickey Deans]] and Garland at their London wedding in March 1969, three months before her death]]
After her television series was canceled, Garland returned to work on the stage. She returned to the London Palladium performing with her 18-year-old daughter [[Liza Minnelli]] in November 1964. The concert was also shown on the British television network [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and it was one of her final appearances at the venue. She made guest appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]''. Garland guest-hosted an episode of ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'' with [[Vic Damone]]. She was invited back for a second episode in 1966 with [[Van Johnson]] as her guest. Problems with Garland's behavior ended her ''Hollywood Palace'' guest appearances.{{sfn|DiOrio, Jr.|1973|p=202}}

A 1964 tour of Australia ended badly. Garland's first two concerts in Sydney were held in the [[Sydney Stadium]] because no concert hall could accommodate the overflow crowds who wanted to see her. Both went well and received positive reviews. Her third performance, in [[Melbourne]], started an hour late. The crowd of 7,000 was angered by her tardiness and believed that she was drunk; they booed and heckled her, and she fled the stage after 45 minutes.{{sfn|Edwards|1975|p=213}} She later characterized the Melbourne crowd as "brutish".<ref name=Plot>{{cite news|last=Garland|first=Judy|title=The Plot Against Judy Garland|work=[[Ladies' Home Journal]]|date=August 1967}}</ref>  Garland's Melbourne appearance gained a negative press response.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judy Garland Locks Self in Hotel Room|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|agency=UPI|date=May 24, 1964}}</ref>

Garland's tour promoter [[Mark Herron]] announced that they had married aboard a freighter off the coast of Hong Kong. However, she was not officially divorced from Luft at the time the ceremony was performed.{{sfn|Edwards|1975|p=214}} The divorce became final on May 19, 1965,<ref name=Divorce /> and she and Herron did not legally marry until November 14, 1965; they separated five months later.{{sfn|Frank|1975|p=556}} During their divorce, Garland testified that Herron had beaten her. Herron claimed that he "only hit her in self defense".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-19/local/me-26521_1_mark-herron|title=Obituaries : Mark Herron; Judy Garland's Fourth Husband|date=January 19, 1996|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

For much of her career throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, her husband [[Sidney Luft]] had been her manager. However, Garland eventually parted ways with Luft professionally, signing with agents [[Freddie Fields]] and [[David Begelman]]. By the fall of 1966, Garland had also parted ways with Fields and Begelman. Fields's and Begelman's mismanagement of Garland's money, as well as their embezzlement of much of her earnings resulted in her owing around $500,000 in total in personal debts and in debts to the IRS. The IRS placed [[tax lien]]s on her home in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles]], her recording contract with [[Capitol Records]], and any other business dealings in which she could derive an income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejudyroom.com/garlandsforjudy/Garlands-For-Judy-August-2017.pdf|title=Judy at the Palace 50th Anniversary|website=Thejudyroom.com|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref>

Garland was left in a desperate situation that saw her sell her Brentwood home at a price far below its value. She was then cast in February 1967 in the role of Helen Lawson in ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' by [[20th Century Fox]].{{sfn|Seaman|1996|pp=292–93}} According to co-star [[Patty Duke]], Garland was treated poorly by director [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]] on the set of ''Valley of the Dolls'' and was primarily hired so as to augment publicity for the film.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N9AAnnxpS8|title=Patty Duke on Judy Garland in Valley of the Dolls @ Castro Theatre Event!|first=Marc|last=Huestis|date=August 28, 2009|access-date=August 13, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> After Garland's dismissal from the film, author [[Jacqueline Susann]] said in the 1967 television documentary ''Jacqueline Susann and the Valley of the Dolls'', "I think Judy will always come back. She kids about making a lot of comebacks, but I think Judy has a kind of a thing where she has to get to the bottom of the rope and things have to get very, very rough for her. Then with an amazing inner strength that only comes of a certain genius, she comes back bigger than ever".<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dejC_A-Cp3w|title="Jacqueline Susann & The Valley of The Dolls" 1967 Documentary|last=The Concluding Chapter of Crawford|date=August 31, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>

Returning to the stage, Garland made one of her last U.S. appearances at New York's Palace Theatre in July 1967, a 27-show stand, performing with her children [[Lorna Luft|Lorna]] and Joey Luft. She wore a sequined pantsuit on stage for this tour, which was part of the original wardrobe for her character in ''Valley of the Dolls''.{{sfn|Shipman|1992|p=494}} Garland earned more than $200,000 from her final run at New York's Palace Theatre from her 75% share of the profits generated by her engagement there. On closing night at the Palace, federal tax agents seized the majority of her earnings.<ref name="books.google.co.nz">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMtT0rOMyS4C&pg=PA351|title=Judy Garland: The Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Legend|first=Scott|last=Schechter|year=2006|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|access-date=August 13, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1461635550}}</ref>

By early 1969, Garland's health had deteriorated. She performed in London at the [[Hippodrome, London|Talk of the Town]] nightclub for a five-week run{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=412}} in which she was paid £2,500 per week,<ref name="archive.org"/> and made her last concert appearance in [[Copenhagen]] during March 1969.{{sfn|DiOrio, Jr.|1973|p=204}} After her divorce from Herron had been finalized on February 11, she married her fifth and final husband, nightclub manager [[Mickey Deans]], at [[Chelsea Register Office]], London, on March 15.{{sfn|Edwards|1975|p=275}}

==Death==
On June 22, 1969, Garland was found dead in the bathroom of her rented house in [[Cadogan Lane]], [[Belgravia, London|Belgravia]], London.<ref name = Bertram/> At the [[inquest]], Coroner Gavin Thurston stated that the cause of death was "an incautious [[drug overdose|self-overdosage]]" of [[barbiturate]]s; her blood contained the equivalent of ten {{convert|1.5|gr|mg|adj=on|lk=in}} [[secobarbital|Seconal]] capsules.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=422}} Thurston stressed that the overdose had been unintentional and no evidence suggested that she had died by suicide. Garland's [[autopsy]] showed no inflammation of her stomach lining and no drug residue in her stomach, which indicated that the drug had been ingested over a long period of time, rather than in a single dose. Her death certificate stated that her death was "accidental".<ref>{{cite web|title=Judy Garland The Live Performances.

After Garland's body had been embalmed, Deans traveled with her remains to New York City on June 26, where an estimated 20,000 people lined up to pay their respects at the [[Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel]] in [[Manhattan]], which remained open all night long to accommodate the overflowing crowd. On June 27, [[James Mason]] gave a eulogy at the funeral, an Episcopal service led by the Rev.

Upon Garland's death, despite having earned millions during her career, her estate came to {{US$|40000}} ({{Inflation|US-GDP|40000|1969|r=0|fmt=eq}}). Years of mismanagement of her financial affairs by her representatives and staff along with her generosity toward her family and various causes resulted in her poor financial situation at the end of her life. In her last will, signed and sealed in early 1961, Garland made many generous bequests that could not be fulfilled because her estate had been in debt for many years. Her daughter, [[Liza Minnelli]], worked to pay off her mother's debts with the help of family friend [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/wherethereswillw0000silv|title=Where there's a will-- : who inherited what and why|first=Stephen M.|last=Silverman|date=July 7, 1991|publisher=New York, N.Y. : HarperCollins|isbn=9780060162603|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> In 1978, a selection of Garland's personal items was auctioned off by her ex-husband Sidney Luft with the support of their daughter [[Lorna Luft|Lorna]] and their son Joe.

''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' writer Joan E. Dowlin called the period of Garland's music career between 1937 and 1945 the "innocent years", during which the critic believes the singer's "voice was vibrant and her musical expression exuberant", taking note of its resonance and distinct, "rich yet sweet" quality "that grabs you and pulls you in".<ref name=":9" /> Garland's voice would often vary to suit the song she was interpreting, ranging from soft, engaging and tender during ballads to humorous on some of her duets with other artists.<ref name=":9" /> Her more joyful, [[Belting (music)|belted]] performances have been compared to entertainers [[Sophie Tucker]], [[Ethel Merman]], and [[Al Jolson]].<ref name=":7" /> Although her musical repertoire consisted largely of [[cast recording]]s, [[show tune]]s and [[Traditional pop music|traditional pop standards]],<ref name=":12" /> Garland was also capable of singing [[Soul music|soul]], [[blues]], and jazz music, which Dowlin compared to singer [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=":9" />

Jessel recalled that, even at only 12 years old, Garland's singing voice resembled that of "a woman with a heart that had been hurt".<ref name=":4" /> ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' contributor Robert Trussel cited Garland's singing voice among the reasons why her role in ''The Wizard of Oz'' remains memorable, writing that although "She might have been made up and costumed to look like a little girl ... she didn't sing like one" due to her "powerful contralto command[ing] attention".<ref name=":0" />

[[Camille Paglia]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', joked that even in Garland's adult life, "her petite frame literally throbbed with her huge voice", making it appear as though she were "at war with her own body".<ref name=":7" /> Theater actress and director Donna Thomason stated that Garland was an "effective" performer because she was capable of using her "singing voice [as] a natural extension of [her] speaking voice", a skill that Thomason believes all musical theater actors should at least strive to achieve.<ref name=":0" /> Trussel agreed that "Garland's singing voice sounded utterly natural. It never seemed forced or overly trained."<ref name=":0" />

Writing for [[Turner Classic Movies]], biographer Jonathan Riggs observed that Garland had a tendency to imbue her vocals with a [[paradox]]ical combination of "fragility and resilience" that eventually became a signature trademark of hers.<ref name=":3" /> Louis Bayard of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described Garland's voice as "throbbing", believing it to be capable of "connect[ing] with [audiences] in a way no other voice does".<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2000/04/16/supernova/00c61783-6191-48c1-9e5a-0553dc634111/|title=Supernova|last=Bayard|first=Louis|date=April 16, 2000|website=The Washington Post|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref> Bayard also believes that listeners "find it hard to disentwine the sorrow in her voice from the sorrow that dogged her life",<ref name=":1" /> while Dowlin argued that, "Listening to Judy sing ... makes me forget all of the angst and suffering she must have endured."<ref name=":9" />

''The New York Times'' obituarist in 1969 observed that Garland, whether intentionally or not, "brought with her ... all the well-publicized phantoms of her emotional breakdown, her career collapses and comebacks" on stage during later performances.<ref name="nytobit" /> The same writer said that Garland's voice changed and lost some of its quality as she aged, although she retained much of her personality.<ref name="nytobit" /> Contributing to the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', Julia Molony observed Garland's voice, although "still rich with emotion", had finally begun to "creak with the weight of years of disappointment and hard-living" by the time she performed at Carnegie Hall in 1961.<ref name=":10">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/judy-garland-the-diva-the-drugs-and-the-damage-31264687.html|title=Judy Garland: the diva, the drugs and the damage|last=Molony|first=Julia|date=June 1, 2015|website=Irish Independent|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref>

Similarly, the live record's entry in the [[Library of Congress]] wrote that "while her voice was still strong, it had also gained a bit of heft and a bit of wear"; author Cary O'Dell believes Garland's rasp and "occasional quiver" only "upped the emotional quotient of many of her numbers", particularly on her signature songs "Over the Rainbow" and "The Man That Got Away".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/judy.pdf|title="Judy at Carnegie Hall" – Judy Garland (1961)|last=O'Dell|first=Cary|date=2003|website=Library of Congress|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> Garland stated that she always felt most safe and at home while performing onstage, regardless of the condition of her voice.<ref name=":11" /> Her musical talent has been commended by her peers; opera singer [[Maria Callas]] once said that Garland possessed "the most superb voice she had ever heard", while singer and actor [[Bing Crosby]] said that "no other singer could be compared to her" when Garland was rested.<ref name=":14" />

Garland was known for interacting with her audiences during live performances; ''The New York Times'' obituarist wrote that Garland possessed "a seemingly unquenchable need for her audiences to respond with acclaim and affection. And often, they did, screaming, 'We love you, Judy – we love you.'"<ref name="nytobit" /> Garland herself explained in 1961: "A really great reception makes me feel like I have a great big warm heating pad all over me ... I truly have a great love for an audience, and I used to want to prove it to them by giving them blood. But I have a funny new thing now, a real determination to make people enjoy the show."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/334424/viannguyen/i-didnt-ask-to-be-a-legend-12-fascinating-quotes-from-judy-garland-on-judy-garland/|title='I Didn't Ask to Be a Legend': 12 Fascinating Quotes from Judy Garland on Judy Garland|last=Nguyen|first=Vi-An|date=September 4, 2014|website=Parade|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref>

''The New York Times'' writer described her as both "an instinctive actress and comedienne". The anonymous contributor commented that Garland's performance style resembled that of "a [[music hall]] performer in an era when music halls were obsolete".<ref name="nytobit" /> Close friends of Garland's insisted that she never truly wanted to be a movie star and would have much rather devoted her career entirely to singing and recording records.<ref name=":5" /> [[AllMusic]] biographer William Ruhlmann believes that Garland's ability to maintain a successful career as a recording artist even after her film appearances became less frequent was unusual for an artist at the time.<ref name=":12" />

==Public image and reputation==
Garland was nearly as famous for her personal struggles in everyday life as she was for her entertainment career.<ref name=":7">{{cite web|last=Paglia|first=Camille|author-link=Camille Paglia|date=June 14, 1998|title=Judy Garland As a Force Of Nature|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/arts/judy-garland-as-a-force-of-nature.html|access-date=April 2, 2018|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> She has been closely associated with her carefully cultivated [[girl next door]] image.<ref name=":10" /> Early in her career during the 1930s, Garland's public image had earned her the title "America's favorite kid sister",<ref name=":4" /> as well as the title "Little Miss Showbusiness".<ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/1993/07/09/judy-garland-secret-life-legend/|title=Judy Garland: The Secret Life of a Legend|last=Lyons|first=Gene|date=July 9, 1993|website=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQVQDwAAQBAJ&q=Little%20Miss%20Showbusiness%20judy%20garland&pg=PT259|title=Judy & I: My Life with Judy Garland|last=Luft|first=Sid|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2018|isbn=978-1787590724|location=United Kingdom|via=Google Books}}</ref>

In a review for the ''[[Star Tribune]]'', Graydon Royce wrote that Garland's public image remained that of "a Midwestern girl who couldn't believe where she was", despite having been a well-established celebrity for over 20 years.<ref name=":11">{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/judy-garland-at-the-end/138166284/|title=Judy Garland at the end|last=Royce|first=Gradon|date=February 6, 2012|website=Star Tribune|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> Royce believes that fans and audiences insisted on preserving their memory of Garland as Dorothy no matter how much she matured, calling her "a captive not of her own desire to stay young, but a captive of the public's desire to preserve her that way".<ref name=":11" /> Thus, the studio continued to cast Garland in roles that were significantly younger than her actual age.<ref name=":11" />

According to Malony, Garland was one of Hollywood's hardest-working performers during the 1940s, which Malony claims she used as a [[Coping (psychology)|coping mechanism]] after her first marriage imploded.<ref name=":10" /> However, studio employees recall that Garland had a tendency to be quite intense, headstrong and volatile;<ref name=":4" /> ''Judy Garland: The Secret Life of an American Legend'' author [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]] claims that several individuals were frustrated by Garland's "[[narcissism]]" and "growing instability", while millions of fans found her public demeanor and [[psychological state]] to be "fragile",<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":10" /> appearing neurotic in interviews.<ref name=":11" />

MGM reports that Garland was consistently tardy and demonstrated erratic behavior, which resulted in several delays and disruptions to filming schedules until she was finally dismissed from the studio, which had deemed her unreliable and difficult to manage.<ref name=":10" /> Farrell called Garland "A grab bag of contradictions" which "has always been a feast for the American imagination", describing her public persona as "awkward yet direct, bashful yet brash".<ref name=":2" /> Describing the singer as "Tender and endearing yet savage and turbulent", Paglia wrote that Garland "cut a path of destruction through many lives. And out of that chaos, she made art of still-searing intensity."<ref name=":7" /> Calling her "a creature of extremes, greedy, sensual, and demanding, gluttonous for pleasure and pain",<ref name=":4" /> Paglia also compared Garland to entertainer [[Frank Sinatra]] due to their shared "emblematic personality ... into whom the mass audience projected its hopes and disappointments", while observing that she lacked Sinatra's survival skills.<ref name=":7" />

Despite her success as a performer, Garland suffered from low self-esteem, particularly with regard to her weight, which she constantly dieted to maintain at the behest of the studio and Mayer;<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":10" /><ref name=":13" /> critics and historians believe this was a result of having been told that she was an "[[The Ugly Duckling|ugly duckling]]" by studio executives.<ref name=":9" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' columnist [[Gene Lyons]] observed that both audiences and fellow members of the entertainment industry "tended either to love her or to hate her".<ref name=":6" />

At one point, Stevie Phillips, who had worked as an agent for Garland for four years, described her client as "a demented, demanding, supremely talented drug-addict".<ref name=":10" /> Royce argues that Garland maintained "astonishing strength and courage", even during difficult times.<ref name=":11" /> English actor [[Dirk Bogarde]] once called Garland "the funniest woman I have ever met".<ref name=":1" /> Ruhlmann wrote that the singer's personal life "contrasted so starkly with the exuberance and innocence of her film roles".<ref name=":12" />

Despite her personal struggles, Garland disagreed with the public's opinion that she was a tragic figure.<ref name=":11" /><ref name=":8" /> Her younger daughter Lorna agreed that Garland "hated" being referred to as a tragic figure, explaining, "We all have tragedies in our lives, but that does not make us tragic. She was funny and she was warm and she was wonderfully gifted. She had great highs and great moments in her career. She also had great moments in her personal life. Yes, we lost her at 47 years old. That was tragic. But she was not a tragic figure."<ref name=":8" /> Ruhlmann argues that Garland actually used the public's opinion of her tragic image to her advantage towards the end of her career.<ref name=":12" />

[[Turner Classic Movies]] dubbed Garland "history's most poignant voice".<ref name=":3" /> ''Entertainment Weekly''<nowiki/>'s Gene Lyons dubbed Garland "the [[Madonna]] of her generation".<ref name=":6" /> The [[American Film Institute]] named her eighth among the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|Greatest female stars]] of Golden Age Hollywood cinema.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date=June 16, 1999 |access-date=June 12, 2008}}</ref> In June 1998, in ''The New York Times'', Camille Paglia wrote that, "Garland was a personality on the grand scale who makes our current crop of pop stars look lightweight and evanescent."<ref name=":7" />

In recent years, Garland's legacy has maintained fans of all different ages, both younger and older.<ref name=":8" /> In 2010, <!-- correct form for the year. -->''The Huffington Post'' contributor Joan E. Dowlin concluded that Garland possessed a distinct "it" quality by "exemplif[ying] the star quality of charisma, musical talent, natural acting ability, and, despite what the studio honchos said, good looks (even if they were the girl next door looks)".<ref name=":9" />

[[AllMusic]]'s biographer William Ruhlmann said that "the core of her significance as an artist remains her amazing voice and emotional commitment to her songs", and believes that "her career is sometimes viewed more as an object lesson in Hollywood excess than as the remarkable string of multimedia accomplishments it was".<ref name=":12" /> In 2012, Strassler described Garland as "more than an icon... Like [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Lucille Ball]], she created a template that the powers that be have forever been trying, with varied levels of success, to replicate."<ref name=":15" />

Garland's live performances towards the end of her career are still remembered by fans who attended them as "peak moments in 20th-century music".<ref name=":4" /> She has been the subject of [[List of Judy Garland biographies|over thirty biographies]] since her death, including the well-received ''[[Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir]]'' by her daughter, Lorna Luft, whose memoir was later adapted into the television miniseries ''[[Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows]]'', which won Emmy Awards for the two actresses who portrayed her ([[Tammy Blanchard]] and [[Judy Davis]]).<ref>{{cite news |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |title=Subdued Patriotism Replaces Glitter as Television Finally Presents Its Emmys |work=The New York Times |date=November 5, 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/05/us/subdued-patriotism-replaces-glitter-as-television-finally-presents-its-emmys.html |access-date=August 7, 2009}}</ref> Strassler observed that Garland "created one of the most storied cautionary tales in the industry, thanks to her the many excesses and insecurities that led to her early death by overdose".<ref name=":15" />

Garland was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lifetime Achievement Award |publisher=The Recording Academy |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/lifetime-awards |access-date=December 25, 2007}}</ref> Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Grammy Hall of Fame Award |publisher=The Recording Academy |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame |access-date=December 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122042616/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame |archive-date=January 22, 2011}}</ref> These include "[[Over the Rainbow]]", which was ranked as the number one movie song of all time in the American Film Institute's "100 Years...100 Songs" list. Four more Garland songs are featured on the list: "[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]" (No. 76), "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]" (No. 61), "[[The Trolley Song]]" (No. 26), and "[[The Man That Got Away]]" (No. 11).<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date=June 22, 2004 |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/songs.aspx |access-date=December 25, 2007}}</ref>

She has twice been honored on U.S. postage stamps, in 1989 (as Dorothy)<ref>{{cite news |last=Kronish |first=Syd |title=Hollywood Film Legends Preserved on Latest Issue |work=The Sunday Capital |location=Washington, D.C. |date=April 8, 1990}}</ref> and again in 2006 (as Vicki Lester from ''A Star Is Born'').<ref>{{cite press release |title=The 2006 Commemorative Stamp Program |publisher=United States Postal Service |date=November 30, 2005 |url=http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2005/sr05_054.htm?from=bannercommunications&page=comstamps |access-date=December 25, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106145011/http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2005/sr05_054.htm?from=bannercommunications&page=comstamps |archive-date=January 6, 2008}}</ref> While on tour in 1964, Garland identified "Over the Rainbow" as her favorite of all the songs she had ever recorded, to which Trussel observed that "Her career would remain inextricably linked".<ref name=":0" /> Garland would frequently use an overture from "Over the Rainbow" as her entrance music during concerts and television appearances.<ref name=":0" />

According to Paglia, the more Garland performed "Over the Rainbow", the more it "became her tragic anthem ... a dirge for artistic opportunities squandered, and for personal happiness permanently deferred".<ref name=":7" /> In 1998, Carnegie Hall hosted a two-concert tribute to Garland, which they promoted as "a tribute to the world's greatest entertainer".<ref name=":7" />

Subsequent celebrities who have suffered from personal struggles with drug addiction and substance use disorder have been compared to Garland, particularly [[Michael Jackson]].<ref name=":9" /> Garland's elder daughter [[Liza Minnelli]] had a personal life that was almost parallel to that of her mother's, having struggled with substance use disorder and several unsuccessful marriages.<ref name=":10" /> Paglia observed that actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] would exhibit behavior which was similar to that which Garland had exhibited a decade earlier in ''Meet Me in St. Louis'', particularly tardiness.<ref name=":4" />

Judy Garland was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>
