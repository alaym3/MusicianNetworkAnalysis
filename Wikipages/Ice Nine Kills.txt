=== 2000–2009: Formation and ''Last Chance to Make Amends'' ===
Ice Nine Kills was founded in 2000 under the name "Ice Nine" by high school friends Spencer Charnas and Jeremy Schwartz, before later recruiting drummer Grant Newsted in 2003 and swapped out their then-bassist (Patrick Morse) for Hobie Boeschenstein in 2004,<ref>{{cite web |title=Norma Jean This Or The Apocalypse, Ice Nine Kills |url=https://www.thecastletheatre.com/event/134583-norma-jean-bloomington/ |access-date=June 23, 2018}}</ref> but changed their name to Ice Nine Kills just before releasing their debut independent album ''Last Chance to Make Amends'' on April 20, 2006.<ref name="lctmaitunes">{{cite web|title = Last Chance to Make Amends by ICE NINE KILLS|url = https://www.amazon.com/Last-Chance-Make-Amends-Kills/dp/B000JVS4W6|work = Amazon|publisher = Amazon}}</ref> However, they did record a demo, entitled "The Pop-Punk-Ska Years", in 2002, which would eventually be released in 2009.<ref name="AM">{{cite web |last1=Heaney |first1=Gregory |title=Ice Nine Kills Biography by Gregory Heaney |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ice-nine-kills-mn0002003366/biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=June 23, 2018}}</ref>

The following year on November 20, 2007, Ice Nine Kills released their EP ''The Burning'' through Red Blue Records.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ice Nine Kills- The Burning |url=http://redbluerecords.myshopify.com/products/ice-nine-kills-the-burning |work=Red Blue Records Online Store |publisher=Red Blue Records |access-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316093514/http://redbluerecords.myshopify.com/products/ice-nine-kills-the-burning |archive-date=March 16, 2011 }}</ref> The band then set out on several national tours in support of the EP, including opening slots on tours with [[I See Stars]] and [[Eyes Set to Kill]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Gauntlet - Ice Nine Kills|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/3956/Ice-Nine-Kills.html|work=The Gauntlet|access-date=June 5, 2011}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=August 2014}} By 2008, the group had been invited to open for well-known acts such as [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], [[A Day to Remember]], [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]], [[Paramore]] and a one-off performance on the [[Taste of Chaos]] 2009 tour.<ref name=ferretdebut/> That same year, Ice Nine Kills released 2 acoustic tracks ("The Simple Act of Giving Up" and "Lifetime in a Week") on an EP titled ''2 Song Acoustic''.<ref>{{cite web|title=2 Song Acoustic: Ice Nine Kills|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003C39XGO|website=Amazon.com|access-date=June 5, 2011}}</ref>

When teasing their single "Hip to Be Scared", inspired by the cult classic thriller ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'', the title of Ice Nine Kills' new album was listed in the credits as ''[[The Silver Scream 2: Welcome to Horrorwood]].''<ref name="Brown">{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Paul 'Browny'|date=2021-07-08|title=Looks Like Ice Nine Kills Are Announcing A Sequel to The Silver Scream!|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2021/07/08/looks-like-ice-nine-kills-are-announcing-a-sequel-to-the-silver-scream/|access-date=2021-07-08|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref> The album was released on October 15, 2021.

The single, which features [[Papa Roach]] frontman [[Jacoby Shaddix]], was released on July 9, along with an accompanying music video.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Paul 'Browny'|date=2021-07-08|title=Ice Nine Kills Drop ‘Hip To Be Scared’ feat.

On August 3, 2021, the band released a teaser video featuring the album's track listing, leading fans to predict and speculate the horror/thriller movies that inspired the songs on the album.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Paul 'Browny'|date=2021-08-04|title=Let The Silver Scream 2 Song Inspiration Speculation Begin...|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2021/08/04/let-the-silver-scream-2-song-inspiration-speculation-begin/|access-date=2021-08-04|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref>

The band started releasing music videos leading up to the release of the album on July 9 with "Hip to Be Scared". The video started a storyline for the album that continued on August 9 with "Assault & Batteries", which is inspired by the original ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'' film. The video continued the storyline and revealed more than "Hip to Be Scared". The storyline continued on September 9 with "Rainy Day", which is inspired by the ''[[Resident Evil (game)|Resident Evil]]'' game series. Like "Assault and Batteries". the video showed more to the storyline and even gave a plot. The plot of the storyline is that the lead singer of the band is arrested for murders he committed in the videos and an officer is trying to get evidence before the trial happens. The storyline segments of the videos also have cameos by James A. Janisse and Chelsea Rebecca from the YouTube channel Dead Meat, along with [[Bill Moseley]]. The final single that was released was "Funeral Derangements" which was based on the cult-classic book [[Pet Sematary]] by [[Stephen King]], and the [[Pet Sematary (1989 film)|movie]] which it inspired. It features the original actor of Gage Creed, [[Miko Hughes]], who this time plays the truck driver instead. This continues the story of the music videos being released, showing that The Silence killed Nadia with three stabs to the chest, two to the stomach, and one to the back.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}
