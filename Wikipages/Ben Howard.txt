==Early life==
Benjamin John Howard was born on 24 April 1987 in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[London|south-west London]], England,<ref name="esm">{{cite journal|last=Herrmann|first=Joshi|date=28 August 2014|title=Ben Howard: 'The more attention I got, the less I wanted it'|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/ben-howard-the-more-attention-i-got-the-less-i-wanted-it-9696858.html|journal=ES Magazine|publisher=Evening Standard|page=15}}</ref> and moved near [[Totnes]], [[Devon]]<ref name="esm"/> when he was about eight. He was raised by musical parents who exposed him to their favourite records from singer-songwriter artists from the 1960s and 1970s at an early age, such as [[John Martyn]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Simon & Garfunkel]], by whom he was strongly influenced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9kTSDfiE7k |title=Ben Howard interview with Absolute Radio's Pete Donaldson |publisher=YouTube |date=23 January 2012 |access-date=29 June 2013}}</ref>

Howard began writing songs when he was eleven.<ref name="esm"/> In an interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'', he stated that when he was a kid he started playing guitar because he liked to put words together and make stuff up. "I was quite an imaginative little kid I guess. So your standard little love songs turned into your standard adolescent love songs. I think you start getting your own take on things when you're a late teen. That's when everything changes."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/ben-howard/ |title=Ben Howard |publisher=American Songwriter |date=27 May 2012 |access-date=29 June 2013}}</ref> Besides playing the guitar, Howard also played other instruments as a kid. He easily picked up the drums and contrabass, but after some time he decided to focus on the guitar. After attending [[King Edward VI Community College]] and [[Torquay Boys' Grammar School]] he began studying Journalism at [[University College Falmouth]]. Six months prior to completion of his course, Howard decided to focus on making music full-time, making melodic rootsy [[Folk music|folk]] music, with progressively darker lyrics. His reputation grew around Devon, and soon spread to other areas of the UK. After a month of sold-out dates across Europe and the UK Howard was eventually asked to sign for Island Records.

Due to his association with the town, Howard was chosen in 2014 to appear on the 10 [[Totnes pound]] note.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Meet-new-faces-local-currency/story-21152600-detail/story.html|title=Meet the new faces of local currency|date=28 May 2014|website=[[Western Morning News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810153519/http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Meet-new-faces-local-currency/story-21152600-detail/story.html|archive-date=10 August 2014|url-status=dead|access-date=17 October 2018}}</ref>

==Music career==
===2008–2011: Early releases===
Before signing to a record label, Howard had already released some material. In 2008 he self-released his debut EP ''Games in the Dark''.

Howard now had enough material to release an album, ''[[Every Kingdom]]'', which would feature a number of his previous singles. One of the songs from this album, 'Promise' was used in the first episode of ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tunefind.com/show/the-100/season-1/17925|title=Music from The 100 S1E01|website=Tunefind}}</ref> In 2010, he also started supporting [[Angus & Julia Stone]]'s concerts in Europe.

===2011–13: ''Every Kingdom''===
Howard signed to Island Records in 2011, due to the label's history of [[Folk music of England|UK folk singers]], including [[Nick Drake]] and [[John Martyn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islandrecords.co.uk/group_artists.php?id=174# |title=Ben Howard - Artists |publisher=Island Records |access-date=29 June 2013}}</ref> After singles "Old Pine" and "[[The Wolves (Ben Howard song)|The Wolves]]" were released in 2011, Howard recorded his debut album entitled ''[[Every Kingdom]]'', which was released on 3 October 2011. He was nominated for the 2012 ''[[Mercury Prize]]''.

Howard worked alongside India Bourne, Marcus Wright and Chris Bond to make ''Every Kingdom'', with Bourne playing cello, keyboards, ukulele, bass and contributing vocals and percussion, Bond playing guitars, bass, double bass, drums, percussion, keyboards, accordion, contributing to vocals, and also producing the record, and additional modular-dynamic (MD) synthesisers provided by Wright.

In November 2012, Howard released ''[[The Burgh Island EP]]'' produced by Chris Bond, which featured four new tracks. Once again released to critical acclaim, the EP had a darker, more menacing tone than most of Howard's previous work, with Howard also playing electric guitar, rather than his traditional acoustic.  The second track from the EP, "Oats in the Water", was featured in [[Internment (The Walking Dead)|Internment]], the 5th episode in Season 4 of AMC's ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]],'' in the 1st episode in season 3 of Fox's ''[[The Following (TV series)|The Following]],'' and in the release trailer for ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]''.

==Personal life==
Howard has been in a relationship with Agatha Lintott since 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last=Paton|first=Elizabeth|title=Could Antibad Become the Net-a-Porter of Green Style?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/fashion/antibad-sustainable-fashion-independent-designers.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 December 2018|access-date=6 March 2021}}</ref> Howard is a supporter of [[Liverpool F.C.]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56243403 |title=Premier League predictions: Lawro v singer-songwriter & Liverpool fan Ben Howard |website=[[BBC Sport]] |date=5 March 2021 |access-date=5 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fleming|first=Scott|title=The National's Aaron Dessner: 'We plan our tour around LFC games' |url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/features/353407-the-national-aaron-dessner-liverpool-fc-interview |website=Liverpool F.C. |date=11 June 2019 |access-date=5 March 2021}}</ref>

==Guitar style==
Howard plays guitar left-handed and makes extensive use of alternate tunings. He does this for songs such as CGCGGC (Old Pine, Everything), DADGAD (In Dreams) and CGA#GFC (End of the Affair, Esmerelda). He also complements these tunings by using a partial [[capo]] for many songs (Further Away, Everything, End of the Affair) in order to use harmonic or bass notes otherwise unavailable.

He also has a distinctive percussive strumming style, called the "pick and go",<ref>{{Citation|last=TotalGuitar|title=Ben Howard explains his 'pick and go' acoustic guitar technique and plays new song (TG241)|date=7 May 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Q1q51ftSU|access-date=10 February 2017}}</ref> and Howard's method of laying the guitar flat on top of his knees and playing it percussively was influenced by contemporary folk songwriter and guitarist [[John Smith (musician)|John Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auoz7oymOZU&t=2m03s|title=Ben Howard talks about John Smith's influence on his guitar style.|date=28 December 2009|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=6 April 2018}}</ref>
