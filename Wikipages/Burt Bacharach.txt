'''Burt Freeman Bacharach''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|k|ər|æ|k}} {{respell|BAK|ə-rak}}; born May 12, 1928) is an American composer, songwriter, record producer, and [[pianist]] who composed hundreds of pop songs from the late 1950s through the 1980s, many in collaboration with lyricist [[Hal David]]. A six-time [[Grammy Award]] winner and three-time [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner, Bacharach's songs have been recorded by more than 1,000 different artists.<ref name=Telegraph /> {{As of|2014}}, he had written 73 US and 52 UK [[Top 40]] hits.<ref name="house">{{cite web|  url=http://www.bacharachonline.com/bacharach_bio.html| title=Burt Bacharach: A House Is Not A Homepage| publisher=Bacharachonline.com| access-date=May 19, 2011}}</ref> He is considered one of the most important composers of 20th-century [[popular music]].<ref name="am bio">{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Bush|title=Burt Bacharach|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/burt-bacharach-mn0000642542/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

His music is characterized by unusual chord progressions, influenced by his background in [[jazz harmony]], and uncommon selections of instruments for small orchestras. Most of Bacharach's and David's hits were written specifically for and performed by [[Dionne Warwick]], but earlier associations (from 1957 to 1963) saw the composing duo work with [[Marty Robbins]], [[Perry Como]], [[Gene McDaniels]], and [[Jerry Butler]]. Following the initial success of these collaborations, Bacharach went on to write hits for [[Gene Pitney]], [[Cilla Black]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Jackie DeShannon]], [[Bobbie Gentry]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Herb Alpert]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[the Carpenters]], among numerous other artists. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output.

Songs that he co-wrote which have topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] include "[[This Guy's in Love with You]]" (1968), "[[Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head]]" (1969), "[[(They Long to Be) Close to You]]" (1970), "[[Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)]]" (1981), and "[[That's What Friends Are For]]" (1986).

A significant figure in [[easy listening]],{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=176}} Bacharach is described by writer [[William Farina]] as "a composer whose venerable name can be linked with just about every other prominent musical artist of his era". In later years, his songs were newly appropriated for the soundtracks of major feature films, by which time "tributes, compilations, and revivals were to be found everywhere".{{sfn|Farina|2013|p=144}} He has been noted for his influence on later musical movements such as [[chamber pop]]<ref name="am chamberpop">{{cite web|title=Chamber pop|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/chamber-pop-ma0000012300|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> and [[Shibuya-kei]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Cam|title=Return to the Planet of Cornelius|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/return-to-the-planet-of-cornelius|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name="am shibuya">{{cite web|title=Shibuya-Kei|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/shibuya-kei-ma0000011840|website=[[AllMusic]]|date=n.d.}}</ref> In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Bacharach and David at number 32 for their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|journal=Rolling Stone|date=August 2015|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-songwriters#burt-bacharach-and-hal-david}}</ref> In 2012, the duo received the [[Library of Congress]] [[Gershwin Prize]] for Popular Song, the first time the honor has been given to a songwriting team.<ref name=Gershwin />

''Anyone Who Had a Heart: My Life and Music'', HarperCollins (2013), ebook Chapter 1, "The Story of My Life".</ref>

Bacharach showed a keen interest in [[jazz]] as a teenager, disliking his classical piano lessons, and often used a [[Identity document forgery|fake ID]] to gain admission into [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] nightclubs.<ref name=Telegraph /> He got to hear [[bebop]] musicians such as [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Count Basie]], whose style would later influence his songwriting.<ref name="jazz">{{cite web|url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/15170-burt-bacharach-blue-bacharach|title=Burt Bacharach: Blue Bacharach|publisher=[[Jazz Times]]|access-date= July 16, 2013|date=December 2004}}</ref>

Bacharach studied music (Bachelor of Music, 1948) at [[Montreal]]'s [[McGill University]], under Helmut Blume, at the [[Mannes School of Music]], and at the [[Music Academy of the West]] in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]], California. During this period he studied a range of music, including [[jazz harmony]], which has since been important to songs which are generally considered pop music. His composition teachers included [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Henry Cowell]],<ref name=pc24 /> and [[Bohuslav Martinů]]. Bacharach cites Milhaud as his biggest influence,  under whose guidance he wrote a "Sonatina for Violin, Oboe and Piano".<ref name="jazz" />

==Beginning work as a musician==
Bacharach served a tour of duty in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] from 1950-1952.<ref name="online">[http://www.bacharachonline.com/bacharach_bio.html Burt Bacharach: A House Is Not A Homepage] www.bacharachonline.com.

Retrieved November 21, 2021.</ref> Following his discharge, Bacharach spent the next three years as a pianist and conductor for popular singer [[Vic Damone]]. Damone recalls: "Burt was clearly bound to go out on his own. He was an exceptionally talented, classically trained pianist, with very clear ideas on the musicality of songs, how they should be played, and what they should sound like. I appreciated his musical gifts."<ref>Damone, Vic. ''Singing Was the Easy Part'', Macmillan (2009) ebook.</ref> He later worked in similar capacity for various other singers, including [[Polly Bergen]], [[Steve Lawrence]], the [[Ames Brothers]] and [[Paula Stewart]] (who became his first wife). When he was unable to find better jobs, Bacharach worked at resorts in the [[Catskill Mountains]] of New York, where he accompanied singers such as [[Joel Grey]].<ref>"Burt Bacharach: A Composer Steps Onstage with Shower of Swinging, Successful Melodies", ''Chicago Tribune'', June 14, 1970.</ref>

In 1956, at the age of 28, Bacharach's productivity increased when composer [[Peter Matz]] recommended him to [[Marlene Dietrich]], who needed an arranger and conductor for her nightclub shows.<ref>"Bachrach recalls Dietrich", ''Independent Press-Telegram'' (Long Beach, California), March 14, 1971, p. 90.</ref> He then became part-time music director for Dietrich, the actress and singer who had been an international screen star in the 1930s.<ref>Mossman, Kate (July 18, 2013), [http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/07/burt-bacharach-direct-line-lost-musical-world "Burt Bacharach is a direct line to a lost musical world"], ''New Statesman''.</ref> They toured worldwide off and on until the early 1960s; when they were not touring, he wrote songs.<ref name=Telegraph2>Barber, Richard (June 10, 2016), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/burt-bacharach-at-88-why-would-i-ever-want-to-stop/ "Burt Bacharach at 88: 'Why would I ever want to stop?'"], ''The Telegraph'' U.K.</ref> As a result of his collaboration with Dietrich, he gained his first major recognition as a conductor and arranger.<ref name=Muncie>"Press Raps With Marlene While She Raps the Press", ''The Star Press'' (Muncie, IN), January 12, 1973, p. 22.</ref><ref name=PBSvideo />

In her autobiography, Dietrich wrote that Bacharach loved touring in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] because the violinists were "extraordinary", and musicians were greatly appreciated by the public. He liked [[Edinburgh]] and [[Paris]], along with the [[Scandinavian countries]], and "he also felt at home in [[Israel]]", she wrote, where music was similarly "much revered".<ref name=Dietrich>Dietrich, Marlene. ''Marlene'', Grove Press (1989).</ref> Their working relationship ceased by the early 1960s, after about five years with Dietrich, with Bacharach telling her that he wanted to devote himself full-time to songwriting.

==Songwriting career==

===1950s and 1960s===
In 1957, Bacharach and lyricist [[Hal David]] met while at the [[Brill Building]] in New York City, and began their writing partnership.<ref name="Burt Bacharach remembers Hal David">{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-hal-david-burt-bacharach-appreciation-20120904,0,2503388.story |title=Burt Bacharach remembers Hal David |date=September 3, 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>  They received a career breakthrough when their song "[[The Story of My Life (Burt Bacharach and Hal David song)|The Story of My Life]]" was recorded by [[Marty Robbins]], becoming a number 1 hit on the U.S. Country Chart<ref>Whitburn, Joel (2004).

Soon afterwards, "[[Magic Moments]]" was recorded by [[Perry Como]] for [[RCA Records]], and reached No. 4 in the U.S. These two songs were back-to-back No. 1 singles in the UK (the British chart-topping "The Story of My Life" version was sung by [[Michael Holliday]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19580228/7501/ |title=Official Singles Chart Top 30: 28 February 1958-06 March 1958 |website=Official Charts |access-date=June 25, 2020}}</ref> giving Bacharach and David the honor of being the first songwriters to have written consecutive No. 1 UK singles.

Despite Bacharach’s early success with Hal David, he spent several years in the early 1960s writing songs with other lyricists, primarily [[Bob Hilliard]]. Some of the more successful Bacharach-Hilliard songs include “[[Please Stay (Burt Bacharach song)|Please Stay]]” ([[The Drifters]], 1961), “[[Tower of Strength (Gene McDaniels song)|Tower of Strength]]” ([[Gene McDaniels]], 1961), “[[Any Day Now (Burt Bacharach song)|Any Day Now (My Wild Beautiful Bird)]]” ([[Chuck Jackson]], 1962), and “Mexican Divorce” (The Drifters, 1962).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-look-of-love-the-burt-bacharach-collection-mw0000214412|website=AllMusic|title=The Look of Love: The Burt Bacharach Collection|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|accessdate=October 25, 2021}}</ref> In 1961 Bacharach was credited as arranger and producer, for the first time on both label and sleeve, for the song "[[Three Wheels on My Wagon]]", written jointly with Hilliard for [[Dick Van Dyke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/ep6057|title=The New Christy Minstrels - Three Wheels On My Wagon|via=www.45cat.com}}</ref><ref name=BB>{{citation |title=Burt Bacharach, song by song |page=56 |first=Serene |last=Dominic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cz5bAwAAQBAJ&q=wheels |year=2003|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|isbn=978-0825672804}}</ref>

Bacharach and David formed a writing partnership in 1963. Bacharach's career received a boost when singer [[Jerry Butler]] asked to record "[[Make it Easy on Yourself]]," and wanted him to direct the recording sessions. It became the first time he managed the entire recording process for one of his own songs.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/21/30-minutes-with-burt-bacharach-interview |title=Burt Bacharach: Marlene Dietrich's music sucked!

In the early and mid-1960s, Bacharach wrote well over a hundred songs with David. In 1961 Bacharach discovered singer [[Dionne Warwick]] while she was a session accompanist. That year the two, along with Dionne's sister [[Dee Dee Warwick]], released a single "Move It on the Backbeat" under the name Burt and the Backbeats.<ref name=Leszczak>Leszczak, Bob.

Bacharach and David then wrote more songs to make use of Warwick's singing talents, which led to one of the most successful teams in popular music history.<ref name="collection">{{citation| title=The Look of Love: The Burt Bacharach Collection-Liner Notes| date=November 3, 1998| medium=Audio CD| publisher=Rhino/WEA}}</ref> Over the next 20 years, Warwick's recordings of his songs sold over 12 million copies,<ref name=Lohof />{{rp|23}} with 38 singles making the charts and 22 in the Top 40. Among the hits were [[Walk On By (song)|"Walk on By"]], [[Anyone Who Had a Heart (song)|"Anyone Who Had a Heart"]], [[Alfie (Burt Bacharach song)|"Alfie"]], "[[I Say a Little Prayer]]", "[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]", and [[Do You Know the Way to San Jose|"Do You Know the Way to San Jose?"]] She would eventually have more hits during her career than any other female vocalist except Aretha Franklin.<ref name=Warwick />

Bacharach released his first solo album in 1965 on the [[Kapp Records]] label.  "Hit Maker! Burt Bacharach Plays His Hits" was largely ignored in the US but rose to No. 3 on the UK album charts, where his version of "[[Trains and Boats and Planes]]" had become a top 5 single. In 1967, Bacharach signed as an artist with A&M Records, recording a mix of new material and re-arrangements of his best-known songs.  He recorded for A&M until 1978.

Although Bacharach's compositions are typically more complex than the average pop song, he has expressed surprise in the fact that many jazz musicians have sought inspiration from his works, saying "I've sometimes felt that my songs are restrictive for a jazz artist. I was excited when [Stan] Getz did a whole album of my music" (''What The World Needs Now: Stan Getz Plays The Burt Bacharach Songbook'', Verve, 1968).<ref name="jazz" />

His songs were adapted by a few jazz artists of the time, such as [[Stan Getz]], [[Cal Tjader]], [[Grant Green]], and [[Wes Montgomery]]. The Bacharach/David composition "[[My Little Red Book]]", originally recorded by [[Manfred Mann]] for the film ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'', has become a rock standard.<ref>{{cite book| first=Robin| last=Platts| title=Burt Bacharach & Hal David: What the World Needs Now| year=2003| publisher=Collector's Guide Publishing| isbn=978-1-896522-77-7}}</ref>

Bacharach composed and arranged the soundtrack of the 1967 film ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]],'' which included "[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]", performed by Dusty Springfield, and the title song, an instrumental Top 40 single for Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. The resulting soundtrack album is widely considered to be one of the finest engineered vinyl recordings of all time, and is much sought after by [[audiophile]] collectors.<ref>Burlinghame, Jon (2012), ''The Music of James Bond'', OUP, p. 68.</ref>

Bacharach and David also collaborated with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producer [[David Merrick]] on the 1968 musical ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'', which yielded two hits, including the title tune and "[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]". Bacharach and David wrote the song when the producer realized the play urgently needed another before its opening the next evening. Bacharach, who had just been released from the hospital after contracting pneumonia, was still sick, but worked with David's lyrics to write the song which was performed for the show's opening. It was later recorded by Dionne Warwick and was on the charts for several weeks.<ref name=Lohof />{{rp|28}}

The year 1969 marked, perhaps, the most successful Bacharach-David collaboration, the Oscar-winning "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head", written for and prominently featured in the acclaimed film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''. The two were awarded a Grammy for Best Cast album of the year for "Promises, Promises" and the score was also nominated for a Tony award.

Other Oscar nominations for Best Song in the latter half of the 1960s were for "The Look Of Love", "What's New Pussycat?" and "Alfie".<ref name="Burt Bacharach">{{cite web|url=https://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/search/results|website=Oscars.org|title=Burt Bacharach|accessdate=October 25, 2021}}</ref>

Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Bacharach continued to write and produce for artists, compose for stage, TV, and film, and release his own albums. He enjoyed a great deal of visibility in the public spotlight, appearing frequently on TV and performing live in concert. He starred in two televised musical extravaganzas: "An Evening with Burt Bacharach" and "Another Evening with Burt Bacharach," both broadcast nationally on NBC.<ref name=Lohof>Lohof, Bruce.

In 1971, [[Barbra Streisand]] appeared on "The Burt Bacharach Special," (aka "Singer Presents Burt Bacharach") where they discussed their careers and favorite songs and performed songs together.<ref>"Burt Bacharach, Barbra Streisand appear tonight, ''Green Bay Press-Gazette'' (Green Bay, Wisconsin), March 14, 1971.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvdzJnuh29E "Singer Presents Burt Bacharach - with Barbra Streisand"], 1971.

In 1973, Bacharach and David wrote the score for [[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|''Lost Horizon'']], a musical version of [[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|the 1937 film]]. The remake was a critical and commercial disaster and a flurry of [[lawsuits]] resulted between the composer and the lyricist, as well as from Warwick. She reportedly felt abandoned when Bacharach and David refused to work together further.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pukas|first=Anna|date=December 7, 2011|title=Burt Bacharach is back|url=https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/288301/Burt-Bacharach-is-back|access-date=December 29, 2020|website=Express.co.uk|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Chadwick|first=Bruce|title=WARWICK BACK WITH DAVID, BACHARACH|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1992-11-24-9203020664-story.html|access-date=December 29, 2020|website=Sun-Sentinel.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

Bacharach tried several solo projects, including the 1977 album ''Futures'', but the projects failed to yield hits.  He and David reunited briefly in 1975 to write and produce Stephanie Mills' second album, ''[[For the First Time (Stephanie Mills album)|For The First Time]]'', for [[Motown]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Marches|first=John|date=October 1, 2014|title=All The Way To Paradise: BBR Revisits Stephanie Mills, Burt Bacharach, Hal David’s Motown Gem "For The First Time"|url=https://theseconddisc.com/2014/10/01/all-the-way-to-paradise-bbr-revisits-stephanie-mills-burt-bacharach-hal-davids-motown-gem-for-the-first-time/}}</ref>

By the early 1980s, Bacharach's marriage to [[Angie Dickinson]] had ended, but a new partnership with lyricist [[Carole Bayer Sager]] proved rewarding, both commercially and personally. The two married and collaborated on several major hits during the decade, including "[[Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)]]" ([[Christopher Cross]]), co-written with Cross and Peter Allen, which won an Academy Award for Best Song;<ref name="Burt Bacharach"/> "[[Heartlight (song)|Heartlight]]" ([[Neil Diamond]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/neil-diamond-carole-bayer-sager-and-burt-bacharach-picture-id105918140|title=Photo of Neil Diamond with Sager and Bacharach in 1987|access-date=February 11, 2018}}</ref> "[[Making Love (song)|Making Love]]" ([[Roberta Flack]]); "[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)|On My Own]]" ([[Patti LaBelle]] with [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]].)

Another of their hits, "[[That's What Friends Are For]]" in 1985, reunited Bacharach and Warwick. When asked about their coming together again, she explained:

{{blockquote|We realized we were more than just friends. We were family. Time has a way of giving people the opportunity to grow and understand ... Working with Burt is not a bit different from how it used to be. He expects me to deliver and I can. He knows what I'm going to do before I do it, and the same with me. That's how intertwined we've been.<ref name=Show>"Two for the Show: Their musical falling-out long behind them, Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach prove that staying apart is hard to do," ''The News Journal'' (Wilmington, Delaware), January 13, 1997.</ref>}}

Other artists continued to revive Bacharach's earlier hits in the 1980s and 1990s. Examples included Luther Vandross' recording of "A House is Not a Home"; [[Naked Eyes]]' 1983 pop hit version of "[[(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me]]", and [[Ronnie Milsap]]'s 1982 country version of "[[Any Day Now (Burt Bacharach song)|Any Day Now]]". Bacharach continued a concert career, appearing at auditoriums throughout the world, often with large orchestras. He occasionally joined Warwick for sold-out concerts in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and New York, where they performed at the [[Rainbow Room]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ifc8rZRCwMo|title=Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach: Live at The Rainbow Room (1996)|date=November 3, 2014|access-date=February 11, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

===1990s and beyond===
[[File:Burt Bacharach 2013 (9219552969).jpg|thumb|left|Bacharach performing in 2013]]
In 1998, Bacharach co-wrote and recorded a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning album with [[Elvis Costello]], ''[[Painted from Memory]]'', on which the compositions began to take on the sound of his earlier work. The duo later reunited for Costello's 2018 album, ''Look Now'', working on several tracks together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2007582/elvis-costello-the-imposters-burt-bacharach-look-now-under-lime-unwanted-number/music/|title=Elvis Costello Reunites With The Imposters & Burt Bacharach On New Album Look Now: Hear Two Songs|website=Stereogum|access-date=April 5, 2019}}</ref>

In 2003, he teamed with singer [[Ronald Isley]] to release the album ''Here I Am'', which revisited a number of his 1960s compositions in Isley's signature R&B style. Bacharach's 2005 solo album ''[[At This Time]]'' was a departure from past works in that Bacharach penned his own lyrics, some of which dealt with political themes. Guest stars on the album included [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and hip-hop producer [[Dr. Dre]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Burt Bacharach: At This Time|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1183-at-this-time/|access-date=December 29, 2020|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref>

In 2008, Bacharach opened the BBC [[BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms|Electric Proms]] at [[Roundhouse (venue)|The Roundhouse]] in London, performing with the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] accompanied by guest vocalists [[Adele]], [[Beth Rowley]] and [[Jamie Cullum]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC - Electric Proms 2008 - Artists - Burt Bacharach|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/electricproms/2008/artists/burtbacharach/|access-date=December 29, 2020|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Electric Proms|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f8l8l|access-date=December 29, 2020|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The concert was a retrospective look back at his six-decade career. In early 2009, Bacharach worked with Italian soul singer Karima Ammar and produced her debut single "Come In Ogni Ora".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Karima {{!}} Video, musica e news {{!}} MTV Italia|url=http://www.mtv.it/musica/artisti/karima/wmjafr|access-date=December 29, 2020|website=www.mtv.it}}</ref>

In June 2015, Bacharach performed in the UK at the [[Glastonbury Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e84mxj/acts/aj5mzc|title=Glastonbury 2015 - Burt Bacharach|website=BBC Music Events|access-date=February 11, 2018}}</ref> and a few weeks later appeared on stage at the [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] to launch 'What's It All About? Bacharach Reimagined', a 90-minute live arrangement of his hits.

In 2016, Bacharach, at 88 years old, composed and arranged his first original score in 16 years for the film ''[[A Boy Called Po]]'' (along with composer Joseph Bauer<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.varesesarabande.com/products/po-digital-only|title=A Boy Called Po (Digital Only) {{!}} Varèse Sarabande|last=Sarabande|first=Varèse|website=Varèse Sarabande|access-date=September 11, 2017}}</ref>).

Though not known for political songs, "Live To See Another Day" was released in 2018. "Dedicated to survivors of school gun violence" proceeds for the release went to charity Sandy Hook Promise, a non-profit organization founded and led by several family members whose loved ones were killed at [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook Elementary School]] in 2012.

In July 2020, Bacharach collaborated with songwriter and multi-instrumentalist [[Daniel Tashian]] on the EP "Blue Umbrella", Bacharach's first new material in 15 years.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Daniel Tashian and Burt Bacharach Turn Pop to Their Own Purposes on Blue Umbrella|url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/features/article/21141538/daniel-tashian-and-burt-bacharach-turn-pop-to-their-own-purposes-on-blue-umbrella|access-date=March 11, 2021|website=Nashville Scene|language=en}}</ref> The EP earned both Bacharach and Tashian a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] for the [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]].

==Film and television==
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bacharach was featured in a dozen television musical and variety specials videotaped in the UK for [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]]; several were nominated for [[Emmy Award]]s for direction (by [[Dwight Hemion]]). The guests included artists such as [[Joel Grey]], Dusty Springfield,<ref name=Dusty>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J3J2GQckF4|title=Dusty Springfield - A House Is Not A Home|last=Frans Jansen|date=November 2, 2008|access-date=February 11, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> [[Dionne Warwick]], and [[Barbra Streisand]]. Bacharach and David did the score for an original musical for ABC-TV titled ''On the Flip Side'', broadcast on ''[[ABC Stage 67]]'', starring [[Ricky Nelson]] as a faded pop star trying for a comeback. While the ratings were dismal, the soundtrack showcased Bacharach's abilities to try different kinds of musical styles, ranging from (almost) 1960s rock, to pop, ballads, and Latin-tinged dance numbers.

In 1969, [[Harry Betts]] arranged Bacharach's instrumental composition "Nikki" (named for Bacharach's daughter) into a new theme for the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'', a television series that ran on the U.S. network until 1976.

During the 1970s, Bacharach and then-wife Angie Dickinson appeared in several television commercials for [[Martini & Rossi]] beverages, and Bacharach even penned a short jingle ("Say Yes") for the spots. He also occasionally appeared on television/variety shows, such as ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and many others.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Bacharach had [[cameo role]]s in Hollywood movies, including all three [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, inspired by his score for the 1967 [[James Bond]] parody film ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.

Bacharach appeared as a celebrity performer and guest vocal coach for contestants on the television show, "[[American Idol]]" during the 2006 season, during which an entire episode was dedicated to his music. In 2008, Bacharach featured in the [[BBC Electric Proms]] at [[The Roundhouse]] with the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]].<ref name="bbc">{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/electricproms/2008/schedule/| title=BBC Electric Proms 2008|publisher=BBC | access-date=May 19, 2011}}</ref> He performed similar shows in the same year at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]]<ref name="npr">{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92182050| title=Close To You: Burt Bacharach In Concert| date=July 3, 2008| publisher=npr.org| access-date=May 19, 2011}}</ref> and with the [[Sydney Symphony]].

==Musical style==
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = |quote=The whole room would come to life with his conducting&nbsp;— the way he would look over at the drummer and with just a flick of his finger, things could happen. Once the groove was happening in the room, forget it; there was nothing like it. And everything, including the strings, responded to the kind of body movement that Burt had. He brings an incredible amount of life to the studio. He's probably one of the most amazing musicians in the world.|source= —Record producer [[Phil Ramone]]<ref name=Mojo>''The Mojo Collection: 4th Edition'', Canongate Books (2003), p. 165.</ref>}}

Bacharach's music is characterized by unusual chord progressions, influenced by jazz harmony, with striking syncopated rhythmic patterns, irregular phrasing, frequent modulation, and odd, changing meters. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output.<ref name=Musiker>Musiker, Naomi, and Musiker, Reuben. ''Conductors and Composers of Popular Orchestral Music'', Routledge (1998), ebook.</ref> Though his style is sometimes called "[[easy listening]]", he has expressed apprehension regarding that label. According to ''NJ.com'' contributor Mark Voger, "It may be easy on the ears, but it's anything but easy. The precise arrangements, the on-a-dime shifts in meter, and the mouthfuls of lyrics required to service all those notes have, over the years, proven challenging to singers and musicians."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Voger|first1=Mark|title=Burt Bacharach bound for Red Bank, Englewood|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/02/burt_bacharach.html|work=[[nj.com]]|date=February 28, 2015}}</ref> Bacharach's selection of instruments included [[flugelhorn]]s, bossa nova sidesticks, breezy flutes, [[tack piano]], ''molto fortissimo'' strings and cooing female voices.<ref name=Mojo /> According to editors of ''The Mojo Collection'', it led to what became known as the "Bacharach Sound".<ref name=Mojo /> He explains:

{{blockquote|I didn't want to make the songs the same way as they'd been done, so I'd split vocals and instrumentals and try to make it interesting&nbsp; ... For me, it's about the peaks and valleys of where a record can take you. You can tell a story and be able to be explosive one minute, then get quiet as kind of a satisfying resolution.<ref name=Mojo />}}

While he did not mind singing during live performances, he sought mostly to avoid it on records. When he did sing, he explains, "I [tried] to sing the songs not as a singer, but just interpreting it as a composer and interpreting a great lyric that Hal [David] wrote."<ref name=Mojo /> When performing in front of live audiences, he would often conduct while playing piano,<ref>Schoeneweis, Barbara.

==Personal life==
[[File:Burt Bacharach - Angie Dickinson -1965.jpg|thumb|240px|With his second wife, actress [[Angie Dickinson]], in 1965]]
Bacharach has been married four times. His first marriage was to [[Paula Stewart]] and lasted five years (1953–1958). His second marriage was to actress [[Angie Dickinson]], lasting for 15 years (1965–1980).<ref name="film" />  Bacharach and Dickinson had a daughter named Nikki Bacharach, who struggled with [[Asperger's Syndrome]] and took her own life on January 4, 2007 at the age of 40.<ref>"Bacharach, Lea 'Nikki'", ''Los Angeles Times'' (January 8, 2007): B9.</ref>

Bacharach's third marriage was to lyricist [[Carole Bayer Sager]], which lasted nine years (1982–1991). Bacharach and Bayer Sager collaborated on a number of musical pieces and adopted a son named Cristopher. This marriage is mentioned in [[Monty Python]]'s ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]''. Bacharach married his fourth wife, Jane Hansen, in 1993; they have two children, a son named Oliver, and a daughter named Raleigh.<ref name=Telegraph2 /> His autobiography, ''Anyone Who Had a Heart'', was published in 2013.
