Also, their song "Outside" is sampled in the Sublime song "[[Smoke Two Joints]]" for the line "Smoked cigarettes 'til the day she died!" The Ziggens contributed a cover of the song "[[Sublime (album)|Paddle Out]]" to the Sublime tribute album ''[[Look at All the Love We Found]]'', released in June 2005. The Ziggens' bassist Jon Poutney formed the supergroup [[Volcano (supergroup)|Volcano]] with [[Meat Puppets]] frontman [[Curt Kirkwood]], Sublime drummer [[Bud Gaugh]], and Sublime soundman [[Michael Happoldt|Michael 'Miguel' Happoldt]] after the breakup of [[Eyes Adrift]]. They released one self-titled studio album in 2004. More recently, Bud Gaugh formed the band Jelly of the Month Club, a [[children's music]] side project, with Bert Susanka.
