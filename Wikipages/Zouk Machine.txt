==History==

Founded in 1986 by the members of [[Experience 7]], Guy Houllier and Yves Honore, and composed by three Guadeloupians (Joëlle Ursull, Christiane Obydol, Dominique Zorobabel), the group became successful with their first album ''Sové Lanmou'' (composed by Guy Houllier and Yves Honoré, who are respectively Christiane Obydol's brother and brother-in-law). [[Joëlle Ursull]] left the group and embarked on a solo career, taking second place in the 1990 [[Eurovision]] with ''"[[White and Black Blues]]"'', composed by [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and Sylvain Augier.

In the early 1990s, Jane Fostin (from a large musical family in [[Guadeloupe]]) was recruited to continue ahead.

Therefore, the success of the group overstepped the Caribbean community and the song "[[Maldòn|Maldon' (la musique dans la peau)]]" remained number 1 in the Top 50 for nine weeks in 1990. The group carried out some tours around the world, then recording albums ''Sa ké cho'' and ''Clin d'œil''. Various members also participated in [[Maxime Le Forestier]]'s album, ''Passer ma route'', along with Julien Clerc and "Utile", plus the soundtrack of [[Asterix]] ''On vit ensemble'' et ''Au Revoir''.

In 1995, the group had a crisis situation, and BMG released a first [[best of]]. Jane Fostin finally left the group to launch into a solo career. Her first solo single "La Taille de ton amour", cover of Deborah Cox's "Who do you love" was a success in France, where it peaked at #9, followed by 4 albums with [[R&B]] overtones, including a 2006 an album with the Zouk hit single 'Pas de Glace', a duet with Medhy Custos.
