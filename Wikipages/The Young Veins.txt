==History==
On July 6, 2009, [[Ryan Ross]] and [[Jon Walker]] left [[Panic! at the Disco]], citing creative differences as the reason for their departure. Soon afterwards, it was announced that their new project would be a retro-leaning rock band called The Young Veins. Their song "Change" debuted on the duo's [[Myspace]] page,<ref name="mtv exclusive"/> and their first album, ''[[Take a Vacation!]]'', was announced. In late 2009 three additional members joined the band: Nick Murray on drums, Andy Soukal on bass and Nick White on keyboards. Three songs from ''Take a Vacation!'' were released as singles in April and May 2010, and the album itself was released in June 2010. 

On December 10, 2010, guitarist [[Jon Walker]] announced via [[Twitter]] that the band is currently on hiatus: "The Young Veins has been on hiatus and will remain that way for the time being. Thanks for getting the album and coming to the shows."<ref name = "tweet">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/iamjonwalker/status/13323627550212096|title=Twitter announcement|access-date = 12 October 2012|author=Jon Walker}}</ref>{{bettersource|date=December 2016}}

In 2019, the band released a deluxe edition of ''Take a Vacation!'' online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/theyoungveins/f06C|title = Take a Vacation! (Deluxe Edition) by the Young Veins - DistroKid}}</ref>

==Musical style==
[[AllMusic]] biographer Andrew Leahey described the band's sound as being "vintage pop/rock", influenced by [[the Cookies]], [[the Kinks]], and [[the Cramps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-young-veins-mn0002442584/biography|title=The Young Veins {{!}} Biography & History |work=AllMusic|author=Leahey, Andrew |access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref> AllMusic reviewer Mark Deming considered ''[[Take a Vacation!]]'' (2010) as being inspired by "early British Invasion era pop/rock", specifically listing bands such as the Kinks, [[the Hollies]] and [[The Searchers (band)|the Searchers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/take-a-vacation%21-mw0001986166|title=Take a Vacation! - The Young Veins {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits |work=AllMusic|author=Deming, Mark |access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref>
