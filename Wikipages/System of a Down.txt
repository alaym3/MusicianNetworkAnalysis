The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]]. System of a Down has been nominated for four [[Grammy Awards]] and their song "[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 2006. The band went on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010. Other than two new songs in 2020 ("[[Protect the Land]]" and "[[Genocidal Humanoidz]]"),<ref name="rollingstone2020">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/system-of-a-down-new-songs-protect-the-land-genocidal-humanoidz-1085942/|author=Grow, Kory|title=Hear System of a Down's First New Music in 15 Years, 'Protect the Land' and 'Genocidal Humanoidz'|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=November 5, 2020}}</ref> System of a Down has not released a full-length record since the ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]]'' and ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]]'' albums in 2005. The band has sold over 40 million records worldwide, while two of their singles "[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]" and "[[Hypnotize (System of a Down song)|Hypnotize]]" reached number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Alternative Songs]] chart.

All members of System of a Down are of [[Armenia]]n descent, being born to Armenian immigrants or immigrating from Armenia themselves.

== History ==
=== Soil (1992–1994) ===
Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian attended [[Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School]] as children, although due to their eight-year age difference they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio.<ref>Meyers, Ben. ''System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood'' (2007), p.&nbsp;14.</ref> They formed a band named Soil with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan (who later played in [[The Apex Theory]]/[[Mt. Helium]]) on bass and Domingo "Dingo" Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian (another Rose and Alex Pilibos alumnus) as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as a bassist. In 1994, after only one live show at the Roxy and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.

=== Demo tapes and signing (1994–1997) ===
After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled "Victims of a Down".<ref name="blogs.myspace.com">{{cite web |title=OnTroniK: System of a Down Information |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |access-date=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220180824/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |archive-date=February 20, 2010  }}</ref> The word "victims" was changed to "system" because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, [[Slayer]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 30, 2018|title=7 Things You Didn't Know About System of a Down's Self-Titled Album|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-system-downs-self-titled-album|access-date=December 17, 2020|website=Revolver|language=en}}</ref> Odadjian switched from guitar to bass and passed on his managerial duties to [[Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group]] and its founder David "Beno" Benveniste.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview With David 'Beno' Benveniste |work=lamusicblog.com |date=March 13, 2011 |url=http://lamusicblog.com/2011/03/industry-profile/interview-with-beno-of-velvet-hammer |access-date=August 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731110059/http://lamusicblog.com/2011/03/industry-profile/interview-with-beno-of-velvet-hammer/ |archive-date=July 31, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band recruited drummer [[Ontronik Khachaturian|Ontronik "Andy" Khachaturian]], an old school friend of Malakian and Odadjian who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens.<ref name="blogs.myspace.com" />

In early 1995, System of a Down performed under the name Soil at the Cafe Club Fais Do-Do, a nightclub in [[Los Angeles]]. Shortly after the event, System of a Down made what is known as ''Untitled 1995 Demo Tape'', which was not commercially released but appeared on file sharing networks around the time of the band's success with ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'' about six years later. ''Demo Tape 2'' was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, ''Demo Tape 3''. In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan).<ref name="blogs.myspace.com" /> Khachaturian was replaced by [[John Dolmayan]].

The band's first official and professionally recorded song was on a collection called ''Hye Enk'' ("we're Armenian" in English), an [[Armenian genocide]] recognition compilation in 1997. After playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the [[Whisky-A-Go-Go]] and [[Viper Room]], the band attracted the attention of producer [[Rick Rubin]], who asked them to keep in touch. Showing great interest, the group recorded ''Demo Tape 4'' near the end of 1997, specifically to be sent to [[Record label|record companies]]. Rubin signed the group to his [[American Recordings (record label)|American/Columbia Records]] and, with engineer [[Sylvia Massy]], System began laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album. "I loved them," Rubin recalled. "They were my favourite band, but I didn't think anyone was going to like them apart from a small, likeminded group of people like me who were crazy. No one was waiting for an Armenian heavy metal band. It had to be so good that it transcended all of that."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=The Q Interview: Rick Rubin|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=October 2009|page=98}}</ref>

In 1997, the group won the Best Signed Band Award from the Rock City Awards.<ref name="rc_awards_97">{{cite web |title=Rock City Awards 1997 |work=rockcitynews.com |url=http://www.rockcitynews.com/awards/ballot97.html |access-date=July 25, 2007}}</ref>

=== Self-titled album (1998–2000) ===
In June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, ''[[System of a Down (album)|System of a Down]]''. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles "[[Sugar (System of a Down song)|Sugar]]" and "[[Spiders (System of a Down song)|Spiders]]" became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer and [[Metallica]] before making their way to the second stage of [[Ozzfest]]. Following Ozzfest, they toured with [[Fear Factory]] and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] before headlining the [[Sno-Core Tour]] with [[Puya (band)|Puya]], [[Mr. Bungle]], The Cat and Incubus providing support.

In November 1998, System of a Down appeared on [[South Park]]'s ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album|Chef Aid]]'' album, providing the music for the song "Will They Die 4 You?" Near the end of the song Tankian can be heard saying, "Why must we kill our own kind?", a line that would later be used in the song "Boom!" Although System of a Down is credited on the album, South Park character [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] does not introduce them as he does most of the other artists featured on the record.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chef Aid: The South Park Album |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/chef-aid-the-south-park-album-mw0000601245 |website=Allmusic |access-date=July 9, 2020}}</ref>

=== ''Toxicity'' and ''Steal This Album!'' (2001–2003) ===
[[File:Daron Malakian 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Guitarist [[Daron Malakian]] met Serj Tankian for the first time in 1992 before forming the band a year later.]]
On September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a "thank you" to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans, the performance was cancelled by fire marshalls just before the group took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read "System of a Down" was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band's touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band's manager, David "Beno" Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Down's scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-wraiths-dark-punk-isnt-all-doom-and-gloom-9209187|title=The Wraith's Dark Punk Isn't All Doom and Gloom|last=Rogers|first=Paul|date=March 2, 2018|work=L.A.

The group's big break arrived when their second album, ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'', debuted at No. 1 on the American and Canadian charts. The album has eventually achieved 3x [[multi-platinum]] certification in the United States<ref name=RIAAcert>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=toxicity#search_section|title=RIAA album certifications: System of a Down - Toxicity|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref> It was still on top in America during the week of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding the album's hit single "[[Chop Suey!]]" The song was taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics according to the [[2001 Clear Channel memorandum]] at the time such as "(I don't think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide." Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the album's second single, "[[Toxicity (song)|Toxicity]]". Even with the controversy surrounding "Chop Suey!" (which earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with "Toxicity" and "[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]". In May 2006, [[VH1]] listed "Toxicity" in the number 14 slot in the ''40 Greatest Metal Songs''.

In 2001, the band went on tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470460/20030310/system_of_a_down.jhtml|title=System Of A Down Bassist Sues Security Team For Humiliating Him In Front Of Fans|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=March 10, 2003 |publisher=MTV |access-date=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Despite the incident, the tour was a success and System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour together with [[Rammstein]] in 2001.

In late 2001, unreleased tracks from the ''Toxicity'' sessions made their way onto the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|title=The Daron Malakian Interview|author=Mike Lancaster|date=March 28, 2003|publisher=Glendale High School Newspaper-the Explosion|access-date=July 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081821/http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref> This collection of tracks was dubbed ''Toxicity II'' by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, ''[[Steal This Album!]]'', which was released in November 2002. ''Steal This Album!'' resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. About 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s counter-culture book, ''[[Steal This Book]]'' as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the internet. The song "[[Innervision]]" was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for "Boom!" was filmed with director [[Michael Moore]] as a protest against the [[War in Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web |title=System Of A Down Goes 'Boom' With Moore |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71955/system-of-a-down-goes-boom-with-moore |website=Billboard |access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>

=== ''Mezmerize'', ''Hypnotize'', and hiatus (2004–2006) ===
[[File:Serj Tankian.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Serj Tankian]] has gained a reputation for his large vocal range along with his unusual delivery.|left]]
Between 2004 and 2005, the group recorded the follow-up to ''Steal This Album!'', a double album, which they released as separate installments six months apart. The releases notably included album cover artwork by Malakian's father, Vartan Malakian, and were designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album, ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' was released on May 17, 2005 to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at No. 1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of A Down's second No. 1 album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mezmerize - System of a Down |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mezmerize-mw0000209577#:~:text=AllMusic%20Review%20by%20Johnny%20Loftus,what's%20essentially%20a%20double%20album. |website=Allmusic |access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref> First week sales exceeded 800,000 copies worldwide. The lead single "[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]", which questions the integrity of military recruiting in America, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts, and would go on to win the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards#Rock|2006 Grammy Award]] for Best Hard Rock Performance. "<ref>{{cite web |title=System Of A Down Honored With Grammy For 'Best Hard Performance' |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/system-of-a-down-honored-with-grammy-for-best-hard-rock-performance/ |website=Blabbermouth |date=February 8, 2006 |access-date=10 July 2020}}</ref> [[Question!]]" was released as the next single, with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the album's release, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Bad Acid Trip]] supporting.<ref>{{cite web |title=System Of A Down, Mars Volta Plan Summer Tour |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/63107/system-of-a-down-mars-volta-plan-summer-tour |website=Billboard |access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>

The second part of the double album, ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]],'' was released on November 22, 2005. Like ''Mezmerize'' it debuted at No. 1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with [[The Beatles]], rappers [[2Pac]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at No. 1 in the same year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1516656/system-of-a-down-make-it-a-double-with-chart-topping-hypnotize/|title=System Of A Down Make It A Double With Chart-Topping Hypnotize|work=MTV News|access-date=March 5, 2018|language=en}}</ref> "[[Hypnotize (System of a Down song)|Hypnotize]]" was released as the lead single and was followed by [[Lonely Day]] and [[Vicinity of Obscenity]], all three of which were also released as [[Extended play|EPs]], including several previously-unreleased cover songs as well as a collaboration with the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. [[Kill Rock 'N Roll]] was released as the final promotional single.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hypnotize - System of a Down |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hypnotize-mw0000348196 |website=Allmusic |access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>

Whereas on System of a Down's previous albums most of the lyrics were written and sung by Tankian and the music was co-written by Tankian and Malakian (and sometimes Odadjian), much of the music and lyrics on ''Mezmerize''/''Hypnotize'' were written by Malakian, who also took on a much more dominant role as vocalist on both albums, often leaving Tankian providing keyboards and backing vocals.

System of a Down's song "[[Lonely Day]]" was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|49th Grammy Awards]] in 2007 but lost to "[[Woman (Wolfmother song)|Woman]]" by [[Wolfmother]].

In May 2006 saw the UK publication of a biography of the band entitled ''System of a Down: Right Here in Hollywood'' by writer [[Ben Myers]]. It was published in the US in 2007 through [[The Disinformation Company]]. Additionally in 2006, concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the [[Armenian genocide]] were featured in the film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]],'' directed by [[Carla Garapedian]]. An interview with Tankian's grandfather, a survivor of the Genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankian's and Dolmayan's meeting with (then) Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States government's official recognition of the Genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside the Turkish embassy in Washington D.C. was also used in ''Screamers''.

In May as well, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with ''Guitar'' magazine. He told MTV, "We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy to take some rest."<ref>{{Cite news  |last=Harris |first=Chris |date=May 3, 2006 |title=System of a Down Aren't Breaking Up—They're Going on Hiatus|work=MTV News |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1530066/20060503/system_of_a_down.jhtml |access-date=February 2, 2009}}</ref> System of a Down's final performance before their separation took place on August 13, 2006 in [[West Palm Beach]], Florida. "Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together," Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. "We'll be back.

During the band's hiatus, Malakian formed a band called [[Scars on Broadway]], which was joined by Dolmayan. After one [[Scars on Broadway (album)|self-titled album]], the project became dormant and Dolmayan left the band. However, the band released their long-awaited [[Dictator (Daron Malakian and Scars on Broadway album)|sophomore album]] in 2018, titled "Dictator," under the name Daron Malakian and Scars On Broadway. Dolmayan, alongside working with Scars on Broadway, formed his own band, Indicator.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Indicator - Something Underneath live (John Domayan's new project) - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ilDTZG-yt0&list=PLxkWmILmSITzbR8HY3RLSaqzTOs60zaxA&ab_channel=Nakao|access-date=December 17, 2020|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Dolmayan also released an album titled "These Grey Men." in 2020. The majority of the songs are covers/reimaginings of other songs by artists such as Radiohead, AFI, Madonna and Talking Heads. A few of the songs included featured Serj Tankian as a voice lead.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Album Review: John Dolmayan – These Grey Men|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-john-dolmayan-these-grey-men/|access-date=December 17, 2020|website=Kerrang!}}</ref> Dolmayan has also opened Torpedo Comics, an online comic book store. Odadjian pursued his project with [[RZA]] of [[Wu-Tang Clan]], a hip-hop group named [[Achozen|AcHoZeN]], worked on his urSESSION website/record label and performed as a member of funk legend [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]'s backing band. Meanwhile, Tankian opted for a solo career and released his debut solo album ''[[Elect the Dead]]'' in the autumn of 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Serj Tankian - Elect The Dead (2xLP - Limited Silver Marbled Vinyl)|url=https://www.fatbeats.com/products/serj-tankian-elect-the-dead-2xlp-limited-us-exclusive-silver-black-marbled-vinyl|access-date=December 19, 2020|website=Fat Beats|language=en|archive-date=November 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107235010/https://www.fatbeats.com/products/serj-tankian-elect-the-dead-2xlp-limited-us-exclusive-silver-black-marbled-vinyl|url-status=dead}}</ref> He has continued releasing solo albums, recording them almost entirely by himself even after System of a Down had begun to reunite for tours.

In a November 2016 interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'', drummer John Dolmayan revealed that System of a Down was working on more than a dozen songs for their follow-up to the ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]]'' and ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]]'' albums. Although he stated that the band does not know when the album will be released, he added that, "I want everyone on board and feeling good about it. That's what we're trying to accomplish right now. There's a tremendous amount of pressure on us, though, because it's been 11 years—at least 12 by the time it comes out."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/serj-tankian-goes-symphonic-then-its-back-to-system-of-a-down-7567799|author=Kissel, Chris|title=Serj Tankian Goes Symphonic — Then It's Back to System of a Down|newspaper=[[LA Weekly]]|access-date=November 8, 2016}}</ref>

In a video Q&A session with fans on July 2, 2017, Shavo Odadjian was asked about the status of the next album and he responded, "I'm waiting for a new album too. It's not happening. I don't know. I don't know when it's gonna be. Not right now."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/07/system-of-a-down-bassist-shavo-odadjian-says-a-new-album-is-not-happening/|author=Geslani, Michelle|title=System of a Down bassist Shavo Odadjian says a new album is "not happening"|date=July 5, 2017|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=July 5, 2017}}</ref> In a December 2017 interview with [[Rolling Stone]], Serj Tankian said that System of a Down wrote some new material but was uncertain of what to do with it.

He went on to describe how he imagined the album sounding, "It's gotta be organic, it's gotta feel right in every way."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2018/08/01/incubus-brandon-boyd-and-system-of-a-downs-serj-tankian-open-up-on-fame-music-touring-and-more/#68be145b494f|title=Incubus' Brandon Boyd And System Of A Down's Serj Tankian Open Up On Fame, Music, Touring And More|author=Baltin, Steve|magazine=[[Forbes]]|access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref>

Odadjian said that the band has material written from "like the last 10, 12 years", but is uncertain on if it would form into a System of a Down album or not. He also said that Malakian and Tankian have visual differences on what the album should sound like, and that the band's inner tension had been building far longer than fans would be aware of despite having love and respect for one another nonetheless.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kroq.radio.com/media/audio-channel/tuesday-october-9th-guest-system-downs-shavo-odadjian|title=Tuesday, October 9th with guest: System of A Down's Shavo Odadjian|publisher=[[KROQ-FM]]|access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref> He would later say that there is no conflict between the members, expressing confidence that System of a Down would eventually record a new album and claimed that they have material written that would be their best to date.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/shavo-odadjian-system-of-a-down-interview-part-1/|author=Kaufman, Spencer|title=System of a Down's Shavo Odadjian: "We Have Material That Tops Everything We've Done"|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=December 19, 2018}}</ref> However, Tankian contradicts this statement by stating that there was no talk of the band recording a new album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/serj-tankian-talks-system-of-a-down-soundtracks-anthony-bourdain-770713/|author=Grow, Kory|title=Serj Tankian on Writing 'Requiem Music,' System of a Down's Creative Stalemate|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref>

Malakian explained that there is a mixture between the matter of different creative perspectives for the band's hesitation to record a new studio album and the lack of desire to tour; however he did not dismiss the possibility of an album being made, but that it would likely not happen anytime soon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kroq.radio.com/blogs/stryker-and-klein/daron-malakian-system-down-stryker-and-klein|title=Daron Malakian Talks System Of A Down with Stryker and Klein|author=Stryker and Klein|publisher=[[KROQ-FM]]|access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref> He feels that the fans don't care that the band isn't making an album, "but I think a lot of the fans just want an album." He expressed hopes that the members would get together and record new music but is content with the direction of his band Scars on Broadway, noting about the members' good friendship, "But at the same time, I don't see that happening anytime soon that we're all going to get together and make a new System of a Down album."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/04/daron-malakian-scars-on-broadway-system-of-a-down-interview-2019/|author=Kaufman, Spencer|title=Daron Malakian on Scars on Broadway, the State of System of a Down, and More|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref> Malakian said that Tankian and the rest of the band members have been unable to come to an agreement over how to go about making new music, but insists that there is no negativity between them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://omny.fm/shows/talk-is-jericho/system-of-a-daron-from-chop-suey-to-scars-on-broad|title=System Of A Daron - From Chop Suey to Scars On Broadway - Talk Is Jericho|website=omny.fm|access-date=May 9, 2019|archive-date=May 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515044157/https://omny.fm/shows/talk-is-jericho/system-of-a-daron-from-chop-suey-to-scars-on-broad|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Despite System of a Down's ability to perform live, Odadjian expressed disappointment at their inability to record new music, explaining that there has been new material written by the other members in the form of a possible new album. However, without Tankian's presence, no recordings had been made. He questioned why the band still hasn't made an album, citing creative differences as the problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/shavo-odadjian-on-possiblity-of-new-music-from-system-of-a-down-why-it-isnt-happening-is-a-big-question/|title=SHAVO ODADJIAN On The {{sic|Possi|blity|nolink=y}} Of New Music From SYSTEM OF A DOWN: 'Why It Isn't Happening Is A Big Question'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=August 13, 2019|access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref> With the lack of commitment to record new music, Tankian however, is in favor of releasing a collection of previously unreleased System of a Down songs from the band's past album sessions but would have to convince all the members in order to see its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/serj-tankian-says-he-is-all-for-system-of-a-down-putting-out-previously-unreleased-material/|title=SERJ TANKIAN Says He Is 'All For' SYSTEM OF A DOWN Putting Out Previously Unreleased Material|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=December 10, 2019|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref>

With the differences concerning the band members, Dolmayan became uncertain in wanting to make new music anymore. Although he did not want to put Tankian and Malakian at fault for the band's inability to record a new album, he said, "It takes four people to make this band, and it takes four people to unmake it. I think that we're all to blame. I could just blame Daron and Serj, because, quite frankly, they're the primary songwriters, so it's easy to blame them. But it's not just their fault.

=== Artsakh benefit singles and possible sixth studio album (2020–present) ===
On November 5, 2020, in response to the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war]], System of a Down released their first songs in 15 years, "[[Protect the Land]]" and "[[Genocidal Humanoidz]]", both of which "speak of a dire and serious war being perpetrated upon our cultural homelands of [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] and [[Armenia]]."<ref name="rollingstone2020" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=brownypaul|date=November 6, 2020|title=WOAHH Two New System Of A Down Songs Outta Nowhere|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2020/11/06/woahh-two-new-system-of-a-down-songs-outta-nowhere/|access-date=November 6, 2020|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref> "Protect the Land" also received a music video and marked the band's first single in 14 years, since "[[Lonely Day]]".

As for a possible new album, Dolmayan told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "If it was up to me, we'd have a new album every three years. But things aren't up to me. I'm at the mercy of my team, and although I fought for it for many years with band members, I've accepted that it is what it is. We do have five albums and [now] two songs. We've accomplished a lot in our careers. If it ends at that, so be it."<ref name="rollingstone2020" /> In the same interview, Malakian claimed that "Protect the Land" and "Genocidal Humanoidz" were originally going to be released under his own band [[Scars on Broadway]]. However, as the conflict came to fruition, the band had decided to come together and release the songs under System of a Down instead.<ref name="rollingstone2020" /> Malakian also said he does not see the band making new music anytime soon, saying that the singles were a "one-off kind of thing".<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 16, 2020|title=Daron Malakian Doesn't See SOAD Making More New Music Soon|url=https://loudwire.com/daron-malakian-doesnt-see-system-of-a-down-making-more-music-soon/|access-date=November 17, 2020|website=Loudwire}}</ref> [[Shavo Odadjian]] spoke with ''Wall of Sound'' in a follow up interview discussing the conception of the songs, stating, "It was amazing...
