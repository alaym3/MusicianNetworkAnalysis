==Early life==
Willson was born in [[Mason City, Iowa]],<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2002|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-937-0|pages=500/1}}</ref> to Rosalie Reiniger Willson and John David Willson.

He married his high-school sweetheart, Elizabeth "Peggy" Wilson, on August 29, 1920; they were married for 26 years.<!-- Should this be Willson, or was her maiden name Wilson? added on 11/14/10-her maiden name was Wilson per ref--><ref name=film>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/3/Meredith-Willson.html Meredith Willson Biography (1902–1984)] filmreference.com, accessed December 15, 2008</ref>

The young Willson became a [[flute]] and [[piccolo]] virtuoso, and was accomplished enough to become a member of [[John Philip Sousa]]'s band (1921–1924) (,<ref>The Springfield, Mo., Leader February 3, 1924, p.9, listed Willson as a solo flute performer for a Sousa Band concert at Springfield's Shrine Mosque in February 1924</ref> and later the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] under [[Arturo Toscanini]] (1924–1929). He then moved to [[San Francisco, California]], as the concert director for radio station [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC]], and then as a musical director for the [[NBC]] radio network in Hollywood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist/willson.html|title=Meredith Willson (1902-1984)|website=Sfmuseum.org|access-date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> His on-air radio debut came on KFRC in 1928 on ''[[Blue Monday Jamboree]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Music – As Written|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_UDAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Blue+Monday+Jamboree%22&pg=PA34|access-date=December 10, 2016|work=Billboard|date=April 17, 1948|page=34}}</ref>

Willson's work in films included composing the score for [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) ([[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Original Score), and arranging music for the score of [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' (1941) ([[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Music Score of a Dramatic Picture).

[[File:Meredith willson 1937edited.jpg|thumb|Willson in 1937]]
During [[World War II]], Willson worked for the United States' [[Armed Forces Radio Service]]. His work with the [[Armed Forces Radio Service|AFRS]] teamed him with [[George Burns]], [[Gracie Allen]], and [[Bill Goodwin]]. He worked with all three as the bandleader, and a regular character, on the [[Burns and Allen]] radio program. He played a shy man always trying to get advice on women. His character was ditzy as well, basically a male version of [[Gracie Allen]]'s character.

In 1942, Willson had his own program on [[NBC]]. ''Meredith Willson's Music'' was a summer replacement for ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=On The Air |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2148817/nelson_case_cap_activity/ |work= The Circleville Herald |date=June 19, 1942  |page=5 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=April 6, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> ''[[Sparkle Time]]'', which ran on [[CBS]] in 1946–47, was Willson's first full-season radio program.<ref name=mw>{{cite book |last1=Skipper |first1=John C. |title=Meredith Willson: The Unsinkable Music Man |date=2000 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=9781882810789 |pages=84–85 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SzB1CQAAQBAJ&q=%22Sparkle+Time%22+Willson&pg=PA84 |access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Oates |first1=Bill |title=Meredith Willson – America's Music Man: The Whole Broadway-Symphonic-Radio-Motion Picture Story |date=2005 |isbn=9781420835250 |page=85 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JOSxp0PNPG4C&q=%22Sparkle+Time%22+Willson&pg=PA85}}</ref>

Returning to network radio after WWII, Willson created the Talking People, a choral group that spoke in unison while delivering radio commercials. In 1950 he became the musical director for ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]'', a 90-minute comedy-variety program hosted by actress [[Tallulah Bankhead]] and featuring some of the world's best-known entertainers. Willson became part of one of the show's very few running gags, beginning replies to Bankhead's comments or questions with "well, sir, Miss Bankhead". He wrote the song "[[May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You]]" for the show. Bankhead spoke the lyrics over the music at the end of each show. He also worked on [[Jack Benny]]'s radio program, and hosted his own program in 1949. For a few years in the early 1950s, Willson was a regular panelist on the [[Goodson-Todman]] game show ''[[The Name's the Same]]''; he recalled in later life that he did the show for the steady Goodson-Todman salary, which he was saving toward his Broadway musical project.

In 1950, Willson served as musical director for ''The California Story'', the Golden State's centennial production at the Hollywood Bowl. Working on this production, Willson met writer [[Franklin Lacey]], who proved instrumental in developing the storyline for a musical Willson had been working on, soon to be known as ''The Music Man''. ''The California Story'' spectacular was followed by two more state centennial collaborations with stage director [[Vladimir Rosing]]: ''The Oregon Story'' in 1959 and ''The Kansas Story'' in 1961.

==Broadway==
Willson's most famous work, ''[[The Music Man]]'', premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1957, and was adapted twice for film (in [[The Music Man (1962 film)|1962]] and [[The Music Man (2003 film)|2003]]). He called it "an Iowan's attempt to pay tribute to his home state". It took Willson eight years and 30 revisions to complete the musical, for which he wrote more than 40 songs. The show was a resounding success, running on Broadway for 1,375 performances over three-and-a-half years. The cast recording won the first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album|Best Original Cast Album (Broadway or TV)]]. In 1959, Willson and his second wife Ralina "Rini" Zarova recorded an album, ''... and Then I Wrote The Music Man'', in which they review the history of, and sing songs from, the show.<ref>[http://castalbums.org/recordings/and-Then-I-Wrote-The-Music-Man-1959-Studio-Cast/1633 "...and Then I Wrote The Music Man"].

Willson's second musical, ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'', ran on Broadway for 532 performances from 1960 to 1962 and was made into [[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (film)|a 1964 motion picture]] starring [[Debbie Reynolds]]. His third Broadway musical was an adaptation of the film ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', called ''[[Here's Love]]''. Some theater buffs recall it as a quick failure, but it actually enjoyed an eight-month run on Broadway in 1963-64 (334 performances). His fourth, last, and least successful musical was ''[[1491 (musical)|1491]]'', which told the story of Columbus's attempts to finance his famous voyage. It was produced by the [[Los Angeles Civic Light Opera]] in 1969, but not on Broadway.<ref>Suskin, Steven.

==Other works==
===Classical music===
Willson's Symphony No. 1 in F minor: ''A Symphony of San Francisco'' and his Symphony No. 2 in E minor: ''Missions of California'' were recorded in 1999 by William T. Stromberg conducting the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra. Other symphonic works include the ''[[O.O. McIntyre|O.O. McIntyre Suite]]'', ''Symphonic Variations on an American Theme and Anthem'', the symphonic poem ''[[HMS Jervis Bay (F40)|Jervis Bay]]'', and ''Ask Not'', which incorporates quotations from [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inaugural address. In tribute to the [[Idyllwild Arts Academy|Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts (ISOMATA)]], Willson composed ''In Idyllwild'' for orchestra, choir, vocal solo and [[Alphorn]]. Willson's chamber music also includes ''A Suite for Flute''.

===Television specials===
In 1964, Willson produced three original summer variety specials for CBS under the title ''Texaco Star Parade''. The first special premiered on June 5, 1964, and starred Willson and his wife Rini. It featured guest stars [[Caterina Valente]] and [[Sergio Franchi]], and featured a production number with Willson leading four military bands composed of 500 California high school band members.<ref>"Television: Jun. 5, 1964." [[Time Magazine]], New York</ref> The second special starred [[Debbie Reynolds]] singing selections she had introduced in Willson's production ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]''<ref>"Debbie Guest on Parade." (June 8, 1964). ''[[Evening Independent]]'', [[St. Petersburg, FL]]</ref> Willson and Rini hosted the third special on July 28, and it featured a Willson production number with 1,000 Marine Corps volunteers from [[Camp Pendelton]]. Guest stars were [[Vikki Carr]], [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]], [[Frederick Hemke]], and [[Joe and Eddie]].<ref>"Star Parade, Beauty Show Will Be On." (July 26, 1964). ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'', [[Modesto, CA]]</ref>

===Popular songs===
Willson wrote a number of well-known songs, such as "You and I", which was a No. 1 for [[Glenn Miller]] in 1941 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. It was also recorded by [[Bing Crosby]], and by [[Tommy Dorsey]] with [[Frank Sinatra]] on vocals.

Three songs from ''The Music Man'' have become American standards: "[[Seventy-Six Trombones]]", "Gary, Indiana", and "[[Till There Was You]]", originally titled "Till I Met You" (1950).

Other popular songs composed by Willson include "[[It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas]]" (published as "It's Beginning to Look Like Christmas"), "[[May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You]]", and "[[I See the Moon]]". He wrote the [[University of Iowa]]'s [[fight song]], "[[Iowa Fight Song]]", as well as [[Iowa State University]]'s "For I for S Forever". He also wrote the fight song for his hometown high school "Mason City, Go!" He honored [[The Salvation Army]] with a musical tribute, "Banners and Bonnets".

An oddity in Willson's body of work is "[[Chicken Fat (song)|Chicken Fat]]", written in 1962. In school gymnasiums across the nation, this was the theme song for President John F. Kennedy's youth fitness program.<ref name=JFKPE>{{cite web| title= The Federal Government Takes on Physical Fitness | publisher= John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum | url= http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Physical-Fitness.aspx?p=2 | page=2 |access-date= June 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>Oates, p. 164</ref> It was time to get the country's youth into shape, and Willson's song had youngsters moving through basic exercises at a frenetic pace: push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, torso twists, running in place, pogo springs, and plenty of marching. With an energetic lead vocal by [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]],<ref name=JFKPE /> orchestral marching band, and full chorus, it was recorded during sessions for the ''Music Man'' film. Two versions of the song exist: a three-minute, radio-friendly length, and a longer, six-minute version for use in the gymnasium.<ref name=JFKPE /> In 2014, a re-recording of "Chicken Fat" was used in a television commercial for the [[iPhone 5S]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/06/13/chicken_fat_song_apple_iphone_5s_commercial_uses_kennedy_era_exercise_anthem.html|title=Chicken Fat song: Apple iPhone 5s commercial uses Kennedy-era exercise anthem|last=Yagoda|first=Ben|publisher=Slate.com|date=June 13, 2014|access-date=June 29, 2014}}</ref>

In 1974, Willson offered another marching song, "Whip Inflation Now", to the [[Ford Administration]], but it was not used.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gJoqTDzoIwC&q=wilson+whip+inflation+now+march&pg=PA167|title=Strictly Right: William F.

==Personal life==
[[File:Meredith Willson Star HWF.JPG|thumb|right|Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6411 Hollywood Boulevard]]
Willson was married three times. He was divorced by his first wife, Elizabeth, as reported in a news dispatch of March 5, 1947. They apparently had no contact after the divorce, and in his three memoirs Elizabeth is never mentioned, although he surprised her by sending her roses on August 20, 1970, which would have been their 50th wedding anniversary.<ref>Skipper, John C. ''Meredith Willson; the Unsinkable Music Man'' (El Dorado Hills, CA: Savas Publishing, 2000), pages 87 and 89. {{ISBN|1882810783}}.</ref>

Wilson married Ralina "Rini" Zarova, a Russian opera singer, on March 13, 1948. She died on December 6, 1966. Willson married Rosemary Sullivan in February 1968.<ref name=film/><ref>Oates, p. 170</ref><ref>Greasley, Philip A. (2001), ''Dictionary of Midwestern Literature'', p. 536, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-33609-0}}</ref> For years he lived in the [[Mandeville Canyon]] section of [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood, California]]; he was fondly remembered by friends and neighbors as a warm and gregarious host who loved nothing more than to play the piano and sing at parties. He often gave guests autographed copies of his record album, ''Meredith Willson Sings Songs from The Music Man''. In 1982, he and Rosemary appeared in the audience of ''The Lawrence Welk Show''.

Willson returned several times to his hometown for the North Iowa Band Festival,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nibandfest.com/ |title=North Iowa Band Festival|access-date=March 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817013151/http://www.nibandfest.com/ |archive-date=August 17, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> an annual event celebrating music with a special emphasis on marching bands. Mason City was the site of the 1962 premiere of the motion picture ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]'', hosted by Iowa Governor [[Norman Erbe]], which was timed to coincide with the festival. Willson, like his character Harold Hill, led the "Big Parade" through the town, and the event included special appearances by stars of the film, [[Shirley Jones]] and [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]]. The Master of Ceremonies, Mason City ''Globe-Gazette'' editor [[W. Earl Hall]], was a statewide radio personality and friend of many decades.

Willson was a member of the National Honorary Band Fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Psi]].

Willson died of heart failure in 1984 at the age of 82. His funeral in Mason City included mourners dressed in ''Music Man'' costumes and a barbershop quartet that sang "Lida Rose".<ref name=Traubner>Traubner, Richard.
