==Early life==
Khaury was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]], on April 12, 1932.<ref name="auto"/> His mother Tillie (née Staff), a Polish-Jewish garment worker, was the daughter of a [[rabbi]]. She had immigrated from [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]], present-day [[Belarus]], as a teen in 1914. Khaury's father, Butros Khaury, was a textile worker from [[Beirut]], present-day [[Lebanon]], whose father was a [[Maronites|Maronite]] Catholic priest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinytim.org/articles/parade.html |title=Tiny Tim on cover of Parade |publisher=Tinytim.org |access-date=September 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703044818/http://www.tinytim.org/articles/parade.html |archive-date=July 3, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2874700305/tiny-tim-herbert-butros.html |title=Tiny Tim (Herbert Butros Khaury) – The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=September 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Tiny Tim: Tiptoe Through a Lifetime|author1=Tarling, Lowell|author2=Sharp, Martin|year=2013|page=15|isbn=978-1484138564}}</ref>

Khaury displayed musical talent at a very young age. At the age of five, his father gave him a vintage wind-up [[Phonograph|Gramophone]] and a 78-RPM record of "Beautiful Ohio" by Henry Burr. He would sit for hours listening to the record. At the age of six, he began teaching himself [[guitar]]. By his pre-teen years, he developed a passion for records, specifically those from the 1900s through the 1930s. He began spending most of his free time at the [[New York Public Library]], reading about the history of the phonograph industry and its first recording artists. He researched sheet music, often making photographic copies to take home to learn, a hobby he continued for his entire life.<ref>{{cite book | last = Martell | first = Justin | title = Eternal Troubadour: The Improbable Life Of Tiny Tim | publisher = Jawbone Press | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781908279873}}</ref> He attended [[George Washington Educational Campus|George Washington High School]] in Washington Heights, Manhattan.

Khaury was a devout [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] Christian.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Devotional Life of Tiny Tim|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/devotional-life-tiny-tim-ted-willi|access-date=2021-12-01|website=www.linkedin.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Tiny Tim|url=https://www.nndb.com/people/405/000108081/|access-date=2021-12-01|website=www.nndb.com}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:John Wayne Tiny Tim Laugh In 1971.JPG|thumb|left|[[John Wayne]] and Tiny Tim help celebrate the 100th episode of ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In|Laugh-In]]'', 1971]]
By the time Khaury was 11 years old, he began learning to play the violin and enjoyed performing at home for his parents' entertainment. He later picked up the mandolin and the ukulele{{spaced ndash}}the latter of which became his signature instrument. During his recovery from having his appendix removed in 1945, he read the Bible and listened to music on the radio; after his recovery, he rarely left his room except to go to school, where he was described as a mediocre student. He dropped out of high school after continuously repeating his sophomore year, taking a series of menial jobs.<ref name=ehollywood>{{Cite episode |title=Tiny Tim |series=E! True Hollywood Story|series-link=E!_True_Hollywood_Story|network=E! |date=March 25, 2001 |season=5 |number=12}}</ref>

In a 1968 interview on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', he described the discovery of his ability to sing in an upper register: "I was listening to the radio and singing along; as I was singing I said 'Gee, it's strange. I can go up high as well.'" In a 1969 interview he said he was listening to [[Rudy Vallée]] sing in a falsetto, and "had something of a revelation{{spaced ndash}}I never knew that I had another top register," describing it as a religious experience.<ref name=ehollywood />
[[File:TinyTim.jpg|thumb|140px|Tiny Tim performing at an event in Tennessee in the late 1980s]]
By the early 1950s, Khaury had landed a job as a messenger at the New York office of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Studios, where he became ever more fascinated with the entertainment industry. He then entered a local talent show and sang "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" in his newly discovered falsetto. He started performing at dance club amateur nights under different names, such as Texarkana Tex, Judas K. Foxglove, Vernon Castle, and Emmett Swink. To stand out from the crowd of performers, he wore wild clothing and, after seeing an old poster of a long-haired [[Rudolph Valentino]], grew his own hair out to shoulder length and wore pasty white facial makeup. His mother did not understand Herbert's change in appearance and was intending to take her son, now in his twenties, to see a psychiatrist at [[NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue|Bellevue Hospital]] until his father stepped in.<ref name=ehollywood />

In 1959, he dropped all his other stage names and performed as "Larry Love, the Singing Canary" at Hubert's Museum and Live Flea Circus in New York City's [[Times Square]]. While performing there, he signed with a manager who sent him on auditions throughout the [[Greenwich Village]] section of New York, where he performed unpaid amateur gigs,<ref name=ehollywood /> playing the ukulele and singing in his falsetto voice the song which became his signature, "[[Tiptoe Through the Tulips]]".

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote:<ref name=ebert>{{cite web |website=Rogerebert.com |title=The Last Days of Tiny Tim|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/the-last-days-of-tiny-tim |access-date=January 17, 2017 |date=April 12, 2011}}</ref>
<blockquote>I first saw Tiny Tim very early in his career, in Greenwich Village in the winter of 1962–63. There was a convention of college newspaper editors, and a few of us{{spaced ndash}}I remember Jeff Greenfield coming along{{spaced ndash}}went to the Black Pussycat and found ourselves being entertained by a man the likes of whom we'd not seen before. He was already locally popular.</blockquote>

In 1963, he landed his first paying gig at Page 3, a gay and lesbian club in Greenwich Village, playing 6 hours a night and 6 nights a week for $96 per month. For the next two years, he performed as "Dary Dover", and after that, "Sir Timothy Timms". After being booked to follow a "midget" act, his manager, George King, billed the {{convert|6|ft|1|in|abbr=on}} Khaury using the ironic stage name "Tiny Tim", which would later become his signature name.<ref name=ehollywood /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Helen |title=Tiny Tim Dies Singing His Hit |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/tiny-tim-dies-singing-hit-article-1.737455 |access-date=December 25, 2015 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=December 2, 1996}}</ref>

Tiny Tim appeared in [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]]'s ''[[Normal Love]]'' (1963), as well as the independent feature film ''[[You Are What You Eat (film)|You Are What You Eat]]'' (1968) in which he sang the [[Ronettes]] song "[[Be My Baby]]" in his falsetto range; also featured was a rendition of [[Sonny and Cher]]'s "[[I Got You Babe]]", with Tim singing the [[Cher]] parts in his falsetto voice, along with [[Eleanor Barooshian]] singing [[Sonny Bono]]'s baritone part. These tracks were recorded with musicians who later joined [[The Band]]. The "I Got You Babe" performance led to a booking on the ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]'', a popular American television comedy-variety show. Co-host [[Dan Rowan]] announced that ''Laugh-In'' believed in showcasing new talent, and so Tiny Tim was introduced. The singer entered carrying a shopping bag, pulled his [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] soprano ukulele from it, and sang a medley of "[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]]" and "[[On the Good Ship Lollipop]]" as an apparently genuinely dumbfounded co-host [[Dick Martin (comedian)|Dick Martin]] watched.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_bljefIsBc|title=Video of Tiny Tim's debut on ''Laugh-In''|via=YouTube|access-date=September 28, 2012}}</ref> For his third number on ''Laugh-In'', Tiny Tim entered blowing kisses, preceded by an elaborate procession of the cast and, after a short interview, he sang "[[Tiptoe Through the Tulips]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Video of Tiny Tim's third appearance on ''Laugh-In'' (complete)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5MQbFAGHRE&NR=1|via=YouTube|access-date=September 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skU-jBFzXl0|title=Video of Tiny Tim's third appearance on ''Laugh-In'' (song only)|publisher=Youtube.com|access-date=September 28, 2012}}</ref>

In 1968, his first album ''[[God Bless Tiny Tim]]'' was released, which contained an orchestrated version of "Tiptoe Through the Tulips", which became a hit after being released as a single. ''For All My Little Friends'' (1969) was a collection of children's songs and was awarded a [[Grammy Award]] nomination.

On October 7, 1969, Tiny Tim had the opportunity to take to the ice with his favorite [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] pro sports team before a charity event at the hockey shrine [[Maple Leaf Gardens]]. Wearing the skates and jersey of future Hockey Hall of Fame member [[Pat Quinn (ice hockey)|Pat Quinn]] and helped by team members Mike Walton and Jim McKenny, he made an attempt to skate for the very first time. He was quoted as saying, "What a thrill! Just being on the ice was great!" Reacting well to his evidenced inability to skate on his own, he said, "I was always athletic spiritually, not physically".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Kevin|title=Leafs at 100: Tiny Tim tiptoed through Toronto fandom|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2017/03/04/leafs-at-100-tiny-tim-tiptoed-through-toronto-fandom.html|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]}}</ref>

Tiny Tim was married three times, and had one daughter from his first marriage to the then 17-year-old Victoria Budinger{{spaced ndash}}also known as "Miss Vicki"{{spaced ndash}}at the age of 37.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/02/arts/tiny-tim-singer-dies-at-64-flirted-chastely-with-fame.html|title=Tiny Tim, Singer, Dies at 64; Flirted, Chastely, With Fame|first=William|last=Grimes|date=December 2, 1996|website=Nytimes.com|access-date=February 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731080405/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/02/arts/tiny-tim-singer-dies-at-64-flirted-chastely-with-fame.html|archive-date=July 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Tiny Tim married Miss Vicki on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on December 17, 1969, with 40 million people watching. In 1971, Budinger gave birth to their daughter Tulip Victoria. Tiny Tim and Victoria Budinger divorced three years later. Budinger subsequently had several marriages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/thou-shalt-not-kill-vol-58-no-24/|title=Thou Shalt Not Kill|date=2002-12-09|website=People.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1995-01-29-9501290266-story.html|title='MISS VICKI' TIPTOES INTO NEW AGE BOUTIQUE|last=Inquirer|first=Philadelphia|website=OrlandoSentinel.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref>

When Tiny Tim first became well known to the American public, many people erroneously believed that he was British. Many pundits and journalists debated whether the character being presented was just an orchestrated act or the real thing. "It quickly became clear that he was genuine", however, and that he could probably be best described as "a lonely outcast intoxicated by fame" and "a romantic" always in pursuit of his ideal dream.<ref name="bio" />

After his career highlights in the late 1960s, Tiny Tim's television appearances dwindled, and his popularity began to wane. He continued to play concerts, making several lucrative appearances in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. In August 1970, he performed “[[There'll Always Be an England]]” to an estimated 600,000 people at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970]]. The UK press announced that he had stolen the show "without a single electric instrument".<ref>{{cite news |title=How Tiny Tim blew my mind: The story of an obsession |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/23lXVV4B9rfL2WgFKfLJ6gy/how-tiny-tim-blew-my-mind-the-story-of-an-obsession |access-date=January 6, 2020 |agency=BBC Arts}}</ref> When his recording contract ended with [[Reprise Records|Reprise]], he founded his own record label and humorously named it Vic Tim Records, as a pun on the combination of his wife's name with that of his own. He performed with the American alternative rock band [[Camper Van Beethoven]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://berkeleyplace.wordpress.com/2008/01/04/tiny-tim-with-camper-van-beethoven/ |title=Tiny Tim With Camper Van Beethoven " Berkeley Place |publisher=Berkeleyplace.wordpress.com |date=January 4, 2008 |access-date=September 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106142801/http://berkeleyplace.wordpress.com/2008/01/04/tiny-tim-with-camper-van-beethoven/ |archive-date=January 6, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> He played the lead role in the 1987 horror film ''[[Blood Harvest (film)|Blood Harvest]]'', acting the role of Mervo. In the 1990s, he released several albums, including ''Rock'' (1993), ''I Love Me'' (1993), and ''Girl'' (1996).

''Tiny Tim'', a biography by [[Harry Stein (author)|Harry Stein]], was published in 1976 by Playboy Press. Khaury also appeared in the [[WWE]] on July 19, 1993, in a skit with [[Jerry Lawler]] on "King's Court".{{cn|date=November 2021}}

=== Instruments ===
Tiny Tim played the ukulele left-handed{{spaced ndash}}though he retained the standard string placement{{spaced ndash}}and played the guitar right-handed. The instruments he played included a vintage [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]], a [[Favilla Guitars|Favilla]], and a Johnston metal [[Resonator ukulele|resonator]]. Tiny was a huge fan of [[Arthur Godfrey]] and taught himself to play using a method book that came with the Godfrey-endorsed Maccaferri Islander plastic ukulele.<ref name="Ukulele Heroes: The Golden Age">{{cite book

==Death==
[[Image:Tiny Tim Lakewood2.JPG|thumb|Tiny Tim's tomb at Lakewood Mausoleum]]
On September 28, 1996, Tiny suffered a heart attack just as he began singing at a ukulele festival at the Montague Grange Hall in [[Montague, Massachusetts]] (this hall is often confused in accounts of the incident with the nearby [[Bookmill|Montague Bookmill]], at which he had recorded a video interview earlier that same day). He was hospitalized at the nearby Franklin County Medical Center in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]] for approximately three weeks before being discharged with strong admonitions not to perform again because of his health, weight, and dietary needs for his diabetic and heart conditions. He ignored the advice.

On November 30, 1996, he was playing at a gala benefit hosted by the Women's Club of Minneapolis. He had let his third wife ("Miss Sue") know before the show that he was not feeling well, but did not want to disappoint the fans. Before the start of his performance, most of the audience had left. While performing his last number of the evening, he suffered another heart attack on stage in the middle of a rendition of his hit, "Tiptoe Through the Tulips". His wife asked him if he was feeling all right, and he said he was not; she was helping him back to their table when he collapsed, and never regained consciousness.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tiny Tim Dies After Singing "Tulip" Song|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/528062/TINY-TIM-DIES-AFTER-SINGING-TULIP-SONG.html|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Deseret News|date=December 2, 1996}}</ref> [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s performed on-site [[CPR]] and transported him to [[Hennepin County Medical Center]], where after repeated revival attempts, he was pronounced dead at 11:20 pm.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiny Tim is Signing Off: The Tragic Tale of an Artist's Final, Fatal Performance: Twenty years ago, the 'Eternal Troubadour' collapsed on stage|url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/tiny-tim-is-signing-off-the-tragic-tale-of-an-artists-final-fatal-performance-50d6f223b42b#.pzcqrhk7m|author=Martell, Justin A.|publisher=medium.com|date=November 30, 2016}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite news |author=William Grimes |title=Tiny Tim, Singer, Dies at 64; Flirted, Chastely, With Fame |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/02/arts/tiny-tim-singer-dies-at-64-flirted-chastely-with-fame.html |quote=Tiny Tim, whose quavery falsetto and ukulele made ''Tiptoe Through the Tulips With Me'' a novelty hit in 1968, died on Saturday night at the [[Hennepin County Medical Center]] in Minneapolis.

==Posthumous releases==
In 2000, the [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Handmade]] label released the posthumous ''[[Tiny Tim Live at the Royal Albert Hall]]''. This recording had been made in 1968 at the height of Tiny Tim's fame, but Reprise Records never released it. The limited-number CD sold out and was reissued on Rhino's regular label. In 2009, the [[Collectors' Choice Music|Collector's Choice]] label released ''I've Never Seen a Straight Banana: Rare Moments Vol. 1'', produced and recorded by [[Richard Barone]] in 1976. The album was a collection of rare recordings of some of Tiny Tim's favorite songs from 1878 through the 1930s, along with some of his own compositions.

In 2009, it was reported that Justin Martell was preparing a biography of Tiny Tim,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyswarm.com/headlines/richard-barone-keeps-his-promise-tiny-tim/ |title=Richard Barone Keeps His Promise to Tiny Tim |publisher=The Daily Swarm |date=August 13, 2009 |access-date=September 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718074439/http://www.thedailyswarm.com/headlines/richard-barone-keeps-his-promise-tiny-tim/ |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> released in 2016 under the title ''Eternal Troubadour: The Improbable Life of Tiny Tim''.
