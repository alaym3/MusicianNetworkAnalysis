==History==

===Origins===

Andrew Butler was born and raised in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], and has described growing up in "a violent household without any role models".<ref name="Observer2011"/> He developed an early love for [[Greek mythology]], which later inspired him to name his band after the mythological hero of [[Hercules]].<ref name="Observer2011"/><ref>{{cite web |author=Cam Lindsay |title=Hercules and Love Affair's Disco Fever |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=123&csid2=4&fid1=32044 |website=Exclaim! |date=June 22, 2008 |access-date=January 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104203555/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/hercules_love_affair |archive-date=January 4, 2016 }}</ref> Interested in music, he played the piano, and began composing classical pieces from the age of thirteen.<ref name="Observer2011"/> Butler's interest switched to focus on dance music after buying a record by the band [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]].<ref name="Observer2011"/> He went on to give his first DJ set aged fifteen, in a Denver [[Leather subculture|leather bar]] run by a hostess called Chocolate Thunder Pussy; on that occasion, the club was [[police raid|raided by police]], leading him to hide from them in the toilets.<ref name="Observer2011"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/07/electronicmusic.popandrock |author=Alexis Petridis |title= ''Hercules and Love Affair'' record review |website=The Guardian |date=March 7, 2008 |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017080329/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/07/electronicmusic.popandrock |archive-date=October 17, 2015}}</ref> As he later related: "I started DJing because I needed to get out of the house. I was, like, 'Take me to the club or there's going to be a really ugly situation at home today!' I found a lot of freedom in the nightclub to express myself and not be judged as harshly as I was at home. I am a gay man and I grew up with a certain struggle and because of that, I have a story to tell."<ref name="Observer2011"/>

In the late 1990s, Butler moved to [[New York City]] to attend [[Sarah Lawrence College]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/4342/Hercules_And_Love_Affair-interview.html |author=Eddy Lawrence |title=Hercules And Love Affair: Interview |website=Time Out London |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001944/http://www.timeout.com/london/music/hercules-and-love-affair-interview |archive-date=December 31, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="NYT08">{{cite web |title=Party Titans, Updating Disco's Sound |author=Hua Hsu |date=June 22, 2008 |website=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/arts/music/22hsu.html?pagewanted=all |access-date=January 4, 2016}}</ref> In the city he befriended the musician [[Anohni]]—then working under her birth name of Antony Hegarty—and in 2004 convinced her to perform vocals for a song he had written, titled "[[Blind (Hercules and Love Affair song)|Blind]]".

===2007–2011: Foundation and debut album===
{{quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote='Blind' was about growing up a gay kid, my immediate family and social group rejecting me, and asking why I was born into this situation. But knowing that as soon as I could escape, I would, and that I would find freedom and solace. As an adult, however, I found a life full of excess and other wounded people and confusion. Thus, I felt blind.|source= —Butler, 2008<ref name="NYT08"/> }}

In 2007, after Anohni had won the [[Mercury Prize]] for her work with [[Antony and the Johnsons]], Butler approached her with the "Blind" demo, and they agreed to release it.<ref name="NYT08"/> Butler decided to do so under the name of Hercules and Love Affair because it reflected his interest in Greco-Roman mythology; it referenced Hercules and his "love affair" with [[Hylas]]. According to Butler, "[Hercules] stayed on the island, looking for his boyfriend. I just thought this was super-beautiful: the strongest man on earth looking for his lost love, at his most vulnerable. Strong men can have strong feelings. And they can experience those feelings and experience pain and express pain — and be gay."<ref name="NYT08"/> [[DFA Records]] agreed to release the song, with DFA founder [[Tim Goldsworthy]] stating that "We had slight reservations that 'Blind' would be a one-hit wonder. But then he played us some bits he had been playing around with at home."<ref name="NYT08"/> The single was first released in the United Kingdom in March 2007, where it made the Top 40.<ref name="NYT08"/> It was awarded Best Song of 2008 by Pitchfork Media and came in at sixth place in [[Resident Advisor]]'s Top 30 tracks of that year, while ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called it the second best song of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?999|date=December 22, 2008|title=RA Poll: Top 30 tracks of 2008|website=[[Resident Advisor]]|access-date=January 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name="VillageVoice"/>

At this point, Butler decided to establish Hercules and Love Affair as a continuing musical project, stating his intent to release music with a rotating cast of performers and musicians.<ref name="VillageVoice">{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/interview-hercules-and-love-affairs-andy-butler-on-his-sidetracked-mix-and-hercules-new-record-6652509 |author=Max Willens |date=June 30, 2009 |title=Hercules and Love Affair's Andy Butler on His Sidetracked Mix and Hercules' New Record |website=Village Voice |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104212011/http://www.villagevoice.com/music/interview-hercules-and-love-affairs-andy-butler-on-his-sidetracked-mix-and-hercules-new-record-6652509 |archive-date=January 4, 2016}}</ref> The band's [[Hercules and Love Affair (album)|self-titled debut album]]  was released in Europe through DFA's parent company, [[EMI]], in March 2008.<ref name="NYT08"/> For the album, Butler assembled a mixed line-up; Morgan Wiley and Andrew Raposo, both formerly of Automato, joined the backing band, while [[Nomi Ruiz]], [[CocoRosie]], [[Kim Ann Foxman]], and Anohni took up vocals.<ref name="NYT08"/> However, although Anohni would appear on five of the album's tracks, she did not participate in the band's live performances.<ref name="NYT08"/> The band made its live debut on May 17, 2008, at the Studio B venue in [[Brooklyn]], New York, before going on a European and North American tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2008/05/hercules_love_a_2.html |title=Hercules & Love Affair @ Studio B, NYC (pics) & Tour Dates |website=Brooklyn Vegan |date=May 9, 2008 |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911161115/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2008/05/hercules_love_a_2.html |archive-date=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Appearing at London's [[Lovebox Festival]] in 2010, it was there that they were interviewed by ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/video/voguetv/player.aspx/exclusives/video,9693/ |title=A Fashion And Music Lovebox – Exclusives – Vogue TV |access-date=2010-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725202206/http://www.vogue.co.uk/video/voguetv/player.aspx/exclusives/video,9693 |archive-date=2010-07-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After touring for a year, Butler split with his record company and returned to Denver.<ref name="Observer2011"/>

===2011–2014: ''Blue Songs'' and ''The Feast of the Broken Heart''===

2011 saw the release of Hercules and Love Affair's second album, ''[[Blue Songs (album)|Blue Songs]]'', brought out by independent British label [[Moshi Moshi Records|Moshi Moshi]].<ref name="Observer2011"/> Butler remained in control, joined by [[Mark Pistel]], and Kim Ann Foxman returned, however it also featured two new main vocalists, Shaun Wright and Aerea Negrot.<ref name="Observer2011"/><ref name="GuardianJan2011"/> One of the songs, "Step Up", contained guest vocals from [[Kele Okereke]], the lead singer of [[indie rock]] band [[Bloc Party]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kele Okereke features on new Hercules And Love Affair album |url=http://www.nme.com/news/hercules-and-love-affair/53385#D570hgdGbgkcSKjF.99 |date=October 12, 2010 |website=NME |author=Adam Bychawski |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407183840/http://www.nme.com/news/hercules-and-love-affair/53385 |archive-date=April 7, 2015 }}</ref> The album's title was chosen by Butler to reflect his own "blue period" during adolescence, before he discovered the existence of like-minded people through music.<ref name="GuardianJan2011">{{cite web |title=Hercules and Love Affair – Blue Songs: Exclusive album stream |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/jan/24/hercules-love-affair-blue-songs |website=The Guardian |date=January 24, 2011 |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013084300/http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/jan/24/hercules-love-affair-blue-songs |archive-date=October 13, 2015}}</ref>

Shortly after the album's release, Butler attracted the attention of the music press when he informed ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine that [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] should "make an age-appropriate record that still appeals to young people" while being scathing of [[Lady Gaga]], asserting that she was producing "children's music... It's middle-aged gay men dancing around to music for 11-year-old girls."<ref>{{cite web |title=Hercules And Love Affair advise Madonna to make 'age-appropriate' album |url=http://www.nme.com/news/hercules-and-love-affair/58695#DIPaLkBioMAWrLOA.99 |date=August 17, 2011 |website=NME |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103102255/http://www.nme.com/news/hercules-and-love-affair/58695 |archive-date=November 3, 2012}}</ref> As a result of the stress and pressure of the band's success, Butler began making increased use of drugs, and in an attempt to get clean he moved from New York City to [[Vienna]] in Austria. As he told a journalist from ''[[The Guardian]]'': "It was a need, because I was going way too fast and I was going to self-destruct. It had to get really bad before it got OK."<ref name="Guardian Interview">{{cite web |title=Hercules And Love Affair's Andy Butler and John Grant: making music mined in the soul |author=David Whitehouse |date=May 24, 2014 |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/24/andy-butler-john-grant |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903153633/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/24/andy-butler-john-grant |archive-date=September 3, 2014}}</ref>

In August 2012, Hercules and Love Affair played at the [[Meltdown Festival]] at London's [[Southbank Centre]], which was curated by Anohni. For their performance of "Blind", she joined them onstage to provide the vocals; the first time that she had performed the song live with the band.<ref>{{cite web |title=Antony's Meltdown – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/12/antony-meltdown-review-festival-2012#start-of-comments |publisher=The Guardian |author=Kitty Empire |date=12 August 2012 |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610135334/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/12/antony-meltdown-review-festival-2012 |archive-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> At that performance, they were also joined onstage by singer [[John Grant (musician)|John Grant]], who publicly stated for the first time that he was [[HIV|HIV positive]]; Butler later stated that "I thought it was one of the bravest things I've ever seen a person do".<ref name="Guardian Interview"/>

I didn't want polite, I wanted aggressive".<ref name="NME4 March"/> In a conscious change from the previous two albums, he did not make use of organic instrumentation.<ref name="NYT interview"/> When recording the first songs for the album, Butler had stated his intention not to use any well-known vocalists for the album, because he believed that – as with Anohni and Okereke – they would be too busy to tour with the band.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hercules And Love Affair: 'I don't want stars like Antony Hegarty and Kele Okereke on next record' |url=http://www.nme.com/news/hercules-and-love-affair/59026#eDOlL43Eyjg6FRYy.99 |date=September 4, 2011 |website=NME |access-date=January 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103102530/http://www.nme.com/news/hercules-and-love-affair/59026 |archive-date=November 3, 2012 }}</ref> However, when the album was released, it received guest vocals from Grant, who sang on "Liberty" and "I Try To Talk To You", in which he dealt with the issue of being HIV positive.<ref name="Guardian Interview"/><ref name="NME4 March"/> Also singing on the album were Rouge Mary, Gustaph, and Krystle Warren,<ref name="NME4 March"/><ref name="NYT interview"/> with Butler informing ''[[The New York Times]]'' that that line-up constituted "the best ensemble of vocalists I've had."<ref name="NYT interview"/>

In July 2014, the band performed at East London's [[Lovebox Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lovebox festival review – scorching temperatures, dodgy sound |author=Tshepo Mokoena |date=20 July 2014 |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/20/lovebox-festival-review-mia-nas-chase-status |access-date=January 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723114131/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/20/lovebox-festival-review-mia-nas-chase-status |archive-date=July 23, 2014 }}</ref> In August, the band generated some controversy with the release of the video for their song "My Offence" which featured excerpts of conversation with figures from the New York City gay scene like [[Miss Honey Dijon|Honey Dijon]] and [[Juliana Huxtable]]. Butler described the song and its video as an examination of his "relationship to taboo words and the use of 'cunt' amongst NYC's gay community to relay flattery, empowerment and strength".<ref>{{cite web |title=Andy Butler Of Hercules And Love Affair Discusses 'My Offence' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/16/hercules-and-love-affair_n_5679099.html |author=Noah Michelson |date=August 16, 2014 |website=The Huffington Post |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402174903/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/16/hercules-and-love-affair_n_5679099.html |archive-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref> In December 2014, Hercules and Love Affair performed in Thailand at [[Wonderfruit]] festival.<ref name="13 Aug 2014">{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Webb|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=25952|title=Wonderfruit Festival launches in Thailand with Seth Troxler|date=August 13, 2014|website=Resident Advisor|access-date=July 5, 2017}}</ref>

Describing the band's 2011 lineup, Elizabeth Day of ''[[The Observer]]'' described Hercules and Love Affair as "possibly the most disparate bunch ever to come together, call themselves a band and release an album.
