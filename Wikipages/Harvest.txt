'''Harvesting''' is the process of gathering a ripe crop from the [[field (agriculture)|field]]s. '''Reaping''' is the cutting of [[grain]] or [[pulse (legume)|pulse]] for harvest, typically using a [[scythe]], [[sickle]], or [[reaper]].<ref>{{cite book |title=American Heritage Dictionary |edition=4th |year=2000 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-08230-1}}</ref> On smaller [[farm]]s with minimal [[mechanization]], harvesting is the most [[manual labour|labor]]-intensive activity of the growing season. On large mechanized farms, harvesting uses the most expensive and sophisticated [[farm machinery]], such as the [[combine harvester]]. Process automation has increased the efficiency of both the seeding and harvesting processes. Specialized harvesting equipment utilizing [[conveyor belt]]s to mimic gentle gripping and mass-transport replaces the manual task of removing each [[seedling]] by hand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.beltcorp.com/seedling-harvesting-belts|title=Belts For Seedling Harvesting - Belt Corporation of America|date=2017-04-18|work=Belt Corporation of America|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824010112/https://www.beltcorp.com/seedling-harvesting-belts|archive-date=2017-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> The term "harvesting" in general usage may include immediate [[postharvest]] handling, including cleaning, sorting, packing, and cooling.

The completion of harvesting marks the end of the growing season, or the growing cycle for a particular crop, and the social importance of this event makes it the focus of [[season]]al celebrations such as [[harvest festival]]s, found in many [[religion]]s.

==Etymology==
"[[wikt:harvest#Noun|Harvest]]", a noun, came from the [[Old English]] word {{lang|ang|hærf-est}} (coined before the Angles moved from [[Angeln]] to Great Britain)<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XEYjMYf-AFUC&pg=PA207 Proceedings of the Philological Society], vol. 5, p. 207.</ref> meaning "[[autumn]]" (the season), "harvest-time", or "August". (It continues to mean "autumn" in British dialect, and "season of gathering crops" generally.) "The harvest" came to also mean the activity of reaping, gathering, and storing grain and other grown products during the autumn, and also the grain and other grown products themselves. "Harvest" was also [[verbification|verbified]]: "To [[wikt:harvest#Verb|harvest]]" means to reap, gather, and store the harvest (or the crop). People who harvest and equipment that harvests are harvesters; while they do it, they are harvesting.

==Crop failure==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Crop failure (also known as harvest failure) is an absent or greatly diminished [[crop yield]] relative to expectation, caused by the plants being damaged, killed, or destroyed, or affected in some way that they fail to form edible fruit, seeds, or leaves in their expected abundance.

Crop failures can be caused by catastrophic events such as [[plant disease]] outbreaks (such as the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine in Ireland]]), heavy rainfall, [[volcanic eruption]]s, [[storm]]s, [[flood]]s, or [[drought]], or by slow, cumulative effects of [[soil degradation]], too-high [[soil salinity]], [[erosion]], [[desertification]], usually as results of [[drainage]], [[overdrafting]] (for [[irrigation]]), [[overfertilization]], or [[overexploitation]].

In history, crop failures and subsequent [[famine]]s have triggered [[human migration]], [[rural exodus]], etc.

The proliferation of [[industrial farming|industrial]] [[monoculture]]s, with their reduction in [[crop diversity]] and dependence on heavy use of [[artificial fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, has led to overexploited soils that are nearly incapable of [[regeneration (ecology)|regeneration]]. Over years, [[unsustainable]] farming of land degrades [[soil fertility]] and diminishes [[crop yield]]. With a steadily-increasing [[world population]] and local [[overpopulation]], even slightly diminishing yields are already the equivalent to a partial harvest failure.  Fertilizers obviate the need for [[soil regeneration]] in the first place, and [[international trade]] prevents local crop failures from developing into famines.

==Other uses==
''Harvesting'' commonly refers to [[cereal|grain]] and produce, but also has other uses: [[fishing]] and [[logging]] are also referred to as harvesting. The term harvest is also used in reference to [[harvest (wine)|harvesting grapes]] for [[wine]]. Within the context of [[irrigation]], ''water harvesting'' refers to the collection and run-off of rainwater for agricultural or domestic uses. Instead of ''harvest'', the term ''exploit'' is also used, as in exploiting fisheries or water resources. ''[[Energy harvesting]]'' is the process of capturing and storing [[energy]] (such as [[solar power]], thermal energy, [[wind energy]], salinity gradients, and [[kinetic energy]]) that would otherwise go unexploited. ''Body harvesting'', or ''[[cadaver]] harvesting'', is the process of collecting and preparing cadavers for [[anatomy|anatomical]] study. In a similar sense, ''[[organ harvesting]]'' is the removal of tissues or organs from a donor for purposes of transplanting.

In a non-agricultural sense, the word "harvesting" is an economic principle which is known as an exit event or [[liquidity event]]. For example, if a person or business was to cash out of an ownership position in a company or eliminate their investment in a product, it is known as a harvest strategy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harvest-strategy.asp|title=Harvest Strategy|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2011-01-09|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Canada===

''Harvesting'' or ''Domestic Harvesting'' in Canada refers to hunting, fishing, and plant gathering by [[First Nations]], [[Métis in Canada|Métis]], and [[Inuit]] in discussions of [[Indigenous land claims in Canada|aboriginal or treaty rights]]. For example, in the [[Gwich'in]] [[Comprehensive Land Claim]] Agreement, "Harvesting means gathering, hunting, trapping or fishing{{Nbsp}}...".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gwich'in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement |url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/pr/agr/gwich/gwic/index_e.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20071115152303/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/pr/agr/gwich/gwic/index_e.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-11-15 |publisher=Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada website }}</ref> Similarly, in the [[Tłı̨chǫ|Tlicho]] Land Claim and Self Government Agreement, {{" '}}Harvesting' means, in relation to wildlife, hunting, trapping or fishing and, in relation to plants or trees, gathering or cutting."<ref>{{cite web |title=Tlicho Agreemen |url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1292948193972 |publisher=Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada website |access-date=2012-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714091947/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1292948193972 |archive-date=2012-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
