'''Morbid Angel''' is an American [[death metal]] band based in [[Tampa, Florida]] formed in 1983 by guitarist, primary composer and sole remaining original member Trey Azagthoth, vocalist and bassist Dallas Ward, and drummer [[Mike Browning]]. Widely considered one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its [[thrash metal]] roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo [[blast beat]]s, multiple tempo changes and a dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of "the most influential and emulated bands in death metal", alongside [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]], [[Autopsy (band)|Autopsy]] and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], and have been cited as an influence by many later bands.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwJJR5vvlIsC&q=morbid+angel&pg=PA18|title=Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture|last=Purcell|first=Natalie J.|date=May 5, 2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786484065|language=en}}</ref> They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song "God of Emptiness" shown on an episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-10-22/20-years-of-morbid-angel-s-covenant|title=20 Years Of Morbid Angel's Covenant|date=October 22, 2014|newspaper=TeamRock|language=en-GB|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1388181/covenant-turns-20/franchises/the-anniversary/|title=Covenant Turns 20|date=June 20, 2013|newspaper=Stereogum|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Their first three albums – ''[[Altars of Madness]]'' (1989), ''[[Blessed Are the Sick]]'' (1991), and ''[[Covenant (Morbid Angel album)|Covenant]]'' (1993) – are considered classics in the genre.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/morbid-angel-domination-reissued-on-limited-edition-digipak-cd-with-free-poster/|title=MORBID ANGEL: 'Domination' Reissued On Limited-Edition Digipak CD With Free Poster|date=August 22, 2011|newspaper=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref>

British music magazine ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' ranked ''Altars of Madness'' first in its list "Top 40 greatest death metal albums". ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]'' magazine also rated guitarist Trey Azagthoth as the number one "death metal guitarist ever".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2007/06/26/decibel-magazine-names-the-top-20-death-metal-guitarists-of-all-time/|title=Decibel Magazine Names the Top 20 Death Metal Guitarists of All Time|date=June 26, 2007|publisher=MetalSucks|access-date=February 27, 2012}}</ref> The band's songs are complex in arrangement, owing to the considerable technical skills of both Azagthoth as well as drummer [[Pete Sandoval]], the latter of whom also played in the [[grindcore]] band [[Terrorizer]]. According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], Morbid Angel is the third best-selling death metal band in the United States (after [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] up until 2003 with sales of over 445,000),<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=16769|title=Morbid Angel is the Third Best Selling Death Metal Band (Hitting this mark with only 8 Albums)|date=January 12, 2003|work=Blabbermouth|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031202023121/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=16769|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 2, 2003}}</ref> with their third album ''Covenant'' being the best-selling death metal album during the beginning of the Soundscan era time with over 150,000 units sold.<ref name="metalsucks.net">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/10/24/25-best-metal-bands-time-16-morbid-angel/|title=The 25 Best Metal Bands of All Time, #16: Morbid Angel|date=October 24, 2014|website=MetalSucks|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref>

The band's original lyrical themes, when helmed by Vincent (and Azagthoth and Browning respectively) focused mostly on [[Satanism]], [[occultism]] and [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] subject matter, but from ''[[Formulas Fatal to the Flesh]]'' onward, via Azagthoth's influence, the lyrics moved toward the ancient [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian gods]]. Much of this is a nod to the [[Simon Necronomicon]], which was influenced by Sumerian mythology, the author [[H. P. Lovecraft]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/popcult/music.asp |title=HPLA – Lovecraftian Music |publisher=Hplovecraft.com |access-date=August 20, 2011}}</ref> and fascination with the [[Roman Empire]], and during Steve Tucker's tenure they take on more [[anti-religion|anti-religious]] and barbaric themes, namely of the strong overcoming the weak.  Their albums are notable for being released in alphabetical order, with guitarist Trey Azagthoth commenting that it was a coincidence regarding the first two albums, but that it has been done consciously since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/MorbidAngel-Sept2003.htm |title=Morbid Angel Interview |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date=September 23, 2003 |access-date=August 20, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation, demos, and ''Altars of Madness'' (1983–1990)===
Morbid Angel was formed in 1983 in Tampa, Florida by guitarist Trey Azagthoth and drummer/vocalist [[Mike Browning]]. In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for "gruesome stage antics".<ref name=":1" /> They quickly became highly influential in the formation of the [[Florida death metal]] scene, inspiring other highly influential acts such as [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]].<ref name=":05">{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Arielle|date=October 22, 2009|title=The way the music died: The earliest days of Tampa Death Metal|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/music/the-way-the-music-died-the-earliest-days-of-tampa-death-metal/1046088|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027025354/https://www.tampabay.com/features/music/the-way-the-music-died-the-earliest-days-of-tampa-death-metal/1046088/|archive-date=October 23, 2009|website=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> They recorded their debut album, ''[[Abominations of Desolation]]'', in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow [[Terrorizer (band)|Terrorizer]] member, drummer [[Pete Sandoval]], soon followed. The band made their debut in 1987 on the [[New Renaissance Records]] record label.

Their first studio album, ''[[Altars of Madness]]'', was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.terrorizer.com/news/features-2/the-terrorizer-friday-death-metal-top-15/|title=The Terrorizer Friday Death Metal Top 15 - Terrorizer|date=August 24, 2012|newspaper=Terrorizer|language=en-GB|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/morbid-angel-altars-of-madness-best-debut-metal-albums/|title=No. 4: Morbid Angel, 'Altars of Madness' – Best Debut Metal Albums|website=Loudwire|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treblezine.com/10-essential-death-metal-albums/|title=10 Essential Death Metal Albums|website=Treblezine.com|date=May 21, 2013|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that:<blockquote>Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-'80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel's ''Altars of Madness'' did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s [[Death (metal band)|Death]], never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Slayer]] redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children's music compared to the Florida-based group's assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/altars-of-madness-mw0000311214|title=Altars of Madness - Morbid Angel {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref></blockquote>

Morbid Angel toured for nearly two years in support of ''Altars of Madness''. The tour started in November 1989 when they opened for [[Napalm Death]] and [[Bolt Thrower]] in the UK and Europe. Most of 1990 and 1991 were spent touring North America, playing with bands such as [[Pantera]], [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]], [[Death Angel]], [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]], [[Sanctuary (band)|Sanctuary]], [[Ripping Corpse]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Sacrifice (band)|Sacrifice]] and [[Wrath (band)|Wrath]]. The ''Altars of Madness'' tour ended in April 1991 with a Brazilian tour, supported by [[Sarcófago]], Sextrash and Cambio Negro.<ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web|title=Morbid Angel|url=http://metallipromo.com/morbid.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pantera|url=http://metallipromo.com/pantera.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref>

===Rise to success (1991–1995)===
In 1991, Morbid Angel released their second album, ''[[Blessed Are the Sick]]'', which was met with widespread critical acclaim, and is considered by many to be a landmark release in the death metal genre.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/morbid-angel-mn0000928351/biography|title=Morbid Angel {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> The album differed from its predecessor, showcasing a more "sludgy" side to the band. Morbid Angel toured worldwide in support of ''Blessed Are the Sick'' throughout 1991 and 1992, headlining a European tour with [[Sadus]], [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], [[Godflesh]] and [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]], a North American tour (also supported by Unleashed) and then a European tour with [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and Unleashed. They also were one of the opening acts (along with [[Kreator]], [[Sepultura]], Headhunter and [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]]) for [[Motörhead]] on the "Christmas Metal Meetings '91" tour, and toured Australia for the first time.<ref name="metallipromo" />

Following the success of ''[[Altars of Madness]]'' and ''Blessed Are the Sick'', Morbid Angel were signed by [[Irving Azoff]] to [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] for one album, with the option of five more.<ref name=":02" /> In late 1992, second guitarist Richard Brunelle was kicked out of the band due to alleged substance abuse; instead of replacing him, Morbid Angel moved on as a three-piece.<ref name=":3" />

On June 22, 1993, the band released their third full-length album ''[[Covenant (Morbid Angel album)|Covenant]]'', which went on to sell over 150,000 copies in the United States alone. Their record label dedicated promotional resources to the album, and commissioned music videos for the songs "Rapture" and "God of Emptiness". These music videos were put on heavy rotation by MTV, and the latter also appeared on the television show ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head|Beavis and Butt-head]]''. The success of the album enabled the band to tour with [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Motörhead]] across the United States from February through March 1994, which David Vincent credits with helping the band significantly expand their audience.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-04/news/va-29884_1_recent-black-sabbath|title=Hard Rock of Ages : Metal heroes Black Sabbath are still going strong after more than two decades and drawing a new generation of euphoric, stage-diving fans.|last=APPLEFORD|first=STEVE|date=March 4, 1994|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Morbid Angel also toured North America with [[Kreator]] and [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], and Europe with [[Grave (band)|Grave]] and [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]].<ref name="metallipromo" />

The band released its fourth studio album, ''[[Domination (Morbid Angel album)|Domination]]'', on May 9, 1995, which featured new guitarist [[Erik Rutan]] of [[Ripping Corpse]]. It proved to be a somewhat controversial album among fans, featuring a slower, more atmospheric and experimental sound than on previous albums.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/2016/9/6/justify-your-shitty-taste-morbid-angels-domination|title=Justify Your Shitty Taste: Morbid Angel's 'Domination'|newspaper=Decibel Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> AllMusic describes the album's sound as "more groove-oriented".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/domination-mw0000171906|title=Domination - Morbid Angel {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> The album has gone on to sell over 100,000 copies in the United States alone. Regardless, following the release of the album, their record label dropped them from their roster.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1388181/covenant-turns-20/franchises/the-anniversary/|title=Covenant Turns 20|date=June 20, 2013|newspaper=Stereogum|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref>

===Steve Tucker era (1996–2003)===
In 1996, shortly after the release of their live album titled ''Entangled in Chaos'', bassist/vocalist [[David Vincent (musician)|David Vincent]] departed the band and was replaced by Steve Tucker. They released their fifth full-length album ''[[Formulas Fatal to the Flesh]]'' in 1998, which was considered more aggressive and complex than their previous album ''Domination''.<ref name=":1" /> With Tucker, the band went on to release ''[[Gateways to Annihilation]]'' and ''[[Heretic (Morbid Angel album)|Heretic]]'' in 2000 and 2003 respectively. Tucker briefly left Morbid Angel in 2001 and was replaced by former [[Hate Eternal]] bassist and vocalist [[Jared Anderson (heavy metal musician)|Jared Anderson]]. That year, the band joined [[Pantera]], [[Skrape]], [[Slayer]] and [[Static-X]] on the Extreme Steel Tour of North America, which was Pantera's last major tour.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80204/pantera-sets-extreme-steel-lineup</ref><ref>https://www.mtv.com/news/1444695/pantera-slayer-deliver-lesson-in-brutality-at-extreme-steel-kickoff/</ref>

In 2002, Anderson left the band and Tucker re-assumed his position as bassist and vocalist.<ref name=":4" />

===Reunion with David Vincent (2004–2014)===
[[File:Morbid Angel 01 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Morbid Angel in 2008]]
In 2004, Steve Tucker once again left the band, paving the way for former vocalist/bassist David Vincent to return. The band continued by touring and playing festivals such as [[Wacken Open Air]] in 2006.

Morbid Angel's appearance on some of the mid-summer 2008 European festivals was announced as a "short break from writing and pre-production of their new 8th studio album".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.morbidangel.com/lavareport1.html |title=NEWS / LavaReport |publisher=MorbidAngel.com |access-date=August 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827092939/http://www.morbidangel.com/lavareport1.html |archive-date=August 27, 2011 }}</ref> In May 2008, it was announced that [[Destructhor]] from [[Zyklon]] would be the band's new guitarist,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=36732 |title=Morbid Angel Announces New Guitarist – in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=August 20, 2011}}</ref> and Destructhor would appear on the new album.

== Musical style ==
Morbid Angel's style of music has undergone a number of changes throughout their musical career. The band's sound is characterised by harsh, growled vocals, technically complex guitarwork that frequently makes use of fast [[Tremolo picking|tremolo-picking]] and [[Palm mute|palm-muted]] riffs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarmasterclass.net/ls/Morbid-Angel-Style/|title=Morbid Angel Style Lesson|website=Guitarmasterclass.net|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> Azagthoth's guitarwork is a core part of the band's sound, with his atonal "shredding" style being likened to the guitar work in [[Slayer]].<ref name="Treble's Top 100 Guitarists"/> Pete Sandoval's work behind the drums has also been crucial to the band's sound, and "is known for his great double bass drum speed and technical proficiency" and as one of the fastest drummers in metal.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://sickdrummermagazine.com/~sickmagg/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/40-pete-sandoval|title=Sick Drummer Magazine {{!}} Pete Sandoval|last=Administrator|website=sickdrummermagazine.com|language=en-gb|access-date=January 27, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202041511/http://sickdrummermagazine.com/~sickmagg/index.php/the-drummers/hall-of-fame/40-pete-sandoval|archive-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref> In addition, "Sandoval is also among the first extreme metal drummers to champion the use of acoustic drum triggers."<ref name=":5" /> On their early albums, they pushed metal to its most extreme level, musically and lyrically.<ref name=":4" /> The band has evolved their anti-Christian lyrical themes from these early works. On ''Altars of Madness'', the lyrics largely consist of simple blasphemous and overtly Satanic proclamations.<ref name=":1" /> However, the sophistication and depth of the lyrics has grown over time. On their 1993 album ''Covenant'', the band articulate more broadly anti-theistic lyrics, and profess "anger at a higher power". Today, "the band's lyrics are even more philosophical and thought-provoking. Current lyricist Trey Azagthoth has diagramed his personal ideology in the album ''Formulas Fatal to the Flesh''. His stance is blasphemous and non-traditional, but hardly evil."<ref name=":1" />
