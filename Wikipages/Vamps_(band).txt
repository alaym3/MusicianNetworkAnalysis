'''Vamps''' is a Japanese [[rock music|rock]] duo formed in 2008 by [[Hyde (musician)|Hyde]] (vocalist, rhythm guitarist, lyricist and composer) and [[K.A.Z]] (lead guitarist, backing vocalist and composer). Only a year after their founding, Vamps performed its first international tour, ten dates in the United States, and in 2010 they went on their first world tour. Originally signed to Hyde's own record label Vamprose, every release the band has had to date has reached the top ten on the [[Oricon]] music chart. In 2013, the group changed labels to [[Universal Music Group]]'s [[Delicious Deli Records]] and produced their worldwide debut release. After several tours and collaborations with Western acts, Vamps worked with outside producers and songwriters for the first time on the 2017 album ''[[Underworld (Vamps album)|Underworld]]'' before temporarily ceasing all activities at the end of that year.

== History ==

===2008–2011===
Vamps was formed by [[Hyde (musician)|Hyde]] ([[L'Arc-en-Ciel]]) and [[K.A.Z]] ([[Oblivion Dust]]) in 2008. They had been working together on Hyde's solo work since 2003. After years of collaboration, the two finally decided to form their own band and agreed that there was no better way to announce Vamps than getting out in front of the fans right away. Their first material was the single "[[Love Addict (Vamps song)|Love Addict]]", released on July 2, 2008.

Their first nationwide tour, Vamps Live 2008, kicked off at [[Zepp]] Tokyo. The band, having only released one single, played mostly songs from Hyde's solo career. Between August 1 and October 28, they played 46 shows at the Zepp live houses throughout Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicjapanplus.jp/news/1/720/hydes-new-project-starts/|title=HYDE's New Project Starts!! |publisher=Musicjapanplus|date=2008-04-07|access-date=2014-04-09}}</ref> The band played 6 to 10 shows at each venue and every single show was sold out. Vamps' second single "[[I Gotta Kick Start Now]]" was released on March 13, 2009, and was followed by "[[Evanescent (song)|Evanescent]]" on May 13.
