Aside from music, Krayzie Bone has since then ventured into the business world. He was a founding member of [[Mo Thugs Family]], a collective of [[Cleveland]]-based rap and Hip-Hop musical acts. He broke apart from the group in 1999 to form ThugLine Records, or TL. He had administrated the label to fellow Bone Thugs member [[Wish Bone]] as its president and co-CEO. The group has presently reunited and continue to tour as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/2013/06/30/the-ahh-qa-krayzie-bone/|title=AllHipHop » The AHH Q&A: Krayzie Bone|work=AllHipHop|date=30 June 2013}}</ref> In many videos he can be spotted wearing a chain that says TL. In 2010 the name ThugLine Records was changed to The Life Entertainment. In order to reach out to more artists and identify the best talent for the label, Conquer The Industry was developed as an internet channel to help up and coming music artists break into the music industry. As a part of his entrepreneurial drive, Krayzie Bone launched a clothing and accessory line named "TL Apparel"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelife.bigcartel.com/|title=The Life|work=bigcartel.com}}</ref> which is a direct tie to his music. Many of his fans support his clothing line as they joined him in the grand opening of the store in Los Angeles. 
In 2018 Krayzie Bone signed a deal to distribute his digital media company,”Krayzie Bone Media” with The Digital Soapbox Network.
His first show “Quick Fix”-The Afterhours was his first project with the network. In 2019 he started the conspiracy podcast #TruthTalks which has garnered a large online following.
