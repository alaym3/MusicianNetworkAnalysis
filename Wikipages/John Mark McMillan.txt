'''John Mark McMillan'''<ref name=GEN>{{cite web|last=McLean-Bridges|first=Gretchen Annette|url=http://wamclean.tripod.com/pafg11.htm|title=Descendants of William Alex McLean and Sue Elizabeth Gudger: Sixth Generation|work=The William Alexander & Sue Gudger McLean Family|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref> (born November 27, 1979) is an American singer, songwriter and musician.

==Career==
In 2002, he released his debut album ''Hope Anthology, Volume 1''. In 2005 he released ''The Song Inside: The Sounds of Breaking Down'', which included the track "[[How He Loves]]". The song was successful despite the album's independent release, and has been covered by several well-known artists within the Christian music industry including the [[David Crowder Band]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=John Mark|title=How He Loves, David Crowder, and Sloppy Wet Kisses…|url=http://johnmarkmcmillan.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/how-he-loves-david-crowder-and-sloppy-wet-kisses/|website=John Mark McMillan|accessdate=July 20, 2014|date=September 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Songs|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2009-12-19/christian-songs|website=Billboard|accessdate=July 20, 2014|date=December 19, 2009}}</ref> The song has sentimental meaning for McMillan, who wrote it following the death of a dear friend who, during a church staff meeting, prayed out loud "If it would shake the youth of a nation, I will give my life today." McMillan was awakened in the middle of the same night by a phone call; the friend had been killed in a car crash.<ref>{{cite web|last=McMillan|first=John Mark|title=How He Loves: A Song Story|url=https://vimeo.com/10868953|work=Vimeo|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The song took more than a year to surface in the Christian mainstream, but has gone on to become a commonly played worship song on Christian radio and throughout church organizations.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

He was briefly associated with [[Integrity Music]] and released ''The Medicine'' and re-released ''The Song Inside: The Sounds of Breaking Down'' through them.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
