[[File:Sonny Moore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sonny Moore in 2008]]
In 2004, Moore contacted [[Matt Good]] of [[From First to Last]] about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, [[Epitaph Records]] released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, ''[[Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count]]''.
