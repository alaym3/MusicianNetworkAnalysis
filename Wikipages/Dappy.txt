}}</ref> ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Κωνσταντίνος Κοντόσταυλος; born 11 June 1987), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Dappy''', is a British rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. He is the [[lead singer]] of the [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]]-based [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Grime music|grime]] trio [[N-Dubz]], with his cousin [[Tulisa Contostavlos|Tulisa]] and [[Fazer (rapper)|Fazer]]. He was known for his slightly unusual dress sense and his love for what he describes as "eye-catching headwear". His trademark was wearing a selection of woolly [[chullo]]s (sometimes referred to as "Dappy hats"), turning up one or both of the ear-flaps of the hat.

==Music career==
===2000–2011: N-Dubz era===
{{main|N-Dubz}}

Dappy appeared on the television show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' on 29 November 2007, on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team, and wore a trademark "Dappy hat", also giving one to [[Simon Amstell]] to wear as part of the gag. Despite vowing he would not return to the show he appeared for a second time on the guest team on 4 December 2008 and for a third time, on Phill's team, which was broadcast on 18 November 2009. He is known to be a good friend of [[Chris Moyles]] and also gets on well with [[Kwasi Danquah III|Tinchy Stryder]] after releasing a single together, called "[[Number 1 (Tinchy Stryder song)|Number 1]]". Dappy has made cameo appearances on K.I.G's "Head, Shoulders, Kneez and Toez" music video, Gracious K's "Migraine Skank" music video, and [[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]]'s "[[Chip Diddy Chip]]" music video, as one of Chipmunk's school friends.

===2011–2014: Solo projects and ''Bad Intentions''===
It was announced on 17 June 2011 that N-Dubz had left their American record deal, amid rumours that the band had split.<ref>Darvill, Josh (Friday, 17 June 2011).

''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''.</ref> As such, during the band's hiatus period, all three members decided to embark upon solo careers. Before the band's split, Dappy signed a contract with [[Takeover Entertainment|Takeover Entertainment Ltd]] that confirmed that if the band ever split or went on hiatus, he would continue as a solo artist. His first taste of solo stardom came as a guest artist on label-mate [[Kwasi Danquah III|Tinchy Stryder]]'s single "Spaceship", which was released in June 2011. While deciding upon his debut solo single, Dappy was contacted by Def Jam, asking him what he would like done with the demos of a track N-Dubz had recorded whilst under the label, which remained unreleased. Dappy decided to re-record the track, "[[No Regrets (Dappy song)|No Regrets]]", and release it as his debut solo effort. Featuring a cameo appearance from band-mate Fazer, "No Regrets" took the charts by storm, peaking at #1 in the UK and Scotland, and at #8 in Ireland.

Following the success of "No Regrets", Dappy claimed during an interview that: "With my solo stuff, I really want to earn the respect of an older audience. I don't think there's any shame in trying to write music that will be recognised by people I admire. Bono. I have big goals. I want to have two #1 singles back-to-back as a solo artist."<ref>[http://www.pressparty.com/pg/newsdesk/dappy/view/29120/ N-Dubz star Dappy has ‘big goals’ for his solo career] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322184412/http://www.pressparty.com/pg/newsdesk/dappy/view/29120/ |date=22 March 2012 }}. pressparty.com. Thursday, 21 July 2011.</ref> Dappy soon succeeded, gaining praise from Queen guitarist [[Brian May]], who was "impressed" with "No Regrets". As a result, Dappy invited May for a guest stint on his second single, which coincidentally was titled "[[Rockstar (Dappy song)|Rockstar]]". "Rockstar" was released on 26 February 2012. On 29 February, Dappy revealed that the title of his album would be ''[[Bad Intentions (album)|Bad Intentions]]'', claiming that the album "is motivational music for people who believe they can't do nothing, a battle we have with our own mind."<ref name="digitalspy.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a368456/dappy-wants-rihanna-adele-for-next-single-dare-to-dream.html |title=Dappy wants Rihanna, Adele for next single 'Dare To Dream' - Music News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=29 February 2012 |access-date=1 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303143451/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a368456/dappy-wants-rihanna-adele-for-next-single-dare-to-dream.html |archive-date=3 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The album's third single was "[[Come with Me (Dappy song)|Come with Me]]". Subsequently, he revealed that the fourth single will be "[[Good Intentions (Dappy song)|Good Intentions]]", and if "Rockstar" peaks at #1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], he will enlist Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] and British superstar [[Adele]], who will both have vocal sections on the single. He claimed that Rihanna contacted him after she was impressed with a demo tape she had heard of his music.<ref name="digitalspy.co.uk"/> Dappy confirmed in September 2011, before the release of "Rockstar" and "[[Bad Intentions (album)|Bad Intentions]]", that the album's final single will be a collaboration with [[The Wanted]], which will be released towards the end of 2012.<ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2011/09/12/n-dubz-to-split-and-dappy-to-work-with-rihanna-115875-23414098/ N-Dubz to split and Dappy to work with Rihanna] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918092729/http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2011/09/12/n-dubz-to-split-and-dappy-to-work-with-rihanna-115875-23414098/ |date=18 September 2011 }}.

===2015–present: ''Eros Apollo'' and singles===
Dappy's single "Beautiful Me" was released on 29 March 2015 and reached number 19 in the UK. He followed this up with the promotional release "100 (Built for This)" in July, and the full single "Money Can't Buy" in September 2015. All three songs were set to be included on his second [[All Around the World Productions|All Around the World]] album ''Miracles'' in November 2015, but the album did not eventuate and Dappy has since left [[All Around the World Productions|All Around the World]] and released his first independent EP, ''Eros Apollo'', on Christmas Day 2015.

In 2016, Dappy released the singles "Hip Hip Hooray" and "Kiss" and a Freestyle called "Messi" these songs again were released via an independent label/management partnership called LEX Music Corp

On 31 July 2017, Dappy released the single Straight Facts" Again this was part of a new management deal with PlayDirty manager Vash who currently manages [[Krept and Konan]] .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/straight-facts-single/id1265134614|title=Straight Facts - Single by Dappy on Apple Music|website=iTunes|access-date=31 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127094148/https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/straight-facts-single/id1265134614|archive-date=27 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The music video was released the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM5qY9l5ixM|title=Dappy - Straight Facts (Official Video)|last=TheDappyVEVO|date=30 July 2017|publisher=YouTube|access-date=31 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809040332/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM5qY9l5ixM|archive-date=9 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 12 October 2017, Dappy released his second single under the PlayDirty management called "Spotlight" this song charted at 56 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

In 2018, he released his single "[[Oh My (Dappy song)|Oh My]]" featuring fellow British rapper Ay Em. It peaked at 23 in the charts. He followed this up with the song "All We Know" which peaked at 64 and released an acoustic onto YouTube called "Count on Me".

In 2019, Dappy collaborated with Tory Lanez releasing 'Not Today<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2019/6/dappy-and-tory-lanez-pace-around-in-the-plug-records-not-today-vido|title=Dappy and Tory Lanez Pace Around in The Plug Records' "Not Today" Video|website=HYPEBEAST|access-date=2019-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190628173834/https://hypebeast.com/2019/6/dappy-and-tory-lanez-pace-around-in-the-plug-records-not-today-vido|archive-date=28 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>'.

==Criticism and controversy==
In mid 2007, Dappy released "Love for My Slum" with fellow UK rap artist Baker Trouble, which was number one on Channel U (then Channel AKA, now [[Now 70s]]) for several weeks and was a big hit in the underground urban scene. However, it didn't do as well with the media and was heavily criticized for a scene in which Dappy is standing outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a "rich kid" who is trying to look like a gangster. ''The Independent'' wrote, "His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement ... Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?".<ref>{{cite news

Dappy was convicted of battery in 2007. In December 2008, Dappy pleaded guilty to two accounts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, [[Essex]] after reportedly spitting in a woman’s face while drunk on a night out. Dappy pleaded guilty to the offences and for each count received four weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, to run concurrently and 100 hours community service. He was also ordered to pay £50 compensation to the woman and her friend and £300 costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/15/dappy-avoids-jail-over-brawl|title=Dappy avoids jail over petrol station brawl|first=Press|last=Association|date=15 February 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820074855/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/15/dappy-avoids-jail-over-brawl|archive-date=20 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 12 January 2010, Contostavlos appeared on ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]] with Fazer and Tulisa. The show received a text message from a woman in Boston, Lincolnshire, complaining that Dappy was "vile" and "a little boy with a silly hat" and that N-Dubz were "losers". Dappy secretly copied her phone number from the studio console and, the following day, tried calling her and sent threatening messages including: "Your {{sic}} gonna die. U sent a very bad msg towards Ndubz on The Chris Moyels {{sic}} show yesterday Morning and for that reason u will never be left alone!!! u say sorry I will leave u alone u ****." The woman claimed that she continued to receive messages after declining to apologise, one of which said: "u dum f*********head u can call me names over the radio but when I call u direct u chicken out u punk!nana f******niii, Dappy".<ref name="2010 Guardian">{{cite news|last=Swash|first=Rosie|title=N-Dubz's Dappy sent death threats to BBC Radio 1 listener|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/15/ndubz-dappy-death-threats|work=The Guardian|access-date=1 September 2011|date=15 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118104716/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jan/15/ndubz-dappy-death-threats|archive-date=18 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref group="nb">''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that asterisks were presumably added by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', who originally reported the story.</ref> Dappy's management later apologised on his behalf and offered free tickets to one of his concerts, but he has not apologised to the woman personally.<ref>{{cite news

Born and raised in [[Camden Town]], North [[London]], Contostavlos grew up with his [[Greeks|Greek]] parents, Byron Contostavlos and Zoi Agorou and older brother Spiros. Byron died on 12 April 2007. His father was from [[Cyprus]], and his mother is from [[Sparta, Laconia|Sparta]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dappy receives huge backlash after trying to defend use of the N-word|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/dappy-from-n-dubz-faces-backlash-after-defending-use-of-n-word-a6789441.html|access-date=11 April 2018|work=The Independent|date=29 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412012718/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/dappy-from-n-dubz-faces-backlash-after-defending-use-of-n-word-a6789441.html|archive-date=12 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dappy and best friend Fazer started making beats together and coming up with lyrics, later asking Dappy's cousin, [[Tulisa Contostavlos|Tulisa]] (who was reluctant at first), to join the band and started to perform in and around Camden Town from the age of thirteen. At the time they were called the Lickle Rinsers Crew and went under the management of Dappy's father Byron, to whom Dappy was the "inspiration behind the band". Byron worked at a local barbers shop, putting all the money he had into equipment and resources for the band at their studio. However, Byron died on 12 April 2007 after a heart attack and [[N-Dubz]] wrote the song "[[Papa Can You Hear Me?|Papa (Can You Hear Me?)]]", which was played at his funeral and became the group's second biggest hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Dappy had the words "RIP Dad" tattooed on his neck and does not like to say his dad's name, instead referring to him as "B" or "Uncle B", which was also the name of N-Dubz's [[Uncle B|debut album]]. Before Byron died, he said he would like their album to be called ''Against All Odds'' but, after his death, the group called their debut album ''[[Uncle B]]'' in tribute, with their second album being called ''[[Against All Odds (N-Dubz album)|Against All Odds]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

He revealed that he is a "massive" [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] fan when N-Dubz appeared on ''[[Live from Studio Five]]'', gushing "it is an honour to sit next to you" to former Arsenal striker [[Ian Wright]] who was one of three hosts on the show.<ref>{{cite web
