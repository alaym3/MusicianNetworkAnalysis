'''The Romantics''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1977 in [[Detroit]]. The band often put under the banner of [[power pop]] and [[New wave music|new wave]]. They were influenced by 1950s American [[rock and roll]], Detroit's [[MC5]], [[the Stooges]], early [[Bob Seger]], [[Motown]] R&B, 1960s North American [[garage rock]] as well as the [[British Invasion]] rockers.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/3/romantics-lead-singer-wally-palmar-what-i-about-yo/|title=The Romantics: 'Made in Detroit'|last=Valcourt|first=Keith|date=3 August 2016|website=The Washington Times|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>

The Romantics achieved substantial popularity in the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, Canada, and Australia, with their two best-charting songs "[[What I Like About You (The Romantics song)|What I Like About You]]", peaking at #49 in the US and #2 in Australia, and "[[Talking in Your Sleep (The Romantics song)|Talking in Your Sleep]]", reaching #3 in the US, #1 in Canada, and #14 in Australia. The two songs have since become mainstays on [[1980s in music|'80s]], [[classic rock]], [[Album-oriented rock|AOR]], and [[active rock]] radio stations.
Their debut album, released on January 4, 1980, in the UK, has the distinction of being the first record to be released of that decade.

==Career==

===''The Romantics'' and ''National Breakout'' (1977–1982)===
The Romantics' original lineup consisted of vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and [[Harmonica|harmonicist]] Wally Palmar, lead guitarist and vocalist Mike Skill, bassist and backing vocalist Rich Cole, and drummer and vocalist Jimmy Marinos. All four band members made songwriting contributions to the group, but Palmar and Skill were considered the band's primary tunesmiths. The band's first show was on [[Valentine's Day]] at My Fair Lady Club, in Detroit, opening for the New MC5 in 1977. For three years the band was on the road, playing in [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] venues like [[Boston]]'s [[The Rathskeller|Rathskeller]], [[CBGB]] in [[New York City|New York]]'s Bowery, [[Manhattan]]'s Max's Kansas City, and [[Cleveland]]'s Agora.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/test-of-time/Content?oid=2176986|title=Test of time|last=Smith|first=Brian|date=10 September 2003|website=Detroit Metro Times|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> They were subsequently signed to Nat Weiss' [[Nemperor Records|Nemperor]] record label after a show at [[Hurrah (nightclub)|Hurrahs]], and in September 1979, the band recorded their debut self-titled album with British producer [[Pete Solley]].<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dmme.net/interviews/solley.html|title=Interview with Peter Solley|date=December 2004|website=DME|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> The group's true record debut was the 1978 single on Spider Records, "Little White Lies" (b/w "I Can't Tell You Anything"), followed that year by the [[Bomp! Records|Bomp!]] single "Tell It to Carrie" (b/w "First in Line"). All of these were re-recorded later for the first LP.<ref name=":2" />

|description2=Excerpt}}
The album sold roughly 200,000 copies<ref name=":2" /> and yielded the hit "[[What I Like About You (The Romantics song)|What I Like About You]]", which reached #49 in the US,<ref name=":3" /> #8 in the [[Netherlands]],<ref name=":4" /> and #2 in [[Australia]], where the band was especially popular. As all four members were singers, the straightforward beat of "What I Like About You" lent the opportunity for drummer Jimmy Marinos to take the vocals.<ref name=":1" />

Mike Skill left the band after the release of its second album, ''[[National Breakout]]'', in 1980. He was replaced by lead guitarist Coz Canler. This lineup of the band recorded the album ''[[Strictly Personal (The Romantics album)|Strictly Personal]]'' in 1981 with producer [[Mike Stone (record producer)|Mike Stone]], who had produced for [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name=":2" /> Due to frustrations with the songwriting featured on the record, Rich Cole was replaced by a returning Skill, who took over as the band's bassist.<ref name=":2" />

===Commercial success (1983–1986)===
With Skill back in, the band began playing arenas with [[Cheap Trick]], the [[The Kinks|Kinks]], and the [[The Cars|Cars]]. Solley was also rehired in 1983 as their producer for their fourth album ''[[In Heat (The Romantics album)|In Heat]].''<ref name=":2" /> ''In Heat'' would be The Romantics' greatest commercial success, and was awarded a gold album in the United States for selling over 500,000 copies.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=romantics#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – October 21, 2014|work=riaa.com|access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref> It eventually would sell over 900,000 US copies.<ref name=":2" /> ''In Heat'' was also awarded a gold album in Canada (for over 50,000 copies sold).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum/certification/gold-albums/page/460/|title=Gold Album(S) Archives – Page 460 of 578|work=Music Canada|access-date=21 October 2014}}</ref> The first single taken from ''In Heat'', "[[Talking in Your Sleep (The Romantics song)|Talking in Your Sleep]]", hit #3 for four weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart<ref name=":3" /> and reached #1 on the [[Album Rock Tracks]]<ref name=":5" /> and  [[Hot Dance Club Play]] charts.<ref name=":6" />

It was also a global success, scoring in many other countries such as #1 in [[Canada]]<ref name=":7" /> and #5 in [[Sweden]].<ref name=":8" /> A second single, "One In A Million", peaked at #37 during the following year on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart<ref name=":3" /> and also went to #21 on the Hot Dance Club Play Chart.<ref name=":6" /> The Romantics' music videos were frequently shown on the cable television network [[MTV]] during this period, solidifying the band's popularity. Also during 1983, the Romantics played US and international concert tours in support of ''In Heat'', and appeared on such pop music-themed television shows as ''[[Solid Gold (television series)|Solid Gold]]'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', and ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref name=":2" />

In 1984, drummer Jimmy Marinos left the Romantics, and he was replaced by David Petratos, who would serve as the band's drummer until 1990.<ref name=":2" /> This lineup released one album, 1985's ''[[Rhythm Romance]]'', which peaked at #72<ref name=":3" /> and only produced one charting single ("Test of Time" #71).<ref name=":9" /> Detroit keyboardist Barry Warner was also added to the band for the following 1985–1986 tour. Due to the tour for ''Rhythm Romance'' being thwarted by low ticket sales and mounting tension between the band and its management, The Romantics were dropped from the Sony record label.<ref name=":2" />

===1990–present===
In the late 1980s, the Romantics discovered that their managers had been misappropriating the profits earned by the band from its records and live performances. Additionally, one of their releases (the aforementioned "What I Like About You") had been licensed for use in television commercials without the band's knowledge or approval. Consequently, the Romantics filed a lawsuit against their management in 1987, and the legalities involved prevented the band from recording new music until the mid-1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1998-03-11-9803110022-story.html|title=Romantics Learn Hard Lesson in Royalties|last=Carlozo|first=Lou|date=11 March 1998|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>

Former [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] drummer [[Clem Burke]] replaced David Petratos as the Romantics' drummer in 1990. For much of the 1990s, the Romantics played obscure performances in small venues, largely forgotten and out of the public spotlight.

The Romantics' fortunes began to rise again in the middle of the 1990s, as the band's success in its lawsuit against its former management freed the band to record again (and ensured that future earnings from the licensing of Romantics songs would go to the band). The first fruit of the band's new recording activity was the 1993 UK-only EP ''Made In Detroit''.<ref name=":2" /> Several Romantics greatest hits packages were issued during the 1990s, as was the live album ''The King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents: The Romantics Live In Concert'', a 1996 release of an October 1983 recording of a Romantics concert in [[San Antonio, Texas]] at the height of the band's popularity.

Jimmy Marinos, the Romantics' original drummer, temporarily returned to the band for a series of performances in 1996–1997 (with Clem Burke returning to the Romantics' drumstool after Marinos departed again). In 2003, twenty years after the release of their most commercially successful album, ''In Heat'', the Romantics released ''[[61/49]]''–a more roots rock and [[blues]]-oriented record than the band's previous efforts. Although Clem Burke performed as the band's primary drummer on the release, original drummer Jimmy Marinos is featured on half of the tracks. The album was not a great commercial success.

A fourth drummer, Brad Elvis, (formerly from [[The Elvis Brothers]], and currently The Handcuffs) replaced Clem Burke as the Romantics' regular drummer in 2004 after Burke returned full-time to a reactivated Blondie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/article/8296/Brad-Elvis-Interview|title=Brad Elvis – Interview|last=Torem|first=Lisa|date=15 May 2016|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> The Romantics continue to play live concerts today.{{when|date=January 2021}}

Rich Cole returned to the band after a long absence in 2010. Longtime lead guitarist Coz Canler left the band in 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2013/7/24/the-romantics-settle-royalties-lawsuit-with-former-member-1.html|title=The Romantics Settle Royalties Lawsuit with Former Member|date=24 July 2013|website=abc News Radio|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> allowing Skill to return to the original lead guitarist role he held in the band.

In 2004, the band's album ''61/49'' was named most Outstanding National Small/Independent Label Album at the [[Detroit Music Awards]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=65796|title=2004 Detroit Music Awards Winners|website=Music Industry News Network|access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref> and in June 2011, the Romantics were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/189-romantics|title=Best Albums of 2008 - Michigan Rock and Roll Legends|website=Michiganrockandrolllegends.com|access-date=October 8, 2021}}</ref>

==Lawsuit==
{{main|Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s#Lawsuit}}
On November 21, 2007, The Romantics filed a [[lawsuit]] against [[Activision]], [[RedOctane]], [[Harmonix]], and [[WaveGroup Sound|Wavegroup Sound]] over the cover of the song "What I Like About You" used in ''[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]''. While the game developers did secure appropriate rights to cover the song in the game, The Romantics claim that the cover is "virtually indistinguishable from the authentic version" and thus would "[confuse] consumers into believing that the band actually recorded the music and endorsed the product". The lawsuit requested the cessation of sales of the game and monetary damage.

A [[summary judgment]] hearing was held on July 9, 2008,<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2008/08/soundalikes?currentPage=1 | title = Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Rock 'n' Roll Money Machine | magazine = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date = 2008-08-02 | access-date = 2008-08-04 | first = Bill | last = Hochberg }}</ref> and the case was dismissed the next month, with U.S. District Judge [[Nancy Garlock Edmunds|Nancy G. Edmunds]] stating that Activision had obtained the proper licensing for the works and that the band itself no longer held the copyright on the work.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/08/judge-dismisses.html | title = Judge Tosses Romantics'  Guitar Hero  Lawsuit | magazine = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | first = Eliot | last = Van Buskirk | date = 2008-08-25 | access-date = 2008-11-26 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081220020103/http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/08/judge-dismisses.html | archive-date = 2008-12-20 }}</ref>
