'''Uneven Structure''' is a [[progressive metal]] band based in Metz, France. They play a style of post-metal which is heavily influenced by the Swedish [[extreme metal]] band [[Meshuggah]]. The band blends polyrhythmic passages and extremely low tunings with a heavily layered production style and ambient soundscapes. They are often categorized in the [[djent]] movement due to the Meshuggah-like guitar tone they often employ. The band was formed after the split of Longchat, a band which featured Igor Omodei and Benoit Friedrich.

==History==
The band released an EP entitled ''8'' in 2009, which is available as a free download in its entirety from the band's official website. The EP is made up entirely of riffs discarded from the full length they were working on at the time (which became ''Februus'') pieced together and arranged into songs. The vocals were provided by Daniel Ädel of the Swedish band [[Vildhjarta]]. The band stated that it was put together to show that they could release something, as ''Februus'' was taking a long time to write and record.

On May 11, 2011, they signed to [[Basick Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basickrecords.com/news/view/basick-signs-french-masters-uneven-structure |title=BASICK signs French masters UNEVEN STRUCTURE!  |website=basickrecords.com |date=May 12, 2011 |access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> They embarked on their first ever tour in September 2011, touring the UK with [[Chimp Spanner]] and [[Tesseract (band)|TesseracT]]. Their first full-length release, ''Februus'', came out October 31, 2011 and received overwhelmingly positive reviews.<ref name = article162>http://www.basickrecords.com/news/article/162</ref><ref name = februusoctober>http://www.holdtightpr.com/news/article/uneven-structure-to-release-debut-album-februus-in-october</ref> Shortly after, drummer Christian Schreil departed from the band to form [[Means End (band)|Means End]] together with former [[Vildhjarta]] vocalist Robert Luciani. With the [[Euroblast Festival|Euroblast 7]] festival approaching, Mike Malyan of the British band Monuments generously acted as a stand in drummer until Jean Ferry joined Uneven Structure in late 2011.

The band began to play live shows again from late 2011 onwards, supporting [[Protest the Hero]], [[Textures (band)|Textures]] and [[Tesseract (band)|TesseracT]] on their respective tours. They also played at the Basick records showcase at Camden Barfly with label mates Chimp Spanner and The Algorithm.

Two videos were uploaded to Uneven Structure's YouTube account which contained clips of new material, suggesting that a new release was in the works. The band later confirmed this via their Facebook page, stating that the album's concept had been decided and that the writing process was in progress.

In 2013, a re-recorded version of their debut EP ''8'' was released, as a stopgap release to tide fans over until the completion of their second album.

July 21, 2015 was released the first single "Funambule"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://music.basickrecords.com/track/funambule|title=Funambule, by UNEVEN STRUCTURE|website=Basick Records|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> from the new album "La Partition", through [[Basick Records]]. It was not until February 24, 2017 that the second single "Incube"<ref>{{Citation|last=Long Branch Records|title=Uneven Structure – Incube (Official Video)|date=February 24, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndjjcEqRpRQ|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> was released, this time through Long Branch Records. "La Partition" in full was released April 21 of the same year while the band was touring Europe supporting [[Twelve Foot Ninja]]. The band toured extensively through 2017 and 2018.

Uneven Structure released their third full-length album "Paragon" on October 18, 2019. The first single "Innocent" premiered on July 25, 2019, accompanied by a music video directed by guitarist Igor Omodei.
