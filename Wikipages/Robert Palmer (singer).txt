Palmer's involvement in the [[music industry]] began in the 1960s and included a spell with the band [[Vinegar Joe (band)|Vinegar Joe]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /><ref name="Rockopedia">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 1998| title= Guinness Rockopedia| edition= 1st| publisher= Guinness Publishing Ltd.| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/307 307]| isbn= 0-85112-072-5| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/307}}</ref> He found success both in his solo career and with [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]], and had [[Top 40|Top 10]] songs in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1980s.

==Music career==
===1964–1973: Early bands===
Palmer's father was a British naval intelligence officer stationed in [[Malta]]. In 1949, Palmer moved with his family from [[Batley]], where he was born, to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. Influenced as a child by blues, soul and jazz music on [[American Forces Network|American Forces Radio]], Palmer joined his first band, the Mandrakes, at the age of 15 whilst still at [[Graham School|Scarborough High School for Boys]]. His first major break came with the departure of singer [[Jess Roden]] from the band [[The Alan Bown Set]] in 1969, after which Palmer was invited to London to sing on their single "Gypsy Girl".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book| first= Martin C.| last= Strong| year= 2014| title= The Great Rock Discography| edition= 5th| publisher= Mojo Books| location= Edinburgh| pages= 2–3| isbn= 978-1-84195-017-4}}</ref> The vocals for the album ''The Alan Bown!'', originally recorded by Roden (and released in the US that way), were re-recorded by Palmer after the success of the single. According to music journalist Paul Lester, Palmer rose from northern clubs in England to become "elegant and sophisticated" and the master of several styles.<ref name="BBC2003" />

In 1970 Palmer joined the 12-piece jazz-rock fusion band Dada, which featured singer [[Elkie Brooks]] and her husband [[Pete Gage (guitarist)|Pete Gage]]. After a year, Palmer, Brooks and Gage formed [[soul music|soul]]/[[rock music|rock]] band [[Vinegar Joe (band)|Vinegar Joe]]. Palmer played rhythm guitar in the band, and shared lead vocals with Brooks. Signed to the [[Island Records]] label, they released three albums: ''Vinegar Joe'' (1972), ''Rock 'n' Roll Gypsies'' (1972) and ''Six Star General'' (1973), before disbanding in March 1974.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /><ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd| location= London| page= 262| id= CN 5585}}</ref> Brooks later said Palmer "was a very good-looking guy", and that female fans were happy to find that Brooks and Palmer were not romantically linked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robert-palmer.over-blog.com/article-elkie-brooks-remembers-singing-with-robert-palmer-48458153.html|title=Elkie Brooks Remembers Singing With Robert Palmer - Robert Palmer : Music & Style|website=Robert-palmer.over-blog.com|access-date=16 July 2018}}</ref>

===1974–1984: Early solo career===
[[Island Records]] signed Palmer to a solo deal in 1974.<ref name="Rockopedia" /> His first solo album, ''[[Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley]]'', recorded in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, in 1974, was heavily influenced by the music of [[Little Feat]] and the funk fusion of [[the Meters]], who acted as the backing band along with producer/guitarist [[Lowell George]] of Little Feat.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Unsuccessful in the UK, both the album and single reached the Top 100 in the US.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Notably, "Sailin' Shoes" (the album's first track, and a Little Feat cover), Palmer's own "Hey Julia", and the [[Allen Toussaint]]-penned title track carry virtually the same rhythm, and were packaged on the album as a "trilogy" without a pause between them.

After relocating with his wife to New York City, Palmer released ''[[Pressure Drop (album)|Pressure Drop]]'', named for the cover version of the reggae hit by [[Toots and the Maytals]], in November 1975 (featuring [[Motown]] bassist [[James Jamerson]]).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> He toured with Little Feat to promote the [[reggae]]- and rock-infused album.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /><ref name="Rockopedia" />

With the failure of follow-up album ''[[Some People Can Do What They Like]]'', Palmer decided to move to [[Nassau, Bahamas]], directly across the street from [[Compass Point Studios]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

In 1978, he released ''[[Double Fun]]'', a collection of [[Caribbean]]-influenced rock, including a [[cover version|cover]] of "[[You Really Got Me]]". The album reached the Top 50 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart and scored a Top 20 single with the [[Andy Fraser]]-penned "[[Every Kinda People]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> The song has been covered by other artists including [[Chaka Demus]] and Pliers, [[Randy Crawford]], [[the Mint Juleps]] (produced by [[Trevor Horn]]) and [[Amy Grant]]. It reached number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

Palmer's next album was an artistic departure, concentrating on pure rock.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> 1979's ''[[Secrets (Robert Palmer album)|Secrets]]'' produced his second Top 20 single with [[Moon Martin]]'s "[[Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> The number 14 hit also gave Palmer his second Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart hit.

The 1980s saw Palmer find increasing commercial success, as well as more comfort in the role of producer, such as with his production of Jamaican ska legend [[Desmond Dekker|Desmond Dekker's]] 1981 album ''Compass Point''. The album ''[[Clues (Robert Palmer album)|Clues]]'', produced by Palmer and featuring [[Chris Frantz]] and [[Gary Numan]], generated hits on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], first with the radio-friendly single "[[Johnny and Mary]]" and then "[[Looking for Clues]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Catchy music videos matching the [[synth-pop]] stylings of [[New wave music|new wave]] gave him much-needed exposure to a younger audience. The success was repeated with the 1982 EP release of ''[[Some Guys Have All the Luck]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

In April 1983 ''[[Pride (Robert Palmer album)|Pride]]'' was released. While not as commercially successful as ''Clues'', it featured the title song and Palmer's cover of [[The System (band)|the System]]'s "[[You Are in My System]]", with the System's [[David Frank (musician)|David Frank]] contributing keyboard tracks to the latter song.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> On 31 May 1983, Palmer's concert at the [[Hammersmith Palais]] was recorded and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>[http://www.yourwaytomusic.com/new-robert-palmer-live-bbc-concert-cd/ New Robert Palimer Live BBC Concert CD] Your Way To Music. Retrieved 19 April 2012</ref> On 23 July 1983, Palmer performed at [[Duran Duran's charity concert at Villa Park 1983|Duran Duran's charity concert at Aston Villa football ground]], where he struck up friendships with members of [[Duran Duran]] that would spawn the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]].

===1985–1997: The Power Station and MTV success===
When Duran Duran went on hiatus, guitarist [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] and bassist [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]] joined former [[Chic (band)|Chic]] drummer [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] and Palmer to form [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]].<ref name="Rockopedia" /> Their [[The Power Station (album)|eponymous album]], recorded mainly at [[Avatar Studios|the New York recording studio]] for which the band was named, with overdubs and mixing at [[Compass Point Studios]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas]], reached the Top 20 in the UK and the Top 10 in the US. It spawned two hit singles with "[[Some Like It Hot (song)|Some Like It Hot]]" (US number 6) and a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] song "[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On (Bang a Gong)]]", which peaked one position higher than the original at US number 9. Palmer performed live with the band only once that year, on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The band toured, and played [[Live Aid]], with singer [[Michael Des Barres]] after Palmer bowed out at the last moment to go back into the recording studio to further his solo career.

Some critics described Palmer's abandonment of the tour as unprofessional. In ''[[Number One (magazine)|Number One]]'' magazine, he hit back at the claims he joined the band for money: "Firstly, I didn't need the money and, secondly the cash was a long time coming. It wasn't exactly an experience that set me up for retirement."<ref name=one2>[[Number One (magazine)|Number One]] magazine, circa 1986: "Bob's Your Uncle" by Pat Thomas, pp 28–29.</ref> He also was accused of ripping off the Power Station sound for his own records. He snapped: "Listen, I gave the Power Station that sound. They took it from me, not the other way around."<ref name=one2 />

Palmer recorded the album ''[[Riptide (album)|Riptide]]'' at Compass Point Studios in 1985, recruiting Thompson and Andy Taylor to play on some tracks plus Power Station record producer [[Bernard Edwards]], who worked with Thompson in Chic, to helm the production. ''Riptide'' featured the single "[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]", which reached number 1 in the United States and number 5 in the United Kingdom.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2006).

London: Guinness World Records Limited</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/robert-palmer |title=Robert Palmer |publisher=Billboard |access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref> The single was accompanied by a memorable and much-imitated music video, directed by [[Terence Donovan (photographer)|Terence Donovan]], in which Palmer is surrounded by a bevy of near-identically clad, heavily made-up female models simulating "musicians".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Donovan also directed videos for the [[hit record|hits]] "Simply Irresistible" and "I Didn't Mean to Turn You On".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" />  In September 1986, Palmer performed "Addicted to Love" at the [[1986 MTV Video Music Awards]] in Los Angeles.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/performers.jhtml 1986 MTV Video Music Awards] MTV.com. Retrieved 5 December 2011</ref> In 1987, he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]] for "Addicted to Love". At the 1987 [[Brit Awards]], Palmer received his first nomination for Best British Male.<ref name="BritAwards" />

Another single from ''Riptide'', his cover of [[Cherrelle]]'s "[[I Didn't Mean to Turn You On]]", also performed well (US number 2, UK number 9).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Another song, "Trick Bag", was written by one of his major influences, New Orleans jazz artist [[Earl King]].

Concerned about the rising crime rate in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], Palmer moved to [[Lugano]], Switzerland in 1987 and set up his own recording studio.<ref name="Rockopedia" /> Producing ''[[Heavy Nova (album)|Heavy Nova]]'' in 1988, Palmer again returned to experimenting, this time with [[bossa nova]] rhythms, heavy rock and white-soul balladeering. He repeated his previous success of "Addicted to Love" with the video of "[[Simply Irresistible (song)|Simply Irresistible]]", again with a troupe of female "musicians". The song reached number 2 in the US and was Palmer's final Top Ten hit there. The ballad "[[She Makes My Day]]" also proved to be a hit in the UK, peaking at number 6.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> In 1989, he won a second [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy]] for "Simply Irresistible",<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd| location= London| page= 453| id= CN 5585}}</ref> which would later be featured in the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[Contact (musical)|Contact]]''. At the 1989 [[Brit Awards]], Palmer received his second nomination for Best British Male, and "Simply Irresistible" was nominated for Best British Single.<ref name="BritAwards" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine voted Palmer the best-dressed rock star for 1990.

Palmer expanded his range even further for his next album, ''[[Don't Explain (Robert Palmer album)|Don't Explain]]'' (1990). It featured two UK top 10 hits with covers of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[I'll Be Your Baby Tonight#Robert Palmer and UB 40 version|I'll Be Your Baby Tonight]]" (a collaboration with [[UB40]]) and [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)|Mercy Mercy Me]]". Throughout the 1990s, Palmer ventured further into diverse material. The 1992 album ''[[Ridin' High (Robert Palmer album)|Ridin' High]]'' was a tribute to the [[Tin Pan Alley]] era.<ref name="Rockopedia" /><ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

In 1994, Palmer released ''[[Honey (Robert Palmer album)|Honey]]'' to mixed reviews. While the album failed to produce any hit singles in the US, he did find success in the UK with the release of three modest hit singles "[[Girl U Want#Robert Palmer version|Girl U Want]]", "[[Know by Now]]" and "[[You Blow Me Away]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

In 1995 Palmer released a greatest hits album, which reached number 4 in the UK.<ref name="BBC2003" /> Also in 1995 he reunited with other members of Power Station to record a second album. Bassist John Taylor eventually backed out of the project, to be replaced by [[Bernard Edwards]]. Palmer and the rest of the band completed the album ''[[Living in Fear]]'' (1996), and had just begun touring when Edwards died from [[pneumonia]].

In 1997, Palmer performed with [[Rod Stewart]] at Wembley.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kovats|first1=Tom|title=Rod Stewart Robert Palmer Some Boys Have All The Luck Live Songs & Visions Concert Wembley 1997|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF44-y74dsw|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Palmer met Sue, his future wife, at [[Slough railway station]] in 1969, attracted by her style (silver-coloured boots and a matching mini-dress) and by the [[science-fiction]] book she was reading.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music-some-guys-have-all-the-luck-1081541.html|title=Music: Some guys have all the luck|website=Independent.co.uk|access-date=16 July 2018}}</ref> They married two years later, and had two children. The family moved to [[New York City]] in the mid-1970s and then to the [[Bahamas]] a few years later. In 1987, Palmer and his family relocated to [[Lugano|Lugano, Switzerland]]. They divorced in 1999.<ref name=TelegraphObit>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1442580/Robert-Palmer.html |title=Obituaries: Robert Palmer |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=27 September 2003 |access-date=19 December 2013}}</ref>

A quiet man in his personal life, Palmer was uninterested in most of the excesses of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle, although he was a very heavy tobacco user who smoked as many as 60 cigarettes a day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joel Selvin, Chronicle Senior, Pop Music Critic |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/British-rock-star-Robert-Palmer-dies-at-54-2555518.php |title=British rock star Robert Palmer dies at 54 |website=Sfgate.com |date=2003-09-27 |access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref>
