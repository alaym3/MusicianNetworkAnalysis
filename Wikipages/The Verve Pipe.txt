'''The Verve Pipe''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Michigan]]. It was formed in 1992 in [[East Lansing]] by [[Brian Vander Ark]], Brian Stout and Donny Brown.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

==History==
In November 1992, Brian Vander Ark of the band "Johnny with an Eye" signed a production deal with producer/engineer Thomas Jansen, owner of Station C Studios Inc. After Jansen produced, recorded and mixed all "Johnny with an Eye" tracks, Jansen was looking for a little more from the band. During this same period of time Jansen was courting Don Brown's "Water for the Pool" band to come over and record the rest of their album at Station C Studios. Frazer was then given the job of engineering the rest of their album project. In a conversation with Vander Ark, Jansen advised Vander Ark to call Brown to join the band with one guitar member of "Water for the Pool". Frazer then engineered Brown's drums and vocals, and Stout's guitars and vocals, on "Johnny with an Eye" songs, and Vander Arks's guitar and vocals on "Water for the Pool" songs. Frazer mixed the new band released their first album, ''[[I've Suffered a Head Injury]]''. The original 10-song version of the [[Compact disc|CD]] is no longer available. A seven-song version, without the original recording of "The Freshmen", was later released as an [[Extended play|EP]]. The band, known for its energetic live performances, built strong followings during its early years, especially in the college towns of Kalamazoo and East Lansing.

In the fall of 1993, the band released a second album, ''[[Pop Smear]]'', again working with Jansen for pre-production and basic tracks and Frazer with overdubs and mixing, which helped them gain a devoted following in their native state of [[Michigan]] and their eventual signing with [[RCA Records]] in 1995. A.J. Dunning replaced Stout on guitar for the recording of ''Pop Smear'' and remained in the band for their three RCA [[Gramophone record|records]]. This album featured the popular tracks "Spoonful of Sugar" and "Victoria".

Their first major label release was 1996's ''[[Villains (The Verve Pipe album)|Villains]]'', which was a minor hit and launched two respectably selling [[single (music)|singles]], first "Photograph", then the No.&nbsp;5 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[hit record|hit]] "[[The Freshmen (song)|The Freshmen]]", which was their [[One-hit wonder|only pop hit]]. On June 28, 1997, the band performed at [[Edgefest]] in [[Barrie]], [[Canada]]. While performing, someone in the crowd threw a beer bottle towards the stage and it hit Brian Vander Ark in the cheek.<ref>{{cite web|title=Edgefest in a Word : SCORCHING!|url=http://www.chartattack.com/damn/070297.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208100523/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/070297.html|archive-date=2005-12-08|access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> The band then left the stage to seek medical attention.

The band came back with a new album, ''[[The Verve Pipe (album)|The Verve Pipe]]'', in 1999. The album, however, failed to achieve the commercial appeal of its predecessor. The band's 2001 release ''[[Underneath (The Verve Pipe album)|Underneath]]'' contained the song "Colorful", which was featured on the [[soundtrack]] of the [[film]] ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'', and "Happiness Is", featured on the soundtrack of the film ''Joe Somebody''.

On September 15, 2009, Brian Vander Ark announced on his website that the band would be releasing a new album called ''[[A Family Album]]'' in October 2009. The band had been approached to contribute a song for a [[compilation album]] called ''Calling All Kids'', which led to them creating an "entire album of family[-]friendly songs". It was also noted in the announcement that a new album of rock material would follow the family album.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080914022516/http://brianvanderark.com/home.php ]</ref> Immediately after the release of the family album, the band undertook a series of small-venue performances, mostly around Michigan and the East Coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thevervepipe.com/|title=Home|website=Thevervepipe.com}}</ref>

On December 31, 2013, Drummer Donny Brown leaves the band.

On Feb 1, 2014, Channing Lee joins The Verve Pipe as a backup singer and songwriting collaborator.

On March 28, 2014, the band announced on their [[Facebook]] page that their first studio album since 2001, titled ''Overboard'', would be released on June 17, 2014, and would be followed with a tour. The first single from the album, titled "Crash Landing", was released on April 1, 2014.<ref name="facebook3-28-2014">{{cite web|title=The Verve Pipe - Timeline Photos - Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/thevervepipe/photos/a.136783753657.111485.39028013657/10152328696663658/?type=1|work=The Verve Pipe on Facebook|publisher=[[Facebook]]|access-date=April 28, 2014|author=The Verve Pipe|date=March 28, 2014}}</ref>

On February 17, 2017, the band released the full length album ''Parachute.''

On August 1, 2021, founding member Brad Vander Ark rejoined the band.

On November 5, 2021, the band released its 9th full length album, ''Threads,'' w/Channing Lee and Brian Vander Ark collaborating on all 12 tracks. Critical praise includes the American Songwriter Review:  "...Frontman and singer/songwriter Brian Vander Ark seems especially inspired, sounding the alarm on an array of maladies and pitfalls—love, loss, romance, relationship, addiction, and abuse—without settling for a sound that’s bitter or despondent. Indeed, most of the songs manage to retain a tender touch, especially tracks like “Save Me,” “Set Me On Fire,” “The Freeze,” and “End of the World,” all of which boast a shimmer and shine. “The Witching Hour,” “First Fire of the Winter” and “No One’s Gonna Break Your Heart (Again)” take on a lilt and luster reminiscent of Jon Anderson at the helm of Yes, given an attitude that optimizes an upward view. Newcomer Channing Lee can also be credited with helping to maintain that effervescent engagement, manifest in a radiant glow that’s cerebral and celebratory in equal measure." <div style="text-align:center;"></div>
