'''Osvaldo Dragún''' (May 7, 1929 Entre Ríos, Argentina –June 14, 1999 Buenos Aires, Argentina) was a prominent Argentine playwright and the director of Cervantes Theater.

==Life and work==
Osvaldo Dragún was born in [[Colonia Berro]], a [[History of the Jews in Argentina#Agricultural settlement|Jewish agricultural settlement]], near [[San Salvador, Entre Ríos|San Salvador]] in [[Entre Ríos Province]], [[Argentina]]. After his father's [[linseed]] farm suffered from recurrent [[locust]] problems, the family left the settlement for Buenos Aires. Dragún left his university studies in 1953 to pursue his calling in the theatre.<ref name=audio>[http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/com_social/audiovideoteca/teatro/dragun_bio_es.php Audiovideoteca de Buenos Aires {{in lang|es}}]</ref> Joining the [[Fray Mocho]] Theatre in 1956, he premiered his first work, ''La peste viene de Melos'' (''The Plague from Melos''). The politically charged play, on the 1954 [[Operation PBSUCCESS|coup d'état]] against [[Guatemala]]n President [[Jacobo Arbenz|Jacobo Árbenz]], drew also from the playwright's own childhood memories of his father's struggles with locusts.<ref name=dragun>[http://usuarios.lycos.es/eitalc/osvaldo_dragun.htm Osvaldo Dragún: Final de partida {{in lang|es}}]</ref>

He continued to write controversial works for the Fray Mocho, including ''Historias para ser contadas'' (''Tales to be Told''), a series of short plays including ''Historia del hombre que se convirtió en perro'' (''[[The Story of the Man Who Turned into a Dog]]''),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Orgy: The Modern Stage in Latin America: Six Plays |first=George |last=Woodyard |year=1971 |location=New York |publisher=Dutton }}</ref> ''[[Tupac Amaru(play)|Tupac Amaru]]'' and ''Milagro en el mercado viejo'' (''Miracle at the Old Market''), for which he received the Casa de las Américas Prize in 1962. His 1966 play, ''Heroica de Buenos Aires'' received the same distinction.<ref>[http://dramateatro.fundacite.arg.gov.ve/ensayos/n_0002/teatro_abierto_argentino.html DramaTeatro: El Teatro Abierto Argentino {{in lang|es}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919053832/http://dramateatro.fundacite.arg.gov.ve/ensayos/n_0002/teatro_abierto_argentino.html |date=2009-09-19 }}</ref> That June, however, one of Argentine independent theatre's most powerful opponents, General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], took power in a quiet coup.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/4-11841-2008-11-03.html ''Página/12'': murió José Luis Mangieri {{in lang|es}}]</ref> Dragún's stays abroad, which had begun in 1961, became more frequent, directing plays in several other [[Latin America]]n countries and in the [[United States]].<ref name=todo>[http://www.todo-argentina.net/biografias/Personajes1/dragun.php Todo Argentina: personajes {{in lang|es}}]</ref> He continued to write politically themed plays, however, notably ''Historias con cárcel'' (''Stories and Jail'').<ref name=audio/> He helped establish the [[Campana, Buenos Aires|Campana]] Comedy Theatre in 1969 and, six years later, premiered ''El Jardín del Infierno'' ("The Garden of Hell") there.<ref>[http://www.comediadecampana.com.ar/ingles/curriculum.htm Comedia de Campana {{in lang|es}}]</ref>

By then, independent [[Argentine culture#Cinema and theatre|Argentine theatre]] was limited not only by the boom in commercial theatre productions; but also by a climate of [[Dirty War|repression]]. Threats to artistic freedom during the country's [[National Reorganization Process|last dictatorship]] were eased somewhat in 1980 with the support of the relatively moderate [[Argentine Army|Army]] Chief, General [[Roberto Viola]]. Dragún then premiered his ''¿Y por casa cómo andamos?'' (''How're We Doing at Home?''), a commentary on unhappy, paternalistic households and their effects on culture. The slowly improving climate of freedoms also led Dragún to form a partnership with fellow playwrights [[Carlos Gorostiza]] and [[Roberto Cossa]], as well as with numerous actors, to form an "[[Argentine Open Theatre]]", by which they hoped to encourage a return of the freedom of expression whose absence had led so many other cultural figures to leave Argentina since 1975. Converting a shuttered spark plug factory in the [[Balvanera]] district of Buenos Aires to the "Picadero Theatre," they premiered a festival of their collective new works (including Dragún's  ''Mi obelisco y yo'' - ''"My [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires|Obelisk]] and Me"'') to acclaim on July 28, 1981. This success was marred by the theatre's fire bombing a week later, still an "unsolved mystery."<ref name=abierto>[http://www.centrocultural.coop/revista/articulo/62/teatro_abierto_conferencia_de_prensa_del_12_de_mayo_de_1981_proyecto_cultural_de_resistencia.html Centro Cultural Floreal Gorini: conferencia de prensa del 12 de mayo de 1981 {{in lang|es}}]</ref>

The setback did not shutter the Open Theatre, however, which reopened in [[Corrientes Avenue]]'s famed [[Tabaris Theatre]] (well-known locally for its [[revue]]). The Open Theatre's 1982 season, whose slogan was "winning back the streets," featured Dragún's ''Al violador'' (''To the Rapist''). The play was one in a trilogy that included ''Al perdedor'' (''To the loser'') - a semi-biographical look at ill-fated boxer [[José María Gatica]] - and ''Al vencedor'' (''To the Victor'').<ref name=abierto/> Following the Open Theatre's final season, in 1985, he wrote ''Arriba, corazón'' (''Take Heart''). The 1987 play was a success, and in 1988 Dragún established the Theatre School of Latin America and the Caribbean in [[Havana]] (where he lived for a time), and reopened the Popular Theatre in Buenos Aires, in 1989.<ref name=todo/>

Dragún relocated to [[Mexico City]]; but returned in 1996 to accept the prestigious post of Director of the [[Cervantes Theatre (Buenos Aires)|Cervantes National Theatre]]. He helped revive the struggling Cervantes by organizing "theatre marathons" and the Ibero-American Theatre Encounters, which highlighted troupes from the Argentine hinterland and from other countries in the region, respectively. The director of the Cervantes was enjoying a night out with his wife at the Gran Splendid Cinema (today the [[El Ateneo Grand Splendid]] bookstore) on June 14, 1999, when he lost his life to heart failure at age 70.<ref name=clarin>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/1999/06/15/e-03401d.htm ''Clarín'' {{in lang|es}}]</ref>

The outspoken Osvaldo Dragún was often out of favor among his colleagues, about which he once said:

<blockquote>
''I've always lived on islands. Cuba is an island, and the Fray Mocho Theatre was, too. My hope is that one day, these islands will be the continent of creativity and magic.''
