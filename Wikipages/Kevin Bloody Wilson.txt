'''Kevin Bloody Wilson''' (born '''Dennis Bryant'''; 13 February 1947) is an Australian musical comedian who performs [[Comedy music|comical songs]] with his heavy [[Australian English]] accent and often including sexual themes. He has won one [[ARIA Music Award]].

== Early career ==
Bryant was born in Bathurst, although he identifies with [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], Western Australia, where he was an [[electrician]] in the [[gold mines]].

In the 1970s, Bryant fronted his own band called 'Bryan Dennis and the Country Club'.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Butler |first1=Bruce |title=Singing barber was a cut above |url=https://www.kalminer.com.au/news/kalgoorlie-miner/singing-barber-was-a-cut-above-ng-b88555162z |date=8 August 2017 |website=Kalgoorlie Miner}}</ref> He also used the name 'Bryan Dennis' when he hosted a country music show on radio 6KG in Kalgoorlie from 1973 to 1980, before he was thrown off air for playing the parody song, "I'm Heaving on a Jet Plane".

He moved to [[Perth]] and began playing bawdy songs as a hobby, singing at pubs and [[Australian rules football]] clubs. In 1984, he put together a cassette of his songs called ''[[Your Average Australian Yobbo]]'',<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bartlett |first1=Joshua |title=Politically incorrect comedian Kevin Bloody Wilson heads to Bargo |date=22 February 2019 |url=https://www.wollondillyadvertiser.com.au/story/5918691/politically-incorrect-comedian-kevin-bloody-wilson-heads-to-bargo/ |website=Wollondilly Advertiser}}</ref> which he sold at gigs and by mail order. He managed to sell 22,000 copies of the cassette before it was eventually transferred to LP, where it went on to sell many thousands more.

He is one of Perth's most famous comedians.<ref name = "SpecialKs">{{cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2002/10/04/1033538768080.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20021008045518/http://www.smh.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=%2Farticles%2F2002%2F10%2F04%2F1033538768080.html|url-status = dead|archive-date = 8 October 2002|title = Special Ks|last = Morgan|first = Amanda|date = 4 October 2002|access-date = 8 May 2008|publisher = Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/i-just-gave-myself-a-name/2006/06/22/1150845292184.html|title = I just gave myself a name|last= Zuel|first = Bernard|publisher = Sydney Morning Herald|date = 24 June 2006|access-date = 8 May 2008}}</ref> His humour is regarded by media commentators as [[political correctness|politically incorrect]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coleman |first1=Finn |title=Kevin Bloody Wilson is bring his new F.U.P.C.

Kevin appeared on the popular television show ''[[Enough Rope]]'' with [[Andrew Denton]] in October 2008, which resulted in the show's highest ratings of the year.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} On the show, he told of how he met his wife Betty, who was originally from Kalgoorlie, but lived in [[Perth]] at the time they met. She had returned to the town to visit friends and her brother who still lived there and they met when she attended one of his shows. Betty, who was in the studio audience, told Denton that Kevin was a romantic who regularly bought her flowers.

"The Genie in the Bottle" is a country song Kevin co-wrote with [[Adam Harvey]] that spent more than 6 weeks on the Australian Country Singles chart{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} as well as reaching the number one video spot on the [[Country Music Television]] Channel in 2008.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Website==
Wilson was the first Australian performing artist to have a website which a friend set up for him in 1993, which has since been a major source of album and product sales. He also runs an internet radio station kevfm.com, which was the first 24-hour adult comedy radio station.<ref name = "courier"/>

== Daughter ==
Tammy Jo "[[Jenny Talia]]" Bryant has followed in her father's footsteps singing similarly bawdy songs, some of them being reworded Kev songs, but done from a female perspective.<ref name="jennytalia">{{cite web|url=http://www.jennytalia.com |title=JennyTalia.com &#124; Wife Mother Comedian |publisher=jennytalia.com|access-date=29 September 2015}}</ref><ref name="myspace">{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/jennytaliafromaustralia |title=Featured Content on Myspace &#124; www.myspace.com/jennytaliafromaustralia |publisher=myspace.com|access-date=29 September 2015}}</ref>
