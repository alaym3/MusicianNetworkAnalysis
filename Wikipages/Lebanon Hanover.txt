==Style==
Lebanon Hanover's music have been compared to 80s [[gothic rock]]/[[post-punk]] acts such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[The Cure]] and [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]. The band has a minimal, dark sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peek-a-boo-magazine.be/en/interviews/lebanon-hanover/|title = LEBANON HANOVER - interview by Peek-A-Boo magazine}}</ref> Their songs have a signature light [[synthesiser|synth]] sounds, deep [[bass guitar|bass]] and melancholic lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.splitterkultur.de/2015/02/17/lebanon-hanover-besides-the-abyss-vo-15-02-2015-video-tourdaten/|title=Lebanon Hanover - Besides the Abyss (VÃ¶. 15.02.2015)|date=17 February 2015}}</ref>

William Maybelline is responsible for the rhythm, synthesizer and bass, which add to the music like an ordered frame, while contributing with more chaotic fragments. As a common conceptual idea, it simply describes simple production, which is based on the desire to generate an organic sound as possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://secretthirteen.org/interview-with-lebanon-hanover/|title = Lebanon Hanover - Secret Thirteen Interview &#124; Secret Thirteen|date = 17 March 2013}}</ref>
