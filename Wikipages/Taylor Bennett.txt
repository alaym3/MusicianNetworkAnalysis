Bennett was selected as the Yellow Jackets' backup quarterback before the 2004 game against the [[Maryland Terrapins]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Kyle|last=Thomason|url=http://nique.net/issues/2004-10-29/sports/4|title=Talented freshmen earn playing time, contribute|work=[[The Technique]]|date=October 29, 2004|accessdate=May 17, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070109025022/http://www.nique.net/issues/2004-10-29/sports/4 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = January 9, 2007}}</ref> Prior to the 2007 season, he started in two games; in 2005 against the [[Connecticut Huskies]] when [[Reggie Ball]] had [[viral meningitis]],<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Bretherton|url=http://nique.net/issues/2005-09-30/sports/3|title=Backup Bennett steps up when called upon|work=[[The Technique]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=May 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134510/http://nique.net/issues/2005-09-30/sports/3 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nikhil |last=Joshi |url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-09-23/news/3 |title=Viral meningitis |work=[[The Technique]] |date=September 23, 2005 |accessdate=March 4, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141156/http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-09-23/news/3 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> and in the 2007 [[Gator Bowl]] against the [[West Virginia Mountaineers]] when [[Reggie Ball]] was academically ineligible to play.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls06/news/story?id=2704246|title=Georgia Tech's Ball, Scott ruled out of Gator Bowl|date=December 20, 2007|accessdate=March 8, 2007}}</ref> At the Connecticut game, Bennett became only the second quarterback in [[NCAA]] history to complete a pass for a touchdown in his first ever collegiate play from scrimmage. The only other quarterback to do this was former [[USC Trojans football|Southern California]] quarterback [[Matt Leinart]]. In May 2007, Bennett was given a Spring Team honorable mention by [[The Sporting News]] in recognition of his outstanding performance in spring practice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Bennett had a mediocre showing in Georgia Tech's 2007 season, finishing 7-6, 4-4 ACC, including a loss to Fresno State. After the [[2007 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|2007 season]], [[Paul Johnson (American football coach)|Paul Johnson]] was named as Georgia Tech's new head coach. Many believed that Bennett would not fit well into Johnson's [[option offense]], and in February 2008 Bennett announced that he planned to transfer to another school for the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3234385|title=Bennett plans to transfer, won't play senior season at Ga. Tech|date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=April 19, 2008}}</ref> On April 28, it was announced that Bennett would transfer to [[Louisiana Tech]], and the [[NCAA]] would allow him to play in the 2008 season rather than sitting out a season as most transfers are required to do.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/uga/stories/2008/04/28/techbennett_0429.html|title=Ex-Jackets QB leaving to become a Bulldog|date=April 28, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}</ref>

Bennett won the starting job for the Bulldogs during 2008 fall camp. He led his new team to a victory over the [[Mississippi State Bulldogs]] of the [[Southeastern Conference]] in the 2008 season opener. Unfortunately, this proved to be the highlight of Bennett's season with the Bulldogs. Over the first five games of the season Bennett completed only 39 percent of his passes. He threw 2 touchdowns and 5 interceptions and led the team to a 2-3 record. After a disappointing loss to [[2008 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawaii]], in which Bennett threw 2 interceptions, head coach [[Derek Dooley (coach)|Derek Dooley]] announced that sophomore Ross Jenkins would start the next game against [[Idaho Vandals football|Idaho]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latechsports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101308aab.html|title=Dooley Names Jenkins Starter for Idaho game|date=October 13, 2008|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}</ref> Bennett saw little action for the rest of the season. He went 5 for 11 in only 2 games for no touchdowns and 1 interception.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=156624|title=Taylor Bennett Stats|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}</ref>

===Sweden===
During the 2009 season Bennett was the starting quarterback for the [[Stockholm Mean Machines]] in Stockholm, Sweden. A season that ended with the club's 11th national championship. Bennett finished his season in the EFL playing for the Stockholm Mean Machine with a 6-2 record although the team finished 14-3. The team went on to win the national championship, thus qualifying for the Euro-Championship tournament. Taylor finished the season with 1756 yards passing, 26 touchdowns, and just 3 interceptions.

==Political career==
A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Bennett ran in a special election to replace Republican [[Mike Jacobs (Georgia politician)|Mike Jacobs]] for the right to represent District 80 in the Georgia House of Representatives. He won a runoff election against former [[Brookhaven, Georgia]] mayor [[J. Max Davis]] on August 11, 2015 to capture the seat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/voters-decide-brookhaven-state-house-seat/nnHMn/|title=Democrat wins runoff for Brookhaven House seat|work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|first=Mark|last=Niesse|date=August 11, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}</ref>

In 2016, Bennett was defeated for reelection by Atlanta attorney [[Meagan Hanson]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/hanson-defeats-bennett-for-brookhaven-area-house-seat/D22bXSMD1yWnWRcFG4bFzL/|title = Hanson defeats Bennett for Brookhaven-area House seat|newspaper = The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|last1 = Niesse|first1 = Mark}}</ref>
