==Music career==
In 2011, Dej Loaf began her career as a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist.

Plus her flow is a brook, her producer respects her space, and her two sex rhymes are into it and into it more."<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=May 13, 2016|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/expert-witness-dawn-oberg-dej-loaf|title=The Poet and the Hustler: Expert Witness with Robert Christgau|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=May 14, 2016}}</ref>
