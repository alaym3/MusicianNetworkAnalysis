'''Black Country, New Road''' (commonly abbreviated to '''BCNR''' or '''BC,NR''') are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 2018, consisting of Isaac Wood (vocals, guitar), Tyler Hyde (bass), Lewis Evans (saxophone), Georgia Ellery (violin), May Kershaw (keys), Charlie Wayne (drums) and Luke Mark (guitar). Their sound has been described as [[experimental rock]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cartledge |first1=Luke |title=Black Country, New Road – ‘For The First Time’ review: an utterly mesmerising debut |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/black-country-new-road-for-the-first-time-review-radar-2871737 |website=[[NME]] |access-date=5 February 2021 |date=4 February 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> with the band being compared to 90s acts such as [[Slint]]. They released their debut album ''[[For the First Time (Black Country, New Road album)|For the First Time]]'' on 5 February 2021.

==History==

Wood, Hyde, Evans, Ellery, Kershaw and Wayne, along with Connor Browne and Jonny Pyke, were members of Nervous Conditions; a Cambridge, UK-based band with dual drums and a similar, but more improvised sound, to Black Country, New Road. They formed in 2015 and in 2017 recorded a full-length album, provisionally titled ''Zak's Anniversary''. The album was shelved and remains officially unreleased.  Following multiple allegations against Browne, of sexual assault<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/nervous-conditions-split-following-sexual-assault-allegations-against-front|title=Nervous Conditions split following sexual assault allegations against frontman|website=thelineofbestfit.com|date=January 30, 2018|accessdate=December 18, 2020}}</ref> they split in early 2018. The ensemble without Browne (and without the second drums of Pyke) reconvened soon after as Black Country, New Road; then as a six-piece band. They performed several live shows and gained a small level of notoriety in the underground scene in London. Their debut single, "Athen's {{sic}}, France", released on 18 January 2019, and was pressed on a limited run of 250 [[7-inch]] singles via [[Speedy Wunderground]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/news/listen-black-country-new-road-athens-france|title=Listen: Black Country, New Road - 'Athens, France'|website=clashmusic.com|date=January 18, 2019|accessdate=November 18, 2020}}</ref>

The band gained its seventh member, Luke Mark, between the release of "Athens, France" and their second single, "[[Sunglasses (Black Country, New Road song)|Sunglasses]]". This second single released on 25 July 2019, via Blank Editions, and had three different 7-inch pressings: the first was limited to 500 copies and had a unique picture assembled onto the cover by the band themselves, the second limited to 250 with the cover art featuring a [[marching band]], and the third with an unknown number of copies and a picture of the band assembling the first pressing. The single gained the attention and acclaim of many critics, including Stereogum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2052485/black-country-new-road-sunglasses/music/|title=Black Country, New Road – "Sunglasses"|website=stereogum.com|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=December 18, 2020}}</ref>
