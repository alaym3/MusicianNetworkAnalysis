'''The Lox''' (stylized '''The LOX''' or '''The L.O.X.''') is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group formed in 1994, from [[Yonkers, New York]]. The group is composed of [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast rappers]] [[Sheek Louch]], [[Styles&nbsp;P]] and [[Jadakiss]]. They had originally signed to [[Sean Combs]]' [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]] in 1995, before joining [[Ruff Ryders]] in 1999, and have since launched their own label, D-Block.

==History==
===Formation and career beginnings (1994–1996)===
Jason "[[Jadakiss]]" Phillips, David "[[Styles P]]" Styles, and Sean "[[Sheek Louch]]" Jacobs, began their musical careers in their hometown of [[Yonkers, New York]].<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=240}}</ref> As high school students, they formed a group called the Bomb Squad and began performing at local shows and producing their own demos. In 1994, they appeared on [[Main Source]]'s "Set It Off" from the album ''[[Fuck What You Think]]''. While the local rap scene was being dominated by artists like Raw Rome, Lord Devon and a young [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], the group began to gain attention for their lyrical style and ability to present tales of urban life. The group eventually changed their name to the Warlox and continued developing a fan base by appearing on underground mixtapes.
At some point, the trio connected with [[Jaz-O]], and had a demo tape produced by him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfdtv.com/story/41673418/kingz-kounty-media-group-presents-jaz-os-new-ep-the-warmup-available-february-7th-on-all-platforms-via-equity-distribution|website=www.rfdtv.com|title=Kingz Kounty Media Group Presents Jaz-O's New EP "The WarmUp" Available February 7th on All Platforms Via Equity Distribution|date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> One of their admirers was the "Queen of hip hop soul," fellow Yonkers native [[Mary J. Blige]].<ref name="Larkin90"/> After acquiring the demo tape that the group made with Jaz-O, Blige passed it on to [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]] CEO [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puffy" Combs]] who signed them to a deal.<ref name="Larkin90"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1426166/the-lox-get-by-with-a-little-help-from-puffy-and-mary-j-blige/|title=The Lox Get By With A Little Help From Puffy And Mary J. Blige|website=www.mtv.com|author=MTV News Staff|date=January 15, 1998|quote=She was like a number one fan for us. She was loving our music before anybody, and she just brought us to Puff. Puff was looking for a group, a rap group, at that time. It was instant. It just clicked like that. It was chemistry.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mrcnnlive.com/jaz-o-the-immobilarie-kingz-kounty-album/|title=Jaz-O & The Immobilarie "Kingz Kounty" (Album)|first=Rap |last=News|date=January 25, 2020}}</ref> At the behest of Combs, the Warlox later changed their name to the L.O.X. After signing with Bad Boy, the Lox started gaining a bigger buzz off the strength of their first single "Well, Well, Well" featuring Kasino, which appeared on DJ Clue's 1996 mixtape ''Show Me the Money''.

===Mainstream success (1997–2000)===
The Lox gained national exposure in 1997 with an onside collaboration on [[Sean "Puffy" Combs]]' single "[[It's All About the Benjamins]]", shortly after gaining additional exposure with their multi-platinum tribute to [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] "We'll Always love Big Poppa".<ref name="Larkin90"/> The trio later appeared on a multitude of hits, [[Mase]]'s "[[24 Hrs. to Live]]", [[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]", and [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s "[[Jenny from the Block]]".<ref name="Larkin90"/> The group's debut album ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]'',<ref name="Larkin90"/> went Platinum by the RIAA.

In the summer of 1999, the trio found themselves disappointed with the direction of Bad Boy, and the trio wanted to be released from their contract in order to join [[Ruff Ryders]]. The Ruff Ryders had always served as The Lox's managers and the group felt like the new label could better represent the hard-core sensibilities which they expressed in their rhymes. Bad Boy was known for its radio friendly dance hits and high priced videos, while the Lox were quickly establishing themselves as [[hardcore rap]] artists. The identities clashed — "We just needed to be with a rougher label," said Sheek Louch. "A harder label that fit our image."{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The Lox tried all of the legal maneuvering available to be released from their contract with Bad Boy. However, the lawyers and conference calls did not work. At a New York rap concert, the trio sported "Let The LOX Go" T-shirts and sparked a grass roots movement to "Free The Lox." Pressure resultant from the campaign ultimately caused Bad Boy and Puff Daddy to release the trio from their contract. "We really changed the game by doing that," says Styles concerning the contractual drama. "It might take years from now, but other people are gonna do it. We made it so they don't have to be scared to speak up."{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

===Hiatus and resurgence (2001–present)===
During the years that followed, the group contemplated signing to other labels as a collective. All the while working on music, each member continued to record steadily releasing various solo studio albums.

A collaborative album with the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] was released in 2012 titled ''[[Wu Block]]'', bringing together two historic groups on an album. The end result was billed as a collaborative album between members Sheek Louch and the Wu-Tang Clan's [[Ghostface Killah]]. In June 2013, Jadakiss told [[XXL (magazine)|''XXL'' magazine]] that several labels, including Bad Boy and [[Maybach Music Group]], made offers to release the next Lox album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bristout |first=Ralph |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/2013/06/jadakiss-says-the-lox-might-get-an-offer-from-mmg/2/ |title=Jadakiss Says, "The LOX Might Get An Offer From MMG" - Page 2 of 2 - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=June 6, 2013 |access-date=April 3, 2014}}</ref>
