A '''wheel''' is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an [[axle]] [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]. The wheel is one of the key components of the [[wheel and axle]] which is one of the [[Simple machine|six simple machines]]. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a [[ship's wheel]], [[steering wheel]], [[potter's wheel]] and [[flywheel]].

Common examples are found in [[transport]] applications. A wheel greatly reduces [[friction]] by facilitating motion by [[rolling]] together with the use of [[Axle|axles]]. In order for wheels to rotate, a [[Moment (physics)|moment]] needs to be applied to the wheel about its axis, either by way of gravity or by the application of another external force or [[torque]]. Using the wheel, [[Sumer|Sumerians]] invented a contraption that spins clay as a potter shapes it into the desired object.

The invention of the solid wooden disk wheel falls into the late [[Neolithic]], and may be seen in conjunction with other technological advances that gave rise to the early [[Bronze Age]]. This implies the passage of several wheel-less millennia even after the [[Neolithic Revolution|invention of agriculture]] and of [[pottery]], during the [[Aceramic Neolithic]].

[[File:India - Kanchipuram - 023 - chariot unveiled for upcoming festival (2507526057).jpg|thumb|left|Solid wheels on a heavy [[temple car]], contrasted with the lighter [[wire-spoked wheel]]s of the black [[Roadster (bicycle)|roadster bicycle]] in the foreground]]
Early wheels were simple wooden disks with a hole for the axle. Some of the earliest wheels were made from horizontal slices of tree trunks. Because of the uneven structure of [[wood]], a wheel made from a horizontal slice of a tree trunk will tend to be inferior to one made from rounded pieces of longitudinal boards.

The [[spoke]]d wheel was invented more recently and allowed the construction of lighter and swifter vehicles. The earliest known examples of wooden spoked wheels are in the context of the [[Sintashta culture]], dating to c. 2000&nbsp;BCE ([[Krivoye Lake]]). Soon after this, horse cultures of the [[Caucasus]] region used horse-drawn spoked-wheel war [[chariots]] for the greater part of three centuries. They moved deep into the Greek peninsula where they joined with the existing Mediterranean peoples to give rise, eventually, to classical Greece after the breaking of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] dominance and consolidations led by pre-classical [[Sparta]] and [[Athens]]. [[Celt]]ic chariots introduced an [[iron]] rim around the wheel in the 1st millennium&nbsp;BCE.

In [[China]], wheel tracks dating to around 2200 BCE have been found at Pingliangtai, a site of the [[Longshan Culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kaogu.cssn.cn/ywb/news/new_discoveries_1/202001/t20200119_5081197.shtml|title=Central China discovers earliest wheel ruts|publisher=Xinhua|access-date=2020-01-20|archive-date=22 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822123815/http://kaogu.cssn.cn/ywb/news/new_discoveries_1/202001/t20200119_5081197.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> Similar tracks were also found at [[Yanshi]], a city of the [[Erlitou culture]], dating to around 1700 BCE. The earliest evidence of spoked wheels in [[China]] comes from [[Qinghai]], in the form of two wheel hubs from a site dated between 2000 and 1500 BCE.<ref>Barbieri-Low, Anthony (February 2000) "Wheeled Vehicles in the Chinese Bronze Age (c. 2000–741 B.C.E)", p. 11-12.

In Britain, a large wooden wheel, measuring about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, was uncovered at the [[Must Farm]] site in East Anglia in 2016. The specimen, dating from 1,100 to 800&nbsp;BCE, represents the most complete and earliest of its type found in Britain. The wheel's hub is also present. A horse's spine found nearby suggests the wheel may have been part of a horse-drawn cart. The wheel was found in a settlement built on stilts over wetland, indicating that the settlement had some sort of link to dry land.<ref name = BBCMF2016>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-35598578|title=Bronze Age wheel at 'British Pompeii' Must Farm an 'unprecedented find'|publisher=BBC|access-date=2016-02-18|archive-date=9 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109203927/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-35598578|url-status=live}}</ref>

The spoked wheel was in continued use without major modification until the 1870s, when [[wire-spoked wheel]]s and [[pneumatic tire]]s were invented.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/research/wheel-and-axle-woi/ bookrags.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527182437/http://www.bookrags.com/research/wheel-and-axle-woi/ |date=27 May 2008 }} – Wheel and axle</ref> Pneumatic tires can greatly reduce rolling resistance and improve comfort.  Wire spokes are under tension, not compression, making it possible for the wheel to be both stiff and light. Early radially-spoked wire wheels gave rise to tangentially-spoked wire wheels, which were widely used on cars into the late 20th century. Cast [[alloy wheels]] are now more commonly used; forged alloy wheels are used when weight is critical.

The invention of the wheel has also been important for [[technology]] in general, important applications including the [[water wheel]], the [[cogwheel]] (see also [[antikythera mechanism]]), the [[spinning wheel]], and the [[astrolabe]] or [[torquetum]]. More modern descendants of the wheel include the [[propeller]], the [[jet engine]], the [[flywheel]] ([[gyroscope]]) and the [[turbine]].

==Mechanics and function==
{{About|the application to transport|the simple machine|Wheel and axle|section=yes}}

A wheeled vehicle requires much less work to move than simply dragging the same weight. The low resistance to motion is explained by the fact that the [[friction|frictional work]] done is no longer at the surface that the vehicle is traversing, but in the [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. In the simplest and oldest case the bearing is just a round hole through which the axle passes (a "[[plain bearing]]").  Even with a plain bearing, the frictional work is greatly reduced because:
* The normal force at the sliding interface is same as with simple dragging.
* The sliding distance is reduced for a given distance of travel.
* The coefficient of friction at the interface is usually lower.

Example:
* If a 100&nbsp;kg object is dragged for 10 m along a surface with the [[coefficient of friction]] ''μ''&nbsp;= 0.5, the [[normal force]] is 981 [[Newton (unit)|N]] and the [[Mechanical work|work]] done (required [[energy]]) is (work=force x distance) 981 × 0.5 × 10&nbsp;= 4905 [[joule]]s.
* Now give the object 4 wheels. The normal force between the 4 wheels and axles is the same (in total) 981 N. Assume, for wood, ''μ''&nbsp;= 0.25, and say the wheel [[diameter]] is 1000&nbsp;mm and axle diameter is 50&nbsp;mm. So while the object still moves 10 m the sliding frictional surfaces only slide over each other a distance of 0.5 m. The work done is 981 × 0.25 × 0.5&nbsp;= 123 joules; the work done has reduced to 1/40 of that of dragging.

Additional energy is lost from the wheel-to-road interface. This is termed [[rolling resistance]] which is predominantly a deformation loss. It depends on the nature of the ground, of the material of the wheel, its inflation in the case of a tire, the net torque exerted by the eventual engine, and many other factors.

A wheel can also offer advantages in traversing irregular surfaces if the wheel radius is sufficiently large compared to the irregularities.

The wheel alone is not a machine, but when attached to an [[axle]] in conjunction with bearing, it forms the [[wheel and axle]], one of the [[simple machine]]s. A driven wheel is an example of a wheel and axle. Wheels pre-date driven wheels by about 6000 years, themselves an evolution of using round logs as rollers to move a heavy load—a practice going back in pre-history so far that it has not been dated.

=== Rim ===
{{main|Rim (wheel)}}
[[File:AluminumWheel spoke design.jpg|right|thumb|An [[aluminium]] [[alloy wheel]]]]
The '''rim''' is the "outer edge of a wheel, holding the tire".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUE0bazkcxAC&pg=PA722 |title=The Pocket Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus |first=Elizabeth |last=Jewel |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-530715-3 |page=722 |access-date=2012-01-04 |archive-date=4 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504123938/https://books.google.com/books?id=fUE0bazkcxAC&pg=PA722 |url-status=live }}</ref> It makes up the outer circular design of the wheel on which the inside edge of the [[tire]] is mounted on vehicles such as [[automobile]]s. For example, on a [[bicycle wheel]] the [[rim (wheel)|rim]] is a large hoop attached to the outer ends of the spokes of the wheel that holds the tire and tube.

In the 1st millennium&nbsp;BCE an [[iron]] rim was introduced around the wooden wheels of [[chariot]]s.

===Hub===
The hub is the center of the wheel, and typically houses a [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]], and is where the spokes meet.

A [[hubless wheel]] (also known as a rim-rider or centerless wheel) is a type of wheel with no center [[wikt:hub|hub]]. More specifically, the hub is actually almost as big as the wheel itself. The [[axle]] is hollow, following the wheel at very close [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]].

=== Spokes ===
{{main|spoke}}
[[File:Wheel Iran.jpg|thumb|A spoked wheel on display at The [[National Museum of Iran]], in [[Tehran]]. The wheel is dated to the late 2nd millennium&nbsp;BCE and was excavated at [[Choqa Zanbil]].]]

A ''spoke'' is one of some number of rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the [[Bicycle hub|hub]] where the [[axle]] connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface. The term originally referred to portions of a log which had been split lengthwise into four or six sections. The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape. A [[spokeshave]] is a [[tool]] originally developed for this purpose. Eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the [[wheelwright]]'s work, than to the materials used.

====Wire====
{{main|wire wheel}}
The [[Rim (wheel)|rims]] of ''wire wheels'' (or "wire spoked wheels") are connected to their hubs by wire [[spoke]]s. Although these [[wire]]s are generally stiffer than a typical [[wire rope]], they function mechanically the same as [[tension (physics)|tensioned]] flexible wires, keeping the rim true while supporting applied loads.

Wire wheels are used on most [[bicycle]]s and still used on many [[motorcycles]]. They were invented by aeronautical engineer [[George Cayley]] and first used in bicycles by [[James Starley]]. A process of assembling wire wheels is described as [[wheelbuilding]].

===Tire/Tyre===
{{main|tire|motorcycle tire|bicycle tire}}
[[File:Car tires.jpg|thumb|left|Stacked and standing car tires]]

A '''tire''' (in [[American English]] and [[Canadian English]]) or '''tyre''' (in some [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth Nations]] such as UK, [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]) is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel [[Rim (wheel)|rim]] to protect it and enable better vehicle performance by providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock while keeping the wheel in close contact with the ground. The word itself may be derived from the word "tie", which refers to the outer steel ring part of a wooden cart wheel that ties the wood segments together (see [[#Etymology|Etymology]] above).

The fundamental materials of modern tires are [[synthetic rubber]], [[natural rubber]], fabric, and wire, along with other compound chemicals. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] while the body ensures support. Before rubber was invented, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Today, the vast majority of tires are [[pneumatic]] [[inflatable structure]]s, comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion. Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, such as [[car]]s, [[bicycle]]s, [[motorcycles]], [[truck]]s, [[Heavy equipment (construction)|earthmovers]], and [[aircraft]].

===Protruding or covering attachments===
Extreme [[Off-roading|off-road]] conditions have resulted in the invention of several types of wheel cover, which may be constructed as removable attachments or as permanent covers. Wheels like this are no longer necessarily round, or have panels that make the ground-contact area flat.

Examples:
*[[Snow chains]] - Specially designed chain assemblies that wrap around the tire to provide increased grip, designed for deep snow.<ref>[https://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=?p=snow+chains Examples of snow chains]</ref>
*[[Dreadnaught wheel]] - A type of permanently attached hinged panels for general extreme off-road use. These are not connected directly to the wheels, but to each other.
*[[Pedrail wheel]] - A system of rails that holds panels that hold the vehicle. These do not necessarily have to be built as a circle (wheel) and are thus also a form of [[Continuous track]].
*A version of the above examples (name unknown to the writer) was commonly used on heavy [[artillery]] during [[World War I]]. Specific examples: [[Cannone da 149/35 A]] and the [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Bertha]]. These were panels that were connected to each other by multiple hinges and could be installed over a contemporary wheel.
*[[Continuous track]] - A system of linked and hinged chains/panels that cover multiple wheels in a way that allows the vehicles mass to be distributed across the space between wheels that are positioned in front of / behind other wheels.
*"Tire totes" - A bag designed to cover a tire to improve traction in deep snow.<ref>[https://tires.tirerack.com/tires/Tote Examples of "tire totes"]</ref><ref>[https://shop.tesla.com/product/tire-tote Another example of "tire totes"]</ref>

==Alternatives==
While wheels are very widely used for ground transport, there are alternatives, some of which are suitable for terrain where wheels are ineffective. Alternative methods for ground transport without wheels include:
{{div col}}
*[[Maglev]]
*[[Sled]] or [[travois]]
*[[Hovercraft]]
*A [[Walker (machine)|walking machine]]
*[[Continuous track|Caterpillar tracks]] (operated by wheels)
*[[Pedrail]] wheels, using aspects of both wheel and caterpillar track
*[[Sphere]]s, as used by [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]] vacuum cleaners and [[hamster ball]]s
*[[Screw-propelled vehicle]]
{{div col end}}

==Symbolism==
The wheel has also become a strong cultural and spiritual metaphor for a cycle or regular repetition (see [[chakra]], [[reincarnation]], [[Yin and yang|Yin and Yang]] among others). As such and because of the difficult terrain, wheeled vehicles were forbidden in [[history of Tibet|old Tibet]]. The wheel in ancient [[China]] is seen as a symbol of health and strength and utilized by some villages as a tool to predict future health and success. The [[diameter]] of the wheel is indicator of one's future health.

The [[winged wheel]] is a symbol of progress, seen in many contexts including the [[coat of arms of Panama]], the logo of the [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] and the [[State Railway of Thailand]]. The wheel is also the prominent figure on the [[flag of India]]. The wheel in this case represents law ([[dharma]]). It also appears in the [[flag of the Romani people]], hinting to their nomadic history and their Indian origins.

The introduction of spoked ([[chariot]]) wheels in the Middle Bronze Age appears to have carried somewhat of a prestige. The [[sun cross]] appears to have a significance in [[Bronze Age religion (disambiguation)|Bronze Age religion]], replacing the earlier concept of a [[Solar barge|solar barge]] with the more 'modern' and technologically advanced [[solar chariot]]. The wheel was also a solar symbol for the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Adelaide S.|title=A Glossary of Important Symbols in Their Hebrew: Pagan and Christian Forms|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59605-593-3|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OxcOmjiAWXAC|access-date=17 October 2015|archive-date=8 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508012358/https://books.google.com/books?id=OxcOmjiAWXAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>{{clear}}

In modern usage, the 'invention of the wheel' can be considered as a symbol of one of the first technologies of early civilisation, alongside farming and metalwork, and thus be used as a benchmark to grade the level of societal progress.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}
