'''K3''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]]-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] girl group with a Dutch-language repertoire primarily enjoyed by pre-and adolescent children. Formed in 1998 by [[:nl:Niels William|Niels William]], the musical formation has dealt with four line-up changes ever since, with the original members being [[Karen Damen]], [[Kristel Verbeke]] and [[Kathleen Aerts]]. The group's name is derived from first letters of the three original members. The current line-up is composed of [[Hanne Verbruggen]], [[Marthe De Pillecyn]] and [[Julia Boschman]]. Their signature style and iconocity relies in all three girls mostly wearing the same outfit, and in the fact that each girl's hair represents one color the [[Flag of Belgium|Belgian flag]]. Throughout their career, K3 has built a space within Dutch and Belgian [[pop culture]], especially in the [[2000s]] and [[2010s]] decade.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-02-01|title=K3: Ready to shine|url=https://www.discoverbenelux.com/k3/|access-date=2021-10-14|website=Discover Benelux|language=en-GB}}</ref>

The rise to fame of K3 began with their running to represent [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belgium]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Eurovision Song Contest]] with the single "Heyah Mama", eventually losing to [[Vanessa Chinitor]]'s "[[Like the Wind (song)|Like the Wind]]". Despite receiving mixed reviews from the judges, the song peaked at two in Belgium (Ultratop 50 Singles) and at eighteen in The Netherlands. It was included in the debut album ''[[Parels]]'' (1999), with also met great commercial success in both countries. The band's rise to fame surprisingly came without any airplay from the regular music television channels like [[MTV]] and are directed towards kids and chose to market itself directly to children via cartoon television channels.<ref name="volkskrant2001" /> The group later signed with [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] and released the albums ''[[Alle kleuren|Alle Kleuren]]'' (2000) and ''[[Tele-Romeo]]'' (2001).

In 2002, K3 departed ways with BMG and signed family entertainment production company [[Studio 100]], opting for a more children-orientated direction. From 2002 to 2009 K3 recorded [[K3 discography|six more albums]], all of them peaking at number one both in the Netherlands and Belgium, had their own children's television series called [[De Wereld van K3|''De Wereld Van K3'']] (2003–13), toured the [[Benelux]] eleven times with a total attendance of 1,7 milion, and had starred in three cinema movies: ''[[K3 en het Magische Medaillon]]'' (2004), ''[[K3 en het ijsprinsesje|K3 en het Ijsprinsesje]]'' (2006) and ''[[K3 en de Kattenprins]]'' (2007) that generated a $9,1 milion revenue. Despite the outstanding success of the group, Kathleen Aerts stepped out of the formation in March 2009. She was replaced by [[Josje Huisman]] later that year after winning audition reality show ''K2 Zoekt K3''.

The first single with Huisman as part of the group, "[[MaMaSé! (song)|MaMaSé!]]", became a smash hit, peaking at number one for six consecutive weeks in The Netherlands and for seven weeks in Belgium. It listed in the top three of both countries' year-end charts. The [[MaMaSé!|album of the same name]] entered the year-end album chart in both countries in 2009, 2010 and 2011. With Huisman, K3 recorded [[K3 discography|five more albums]], produced and starred in the first [[3D film|3D]]-musical in the world, based in [[Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carrol]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', taped two more movies: ''[[K3 Bengeltjes]]'' (2012), which became the group's highest-grossing film with a $5,1 milion revenue, and ''[[K3 Dierenhotel]]'' (2014), and had their own sitcom series ''Kallo K3!'' (2011–12), which lasted three seasons, and ''[[K3 Kan Het!]]'' (2015).<ref>{{Cite web|title=K3 Bengeltjes|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2260720/|access-date=2021-10-14|website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref>

On March 18, 2015, Damen, Verbeke and Huisman announced through a press conference that they were all leaving the group stating "since we started, we knew there would be a time which we would feel that it was the accurate moment to stop; well, that moment is now present". A second audition television show, ''K3 Zoekt K3'', premiered in autumn to find the new K3 members. [[Hanne Verbruggen]], [[Marthe De Pillecyn]] and [[Klaasje Meijer]] won the contest. Their first release, "[[10.000 luchtballonnen|10.000 Luchtballonnen]]" topped the charts in Belgium and The Netherlands. From 2015 to 2021, the group released six albums, starred in two more films: ''K3 Love Cruise'' (2017) and ''K3 Dans van de Farao'' (2020), had their own animated series ''De Avonturen van K3'' (2016) and became television judges on seasons four and five of the [[The Voice Kids (Belgian TV series)|Flemish version]] of ''[[The Voice Kids]].''<ref>{{Cite web|title='The Voice Kids' gaat van start met K3 als Jurylid!|url=https://studio100.com/be/nl/algemeen/nieuws/the-voice-kids-gaat-van-start-met-k3-als-jurylid|access-date=2021-10-14|website=studio100.com}}</ref> In 2021, Meijer left the group and was later replaced with Julia Boschman.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-02-19|title=Everyone asks if I don't like K3 anymore|url=https://netherlandsnewslive.com/everyone-asks-if-i-dont-like-k3-anymore/92970/|access-date=2021-10-14|website=Netherlands News Live|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Rise to fame (1998–2002) ===
The band K3 was started by Niels William. Initially, their intention was to be the Flemish version of the British all-female group "Spice Girls." Following the same formula K3 was composed of all females in their twenties, and like the Spice Girls, women in their twenties as their target audience. The original target is noticeable in their early song lyrics including their first single, "Wat ik wil" (What I want). This release was not very successful.

In 1999, K3 participated in live television shows that selected the Belgian entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with their song "Heyah Mama". The song was not well received by one of the judges, Marcel Vanthilt, who referred to the band members as "assorted meat products".
Notwithstanding, "Heyah Mama" was released as a single and became the first big hit for the band, staying at the number two spot of the Flemish Ultratop 50 chart, charting 25 weeks.
Their next two singles also earned the number one spot on the charts, resulting in an uninterrupted period of 32 weeks of K3 in the number one spot. About a year after becoming famous in [[Flanders]], K3 also became famous in the [[Netherlands]].

Their songs are written by Miguel Wiels, Alain Vande Putte and Peter Gillis. This trio previously collaborated as songwriters for Flemish singer Isabelle A.

K3 is noted for being the first pop act to break through to the top of the charts without receiving any airplay from the regular music television channels, such as [[MTV]] and [[The Music Factory|TMF]]. Niels William's new marketing concept was based on promotion via children and cartoon channels such as [[Jetix|Fox Kids]].<ref name="volkskrant2001">

=== Joining Studio 100 (2002–09) ===
In 2002, Niels William sold the band to [[Studio 100]], a Flemish television production company for Dutch and Belgian children's programs.

Songs like "Heyah Mama", "I love you baby", "Alle Kleuren" (All colours), "Blub, ik ben een vis!" (Blub, I'm a fish!), "Tele-Romeo", "Toveren" (Magic), "Verliefd"  (In love), "De 3 biggetjes" (The Three Little Piglets), "Oya lélé", "Hart verloren" (Lost heart), "Liefdeskapitein" (Captain of Love), "Kuma He", "Ya Ya Yippee", "Dokter Dokter" (Doctor doctor) and "Kusjesdag" (Kisses Day) were hits for the band. K3 has released nine albums. Their eighth album ''Ya Ya Yippee'' sold more than 50,000 copies in pre-sales within the [[Benelux]]. The ninth album, ''Kusjes'' (Kisses), sold 20,000.

K3 has a children's television program called ''De wereld van K3'' (K3's World). Originally, there were Dutch and Flemish versions, but only the Dutch version remains.

The band has released several [[DVD]]'s with video clips, musicals, films and with specially recorded footage like ''K3 in de Ardennen'' (K3 in the [[Ardennes]]).

In 2007, a team from [[Madame Tussauds]] in [[London]] took measurements of the band members for [[Wax sculpture|wax statues]].<ref>

On 10 May 2008, the band celebrated their 10-year anniversary with a new show ''10 jaar K3'' (10 years of K3). It was also celebrated in ''Plopsaland'', a popular theme park for kids. They opened the K3 museum, in which there is an overview of their career. The museum's pieces include show outfits, interviews, and props from the movies, like the flying scooters from  ''K3 en het magische medaillon'' (K3 and the magic medallion), and their numerous gold and platinum records.

=== Line-up change (2009–10) ===
On Monday, March 23, 2009, Kathleen announced her departure at a press conference. ''"It was a tough decision, after all, I gave the best years of my life to K3. People change and life is constantly in motion; I'm 30 now and after ten years it's time to move on"''. She made her last two appearances with K3 in June at a Studio 100 showcase at the Rotterdam Ahoy. Karen and Kristel then searched for a replacement on television.<ref>

Belgian news program De Rode Loper reported that two celebrities were auditioning for the vacant spot but this turned out to be an April Fool's joke. Meanwhile, Kathleen has signed up for UNICEF ambassadorship and appears to have quit singing altogether, aside from small TV appearances such as: contestant on the Belgian edition of [[The Masked Singer (Belgian TV series)|Masked Singer]].

The two remaining members of K3 kept searching for a new member through a talent show called 'K2 zoekt K3' ('K2 searching for K3'). In the final episode, the Dutch [[Josje Huisman]] was chosen as the newest member of K3.

=== Further success (2010–14) ===
In 2010, K3 shot new episodes for their kids-talkshow (this time with Josje) and also started their own sitcom called "Hello K3", in which they portray fictional versions of themselves living in the same building and trying to balance a normal life with being superstars. This creates comic situations reminiscent of the television series ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' and also ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]''. The first season of sitcom aired on television in fall 2010. A new single with the same name was also released on 15 September, on the album ''Eyo!''. Their sitcom was also renewed for a second season which premiered in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] in September 2011. In 2012 they released their album ''Engeltjes'' (little angels) accompanied by their fourth movie ''K3 Bengeltjes''. In 2013, they released their album ''Loko Le'' and their fifth movie ''K3 Dierenhotel'' (K3 Animalhotel).

In 2014 they also started a new unscripted TV-show, 'K3 kan het!' (K3 can do it!'), in which they travel through Belgium and the Netherlands to help children fulfill their dreams.

=== The new K3 (2015–2021) ===
On March 18, 2015, it was announced that all current members were leaving the group. K3's label has announced that they'll look for new members in late 2015.<ref>{{cite news

On February 5, 2020, My3 girls announced the end of the band's activities on May 1. Until then, the farewell tour of "Przyjaciółki na zawsze (Friends forever)" and a lot of surprises and memories on social media and YouTube will take place. A rather unexpected decision on the part of the girls to dissolve the band caused sadness and quite a stir in the comments under the farewell material posted by the trio of vocalists. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the "Przyjaciółki na zawsze" concert tour was postponed to September, as a result of which the band will be functioning until October 1, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63k2-tipzqc |title=Ĺťegnamy Siä˜ Juĺť W Kwietniu! |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2020-02-05 |access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = Koncerty My3 "Przyjaciółki na zawsze" przełożone na wrzesień 2020 r.| language = pl| publisher = My3| date = 2020-04-04| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGjdjDo9a2o| access-date = 2020-04-04}}</ref>
