Arcángel went on to release his debut studio album, ''[[El Fenómeno]]'', in late 2008. The album included songs that were produced in 2008, as well as the [[DJ Nelson]] produced "[[Chica Virtual]]", which was produced in 2007. Half of the album also included newly produced tracks, ones including "[[Pa' Que la Pases Bien]]" and "[[Por Amar a Ciegas]]", which went on to become successful airplay songs on American Latin Urban radio stations across the United States.

== Early life ==
Arcangel was born in New York City to [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] parents. He grew up in [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico]]. His mother, Carmen Rosa, was a former member of the all-women [[merengue (music)|merengue]] group, [[Las Chicas del Can]], who were popular during the mid 1980s to the early 1990s.<ref name="people">{{cite news|last=Martínez Tutek |first=Andrés |title=Arcángel: el irreverente del reggaetón |url=http://www.peopleenespanol.com/pespanol/articles/0,22490,1883211,00.html |work=[[People en Español]] |publisher=Time Inc. |language=es |date=March 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310062521/http://www.peopleenespanol.com/pespanol/articles/0%2C22490%2C1883211%2C00.html |archive-date=March 10, 2009 |access-date=April 20, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Arcangel grew up listening to various types of music and has been a fan of [[rock music]], particularly [[Robi Draco Rosa]], a Puerto Rican [[pop rock]] artist and a former member of [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]].<ref name="laopinion" /> Arcángel was not always a fan of reggaeton; he claims that it is not his favorite type of music, but it is easy to sing to.<ref name="bbespanol1" /> During the early 2000s, Arcángel grew fond of the new kind of music. Listening to artists like [[Tego Calderón]] and [[Tempo (rapper)|Tempo]], it inspired him to pursue a singing and rapping career in Puerto Rico.

== Music career ==

=== 2004–2007: Career beginnings with De La Ghetto ===
{{Main|Arcángel & De La Ghetto}}
After returning to Puerto Rico in 2002, Arcángel had decided to follow in the footsteps of the upbringing of [[reggaeton]] music.<ref name="bbespanol1" /> He went on to form part of an underground reggaeton act, [[Arcángel & De La Ghetto]]. The duo was signed to reggaeton artist [[Zion & Lennox|Zion]]'s record label, Baby Records, a subsidiary of [[Universal Music Group]]. The duo were also involved with [[Machete Music]] in 2004 during the time that they were recording for reggaeton compilation albums. Arcángel & De La Ghetto rose to fame in 2006 on the reggaeton compilation album hosted by [[Héctor Delgado|Héctor "El Father"]], ''[[Sangre Nueva (album)|Sangre Nueva]]'', with their hit song, "Ven y Pegate".<ref name="allmusic">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p904663|pure_url=yes}} Arcángel Biography]. ''[[Allmusic]]'' (Macrovision Corporation). Retrieved on March 10, 2009</ref> They were also featured on the [[Luny Tunes]]-hosted compilation ''[[Mas Flow: Los Benjamins]]'' in 2006.<ref name="allmusic" />

Though an active musical duo, Arcángel & De La Ghetto never released a studio album since the formation of the duo. Any production they had been involved with only resulted in tracks and recordings being included on compilation albums or [[internet leak|leaked]] onto the Internet. This was due to a conflict with Baby Records because the company was not releasing any material by Arcángel & De La Ghetto onto an album of their own. Arcángel claimed to have even spent $150,000 on producing an album, which resulted in the label not releasing it to market. The tracks produced were said to have been leaked onto the Internet instead.<ref name="laopinion" /> Arcángel had then filed a lawsuit with Baby Records in 2007 for US$1,000,000 and eventually left the record company in December 2006, when he announced that he was embarking on a solo career and founding a label of his own.<ref name="laopinion" /><ref name="allmusic" />

=== 2008–present: Solo career and debut album ===
After the separation of the duo in early 2007, Arcángel went on to perform solo, working with various reggaeton producers and performers on compilation albums. Most notable of them was a compilation album produced in 2007, ''[[Flow la Discoteka 2]]'', which was produced by songwriter and record producer [[DJ Nelson]].<ref>[http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7375999/a/Flow+La+Discoteka+2.htm DJ Nelson Flow La Discoteka 2 CD]. ''CDUniverse.com''. Retrieved on April 12, 2009</ref> The album was an upbringing of different artists trying to rise to fame, one of those including Arcángel, who made a track titled "[[Chica Virtual]]", which went on to be one of his most recognizable songs, as well as being a popular airplay single on American Latin Urban radio stations, charting at number 9 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Latin Rhythm Airplay chart.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=arcángel|chart=Latin Rhythm Airplay}} Latin Rhythm Airplay]. ''Billboard'' (Nielsen Business Media, Inc.). Retrieved on March 8, 2009</ref> It also charted at number 22 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Latin Tracks]] chart.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2007-04-28/latin-songs Hot Latin Songs]. ''Billboard'' (Nielsen Business Media, Inc.). Retrieved on March 8, 2009.</ref>

Since the departure in early 2008, nevertheless, the decision to release the album was cancelled due to the album being leaked onto the Internet during spring 2008.<ref name="allmusic" /> The tracks were distributed through his official website and file sharing sites relating to reggaeton under the title ''La Maravilla''.<ref>[http://arcangellamaravilla.net/fenomeno/ ArcangelLaMaravilla.Net – Home]. Retrieved on April 12, 2009</ref> One of the internet leaks, a song titled "[[Pa' Que la Pases Bien]]", went on to be a popular airplay track on American Latin Urban radio stations across the United States. The unreleased album being leaked onto the internet resulted in making Arcángel more popular among reggaeton fans in the United States, as well as Puerto Rico.

Arcángel founded Flow Factory Inc. in 2008, and his mother became his manager afterward.<ref name="laopinion" /> He claimed that it was easier having his mother be his manager so that he would not have to pay 20 percent of money received from record sales to his record label and manager.<ref name="laopinion" /> He went on to release his debut album, ''[[El Fenómeno]]'', in late 2008.<ref name="allmusic" /> The album included songs that were produced in the last quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, including the DJ Nelson produced "[[Chica Virtual]]". Half of the album was tracks that he originally produced for an album that was to be released in the first quarter of 2008. The other half of the album also included newly produced tracks, ones including "[[Por Amar a Ciegas]]", which went on to become a successful airplay single on Latin urban radio stations across the United States.

In mid-January 2009, Arcángel announced plans of a European tour sometime during 2009, in promotion of his debut album, ''El Fenómeno'', and to receive more exposure across the world from reggaeton fans.<ref name="yahooefe">{{cite news|last=Mo |first=Zayra |title=Arcángel se prepara para conquistar Europa en el 2009 |url=http://espanol.news.yahoo.com/s/15012009/54/noticias-entretenimiento-arcangel-prepara-conquistar-europa.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105144304/http://espanol.news.yahoo.com/s/15012009/54/noticias-entretenimiento-arcangel-prepara-conquistar-europa.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 5, 2013 |work=EFE |publisher=Yahoo!

His Mixtape The Problem Child was released in April 2010 and now he is planning to make a new album called ''Sentimiento, Elegancia & Maldad''. His most recent mixtape Optimus A.R.C.A was released in October 2010.

On February 28, 2012, Pina Records issued a newsletter informing that Arcangel had signed with this record label company and became the latest addition to the Pina Records team called "La Formula". [[Pina Records]] is based in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and operates offices in Colombia and Venezuela. Together, they are currently working on releasing the next studio album "Sentimiento, Elegancia y Maldad".
