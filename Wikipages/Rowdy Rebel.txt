==Early life==
Marshall grew up in a neighborhood known as "the 90s" in Brooklyn's [[East Flatbush]] area.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bobby Shmurda & Rowdy Rebel Perform Hot N*gga* At KOD w/ Meek Mill|url=http://thesource.com/2014/07/05/bobby-shrumda-rowdy-rebel-performs-hot-ngga-at-kod-w-meek-mill/|access-date=October 8, 2014|publisher=The Source|date=July 5, 2014}}</ref> People in his neighborhood referred to him as "rowdy" as a child, which is the genesis for his stage name. Many members of [[GS9]] (including Shmurda) originated in the same East Flatbush locale. He is of Barbadian descent.

==Career==

Marshall achieved fame in 2014 with the rise of his GS9 cohort, [[Bobby Shmurda]].<ref name="Vice"/> He was signed to [[Epic Records]] in July 2014 just two weeks after Shmurda signed his deal with Epic.<ref name="Kollege2">{{cite news | title =Rowdy Rebel Celebrates Epic Records Deal| publisher = Kollege Kidd| date =July 31, 2014 | url =http://kollegekidd.com/news/rowdy-rebel-celebrates-epic-records-deal | access-date = October 7, 2014}}</ref> Marshall was featured on a remix of Shmurda's hit single "[[Hot Nigga]]" with big-name acts like [[Fabolous]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Chris Brown]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Yo Gotti]].<ref name="HIP"/> Marshall also released several singles, including "Computers"<ref name="MTV">{{cite news | last =Markman | first =Rob| title =Bobby Shmurda And Rowdy Rebel Target The Sh– Talkers On 'Computers'| publisher = MTV| date =August 12, 2014 | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/1896825/bobby-shmurda-rowdy-rebel-computers/ | access-date = October 7, 2014}}</ref> which was featured on GS9's ''Shmoney Shmurda (Shmixtape)''.<ref name="DatPiff">{{cite web |url=http://www.datpiff.com/GS9-Shmoney-Shmurda-ShMixtape.629528.html |title=GS9 Shmoney Shmurda (Shmixtape)  |website=Datpiff.com |publisher=[[DatPiff]] |access-date=October 7, 2014}}</ref> In October 2014, he released a single entitled "Beam Jawn" which did not include any features from the GS9 crew or other artists.<ref name="Jawn">{{cite news | last =Bartholomew | first =Julissa| title =New Music: @RowdyRebelGS9 "Beam Jawn"| publisher = The Trophy Life| date =October 5, 2014 | url =http://thetrophylife.net/new-music-rowdyrebelgs9-beam-jawn/ | access-date = October 7, 2014}}</ref>

Following his release from prison in December 2020, Rowdy was interviewed by ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' and revealed that he was planning on releasing music straight away, however his team convinced him to work more on a forthcoming full-length project, possibly titled ''Rowdy vs. Rebel''. He also stated that he is still signed to [[Epic Records]].<ref name="Speedy">{{cite web|url=https://amp.www.complex.com/music/2020/12/rowdy-rebel-360-with-speedy-morman-interview/|title=What We Learned From Rowdy Rebel's '360 With Speedy Morman' Interview|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|last=Cowen|first=Trace William|date=December 22, 2021|access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref>

==Legal issues==
On December 17, 2014, Marshall was arrested by the NYPD for conspiracy, attempted murder, attempted assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon. [[Bobby Shmurda]] and 13 others associated with GS9 were also arrested for various charges including drug dealing. Marshall pleaded not guilty to all charges. He pleaded guilty in exchange for a deal that sentenced him to 6–7 years in prison. Due to time served awaiting his trial, Marshall was given almost two years credit for time served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/09/bobby-shmurda-took-plea-deal-rowdy-rebel-serve-less-time/ |title=Bobby Shmurda Took Plea Deal So Rowdy Rebel Would Serve Less Prison Time - XXL |website=Xxlmag.com |access-date=April 15, 2020}}</ref> Rebel had a parole hearing scheduled for August 2020, which approved his release in December 2020.
