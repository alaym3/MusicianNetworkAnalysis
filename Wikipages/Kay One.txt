{{cquote|Some people are scared, that I become far too successful. 60 million clicks like fallen off the face of the earth  (...) You can remove the videos, but not me (...) The truth will come out soon. Everyone in Germany will find out what happened  (...)}}
The statement ends with the word "exguterjunge".<ref name="16bars.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.16bars.de/blog/3712/bushido-umfeld-laesst-weitere-kay-one-videos-sperren-update-2-neues-statement-von-kay-update-3-bushido-meldet-sich-zu-wort-update-4-kays-antwort/|title=16bars.de - Bushido Umfeld lässt weitere Kay One Videos sperren / Update 2: Neues Statement von Kay / Update 3: Bushido meldet sich zu Wort / Update 4: KayÂ´s Antwort|date=17 April 2012|publisher=|access-date=9 March 2015}}</ref>
