== History ==
Calcutta was formed by [[Adolfo Camarillo High School|highschool]] friends Prem Panicker, Grant Umeda (classically trained pianist and guitarist), Sameer Sharma (classically trained violinist and guitarist), and Jason Park in 1995. The original lineup for the band included Prem Panicker on the [[Drum kit|drums]], Grant Umeda on the [[guitar]] and [[piano]], Sameer Sharma on the guitar and [[Bass guitar|bass]], and Jason Park singing the lead vocals. The band's love of rock music, and their classical training set them apart from the other garage bands in the area.<ref name = "Wazee">[http://www.wazee.org/wmd/viewartist.php?ID=331 Modern Alternative Rock] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225802/http://www.wazee.org/wmd/viewartist.php?ID=331 |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''wazee.org''</ref> As interest in the band increased, they released their first album in 1998, self-titled ''Calcutta''. Following the release of their album, Calcutta received many requests to play at local venues such as the Ventura Theater, and Camarillo's Constitution Park.<ref name = "Wazee" />

Jason Park left the band in 1999 to follow a career in [[filmmaking]]. The remaining band-members teamed up with Mike Moshy and Nathan Villa to release their second album (''Far Away'') later that year, to a growing fanbase. After the release of their second album, the band received offers to play at [[Hollywood]] venues like [[The Roxy Theatre|The Roxy]]. During this time, the band's lineup changed to include Prem on the bass, Sameer and Grant both on the guitar, Nathan Villa on the lead vocals, and Matthew Villa on the drums.

After graduating from high school, Grant and Sameer decided to pursue engineering degrees at UCLA, while Prem decided to pursue a degree in political science at UCI. Nathan Villa went to CSUF to pursue a Communications major. The band was able to balance their musical career with their college life, and went on to win the [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] and [[University of California]]-sponsored UCLA Battle of the Bands, the [[UCLA Spring Sing]], the [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]] Battle of the Bands, and the [[Moorpark College]] Battle of the Bands.<ref name = "Wazee" /> Between recording sessions of their third release (''... and I remain unchanged''), Calcutta also performed with bands such as [[Sum 41]] and [[Yellowcard]].<ref name = "Wazee" /> They also toured on the 2002 and 2003 [[Warped Tour|Vans' Warped Tours]].<ref name = "Wazee" />

In 2003, Calcutta recorded, engineered, and released their fourth and latest full-length album ''The World Alone''. The album was a success and saw their fan base growing across the nation, following their inclusion as a featured artist on the ''[[ESPN NHL 2K5]]'' game soundtrack for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]], which included six songs from the album. Calcutta was a showcased artist at the Midwest Music Summit 2005 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] and is playing show cases in [[Los Angeles]] and Hollywood, as well as performing throughout the country. Calcutta recorded an acoustic session for [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment|Sony/BMG]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] which was released in early 2007 on Sony Connect's website. Calcutta also finished writing and recording new material for their latest album, ''Out of Daylight'', which has been released.<ref name="Myspace_Music">[http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=2280258 Calcutta on Myspace Music] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917164853/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=2280258# |date=2007-09-17 }}, ''myspace.com''</ref>
