The strikers are listed in the order of their death and re described them being "Ireland’s bravest men". The song ends with the call to "Fight on and make our homeland a nation once again". 

In 2014 the song entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 33, remaining in the chart for one week.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/bbc-angers-unionists-by-playing-top-40-terror-song-9132132.html | work=The Independent | title=BBC angers unionists by playing 'terror' song 'The Roll Of Honour' in Radio 1 Top 40 | date=16 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/roll-of-honour/ | title=Official Charts Company | date=22 February 2014}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In 2006, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] chief executive Peter Lawwell suggested that he was embarrassed by "offensive" chants in support of the Provisional IRA.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/4982304.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lawwell embarrassed by IRA songs | date=7 May 2006}}</ref>

Since the enactment of the [[Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012]], singing Roll of Honour at [[Scotland|Scottish]] football matches by some supporters of [[Celtic F.C.]] has led to arrests and convictions for singing "a song in support of a proscribed terrorist organisation".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-21446226 Celtic fan denies singing pro IRA songs at Dundee match] www.bbc.co.uk, 13 February 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/dundee/celtic-fan-banned-for-sectarian-singing-at-tannadice-1.132530 Celtic fan banned for sectarian singing at Tannadice] www.thecourier.co.uk, 19 September 2013</ref> However some prosecutions have resulted in acquittals with one [[sheriff]] stating "If they can proscribe a list of songs which people are banned from singing, they will find the courts are full and the football grounds are empty."<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-22097356 Crown considers appealing Celtic fan's not guilty verdict over Dundee disorder charge] www.bbc.co.uk, 11 April 2013</ref>

The [[Green Brigade]] group of Celtic fans believe that the 2012 Act is "a ridiculous piece of legislation" which has resulted in "expressions of Irish identity, culture and politics being deemed illegal" and highlighted the hypocrisy of the legislation at the Celtic game on 23 November 2013: while ‘Roll of Honour’ was being sung, banners were displayed containing the lyric from the [[Flower of Scotland|Scottish national anthem]]: ‘they fought and died for; their wee bit hill and glen’.<ref>[http://ultras-celtic.com/blog/?p=4059 Green Brigade Statement 27.11.13] ultras-celtic.com, 28 November 2013</ref>

In December 2013, seven members of the Green Brigade appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to the charge of having behaved in a way that "is likely or would be likely to incite public disorder" by singing the Roll of Honour at [[Celtic Park]], with trial set for June 2014.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-25418578 Celtic Green Brigade fans face trial over 'IRA song'] www.bbc.co.uk, 17 December 2013</ref>
