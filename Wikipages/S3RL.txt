'''Jole Richard Hughes''' (born 17 December 1981), better known by his [[stage name]] '''S3RL''' (pronounced "Serl"), is an Australian [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]] DJ, [[record producer]], singer and musician from [[Brisbane]].

==Career==
Hughes is a [[happy hardcore]] musician from Brisbane who performs as "S3RL" (or "DJ S3RL").<ref name="Zakiya">{{cite web | url = http://raverrafting.com/6-ways-the-dance-music-scene-has-changed-according-to-s3rl/2015/01/26/ | title = 6 Ways the Dance Music Scene Has Changed According to S3RL | author = Zakiya | work = RaverRafting | date = 26 January 2015 | accessdate = 13 January 2016 }}</ref> The stage name "S3RL" was based on a nickname his cousins gave him when he was little, which derived from his cousins calling him "arsehole". To avoid profanity, they began saying "arserl", and according to Hughes, the word stuck and became his stage name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esAh_4x2q5o|title=PLUR News Exclusive Interview With S3RL|date=3 April 2012|website=youtube.com|accessdate=6 June 2015}}</ref>

One of Hughes's most popular tracks is "Pretty Rave Girl" (2006),<ref name="Zakiya 2">{{cite web|url=http://raverrafting.com/7-throwback-s3rl-tunes-that-will-restore-faith-happy-hardcore/2014/11/24/|title=These 7 Throwback S3RL Tunes Will Restore Your Faith in Happy Hardcore|author=Zakiya|date=24 November 2014|work=RaverRafting|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref> which uses the melody from "[[Daddy DJ (song)|Daddy DJ]]" (November 1999) by the [[French people|French]] dance act [[Daddy DJ|of the same name]].<ref name="Daddy charts">{{cite web|url=http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?key=4738&cat=s|title='Daddy DJ', in various singles charts|publisher=Lescharts.com|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref> S3RL has contributed tracks for several UK hardcore [[compilation album|compilation series]], including the [[Bonkers (compilation album series)|''Bonkers'' series]]. Some of his other works are "Fantasy Land", "Raver Dimension", "Rainbow Girl", "Friendzoned", "Sek C Raver", "Little Kandi Raver", "Pika Girl", "Keep on Raving Baby", "the Bass and the Melody", "Dopamine", "You Are Mine", "Wont Let You Go", "Bass Slut", "Feel the Melody", "All That I Need" and "MTC" (also known as "Masturbate To Cartoons").

In October 2010, he appeared as a DJ at the inaugural Bam! Festival at Ivory's Rock in southeast [[Queensland]].<ref name="Bam! Fest">{{cite web|url=http://www.theaureview.com/guide/festivals/bam-festival-2010-ivorys-rock-qld.html|title=BAM!

Many of his songs reference different aspects of [[Japanese popular culture|Japanese pop culture]], such as [[anime]], [[manga]], [[hentai]], and [[video games]]. In 2011, he founded his own [[record label]], EMFA Music, through which all of his works are released. In May 2012, the label released "Press Play Walk Away" as a single by S3RL and SynthWulf, a fellow hardcore DJ.<ref name="Press PLay">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/press-play-walk-away-single/id524393560|title='Press Play Walk Away' – Single by S3RL & SynthWulf|date=10 May 2012|publisher=iTunes|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>

As of February 2015, S3RL was ranked 1658<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.djrankings.org/DJ-S3RL/|title=S3RL – Official Global DJ Rankings|website=dj-rankings.com|access-date=16 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819103019/http://dj-rankings.com/DJ-S3RL/|archive-date=19 August 2014}}</ref> on the "Official Global DJ Rankings" page dj-rankings.com, which bases its rankings on a number of factors include chart rankings, DJ fees and radio airplay. During mid-2015, his single "Genre Police" (featuring Lexi), which had been issued in Australia in November the previous year,<ref name="Zakiya 2"/> peaked at #10 on the [[VG-lista|Norwegian singles chart]].<ref name="NOR Genre">{{cite web|url=http://lista.vg.no/artist/s3rl-feat-lexi/singel/genre-police/6310|title=S3RL feat. Lexi / 'Genre Police'|publisher=[[VG-lista]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>

In early 2018, Hughes announced that his 2018 tour would be his last, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. Though he advertised it as being his final shows, he clarified that he might be willing to return to the stage after at least two years: "After 2018 I will not do any shows for at least a couple of years, then re-assess the situation to do the occasional show here and there.... For example, if I was booked for a show in 2020 that I could bring my family along to I would consider it, but during the two years off I will not be doing any shows at home or away." He also stated that his music production would be unaffected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edmidentity.com/2018/02/26/featured-interview-dj-s3rl/|title=DJ S3RL Discusses His Retirement From Touring, Happy Hardcore's Future, & More!|date=26 February 2018|website=edmidentity.com|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>

In February 2020, S3RL decides to hire contract partners to help him make his new music videos.  He notably recruits Aurélien Dacher, a French beatmaker, and they have since created: You Are Mine, Nasty, Dopamine, Wanna Fight Huh, The Bass & The Melody, and S3RL Absolutely Presents.

In May 2021, S3RL announced his new label, M4 Music, with the release of "Dance More (Atef Remix)" on 14 May 2021.<ref name="Dance More (Atef Remix)">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wp1VuCvqiI|title="Dance More (Atef Remix) – S3RL ft Ella"|date=14 May 2021|website=youtube.com|accessdate=22 May 2021}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Hughes lives in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] with his wife Jodie and their two sons.
