==InsideOut ministry==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}
The InsideOut ministry is the high school department of North Point Ministries. Thousands of high school students in the metro Atlanta area come to North Point's six locations every Sunday night including [[North Point Community Church]], [[Browns Bridge Church]], Gwinnett Church, [[Buckhead Church]], Decatur City Church, and Woodstock City Church. It is the largest high school ministry in the United States. Every Sunday, along with church music, students listen to their campuses' pastor, go to small group, and later eat dinner with their friends.
