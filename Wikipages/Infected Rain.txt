On 25 November 2011 the group released their first full-length album titled ''Asylum'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://brushvox.com/2011/11/infected-rain-asylum-2011 |title=Infected Rain now delivering their full-length debut album entitled "Asylum" |access-date=2017-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816151529/http://brushvox.com/2011/11/infected-rain-asylum-2011/ |archive-date=2017-08-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and then the band went on a tour in Romania.

Next year the band released the songs ''Serendipity'', ''Intoxicating'', ''Mold'', and ''Fool the Gravity''. On 20 April 2017 was released a new full-length album titled [[86 (term)|"86"]], as American English slang for getting rid of something, ejecting someone, or refusing service, which is also appeared to be the birth year of the lead vocalist Lena Sсissorhands (1986).

The music is composed mainly by the guitarist Vidick, with contributions from all other members. As a female frontman, Lena was noted for her tattoos and her strong vocals. She is coached by New York-based [[Melissa Cross]].<ref>[http://aradculture.ro/de-vorba-cu-lena-de-la-infected-rain/ De vorbă cu Lena de la Infected Rain] {{in lang|ro}}</ref> For her style, Lena was named by local media "the most eccentric vocalist of Moldova".<ref>[http://acasatv.perfecte.md/article/o-seara-perfecta/este-cea-mai-excentrica-solista-de-la-noi-cum-si-a-sarbatorit---223311.html Este cea mai excentrica solista de la noi!
