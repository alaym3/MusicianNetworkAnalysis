==Career==
Dardo began performing in drag as Violet Chachki at the age of 19. The name "Violet" was inspired by [[Jennifer Tilly]]'s character of the same name in the film ''[[Bound (1996 film)|Bound]]'', while "Chachki" is a variant of the Yiddish word ''[[tchotchke]]'', used to name a strictly decorative small collectible item or describe a beautiful young lady.<ref>{{cite web|title=Violet Chachki Interview|url=http://www.powderzine.com/node/277|website=Powderzine|access-date=May 31, 2015}}</ref> They first performed at the bar LeBuzz in [[Marietta, Georgia]]. Using a fake ID to perform in local drag shows, they eventually won Miss New Faces at Friends on Ponce in [[Atlanta]] and was adopted as a "drag daughter" by drag queens Dax Exclamationpoint (who competed on the [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''Drag Race'') and Genre Monster.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=June 13, 2017|title=Who Is Your Drag Mom? {{!}} The Kiki Show|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IllUcGe2NUk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Later, Chachki was enrolled at the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] at the Atlanta campus for fashion design, but dropped out to focus on doing drag. They became a regular cast member of The Other Show at the bar Jungle in Atlanta which gave them exposure locally and allowed them to perform with [[Alaska Thunderfuck 5000]], [[Amanda Lepore]], and [[Lady Bunny]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Terrell|first1=Matthew|title=Violet Chachki Never Stops Chasing the Neon Rainbow|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-terrell/violet-chachki-never-stop_b_5224258.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|access-date=May 31, 2015|date=April 28, 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, they were photographed for "Legendary Children". The project focused on Atlanta's drag scene and was exhibited at Gallery 1526. Two photos that featured their genitals and [[cache-sexe|gaff]]  were covered up after complaints. Later, the censorship controversy caught the attention of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Terrell|first1=Matthew|title=No Amount of Censorship Can Stop Atlanta's Drag Queens from Looking Fabulous|url=https://www.vice.com/read/atlanta-legendary-children-censorship|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=May 31, 2015|date=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Terrell|first1=Matthew|title=Legendary Children Censorship Reveals Discomfort With Drag Queens' Dicks|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-terrell/legendary-children-censorship_b_3999308.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|access-date=May 31, 2015|date=September 27, 2013}}</ref>
