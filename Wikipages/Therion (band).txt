'''Therion''' (formerly '''Blitzkrieg''' and '''Megatherion''') is a Swedish [[symphonic metal]] band founded by [[Christofer Johnsson]] in 1987. Its name was inspired by the [[Celtic Frost]] album ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]''. "To Mega Therion" is Greek for "The Great Beast" and was a title used by occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelemapedia.org/index.php/To_Mega_Therion |title=The Encyclopedia of Thelema & Magick {{!}} To Mega Therion |publisher=Thelemapedia |date=2005-12-01 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref><ref name="alternative-zine-interview">{{cite web |access-date=2007-07-25 |title=Interview with Christofer Johnsson |date=2004-05-03 |url=http://www.alternative-zine.com/interviews/en/6 |work=Alternative-Zine.com}}</ref> Originally a [[death metal]] band, Therion adjusted its musical style by adding orchestral elements, including [[choir]]s, [[European classical music|classical musicians]], and even a full orchestra at their concert performances. As a result, they are considered pioneers of the [[symphonic metal]] genre.

Therion takes its themes for the lyrics from different [[Mythology|mythologies]] and practices, including [[occult]]ism, [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and ancient traditions and writings.

==History==

===Blitzkrieg and Megatherion (1987–1988)===

Therion originated as the band Blitzkrieg in [[Upplands Väsby]], Sweden. In 1987, [[Christofer Johnsson]], who had played bass for three months, teamed up with guitarist [[Peter Hansson]], whom he had met in several musical groups, and drummer [[Oskar Forss]], who was Johnsson's old schoolmate. The band's main influences were [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]], but its sound resembled [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Motörhead]]. The band had only two concerts.<ref name="blitz" group="note">Although Blitzkrieg did not record any demos, some of its songs have been added to Therion's repertoire. There include "Rockn' Roll Jam" and "Scared to Death (Excerpt)", which are on ''[[Bells of Doom (album)|Bells of Doom]]'', and "Fight Fire with Fire", which is a cover of [[Metallica]]'s song.  The first Therion album ''[[Of Darkness...]]'', includes riffs from the Blitzkrieg-developed song "Morbid Reality".</ref><ref name="extended_discography">{{cite web |url=http://main.megatherion.com/Extended_Disco.xhtml |title=Extended discography|work=Megatherion - The official Therion website|access-date=2007-07-25 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314010013/http://main.megatherion.com/Extended_Disco.xhtml |archive-date = March 14, 2007}}</ref><ref name="chris_mail1" /><ref name="official_bio">{{cite web |url=http://therion.se/band/ |title=Therion biography |work=Megatherion - The official Therion website |access-date=2007-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927135703/http://therion.se/band/ |archive-date=27 September 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In March 1988, it split up after some disagreements with Forss.<ref name="chris_mail1">{{cite web |url=http://www.megatherion.com/forum/index.php/topic,573.msg84834.html#msg84834 |title=Interview with Christofer Johnsson: Questions about pre-Therion era and verifying album credits |access-date=2015-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206092452/http://www.megatherion.com/forum/index.php/topic%2C573.msg84834.html#msg84834 |archive-date=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1988, the band reformed with the moniker Megatherion, which was based on the album title ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]'' by the Swiss heavy metal band [[Celtic Frost]]. Johnsson has mentioned that ''therion'' is Greek for "beast" and likens it to [[Belphegor]].<ref name="alternative-zine-interview"/> Johnsson switched from bass to guitar and Peter Hansson played guitar. Johan Hansson (who would later form the Swedish death metal band Crematory) became its bassist, and Mika Tovalainen its drummer. After the band shortened its name to ''Therion'', Erik Gustafsson of [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]] replaced Johan Hansson as the bassist, and Oskar Forss returned and replaced Tovalainen as the drummer. [[Matti Kärki]], later to be the front man of [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]], also joined the band and took over the vocals. <ref name="MusicMight">{{cite web |url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/sweden/upplands+vasby/therion |title=Therion biography |access-date=2007-07-25 |work=MusicMight |date=2007-03-09 |last=Sharpe-Young |first=Garry |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504160853/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/sweden/upplands+vasby/therion |archive-date=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

{{see also|List of Therion demo albums}}
In 1989, Therion released two demos: ''[[Paroxysmal Holocaust]]''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://therion.se/discography/paroxysmal-holocaust | title=Paroxysmal Holocaust |work=Megatherion - The official Therion website| access-date=2015-08-29 }}</ref> and ''[[Beyond the Darkest Veils of Inner Wickedness]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://therion.se/discography/beyond-the-darkest-veils-of-inner-wickedness | title=Beyond the Darkest Veils of Inner Wickedness |work=Megatherion - The official Therion website|access-date=2015-08-29 }}</ref> Matti had left the band shortly after the first demo, so Christofer took over the vocals again. In 1990, the band worked with House of Kicks, a local record store, to print and release the ''[[Time Shall Tell]]'' demo on 12 inch vinyl.<ref name="MusicMight" /> The latest release enabled the band the sign a one-album record deal with [[Deaf Records]].

Therion's first full-length album, ''[[Of Darkness...]]'', released in 1991, featured songs that Johnsson had composed in the 1980s. The band called it "both a debut album and the end of an era", and described it as progressive [[death metal]], since it contained elements that did not quite fit the standards of death metal at the time. The lyrics were very political, in the vein of [[Napalm Death]] and other late-1980s [[hardcore punk]] bands.<ref name="official_bio"/>

Therion signed with [[Active Records]] for its second album, ''[[Beyond Sanctorum]]''. Prior to the recording sessions, Gustafsson left the band to return to the United States, so Therion continued as a trio with Hansson, Forss and Johnsson, the last of whom covered the bass.<ref name="official_bio"/> The album shows a more experimental edge to the death metal music; keyboard and clean vocals were used sparingly.

After the recording, Therion changed members again. Forss left the band, and Hansson had to quit for health issues. For the Central European gigs, Johnsson brought in drummer [[Piotr Wawrzeniuk]] from his other band [[Carbonized]], bassist [[Andreas Wahl]], and [[Magnus Barthelsson]] who was an old friend from school.<ref name="official_bio"/>

===Musical metamorphosis (1993–1996)===
In order to scale down operations, Active Records had stopped releasing new records and transferred the band to [[Megarock Records]]. They released ''[[Symphony Masses: Ho Drakon Ho Megas]]'' in 1993. Its style combined [[death metal]] and [[doom metal]], with elements of [[middle eastern music]], [[industrial music]], traditional 1980s [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[classical music]] and religious chanting. ''Symphony Masses'' sold about 10,000 copies, which was more than the band's first two albums, but hardly a financial success. As the band's touring gigs were not that profitable, Barthelsson and Wahl quit the band, and [[Fredrik Isaksson]] was brought in as the new bassist. After a hiatus where Johnsson worked as a vocalist for [[Messiah (band)|Messiah]], they received an offer to join metal label [[Nuclear Blast]]. Megarock Records, lacking the resources to properly promote the band, decided to release Therion without any strings attached. Therion signed with Nuclear Blast in 1994, and has remained with them since.<ref name="official_bio"/>

Therion's first album with Nuclear Blast was ''[[Lepaca Kliffoth]]'', with its single "[[The Beauty in Black]]" released in advance of the album. To Johnsson's surprise, "The Beauty in Black" sold 12,000 copies in Europe, before the company stopped printing.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The album experimented with more elements: "a classic soprano and bass-baritone, more keyboards, more Persian influences, more melodies". Johnsson had "a new style of singing" that severed their ties to death metal.<ref name="official_bio"/> The album sold around 15,000 copies over the following weeks.<ref name="sales" group="note">Current European sales estimates for ''Lepaca Kliffoth'' are around 35,000 copies.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://therion.se/discography/the-beauty-in-black-1995 |title=Beauty in Black {{!}} Megatherion – The official Therion website |publisher=Megatherion |access-date=2015-08-29}}</ref> Isaksson had some personal problems, and was eventually released from the band. Therion brought in bassist [[Lars Rosenberg]] from the death metal band [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]]. The band toured with [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]] in Germany, and also did a small headlining tour in Argentina and Chile.<ref name="official_bio"/>

In 1996, Therion recorded their experimental album, ''[[Theli (album)|Theli]]''. The album heavily featured the vocals of two choirs, as well as vocals from Johnsson, Wawrzeniuk and guest vocalist [[Dan Swanö]]. The album featured keyboards and classic samples, which was labeled the "Barmbek Symphony Orchestra" after the subway station next to the studio.<ref name="official_bio"/> Jason Ankeny of Allmusic noted that the album "was almost universally acclaimed as the apex of Therion's career to date, fully realizing Johnsson's taste for elaborate, operatic grandeur".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p41939|pure_url=yes}} |title=Therion biography |work=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=2007-07-29 |first=Jason |last=Ankeny }}</ref> In a month, the album sold 75,000, more than double that of ''Lepaca Kliffoth''.<ref name="MusicMight" />

Personal issues plagued the band's members. Jonas Mellberg, who had joined as a guitarist from [[Unanimated]], had severe alcohol problems, and walked out during the mixing and mastering sessions. Wawrzeniuk was busy with his studies, so Johnsson brought in more members for their tours, including [[Tommy Eriksson]] of [[Shadowseeds]]. Rosenberg's drinking problems got worse and he was fired from the band.<ref name="official_bio"/>

In 1997, Therion released ''[[A'arab Zaraq - Lucid Dreaming]]'', which contained unreleased songs from ''Theli'', some covers, and Johnsson's soundtrack that he produced for a short art movie called ''The Golden Embrace''.<ref name="official_bio"/>

Johnsson noted that the next album, ''[[Vovin (published musical recording)|Vovin]]'', was practically a solo album as it used studio musicians instead of the ones from the ''Theli'' tour, besides Eriksson, who provided some guitar support. ''Vovin'' was recorded at Woodhouse Studios; it involved a real string orchestra for the first time, and a "hand picked opera choir" which included Austrian singer Martina Hornbacher, and British vocalist [[Sarah Jezebel Deva]].<ref name="official_bio"/> The album was released in 1998, and in two months, sales had reached 150,000 in Europe alone,<ref name="MusicMight" /> doubling sales of ''Theli''.<ref name="official_bio"/>

The band toured with [[Moonspell]] and showcased Hornbacher and Deva on vocals. It brought in [[Sami Karppinen]] as the drummer, [[Kristian Niemann]] on guitar, and his brother [[Johan Niemann]] on bass. The album ''[[Crowning of Atlantis]]'', released in 1999, was a mini-album that was padded to full-length with covers and live tracks.<ref name="official_bio"/>

The band's next release, ''[[Deggial]]'', involved the participation of a full orchestra. Johnsson noted it was 90% another solo album, but with a more permanent band lineup. ''Deggial'' sold more copies than ''Theli'' but not as many as ''Vovin''.<ref name="official_bio"/>

Johnsson had written seven songs but shelved them in order to make a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] [[concept album]]. He built a recording studio for the band called "Modern Art".<ref name="official_bio" /> The band's tenth album, ''[[Secret of the Runes (album)|Secret of the Runes]]'', was released in 2001, and had themes from the nine worlds of [[Norse mythology]]. It included the cover songs of "Crying Days" ([[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]) and "[[Summer Night City]]" ([[ABBA]]), of which, [[Piotr Wawrzeniuk]] provided vocals. The album received positive reviews, and was an [[Allmusic]] editors' pick.<ref name="allmusic-sotr">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r558530|pure_url=yes}} |title=Secret of the Runes |work=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=2007-07-29}}</ref> Therion headlined tours in Europe and Latin America with [[Evergrey]] and My Insanity. Afterwards, Karppinen left the band to focus as a sound engineer for Modern Art, but brought in replacement drummer [[Richard Evensand]].<ref name="official_bio"/>

In 2001, Therion released the compilation album ''[[Bells of Doom (album)|Bells of Doom]]'' to its official fan club. It includes recordings from the Blitzkrieg days in 1987, demos from 1989 that did not appear on any album, and an unofficial promotional demo from 1994 that enabled the band to land the record deal with Nuclear Blast. The album was later sold through Therion's webstore.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Therion0136.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Live in Netherlands, 2004]]
After the ''Secret of the Runes'' tour, the band had amassed 55 unreleased songs which included the ones Johnsson had shelved as well as contributions from the Niemann brothers.<ref name="official_bio"/> Johnsson remarked that "we went through the songs and realized that we had enough good material for three albums. Recording one after the other, promoting, and touring each one separately would have taken several years and would have been a bad idea; and being so productive, we would have had another 55 songs waiting when we finally came to the end of it." In 2004, the band released 21 tracks on two albums: ''[[Lemuria (album)|Lemuria]]'' and ''[[Sirius B (album)|Sirius B]]''.<ref name="lemuria_release"/> The albums were released simultaneously and were available as separate albums or a twin-pack. 171 musicians participated, including the [[City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]] and a 32-member choir.<ref name="MusicMight"/> Contributing to lead vocals were [[Mats Levén]] and a returning [[Piotr Wawrzeniuk]].<ref name="lemuria_release">{{cite web

In July 2005, the band released ''[[Atlantis Lucid Dreaming]]'', which is a compilation of the 1997 tracks that were not part of ''The Golden Embrace'' soundtrack (not including its [[Iron Maiden]] cover of "Children of the Damned"), and seven tracks from its 1999 album ''[[Crowning of Atlantis]]''. It included a bonus live version of "Black Sun".<ref name="official_bio"/>

The band toured ''Lemuria / Sirius B'' over two years and 106 shows, with its final performance at the [[ProgPower UK|ProgPower Festival]] in [[Cheltenham]], UK on 21 March 2006.

Therion released their first DVD set, ''[[Celebrators of Becoming]]'', on May 2006. The set contains four DVDs which include concert footage from its 2004 visit to [[Mexico City]], documentaries of its 2004–2006 World Tour, Johnsson's art movie ''The Golden Embrace'', the band's music video singles, bootlegs and commentaries, and two audio CDs from its Mexico City concert.<ref name="official_bio"/>

In these times Therion held live shows that included local symphonic orchestras and choirs. The "Therion Goes Classic" show took place on 9 December 2006, in [[Bucharest]], Romania.  Another show followed at the [[Miskolc Opera Festival]] in [[Miskolc]], Hungary on 16 June 2007, with future band member [[Lori Lewis]] as its featured vocalist. The first half of the show featured orchestral pieces from [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvorak]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saens]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. The second half pulled from Therion's repertoire. The song "Clavicula Nox" was featured as a full orchestral version in the first half. The Bucharest concert was broadcast on Romanian television, and its first part was later released together with the entire Miskolc concert as the DVD/CD box set ''[[The Miskolc Experience]]'' in June 2009.

In November–December 2007, Therion had a 20-year anniversary tour with 16 shows in Europe. Songs included "Kali Yuga" parts 1 and 2, the entire ''[[Theli (album)|Theli]]'' album, and "Adulruna Rediviva". Part of the set list was determined by fan voting. Some songs were accompanied by keyboardist [[Ferdy Doernberg]] and a [[belly dancer]] on stage, and some of the shows featured also the ex-singers [[Piotr Wawrzeniuk]] and [[Mats Levén]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The Budapest gig of the tour was recorded, but it was released only in February 2014 as a part of the DVD ''Adulruna Rediviva And Beyond''.

On 14 February 2012, Therion announced it was recording a studio album and had planned a 25th Anniversary Tour.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/news/details/699861.therion-jubilaeums-tour-angekuendigt.html | title=Therion – Anniversary tour announced | work = Nuclear Blast | date = 14 February 2012  }}</ref> ''[[Les Fleurs du Mal (Therion album)|Les Fleurs du Mal]]'' was released on September 28.<ref name="bb">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=179407|title=THERION's 'Long-Term Plans' Revealed|date=14 September 2012|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]|access-date=30 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=84101| title = Therion Posts Cover For LP "Les Fleurs Du Mal" On Band's Official Website| work = Metalunderground.com}}</ref>  The album is considered by Johnsson to be an "art project", which includes not only the music, but also special inlay graphics and video clips <ref name="importantnews"/> - in 2015 partly released on a limited edition DVD called ''Garden Of Evil''. The album consisted of covers of French chansons and pop songs that were performed in the band's style.<ref name="fleurs_mu">{{cite web | url = http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=87059 | title = Therion Talks New Album "Les Fleurs Du Mal" And Upcoming Rock Opera Project | date = 8 December 2012

On 14 September, Johnsson posted a statement on the band's website about developing a rock metal opera, and that the band will not be doing any major tours or releasing studio albums.<ref name="importantnews">{{cite web|title=Important News| work = Megatherion - the official Therion website | last = Johnsson | first = Christofer | author-link = Christofer Johnsson |url=http://www.megatherion.com/en/news/343/important-news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224143633/http://www.megatherion.com/en/news/343/important-news|archive-date=2013-12-24}}</ref> According to this, in 2013 the band was to play only at three minor summer festivals in Europe.<ref name="festivals2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.megatherion.com/en/gigs |title=Tourdates {{!}} Megatherion - The official Therion website |publisher=Megatherion |access-date=2013-03-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118021907/http://www.megatherion.com/en/gigs |archive-date=18 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In April 2013 this statement was reconsidered by Johnsson itself, and the Rock Opera Unveiled Tour was scheduled for December 2013 with 15 European gigs, to test the fans' acceptance of the new material. The main framework of these shows included excerpts from the future rock opera, and the entire Vovin album due to its 15th anniversary.

On 21 February 2014 two new releases were put on market: a deluxe edition of ''[[Theli (album)|Theli]]'' - including three bonus tracks from [[A'arab Zaraq - Lucid Dreaming]] and a DVD with Theli's live performance - and a DVD set ''Adulruna Rediviva And Beyond'' with the 2007 Anniversary concert in Budapest and the 2011 Atlanta show.<ref name="releases2014">{{cite web | url=http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/news/details/3282460.70937.therion-ndash-ver-ouml-ffentlichen-raquo-theli-laquo-deluxe.html | title=Therion – release "Theli" Deluxe-Edition & new 3-DVD "Adulruna Redivia And Beyond" | work = Nuclear Blast | access-date=2014-01-10 }}</ref>

In 2014 the Rock Opera unveiled tour has continued with a Latin American leg, which has also meant - "due to family and work related reasons" - the last live performances of Lori Lewis. However, she has remained a band member for studio performances.<ref name="lorinottouring">{{cite web | url=http://therion.se/lori-withdraws-from-touring/ | title=Lori withdraws from touring | work = Therion | access-date=2014-05-10 }}</ref> The new touring singer has become Sandra Laureano, debuting on the Summer festival gigs and the tour for the first time in China and through entire Russia in October 2014. The Russian leg of this tour was made upon the invitation of their 2013 tour support band [[Arkona (band)|Arkona]], and drums were played by their former member Sami Karppinen, as Johan Koleberg was not able to tour with them.<ref name="karppinenontour">{{cite web | url=http://therion.se/sami-karppinen-will-temporary-join-the-band/ | title=Sami Karppinen will temporary join the band | work=Therion | access-date=2014-09-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102308/http://therion.se/sami-karppinen-will-temporary-join-the-band/ | archive-date=6 October 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref>
However, Sandra as a [[dramatic soprano]] did not suit for every song, so she was replaced first by [[Coloratura soprano|coloratura]] Isa García Navas,<ref name="isagarcianavas">{{cite web | title = Facebook post on 21 January 2015 | url=https://www.facebook.com/therion/posts/10152641164453603 | work = Therion | access-date=2015-01-22 }}</ref> and later Chiara Malvestiti to sing in the shows.

In 2015 Johnsson worked on another side project, called [[Luciferian Light Orchestra]] which features songs in the '70s occult rock style. An eponymous album was also released in that year, accompanied by on-stage appearances as support of Therion's 2015 Latin American and 2016 European tours, featuring Vidal and Påhlsson (both of them masked) on guitar. In addition to the last two tours, Therion had the very first acoustic gigs in Latin America and on 3 July 2016 in Bucharest.

CDs and DVDs related to the side projects were not released by Nuclear Blast, but by Johnsson's own label, Adulruna.

===''Beloved Antichrist'' (2017–2019)===

On 13 November 2016 the band announced that Johan Koleberg had decided to leave the band "due to different goals in playing music".<ref name="johankullbergquits">{{cite web | title = Facebook post on 13 November 2016 | url=https://www.facebook.com/therion/posts/10154075151673603:0 | work = Therion | access-date=2016-12-13 }}</ref> For the 2017 live gigs the former [[Amon Amarth]] member Fredrik Andersson filled in, then on 21 November 2017 Sami Karppinen officially re-joined.<ref name="karppinenrejoins">{{cite web | title = Facebook post on 13 November 2016 | url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.vontherion/posts/2021079064816363 | work = Therion | access-date=2017-12-22 }}</ref>

On 26 January, Johnsson revealed he had been suffering from intense pain in the neck and shoulders, and he was diagnosed with two spinal disc herniations (allegedly resulting from years of [[headbanging]]), and he was at risk of losing the ability to perform live.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.vontherion/photos/a.1574495632808044.1073741832.1541885729402368/1879642768959994/?type=3|title=Christofer Johnsson|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> As a result, the rock opera project was delayed and the band downplayed their sets of songs in concerts to allow Johnsson to perform. By 8 April, Johnsson announced he had been able to avoid surgery as his condition had improved through physiotherapy,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.vontherion/photos/a.1574495632808044.1073741832.1541885729402368/1915682998689304/|title=Christofer Johnsson|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> and the band would resume performing at festivals by August, although he would have to play sitting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.vontherion/photos/a.1574495632808044.1073741832.1541885729402368/1927762730814664/?type=3|title=Christofer Johnsson|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> (by the beginning of 2018, though, Johnsson was able to perform standing up normally again).

Johnsson also arranged the orchestration of [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]]'s stage show with symphonic orchestra, performed on 13 July 2017 at the [[Masters of Rock (festival)|Masters Of Rock]] festival in [[Vizovice]], Czech Republic.

On 15 August 2017, the band announced the title and the release date of an operatic rock musical. ''[[Beloved Antichrist]]'' -  inspired by and partly based on [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]]'s ''Tale of the Antichrist'' - containing over 3 hours of music, and 29 vocal characters is to be scheduled for 26 January 2018, later postponed first to 2 February and finally to 9 February.

In 2018 a European and a Latin American tour was scheduled, later also extended for China, and — for the very first time — Australia. The European tour has featured again [[Imperial Age (band)|Imperial Age]], whose current album ''Legacy Of Atlantis'' was made with Vidal, Påhlsson and Thomas Vikström. After the last show of the tour, Linnéa Vikström left the band and she was replaced by the new touring member Rosalía Sairem. Due to health issues of Chiara Malvestiti some of the 2019 gigs were done again by Isa Garcia Navas.

On 10 August 2019 Nalle Pahlsson has decided to withdraw from touring, and remain only a member for songwriting and studio recordings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://therion.se/nalle-is-withdrawing-from-touring/|title=Nalle is withdrawing from touring|last=Therion|date=2019-08-10|website=Therion.se|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref> For the year's only remaining show Justin Biggs from the band Sorcerer was standing in.

===The ''Leviathan'' trilogy (2020–)===

The first ''[[Leviathan (Therion album)|Leviathan]]'' album was released on 22 January 2021, partly with Snowy Shaw on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.vontherion/posts/2608411836083080|title=New album infos|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref> Its sequels ''Leviathan 2'' and ''Leviathan 3'' are scheduled for 2022 and 2023 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.vontherion/posts/252091072976860|title=Leviathan 2 and 3|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=24 January 2021}}</ref>

==Influences==
Therion draws its influences from several different bands. Its former name Megatherion comes from [[Celtic Frost]]'s 1985 album ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]''<ref name="alternative-zine-interview"/> and much of its music prior to ''[[Theli (album)|Theli]]'' was inspired by the 1987 album ''[[Into the Pandemonium]]''.<ref name="official_bio"/> For ''Theli'', the band drew from [[Pink Floyd]]'s album ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]'' and progressive rock group [[Klaatu (band)|Klaatu]]'s album ''[[Hope (Klaatu album)|Hope]]''.<ref name="official_bio"/>

From ''[[Vovin (album)|Vovin]]'' onwards, the band has drawn inspiration from classical composers like [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]], heavy metal acts from the 1980s like [[Iron Maiden]], 1970s hard rock bands such as [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], [[Judas Priest]], and "tons of progressive '70s bands that nobody knows anymore these days".<ref name="official_bio"/>

==Symbols==
[[File:Therion-Wacken-02-cropped.jpg|thumb|Therion performs at [[Wacken Open Air]] in 2007]]
The symbols on Therion's album covers originate from [[Magic (paranormal)|magick]], [[occult]], and [[Dragon Rouge]] themes. The most common symbol is an {11:5} [[hendecagram]], an eleven-pointed star. First appearing on the 1993 album ''[[Symphony Masses: Ho Drakon Ho Megas]]'', and every album since, it symbolizes the night side of the [[Qabalah]], and has also been called the Star of Seth or the Star of [[Qliphoth]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Johnsson admits that the symbol is important to his magick and lyrics.<ref>[http://hem.passagen.se/punish/therion.htm] {{Dead link|date=December 2008}}</ref>

Other symbols include:
* [[Pentagram|Pythagorean pentagram (one point down)]], on the dragon's head, for the cover of ''[[Symphony Masses: Ho Drakon Ho Megas]]''.
* [[Runic inscriptions|Nordic runes]] with [[Elder Futhark|Elder Fuþark]] alphabet, on the front cover and the booklet for the album ''[[Secret of the Runes (album)|Secret of the Runes]]''.
* [[Celtic cross]], on the booklet's page for "Helheim" on the album ''Secret of the Runes''.
* Clavicula Nox, a key symbol in Dragon Rouge and also the title of one of the band's tracks, on the covers of ''[[Crowning of Atlantis]]'', ''[[Vovin (published musical recording)|Vovin]]'' (inlay), and "[[Eye of Shiva]]".
* [[Mjölnir]], the Hammer of [[Thor]], on the inlay cover of ''Secret of the Runes''.
* The [[astronomical symbol]]s [[Venus symbol|Venus]] <big>(♀)</big>, [[astronomical symbols#Symbols for the Sun and Moon|moon]] <big>(☽)</big>, and [[astronomical symbols#Symbols for the Sun and Moon|sun]] <big>(☉)</big>, on the covers for ''[[The Early Chapters of Revelation]]'' box-set.
* The [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Kabbalistic Tree of Life]], seen on the ''[[Sitra Ahra (album)|Sitra Ahra]]'' album cover.
