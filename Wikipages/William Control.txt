'''William Control''' is an American [[electronic music]] project founded in 2008 in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  It was the side project of [[Aiden]]'s [[Wil Francis|William Francis]] before Aiden's hiatus, and he later operated as William Control full-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gothicbeauty.com/2015/07/dark-meets-domineering-an-interview-with-william-control/|title=Dark Meets Domineering, An Interview With William Control - Gothic Beauty Magazine|date=July 31, 2015|website=Gothicbeauty.com|access-date=August 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slugmag.com/music-features/a-brief-moment-with-william-control/|title=A Brief Moment with William Control|date=May 5, 2015|website=Slugmag.com|access-date=August 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://haulixdaily.com/post/91375623811/the-filth-and-the-fetish-a-conversation-with|title=The Filth and the Fetish: A Conversation With William Control|website=Haulixdaily.com|access-date=August 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rock-regeneration.co.uk/wordpress/2012/06/interview-wil-francis-of-aiden-and-william-control/|title=Rock Regeneration - Interview: Wil Francis of Aiden and William Control|website=Rock-regeneration.co.uk|access-date=August 3, 2017}}</ref>  'William Control' therefore refers to both the band as a whole and to Francis as his stage name.  Francis was signed to [[Victory Records]] before starting his own independent label, Control Records, and, as William Control, has released five full-length albums (''[[Hate Culture]]'', ''[[Noir (William Control album)|Noir]]'', ''[[Silentium Amoris]]'', ''[[The Neuromancer (album)|The Neuromancer]]'' and ''Revelations'' (split into four separate EPs)), an EP (''Novus Ordo Seclorum''), two acoustic albums (''Skeleton Strings'' and ''[[Skeleton Strings 2]]''), two live DVDs (''[[Live In London Town DVD|Live in London Town]]'' and ''[[Babylon (William Control DVD)|Babylon]]'') and a remix album (''[[Remix (William Control)|Remix]])''.

The album was completed by ''[[The White (William Control EP)|The White]]'' on November 24.  

As of ''The Neuromancer'' Francis referred to his band as 'The Neuromantic Boys', and the 'Boys' most recently consisted of Kenneth Fletcher (who has been a part of the William Control project since ''Hate Culture'') and Ian MacWilliams, with Crilly Ashes standing in for Fletcher for some of 2017's live shows.  Control announced his retirement from music/touring in October 2017, stating that he was going to concentrate on his clothing businesses and Control Records.<ref name="tic sadness">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisiscontrolrecords.com/news/sadness-in-west-texas/|title=Sadness In West Texas|website=Thisiscontrolrecords.com|access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref> In June 2018, Control temporarily ceased work due to accusations of sexual assault and the formation of a "sex cult" with women, some of whom were fans of his.<ref name=":1" />
