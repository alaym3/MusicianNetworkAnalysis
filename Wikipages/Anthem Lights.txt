==Beginnings==

Anthem Lights began as a solo project for vocalist Chad Graham in the fall of 2007.<ref name="New Release Tuesday">{{cite web |title=Anthem Lights Artist Profile - Biography And Discography - NewReleaseTuesday.com |url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/artistdetail.php?artist_id=3333 |publisher=newreleasetuesday.com |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> Both he and [[Alan Powell (actor)|Alan Powell]] were living in [[Los Angeles]], writing music for Graham's solo project. As the final vocal work was being installed, Powell and Graham came to a realization that the songs being written would be more appropriate performed as a group.<ref name="YouTube">{{cite web|title=YouTube - Meet Anthem Lights|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG71TiZFu04|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> It was then that Powell and Graham decided to alert their contacts at [[Liberty University]] in an effort to recruit members for what is now a singing group.<ref name="YouTube" /> Powell and Graham's contacts came to a consensus that Kyle Kupecky and Caleb Grimm would be the best candidates for the project. After receiving notifications by e-mail, Graham flew from Los Angeles to meet with Kupecky and Grimm, who gladly accepted membership. Powell joined the group at the last minute.<ref name="YouTube" />

The original name of the group was Yellow Cavalier.<ref name="Jesus Freak Hideout">{{cite web|title=Jesusfreakhideout.com: Anthem Lights Discography, Yellow Cavalier, Anthem Lights Artist Database|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/artists/AnthemLights.asp|publisher=jesusfreakhideout.com|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref> The group recorded one self-titled EP under this name in 2009. The EP was released independently on May 26, 2009. The group changed their name to Anthem Lights before any other projects were released.<ref name="Jesus Freak Hideout" />

== Name change ==

The group's name changed to Anthem Lights sometime after their independent release as Yellow Cavalier. Months later, the group signed to [[Reunion Records]]. Vocalist Kyle Kupecky comments about the meaning behind the name:<ref name="YouTube" />
{{Quote|These songs [and] this record is our anthem to the world saying, "Listen, we know there's a lot of darkness in this life, but in the end, light is gonna win." And we wanna be the light to people and just show them who the light of the world is.}}

On February 1, 2011, Anthem Lights released the ''[[Anthem Lights (EP)|Anthem Lights]]'' EP.
