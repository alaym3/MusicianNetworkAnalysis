'''The Birthday Massacre''' (abbreviated TBM) is a Canadian [[rock music|rock]] band, formed in 1999 in [[London, Ontario]], and currently based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. The current lineup consists of lead vocalist Sara 'Chibi' Taylor, rhythm guitarist Michael Rainbow, lead guitarist Michael Falcore, keyboardist Owen Mackinder, drummer Philip Elliott, and bassist [[A Primitive Evolution|Brett Carruthers]].

When the band formed in 1999, they were known as 'Imagica'. This name was inspired by the [[fantasy novel]] ''[[Imajica]]'' (1991) by [[Clive Barker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with The Birthday Massacre By DeathWish|url=http://www.vampirefreaks.com/content/comment.php?entry=315&t=Interview+with+the+Birthday+Massacre|publisher=Vampirefreaks.com|access-date=August 11, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, they changed the name to The Birthday Massacre after one of their earlier songs in order to avoid confusion with another group. The song ''The Birthday Massacre'' was then renamed ''Happy Birthday''. According to their vocalist Chibi: "it kind of works well for the music that we're making. Sort of contrasty, you know? Birthday, and massacre. Light, and dark. Cute, and evil".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2010/11/a_vampire_band_for_the_twiligh.php |title=The Birthday Massacre: A Vampire Band for the 'Twilight' Set - OC Weekly |access-date=January 1, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101001250/http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2010/11/a_vampire_band_for_the_twiligh.php |archive-date=January 1, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

After months of rehearsals and writing songs, they played their first gig on October 28, 2000, at Diversity night club in London.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metropolis Records Artist Page and Bio - The Birthday Massacre|url=http://www.metropolis-records.com/artist.php?id=19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509232324/http://www.metropolis-records.com/artist.php?id=19|archive-date=May 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band released a seven-song [[Special edition|limited-edition]] demo CD at the show which had been recorded on a [[Multitrack recording|four-track cassette recorder]] during a time when the group was recording [[cover songs]] for fun. There were 40 hand-numbered copies of the demo which included the first recorded version of the song ''The Birthday Massacre'' (later renamed ''Happy Birthday'').<ref>{{cite video| people  = Rainbow, Chibi| date = September 27, 2007| title = Birthday Massacre Interview with Noisescape TV 2007 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m346aXQMtA| format = FLV/SWF/Flash| medium = video | publisher = Leaf Pile TV (via [[YouTube]]) | time = 1:22}}</ref>

During this time, the band also met [[Rhim]], Owen and [[A Primitive Evolution|Brett Carruthers]] who all attended the same college. In October 2006, Terry McManus, Professor of Music Business and [[Entertainment Law]] at Fanshawe College, joined as the band's [[personal manager]].<ref>{{cite video| people = Owen, Chibi, Dan Gilman| date        = October 2, 2009| title = Leaf Pile TV Interviews The Birthday Massacre | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m346aXQMtA| format = FLV/SWF/Flash| medium = video | publisher = Leaf Pile TV (via [[YouTube]]) | time = 4:44}}</ref>

The band has always described itself as an [[audio-visual]] project. In a 2009 interview, when asked about why they had started the band, Rainbow stated: "I think more than just being a band, it's a way to sort of incorporate, not just music, but other things. So I think more so than just music, the idea of having a band, and being able to perform, and being able to do artwork, to do music... all these different avenues."<ref>{{cite video| people = Rainbow, Chibi| date = September 5, 2010| title = Chibi and Rainbow (The Birthday Massacre) - Gothicfestival.be - TasteitTV| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87vZUEaDgCU| format = FLV/SWF/Flash| medium = video | publisher = TasteitTV (via [[YouTube]]) | time = 1:46}}</ref> Neither Rainbow, Chibi nor Michael Falcore had been in any previous bands and said that the group formed naturally as a result of spending time together as friends.<ref>{{cite video| people = Rainbow, Chibi, Michael Falcore, Rhim, Owen, Aslan, Bruno Kramm | date = August 3, 2006| title = Birthday Massacre Interview - Bruno Kramm - 2006 Mera Luna| url = http://www.myspace.com/video/vid/1343861212| format  = FLV/SWF/Flash| medium = video | publisher = Schwarze (via [[Myspace]]) | time = 5:50}}</ref>

===''Nothing & Nowhere'' (2001–2003)===
In 2001, the band relocated to Toronto,<ref>{{cite video| people = Chibi, Rainbow, Eric Blair| date = August 1, 2008| title = The Birthday Massacre Talk with Eric Blair | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Sxr5q-Enk| format = FLV/SWF/Flash| medium = video | publisher = Eric Blair (via [[YouTube]])| time = 1:02}}</ref> and began recording a new album which they announced would be available in another limited edition of 500 to 1,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Imagica Announce New EP on May 31, 2002 on Nothingandnowhere.com|url=http://nothingandnowhere.com/|access-date= August 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020601014414/http://nothingandnowhere.com/|archive-date= June 1, 2002}}</ref>

Shortly before releasing the CD, the band changed their name from 'Imagica' to 'The Birthday Massacre' in order to avoid confusion with a California [[death metal]] band with the same name.<ref>{{cite video| people = Rainbow, Mike Falcore, Stinky| date = August 27, 2010| title = The Birthday Massacre Interview on Capital Chaos | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2pZTU2aXGE| format = FLV/SWF/Flash| medium = video | publisher = Capital Chaos (via [[YouTube]]) | time = 2:40}}</ref> The band chose the name because people were already familiar with the song of the same title.

In July 2002, the Birthday Massacre independently released a limited-edition CD entitled ''[[Nothing and Nowhere]]''. In 2003, Adm joined the band on live keyboards and O.E left to focus on his own band, Tepid Lust<ref>{{cite web|title=TBMchicago.com Biography of The Birthday Massacre|url=http://tbmchicago.com/band/bio.php|access-date=August 8, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916223535/http://tbmchicago.com/band/bio.php|archive-date=September 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> (later to become Isle of Dogs).<ref>{{cite web|title=Isle of Dogs - Myspace Profile|url=http://www.myspace.com/isleofdogsmusic|access-date= August 10, 2011}}</ref>

The band began playing more live shows in London, Toronto, [[Oshawa]] and [[Montreal]].<ref name="tbmchicago.com">{{cite web|title=TBM Chicago - Largest TBM website - Show Archive List|url=http://tbmchicago.com/news/shows.php?view=archive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823074858/http://www.tbmchicago.com/news/shows.php?view=archive|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-08-23}}</ref> Rhim was drumming for the band during these years, rotating between playing for fellow London band [[A Primitive Evolution|Aphasia]] but, on February 9, 2005, posted on his [[LiveJournal]] that he was a permanent member of The Birthday Massacre and that the band has his "110% unwavering, full-throttle, metronomic fabulousness... now 24-7."<ref>{{cite web|title=Rhim's Ramblings on Livejournal|url=http://rhim-jim.livejournal.com/6796.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714071658/http://rhim-jim.livejournal.com/6796.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-14}}</ref>

2003 also saw the creation of the band's [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] website NothingAndNowhere.com.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nothing And Nowhere.com Video Capture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VnNEQ6E0nw| publisher = [[YouTube]]}}</ref> designed by Aslan and the band<ref>{{cite video| people = Chibi, Rainbow, J.

While studying fine arts, the group learned about [[color theory]] and chose the color [[Violet (color)|violet]] to represent the band's themes.<ref>{{cite video| people = Chibi, Owen, Dan Gilman| date = October 2, 2009| title = Leaf Pile TV Interviews The Birthday Massacre | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m346aXQMtA| format = FLV/SWF/Flash| medium = video | publisher   = Leaf Pile TV (via [[YouTube]])| time = 5:34}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Birthday Massacre Interview – May 23, 2008|url=http://www.drivenfaroff.com/2008/06/04/the-birthday-massacre-interview-may-23-2008/|publisher=DrivenFarOff.com|access-date= August 8, 2011}}</ref> Rainbow said in an early interview: "Violet is the color of the tragic comedy. We associate it with fantasy and melancholy. These themes make up much of the band's lyrical inspiration. The color also mirrors our sound dynamic. Our music mixes contrasting elements. In turn, violet is the sum of two contrasting colors: Red and Blue."<ref>{{cite web|title=2004 Interview with Rainbow and Chibi|url=http://thebirthdaymassacre.ru/tbm/the-birthday-massacre/intervju/the-birthday-massacre-chibirainbow-r93|publisher=Datum}}</ref> The band established their signature sound and visuals during this time, and when they signed to their labels, retained complete artistic freedom.<ref>{{cite video| people = Chibi, Rainbow, Karacell | date  = September 1, 2010| title = The Birthday Massacre Interview - 2010 - from Monster-in-a-Box.com | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI04dQDMSaQ| format = FLV/SWF/Flash| medium = video | publisher = from Monster-in-a-Box.com (via [[YouTube]]) | time= 6:45}}</ref>

The Birthday Massacre have utilized the [[Internet]] throughout their career and are an example of a musical group that has evolved alongside [[file sharing]], and advancements in audio streaming capabilities. Initially, the band distributed their music for free, using music sharing software [[Napster]], in addition to sharing their music on [[MP3.com]] and their official websites. The band was active in updating their websites regularly, interacting with fans on their forum, and offering their site in multiple languages like [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Early on the band encouraged fans to create their own content, and consequently the band saw a surge in fan-created content, which they organized on a [[webring]] called Violetprison.com, posting in 2003; "We want our fans to contribute and be involved so rather than telling newcomers who we are, we would rather our fans tell you."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.violetprison.com/ |title=Violetprison.com |access-date=2011-08-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031216013219/http://www.violetprison.com/ |archive-date=December 16, 2003 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

When asked in an interview by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], what she thought about [[factory farming]] being the number one cause of [[global warming]], Chibi said: "Our manager is really on the politicians about factory farming in Southwestern Ontario. Besides the cruelty to the animals, the runoff of the manure in the spring with the heavy rains is making the coastline of Lake Huron a disaster zone. He tells me that the beautiful stretch of sand dunes and beaches around [[Pinery Provincial Park]] and well north of [[Grand Bend]] (the big resort town), gets posted for no swimming half the summer. It should probably be posted all the time until they dismantle the [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]] in [[Huron County, Ontario|Huron County]]."<ref name=peta>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Shan|title=The Birthday Massacre|url=http://www.peta2.com/outthere/o-birthday-massacre.asp?c=p23195|publisher=PETA|access-date=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

When asked in a video interview by TasteitTV about having to conform to society, Rainbow says: "...A lot of the inspirations and themes in the lyrics, and even in the imagery is sort of childhood, and you know that perspective of when you're younger... you lose a bit of that sense of wonder and mystery, which is really inspiring and gives you a lot of energy when you're younger." Chibi follows by saying: "You have to be an adult, and you have to conform in certain ways because you have responsibilities now, whereas when you were a child, all you had to do is play games and lay in the grass, you know what I mean?"<ref name=TasteIT>{{cite video |people=Brigitte, Rainbow, Chibi |date= September 5, 2009|title= Chibi and Rainbow (The Birthday Massacre) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87vZUEaDgCU |format=SWF/FLV/Flash |publisher= TasteIT TV (via [[YouTube]]) |location=Gothic Festival (Belgium) |time=2:50 }}</ref>

On the ''Blairing Out With Eric Blair'' show, when asked about what kind of advice Chibi would give to somebody who was thinking about committing [[suicide]], Chibi responds: "Just ride it out because things can get better. When I think back to times in my life when I was having a horrible time, like I hated high school, I was unpopular, the whole thing. It became so irrelevant. It's like if you just give things time, you'll be like, what was I worried about five years ago?
