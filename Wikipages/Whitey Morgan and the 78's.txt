'''Whitey Morgan and the 78's''' are an American [[honky tonk]] country band, based in [[Flint, Michigan]], United States. In 2010, they signed a recording contract with Chicago-based [[Bloodshot Records]].

==Formation and early history==
Started in 2005, under the name Whitey Morgan and the Waycross Georgia Farmboys, the original members included Whitey Morgan (a.k.a. Eric Allen) on vocals and guitar; Jeremy Mackinder on bass; and Dylan Dunbar and Jack Schneider on guitar and drums respectively.<ref>[http://weekly.metrotimes.com/Subjects/s11078/Whitey_Morgan_and_The_Waycross_Georgia_Farmboys]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714081044/http://weekly.metrotimes.com/Subjects/s11078/Whitey_Morgan_and_The_Waycross_Georgia_Farmboys |date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> After establishing themselves in the Midwest Honky Tonk scene, the band recorded a self-produced EP which includes early versions of "Goodbye Dixie," "Prove It All To You," and "If It Ain't Broke." The band soon signed a deal with Detroit's own Small Stone Recordings and went back into the studio to record a cover version of [[Van Halen]]'s "Runnin' with the Devil" for the label's compilation album, ''[[Sucking the 70's – Back in the Saddle Again|Sucking the 70's]]''.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

In 2009, the band saw the addition of Tamineh Gueramy on Fiddle.

With almost 200 shows a year and the new album nearing completion the band drew the attention of Chicago's Bloodshot Records and signed a new record contract. The self-titled album was released on October 12, 2010. Ahead of the record's release, both Benny James and Mike Popovich left the band, replaced by Travis Harrett on the drums and Brett Robinson joined on pedal steel guitar. In April 2012, Jeremy Mackinder was replaced by Joey Spina on guitar.{{cn|date=July 2015}} The album ''Grandpa's Guitar'' was released in December 2014. It features three cover tunes: [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "Highway Patrolman," "Today I Started Loving You Again" by [[Merle Haggard]] and Bonnie Owens, and "Dead Flowers" by THE ROLLING STONES
