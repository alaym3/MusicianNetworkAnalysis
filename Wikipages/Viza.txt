'''Viza''' or '''VI·ZA''' (formerly known as '''Visa''') is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, using [[oud]], [[duduk]] and [[percussion]] fused with more conventional rock elements such as [[guitar]], [[Bass guitar|bass]] and [[drums]].  The band has released various [[Extended play|EPs]] and full-length albums. The band's music mixes [[Armenia]]n and [[Greece|Greek]]-inflected styles with elements of modern aggressive rock and traditional music. The band sometimes blends these various flavors with dance and satirical social commentary.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.serjicalstrike.com/site/artists_view.php?id=16 |title=SerjicalStrike.com Artist Profile |access-date=2011-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716042542/http://www.serjicalstrike.com/site/artists_view.php?id=16 |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Viza has performed at Hungary's [[Sziget Festival]], Sweden's Malmöfestivalen, Norway's Kartfestivalen, and Slovenia's Schengenfest and Trnfest festivals, among dozens of headline shows, as a part of 6 European tours over the past several years.

Viza was associated with Serjical Strike Management headed by [[Serj Tankian]] from [[System of a Down]] from 2009-2012, also featuring Tankian as a guest vocalist on their track "Viktor". In August 2010, Viza embarked on a series of introductory performances in Europe, opening for Serj Tankian's “Imperfect Harmonies” Tour in the cities of Yerevan, Athens, Hamburg, Cologne, Paris, Zurich, and Bologna. Viza accompanied Serj Tankian again during his "Harakiri" World Tour in the Fall of 2012 as the main support act for 19 shows throughout North America and Europe.<ref>[http://www.serjtankian.com/news/support-band-harakiri-world-tour-announced SerjTankian.com News & Announcements]</ref>

In December 2011, the band released their fourth full-length album, ''Carnivalia'', and released the title track as a single. In July 2012, the band recorded and released their third single, a cover of the 1927 "[[Alabama Song#The Doors version|Alabama Song (whisky bar)]]" by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]]. In 2014, Viza released their album Aria, and toured as direct support for [[Gogol Bordello]], [[Skindred]], and Soil.

After a brief hiatus to focus on individual music projects, beginning in late 2017, Viza released a series of new recordings via YouTube on the first day of every month continuing into 2018. These 12 tracks were divided into two EPs named "The Unorthodox Revival", in two separate Volumes. The band continues its activities locally in Los Angeles and performed in Paris in May 2019 in support of the My Ouai charitable foundation for providing musical opportunities to disabled children in France.
