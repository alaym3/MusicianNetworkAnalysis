'''Haste the Day''' was an American [[metalcore]] band formed in [[Carmel, Indiana]] in 2001 and signed to [[Solid State Records]]. Their name is derived from a lyric in the hymn "[[It Is Well with My Soul]]" by [[Horatio Spafford]]. The band released an [[extended play|EP]] titled ''[[That They May Know You]]'', in 2002, followed by five [[studio album]]s: ''[[Burning Bridges (Haste the Day album)|Burning Bridges]]'' (2004), ''[[When Everything Falls]]'' (2005), ''[[Pressure the Hinges]]'' (2007), ''[[Dreamer (Haste the Day album)|Dreamer]]'' (2008), and ''[[Attack of the Wolf King]]'' (2010). The group disbanded in March 2011 but reformed in 2014 and released ''[[Coward (Haste the Day album)|Coward]]'' in 2015.

==History==

Haste the Day formed in 2001 in Carmel, Indiana.  The name was discovered by Devin Chaulk who read it from the hymn "[[It Is Well with My Soul]]." The band originally started out as a three-piece including: Brennan Chaulk (guitar/vocals), Devin Chaulk (drums/vocals), and Mike Murphy (bass/vocals).  Six months after forming, the band added longtime friend Jason Barnes to the group as a second guitarist.  In 2002, the band recruited [[Jimmy Ryan (vocalist)|Jimmy Ryan]] as their lead vocalist who was member of the death metal band Upheaval from 1997 until 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Jimmy_Ryan/6371 |title=Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives - Jimmy Ryan |publisher=The Metal Archives |date=April 9, 2011 |access-date=October 29, 2011}}</ref> In the summer of 2002, the band self-produced their first EP, ''[[That They May Know You]]'' with the song "Substance" acting as the lead single. A year later Haste the Day signed with [[Tooth & Nail Records]] subsidiary [[Solid State Records]].

After signing to Solid State, Haste the Day went on to record their debut album, ''[[Burning Bridges (Haste the Day album)|Burning Bridges]]'' which was released on March 9, 2004 in the band's old high school cafeteria at [[Carmel High School (Carmel, Indiana)|Carmel High School]].  The band made two music videos for the songs "The Closest Thing To Closure" and "American Love". After a year, Haste the Day released ''[[When Everything Falls]]''.  The album hit stores on June 28, 2005. A music video was made for the title track.  The band toured heavily in support of this album and gained worldwide recognition.

In late 2005, Jimmy Ryan announced his decision to leave Haste the Day. Soon thereafter he got married and accepted a position at Tooth & Nail Records. His last show with Haste the Day was in the band's hometown of Indianapolis on December 30, 2005, although he came on stage for a song during their show at the Napalm & Noise Tour on November 28, 2009 in Indianapolis and at their final show in Indianapolis on March 11, 2011. In 2012, he started a new band called [[Trenches (band)|Trenches]].
