== Personal life ==

==Controversies==

===Feuds===
In 2014, Nyovest was embroiled in a feud with long-time rival, [[AKA (rapper)|AKA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.okayafrica.com/cassper-nyovest-aka-beef-south-africa-hip-hop/|title=AKA, Cassper & South Africa's Biggest Hip-Hop Beef|website=OkayAfrica}}</ref> As Nyovest claimed his song "[[Doc Shebeleza]]" was the biggest song in South African Hip-Hop, AKA who was promoting his new single "[[Congratulate (song)|Congratulate]]", showed contradiction when he tweeted, "There's a rapper running around saying he got the biggest song in the country ... I challenge you to find his song in the iTunes Top 100".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/local/a-very-brief-guide-to-the-aka-and-cassper-nyovest-feud-15997501|title=A very brief guide to the AKA and Cassper Nyovest feud|website=IOL}}</ref> Thereafter, Nyovest responded with a tweet stating reasons why his song was bigger than AKA's. The argument escalated as both rappers were responding to each other multiple times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/drum/20140821/281685433010434|title=Cassper Nyovest's Twitter War|website=Press Reader}}</ref> In August 2014, the pair were scheduled to both perform on [[SABC 1]] music show, ''Live Amp'' when a member of AKA's entourage allegedly pulled a gun on Cassper and his team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/Inside-the-years-biggest-feud-AKA-Vs-Cassper-Nyovest-20150330|title=Inside the year's biggest feud: AKA Vs Cassper Nyovest.|website=Channel24}}</ref> Further controversy arose in 2015, when Cassper accused AKA of slapping him which led both rappers to release diss tracks. In 2018 when Nyovest was asked about the status of his feud with AKA, he stated the two would never reconcile, which has so far proven true.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysun.co.za/News/Entertainment/cassper-and-aka-will-never-reconcile-20180606|title=Cassper and AKA Will 'Never' Reconcile|website=Daily Sun}}</ref>

===Lawsuits and civil disputes===

In 2018, [[Xitsonga]] musician, [[Benny Mayengani]] was to do his concert named, ''#FillUpGiyaniStadium''.
