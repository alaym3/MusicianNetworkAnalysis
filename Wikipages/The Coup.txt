'''The Coup''' is an American [[political hip hop|communist hip hop]] band from [[Oakland, California]]. Their music is an amalgamation of influences, including [[funk]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[hip hop]], and [[soul music|soul]]. Frontman [[Boots Riley]]'s revolutionarily-charged lyrics rank The Coup as a renowned [[political hip hop]] band aligned to radical music groups such as [[Crass]], [[Dead Prez]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]].

The Coup's music is driven by assertive and danceable [[bass drum|bass]]-driven [[beat (music)|backbeat]]s overlaid by critical, hopeful, and witty lyrics, often with a bent towards the literary. The Coup's songs critique, observe, and lampoon [[capitalism]], [[American politics]], white [[patriarchy|patriarchal exploitation]], [[police brutality]], [[marijuana addiction]], [[Romance (love)|romance]], and disparities among races and social classes.

==History==
===First decade===
The Coup's debut album was 1991s ''The EP'' and almost all of the songs on it (except "Economics 101") were put on 1993's ''[[Kill My Landlord]]''.  In 1994, the group released its second album, ''[[Genocide & Juice]]''. The group took a four-year recording hiatus to work as community activists before releasing ''[[Steal This Album]]'' (the title of which pays tribute to 1960s radical [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s [[yippie]] manifesto, ''[[Steal this Book]]'') to critical acclaim in 1998. ''Steal This Album'' featured the stand-out single, "Me and Jesus the Pimp in a ’79 Granada Last Night." The online magazine ''Dusted'' called ''Steal This Album'' "the best hip-hop album of the 1990s".<ref>{{cite web | last =Hunt | first =Sam | title =Buy This Album | publisher =Dusted Magazine | date =2002-08-26 | url =http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/328 | access-date =2007-09-28  }}</ref>

===''Party Music'' and post-9/11 aftermath===
In 2001, The Coup released ''[[Party Music]]'' to widespread praise. However, in part because of distribution problems, sales of the album were low. The original album cover art depicted group members Pam the Funkstress and Riley standing in front of the twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as they are destroyed by huge explosions, and Riley is pushing the button on a guitar tuner. The cover art was finished in June 2001 and the album was scheduled to be released in mid-September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/rumors/thecoup.asp |title=The Coup Cover Art |publisher=snopes.com |access-date=2012-08-02}}</ref> However, in response to the uncanny similarity of the artwork with the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], the album release was delayed until November of that year with the cover featuring a hand with a flaming martini glass.

The attention generated concerning the album's cover art precipitated some criticism of the group's lyrical content as well, particularly the ''Party Music'' track "5 Million Ways to Kill a CEO." The song's lyrics includes lines such as "You could throw a twenty in a vat of hot oil/When he jump in after it, watch him boil." Conservative columnist [[Michelle Malkin]] cited the song in calling the Coup's work a "stomach-turning example of anti-Americanism disguised as highbrow intellectual expression."<ref>{{cite web | last =Malkin | first =Michelle | title =Stop giving America a bad rap | publisher =[[Jewish World Review]] | date =2001-12-28 | url =http://www.jewishworldreview.com/michelle/malkin122801.asp | access-date =2007-09-28  }}</ref>

=== Mid-2000s ===
On November 15, 2005, Tarus Jackson (AKA Terrance), who had joined the group as a promoter, was fatally shot during a robbery at his home in Oakland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Member of The Coup Killed in Robbery |publisher=Hiphopmusic.com |date=2005-11-16 |url=http://www.hiphopmusic.com/archives/001242.html |access-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203623/http://www.hiphopmusic.com/archives/001242.html |archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>

December 2, 2006 saw another tragedy for the Coup: About two hours following a performance at the [[San Diego]] [[House of Blues]], the tour bus in which the group was riding drove off the road and flipped over before becoming engulfed in flames.<ref>{{cite web | title =The Coup survives bus crash; cancels tour dates! | date =2006-12-04 | url =http://www.epitaph.com/news/news/2755 | access-date =2007-09-28  }}</ref> All passengers managed to climb out alive, although some were badly injured. The group did, however, lose all of its clothes, computers, cash, identification, house/car keys, cell phones, all of its instruments, and sound equipment.  The ensuing insurance payment was delayed in its arrival, and the group was forced to cancel the rest of its tour.

The group’s songs "My Favorite Mutiny" and "Pork & Beef" were featured in the 2007 film, ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', with the former also being featured in the HBO miniseries ''24/7 Flyers-Rangers'', as well as in the video game ''NBA Live 07'', while "Ride the Fence" was featured in [[Electronic Arts|EA]]'s 2007 [[skateboarding]] [[video game]] ''[[Skate (video game)|Skate]]''. The song “Captain Sterling’s Little Problem” accompanied the closing credits of ''[[Sir, No, Sir]]'', a documentary about the GI anti-war movement.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

=== 2010-2020 ===

On Wednesday January 13, 2010, The Coup’s bassist Dewey Tucker was shot and killed on the I-80 freeway in Hercules, CA, while driving from his home in Vallejo, CA, to rehearsal with The Coup in Oakland, CA. It was later found to be a case of mistaken identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfweekly.com/music/more-musician-deaths-teddy-pendergrass-and-the-coups-bassist-dewey-tucker/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/10/26/vallejo-man-convicted-of-murder-in-death-of-musician-dewey-tucker/}}</ref>

The Coup's sixth album, a [[concept album]] entitled ''[[Sorry to Bother You (album)|Sorry to Bother You]]'', was released on October 30, 2012, to wide acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anti.com/artists/the-coup|title=The Coup|date=2012-10-30|publisher=ANTI|access-date=2014-01-27}}</ref> The first track, "The Magic Clap", was leaked by the band themselves and posted below an article on August 13, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/coup_return_with_sorry_to_bother_you_get_killer_mike_das_racist_to_guest|title=The Coup Return with 'Sorry to Bother You', Get Killer Mike, Das Racist to Guest|last=Hudson|first=Alex|date=2012-08-13|access-date=2012-08-13}}</ref> 

The album ''Sorry to Bother You'' was inspired by a screenplay written by Riley, "a [[dark comedy]] with [[magical realism]]" that drew inspiration from his time spent working as a [[telemarketer]].<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Michael Mechanic|url=http://motherjones.com/riff/2011/01/boots-riley-interview-the-coup-tom-morello|title=Boots Riley Is Sorry to Bother You|magazine=Mother Jones|date=2011-01-03|access-date=2012-08-02}}</ref> The film's screenplay was published by ''[[McSweeney's]]'' in 2014.<ref name="Sorry to Bother You (book)">{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Boots|title=Sorry to Bother You|date=2014|publisher=McSweeny's|location=San Francisco}}</ref> Riley was able to secure funding to turn the script into the film ''[[Sorry to Bother You]]'', which was released in theaters by [[Annapurna Pictures]] on July 6, 2018. The film, which follows a young African-American telemarketer who adopts a white accent in order to thrive at his job, stars [[Lakeith Stanfield]], with [[Armie Hammer]], [[Tessa Thompson]], [[Terry Crews]], and [[Danny Glover]] in supporting roles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/05/the-new-sorry-to-bother-you-trailer-is-here.html|title=Sorry to Bother You, But the Sorry to Bother You Redband Trailer Is Here|last=Kiefer|first=Halle|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}</ref> 

Having taken six years after their last album, The Coup recorded a full soundtrack to the film, entitled ''The Soundtrack to Sorry to Bother You'', and released the first single, "OYAHYTT (feat. Lakeith Stanfield)", on July 13, 2018.  Guest artists included Janelle Monae, Killer Mike, and E40. Songs from the 2012 album were not in the actual film. Vinyl for the album was released in February 2020.

===Boots Riley===
{{quote box|quote=" I think that people should have democratic control over the profits that they produce. It is not real democracy until you have that. And the plain and simple definition of communism is the people having democratic control over the profits that they create."
| source=—Boots Riley | width=35% | align=right}}

Among other things, Boots Riley is known for charismatic, and seemingly inexhaustibly energetic, punk-like stage presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/10526/the-coup-live-in-san-francisco|title=The Coup|publisher=Punknews.org|access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref>

In 1991, he and other artists founded the Mau Mau Rhythm Collective, a group set up to use the power of hip hop music to publicize other efforts and movements. The next year, Riley founded The Coup.

In July 2002, Riley was a guest on [[Bill Maher]]'s ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' and repeatedly referred to himself as a [[communist]]. Maher criticized him by saying that communists don't sell records.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xDd6ZzKnMM#t=7m38s |title=Politically Incorrect - Boots Riley - part 2 of 2 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2012-08-02}}</ref>

Riley was charged with abusive language for allegedly using profanity on stage while performing with the band [[Galactic (band)|Galactic]] in [[Downtown Norfolk, Virginia]], in the city's annual Bayou Boogaloo Festival at [[Town Point Park]] in June 2008. This was a result of controversy that started a few weeks prior in the same park when, at a different festival, singer [[Ray-J]] used language some found offensive. Riley's charge only carried a small fine. However, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] decided to help him fight it on free speech grounds before the charge was ultimately dismissed by the city shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/freespeech/gen/36106prs20080724.html |title=Norfolk Drops Criminal Charges against Music Artist for On-stage Comments &#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2008-07-24 |access-date=2012-08-02}}</ref>

During [[Tom Morello]]'s Fall 2008 tour as [[the Nightwatchman]], Riley appeared on selected dates, and the two debuted a song from an upcoming project called [[Street Sweeper Social Club]]. In March 2009, a Web site appeared at the url [http://streetsweepermusic.com/ streetsweepermusic.com], which debuted its first single "Fight! Smash! Win!" It was also announced that the band would be the opening act on the upcoming tour<ref name="test">[http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2009/03/street-sweeper.html Tom Morello, Boots Riley's Street Sweeper to tour with Nine Inch Nails], March 6. 2009 Retrieved 2009-03-08.</ref> with [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Jane's Addiction]].

== Cultural impact ==

===Literature===
*The 2001 novel ''Too Beautiful For Words'', by Monique W. Morris, was based on The Coup's 1997 7-minute opus "Me And Jesus The Pimp In A '79 Grenada Last Night".<ref>{{cite news|author=AlterNet / By Jeff Chang |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/12194/the_new_coup_debut |title=The New Coup Debut |work=Alternet |date=2002-01-08 |access-date=2014-01-27}}</ref> Morris kept the original storyline and main characters of the song as the setting for her work. Some of the dialogue in the book is directly from the song as well. The title of the novel is from the refrain of the bridge in The Coup's song. Published by HarperCollins Publishers.
*[[Vijay Prashad]]'s 2002 book, ''Fat Cats and Running Dogs'' starts with a quote from The Coup's "Fat Cats and Bigga Fish" as an obvious nod to the inspiration for the title of the book.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twOwWfx_UpkC |title=Fat Cats & Running Dogs: The Enron Stage of Capitalism - Vijay Prashad - Google Boeken |isbn=9781842772614 |access-date=2014-01-27|last1=Prashad |first1=Vijay |year=2002 }}</ref>
*The 2013 book ''Party Music'', by Rickey Vincent, was inspired by the concept of The Coup's 2001 album ''Party Music'' and discussions that the author had with Boots Riley about the subject. The book is a history of The Lumpen, the Black Panther Party's funk band. Riley wrote the introduction to the book.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hildebrand |first=Lee |title=Rickey Vincent's Party Music: The KPFA DJ's new book chronicles how The Black Panther Party used funk to spread its revolutionary message |work=East Bay Express|access-date=2014-01-27 |date=2013-10-23 |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/rickey-vincents-party-music/Content?oid=3745240 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111004205/http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/rickey-vincents-party-music/Content?oid=3745240 |archive-date=November 11, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

===Music===

*The 1993 song "Practice Lookin' Hard", by [[E-40|E40]], has a chorus and a concept built around the lyric "I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard", from The Coup's 1993 song "Not Yet Free".

===Film===

The 1997 film ''[[Money Talks (1997 film)|Money Talks]]'' starring [[Chris Tucker]], has exactly the same opening scene as the opening scene of The Coup's 1993 video for "Not Yet Free". In both, the protagonist is riding around in an expensive looking Mercedes-Benz, pulls up to the car wash to park and gets out. In both, it is at this time that we figure out that the protagonist merely works at the car wash. In both, the protagonist holds the keys out in front of the actual owner and feigns as if he's going to hit the owner.<ref name="youtube1">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-liNf9GEt8A |title=The Coup - Not Yet Free |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-02-11 |access-date=2014-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkLz3uVmwNQ |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2014-01-27}}</ref>
