==Personal life==
On March 4, 2014, Curry's brother Treon Johnson died as a result of complications of being [[taser]]ed. Officers had responded to reports of Johnson beating two dogs with a metal pipe. The police employed [[pepper spray]] and ultimately tasered Treon before he could be successfully apprehended. Treon Johnson died after being transported to Hialeah Hospital. Curry has said that his brother died of an apparent cardiac arrest when he went into [[sepsis]] from a freak injury after being tasered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.local10.com/news/2014/03/04/treon-johnson-dies-hours-after-being-taken-into-custody/|title=Treon Johnson dies hours after being taken into custody|work=Local 10|first=Tamika|last=Bickham|date=March 4, 2014}}</ref>
