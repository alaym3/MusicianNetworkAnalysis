'''Life Without Buildings''' were a [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]-based [[indie rock]] band. 

==Career==
Named after a track by English new wave band [[Japan (band)|Japan]], Life Without Buildings formed during the summer of 1999. The band consisted mostly of ex-students of the [[Glasgow School of Art]], Initial band members were Will Bradley (drums), [[Chris Evans (artist)|Chris Evans]] (bass) and Robert Johnston (guitar). Painter [[Sue Tompkins]] (vocals) joined later in 1999. The band split writing duties, with Johnston, Bradley and Evans writing the music while Tompkins wrote the vocals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fronsacq |first1=Julien |title=Portrait Sue Tompkins |journal=Spike |date=Winter 2008 |volume=18 |url=http://old.spikeart.at/en/a/magazin/back/Portrait_Sue_Tompkins |accessdate=11 August 2020}}</ref> Tompkins' "talk-sung" vocal styling eventually became the band's most famous attribute. Impressed after their first London gig, the [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]-affiliated Tugboat label asked the band to record a debut single.

Released in March 2000, "The Leanover" b/w "New Town" secured the band a full deal with the label. "New Town" received some airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Q&A with Life Without Buildings |url=http://www.nypress.com/news/qa-with-life-without-buildings-DANP1020010710307109971 |website=Our Town |publisher=Strauss Media |accessdate=11 August 2020}}</ref> The band later released two more singles on the Tugboat label. The band's debut, ''[[Any Other City]]'', recorded by Scottish producer [[Andy Miller (record producer)|Andy Miller]] at Chem19 Studios in Glasgow, was released in 2001 in the UK; label DCBaltimore2012 issued it months later in the [[United States]].

Life Without Buildings were on the same bill as [[The Strokes]] in February 2001, during the latter band's first headlining gig. A popular legend sprung up that due to the Strokes' popularity, Life Without Buildings was bumped further down the bill. Band members disputed this, saying that while they had been scheduled to play the show, it was the result of a booking error, not anything intentional.<ref name="Muso" />

In January 2002 ''Any Other City'' debuted at #49 on the [[CMJ]] Radio 200.<ref>{{cite journal |title=CMJ New Music Report |date=21 January 2002 |volume=January 21, 2002 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-pJSHB0MVEC&q=life+without+buildings+any+other+city+chart&pg=PT23 |accessdate=11 August 2020}}</ref> It stayed on the Radio 200 for eight weeks, peaking at #22.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=CMJ New Music Report |date=March 11, 2002 |volume=70 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3_QdrXyJ78C&q=life+without+buildings+cmj+radio+200&pg=PA23 |accessdate=11 August 2020}}</ref>

===Break-up===
The band broke up in 2002, after the release of ''Any Other City''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Unsung: The 100 Greatests Bands You've (probably) Never Heard|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=August 2009|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGaz0_gZPzIC&q=%22Sue%20Tompkins%22%20artist&pg=PA72}}</ref> In a 2009 interview with ''[[Muso's Guide]]'', guitarist Johnston stated the band broke up because Tompkins wanted to focus on her career as a visual artist. He went on to stress that none of the band members ever envisioned turning music into a career, and they felt pressure because something that had started "for a laugh" had become serious.<ref name="Muso">{{cite web |title=Life Without Buildings: the catch up interview |url=http://musosguide.com:80/life-without-buildings-the-catch-up-interview/8990 |website=Muso's Guide |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330034309/http://musosguide.com:80/life-without-buildings-the-catch-up-interview/8990 |accessdate=11 August 2020|archive-date=30 March 2013 }}</ref>

In May 2007 a live album was released in Europe called ''Live at the Annandale Hotel'' on the [[Gargleblast Records]] label, and was subsequently released in North America in August 2007 on [[Absolutely Kosher Records]]. Recorded around December 2002 at Sydney's Annandale Hotel,<ref>{{cite web |title=Life Without Buildings Live at the Annandale Hotel |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10535-live-at-the-annandale-hotel |website=Pitchfork |accessdate=29 December 2020}}</ref> band members claimed to be unaware that the show was recorded, but were happy with the finished live record.<ref name="Muso" />

''Any Other City'' was reissued on vinyl in the United States for the first time on April 19, 2014 for [[Record Store Day]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Manchester |first1=Guy |title=Rough Trade Mark The Start Of A New Reissuing Campaign By Releasing The Classic Debut Album By Life Without Buildings |url=https://louderthanwar.com/rough-trade-mark-the-start-of-a-new-reissuing-campaign-by-releasing-the-classic-debut-album-by-life-without-buildings/ |website=Louder than War |accessdate=10 August 2020}}</ref> The vinyl reissue included a 7", featuring rougher original versions of "The Leanover" and "New Town".<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web |last1=Zoladz |first1=Lindsay |title=Life Without Buildings: Any Other City reissue review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19181-life-without-buildings-any-other-city/ |website=Pitchfork |accessdate=10 August 2020}}</ref>

As of 2009, the band has stated no desire to either re-form or play one-off shows. Johnston went on to work as a graphic designer. Bradley became a writer, while Evans and Tompkins work as visual artists.<ref name="Muso" />
