'''John Cooper Clarke''' (born 25 January 1949) is an English [[performance poet]], who first became famous as a "[[Punk rock|punk]] poet" in the late 1970s.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jcdbc |title=Evidently... John Cooper Clarke |work=[[BBC Four]] |access-date=5 June 2012}}</ref> In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he released several albums. Around this time, he performed on stage with several punk and [[post-punk]] bands and continues to perform regularly.

His recorded output has mainly relied on musical backing from [[the Invisible Girls]], which featured [[Martin Hannett]], [[Stephen Hopkins (musician)|Steve Hopkins]], [[Pete Shelley]], [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]], and [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]].

==Early life==
Clarke was born in [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], [[Lancashire]], in 1949.<ref name="Strong">{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |year=2003 |title=The Great Indie Discography |publisher=Canongate |isbn=1-84195-335-0 |pages=33–34}}</ref> He lived in the [[Higher Broughton]] area of the city and became interested in poetry after being inspired by his English teacher, John Malone,<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Adams |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/06/john-cooper-clarke-poetry-bard-salford |title=John Cooper Clarke interview: 'Poetry is not something you have to retire from' |work=The Guardian |date=6 April 2014 |access-date=11 June 2016}}</ref> whom he described as "a real outdoor guy, an [[Ernest Hemingway]] type, red blooded, literary bloke".<ref name="star">{{cite news |url=http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=106|title=John Cooper Clarke On Life In Higher Broughton |newspaper=Salford Star |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref> During an April 2018 episode of [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]]' radio show ''Jonesy's Jukebox'', Clarke revealed one of his early inspirations to be the poet Sir [[Henry Newbolt]], reciting from memory a portion of Newbolt's poem "Vitaï Lampada".  Recollecting his childhood, Clarke said:

{{quote|I used to think trees were dirty, because when I was a kid in Salford you'd climb them and come off filthy, it was like you'd been up a chimney... and even if you got a stretch of park you just had to scrape the grass and there were, like, cinders underneath... it was horrible...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=105 |title=It's Legend Time |work=Salford Star |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref>}}

His first job was a laboratory technician at [[University of Salford#History|Salford Tech]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b4wtl |title=The Bard of Salford |work=BBC Radio 4 |date=8 May 2008 |access-date=9 October 2015}}</ref> He began his performance career in Manchester folk clubs, where he began working with Rick Goldstraw and his band the Ferrets.<ref name="Strong" /> His first releases were on Tosh Ryan and [[Martin Hannett]]'s independent label Rabid,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.johncrumpton.co.uk/page28.htm  |title=Rabid Records|website=Johncrumpton.co.uk  |access-date=3 June 2016}}</ref> starting with the EP ''Innocents'' in October 1977.<ref name="Strong" /> Rabid also released his debut LP ''Où est la maison de fromage'?'' (catalogue number NOZE 1), which was a collection of live recordings, demos and rehearsals. He toured with [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]]'s band [[Be-Bop Deluxe]] in 1978 and was signed by [[Epic Records]], who issued the studio album ''Disguise In Love'', produced by Hannett, in 1978.<ref name="Strong" />

Clarke has attributed his early success in part to the influence of the English poet [[Pam Ayres]]. Her run of success on the British TV show [[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|''Opportunity Knocks'']] led both Clarke and his mother to believe that he could make a living at poetry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/06/john-cooper-clarke-poetry-bard-salford|title=John Cooper Clarke interview: 'Poetry is not something you have to retire from'|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=5 April 2014|website=The Guardian|access-date=4 July 2016}}</ref>

===Solo success===
In 1979, he had his only UK top 40 hit with "Gimmix! (Play Loud)".<ref name="Strong" /><ref name="bell">{{cite web |last=Bell |first=Nigel |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/music/2002/08/john_cooper_clarke.shtml |title=The Very Best of John Cooper Clarke |work=BBC |date=August 2002 |access-date=23 February 2008}}</ref> Clarke toured with [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]], and has performed on the same bill as bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]], the [[The Fall (band)|Fall]], [[Joy Division]], [[Buzzcocks]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rockpile]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]] (including at their May 1984 [[Music for Miners]] benefit concert at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]]). His set is characterised by lively, rapid-fire renditions of his [[poem]]s, usually performed [[a cappella]]. Often referred to as "the [[bard]] of Salford",<ref name="bell" /> he usually refers to himself on stage as "Johnny Clarke, the name behind the hairstyle".

Clarke appeared in a 1982 music documentary compilation ''[[Urgh! A Music War]]'', in which he performed his poem "Health Fanatic".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138902/ |title=Urgh! A Music War |work=IMDB |access-date=23 February 2008}}</ref>  The film featured live performances of mainstream artists ([[the Police]], [[the Go-Go's]], [[XTC]], [[Devo]]) as well as more obscure bands ([[Pere Ubu]], [[The Invisible Girls|Invisible Girls]], [[The Alley Cats (punk rock band)|the Alley Cats]], [[Spizzenergi|Athletico Spizz '80]], [[Chelsea (band)|Chelsea]]) using concert footage from around the world. He also starred in another 1982 film titled ''John Cooper Clarke - Ten Years in an Open Necked Shirt'' produced for the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and [[Channel 4]]. Somewhere between a narrative film, a series of music videos and a documentary, the film features interviews and performances by Clarke and Linton Kwesi Johnson among others.<ref>{{YouTube|s1WA55ZA0bU|"Ten Years in an Open Necked Shirt (film)"}}. Retrieved on 2 March 2009.</ref>

Clarke released ''Zip Style Method'' in 1982, but thereafter performed his live act less frequently, spending much of the 1980s mired in heroin addiction, living in a "domestic partnership" with singer and fellow addict [[Nico]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycv.co.uk/johncooperclarke/index.htm |title=John Cooper Clarke |work=Comedy CV.co.uk |access-date=23 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-bit-of-lip/2007/01/26/1169594479640.html?page=4 |title=A bit of lip |date=28 January 2007 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |access-date=4 May 2009}}</ref> He described this period of his life: "It was a feral existence. I was on drugs. It was hand to mouth."<ref name="Hatt" /> In 1987, he performed live (on crutches owing to a broken ankle) at the Albany Empire in London with [[Suns of Arqa]], recorded two tracks ("Libera Me" and "The Truth Lies Therein") for their album ''[[Seven (Suns of Arqa album)|Seven]]'', and featured in the music video for the latter.  In 1988, he made an appearance in two UK adverts for [[Sugar Puffs]], taking second billing to the [[Honey Monster]].<ref name="Strong" /> He returned to live performance in the 1990s, appearing again with Suns of Arqa in 1992 at The Witchwood in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]].  His vocals from both of his Suns of Arqa tracks have been used on numerous remixes by the band ever since.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Since 2000===
After 20 years of performing the same material, Clarke re-established contact with guitarist Rick Goldstraw, who had founded [[Blue Orchids]] and played with The Fall and Nico. Goldshaw began handling Clarke's affairs, and the two toured with [[the Mescaleros]] and several times supporting the Fall.<ref name=star/> He also duetted with Reverend Jon McClure at a [[Reverend and the Makers]] concert at London's Spread Eagle, performing the poem "Last Resort", which would later be released as the B-side for the band's single "[[Heavyweight Champion of the World (song)|Heavyweight Champion of the World]]". Clarke also recorded a song with the band entitled "Dead Man's Shoes". Clarke's recording of "[[Evidently Chickentown]]" from his album ''[[Snap, Crackle & Bop]]'' was also featured prominently in the closing scene of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' episode ''[[Stage 5 (The Sopranos episode)|Stage 5]]''. A live performance of the same poem appears in the film ''[[Control (2007 film)|Control]]'', with Clarke portraying himself in a re-creation of a 1977 concert in which he supported Joy Division, despite being 30 years older than the events depicted in the film. "Evidently Chickentown" (recited by [[Christopher Eccleston]]) is featured in the made-for-television film ''[[Strumpet (film)|Strumpet]]''.

Clarke's poem "Out of Control Fairground" was printed inside the [[Arctic Monkeys]]' 2007 single "[[Fluorescent Adolescent]]" CD. The poem is also the inspiration behind the single's video, in which clowns brawl. The band's [[Alex Turner]] has said he is very fond of Clarke's work and takes inspiration for lyrics from his poems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_2383906.html?menu=entertainment.music |title=Arctics go for poetry |work=Ananova |access-date=20 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630222600/http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_2383906.html?menu=entertainment.music |archive-date=30 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline=lyrical-genius--%26method=full%26objectid=18971986%26siteid=66633-name_page.html |title=Lyrical Genius |quote=Alex Turner also has "John Cooper Clarke" tattooed on his arm |newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |access-date=20 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702055131/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline%3Dlyrical-genius--%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D18971986%26siteid%3D66633-name_page.html |archive-date=2 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In July 2013, Clarke was awarded an honorary doctorate of arts by the [[University of Salford]] in "acknowledgement of a career which has spanned five decades, bringing poetry to non-traditional audiences and influencing musicians and comedians." Upon receipt, Clarke commented: "Now I'm a doctor, finally my dream of opening a cosmetic surgery business can become a reality."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-23364941 |title=John Cooper Clarke honoured by University of Salford |work=BBC News |date=19 July 2013 |access-date=9 October 2015}}</ref> His poem "[[I Wanna Be Yours]]" was adapted by Arctic Monkeys and frontman Alex Turner for the band's fifth album, ''[[AM (Arctic Monkeys album)|AM]]'', released on 9 September 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcticmonkeys.com/news.php?id=586 |title=AM |work=Arctic Monkeys |date=24 June 2013 |access-date=9 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628233613/http://www.arcticmonkeys.com/news.php?id=586 |archive-date=28 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On their 2020 eponymous debut album, English band Working Men’s Club pays homage to the poet in “John Cooper Clarke,” referencing his poem “Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman" and book ''The Luckiest Guy Alive''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/john-cooper-clarke-interview-nico-i-wanna-be-yours-2792491|title=Does Rock 'N' Roll Kill Braincells?! – John Cooper Clarke|website=nme.com|date=21 October 2020|language=en|access-date=27 October 2020}}</ref>
