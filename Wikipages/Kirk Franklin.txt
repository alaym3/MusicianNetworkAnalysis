'''Kirk Dewayne Franklin''' (born January 26, 1970) is an American [[choir director]], [[gospel musician|gospel]] singer, dancer, songwriter, and author. He is best known for leading [[urban contemporary gospel]] choirs such as The Family, [[God's Property]], and [[One Nation Crew]] (1NC) among many others. He has won numerous awards, including 16 [[Grammy Awards]]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' dubbed Franklin as a "Reigning King of Urban Gospel",<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 26, 2003 |title=Hopeville Tour |url=https://variety.com/2003/music/reviews/hopeville-tour-1200543845/ |access-date=January 5, 2018 |website=GARY JACKSON}}</ref> and is one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame]].

== Early life ==
A native of [[Fort Worth, Texas]], Franklin was raised by his aunt, Gertrude, having been abandoned as a baby by his mother.<ref>Don Cusic, ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music: Pop, Rock, and Worship: Pop, Rock, and Worship'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2009, p. 197</ref> Gertrude recycled aluminum cans to raise money for Kirk to take piano lessons from the age of four. Kirk excelled and was able to read and write music while also [[Learning music by ear|playing by ear]].{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

At the age of seven, Franklin received his first contract which his aunt turned down.<ref name="exodusnews">{{Cite web |date=October 20, 1998 |title=Kirk Franklin: The Nu Nation Project |url=http://www.exodusnews.com/entertainment/Entertain008.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124163935/http://www.exodusnews.com/entertainment/Entertain008.htm |archive-date=January 24, 2010 |website=Exodus news}}</ref>  He did join the church choir and became music director of the Mt. Rose [[Baptist]] Church adult choir at 11 years of age.<ref>PEOPLE STAFF, [https://people.com/archive/apostle-of-gospel-vol-46-no-2/ Apostle of Gospel], ''People'', USA, July 8, 1996</ref>

In his teenage years, Franklin rebelled against his strict religious upbringing, and in an attempt to keep him out of trouble, his grandmother arranged an audition for him at a professional youth conservatory associated with a local university. He was accepted, but later he had to deal with a girlfriend's pregnancy and his eventual expulsion from school for bad behavior.<ref name="autobio">{{Cite book |last=Franklin |first=Kirk |title=Church Boy |date=1998 |isbn=0-8499-4050-8}}</ref>

Franklin studied music with Jewell Kelly and the Singing Chaparrals at [[O. D. Wyatt High School|Oscar Dean Wyatt High School]]. He continued under her tutelage and ultimately became the pianist for the choir.<ref name="autobio" />

When he was aged 15 he witnessed the death of a friend by shooting,<ref name="McNeil p132"/><ref name="rocknet">[http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-g/godsproperty_main.htm Kirk Franklin]. Rock on the Net. Retrieved August 19, 2012.</ref> after which Franklin returned to the church, where he again directed the choir. He also co-founded a [https://gospelhypenation.com.ng gospel group] ''The Humble Hearts'', which recorded one of Franklin's compositions and got the attention of gospel music legend Milton Biggham, musical director of the [[Georgia Mass Choir]]. Impressed, Biggham enlisted him to lead the DFW Mass Choir in a recording of Franklin's song "Every Day with Jesus". This led to Biggham hiring Franklin, just 20 years old at the time, to lead the choir at the 1990 [[Gospel Music Workshop of America]] Convention, an industry gathering.<ref name="exodusnews" />

== Career ==
=== Choirs (1992–2000) ===
In 1992, Franklin organized "The Family", which was a 17-voice [[choir]], formed from neighborhood friends and associates.<ref name="McNeil p132">W. K. McNeil, ''Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music'', Routledge, USA, 2013, p. 132</ref> In 1992, Vicki Mack-Lataillade, the co-founder of fledgling [[GospoCentric Records]] label, heard one of their demo tapes and was so impressed she immediately signed up Kirk & The Family to a recording contract.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kirk Franklin |url=http://www.bet.com/topics/k/kirk-franklin.html |access-date=April 9, 2014 |publisher=BET}}</ref>

In 1993, the group, now known as "Kirk Franklin & The Family," released their debut album, ''[[Kirk Franklin & The Family]]''.<ref>Randall Herbert Balmer, ''Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition'', Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 268</ref> It spent almost two years on the gospel music charts and charted on the R&B charts, eventually earning platinum sales status. It remained at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Top Gospel Albums chart for 42 weeks. It was the first gospel music album to sell over a million units.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Two years later, after releasing a 1995 Christmas album entitled ''[[Kirk Franklin & the Family Christmas]]'', the group released ''[[Whatcha Lookin' 4 (album)|Whatcha Lookin' 4]]'' in 1996. The album was certified 2x platinum and earned Franklin his first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Gospel Album|Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album]]. 1997 brought another album, a collaboration with the vocal ensemble [[God's Property]], aptly named ''[[God's Property (album)|God's Property from Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation]]''. The lead single, "[[Stomp (God's Property song)|Stomp]]", featuring [[Cheryl James|Cheryl "Salt" James]] (of [[Salt-N-Pepa]]), was a big hit, enjoying heavy rotation on [[MTV]] and other music channels and charting at No. 1 on the R&B Singles Airplay chart for two weeks, even making it into the [[Top 40]]. ''God's Property from Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation'' was No. 1 on the R&B Albums chart for five weeks, No. 3 on the Pop charts, and would go on to be certified 3x platinum. It also brought Franklin another Grammy for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album, as well as three Grammy nominations.

In 1996, Franklin's song "Joy" was recorded by [[Whitney Houston]] and the [[Georgia Mass Choir]]. With production by Houston and Mervyn Warren, the composition was included on the best-selling gospel album of all time, soundtrack to ''[[The Preacher's Wife]].''

On November 2, 1998, God's Property sued Franklin. The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles [[Superior Court]], alleges that Franklin induced God's Property founder Linda Searight into signing an "onerous and one-sided" contract with [[GospoCentric Records|B-Rite Music]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

''[[The Nu Nation Project]]'' was released in 1998.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071231040314/http://www.rhapsody.com/kirkfranklin/6807337_thenunationproject Free Music: The Nu Nation Project by Kirk Franklin]. Rhapsody Online</ref> The first single, "[[Lean on Me (Kirk Franklin song)|Lean on Me]]", produced by Franklin and pop producer [[Dan Shea (Record Producer)|Dan Shea]], controversially featured several mainstream artists, including [[R. Kelly]], [[Mary J. Blige]] and [[Bono]] of [[U2]] together with [[Crystal Lewis]] and The Family. "[[Lean on Me (Kirk Franklin song)|Lean on Me]]" and the second single "Revolution" (featuring [[Rodney Jerkins]]) were considerable hits, and the album contained a version of a Bill Withers song "[[Lovely Day (song)|Gonna Be a Lovely Day]]". ''[[The Nu Nation Project]]'' went on to top the ''Billboard'' Contemporary Christian Albums chart for 23 weeks and the ''Billboard'' Gospel Albums chart for 49 weeks, and brought Franklin his third Grammy.

Also in 1998, Franklin had made a guest appearance on the hit television sitcom ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sister, Sister (TV Series) : My Father's House (1998) : Full Cast & Crew |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701752/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm#cast |access-date=February 2, 2016 |publisher=IMDb}}</ref>

In 2000, members of The Family filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit for royalties for their work on ''The Nu Nation Project'' against Franklin and GospoCentric Records.<ref name="rocknet" /> This saw the end of the "Kirk Franklin & The Family" records, as Kirk went on to become a solo artist, except for his CD ''[[Kirk Franklin Presents 1NC]]'', which he did in collaboration with [[One Nation Crew]] and recording the live portion 'Rebirth' in June 2000 at Lakewood Church with The Vocals of Life which were both done that same year.

On January 16, 2010 at the 25th Annual [[Stellar Awards]] show taping in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Kirk Franklin & The Family reunited briefly on stage to perform songs made popular by them in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

=== Solo artist (2001–present) ===

''[[The Rebirth of Kirk Franklin]]'' was released in February 2002 after Franklin worked on more songs and modified the original live recorded songs from 2000 to October 2001. It topped the Gospel Albums chart for 29 weeks, was No. 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and was certified Platinum. The album featured collaborations with [[T.D. Jakes|Bishop T.D. Jakes]], [[Shirley Caesar]], [[Willie Neal Johnson & The Gospel Keynotes|Willie Neal Johnson]], [[TobyMac]], Crystal Lewis, [[Jaci Velasquez]], [[Papa San]], [[Alvin Slaughter]], and [[Yolanda Adams]].

After [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] aired the 2019 [[GMA Dove Award]]s on October 20, 2019, Franklin commented that his acceptance speech was edited to remove comments he made in relation to the [[killing of Atatiana Jefferson]] by a police officer.

GMA president, Jackie Patillo, apologized to Franklin and GMA made an unedited version of the speech available but stated that it was an unintentional action and that they were attempting to reduce the running time to meet a two-hour time-slot. Several other artists supported Franklin's boycott.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 29, 2019 |title=Black Musicians Are Standing Behind Kirk Franklin's Boycott Of Evangelical TV Network |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kirk-franklin-dove-awards-tbn_n_5db848f1e4b036b6a1672803 |website=HuffPost}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=GMA Pres Jackie Patillo Apologizes to Kirk Franklin for Dove Awards Speech Editing 'Missteps' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8541195/gma-pres-jackie-patillo-apologizes-kirk-franklin-dove-awards-speech |website=Billboard}}</ref>
