'''Richard Charles Rodgers''' (June 28, 1902&nbsp;– December 30, 1979) was an American [[Musical composition|compose]]r, known largely for his work in musical theater. With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, Rodgers was one of the most significant American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant influence on popular music.  

He is best known for his songwriting partnerships with the lyricist [[Lorenz Hart]], with whom he wrote many musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', ''[[On Your Toes]]'' and ''[[Babes in Arms]];'' and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s, such as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. His collaborations with Hammerstein, in particular, are celebrated for bringing the Broadway musical to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused around characters and drama rather than the light-hearted entertainment that the genre was known for beforehand. 

Rodgers was the first person to win all of what are considered the top American entertainment awards in theater, film, recording, and television – a [[Tony Award|Tony]], an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], and an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]— now known collectively as an [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8511880/richard-rodgers-egot-winner-first-flashback|title= In 1962, Richard Rodgers Became the First EGOT (Before That Was Even a Thing)|website= billboard.com|access-date= April 25, 2020}}</ref> In addition, he was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]], making him one of only two people to receive all five awards ([[Marvin Hamlisch]] is the other).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/richard-rodgers-and-oscar-hammerstein-ii|title= Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II|website= pulitzer.org|access-date= April 25, 2020}}</ref> In 1978, Rodgers was in the inaugural group of those awarded a [[The Kennedy Center Honors]] for his lifetime achievement in the arts.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=cbs&p=761&item=100561|title= KENNEDY CENTER HONORS 1978|website= paleycenter.org|access-date= April 25, 2020}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
[[File:Fly_With_Me_poster.jpg|thumb|The poster for ''Fly With Me'', the 1920 Columbia University [[Varsity Show]]. The music was cowritten by Rodgers and [[Lorenz Hart]], and also included songs by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], making the show one of the first collaborations between the two men.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sing a Song of Morningside|url=https://www.thevarsityshow.com/about-sing-a-song-of-morningside|access-date=2021-08-28|website=The Varsity Show|language=en-US}}</ref>]]
Born into a Jewish family in Queens, New York, Rodgers was the son of Mamie (Levy) and Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers, a prominent physician who had changed the family name from Rogazinsky. Rodgers began playing the piano at the age of six. He attended P.S. 166, Townsend Harris Hall and [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. Rodgers spent his early teenage summers in Camp Wigwam ([[Waterford, Maine]]) where he composed some of his first songs.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hyland-rodgers.html Hyland, William G: ''Richard Rodgers''] ''The New York Times'', Chapter 1. Yale University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07115-9}}</ref>

Rodgers, [[Lorenz Hart]], and later collaborator [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] all attended [[Columbia University]]. At Columbia, Rodgers joined the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity. In 1921, Rodgers shifted his studies to the Institute of Musical Art (now the [[Juilliard School]]).<ref>Richard Rodgers, ''Musical Stages: An Autobiography'' (2002 Reissue),  pp. 12,20–21,44, DaCapo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-81134-0}}</ref> Rodgers was influenced by composers such as [[Victor Herbert]] and [[Jerome Kern]], as well as by the [[operetta]]s his parents took him to see on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] when he was a child.

===Career===

====Rodgers and Hart====
{{Main|Rodgers and Hart}}
[[File:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Rodgers (seated) with [[Lorenz Hart]] in 1936]]
In 1919, Richard met [[Lorenz Hart]], thanks to Phillip Levitt, a friend of Richard's older brother. [[Rodgers and Hart]] struggled for years in the field of musical comedy, writing several amateur shows. They made their professional debut with the song "Any Old Place With You", featured in the 1919 Broadway musical comedy ''A Lonely Romeo''. Their first professional production was the 1920 ''[[Poor Little Ritz Girl]]'', which also had music by [[Sigmund Romberg]]. Their next professional show, ''The Melody Man'', did not premiere until 1924.

When he was just out of college Rodgers worked as musical director for [[Lew Fields]]. Among the stars he accompanied were [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Fred Allen]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VVpeiKxbHk Rodgers & Hammerstein as mystery guests on What's My Line?], February 19, 1956, video on YouTube</ref> Rodgers was considering quitting show business altogether to sell children's underwear, when he and Hart finally broke through in 1925. They wrote the songs for a benefit show presented by the prestigious [[Theatre Guild]], called ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', and the critics found the show fresh and delightful. Only meant to run one day, the Guild knew they had a success and allowed it to re-open later. The show's biggest hit—the song that Rodgers believed "made" Rodgers and Hart—was "[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]". The two were now a Broadway songwriting force.

Throughout the rest of the decade, the duo wrote several hit shows for both Broadway and London, including ''[[Dearest Enemy]]'' (1925), ''[[The Girl Friend]]'' (1926), ''[[Peggy-Ann]]'' (1926), ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'' (1927), and ''[[Present Arms (musical)|Present Arms]]'' (1928).  Their 1920s shows produced standards such as "[[Here in My Arms]]", "[[Mountain Greenery]]", "[[Blue Room (1926 song)|Blue Room]]", "[[My Heart Stood Still]]" and "[[You Took Advantage of Me]]".

With the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in full swing during the first half of the 1930s, the team sought greener pastures in Hollywood. The hardworking Rodgers later regretted these relatively fallow years, but he and Hart did write some classic songs and film scores while out west, including ''[[Love Me Tonight]]'' (1932) (directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who would later direct Rodgers's ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' on Broadway), which introduced three standards: "[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]", "[[Mimi (song)|Mimi]]", and "[[Isn't It Romantic?]]". Rodgers also wrote a melody for which Hart wrote three consecutive lyrics which either were cut, not recorded or not a hit. The fourth lyric resulted in one of their most famous songs, "[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]". Other film work includes the scores to ''[[The Phantom President]]'' (1932), starring [[George M. Cohan]], ''[[Hallelujah, I'm a Bum (film)|Hallelujah, I’m a Bum]]'' (1933), starring [[Al Jolson]], and, in a quick return after having left Hollywood, ''Mississippi'' (1935), starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[W. C. Fields]].

In 1935, they returned to Broadway and wrote an almost unbroken string of hit shows that ended shortly before Hart's death in 1943. Among the most notable are ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]'' (1935), ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, which included the ballet "[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]", choreographed by George Balanchine), ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[I Married an Angel]]'' (1938), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938), ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940), and their last original work, ''[[By Jupiter]]'' (1942). Rodgers also contributed to the book on several of these shows.

Many of the songs from these shows are still sung and remembered, including "[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1935 song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]", "[[My Romance (song)|My Romance]]", "[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]", "[[I'll Tell the Man in the Street]]", "[[There's a Small Hotel]]", "[[Where or When]]", "[[My Funny Valentine]]", "[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]", "[[Falling in Love with Love]]", "[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]", and "[[Wait till You See Her]]".

In 1939, Rodgers wrote the ballet ''Ghost Town'' for the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], with choreography by [[Marc Platt (dancer)|Marc Platoff]].<ref>Anna Kisselgoff, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E1D9173CF930A15753C1A9649C8B63 "DANCE REVIEW; Rodgers As Ideal Dance Partner"], ''The New York Times'', October 23, 2002.</ref>

====Rodgers and Hammerstein====
{{Main|Rodgers and Hammerstein}}
[[File:Rodgers and Hammerstein at piano-original.jpg|thumb|Rodgers (seated) with Hammerstein, 1945]]
Rodgers' partnership with Hart began having problems because of the lyricist's unreliability and declining health. Rodgers began working with [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he had previously written songs (before ever working with Lorenz Hart). Their first musical, the groundbreaking hit ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), marked the beginning of the most successful partnership in American musical theatre history. Their work revolutionized the musical form. What was once a collection of songs, dances and comic turns held together by a tenuous plot became a fully integrated piece.

The team went on to create four more hits that are among the most popular in musical history. Each was made into a successful film: ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949, winner of the 1950 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951), and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959). Other shows include the minor hit ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' (1958), as well as relative failures ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'' (1947), ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' (1953), and ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'' (1955). They also wrote the score to the film ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'' (1945) (which was remade in 1962 with [[Pat Boone]]) and a special TV musical of ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957).

Their collaboration produced many well-known songs, including "[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]", "[[People Will Say We're in Love]]", "[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]" (which also became the state song of Oklahoma), "It's A Grand Night For Singing", "[[If I Loved You]]", "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]", "[[It Might as Well Be Spring]]", "[[Some Enchanted Evening]]", "[[Younger Than Springtime]]", "[[Bali Hai]]", "[[Getting to Know You (song)|Getting to Know You]]", "[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]", "[[The Sound of Music (song)|The Sound of Music]]", "[[Sixteen Going on Seventeen]]", "[[Climb Ev'ry Mountain]]", "[[Do-Re-Mi]]", and "[[Edelweiss (song)|Edelweiss]]", Hammerstein's last song.
[[File:Richard Rodgers Ed Sullivan 1952.JPG|thumb|Rodgers was the subject of a two-part special on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s ''Toast of the Town'' television show in 1952.]]
Much of Rodgers' work with both Hart and Hammerstein was orchestrated by [[Robert Russell Bennett]]. Rodgers composed twelve themes, which Bennett used in preparing the orchestra score for the 26-episode [[World War II]] television documentary ''[[Victory at Sea]]'' (1952–53). This [[NBC]] production pioneered the "compilation documentary"—programming based on pre-existing footage—and was eventually broadcast in dozens of countries. The melody of the popular song "[[No Other Love (1953 song)|No Other Love]]" was later taken from the ''Victory at Sea'' theme entitled "Beneath the Southern Cross".  Rodgers won an [[Emmy]] for the music for the ABC documentary ''[[The Valiant Years|Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years]]'', scored by [[Eddie Sauter]], [[Hershy Kay]], and [[Robert Emmett Dolan]]. Rodgers composed the theme music, "[[March of the Clowns]]", for the 1963–64 television series ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which ran for 30 episodes. He also contributed the main-title theme for the 1963–64 historical anthology television series [[The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series)|''The Great Adventure'']].

In 1950, [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award "in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York." Rodgers, Hammerstein, and [[Joshua Logan]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''South Pacific''.<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama "Drama"]. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved December 3, 2013.</ref> Rodgers and Hammerstein had won a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special Pulitzer Prize]] in 1944 for ''Oklahoma!''.<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Special-Awards-and-Citations "Special Awards and Citations"]. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved December 3, 2013.</ref>

In 1954, Rodgers conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] in excerpts from ''Victory at Sea'', ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]'' and the ''[[Carousel Waltz]]'' for a special LP released by [[Columbia Records]].

[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musicals earned a total of 37 [[Tony Award]]s, 15 [[Academy Awards]], two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, two [[Grammy Award]]s, and two [[Emmy Award]]s.

====After Hammerstein====
After Hammerstein's death in 1960, Rodgers wrote both words and music for his first new Broadway project ''[[No Strings]]'' (1962, which earned two Tony Awards). The show was a minor hit and featured the song, "[[The Sweetest Sounds (song)|The Sweetest Sounds]]".

Rodgers also wrote both the words and music for two new songs used in the film version of [[The Sound of Music (film)|''The Sound of Music'']]. (Other songs in that film were from Rodgers and Hammerstein.)

Rodgers went on to work with lyricists: [[Stephen Sondheim]] (''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'') who was a protégé of Hammerstein, [[Martin Charnin]] (''[[Two by Two (musical)|Two by Two]],'' ''[[I Remember Mama (musical)|I Remember Mama]]'') and [[Sheldon Harnick]] (''[[Rex (musical)|Rex]]'').

At its 1978 commencement ceremonies, [[Barnard College]] awarded Rodgers its highest honor, the [[List of Barnard College people#Recipients of the Medal of Distinction|Barnard Medal of Distinction]].

Rodgers was an honoree at the first [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1978.

At the 1979 Tony Awards ceremony—six months before his death—Rodgers was presented the Lawrence Langner Memorial Award for Distinguished Lifetime Achievement in the American Theatre.

====Death and legacy====
Rodgers died in 1979, aged 77, after surviving cancer of the jaw, a heart attack, and a [[laryngectomy]]. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.

In 1990, the 46th Street Theatre was renamed the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] in his memory. In 1999, Rodgers and Hart were each commemorated on United States postage stamps. In 2002, the centennial year of Rodgers' birth was celebrated worldwide with books, retrospectives, performances, new recordings of his music, and a Broadway revival of ''Oklahoma!''. The [[BBC Proms]] that year devoted an entire evening to Rodgers' music, including a concert performance of ''Oklahoma!'' The [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] released a new CD that year in tribute to Rodgers, entitled ''My Favorite Things: A Richard Rodgers Celebration''.

[[Alec Wilder]] wrote the following about Rodgers:

{{quote|Of all the writers whose songs are considered and examined in this book, those of Rodgers show the highest degree of consistent excellence, inventiveness, and sophistication ... [A]fter spending weeks playing his songs, I am more than impressed and respectful: I am astonished.<ref>Wilder, Alec, 1973. ''American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900–1950'', Oxford University Press: 163. {{ISBN|0-19-501445-6}}.</ref>}}

Rodgers is a member of the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaterhalloffame.org/members.html|title=Theater Hall of Fame members|access-date=February 9, 2014}}</ref>

Along with the Academy of Arts and Letters, Rodgers also started and endowed an award for non-established musical theater composers to produce new productions either by way of full productions or staged readings. It is the only award for which the Academy of Arts and Letters accepts applications and is presented every year.

[[File:Rodgers and Hammerstein and Berlin and Tamiris NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|Rodgers and Hammerstein and Berlin and Tamiris NYWTS]]
[[Rosemary Clooney]] recorded a version of "[[Falling in Love with Love]]" by Rodgers, using a swing style. After the recording session Richard Rodgers told her pointedly that it should be sung as a waltz.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Fine Romance|last=Lehman |first=David |year=2009|publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8052-4250-8|page=140,249 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nYWq-8qjHMC&q=A+Fine+Romance}}</ref> The 1961 [[doo-wop]] arrangement of the Rodgers and Hart song "Blue Moon" by [[The Marcels]] so incensed Rodgers that he took out full page newspaper ads urging people not to buy it. His efforts were unsuccessful as it reached #1 on the charts.<ref>[http://www.uncamarvy.com/Marcels/marcels.html The Marcels By Marv Goldberg] Marv Goldberg 2006. 2009.</ref> After [[Doris Day]] recorded "[[I Have Dreamed (song)|I Have Dreamed]]" in 1961, he wrote to her and her arranger, Jim Harbert, that theirs was the most beautiful rendition of his song he had ever heard.

After [[Peggy Lee]] recorded her version of "[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]", a Rodgers song, with a dramatically different arrangement from that originally conceived by him, Rodgers said, "I don't know why Peggy picked on me, she could have fucked up [[Silent Night]]".<ref>Lehman, p. 140.</ref>  [[Mary Martin]] said that Richard Rodgers composed songs for her for ''South Pacific'', knowing she had a small vocal range, and the songs generally made her look her best. She also said that Rodgers and Hammerstein listened to all her suggestions and she worked extremely well with them.<ref>Lehman, p. 142–43.</ref> Both Rodgers and Hammerstein wanted Doris Day for the lead in the film version of ''South Pacific'' and she reportedly wanted the part.  They discussed it with her, but after her manager/husband [[Martin Melcher]] would not budge on his demand for a high salary for her, the role went to [[Mitzi Gaynor]].

===Personal life===
In 1930, Rodgers married [[Dorothy Rodgers|Dorothy Belle Feiner]] (1909–92).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rnh.com/bio/46/Rodgers-Dorothy|title=Dorothy Rodgers|website=Rodgers and Hammerstein|access-date=April 15, 2017}}</ref> Their daughter, [[Mary Rodgers|Mary]] (1931–2014), was the composer of ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'' and an author of children's books.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.playbill.com/article/mary-rodgers-composer-of-once-upon-a-mattress-and-daughter-of-broadway-royalty-dies-at-83-com-322981| title=Mary Rodgers, Composer of Once Upon a Mattress and Daughter of Broadway Royalty, Dies at 83| journal=[[Playbill]]|author-link1=Robert Simonson| last=Simonson| first=Robert| date=June 26, 2014| access-date=August 23, 2018}}</ref> The Rodgers' later lost a daughter at birth. Another daughter, Linda (1935–2015), also had a brief career as a [[songwriter]].  Mary's son and Richard Rodgers's grandson, [[Adam Guettel]] (b. 1964), also a musical theatre composer, won Tony Awards for Best Score and Best Orchestrations for ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'' in 2005. [[Peter Melnick]] (b. 1958), Linda Rodgers's son, is the composer of ''Adrift In Macao,'' which debuted at the Philadelphia Theatre Company in 2005 and was produced [[Off-Broadway]] in 2007.

Rodgers was an [[atheist]].<ref>Rodgers' biographer William G Hyland states: "That Richard Rodgers would recall, at the very beginning of his memoirs, his great-grandmother's death and its religious significance for his family suggests his need to justify his own religious alienation. Richard became an atheist, and as a parent he resisted religious instruction for his children. According to his wife, Dorothy, he felt that religion was based on "fear" and contributed to "feelings of guilt." " ''Richard Rodgers'', Yale University Press 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07115-9}}. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hyland-rodgers.html Chapter 1] at ''The New York Times'' Books (accessed April 30, 2008).</ref> He was prone to depression and alcohol abuse, and was at one time hospitalized.

==Wider influence==
{{in popular culture|date=December 2020}}
*The Internet Movie Database lists 276 film and TV soundtracks using songs by Rodgers, as well as 46 films and TV events that credit him as the composer.
*In 1960, the [[saxophonist]] [[John Coltrane]] recorded a jazz version of "[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]" from ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' whose rich [[musical mode|modal]] improvisations proved germane. The tune became a regular part of his repertoire.
*The entry "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]" (from ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'') discusses in detail the many cover versions of this song, and its extraordinary popularity with professional soccer teams and their fans. It was first adopted by Liverpool fans in November 1963, following a cover by Gerry and the Pacemakers, and then widely copied by other fans since then as their anthem.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincentelli |first1=Elisabeth |title='You'll Never Walk Alone': From Broadway Tear-Jerker to Covid-Era Anthem |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/arts/music/youll-never-walk-alone-carousel-coronavirus.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 27, 2020 |access-date=March 2, 2021}}</ref>
*[[Jerry Lewis]] ended his [[Labor Day]] telethon by singing "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]".
*"[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]" from ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' is sometimes mistaken for a traditional folk song, as is "[[Edelweiss (song)|Edelweiss]]" from ''[[The Sound of Music]]''.
*"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]" is covered by Daniel Johnston and Jad Fair. Captain Sensible did a jaunty rendition in the 1980s, complete with burlesque organ. The British rapper [[Dizzee Rascal]] uses the chorus of this song.
*Several professional awards in musical theater are named for Rodgers.
