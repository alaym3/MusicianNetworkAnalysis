==Career==
Mira first came in contact with producers [[Taz Taylor (record producer)|Taz Taylor]] and DT in 2016, forming relationships with them based on their common method of selling and promoting their beats on platforms such as [[YouTube]] and [[SoundCloud]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=September 25, 2020|title=This Is Just the Beginning For Internet Money|url=https://notion.online/internet-money-interview/|access-date=June 3, 2021|website=Notion|language=en-GB}}</ref> The trio proceeded to join forces in a collective label that would become what is now known as Internet Money, whose mission is to bring awareness to lesser known producers while uniting them with potential collaborators and artists.<ref name=":2" />

While Mira began his producing career by primarily selling beats online, he has noted that his methods have changed over time, stating that creating a "good time and vibe" removes pressure from the creation of music.<ref name=":32">{{Citation|title=Internet Money Talks New Album, Being Turned Down By Labels + More: Carton Conversations S1E1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdKUvS1wQ-E|language=en|access-date=June 3, 2021}}</ref>

In 2017, he, along with [[Taz Taylor (record producer)|Taz Taylor]] and Dex Duncan, got his first major placement in [[XXXTentacion]]'s [[Trippie Redd]]-assisted single "[[Fuck Love]]". It entered at number 41 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and eventually peaked at number 28 after X's death. On March 29, 2019, the song became the most streamed song ever on the streaming platform [[SoundCloud]] with 206 million streams. Mira began working with Juice Wrld after becoming acquainted with him through their mutual friend and fellow producer, Sidepce. "[[Lucid Dreams (Juice Wrld song)|Lucid Dreams]]" was created after Mira produced the instrumental and sent it to Juice Wrld, who recorded vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/nick-mira-breaks-down-juicewrlds-lucid-dreams-instrumental-new-video.43830.html|title=Nick Mira Breaks Down JuiceWRLD's "Lucid Dreams" Instrumental|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> The song peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, has sold over 14 million certified units worldwide and was certified 5-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].

Mira met Chicago rapper [[Jarad Higgins]], known professionally as Juice WRLD, in 2016 through their mutual friend Sidepce, who also eventually became a producer for Internet Money. While Juice WRLD would proceed to debut several albums at number one on the [[Billboard 200]] charts, Mira stated at the time that he believed the rapper "had like 300 followers on Soundcloud".<ref name=":13"/> Mira began to send beats to Juice WRLD online, and helped produce the tracks [[All Girls Are the Same]], Lucid Dreams, [[Lean wit Me|Lean Wit Me]], I'm Still, Candles, Used To, Hurt Me, End Of the Road, and I'll Be Fine on his 2018 debut album [[Goodbye & Good Riddance|Goodbye and Good Riddance]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Goodbye & Good Riddance by Juice WRLD|url=https://genius.com/albums/Juice-wrld/Goodbye-good-riddance|access-date=June 3, 2021|website=Genius|language=en}}</ref>

Mira and Juice WRLD's working relationship continued on the 2019 commercial project [[Death Race for Love|Death Race For Love]]. After the success of Goodbye and Good Riddance, Mira continued to frequently create and send collections of beats to the rapper, and estimated that the duo had over 100 unreleased songs in 2019.<ref name=":4">{{Cite magazine|title=Nick Mira and Purps On The Beat Break Down Their Contributions To Juice WRLD's 'Death Race for Love'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8504496/nick-mira-and-purps-on-the-beat-interview-juice-wrld-death-race-production/|access-date=June 3, 2021|magazine=Billboard|language=en}}</ref> Mira noted that the project represented a step forward in both Juice WRLD's and Mira's artistry, and attributed the development of their sound to the experience they had gained by working with each other.<ref name=":4" /> Mira also credited [[Hardcore punk|hardcore rock]] bands as influences for the album's sound.<ref name=":4" /> On March 8, 2019, Death Race For Love was officially released, on which Mira contributed production for four tracks, including commercial standouts Empty and [[Robbery (Juice Wrld song)|Robbery]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Death Race for Love by Juice WRLD|url=https://genius.com/albums/Juice-wrld/Death-race-for-love|access-date=June 3, 2021|website=Genius|language=en}}</ref> The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart on March 14, 2019, with first-week sales of 165,000 [[Album-equivalent unit|album equivalents]] sold.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The First Week Numbers for Juice WRLD's 'Death Race for Love' Are Here|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/03/juice-wrld-death-race-for-love-debuts-at-no-1|access-date=June 3, 2021|website=Complex|language=en}}</ref>

== Musical Style ==
While Mira has generally created beats for hip-hop artists, he has ventured into other styles and genres as well, and has produced on [[Machine Gun Kelly (musician)|Machine Gun Kelly]]'s [[pop-punk]] album [[Tickets to My Downfall]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Machine Gun Kelly – drunk face|url=https://genius.com/Machine-gun-kelly-drunk-face-lyrics|access-date=June 3, 2021}}</ref> Mira has described his production style as "melodic", "dynamic", and "spacious".<ref name=":04"/> He has credited inspiration to artists [[Kanye West]], [[Metro Boomin]], [[Lex Luger (musician)|Lex Luger]], and [[Sonny Digital]], who have each made a significant impact on hip-hop production.<ref name=":13"/>

'''Influence:'''

Along with other fellow Internet Money members, Mira has been credited by some with the rise in popularity of "type beats", which aim to increase the popularity of an instrumental by associating it with well-known artists. While this has sparked some controversy around Internet Money's marketing methods, Mira has explained that his creative process is focused mainly on what he finds appealing, and that the "type beat" method used to tag artists is only based on artists he feels would fit on his instrumental.<ref name=":04"/>

As someone who began producing at a young age, Mira has commented on the popularity of [[Digital audio workstation|Digital Audio Workstation]] software among the youth population, stating that "producing is the new video game."<ref>{{Citation|title=Nick Mira Plays Beat Saber In VR & Talks Process In The Studio {{!}} Game Break|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOX9xu07WVI|language=en|access-date=June 3, 2021}}</ref>

Mira has advocated for the importance of working with smaller, up-and-coming artists, in order to build their fan bases and allow them to grow along with the Internet Money label. He has also discussed the value of working with artists in the studio as opposed to virtually, regardless of the size or success of the artist.<ref name=":32"/>
