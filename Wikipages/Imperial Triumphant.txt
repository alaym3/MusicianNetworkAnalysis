'''Imperial Triumphant''' is an American [[experimental metal]] band formed in 2005 in New York City.

==History==
Imperial Triumphant was formed in 2005 by Zachary Ilya Ezrin in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |title=Imperial Triumphant |url=https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Imperial_Triumphant/3540255740 |website=Encyclopaedia Metallum - The Metal Archives |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>

Imperial Triumphant's second album, ''Abyssal Gods'', was released in March 2015. Described by No Clean Singing's Austin Weber, "''Abyssal Gods'', is overall a thoroughly vicious act of blasphemy packed with more memorable moments than many bands accumulate in a lifetime of albums". Commenting on the band's effort to date as a whole, Weber stated "Imperial Triumphant are not only one of the most important U.S. black metal acts currently active, truly carving their own stylistic path, but they are also important to the future of black metal."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weber |first1=Austin |title=AN NCS PREMIERE: IMPERIAL TRIUMPHANT — "KROKODIL" |url=https://www.nocleansinging.com/2015/02/16/an-ncs-premiere-imperial-triumphant-krokodil/?fbclid=IwAR0FgA7YzrtWqCixTcFjLkg4Di93tcIlkUAVIjp4kxnfb_nzp6sSiGw6jAc |website=No Clean Singing |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Imperial Triumphant's musical style has changed since formation in 2005 to encompass musical and lyrical influence from their home city of New York. Commenting on the release of ''Vile Luxury'' in 2018, Ezrin described the record as "our most refined and metropolitan release to date",<ref name="loudersound1">{{cite web |title=Enter the weird and frankly worrying world of Imperial Triumphant |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/enter-the-weird-and-frankly-worrying-world-of-avant-black-metal-troupe-imperial-triumphant |website=Louder Sound - Metal Hammer |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref> commenting further that the band had taken "the New York City influence that shaped the world, embraced the aspect of our sonic pyramid that at its core comes from [[jazz]], and applied it to [[black metal]]".<ref name="loudersound1" />
