Everett also attended Texas A&M University. One night after playing with his band in a bar, Everett felt moved by God, which led him to quit his band and start attending church regularly.<ref name="cbnmus07"/> Shortly thereafter, he met Barnard, and became part of Breakaway Ministries, a weekly student-led praise and worship service at Texas A&M.

=== Band ===
The band originally began with Barnard performing solo acts, but Everett increasingly played a major role in his performances.<ref name="cbnmus07" /> In 2002, the band released their first album, ''Psalms'', under the new name "Shane & Shane".<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shane-shane-mn0000161166/biography|title=Shane & Shane {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=November 16, 2018}}</ref> The duo continued to release albums in the following years, including ''Carry Away'' (2003), ''Upstairs'' (2004), and ''Clean'' (2004). The duo went on hiatus for a year after the release of ''An Evening With Shane & Shane'', a live CD/DVD. Following the hiatus, the group released five albums in the next six years, including ''The One You Need'' (2011), which charted at No. 53 on the [[Billboard 200]], making it their highest charting album.<ref name=":0" /> ''The One You Need'' was also the first album released under the [[Fair Trade Services|Fair Trade]] record label.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/shane-shane/chart-history/billboard-200|title=Shane & Shane Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=November 16, 2018}}</ref>

In 2014, following a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shaneandshane/the-worship-initiative|title=The Worship Initiative|website=Kickstarter|access-date=January 18, 2018}}</ref> Shane & Shane launched a project, "The Worship Initiative", a paid membership website with instructional videos and chord charts for popular worship songs.
