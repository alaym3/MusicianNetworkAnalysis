'''Catherine Zeta-Jones''' {{post-nominals|country=UK|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|t|ə}}; born 25 September 1969){{efn|name=A}} is a Welsh actress. She is the recipient of [[List of roles and awards of Catherine Zeta-Jones#Awards and nominations|several accolades]], including an [[Academy Award]], [[BAFTA Award]], [[Tony Award]] and three awards from the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. In 2010, she was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for her film and humanitarian work.

Born and raised in [[Swansea]], Zeta-Jones aspired to be an actress from a young age. As a child, she played roles in the [[West End theatre|West End]] productions of the musicals ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' and ''[[Bugsy Malone]]''. She studied musical theatre at the [[Arts Educational Schools, London]] and made her stage breakthrough with a leading role in a 1987 production of ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]''. Her screen debut came in the unsuccessful French-Italian film ''[[1001 Nights (1990 film)|1001 Nights]]'' (1990), and she went on to find greater success as a regular in the British television series ''[[The Darling Buds of May (TV series)|The Darling Buds of May]]'' (1991–1993). Dismayed at being [[Typecasting|typecast]] as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles. She established herself in Hollywood with roles that highlighted her sex appeal, such as in the action film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' (1998) and the heist film ''[[Entrapment (film)|Entrapment]]'' (1999).

Zeta-Jones received critical acclaim for her performances as a vengeful pregnant woman in ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' (2000) and a murderous singer in the musical ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' (2002), winning the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for the latter. She starred in high-profile films for much of the decade, including the black comedy ''[[Intolerable Cruelty]]'' (2003), the heist film ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' (2004), the comedy ''[[The Terminal]]'' (2004), and the romantic comedy ''[[No Reservations (film)|No Reservations]]'' (2007). Parts in smaller-scale features were followed by a decrease in workload, during which she returned to the stage and played an ageing actress in ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (2009), winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical|Tony Award]]. Zeta-Jones continued to work in the 2010s, starring in the films ''[[Side Effects (2013 film)|Side Effects]]'' (2013), ''[[Red 2 (film)|Red 2]]'' (2013) and ''[[Dad's Army (2016 film)|Dad's Army]]'' (2016), as well as the television miniseries ''[[Feud (TV series)|Feud: Bette & Joan]]'' (2017), in which she portrayed actress [[Olivia de Havilland]].

Aside from acting, Zeta-Jones is a prominent brand endorser and supports various charitable causes. Her struggle with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[bipolar II disorder]] has been well documented by the media. She is married to actor [[Michael Douglas]], with whom she has two children.

Zeta-Jones returned to stage in 2009 with a revival of the musical ''[[A Little Night Music]]'', which marked her Broadway debut. Set in Sweden during the early twentieth century, the musical follows the relationships between three people (Zeta-Jones, [[Angela Lansbury]] and Alexander Hanson) during the course of a summer. She played Desirée Armfeldt, an ageing actress, and was particularly drawn to the complexities of the musical, saying, "There's no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings,&nbsp;... It's not one of those shows where you can dig about three inches and come out the other end. You can keep digging and digging and digging".<ref name="nytimes"/> She did not listen to past recordings of the songs in the play so she could bring her own interpretation to them.<ref name="nytimes"/> The critic Claire Prentice of ''The Daily Telegraph'' wrote that Zeta-Jones brought in a "quiet, reflective poignancy" in her rendition of the song "[[Send In the Clowns]]", but Emma Brocks of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was more critical, remarking that "with her pretty voice, head wresting this way and that, [she] seems to be auditioning for stage school".<ref name="singing">{{cite news|author=Brocks, Emma |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/14/catherine-zeta-jones-broadway-musical |title=Singing and acting, but not at the same time – Zeta-Jones falters on Broadway |work=The Guardian |date=14 December 2009 |access-date=14 August 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802024940/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/14/catherine-zeta-jones-broadway-musical |archive-date=2 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/6808914/A-Little-Night-Music-at-the-Walter-Kerr-Theatre-review.html |title=A Little Night Music at the Walter Kerr Theatre, review |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=14 December 2009 |access-date=14 August 2015 |first=Claire |last=Prentice |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823191638/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/6808914/A-Little-Night-Music-at-the-Walter-Kerr-Theatre-review.html |archive-date=23 August 2015}}</ref> For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical]] and the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10306757 |title=Catherine Zeta Jones wins Tony Award |work=BBC News |date=14 June 2010 |access-date=28 January 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408040747/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10306757 |archive-date=8 April 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gans |first=Andrew |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/winners-of-55th-annual-drama-desk-awards-will-be-presented-trophies-sept-16-com-171740 |title=Winners of 55th Annual Drama Desk Awards Will Be Presented Trophies Sept. 16 |work=Playbill |date=14 September 2010 |access-date=30 May 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701051527/http://www.playbill.com/article/winners-of-55th-annual-drama-desk-awards-will-be-presented-trophies-sept-16-com-171740 |archive-date=1 July 2016}}</ref>
