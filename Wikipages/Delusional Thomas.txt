Miller's album sound and lyrics were also likely influenced by his heavy drug use. In his song "The Jesuits" Miller talks about "black tar demons".<ref name=":0">{{Citation|title=Delusional Thomas (Ft.

''Delusional Thomas'' was met with generally positive reviews from [[music critic]]s. Jake Rohn of [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] stated, "Regardless of who he is in any given moment, Mac Miller is one of the most lyrically gifted MCs in hip hop. He continues to add something new and different. ''Delusional Thomas''' only drawback is that every song has a similar sound, but for the tatted up rhymer's true fans, it won't matter. This mixtape is not for the squeamish and definitely is not for those that only like Top 40 rap. For everyone else, it's hip hop noir at its finest. With only ten short songs, it's just the right amount of time to keep the listener fully engaged."<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

Bruce Smith of [[HipHopDX]] deemed the mixtape "EP-worthy" saying, "Getting past Mac Miller's bouts of immaturity and voice as "Delusional Thomas" is a chore and can be trying. But hidden behind those flaws is a good mixtape."<ref name="hiphopdx1" /> Drew Millard of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' referred to the mixtape as the best project of Miller's career.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Rob Markman of [[MTV]] stated, "the real strength in the ''Delusional Thomas'' project is showing all the versatility and diversity that Mac has to offer."<ref name="autogenerated3"/>
