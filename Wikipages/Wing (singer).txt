'''Wing Han Tsang''' ({{zh|c=曾咏韓|p=Zēng Yǒnghán}}; b. 1960), popularly known simply as '''Wing''', is a [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]-born New Zealand singer. Her singing style has drawn comparisons to [[Florence Foster Jenkins]]<ref>{{Cite news| title = Wing wows New York's Birdland Jazz Club| newspaper = TVNZ| publisher = ONE News/NZPA| date = 27 October 2009|url = http://tvnz.co.nz/entertainment-news/wing-wows-new-york-jazz-club-3096116| accessdate = 17 January 2011}}</ref> and [[Mrs. Miller]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/24769/5-people-who-became-famous-singing-badly|title=5 People Who Became Famous By Singing Badly|date=12 August 2016|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> She is an example of [[outsider music]].

== Career ==
Having taken up singing as a hobby after emigrating to New Zealand, Wing gained an audience by entertaining patients at nursing homes and hospitals in and around [[Auckland]]. This prompted suggestions that she release a CD; the result was a debut titled ''Phantom of the Opera'', featuring the [[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|title song]] from the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] musical, and a selection of other popular tunes to the accompaniment of a programmed [[electronic keyboard]].

Despite her unconventional style the recording proved a success, leading to a number of subsequent releases of [[cover version]]s that eventually gained her an international audience.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Joy Behar New Year's Eve Live: with special Guest: Wing| location = SFStation.com| publisher = SF Station| date = December 2008| url = http://www.sfstation.com/joy-behar-new-years-eve-live-e463311| accessdate = 17 January 2011}}</ref>

She has appeared on such shows as ''[[SportsCafe]]'' and ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]''. She guest starred on ''[[South Park]]'' in an [[Wing (South Park)|episode named after her]] that was first broadcast in March 2005. On the DVD commentary for this episode, series creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] explain that she had to approve her cartoon likeness before allowing her music to be used. Parker also says he received a letter of thanks from her for the sales boost she enjoyed as a result of the episode.

In addition to recordings, Wing has made various appearances in New Zealand, like [[Massey University]] Orientation in [[Wellington]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22wing+sings%22|title="wing sings" – YouTube|via=YouTube|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref>
