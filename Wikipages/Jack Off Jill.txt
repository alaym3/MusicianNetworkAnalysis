'''Jack Off Jill''' was an American [[alternative rock]]<ref name="allmusic1"/> band from Fort Lauderdale, Florida founded in 1992 by vocalist [[Jessicka]], drummer Tenni Ah-Cha-Cha, [[Robin Moulder|Agent Moulder]], and guitarist Michelle Inhell. Though these four women were the initial founders, nine members rotated through the group in its life-span, including [[Scott Putesky]], guitarist and co-founder of [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. The band lasted three years, with only Jessicka remaining throughout, then reunited in 2015 for a number of shows.<ref name="ladygunn">{{cite web|url=http://ladygunn.com/music/your-favorite-riot-goth-band-jack-off-jill-is-reuniting|title=YOUR FAVORITE RIOT GOTH BAND JACK OFF JILL IS REUNITING.|date=7 April 2015|publisher=Ladygunn.com|access-date=10 April 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412013551/http://ladygunn.com/music/your-favorite-riot-goth-band-jack-off-jill-is-reuniting|archive-date=12 April 2015}}</ref>

==History==
Tenni Arslanyan met Jessicka while attending Piper High School in [[Sunrise, Florida]]. They had begun writing songs, but had not yet formed a band when Moulder and Inhell joined them to create the band that would become Jack Off Jill.

Jack Off Jill's first show was opening for [[Marilyn Manson]] and his shock-rock outfit, [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids]], at a [[Davie, Florida]] night club called The Plus Five Lounge. Manson went on to produce their early demos and had them open most of his shows.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ted B.

During this time the band served as the opening act for many female-fronted national acts such as [[Joan Jett]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[Silverfish (band)|Silverfish]], [[Tribe 8]], Fetchin' Bones and the [[Lunachicks]]. Singer Jessicka's on-stage antics included covering the audience with spit and real blood and candy.<ref name="miaminewtimes.com">{{cite web |author=Todd Anthony |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1993-07-07/news/distaff-of-life |title=Distaff of Life - Page 1 - News - Miami |publisher=Miami New Times |date=1993-07-07 |access-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309215953/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1993-07-07/news/distaff-of-life/ |archive-date=2012-03-09 }}</ref><ref>Pelletier, George.[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1997-11-27/music/paying-the-rant "Paying The Rant"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309220000/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1997-11-27/music/paying-the-rant/ |date=2012-03-09 }} [[Miami New Times]] feature, November 27, 1997.</ref> In early 1993, Jessicka performed with Manson's ephemeral [[side project]], Mrs. Scabtree.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1993-03-16/news/program-notes-48/|title=Program Notes 48|author=Greg Baker|date=23 October 2006|publisher=Miaminewtimes.com|access-date=19 December 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219194557/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1993-03-16/news/program-notes-48/|archive-date=19 December 2014}}</ref>

On December 27, 1994, Jack Off Jill joined Marilyn Manson on dates through Florida. While playing Club 5 in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], Manson and Jessicka were arrested for violating the town's adult entertainment codes. Neither singer was charged.<ref>Baker, Greg.

Jack Off Jill released several independent records: ''Children 5 and Up'' (produced by Marilyn Manson),<ref name="miaminewtimes.com"/> ''The Boygrinder Sessions'', ''Cannibal Song Book'', (produced by [[Jeremy Staska]], JOJ and Manson at Studio 13 in Deerfield Beach, Florida)<ref name="ReferenceA"/> ''Cockroach Waltz'', and several [[Single (music)|7" singles]]. It was not until April 8, 1994, when JOJ played a benefit show for Rock Against Domestic Violence with [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]] and [[7 Year Bitch]] at the Cameo Theatre on Miami Beach that Jack Off Jill caught the eye of record labels.<ref>{{cite web |author=Greg Baker |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1994-04-06/music/the-hits-just-keep-on-coming/3 |title=The Hits Just Keep on Coming - Page 3 - Music - Miami |publisher=Miami New Times |date=1994-04-06 |access-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426173108/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1994-04-06/music/the-hits-just-keep-on-coming/3/ |archive-date=2012-04-26 }}</ref> Los Angeles-based Risk Records later signed them in January 1997. The band replaced both Ah Cha Cha and Inhell with new members because the two were not ready to leave Florida. The band released their first national 7" ''"Girl Scout"/"American Made"'' in March 1997. On September 9, 1997, their first full-length ''Sexless Demons And Scars'' (produced by [[Gumball (band)|Gumball]]'s leader [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]], who co-produced [[Hole (band)|Hole]]'s ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'') was released.
 
After touring with [[Lords of Acid]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, Jack Off Jill headed to Los Angeles in order to complete 1998's ''Covetous Creature'', a remix EP of songs from ''Sexless Demons and Scars'' with the help of SMP ([[Scott Putesky]]), a founding member of Marilyn Manson and new drummer Claudia Rossi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430395/19980420/story.jhtml |title=MTV news April 20, 1998 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=1998-04-20 |access-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520220758/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430395/19980420/story.jhtml |archive-date=May 20, 2009 }}</ref> The new manifestation of Jack Off Jill hit the road on a national tour with [[Psychotica]], joined along the way by [[Switchblade Symphony]].

On July 17, 2000, JOJ released their second full-length CD, ''Clear Hearts Grey Flowers'' on Risk Records, that featured a cover by artist [[Mark Ryden]] and was produced by [[Chris Vrenna]] of [[Tweaker (Chris Vrenna)|Tweaker]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]].

Jack Off Jill played its last show at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in Los Angeles in April 2000. They were joined onstage by guitarist [[Helen Storer]] of the UK [[all-female band]] [[Fluffy (band)|Fluffy]] (and later of [[Thee Heavenly Music Association]]) and producer Chris Vrenna on drums.<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Tina |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430390/04072000/jack_off_jill.jhtml |title=MTV news March 04, 2000 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2000-04-07 |access-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114072002/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430390/04072000/jack_off_jill.jhtml |archive-date=January 14, 2009 }}</ref>

==Reunion==
A reunion had been discussed by the band members in the preceding years, but they did not have the time to organise one. When Jessicka Addams suffered a serious health emergency in 2013, she decided it was "now or never".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2015/07/14/features/a-conversation-with-jack-off-jills-jessicka-addams/|title = A Conversation with Jack off Jill's Jessicka Addams -|date = 14 July 2015}}</ref> 

On April 7, 2015, Bust.com announced a Jack Off Jill reunion show at [[The Orange Peel]] in Asheville, NC on July 18 as well as a Pledgemusic campaign offering "Golden Tickets" and other Jack Off Jill rarities related to the show. Other reunion shows in the tour included Manchester (19 October), London's Electric Ballroom (21 October) and Heaven Nightclub (23rd October), where they were joined on stage by ([[Scott Putesky]]), a founding member of Marilyn Manson. Their last London show was also on Jessicka's birthday, and was an emotional show for all of the fans and the band, especially due to Jessicka's health problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jennymugridge.com/music/jack-off-jill-reunion/|website=The Collected Rantings of a Blue Haired Geek|title=Jack off Jill Reunion|date=7 January 2016|access-date=7 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310124544/http://jennymugridge.com/music/jack-off-jill-reunion/|archive-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> They announced via their [https://www.facebook.com/Jack.Off.Jill.band facebook page] that these shows would be their last saying, "It's been an honor & a pleasure friends."
