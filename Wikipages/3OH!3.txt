During the fall of 2019, the duo teased new music on Instagram, and in November announced a March 3, also known as 303 Day, 2020 concert at the [[Mission Ballroom]] in Denver, Colorado. Denver based bands VYNYL and [[Breathe Carolina]], as well as [[Lil Jon]] were the openers.<ref name="303 Day 2020">{{cite web |last1=Kirk |first1=Alexander |title=3OH!3, Lil Jon to play 3/03 Mission Ballroom concert |url=https://www.9news.com/article/entertainment/music/colorado-music/3oh3-lil-jon-to-play-303-mission-ballroom-concert-in-denver/73-8b95e02f-18a4-4cca-a808-2c56d90f3d99 |website=9News |access-date=14 November 2020}}</ref> In January 2020, they started a weekly morning show called "Cup of JOH!" on Instagram Live in build up to the 303 Day concert, which continued on into August 2020. 303 Day was one of the last concerts hosted at the Mission Ballroom in 2020, with the venue postponing all future shows just ten days later due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="Mission Ballroom COVID-19">{{cite instagram |title=stay healthy everybody 🤍|postid=B9sj21lFULN|user=missionballroom|date=13 March 2020|access-date=14 November 2020}}</ref>

On November 13, 2020, the band released a new song called "Lonely Machines" with duo [[100 gecs]] which ''Wall of Sound'' described as a "cheeky, fun EDM anthem, taking you back to when "Don't Trust Me" was all over the radio."<ref>{{Cite web|last=citylightstam|date=2020-11-12|title=3OH!3 Return With New Single 'Lonely Machines'|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2020/11/13/3oh3-return-with-new-single-lonely-machines/|access-date=2020-11-12|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref>
