'''Fascinating Aïda''' is a British comedy singing group and [[satire|satirical]] [[cabaret]] act founded in March 1983. The line-up consists of founder member [[Dillie Keane]]; [[Adèle Anderson]], who joined in 1984; and [[Liza Pulman]], who first joined in 2004. 

The group received a [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Award]] nomination at the 1984 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]], and went on to be nominated three times for the [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment|Olivier Award for Best Entertainment]] (1995, 2000 and 2004), and twice for the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue]] (2005 and 2010). Keane and Anderson were also nominated for the 2010 [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics]]. Their name is derived from the expletive exclamation 'F**king Ada!', which appears in the text of [[Alan Bennett]]'s play ''[[The History Boys]]'' (2004), and is also the name of a song by [[Ian Dury]].

==History==
[[File:Barefaced Chic Photo.JPG|thumb|left|(from left to right) [[Adèle Anderson]], [[Dillie Keane]] and Marilyn Cutts performing in ''Barefaced Chic!'' at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]]]]
Fascinating Aïda was founded in March 1983 by [[Dillie Keane]],<ref name="BTG-DK"/> along with Marilyn Cutts and Lizzie Richardson. The members have varied frequently, but the central two have been [[Adèle Anderson]] – who joined the group in 1984 – and Keane. The trio started performing in a [[West End of London|West End]] [[wine bar]], but they soon caught the attention of the media and performed on television for the first time in July 1983.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Over the years they gained a growing fanbase and national popularity, earning three [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] nominations for [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment|Best Entertainment]], in 1995, 2000 and 2004. They were voted 'Most Popular Act 1985' by ''[[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]]'' magazine, and also earned a [[if.comedy award|Perrier Comedy Award]] nomination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/comedyshow.asp |title=Best comedy show |work=Foster's Edinburgh Comedy Awards |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> The group broke up in 1989<ref name="GBA-FA">{{cite web |title=Fascinating Aïda |publisher=Gavin Barker Associates Ltd |url=http://www.gavinbarkerassociates.co.uk/fascinating-aida.htm |access-date=28 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125111311/http://www.gavinbarkerassociates.co.uk/fascinating-aida.htm |archive-date=25 January 2008 }}</ref> and subsequently reformed in 1994, performing for a further ten years, releasing a number of albums, before breaking up again in 2004. Their 20th anniversary show, ''One Last Flutter'', ran from 13 November to 6 December 2003 at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London, when original member Marilyn Cutts joined the group for one last time.<ref name="CN371175"/><ref name="COM-FA">{{cite web |title=Fascinating Aïda: One Last Flutter |publisher=thisistheatre.com |url=http://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/fascinatingaida.html |accessdate=28 January 2008}}</ref> The show earned the group their third [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] nomination.

[[Liza Pulman]] joined in early 2004. That year, they performed their show ''Absolutely Fabulous'' twice in New York. First in June for the Brits Off-Broadway Festival, then from September to November at the Acorn Theatre, Manhattan. The show earned them a 2005 [[Drama Desk Award]] nomination for [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue|Outstanding Revue]].<ref name="BTG-DK">{{cite web |last=Connor |first=Sheila |title=Interviews: Not Just Fascinating Aïda! |publisher=British Theatre Guide |year=2006 |url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/otherresources/interviews/DillieKeane.htm |access-date=28 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008023413/http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/otherresources/interviews/DillieKeane.htm |archive-date=8 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2007, Keane stated on the welcome page on the Fascinating Aïda official website that "Next year will be our 25th anniversary so we really want to do a new show to celebrate".<ref name="FA001">{{cite web |last=Keane |first=Dillie |authorlink=Dillie Keane |title=Welcome |publisher=Fascinating Aïda |year=2008 |url=http://www.fascinatingaida.co.uk/faframe.htm |accessdate=31 January 2008}} {{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

The group wrote songs for radio and television programmes such as ''[[Stop The Week]]'', ''After Hours'', ''[[People Like Us (mockumentary)|People Like Us]]'' and the breakfast broadcaster [[TV-am]].<ref name="CN371175"/> Some of their most famous songs include ''Shattered Illusions'', ''Herpes Tango'', ''Lieder'' and ''Taboo''. They were the subject of several [[BBC]] documentaries. All the current members are also established actresses, mainly in musical theatre. Dillie Keane is also a writer, having written a column in ''[[The Stage]]'' magazine for ten years, and written two books, ''The Joy of Sequins'' in 1995 and ''Fascinating Who?'' in 1985. Keane says she now spends her time "juggling acting, cabaret and writing". The group have an official mascot—a pure bred [[Irish setter]] called "Dillie", born in 1999.

After the death in 2007 of the group's pianist and musical director [[Russell Churney]],<ref name="NYT040601"/> plans for a new show were shelved. It was announced in early March 2008 that they would get together again for a short spell of concerts and possibly a brief tour to celebrate their 25th anniversary, and the show would include new songs.<ref>[http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/faframe.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228012309/http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/faframe.htm |date=28 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nathan@bluekitedesigns.com for Jermyn Street Theatre |url=http://www.jermynstreettheatre.co.uk/ |title=Jermyn Street Theatre, the official online home of London's leading Off-West-End venue |publisher=Jermynstreettheatre.co.uk |accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colekitchenn.com/ |title=COLE KITCHENN LTD – Producers – General Management – Personal Management |publisher=Colekitchenn.com |accessdate=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926022615/http://www.colekitchenn.com/ |archive-date=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2008 they performed at the [[Jermyn Street Theatre]], followed by three nationwide tours.

More recently ''[[The West End Whingers]]'' were unanimously praising their [[Jermyn Street Theatre]] run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westendwhingers.wordpress.com/2008/05/22/review-fascinating-aida-jermyn-street-theatre/ |title=West End Whingers Review |publisher=Westendwhingers.wordpress.com |date=22 May 2008 |accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' said of their ''Absolutely Fascinating'' run: "I hope every cabaret singer looking for new material sees this show. Any young musical-theater performer who wants to see the right blend of subtlety and showmanship should too. The rest of us can savor the strong opinions and sharp wits that can make top-notch entertainment."<ref>[http://theater2.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/theater/reviews/12kirk.html?_r=1&oref=slogin NY Times Review]</ref>
