===Early beginnings===

They were later joined by Charley Bagnall through mutual friends and finally Lewi Morgan was the last addition to the band after meeting Jake through a girl he was seeing at the time. The band's was originally called '''Relics''' and their initial fame was through cover releases posted on YouTube;<ref name="Metro boy band">{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=New boy band alert!

For this performance, they wore "elf ears" and created what Roche called "more of a comedy sketch".
