'''Swans''' are an American [[experimental rock]] band formed in 1982 by singer, songwriter and [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Michael Gira]]. One of few acts to emerge from the [[New York City]]-based [[no wave]] scene and stay intact into the next decade, Swans have become recognized for an ever-changing sound, exploring genres such as [[noise rock]], [[post-punk]], [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[post-rock]]. Initially, their music was known for its sonic brutality and misanthropic lyrics. Following the addition of singer, songwriter and keyboardist [[Jarboe]] in 1986, Swans began to incorporate melody and intricacy into their music. Jarboe remained the band's only constant member except Gira and semi-constant guitarist [[Norman Westberg]] until their dissolution in 1997.

In 2010, Gira re-formed the band without Jarboe, establishing a stable lineup of musicians which has toured worldwide and released four albums to critical acclaim.<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web|title=Metacritic Entries|url=http://www.metacritic.com/person/swans|website=Metacritic|access-date=September 9, 2017}}</ref> This iteration of the group performed its last shows in November 2017, ending the tour in support of its final album ''[[The Glowing Man]]''.<ref name="Final shows">{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/SwansOfficial/posts/10156578518251978|title = Final shows|publisher = Facebook post|date=September 7, 2017|access-date = September 9, 2017}}</ref> Since 2019, Gira has been touring and recording with Swans as "a revolving cast of contributors".<ref name="Final shows" /> The band's latest album, ''[[Leaving Meaning]]'', was released on October 25, 2019. Since 1990, all Swans records have been released through Gira's own label, [[Young God Records]].

== History ==
[[File:Gira (2012-09-19 by Ian T. McFarland).jpg|thumb|right|255px|The band was formed and has been led by singer, songwriter and [[multi-instrumentalist]] Michael Gira, here shown performing in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] in September 2012.]]

=== Early years (1982–1985) ===
==== Initial influences ====
Michael Gira has repeatedly stated he took the moniker Swans as it described the sound he wanted best.<ref name="majestic">{{cite web |url=http://www.flowersinagun.com/interview-with-michael-gira-from-swans/ |title=Interview with Michael Gira from Swans |access-date=May 5, 2015 |work=Flowers in a Gun}}</ref> Gira's summation of the name follows along the lines of: "Swans are majestic, beautiful looking creatures. With really ugly temperaments."<ref name="majestic"/>

The earliest known lineup of Swans comprised Gira on bass guitar and vocals, [[Jonathan Kane]] on drums, Sue Hanel on guitar, Mojo on percussion and tape loops and [[Thurston Moore]], Dan Braun or Jonathan Tessler on the second bass guitar.<ref name="Swans allmusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/swans-mn0000034988/biography|title=Swans Bio|access-date=February 4, 2020|work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref name="Jonathan Kane and Swans">{{cite journal |last=Carden |first=Andrew |date=January 3, 2002 |title=Jonathan Kane and Swans |journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |url=https://younggodrecords.com/blogs/press/13026405-jonathan-kane-and-swans |access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref> Jon Tessler also played metal percussion and tape loops in another variation of the line-up with Gira on bass, Moore on guitar, and Kane on Drums. Hanel's only recordings with the group are on the compilation ''[[Body to Body, Job to Job]]'', but the ambiguous personnel credits do not make it clear on which songs she performed. Kane stated that "Sue was the most fearsome guitarist we'd ever heard in New York. She was unbelievable."<ref name="Jonathan Kane and Swans"/>

Hanel did not stay long in the group, and by the time of their recording debut she had been replaced by Bob Pezzola.<ref name="Nobody Knows No Wave">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3670741/Nobody-knows-No-Wave.html |title=Nobody Knows No Wave&nbsp;– Telegraph |last=Culkin |first=Jessamy |date=January 28, 2008 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|telegraph.co.uk]] |access-date=February 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Browne |first=David |date=June 2, 2009 |title=Goodbye 20th Century: A Biography of Sonic Youth |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0306816031}}</ref> This lineup of the group also featured saxophonist Daniel Galli-Duani, who had previously played with Kane as the avant-garde duo Transmission.<ref name="Nobody Knows No Wave"/> The debut EP, ''[[Swans (album)|Swans]]'', released on Labor, is markedly different from anything they would do later.<ref name="Nobody Knows No Wave"/> The plodding tempos and distorted, detuned guitar work is reminiscent of such [[post-punk]] outfits as [[Joy Division]].<ref name="Nobody Knows No Wave"/> However, the [[minimalist music|minimal]] chord structures owe more to [[blues]], while the [[jazz]] instrumentation and awkward time signatures are evidence of Swans' roots in the [[no wave]] scene of the late 1970s,<ref name="Nobody Knows No Wave"/> which had more or less collapsed by the release of 1984's ''[[Cop (album)|Cop]]''.<ref name="Swans allmusic"/>

==== Early style ====
Kane compares Swans to blues icon Chester Burnett, a.k.a. [[Chester Burnett|Howlin' Wolf]].<ref name="''Greed'' review">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/greed-mw0001883300 |title=''Greed''&nbsp;– Swans : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Raggett |first=Ned |work=[[Allmusic|AllMusic]] |access-date=February 20, 2013}}</ref> Some similarities worth noting—the music of early Swans was often based on a single [[riff]], played repeatedly to hypnotic effect.<ref name="''Greed'' review"/> Some of Burnett's songs—especially the songs penned by Burnett himself—have a similar structure and quality. Their early music was typified by slow and grinding [[guitar]] noise, and pounding drums, punctuated by Gira's morbid and violent lyrics (inspired by [[Jean Genet]] and [[Marquis de Sade]]), usually barked or shouted. Critics have described Swans' early recordings as "aggressive beyond words".<ref name="''Greed'' review"/>

Their first full-length release, ''[[Filth (Swans album)|Filth]]'' (1983), featured driving, choppy rhythms and abrasive drums.<ref name="''Filth'' review">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/filth-mw0000691039 |title=''Filth''&nbsp;– Swans : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Raggett |first=Ned |work=[[Allmusic|AllMusic]] |access-date=February 20, 2013}}</ref> The whole is reminiscent of earlier [[no wave]] bands, such as [[Mars (band)|Mars]], and the work of Swans' contemporaries, like [[Sonic Youth]]'s ''[[Confusion Is Sex]]'' and ''[[Kill Yr Idols]]''; but critic Ned Raggett contends that "early Swans really is like little else on the planet before or since".<ref name="''Filth'' review"/> ''Filth'' was the first album to feature guitarist [[Norman Westberg]], who would play a vital role in much of Swans' music and would feature on every subsequent studio album apart from ''[[Love of Life (album)|Love of Life]]''.<ref name="''Filth'' review"/>

''[[Cop (album)|Cop]]'' (1984) and the originally untitled ''[[Young God (EP)|Young God]]'' EP were both released in 1984 and re-released together on CD in 1992.<ref name="Swans allmusic"/><ref name="Young God">{{cite web |url=http://www.swans.pair.com/DISCOGRAPHY/young.html |title=Swans <nowiki>| Discography |</nowiki> ''Young God'' EP |work=swans.pair.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204170843/http://www.swans.pair.com/DISCOGRAPHY/young.html |access-date=February 21, 2013|archive-date=February 4, 2012 }}</ref> ''Young God'' has been known by several names, usually by one of its two A-sides, such as "I Crawled" or, notoriously, as "Raping a Slave".<ref name="Young God"/> This release is often confused with their self-titled debut.<ref name="Swans allmusic"/> The music continues in the same vein as ''Filth'', and is again vaguely reminiscent of [[heavy metal music]] played in extreme slow motion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/cop-mw0000954565 |title=''Cop'' – Swans : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Raggett |first=Ned |work=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=21 February 2013}}</ref> Swans were, in this era, Gira on vocals, [[Norman Westberg|Westberg]] on guitar, Harry Crosby on bass guitar and [[Roli Mosimann]] on drums.<ref name="Swans allmusic"/> Gira's vocals had changed slightly, becoming slowly more melodic, although the snarl still remained.<ref name="Swans allmusic"/> Some of the songs on the EP, particularly "Young God" and "I Crawled", have an actual vocal melody, if rudimentary, hinting at the sounds of future releases.<ref name="Swans allmusic"/>

[[Godflesh]] frontman [[Justin Broadrick]] shared this impression of the group:

{{cquote|The first Swans record I owned was ''Slave EP'' [''Young God''], and it absolutely blew me away... it was a sound that I always wanted to hear, just the bleakest and blackest. The minimalist approach of the music, that was what really influenced me. It was non-genre-specific, with a total lack of baggage... purely abstract, surreal, and violent. It communicated to me in a very special way, and taught me that heavy metal could be stripped of everything and reduced to its most primal form. None of the traditional genre bullshit, you know? Really changed my perspective on music at the time. Joy Division, [[Killing Joke]]—Swans took the blueprint from these bands and just pushed it way, way further, more outside of the whole rock thing generally, and paved the way for me.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrospirit.com/index.php?ShowArticle_ID=11012410074046204&cat=1993101070588705 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210144406/http://www.metrospirit.com/index.php?ShowArticle_ID=11012410074046204&cat=1993101070588705 |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2009 |title=Justin Broadrick: Existing through risk |author=Ruffin, Josh |date=2007-10-23 |website=Metrospirit.com |access-date=2008-09-19 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}

==== Live shows ====
One of the trademarks of Swans' early period was playing at painfully loud volumes during concerts, sometimes leading to police stopping shows. Gira was also notably confrontational with the audience, such as stepping on people's fingers resting on the stage, pulling people's hair and, notably, physically assaulting anyone caught in the crowd [[headbanging]]; something Gira detested.<ref name="Interview with Seconds at swans.pair.com">{{cite journal|last=Moynihan|first=Michael|year=1996|title=Seconds interview|url=http://swans.pair.com/PRESS/int_sec.html|journal=Seconds|access-date=February 20, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602061923/http://swans.pair.com/PRESS/int_sec.html|archive-date=June 2, 2015}}</ref> This lent a reputation to the name Swans which was one of the contributing factors in Gira's retirement of the band in 1997.<ref name="The Final Sacrifice: M. Gira retires Swans">{{cite journal |last=Mamone |first=Jordon N. |date=May 1997 |title=The Final Sacrifice |journal=[[CMJ]] |url=http://swans.pair.com/PRESS/art_CMJ.html |access-date=February 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128143042/http://swans.pair.com/PRESS/art_CMJ.html |archive-date=November 28, 2012  }}</ref>

Since Swans' re-formation, Gira has made a point of maintaining the intensity of their live show, stating that it is at once "soul-uplifting and body-destroying". He has also sometimes turned off the air conditioning before Swans performed and compared the experience to a Native American [[sweat lodge]].<ref name="Michael Gira Interview on Crasier Frane">{{cite web|url=http://crasierfrane.com/interviews/michael-gira|title=Michael Gira – Crasier Frane|date=October 20, 2010|work=crasierfrane.com|access-date=February 20, 2013|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110212348/http://crasierfrane.com/interviews/michael-gira|archive-date=January 10, 2011}}</ref>

=== Stylistic shift (1986–1988) ===
1986's ''[[Greed (Swans album)|Greed]]'' saw a new addition to the group with vocalist/keyboardist Jarboe joining the band.{{efn|Jarboe's first official recording with the band was on the ''[[Time is Money (Bastard)]]'' 12-inch, credited simply with "scream" (specifically at the start of the title track). By the time the track was recorded in the summer of 1985, she had already been in the band for about a month. Her first released tracks as lead vocalist and keyboardist for the band were on "You Need Me" on ''[[Holy Money]]'' and "Blackmail", a B-side from the ''[[A Screw]]'' 12". They both appear on the original CD version of ''Holy Money'' and the ''Greed/Holy Money'' compilation, while a minimal version of the latter appears on ''[[Children of God (Swans album)|Children of God]]''.}} Her presence began a slow thawing in the overt brutality and energy of Swans' early work.

''Greed'' also marked the introduction of bassist [[Algis Kizys]] as a long-time, near-constant member. The album is not as brutal or noisy as their previous releases but is still an extremely ominous and dark record. This was followed by its "twin" album, ''[[Holy Money]]'', the first to feature Jarboe on lead vocals. ''Holy Money'' was also the first album by Swans to incorporate acoustic elements, in particular, the eight-minute dirge "Another You", which starts with a [[blues]]y [[harmonica]] introduction. It also marks the introduction of religious themes in Swans records with the sacrificial ode "A Hanging", complete with gospel-like backing vocals from Jarboe.

''[[Children of God (Swans album)|Children of God]]'' (1987) further expanded Jarboe's role, acting as a foil to Michael Gira's tales of suffering, torture and humiliation. The stories portrayed here, however, are ever the more unusual, given their juxtaposition—and admixture—with religious imagery. The intention was neither to mock nor embrace religion, but experiment with the power inherent in its messages and the hypocrisy of many of its leaders.<ref name="girainterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.webinfo.co.uk/crackedmachine/swans.htm |title=Swans |work=webinfo.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030304044336/http://www.webinfo.co.uk/crackedmachine/swans.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2003 |access-date=February 20, 2013}}</ref>

Some songs, such as "Beautiful Child", retain the vocal style of earlier days, but many are quite tame. The almost [[baroque music|baroque]] "In My Garden", for example, added an extra dimension with piano (used before on "Fool" and "Sealed in Skin" to far grimmer effect) and [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]]. In between the two poles, there are pieces like "Sex, God, Sex" (heavy metal-like bass riffs with blues and gospel-inspired singing), "Blood and Honey" (a [[murder ballad]] with early [[post-rock]] tendencies) and "Blind Love" (a lengthy song, alternating between intoned vocals and violent instrumental passages). Gira considers this to be the band's major turning point.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== Later years (1988–1997) ===
After the ''Children of God'' album, Gira professed himself tired with the band's fearsome reputation for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations that he had no intention of fulfilling. He made a conscious decision to tone down the band's sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names [[Skin (US band)|Skin]] (in Europe) and [[World of Skin]] (in the US). The first, ''[[Blood, Women, Roses]]'', featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, ''[[Shame, Humility, Revenge]]'', featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although ''Shame, Humility, Revenge'' was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, sounding like stripped down acoustic versions of the ''Children of God'' songs.

The band continued this transformation with an unexpected cover of [[Joy Division]]'s "[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]", which was released as a single in 1988 on Product Inc. in a confusing array of 7" and 12" inch formats. Both Gira and Jarboe sang lead vocals on different versions of the song. In later years Gira dismissed this release as a mistake, and for a long time refused to reissue his own vocal version, although Jarboe's version was re-released much sooner. However their version of the song was a hit on US college radio in 1988, which led to the group being offered a major label deal at Uni/MCA. "I'd worked so hard all my life", said Gira. "At 15, I was digging ditches in the desert in [[Israel]], and I put myself through college painting houses. I never saw any money from any of our records. So by the time I finally got that carrot dangled in front of me, it was like, 'at last, I can make a living at what I love to do.'"<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=March 2011|title=Swans|url=http://www.mojo4music.com/1945/mojo-issue-208-march-2011/|issue=208|page=56|journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]}}</ref>

This single was followed by ''[[The Burning World (album)|The Burning World]]'' (1989), Swans' first and only major label album. Released on [[Uni Records|Uni]]/[[MCA Records]], the record was produced by [[Bill Laswell]] and expanded the acoustic palette introduced on ''Greed'' and ''Children of God''. For this album, the core line-up of Michael Gira, Jarboe and Westberg was augmented by session musicians, and the distinctive heavy guitar element of their earlier work was toned down significantly in favor of [[folk music|folk]] and [[world music]] elements. Though Swans would later explore more acoustic music with similar moods, Gira has stated that, while he admires much of Laswell's work, his efforts with Swans were simply a mismatch. The album reportedly sold 5000 copies in the UK, one of the lowest numbers in the history of MCA Records, and was soon deleted from MCA's catalogue.<ref name=":0" />

''[[The Burning World (album)|The Burning World]]'' was the first Swans album to feature more conventional pop melodies. Gira's lyrics still favored themes of [[clinical depression|depression]], death, greed and despair, but were actually sung, rather than the chanting or shouting typical of earlier material. They even [[cover version|covered]] [[Steve Winwood]]'s popular [[Blind Faith]] hit "[[Can't Find My Way Home]]", one of two singles from the LP.

In 1990, Gira and Jarboe released the third and final [[World of Skin]] album, ''[[Ten Songs for Another World]]''. It was less successful than the previous two Skin albums.

Gira's disillusionment with their Uni/MCA exploits led to ''[[White Light from the Mouth of Infinity]]'' (1991), a successful blending of earlier hard rock and later pop styles. Produced by Gira, the album blended acoustic rock, [[blues]] and hypnotic guitar noise successfully, resulting in an album more complex than anything they had released in the past. This album was followed by ''[[Love of Life (album)|Love of Life]]'' (recorded by [[Martin Bisi]] in 1992), the EP single ''[[Love of Life/Amnesia]]'', taking the group even farther into experimentation, and then ''[[The Great Annihilator]]'' (1995), considered to be one of the band's most accessible releases, possibly through being their most straightforward. The songwriting style and musical approach, however, would take a more unusual turn the following year.

==== Demise ====
With other projects occupying his time, Gira decided to end the group with one last studio album and a world tour. ''[[Soundtracks for the Blind]]'' (1996) was a two-disc album featuring Jarboe-supplied field recordings, [[experimental music]], [[dark ambient]] soundscapes, [[Post-industrial (music)|post-industrial]] epics, [[post rock]] suites and acoustic guitar.  In 1998, ''[[Swans Are Dead]]'' was released, consisting of live recordings from their 1995 and 1997 tours. In an interview, Gira revealed that there is more live material that may be released in the future. He described these unreleased recordings as "fairly spectacular".<ref name="An Interview with Michael Gira">{{cite web |url=http://www.soundsect.com/feature.php?id=12 |title=soundsect.com : Feature |last=Gilbert |first=Tom |date=October 12, 2007 |work=soundsect.com |access-date=February 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716112208/http://www.soundsect.com/feature.php?id=12 |archive-date=July 16, 2011  }}</ref>

=== Post-breakup and re-formation (1997–present) ===
After dissolving Swans, Gira formed [[Angels of Light]], continued his work with Young God Records and Jarboe continued her solo work.

In January 2010, Swans' re-formation was heralded with a new song posted on the Young God Records' MySpace, and officially confirmed by a post on the Young God Records [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]] accounts.<ref name="Facebook">{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/mgira#/notes/young-god-records/coming-soon-new-swans-album-and-tours/245702146147 |title=Facebook: Coming Soon New Swans Album and Tour |access-date=November 1, 2010 |work=Facebook.com}}</ref> Gira decided to bring back Swans during an Angels of Light show five years prior. In the middle of performing the song ''[[Akron/Family & Angels of Light|The Provider]]'' onstage utilizing "large chords that were very sustained and swaying, in this sort of slave-ship rhythm," he felt "a nascent urge right then to re-form or reinvigorate Swans because I remembered how elevating and intense that experience was".<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/11/01/swans-way-sasha-frere-jones|title=Swans Way|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|date=November 1, 2010|website=The New Yorker|access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref> To help raise money for the upcoming new Swans album, Gira released a new solo album, ''[[I Am Not Insane]]'', via his Young God Records website.<ref name="YGR">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/young-god-records/coming-soon-new-swans-album-and-tours/245702146147|title=Coming Soon, New Swans Album and Tour(s)|date=January 9, 2010|work=[[Facebook]]|access-date=February 20, 2013}}</ref> ''[[LAS Magazine]]'' posted an article entitled "Kickstart My Art" on alternative financing in "a cash-strapped music industry, unable to rely on record label financing, [that] is positioning its own quid pro quo: fan dollars to fund projects in exchange for exclusive material and a sense of involvement" that cites Swans selling out of the 1,000 signed and numbered copies of ''I Am Not Insane'' as an example of reverse financing where proceeds from one project are rolled over to finance the next.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostatsea.net/feature.phtml?fid=19012940184b602520166ab|title=LAS Magazine|work=[[LAS Magazine|lostatsea.net]]|access-date=February 20, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:OFF Festival 2012 Swans.jpg|thumb|300px|Gira performing with Swans at [[OFF Festival]] 2012]]
