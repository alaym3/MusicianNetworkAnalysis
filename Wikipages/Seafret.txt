==Career==
The duo formed in 2011 after Jack Sedman and Harry Draper met at an open mic night near their hometown of [[Bridlington]]. They were impressed with each other's performances, and quickly decided to work together as musicians. They lived close to the coast, and the name of the band referenced both the mist that rolls in from the North Sea during the summer, and a pun on a guitar fretboard. After gaining some traction online in 2014, they moved to [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/seafret/904266195|title=Seafret|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref> In September 2014, they released their debut EP, ''Give Me Something''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/give-me-something-ep/904266062|title=Give Me Something - EP by Seafret|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|accessdate=25 August 2018|date=19 September 2014}}</ref> They released their second EP, ''Oceans'' in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/oceans-ep/953513160|title=Oceans - EP by Seafret|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|accessdate=25 August 2018|date=21 January 2015}}</ref> They released their debut single, "Atlantis" in May 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/atlantis-single/976613648|title=Atlantis - Single by Seafret|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|accessdate=25 August 2018|date=1 May 2015}}</ref> They released the single "Be There" in June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/be-there-single/1008188171|title=Be There - Single by Seafret|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|accessdate=25 August 2018|date=30 June 2015}}</ref> In October 2015, they released a cover of [[Bring Me the Horizon]]'s "[[Drown (Bring Me the Horizon song)|Drown]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/drown-single/1044042240|title=Drown - Single by Seafret|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|accessdate=25 August 2018|date=16 October 2015}}</ref> They released the single, "Wildfire" in November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/wildfire-single/1080981108|title=Wildfire - Single by Seafret|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|accessdate=25 August 2018|date=27 November 2015}}</ref> In January 2016, they released their debut studio album, ''[[Tell Me It's Real (Seafret album)|Tell Me It's Real]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/tell-me-its-real-deluxe/1057802870|title=Tell Me It's Real (Deluxe) by Seafret|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|accessdate=5 September 2016|date=29 January 2016}}</ref> The album peaked at number 59 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].
