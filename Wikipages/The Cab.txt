==History==

===2004–2007: Formation and early years===
Band members [[Alexander DeLeon]]  and Cash Colligan first began playing music together at [[Liberty High School (Henderson, Nevada)]] and recorded demos with a friend, NSL, as a duo which they put up on their [[MySpace]] page.<ref name=amg>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p915363|pure_url=yes}} The Cab] at [[Allmusic]]</ref> At this time, future guitarist Ian Crawford went to school in Auburn, WA and started out playing his guitar in talent shows and posting them on YouTube.  DeLeon asked drummer Alex Johnson, who was playing in a local hardcore band, to join The Cab. In late 2005, it became a full band with guitarist Paul Garcia, guitar/pianist Alex Marshall, and drummer Alex Johnson, playing its first show at The Alley in Las Vegas.  The band signed to local label Olympus Records in January 2006<ref>[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Mar-14-Tue-2006/living/5811959.html The Cab Rides into Local Music Scene].

After a short break, they toured with We the Kings, Forever the Sickest Kids, Nevershoutnever! and Mercy Mercedes on the "Bamboozle Road Show Tour". Shortly after, the band announced their first national headlining tour, called the What Happens in Vegas... tour, with the support of [[The Secret Handshake]], [[A Rocket to the Moon]], [[Eye Alaska]], [[Anarbor]], [[The Summer Set]], and [[My Favorite Highway]]. The tour began on June 18 and ended on August 9.

===2009–2012: ''Symphony Soldier'' and lineup changes===
On June 1, 2009, lead singer Alexander DeLeon announced on his blog<ref>{{cite web |url =http://symphonysoldier.com/post/116406777/dear-friends-wow-it-has-been-far-too |title = Symphony Soldier |access-date = 2009-06-01 |author = DeLeon, Alexander Michael}}</ref> that guitarist [[Ian Crawford (musician)|Ian Crawford]] had decided to leave the band. Although DeLeon did say that Crawford had decided to leave due to creative differences, there seemed to be no animosity between him and the band. For their then-upcoming What Happens in Vegas... tour, The Cab announced that their friend Bryan Dawson would be replacing Ian Crawford, who soon became the touring guitarist of Panic! at the Disco.

On August 19, 2009, bassist Cash Colligan announced that he would also be leaving the band.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=33240981&blogId=506331027 |title = The Cab Myspace |access-date = 2009-08-19 |author = The Cab |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090822094629/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=33240981&blogId=506331027 |archive-date = 2009-08-22 }}</ref> The news of Colligan's split first appeared on The Cab's official MySpace blog. Colligan's departure, like Crawford's, seemed to be amicable as the band wrote, "We wish him the best and I'm sure he'll be no stranger at a Cab show or anytime we're back in town." The same day Colligan posted his own explanation for leaving the band on his official MySpace blog. He wrote, "I'm proud as a founding member of this band to say the things I've done, the people I've met and the friends I've made. After five years it's time for me to take a mental nap. Being home I can collect my thoughts and move forward." Colligan went on to say that he would be settling down in Las Vegas and that now is just not the right time for him to be touring on the road.

In a blog DeLeon posted after Cash decided to leave the band he said, "Thank you again to everyone for your unending support, you've made the tour and this summer one we'll never forget. We hope to see everybody again soon. We are happier than ever and have so many songs we are dying to show you guys! Get ready... the best is yet to come."

They announced they will be featured in the Alternative Press Tour 2010 and [[Warped Tour 2010]]. On January 16, 2010, Alex DeLeon announced via Twitter that "Bryan is going to be a father!". Bryan later confirmed, and confirmed his leave from the band, saying via his own Twitter that he "wanted to thank everyone for the support and love in this crazy time. Love you all now watch out the guys are gonna do great things, promise." A day later, Alex DeLeon announced that The Cab are looking for a new guitar player: "Anyone know any guitar players? serious submissions only. Here is your chance. We need someone who can really play. Big shoes to fill." In the Summer of 2010, the band gained new guitarist and cellist Chantry Johnson. They were recently featured on "The Real World".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Cab was on the "Ap Tour" in March–May 2010.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} They played songs off ''Whisper War'' and also performed the song, "Locked Up", from their recently released album.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

On March 5, DeLeon posted on his Twitter account "singing on the las vegas house of blues stage tonight. it's been too long. been craving the lights. can anyone guess with who?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bohnes/status/44158032711655424?s=20|title=singing on the las vegas house of blues stage tonight. it's been too long. been craving the lights. can anyone guess with who?|last=DeLeon|first=Alexander|date=2011-03-05|website=@bohnes|language=en|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> Later that night he appeared on stage with former Cab bassist Cash Colligan's new band, Play for Keeps. DeLeon sang guest vocals on the Play for Keeps song "Just Like the Movies" live, where normally Travis Clark from We the Kings sings on the recording.

On June 22, 2011, The Cab announced on their [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716224304/http://www.thecabrock.com/2011/06/22/change/ website] that they were departing from their label [[Fueled by Ramen]] and [[DCD2 Records|Decaydance Records]] before finally releasing their new album, ''[[Symphony Soldier]]''. The first single from the album, "Bad", debuted on Sirius XM Radio.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

''AbsolutePunk'' gave an extremely positive review, calling the album a "masterpiece".<ref name="The Cab - Symphony Soldier Review"/> The Cab guitarist alumnus Ian Crawford played guitar for the album. It features several guest artists co-writing, including [[Pete Wentz]], [[Bruno Mars]] and [[Adam Levine]].

In August 2011, The Cab gained a second guitarist, [[Frank Sidoris]], and drummer, Dave Briggs. The band toured with [[Simple Plan]], [[Forever The Sickest Kids]], and [[Marianas Trench (band)|Marianas Trench]] in the fall of 2011.
