'''Michael Learns to Rock''' (also known as '''MLTR''') is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[soft rock]] and [[pop rock]] band formed in 1988. The band currently consists of [[Jascha Richter]], Mikkel Lentz and Kåre Wanscher. Søren Madsen was an original member of the group since its formation but left in 2000. The band has sold over 11 million records over the course of their career, with the majority sold in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Asia]]. Despite being Danish, the band performs songs in [[English language|English]]. The band has attributed its success in Asia to their drug-free, clean-living image and to singing in English as a second language.<ref name="quartly"/>

MLTR has earned Gold and Platinum status for records in many countries and won many awards, including the Gold Preis Award from RSH, [[Germany]] and "The Best Performing Act of the Year" at the SEA [[Grammy Awards]] in [[Singapore]]. In addition, their song "[[Take Me to Your Heart (Michael Learns to Rock song)|Take Me to Your Heart]]" was awarded "most downloaded single of the year 2006" with 6 million or more paid downloads.<ref>{{cite news|title= Danish Pop trio 'Michael' ready to woo Taipei|author= Nelson Wu|work= [[The China Post]]|date= 4 July 2007|url= http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2007/07/04/114086/Danish-Pop.htm|access-date= 2 October 2010|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131211201754/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2007/07/04/114086/Danish-Pop.htm|archive-date= 11 December 2013}}</ref> The band has recorded nine studio albums as well as a number of live and greatest hits albums. Their latest studio album, ''[[Still (Michael Learns to Rock album)|Still]]'', was released on 21 March 2018.

During the peak of their popularity in the mid and late 1990s, MLTR was described by critics as being "as good (if not better) a band as any current big name group out of America or the UK or the Australia."<ref name="jowu">{{cite web|title=The Story of MLTR |url=http://jowu.co.uk/index.php?page=mltr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819032552/http://jowu.co.uk/index.php?page=mltr |archive-date=19 August 2011 }} Jowu Entertainment & Media Ltd Retrieved 14 March 2010</ref> According to the band's record label releases, their sound is "the perfect balance of a Scandinavian glow and the international pop song that has been instrumental in forming the compelling sound of the band",<ref name="scanmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.scanmusic.dk/202-207-mltr.htm|title=Michael Learns To Rock: The Story of MLTR|publisher=Scan Music & Booking|access-date=3 July 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130940/http://www.scanmusic.dk/202-207-mltr.htm|archive-date=19 July 2011}}</ref> although the lead singer and songwriter, [[Jascha Richter]], disagrees with this, maintaining that the music defies geographical categorization.<ref name="quartly"/>

== History ==
===Formation — ''Michael Learns to Rock'' (1988–1992)===
In 1988, singer Jascha Richter with the intent of forming a band to perform his songs, asked his high school friend and drummer Kåre Wanscher in [[Aarhus, Denmark]] to perform with him. Realizing the limitations of playing as a duo, they recruited the guitarist Mikkel Lentz, who was then playing rock music with his group the Rocking Studs. On 15 March 1988, their first night of practice made them realize they needed a fourth musician, so they asked Søren Madsen, another guitarist who was into [[Led Zeppelin]], to join in on bass guitar.<ref name="quartly"/> Although Madsen was not an obvious choice for a pop band, he was invited on the basis that he had been part of the band Hip Hop that had reached the finals of a Danish competition to nominate a song to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].

Since Richter already had a number of original songs, eliminating the need to jam, they were able to quickly record a demo tape intending it to be sent to the 'Rock Grand Prix' competition in their hometown Aarhus, they had to hurriedly come up with a name before posting it; Richter wrote as the name of the sender 'Michael Learns to Rock', partly inspired by a line from his school English textbook and partly because they were a pop band taking part in a rock concert. Lentz and Richter have admitted that the band was named after [[Michael Jackson]]: "I think Richter was thinking of Michael Jackson, because he was called 'the king of pop' and it was kind of funny, because it was like, what would he sound like if he learned to rock? It was wordplay," Lentz has stated. Richter claimed in an interview :  "Yeah, it was like [[Johnny Hates Jazz]] and [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]. Sure, I've regretted calling ourselves this many times since, but we were successful so quickly, we had to stick with it and over time I got used to it."<ref name="quartly">{{cite news |title=Michael's learned to rock |author=Jules Quartly |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |date=6 July 2007 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2007/07/06/2003368385/}}</ref>

On 22 May 1988, the quartet played their first public show in Aarhus in 'Rock Grand Prix' at Aarhus's biggest venue, Ridehuset. As one of the two winning teams, MLTR performed that summer at the Aarhus Outdoor Festival on 20 June, however, only 20 people turned up. The disappointment was offset by a daily newspaper, ''Information'', describing the unknown group as "an immensely positive surprise". On 30 July 1988, the group entered and won the city's famed annual talent shows 'We Have The Stage – Do You Have The Music?' at Aarhus Musikhus.<ref name="fuglsang">{{cite web |url=http://www.danishmusic.info/index.php?id=1310&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=454&cHash=c802068681 |title=The Danes Hit the Charts |author=Fuglsang, Jens |year=2008 |work=Danish Arts Agency/Music Centre |access-date=25 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419001046/http://www.danishmusic.info/index.php?id=1310 |archive-date=19 April 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Jens Peter (J.P.) Andersen, a member of the contest jury as well as a promoter of [[Skanderborg Festival|Danmarks Smukkeste Festival]] (literally, "Denmark’s Most Beautiful Festival") at [[Skanderborg]], was impressed with the band's talent but was somewhat annoyed at their lack of professionalism, so he decided to become the band's manager, at the band's request.<ref name="fuglsang"/> Michael Learns to Rock continued playing live throughout [[Jutland]] and recording material in order to attract the attention of Danish record labels. One of these efforts included the band contributing four tracks for the double album ''Secrets'', a record organised by the Danish Rock Council to create interest in four talented but 'secret' new bands. They finally signed a record deal with the Danish label Medley in January 1989.<ref name="Thaimajor">{{cite news |title=Michael Learns to Rock: Live in Bangkok|url=http://www.thaiticketmajor.com/concert/mltr_biography_eng.htm}} Thai Ticket major Retrieved 30 September 2010</ref> However, the band did not release their first album, ''[[Michael Learns to Rock (1991 album)|Michael Learns to Rock]]'', until September 1991, backed by the American record label [[Impact Records]] and with much of the album including the first American single, "My Blue Angel", mixed and produced by the American producers [[Tony Peluso]] and Steve Barri.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michael Learns to Rock: My Blue Angel|url=http://www.discogs.com/Michael-Learns-To-Rock-My-Blue-Angel-Remixes/release/929405}} [[discogs.com]] Retrieved 30 September 2010</ref>

Although not making any headway as intended in America despite airplay for "My Blue Angel", a later single (the second in Denmark after "I Still Carry On") from the album, "[[The Actor (Michael Learns to Rock song)|The Actor]]", topped the Danish chart and also did well in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]].<ref name="fuglsang"/> In January 1992, the album topped the Danish charts, followed soon after by success in Asia, selling 25,000 copies and earning gold status in Indonesia alone.<ref name="Thaimajor"/>

===International breakthrough — ''Colours, Played on Pepper, and band's first Greatest Hits compilation — Paint My Love'' (1993–1996)===
Encouraged by the performance of their first album, Michael Learns to Rock released a second album, ''[[Colours (Michael Learns to Rock album)|Colours]]'', in October 1993 which sold over 1.1 million records.<ref name="fuglsang"/> The album included the singles "[[Sleeping Child (Michael Learns to Rock song)|Sleeping Child]]", "[[25 Minutes]]" and "Out of the Blue". The band toured Asia for the first time. At the Phoebus Concert Hall in Bangkok they played to their largest audience until then of 12,000 people. The performance of this album coupled with the band's live performances resulted in the band receiving 'The Best Performing Act of the Year' award in 1994 at SEA Grammy Awards in Singapore for their performance of "25 Minutes", followed by the 'Gold Preis' from the German radio station RSH (Radio Schleswig-Holstein) in 1995 for radio hits such as "Wild Women'" and "25 Minutes".<ref name="Thaimajor"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Michael Learns to Rock: Legendary Musical Group in One-Night Performance at Bali's Hard Rock Hotel to Aid Aceh Relief on February 6, 2005.|url=http://www.balidiscovery.com/messages/message.asp?Id=2352}} Bali News Retrieved 30 September 2010</ref>

In August 1995, Michael Learns to Rock's third album ''[[Played on Pepper]]'' was released, selling more than 1.2 million units.<ref name="fuglsang"/> Tracks in this album included "[[That's Why (You Go Away)]]" and "[[Someday (Michael Learns to Rock song)|Someday]]".

The release of this album also increased the band's presence in hitherto untapped markets like [[Brazil]], [[South Africa]], the [[UAE]] and eleven countries in the Far East, including [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Danish Rock Balladeers|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/141108_Realtime/14Nov2008_real79.php |work=Bangkok Post|access-date=30 September 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

To capitalize on the success of ''Played on Pepper'' and to curb piracy,<ref name="Thaimajor"/> Michael Learns to Rock released the [[greatest hits]] album ''[[Paint My Love - Greatest Hits|Paint My Love]]'' in October 1996, primarily in Asia; the album sold 3.4 million copies.<ref name="fuglsang"/> The song, "Paint My Love", is an English version of "Kun med dig" by Danish singers Dorthe Andersen and Martin Loft, which was composed by Jascha Richter. The band was also chosen as the headliner for the 'Celebrate Hong Kong' concert on 6 July 1997, marking the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transfer of Hong Kong]] from the [[United Kingdom]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]].<ref name="fuglsang"/> The album also topped the charts in South Africa with sales of more than 350,000 copies in South Africa alone.

===Mainstream Success in Asia — ''Nothing to Lose, second Greatest Hits compilation — MLTR & Strange Foreign Beauty'' (1997–1999)===
They released their fourth studio album, ''[[Nothing to Lose (Michael Learns to Rock album)|Nothing to Lose]]'', was released in September 1997, and also sold more than 1.1 million copies. In an incident that showcased Michael Learns to Rock's popularity in Asia, 20,000 fake tickets were sold (more than twice the number of real ones) for a concert in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], in December 1997 and while the concert was on, those outside with fake tickets tried to break into the concert hall through the windows causing riot police to be deployed.<ref name="urbanwire">{{cite news|title=MLTR: It's about the music|author=Jasmine Oei|url=http://theurbanwire.com/jun04/mltr.html|work=theurbanwire.com|access-date=2 October 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716152847/http://theurbanwire.com/jun04/mltr.html|archive-date=16 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="toi">{{cite news |author=Kevin Lobo|title=Michael Yearns to Rock|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Entertainment-Music/Michael-yearns-to-rock/articleshow/6053473.cms | work=The Times of India|date=16 June 2010| access-date= 2 October 2010}}</ref> The band travelled to South Africa in January 1998, playing sell-out concerts in [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]], consequently taking ''Nothing to Lose'' to the top of the charts in South Africa.<ref name="Thaimajor"/>

Soon after, the band's members took a break to spend time with their families and to develop projects on their own or in collaboration with other performers. They also decided to re-brand the band under the simpler name of MLTR.<ref>Allan Lykke Poulsen, "Nu hedder vi MLTR", ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'', 20 May 1999</ref> During the break, Richter wrote some new songs for the band, one of which is "Strange Foreign Beauty" that was later added to the 1999 greatest hits album ''[[MLTR (album)|Greatest Hits – Strange Foreign Beauty]]''. In a process undertaken by MLTR for the first time, the song was made by compiling the best details from recordings of ideas made individually by the four members. This album included their previous hits, either remixed or refined in some way by notable international producers such as [[Chris Lord-Alge]] (for "Someday", "Something You Should Know" etc.), Cutfather & Joe (for "Sleeping Child") and the Swedish producer [[Per Magnusson]] (for the MLTR top hit "The Actor'").<ref>{{cite news|title=Michael Learns to Rock MLTR|url=http://www.discogs.com/Michael-Learns-To-Rock-MLTR/release/1229284|work=[[discogs.com]] |access-date= 2 October 2010}}</ref><ref>"Michael Learns To Rock udsender den 19. maj et »Greatest Hits«-album", [[Berlingske Tidende]], 7 May 1999</ref> This greatest hits album went to the top of the Danish sales charts (the second MLTR album after their first album to do so), as well in [[Sweden]] and [[Portugal]], and logged sales of nearly a million copies.<ref name="Thaimajor"/>

===Søren Madsen's departure, Jascha's solo ventures, and continuing the band as trio — ''Blue Night, Planet Blue, Michael Learns to Rock, and Where I Belong'' (2000–2006)===
In 2000, Søren Madsen decided to leave the group to embark on a solo career. The remaining three members set themselves the challenge of pursuing a sound different from that of their previous albums and thus produced the album ''[[Blue Night (Michael Learns to Rock album)|Blue Night]]'', which almost went platinum in [[Denmark]] and sold well in Asia,<ref name="jowu" /> with sales over one million. The following year a biography of MLTR, ''Something You Should Know'' written by Poul Martin-Bonde, was published along with a few previously unreleased recordings. The English translation of the book was called ''It Never Rains on Bali'',<ref>{{cite news |author= Poul Martin Bonde|title=Google Books – It Never Rains on Bali: The Story of Michael Learns to Rock|year=2001|isbn=9788756292375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySLuMgAACAAJ&q=michael+learns+to+rock}}</ref> a reference to an incident that took place during the band's 1995 [[Bali]] concert, where a no-rain forecast proved wrong and the unexpected rain stopped the concert.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rain Stops Play|url=http://www.midaspromotions.com/aboutus.htm|publisher=Midas Promotions|access-date=18 March 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324094913/http://www.midaspromotions.com/aboutus.htm|archive-date=24 March 2010}}</ref>

After the release of ''Blue Night'', the band took a prolonged break, with Richter working on his solo album ''Planet Blue''. The band later admitted that they even considered disbanding during this time. They ultimately decided against it, following the success of their greatest hits album releases, including ''19 Love Songs / Love Ballads'' in 2002, which went to number 2<ref>{{cite news |title=MICHAEL LEARNS TO ROCK – 19 LOVE SONGS (ALBUM)|url=https://danishcharts.dk/showitem.asp?interpret=Michael+Learns+To+Rock&titel=19+Love+Songs&cat=a| publisher=danishcharts.dk |access-date= 2 October 2010}}</ref> in Denmark.

In 2004, the band regrouped again, departing from the name MLTR, and using the original name for their sixth album called ''[[Michael Learns to Rock (2004 album)|Michael Learns to Rock]]'', released in Asia as ''Take Me to Your Heart''. The album focused on the Asian market. The single "Take Me to Your Heart" was a remake of [[Jacky Cheung]]'s "[[The Goodbye Kiss (album)|Goodbye Kiss]]" ("吻别"), and was popular in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand and [[Taiwan]]. By the end of 2006 alone, the single created a record when it sold over 6 million paid downloads and was awarded the "Most Downloaded Single of the Year 2006". MLTR sang an English and Chinese duet of "Take Me to Your Heart" with the Chinese singer Hu Yanbin at a 2005 New Year's Party in Guangzhou, China. The band also sang the song with the [[South Korea]]n star [[Shin Hye-sung]], lead vocalist of the famous boy band [[Shinhwa]]. This album has been one of the major successes of MLTR in Asia, especially China.<ref>{{cite news |title=Danes Play, China Buys – Danish band Michael Learns to Rock sells millions in Asia|author = Charles Ferro & Steve Mclure|date= 29 January 2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxQEAAAAMBAJ&q=Michael+learns+to+rock+billboard&pg=PA44}} Billboard- Google Books Retrieved 14 March 2010</ref>

===Independent label; MLTR Music — ''Eternity'' (2007–2011)===
In 2007, MLTR performed at the [[Formula1]] in Shanghai and The 6th Golden Eagle Award Ceremony.<ref name="jowu" /> Later in the year, MLTR released ''The Best of Michael Learns to Rock Live'' and in July toured Hong-Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia.

In November 2008, MLTR released their seventh studio album titled ''[[Eternity (Michael Learns to Rock album)|Eternity]]'' under their own independent label, MLTR Music, in association with the Danish label At:tack. This album has the distinction of being the first MLTR album to be produced solely by Mikkel Lentz. The band mention on their website that the name is an indication of the fact that "the band plan to make music for as long as they still find joy in the process". Although the sales were slow (admittedly, according to the band), the second single from the album, "Sweetest Surprise" reached No. 1 in Thailand within a few weeks of release.<ref>{{cite news|title = MLTR No. 1 in Thailand|author = Charlotte Lund Dideriksen|date = 4 February 2009|url = http://scandasia.com/viewNews.php?coun_code=th&news_id=5172|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012454/http://scandasia.com/viewNews.php?coun_code=th&news_id=5172|archive-date = 16 July 2011}} ScandAsia.com Retrieved 14 March 2010</ref> The following year, another track, "It's Gonna Make Sense", gained popularity in Asia after it was played as the farewell song on the Philippine reality TV show ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|Pinoy Big Brother]]''.

== Musical style and influences ==
Michael Learns to Rock infuses [[soft rock]] with [[ballad]] and follows a basic [[Verse-chorus form|verse-chorus]] [[Song structure (popular music)|song-form]] (which is typical of most pop songs) with lyrics comprising straight forward and short-length phrasing incorporating very basic sentence constructions. The verses consist of either one or two couplets and the chorus often contrasts the verse melodically, rhythmically, and harmonically, assuming a higher level of dynamics and activity. The essence of this style followed invariably by MLTR is evident from Jascha Richter's dead-pan response to a query in an interview as to what constituted the elements of a good song: "You got to have a chorus and a verse".<ref name="pep">{{cite news|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/2965/Michael-Learns-To-Rock-performs-live-in-Manila|title=Michael Learns To Rock performs live in Manila|first=Bong|date=21 November 2008|author=Godinez}}Philippine Entertainment Portal Retrieved 2 October 2010</ref> Many songs incorporate a [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] section following the second chorus section (most notably "25 Minutes", "That's Why (You Go Away)", "Someday", "Paint My Love", "Blue Night" etc.). Many songs also contain [[Solo (music)|instrumental solos]], more commonly, guitar (e.g. "Someday", "That's Why (You Go Away)", "How Many Hours", "The Actor", "Something You Should Know", "Breaking My Heart", "Watch Your Back" etc.) and sometimes the keyboard (e.g. "Messages"), following the second chorus or following the bridge, in case the latter is present. Vocal harmonies also constitute a common feature of their songs.

Lentz admits that they never really jam to come out with or develop upon a song and most of MLTR's songs are written and composed by Jascha Richter on the piano.<ref name="toi2">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/We-would-love-to-work-with-bollywood-Mikkel/articleshow/6098196.cms?|title=We would love to work with bollywood: Mikkel|first=Rasquinha|date=28 June 2010|work=The Times of India|author=Reagan Gavin}} Retrieved 2 October 2010</ref> According to Richter, however, after he has written the song, Lentz takes the ideas further and makes it into a final production.<ref name="insing">{{cite news|author=Deborah Giam|title=Interview: Michael Learns to Rock| url=http://movies.insing.com/feature/interview-michael-learns-to-rock/id-c73b0100}}insing.com Retrieved 2 October 2010</ref> Lentz insists that MLTR do not fit to any genre of music except for having a classic pop-sound.<ref name="khaleej">{{cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/article/20090317/ARTICLE/303179875/1057|title=We really drowned in the grunge era|first=Adam|date=17 March 2009|work=khaleejtimes.com|author=Zacharias}}  Retrieved 2 October 2010</ref> Further, he believes the secret behind MLTR's sustained music career is the non-conformance to any musical trends; "We never tried to follow trends. I think that's the reason we are still around. There's been trip hop, grunge, pop. We never fitted into these trends. What seems to be tough then is now our strength. They're just songs. The songs don't belong to a musical wave."<ref name="toi2"/>

However, Jascha Richter reveals on his Facebook page in response to a fan's query that Michael Jackson's music did influence their music, especially the latter's ''Bad'' album which was released in the year preceding MLTR's formation. Also, Jascha Richter has cited [[Talk Talk]], [[a-ha]] and [[Eurythmics]] to be his influences. A-ha's international success, in spite of originating from the small Scandinavian country of Norway, instilled the self-belief in the MLTR members that even they, hailing from a similarly small Scandinavian country (Denmark), could carve out a career for themselves in international music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jascha-Richter/43540722142?sk=wall&filter=12 |title=Welcome to Facebook - Log In, Sign Up or Learn More |publisher=Facebook.com |access-date=2014-08-05}}</ref>
