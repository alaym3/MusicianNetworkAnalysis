'''Wombats''' are short-legged, muscular [[quadruped]]al [[marsupial]]s that are native to [[Australia]]. They are about {{convert|1|m|in|-1|abbr=on}} in length with small, stubby tails and weigh between {{convert|20|and|35|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are three extant species and they are all members of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Vombatidae'''. They are adaptable and habitat tolerant, and are found in forested, mountainous, and [[heath]]land areas of southern and eastern Australia, including Tasmania, as well as an isolated patch of about {{convert|300|ha|abbr=on}} in [[Epping Forest National Park]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/northern-hairynosed.html | title = Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat |work=Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities|publisher=Australian Government| access-date = 2 July 2011}}</ref> in central Queensland.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
Though genetic studies of the Vombatidae have been undertaken, evolution of the family is not well understood. Wombats are estimated to have diverged from other Australian marsupials relatively early, as long as 40 million years ago, while some estimates place divergence at around 25&nbsp;million years.<ref name="Triggs2009">{{cite book|author=Barbara Triggs|title=Wombats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yxSd03pQdsC&pg=PA10|date=13 July 2009|publisher=Csiro Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-09986-9}}</ref>{{rp|10–}}  While some theories place wombats as miniaturised relatives of diprotodonts, such as the rhinoceros-sized ''[[Diprotodon]]'', more recent studies place the Vombatiformes as having a distinct parallel evolution, hence their current classification as a separate family.<ref name="PennyNilsson2010">{{cite journal|last1=Penny|first1=David|last2=Nilsson|first2=Maria A.|last3=Churakov|first3=Gennady|last4=Sommer|first4=Mirjam|last5=Tran|first5=Ngoc Van|last6=Zemann|first6=Anja|last7=Brosius|first7=Jürgen|last8=Schmitz|first8=Jürgen|title=Tracking Marsupial Evolution Using Archaic Genomic Retroposon Insertions|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=8|issue=7|year=2010|pages=e1000436|issn=1545-7885|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000436|pmid=20668664|pmc=2910653}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[File:Wombat-Narawntapu.jpg|thumb|left|Wombat in Narawntapu National Park, Tasmania]]
Wombats dig extensive burrow systems with their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws. One distinctive adaptation of wombats is their backward pouch. The advantage of a backward-facing pouch is that when digging, the wombat does not gather soil in its pouch over its young. Although mainly [[crepuscular]] and [[nocturnal]], wombats may also venture out to feed on cool or overcast days. They are not commonly seen, but leave ample evidence of their passage, treating fences as minor inconveniences to be gone through or under.

Wombats leave distinctive [[Cube|cubic]] [[feces]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/18/scientists-unravel-secret-of-cube-shaped-wombat-faeces|last=Sample|first=Ian|title=Scientists unravel secret of cube-shaped wombat faeces|work=The Guardian|date=19 November 2018|access-date=19 November 2018}}</ref> As wombats arrange these feces to mark territories and attract mates, it is believed that the cubic shape makes them more stackable and less likely to roll, which gives this shape a biological advantage.  The method by which the wombat produces them is not well understood, but it is believed that the wombat intestine stretches preferentially at the walls, with two flexible and two stiff areas around its intestines.<ref>{{Cite news|last=May|first=Natasha|date=2021-01-29|title=Box seat: scientists solve the mystery of why wombats have cube-shaped poo|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/box-seat-scientists-solve-the-mystery-of-why-wombats-have-cube-shaped-poo|access-date=2021-01-31|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The adult wombat produces between 80 and 100, {{convert|2|cm|in|1|adj=on|abbr=on}} pieces of feces in a single night, and four to eight pieces each bowel movement.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dvorsky |first=George |url=https://gizmodo.com/we-finally-know-how-wombats-produce-their-distinctly-cu-1830414749 |title=We Finally Know How Wombats Produce Their Distinctly Cube-Shaped Poop |work=[[Gizmodo]] |date=2018-11-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119000124/https://gizmodo.com/we-finally-know-how-wombats-produce-their-distinctly-cu-1830414749 |archive-date=2018-11-19 |access-date=2018-11-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Australian Geographic|title=Mystery solved: this is how wombats do cube-shaped poo|date=28 November 2018|url=https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2018/11/mystery-solved-this-is-how-wombats-do-cubic-shaped-poo/}}</ref> In 2019 the production of cube-shaped wombat feces was the subject of the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for Physics, won by Patricia Yang and [[David Hu]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/ig-about/winners/#ig2019 |title=The Ig Nobel Prize Winners |website=improbable.com |date=August 2006 |publisher=Improbable Research |access-date=20 April 2020 }}</ref>
[[File:Certified Wombat Faeces.jpg|thumb|Wombat cubic scat, found near [[Cradle Mountain]] in Tasmania]]
Wombats are [[herbivore]]s; their [[diet (nutrition)|diets]] consist mostly of [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[Herb#Botanical definitions|herbs]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], and [[root]]s. Their [[incisor]] teeth somewhat resemble those of [[rodent]]s ([[rat]]s, mice, etc.), being adapted for gnawing tough vegetation. Like many other herbivorous mammals, they have a large [[diastema]] between their incisors and the cheek teeth, which are relatively simple. The [[dental formula]] of wombats is {{DentalFormula|upper=1.0.1.4|lower=1.0.1.4|total=24}}.

Wombats' fur can vary from a sandy colour to brown, or from grey to black. All three known extant species average around {{convert|1|metre}} in length and weigh between {{convert|20|and|35|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

Female wombats give birth to a single young after a [[gestation]] period of roughly 20–30 days, which varies between species.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lasiorhinus latifrons|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Lasiorhinus_latifrons.html|work=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|access-date=13 August 2010|author=Green, E|author2=Myers, P |year=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Watson, A|title=Vombatus ursinus|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Vombatus_ursinus.html|work=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|access-date=13 August 2010|year=1999}}</ref> All species have well-developed [[pouch (marsupial)|pouches]], which the young leave after about six to seven months.

Wombats have an extraordinarily slow [[metabolism]], taking around 8 to 14 days to complete [[digestion]], which aids their survival in arid conditions.<ref name=EoM/> They generally move slowly.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marinacci |first1=Peter |title=Wombat Behavior |url=https://www.wombania.com/wombats/wombat-behavior.htm |website=Wombania's Wombat Information Center |access-date=24 September 2020 |quote=Wombats walk with a somewhat awkward, shuffling or waddling gait.}}</ref> When threatened, however, they can reach up to {{convert|40|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and maintain that speed for {{convert|150|m|ft}}.<ref name="gum">{{cite web|last=Humble|first=Gary|title=The Uncommon Wombat|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/scribblygum/june2006/|work=Scribbly Gum|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=13 August 2010|date=1 June 2006}}</ref> Wombats defend home territories centred on their burrows, and they react aggressively to intruders. The common wombat occupies a range of up to {{convert|23|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, while the hairy-nosed species have much smaller ranges, of no more than {{convert|4|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=EoM/>

[[Dingo]]s and [[Tasmanian devil]]s prey on wombats. Extinct predators were likely to have included ''[[Thylacoleo]]'' and possibly the [[thylacine]]. Their primary defence is their toughened rear hide, with most of the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] made of [[cartilage]]. This, combined with its lack of a meaningful tail, makes it difficult for any predator that follows the wombat into its tunnel to bite and injure its target. When attacked, wombats dive into a nearby tunnel, using their rumps to block a pursuing attacker.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Wombat|url=http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter.nsf/webpages/bhan-53f7kj?open|work=Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment|publisher=[[Government of Tasmania|Tasmanian Government]]|access-date=13 August 2010}}</ref> A wombat may allow an intruder to force its head over the wombat's back, and then use its powerful legs to crush the skull of the predator against the roof of the tunnel, or drive it off with two-legged kicks, like those of a [[donkey]].

Wombats are generally quiet animals.  Bare-nosed wombats can make a number of different sounds, more than the hairy-nosed wombats. Wombats tend to be more vocal during mating season. When angered, they can make hissing sounds. Their call sounds somewhat like a pig's squeal. They can also make grunting noises, a low growl, a hoarse cough, and a clicking noise.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marinacci |first1=Peter |title=Wombat Vocalizations |url=https://www.wombania.com/wombats/wombat-vocalizations.htm |website=Wombania's Wombat Information Center |access-date=24 September 2020}}</ref>

===History===
Depictions of the animals in [[rock art]] are exceptionally rare, though examples estimated to be up to 4,000 years old have been discovered in [[Wollemi National Park]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/01/1056825399651.html |first=Paola |last=Totaro |title= Rock art find makes Stonehenge seem recent |work= Sydney Morning Herald |date= 2 July 2003}}</ref> The wombat is depicted in aboriginal [[Dreamtime]] as an animal of little worth. The mainland stories tell of the wombat as originating from a person named Warreen whose head had been flattened by a stone and tail amputated as punishment for selfishness. In contrast, the Tasmanian aboriginal story first recorded in 1830 tells of the wombat (known as the ''drogedy'' or ''publedina'') the great spirit Moihernee had asked hunters to leave alone. In both cases, the wombat is regarded as having been banished to its burrowing habitat.<ref name="Woodford2012">{{cite book|author=James Woodford|title=The Secret Life of Wombats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fg_KIKj7fXsC&pg=PA52|date=30 January 2012|publisher=Text Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-921834-90-5|page=7}}</ref> Estimates of wombat distribution prior to European settlement are that numbers of all three surviving species were prolific and that they covered a range more than ten times greater than that of today.<ref name="Triggs2009"/>

Wombats were classified as vermin in 1906, and were subject of the introduction of a bounty in 1925.<ref name="Triggs2009"/>{{rp|103}}  This and the removal of a substantial amount of habitat have greatly reduced numbers and range of the wombat.

===Cultural significance===

Common wombats are considered by some farmers as a nuisance due primarily to their burrowing behaviour. "[[Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat]]" was the tongue-in-cheek "unofficial" mascot of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Since 2005, an unofficial holiday called Wombat Day has been observed on 22 October.<ref>{{cite web|last=Middleton|first=Amy|title=The day of the wombat|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/society/happy-wombat-day.htm|work=Australian Geographic|access-date=13 August 2010|date=22 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930090651/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/society/happy-wombat-day.htm|archive-date=30 September 2013 }}</ref>

Wombat meat has been a source of bush food from the arrival of aboriginal Australians to the arrival of Europeans. Due to the protection of the species, wombat meat as food is no longer part of mainstream Australian cuisine, but wombat stew was once one of the few truly Australian dishes.<ref>'International Recipes from Balmain'. The Canberra Times. Monday 19 December 1977. pg 10</ref> In the 20th century, the more easily found rabbit meat was more commonly used. (Rabbits are now considered an [[Rabbits in Australia|invasive pest in Australia]].) The name of the dish is also used by a popular children's book and musical.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scholastic.com.au/schools/bookclub/pdf/toolkit_downloads/wombat_stew_TN.pdf |title=Wombat Stew by Marcia K Vaughan: Teaching Notes |first= Rita |last= Bishop}}</ref>

Wombats have featured in Australian postage stamps and coins. The hairy-nosed wombats have featured mainly to highlight their elevated conservation status. The northern hairy-nosed wombat featured on an Australian 1974 20-cent stamp and also an Australian 1981 five-cent stamp. The common wombat has appeared on a 1987 37-cent stamp and an Australian 1996 95-cent stamp. The 2006 Australian Bush Babies stamp series features an AU$1.75-stamp of a baby common wombat, and the 2010 Rescue to Release series features a 60-cent stamp of a common wombat being treated by a veterinarian. Wombats are rarely seen on circulated Australian coins, an exception is a 50-cent coin which also shows a [[koala]] and [[Lories and lorikeets|lorikeet]]. The common wombat appeared on a 2005 commemorative $1 coin and the northern hairy-nosed wombat on a 1998 Australia Silver Proof $10 coin.<ref name="BlueSheet">{{cite web | url=http://www.bluesheet.com.au/Australia/Decimal_Coinage/Ten_Dollar/Endangered_Species/Hairy_Nosed_Wombat/ | title = Ten Dollar | publisher = Blue Sheet Coin Values | access-date = 19 March 2017}}</ref>

Many places in Australia have been named after the wombat, including a large number of places where they are now locally extinct in the wild. References to the locally extinct common wombat can be found in parts of the Central Highlands of Victoria, for example the [[Wombat State Forest]] and Wombat Hill in [[Daylesford, Victoria|Daylesford]]. Other significant places named after the wombat includes the town of [[Wombat, New South Wales]]. Numerous less significant Australian places, including hotels, are named after the animals. Prominent sculptures of wombats include in South Australia: "The Big Wombat" at Scotdesco Aboriginal Community (Tjilkaba) and [[Wudinna]] visitor information centre, [[Adelaide Zoo]] and [[Norwood, South Australia|Norwood]]; New South Wales: [[Wombat, New South Wales]]; Victoria: [[Daylesford, Victoria|Daylesford]], [[Trentham, Victoria]] and [[Kinglake, Victoria|Kinglake]]; Tasmania: [[Steppes State Reserve]].

Wombats have also been a feature of Australian television. While wombats are not generally kept as pets, a notable depiction of a common wombat as a pet is Fatso from the Australian television show ''[[A Country Practice]]''. The Brisbane television show ''[[Wombat (TV series)|Wombat]]'' was also named for the animals.

Australian literature contains many references to the wombat. Examples are Mr. Walter Wombat from the adventures of ''[[Blinky Bill]]'' and one of the main antagonists in ''[[The Magic Pudding]]'' by [[Norman Lindsay]].

The only known wild populations of this species exist in two locations in [[Queensland]], the Epping Forest National Park, and a smaller colony being established by translocating wombats to the Richard Underwood Nature Refuge at Yarran Downs.<ref name=QG/> This second colony is being created through the Xstrata reintroduction project, which is being funded by [[Xstrata]], a Swiss global mining company.<ref name = "Time ">{{cite magazine | magazine = Time | author= Todd Woody | title = Wombat Love | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1884854,00.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090316093359/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1884854,00.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 16 March 2009 | access-date = 22 April 2011 | date=12 March 2009}}</ref>

The wombat population in the Epping Forest National Park has been increasing since a predator-proof fence was erected in the park.<ref name=QG/> According to the latest census, taken in 2013, the park is home to 196 of these endangered wombats, with numbers at the two locations expected to have increased to 230 by late 2015.<ref name=QG/>

Despite its name, the common wombat is no longer common, and it has been officially a protected animal in New South Wales since 1970.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/Wombats.htm | title= Wombats | publisher= New South Wales Government}}</ref> However, in eastern Victoria, they are not protected, and they are considered by some to be pests, especially due to the damage they cause to rabbit-proof fences.<ref name=QG/><ref name="Tas Parks">{{cite web | title = Wombat, Vombatus ursinus | date = 21 May 2012 | work = Parks & Wildlife Service, Tasmania| url = http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=4898 | access-date = 23 January 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130427082023/http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=4898 | url-status = live | archive-date= 27 April 2013}}</ref>

WomSAT, a citizen science project, was established in 2016 to record sightings of wombats across the country. The website and mobile phone app can be used to log sightings of live or deceased wombats and wombat burrows. Since its establishment the project has recorded over 7,000 sightings across New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.womsat.org.au/womsat/default.aspx | title= WomSAT | publisher= FeralScan}}</ref>
