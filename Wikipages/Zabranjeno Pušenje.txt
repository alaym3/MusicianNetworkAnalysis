'''Zabranjeno pušenje''' ({{trans|No Smoking}}) is a Bosnian [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Sarajevo]] in 1980. The group's musical style primarily consists of a distinctive garage rock sound with [[Bosnian folk music|folk]] influences, often featuring innovative production and complex [[storytelling]]. Currently, the band consists of founding member, vocalist and guitarist [[Sejo Sexon]], longtime drummer [[Branko Trajkov]], guitarist [[Toni Lović]], bassist [[Dejan Orešković]], and violinist and keyboardist [[Robert Boldižar]].

The band was formed contrary to the then prevalent [[Yugoslav punk rock]] and [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|new wave]], closely associated with the [[New Primitivism]] cultural movement and the radio and television satire and [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]''. They were one of the most popular musical acts of the 1980s in Yugoslavia, selling hundreds of thousands of records. Many times they got in trouble with the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|authorities]] for their, usually mild and sympathetic, criticism of the [[socialism|socialist]] system, and the habit of making light of issues considered sensitive at the time. The band's first lineup, originally named Pseudobluz bend Zabranjeno Pušenje, featured guitarist Sejo Sexon and vocalist [[Nele Karajlić]], alongside drummers [[Zenit Đozić|Fu-Do]] then [[Predrag Rakić|Šeki Gayton]], bassist [[Mladen Mitić|Munja Mitić]], keyboardist [[Dražen Janković|Seid Mali Karajlić]], saxophonist and flutist [[Ognjen Gajić]], guitarist [[Mustafa Čengić]], and synthesizerist Zoran Degan. Their debut studio album  ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' (1984) was initially released in limited circulation; the final count was 100,000 copies sold, setting a record for exceeding the initial release by 30 times. Their subsequent album ''[[Dok čekaš sabah sa šejtanom]]'' (1985), also released through [[Jugoton]], was boycotted by the mainstream media due to troubles with Communist authorities. In 1986, Šeki Gayton, Mitić and Čengić chose to leave the group, while drummer [[Faris Arapović]], bassist [[Darko Ostojić]], guitarist [[Predrag Kovačević|Kowalski]] and keyboardist [[Dado Džihan]] joined in.<ref name="depo" /> During the second half of 1980s with the new lineup of the band released two albums ''[[Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari]]'' (1987) and ''[[Male priče o velikoj ljubavi]]'' (1989) through [[Diskoton]].

During 1992, the band split followed the [[Bosnian War]], Nele Karajlić continued working in [[Belgrade]] under the names [[Nele Karajlić & Zabranjeno pušenje]] and [[Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra]], while Sejo Sexon and other members rejoined in Sarajevo, using the original name, continuing the band's career<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno pušenje at Exit 2017 |url=https://www.exitfest.org/en/zabranjeno-pusenje |website=exitfest.org |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826150339/https://www.exitfest.org/en/zabranjeno-pusenje |archive-date=26 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> released the fifth studio album ''[[Fildžan viška]]'' (1997) with the changed lineup. The band's 1990s lineup alongside Sejo Sexon featured the leader of the New Primitivism movement [[Elvis J. Kurtović]], vocalist [[Marin Gradac]], a guest on the 1987 album bassist [[Predrag Bobić|Dragan Bobić]], guitarist [[Sejo Kovo]] and violinist [[Bruno Urlić]]. After one temporary drummer, Branko Trajkov joined the group in 1996. The same lineup recorded the album ''[[Agent tajne sile]]'' (1999). In 2000, Kurtović, Kovo, and Gradac left the group, while guitarist and producer [[Dragomir Herendić|Dragianni]] joined the group and played on their subsequent album, ''[[Bog vozi Mercedes]]'' (2001). That album was followed five years later by ''[[Hodi da ti čiko nešto da]]'' (2006). In the mid-2000s, Dragianni, Bobić, and Urlić chose to leave the group, while guitarist Toni Lović, bassist Dejan Orešković, and violinist Robert Boldižar came to their seats. The band's ninth studio album, ''[[Muzej revolucije]]'' (2009), was released on the Anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] in almost all [[former Yugoslav]] countries, on the same day. The band released their tenth studio album, ''[[Radovi na cesti]]'', in 2013. Their eleventh studio album was released in 2018, titled ''[[Šok i nevjerica]]''.

== History ==
===Background===
What would eventually become Zabranjeno Pušenje was started in 1979 by sixteen-year-old [[Nele Karajlić|Nenad Janković]] (later to become known as dr. Nele Karajlić) and eighteen-year-old [[Sejo Sexon|Davor Sučić]] (later Mr. Sejo Sexon), two teenage friends and neighbors who attended [[Druga Gimnazija (Sarajevo)|Sarajevo Second Gymnasium]] secondary school and lived in the same apartment building on Fuad Midžić Street in the Sarajevo neighborhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]]. Already infatuated with and deeply immersed in [[rock and roll]], the two fanatically absorbed various musical influences from Yugoslavia and abroad, all the while desperately trying to achieve a basic level of technical proficiency on their instruments — at this stage, Nele Karajlić played the [[piano]], an instrument he previously studied in [[music school]] for a short time before dropping out, while Sejo Sexon played the [[guitar]]. Both possessing very limited musical knowledge, despite displaying boundless enthusiasm, the duo struggled with everything from simply tuning their instruments to producing the simplest of melodies.{{sfn|Karajlić|2014|p=107}}

Sexon and Karajlić soon expanded their setup by adding [[Ognjen Gajić]], another neighborhood teenage friend who possessed some basic musical knowledge having attended a music school. Though by Karajlić's own admission, Gajić played the piano better than him,{{sfn|Karajlić|2014|p=107}} Gajić decided to switch over to [[Western concert flute|flute]] as an homage to his favorite band [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]. He managed to become comfortable on a new instrument fairly quickly, soon becoming a bit of a musical authority among this now three-piece.{{sfn|Karajlić|2014|p=107}}

Since each of the three teenage members of the group (by now informally known as '''Pseudobluz bend''') lived with their parents, the band rehearsals also took place in their parents' apartments, mostly Karajlić's and Gajić's.{{sfn|Karajlić|2014|p=109}}

Before long, Sexon brought in [[Zenit Đozić]] (a.k.a. Zena, later to become known as Fu-Do), his new classmate at Second Gymnasium who had recently moved to Sarajevo from [[Bugojno]], to be the band's drummer. Adding [[percussions]], that actually consisted of pots and pans, to their setup created new problems as the noise during rehearsals became unbearable for Karajlić's parents and Gajić's mother so the members set about looking for a suitable rehearsal space.

=== 1980–1983: Early years ===
In fall 1980, in accordance with the newly passed law in Yugoslavia requiring high school graduates to immediately serve their [[compulsory military service]] in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], nineteen-year-old Sexon had to report to the army, which meant being away from Sarajevo and the band for a whole year.{{sfn|Karajlić|2014|p=123}} With Sexon temporarily gone, the band got a new member – [[Mustafa Čengić]] (a.k.a. MuČe or Mujo Snažni) who brought in [[Mladen Mitić]] (a.k.a. Munja or Mitke) on [[bass guitar]]. They were occasionally accompanied by [[Elvis J. Kurtović|Mirko Srdić]] (later to become known as Elvis J. Kurtović), Zoran Degan, Boris Šiber, [[Samir Ćeremida]], etc. In December 1980, they managed to get the band on the bill of a [[Želimir Altarac Čičak]]-organized new music showcase at [[Dom mladih]] in Sarajevo held under the "Nove nade, nove snage" ('New Blood, New Hopefuls') mantra.{{sfn|Karajlić|2014|p=125}} The event would be the band's first-ever live public performance though they did play a small show at Sarajevo's Fifth Gymnasium for their friends a few days earlier on 30 November 1980 as preparation for the Dom mladih gig.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lučanin|first=Nataša|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2014/06/dr-nele-karajlic-njegova-zivotna-prica.html|title=Dr Nele Karajlić, životna priča: Nakon "Zenica bluza" postali smo velika jugoslovenska atrakcija|agency=HUPER|date=October 1998|access-date=1 January 2019}}</ref> Shortly before Čičak's show at Dom mladih, the band changed its name to '''Pseudobluz bend Zabranjeno Pušenje'''. Over time, they dropped the first part and continued as just Zabranjeno Pušenje for brevity.

Their first recording, song "Penzioneri na more idu zimi" ({{trans|Retirees take their Vacation in Winter}}), was made for [[Radio Sarajevo]] in early 1981.<ref name="jutarnji1"/> From May 1981, Karajlić and occasionally a few other band members became additionally involved with the ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'' radio segment, which aired weekly as part of the ''Primus'' [[radio program|program]] on [[Radio Sarajevo]]'s channel two. "Penzioneri na more idu zimi" began to get some modest airplay on Radio Sarajevo throughout the year, leading to an increasing number of youths in the city making the connection between the band and the weekly comedy radio segment. In early fall 1981, along with many other upstart Sarajevo bands such as Zov, Formula 4, Ema, Cod, Rezonansa, Super 98, Negra, Žaoka, Ozbiljno Pitanje, Linija Života, Lucifer, Tečni Kristal, Tina, and Bedž, Zabranjeno Pušenje got booked for a multi-act gig as opening acts for headliners [[Indexi]], [[Bulevar (band)|Bulevar]], [[Paraf]], [[Zana (band)|Zana]], [[Aerodrom (band)|Aerodrom]], [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], and [[Bijelo Dugme]] – all part of the 'Mladost Sutjeske' event commemorating and celebrating the [[Battle of Sutjeska]] from [[World War II]]. Held at [[Dvorana Mirza Delibašić|Skenderija]] sports arena on 3 October 1981, it was the band's biggest show to date and they left a memorable impression as singer Karajlić and drummer Đozić were about to leave for their mandatory army services just as guitarist Sexon was completing his.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/utorak-aprilke/295730|title=Aprilke|agency=RadioSarajevo.ba|date=3 April 2018|access-date=1 January 2019}}</ref>

=== 1984–1989: Breakthrough and rising fame in Yugoslavia===
The band performed around Sarajevo for two years before beginning to record material for a debut album during Fall 1983 in producer a modest studio owned by "Paša" Ferović. The shambolic recording process took seven months before the album named ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' got released by [[Jugoton]] in April 1984<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno Pušenje: Das Ist Walter |url=https://www.discogs.com/Zabranjeno-Pu%C5%A1enje-Das-Ist-Walter/release/10689387 |website=discogs.com |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> in the small print of 3,000 copies, clearly indicative of the label's extremely low commercial expectations. The line-up was altered and now Nenad Janković's younger brother keyboardist [[Dražen Janković]] (a.k.a. Seid Mali Karajlić) and drummer [[Predrag Rakić]] (a.k.a. Šeki Gayton). Though the album was initially released in the small print, the final count was 100,000 copies sold, setting a record for exceeding the initial release by 30 times. In Autumn 1984, they embarked on a 60-concert nationwide [[concert tour]], making them one of the biggest Yugoslav rock attractions after just one album.<ref name="crorec"/>

During that tour, at their concert in [[Rijeka]] on November 27, 1984,<ref name="crkovox"/> Nele Karajlić declared, referring to an amplifier that had just broken down, "Crk'o Maršal. Mislim na pojačalo." ({{trans|The [[Marshall Amplifiers|Marshall]] croaked. I mean, the [[amplifier]].}}), which was recognized as a pun on [[Josip Broz-Tito|Marshal Tito]]'s death, landing the band in trouble.<ref name="jutarnji1"/> They were criticized by the media and a campaign against them resulted in the canceling of their concerts and the removal of ''Top lista nadrealista'' from the air.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kako je i kad nastalo Pušenje? |url=http://www.zabranjeno-pusenje.com/home/biografije/kako-je-i-kad-nastalo-zabranjeno-pusenje/#more-83 |website=zabranjeno-pusenje.com |access-date=27 August 2018}}</ref> The affair got attention of the [[State Security Administration|Yugoslav Security Administration]] (UDBA), as well. They were rescued by some leading liberal intellectuals, and magazines such as [[Delo (newspaper)|Polet]], [[Mladina]] and [[Slobodna Dalmacija]], who raise their voices in the defense of the group members and that affair snaps without prison sentences.<ref name="crkovox"/> Later, Sexon said that their amplifiers weren't even Marshall, and that it was a joke. <ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno pušenje otkrilo nam je što im se sve događalo nakon što su rekli "Crko maršal" |url=https://www.index.hr/magazin/clanak/crko-marsal-pricali-smo-sa-zabranjenim-pusenjem-o-danima-kad-su-bili-neprijatelji-jugoslavije/1010565.aspx |website=index.hr |access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref>

In this atmosphere, the band recorded their second, double album ''[[Dok čekaš sabah sa šejtanom]]''<ref name="crkovox"/> ({{trans|While waiting for the dawn with Satan}}) in the infamous [[SIM studio]] and released it in July 1985.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno Pušenje: Dok Čekaš Sabah Sa Šejtanom |url=https://www.discogs.com/Zabranjeno-Pu%C5%A1enje-Dok-%C4%8Ceka%C5%A1-Sabah-Sa-%C5%A0ejtanom/release/771489 |website=discogs.com |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> The album has received widespread acclaim from critics, but was boycotted by the media. Following promotional tour had extreme difficulties due to concern of the concert hosts and the enormous presence of the state police, as a reflection of the Marshall Affair.<ref name="jutarnji1"/> Despite several top concerts such as at [[Pionir Hall]] in Belgrade, [[Poljud]] in Split or [[Dom Sportova]] in Zagreb, tens of thousands sold tickets, the tour had a rather disappointing conclusion as the following year Šeki Gayton and Mustafa Čengić left the band in search of a more secure means of making a living. Mladen Mitić left in late 1986 after contributing to the development of the third album.<ref name="crorec"/>

The rest of the band was working on a subsequent album and slowly assembled a new band lineup, featured drummer [[Faris Arapović]] and guitarist [[Predrag Kovačević]] (a.k.a. Kova or Kowalski) and bassist [[Emir Kusturica]]. At the time, Kusturica was notable filmmaker who won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] with the ''[[When Father Was Away on Business]]''.<ref name="jabuka"/> This refreshed lineup, in collaboration with some studio musicians such as bassist [[Predrag Bobić|Dragan Bobić]] and back-vocalists [[Dado Džihan]] and [[Darko Ostojić]], released ''[[Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari]]'' ({{trans|Greetings from the Safari land}}) through [[Diskoton]] in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno Pušenje – Pozdrav Iz Zemlje Safari |url=https://www.discogs.com/Zabranjeno-Pu%C5%A1enje-Pozdrav-Iz-Zemlje-Safari/release/771500 |website=discogs.com |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> Diskoton [[censors]] had some objections and the song "Our Proposal for the Eurovision Song Contest" had to be renamed, since the song included comments on the depressed state of the economy and the lack of freedom of expression. The album again included a number of hit songs, such as "Pišonja i Žuga", "Hadžija ili bos", "Fikreta", "Dan Republike", and returned the band to stardom. The album was recorded in Sarajevo and mixed in [[London]], UK, while the [[record producer]] was Sven Rustempašić, a Seattle-based producer born in Sarajevo. The following tour, which included 87 concerts, was the largest Zabranjeno Pušenje tour thus far and the band was by that time regarded as one of the Yugoslav rock powerhouse alongside [[Azra]], [[Bijelo Dugme]] and [[Parni Valjak]]. In January 1988, the band received a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] for 100,000 copies sold.<ref name="crorec"/>

In October 1988, the band released their fourth album ''[[Male priče o velikoj ljubavi]]'' ({{trans|The Little Stories About a Big Love}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno Pušenje: Male Priče O Velikoj Ljubavi |url=https://www.discogs.com/Zabranjeno-Pu%C5%A1enje-Male-Pri%C4%8De-O-Velikoj-Ljubavi/release/2844510 |website=discogs.com |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> The songs were mostly written and produced by Sejo Sexon. The album featured opera singer Sonja Milenković, violinist Dejan Sparavalo and [[Goran Bregović]] as [[backing vocal]] and guitar player. The album was an average success. The band embarked on the tour with [[Bombaj štampa]] and the rest of ''Top lista nadrealista'' crew (those who didn't play in the band already). The tour (a combination of [[theatre]] and rock and roll, after an idea by Sejo Sexon) was a great success and regarded as the best tour of 1989 with around 60 concerts and more than 200,000 visitors.<ref name="crorec">{{cite web |title=O Zabranjenom pušenju |url=https://shop.crorec.hr/crorec.hr/izvodjac.php?OBJECT_ID=101039&x=16&y=6 |website=on [[Croatia Records]] |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref>

=== 1990–1995: Band split and transitional period ===
{{further|Breakup of Yugoslavia}}
Nele Karajlić and Sejo Sexon, the band's [[Bandleader|leading duo]], were getting on increasingly colder terms and the Yugoslavia-wide tour with [[Bombaj Štampa]] and ''Top lista nadrealista'' during early 1990, though hugely commercially successful, only exacerbated their fractured business and personal relationship.<ref name="crkovox">{{cite news|last=Tučkar|first=Zoran|url=http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/22459/interview/davor-sucic-sejo-sexon-zabranjeno-pusenje-crko-je-vox-a-ne-marshall.aspx|title=Davor Sučić aka Sejo Sexon (Zabranjeno pušenje): "Crk'o je Vox, a ne Marshall"|agency=muzika.hr|date=26 August 2009|access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref> The band broke up in late summer 1990 when Sejo Sexon informed Karajlić about no longer being interested in playing with him. Sejo Sexon, Darko Ostojić and Faris Arapović left the band due to different views on the band vision more than the political differences in Yugoslav leadership in the late 1980s.<ref name="crkovox" /> In that time, Sejo Sexon and Ostojić worked on their [[solo record]] for Diskoton, but that studio album went unreleased due to the start of the [[Bosnian War]].<ref name="sejo"/> Arapović joined the Sarajevo-based [[alternative rock]] band [[Sikter]].<ref name="crorec"/>

In April 1992, the [[Bosnian War]] began. Nele Karajlić had fled to [[Belgrade]] and continued working under the name [[Nele Karajlić & Zabranjeno pušenje]], later better known as [[Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra]].{{efn|For a few years during mid-to-late 1990s, two parallel bands named Zabranjeno Pušenje existed. In early 1999, Nele Karajlić hooked up with filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]], himself former member of Zabranjeno Pušenje in mid-1980s, and they modified the name of Nele Karajlić's band to [[The No Smoking Orchestra]]. Playing off of Kusturica's popularity and high profile, the band was occasionally billed as [[Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra]].}} Sejo Sexon, alongside with [[Elvis J. Kurtović]], Zenit Đozić, Boris Šiber and the band's [[album cover]] designer Srđan Velimirović, remained in [[Siege of Sarajevo|besieged Sarajevo]], taking part in the wartime spinoff of ''Top lista nadrealista''.<ref name="depo">{{cite web |title=Uvijek ispred svog vremena |url=http://depo.ba/clanak/1409/uvijek-ispred-svog-vremena |website=depo.ba |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> In late June 1992, ''Top lista nadrealista'' crew started to work on a 15-minute weekly [[radio program|radio shows]]. In August 1993, after 50 odd shows on radio, the group shot and aired four television episodes. Sejo Sexon produced a soundtrack for TV series and a [[Play (theatre)|theater play]] ''Top lista nadrealista''.<ref name="sejo"/> After the [[Bosnian War]] Sejo Sexon moved to [[Zagreb]], Croatia where he lived for some time. Later he came back to Sarajevo and together with Elvis J. Kurtović, who occasionally worked on the band's recordings, restored Zabranjeno pušenje. After reunion of the band in 1996, Sejo Sexon and Elvis J. Kurović had more than 300 occasions where then performed live ''Top lista nadrealista'' across Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, [[Slovenia]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], and [[Switzerland]].<ref name="jabuka">{{cite web |title=Kako je i kad nastalo Zabranjeno Pušenje? |url=https://www.jabuka.tv/kako-je-i-kad-nastalo-zabranjeno-pusenje/ |website=jabuka.tv |access-date=27 August 2018|language=hr}}</ref> That tour was supported by the [[USAID]] office in Sarajevo.

=== 1996–2001: New beginnings in the post-Yugoslav area===
In 1996, Sejo Sexon and Elvis J. Kurović accompanied with members of the ''Top lista nadrealista'' [[pit orchestra]] such as [[Sejo Kovo]], [[Đani Pervan]], [[Dušan Vranić]], and [[Samir Ćeremida]] had become the core of the renewed band's lineup. During that time, the band works on their new studio album. The fifth album of Zabranjeno pušenje ''[[Fildžan viška]]'' ({{trans|A Cup to Spare}}) is released through [[Dallas Records]] and Nimfa Sound in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno Pušenje: Fildžan Viška |url=https://www.discogs.com/Zabranjeno-Pu%C5%A1enje-Fild%C5%BEan-Vi%C5%A1ka/master/361834 |website=discogs.com |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> Sejo Sexon produced the album and wrote all songs with some help of Elvis J. Kurtović. ''Fildžan viška'' was produced four singles; "Možeš imat' moje tijelo", "Mile Hašišar", "Pubertet" and "Fildžan viška". Music videos for those single are produced by the band members. Production know-how from ''Top lista nadrealista'' has proven to be valuable in recording music videos,<ref name="crkovox"/> which were rated very well in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Slovenia]] where the band performed regularly. Touring musicians were Sejo Sexon, Elvis J. Kurtović, [[Predrag Bobić]], Zoran Stojanović, Nedžad Podžić, [[Marin Gradac]], [[Bruno Urlić]] and [[Branko Trajkov]], while Samir Ćeramida and Đani Pervan performed occasionally.<ref name="depo"/> The same lineup released the first live album ''[[Hapsi sve!]]'' through [[Croatia Records]] and A Records in 1998. The songs are recorded over two nights at [[Dom Sportova]], in Zagreb on July 10, 1997, and at the Metalac schoolyard in Sarajevo on September 25, 1997. In the same time, the band had two guest appearances of [[Rambo Amadeus]] at their concerts for the ''Fildžan viška'' album promotion in Sarajevo. Those appearances were the first [[Wars in Yugoslavia|post-war]] performance by a [[Serbia and Montenegro|Serbian-Montenegrin]] artist to the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Federation]]. In early 1997, [[Dario Vitez]] became [[executive producer]], [[public relations]] manager and [[tour manager]] of the band.<ref name="depo"/>

The writing and formation of the band's next album, ''[[Agent tajne sile]]'' ({{trans|A Secret Force Agent}}) began immediately following the culmination of the promotional tour for ''Fildžan viška'', in the start of 1999, at the [[Croatian Olympic Centre Bjelolasica|Bjelolasica Olympic Centre]] in [[Gorski kotar]], Croatia. The album was recorded in Rent-A-Cow Studio in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands in March 1999 and produced by Sejo Sexon and Zlaja Jeff Hadžić. ''Agent tajne sile'' is released in June 1999<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno pušenje – Agent tajne sile (1999.) |url=http://novosti.hr/zabranjeno-pusenje-agent-tajne-sile-1999/ |website=novosti.hr |access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> through [[TLN-Europa]], an [[independent record label]] founded and own by Sejo Sexon. The record produced four singles; "Pos'o, kuća, birtija", "Agent tajne sile", "Jugo 45" and "Pupoljak". The record's third single, "Jugo 45", was the band's fastest-selling single, debuting on top of the Bosnian and Croatian charts. The band began another tour in support of ''Agent tajne sile'' in 1999, beginning with promotional concerts in Bosnia and Croatia with the touring lineup: Sejo Sexon, Marin Gradac, Elvis J. Kurtović, Predrag Bobić, Bruno Urlić, [[Dragomir Herendić]], and Branko Trajkov. In a short while, Marin Gradac and Elvis J. Kurtović chose to leave the group due to other commitments. Gradac went to finish [[Sarajevo Music Academy]] and joined [[Radio Sarajevo]] [[Radio orchestra|Orchestra]], while Elvis J. Kurtović began writing his solo album.<ref name="rirock">{{cite web |title=RiRock: Kako je nastalo i opstalo Zabranjeno pušenje? |url=http://www.rirock.com/hrvatska-i-svijet/kako-je-nastalo-i-opstalo-zabranjeno-pusenje/ |website=rirock.com |access-date=30 August 2018|language=hr}}</ref>
 
In early 2000, the band came back to the Bjelolasica Olympic Centre to work on the band's seventh album.

=== 2002–2011: Continued success ===
In 2002, the band went on the [[North America]]n tour. On May 26, they had recorded the band's second live album at the [[Casa Loma Ballroom]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno Pušenje u Tvornici predstavlja "Live In St.Louis" |url=https://www.muzika.hr/najave/zabranjeno-pusenje-u-tvornici-predstavlja-live-in-st-louis/ |website=muzika.hr |access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> In 2004, the band released ''[[Live in St. Louis (Zabranjeno pušenje album)|Live in St. Louis]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno Pušenje: Live In St. Louis |url=https://www.discogs.com/Zabranjeno-Pu%C5%A1enje-Live-In-St-Louis/release/7212329 |website=discogs.com |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> This live album featured two new music videos, "Zenica Blues" and "Posljednja oaza (Fikreta)". They made the video for their 1980s hit ''Zenica Blues'' following the 20th Anniversary of the song's release. The video was shot in the [[Zenica prison]]. In 2003, Zabranjeno pušenje was awarded for their outstanding live performance on the [[Baščaršija Nights]] festival in Sarajevo.<ref name="depo"/> During 2004, Albin Jarić, Bruno Urlić and Dragomir Herendić left the group due to other commitments. Jarić devotes himself to family life in [[Kranj]], Slovenia. Herendić completed his own studio in Ivanić Grad and get focused on his production career. Urlić took over [[bandleader|band-leadership]] of the [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian folk]] band Ezerki & 7/8 from Zagreb.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bruno Urlić (Ezerki & 7/8): "Gotovo sve nosimo sa sobom – hranu, piće, pa čak i malo publike" |url=https://mixer.hr/bruno-urlic-ezerki-78-gotovo-sve-nosimo-sa-sobom-hranu-pice-pa-cak-i-malo-publike/ |website=mixer.hr |access-date=31 July 2018}}</ref> and started his [[studio music]] and production career.

In a short period without guitarists and violinists, Sejo Sexon, Trajkov, and Bobić began the writing and formation on sketches of something that will evolve in three years to the double-full-length studio album. In a short period of time, violinist [[Robert Boldižar]] and guitarist [[Toni Lović]] joined in.<ref name="depo"/> Boldižar was touring musician in 1997, while the band's violinist Urlić was on leave to [[Paris]], France. The new lineup immediately began to wrap up music for the next album and went on a short tour. Meanwhile, keyboardist [[Paul Kempf (musician)|Paul Kempf]] step in the empty seat. In 2005, right after record producer Denis Mujadžić (a.k.a. Denyken) joined the record project, Sejo Sexon got the opportunity to write a [[film score]] for the 2006 Bosnian [[action comedy]] film ''Nafaka'' directed by Jasmin Duraković.<ref name="rirock"/> On that project he got an opportunity to collaborate with prominent musicians of different genres, such as: [[Halid Bešlić]], [[Arsen Dedić]], [[Lucija Šerbedžija]], and the Mosque Choir Arabeske. On June 26, 2006, the song "Nema više", the first single from their upcoming album and ''Nafaka Soundtrack'' as well, was released and became a [[hit single]]. Sejo Sexon wrote this song with a Bosnian prose writer and playwright [[Nenad Veličković]]. On November 16, 2006, the band released their eighth studio album ''[[Hodi da ti čiko nešto da|Hodi da ti čiko nešto da!]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Zabranjeno Pušenje: Hodi Da Ti Čiko Nešto Da |url=https://www.discogs.com/Zabranjeno-Pu%C5%A1enje-Hodi-Da-Ti-%C4%8Ciko-Ne%C5%A1to-Da/release/3829046 |website=discogs.com |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> ({{trans|Come, Uncle Wants to Give You Something}}),<ref>{{cite web |title=Novi album Pušenja na kioscima Tiska |url=https://www.muzika.hr/novi-album-pusenja-na-kioscima-tiska/ |website=muzika.hr |access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> their first double album since ''Dok čekaš sabah sa šejtanom'' (1985).

Although the concert tour was truly enviable as in the time before, the period after the 2006 album release, next to the Australian Tour and the concerts in Paris and London, brought two great disappointments to the band, cancellations of the significant concerts in Belgrade and Sarajevo. At the first, there was a cancellation of the Sarajevo Concert as a result of the voracity of the [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] Board, who managed to redirect the concert's sponsorships to the Festival's budget.<ref name="jutarnji1">{{cite web |title=Sarajevski odgovor na novi val |url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/arhiva/sarajevski-odgovor-na-novi-val/3987543/ |website=jutarnji.hr |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="zp">{{cite web |title=Kako je i kad nastalo Pušenje? |url=http://www.zabranjeno-pusenje.com/home/biografije/kako-je-i-kad-nastalo-zabranjeno-pusenje/#more-83 |website=zabranjeno-pusenje.com|language=ba}}</ref> Next hit was wresting the 29 November Concert in Belgrade by former band members settled in Belgrade and gathered around [[The No Smoking Orchestra]].

{{further|New wave music in Yugoslavia|Punk rock in Yugoslavia}}
In the early 1980s, when the rest of the [[Popular music in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav popular music]] scene followed the trends in [[Europe]] of the early 1980s, chiefly [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]], Zabranjeno Pušenje were part of a unique rock movement centered in [[Sarajevo]] that forged its own path. This movement, for the most part, centered on simple, youthful, [[garage rock]], with [[Folk music|folk]] influences and a distinctive Sarajevo urban feel called [[New Primitivism]].<ref name="jutarnji1"/>

The songs range from punk rock to rock, frequently arranged to feature trumpets and saxophones, adding to the band's unique sound, along with many samples and soundbites from the period. Zabranjeno Pušenje captured the feel of Sarajevo, its idols and local heroes along with tales of love and loss, in a distinctive and often humorous way. Very visual and cynical, the band's lyrics were progressive enough to show the last stages of Yugoslav socialism (songs "Dan republike", "Srce ruke i lopata", "Abid", "Guzonjin sin"), alternate clubs ("Pišonja i Žuga u paklu droge", "Javi mi"), as well as providing morbid hints for the [[Yugoslav Wars]] ("Kanjon Drine", "Zvijezda nad Balkanom").
