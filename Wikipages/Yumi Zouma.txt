'''Yumi Zouma''' are a [[New Zealand]] [[alternative pop]] band from [[Christchurch]], [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]. The band consists of Christie Simpson (vocals, keyboards), Josh Burgess (guitar, bass guitar, vocals, keyboards), Charlie Ryder (guitar, bass guitar, keyboards), and Olivia Campion (drums). The band's name is an amalgamation of the two friends that encouraged the group to start writing together.<ref name="mynorthwest">{{cite web|url=http://mynorthwest.com/330259/interview-new-music-yumi-zouma/?|website=mynorthwest.com|title=Interview + New Music: Yumi Zouma |access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref>

The group's origins trace back to their history of playing concerts together in [[Christchurch]].<ref name="vice">{{cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/43wqyp/dream-a-little-dream-with-yumi-zouma|title=dream a little dream with yumi zouma|website=i-D|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref><ref name="issuu">{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/ubiquitymagazine/docs/ubiquity_1/56|title=UBIQUITY (0) - Beginnings by UBIQUITY Magazine|website=Issuu|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> However, the band did not begin writing music together until multiple members moved abroad and began collaborating over email following the events of the [[Christchurch earthquake]].<ref name="npr">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/01/540576964/yumi-zoumas-december-feels-like-home?t=1553630435904|website=npr.org|title=NPR Choice page|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> This early material gained attention within the musical [[blogosphere]] and encouraged American label [[Cascine]] to sign the band before they had played live or held a band practice.<ref name="mynorthwest"/><ref name="stuff">{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/62837475/null|title=Yumi Zouma's overnight success|website=Stuff.co.nz|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref>

=== ''Yoncalla'' (2016) ===
The band quickly released their first full-length album, ''Yoncalla'', the following year. As opposed to the long-distance writing of the band's earlier releases, ''Yoncalla'' consisted of material that had been finished during tours for ''EP II''. The majority of the album's final material was recorded in [[Paris, France]],<ref name="brightestyoungthings">{{cite web|url=https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/byt-interviews-yumi-zouma|website=brightestyoungthings.com|title=Yumi Zouma interview|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> following an American tour which stopped by the city of [[Yoncalla, Oregon]].<ref name="hiskind"/><ref name="youtube2">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp_VGWrCzDM|title=Yumi Zouma on Their Debut Album Title &quot;Yoncalla&quot;|website=YouTube|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> The band produced the album at electronic musician [[Philippe Zdar]]'s ''Motorbass'' studio in Paris, enabling them to achieve a sound more akin to classic [[synth-pop]] than their previous records.<ref name="pitchfork2">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22058-yoncalla/|title=Yumi Zouma: Yoncalla Album Review|website=Pitchfork|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref><ref name="vice2">{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/5g37p8/yumi-zouma-are-closing-the-distance-but-maintaining-the-mystery|title=Online to Real Time: Yumi Zouma Are Closing the Distance but Maintaining the Mystery|website=Noisey|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref>

=== ''Willowbank'' (2017) ===
After a year of heavy touring in support of ''Yoncalla'', the band travelled home to record in New Zealand for the first time.<ref name="thelineofbestfit">{{cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/yumi-zouma-willowbank|title=Willowbank by Yumi Zouma &#124; Album Review|website=thelineofbestfit.com|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref><ref name="13thfloor2">{{cite web|url=https://www.13thfloor.co.nz/yumi-zouma-a-period-of-transition-interview/|title=Yumi Zouma: A Period Of Transition (Interview)The 13th Floor|website=The 13th Floor|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> A limited edition cover of the [[Oasis(band)|Oasis]] album [[(What's The Story) Morning Glory?]] was distributed on vinyl in early 2017,<ref name="turntablekitchen">{{cite web|url=https://www.turntablekitchen.com/2017/04/sounds-delicious-yumi-zouma-morning-glory-oasis-cover/|website=turntablekitchen.com|title=Yumi Zouma Covers Oasis' (What's the Story) Morning Glory?|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> before the release of the band's second album, ''Willowbank'', in October.<ref name="diymag2">{{cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2017/10/06/yumi-zouma-willowbank-album-review|title=Yumi Zouma - Willowbank &#124; Reviews|website=DIY|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> The sessions for ''Willowbank'' marked the first time that the group had worked together in a professional studio, with the band initially questioning whether they should "all move into separate rooms" to recreate the remote song writing process from previous records.<ref name="stuff2"/> However, the sessions allowed for stronger collaboration and more organic instrumentation compared to earlier material, leading to jazz musician Olivia Campion joining the band as a live drummer.<ref name="double-croche">{{cite web|url=http://double-croche.com/post/180204790229/itw-yumizouma|title=Double-Croche — &#91;Interview #189&#93; Nos préférés Yumi Zouma sont de... |website=double-croche.com|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> Lead single ''Depths (Pt.

=== ''EP III'' (2018) ===
In wake of the departure of Perry, the remaining four members of the band proceeded to return to the methods of long-distance writing that had inspired their earlier material. This process led to the creation of a third EP, released in October 2018.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8476876/yumi-zouma-ep-iii|title=Yumi Zouma's 'EP III': Exclusive|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> A video for lead single ''In Camera'' was released in early 2019, directed by Pavel Brenner.<ref name="thefader">{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/03/13/yumi-zouma-in-camera-video-pavel-brenner|title=Watch Yumi Zouma's splashy video for "In Camera"|website=The FADER|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> A video for second single ''Crush (It's Late, Just Stay)'' was also released in 2019, directed by Robbie Barnett. <ref name="UnderTheRadar">{{cite web|url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/news/yumi_zouma_share_video_for_crush_its_late_just_stay|title=Yumi Zouma Share Video for Crush (It's Late, Just Stay)"|website=Under The Radar|access-date=2020-08-26}}</ref>
