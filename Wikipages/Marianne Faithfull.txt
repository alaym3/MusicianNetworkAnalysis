'''Marianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull''' (born 29 December 1946) is an English singer and actress. She achieved popularity in the 1960s with the release of her hit single "[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]" and became one of the lead female artists during the [[British Invasion]] in the United States.

Born in [[Hampstead]], London, Faithfull began her career in 1964 after attending a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] party, where she was discovered by [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. Her debut album ''[[Marianne Faithfull (album)|Marianne Faithfull]]'' (1965) (released simultaneously with her album ''[[Come My Way]]'') was a commercial success followed by a number of albums on [[Decca Records]]. From 1966 to 1970, she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with [[Mick Jagger]]. Her popularity was further enhanced by her film roles, such as those in ''[[I'll Never Forget What's'isname]]'' (1967), ''[[The Girl on a Motorcycle]]'' (1968), and ''[[Hamlet (1969 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1969). However, her popularity was overshadowed by personal problems in the 1970s. During that time she was [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]], homeless, and a [[Opioid use disorder|heroin addict]].

Noted for her distinctive voice, Faithfull's previously melodic and higher-registered vocals (which were prevalent throughout her career in the 1960s) were affected by severe [[laryngitis]], coupled with persistent drug abuse during the 1970s, permanently altering her voice, leaving it raspy, cracked and lower in pitch. This new sound was praised as "whisky soaked" by some critics and seen as having helped to capture the raw emotions expressed in Faithfull's music.<ref name="autobio"/>

After a long commercial absence, Faithfull made a comeback with the 1979 release of her critically acclaimed album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]].'' The album was a commercial success and marked a resurgence of her musical career. ''Broken English'' earned Faithfull a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] and is often regarded as her "definitive recording". She followed this with a series of albums, including ''[[Dangerous Acquaintances]]'' (1981), ''[[A Child's Adventure]]'' (1983), and ''[[Strange Weather (Marianne Faithfull album)|Strange Weather]]'' (1987). Faithfull also wrote three books about her life: ''[[Faithfull: An Autobiography]]'' (1994), ''Memories, Dreams & Reflections'' (2007), and ''Marianne Faithfull: A Life on Record'' (2014).

Faithfull is listed on [[VH1]]'s "100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll" list. She received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 [[Women's World Award]]s and was made a ''Commandeur'' of the ''[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]'' by the government of France.

==Early life and links to nobility==
Faithfull was born in [[Hampstead]], London. Her half-brother is artist [[Simon Faithfull]]. Her father, Major Robert Glynn Faithfull, was a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] officer and professor of Italian Literature at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]] of London University. Robert Glynn Faithfull's family lived in [[Ormskirk]], Lancashire, while he completed a doctorate at [[Liverpool University]].<ref name="BeatlesE"/>

Faithfull's mother, Eva, was the daughter of an [[Austrian nobility|Austro-Hungarian nobleman]], Artur Wolfgang, [[Ritter]] von Sacher-Masoch (1875–1953). Eva chose to [[Courtesy style|style]] herself as [[Eva von Sacher-Masoch|Eva von Sacher-Masoch, Baroness Erisso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/marianne-faithfull|title=Marianne Faithfull|work= Who Do You Think You Are?

Faithfull's mother had been born in [[Budapest]] and moved to [[Vienna]] in 1918. The family of Sacher-Masoch had secretly opposed the Nazi regime in Vienna. Faithfull's father's intelligence work for the British Army brought him into contact with the family, and he thus met Eva, his future wife.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/marianne-faithfull/|title=Marianne Faithfull|publisher=bbc.co.uk|access-date=1 December 2021}}</ref> Faithfull's maternal grandfather had aristocratic roots in the [[Habsburg Dynasty]], while Faithfull's maternal grandmother was [[Matrilineality in Judaism|Jewish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=c2a86822-529a-421f-959e-e0e613a0fc53&k=94564|title=Marianne keeps the Faith|work=Vancouver City Guide|access-date=26 January 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104093456/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=c2a86822-529a-421f-959e-e0e613a0fc53&k=94564|archive-date=4 November 2012}}</ref> 

Faithfull's maternal great-great-uncle was [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], whose erotic novel, ''[[Venus in Furs]],'' spawned the word "[[Sadomasochism|masochism]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mariannefaithfull.org.uk/inter23.html|title=Sex god?

(UK TV series)#Series 10 (2013)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' that the title used by family members was [[Ritter]] von Sacher-Masoch, the corresponding English title being that of [[Baroness]], an inherited knighthood.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Documentation License|first1=GNU Free|title=Ritter|url=http://72.9.148.189/learn/index.php?title=Ritter&printable=yes|publisher=GNU Free|access-date=25 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103601/http://72.9.148.189/learn/index.php?title=Ritter&printable=yes|archive-date=2 April 2015}}</ref>

She spent some of her early life at the [[commune]] at [[Braziers Park]], Oxfordshire, formed by John Norman Glaister, where her father, who was also instrumental in its foundation, lived and participated. Her parents divorced when she was six years old,<ref name="BeatlesE"/> after which she moved with her mother to Milman Road in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Her primary school was in [[Brixton]]. Living in reduced circumstances, Faithfull's girlhood was marred by bouts of [[tuberculosis]]. She was a [[bursary|charitably subsidised (bursaried) pupil]] at [[St Joseph's College, Reading|St Joseph's Roman Catholic Convent School, Reading]], where she was, for a time, a weekly boarder.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Craig|title=Top of the Fops|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4259397/Top-of-the-fops.html|publisher=UK Daily Telegraph|access-date=25 March 2015|ref=10 February 2001}}</ref> While at St Joseph's, she was a member of the [[Progress Theatre]]'s student group.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fret |first1=David |title=Brit Girls of the Sixties Volume Two: Marianne Faithfull & Kathy Kirby |date=26 March 2014 |isbn=978-1-291-80286-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hm5OCAAAQBAJ&q=progress+theater+marianne+faithfull&pg=PT11 |access-date=4 July 2020}}</ref>

== Singing career ==
=== 1960s ===
[[File:Fanclub1966MarianneFaithfull3.jpg|thumb|Faithfull performing on the Dutch TV programme ''Fanclub'' on 17 September 1966]]
Faithfull began her singing career in 1964, landing her first gigs as a [[folk music]] performer in coffeehouses.<ref name="autobio">Faithfull, Marianne. ''Faithfull: An Autobiography'' Boston: Little, Brown; 1994. {{ISBN|0-316-27324-4}}</ref> She soon began taking part in London's exploding social scene.

In 1966 she took Nicholas to stay with [[Brian Jones]] and [[Anita Pallenberg]] in London. During that time period, Faithfull started smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and became best friends with Pallenberg. She also began a much-publicised relationship with Mick Jagger that same year. The couple became notorious and largely part of the hip [[Swinging London]] scene. She is heard on [[The Beatles]]' song "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesebooks.com/yellow-submarine|title="Yellow Submarine" by The Beatles.

In an interview 27 years later with [[A.M. Homes]] for [[Details magazine|''Details'']], Faithfull discussed her wilder days and admitted that the drug bust fur rug incident had ravaged her personal life: "It destroyed me. To be a male [[drug addict]] and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising. A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother." In 1968, Faithfull, by now addicted to [[cocaine]], miscarried a daughter (whom she had named Corrina) while retreating to Jagger's country house in [[Ireland]].<ref name="autobio"/><ref name="Marianne Biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/faithfull-marianne-biography |title=Marianne Biography |website=Enotes.com |access-date=1 May 2011}}</ref>

Faithfull's involvement in Jagger's life would be reflected in some of the Rolling Stones's best known songs. "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]", featured on the 1968 album ''[[Beggars Banquet]],'' was partially inspired by ''[[The Master and Margarita]],'' written by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], a book which Faithfull introduced to Jagger. The song "[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]," on the 1969 album ''[[Let It Bleed]],'' was supposedly written and composed about Faithfull; the songs "[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]" and "[[I Got the Blues]]" on the 1971 album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' were also allegedly influenced by Faithfull, and she co-wrote "[[Sister Morphine]]" (the writing credit for the song was the subject of a protracted legal battle that was ultimately resolved with Faithfull listed as co-author). In her autobiography, Faithfull said Jagger and Richards released it in their own names so that her agent did not collect all the royalties and proceeds from the song, especially as she was homeless and battling with heroin addiction at the time. In 1968, Faithfull appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' concert, giving a solo performance of "Something Better".<ref name="autobio"/>

=== 1970s ===
Faithfull ended her relationship with Jagger in May 1970, after initiating an affair with [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lord-rossmore-obituary-60trp6lxd Lord Rossmore] and she lost custody of her son in that same year, which led to her attempting suicide.<ref name="autobio"/> Faithfull's personal life went into decline, and her career went into a tailspin. She made only a few appearances, including an [[The 1980 Floor Show|October 1973 performance]] for [[NBC]] with [[David Bowie]], singing [[Sonny & Cher]]'s "[[I Got You Babe]]".<ref name="autobio"/>

Faithfull lived on London's [[Soho]] streets for two years, suffering from [[heroin addiction]] and [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref>Sylvie Simmons [http://www.anti.com/news.php?id=97 interview], ''Mojo Magazine'', 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930193903/http://www.anti.com/news.php?id=97 |date=30 September 2007}}</ref> Friends intervened and enrolled her in an [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] [[heroin-assisted treatment]] programme.<ref>{{cite web |author= Barber, Lynn |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,521920,00.html |title=You know, I'm not everybody's cup of tea! |work=The Observer |date=15 July 2001 |access-date=1 May 2011}}</ref> She failed at controlling or stabilising her [[drug addiction|addiction]] at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZBUGo2YaJg |title=Marianne Faithfull Interview 1978|publisher=Youtube.com|access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> In 1971, producer [[Mike Leander]] found her on the streets and made an attempt to revive her career, producing part of her album ''[[Rich Kid Blues]]''. The album was shelved until 1985.<ref name="autobio"/>

Severe [[laryngitis]], coupled with persistent drug abuse during this period, permanently altered Faithfull's voice, leaving it cracked and lower in pitch. While the new sound was praised as "whisky soaked" by some critics, journalist John Jones, of the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', wrote that she had "permanently vulgarised her voice".<ref name="autobio"/> In 1975 she released the [[country music|country]]-influenced record [[Dreamin' My Dreams (Marianne Faithfull album)|''Dreamin' My Dreams'']] (a.k.a. ''Faithless''), which reached No.1 on the [[Irish Albums Chart]].<ref name="autobio"/> Faithfull moved into a [[squatting|squat]] without hot water or electricity in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] with then-boyfriend Ben Brierly, of the [[punk rock|punk]] band [[the Vibrators]]. She later shared flats in Chelsea and [[Regent's Park]] with [[Henrietta Moraes]].

In 1979, the same year she was arrested for marijuana possession in [[Norway]], Faithfull's career returned full force with the album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]]'', one of her most critically hailed albums.<ref name="autobio"/> Partially influenced by the punk explosion and her marriage to Brierly in the same year, it ranged from the [[punk-pop]] sounds of the title track, which addressed terrorism in Europe (being dedicated to [[Ulrike Meinhof]]), to the punk-[[reggae]] rhythms of "Why D'Ya Do It?", a song with aggressive lyrics adapted from a poem by [[Heathcote Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Palmer |first=Robert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E1D61339F932A15753C1A967948260 |title=The Pop Life |work=The New York Times |date=21 October 1981 |access-date=1 May 2011}}</ref> The musical structure of this song is complex: though on the surface hard rock, it is a [[Tango (dance)|tango]] in 4/4 time, with an opening electric guitar riff by [[Barry Reynolds]] in which beats 1 and 4 of each measure are accented on the up-beat, and beat 3 is accented on the down beat. Faithfull, in her autobiography, commented that her fluid yet rhythmic reading of Williams' lyric was "an early form of [[rap music|rap]]".<ref name="autobio"/> ''Broken English'' was also the album which revealed the full extent of Faithfull's drinking and drug use and its effect on her singing voice, with the melodic vocals on her early records being replaced by a raucous, deep voice which helped capture the raw emotions expressed in the album's songs.<ref name="autobio"/>

=== 1980s ===
Faithfull began living in [[New York City|New York]] after the release of the follow-up to ''Broken English'', ''[[Dangerous Acquaintances]]'', in 1981. The same year, she appeared as a vocalist on the single "Misplaced Love" by [[Rupert Hine]], which charted in Australia.<ref name="Hine">{{cite web |url=http://www.noise11.com/news/producer-musician-rupert-hine-dead-at-age-72-20200606|title=Producer Musician Rupert Hine Dead at Age 72|first=Paul|last=Cashmere|date=6 June 2020|work=Noise11|access-date=14 October 2020}}</ref> Despite her comeback, she was still battling with addiction in the mid-1980s, at one point breaking her jaw tripping on a flight of stairs while under the influence.<ref name="autobio"/> In another incident her heart stopped. A disastrous appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' was blamed on too many rehearsals, but it was suspected that drugs had caused her vocal cords to seize up. ''[[Rich Kid Blues (Marianne Faithfull album)|Rich Kid Blues]]'' (1985) was another collection of her early work combined with new recordings, a double record showcasing both the pop and rock 'n' roll facets of her output to date. In 1985, Faithfull performed "Ballad of the Soldier's Wife" on [[Hal Willner]]'s tribute album ''[[Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill]]''. Faithfull's restrained readings lent themselves to the material, and this collaboration informed several subsequent works.

In 1985, she was at the [[Hazelden Foundation]] Clinic in [[Minnesota]] for rehabilitation. She then received treatment at [[McLean Hospital]] in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], [[Massachusetts]]. While living at a hotel in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Faithfull started an affair (while still married to Brierly) with a [[dual diagnosis]] ([[mental illness|mentally ill]] and drug dependent) man, Howard Tose, who later committed suicide by jumping from a 14th floor window of the flat they shared.<ref name="autobio"/> In 1987, Faithfull dedicated a ''"thank you"'' to Tose within the album package of ''[[Strange Weather (1987 album)|Strange Weather]]'', on the back sleeve: "To Howard Tose with love and thanks". Faithfull's divorce from Brierly was also finalised that year. In 1995, she wrote and sang about Tose's death in "Flaming September" from the album ''[[A Secret Life (Marianne Faithfull album)|A Secret Life]]''.<ref name="autobio"/>

In 1987, Faithfull again reinvented herself, this time as a jazz and blues singer, on ''Strange Weather'', also produced by Willner. The album became her most critically lauded album of the decade. Coming full circle, the renewed Faithfull cut another recording of "[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]" for ''[[Strange Weather (Marianne Faithfull album)|Strange Weather]]'', this time in a tighter, more gravelly voice. The singer confessed to a lingering irritation with her first hit. "I always childishly thought that was where my problems started, with that damn song," she told [[Jay Cocks]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but she came to terms with it as well as with her past. In a 1987 interview with Rory O'Connor of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', Faithfull declared, "forty is the age to sing it, not seventeen."<ref name="Marianne Biography"/> The album of covers was produced by [[Hal Willner]] after the two had spent numerous weekends listening to hundreds of songs from the annals of [[20th-century music]]. They chose to record such diverse tracks as [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[I'll Keep It with Mine]]" and "[[Yesterdays (1933 song)|Yesterdays]]", written by Broadway composers [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Otto Harbach]]. The work also includes tunes first made notable by such blues luminaries as [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Bessie Smith]]; [[Tom Waits]] wrote the title track. In 1988, Faithfull married writer and actor Giorgio Della Terza, but they divorced in 1991.<ref name="autobio"/>

=== 1990s ===
When [[Roger Waters]] assembled an all-star cast of musicians to perform the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Wall]]'' live in [[Berlin]] in July 1990, Faithfull played the part of Pink's overprotective mother. Her musical career rebounded for the third time during the early 1990s with the live album ''Blazing Away,'' which featured Faithfull revisiting songs she had performed over the course of her career. ''Blazing Away'' was recorded at St. Ann's Cathedral in [[Brooklyn]]. The 13 selections include "Sister Morphine", a cover of [[Edith Piaf]]'s "Les Prisons du Roy", and "Why D'Ya Do It?" from ''Broken English''. Alanna Nash of ''Stereo Review'' commended the musicians whom Faithfull had chosen to back her—longtime guitarist Reynolds was joined by former [[The Band|Band]] member [[Garth Hudson]] and pianist [[Dr. John]]. Nash was also impressed with the album's autobiographical tone, noting "Faithfull's gritty alto is a cracked and halting rasp, the voice of a woman who's been to hell and back on the excursion fare which, of course, she has." The reviewer extolled Faithfull as "one of the most challenging and artful of women artists," and ''Rolling Stone'' writer Fred Goodman asserted: "''Blazing Away'' is a fine retrospective – proof that we can still expect great things from this greying, jaded contessa."<ref name="Marianne Biography"/>

''A Collection of Her Best Recordings'' was released in 1994 by [[Island Records]] to coincide with the release of the Faithfull autobiography; the two products originally shared the same cover art. It contained Faithfull's updated version of "As Tears Go By" from ''[[Strange Weather (1987 album)|Strange Weather]],'' several cuts from ''Broken English'' and ''[[A Child's Adventure]]'' and a song written by [[Patti Smith]] scheduled for inclusion on an Irish AIDS benefit album. This track, "[[Ghost Dance (song)|Ghost Dance]]", suggested to Faithfull by a friend who later died of AIDS, was made with a trio of old friends: Stones' drummer [[Charlie Watts]] and guitarist [[Ron Wood]] backed Faithfull's vocals on the song, while [[Keith Richards]] coproduced it. The retrospective album also featured one live track, "Times Square", from ''Blazing Away'' as well as a new Faithfull original, "She", penned with composer and arranger [[Angelo Badalamenti]] to be released the following year on ''[[A Secret Life (Marianne Faithfull album)|A Secret Life]]'', with additional songs co written with Badalamenti. Faithfull also sang "Love is Teasin," an Irish folk standard, with [[The Chieftains]] on their album [[The Long Black Veil (album)|The Long Black Veil]], released in 1995. Faithfull sang a duet and recited text on the [[San Francisco]] band [[Oxbow (band)|Oxbow]]'s 1997 album Serenade in Red. Faithfull also sang interlude vocals on [[Metallica]]'s song "[[The Memory Remains]]" from their 1997 album ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|Reload]]'' and appeared in the song's music video; the track reached No. 28 in the U.S. (No.3 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart) and No.13 in the UK.

As her fascination with the music of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era Germany continued, Faithfull performed in ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' at the [[Gate Theatre]], [[Dublin]], playing [[Pirate Jenny]]. Her interpretation of the music led to a new album, ''[[20th Century Blues (Marianne Faithfull album)|Twentieth Century Blues]]'' (1996), which focused on the music of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] as well as [[Noël Coward]], followed in 1998 by a recording of ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (Marianne Faithfull album)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'', with the [[Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]]. A hugely successful concert and cabaret tour accompanied by [[Paul Trueblood]] at the piano, culminated in the filming, at the [[Montreal Jazz Festival]], of the DVD ''Marianne Faithfull Sings Kurt Weill''.

In 1998, Faithfull released ''A Perfect Stranger: The Island Anthology'', a two-disc compilation that chronicled her years with Island Records. It featured tracks from her albums ''Broken English'', ''Dangerous Acquaintances'', ''A Child's Adventure'', ''Strange Weather'', ''Blazing Away'', and ''A Secret Life'', as well as several [[B side]]s and unreleased tracks.

Faithfull's 1999 DVD ''Dreaming My Dreams'' contained material about her childhood and parents, with historical video footage going back to 1964 and interviews with the artist and several friends who have known her since childhood. The documentary included sections on her relationship with [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]] and Mick Jagger, and brief interviews with Keith Richards. It concluded with footage from a 30-minute live concert, originally broadcast on [[PBS]] for the series ''[[Sessions at West 54th]]''. That same year, she ranked 25th in ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll''.

Roger Waters (Pink Floyd) wrote the song "Incarceration of a Flower Child" portraying Syd Barrett in 1968; it was never recorded by Pink Floyd. The song was eventually recorded by Faithfull on her 1999 album ''[[Vagabond Ways]]''.

=== 2000s ===
[[File:Marianne-faithfull-8 Istanbul 2.jpg|thumb|right|Faithfull performing in 2008]]
Faithfull released several albums in the 2000s that received positive critical response, beginning with ''[[Vagabond Ways]]'' (1999), which was produced and recorded by [[Mark Howard (producer)|Mark Howard]]. It included collaborations with [[Daniel Lanois]], [[Emmylou Harris]], Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, and writer (and friend) [[Frank McGuinness]]. Later that year she sang "Love Got Lost" on [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson's]] ''[[Night and Day II]]''.

Her renaissance continued with ''[[Kissin Time]]'', released in 2002. The album contained songs written with [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Beck]], [[Billy Corgan]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]], David Courts and the [[France|French]] pop singer [[Étienne Daho]]. On this record, she paid tribute to [[Nico]] (with "Song for Nico"), whose work she admired. The album also included an autobiographical song she co-wrote with Cocker, called "Sliding Through Life on Charm".

In 2005, she released ''[[Before the Poison]]''. The album was primarily a collaboration with [[PJ Harvey]] and [[Nick Cave]], though [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Jon Brion]] also contributed. ''Before the Poison'' received mixed reviews from both ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Village Voice]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Walters, Barry |title=Before the poison -review |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 2005 |quote=The combination often proves too bleak.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Goldfein, Josh |title=Angel With Big Friends – ''Before the poison'' review |work=Village Voice |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-04-12/music/angel-with-big-friends/ |date=12 April 2005 |access-date=12 January 2012 |quote=Faithfull's voice is just too weak to carry a tune without a narrative crutch...

In 2007, Faithfull collaborated with the British singer-songwriter, [[Patrick Wolf]] on the duet "Magpie" from his third album ''The Magic Position'' and wrote and recorded a new song for the French film ''Truands'' called "A Lean and Hungry Look" with Ulysse.

In March 2007 she returned to the stage with a touring show entitled ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''. Supported by a trio, the performance had a semi-acoustic feel and toured European theatres throughout the spring and summer. The show featured many songs she had not performed live before including "Something Better", the song she sang on ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]''. The show also included the [[Harry Nilsson]] song "Don't Forget Me", "Marathon Kiss" from [[Vagabond Ways]] and a version of the traditional "Spike Driver Blues".

Articles published at that time hinted Faithfull was looking to retirement and was hoping that money from ''Songs of the Innocence and Experience'' would enable her to live in comfort. She said: "I'm not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I'm going to have to get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means I have to put away 10 per cent every year of my old age. I want to be in a position where I don't have to work. I should have thought about this a long time ago but I didn't."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mariannefaithfull.net/news.php?item.26.4|title=Marianne Faithfull Reveals She Has No Money|website=Mariannefaithfull.net|access-date=24 June 2019}}</ref> However, she still lived in her flat in Paris<ref name=tele/>

On 16 April 2009, while preparing to board a [[British Airways]] flight at London's [[Gatwick Airport]] bound for a concert appearance in [[Bologna]], [[François Ravard]], accompanying Faithfull, was detained and then later arrested. In a statement, British Airways said: "A male customer became aggressive and abusive at check-in when he was refused travel on a flight from Gatwick to Bologna. He appeared to be intoxicated on arrival at check-in. In such circumstances, an assessment is made as to whether the passenger is fit to travel.
