==Early life==
Yas first began to listen to rap music at the age of 16 his father returned from his business trip in [[Germany]] and brought him the latest Tupac album and other hip hop songs and he was heavily influenced by them. After the sudden death of his father, he was faced with the responsibility of becoming the primary caretaker of his household with his father's debts to pay.<ref>[http://biography98.com/tag/%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%88%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%DB%8C/ Yas Biography in bio98]</ref> Yas was forced to leave his college ambitions behind and begin to work and support his entire family. It was at this time that he began to write poetry which soon turned into lyrics for his music.<ref>[http://yastunes.vcp.ir/429022-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%88%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%DB%8C-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B3/1179995-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%88%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%DB%8C-%DB%8C%D9%80%D8%A7%D8%B3-Biography-YAS.html Yas Tunes Biography]</ref>

==Music career==
Yas started his work after the [[2003 Bam earthquake]]. Devastated by the disaster, it was then, that he wrote his first song "Bam". This was the beginning of his rapping career. He realized that through rap music he had the ability to reach people by telling full stories that he thought was not easy to do through other forms of music which only consisted of a few versus and a chorus. Realizing that through his music, he had the ability to inspire people and reach millions of other young people in Iran.<ref>[http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/yas/articles/177638/title/yas-bio Yas Biography in Fanpop]</ref> Yas in 2006 made a song called CD Ro Beshkan (Break The Disk) which was written about a well known female actress [[Zahra Amir Ebrahimi]] in Iran who was the victim of a [[Sex scandal]] tape. The scandal ultimately ended her blossoming career. In the song Yas criticizes the people for playing a role in her demise and asked everyone to stop spreading her shame and to get rid of that infamous footage from their computers and cellphones. The song was listened to and downloaded by millions in Iran alone. His music has crossed the International waters and he is becoming the voice of his generation or Iranians inside and outside of their country.<ref>[https://aloonak.com/93881/yas-ft-aamin-cd-ro-beshkan First hits song Yas]</ref>

Yas in June 2008 made a song called Hoviate Man [my identity] describing his pride in his Iranian heritage and a mention of the controversial [[300 (film)|300]] film. The song has become sort of a national anthem for the younger generations especially the [[Iranian diaspora]] that are eager to connect to their rich culture and history. His music has set a new standard for [[Persian rap]] and has inspired many up and coming rappers to follow his lead and sing of more meaningful and positive messages in their own music.<ref>[http://concerts.eventful.com/YAS Worldwide Concert Tour Dates Yas]</ref> Yas in 2008 made and wrote a song named "Darkam Kon" (Understand me). Yas's music was a protest to the government and for poverty and people who can't find jobs.
[[File:Yas, Iranian rapper live in 2018 07.jpg|thumb|Yas performing in 2018.]]
In May 2011 Yas made a song called "Az Chi Begam" (What Can I Say)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aloonak.com/yas-az-chi-begam/|title=دانلود آهنگ جدید یاس به نام از چی بگم|date=24 October 2011}}</ref> which is a protest song for those schoolchildren who suffered from a fire in addition to injustice and misery, like their fellow countrymen. Yas’s voice rises against the negligence of the Islamic Republic of Iran in providing substandard facilities,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.trackpersia.com/risk-fire-lurking-worn-iranian-schools/ |title = Risk of fire lurking worn-out Iranian schools|date = 30 December 2017}}</ref> in this case a very old oil burning heater, which caused eight 7-year-old schoolchildren burned in Doroudzan village’s school disaster. Yas wrote and performed this song when popular Korean drama series [[Jumong (TV series)|Jumong]] kept the majority of Iran's population preoccupied that they did not notice the fire or the limitations a real Iranian artist has to tolerate. Yas presents the material circumstances of Iran in which production and importation are the monopoly of a small group of people, the ones in power, living in palaces and towers. He suggests that aristocrats maintain the status quo while the majority fall into the abyss of false consciousness through manipulation from selected entertainment productions. However, he selects his position as an artist trying to find a solution to social problems by creating his own art and literature.

In 2013 he became the first rapper authorized to perform by the Iranian government.<ref>[http://www.iransara.info/Iran%20children_victims.htm Children of Iran Victims of Tazi Mullah Occupiers]</ref> In 2014 Yas decided to cooperate with [[Tech N9ne]]. The pair are the first rappers from [[Iran]] and the [[United States]] to work together musically. Their single was titled "The Sound of Unity" which was released along with a Music video.<ref>[http://muftah.org/rapping-unity-iran-missouri/#.WDkv4uZ95PZ From Iran to Missouri: Rapping for Unity - Muftah]</ref><ref>[http://www.strangemusicinc.com/2013/03/tech-n9ne/yas-and-tech-n9ne-song-collaboration/ Tech N9ne Collaborates With Iran’s Most Popular Rapper Yas]</ref>

==Manner==
Yas, who raps in [[Persian language|Persian]], states he was heavily influenced as a young man by [[Tupac Shakur]] albums brought back to Iran by his father, as well as the [[Persian poetry|Classical Persian poetry]] especially [[Rumi]]. He is one of the few Persian rapper who do not use any swear words in their song<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/modiba/yas-irans-hip-hop-sensati_b_150348.html/ ''Iran's Hip-Hop Sensation''], Huffington Post 12 December 2008</ref>
Yas theme songs is the social problems. Yas’ accomplishments paved the way for new rappers to perform in Iran. Though it was illegal for individuals to perform in Iran prior to Yas, today, numerous rappers are letting their voices be heard, and challenging the economic disparity that exists in Iran.<ref>[http://www.hipwiki.com/Yas+(Iranian+Rapper) Yas (Iranian Rapper)]</ref>
