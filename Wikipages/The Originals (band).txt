'''The Originals''', often called "Motown's best-kept secret",<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ORIGINALS - ESSENTIAL COLLECTION|url=http://www.modculture.co.uk/reviews/review.php?id=100|website=Modculture.com|access-date=February 2, 2012}}</ref> were a successful [[Motown]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]] group during the late 1960s and the 1970s, most notable for the hits "[[Baby I'm for Real|Baby, I'm For Real]]", "[[The Bells (The Originals song)|The Bells]]", and the [[disco]] classic "[[Down to Love Town|Down To Love Town]]." Formed in 1966, the group originally consisted of [[baritone]] singer [[Freddie Gorman]], [[tenor]]/[[falsetto]] Walter Gaines, and tenors [[C. P. Spencer]] and Hank Dixon (and briefly [[Joe Stubbs]]).  Ty Hunter replaced Spencer when he left to go solo in the early 1970s.  They had all previously sung in other Detroit groups, Spencer having been an original member of [[the Spinners (U.S. band)|The (Detroit) Spinners]] and Hunter having sung with [[The Supremes]] member [[Scherrie Payne]] in the group [[The Glass House (band)|Glass House]]. Spencer, Gaines, Hunter, and Dixon (at one time or another) were also members of The Voice Masters. As a member of the Holland–Dozier–Gorman writing-production team (before [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]]), Gorman (as a mailman) was one of the co-writers of Motown's first number 1 pop hit "[[Please Mr. Postman]]", recorded by [[The Marvelettes]]. In 1964 [[Beatles|The Beatles]] released their version and in 1975 [[The Carpenters]] took it to number 1 again. This was the second time in pop history that a song had reached number 1 twice as "[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]" by [[Chubby Checker]], reached number 1 in both 1960 and 1961. In 2006, "Please Mr. Postman" was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

==History==
The group found success in the latter half of the 1960s as background singers for recordings by artists such as [[Jimmy Ruffin]]'s "[[What Becomes of the Brokenhearted]]", [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[For Once in My Life]]" and "[[Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday]]", [[David Ruffin]]'s "[[My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)]]", [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[Chained (Marvin Gaye song)|Chained]]" and "[[Just to Keep You Satisfied]]", [[Edwin Starr]]'s "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]" and "[[25 Miles]]", and many more. Much like [[The Andantes]], Motown's in-house female [[backing vocalist|backing group]], The Originals are on countless Motown recordings but were never credited.

The Originals recorded plenty of their own material for Motown but saw only one single release before 1969. A cover of [[Lead Belly]]'s "Goodnight Irene" was released in 1966, backed with "Need Your Lovin'" (both featuring Joe Stubbs on lead) but failed to chart. They recorded the song "Suspicion" in 1966, but it was never released as a single. Nevertheless, it has become a [[Northern soul]] classic. The track has since been featured on many of their compilation albums and many Northern Soul compilations. The group saw the release of two more singles, "We've Got a Way Out of Love" and "Green Grow the Lilacs", which failed to chart, in 1969.

The Originals found their biggest commercial success under the guidance of Marvin Gaye, who co-wrote and produced two of the group's biggest singles, the doo-wop influenced ballads "[[Baby, I'm For Real]]" and "[[The Bells (The Originals song)|The Bells]]".<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=1870/1}}</ref> The former was such a hit that the group's debut album, 1969's ''Green Grow The Lilacs'', was soon reissued as ''Baby, I'm For Real''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The latter disc, from 1970's ''Portrait of the Originals'', sold more than one million copies and received a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] awarded by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|R.I.A.A.]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> Both songs became seminal soul music recordings, and both have since been covered: 1990s R&B group [[After 7]] re-recorded "Baby, I'm For Real" and made it a hit again in 1992, while another 1990s R&B group, [[Color Me Badd]], re-recorded "The Bells" for one of their albums.

The release of Originals singles remained constant throughout the early 1970s, although chartings proved lower and more sporadic. The year 1970 saw two album releases and four singles, all of which were Top 20 [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B Hits]]. Ballads like "We Can Make It, Baby"<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and "God Bless Whoever Sent You", both from ''Naturally Together'', continued the group's hit-making streak. "Don't Stop Now", an uptempo number produced by [[Smokey Robinson]], also became popular, despite not being released as a single.

Chart appearances subsequently became less frequent, with only two appearances on any US charts between 1971 and 1975. In this time the group went through changes in personnel and style, with C.P. Spencer leaving in 1972 and being replaced by former Voice Master Ty Hunter.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> 1974's ''Game Called Love'' saw The Originals experimenting with a more country sound<ref name="LarkinGE"/> (surprisingly the title track was written and produced by [[Stevie Wonder]]) and 1975's ''California Sunset'' was an album of modern soul written and produced entirely by [[Lamont Dozier]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> ''Communique'' from 1976 marked the group's first foray into [[disco]], expanded on with 1977's ''Down To Love Town''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In total the group released some eight albums during their tenure at Motown.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

Although the group went on to have more modest success in both the soul and disco fields near the end of the decade, including "[[Down to Love Town]]", a No. 1 [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play|dance chart]] hit, the songs they made with Marvin Gaye are arguably their most memorable and notable. Spencer returned briefly in the late 1970s, but after the death of Ty Hunter, on February 24, 1981,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/deathdate/1981-02-24|title=Artists and bands who died on February 24, 1981|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 2, 2021}}</ref> the group ceased recording and broke up about a year later.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The group had left Motown in 1977, releasing two albums for Columbia and their final album for the independent label Phase II. They later reunited and recorded for [[Ian Levine]]'s [[Motorcity Records]];<ref name="LarkinGE"/> the group recorded several songs together including "Take The Only Way Out" which was scheduled for a single release, and individual members (including former member Joe Stubbs) also made some solo recordings.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The group duetted with former Motown labelmates [[Former Ladies of the Supremes|The Supremes]] for one single, "Back By Popular Demand" in 1991.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Freddie Gorman also released a handful of solo singles in the 1980s and later released a solo CD (as Freddi G) entitled ''It's All About Love'' (1997).

[[Joe Stubbs]], brother of [[Four Tops]] lead [[Levi Stubbs]], died on February 5, 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1998.html|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 1998 - 1999|website=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com|access-date=October 2, 2021}}</ref>  He had been with the group for about six months in 1966, as well a member of [[The Falcons]], [[The Contours]], and [[100 Proof (Aged In Soul)]].  C. P. Spencer died on October 20, 2004, and the group's spokesman, Freddie Gorman, followed on June 13, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Originals|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-originals-p5076/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 26, 2012}}</ref>  Walter Gaines died January 17, 2012, after a long illness.<ref name="Dead">{{Cite web|url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2012.html|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club - 2012 January To June|website=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com|access-date=October 2, 2021}}</ref> Dixon is now the only surviving, and active, founding member of the original group.

==Reformation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Following the death of Freddie Gorman in 2006, longtime member Hank Dixon and Hank's daughter Terrie Dixon reformed The Originals as a live touring act, with Freddie's son songwriter and producer Dillon F. Gorman, plus the son of [[Gene Chandler]], Defrantz Forrest, to complete the line-up.
