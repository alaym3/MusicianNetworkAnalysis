'''Presence''' were a British [[rock music|rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] started by Gary Biddles, [[Lol Tolhurst]], and [[Michael Dempsey]]. Dempsey and Tolhurst were founding members of [[The Cure]], and Biddles was a former Cure [[roadie]] who previously played in [[Fools Dance]] with [[Simon Gallup]].

In their brief existence, the band only recorded two albums. Their debut album, ''[[Inside (Presence album)|Inside]]'', was released in the UK through Reality Records in 1992 and in the US through Smash Records, a subsidiary of [[Island Records]], in 1993. They initially began recording their second album, ''[[Closer (Presence album)|Closer]]'', that same year with former [[The Smiths]] [[record producer|producer]] [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]]<ref name="Levinhurst">{{Cite web|url=http://www.levinhurst.com/cgi/Blah/Blah.pl?b=cc,m=1122314484|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527050026/http://www.levinhurst.com/cgi/Blah/Blah.pl?b=cc,m=1122314484|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-05-27|title=Morrissey and The Smiths :: Levinhurst}}</ref> at the helm but it wound up being shelved for a little over two decades. The album was posthumously released on 28 April 2014, a year after the death of Gary Biddles.

==History==
In 1990, Dempsey, Tolhurst and Biddles were [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] [[demo (music)|demo]]s together with a view to forming a new band following Tolhurst's departure from The Cure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecure.com/archive/curenewspages/cn9link.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000152/http://www.thecure.com/archive/curenewspages/cn9link.html|url-status=dead|title="Interview with Robert Smith" 5 August 2007|archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref>  With the addition of [[keyboardist]] Chris Youdell (of [[Then Jerico]]) and [[drummer]] Alan Burgess the band emerged in 1991 as Presence with the [[single (music)|singles]], "In Wonder" and "All I See". Dempsey received [[songwriter|co-writing]] credit for "Amazed"; the [[A-side and B-side|b-side]] of "All I See",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Presence-All-I-See/release/581761|title=Presence (4) - All I See|website=Discogs.com}}</ref> but took a background role as a [[session musician|session]] [[bassist]], and did not appear in the band's photos or press releases. [[Porl Thompson]] also made guest appearances on guitar for some of these recordings, but by 1992 both Dempsey and Thompson were officially replaced by bassist Roberto Soave (formerly of [[Associates (new wave duo)|The Associates]] and [[Shelleyan Orphan]]) and guitarist Rob Steen respectively. However, Dempsey received co-writing credits for two tracks on ''Inside''.<ref name="inside allmusic">{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r169382 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic review |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2012-05-20}}</ref> Although ''Inside'' was well received by [[music journalism|critics]], the album was a commercial failure, and led to the dissolution of the band. Tolhurst confirmed in an interview several years later that Presence had recorded a second album, which was [[record producer|produced]] by former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] producer [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]].<ref name="Levinhurst"/> In retrospect, Tolhurst has stated he felt the band "was really too much too soon I felt for me".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny2/graveconcerns/interview_levinhurst.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050218101735/http://www.angelfire.com/ny2/graveconcerns/interview_levinhurst.html|url-status=dead|title="Interview with Lol" 1 August 2007|archive-date=18 February 2005}}</ref> but he does not discount his experience with Presence either.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chaindlk.com/interviews/|title=Interviews|date=19 April 2010|website=Chain D.L.K.}}</ref>

Since the breakup of Presence, Roberto Soave and Rob Steen have played in another band called [[Babacar (band)|Babacar]] along with [[Boris Williams]] of The Cure and Caroline Crawley of Shelleyan Orphan.<ref>{{cite web|last=Snyder |first=Adja |url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r512788 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic review |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref> Tolhurst is focusing on his current project [[Levinhurst]] with his wife [[Cindy Levinson]] on vocals.

In December 2011, ''Inside'' was made available in [[MP3]] format through [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[iTunes]] for the first time; its track list was expanded to include the b-sides from those sessions. In March 2013, their unreleased second album ''Closer'' was made available for listening in its entirety through [[SoundCloud]].

In February 2013, it was announced on their [[Facebook]] page that the band were in the process of writing new songs but Gary Biddles died that April. On 21 April 2014, it was announced on their Facebook page that ''Closer'' would be released on [[iTunes]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Google Play]], and other sites.
