'''Alkaline Trio''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Exposito |first1=Suzy |title=Alkaline Trio on How Depression, Trump-Era Mayhem Fueled Their New LP |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/alkaline-trio-interview-new-record-is-this-thing-cursed-708241/ |access-date=20 July 2019 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=August 9, 2018}}</ref> Since 2001, the band has consisted of [[Matt Skiba]] (vocals, guitar), [[Dan Andriano]] (vocals, bass) and [[Derek Grant (drummer)|Derek Grant]] (drums, vocals).

Founded in late 1996 by Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, "[[Sundials (song)|Sundials]]", in 1997. Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Andriano. The band subsequently recorded an EP, ''[[For Your Lungs Only]]'' (1998), and its debut studio album, ''[[Goddamnit]]'' (1998). Following the release of the band's second album, ''[[Maybe I'll Catch Fire]]'' (2000), Porter left the band and was replaced by [[Mike Felumlee]] for its subsequent album, ''[[From Here to Infirmary]]'' (2001).

Backed by the singles "[[Stupid Kid]]" and "[[Private Eye (song)|Private Eye]]", ''From Here to Infirmary'' significantly increased the band's exposure, and its follow-up, ''[[Good Mourning]]'' (2003), charted highly on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''Good Mourning'' marked the recording debut of current drummer Derek Grant. In 2005, the band released ''[[Crimson (Alkaline Trio album)|Crimson]]'' which expanded upon the band's punk rock influences, with prominent [[overdubs]] and additional instrumentation, and continued with this direction on ''[[Agony & Irony]]'' (2008), which was released on Epic Records.

In 2010, the band released ''[[This Addiction]]'' on its own label Heart & Skull and [[Epitaph records|Epitaph]]. Recorded in the band's home town of [[Chicago]], with early producer Matt Allison, the album was a conscious effort by the band to return to their punk rock roots; it became the highest-charting album of their career, debuting on the ''Billboard'' 200 at No.&nbsp;11. In 2011, the band celebrated its 15-year anniversary with the release of ''[[Damnesia]]'', which featured new, [[acoustic music|acoustic]]-based recordings of songs from across the band's career. The band's eighth studio album, ''[[My Shame Is True]]'', was released on April 2, 2013.

Their ninth album, ''[[Is This Thing Cursed?]]'' was released on August 31, 2018, followed by a three track [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''E.P.'' which was released on March 19, 2020.

== History ==
===Early years, ''Goddamnit'' and ''Maybe I'll Catch Fire'' (1996–2000)===
Alkaline Trio was formed in December 1996, originally consisting of [[Matt Skiba]] (guitar/lead vocals), Rob Doran (bass/vocals), and [[Glenn Porter]] (drums/vocals). 1997 saw the release of the band's first EP, ''[[Sundials (Alkaline Trio EP)|Sundials]]''. This was followed shortly after by the departure of Rob Doran, after which [[Dan Andriano]], former singer of [[Asian Man Records]] band [[Tuesday (band)|Tuesday]] and bassist for [[Slapstick (band)|Slapstick]], took his place and they began recording. The band released their second EP entitled ''[[For Your Lungs Only]]'', in 1998. Later that year, the band released their first full-length [[album]], ''[[Goddamnit]]'',<ref name="gd"/> followed by ''[[Maybe I'll Catch Fire]]'' in 2000, both on [[Asian Man Records]]).<ref name="micf">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/maybe-ill-catch-fire-mw0000053154 |title=Maybe I'll Catch Fire - Alkaline Trio: Songs, Reviews Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |access-date=May 19, 2013}}</ref> In 1999, the band released the [[I Lied My Face Off]] EP on [[Asian Man Records]] and filmed their first music video, directed by [[Link 80]] guitarist [[Matt Bettinelli-Olpin]]. Also in 2000, the band released a collection of their previously released [[Extended play|EPs]] on their self-titled album.

=== ''From Here to Infirmary'' and ''Good Mourning'' (2001–04) ===
In 2001, the band released ''[[From Here To Infirmary]]'' on [[Vagrant Records]].<ref name="fhti">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/from-here-to-infirmary-mw0000001758 |title=From Here to Infirmary - Alkaline Trio: Songs, Reviews Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |access-date=May 19, 2013}}</ref> This album inspired music videos for the singles "Stupid Kid" and "Private Eye." The album was the band's first album to reach above ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' top 200 mark and the first to gross six figures in sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/588/This_Addiction#albdesc |title=This Addiction Album info at Epitaph |website=Epitaph.com |access-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906022101/http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/588/This_Addiction#albdesc |archive-date=September 6, 2011 }}</ref>

Their next full-length album was ''[[Good Mourning]]'', released in 2003,<ref name="gm">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/good-mourning-mw0000029897 |title=Good Mourning - Alkaline Trio: Songs, Reviews Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |access-date=May 19, 2013}}</ref> with the album's launch single "We've Had Enough" seeing much the same success as the previous single "[[Stupid Kid]]". The album was something of a departure from earlier works, featuring greater production values.

The band appeared on various compilation albums, notably ''Plea for Peace'' Vol. 1, ''Vagrant Records: Another Year on the Streets'' Vol. 1, 2, and 3, and ''[[Rock Against Bush]]'' Vol. 1. Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano have both independently recorded split records, Skiba with [[Kevin Seconds]] on Asian Man Records and Andriano with Mike Felumlee on Double Zero Records, as well as jointly performing backing vocal duties on the album ''This is Unity Music'' by [[Common Rider]]. They recorded two split EPs: one with [[Hot Water Music]] in 2002<ref name="athwm">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/alkaline-trio-hot-water-music-split-cd-mw0000210241 |title=Alkaline Trio/Hot Water Music [Split CD] - Alkaline Trio, Hot Water Music: Songs, Reviews Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |access-date=May 19, 2013}}</ref> and the other with [[One Man Army (band)|One Man Army]] in 2004.<ref name="byo5">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/byo-split-series-vol-5-mw0000697792 |title=BYO Split Series, Vol. 5 - Alkaline Trio, One Man Army: Songs, Reviews Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |access-date=May 19, 2013}}</ref>

In 2004, Andriano became a member of [[The Falcon (band)|The Falcon]], a group consisting of [[The Lawrence Arms]]' bassist [[Brendan Kelly (musician)|Brendan Kelly]], previously of [[Slapstick (band)|Slapstick]] (alongside Andriano) and [[The Broadways]], and drummer [[Neil Hennessy]]. The Falcon also saw contributions from [[Todd Mohney]] of [[The Killing Tree]] and formerly [[Rise Against]]. The band released an EP, ''God Don't Make No Trash / Up Your Ass With Broken Glass'' in 2005 and its first full-length, ''[[Unicornography]]'' in September 2006.

=== ''Crimson'' and ''Agony & Irony'' (2005–08) ===
Alkaline Trio released their fifth studio album on Vagrant Records, titled ''[[Crimson (Alkaline Trio album)|Crimson]]'',<ref name="crim"/> on May 24, 2005, which featured the single "Time to Waste." The single for this song also included bonus tracks produced by [[Squirtgun]] and [[Common Rider]] bassist [[Mass Giorgini]]. The tracks "Mercy Me" and "Burn" have also been released as singles from the album.

In December 2005, a dual-disc special edition re-release of ''Crimson'' hit store shelves. This album features the original cut of ''Crimson'' released earlier in the year, while the 2nd disc has demo and acoustic/live versions of some of the songs. Additionally, an enhanced version of the lyrics and liner notes are available for download with personal messages from the band members on the history and/or inspiration(s) behind the songs.

In September 2006, ''[[Patent Pending (album)|Patent Pending]]'', the debut album by [[Matt Skiba]]'s side project [[Heavens (band)|Heavens]] was released. The band consisted of Skiba on guitar and vocals, and [[Josiah Steinbrick]] (of [[hardcore punk]] outfit [[F-Minus]]) on bass. On the album, the duo were joined by [[The Mars Volta]]'s [[Isaiah "Ikey" Owens]] on organ and [[Matthew Compton]] on drums and percussion. Skiba was playing with Heavens during a short tour in the fall of 2006.

In October 2006, it was announced that Alkaline Trio had signed with [[V2 Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/20262 |title=V2 signs Alkaline Trio |website=Punknews.org |access-date=July 1, 2011}}</ref> On January 12, 2007, the North America branch of the label announced that they were undergoing [[restructuring]] to focus on their back catalogue and digital distribution. As a result, their employees were let go and their roster of artists left as free agents.

January 30, 2007 marked the release of ''[[Remains (Alkaline Trio album)|Remains]]'' an album of B-sides, rarities and live performances. An accompanying DVD contained performances from The Occult Roots Tour and all the band's music videos to date. This marked the end of their association with Vagrant Records.

During late May 2007 the band began listing [[Epic Records]] as its label on their MySpace.

===''This Addiction'' (2009–11)===
During a concert in May 2009, the band revealed that they were no longer signed to Epic Records and that they would be releasing new material through their own label later in the year. Recording began that July.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newmusicreviews.net/alkaline-trio-get-back-to-diy-roots/ |title=Alkaline Trio Get Back To D.I.Y.

On December 1, Alkaline Trio confirmed to [[Rock Sound]] that the title of their new album would be ''[[This Addiction]]'': <blockquote>"It is the first song on the record and the title of our new album," said vocalist Matt Skiba. "The song takes heroin addiction as a metaphor for love. The whole record is really personal, all three of us have been through quite a bit since our last album [2008's ''[[Agony & Irony]]''] and it is all expressed through this, all the songs are about the relationships we've been in and so the record has a constant theme."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/alkaline-trio-confirm-new-album-title |title=Alkaline Trio Confirm New Album Title &#124; News &#124; Rock Sound |website=Rocksound.tv |access-date=2011-07-01}}</ref></blockquote> The album debuted at No.&nbsp;11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it the highest the band has ever charted to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200#/charts/billboard-200 |title=Music Albums, Top 200 Albums & Music Album Charts |website=Billboard.com |access-date=July 1, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629192518/http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200| archive-date= June 29, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

While the production of the ninth album was postponed by Matt Skiba's work with [[Blink-182]], in an interview on July 3, 2016, Skiba assured that the album would move forward, saying, "I’ll be writing for a new Alkaline Trio record while on this summer tour so once things with Blink cool down a bit, the Trio can go in and make a new record and start touring again while Blink is on break. [...] It’s such a unique and wonderful position to be in, having two full time bands that people – myself included – are big fans of.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/alkaline-trios-matt-skiba-joining-8327757|title=Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba on joining Blink-182 for new album and tour|website=Dailyrecord.co.uk|date=July 2, 2016}}</ref>

Andriano stated that “There’s not an inch of me that feels like we’re done making music, or we’re done making new stuff. I wanna be a band that people want to hear new stuff from.
