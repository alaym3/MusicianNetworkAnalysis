Shakira entered the English-language market with her fifth album, ''[[Laundry Service]]'' (2001), which sold over 13 million copies worldwide. Buoyed by the international number-one singles "[[Whenever, Wherever]]" and "[[Underneath Your Clothes]]", the album propelled her reputation as a leading [[crossover artist]]. [[Broadcast Music, Inc.]], the largest music rights organization in the United States, described Shakira as a pioneer who extended the global reach of Latino singers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Shakira|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20000501shakira|access-date=June 23, 2021|website=BMI|date=30 April 2000}}</ref>

Her success was further solidified with the Spanish albums ''[[Fijación Oral, Vol. 1]]'' (2005), ''[[Sale el Sol]]'' (2010), and ''[[El Dorado (Shakira album)|El Dorado]]'' (2017), all of which topped the [[Billboard Top Latin Albums|''Billboard'' Top Latin Albums]] chart and were certified [[RIAA certification|diamante]] by  the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].

==Early life==
Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll was born on 2 February 1977 in [[Barranquilla]], Colombia. She is the only child of William Mebarak Chadid and Nidia Ripoll Torrado.

Shakira wrote her first poem, titled "La rosa de cristal" ('The Crystal Rose'), when she was only four years old.<ref name=":1" /> As she was growing up, she was fascinated watching her father writing stories on a [[typewriter]],<ref name=":1" /> and asked for one as a Christmas gift. She got that typewriter at age seven,<ref name=":1" /> and has continued writing poetry since then. These poems eventually evolved into songs. When Shakira was two years old, an older half-brother was killed in a motorcycle accident; six years later, at age eight, Shakira wrote her first song, titled "Tus gafas oscuras" ('Your dark glasses'), which was inspired by her father, who for years wore dark glasses to hide his grief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redbalcony.com/?aid=167 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313023804/http://www.redbalcony.com/?aid=167 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 March 2008 |title=Shakira |publisher=RedBalcony |access-date=5 March 2010 }}</ref>

When Shakira was four, her father took her to a local Middle Eastern restaurant, where Shakira first heard the [[doumbek]], a traditional drum used in [[Middle Eastern music|Middle-Eastern music]] and which typically accompanied [[belly dancing]].<ref name=rollingstone /> She started dancing on the table, and the experience made her realize that she wanted to be a performer. She enjoyed singing for schoolmates and teachers (and even the nuns) at her Catholic school, but in second grade, she was rejected for the school choir because her [[vibrato]] was too strong. The music teacher told her that she sounded "like a goat".<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/shakira/articles/story/5937750/shakira |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429094152/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/shakira/articles/story/5937750/shakira |archive-date=29 April 2009 |title=Cover Story: Shakira |access-date=24 April 2007 |last=Wright |first=Evan |date=11 April 2002 |work=Rolling Stone |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_1890000/1890956.stm|title=Shakira: 'I don't hate Britney'|publisher=BBC|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> She says she had also been known as "the belly dancer girl", as she would demonstrate every Friday at school a number she had learned.<ref name=rollingstone /> "That's how I discovered my passion for live performance," she says.<ref name=usaweekend>Katz, Gregory.

To instill gratitude in Shakira for her upbringing, her father took her to a local park to see orphans who lived there. The images stayed with her, and she said to herself: "One day I'm going to help these kids when I become a famous artist."<ref name=ShakiraTimes200903 />

Between ages ten and thirteen, Shakira was invited to various events in Barranquilla and gained some recognition in the area.<ref name="Gale">{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.com/free_resources/chh/bio/shakira.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020213053603/http://www.gale.com/free_resources/chh/bio/shakira.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 February 2002 |title=Shakira |publisher=Gale |access-date=3 October 2012 }}</ref> It was at this approximate time that she met local theater producer Monica Ariza, who was impressed with her and as a result tried to help her career. During a flight from Barranquilla to [[Bogotá]], Ariza convinced [[Sony]] Colombia executive Ciro Vargas to hold an audition for Shakira in a hotel lobby. Vargas held Shakira in high regard and, returning to the Sony office, gave the cassette to a song and artist director. However, the director was not overly excited and thought Shakira was something of "a lost cause". Undaunted and still convinced that Shakira had talent, Vargas set up an audition in Bogotá. He arranged for Sony Colombia executives to arrive at the audition, with the idea of surprising them with Shakira's performance. She performed three songs for the executives and impressed them enough for her to be signed to record three albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/96614/episode_about.jhtml |title=Driven: Shakira |access-date=24 April 2007 |publisher=VH1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721213102/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/96614/episode_about.jhtml |archive-date=21 July 2006 }}</ref>

==Career==
===1990–1995: Beginnings===
Shakira's debut album, ''[[Magia (Shakira album)|Magia]]'', was recorded with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Colombia]] in 1990 when she was only 13 years old.<ref name="Shakira biography">{{cite web |url=http://shakira-bio.tumblr.com/|title=Shakira's Biography |publisher=shakira-bio.tumblr.com}}</ref> The songs are a collection made by her since she was eight,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Janes|first=DeAnna|date=14 October 2019|title=Each of These Shakira Songs Will Get You Pumped for Her Super Bowl Performance|url=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/g29444238/best-shakira-songs/|access-date=9 November 2020|website=Oprah Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref> mixed [[pop-rock]] [[ballad]]s and [[disco]] uptempo songs with electronic accompaniment. The album was released in June 1991 and featured "Magia" and three other singles. Though it fared well on Colombian radio and gave the young Shakira much exposure, the album did not fare well commercially, as only 1,200 copies were sold worldwide.<ref name="rollingstone" /> After the poor performance of ''Magia'', Shakira's label urged her to return to the studio to release a follow-up record. Though she was little known outside of her native Colombia at the time, Shakira was invited to perform at Chile's [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]] in February 1993. The festival gave aspiring Latin American singers a chance to perform their songs, and the winner was then chosen by a panel of judges. Shakira performed the ballad "Eres" ("You Are") and won the trophy for third place. One of the judges who voted for her to win was the then 20-year-old [[Ricky Martin]],<ref name="Shakira biography" /> whose initial prominence had come from his membership in [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]].

Shakira's second studio album, titled ''[[Peligro (Shakira album)|Peligro]]'', was released in March, but Shakira was not pleased with the final result, mainly taking issue with the production. The album was better received than ''Magia'' had been, though it was also considered a commercial failure due to Shakira's refusal to advertise or promote it. Shakira then decided to take a hiatus from recording so that she could graduate from high school.<ref name="Shakira biography" /> In the same year, Shakira starred in the Colombian TV series ''The Oasis'', loosely based on the [[Armero tragedy]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/shakira/artist.jhtml|title=Shakira&nbsp;– Full Biography |access-date =20 March 2010|last= Huey|first=Steve|publisher=MTV }}</ref> Since then, the albums have been pulled from release and are not considered official Shakira albums but rather promotional albums.

===1995–2000: Latin breakthrough===
Shakira originally recorded the song "[[¿Dónde Estás Corazón?]]" (later released on her album ''Pies Descalzos'') for the compilation album ''Nuestro Rock'' in 1994, released exclusively in Colombia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Nuestro-Rock-Volumen-II/release/14485287|title=Nuestro Rock Volumen II (1994, CD)|access-date=17 August 2021|website=Discogs.com}}</ref> The song was an instant success on radio stations in Colombia and Sony decided to finance her third record, by giving her the last chance due to previous commercial failures.

Shakira returned to recording music under Sony Music along with [[Columbia Records]] in 1995 with Luis F. Ochoa, using musical influences from a number of countries and an [[Alanis Morissette]]-oriented persona which affected two of her next albums.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/30/AR2006083003265.html|title=In Any Language, a Whole Lotta Shakira Goin' On|access-date =22 January 2007|last= Freedom du Lac|first=Josh.|date=31 August 2006 |work=The Washington Post }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2019}}  These recordings spawned her third studio album, and her international debut album, titled ''[[Pies Descalzos]]''. Recording for the album began in February 1995, after the success of her single "¿Dónde Estás Corazón?".

The album, ''[[Pies Descalzos]]'', was released in October 1995 in the Latin American countries and in February 1996 in the US. It reached number five on the U.S. [[Billboard Top Latin Albums]] chart. The album spawned six hit singles, "[[Estoy Aquí]]", which reached number two on the U.S. Latin chart, "[[¿Dónde Estás Corazón?]]" which reached number five on the U.S. Latin chart, "[[Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos]]" which reached number 11 on the U.S. Latin chart, "[[Un Poco de Amor]]" which reached number six on the U.S. Latin chart, "[[Antología (Shakira song)|Antología]]" which reached number 15 on the U.S. Latin chart, and "[[Se quiere, Se Mata]]" which reached number eight on the U.S. Latin chart.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=shakira|chart=all}}|title=Billboard&nbsp;– Artist Chart History: Shakira|work=Billboard}}</ref> In August 1996, [[RIAA]] certified the album platinum status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=PiesDescalzos&artist=&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907122008/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=PiesDescalzos&artist=&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 September 2014|title=RIAA: Gold & Platinum.

In March 1996, Shakira went on to her first international tour, named simply the ''[[Tour Pies Descalzos]]''. The tour consisted of 20 shows and ended in 1997.

Her fourth studio album was titled ''[[Dónde Están los Ladrones?]]'' Produced by Shakira with [[Emilio Estefan, Jr.]] as the executive producer it was released in September 1998. The album, inspired by an incident in an airport in which a suitcase filled with her written lyrics was stolen, became a bigger hit than ''Pies Descalzos''. The album has reached a peak position of number 131 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 and held the top spot on the U.S. Latin Albums chart for 11 weeks.

===2001–2004: English transition with ''Laundry Service''===
Upon the success of ''Dónde Están los Ladrones?'' and ''MTV Unplugged'', Shakira began working on an English [[crossover album]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/apr/18/entertainment/ca-28407|title=Queen of Crossover?|work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=21 June 2016|first=Alisa | last=Valdes-Rodriguez}}</ref> She learned English with the help of [[Gloria Estefan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latintimes.com/gloria-estefan-reveals-she-taught-shakira-how-speak-english-her-2001-laundry-service-album-136631 |title=Gloria Estefan Reveals She Taught Shakira How To Speak English For Her 2001 'Laundry Service' Album |work=Los Angeles Times |date=5 December 2013 |access-date=16 July 2018 }}</ref> She worked for over a year on new material for the album. "[[Whenever, Wherever]]", called "[[Whenever, Wherever|Suerte]]" in Spanish-speaking countries, was released as the first and lead single from her first English album and fifth studio album throughout the period between August 2001 and February 2002. The song took heavy influence from [[Andean music]], including the [[charango]] and [[panpipes]] in its instrumentation. It became an international success by reaching number one in most countries. It was also her first success in the U.S., by reaching number six on the Hot 100.

[[File:Shakira in concert.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Shakira before entering the stage to her [[Tour of the Mongoose]] in 2003]]
Shakira's fifth studio album and first English language album, titled ''[[Laundry Service]]'' in English-speaking countries and ''Servicio De Lavanderia'' in Latin America and Spain, was released on 13 November 2001. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 chart, selling over 200,000 records in its first week. The album was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA in June 2004 as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000509297 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017115118/http://billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000509297 |archive-date=17 October 2007 |title=Ask Billboard |work=Billboard |date=12 May 2004 |access-date=31 October 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> It helped to establish Shakira's musical presence in the mainstream North American market.

Because the album was created for the English-language market, the rock and Spanish dance-influenced album gained mild critical success, with some critics claiming that her English skills were too weak for her to write songs for it; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', for one, stated that "she sounds downright silly" or "Shakira's magic is lost in translation".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Lechner|first1=Ernesto|title=Shakira: Laundry Service|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/laundry-service-20011017|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=17 October 2001|access-date=11 May 2017}}</ref> A similar view was expressed by Elizabeth Mendez Berry in ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'': "While her Spanish-language albums sparkled with elegant wordplay, this record is rife with cliches, both musically and lyrically.

In October, she won five [[MTV Video Music Awards Latin America]] for Best Female Artist, Best Pop Artist, Best Artist&nbsp;– North (Region), Video of the Year (for "Suerte"), and Artist of the Year. In November, she embarked on the [[Tour of the Mongoose]] with 61 shows occurring by May 2003. The tour was also her first worldwide tour, as legs were played in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Shakira's label, Sony BMG, also released her Spanish greatest-hits compilation, ''[[Grandes Éxitos (Shakira album)|Grandes Éxitos]]''. A DVD and 10-track live album, titled ''[[Live & Off the Record]]'', was also released in 2004, commemorating the Tour of the Mongoose.

===2005–2007: ''Fijación Oral, Volumen Uno'' and ''Oral Fixation, Volume Two''===
Shakira's sixth studio album, ''[[Fijación Oral, Vol. 1|Fijación Oral, Volumen Uno]]'', was released in June 2005. The lead single from the album, "[[La Tortura]]", reached the top 40 on the Hot 100. The song also featured the Spanish balladeer [[Alejandro Sanz]]. Shakira; Sanz and [[Daddy Yankee]] ("[[Gasolina]]") were the first artists to perform Spanish language songs at the [[2005 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The album was extremely well received. It debuted at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, selling 157,000 copies in its first week. It has since sold over two million copies in the U.S., earning an 11× Platinum (Latin field) certification from the RIAA. Due to its first week sales, the album became the highest debut ever for a Spanish language album. After only a day of release in Latin America, the album earned certifications. In Venezuela, it earned a Platinum certification, in Colombia, a triple Platinum certification, while in Mexico demand exceeded shipments and the album was unavailable after only one day of release. Four other singles were also released from the album: "[[No (Shakira song)|No]]", "[[Día de Enero]]", "[[La Pared (Shakira song)|La Pared]]", and "[[Las de la Intuición]]".

The lead single for Shakira's seventh album, ''[[Oral Fixation, Vol. 2]]'', "[[Don't Bother]]", failed to achieve chart success in the U.S. by missing the top 40 on the Hot 100. It did, however, reach the top 20 in most countries worldwide. Shakira's second English studio album and seventh studio album, ''Oral Fixation, Vol. 2'', was released on 29 November 2005. The album debuted at number five on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling 128,000 copies in its first week.

In early 2007, Shakira worked with American [[R&B]] singer [[Beyoncé]] Knowles for the track "[[Beautiful Liar]]", which was released as the second single from the deluxe edition of Beyoncé's album ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]''.

===Financial controversy===
In November 2017, Shakira was named in the [[Paradise Papers]]. It was revealed that she was the sole shareholder of a Malta-based company which was being used to transfer $30 million in [[music rights]]. Her attorneys insisted that her use of the company was entirely legal.<ref name="scilla">{{cite news |last1=Alecci |first1=Scilla |title=Shakira, Nicole Kidman, Akira Toriyama offshore links revealed in Paradise Papers |url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/6069/ |access-date=2 November 2021 |publisher=[[ICIJ]] |date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 2018, due at least in part to information revealed in the Paradise Papers, Spanish authorities began an investigation into Shakira's finances.<ref name="scilla" /> Prosecutors argued that she did not pay taxes in Spain between 2012 and 2014, during which time she was living in Spain with Piqué and their family, while Shakira argued that she maintained her [[primary residence]] in the Bahamas during that period and otherwise was touring internationally. In July 2021, a Spanish judge ruled that there was "evidence of criminality" sufficient for Shakira to be brought to trial on charges of [[tax fraud]].<ref name="trial">{{cite news |last1=Nolan |first1=Emma |title=Shakira tax evasion charges explained as singer likely to face trial |url=https://www.newsweek.com/shakira-tax-evasion-charges-explained-singer-likely-face-trial-1614242 |access-date=2 November 2021 |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=29 July 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

In 2021, the [[Pandora Papers]] showed that Shakira submitted applications for three offshore companies in 2019. Her representatives told [[LaSexta]] that this paperwork was not filed for purposes of establishing new companies but as part of the process of dissolving existing companies. They further claimed that the companies had no income or activities and that Spanish authorities had been made aware of their existence.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McGoey |first1=Sean |title=5 ways celebrities in the Pandora Papers use the offshore system |url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/shakira-sachin-julio-celebrities-use-offshore/ |access-date=2 November 2021 |publisher=[[ICIJ]] |date=October 4, 2021}}</ref>
