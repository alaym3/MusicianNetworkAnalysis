'''Candlebox''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Since its formation in 1990, the group has released seven [[studio album]]s, several charting [[single (music)|singles]], [[The Best of Candlebox|a compilation]], and a CD+DVD.

Candlebox found immediate success with the release of its [[Candlebox (album)|self-titled debut album]] in July 1993. ''Candlebox'' featured four singles: "Change", "[[You (Candlebox song)|You]]", "[[Far Behind]]" and "Cover Me". "Far Behind" reached the top 20, and the album was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&title=candlebox&artist=candlebox&perPage=25 |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum Database |date=September 21, 2004 |access-date=April 14, 2012}}</ref> The band's next album, ''[[Lucy (Candlebox album)|Lucy]]'' (1995), was certified gold,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=CANDLEBOX&ti=LUCY |title=Gold & Platinum |publisher=RIAA |date=1996-01-08 |access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref> and was followed three years later by ''[[Happy Pills]]'' (1998).

==History==
===Early career (1990–1992)===
Formed in November 1990, Candlebox originally consisted of lead singer Kevin Martin, guitarist Peter Klett, bassist Bardi Martin, and drummer Scott Mercado.<ref name="Glowing Soul">[http://www.candleboxrocks.com/pdf/keepinyaregular-vol4-issue2-dec98.pdf Glowing Soul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124133349/http://candleboxrocks.com/pdf/keepinyaregular-vol4-issue2-dec98.pdf |date=November 24, 2010 }} ''keepinyaregular'' Volume 4, Issue 2 (December 1998).

===Rise to fame (1993–2000)===
Candlebox began performing live in 1991. By 1992 the band was playing regularly in some of Seattle's top clubs (including RKCNDY and Farside) to ever increasing audiences.

The band's eight-song EP gained the attention of [[Maverick Records]],<ref name="playgirl">Nussbaum, Beth R. [http://www.candleboxrocks.com/pdf/playgirl-apr94.pdf Set to Ignite: Candlebox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124133209/http://candleboxrocks.com/pdf/playgirl-apr94.pdf |date=November 24, 2010 }} ''[[Playgirl]]'' (April 1994). Retrieved on 12-12-10.</ref> with whom the band signed.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Candlebox was the first successful act on [[Maverick Records]], which went on to sign [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Deftones]] and [[The Prodigy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

On July 20, 1993, Candlebox released its [[Candlebox (album)|self-titled debut album]]. It sold more than four million copies and peaked at No.&nbsp;7 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s album charts. ''Candlebox'' featured the hit singles "Change", "[[You (Candlebox song)|You]]", "[[Far Behind]]", and "Cover Me". "Far Behind" entered [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Billboard Hot 100|top 20]] in July 1993, peaked at No.&nbsp;18, and stayed on the charts until January 1994. The tremendous radio, concert, and television success gained Candlebox an opening slot for [[Rush (band)|Rush]] on their ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]'' tour and [[Metallica]] on their [[Shit Hits the Sheds Tour]], as well as a main-stage slot at [[Woodstock '94]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rush.com/tour/counterparts/ |title=Counterparts Tour |website=Rush.com |access-date=2021-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metallica.com/tour/past/?year=1994&start=42&sz=21 |title=Events |website=Metallica.com |access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1994-08-12-9408120101-story.html|title=MTV, PAY-PER-VIEW TO FEATURE WOODSTOCK '94 THIS WEEKEND|access-date=March 8, 2021|last=Catlin|first=Roger|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=August 12, 1994}}</ref> They also played with bands like [[Living Colour]], [[The Offspring]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Radiohead]] and [[The Flaming Lips]], and by the end of 1994, the band had graduated to headlining their own tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1994-11-10-9411100039-story.html|title=A STEADY CLIMB FOR CANDLEBOX|access-date=March 8, 2021|last=Catlin|first=Roger|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=August 12, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://vegasnews.com/154786/multi-platinum-grunge-rock-band-candlebox-to-perform-at-the-suncoast-showroom-nov-12.html|title=Multi-Platinum Grunge Rock Band Candlebox to Perform at the Suncoast Showroom Nov. 12|access-date=March 8, 2021|work=Vegas News|date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> In addition, Candlebox won ''[[Metal Edge]]'' magazine's 1994 Readers' Choice Award for Best New Band.<ref>''[[Metal Edge]]'', June 1995</ref>

Hot off the success of ''Candlebox'', the band was eager to progress and by April 1994 had 36 new songs for a follow-up record.<ref name="playgirl" /> On October 3, 1995, Candlebox released its second album, ''[[Lucy (Candlebox album)|Lucy]]''. Although it marked the beginning of the band's decline in popularity, ''Lucy'' was certified [[Gold album|gold]] thanks to singles such as "Simple Lessons" and "Understanding". Two days after the release of ''Lucy'', Candlebox appeared on ''[[Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon]]'' with its [[cover version|cover]] of "Steel and Glass". After spending the remainder of 1995 and most of 1996 touring behind ''Lucy'' (including playing with bands like [[Our Lady Peace]], [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]], [[Seaweed (band)|Seaweed]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] and [[Stabbing Westward]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/candlebox?page=5 |title=Candlebox's Concert & Tour History |website=concertarchives.org |access-date=2021-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/candlebox?page=4 |title=Candlebox's Concert & Tour History |website=concertarchives.org |access-date=2021-03-08}}</ref> Scott Mercado left the band in 1997 and was replaced by original [[Pearl Jam]] drummer [[Dave Krusen]].

On July 21, 1998, Candlebox released its third studio album, ''[[Happy Pills]]''. While a return to the simpler sound of its debut, it gained only marginal success. The song "Glowing Soul" was also recorded for the soundtrack to ''[[The Waterboy]]'' and included at the request of [[Adam Sandler]]. Inspired by the film, the song was based on a [[Bo Diddley]] rhythm and recorded with vintage equipment.<ref name="Glowing Soul"/>

Krusen departed from Candlebox in 1999 and was replaced by Shannon Larkin of [[Ugly Kid Joe]]. Bardi Martin left to attend college and was replaced by Rob Redick, formerly of [[Dig (band)|Dig]]. By 2000, Candlebox disbanded. According to Martin, the band was unhappy with its record contract and attempted to be freed from Maverick after two years by breaking up. The former Candlebox members would pursue other musical endeavors during the 2000s.

===Reunion (2006–present)===
[[Image:Tgfkevinbigclose.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Kevin Martin in 2010]]In 2006, [[Rhino Records]] planned to release a "[[The Best of Candlebox|Best of]]" compilation of Candlebox, which prompted the original band lineup to reunite for the first time in nearly 10 years (with Sean Hennesy on rhythm guitar). To promote the compilation, Candlebox embarked on a three-month North American tour from July to October of that year. Bardi Martin left the band in 2007 to continue his education to become a lawyer, with [[Adam Kury]] as his replacement. During the time, the band would begin writing new material despite having no record label.<ref name="Candlebox Interview">[http://phantomphotography.com/I_Candlebox.html Candlebox Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101013558/http://phantomphotography.com/I_Candlebox.html |date=January 1, 2011 }} ''Garage Radio Magazine'' (2007).

After several delays, Candlebox released its first album in 10 years, ''[[Into the Sun (Candlebox album)|Into the Sun]],'' on July 22 via Silent Majority/ILG records. The album was produced by [[Ron Aniello]] ([[Lifehouse (band)|Lifehouse]], [[Barenaked Ladies]]) and features performances by both Scott Mercado and [[Dave Krusen]] on drums.  The first single, "Stand", was released to radio in mid-May and Candlebox officially commenced touring in support of the new record in June 2008. "Stand" reached as high as No.&nbsp;15 on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|U.S. Mainstream Rock chart]].

On July 4, 2008 Candlebox performed at the [[O'Fallon, Missouri]] Heritage and Freedom Fest in front of a record crowd. Two months later, the band released a live CD/DVD called ''Alive in Seattle''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012EBU6Q |title=Alive in Seattle: Candlebox: Music |access-date=July 15, 2011}}</ref>

In 2010, Peter Klett and Scott Mercado formed Lotus Crush, consisting of: Terry McDermott (lead vocals), Peter Klett (lead guitar), [[Johnny Bacolas]] (bass), Scott Mercado (drums), and John Luzzi (rhythm guitar).

On April 3, 2012 Candlebox released its fifth studio album, ''[[Love Stories & Other Musings]]'' produced by [[Ken Andrews]] ([[Failure (band)|Failure]]/[[Thousand Foot Krutch]]/[[Lostprophets]]).

Although the band had planned to put out a new album in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsungmelody.com/interviews/believe-in-it-an-interview-with-kevin-martin-of-candlebox/ |title=Believe In It. An interview with Kevin Martin of Candlebox. |publisher=Unsung Melody |date=January 31, 2013 |access-date=February 4, 2013}}</ref> those plans were postponed after Candlebox parted ways with its record label at the time. In 2015, founding members Scott Mercado and Peter Klett announced that they were leaving the band to focus on Lotus Crush; the split was amicable. Sean Hennesy left the band shortly thereafter. Former drummer Dave Krusen rejoined the band, and new members Mike Leslie (lead guitar) and Brian Quinn (rhythm guitar) also joined.
