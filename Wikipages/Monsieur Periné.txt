== History ==

=== Origin ===
[[:es:Catalina García|Catalina García]], a native of [[Cali]], Colombia, studied in the French international school [[Lycée Français Paul Valéry de Cali]] (Spanish: Liceo Francés Paul Valéry de Cali). She later moved with her parents to the United States for two years before returning to Colombia. At eighteen, García moved to [[Bogotá]] to study [[anthropology]] at Javeriana University.

The main members of the group played together for the first time during [[Holy Week]] in 2007, in [[Villa de Leyva]], a small town near Bogotá. Later, García, Santiago Prieto, Nicolás Junca and Camilo Parra (an early member who would later quit), began getting together frequently to play songs from various Latin American genres as well as jazz, which eventually prompted them to begin searching for their own voice.

During 2009 and 2010, they began performing locally in Bogotá; in 2009, they performed in several local music festivals. At the end of 2010, the group began composing its own original songs, recording "Ton Silence" and "Swing with Me".

In 2010, motivated by performing at the [[Ibero-American Theater Festival]], they began to include the work of designer Alejandra Rivas Ramirez. However, it wasn't until 2011, when the group received a national award which allowed them to perform at the [[Estéreo Picnic Festival]], that they began to develop the visual image of Monsieur Periné. This included the use of clothing designed by Rivas, an image concept design by her, and the work of plastics artist José Arboleda.

The band released their first single, "La Muerte", recorded with Felipe Álvarez, who works with artists such as Shakira and Bomba Estéreo. The radio station Radiónica named the song "Song of the Year", which was key in the development of the band.

In 2012, the band released its first music video for their song "Suin Romanticon".

In 2014, Parra left the band to work on his new project, Astrolabio. In 2015, drummer Alejandro Guliani left the band, citing disagreements. The last to leave the project was Rivas Ramirez, the designer of the band's image as well as all of its costumes between 2010 and 2015.

=== Name and beginnings ===
The name of the group arose from Prieto's reading of [[Michel Houellebecq]]'s ''[[The Elementary Particles]]'', which discusses the [[Perineum|périnée]]. The word became a joke among the group, and thus the original name was simply "Periné". García, who initially opposed the name, later added the word "Monsieur", referencing the idea that everything that is French is elegant and refined.

The group began with minor performances at weddings, corporate parties, and cocktail parties. They began to gain recognition in the auditorium of the Alianza Francesa, where they performed a cover of the movie ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'', winning a competition focused on young talent. After this, David González and Miguel Guerra joined the group as double bassist and percussionist, respectively. They began performing at more major events at this time.

The first years of Monsieur Periné's existence served as an experimental period, during which the group sought to find their own style. They became more well-known among the public following wins in two competitions, that of the Urock de Universia and El Ensayadero de Red Bull, where they performed "Be Pop". With this triumph they received a place at the Estereo Picnic Festival, after which Daniel Chebeir joined the band; however, he left two years later, citing personal issues. This left a vacancy in the drummer role, which would be filled by Argentinian Alejandro Giuliani, who accompanied the group on their European tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.periodicolapislazuli.com/entrevista-monsieur=perine.html|title=Entrevista  Monsieur Perine  - Lapislázuli Periódico|last=Lapislázuli|first=Fundación Artística y Cultural|website=www.periodicolapislazuli.com|language=ES|access-date=2017-07-02}}</ref>

=== ''Hecho a Mano'' ===
In 2012, the band released its first album, entitled ''Hecho a Mano'' (English: ''Handmade''). ''Hecho a Mano'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in Colombia and was nominated for a number of categories in the Shock Awards (Spanish: Premios Shock), the largest music awards ceremony in Colombia, receiving two awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://losperines.blogspot.mx/2012/09/monsieur-perine-nominado-los-premios.html|title=Monsieur Periné nominado a los Premios Shock 2012|website=losperines.blogspot.mx|access-date=2017-07-02}}</ref>

The album was released independently in Colombia. It was subsequently released in Mexico, Germany, and Japan. It was followed by the band's first European tour, titled Huracán, in 2013. 

=== ''Caja de Música'' ===
In 2015, the band released its second album, entitled ''Caja de Música'' (English: ''Music Box''). It led to the group winning Best New Artist at the [[16th Annual Latin Grammy Awards]], as well as being nominated for Best Album.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/latin-awards/6770030/latin-grammys-2015-winners-list|title=Latin Grammys 2015: See the Full Winners List|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=2017-07-03}}</ref> It was released by Sony.

=== ''Encanto Tropical'' ===
In 2018, the band released its third album, entitled ''Encanto Tropical'' (English: ''Tropical Charm'') Like ''Caja de Música'', it was released by Sony and produced by [[Visitante|Eduardo Cabra]] of the group [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/monsieur-perin-encanto-tropical-interview-2572954316.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1?rebelltitem=1|title=Monsieur Periné's New Album Keeps It Tropical|date=2018-06-14|website=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>
