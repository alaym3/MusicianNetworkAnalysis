==Career==
Cullum produced his first album, ''[[Heard It All Before (album)|Heard It All Before]]'', with only £480. It was released in 1999 with only 500 copies made.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independentvenueweek.com/2018/01/changing-cultural-currents-a-conversation-about-independence-with-jamie-cullum/ |title=Independent Venue Week - Changing cultural currents: A conversation about independence with Jamie Cullum|website=www.independentvenueweek.com|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> The success of the album led to an invitation to appear on Geoff Gascoyne's album ''Songs of the Summer''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/jamie-cullum|title=Jamie Cullum - Biography|work=[[Contactmusic.com]]}}</ref>

After graduating from Reading University, Cullum released his best-selling album, ''[[Pointless Nostalgic]]'' (2002), which stirred interest from broadcasters [[Michael Parkinson]]<ref name="TeleJamieBatters">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3646379/Jamie-batters-new-life-into-jazz.html|title=Jamie batters new life into jazz|first=Neil|last=McCormick|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=UK|date=8 September 2005}}</ref> and [[Melvyn Bragg]].

Just after Cullum made his first television appearance, on ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', in April 2003, he signed a [[Pound sterling|£]]1m contract<ref name="BBCJazzesUp" /> for three albums with [[Universal Music Group|Universal]], who beat [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] in a bidding war. Cullum's third studio album, ''[[Twentysomething (album)|Twentysomething]]'', released in October 2003, went platinum and became the No.&nbsp;1 selling studio album by a jazz artist in the United Kingdom. Cullum ended 2003 as the UK's biggest selling jazz artist of all time.<ref name="BBCJazzesUp"/>

Although primarily a jazz musician, Cullum performs in a wide range of styles and is generally regarded as a "crossover" artist with his musical roots firmly based in jazz. Cullum draws his inspiration from many different musicians and listens to an eclectic mix of music including [[Miles Davis]].<ref name="Radio2Biog">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/presenters/jamie-cullum/|title=Biography|work=[[BBC Radio 2]]|access-date=23 February 2009}}</ref>

A [[stomp box]] made from a small wooden block (not to be confused with an [[effect pedal]] for guitars) features in Cullum's concerts. The box is used to amplify a musician's tapping foot. Cullum found this in Melbourne, Australia and uses it to enhance upbeat and fast-paced songs such as "[[Seven Nation Army]]", originally by [[The White Stripes]], and "[[Gold Digger (Kanye West song)|Gold Digger]]", originally by [[Kanye West]]. He also often uses a looping machine; this plays a major part in Cullum's versions of "Seven Nation Army" and "[[Teardrop (Massive Attack song)|Teardrop]]" by [[Massive Attack]]. Cullum also [[beatboxing|beatboxes]] at most gigs.

As well as The White Stripes and Kanye West, Cullum has performed work by Massive Attack, [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]], [[Rihanna]], [[Pussycat Dolls]], [[Radiohead]], [[Gnarls Barkley]], [[Elton John]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[John Legend]], [[Joy Division]], [[Lady Gaga]] and many others. He has performed with [[Deltron 3030]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Sugababes]], [[will.i.am]], [[Burt Bacharach]] and The [[Heritage Orchestra]].

Cullum has played at many large music festivals, including [[Festival international de Jazz de Montréal|Festival International de Jazz de Montréal]] (in 2006, 2009 and 2015), [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] (2004, 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018), [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] (2004, 2009 and 2017), [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]] (in 2005), [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival#2005|Coachella]] (2005), [[South by Southwest]] (2004, 2006), [[North Sea Jazz Festival]], the [[Hollywood Bowl]] (performing with the [[Count Basie Orchestra]]), the 2006 [[Playboy Jazz Festival]], the 2007 [[Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival]] and the 2008 [[Monterey Jazz Festival]]. On 30 April 2006 Cullum played his biggest-ever crowd on [[Queensday]] in the Netherlands.

In February 2012, Germany picked [[Roman Lob]] with "[[Standing Still (Roman Lob song)|Standing Still]]", a composition by Cullum alongside [[Steve Robson]] and [[Wayne Hector]], as their entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Roman Lob for Germany with "Standing Still"|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=46563&_t=roman_lob_for_germany_with_standing_still|work=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=16 February 2012|access-date=16 February 2012}}</ref>

In October 2014, Cullum appeared in a comedy sketch with [[Jimmy Carr]] and [[Daisy Lowe]], which was made for Channel 4's ''[[The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night]]'' to raise awareness of testicular cancer.

On 30 April 2016 Cullum played at [[The White House]] in Washington, D.C., as part of the International Jazz Day Global Concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jazzday.com/concert/|title=International Jazz Day|publisher=jazzday.com|access-date=25 October 2016}}</ref>

In January 2017, Cullum appeared as a member of the house band in ITV's ''[[The Halcyon]]''.<ref>{{IMDb name| 1490226}}</ref>

===''Pointless Nostalgic''===
On this album, Cullum created covers of old classics with new arrangements of [[Bob Dorough]]'s composition "Devil May Care", [[Thelonious Monk]]'s "[[Well You Needn't]]" and [[George Gershwin|Gershwin's]] "[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]".

The song as recorded by Cullum ("It Ain't Necessarily So") is also used in the film ''The Anatomy of Hate; A Dialogue to Hope'' by Mike Ramsdell.

=== ''Twentysomething'' ===
Recorded at London's [[Mayfair Studios]] and released in 2003, ''[[Twentysomething (album)|Twentysomething]]'' contains a mix of jazz standards, contemporary covers, and ballads. Due to the acoustic nature of the music, producer [[Stewart Levine]] chose to record and mix ''Twentysomething'' entirely on analogue tape.

The album includes jazz standards "[[What a Diff'rence a Day Made]]", "[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin' in the Rain]]", and [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[I Get a Kick out of You]]", modern takes on ''[[My Fair Lady]]''{{'s}} "[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]", [[Jeff Buckley]]'s "Lover, You Should Have Come Over", and [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "[[The Wind Cries Mary]]", as well as new tracks written by Cullum and his brother Ben, including the first single from the album ''All at Sea'' and the title track "Twentysomething".

=== ''The Pursuit'' ===
On 4 June 2009, Cullum announced the title of his fourth studio album, ''[[The Pursuit (album)|The Pursuit]]''. The album, which was released on 10 November 2009, was produced by [[Greg Wells]],<ref name="mtvasia.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200906/09018121.html |title=Jamie Cullum – New album, The Pursuit, is noisy, fearless and more rock 'n' roll! |first=Lennat |last=Mak |work=[[MTV Southeast Asia|MTV Asia]] |date=9 June 2009 |access-date=21 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724040356/http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200906/09018121.html |archive-date=24 July 2010 }}</ref> and the first single was "I'm All Over It", written with Deacon Blue frontman, [[Ricky Ross (musician)|Ricky Ross]]. The album was recorded at a Los Angeles studio, using songs that Cullum originally recorded at his [[Shepherd's Bush]] recording studio, Terrified Studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music-features/the-pursuit-of-happiness-1.930466|title=The pursuit of happiness|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|Herald Scotland]]|date=6 November 2009|access-date=21 June 2010}}</ref>

''The Pursuit'' was recorded in a variety of places: Cullum's kitchen, a studio in L.A. and Terrified Studios (his own in Shepherd's Bush). Various musicians were also used in the recording process. Songs recorded in L.A. mostly used session musicians and sees [[Greg Wells]] and Cullum play various instrument including drums and bass. "Don't Stop The Music", the second single from the album (released as a download only in January 2010)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herculesmoments.co.uk/2010/01/jamie-cullum-dont-stop-music.html|title=Jamie Cullum – Don't Stop the Music|work=herculesmoments.co.uk|access-date=21 June 2010}}</ref> was recorded with Chris Hill and Brad Webb.

From 2003 to 2008, Cullum played consistently with Geoff Gascoyne on bass, and Sebastiaan de Krom on drums. From 2003 until 2004 the trio was joined by [[Ben Castle]] on saxophone, John Hoare on trumpet, Barnaby Dickinson on trombone and Malcolm MacFarlane on guitar.
[[Sam Wedgwood]] (guitarist, bassist and trumpeter) later joined Cullum on tour, for a little over a year. At the end of 2005 Cullum was joined by Tom Richards (saxophonist, occasional guitarist and percussion). Soon after that Sam Wedgwood left to pursue his own solo musical career. At the beginning of 2006 Rory Simmons (trumpeter and guitarist) joined the band as a replacement, bringing the total number of band members (including Cullum himself) to five.

In late 2009 Cullum replaced Geoff Gascoyne (bass) and Sebastiaan de Krom (drums) with Chris Hill (bass) and Brad Webb (drums).

=== ''Momentum'' ===
Jamie Cullum's album ''Momentum'' was released on 20 May 2013.

In an interview with [[NBHAP]] Cullum told that "Momentum" is about the crossover period from being a young man while having one foot in the adult world, and about the balance of childish fantasies with grand and epic responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bonifer|first=Lisa|title=Interview: Jamie Cullum – "Hurl yourself into it without thinking"|url=http://nbhap.com/interviews/jamie-cullum/|publisher=NBHAP|access-date=22 June 2013}}</ref>

=== ''Interlude'' ===
''Interlude'' is an album consisting of jazz covers, released on 6 October 2014. Recorded with producer Benedic Lamdin of big band Nostalgia 77, and recorded in one take, the album was influenced by Cullum's BBC Radio 2 weekly jazz show. The duets on the album include two acts for which Cullum's radio show acted as a springboard for mainstream success: [[Laura Mvula]] featured on the track "Good Morning Heartache", and [[Gregory Porter]] on the lead single "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood".

Available in standard and deluxe versions, the latter including a DVD of Cullum's full performance at Jazz à Vienne, and an exclusive photo booklet containing tour and studio pictures.<ref>http://interlude.jamiecullum.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829015452/http://interlude.jamiecullum.com/ |date=29 August 2014 }}</ref>

Cullum's early music career saw him playing three or four times a week at PizzaExpress's restaurants throughout London, gaining exposure and later his big break with Universal. In 2011 the "[[PizzaExpress#Music|Pizza Express Big Audition with Jamie Cullum]]" competition gave singers, songwriters and musicians a platform and a chance to win a £5,000 prize and a residency at the restaurant chain's Dean Street Jazz Club. 7,500 acts entered the competition and the final, which was held at the Addison's Rooms in Kensington on 23 November, was judged by Cullum, Michael Parkinson, [[M People]]'s [[Heather Small]] and other music critics. The winning act was Offbeat South, an urban group of 18- to 21-year-olds from [[Croydon]].
