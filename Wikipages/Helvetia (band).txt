'''Helvetia''' is an American independent and experimental alternative music group from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. [[Jason Albertini]] started Helvetia after the dissolution of the band [[Duster (band)|Duster]] (in which he played drums). Helvetia's first record, ''The Clever North Wind'' (2006), was released on The Static Cult Label and distributed by Up Records. Their first national exposure was achieved by touring with [[Built To Spill]]. Helvetia is produced/performed by Jason Albertini and sustained by a rotating live line-up, which has included [[C. Dove Amber]], [[Jim Roth (musician)|Jim Roth]], [[Scott Plouf]], Zeke Howard, and Samantha Stidham. Their third release, ''Headless Machine of the Heart'' (2008) was recorded entirely on a 4-track tape machine. Helvetia continues to release music through The Static Cult Label (which is helmed by Duster-mate Clay Parton). In 2012 Helvetia released the album ''Nothing in Rambling'' on [[Joyful Noise Recordings]]. Helvetia released ''Dromomania'' on Joyful Noise Recordings on October 2, 2015.
