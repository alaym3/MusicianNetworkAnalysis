'''Lord Huron''' is an American [[indie rock]] band based in [[Los Angeles]]. The band was founded by guitarist and lead singer Ben Schneider and is composed of Mark Barry (drums, percussion), Miguel Briseño (bass, keyboard, theremin), and Tom Renaud (guitar).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lonesome-dreams-mw0002417140|title=Lonesome Dreams - Lord Huron - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref>  Following some solo and self-produced EPs, the group's debut album ''[[Lonesome Dreams]]'' was released in 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17158-lonesome-dreams/|title=Lord Huron: Lonesome Dreams Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com}}</ref> and their fourth and most recent album ''[[Long Lost (album)|Long Lost]]'' was released in May 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-05-24|title=Review: With 'Long Lost,' Lord Huron Taps Timeless Treasures and Still Reigns Supreme|url=https://americansongwriter.com/review-with-long-lost-lord-huron-taps-timeless-treasures-and-still-reigns-supreme/|access-date=2021-05-26|website=American Songwriter|language=en-US}}</ref>

Lord Huron combines [[Western music (North America)|western]], [[folk rock]], [[rock and roll]], [[Pop music|pop]] melodies, and the [[Surf music|surf rock]] genres with [[soundtrack]] and [[New-age music|new age]] influences to produce a novel sound described by ''The Wall Street Journal'' as having "a decidedly cinematic flair, heavy on mood and evocative imagery. Lord Huron brings to mind the high-lonesome sound of antecedents like [[the Band]], [[Neil Young]], [[My Morning Jacket]] and [[Fleet Foxes]]."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Richardson|first=Mark|date=2021-05-17|title='Long Lost' by Lord Huron Review: Finding an Escape|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/long-lost-by-lord-huron-review-finding-an-escape-11621275974|access-date=2021-05-26|issn=0099-9660}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation (2010–2011)===
Founding member Ben Schneider began writing music in his hometown of [[Lansing, Michigan]]. Schneider went on to study visual arts at the [[University of Michigan]] and finished his degree in [[France]], before moving to [[New York City]] where he worked for an artist.<ref name="mlive"/> In 2005, Schneider moved to [[Los Angeles]]. In 2010, Schneider formed Lord Huron as a solo project, recording his first few EPs entirely on his own and steadily adding members to help play in live shows.<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2012/10/06/lord-huron-folk-forges-pioneer-path/MQddVAwdJvhufHTbMmpwyN/story.html Lord Huron's folk forges a pioneer's path]. ''[[Boston Globe]]'', October 6, 2012.</ref> The band's name was inspired by [[Lake Huron]], the lake which Schneider grew up visiting;<ref name="mlive">{{cite web|last1=Jennings|first1=Zeke|url=http://www.mlive.com/lansing-entertainment/index.ssf/2012/12/a_qa_with_okemos_native_ben_sc.html |title=A Q&A with Okemos native Ben Schneider, whose band Lord Huron is on the rise |work=M LIVE |date=December 10, 2012}}</ref> he spent evenings at the lake playing music around the campfire.<ref name="mlive"/>

Lord Huron's first full-length album, ''Lonesome Dreams'', was released on October 9, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lonesome-dreams-mw0002417140 | title= Lord Huron: Lonesome Dreams |website=AllMusic }}</ref> It debuted at No. 5 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Heatseekers Albums chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/heatseekers-albums/2012-10-27|title = Heatseekers Albums Chart|magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

With the release of ''Lonesome Dreams'', the band also slowly released a series of music videos filmed in a western '70s style, which Schneider says was the focal point and narrative for the album. “We had this fun idea that ''Lonesome Dreams'' was kind of this series of old adventure tales.” In an interview, Schneider alluded to influence from a specific work, called ''[[The Collected Works of Billy the Kid: Left-Handed Poems]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/ben-schneider-lord-huron-lonesome-dreams|title = Lord Huron is at Home on the Range|date = October 4, 2012}}</ref> "It's sort of a collection of pulp fiction and we wanted the videos to kind of reflect that and have that same feel and style,” Schneider said during another interview. They also decided to release a theatrical version of the videos.<ref>{{cite web|title=CULTURE: A Conversation with Lord Huron (Ben Schneider)|url=http://grainaudio.com/blogs/news/12673461-a-conversation-with-lord-huron-ben-schneider|access-date=October 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906014143/https://grainaudio.com/blogs/news/12673461-a-conversation-with-lord-huron-ben-schneider|archive-date=September 6, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>
