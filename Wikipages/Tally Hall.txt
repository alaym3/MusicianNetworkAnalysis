'''Tally Hall''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in December 2002 and based in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. The band is known for upbeat melodies and whimsical lyrics. The members originally described their musical style as "wonky rock," later redefining their sound as "fabloo", in an effort to not let their music be defined by any particular genres after people began to start defining the characteristics of "wonky rock".<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/tally_hall/ MTV interview with Tally Hall], where Cantor described the band's dropping of the "wonky rock" genre in favor of a less-restrictive title.</ref>

Tally Hall has five members, each of them distinguished by the color of their [[necktie]]s: guitarist [[Rob Cantor]] (yellow), guitarist Joe Hawley (red), drummer Ross Federman (gray), keyboardist [[Andrew Horowitz]] (green), and bassist Zubin Sedghi (blue). Every member has provided vocals for the band.

Once under the [[Atlantic Records]] recording label, Tally Hall was, again, signed to indie label Quack!Media,<ref name="Good & Evil Release Date and Quack Switch">{{Cite web |title=Tally Hall announced the release date of Good & Evil under Quack |url=http://www.tallyhall.com/news.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421233859/http://www.tallyhall.com/news.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 21, 2010}}</ref> who previously helped finance and nationally distribute their debut studio album, ''[[Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum (album)|Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum]]''. They released their second album, ''[[Good & Evil (album)|Good & Evil]]'', on June 21, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Good & Evil by Tally Hall on Apple Music |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/good-evil/id435538541 |access-date=2020-04-11 |website=Itunes.apple.com}}</ref>

Tally Hall also provided the vocals and music for all of the songs in ''[[Happy Monster Band]]'', a [[children's television series]] that aired on [[Playhouse Disney]].

== History ==
===Early years===
Horowitz, the only member not originally from Michigan, began writing songs when he was eight years old, and attended the [[University of Michigan]], studying composition. There he met Cantor, who had both attended high school with Sedghi and joined Hawley's film production group. When Tally Hall's original drummer, Steve Gallagher, left the band in 2004, they recruited Federman, who had gone to high school with Hawley.

The name "Tally Hall" comes from the name of a shopping plaza on Orchard Lake Road in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]]. [[Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum (arcade)|Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum]], the arcade whose name shares the title of their debut album, remains there, though the shopping center has changed names. The album art for Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum is based on machines within the arcade.

In 2005, the band released their debut studio album, ''[[Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum (album)|Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum]]''. Violinist [[Jeremy Kittel]] contributed strings to the album.

The band has received national media attention, performing their song "Good Day" on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' on August 2, 2006, as well as appearing in MTV's segment ''[[You Hear It First]]'' in September 2006.<ref name="MTV.com">{{Cite web |date=March 9, 2006 |title=Article about Tally Hall, including video clip of band's segment that was featured on MTV |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/tally_hall/ |access-date=May 22, 2013 |website=Mtv.com}}</ref> The band appeared at the 2007 [[South by Southwest]] Music Festival. On August 3, 2008, Tally Hall was a performer on the BMI stage at [[Lollapalooza]].

Tally Hall was invited back by ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' on September 16, 2008, to help promote the launch of ''Tally Hall's Internet Show''. They performed "Welcome to Tally Hall" in newly donned black vests over top of their traditional colored ties, white shirts, and black pants.<ref name="LateLateShow2">{{Cite web |date=September 22, 2008 |title=Performance of "Welcome To Tally Hall" on The Late, Late Show (9/16/08) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2YAYZiBvvw |access-date=May 22, 2013 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

The band worked on several projects after the completion of ''Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum'', including covering the song "[[Smile Like You Mean It]]" by [[The Killers]] for the sixth ''[[The O.C.]]'' soundtrack: ''[[Music from the OC: Mix 6]]''.

The band re-released ''Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum'' on April 1, 2008, with their new record label, [[Atlantic Records]] after some re-recording and re-mixing.

===Tours and ''Good & Evil''===
On September 9, 2009, Hidden in the Sand (HITS), a prominent Tally Hall fansite, broke the news that Tally Hall was going to release a collaborative song, featuring [[Nellie McKay]], which would be released as a free download from mp3.walmart.com when customers of [[Walmart]] purchased a book called ''[[The Magician's Elephant]]'' by [[Kate DiCamillo]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 9, 2009 |title=Tally Hall's Collaborative New Song -- For A Book |url=https://www.hiddeninthesand.com/blogs/news/2009/09/tally-halls-collaborative-new-song-for-a-book/}}</ref> The book had been made available for purchase earlier that day. The same day, HITS reported the title of the song, "Light & Night", along with a short audio clip of it in another update.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Coz |date=2009-09-09 |title=New Song: Light and Night (Sample) |url=http://www.hiddeninthesand.com/blogs/2009/09/new-song-light-and-night-sample |access-date=2020-04-11 |website=Hiddeninthesand.com}}</ref>

In their 2010 March tour with [[Jukebox the Ghost]] and [[Skybox (band)|Skybox]], it was reported that Joe Hawley had unexpectedly backed out of the tour. Hawley was replaced with Casey Shea, who wore a black tie. On March 25, 2011, the band announced that all five original band members were still together.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Welcome To Tally Hall - News |url=http://www.tallyhall.com/news.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421233859/http://www.tallyhall.com/news.php |archive-date=2010-04-21 |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>

The band was managed by The Hornblow Group, who also manages [[They Might Be Giants]], [[OK Go]], and [[Oppenheimer (band)|Oppenheimer]], until 2010, when Tally Hall changed management to Stiletto Entertainment, who manages [[Barry Manilow]], in addition to several other solo performance acts.<ref name="HITSmgmtFormspring">{{Cite web |date=July 7, 2010 |title=Do we know when Tally Hall switched to Stiletto Entertainment?

With the release of ''[[Good & Evil (album)|Good & Evil]]'', Tally Hall returned to their original label, Quack!Media.<ref name="Good & Evil Release Date and Quack Switch" />

After the release of ''Good & Evil'', the band became inactive, and all of its members went on to more or less independent endeavors. {{As of|2021}}, the band has been on an indefinite hiatus.

===Beyond ''Good & Evil''===
Horowitz, under the moniker "edu", released a solo album called ''sketches'' in 2012. He also was involved in production and piano on [[John Legend]]'s ''[[Love in the Future]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 6, 2014 |title=Tally Hall's Andrew Horowitz plays piano (and more) on John Legend's new album &#124; MLive.com |url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/02/tally_halls_andrew_horowitz_pl.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306094133/http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/02/tally_halls_andrew_horowitz_pl.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-03-06 }}</ref>

Hawley returned to school, but released an album, ''Hawaii: Part II'', as part of his musical side project ミラクルミュージカル (Miracle Musical). He collaborated with Tally Hall members Sedghi, Federman, and Cantor on the album. Hawley later released ''Hawaii: Part II: Part ii'', a compilation of outtakes, demos, and instrumentals of the original album, as well as ''Hawaii Partii'', a collection of songs from the game ''Labyrinth'', based on the music video for the ''Hawaii: Part II'' song of the same name. The track titled ''Labyrinth'' (also commonly known as ''See How I Circle'') featured a collaboration with pop singer [[Charlene Kaye]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Labyrinth - Tally Hallmanac: The Ultimate Tally Hall Wiki |url=https://www.hiddeninthesand.com/wiki/index.php?title=Labyrinth |website=www.hiddeninthesand.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=kristinaxvasa's Review of 'Hawaii: Part II' by Miracle Musical |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/kristinaxvasa/album/124336-hawaii-part-ii/ |website=Album of The Year}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Write the World |url=https://writetheworld.com/groups/1/shared/133617/version/257192 |website=Write the World}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Labyrinth — Miracle Musical |url=https://www.last.fm/music/Miracle+Musical/_/Labyrinth |website=Last.fm}}</ref>

Federman has made occasional appearances as producer, percussionist, and [[Disc jockey|DJ]] with the pseudonym "Mr. F", although his main focus has been school. He graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 2013 with a Bachelor of Science in Cell and Molecular Biology,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ross Federman |url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossfederman/ |access-date=2020-11-30 |website=LinkedIn.com |language=en}}</ref> and graduated from [[Yale University]] with a Ph.D. in Immunology in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ross Federman on Instagram: "I'll take their word for it..." |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BxsiCuoBz-h/ |access-date=2019-05-27 |website=Instagram.com |language=en}}</ref> Federman is married.

As of 2020, Horowitz stated during his Instagram Livestream Keep Up the Good Work: <blockquote>So Zubin, correct me if I'm wrong, but he's on the frontline right now, working at a hospital. Well, last we heard, he was like, he was quarantined for, he couldn't... they thought he might be sick, so he was in quarantine for two weeks, then he went back to work in the hospital, and, as far as I know, he's working.<ref>{{Citation |title=Keep Up The Good Work Episode 1: Ross Federman |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R4l2u_qYjM |language=en |access-date=2020-06-16}}</ref></blockquote>

Cantor released his solo album, ''Not a Trampoline'', on April 14, 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-01 |title=NOT A TRAMPOLINE &#124; Rob Cantor |url=http://robcantormusic.bandcamp.com/album/not-a-trampoline |access-date=2020-04-11 |website=Robcantormusic.bandcamp.com}}</ref> In addition, he has made several [[viral video]]s on [[YouTube]], including "[[Shia LaBeouf (song)|SHIA LABEOUF]]" and "29 Celebrity Impressions, 1 Original Song - Rob Cantor". He also records songs for Disney Junior Musical Nursery Rhymes.

In 2015 Tally Hall's Bandcamp page was updated with a demo LP titled “Admittedly Incomplete Demos”, In reference to their earlier “Complete Demos”. This LP included demos for songs from Good & Evil as well as demos for unreleased songs, live performances, and studio versions of covers such as Just A Friend and The Minstrel Boy.

In mid-2016, Hawley announced a comedy hip-hop album ''Joe Hawley Joe Hawley'', which was released in October of that year. In 2019, Hawley's ''γɘlwɒH ɘoႱ γɘlwɒH ɘoႱ'', a reversed version of the album, was released. This was due to the large amounts of sampling he used, and to avoid copyright. Eventually, the album was released in its original state in 2020. It is assumed Joe Hawley gained clearance for the samples used on the album, as all songs but one are available on the official release.

In 2018, Horowitz released studio versions of piano compositions written in 2003 for the album ''etudes.''

In April 2019, Horowitz released studio versions of piano compositions written in 2005 while he was a student at Michigan university for the album etudes II.

In August 2019, the band released their archived cover of [[Biz Markie]]'s "[[Just a Friend]]", which was originally only found on their album "Admittedly Incomplete Demos".

In May 2020, Horowitz started a weekly Instagram Livestream series titled Keep Up The Good Work, where he has one or two guests on each stream. Some of these guests have included fellow members Federman<ref>{{Citation |title=Keep Up The Good Work Episode 1: Ross Federman |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R4l2u_qYjM |language=en |access-date=2020-06-28}}</ref> and Sedghi.<ref>{{Citation |title=Keep Up The Good Work Episode 6: Zubin Sedghi and Tyler James Bellinger |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DZUQn44EMU |language=en |access-date=2020-06-28}}</ref>

In January 2021, it was announced that Needlejuice Records would be reissuing their two studio albums on vinyl, CD, and cassette. The attempted midnight release of Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum on March 13 led to a lag spike on the website with fans attempting to purchase the album at release. Later, in June, it was released in a minidisc variant.

== Videos ==
In addition to music, the band has also created numerous movies. These movies include both music videos and humorous skits. The best known of these videos is the music video for "Banana Man", which resulted in significant publicity among online users visiting the website [[Albino Blacksheep]], along with "The Bidding", another popular title by the group.

Corresponding with their single "Good Day", released on February 26, 2008, the band released a music video for the song on [[YouTube]], which was previously on Tally Hall's Internet Show.

In August 2008, the band performed a three-song live video set for [[LiveDaily]] Sessions, including the songs "Good Day", "Be Born", and "Greener",<ref name="LiveDailySessions">{{Cite web |date=2008-08-29 |title=Tally Hall: Exclusive Video Performance At LiveDaily Sessions >> Exclusive Performance From LiveDaily Sessions >> LiveDaily |url=http://www.livedaily.com/sessions/29.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829194814/http://www.livedaily.com/sessions/29.html |archive-date=2008-08-29 |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> which premiered on August 28, 2008.

In July 2014, band member Rob Cantor released a video in which he seemed to perform his song "Perfect" by singing spot-on impressions of 29 celebrities. In the video, Cantor is accompanied by another band member, Andrew Horowitz, on piano and backing vocals. The video received more than 7,000,000 hits in 10 days. Shortly thereafter, Cantor revealed the video to be an elaborate hoax.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Singer Behind '29 Celebrity Voices' Hoax Explains Why He Did It |url=http://jezebel.com/singer-behind-29-celebrity-voices-hoax-explains-why-he-1602845053 |access-date=2020-04-11 |website=Jezebel.com}}</ref>

===''Tally Hall's Internet Show'' and music videos===
Taking on an even larger role within the band's video portfolio was the ten-part bi-weekly variety-show series ''Tally Hall's Internet Show'' (T.H.I.S.), which debuted on September 15, 2008. Each episode ran 10 minutes long and was posted on their website. The content primarily included comedy sketches and music videos.

Other music videos include "Dream", "Greener", "Hidden in the Sand", "Ruler of Everything", "Taken for a Ride", "The Whole World and You", "Two Wuv", and "Welcome to Tally Hall".
