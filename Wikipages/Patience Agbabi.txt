'''Patience Agbabi''' [[Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]] (born 1965) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[poet]] and [[performer]] who emphasizes the [[spoken word]].<ref name=BC>{{British council|id=patience-agbabi|name=Patience Agbabi}}.</ref> Although her poetry hits hard in addressing contemporary themes, it often makes use of formal constraints, including traditional poetic forms. She has described herself as "bicultural" and [[bisexual]].<ref name="vyoung">{{Cite web |title=Giving the Boys at Eton Poetry to Think About |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/05/arts/05poet.html?_r=1 |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |author=Victoria Young |date=5 March 2005 |accessdate=1 April 2008}}</ref> Issues of racial and [[sexual identity|gender]] identity feature in her poetry. She is celebrated "for paying equal homage to literature and performance" and for work that "moves fluidly and nimbly between cultures, dialects, voices; between page and stage."<ref>[https://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/patience-agbabi "Patience Agbabi"] at The Poetry Archive.</ref> In 2017 she was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]].<ref>[https://rsliterature.org/fellow/patience-agbabi/ "Patience Agbabi"] at The Royal Society of Literature.</ref>

==Early life and education==
Patience Agbabi was born in London to [[Nigerian]] parents,<ref name=BC /> and from a young age was privately fostered by a white English family, who when she was 12 years old moved from [[Sussex]] to [[North Wales]], where Agbabi was raised in [[Colwyn Bay]].<ref>[http://www.transculturalwriting.com/radiophonics/contents/writersonwriting/patienceagbabi/index.htmlb "Patience Agbabi |Crossing Borders: From Page to Stage and Back Again"], Writers on Writing, British Council.</ref> She studied English language and literature at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]].

She earned an MA in Creative Writing, the Arts and Education from the [[University of Sussex]] in 2002, and in September that year was appointed Associate Creative Writing Lecturer at the [[University of Wales]], [[Cardiff]].<ref>[http://www.literaryfestivals.co.uk/poets/patienceagbabi.html Patience Agbabi] at Literary Festivals UK.</ref>

==Poetry and performances==
Agbabi began performing on the London club circuit in 1995. She has cited among her influences [[Janis Joplin]], [[Carol Ann Duffy]], [[Chaucer]], and various aspects of contemporary music and culture. Agbabi's childhood love of cake is apparent in her poem "Eat Me".

The poems in her first book ''R.A.W.'', published in 1995, "owe much to the rhythms, verbal and associational genius of rap".<ref>George Stade, Karen Karbiener (eds), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T7pVTz46T3cC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=%22Patience+Agbabi&source=bl&ots=nhDk8c-GVY&sig=xFBJMsu87alv-eIreLddALS3NCI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2y_Pb1erfAhWhB9QKHVQgDXwQ6AEwBXoECC4QAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Patience%20Agbabi%22&f=false "Agbabi, Patience (1965– )"], ''Encyclopedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present, Volume 2'', Fact On File, 2009, p. 8.</ref> Her next collection was ''Transformatrix'' (2000), a commentary on contemporary Britain that draws inspiration from popular music forms. In 2008 Agbabi published ''Bloodshot Monochrome'', a collection that, as described by one reviewer, highlights social and political issues, captures and considers moments in time through long-dead authors, and offers readers a diverse sampling of the author's views of life in a variety of places".<ref>J. J. Furman, [https://womenwritinglondon.wordpress.com/2013/07/29/bloodshot-monochrome-4/ "Bloodshot Monochrome"], Women Writing London, 29 July 2013.</ref> [[Carol Rumens]] has said: "Agbabi characteristically makes poetry an opportunity for conversation with the past, not swamping it but setting new lexical terms."<ref>Carol Rumens, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/28/poem-of-the-week-skins-by-patience-agbabi "Poem of the week: Skins by Patience Agbabi"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 28 March 2016.</ref>

As [[Canterbury]] Laureate from July 2009 to December 2010, Agbabi received an [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]] grant to write a full-length poetry collection based on [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'',<ref>Patience Agbabi, [https://patienceagbabi.wordpress.com/about/ "About"], ''Telling Tales'' website.</ref> and her next book, 2014's ''Telling Tales'', mines the [[Middle English literature|Middle-English]] masterwork to offer a 21st-century take on the characters, its poetry and its performance elements.<ref>[https://poetrysociety.org.uk/poems/from-telling-tales-prologue-grime-mix/ "''from'' Telling Tales Prologue (Grime Mix)"], The Poetry Society, 2014.</ref> The book met with praise from poets including [[Simon Armitage]], who described it as "the liveliest versions of Chaucer you're likely to read."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.renaissanceone.co.uk/Patience-Agbabi-Telling-Tales-Book |title=Patience Agbabi: her new book Telling Tales |accessdate=23 March 2015 |website=renaissance one |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212142351/http://www.renaissanceone.co.uk/Patience-Agbabi-Telling-Tales-Book |archivedate=12 February 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Agbabi continues to tour ''Telling Tales'' as a performance-poetry production shown at literature festivals, arts spaces and libraries across the UK.

Agbabi has performed widely and worked with other writers. Her work has been influenced by [[rapping|rap]] rhythms and wordplay. She was a member of Atomic Lip, which has been called as "poetry's first pop group".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.applesandsnakes.org/page/84/performance+poets/191 |title=Performance poets {{!}} Apples and Snakes |date= |accessdate=23 March 2015 |website=[[Apples and Snakes]] |publisher= |last= |first= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152556/http://www.applesandsnakes.org/page/84/performance+poets/191 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> They worked together from 1995 to 1998; their last tour, Quadrophonix (1998), merged live and video performance.
