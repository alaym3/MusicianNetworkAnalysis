'''Jorge Duílio Lima Menezes''' (born March 22, 1939) is a [[Música popular brasileira|Brazilian popular musician]], performing under the stage name '''Jorge Ben Jor''' since the 1980s, though commonly known by his former stage name '''Jorge Ben''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈʒɔʁʒi ˈbẽj|lang}}). His characteristic style fuses [[samba]], [[funk]], rock and [[bossa nova]] with lyrics that blend humor and satire with often esoteric subject matter.<ref name="AM">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3213/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Jorge Ben > Biography )))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His hits include "Chove Chuva", "Mas Que Nada", "Ive Brussel" and "Balança Pema", and have been interpreted by artists such as [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Sérgio Mendes]], [[Miriam Makeba]], [[Soulfly]] and [[Marisa Monte]].

Ben's broad-minded and original approach to samba led him through participation in some of Brazilian popular music's most important musical movements, such as bossa nova, [[Jovem Guarda]], and [[Tropicália]], with the latter period defined by his albums ''[[Jorge Ben (album)|Jorge Ben]]'' (1969) and ''[[Fôrça Bruta]]'' (1970).<ref name="AM"/> He has been called "the father of [[samba rock]]", by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gomes |first=Tom |date=18 August 2001 |title=AmericaLatina... |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=37}}</ref> According to American music critic [[Robert Christgau]], Ben and his contemporary [[Gilberto Gil]] were "always ready to go further out on a beat than the other samba/bossa geniuses".<ref>{{cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Christgau |date=6 April 1993 |url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv393-93.php |title=Consumer Guide |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |access-date=12 August 2018}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born '''Jorge Duílio Lima Menezes''' in [[Rio de Janeiro]], he first took the stage name '''Jorge Ben''' after his mother's name (Sílvia Saint Ben Lima, Brazilian-born of Ethiopian origin)<ref name="Trip">{{cite news |language=pt |date=November 10, 2009 |title=O Homem Patropi |newspaper=[[Revista Trip]] |publisher=Trip Editora e Propaganda SA |volume=183 |pages=15 to 26 |issn=1414-350X |url=http://revistatrip.uol.com.br/revista/183/paginas-negras/o-homem-patropi.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=March 30, 2011|title=@enkuti that's true, I also have Ethiopian roots. Criola makes me think of her ... Salve!|url=https://twitter.com/jorgebenjor/status/53325278004518912|access-date=2021-03-02|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> but in the 1980s changed it to '''Jorge Ben Jor''' (commonly written Benjor).

Jorge Ben obtained his first [[pandeiro]] (Brazil's most popular type of tambourine) when he was thirteen, and two years later, was singing in a church choir. He also took part as a pandeiro player in the [[blocos]] of Carnaval, and from eighteen years of age, he began performing at parties and nightclubs with the guitar given to him by his mother. He was given the nickname "Babulina" after his enthusiastic pronunciation of [[rockabilly]] singer [[Ronnie Self]]'s song "Bop-A-Lena". Was introduced to [[Tim Maia]] by [[Erasmo Carlos]].<ref>[[Nelson Motta|Motta, Nelson]] (2001). Noites Tropicais (in Portuguese). Rio de Janeiro: Objetiva. {{ISBN|85-7302-292-2}}.</ref> It was in 1963 at one of those clubs in which he performed that Jorge's musical career took off; he came on stage and sang "[[Mas Que Nada]]" to a small crowd that happened to include an executive from the recording company, [[Philips]]. One week later, Jorge Ben's first single was released.

The hybrid rhythms that Jorge employed brought him some problems at the start of his career, when Brazilian music was split between the rockier sounds of the [[Jovem Guarda]] and traditional samba with its complex lyrics. However, as that phase in Brazilian pop music history passed and bossa nova became better known throughout the world, Ben rose to prominence.

Holdings both television programs O Fino da Bossa and Jovem Guarda from [[Rede Record]], after being reprimanded by the production of "O Fino da Bossa", chose to participate in the Jovem Guarda, soon after, joined the program Divino, Maravilhoso from [[TV Tupi]], presented by [[Caetano Veloso]] and [[Gilberto Gil]].<ref>Pedro Alexandre Sanches (November 10, 2009)[http://revistatrip.uol.com.br/revista/183/paginas-negras/o-homem-patropi.html O Homem Patropi] Revista Trip</ref>

Jorge Ben's first public appearances were in small festivals organised by his friends, where bossa nova and rock and roll predominated. As with most musicians of the time, Ben was initially influenced by [[João Gilberto]] even though he was quite innovative in his own right. The aforementioned song, "Mas Que Nada", was his first big hit in Brazil, and remains to this day the most played song in the United States sung entirely in Portuguese.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Outside of Brazil, the song is better known in cover versions by [[Sérgio Mendes]] and the [[Tamba Trio]]. The song has also been reinterpreted by prominent jazz artists including [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Al Jarreau]]; as well as other samba artists of the time, such as [[Elza Soares]].

His musical work has been vastly sampled by music producers and DJs, and covered by many bands in a variety of genres such as [[Heavy Metal Music|heavy metal]], [[disco]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[reggae]], [[jazz]], [[Drum and Bass|drum and bass]], [[House Music|house music]] and more.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Ben's 1963 debut album ''[[Samba Esquema Novo]]'' was met with great acclaim from fans, and encouraged Philips to capitalize on the success with immediate follow-up albums. The label pressured Ben to hastily record songs imitative of his debut, along with [[cover song]]s, resulting in the three albums within the span of 18 months and a strain on the singer's relationship with Philips. He left the label after his 1965 album ''[[Big Ben (album)|Big Ben]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Caz |first=Greg |date=15 December 2011 |url=http://www.revive-music.com/2011/12/15/brute-force-a-look-at-jorge-bens-recorded-work/ |title=Brute Force: A Look At Jorge Ben's Recorded Work |magazine=Revive |publisher=[[Okayplayer]] |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/72pugt85J?url=http://www.revive-music.com/2011/12/15/brute-force-a-look-at-jorge-bens-recorded-work/ |archive-date=October 1, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Success===
In 1969, Jorge Ben released his eponymous album amid the excitement of the cultural and musical [[Tropicália]] movement. The album featured [[Trio Mocotó]] as his backing band, who would go on to launch a successful career on the back of their association with Ben. The album was noted for "País Tropical", one of his most famous compositions, although it would be [[Wilson Simonal]] who would take his recording of the song to the top of the charts in Brazil that same year. Instead, the song "Charles, Anjo 45", also from the self-titled album, would become Ben's biggest self-performed chart hit of the year.

Jorge Ben released his most esoteric and experimental albums in the 1970s, most notably ''[[A Tábua de Esmeralda]]'' in 1974 and ''[[Solta o Pavão]]'' in 1975. The following year he released one of his most popular albums, ''[[África Brasil]]'', a fusion of funk and samba which relied more on the electric guitar than previous efforts. This album also features a remake of his previously released song "Taj Mahal." With its commercial success and sustained radio play, the melody made its way into the 1979 hit "[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]" by [[Rod Stewart]]. Ben sued for plagiarism and Stewart settled the lawsuit and donated the single’s royalties to UNICEF.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Number Ones: Rod Stewart's "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2070302/the-number-ones-rod-stewarts-da-ya-think-im-sexy/franchises/the-number-ones/|date=2020-01-20|website=Stereogum|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Time Rod Stewart Accidentally Stole A Jorge Ben Song|url=http://magazine.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/jorge-ben-taj-mahal-rod-stewart/|date=2019-06-25|website=Vinyl Me Please|language=en|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref> 

In 1989, Jorge changed his recording label as well as his artistic name, becoming Jorge Benjor (or Jorge Ben Jor). At the time, it was said that there were numerological reasons for his change in name; other sources say it was in response to an incident where some of his royalties accidentally went to American guitarist [[George Benson]].

===Recent career===
[[Image:Jorge Ben Jor at Live Earth.jpg|thumb|right|Jorge Ben at [[Live Earth]] in 2007]]
In 2002, Jorge Ben contributed to the critically acclaimed [[Red Hot + Riot]], a compilation CD created by the [[Red Hot Organization]] in tribute to the music and work of Nigerian musician [[Fela Kuti]], which raised money for various charities devoted to raising AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. He collaborated with fellow hip-hop artists [[Dead Prez]], [[Talib Kweli]], and [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]] to remake Fela Kuti's famous song "Shuffering and Shmiling" for the CD.

Ben was presented with the [[Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] by the [[Latin Recording Academy]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gallo |first1=Phil |title=Latin Grammys set fetes |url=https://variety.com/2005/music/markets-festivals/latin-grammys-set-fetes-1117931137/ |website=Variety |access-date=4 January 2019 |date=18 October 2005}}</ref> A year later, a remake of Ben's "Mas Que Nada" became an international chart hit for [[Sérgio Mendes]] with [[The Black Eyed Peas]] after being used by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in a global TV advertisement during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]; this remake (the second time Mendes had covered the track) reached the Top 10 in several European countries, including the UK and Germany, in addition to reaching Number 1 in the Netherlands.

Jorge Ben is also a big fan of [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], a Brazilian football club, located in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which counts [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]], [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama Júnior|Junior]] and [[José Leandro Ferreira|Leandro]] among their former star players. Ben's interest in football carries over to his music, as many of his songs deal with the subject, such as "Flamengo", "Camisa 10 da Gávea", "Ponta De Lança Africano (Umbabarauma)", "Zagueiro", "[[Fio Maravilha]]", and "A Loba Comeu o Canário".

On July 7, 2007, he performed at the [[Live Earth concert, Rio de Janeiro|Brazilian leg]] of [[Live Earth]] in Rio de Janeiro.
