A '''wildflower''' (or '''wild flower''') is a [[flower]] that grows in the wild, meaning it was not intentionally seeded or planted. The term implies that the plant probably is neither a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] nor a selected [[cultivar]] that is in any way different from the way it appears in the wild as a [[native plant]], even if it is growing where it would not naturally. The term can refer to the flowering plant as a whole, even when not in bloom, and not just the flower.<ref>Wild flowers can be found in deserts, forests,
meadows, and fields.

"Wildflower" is not an exact term. More precise terms include ''native species'' (naturally occurring in the area, see [[Flora (plants)|flora]]), ''exotic'' or, better, ''[[introduced species]]'' (not naturally occurring in the area), of which some are labelled ''[[invasive species]]'' (that out-compete other plants – whether native or not), ''imported'' (introduced to an area whether deliberately or accidentally) and ''naturalized'' (introduced to an area, but now considered by the public as native).

In the United Kingdom, the organization [[Plantlife International]] instituted the "County Flowers scheme" in 2002, see [[County flowers of the United Kingdom]] for which members of the public nominated and voted for a wildflower emblem for their [[county]]. The aim was to spread awareness of the heritage of native species and about the need for conservation, as some of these species are endangered. For example, [[Somerset]] has adopted the [[Cheddar Pink]] (''[[Dianthus]] gratianopolitanus''), [[London]] the [[Rosebay Willowherb]] (''Chamerion angustifolium'') and [[Denbighshire]]/Sir Ddinbych in [[Wales]] the rare Limestone Woundwort (''[[Stachys]] Alpina'').
