==Background==

Puscifer's original name was '''Umlaut''', "a premiere improvisational hardcore band".<ref name="SG" /> The name "Puscifer" was first publicized as a fictional band in the first episode of ''[[Mr. Show]]'', including Keenan and [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] as members. Jones is not associated with Puscifer otherwise, although artwork by Jones has been featured on Puscifer apparel (the "Your Mom's a Bitch" shirt, specifically). Keenan describes Puscifer as "simply a playground for the various voices in my head, [...] a space with no clear or discernible goals, [...] where my [[Id, ego, and super-ego|Id, Ego]], and [[Anima (Jung)|Anima]] all come together to exchange cookie recipes."<ref>The last two quotations are also shown in the introduction at [http://www.puscifer.com Puscifer.com]. Retrieved on March 2, 2007.</ref> Keenan also worked on [[short film]]s with Ford Englerth and Jeffrey Brooks from Red Rock Entertainment Development; these shorts were done in a similar manner to that of ''Mr. Show'' and [[Tom Waits]]' ''[[Big Time (Tom Waits album)|Big Time]]''.<ref name="SG"/>

Puscifer is "as much a clothing line as it is a band", with the clothing items produced in limited numbers. Keenan collaborated on a [[leather jacket]] with [[Paul Frank]].<ref name="SG">{{cite web
