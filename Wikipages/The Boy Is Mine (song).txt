"'''The Boy Is Mine'''" is a 1998 [[duet]] by American singers [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] and [[Monica (singer)|Monica]]. It was written by [[LaShawn Daniels]], Japhe Tejeda, [[Fred Jerkins III]], [[Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]], and Brandy, while production was helmed by Jerkins, Brandy, and [[Dallas Austin]]. It was released as the [[lead single]] from both singers' second albums from 1998, ''[[Never Say Never (Brandy album)|Never Say Never]]'' by Brandy and ''[[The Boy Is Mine (album)|The Boy Is Mine]]'' by Monica. Inspired by [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Paul McCartney]]'s 1982 duet "[[The Girl Is Mine]]", the lyrics of the [[mid-tempo]] [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] track revolve around two women fighting over a man.<ref name=HeraldS>{{cite web|title=We Assess The Best, and Worst, All-Time Musical Duets |last=Adams |first=Cameron |date=June 19, 2008 |work=Herald Sun |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23888090-2902,00.html |access-date=December 15, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622151152/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C23888090-2902%2C00.html |archive-date=June 22, 2008 }}</ref>

The song received generally positive reviews from music critics and was the first [[Number one hit|number-one pop hit]] for both artists, in the US and internationally.

It became the second song in the history of the chart to ascend directly to number-one from a previous position beneath the Top 20, at number 23, following [[The Beatles]] and the 27–1 leap of their single "[[Can't Buy Me Love]]" in April 1964. Internationally, the single also achieved a strong charting, peaking at number one in [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[New Zealand]], while reaching the top five on most of the other charts on which it appeared.<ref name="sixty-one"/>

The accompanying music video, directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], starred the singers and [[Mekhi Phifer]]. It was nominated for two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video|Best R&B Video]].

In 2008, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' listed it 54th on its 50th Anniversary All-Time Hot 100 Top Songs chart, and 18th on the All-Time Top R&B/Hip-Hop Songs countdown.<ref name="SweetSoulMusic">{{cite web|title=Sweet Soul Music: Top Billboard Hot 100 R&B/Hip-Hop Songs |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Billboard.com |url=https://www.billboard.com/specials/hot100/charts/top-rbhiphop.shtml |access-date=February 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131040254/http://www.billboard.com/specials/hot100/charts/top-rbhiphop.shtml |archive-date=January 31, 2012 }}</ref> In 2012, the singers reunited on the single "[[It All Belongs to Me]]".

"The Boy Is Mine" was a song Brandy wrote with [[Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]], his brother [[Fred Jerkins III]], Japhe Tejeda, and [[LaShawn Daniels]]. The singer came up with its concept while watching an episode of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' [[tabloid talk show]], where [[love triangle]]s among the guests was the theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-01-12/news/9901110643_1_abc-entertainment-tim-allen-jerry-springer-show|title=Everybody Know What Time It Is?

Originally, the two artists recorded their vocals for the song together with Jerkins and his production team at the [[Record One Studios]] in Los Angeles. However, the joint recording was felt to be a failure so Monica re-recorded her vocals separately at the DARP Studios in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] with longtime contributor [[Dallas Austin]] and turned the song into a more mature pop sound.<ref name="la1"/> (Thus, Austin would later share the main production credit alongside Jerkins.<ref name="liner notes"/>) Though both Brandy and Monica repeatedly denied the song reflected any actual rivalry between them, tabloids began writing the opposite. There were claims that Monica was upset when Brandy performed the song solo on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', and Brandy was reportedly miffed when Monica opted to take the name of the duet for the title of her [[The Boy Is Mine (album)|second album]]. Following reports that the pair came to blows during a rehearsal for a performance at the [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]] in September 1998, talk of the rivalry became so loud that the singers' managers released a joint statement in which they called the press out for its "disturbing behavior" and called the "ongoing negativity [as] totally unfair."<ref name="yahoo1">{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/monica/news/brandy-and-monica-held-hands-and-prayed-together--12032969 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209221059/http://music.yahoo.com/monica/news/brandy-and-monica-held-hands-and-prayed-together--12032969 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |title=Brandy And Monica 'Held Hands And Prayed Together' |work=[[Yahoo!

<blockquote>
"We were young. We could barely stay in the room with each other. By no means was it jealousy or envy.

The song has garnered positive reviews from music critics.

He added, "Joined by fellow jeep ingénue Monica, TV's ''"[[Moesha]]"'' reveals a markedly matured style and a far more flexible range. Meanwhile, Monica whets appetites for her own forthcoming disc with a deliciously diva-driven performance that is rife with subtext." He complimented the producers for dressing the singers in "plush synths and quietly insinuating beats that will have seasoned listeners reminiscing about the heyday of [[Barry White]] and the [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]]. This isn't the obviously poppy or immediately infectious single one might have expected as the preview to Brandy's new disc, but after a second spin, you won't be able to shake the subtle [[hook (music)|hook]] from your brain."<ref>{{cite web|author= Flick, Larry|author-link= Larry Flick|title= Reviews & Previews: Singles |url= https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1998/BB-1998-05-09.pdf |work= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= May 9, 1998 |page= 31 |access-date= December 6, 2020}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s [[J.D.

=== Synopsis ===
[[File:The Boy Is Mine screenshot.jpg|thumb|Brandy and Monica in the video for in "The Boy Is Mine".]]
The video begins with Brandy watching an episode of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]].'' Next we see Monica who, using her remote, accidentally turns Brandy's TV along with her own to watch an old romantic movie. Confused, Brandy changes her channel back. Much to their dismay, whenever one of them turns the channel, the other's TV is also turned. They begin singing. The next scene shows the two discussing their problem among their separate groups of friends. The titular boy himself (played by [[Mekhi Phifer]]) then appears outside adjacent apartments, 6 & 7, where we later discover the two girls live; all their friends walk by him as they exit their respective friend's place. The girls are seen next arguing through their adjoining bedroom wall, until the boy phones them one after the other. They each overhear the other's conversation through the wall, realizing that they've both been played. They proceed to gather up all gifts and memorabilia related to the boy and toss them out the door. After Brandy and Monica sing more through the song's lyrics, the boy knocks on Brandy's door. The door opens showing Brandy for a brief moment before she opens the door wider to reveal Monica beside her. Noticing that he had been caught, the boy is taken aback, and the door is slammed in his face before he even gets a chance to talk to them, ending the video.

== Live performances ==
Brandy first performed the song by herself on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Following that, she and Monica first performed it together at the [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]] in [[Los Angeles]] at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] on September 10, 1998,<ref name="jet10051998">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzsDAAAAMBAJ&q=%22the+boy+is+mine%22+brandy&pg=PA39|title=Brandy And Monica's Managers Deny Alleged Fight Backstage At MTV's VIdeo Music Awards|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=October 5, 1998|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|access-date=May 31, 2011}}</ref> an event which remains, to date, Brandy and Monica's only television broadcast performance of the song. The pair came together a second time on December 16, 2008, for a surprise performance at [[Atlanta]]’s ''V103 Soul Session'', singing it [[a cappella]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2008/12/18/brandy-and-monica-reunite-on-stage/#more-9986|title=Brandy and Monica Reunite On Stage|work=[[Rap-Up]]|publisher=Rap-Up.com|date=December 18, 2008|access-date=February 25, 2012}}</ref>

*In 1998, [[UK garage]] group [[Architechs]] remixed "The Boy Is Mine", and released it as a [[white label]] bootleg which eventually sold 20,000 copies. This remix became highly popular due to incessant airplay on pirate radio.<ref>{{cite web|author=Simon Reynolds |url=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/simon-reynolds-ukg-rb |title=Simon Reynolds's Video Countdown: UKG x R&B |publisher=Red Bull Music Academy |access-date=January 16, 2014}}</ref>
*In 2001, Brandy and Monica's vocals were merged with [[Modjo]]'s 2000 dance hit single "[[Lady (Hear Me Tonight)]]" by British DJs [[Stuntmasterz]]. Starting as an underground hit, "The Ladyboy Is Mine" was later commercially released to become a moderate hit across Europe, reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom, Belgium and the top forty in France and Switzerland. The commercial release didn't include the vocal sample from Modjo's "Lady" as Warner Brothers label East West were unable to clear it. Instead the release used the same sample from [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s "[[Soup for One (song)|Soup for One]]" and created an alternate version that only featured Brandy and Monica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Stuntmasterz&titel=The+Lady+Boy+Is+Mine&cat=s|title=Stuntmasterz– The Lady Boy Is Mine swisscharts.com|publisher=[[Swiss Singles Chart]].

*The song was covered in 2010 by [[Amber Riley]] and [[Naya Rivera]] for the TV show ''Glee'' as their respective characters. Their version hit number 76 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/music/glee-cast/chart-history/HSI/7</ref>
*In 2018, [[Postmodern Jukebox]] released a 1940s vintage cover of the song, starring the sisters Emily and Juliette Goglia. The YouTube video has received 1.6 million views as of December 21, 2020.<ref>Postmodern Jukebox, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xUNTYfDOJ8&list=PLPGJsuA0IAkl31Tv6n5yeQods7z-zncMp&index=4&t=0s The Boy Is Mine - Brandy & Monica (Vintage '40s Cover) ft. Emily & Juliette Goglia], Retrieved December 21, 2020.</ref>
*On the October 14, 2019, episode of reality television singing competition show ''[[The Voice (American season 17)|The Voice]]'', Team [[John Legend|(John) Legend]] members Khalea Lynee of [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], and Zoe Upkins of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], performed the song in a Battle round. Coaches [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Gwen Stefani]], and [[Blake Shelton]] were all divided, with Stefani preferring Upkins's performance, Shelton preferring Lynee's performance, and Clarkson abstaining from naming her preference. Legend chose to agree with Shelton and named Lynee the winner of the Battle, advancing her to the Knockout rounds. Soon after, Legend also attempted to save Upkins and keep her on his team, as well, although Clarkson and Stefani both attempted to steal her instead, with the three coaches' attempts saving her from elimination regardless of her choice. Ultimately, Upkins opted to remain on Team Legend, advancing to the Knockouts on his team.
