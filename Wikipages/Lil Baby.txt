==Early life==
Dominique Jones was born in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]] in the Oakland City neighborhood.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Clark |first1=Mitchell |title=Weekly Columns:Lil Baby joins the newest wave of Atlanta-based hip-hop |url=http://dailycampus.com/stories/2018/9/7/weekly-columnslil-baby-joins-the-newest-wave-of-atlanta-based-hip-hop |access-date=October 18, 2018 |publisher=The Daily Campus |date=September 7, 2018 |archive-date=October 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019001448/http://dailycampus.com/stories/2018/9/7/weekly-columnslil-baby-joins-the-newest-wave-of-atlanta-based-hip-hop |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was two years old when his father left the family, leaving his single mother to raise him and his two sisters. While he was not struggling academically, Jones would repeatedly get in trouble, resulting in him dropping out of [[Booker T. Washington High School (Georgia)|Booker T. Washington High School]] in the ninth grade.

In early 2012, he was charged for possession with intent to sell among other charges. His original lawyer urged him to take a two-year plea deal, but Jones refused, and acquired a new lawyer. This new lawyer placed Jones in a special program that would only hold him for a year.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Lil Baby on Going to Prison at 18, Fighting a White Racist (Part 1)|date=September 9, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ckj0ixgZE8&ab_channel=95G|access-date=September 18, 2018|archive-date=September 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918011942/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrFiHXJJGkg&gl=US&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> While in this program, he got into an altercation with a white prisoner over racial comments. After, Jones' sentencing was replaced with the original 2-year deal. Later in 2013, he had a charge of possession of marijuana for less than an ounce. In 2014, he was arrested again and charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell among other things. After being incarcerated for two years, he began his rap career with 4PF (4 Pockets Full) and Quality Control Music.<ref name="Lil Baby Harder Than Ever Review"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://georgia.arrests.org/search.php?page=2&results=14&fname=dominique&lname=jones&fpartial=True |title=Most recent Georgia Bookings |website=Georgia.arrests.org |date=June 16, 2018 |access-date=June 16, 2018 |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015401/https://georgia.arrests.org/search.php?page=2&results=14&fname=dominique&lname=jones&fpartial=True |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Career==
===2015–2018: Career beginnings and ''Harder Than Ever''===

On October 9, 2017, Jones released a collaboration mixtape with close friend and fellow Atlanta rapper [[Marlo (rapper)|Marlo]], ''2 The Hard Way''. This mixtape did not create as big an impact as the two former tapes, but still garnered some attention.
