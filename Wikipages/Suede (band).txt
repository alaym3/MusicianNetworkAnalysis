'''Suede''' (known in the United States as '''The London Suede''') are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1989. The band is composed of singer [[Brett Anderson]], guitarist [[Richard Oakes (guitarist)|Richard Oakes]], bass player [[Mat Osman]], drummer [[Simon Gilbert (musician)|Simon Gilbert]] and keyboardist/rhythm guitarist [[Neil Codling]].

In 1992, Suede were dubbed "The Best New Band in Britain" by ''[[Melody Maker]]'',<ref name="jam.canoe"/> and attracted much attention from the British music press. The following year their debut album ''[[Suede (album)|Suede]]'' went to the top of the [[UK Albums Chart]], becoming the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years. It won the [[Mercury Prize|Mercury Music Prize]] and helped foster '[[Britpop]]' as a musical movement, though the band distanced themselves from the term. The recording sessions for their second album, ''[[Dog Man Star]]'', were fraught with difficulty and ended with original guitarist [[Bernard Butler]] departing after confrontations with the other members. The album was completed without Butler, and the band toured the record with replacement Richard Oakes. Although a commercial disappointment at the time, the album was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has over time been lauded as one of rock music's great albums.<ref name="Boyd"/> In 1994, Suede would become a component of the Britpop "big four", along with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/25/suede-review|title=Suede – review|last=Hann|first=Michael|date=25 August 2013|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=4 May 2016|archive-date=16 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616030207/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/25/suede-review|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1996, following the recruitment of keyboard player Neil Codling, Suede went on to greater commercial success with ''[[Coming Up (album)|Coming Up]]''. The album reached number one in the UK, producing five top ten singles and becoming Suede's biggest-selling album worldwide. Despite problems within the band, Suede's fourth album, ''[[Head Music]]'' (1999), was a British chart-topper. The album was promoted heavily with the band receiving considerable press coverage on its release, however the response from fans and critics was less enthusiastic than for previous records. Codling left the band in 2001, citing [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and was replaced by Alex Lee. The band's fifth album, ''[[A New Morning]]'' (2002), the first following the collapse of [[Nude Records]], was a commercial disappointment, and the band disbanded the following year. After much speculation Suede reformed in 2010 for a series of concerts. Three years on from their reunion gigs, Suede released their sixth album, ''[[Bloodsports (album)|Bloodsports]]''. It was well received by critics and returned the band to the top ten in the UK. Their seventh album, ''[[Night Thoughts (album)|Night Thoughts]]'', followed in 2016 and became an even bigger critical and commercial success than its predecessor. Their eighth studio album, ''[[The Blue Hour (album)|The Blue Hour]]'', was released in September 2018. It became the group's first top five record since ''Head Music''.

==History==

===1989–1991: Formation and early years ===
[[File:JFrischmannGuitar.tiff|left|thumb|220px|The lead singer of [[Elastica]], [[Justine Frischmann]], was part of Suede's initial incarnation.]]
[[Brett Anderson]] and [[Justine Frischmann]] met in 1988 while studying at [[University College London]] and became a couple soon afterwards.<ref>Harris, p. 28-30</ref> Together with Anderson's childhood friend [[Mat Osman]], they decided they had the core of a band, and spent hours a day playing songs by [[Roxy Music]], [[The Smiths]], [[David Bowie]] and [[The Cure]].<ref name="Harris, p. 32">Harris, p. 32</ref> After deciding that neither Anderson nor Frischmann had the skill to be a lead guitarist, the band placed an advert in ''[[NME]]''<ref name="Harris, p. 32"/> in the magazine's 28 October 1989 issue seeking to fill the position: "Young guitar player needed by London based band. Smiths, [[Lloyd Cole and the Commotions|Commotions]], Bowie, [[Pet Shop Boys]]. No Musos. Some things are more important than ability. Call Brett." The advert attracted the interest of nineteen-year-old [[Bernard Butler]], who soon auditioned to join the band.<ref>Barnett, p. 32</ref> The band settled on the name Suede. Lacking a drummer, the band initially used a [[drum machine]].<ref>Harris, p. 34-35</ref> Despite Frischmann's efforts as the band's ''de facto'' manager, the band primarily played small-scale gigs around [[Camden Town]] in London.<ref>Harris, p. 35</ref>

Suede's first breakthrough came with their second demo ''Specially Suede'' which they sent to compete in ''Demo Clash'', a radio show on [[Greater London Radio]] run by the DJ [[Gary Crowley]]. "Wonderful Sometimes" won ''Demo Clash'' for five Sundays in a row during 1990, leading to a recording contract with the Brighton-based indie label RML.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/suede-mn0000586694/biography|title=Suede Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|access-date=28 July 2013|archive-date=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015064723/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/suede-mn0000586694/biography|url-status=live}}</ref> The song appeared on a cassette compilation in April 1990 representing Suede's first official release.<ref>Barnett, p. 37</ref> After a series of gigs with an unreliable drum machine, Suede decided to recruit a full-time drummer. [[Justin Welch]] briefly fulfilled the role, though he only lasted six weeks before joining the [[Crawley]] band [[Spitfire (UK band)|Spitfire]].<ref>Harris, p. 36</ref> He did, though, stay long enough to record two songs with the band, which were set to be released as the "Be My God"/"Art" single on RML Records. The band was dissatisfied with the result, and most of the 500 copies pressed were destroyed.<ref>Harris, p. 36-37</ref> Suede placed another advert seeking a replacement. To the band's surprise, it was answered by the Smiths’ former drummer, [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]]. He ultimately turned down the job as he felt Suede still had to forge their own identity. He felt that by being in a band that had similarities to the Smiths, he would have done them more harm than good.<ref>Barnett, p. 45</ref> In June 1990, Suede found a permanent drummer, [[Simon Gilbert (musician)|Simon Gilbert]], through [[Ricky Gervais]], who would later become a household name for co-writing and starring in the TV series ''[[The Office (British TV series)|The Office]]''. Both worked at the [[University of London Union]] (ULU). After hearing the demo and realising the band did not have a drummer, Gilbert asked to audition.<ref>Barnett, p. 50-51</ref>

By spring 1991, Anderson and Frischmann had broken up. Frischmann started dating [[Blur (band)|Blur]] frontman [[Damon Albarn]]. She believed the band could accommodate the new situation.<ref>Harris, p. 61</ref> The situation grew tense, Butler recalled: "She'd turn up late for rehearsals and say the worst thing in the world – 'I've been on a Blur video shoot.' That was when it ended, really. I think it was the day after she said that that Brett phoned me up and said, 'I've kicked her out.'" After Frischmann's departure the character of the group changed. "If Justine hadn't left the band," Anderson said, "I don't think we'd have got anywhere. It was a combination of being personally motivated, and the chemistry being right once she'd left." Anderson and Butler became close friends and began writing several new songs together.<ref>Harris, p. 62</ref> Still, the band's music was out of step with the music of its London contemporaries as well as the American [[grunge]] bands. Anderson said, "For the whole of 1991, A&R men wouldn't give us a second look."<ref>Harris, p. 63</ref>

Through the end of 1991 and early 1992, Suede received a number of favourable mentions in the music press, receiving slots at shows hosted by ''NME'' and attended by significant musical figures such as the former Smiths singer, [[Morrissey]]. A gig at the ULU in October 1991, which caught the media's attention, was Frischmann's final gig.<ref>Barnett, p. 63-64</ref> John Mulvey of the ''NME'', the journalist who first wrote about Suede was there. He said, "They had charm, aggression, and... if not exactly eroticism, then something a little bit dangerous and exciting."<ref name="Independent1">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/now-you-see-them-its-been-a-long-time-since-there-was-a-pop-phenomenon-like-this-frenzied-fans-rhapsodising-reviews----suede-it-seems-might-be-the-future-of-rock-and-roll-then-again-they-might-not-1499016.html|title=Now you see them...|last=Leith|first=William|work=[[The Independent]]|date=21 March 1993|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=4 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104070324/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/now-you-see-them-its-been-a-long-time-since-there-was-a-pop-phenomenon-like-this-frenzied-fans-rhapsodising-reviews----suede-it-seems-might-be-the-future-of-rock-and-roll-then-again-they-might-not-1499016.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===1992–1993: Signing and early success ===
After seeing the band perform at an ''NME'' show in January 1992, Saul Galpern approached them about signing to his independent record label [[Nude Records]]. Suede eventually signed a two single deal to Nude in February 1992 for the sum of £3,132.<ref>Barnett, p. 74</ref> Following Nude's offer, Suede attracted further interest from [[Island Records]] and [[East West Records]], who were keen to sign the band long term.<ref>Barnett, p. 74-75</ref> Suede were being hailed as "the next big thing"<ref name="jam.canoe"/> and, before the release of the band's first single, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' featured the band on the cover on 25 April, with the headline "Suede: The Best New Band in Britain".<ref name="jam.canoe">{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/S/Suede/1993/04/21/750115.html|title=Suede: The next big thing?|last=Davidson|first=Neil|work=[[Canoe.ca]]|date=21 April 1993|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722173839/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/S/Suede/1993/04/21/750115.html|archive-date=22 July 2012 }}</ref> The band's first single, "[[The Drowners]]", attracted attention for its sharp contrast to the dying [[Madchester]] scene and the US grunge sound of the time.<ref name="BBC" /> A moderate hit, "The Drowners" reached number 49 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in May.<ref name="uk_charts">Roberts, David, ed. (2006), ''[[Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums|British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' (19th ed.), [[HIT Entertainment]], {{ISBN|1-904994-10-5}}</ref> The band was then approached by [[Geffen Records]] and, although the Geffen deal was very attractive (Galpern described it as "insane"), the band still had other offers to consider.<ref>Barnett, p. 89</ref> In September 1992, Suede released a second single, "[[Metal Mickey (song)|Metal Mickey]]", which reached number 17 in the charts. It was the only Suede single to enter the US Modern Rock top 10, peaking at number 7.<ref>"[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=suede|chart=all}} Billboard Chart History"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved on 1 January 2010.</ref> Shortly after the release of "Metal Mickey", Suede signed to Nude/Sony. Galpern was determined to sign the band in the long term and struck a deal with Sony – making them a tiny independent label with major company backing.<ref>Barnett, p. 96</ref> The contract gave Suede creative controls such as the artwork on their releases.<ref name="Herald"/>

Anderson soon became notorious for causing controversy, such as his infamous quote that resurfaced in interviews and articles in the following years, that he was "a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience".<ref name="AMG" /> In February 1993, Suede went from highly touted indie band to major chart contenders with their third single, "[[Animal Nitrate]]", which went into the UK top ten.<ref name="Herald"/> The single earned them a last-minute invitation to play at that year's [[Brit Awards]] ceremony.<ref name="Herald">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/true-suede-blues-1.768998|title=True Suede Blues|last=Middleton|first=Fraser|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=10 March 1993|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=11 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111143633/http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/true-suede-blues-1.768998|url-status=live}}</ref> Writing in 2005, ''[[The Times]]''' Victoria Segal looked back to the band's early career, saying Suede's "sexually fluid lyrics made them a rallying point for the alienated, one of the few British bands since the Smiths who united as much as they divided."<ref name="Times"/> Comparisons were being made with David Bowie, though Suede sounded nothing quite like anybody else around at the time, and soon they fell upon what critics quickly deemed was a new movement.<ref name="Independent2">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/brett-anderson-i-was-a-very-strange-human-being-indeed-583336.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401160304/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/brett-anderson-i-was-a-very-strange-human-being-indeed-583336.html|archive-date=1 April 2009|title=Brett Anderson: 'I was a very strange human being indeed'|last=Duerden|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=18 October 2003|url-status=dead|access-date=29 May 2013}}</ref> Anderson recalls, "I had always been fascinated by suburbia, and I liked to throw these twisted references to small-town British life into songs.

Before Suede had released an album, they dominated the music press on the strength of just three singles, setting high expectations for the forthcoming album.<ref name="Independent1"/><ref name="Herald"/> ''[[Suede (album)|Suede]]'' entered the British charts at number one, registering the biggest initial sales of a debut album since [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]'s ''[[Welcome to the Pleasuredome]]'' a decade before.<ref name="AMG" /> It sold over 100,000 copies in its first week of release,<ref>Harris, p. 86</ref> going gold on its second day.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4703775/Taking-the-rough-with-the-smooth.html|title=Taking the rough with the smooth|last=McCormick|first=Neil|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=31 August 1996|author-link=Neil McCormick|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181009211243/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4703775/Taking-the-rough-with-the-smooth.html|archive-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> At the time it was hailed as "the most eagerly awaited debut since ''[[Never Mind The Bollocks]]'' by the [[Sex Pistols]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=437&dat=19970311&id=faZNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6294,4046980|title=Born to be Cool|newspaper=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]|via=[[Google News Archive]]|last=Phrommayon|first=Annie|date=11 March 1997|access-date=2 July 2013|archive-date=27 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027162802/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=437&dat=19970311&id=faZNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6294%2C4046980|url-status=live}}</ref> Some notable press at the time was the front cover of the April 1993 issue of ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', which is seen by many as the start of Britpop.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4144458.stm|title=Looking back at the birth of Britpop|last=Youngs|first=Ian|work=[[BBC News]]|date=15 August 2005|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=12 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912024853/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4144458.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> The album won the 1993 [[Mercury Prize]].<ref name="Telegraph"/> The band donated the entire £25,000 in prize money to [[Cancer Research]].<ref>Barnett, p. 127</ref> This was the only album released in the US under the name "Suede", where it remains the band's highest selling release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043961/ask-billboard|title=Ask Billboard: Blue Suede Shoes|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|work=Billboard|date=26 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327201445/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043961/ask-billboard|archive-date=27 March 2013}}</ref>

Following the success of the album, the band toured extensively in Europe, receiving major coverage by MTV. In July, Suede gave a benefit concert for [[Red Hot Organization]] at "The Grand" in London, inviting [[Siouxsie Sioux]] to perform a version of Lou Reed's "Carolyne Says" with Butler.<ref>Craven, Art. "Suede The Grand London 12 July 1993". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. October 1993.</ref> Suede then prepared for an American tour in summer 1993. During the tour, tensions began to develop between Butler and the rest of the band.<ref name="AMG" /> On the first American tour tensions peaked in Los Angeles, when Butler disappeared during a soundcheck. The gig went ahead, but for the rest of the tour the two parties barely spoke.<ref>Barnett, p. 122</ref> The tensions grew worse on the second American tour mainly because Butler's father had died, which forced Suede to cancel the tour prematurely.<ref name="AMG" /> Butler disliked the band's indulgence on the tour during his bereavement, in which he became so alienated from the band that he even travelled separately.<ref>Barnett, p. 128</ref> Suede's American success was limited as they had already begun to be upstaged by their opening act, [[The Cranberries]], who received the support from MTV that Suede lacked.<ref name="AMG" /> At times, Butler left the stage while Suede were performing and persuaded a member of The Cranberries to fill in for him.<ref name="H169">Harris, p. 169</ref> Moreover, a [[Suede (singer)|lounge singer]]'s [[lawsuit]] forced the band to stop using the trademarked American name "Suede". For their subsequent releases and shows in the United States, the band used the name "The London Suede".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rosenblum|first=Trudi Miller|title=Suede To Change Name for U.S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=18 January 2017|date=23 April 1994|archive-date=27 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027162804/https://books.google.com/books?id=RQgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|url-status=live}}</ref> Anderson was not happy about having to change the band's name for the US market, saying, "The London Suede is not the name I chose for the band, I didn't change it happily, and I'm not going to pretend I did."<ref name="NYT">{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB103AF93AA35751C0A963958260|title=The Pop Life|last=Strauss|first=Neil|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 February 1995|author-link=Neil Strauss|access-date=21 October 2018|url-access=subscription|archive-date=19 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319045943/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB103AF93AA35751C0A963958260|url-status=live}}</ref>

===1994–1995: Butler's exit and ''Dog Man Star''===
[[File:Bernand Butler live with The Tears (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Bernard Butler]] (shown here during a live performance with [[the Tears]] in 2005), left Suede in 1994 due to growing tensions between him and lead vocalist [[Brett Anderson]], with whom he finally made amends in 2003.]]
In February 1994, the band released the stand-alone single "[[Stay Together (Suede song)|Stay Together]]", which became their highest-charting single at the time, reaching number three in the UK. The single was backed by a collection of strong B-sides. The new expansive sound, however, fractured the band and led to the departure of Butler.<ref name="plagenhoef">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/modern-life-is-rubbish-the-rise-and-fall-of-britpop.htm|title=Modern Life is Rubbish: The Rise and Fall of Britpop|last=Plagenhoef|first=Scott|magazine=[[Stylus Magazine]]|date=23 June 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601131213/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/modern-life-is-rubbish-the-rise-and-fall-of-britpop.htm|archive-date=1 June 2016}}</ref> Despite the success of the single, the band has since distanced itself totally from the song, an aversion usually attributed to problems with Butler at the time.<ref>Barnett, p. 138</ref> In the aftermath of "Stay Together", Anderson isolated himself in a house in [[Highgate]] and began to write songs for Suede's next album.<ref>Harris, p. 170</ref> It was at this time that Anderson distanced himself from what was dubbed the "laddish Britpop movement," which he was seen by many to have set the scene for its emergence.<ref name="Guardian3">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/02/popandrock1|title=I'm surprised I made it to 30|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 September 2008|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=20 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620232712/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/02/popandrock1|url-status=live}}</ref> Bands such as [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] began to dominate the music scene, while Suede became more experimental and introverted. Tensions grew worse during the recording of the album when Butler criticised Anderson in a rare interview, claiming that he worked too slowly and that he was too concerned with rock stardom.<ref name="AMG" /> Of Anderson he said, "He's not a musician at all. It's very difficult for him to get around anything that isn't ABC."<ref>Barnett, p. 145</ref>

Around this time, journalist [[Neil Strauss]] wrote that Suede were a band who were "unafraid to be out of step with its peers."<ref name="NYT"/> The band started to record excessively lengthy songs at the behest of Butler. Osman said that he, Anderson and Gilbert often thought these tracks were the result of Butler trying to wind them up.<ref name="Harris171">Harris, p. 171</ref> Anderson recalled that Butler had largely recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band. This was usually done in shifts, with Anderson coming to the studio in the evenings after Butler had recorded his guitar parts during the day.<ref name="Harris171"/> The point at which tensions became unbearable was when Butler clashed with the producer [[Ed Buller]], who he insisted should be sacked as he wanted to produce the record himself.<ref>Barnett, p. 147</ref> Butler then gave Anderson an ultimatum demanding that the producer be fired or he would leave. "I called his bluff," said Anderson.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/on-top-of-their-material-cnl0sd6bdn3|title=On top of their material|last=Edwards|first=Mark|newspaper=The Times|date=14 September 2003|access-date=30 November 2018|url-access=subscription|archive-date=1 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201051431/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/on-top-of-their-material-cnl0sd6bdn3|url-status=live}}</ref> Days after Butler's wedding, he returned to the studio to find he was not being allowed in and his guitars were left out on the street.<ref>Harris, p. 171-172</ref> According to [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]]'s Britpop history, ''The Last Party'', the final words Butler uttered to Anderson were "you're a fucking [[cunt]]."<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/apr/22/popandrock|title=Frankly I hated Suede|newspaper=The Guardian|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|author-link=Alexis Petridis|date=22 April 2005|access-date=27 July 2013|archive-date=11 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111150033/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/apr/22/popandrock|url-status=live}}</ref> Butler left the band with a quarter of the recording still to be finished. In the first interview the band gave as a three-piece, Anderson foresaw the scenario, telling ''NME'''s Steve Sutherland: "I saw it coming two years ago.

Led by the single "[[We Are the Pigs]]", Suede's second album, ''[[Dog Man Star]]'', finally appeared in October 1994. The album was very well received by critics in the UK who wrote favourably of the band's new experimental direction. It entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number three,<ref name="uk_charts" /> but slid quickly down the charts.<ref>Harris, p. 187</ref> The singles from the album charted poorly, though they are still regarded as Suede's best output, especially "[[The Wild Ones (song)|The Wild Ones]]", which is considered by some to be Suede's best single.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|last1=Tangari|first1=Joe|title=Suede Dog Man Star [Deluxe Edition]|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/|website=Pitchfork|access-date=24 December 2015|date=7 July 2011|archive-date=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225040358/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/|url-status=live}}</ref> Reviews in the US were more mixed, with some critics comparing it unfavourably to the singles from the first album; and several labelling it as pretentious and other synonyms to that effect. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' would describe it as "one of the most pretentious albums ever released by a major label."<ref>{{cite book|chapter=London Suede|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9eocwUfoSoC&pg=PA493|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|author-link=Rob Sheffield|access-date=8 April 2013|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7432-0169-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/493 493–94]}}</ref> Nevertheless, despite not gaining mass exposure at the time, it steadily garnered a legacy throughout the decade and beyond as one of rock music's great albums.<ref name="Boyd"/> In September 1994, Suede announced that 17-year-old [[Richard Oakes (guitarist)|Richard Oakes]] was to be the new guitarist. After reading about Butler's departure, he had sent a demo tape to the band's fanclub.<ref>Barnett, p. 161</ref> When Gilbert heard Anderson playing back the tape whilst going through audition tapes, he mistakenly believed it to be an early Suede demo. Oakes' first official duty as a member of Suede was an appearance in the "We Are the Pigs" video. He then co-wrote his first music with Suede, the B-sides for the "[[New Generation]]" single, "Together" and "Bentswood Boys". Suede embarked on a long international tour during late 1994 and spring 1995, before disappearing to work on their third album. In 1995, the band contributed a track to ''[[The Help Album]]'' charity compilation, covering [[Elvis Costello]]'s "Shipbuilding".

===1996–2000: New line up and continuing success===
[[File:Suede in Thailand new.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Suede in Thailand, 1997. Left from right: [[Simon Gilbert (musician)|Simon Gilbert]], [[Richard Oakes (guitarist)|Richard Oakes]], [[Mat Osman]], [[Neil Codling]] and [[Brett Anderson]].]]
In the autumn of 1995, the band was joined by new member [[Neil Codling]], a cousin of Gilbert who played keyboards and second guitar. His first appearance was at a fanclub gig at the Hanover Grand on 27 January 1996, which turned out to be one of Suede's most important gigs. A short set devoid of Butler songs was well received by critics, "A set that says. 'No Need'," observed Steve Sutherland in ''NME''.<ref>Barnett, p. 195</ref> Even before ''Dog Man Star'' was released, bassist Mat Osman told ''Select'' magazine in September 1994 that he wanted to move on from the regimented recording process and expansive multi-layered guitar sounds of that era and focus on more radio-friendly pop music; citing "[[Losing My Religion]]" by [[R.E.M.]] as a song that "doesn't show off in the slightest and is still brilliant."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cavanagh |first1=David |title=3 Unlimited |journal=Select |date=October 1994 |issue=52 |page=86}}</ref> Anderson had a similar outlook, saying that in contrast to the band's previous albums, which he felt "suffered at certain times from being quite obscure," he intended the forthcoming album to be "almost like a 'greatest hits'."<ref name="Telegraph" /> Suede's third album, ''[[Coming Up (album)|Coming Up]]'', was released September 1996 and was preceded by the successful lead single, "[[Trash (Suede song)|Trash]]" in July. The single was popular and tied with "Stay Together" as the band's highest-charting UK single, reaching number three.<ref name="uk_charts" /> The album would become the band's biggest mainstream success, earning the band five straight top-10 singles and becoming a hit throughout Europe, Asia and Canada. ''Coming Up'' never did win an audience in America, partially because it appeared nearly a year after its initial release and partially because Suede only supported it with a three-city tour.<ref name="AMG" /> The tour was not helped by problems in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in which the band's music equipment was stolen, leaving them to play remaining shows with acoustic guitars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431379/19970527/london_suede.jhtml|title=London Suede Looks For Missing Gear Online|work=[[MTV.com]]|date=27 May 1997|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=3 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403022214/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431379/19970527/london_suede.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, the album topped the UK chart and became the band's biggest-selling release,<ref name="uk_charts" /> setting expectations high for the follow-up. With the success of the album, Suede secured top billing at the 1997 [[Reading Festival]]. Suede's next release was ''[[Sci-Fi Lullabies]]'', a collection of B-sides, which reached number nine on the UK Album Chart.<ref name="uk_charts" /> The compilation was well-received, with disc one of two being described by critics as the band's strongest collection of songs.<ref name="plagenhoef"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101000357reviews.html|title=Suede – Sci-Fi Lullabies|last=Beaumont|first=Mark|author-link=Mark Beaumont (journalist)|date=4 October 1997|website=[[NME]]|access-date=28 April 2016|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001016032541/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19980101000357reviews.html|archive-date=16 October 2000}}</ref>

By the time the compilation was released in 1997, the Britpop movement was noticeably waning in popularity, and the band had decided to split with their long-time producer Ed Buller before commencing work on the follow-up to ''Coming Up''. Before focusing work on their next album, the band recorded a version of "Poor Little Rich Girl" for the ''[[Twentieth-Century Blues: The Songs of Noel Coward]]'' in 1998. Despite being backed by their second-highest-charting single, "[[Electricity (Suede song)|Electricity]]", Suede's fourth album, ''[[Head Music]]'', did not evoke the critical and listener enthusiasm that previous records did, though it once again took the band to number one on the UK Albums Chart.<ref name="uk_charts" /> A synthesiser-infused album that focused less on guitar riffs and more on keyboards, it was produced by [[Steve Osborne]], who had worked with [[Happy Mondays]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]]. While the record was heavily promoted with some strong financial backing, and received almost widespread critical enthusiasm from the UK music press,<ref name="Sturges"/> the consensus with people close to the band was a feeling that things were not quite right. Richard Oakes was aware of the fans' disapproval of the album, as well as Anderson's more gaunt-like appearance and Oakes' own admission of spending two years "being pissed out [his] face and being out of shape."<ref>Barnett, p. 232</ref>  Moreover, many critics felt the record's lyrics were too shallow and lacking in substance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-76-1310557|title=Words don't come easy for Brett|work=NME|date=23 October 2000|access-date=19 December 2016|archive-date=22 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022073411/https://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-76-1310557|url-status=live}}</ref> Though others praised the album, feeling that the band were again taking a different direction and charting new territory.<ref name="Sturges">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-week-in-review-1090679.html|title=The Week in Review|last=Sturges|first=Fiona|work=The Independent|date=1 May 1999|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=20 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220003549/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-week-in-review-1090679.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The next three singles released from the album failed to enter the top 10, breaking a run stretching back to the 1996 single "Trash". Anderson also attracted more criticism from fans for his frequent use of redundant vocabulary and limited lyrical themes.<ref name="Times">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/better-the-devil-you-know-blk09dnzl25|title=Better the devil you know|newspaper=The Times|last=Segal|first=Victoria|date=23 April 2005|access-date=30 November 2018|url-access=subscription|archive-date=1 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201051328/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/better-the-devil-you-know-blk09dnzl25|url-status=live}}</ref> The track which received the most attention and criticism was "Savoir Faire".<ref name="Guardian2" /> Some critics felt that the album's lyricism could be linked to Anderson's heavy drug use at the time, especially when he later admitted that he "was a crack addict for ages".<ref name="Guardian2">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/feb/11/2|title=Pipe down|last=Harris|first=John|work=The Guardian|date=11 February 2005|author-link=John Harris (critic)|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021232351/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/feb/11/2|url-status=live}}</ref> Speaking of his addiction, which plagued him for two and a half years, Anderson said, "Anyone who has ever tried crack will know exactly why I took it. It's the scariest drug in the world because the hit you get from it is so, so seductive. I wanted to experience that, and I did – repeatedly."<ref name="Independent2" /> Suede headlined the [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] and [[V Festival]]s in July and August 1999 respectively. During 2000, there was press speculation that Suede were on the verge of disbanding, which was not helped by Codling's absence from some European gigs. Anderson denied these claims and insisted that Codling was healthy and that they were keen to record the next album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-184-1392698|title=Studio-bound Suede trash split stories|work=NME|date=2 May 2000|access-date=19 December 2016|archive-date=22 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022033727/https://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-184-1392698|url-status=live}}</ref> For the whole of 2000, Suede retreated from the public and played only one gig, in [[Reykjavik, Iceland]]. The band premiered several new songs that eventually appeared on the final album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/suede/4854|title=Geysers!|work=NME|date=23 October 2000|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=7 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507223238/http://www.nme.com/news/suede/4854|url-status=live}}</ref>

===2001–2003: Commercial disappointment and break-up===
Not long after the release of ''Head Music'', Nude Records effectively ceased to exist. Like many of their labelmates, Suede ended up signing to Nude's parent company/distributor [[Sony Records|Sony]] to record the band's fifth album, ''[[A New Morning]]''. Between the release of ''Head Music'' and ''A New Morning'', Suede wrote and recorded "Simon" as the title theme for the film ''Far From China''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280661/soundtrack "Far From China soundtracks"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908114248/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280661/soundtrack |date=8 September 2019 }}. [[IMDb]]. Retrieved on 1 January 2010.</ref> The long and troubled gestation of the new album saw the keyboard player, Codling, leave the band, citing [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], to be replaced by Alex Lee, formerly of [[Strangelove (band)|Strangelove]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80272/billboard-bits-fatboy-slim-suede-keb-mo|title=Billboard Bits: Fatboy Slim, Suede, Keb' Mo'|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|work=Billboard|date=23 March 2001|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=8 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008065817/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80272/billboard-bits-fatboy-slim-suede-keb-mo|url-status=live}}</ref> In concert, Lee played keyboards, second guitar, backing vocals and occasionally harmonica. The album title, according to Anderson, referred to "a fresh start, a new band and a new fresh outlook" – the singer had been addicted to heroin and [[crack cocaine]], which was having an increasingly deleterious effect on his health. Anderson claimed that ''A New Morning'' "was the first ever Suede record that wasn't influenced in its making by drugs".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/suede/12604|title=The Drugs Don't Work|work=NME|date=24 September 2002|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=11 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111161106/http://www.nme.com/news/suede/12604|url-status=live}}</ref>

Overall, seven different recording studios and four producers were used during the two years spent recording ''A New Morning'', with costs estimated at around £1&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/suede/11393|title='Morning' Glory!|work=NME|date=30 April 2002|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=9 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309201903/http://www.nme.com/news/suede/11393|url-status=live}}</ref> The album was a commercial disappointment which failed to enter the top 20 and it was never released in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71107/billboard-bits-memorial-day-anastasio-suede|title=Billboard Bits: Memorial Day, Anastasio, Suede|last=Carpenter|first=Troy|work=Billboard|date=12 May 2003|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=24 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624225611/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71107/billboard-bits-memorial-day-anastasio-suede|url-status=live}}</ref> ''A New Morning'' sharply divided fans of the band even more so than ''Head Music'' and critical reaction was decidedly lukewarm. Furthermore, the mainstream public interest had long disappeared. Only two singles, "[[Positivity (Suede song)|Positivity]]" and "[[Obsessions]]", were released, the fewest singles taken from any of the band's albums, and neither charted particularly well. Anderson has since stressed his disappointment with Suede's final album, stating "We made one Suede album too many. 'A New Morning' is the only one I don't believe in as much as the other Suede records and I totally believed in the first four, even 'Head Music' which divided the fans."<ref>{{cite web|title=Suede to Reform?|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/news/Suede-9528.html|website=femalefirst.co.uk|access-date=2 January 2017|date=9 October 2009|archive-date=3 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103003659/http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/news/Suede-9528.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Mat Osman told journalist Jon Cronshaw in October 2013 that: "It sounded like a Suede album that had been made by a committee – it was quite bland.

In September 2003, Suede played five nights at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London, dedicating each night to one of their five albums and playing through an entire album a night in chronological order, with B-sides and rarities as encores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69588/billboard-bits-suede-diane-schuur-alejandro-escovedo|title=Billboard Bits: Suede, Diane Schuur, Alejandro Escovedo|last=Carpenter|first=Troy|work=Billboard|date=11 August 2003|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=22 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022080415/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69588/billboard-bits-suede-diane-schuur-alejandro-escovedo|url-status=live}}</ref> In October 2003, Suede released a second compilation album ''[[Singles (Suede album)|Singles]]'', and an accompanying single "[[Attitude (Suede song)|Attitude]]", which charted at number 14 in the UK.

He added, "We're spending a lot of time working on tracks that sound nothing like traditional Suede."<ref name="New Suede!"/> The planned album was never released.

On 28 October 2003, Anderson made the decision to call it a day.

In August, the band played at the [[Skanderborg Festival]] in Denmark and Parkenfestivalen in Bodø, Norway.

Suede embarked on a full Asian tour, which began in late July in [[Jisan Valley Rock Festival|Jisan]], South Korea, and finished at the [[Summer Sonic]] festival in Tokyo, Japan, on 14 August 2011. Suede performed in Athens on 11 September 2011, and ended the band's touring commitments in Russia on 16 and 18 December 2011 where they showcased the new songs "Falling Planes", "The Only", "Someone Better", "I Don't Know Why", "Cold War", "Future Nightmare" and "Sabotage". Suede began recording a new album with Ed Buller in 2012 and Brett Anderson stated that of the songs showcased in Russia, only "Sabotage" was thus far in contention. On 7 January 2013, the band announced that the sixth studio album, ''[[Bloodsports (album)|Bloodsports]]'', would be released in March.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/49055-suede-announce-new-album-offer-free-download/|title=Suede announce new album, offer free download|last=Snapes|first=Laura|work=Pitchfork|date=7 January 2013|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=22 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022033556/https://pitchfork.com/news/49055-suede-announce-new-album-offer-free-download/|url-status=live}}</ref> The announcement was accompanied by "Barriers", a song from the album, as a free download.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/suede-unveil-first-new-material-in-ten-years|title=Suede Unveils First New Material In Ten Years|last=Murray|first=Robin|work=Clash|date=7 January 2013|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=22 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022073435/https://www.clashmusic.com/news/suede-unveil-first-new-material-in-ten-years|url-status=live}}</ref> They released their first single in a decade "It Starts and Ends with You" on 4 February.

===2014–2016: ''Night Thoughts''===
In late January 2014, Anderson announced that Suede were working on a new album, he estimated the album would be released in 2015 as the band are in the writing stage for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/suede/75179|title=Brett Anderson reveals Suede are working on a new album|work=NME|date=30 January 2014|access-date=1 February 2014|archive-date=25 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925084403/http://www.nme.com/news/suede/75179|url-status=live}}</ref> On 7 September 2015, the band announced that their new album, ''[[Night Thoughts (album)|Night Thoughts]]'', was to be released on 22 January 2016, alongside a feature film directed by photographer Roger Sargent.<ref name="Night Thoughts">{{cite web |last=Monroe |first=Jazz |title=Suede Announce New Album Night Thoughts and Accompanying Film |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/61100-suede-announce-new-album-night-thoughts-and-accompanying-film/ |website=Pitchfork |access-date=4 December 2018 |date=7 September 2015 |archive-date=8 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108173032/https://pitchfork.com/news/61100-suede-announce-new-album-night-thoughts-and-accompanying-film/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On 24 September, the first single from the album "Outsiders" was released. The band performed the album in full on 13 and 14 November at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|London Roundhouse]].<ref name="Night Thoughts"/> The album was released as a standalone CD issue, as a doublepack with the movie on DVD and as a limited numbered issue with CD, DVD and book. Anderson felt that unlike previous albums, for the first time the band had the freedom to do their own thing. Without the pressure to aim for the mainstream, the band deliberately eschewed from writing any radio hits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Night Thoughts sees Suede feeling inspired again says Brett Anderson |url=http://www.irishnews.com/arts/2016/02/05/news/night-thoughts-sees-suede-feeling-inspired-again-says-brett-anderson-404143/ |newspaper=[[The Irish News]] |access-date=4 December 2018 |date=5 February 2016 |archive-date=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204102206/http://www.irishnews.com/arts/2016/02/05/news/night-thoughts-sees-suede-feeling-inspired-again-says-brett-anderson-404143/ |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Night Thoughts'' was very well received by both fans and critics, receiving widespread press coverage on its release. Following on from the success of ''Bloodsports'', ''Night Thoughts'' charted at no. 6 in the UK. A series of concert dates in the UK and Europe to support the release followed. The first half of each show consisted of the band playing the album tracks in sequence, while onstage behind a gauze screen with the movie projected onto it. The second half consisted of a mix of back catalogue material, including a number of b-sides and obscure songs. The band also did a number of instore acoustic appearances in HMV stores to promote the release, including Q&A sessions and movie screenings.

During the period were the band wrote and toured ''Night Thoughts'', they also commemorated some of their earlier releases. Once again the band performed as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust charity at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March 2014. This time, the band performed ''[[Dog Man Star]]'' in full to mark its 20th anniversary. The set was followed by b-sides from that era, and then a greatest hits finale, which included new song "I Don't Know How to Reach You".<ref>{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Lisa |title=Suede debut new track at 'Dog Man Star' 20th anniversary show for Teenage Cancer Trust |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-17-1238757 |work=NME |access-date=4 December 2018 |date=31 March 2014 |archive-date=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204105432/https://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-17-1238757 |url-status=live }}</ref> Furthermore, to celebrate the actual 20th anniversary release of the album, Suede released a limited edition box set in October 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-16-1237492|title=Suede to release 20th anniversary 'Dog Man Star' boxset|work=[[NME]]|last=Cooper|first=Leonie|date=29 August 2014|access-date=9 December 2016|archive-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220234128/http://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-16-1237492|url-status=live}}</ref> A similar 20th anniversary reissue was released for ''[[Coming Up (album)|Coming Up]]'' in September 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Earls |first=John |title=Suede to release deluxe edition of 'Coming Up' album |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-196-1193609 |work=NME |access-date=4 December 2018 |date=16 August 2016 |archive-date=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204103829/https://www.nme.com/news/music/suede-196-1193609 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2018–2020: ''The Blue Hour''===

==Legacy and influence==
A significant part of Suede's legacy consists in having kickstarted the Britpop scene which eventually overshadowed the band's own achievements in the public mind. [[Alexis Petridis]] wrote in 2005, "These days, rock historians tend to depict Suede's success as a kind of amuse bouche (appetizer) before the earth-shattering arrival of Britpop's main course".<ref name="Guardian" /> In an article about the British music press's "ferocious one-upmanship campaign" of the mid-1990s, Caroline Sullivan, writing for ''The Guardian'' in February 1996, noted Suede's appearance as an unsigned band on the cover of ''Melody Maker'' as a pivotal moment in the history of Britpop:

<blockquote>Suede appeared on Melody Maker's cover before they had a record out... The exposure got them a record deal, brought a bunch of like-minded acts to the public's attention, and helped create Britpop. It was the best thing to happen to music in years, and it mightn't have happened without that Suede cover.<ref name="Seeing Stars">Sullivan, Caroline. "Feature: ''Seeing Stars''". ''The Guardian''. 5 February 1996. p. 39.</ref></blockquote>

The year following the ''Melody Maker'' cover saw Suede captivate a pop phenomenon of critical praise and hype.<ref name="Independent1" /> Not since the dawn of the Smiths had a British band caused such excitement with the release of just a few singles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1993-06-09/music/suede-by-hype-heroes-at-home-england-s-latest-pop-fad-tests-America|title=Suede by hype heroes at home, England's latest pop fad tests America|last=Simons|first=Ted|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|date=9 June 1993|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=10 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110054037/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1993-06-09/music/suede-by-hype-heroes-at-home-england-s-latest-pop-fad-tests-america/|url-status=dead}}</ref> A March 1993 article in ''The Independent'' wrote that "Suede have had more hype than anybody since the Smiths, or possibly even the [[Sex Pistols]]. The reviews are florid, poetic, half-crazed; they express the almost lascivious delight of journalists hungry for something to pin their hopes on."<ref name="Independent1" /> Suede are regarded by many as the first British band to break into the mainstream from the new wave of alternative rock in the '90s. With their glam rock style and musical references of urban Britain, Suede paved the way for acts such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] to enter the British mainstream.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/#/news/suede-blitzes-europe-for-head-music-946538.story|title=Suede Blitzes Europe For 'Head Music'|work=Billboard|date=7 April 1999|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=10 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710030942/http://www.billboard.com/#/news/suede-blitzes-europe-for-head-music-946538.story|url-status=live}}</ref> They were influential in returning some of the creative impetus to English guitar music in a scene increasingly dominated by [[Madchester]], [[Grunge]] and [[Shoegazing]].<ref name="BBC"/> Even beyond their own shores, American heavy metal personality [[Eric Greif]] declared that Suede "reinvented and repackaged glam in a creative way, and how refreshing that was as a counterpoint to the drab grunge of the time."<ref>[http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/greif.shtml ''ERIC GREIF INTERVIEW'', Sleaze Roxx Magazine (28 April 2007)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929001925/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/greif.shtml |date=29 September 2011 }}, (retrieved 24 February 2013)</ref>

Suede's laurels would remain intact through their early career until Butler's departure, which the press signalled as the end of Suede. As new rock bands were arriving on the scene, British pop culture was in the midst of a shift towards [[lad culture]] and the same critics who championed Suede were now plotting to extinguish them.<ref name="Telegraph" /> In February 1995, music critic [[J.D. Considine]] said the band "quickly fell victim to the build-'em-up-then-knock-'em-down mentality of the English music press."<ref>{{cite news |last=Considine |first=J. D. |title=London Suede wears change well |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=19 February 1995 |author-link=J. D.

As one writer put it at the end of Suede's career, "Suede slid from zeitgeist into a smaller, pocket-sized cult band."<ref name="Independent2" /> In the same article, Anderson spoke about their legacy:

<blockquote>"It's not in my nature to be bitter. We may have been overlooked somewhat, but all you need to do is listen to the music. Our legacy speaks for itself." He added, "...Fate dealt us this card, and I don't think we've done particularly badly with it. Music today seems so very worthy, so very dull. Nobody wants to stick their neck out any more, and I think that is a great pity. We did, and we left our mark."<ref name="Independent2" /></blockquote>

"Still one of the great British bands of the '90s," [[David Bowie]] told ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' in 1996. "They have the enviable knack of taking the rather pathetic fumble of a quick fuck under the pier and extracting those few golden moments that many years later convince oneself that, for one brief flickering moment, one was as inspired as [[Romeo]] or, in some cases, [[Juliet]]. The poor things are bound to be an institution by the year 2000.

===Impact on other artists===
