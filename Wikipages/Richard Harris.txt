'''Richard St John Harris''' (1 October 1930 – 25 October 2002) was an Irish actor and singer. He appeared on stage and in many films, notably as Frank Machin in ''[[This Sporting Life]]'', for which he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and as [[King Arthur]] in the 1967 film ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'', as well as the 1981 revival of the stage musical.

He played an aristocrat captured by Native Americans in ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), a [[gunfighter]] in [[Clint Eastwood]]'s Western film ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992), [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] in ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000), ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (2002 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (2002) as [[Abbé Faria]], and [[Albus Dumbledore]] in the first two ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' films: ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone]]'' (2001) and ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' (2002), the latter of which was his final film role. Harris had a number-one singing hit in Australia, Jamaica and Canada, and a top-ten hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and United States with his 1968 recording of [[Jimmy Webb]]'s song "[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]." In 2020, he was listed at number 3 on ''[[The Irish Times]]'' list of Ireland's greatest film actors.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/the-50-greatest-irish-film-actors-of-all-time-in-order-1.4271988 | title=The 50 greatest Irish film actors of all time – in order | first1=Donald | last1=Clarke | first2=Tara | last2=Brady | date=13 June 2020 | newspaper=The Irish Times | access-date=25 July 2020 }}</ref>

==Early life==

Harris was born on 1 October 1930, in [[Limerick]].<ref name="irishind">{{cite news|title=He was one of the most outstanding film stars of his time|work=Irish Independent|date=27 October 2002|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/harris-was-one-of-the-most--outstanding-film-stars-of-his-time-504644.html|access-date=10 December 2007}}</ref><ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|last=Severo|first=Richard|title=Richard Harris, Versatile And Volatile Star, 72, Dies|work=The New York Times|date=26 October 2002|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E2D91E3CF935A15753C1A9649C8B63|access-date=10 December 2007}}</ref> He was schooled by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] at [[Crescent College]]. A talented [[Rugby football|rugby]] player, he appeared on several [[Munster Schools Junior Cup|Munster Junior]] and [[Munster Schools Rugby Senior Cup|Senior Cup]] teams for Crescent, and played for [[Garryowen Football Club|Garryowen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wesclark.com/rrr/harris_rugby_article.html |title=Limerick rugby full of heroes |publisher=Wesclark.com |date=24 May 2002 |access-date=8 November 2011}}</ref> Harris's athletic career was cut short when he caught [[tuberculosis]] in his teens. He remained an ardent fan of the [[Munster Rugby]] and [[Young Munster]] teams until his death, attending many of their matches, and there are numerous stories of japes at rugby matches with actors and fellow rugby fans [[Peter O'Toole]] and [[Richard Burton]].

After recovering from [[tuberculosis]], Harris moved to Great Britain, wanting to become a director. He could not find any suitable training courses, and enrolled in the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]] (LAMDA) to learn acting. He had failed an audition at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) and had been rejected by the [[Royal Central School of Speech and Drama|Central School of Speech and Drama]], because they felt he was too old at 24.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/richard-harris-615104.html]{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> While still a student, he rented the tiny "off-[[West End of London|West End]]" Irving Theatre, and there directed his own production of [[Clifford Odets]]'s play ''Winter Journey (The Country Girl)''.

After completing his studies at the Academy, he joined [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]]. He began getting roles in West End theatre productions, starting with ''[[The Quare Fellow]]'' in 1956, a transfer from the Theatre Workshop. He spent nearly a decade in obscurity, learning his profession on stages throughout the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2361801.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Obituary: Richard Harris |work=BBC News |date=25 October 2002 |access-date=10 November 2012}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early supporting roles===
Harris made his film debut in 1959 in the film ''[[Alive and Kicking (1959 film)|Alive and Kicking]]'', and played the lead role in ''[[The Ginger Man (play)|The Ginger Man]]'' in the West End in 1959. In his second film he had a small role as an IRA Volunteer in ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (1959 film)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'' (1959), supporting [[James Cagney]]. The film was shot in Ireland and directed by [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]] who offered Harris a role in his next movie, ''[[The Wreck of the Mary Deare (film)|The Wreck of the Mary Deare]]'' (1959), shot in Hollywood.
[[File:Richard Harris 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|Harris in the 1960s]]

Harris played another IRA Volunteer in ''[[A Terrible Beauty (film)|A Terrible Beauty]]'' (1960), alongside [[Robert Mitchum]]. He had a memorable [[bit part]] in the film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961) as a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] pilot who reports that blowing up the "bloody guns" of the island of Navarone is impossible by an [[strategic bombing|air raid]]. He had a larger part in ''[[The Long and the Short and the Tall (film)|The Long and the Short and the Tall]]'' (1961), playing a British soldier; Harris clashed with [[Laurence Harvey]] during filming.

For his role in the film ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1962), despite being virtually unknown to film audiences, Harris reportedly insisted on third billing, behind [[Trevor Howard]] and [[Marlon Brando]], an actor he greatly admired, but Harris fell out with Brando over the latter's behaviour during the film's production.

===''This Sporting Life''===

Harris's first starring role was in the film ''[[This Sporting Life]]'' (1963), as a bitter young coal miner, Frank Machin, who becomes an acclaimed [[rugby league]] football player. It was based on the novel by [[David Storey]] and directed by [[Lindsay Anderson]]. For his role, Harris won [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] in 1963 at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award nomination]].

Harris followed this with a leading role in the Italian film, [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Red Desert (film)|Il Deserto Rosso]]'' (''Red Desert'', 1964). This won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

Harris received an offer to support [[Kirk Douglas]] in a British war film, ''[[The Heroes of Telemark]]'' (1965), directed by [[Anthony Mann]], playing a Norwegian resistance leader. He then went to Hollywood to support [[Charlton Heston]] in [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Major Dundee]]'' (1965), as an Irish immigrant who became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cavalryman during the [[American Civil War]].

He played [[Cain]] in [[John Huston]]'s film ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' (1966). More successful at the box office was ''[[Hawaii (1966 film)|Hawaii]]'' (1966), in which Harris starred alongside [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Max von Sydow]]. As a change of pace, he was the romantic lead in a [[Doris Day]] spy spoof comedy, ''[[Caprice (1967 film)|Caprice]]'' (1967), directed by [[Frank Tashlin]].

=== ''Camelot'', ''A Man Called Horse''===

Harris next performed the role of [[King Arthur]] in the film adaptation of the musical play ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' (1967). Critic [[Roger Ebert]] described the casting of Harris and [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as "about the best King Arthur and Queen Guenevere I can imagine".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/camelot-1967|title= Camelot movie review|website= rogerebert.com|access-date= 25 May 2020}}</ref> Harris revived the role in a [[Broadway (theater)|Broadway]] revival at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] from 15 November 1981, to 2 January 1982, and broadcast on [[HBO]] a year later. Starring [[Meg Bussert]] as Guenevere, [[Richard Muenz]] as Lancelot and [[Thor Fields]] as Tom of Warwick. Harris, who had starred in the film, and Muenz also took the show on tour nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.playbill.com/article/richard-harris-king-arthur-of-camelot-on-stage-and-screen-dead-at-72-com-109167|title= Richard Harris, King Arthur of Camelot on Stage and Screen, Dead at 72|website= [[Playbill]].com|date= 25 October 2002|access-date= 25 May 2020}}</ref>

In ''[[The Molly Maguires (film)|The Molly Maguires]]'' (1970), he played [[James McParland]], the detective who infiltrates the title organisation, headed by [[Sean Connery]]. It was a box office flop. However ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), with Harris in the title role, an 1825 English aristocrat who is captured by Native Americans, was a major success.

He played the title role in the film ''[[Cromwell (film)|Cromwell]]'' in 1970 opposite [[Alec Guinness]] as King [[Charles I of England]]. That year British exhibitors voted him the 9th-most popular star at the UK box office.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul Newman Britain's favourite star|work=The Times|location=London, England|date=31 December 1970|page=9|via=The Times Digital Archive}}</ref>

===Singing career===

Harris recorded several albums of music, one of which, ''[[A Tramp Shining]]'', included the seven-minute hit song "[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]" (Harris insisted on singing the lyric as "MacArthur's Park").<ref>Fresh Air interview with Jimmy Webb by Terry Gross on NPR, 2004</ref> This song was written by [[Jimmy Webb]], and it reached number 2 on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart. It also topped several music sales charts in Europe during the summer of 1968. "MacArthur Park" sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| last = Murrells| first = Joseph| title = The Book of Golden Discs| url = https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr| url-access = registration| edition = 2nd| year = 1978| publisher = Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location = London| isbn = 978-0-214-20512-5| page = 241| access-date = 8 November 2011 }}</ref> A second album, also consisting entirely of music composed by Webb, ''[[The Yard Went on Forever]]'', was released in 1969.<ref>Album liner notes for "Richard Harris – the Webb Sessions 1968–1969"</ref> In the 1973 TV special "[[Burt Bacharach]] in Shangri-La", after singing Webb's "Didn't We", Harris tells Bacharach that since he was not a trained singer he approached songs as an actor concerned with words and emotions, acting the song with the sort of honesty the song is trying to convey. Then he proceeds to sing "If I Could Go Back", from the ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' soundtrack.

===1970s===

In 1971 Harris starred in a [[BBC]] TV film adaptation ''[[The Snow Goose (film)|The Snow Goose]]'', from a screenplay by [[Paul Gallico]]. It won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for Best Movie made for TV and was nominated for both a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present]]|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|page=1422}}</ref> and was shown in the U.S. as part of the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]''.

He made his directorial debut with ''[[Bloomfield (film)|Bloomfield]]'' (1971) and starred in ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971) a revisionist Western based on the [[Hugh Glass]] story.

===Action star===
[[File:Orca (1977) trailer - Richard Harris 3.png|thumb|Harris in ''[[Orca (1977 film)|Orca]]'']]
Harris starred in a Western for [[Samuel Fuller]], ''Riata'', which stopped production several weeks into filming. The project was re-assembled with a new director and cast, except for Harris, who returned: ''[[The Deadly Trackers]]'' (1973).

In 1973, Harris published a book of poetry, ''I, In the Membership of My Days'', which was later reissued in part in an audio [[LP record|LP]] format, augmented by self-penned songs such as "I Don't Know."

Harris starred in two thrillers: ''[[99 and 44/100% Dead]]'' (1974), for [[John Frankenheimer]], and ''[[Juggernaut (1974 film)|Juggernaut]]'' (1974), for Richard Lester. In ''[[Echoes of a Summer]]'' (1976) he played the father of a young girl with a terminal illness. He had a cameo as [[Richard the Lionheart]] in ''[[Robin and Marian]]'' (1976), for Lester, then was in ''[[The Return of a Man Called Horse]]'' (1976).

Harris led the all-star cast in the train disaster film ''[[The Cassandra Crossing]]'' (1976). He played Gulliver in the part-animated ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1977 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1977) and was reunited with Michael Anderson in ''[[Orca (1977 film)|Orca]]'' (1977), battling a killer whale.

He appeared in another action film, ''[[Golden Rendezvous]]'' (1977), based on a novel by Alistair Maclean, shot in South Africa. Harris was sued by the film's producer for his drinking; Harris counter-sued for defamation and the matter was settled out of court.<ref>{{cite news|title=Actor Harris linked to scandal in South Africa|work=Chicago Tribune|date=Nov 22, 1978|page=a6}}</ref>

''Golden Rendezvous'' was a flop but ''[[The Wild Geese]]'' (1978), where Harris played one of several mercenaries, was a big success outside America.<ref name="harris">{{cite news|title=Richard Harris: Ain't Misbehavin'|author=Mann, Roderick|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Mar 14, 1978|page=e8}}</ref> ''[[Ravagers (film)|Ravagers]]'' (1979) was more action, set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world. ''[[Game for Vultures]]'' (1979) was set in Rhodesia and shot in South Africa.

In Hollywood he appeared in a comedy, ''[[The Last Word (1979 film)|The Last Word]]'' (1979), then supported [[Bo Derek]] in ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1981).

He made a film in Canada, ''[[Your Ticket Is No Longer Valid]]'' (1981), a drama about impotence. He followed it with another Canadian film, ''[[Highpoint (film)|Highpoint]]'', a movie so bad it was not released for several years.

===''Camelot'' again and ''Henry IV''===

For a while in the 1980s, Harris went into semi-retirement on [[Paradise Island]], in the [[Bahamas]], where he kicked his drinking habit and embraced a healthier lifestyle. It had a beneficial effect. Harris's career was revived by his success on stage in ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', and powerful in the [[West End theatre|West End]] run of [[Luigi Pirandello|Pirandello's]] ''[[Henry IV (Pirandello)|Henry IV]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Richard Harris obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/28/guardianobituaries.arts|agency=Associated Press |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 Oct 2002 |access-date=3 October 2020}}</ref>

He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1990, when he was surprised by [[Michael Aspel]] during the curtain call of the [[Luigi Pirandello|Pirandello's]] play ''Henry IV'' at the [[Wyndham’s Theatre]] in London.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

His film work during this period included: ''[[Triumphs of a Man Called Horse]]'' (1983), ''[[Martin's Day]]'' (1985), ''Strike Commando 2'' (1988), ''[[King of the Wind (film)|King of the Wind]]'' (1990) and ''[[Mack the Knife (1989 film)|Mack the Knife]]'' (1990) (a film version of ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' in which he played J.J. Peachum ) plus the [[Maigret (1988 film)|TV film version]] of [[Maigret]], opposite [[Barbara Shelley]]. This indicated declining popularity which Harris told his biographer, [[Michael Feeney Callan]], he was "utterly reconciled to".

===''The Field'' and ''Harry Potter''===
[[File:Richard Harris 1985.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Harris in 1985]]

In June 1989, director [[Jim Sheridan]] cast Harris in the lead role in ''[[The Field (film)|The Field]]'', written by the esteemed Irish playwright [[John B. Keane]]. The lead role of "Bull" McCabe was to be played by former [[Abbey Theatre]] actor [[Ray McAnally]]. When McAnally died suddenly on 15 June 1989, Harris was offered the McCabe role. ''The Field'' was released in 1990 and earned Harris his second [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award nomination for Best Actor]]. He lost to [[Jeremy Irons]] for ''[[Reversal of Fortune]]''.

In 1992, Harris had a supporting role in the film ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]''. He had good roles in ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992), ''[[Wrestling Ernest Hemingway]]'' (1993) and ''[[Silent Tongue]]'' (1994).

Over several years in the late 1980s, Harris worked with Irish author [[Michael Feeney Callan]] on his biography, which was published by [[Sidgwick & Jackson]] in 1990.

Harris appeared in two films which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. First, as the gunfighter "English Bob" in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992); second, as the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000). He also played a lead role alongside [[James Earl Jones]] in the [[Darrell Roodt]] film adaptation of ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country (1995 film)|Cry, the Beloved Country]]'' (1995). In 1999, Harris starred in the film ''[[To Walk with Lions]]''. After ''Gladiator'', Harris played the supporting role of [[Albus Dumbledore]] in the first two of the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' films, and as [[Abbé Faria]] in [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]]' film adaptation of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (2002 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (2002). The film ''[[Kaena: The Prophecy]]'' (2003) was dedicated to him posthumously as he had voiced the character Opaz before his death.

Harris hesitated to take the role of Dumbledore in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (2001) at first due to his declining health, but ultimately accepted because his 11-year-old granddaughter threatened never to speak to him again if he did not take it.<ref>"The Late Show With David Letterman"  ''interview, 2001</ref> In an interview with the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' in 2001, Harris expressed his concern that his association with the ''Harry Potter'' films would outshine the rest of his career. He explained, "Because, you see, I don't just want to be remembered for being in those bloody films, and I'm afraid that's what's going to happen to me."<ref>{{cite web|author=Kristin |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2003/7/9/on-richard-harris |title=On Richard Harris'' The Leaky Cauldron |date=9 July 2003 |publisher=The-leaky-cauldron.org |access-date=8 November 2011}}</ref>

Harris was a lifelong friend of actor [[Peter O'Toole]], and his family reportedly hoped that O'Toole would replace Harris as Dumbledore in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004). There were, however, concerns about insuring O'Toole for the six remaining films in the series.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fame10.com/entertainment/12-actors-who-were-almost-cast-in-the-harry-potter-series/?streamview=all|title=12 Actors Who Almost Starred In The Harry Potter Series|work=Fame 10|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> Harris was ultimately succeeded as Dumbledore by [[Michael Gambon]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9733802/Michael-Gambon-receives-Richard-Harris-Award-and-admits-...-all-I-did-was-copy-him-as-Dumbledore.html |title=Michael Gambon receives Richard Harris Award and admits ... all I did was copy him as Dumbledore |date=9 December 2012 |access-date=9 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]]}}</ref> [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], director of ''Philosopher's Stone'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' (2002), had visited Harris during his last days and had promised him to not recast him as Dumbledore, confident of his eventual recovery.

==Memorials==

[[File:Richard Harris Statue Kilkee 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A statue in [[Kilkee]], Ireland, of the young Richard Harris playing squash]]

On 30 September 2006, Manuel Di Lucia, of [[Kilkee]], County Clare, a longtime friend, organised the placement in Kilkee of a bronze life-size statue of Richard Harris. It shows Harris at the age of eighteen playing the sport of [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. The sculptor was Seamus Connolly and the work was unveiled by [[Russell Crowe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/?c=ENTERTAINMENT&jp=cwqlsnkfidau&d=2 |work=BreakingNews.ie |date=2 October 2006 |title=Crowe pays tribute to Harris at Irish ceremony}}</ref> Harris was an accomplished squash racquets player, winning the Tivoli Cup in Kilkee four years in a row from 1948 to 1951, a record unsurpassed to this day.<ref name="Richard Harris and the Tivoli Cup">{{cite web|url=http://www.kilkee.ie/about_history_tivolicup.html |title=Tivoli Cup in Kilkee |publisher=kilkee.ie |access-date=21 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810075626/http://www.kilkee.ie/about_history_tivolicup.html |archive-date=10 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Another life-size statue of Richard Harris, as King Arthur from his film ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'', has been erected in Bedford Row, in the centre of his home town of Limerick. The sculptor of this statue was the Irish sculptor Jim Connolly, a graduate of the [[Limerick School of Art and Design]].

At the 2009 BAFTAs, [[Mickey Rourke]] dedicated his Best Actor award to Harris, calling him a "good friend and great actor".

In 2013, Rob Gill and Zeb Moore founded the annual Richard Harris International Film Festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://richardharrisfilmfestival.com/|title=Richard Harris International Film Festival – International Film Festival}}</ref>
The Richard Harris Film Festival is one of Ireland's fastest-growing film festivals, growing from just ten films in 2013 to over 115 films in 2017. Each year, one of Harris's sons attends the annual festival (October Bank Holiday Weekend) in Limerick.

==Legacy==

In 1996 Harris was honoured with a [[List of people on the postage stamps of Ireland#1990s|commemorative Irish postage stamp]] for the "Centenary of Irish Cinema", a four-stamp set featuring twelve Irish actors in four Irish films. He was recognized for his role as Bull McCabe in&nbsp;1990 film ''The Field''.
