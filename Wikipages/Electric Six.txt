==History==
===Formation and the Wildbunch years (1996–2000)===
The band formed in 1996 and was initially known as The Wildbunch, eventually dropping that name due to pressure from the British [[The Wild Bunch (sound system)|group of the same name]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0314,phillips,43005,22.html | title = Sax as a Weapon: You Didn't Know that Rock 'n' roll Burned | first = Amy | last = Phillips | date = 2003-04-02 | work=[[The Village Voice]] | access-date = 2006-12-31 }}</ref> Throughout the latter half of the 1990s, they played regularly at the Old Miami and the Gold Dollar in [[Detroit]],<ref name="official_bio">{{cite web | url = http://www.electricsix.com/meet.html | title = Meet the Electric Six | website=ElectricSix.com | access-date = 2006-07-14 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060701160356/http://www.electricsix.com/meet.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-07-01}}</ref> the center of a scene that produced breakout acts like the [[White Stripes]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=291943 | title = The White Stripes: Candy Coloured Blues – Unauthorized |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first = Jeremy | last = Wheeler | year = 2003 | access-date = 2006-12-31 }}</ref> The band was originally composed of Dick Valentine ([[Tyler Spencer]], lead vocals), M (Cory Martin, drums), The Rock and Roll Indian (Anthony Selph, lead guitar), Surge Joebot (Joe Frezza, rhythm guitar), and Disco (Steve Nawara, bass and former member of [[The Detroit Cobras]]).

{{cquote|Though some have claimed this video portrays me dancing on Freddie Mercury's grave, but that wasn't the idea. Actually it's more like we are resurrecting Mr. Mercury for the duration of the song and his grave is the logical starting point. We just were trying to show him being resurrected from the grave for three and a half minutes. I guess a video like that can be taken the wrong way, but we hadn't looked at it like that. Anyhow, everyone knows we disliked the fact that we had to put this song on our record, so this ridiculous video took a little bit of the sting out of it for us and made it somewhat bearable. It was also very rewarding to work with dogs. In terms of the response we've had, some people think it's brilliant. To the others, we can only apologise. We never meant for it to be taken that way. But I definitely respect Freddie and his work.}}

===''Switzerland'' (2006)===
In November 2004, drummer M. called it quits, leaving Dick Valentine as the sole original member of the former Wildbunch. Their new drummer, Percussion World (Mike Alonso), had been affiliated with the band and its members for some time, and was named as a permanent member of the band.

Electric Six finished recording their third album, titled ''[[Switzerland (album)|Switzerland]]'', in November 2005<ref name="gothamist"/> and released it in North America on September 12, 2006.

==Sound, style, and influences==
Electric Six incorporates a variety of styles, resulting in being termed a "genre-blurring" band.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.chartattack.com/news/41291/electric-six-revitalized-and-ready-to-hit-the-road | title = Electric Six Revitalized and Ready to Hit the Road | work = [[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] | date = 2006-06-06 | access-date = 2009-07-25 | first = Max | last = Hayman |url-status=dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607171149/http://www.chartattack.com/news/41291/electric-six-revitalized-and-ready-to-hit-the-road | archive-date = June 7, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The group's sound has been described as a synthesis of "disco, synth pop, glam, and arena rock,"<ref>{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r733199|pure_url=yes}} | title = Review of ''Señor Smoke'' |website=[[AllMusic]] | first = Heather | last = Phares | access-date = 2006-12-31 }}</ref> including the [[falsetto]] vocals of disco, laden with "rampant solos, be they guitar riffs, synth wails, or strutting drums" that enforce the band's "energetic sound."<ref name="epitonic">{{cite web | url = http://www.epitonic.com/artists/electricsix.html | title = Electric Six | work = Epitonic.com | first = Sandy | last = Hunter | date = 2003-07-03 | access-date = 2006-12-31 |url-status=dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061201005844/http://www.epitonic.com/artists/electricsix.html | archive-date = December 1, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> However, the band members themselves have rejected such genre classifications as "disco-metal" and "disco-punk."<ref>{{ cite news|url=http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?f_id=201 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070722220544/http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?f_id=201 |url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-07-22 |title=Detroit's Burning |first=Matt |last=Schild |website=Aversion.com |date=2003-06-11 |access-date=2006-12-31 }}</ref>{{Clarify|date=June 2009}}

Lead singer Dick Valentine had commented on the aforementioned lyrical tendencies in song content with regards to the band's third album:

{{quote|[...] for the first time, none of the songs have the word "dance" or variation of "dance" in the title. But fear not. We have songs with "drugs" and "girls" and "tonight" and "night" and "louder" and "party" in the title, so we haven't given up on our philosophy just yet.|<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.electricsix.com/archive/2006_01_01_archive.html#113769687042051658 | title = Frequently Asked Questions 2006 | date = 2006-01-19 | website=ElectricSix.com | access-date = 2006-07-14 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615085005/http://www.electricsix.com/archive/2006_01_01_archive.html#113769687042051658 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-06-15}}</ref>}}
