{{nihongo|'''Maximum the Hormone'''|マキシマム ザ ホルモン|Makishimamu Za Horumon|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Hachiōji, Tokyo]]. Their lineup has consisted of vocalist [[Daisuke Tsuda (musician)|Daisuke-han]], drummer [[Nao Kawakita|Nao]], guitarist [[Ryo Kawakita|Maximum the Ryo-kun]], and bassist [[Futoshi Uehara|Ue-chan]] since 1999. Each member alternates singing lead vocals, often within the same song, with the exception of Ue-chan, who provides backup vocals almost exclusively.

The group is best known for their unconventional and experimental style of [[alternative metal]] music. Over their career, they have found success incorporating elements of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[hardcore punk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[pop music|pop]], [[funk music|funk]], and [[ska music|ska]] into their sound.<ref name="Billboard MTH"/> Stylistically, their music runs the gamut from being dark and serious, to ironic or humorous, often with drastic shifts in tempo and mood over the course of a song. The band's eclectic nature frequently draws comparisons to [[System of a Down]].<ref name="Metal Injection"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://loudwire.com/best-japanese-metal-bands/|title=10 Best Japanese Metal Bands|magazine=[[Loudwire]]|first=Joe|last=DiVita|date=April 16, 2017|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref>

==History==

===1998–2001: Formation, early days, and line-up change===
[[File:MTHlogo.png|thumb|right|Maximum the Hormone written in Japanese characters, used as the band logo since 2001]]
Maximum the Hormone was formed in 1998 by vocalist [[Daisuke Tsuda (musician)|Daisuke-han]] and drummer [[Nao Kawakita|Nao]].<ref name="MTHhistory">{{cite web | title=Maximum the Hormone history | work=jmusiceuropa.com | url=http://www.jmusiceuropa.com/uk/database-artist.php?id=644 | access-date=2007-06-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312050928/http://www.jmusiceuropa.com/uk/database-artist.php?id=644 | archive-date=2009-03-12 | url-status=dead }}</ref> After recruiting guitarist Key and bassist Sugi, and having played some regional shows, the band signed a contract with the Japanese rock label Sky Records. ''[[A.S.A. Crew]]'' was the first album released under that label and was the only full-length album released by the original lineup. At that time Daisuke wrote his lyrics completely in English, and the band name ''Maximum the Hormone'' was written in Latin letters. Key and Sugi left the band in 1999.

The band then recruited Nao's younger brother [[Ryo Kawakita|Maximum the Ryo-kun]], who had played guitar since junior high school and could also sing. From then on, Ryo-kun became the band's co-lead vocalist, handling singing duties while Daisuke handles screams and raps. The lineup was completed by bassist [[Futoshi Uehara|Ue-chan]] joining shortly after Ryo. The band then decided to write their band name in [[katakana]] to reflect the change in the band members, and the band also started incorporating [[Japanese language|Japanese]] into their lyrics.<ref name="MTHhistory"/> In 2001, the band released an [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Hō]]''.

When asked about the group's name in an interview, Maximum the Ryo-kun stated "Take it as you like, it means anything from the Japanese cuisine for cooking animal innards to the sensation of the maximum amount of your hormones coming to the boil! Although when we go abroad people think we’re just some sorta sexual energy drink."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tenga-global.com/voice/ryokun.php |title=Voice (Maximum The Ryo-kun) &#124; TENGA Official Site |publisher=Tenga-global.com |access-date=2013-11-04}}</ref> "Hormone" (or [[Yakiniku#Typical ingredients|horumon]]) is a style of [[yakiniku]] (Japanese BBQ) where many of the typically discarded internal organs are grilled in bite sized pieces and eaten.

===2002–2007: Commercial success===
In 2002, the band left Sky Records and signed with Mimikajiru Records. The band released the single, "[[Niku Cup]]", followed by a full-length album, ''[[Mimi Kajiru]],'' in 2002. The EP ''[[Kusoban]]'', released in 2004, featured heavy music mixed with light pop that has gained them mainstream attention. After the release of ''Kusoban'', the band signed to [[VAP (company)|VAP]], a major record label.<ref name="MTHhistory" />

The band released the full-length album ''[[Rokkinpo Goroshi]]'' in 2005 The release caused a surge in their fanbase, as they began to sell out more shows, playing many rock festivals, and eventually releasing a live DVD, ''[[Debu Vs. Debu]]''. In addition, "Rolling1000toon" was featured as an ending theme in the ''[[Air Master]]'' [[anime]], as well as being featured in ''DrumMania 10th Mix'' as a playable song. The song's title is actually a play on words. Combined, the number 1000 (pronounced "sen"), and "toon" (pronounced "ton") form the phrase "rolling senton". A [[senton]] is a leaping move, in pro wrestling, that often includes somersaults. The concept is illustrated at the end of the music video, when the protagonist (bassist Ue-chan) fells the bully character by leaping into the air, doing several mid-air flips, then landing the final blow.

In 2006 the band entered popular culture with the song "[[Koi no Mega Lover]]", which reached number nine on the [[Oricon]] charts during the summer – their first top-ten hit in Japan. The band had three of their songs featured in [[anime]] series: "What's Up, People?!" and "Zetsubō Billy" are featured as the second opening and ending themes of  ''[[Death Note]]'', and "Akagi" is featured as the ending theme for ''[[Akagi (manga)|Akagi]]''.

Maximum the Hormone released their next album, ''[[Bu-ikikaesu]]'', in 2007 The album debuted at number five on the Oricon chart; their first full album to reach that chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/release/d/698700/1/ |title=Bu-ikikaesu profile on Oricon charts |publisher=Oricon.co.jp |date=2008-06-20 |access-date=2011-10-20}}</ref> Also, the album was certified Gold in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/gold/200703.html |title=RIAJ |publisher=RIAJ |access-date=2011-10-20}}</ref>

===2008–2010: First and second hiatus===
[[File:Enter Shikari, DJ Pdex, Maximum the Hormone & An Albatross @ The Astoria 2.jpg|thumb|Maximum the Hormone performing in 2008]]
In 2008, the band released their second live DVD: ''[[Deco Vs. Deco]]'', and made their first overseas appearances with a short tour through the United States and Canada in support of [[Dropkick Murphys]]. On May 3, Maximum the Hormone performed at the [[hide (musician)|hide]] memorial summit alongside many other artists, in memory of the deceased musician.<ref>{{cite web| title = hide Memorial Summit Day 1 - Part B| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-4678-hide-memorial-summit-day-1-part-b.html| access-date = 2013-08-13}}</ref> A new single titled "[[Tsume Tsume Tsume/F]]" was released at the start of the ''Tsume Tsume Tsume'' tour in July, and reached the number two spot on the Oricon weekly singles chart. The tour continued through October 2008,<ref>{{cite web | title=''Tsume Tsume Tsume'' tour | work=55mth.com | url=http://www.55mth.com/08_sgtour.html}}</ref> with an additional show on November 30. The subject of the song "F" is ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' character, [[Frieza]].

On October 27, Maximum The Hormone made their first appearance in the United Kingdom, supporting [[Enter Shikari]] at the [[Bournemouth]] BIC. They continued to tour with Enter Shikari until November 3, playing venues in [[Exeter]], [[Southampton]] and [[Folkestone]], before ending with two nights at the [[London Astoria]]. However, prior to the Enter Shikari dates, it was announced that Daisuke would require corrective surgery on his throat, causing the band to go on temporary hiatus while he recovered. The hiatus started in December and lasted for several months. After Daisuke recovered from throat surgery the band went on to headline several shows in Japan with support from [[Bring Me the Horizon]] and [[Blessed by a Broken Heart]] in May 2009, as well as winning the award for Best Rock Video for "Tsume Tsume Tsume" in the 2009 [[MTV Video Music Awards Japan]].

In 2009, [[Megadeth]] guitarist [[Marty Friedman]] performed an instrumental cover of "Tsume Tsume Tsume" on his tribute/cover album ''[[Tokyo Jukebox]]''. Though not mentioned in the title, near the end of the track he segues into an abbreviated version of the song "Louisiana Bob." On November 19, 2009, the band released a statement via their official website stating that drummer Nao was pregnant, but after discussions with her bandmates and staff, Nao decided to continue with all shows. However, on November 3 Nao fell ill and was transported to the hospital, where she was told that it would be unhealthy for her and the baby to continue performing. This resulted in the band going on hiatus until Nao carried the baby to term, forcing them to cancel all shows including an appearance at the [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave Festival]] 2010 in Australia. On May 6, 2010, the band released a statement through their website stating that Nao gave birth to a healthy baby girl and that they would no longer be on hiatus. The band members appeared as [[Extra (actor)|extras]] in the live-action adaptation of ''[[Beck (manga)|BECK]]''.

===2011–2014: Return to activity and ''Yoshū Fukushū''===
On February 7, 2011, the band released a video for the songs "Chiisana Kimi no Te (小さな君の手)" (Your Little Hands)  and "Maximum the Hormone" on their official website. They released a single titled "[[Greatest the Hits 2011–2011]]" on March 23, debuting at number 1 spot on the Oricon weekly singles chart. In June of the same year, they toured Europe. In early August they played at Pentaport Rock Festival in Incheon, South Korea.

The album ''[[Yoshū Fukushū]]'' was released on July 31, 2013, their first full album in six years. It was their first album to reach number one on Oricon's charts.<ref>{{cite web|author=ustar |url=http://www.tokyohive.com/article/2013/08/oricon-weekly-charts-for-7-29-8-4 |title=Oricon Weekly Charts for 7/29 ~ 8/4 |publisher=tokyohive.com |date=2013-08-07 |access-date=2013-11-04}}</ref> The CD features unique packaging, as it is approximately the height and width of a standard DVD case, and bound like a manga. According to the band's official website, it is "A frantic 156-page book with 'Our Merciless Home'war'k' descriptions, a dialogue style track-by-track rundown for all 15 songs by Maximum the Ryo-kun, Ryo-kun's inner world is exposed by professional manga artists"<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumthehormone.jp/news.html |title=MAXIMUM THE HORMONE -Official English Website |language=ja |publisher=Maximumthehormone.jp |access-date=2013-11-05}}</ref>

On June 2, the group released the video for the song "A-L-I-E-N", but as a prank, they placed it on a randomly relocating URL, so page visitors would only have one chance of seeing the video. The video for the album's title track, "Yoshū Fukushū", was released on July 26, 2013.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The song "Benjo Sandal Dance" (Toilet Sandal Dance) had been used in a Stride gum commercial, featuring the band in full special effects makeup as early primates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaNLGLHyw7E |title=ホルモンCM初出演！｢ストライド｣CM |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-28 |access-date=2013-11-05}}</ref> In keeping with the band's quirky aesthetic, the song "Benjo Sandal Dance" lyrically references Maximum the Ryo-kun's habit of wearing [[Toilet slippers|toilet sandals]], traditionally strictly only for wearing in the bathroom, at all times. As referenced in the song's lyrics, as well as their FAQ, he exclusively wears toilet sandals sold under the brand name VIC, made by Nishibe Chemical Co. Ltd.

===2015–present: Third hiatus and signing with Warner Music Japan===
In November 2015, the band released their third live album, ''Deka vs. Deka''. The album also came with a complete re-recording of their 2002 album ''[[Mimi Kajiru]]'' as a bonus disc. The re-recording, entitled ''[[Mimi Kajiru Shinuchi]]'', was also released alongside a book containing [[sheet music]] for the songs on ''[[Yoshu Fukushu]]'', which was released in February 2016. The band was in the midst of another hiatus as drummer Nao announced her intention to try for another baby; her second child was born in May 2016. The band returned to activity in 2017, announcing the ''Mimi Kajiru Shinuchi'' Tour across Japan.

In September 2018, the band released a track entitled "Haikei VAP-dono" (with Daisuke playing drums), to announce their departure from [[VAP (company)|VAP]] to sign a new record deal with [[Warner Music Japan]].<ref>[https://aramajapan.com/news/musicvideo/maximum-the-hormone-publish-music-video-for-their-new-song-haikei-vap-dono/91409/ MAXIMUM THE HORMONE publish Music Video for their New Song “Haikei VAP-dono”] Arama Japan. 19 September 2018.

==Musical style==
Maximum the Hormone performs [[nu metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] but incorporates many elements of [[Pop music|pop]],<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/maximum-the-hormone-p875085/biography |title=Maximum the Hormone |author=Alexey Eremenko |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |access-date=14 March 2011}}</ref> [[Funk music|funk]], [[ska]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[extreme metal]] into their music as well. The band is also labeled as [[alternative metal]], [[funk metal]], [[groove metal]], and more recently [[metalcore]]<ref name=sputnik>[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Maximum-the-Hormone/8207/ ''Maximum the Hormone'' at Sputnik Music]</ref> by some critics. [[AllMusic]]'s Alexey Eremenko writes that Maximum the Hormone is distinguished by "a general lack of the teenage angst and self-importance characteristic of true nu-metalers." Their funky sound, heard in many songs such as "Maximum 21st Century", is mostly produced by bass player Ue-Chan's unconventional use of the slapping technique; he is often referred to as "The Chopper" by the band (both in their FAQ, and their song "A-L-I-E-N").<ref name="mth1"/> Lead vocals are split between Daisuke, Ryo, and Nao, with Ryo and Nao providing the melodic vocals while Daisuke provides the screams and rapping. Ue-Chan is yet to perform lead vocals (aside from a verse on the joke track "Chiisana Kimi no Te") but does perform backing vocals alongside the rest of the band.

Their music videos often have a tongue-in-cheek aspect as well, such as "Rolling1000t00n", which features an underdog (with the requisite karate training montage) facing up to a bully, or "Koi no Mega Lover", which features an awkward young man whose clumsy amorous advances are rejected by a beautiful girl at a party.
