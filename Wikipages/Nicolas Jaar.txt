==Biography==
Jaar was born in New York to Chilean artist and architect [[Alfredo Jaar]] and mother Evelyne Meynard. On his father's side, Jaar has Palestinian ancestry: the surname Jaar originates in [[Bethlehem]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Faber |first1=Tom |title=Create your own reality: The Palestinian scene |url=https://ra.co/features/3231 |website=[[Resident Advisor]] |access-date=5 January 2021}}</ref> "Jaar ascribes the melancholy in his music to the time when he moved at the age of 2 with his mother from New York to Chile."<ref>{{Citation | last =Rubin | first =Mike | title =Between Semesters, Digital Innovation | work = The New York Times | date = March 9, 2012 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/arts/music/nicolas-jaar-electronic-musician-and-student-at-brown.html | access-date = April 21, 2015}}</ref> In 2007, he met [[Gadi Mizrahi]] and [[Zev Eisenberg]] who ran the legendary Marcy parties in Brooklyn, New York. After hearing his early works, Mizrahi suggested 17 year-old Jaar put a 4/4 kick drum underneath his largely experimental compositions. This was Jaar's first foray into dance music, documented in his first release on Mizrahi's label [[Wolf & Lamb]], entitled ''The Student''. "Back then, Mizrahi says, everything D.J.'s were playing was 128 beats per minute. The stuff he was doing was almost half that speed."<ref>{{Citation| last =Ferguson | first =WM | title =Nicolas Jaar Tests the Limits of Dance Music | work =[[The New York Times]] | date =October 11, 2013 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/magazine/nicolas-jaar-tests-the-limits-of-dance-music.html | access-date = April 21, 2015}}</ref>

Jaar spent four years in the NY underground dance scene, crafting rough, hip hop influenced house music (like early singles ''Love You Gotta Lose Again'' and ''Don't Believe the Hype''). During this time, Jaar made two songs where he sang in his native Spanish ("Mi Mujer" and "El Bandido"). Jaar did not intend for them to come out as they were made as jokes to make his mother laugh and dance. He changed his mind in 2010, as he felt the songs were his way of answering what he deemed as exploitative sampling of Latin American culture by non-Latin DJs.

He released his debut album, ''[[Space Is Only Noise]]'', in January 2011 to critical acclaim<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise/ |title=Album Reviews: Nicolas Jaar: Space Is Only Noise |website=Pitchfork |date=February 17, 2011 |access-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref> and four stars from ''The Guardian''.<ref name = Guardian>{{cite news|author=Tony Naylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/12/nicolas-jaar-electronic-music-renaissance-man |title=Nicolas Jaar is the renaissance man of electronic music &#124; Music |newspaper=The Guardian |date= March 12, 2011|access-date=May 9, 2011 |location=London}}</ref> It was ranked #1 album of the year by ''Resident Advisor'', ''Mixmag'', and ''Crack Mag''. Jaar toured the album for three years with guitarist [[Dave Harrington (musician)|Dave Harrington]] (later of Darkside) and keyboardist Will Epstein. Jaar was voted #1 Live Act on Resident Advisor for the three years he toured the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1969 |title=RA Poll: Top 20 live acts of 2013 |publisher=Resident Advisor |date=December 11, 2013 |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, he debuted a live concept called ''From Scratch'', where, in front of a live audience, he sampled records he had bought that day. The first iteration happened in Queens, New York at MOMA PS1; it was a five-hour concert with collaboration from [[Will Epstein]], videographer [[Ryan Staake]], dancer [[Lizzie Feidelson]] and singer [[Sasha Spielberg]]. Jaar has also performed From Scratch in Boulder, Colorado, and Montréal, Quebec.

On May 18, 2012 Nicolas Jaar made his BBC Radio 1 [[Essential Mix]] debut,<ref>{{Cite news |title= Nicolas Jaar's BBC Essential Mix |author= Ravens, Chal |author2= Gregorsky, Mikael (photographer) |url= https://www.dummymag.com/mix/nicolas-jaar-s-bbc-essential-mix/ |work= Dummy Mag |date= May 21, 2012 |access-date= May 23, 2012}}</ref> which was voted Radio 1's Essential Mix Of The Year of 2012.<ref>{{Cite web| title = BBC iPlayer – BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix: Radio 1's Essential Mix Of The Year 2012.

On October 4, 2013, the debut album from Darkside, Jaar's project with longtime collaborator Dave Harrington, was released to critical acclaim and a 9.0 score on ''Pitchfork''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18586-darkside-psychic/ |title=Album Reviews: DARKSIDE – Psychic |website=Pitchfork |date=October 7, 2013 |access-date=July 10, 2013}}</ref> The band toured the record for the entirety of 2014.<ref name="Electronicbeats.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/its-as-if-the-plants-are-speaking-or-even-singing-to-you-daniel-pinchbeck-talks-to-darksides-nicolas-jaar-and-dave-harrington/ | title=Daniel Pinchbeck talks to Darkside's Nicolas Jaar and Dave Harrington | date=January 13, 2014 | publisher=Electronic Beats}}</ref>

In February 2015, Jaar released an ambient and noise record entitled [[Pomegranates (album)|''Pomegranates'']], which was described as sounding "like broken Middle Eastern instruments half-playing a modal melody amid bursts of hiss"<ref name=Pitchfork3>Mark Richardson, [http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20791-pomegranates/ ''Pomegranates'' review] [[Pitchfork Media]], July 8, 2015.

Retrieved December 23, 2015.</ref> Later that year, Jaar scored the soundtrack to ''Dheepan'', a thriller by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard about a family of Sri Lankan refugees living in the suburbs of Paris. It was the winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes 2015.<ref name="Nytimes.com"/>

His second studio album, ''[[Sirens (Nicolas Jaar album)|Sirens]]'', was released in September 2016. [[Rolling Stone]] named it the #1 Electronic Album of the year.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Christopher R. Weingarten,David Turner,Andy Beta,Andy Battaglia,Arielle Castillo,Nick|last1=Murray|first2=Rolling|last2=Stone|access-date=2020-07-29|title=20 Best EDM and Electronic Albums of 2016|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-best-edm-and-electronic-albums-of-2016-192520/|date=16 December 2016}}</ref> A deluxe version was released in December 2017, containing three new tracks interspersed throughout the album.

At some stage in 2018 Jaar added an [[acute accent]] over the letter a in his first name, in order to emphasise the last syllable. Nicolas became Nicolás.

Jaar co-produced most of [[FKA Twigs]]'s second studio album, ''[[Magdalene (album)|Magdalene]]'', released in October 2019.

In 2020, Jaar released three albums; ''2017-2019'' in February (under his Against All Logic alias), ''Cenizas'' in March, and ''Telas'' in July.

Seven years after the debut album of his duo formation ''Darkside'' the second studio album ''[[Spiral (Darkside album)|Spiral]]'' was released in July 2021 via [[Matador Records]]. It got generally favourable reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-07-24 |title= Spiral by Darkside Matador Release Date: Jul 23, 2021 |url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/spiral/darkside |access-date=2021-07-27 |website=metacritic.com/}}</ref>

===''Other People''===
Jaar founded New York-based imprint [[Other People (record label)|Other People]]. It has published music from [[Lydia Lunch]], John Wall, Pierre Bastien, Tomaga, [[DJ Slugo]], [[William Basinski]], [[VTGNIKE]], [[Lucretia Dalt]], Nikita Quasim, [[12z]], Sary Moussa and Terepa collective which consisted of [[Kouhei Matsunaga]], [[Laurel Halo]], [[Lucrecia Dalt]], [[Rashad Becker]], Charlotte Collin, Grégoire Simon and [[Julia Holter]].

In 2016, Other People launched THE NETWORK, a web of 111 fictional radio stations done in collaboration with visual artists Jena Myung and Maziyar Pahlevan.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/08/30/nicolas-jaar-online-radio-network-other-people|title=Music:Nicolas Jaar Announces Mysterious Online Radio Network|date=August 30, 2013|magazine=The Fader|access-date=November 14, 2017}}</ref> In 2017, THE NETWORK became a book, published by [[PRINTED MATTER]] in NY.
