'''William Stanley Milligan''' (February 14, 1955 – December 12, 2014) also known as The Campus Rapist, was an American who was the subject of a highly publicized court case in [[Ohio]] in the late 1970s. After having committed several [[felony|felonies]] including [[armed robbery]], he was arrested for three [[rape]]s on the campus of [[Ohio State University]]. In the course of preparing his defense, [[psychologist]]s diagnosed Milligan with multiple personality disorder (later reclassified as [[dissociative identity disorder]]). His lawyers pleaded [[insanity defense|insanity]], claiming that two of his alternate personalities committed the crimes without Milligan being aware of it. He was the first person diagnosed with multiple personality disorder to raise such a defense,<ref name=CD2007-10-28/> and the first acquitted of a major crime for this reason, instead spending a decade in mental hospitals.

Milligan's life story was popularized by [[Daniel Keyes]]'s award-winning [[non-fiction novel]] ''[[The Minds of Billy Milligan]]''.<ref name=languages-Minds>{{As of|2014|August}}, ''The Minds of Billy Milligan'' is available in at least in fourteen languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish.</ref>

==Early life==

Milligan was born on February 14, 1955, in [[Miami Beach]], to Dorothy Pauline Sands and Johnny Morrison.

Dorothy grew up in [[Ohio]] farm country and lived in [[Lancaster, Ohio|Lancaster]] with her first husband. They divorced, and Dorothy eventually moved to the [[Miami]] area, where she worked as a singer. There she began living with Johnny Morrison. Dorothy and Morrison had two other children: a son, Jim, in October 1953, and a daughter, Kathy Jo, born in December 1956.

Morrison struggled with fatherhood, and according to [[Daniel Keyes]], "Meeting the medical expenses overwhelmed Johnny. He borrowed more, gambled more, drank more... [He] was hospitalized for acute [[alcoholism]] and [[clinical depression|depression]] in ... 1958." In what appeared to be a [[suicide attempt]], according to Keyes, "[Dorothy] found him slumped over the table, half a bottle of [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] and an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the floor." A few months after this attempt, on January 17, 1959, Johnny died by suicide from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].<ref>[[Daniel Keyes|Keyes, Daniel]] (1981). ''The Minds of Billy Milligan'', Random House, p. 131-135. {{ISBN|0-394-51943-4}}</ref>

Dorothy took her children and moved away from Miami, eventually returning to Lancaster, Ohio, where she remarried her ex-husband. This marriage lasted about a year. In 1962, she met Chalmer Milligan (1927–1988).<ref>''Ohio Death Index'': "Chalmer J Milligan b est 1927, resident of Lancaster, Fairfield County, Ohio, died 14 Dec 1988 in Fairfield County"</ref> Chalmer's first wife Bernice divorced him on the "grounds of gross neglect".<ref>''Lancaster Eagle Gazette'', June 21, 1962. Article states, "[...] they wed July 23, 1957."</ref> He had a daughter, Challa, the same age as Billy, and another daughter who was a nurse. Dorothy and Chalmer married in Circleville, Ohio, on October 27, 1963.<ref>Keyes, p. 135-139</ref>

At his later trial, Chalmer was blamed for [[child abuse|abusing]] Billy. Keyes claimed that Billy had multiple personalities from a much earlier age, however, with his first three (no-name boy, Christene, and Shawn) appearing by the time he was five years old.

==Arrest==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
In 1975, Milligan was imprisoned at [[Lebanon Correctional Institution]] in Ohio for rape and armed robbery. He was released on parole in early 1977. In October 1977, Milligan was arrested for raping three women on the [[Ohio State University]] campus. He was identified by one of his victims from existing police mug shots of sex offenders, and from fingerprints lifted from another victim's car.

Since he used a gun during the crime and guns were found in a search of his residence, he had violated his parole as well. He was [[indictment|indicted]] on "three counts of [[kidnapping]], three counts of aggravated robbery and four counts of rape." He was placed in the Ohio State Penitentiary pending trial.

In the course of preparing his defense, he underwent a [[psychological examination]] by Dr. Willis C. Driscoll, who diagnosed Milligan with acute [[schizophrenia]]. He was then examined by psychologist Dorothy Turner of Southwest Community Mental Health Center in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. During this examination, Turner concluded that Milligan suffered from dissociative identity disorder. Milligan's public defenders, Gary Schweickart and Judy Stevenson, pleaded an [[insanity defense]], and he was committed "until such time as he regains [[sanity]]".

==Incarceration==
Milligan was sent to a series of state-run [[mental hospital]]s, such as the [[Athens State Hospital]], where, by his report, he received very little help. While he was in these hospitals, Milligan reported having ten different personalities. These ten were the only ones known to psychologists. Later on an additional 14 personalities, labeled "The Undesirables", were discovered. Among the first ten were Arthur, a prim and proper [[English people|Englishman]] who was an expert in [[science]], [[medicine]] and [[hematology]]; Allen, a manipulator; Tommy, an [[escape artist]] and [[technophile]]; Ragen Vadascovinich, a [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] [[communist]] who Milligan claimed had committed the robberies in a kind of [[Robin Hood]] spirit; and Adalana, a 19-year-old [[lesbian]] (shy, lonely and introverted) who cooked for all the personalities and craved affection, and who had allegedly committed the rapes.<ref>Keyes, p. 54</ref>

Milligan received treatment from psychiatrist David Caul MD, who diagnosed the additional 14 personalities.

==Release==
Milligan was released in 1988 after a decade in mental hospitals, and discharged from the Ohio mental health system and the Ohio courts on August 1, 1991. In 1996 he lived in [[California]] where he owned Stormy Life Productions and was going to make a short film (which apparently was never made). His location thereafter remained for a long time unknown, his former acquaintances having lost contact with him.<ref name=CD2007-10-28>[http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2007/10/28/BILLY.ART_ART_10-28-07_A1_EV89AGB.html "30 years later, multiple-personality case still fascinates"], ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'', 28 October 2007</ref>

He was 59.<ref>[http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/12/16/1216-billy-milligan-dies.html Billy Milligan | 1955-2014: Man with famous insanity plea dies], ''The Columbus Dispatch'', retrieved December 17, 2014</ref>{{404|date=October 2021}}

==In media==
===Books===
[[Daniel Keyes]] authored a biographical [[non-fiction novel]] called ''[[The Minds of Billy Milligan]]'' (1981). His follow-up book, ''The Milligan Wars'', was published in [[Japan]] in 1994, in [[Taiwan]] in 2000, in [[France]] in 2009, in [[Ukraine]] in 2018, but not in the United States, first owing to Milligan's ongoing lawsuit against the State of Ohio for the allegedly inadequate treatment he received in Ohio facilities, then to the desire to tie its release to an in-development film.

===Film===
Several attempts had been made by Hollywood to adapt Keyes' book. In the early 1990s, [[James Cameron]] co-wrote a screenplay with [[Todd Graff]] for a film version he was to direct then-titled ''A<!--"A" then--> Crowded Room''. This adaptation never came into fruition because Cameron was sued by adaptation rightsholder Sandy Arcara, demanding "her salary should be raised from $250,000 to $1.5 million";<ref>Brennan, David (2010). :)[http://www.jamescamerononline.com/CrowdedRoom.htm "A Crowded Room: The Abandoned Project"] (Summary & Analysis of the Un-produced James Cameron Project, "A Crowded Room"), JamesCameronOnline.com</ref>{{better source|date=September 2021}} seeing the project stalled, Milligan also sued Cameron in 1993.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Cameron, partner sued over 'Minds' |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-02-1993-7 |journal=Variety |publisher=Variety |date=1993-08-02 |access-date=2014-05-27 }}</ref> 

After Cameron left the project, [[Warner Bros.]] continued to develop it now slightly retitled ''The<!--"The" now--> Crowded Room'', with directors [[Joel Schumacher]] and [[David Fincher]] attached at various points. Actors courted for the role of Milligan included [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Sean Penn]] and [[John Cusack]].{{cn|date=September 2021}} In February 2015 it was confirmed that [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] would star as Milligan, with [[Jason Smilovic]] set to pen the script.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Leonardo DiCaprio, New Regency Moving Ahead With 'The Crowded Room later on the movie Split Was released as the year ' (Exclusive)|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leonardo-dicaprio-new-regency-moving-778284|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = 2015-10-15}}</ref> In 2021, it was announced that ''The Crowded Room'' would instead be adapted as a ten-episode television series, starring [[Tom Holland]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goldberg |first1=Lesley |title=Tom Holland to Star in Apple Mental Illness Anthology From Akiva Goldsman |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tom-holland-to-star-in-apple-mental-illness-anthology-from-akiva-goldsman |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=8 April 2021}}</ref>

===Television===
In 2021, Netflix released a four-part documentary entitled "[[Monsters Inside: The 24 Faces of Billy Milligan]]." The series was directed by [[Olivier Megaton]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-24|title=Netflix Shares Trailer of True Crime Docuseries 'Monsters Inside: The 24 Faces of Billy Milligan'|url=https://hypebeast.com/2021/8/netflix-monsters-inside-the-24-faces-of-billy-milligan-documentary-trailer-release-info|access-date=2021-09-20|website=HYPEBEAST}}</ref>
