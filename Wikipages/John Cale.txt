'''John Davies Cale''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 9 March 1942) is a Welsh musician, composer, singer, songwriter and record producer who was a founding member of the American rock band [[the Velvet Underground]]. Over his six-decade career, Cale has worked in various styles across [[rock music|rock]], [[drone music|drone]], [[classical music|classical]], [[avant-garde]] and [[electronic music]].<ref name="Guardianmb">{{cite web|last1=Beaumont|first1=Mark|title=John Cale and Liam Young review – Cale's drones outshine Young's flying bots in sinister vision of the future|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/14/john-cale-liam-young-cale-drone-bot-sinister-future|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 September 2014|access-date=30 July 2016}}</ref>

He studied music at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]], [[University of London]], before relocating in 1963 to [[New York City]]'s [[downtown music]] scene, where he performed as part of the [[Theatre of Eternal Music]] and formed the Velvet Underground. Since leaving the band in 1968, Cale has released 16 solo [[Album#Studio|studio albums]], including the widely acclaimed ''[[Paris 1919 (album)|Paris 1919]]'' and ''[[Music for a New Society]]''. Cale has also acquired a reputation as an adventurous producer, working on the debut albums of several innovative artists, including [[the Stooges]] and [[Patti Smith]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/169729239/john-cale-the-return-of-an-underground-icon|title=John Cale: The Return of an Underground Icon|work=NPR.org|access-date=16 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
John Davies Cale was born on 9 March 1942 in [[Garnant]] in the industrial [[River Amman|Amman Valley]] of Wales to Will Cale, a [[Coal mining|coal miner]], and Margaret Davies, a [[primary school]] teacher.<ref name="sed24">Mitchell, Tim ''Sedition and Alchemy: A Biography of John Cale'', 2003, p. 24</ref> Although his father spoke only English, his mother spoke and taught [[Welsh language|Welsh]] to Cale, which hindered his relationship with his father,<ref name="sed24"/> although he began learning English at primary school, at around the age of seven.<ref name="sed24"/> Cale was [[Child sexual abuse|molested]] by two different men during his youth: an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest who molested him in a church and a music teacher.<ref name="sed24"/><ref name="basement">[http://www.markmordue.com/2010/02/cold-black-style-john-cale-interview.html Cold, Black Style: The John Cale Interview], markmordue.com; accessed 3 January 2018. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101121123/http://www.markmordue.com/2010/02/cold-black-style-john-cale-interview.html# |date=1 January 2011 }}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/john-cale-being-homeless-nearly-11393446|title=John Cale on why Bowie's death made him never want to give up|first=Nathan|last=Bevan|date=28 May 2016|website=walesonline|access-date=12 March 2019}}</ref> He played organ at Ammanford church. The BBC recorded Cale playing a toccata he composed primarily on the black keys of the piano in the style of [[Aram Khachaturian]]. His mother was institutionalized for breast cancer when he was 11.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00936tc|title=BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, John Cale}}</ref>

Having discovered a talent for [[viola]], Cale joined the National Youth Orchestra of Wales at age 13.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Cale|first=John|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43468904|title=What's Welsh for Zen : the autobiography of John Cale|date=2000|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]|others=Victor Bockris|isbn=1-58234-068-4|edition=1st U.S.|location=New York|pages=|oclc=43468904}}</ref> Receiving a scholarship, Cale studied music at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]], [[University of London]].<ref name=":0" /> While he was there he organised an early [[Fluxus]] concert, ''A Little Festival of New Music'', on 6 July 1964. He also contributed to the short film ''Police Car'' and had two scores published in ''Fluxus Preview Review'' (July 1963) for the nascent avant-garde collective. He conducted the first performance in the UK of Cage's ''Concert for Piano and Orchestra'', with the composer and pianist [[Michael Garrett (composer)|Michael Garrett]] as soloist. In 1963, he travelled to the United States to continue his musical training with the assistance and influence of [[Aaron Copland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/newyork/music/john-cale-2|title=John Cale interview|website=Time Out New York|language=en|access-date=22 May 2018}}</ref>

Upon arriving in [[New York City]], Cale met a number of influential composers. On 9 September 1963 he participated, along with [[John Cage]] and several others, in an 18-hour and 40 minute piano-playing marathon that was the first full-length performance of [[Erik Satie]]'s "[[Vexations#First public performance|Vexations]]". After the performance Cale appeared on the television panel show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. Cale's secret was that he had performed in an 18-hour concert, and he was accompanied by Karl Schenzer, whose secret was that he was the only member of the audience who had stayed for the duration.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{YouTube|TYHIqMmtS-0|John Cale on ''I've Got a Secret''}}</ref>{{better source needed|reason=isn't this a copyright violation?|date=November 2019}} Cale would later attribute Cage's writings with his own "relaxed" artistic outlook, having hitherto been raised to believe that European composers were obliged to justify their work.

Cale also played in [[La Monte Young]]'s ensemble the [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], also known as the Dream Syndicate (not to be confused with the [[The Dream Syndicate|1980s band of the same name]]). The heavily [[drone music|drone-laden]] music he played there proved to be a big influence in his work with his next band, the Velvet Underground. One of his collaborators on these recordings was the Velvet Underground guitarist [[Sterling Morrison]]. Three albums of his early experimental work from this period were released in 2001.

Despite his background in art music and the avant-garde, Cale had enjoyed and followed rock music from a young age; on a visit to Britain in 1965, he procured records by [[the Kinks]], [[the Who]] and [[Small Faces]] that remained unavailable in the United States.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99VPNgEz81QC&pg=PA53|title=White Light/White Heat: The Velvet Underground Day by Day|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|date=1 June 2009|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=9781906002220}}</ref>

Early that year, he co-founded [[the Velvet Underground]] with [[Lou Reed]], recruiting his flatmate [[Angus MacLise]] and Reed's college friend [[Sterling Morrison]] to complete the initial line-up. Just before the band's first paying gig for $75 at [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]] in [[New Jersey]], MacLise abruptly quit the band because he viewed accepting money for art as [[selling out]]; he was replaced by [[Maureen Tucker]] as the band's drummer.<ref>{{cite web

On his aforementioned visit to Britain in the summer of 1965, Cale shopped a crudely recorded, acoustic-based Velvet Underground demo reel to several luminaries in the British rock scene (including [[Marianne Faithfull]]) with the intention of securing a record deal.<ref name=":0" /> Although this failed to manifest, the tape was disseminated throughout the [[UK underground]] over the following eighteen months by such figures as producer [[Joe Boyd]] and [[Mick Farren]] of [[The Deviants (band)|the Deviants]]. As a result, the Deviants, [[the Yardbirds]] and [[David Bowie]] had all covered Velvet Underground songs prior to the release of their debut album in 1967.<ref name="auto"/>

The very first commercially available recording of the Velvet Underground, an instrumental track called "Loop" given away with ''[[Aspen (magazine)|Aspen Magazine]]'', was a feedback experiment written and conducted by Cale. His creative relationship with Reed was integral to the sound of the Velvet Underground's first two albums, ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'' (recorded in 1966, released in 1967) and ''[[White Light/White Heat]]'' (recorded in 1967, released in 1968).<ref name=":0" /> On these albums he plays [[viola]], [[bass guitar]] and [[piano]], and sings occasional [[backing vocals]]. ''White Light/White Heat'' also features Cale on [[organ (music)|organ]] (on "[[Sister Ray]]") as well as two vocal turns: "[[Lady Godiva's Operation]]", an experimental song where he shares lead vocal duties with Reed, and "[[The Gift (The Velvet Underground song)|The Gift]]", a long [[spoken word]] piece written by Reed written during his time at Syracuse University.<ref name=":0" /> Though Cale co-wrote the music to several songs, his most distinctive contribution is the electrically-amplified viola. He also played [[celesta]] on "[[Sunday Morning (The Velvet Underground song)|Sunday Morning]]". Cale also played on [[Nico]]'s 1967 debut album, ''[[Chelsea Girl (album)|Chelsea Girl]]'', which includes songs co-written by Velvet Underground members Cale, Reed and Morrison, who also appear as musicians.<ref name=":0" /> Cale makes his debut as lyricist on "Winter Song" "Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams", and "Little Sister".<ref name=":0" />

Apart from appearing on the Velvet Underground's first two albums, he also played organ<ref>Fricke, David. Liner notes to the ''Loaded: Fully Loaded Edition'' CD, 1997</ref> on the track "Ocean" during the practice sessions to produce demos for the band's fourth album ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]'', nearly two years after he left the band.<ref name=":0" /> He was enticed back into the studio by the band's manager, [[Steve Sesnick]], "in a half-hearted attempt to reunite old comrades", as Cale put it.<ref>Fricke, David. Liner notes to the ''[[Peel Slowly and See]]'' [[box set]], 1995</ref> Although he does not appear on the finished album, the demo recording of "Ocean" was included in the 1997 ''Loaded: Fully Loaded Edition'' CD re-issue. Finally, five previously unreleased tracks recorded in late 1967 and early 1968 were included on the albums ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' (1985) and ''[[Another View]]'' (1986).

With tensions between Reed and Cale growing, Reed gave an ultimatum to Morrison and Tucker, declaring that unless Cale was fired, he would quit the band. Morrison and Tucker reluctantly went along with the scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-velvet-underground-mn0000840402/biography|title=The Velvet Underground – Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=3 January 2018}}</ref>

In September 1968, Cale played his final gig with the Velvet Underground at the [[Boston Tea Party (concert venue)|Boston Tea Party]] and according to Tucker, "When John left, it was really sad. I felt really bad. And of course, this was gonna really influence the music, 'cause, John's a lunatic (laughs). I think we became a little more normal, which was fine, it was good music, good songs, it was never the same though. It was good stuff, a lot of good songs, but, just, the lunacy factor was... gone."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://werksman.home.xs4all.nl/cale/bio/1968.html|title=Timeline John Cale – 1968|publisher=werksman.home.xs4all.nl|access-date=3 January 2018}}</ref> After his dismissal from the band, Cale was replaced by [[Boston]]-based musician [[Doug Yule]], who played bass guitar, keyboards and who would soon share lead vocal duties in the band with Reed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/doug-yule-mn0000167684/biography|title=Doug Yule – Biography & History|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=3 January 2018}}</ref>

Michael Carlucci, who was friends with [[Robert Quine]], has given this explanation about Cale's dismissal, "Lou told Quine that the reason why he had to get rid of Cale in the band was Cale's ideas were just too out there. Cale had some wacky ideas. He wanted to record the next album with the amplifiers underwater, and [Lou] just couldn't have it. He was trying to make the band more accessible."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/vumyth.html|title=vumyth|access-date=3 January 2018|publisher=richieunterberger.com}}</ref>

Arguably, the artistic frictions between Cale and Reed are what shaped the band's early sound much more than any other members. The pair often had heated disagreements about the direction of the band, and this tension was central to their later collaborations. When Cale left, he seemed to take the more experimental tendencies with him, as is noticeable in comparing the proto-[[noise rock]] of ''White Light/White Heat'' (which Cale co-created) to the comparatively dulcet, [[folk rock]]–influenced ''[[The Velvet Underground (album)|The Velvet Underground]]'', recorded after his departure.

Cale would later compare the dissonance he used in his VU compositions with the indecipherable lyricism of some contemporary southern US rap music: "If I can use out-of-tune stuff, [rappers] don't need words to make sense. There's definitely a lineage".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/arts/music/velvet-underground-experience-john-cale.html|title=A Walk Through Velvet Underground History With John Cale|last=Chow|first=Andrew R.|date=11 October 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=19 July 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Solo career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}

===1970s===
After leaving the Velvet Underground, Cale worked as a record producer and arranger on a number of albums, most notably [[the Stooges]]' highly influential 1969 [[The Stooges (album)|self-titled debut]] and a trilogy by [[Nico]], including ''[[The Marble Index]]'' (1969), ''[[Desertshore]]'' (1970) and ''[[The End...]]'' (1974).<ref name=":0" /> On these he accompanied Nico's voice and [[Pump organ|harmonium]] using a wide array of instruments to unusual effect. While meeting with Joe Boyd (who co-produced ''Desertshore''), he came across [[Nick Drake]]'s music and insisted on collaborating with the fledgling artist. He appeared on Drake's second album, ''[[Bryter Layter]]'', playing viola and [[harpsichord]] on "Fly" and piano, organ, and celesta on "[[Northern Sky]]".

In addition to working as a producer, Cale initiated a solo recording career in early 1970. His first studio album, ''[[Vintage Violence]]'', is a lushly-produced [[roots rock]] effort indebted to a range of disparate influences, including [[the Band]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[the Byrds]], [[Phil Spector]] and [[Brian Wilson]].<ref name=":0" /> The more experimental ''[[Church of Anthrax]]'' (a collaboration with [[minimal music]] pioneer [[Terry Riley]]) followed in February 1971, although it was actually recorded nearly a year prior to its release.<ref name=":0" /> While his explorations in art music briefly continued with 1972's ''[[The Academy in Peril]]'', he would not compose in the classical mode thereafter until he began working on film soundtracks in the 1980s.

In 1972, he signed with au courant [[Reprise Records]] as a recording artist and staff producer. ''The Academy in Peril'' was his first project for Reprise. The subsequent ''[[Paris 1919 (album)|Paris 1919]]'' (1973) steered back towards the singer-songwriter mode of ''Vintage Violence'' with a backing band that included [[Lowell George]] of [[Little Feat]] and [[Wilton Felder]] of [[The Crusaders (Houston group)|the Crusaders]], as well as the UCLA Symphony Orchestra.<ref name=":0" /> Composed of highly melodic songs with arcane and complex lyrics, it has been cited by critics as one of his best.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/paris-1919-mw0000100610|title=Paris 1919 – John Cale – Songs, Reviews, Credits – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>

While affiliated with the label, he produced albums by [[Jennifer Warnes]] (her third, ''[[Jennifer (album)|Jennifer]]''), Chunky, Novi & Ernie, and the [[The Modern Lovers (album)|self-titled debut]] of [[the Modern Lovers]], which Reprise chose not to release; it subsequently appeared on [[Beserkley Records]], the latest in a series of important Cale-produced [[proto-punk]] records. In 1974 he joined [[Island Records]], working on albums with a variety of artists, including [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]], [[Patti Smith]] and [[Sham 69]]. He worked as a talent scout with Island's [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] department.

====1974–1979====
[[File:John Cale 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cale performing live in [[Toronto]], Canada, 1977]]In 1974, Cale moved back to [[London]].<ref name=":0" /> As his second marriage began to dissolve, he made a series of solo albums which moved in a new direction.<ref name=":0" /> His records now featured a dark and threatening aura, often carrying a sense of barely suppressed aggression. A trilogy of albums – ''[[Fear (John Cale album)|Fear]]'' (1974), ''[[Slow Dazzle (album)|Slow Dazzle]]'' (1975), and ''[[Helen of Troy (album)|Helen of Troy]]'' (1975) – were rapidly recorded and released over the course of about a year with other Island artists, including [[Phil Manzanera]] and [[Brian Eno]] of [[Roxy Music]] and [[Chris Spedding]], who played in his live band. A showpiece of his concerts from the era was his radically transformed cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Heartbreak Hotel]],"<ref name=":0" /> initially performed by Cale on ''Slow Dazzle'' and the live album ''1 June 1974'', recorded with [[Kevin Ayers]], Nico and Eno. Both "Leaving It Up to You" and "Fear Is a Man's Best Friend" (from ''Fear'') begin as relatively conventional songs that gradually grow more paranoid in tone before breaking down into what critic Dave Thompson calls "a morass of discordance and screaming".<ref name=":0" /><ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/fear-is-a-mans-best-friend-mt0003805909|title=Fear Is a Man's Best Friend – John Cale – Song Info – AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>

Cale released ''[[Animal Justice]]'' in 1977, an [[Extended play|EP]] notable particularly for the epic "Hedda Gabler", based very loosely on the [[Hedda Gabler|Ibsen play]]. His loud, abrasive and confrontational live performances fitted well with the [[punk rock]] scene developing on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Cale took to wearing a [[goaltender mask|hockey goaltender mask]] onstage (as evinced by the cover of ''[[Guts (John Cale album)|Guts]]'' (1977),<ref name=":0" /> a compilation drawn from the Island trilogy after the label withheld ''Helen of Troy'' in the United States); this look predated the creation of [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'']]'s villain, [[Jason Voorhees]], by several years. During one concert in [[Croydon]], [[south London]], Cale chopped the head off a dead chicken with a meat cleaver, leading his band to walk offstage in protest.<ref name=":0" /> Cale's drummer – a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] – was so bothered he quit the band.<ref name=":0" /> Cale mocks his decision on "Chicken Shit" from the ''Animal Justice'' EP. Cale has admitted that some of his paranoia and erratic behaviour at this time was associated with heavy [[cocaine]] use.<ref name="sed">Mitchell, Tim ''Sedition and Alchemy : A Biography of John Cale'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-7206-1132-6}}</ref>

In 1979, he began a relationship with [[Austin, Texas]]-based [[groupie]]/journalist [[Margaret Moser]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13406786/|title=They Used to Play Rocking Roles|last=Goldberg|first=Stephanie|date=16 October 2002|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=28 August 2017|page=7C|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Cale named the group of women that Moser hung out with the Texas Blondes.<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/06/22/533785361/margaret-moser-queen-of-austin-is-dancing-in-the-light|title=Margaret Moser, Queen of Austin, Is Dancing in the Light|last=Patoski|first=Joe Nick|date=22 June 2017|work=NPR.org|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=":32">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13406651|title=They Used to Play Rockin' Roles|last=Goldberg|first=Stephanie|date=16 October 2002|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=28 August 2017|page=1C|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> His relationship with Moser lasted about five years, overlapping with the beginning of his third marriage.<ref name=":12"/><ref name=":32"/>

In December 1979, Cale's embrace of the punk rock ethic that he helped to inspire culminated in the release of ''[[Sabotage/Live]]''. This record, recorded live over three nights, at [[CBGB]] that June, features aggressive vocal and instrumental performances.<ref name=":0" /> The album consists entirely of new songs, many of which grapple confrontationally with global politics, militarism and paranoia.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

The band included Deerfrance on vocals and percussion.<ref name=":0" /> An earlier live set, consisting mostly of new material, was recorded at CBGB the previous year. It was released in 1987 as ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (John Cale album)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]''. The band on that recording includes [[Ivan Kral]] (best known for his work with Patti Smith) on bass and longtime Brian Eno associate [[Judy Nylon]] on vocals.

===1980s===
[[File:John Cale 1980.jpg|thumb|right|Cale performing live in [[Toronto]], Canada, 1980]]
In 1980, Cale signed with [[A&M Records]] and moved in a more commercial direction with the album ''[[Honi Soit (album)|Honi Soit]]''.<ref name=":0" /> He worked with producer [[Mike Thorne]] towards this end.<ref>Thorne, Michael. [http://www.stereosociety.com/honisoit.html The making of John Cale's Honi Soit album] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711130825/http://www.stereosociety.com/honisoit.html |date=11 July 2007 }}, stereosociety.com; accessed 3 January 2018.</ref> [[Andy Warhol]] provided the cover art, in black and white, but against Warhol's wishes, Cale colourised it.<ref name=":0" /> The new direction did not succeed commercially, however, and his relationship with A&M ended.<ref name=":0" /> He signed with [[ZE Records]], a company he had influenced the creation of and which had absorbed [[SPY Records]],<ref name=":0" /> the label he had co-founded with Jane Friedman. In 1982, Cale released the sparse ''[[Music for a New Society]]''.<ref name=":0" /> Seeming to blend the refined music of his early solo work with the threatening music that came later, it is by any standard a bleak, harrowing record. It's been called "understated, and perhaps a masterpiece."<ref name="allmusic.com"/>

He followed up with the album ''[[Caribbean Sunset]]'', also on ZE Records. This work, with much more accessible production than ''Music for a New Society'', was still extremely militant in some ways. It has never seen release on CD. A live album, ''[[John Cale Comes Alive]]'', followed it and included two new studio songs, "Ooh La La"<ref name=":0" /> and "Never Give Up on You". Different mixes of the two studio tracks appeared on both sides of the Atlantic. During this period, Eden Cale was born to Cale and his third wife Risé Irushalmi in July 1985.<ref name=":0" />

In a last effort at commercial success, Cale recorded ''[[Artificial Intelligence (John Cale album)|Artificial Intelligence]]'', his only album for [[Beggars Banquet Records]]. Written in collaboration with ''[[High Times]]''/''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' editor [[Larry Sloman|Larry "Ratso" Sloman]],<ref name=":0" /> the album was a pop effort characterised by synthesizers and [[drum machine]]s. It was not significantly more successful than its predecessors, despite the relative success of the single "Satellite Walk". However, "Dying on the Vine" is generally regarded as one of Cale's best songs. That same year, he played a neo-Nazi organizer on an episode of The Equalizer, and wrote the music for a dramatization of the Kurt Vonnegut short story, "Who Am I This Time?", which aired on PBS and starred Christopher Walken and Susan Sarandon.

Cale again returned to producing, this time for [[Happy Mondays]] on their first studio album: ''[[Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)]] in 1987.''

In part because of his young daughter, Cale took a long break from recording and performing. He made a comeback in 1989 with the Brian Eno-produced album ''[[Words for the Dying]]''.<ref name=":0" /> The album consists mainly of oral work, read or sung by Cale. It was written in 1982 as a response to the Anglo-Argentinian [[Falklands War]], using poems written by fellow Welshman [[Dylan Thomas]]. There are also two orchestral interludes, two other solo piano pieces "Songs Without Words", and finally a song by Cale, "The Soul of [[Carmen Miranda]]".

===1990s===
Following Warhol's death in 1987, Cale again collaborated with Lou Reed on the album ''[[Songs for Drella]]'' (1990), a [[song cycle]] about Warhol, their mentor.<ref name=":0" /> The album marked an end to a 18-year estrangement from Reed. In his autobiography, Cale revealed that he resented letting Reed take charge of the ''Songs for Drella'' project. The longstanding friction between Reed and Cale contributed to the passion and lurching frustration evident in the sound of the album, as did the ambivalent relationship Reed had to Warhol.

In 1990, following a 20-year hiatus, the Velvet Underground reformed for a [[Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain|Fondation Cartier]] benefit show in France.<ref name=":0" /> He again collaborated with Eno in the same year on ''[[Wrong Way Up]]'', a joint album characterised by an up-tempo accessibility at odds with Cale's description of the fraught relationship between the pair.<ref name=":0" />

A year later, Cale contributed one song, "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]", to the tribute album to Leonard Cohen, ''[[I'm Your Fan]]''. Cale's mid-tempo acoustic version was performed on piano, and his arrangement formed the basis of most subsequent covers of the song, which has since become a [[Standard (music)|standard]].<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/leonard-cohen-asks-for-brief-halt-to-new-covers-of-hallelujah-20090710 Leonard Cohen Asks for Brief Halt to New Covers of "Hallelujah"] Rolling Stone. Retrieved 25 November 2011</ref>

In 1992, Cale performed vocals on two songs, "Hunger" and "First Evening", on French composer and producer [[Hector Zazou]]'s album ''[[Sahara Blue]]''. All lyrics on the album were based on the poetry of [[Arthur Rimbaud]]. In 1994, Cale performed a spoken-word duet with [[Suzanne Vega]] on the song "The Long Voyage" on Zazou's album ''[[Chansons des mers froides]]''. The lyrics were based on the poem "Les Silhouettes" by [[Oscar Wilde]], and Cale co-wrote the music with Zazou. It was later released as a single (retitled "The Long Voyages" as it featured several remixes by Zazou, [[Mad Professor]] and more).

In 1996, Cale released ''[[Walking on Locusts]]''<ref name=":0" /> which turned out to be his only solo album of the decade. The record featured appearances by [[Talking Heads]]' [[David Byrne]],<ref name=":0" /> the [[Soldier String Quartet]], and original Velvet Underground drummer [[Moe Tucker]].

Cale composed an instrumental score for a Ballet titled ''Nico'', performed by the Scapino Ballet in Rotterdam in October 1997 and was released as ''[[Dance Music (album)|Dance Music]]''. Cale has written a number of film [[soundtrack]]s, often using more [[Classical music|classically]] influenced instrumentation.

In 1998, Cale mainly spent the year on tour with singer [[Siouxsie Sioux]]. In February, he was the curator of one day festival called "With a Little Help from My Friends" that took place at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] in [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands, with the presence of the [[Metropole Orchestra]].<ref name=paradiso>Mojo, September 1998, Martin Aston, p.22</ref> The concert was shown on Dutch national television and featured a song specially composed for the event and still unreleased, "Murdering Mouth", sung in [[duet]] with Siouxsie and her second band [[the Creatures]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKdZqyobGTo&t=4557s|title=Video of John Cale & Siouxsie / The Creatures "Murdering Mouth" (With a Little Help From My Friends festival|publisher=Youtube|date=25 February 1988|access-date=2 July 2018}}</ref> Cale and Siouxsie then did a double bill tour in the US for two months from late June until mid-August,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/1433686/siouxsie-budgie-and-john-cale-hitting-the-road/|title=Siouxsie and John Cale Hitting the Road|publisher=MTV.com|date=1 June 1998|access-date=2 July 2018}}<br />{{cite web|first=David|last=Gill |url=https://www.mtv.com/news/400173/creatures-creep-through-a-night-of-seductive-rock/ |title=Creatures Creep Through a Night of Seductive Rock |publisher=mtv.com |date=30 June 1998|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> both artists collaborating on stage on several songs including a version of "Venus in Furs".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMdZ7-YJRC8&list=RDMMdZ7-YJRC8&start_radio=1|title=Siouxsie – The Creatures with John Cale – Venus in Furs – video Live USA June 1998, Sacramento, Crest Theater|website=Youtube Rafles|access-date=2 September 2019}}<br />{{cite journal|first=Sandy

Cale recorded a cover of "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]" by [[Leonard Cohen]] for the 1991 album "I'm Your Fan." Cohen's original version of the song had not garnered much interest; it was only through Cale's arrangement and recording of it (and [[Jeff Buckley]]'s subsequent cover of Cale's arrangement) that it achieved popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/john-cale-leonard-cohen-hallelujah/|title=Without John Cale, Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' would've been forgotten'|last=Whatley|first=Jack|date=9 March 2020|work=Far Out Magazine}}</ref> It was used in the 2001 animated film ''[[Shrek (film)|Shrek]]'', although it did not appear in the film's soundtrack due to licensing issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/17727/john-cale-hallelujah-leonard-cohen|title=How John Cale recorded the definitive version of 'Hallelujah'|last=Dekel|first=Jon|date=8 December 2016|work=CBC Music}}</ref>

Signing to [[EMI]] in 2003 with the EP ''[[5 Tracks]]'' and the album ''[[HoboSapiens]]'', Cale again returned as a regular recording artist, this time with music influenced by modern [[electronica]] and [[alternative rock]]. The well-received album was co-produced with [[Nick Franglen]] of [[Lemon Jelly]]. It was followed by his 2005 album ''[[blackAcetate]]''.

In 2005, Cale produced [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] singer-songwriter [[Alejandro Escovedo]]'s eighth album, ''[[The Boxing Mirror]]'', which was released in May 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-04-17/features/0604170094_1_alejandro-escovedo-john-cale-boxing-mirror|title=Escovedo saves his best for Cale-produced 'The Boxing Mirror'|last1=Kot|first1=Greg|date=17 April 2006|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref> In June 2006, Cale released a radio and digital single, "Jumbo in tha Modernworld", which was a standalone single. A video was created for the song as well.

In March 2007, a 23-song live retrospective, ''[[Circus Live]]'', was released in Europe. This two-disc album, composed of recordings from both the 2004 and 2006 tours, featured new arrangements and reworkings of songs from his entire career. Of particular interest is the ''Amsterdam Suite'', a set of songs from a performance at the Amsterdam ''[[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]]'' in 2004.<ref>Archived by the venue on their [http://www.fabchannel.com/john_cale Internet performance repository]</ref> A studio-created drone has been edited into these songs. The set also included a DVD, featuring electric rehearsal material and a short acoustic set, as well as the video for "Jumbo in tha Modernworld", a 2006 single.

In May 2007, Cale contributed a cover of the [[LCD Soundsystem]] song "[[All My Friends (LCD Soundsystem song)|All My Friends]]" to the vinyl and digital single releases of the LCD Soundsystem original. Cale has continued to work with other artists, contributing viola to [[Replica Sun Machine]], the [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]]-produced second album by London [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] trio [[the Shortwave Set]] and producing the second album of American [[indie rock|indie]] band [[Ambulance LTD]].

On 11 October 2008, Cale hosted an event to pay tribute to Nico called "Life Along the Borderline" in celebration of what, five days later, would have been her 70th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Tribute to Nico – Live Event Featuring John Cale, Lisa Gerrard, Mark Lanegan, Soap&Skin and more at the Royal Festival Hall in London, England|publisher=LineOfBestFit.com|date=22 September 2008|url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2008/10/a-tribute-to-nico-live-event-featuring-john-cale-mark-lanegan-sparklehorse-and-more-at-the-royal-festival-hall|access-date=2 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011085123/http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2008/10/a-tribute-to-nico-live-event-featuring-john-cale-mark-lanegan-sparklehorse-and-more-at-the-royal-festival-hall|archive-date=11 October 2008}}</ref> The event was reprised at the Teatro Communale in [[Ferrara]], Italy on 10 May 2009.

Cale represented Wales at the 2009 [[Venice Biennale]], collaborating with artists, filmmakers, and poets, and focusing the artwork on his relationship with the [[Welsh language]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In January 2010, Cale was invited to be the first Eminent Art in Residence (EAR) at the [[MONA FOMA]] festival curated by [[Brian Ritchie]] held in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], Australia. His work for the 2009 Venice Biennale 'Dyddiau Du (dark days)'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artlink.com.au/articles/3386/mona-foma|title=MONA FOMA – Blak on blak|publisher=Artlink.com.au|access-date=3 January 2018}}</ref> was shown at the festival, along with a number of live performances at venues around Hobart.
