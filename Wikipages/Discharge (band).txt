'''Discharge''' are an English [[hardcore punk]] band formed in 1977 in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/discharge-mn0000156043|title=Discharge &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=AllMusic|access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> The band is known for influencing countless sub-genres of extreme music and their songs have been covered by some of the biggest names in heavy metal and other genres. The musical sub-genre of [[D-beat]] is named after Discharge and the band's distinctive drumbeat.

The band is characterized by a minimalistic approach to music and lyrics, using a heavy, distorted and grinding guitar-driven sound and raw, shouted vocals similar to a political speech, with lyrics on [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] themes, over intense drone-like rhythms. The band's sound has been called a "grave-black aural acid assault."<ref name="auto">McPadden, Mike. ''If You Like Metallica...: Here Are Over 200 Bands, CDs, Movies, and Other Oddities That You Will Love''. Backbeat Books, 2012. Section on "Discharge".</ref> Discharge "paved the way for an astounding array of politically motivated, musically intense and deeply confrontational bands". Discharge was "explicitly political" and used a "revolutionary/activist" attitude that moved hardcore away from its [[pub rock (UK)|pub rock]] origins and towards a "dangerous and provocative" territory.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2016/03/28/35-years-later-discharge-why-ep |title=35 Years Later: Discharge – 'Why' EP |last=Ferguson |first=Jason |date=28 March 2016 |website=orlandoweekly.com|publisher=Orlando Weekly |access-date=18 June 2017 }}</ref>

Discharge paved the way for various [[extreme metal]] styles such as [[thrash metal]], [[black metal]], [[crust punk]] and [[grindcore]]. The band's "brutal, extremist approach" and "extreme thrash noise" style of playing eventually led to the thrash genre.<ref>Knowles, Christopher. ''The Secret History of Rock 'n' Roll''. Cleis Press, 2010. p. 240.</ref>  "Discharge's influence on heavy metal is incalculable and metal superstars such as [[Metallica]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Sepultura]], [[Soulfly]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]] and [[Arch Enemy (band)|Arch Enemy]] have covered Discharge's songs in tribute."<ref name="ReferenceA">Knowles,Christopher.''The Secret History of Rock 'n' Roll.'' Cleis Press, 2010</ref> Discharge was a major influence on at least two generations of metal.<ref name="auto" />

== Career ==
=== Formation; classic line-up (1977–1979) ===
Discharge was formed in 1977 in Stoke-on-Trent by Terence "Tezz" Roberts (vocals) and Royston "Rainy" Wainwright (guitar).<ref name="Glasper">{{cite book |last=Glasper |first=Ian |title= Burning Britain: The History of Punk 1980–1984 |year=2004 |publisher=Cherry Red Books |isbn=978-1-901447-24-8 }}</ref> They soon recruited Roberts's younger brother Anthony "Bones" Roberts on lead guitar, Nigel Bamford on bass and Anthony "Akko" Axon (Allmusic gives the alternate nickname "Hacko"<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/discharge-mn0000156043/biography|title=Discharge – Biography & History – AllMusic}}</ref>) on drums.<ref name="Glasper" /> The musical style of the band was initially influenced by 1977-era punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] and [[the Clash]]. Engaging Tanya Rich as their manager, the band recorded their first demo, supported bands such as [[The Ruts]], The Clash and The Damned at the [[Victoria Hall, Stoke-on-Trent|Victoria Hall]], [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], and began touring.

=== Early EPs; ''Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing'' (1980–1982) ===
Axon left later that year, followed by Bamford, and the band recruited their roadie Kelvin "Cal" Morris as vocalist, moving Tezz Roberts to drums and Wainwright to bass.<ref name="Glasper" /> With Morris's addition, the group abandoned their previous Sex Pistols-influenced material and developed a new set of songs with a retooled sound. Anthony Roberts played guitar with a heavy, distorted and grinding style and Morris shouted or screamed vocals without melody. The bassist played with an "[[Fuzz bass|immense gurgling over-driven]]" bass tone.<ref>Glasper, Ian. ''Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980–1984''. PM Press, 2014. p. 189</ref> The tempo of the band's songs also steadily increased over the next year or so.<ref name="Glasper" />

The new, harder-edged style also tended to use much darker, more nihilistic and violent lyrics, focusing on [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] themes while emphasizing the grisly effects of [[nuclear warfare]] and the social ills caused by [[capitalism]].  Like [[Crass (band)|Crass]], Discharge supported anarchism and displayed the anarchist symbol.<ref>Pellegrino, Anthony Michael and Lee, Cristopher Dean. ''Let the Music Play!: Harnessing the Power of Music for History and Social Studies Classrooms''. IAP, 2012. p. 103</ref> The band also expressed its political and social themes in its albums' [[Cover art|artwork]], which depicted the horrors of war using an iconic black-and-white photography style. One of the notable images is the "Impaled Dove" artwork from a 1930s [[John Heartfield]] anti-war poster, which depicts a dove impaled on a bayonet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Discharge-Biography/1681E2F59106F1CE48256CEA000DF09D |title=Discharge Biography |publisher=Sing365.com |access-date=25 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808085423/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Discharge-Biography/1681E2F59106F1CE48256CEA000DF09D |archive-date=8 August 2014  }}</ref> The first gig with this new line-up and new sound was at Northwood Parish Hall. Among the audience was local record shop owner Mike Stone, who ran the [[Clay Records]] punk record label.<ref name="Glasper" />

In 1980, Discharge signed with Clay Records and recorded their first [[single (music)|single]] ''Realities of War'' in February 1980, which made the [[UK Indie Chart]] when it was released in April, after being played on BBC1 DJ [[John Peel]]'s show, peaking at number 5 and spending 44 weeks in the chart.<ref name="Glasper" /> The band also performed their first shows outside of Stoke-on-Trent in 1980, playing in [[Leicester]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and [[Glasgow]]. After two further [[Extended play|EP]] releases in that same year, founding member Tezz Roberts departed, to be replaced by [[Dave Ellesmere|Dave "Bambi" Ellesmere]] (formerly of The Insane) before the ''[[Why? (Discharge album)|Why?]]'' EP was recorded.<ref name="Glasper" /> Ellesmere did not stay long and the band replaced him with Garry Maloney of [[The Varukers]] on drums. ''Why?'' gave the band their first UK indie number one.<ref name="Glasper" /> ''Why?'' had cover photos showing the corpses of dead civilians. The song "Visions of War" had an "unrepentantly angry and punishing attack" and it became a signature song for the group. The songs "Maimed and Slaughtered," "Does This System Work?" and "Mania for Conquest" set out the song and sound template for crust bands. At the same time, the record showed that it was possible for a hardcore band to incorporate the sonic power of "[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] without sacrificing ideology or anger".<ref name="auto1" />

The Punknews.org reviewer argues that the early 1981 EP ''Why?'' "...revolutionized everything...[paving the] way for the [[atonal]] [[shred guitar|shredding]] of hardcore punk, thrash, death metal, and [[Grindcore|grind]], but also the dead-serious political ideals and brutal backing of crust hardcore". Ian Glasper described the EP as "one of the most potent anti-war records ever made".<ref>Glasper 2004, p. 171.</ref> [[Tom G. Warrior]] of [[Celtic Frost]] credited Discharge as "a revolution, much like [[Venom (band)|Venom]]", saying, "When I heard the first two Discharge records, I was blown away. I was just starting to play an instrument and I had no idea you could go so far. And to me, they were unlike other punk bands--they sounded more like metal."<ref>J. Bennett, "Procreation of the Wicked", ''Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces'', Albert Mudrian, ed., Da Capo Press, p. 34-35.</ref>

Discharge recorded their first full length album, 1982's ''[[Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing]]'' (HNSNSN), which was the number one punk album of all time in a poll by ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryrecords.co.uk/index.php?l1=2&l2=0&l3=0&rt=NE&article_id=855 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070927220100/http://www.sanctuaryrecords.co.uk/index.php?l1=2&l2=0&l3=0&rt=NE&article_id=855 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2007 |title=News – Sanctuary Records Group |publisher=Archive.is |access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> The album reached number two on the indie album chart and number 40 in the UK Album Chart.<ref name="Glasper" /> In David Konow's history of heavy metal, he calls the album the band's "...crowning achievement, a mercilessly brutal masterpiece."<ref>Konow, David. ''Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal''. Three Rivers Press, 2002. p. 239</ref>  ''Treble'' zine states that the music on HNSNSN was "much, much heavier" than previous punk and states that it influenced "punk rock, [and]... metal circles" with its "raw and intense" sound.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treblezine.com/10-essential-hardcore-punk-albums/ |title=10 Essential Hardcore Punk Albums |last=Terich |first=Jeff |website=treblezine.com |date=18 April 2013 |publisher=Treblezine |access-date=18 June 2017 }}</ref> [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] guitarist [[Scott Ian]] stated in 2015 that "You put on... Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing album now, and it's still as heavy and brutal as anything out there."<ref name="auto4">{{cite web |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/crossover-metal-punk-roots |title=Exploring the Roots of the Mid-80s Metal/Punk Crossover With Kerry King, Scott Ian, and Gary Holt |last=Konow |first=David |date=9 October 2015|website=noisey.vice.com |publisher=Noisey |access-date=18 June 2017}}</ref>

The group played regularly throughout the UK, often appearing with bands such as [[Charged GBH|GBH]] and [[The Exploited]], and the success of the debut album also saw them touring Canada, the United States, Italy, Yugoslavia, Holland, Finland and Sweden.<ref name="Glasper" /> The band had trouble getting into Canada at the border crossing at Buffalo, New York, as border guards thought the band looked like "animals".

=== Heavy metal crossover period; first breakup (1982–1987) ===
In 1982, Anthony "Bones" Roberts left the group, later to form [[Broken Bones (band)|Broken Bones]] with his brother Tezz later joining him. He was replaced by Peter "Pooch" Purtill <ref name="allmusic.com" /> who brought significant heavy metal influences. Purtill used a rock and metal style of guitar playing, including rock-oriented [[guitar solo]]s.<ref name="dmu.ac.uk">{{cite web |last1=Sompank |first1=Otto |title=From Crass to Thrash, to Squeakers: The Suspicious Turn to Metal in UK Punk and Hardcore Post '85 |url=https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2086/12037/From%20Crass%20to%20Thrash.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |website=dora.dmu.ac.uk |access-date=16 November 2018}}</ref> The ''[[Warning: Her Majesty's Government Can Seriously Damage Your Health|Warning...]]'' EP shows drastic stylistic differences, with Morris changing his angry shouts to a mix of regular singing and [[football chant]]s. Morris began to use a heavy metal, [[Ozzy Osbourne]]-influenced vocal style.<ref name="dmu.ac.uk" /> As well, the band used significantly slower tempos and their D-beat punk style was replaced with metal-oriented beats.

With the release of ''Ignorance'', Purtill and Maloney left the band to form the punk/metal crossover band [[HellsBelles]], to be replaced by guitarists Les "The Mole" Hunt and drummer Michael "Micky" Gibson. Following the later addition of second guitarist Stephen "Fish" Brooks, they released 1986's ''[[Grave New World (Discharge album)|Grave New World]]'', a mainstream metal album with a glam sound from Morris's high-pitched singing style. The album reached the indie top 10, but the band struggled with personnel problems as Morris departed and was briefly replaced by ex-[[Wrathchild]] frontman Rob "Rocky Shades" Berkeley the following year. The group disbanded shortly thereafter.

=== Reformation with new line-up (1990–1999) ===
Morris formed a new version of the band in 1990 with Andrew "Andy" Green on guitar, Anthony Morgan on bass and Mika Karppinen initially playing drums, only to be replaced by the returning Maloney. The ''Live At The City Garden, New Jersey'' album on Clay Records followed.<ref name="Glasper" /> In 1991 they released ''[[Massacre Divine]]'', which retained the metal sound, though with a noticeably harder edge than on ''Grave New World''. Morris again changed his vocal style, this time to rougher growling, similar to [[Brian Johnson]] of [[AC/DC]]. They toured widely in support of the record, including their only visit to Japan, but the tour was negatively received.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In 1993 they released ''[[Shootin' Up the World]]'', which continued Cal's new vocal style, but the songs were significantly heavier than on ''Massacre Divine''. The album retains the metal direction, although experiments with strange lyrics and song structures, coming close to thrash metal at times. Morris assembled further versions of the group, but they again disbanded in 1999.

=== Reunion of classic line-up and the Rat years (2001–2014) ===
[[File:Discharge2.jpg|thumb|Discharge performing in Rome in 2006. The distinctive lettering of the band's name can be seen in the banner at the back of the stage.]]
In 2001, the classic line-up of Morris, Roberts and Wainright reunited after meeting at a party held by original bassist Bamford, and in 2002 they released their self-titled album ''[[Discharge (album)|Discharge]]'', a return to their early 1980s style featuring political commentary and aggressive playing.<ref name="Glasper" /> As well, they brought back their intense D-beat drumming style, although combined with the remaining metal influence, it gave the album a [[speed metal]] influence with its thrashy riffs.

Morris would not commit to touring to promote the album and left the band, to be replaced by Anthony "Rat" Martin of [[The Varukers]]. The single "The Beginning of the End" was released in 2006, which marked a further step towards a return to the punk sound. Dave "Proper" Caution replaced Terence Roberts after his second departure this same year and the group released the ''Disensitise'' album in 2008. In 2011 the band released an EP titled "Propaganda Feeds". In 2012 they released a split single with American band [[Off with Their Heads (band)|Off with Their Heads]], released on Drunken Sailor Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/10861 |title=Discharge / Off With Their Heads — Split [7-inch&#93; |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=9 May 2012}}</ref> In 2014, Rat played his last show with the band in Ireland, then it was announced by the band that Rat would no longer be their singer.<ref>{{cite web |title= DISCHARGE part ways with their vocalist|url=https://idioteq.com/discharge-part-ways-with-their-vocalist/ |access-date=26 March 2021}}</ref>

=== End of Days (2014-present) ===
Shortly after Rat's firing, it was announced that [[Jeff Janiak|Jeff "JJ" Janiak]] would be taking over on vocal duties whilst Tezz Roberts would also return to the band, except this time on rhythm guitar rather than drums making Discharge a five-piece for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |title= D-Beat Lives On: Our Interview With Discharge|date=21 June 2016 |url=http://musicandriots.com/d-beat-lives-on-our-interview-with-discharge/ |access-date=26 March 2021}}</ref> On 3 June 2015, the group premiered a new song called "New World Order". An EP containing the song and a live recording of "Ain't No Feeble Bastard" was released on 16 January 2016, entitled ''New World Order''. On 10 February 2016, the band announced that their seventh studio album, titled ''[[End of days (Discharge album)|End of Days]]'', was to be released sometime in April. It would be Discharge's first album with Janiak and their first album as a five-piece band. On 3 March 2016, the [[Nuclear Blast]] [[YouTube]] channel uploaded a new song, "Hatebomb", which would later on be available through other streaming services. The same day, the band released the track listing for ''End of Days''.

''End of Days'', Discharge's seventh studio album, was released on 29 April through Nuclear Blast Records and entered the Official UK rock charts at No. 10 and on the indie charts at No. 23.<ref>{{cite web |title= Official Rock & Metal Albums Chart Top 40 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/rock-and-metal-albums-chart/20160506/112/ |access-date=26 March 2021}}</ref> The success of the album saw the band touring Europe and the US. MetalBlast gave the album a positive review, stating that it "...showcases everything about the band that has earned them their legendary status. The guitar work is fast and brutal, that famous D-beat drumming pattern is in full effect, and the vocals are a gruff, angry bark." The review states that the "songs are short, violent bursts of punk rock fury, brimming with an energy" with "a real sense of menace and sincerity in the tone" and it is "[r]elentless from start to finish".<ref name="auto5">{{cite web |url=http://www.metalblast.net/music-review/discharge-end-of-days/|title=Discharge – End Of Days |author= Bradley|date=6 May 2016 |website=metalblast.net |publisher=MetalBlast |access-date=18 June 2017 }}</ref> The production was praised as clear and "live"-sounding; the only negative comment was the lack of melody on the record.<ref name="auto5" />

On 30 December 2017, the group played a support slot for the original [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] reunion at the [[LA Forum]] in Los Angeles, California. The 17,000 capacity venue sold out in less than one minute.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7974022/misfits-reunion-show-original-lineup-2017-alkaline-trio/|title=Original Misfits Lineup Adds Second 2017 Reunion Show Featuring Alkaline Trio |author= chris Payne|date=25 September 2017 |website=billboard.com |access-date=23 March 2021 }}</ref>

== Influence ==
;D-beat
The intense [[Motörhead]]- and [[Buzzcocks]]-influenced drum beat used by Discharge early in their career is referred to as [[D-beat]] (sometimes referred to as "discrust").<ref name="auto" /> It became a [[music genre|subgenre]] of hardcore punk, especially in [[Japanese music|Japanese]], [[Brazil]]ian and [[Scandinavia]]n [[hardcore punk]] scenes. D-beat music is known for its "grinding, distorted, [and] brutally political" style. Many bands that followed Discharge's stylistic approach, primarily in [[Sweden]], began using the "Dis-" [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] and "-charge" [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] in their names, and even began using "Des-" words with "Dis-" in its place as a parody. Examples include Disaccord, [[Disfear]], [[Disclose]], Discard, Dischug, Recharge, Kegcharge, Disarm and Distraught.

The bands who followed this naming trend also imitated Discharge's logo. This resulted in UK anarchist punk band Active Minds issuing an EP in 1995 entitled ''Dis Is Getting Pathetic'', which parodied the cover of ''[[Fight Back (Discharge EP)|Fight Back]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Active-Minds-Dis-Is-Getting-Pathetic/release/1134360 |title=Active Minds (2) – Dis Is Getting Pathetic... (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=9 May 2012}}</ref>

;Influence on other genres
As well as bringing the D-beat subgenre into existence, Discharge influenced bands operating within other types of extreme music. ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]'' magazine states that there are "...few bands who have had more influence over so many different scenes than Discharge", including the first generation of thrash bands, grind and hardcore groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/featured/growing-old-dis-gracefully-discharge-frontman-rat-on-why-punks-most-explosive-survivors-can-never-die |title=Growing old dis-gracefully: Discharge frontman Rat on why punk's most explosive survivors can never die |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=5 September 2011 |website=decibelmagazine.com |publisher=Decibel Magazine |access-date=18 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623031112/http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/featured/growing-old-dis-gracefully-discharge-frontman-rat-on-why-punks-most-explosive-survivors-can-never-die |archive-date=23 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

"Discharge's influence on heavy metal is incalculable and metal superstars such as Metallica, Anthrax and Sepultura have covered Discharge's songs in tribute."<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Some photos of Metallica, Anthrax and Exodus band members from the early 1980s show them wearing Discharge T-shirts.<ref name="dmu.ac.uk" /> [[Thrash metal]] groups like Metallica and [[Slayer]] were inspired by their speed and brutality. Anthrax was already playing Discharge cover songs by 1983.<ref name="auto4" />

Oakland metal band [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] named Discharge's "Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing" (the title track of the album of the same name) as one of the top five UK anarcho-punk tracks. The band's singer/guitarist [[Steve Von Till]] stated that Discharge "...bridged the gap between Motörhead, [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and punk rock" with their "huge fucking wall-of-sound guitar that was just ridiculously punishing, taking on heavy metal's gain and volume but creating something totally unique and new."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/nov/03/neurosis-crass-bands-anarcho-punk-steve-von-till |title=Neurosis: 'Crass were the mother of all bands':nThe Oakland metal band know their British anarcho punk – so singer/guitarist Steve Von Till picked five crucial tracks |last=Deller |first=Alex |date=3 November 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=18 June 2017 }}</ref>

Discharge have been credited for laying the groundwork for grindcore.<ref name="auto2">Brown, Andy R.; Spracklen, Karl; Kahn-Harris,  Keith; and Scott, Niall. ''Global Metal Music and Culture: Current Directions in Metal Studies''. Routledge, 2016</ref> Early grindcore acts such as Napalm Death and [[Repulsion (band)|Repulsion]] were influenced by Discharge, as were early death metal acts such as [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Nihilist (band)|Nihilist]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mundrian|first1=Albert|title=Choosing Death: The Improbably History of Death Metal and Grindcore|publisher=Decibel Books}}</ref> Discharge were also crucial to the development of [[crust punk]], influencing many of the first crust bands, such as [[Doom (UK band)|Doom]], [[Hellbastard]] and [[Antisect]].

;Vocals
[[James Hetfield]] of Metallica nominated Cal Morris for ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Singers poll.  Morris was No.&nbsp;17 on a list of 20 singers whom James nominated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/the-100-greatest-singers-inside-the-ballots-20081112/100-singers-ballots-james-hetfield-20961094 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201165721/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/the-100-greatest-singers-inside-the-ballots-20081112/100-singers-ballots-james-hetfield-20961094 |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2013 |title=The 100 Greatest Singers: Inside the Ballots Pictures – 100 Singers Ballots: James Hetfield |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=9 May 2012}}</ref>

;Cover songs
Discharge's wide influence can also be seen in the range of cover versions recorded by hardcore punk and metal groups. The Scottish anarcho-punk band [[Oi Polloi]] covered the song "State Violence, State Control". During the same period, the Swedish hardcore punk band [[Mob 47]] covered "Never Again" on their ''Ultimate Attack'' recording. New York City anarchist crust band [[Nausea (band)|Nausea]], recorded "Ain't No Feeble Bastard" along with "Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing", on ''The Punk Terrorist Anthology, Vol. 1''. Swedish grindcore band [[Nasum]] covered "Visions of War" for a tribute compilation. D-beat/hardcore punk band [[From Ashes Rise]] recorded the nuclear war-themed "Hell on Earth". In 2003, US hardcore band [[Ensign (band)|Ensign]] covered "Protest and Survive" on their album of covers ''[[Love the Music, Hate the Kids]]''.

Metal groups from several metal subgenres have recorded Discharge songs. Thrash metal bands covering Discharge material include Metallica ("Free Speech For The Dumb" and "The More I See", on their [[recording studio|studio]] covers album ''[[Garage Inc.]]''); Anthrax ("Protest and Survive" on their studio album ''[[Attack of the Killer B's]]''); and Brazilian Sepultura ("A Look At Tomorrow", "Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing" and "Protest and Survive"). The groove metal band [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] covered "The Possibility of Life's Destruction" as a bonus track to their album [[The More Things Change...]]. [[Soulfly]] covered ("Ain't No Feeble Bastard" and "The Possibility of Life's Destruction")

Discharge songs also attracted interest from other metal subgenres, such as [[doom metal]] and grindcore. UK doom metal band [[Solstice (UK doom metal band)|Solstice]] covered "Protest & Survive" and Norwegian [[black metal]] band [[Carpathian Forest]] covered "The Possibilities of Life's Destruction" on their compilation album ''[[We're Going to Hell for This]] – Over a Decade of Perversions'', while grindcore/death metal band Napalm Death covered "War's No Fairytale" on their ''[[Leaders Not Followers: Part 2]]'' album.
