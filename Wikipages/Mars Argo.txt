'''Brittany Alexandria Sheets''', known professionally as '''Mars Argo''', is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and [[internet personality]].<ref name="noisey">{{cite web |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/6v7jdr/mars-argo-are-done-being-cool |title=Mars Argo are Done Being Cool - Watch Their New Video for "Runaway, Runaway" |date=2013-02-14 |website=[[Noisey]] |access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref>

Sheets is prominently known for her portrayal of fictionalized stage personas of herself on [[YouTube]]. She became known as the lead singer of the [[indie rock]] band Mars Argo, named after her main stage persona.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/11/poppy-youtube-meme-pop-sensation-titanic-sinclair-moriah-pereira|title=Poppy is a disturbing internet meme seen by millions.

The band continued to release [[extended play]]s ''Internet Sessions'' and ''Linden Place'' throughout 2010 and 2011. In a 2013 ''Vice'' article, the band stated that they were working on their own TV show,<ref name="noisey" /> but this was later abandoned.

Besides releasing music, Sheets self produced, wrote, and directed content for her YouTube channel, once co-operated by her former partner [[Titanic Sinclair]] (real name Corey Michael Mixter). The channel's content was often satirical, revolving around society and Internet culture. However, after the duo broke up, all but three videos were removed from the channel. The only videos that still remain on her grocerybagdottv (renamed grocerybagdottvtest in 2019) channel to this day are the music videos for "Using You", "Runaway Runaway", and a satirical video called "Delete Your Facebook".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/grocerybagdottv|title=grocerybagdottv|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref> The band took a hiatus in 2015, subsequently breaking up afterward. Sheets disappeared from the Internet shortly after, only occasionally posting on [[Tumblr]].

In 2018, after a period of little-to-no activity, Sheets filed a lawsuit against Mixter and his collaborator at the time, [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]] (real name Moriah Rose Pereira). The lawsuit details her experiences of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]] from Mixter and her artistic identity and likeness being stolen.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=2018-05-16|title=A new legal battle could threaten Poppy’s YouTube career|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/16/17346050/poppy-lawsuit-mars-argo-titanic-sinclair-youtube-explained|access-date=2021-08-19|website=Polygon|language=en}}</ref> The lawsuit was settled out of court, with agreements that Mixter and Pereira would not be in contact with Sheets.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-08|title=Poppy and collaborator Titanic Sinclair settle lawsuit with Mars Argo|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/poppy-and-manager-titanic-sinclair-settle-lawsuit-with-mars-argo-2428225|access-date=2021-08-19|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref> Since then, Sheets has ventured into acting, portraying Sissy in the feature-length drama film ''[[Dinner in America]]'' (2020) which premiered at the 2020 [[Sundance Film Festival]].

== Early life ==
Brittany Alexandria Sheets was born in [[Saginaw, Michigan]]. Growing up, she played piano and sang in her church choir. She has stated that her mother never allowed her to play video games as a child, believing that they were a distraction from her studies. Before launching the YouTube project grocerybagdottv, Sheets attended university and pursued a major in biology.<ref>{{Citation|last=argo mars|title=Mars Argo - Fearless Radio Interview (2/17/2012)|date=2017-07-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxQerlrAqz8|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref>

== Career ==

They also co-operated a YouTube channel under the title Grocerybagdottv, where they uploaded music-related content and a series of social commentary videos, dubbed ''Computer Show''. Their most popular non-music video is a 2014 episode of this series, titled "Delete Your Facebook,"<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/06/shes-poppy/|title=Welcome to Poppy's World|last=Pandell|first=Lexi|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}</ref> mocking social media usage and the website of the [[Facebook|same name]]. The music video for "Using You", the most well known single from the project, already counts more than 19 million views on the channel.

The band released their debut album, ''Technology Is a Dead Bird'', on November 6, 2009.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://marsargo.bandcamp.com/album/technology-Is-a-dead-bird|title=Technology is a Dead Bird by Mars Argo|date=November 6, 2009|website=[[Bandcamp]]|access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/technology-is-dead-bird/id339924415|title=Technology Is a Dead Bird by Mars Argo|date=November 6, 2009|website=[[iTunes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526052554/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/technology-is-a-dead-bird/id339924415|archive-date=May 26, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref> It was followed up with an acoustic EP, ''Internet Sessions'', in 2010,<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://marsargo.bandcamp.com/album/internet-sessions|title=Internet Sessions {{!}} Mars Argo|date=August 18, 2010|website=Bandcamp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017092316/https://marsargo.bandcamp.com/album/internet-sessions|archive-date=October 17, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=April 27, 2010}}</ref> and another EP, ''Linden Place'', in 2011.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://marsargo.bandcamp.com/album/linden-place-ep|title=Linden Place EP {{!}} Mars Argo|date=March 20, 2011|website=Bandcamp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413175735/http://marsargo.bandcamp.com/album/linden-place-ep|archive-date=April 13, 2011|url-status=live|access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/linden-place-ep/431654020|title=Linden Place - EP by Mars Argo|date=April 4, 2011|website=iTunes|access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref> They began working on an eventually scrapped second album with Chicago-based producer, [[Johnny K]], soon after ''Technology Is a Dead Bird'' was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.fearlessradio.com/component/k2/item/4106-mars-argo|title=Mars Argo - Fearless Radio Interview|date=February 17, 2012|website=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428011600/http://www2.fearlessradio.com/component/k2/item/4106-mars-argo|archive-date=April 28, 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp1ZluX4aYs|title=Mars Argo - Using You (Official)|date=January 13, 2015|website=YouTube|access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name="noisey" />

=== 2015–2019: Mars Argo breaks up ===
The couple moved to Los Angeles in 2012, where they filmed and released the remainder of the YouTube channel's uploads throughout 2014, followed by the romantic separation of Sheets and Mixter. The band continued to perform during the [[South by Southwest]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_MS26419|title=Mars Argo|website=South by Southwest|access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref> before going on a hiatus and eventually breaking up. The dissolvement of both the relationship and the band was due to Mixter/Sinclair's incessant verbal abuse and physical violence towards Sheets/Mars Argo. He continued to stalk and harass her after the breakup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/Mars-Argo%20-ThatPoppy-Lawsuit-01.pdf|title=Mars Argo That Poppy Lawsuit|date=April 17, 2017|website=TMZ|access-date=September 13, 2021}}</ref> Subsequently, this also led to Sheets falling off of the Internet from 2015 to 2018.

Sheets resurfaced in April 2018, by addressing her absence, and promising new music in the future to her fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/marsargo/status/986362978902597632|title=Mars Argo|date=April 17, 2018|website=[[Twitter]]|access-date=April 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marsargo.tumblr.com/post/173097228361/putting-this-here-too|title=The Internet is Boring.|date=April 19, 2018|website=[[Tumblr]]|access-date=April 29, 2018}}</ref>

=== 2020–present: ''Dinner in America'' and future projects ===
Sheets portrayed Sissy in the Adam Rehmeier written and directed feature length [[coming of age]] [[drama film]] ''Dinner in America'' alongside [[Kyle Gallner]], [[Emily Skeggs]], [[Pat Healy (actor)|Pat Healy]], [[Griffin Gluck]], [[Lea Thompson]], and [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]]. The film was filmed in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] and was selected to premiere at the 2020 [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hinds |first1=Julie |title=Detroit makes its mark on the lineup for the 2020 Sundance Film Festival in January |url=https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/movies/julie-hinds/2019/12/04/sundance-film-festival-lineup-dinner-in-america-detroit/2611886001/ |website=Detroit Free Press |access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref>

== Lawsuit against Sinclair and Poppy ==
On April 17, 2018, Sheets filed a 44-page lawsuit against Corey Mixter (Titanic Sinclair) and his collaborator Moriah Pereira ([[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]]) alleging copyright infringement, stalking, and emotional and physical abuse by Mixter during and after their breakup and the subsequent abandonment of the Mars Argo project.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tmz.com/2018/04/17/youtube-legal-feud-titanic-sinclair-mars-argo-thatpoppy/|title=MARS SUES TITANIC AND THATPOPPY ..

On May 7, Poppy made a public statement about the "frivolous" lawsuit, stating that Argo was attempting to manipulate her psychologically. She called the suit a "publicity campaign" and a "desperate grab for fame".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8454780/poppy-responds-mars-argo-copyright-lawsuit-desperate-grab-for-fame/|title=Poppy Responds to Mars Argo Copyright Suit, Calls It 'Desperate Grab for Fame'|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref>

The lawsuit was dismissed on September 14, having been settled out of court with Sheets gaining all rights, title, and interest to the Mars Argo music and brand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/lawsuit-poppy-titanic-sinclair-dismissed/|title=Lawsuit against YouTube personality Poppy dismissed|date=2018-09-18|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17870030/mars-argo-poppy-youtube-influencer-youtuber-lawsuit-dismissed|title=The lawsuit against Poppy and her creator has been dismissed|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref> Poppy later retracted her accusations towards Argo following her public split from Sinclair in December 2019, and alleged that she was a victim of the same psychological abuse Sinclair had inflicted on Argo.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lavin |first1=Will |title=Poppy parts ways with Titanic Sinclair, accuses him of "manipulative patterns" |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/poppy-titanic-sinclair-accuses-manipulative-patterns-2591556 |website=NME |date=December 29, 2019 |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref>
