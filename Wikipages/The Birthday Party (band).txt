'''The Birthday Party''' (originally known as '''The Boys Next Door''') were an Australian [[post-punk]] band, active from 1978 to 1983. Despite limited commercial success, The Birthday Party's influence has been far-reaching, and they have been called "one of the darkest and most challenging post-punk groups to emerge in the early '80s."<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{AllMusic|class=artist |id=p3681/biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Birthday Party |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=9 October 2011}}</ref> The group's "bleak and noisy soundscapes," which drew irreverently on [[blues music|blues]], [[free jazz]], and [[rockabilly]], provided the setting for vocalist [[Nick Cave]]'s disturbing tales of violence and perversion.<ref name="auto"/><ref name=rey>{{cite book |author=Reynolds, Simon |title=Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ripitupstartagai00reyn/page/429 429–431] |publisher=London: Faber and Faber, 2005 |isbn=0-571-21569-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/ripitupstartagai00reyn/page/429 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/08590-the-birthday-party-junkyard|title=The Quietus &#124; 30 Years On: We Return To The Birthday Party's Junkyard|website=The Quietus}}</ref> Their music has been described by critic [[Simon Reynolds]] as [[gothic rock|gothic]], and their single "[[Release the Bats]]" was particularly influential on the emerging gothic scene.<ref name=rey />

In 1980, The Birthday Party moved from [[Melbourne]] to London, where they were championed by broadcaster [[John Peel]]. Disillusioned by their stay in London, the band's sound and live shows became increasingly violent. They broke up soon after relocating to [[West Berlin]] in 1982. The creative core of The Birthday Party – singer and songwriter Nick Cave, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter [[Mick Harvey]], and singer, songwriter and guitarist [[Rowland S. Howard]] – later went on to acclaimed careers.

==History==
===Early years and The Boys Next Door (1973–1978)===
The nucleus of the band first met at the private boys school [[Caulfield Grammar School]], in suburban [[Melbourne]], in the early seventies. A rock group was formed in 1973, with [[Nick Cave]] (vocals), [[Mick Harvey]] (guitar), and [[Phill Calvert]] (drums), with other students John Cocivera, Brett Purcell and Chris Coyne (on guitar, bass and saxophone respectively). Most were also members of the school choir. The band played under various names at parties and school functions with a mixed repertoire of [[David Bowie]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], among others. Saxophonist Chris Coyne went on to join the [[Bands and accompanying musicians of Paul Kelly|Paul Kelly Band]] in the 1980s.<ref name="ARDb">{{cite web |url=http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/k/kellypaul.html |title=Paul Kelly |publisher=[[Australian Rock Database]]. Passagen.se (Magnus Holmgren) | access-date = 31 October 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081022040737/http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/k/kellypaul.html| archive-date = 22 October 2008 }}</ref>

After their final school year in 1975 the band decided to continue as a four-piece group, with friend [[Tracy Pew]] picking up the bass. Greatly affected by the [[Punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976 which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] making their first recordings and tours, The Boys Next Door, as they were now called, began performing punk and proto-punk [[cover version]]s, such as "[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]" and "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]", and a few original songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.iae.nl/users/maes/cave/live/bndgigs.html#2nd |title=The Boys Next Door Concerts |publisher=Home.iae.nl |access-date=9 October 2011}}</ref> By November 1977 their set was dominated by fast original [[New wave music|new wave]] material, such as "Sex Crimes" and "Masturbation Generation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/1301167 |title="Lethal Weapons" 30 Years On|author=David Nichols |publisher=Messandnoise.com |date=22 October 2007 |access-date=9 October 2011}}</ref>

The Boys' second guitarist, [[Rowland S. Howard]], joined in 1978, and about this time, the group's sound changed dramatically. The addition of Howard's guitar was certainly a catalyst (his later use of [[audio feedback]] being a hallmark of the group) but there were other changes, as well: their sound drew upon [[punk rock|punk]], [[rockabilly]], [[free jazz]] and the rawest [[blues]], but defied concise categorization. Many songs were driven by prominent, repetitive [[bassline]]s and frenetic, yet [[minimalist music|minimalist]], drumming. Though the band was tightly rehearsed, the instrumentalists often sounded as if they were on the verge of collapse, this quality only emphasising the newfound mania of Cave's singing, and his [[expressionist]] lyrics. In producer/engineer [[Tony Cohen]] they found a willing accomplice to their experimentation and their refusal to repeat themselves; and in manager [[Keith Glass]] they found an enthusiastic financial backer. Glass' label [[Missing Link Records]] released all of the early Birthday Party records.

===Name change and relocations (1978–1982)===
The Boys Next Door's best known song, "[[Shivers (The Boys Next Door song)|Shivers]]", written by Howard, and first performed and recorded by his band The Young Charlatans, was banned by radio stations because of a reference to suicide. After recordings and moderate success in Australia (including hundreds of live shows) they headed for London in 1980, changed their name to The Birthday Party and launched into a period of innovative and aggressive music-making. Some sources say the band took its new name from the [[Harold Pinter]] play ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'';<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heathenworld.com/bandname/a-e.html |title=Heathenworld.com |publisher=Heathenworld.com |access-date=9 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011182130/http://www.heathenworld.com/bandname/a-e.html |archive-date=11 October 2011  }}</ref> others (including Ian Johnston's Cave biography) state it was prompted by Cave misremembering, or intentionally misattributing, the name to a non-existent birthday party scene in the [[Dostoyevsky]] novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''.  In a 2008 interview, Rowland S. Howard gave his own recollection: "The name The Birthday Party came up in conversation between Nick and myself. There's this apocryphal story about it coming from a Dostoyevsky novel. It may have had various connotations, but what he and I spoke about was a sense of celebration and making things into more an occasion and ritual".<ref>Mojo magazine, November 2008. As told to Roy Wilkinson p.162</ref> They resided in London, with trips back to Australia and tours through Europe and the U.S. before relocating to [[West Berlin]] in 1982.

Above the barely-controlled racket, Cave's vocals ranged from desperate to simply menacing and demented. Critics have written that "neither [[John Cale]] nor [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was ever this scary,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=birthday_party |title=Trouser Press |publisher=Trouser Press |access-date=9 October 2011}}</ref> and that Cave "doesn't so much sing his vocals as expel them from his gut".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song |id=t3606092 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Blast Off! |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=9 October 2011}}</ref> Though Cave drew on earlier rock and roll shriekers—especially [[Iggy Pop]] and [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]]'s [[Alan Vega]]—his singing with the Birthday Party remains powerful and distinct. His lyrics also drew on [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|pp=428–429}}

The single "[[Release the Bats]]" came out during the emergence of the gothic scene.<ref name=lew>{{cite web

Their 1982 album ''[[Junkyard (album)|Junkyard]]'' was inspired by American [[Southern Gothic]] imagery, dealing with extreme subjects like an evangelist's murdered daughter.<ref name=rey/>

===Final years (1982–1983)===
[[File:George Hotel Crystal Ballroom St Kilda.jpg|thumb|The Birthday Party were regulars at Melbourne's [[Crystal Ballroom (Melbourne)|Crystal Ballroom]], playing their final show there in 1983.]]
For The Birthday Party, things had changed. Calvert was ejected in 1982; he was reportedly "unable to nail down the beats for 'Dead Joe' to everyone's satisfaction",<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song |id=t3606094 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Dead Joe |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=9 October 2011}}</ref> and Harvey moved to drums. When Pew was jailed for [[drunk driving]] and petty theft early in 1982, [[The Moodists|Chris Walsh]], [[Barry Adamson]] and Howard's brother [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry]] replaced him for live appearances and brief studio work. Pew rejoined the band in July.

The ''[[Mutiny/The Bad Seed|Mutiny]]'' EP contained lyrics evoking [[blasphemy]], words which were as dark as the gothic poems of [[Lautréamont]].<ref name=rey/> The title track portrayed a dirty heaven with rats and trash.<ref name=rey/>

In 1982 a spin-off group with [[Lydia Lunch]], [[Honeymoon in Red]], recorded an album which was eventually released in 1987. Harvey and Cave were reportedly so unhappy with the mixing and overdubbing done after their involvement that they requested their names be withheld from its liner notes. Howard and Pew apparently had no objections to being credited by name.

A tour in January 1983 found the group return to a five-piece, with [[Laughing Clowns|Jeffrey Wegener]] playing drums and Harvey returning to second guitar.  Wegener did not remain with the group, however, and they returned to a four-piece soon after.  Later that year, [[Blixa Bargeld]] from the German group [[Einstürzende Neubauten]] recorded a guitar part in the studio on the track "Mutiny in Heaven".  Tension between Cave and Howard soon came to a head, but it was Harvey who first left the group – their final tour saw [[The Marching Girls|Des Hefner]] on drums. The Birthday Party played their final show at the [[Crystal Ballroom (Melbourne)|Crystal Ballroom]] in St Kilda on 9 June 1983 and disbanded not long after, due in part to the split between Cave and Howard, as well as work and drug-related exhaustion.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=134}}</ref>

===Post-breakup, legacy and influence===
Several groups rose from The Birthday Party's ashes: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] (featuring Cave, Harvey, Adamson, Bargeld and briefly Pew), [[Crime and the City Solution]] (featuring Harvey and Howard, later just Harvey) and [[These Immortal Souls]] (featuring Howard).

Pew died from injuries caused by an [[epileptic seizure]] in 1986.

On 1 September 1992, there was a brief Birthday Party reunion as Rowland S. Howard joined Nick Cave and Mick Harvey on stage at a Bad Seeds [[NME]] charity show at the Town and Country Club in London to play "Wild World", "Dead Joe" and "Nick the Stripper".

Due in part to their legendary status and to the continuing success of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, The Birthday Party's back catalogue has been re-released on CD several times. Mick Harvey has overseen releases of rare or previously unissued recordings (''Live'' and ''John Peel'' CDs).

The Birthday Party's initial impact was on the [[gothic rock]] genre. According to ''[[New Musical Express]]'', "The Party have been indirectly held responsible for the rise of a visceral new [[hardcore punk|hardcore]], ranging from The [[Sex Gang Children]], through Danse Macabre to [[March Violets]]."<ref name="New Musical Express 1982. p. 141, 143"/> Rock acts that have cited The Birthday Party as an influence include [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]],<ref>[http://www.mybloodyvalentine.net/press/guitarworld-apr93.html Guitar World, April 1993 by Alan Di Perna] Kevin Shields: "The Birthday Party were also my favorite band at that time. They're pretty much why I formed a band. Them and the Cramps."</ref> [[Alex Turner]],<ref>[https://ew.com/music-festivals/2014/06/13/arctic-monkeys-alex-turner-interview-tour-bonaroo/ EW, June 2014 by Kyle Anderson] Alex Turner: "I got turned on to this record by Roland F. Howard called Popcrimes. He was in the Birthday Party with Nick Cave, and it’s f—ing excellent. The lyrics are fantastic. It’s a lot easier on the ear than the Birthday Party—and I love the Birthday Party, by the way. I was listening to them just yesterday."</ref> and [[LCD Soundsystem]].<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSE/is_298/ai_n15662221 Thrasher Magazine,  Sept, 2005 by Sarah Pulver] James Murphy: « My first album: I got some birthday money, went to the record store and bought Siouxsie and the Banshees Join Hands, The Fall Grotesque, and The Birthday Party Nick the Stripper, all in one day. And all three of those records are three of my favorite things I've ever heard. »</ref> In 2006, American label [[Three One G]] released ''Release The Bats: The Birthday Party As Heard Through The Meat Grinder Of Three One G'', a compilation featuring covers by various bands, including [[Daughters (band)|Daughters]], [[Melt-Banana]] and [[Cattle Decapitation]].

In October 2007, Cave alone was inducted into the [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] Hall of Fame. During his acceptance speech, Cave took it upon himself to 'induct' the Australian members of the Bad Seeds (including Harvey), plus Howard and Pew from The Birthday Party.

Rowland S. Howard died on 30 December 2009 of [[liver cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/31/2783381.htm?section=entertainment |title=Bandmate pays tribute to Birthday Party guitarist – Entertainment (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=31 December 2009 |access-date=9 October 2011}}</ref> In 2012 Howard's early songs were played live as a tribute in Melbourne: a four-piece band played consisting of Harvey, Calvert, Ron Rude and Rowland Howard's sister Angela.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://messandnoise.com/news/4439804 |title=Watch: Rowland S Howard Tribute At Ballroom Reunion In News : Mess+Noise |publisher=Messandnoise.com |date=5 March 2012 |access-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ELakQXcA?url=http://messandnoise.com/news/4439804 |archive-date=11 February 2013  }}</ref>
