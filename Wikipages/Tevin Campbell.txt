He was also referenced in two later episodes.

The song, "Round and Round" earned Campbell a Grammy Award nomination at the [[1991 Grammy Awards|33rd Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance|Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] but lost to [[Luther Vandross]] for "[[Here and Now (Luther Vandross song)|Here and Now]]".

===1991–1992: ''T.E.V.I.N.'' and early success===
Campbell followed the success of his first two singles by releasing his debut album, ''[[T.E.V.I.N. (album)|T.E.V.I.N.]]'', in November 1991 which featured the R&B hit singles and Campbell's number 1 R&B hit: "[[Tell Me What You Want Me to Do]]" followed by "[[Alone with You (Tevin Campbell song)|Alone with You]]", and "[[Goodbye (Tevin Campbell song)|Goodbye]]". ''T.E.V.I.N.'' reached number 38 on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and 5 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. The album eventually was certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for selling 1 million copies in the United States. ''T.E.V.I.N.'' earned Campbell a Grammy Award nomination for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the [[1993 Grammy Awards|35th Grammy Awards]] but lost to [[Al Jarreau]] for his album ''[[Heaven and Earth (Al Jarreau album)|Heaven and Earth]]''. The album was produced by Jones, [[Al B. Sure!]] and [[Narada Michael Walden]] among others.

Between interviews and television appearances following the release of ''T.E.V.I.N.'', he contributed to three special projects: ''[[Handel's Messiah: A Soulful Celebration]]'', a Grammy Award-winning album produced by [[Mervyn Warren]] of [[Take 6]]; ''[[A Very Special Christmas 2]]'' album, featuring Campbell's rendition of "[[Oh Holy Night]]"; and ''[[Barcelona Gold]]'', the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]] album which includes his hit "One Song".

===1993–1995: ''I'm Ready'' and prominent success===
The singer's second album, the 1993 release of the album ''[[I'm Ready (Tevin Campbell album)|I'm Ready]]'', was also produced by Jones and Medina. "I wanted to make a more mature-sounding album to reflect my current state of mind," Campbell explained to J. R. Reynolds in ''Billboard'' magazine. "''I'm Ready'' says a lot about who I am as a person because of the things I've been through during the last four years or so. I hope people will see that I'm not the same young kid that I was on my first album." The album was produced by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] among others.

===1996–1998: ''Back to the World'' and after===
The year 1996 saw the release of his third album, ''[[Back to the World (Tevin Campbell album)|Back to the World]]''. The album saw production by [[Sean Combs]]. It reached number 46 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and 11 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In terms of sales, ''Back to the World'' was a disappointment compared to his first two albums ''T.E.V.I.N.'' and ''I'm Ready'' because it only reached Gold status. The album's first single,"Back To The World", reached number 47 on the Billboard 200 chart and 14 on the R&B charts becoming a moderate hit. However, the other two singles didn't even reach the Hot 100, "I Got It Bad" and "[[Could You Learn to Love]]" only managed to reach the R&B charts with very low peak positions. Also in 1996, Campbell sung a cover of the song, "[[The Impossible Dream (The Quest)|The Impossible Dream]]", on the compilation album ''Rhythm of the Games: 1996 Olympic Games Album''. Campbell also contributed to the [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] Records tribute album called ''The Songs of West Side Story'' in dedication to the original ''[[West Side Story]]'' musical and it's  [[West Side Story (1961 film)|1961 film]] adaptation. Campbell sung the song "One Hand, One Heart" on the album which also featured contributions from [[Selena]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Sheila E.]] and [[All-4-One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-songs-of-west-side-story-mw0000646744|title=AllMusic Review by William Ruhlmann|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2015-06-27}}</ref>

===1999–2002: Self-titled fourth album, arrest and hiatus===
On February 23, 1999, Campbell released his [[Tevin Campbell (album)|fourth album]] which is also [[Self Titled|self-titled]]. It found Campbell venturing into the [[neo-soul]] venue. The project was rushed and as a result, it charted below the R&B Top 30, with only one single charting, a Top 30 song called "Another Way".<ref name=billboard /> The album has collaborations with [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Faith Evans]], [[David Foster]], and [[SWV]] lead singer [[Coko]].
In 1999, Campbell made another guest appearance on the hit show ''[[Moesha]]'' starring Brandy in the episode, "The Rite Stuff".

In July 1999, Campbell was arrested after [[Solicitation|soliciting]] a lewd act from an undercover police officer during a sting operation in [[Van Nuys]], California. The sting operation was reportedly conducted in an Elementary School area where there had been numerous complaints from the public about [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] and solicitation. According to police reports, Campbell was also in possession of a small amount of [[marijuana]] at the time of his arrest.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_15_96/ai_55983467 |title=Singer Tevin Campbell Arrested On Solicitation, Marijuana Charges In Los Angeles |date=1999-09-13 |magazine=Jet |access-date=2008-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211093831/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_15_96/ai_55983467 |archive-date=2008-12-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During 2000, Campbell stayed out of the public eye. In 2001, Campbell released the compilation album, ''[[The Best of Tevin Campbell]]''. In 2002, it was reported that he had stopped making music. However, this didn't stop his international (World) tours.

On 31 December 2002 he performed in Uganda at the Nile Hotel and International Conference Center (known today as Serena Kampala Hotel) Gardens to a cheering crowd of Youths, young and old.

He performed popular songs like "I'm Ready", "Tell Me What You Want Me to Do", "Round and Round", and many others that took the show until 2am of 1 January 2003. He was accompanied by his team, his mother and DJ Dennis "The Menace".

===2003–2008: Broadway and shelved album===
Through 2003 to 2004, Campbell had still not made a public appearance and kept a low profile.

Stubbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/Gen/Buzz_Story.aspx?ci=522385|title=R&B Singer Tevin Campbell Joins the Cast of B'way's Hairspray|last=David|first=Cara Joy|date=2005-12-06|website=Broadway.com|access-date=2008-07-27}}</ref> Campbell later reprised his role of Seaweed in the Broadway play in the Melbourne and Sydney productions in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hairspraythemusical.com.au/cast.html#cast2|title=Hairspray The Musical - Australia|date=2010-08-04|website=Hairspraythemusical.com.au|access-date=2011-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815233509/http://www.hairspraythemusical.com.au/cast.html#cast2|archive-date=2011-08-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>
He worked with the production up until 2011. During 2006 to 2007, Campbell made few public appearances, due to his commitment to Broadway. In May 2008, Campbell released an internet album entitled, ''2008, Never Before Heard'' through Rambo House Media and the album was released to [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] as a means of test marketing some material originally recorded in 2002. After six months of availability, Campbell decided to no longer allow the unpublished material to be downloaded online, and the music can no longer be heard or purchased on these sites. As of 2019, it is unknown if Campbell will ever re-release said unpublished material.

===2009–2013: Singing career===

The remake featured Usher, [[Robin Thicke]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[LL Cool J]] and [[Barry White]]. [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]'s show ''Life After'' featured Campbell's life and career, as well as updates on his comeback. From 2011 to 2012, Campbell made small appearances here and there.
