The album received an 8.3 by Jillian Mapes on Pitchfork. Mapes described their new sounds as "echoing second-wave emo sourness (“Your Heart”), Britpop jangle (“She Goes By”), and classic alt-rock loud-quiet-loudness throughout".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23213-powerplant/|title=Girlpool - Powerplant|last=Mapes|first=Jillian|date=12 May 2017|website=Pitchfork|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 March 2019}}</ref> In Summer 2017, Avery Tucker came out as a [[trans man]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/ywxy4g/girlpool-new-frontboy-cleo-tucker|title=meet cleo tucker, girlpool's new frontboy|website=[[i-D]]|last=field|first=Lauren|date=May 3, 2018|access-date=May 10, 2021|language=en}}</ref>

Their harmonies are some of my favourites that are out there.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1981194/girlpool-picturesong-feat-dev-hynes/music/|title=Girlpool – "Picturesong" (Feat.

On March 12, 2020, Girlpool released the single "Like I'm Winning It" and an accompanying music video. Tucker said about the song: <blockquote>"‘Like I'm Winning It’ is about power and lust: How can the weight of someone’s attention feel so heavy just because of its scarcity? This is a song about playing with that line—the line between the electricity in receiving attention and what’s unattainable."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/girlpool-share-video-for-new-song-like-im-winning-it-watch/|title=Girlpool Share Video for New Song "Like I’m Winning It": Watch|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=March 12, 2020|access-date=May 11, 2021|language=en}}</ref></blockquote> Shortly after the release of the single, Tucker and Tividad were forced to self-isolate due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2020/03/24/girlpool-activities-list-covid-quarantine-interview-2020|title=Here’s how to self-isolate like Girlpool|website=[[The Fader]]|last=D'Souza|first=Shaad|date=March 24, 2020|access-date=May 18, 2021|language=en}}</ref>

On May 1, 2020 Girlpool released ''Chaos Demos'', a collection of demos for songs from their previous studio album, on their Bandcamp.

==Musical style and influences==
Tividad has cited alternative rock bands such as [[Cocteau Twins]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] as influences, as well as 2010s solo acts such as [[Charli XCX]] and [[Tyler, the Creator]].<ref name=Shaad>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/07/09/girlpool-current-mood-fantasie-playlist-mix-listen-2019|title=Girlpool’s Fantasie mix is a romantic trip through pop history|publisher=The Fader|date=9 July 2019|accessdate=2 May 2021|first=Shaad |last=D'Souza}}</ref> ''[[The Fader]]'''s Shaad D'Souza said that "Los Angeles duo Girlpool write songs about change, and the things we gain or leave behind when moving from one part of life to another."<ref name=Shaad /> The band is also often compared to [[The Shaggs]], a band notable for their perceived ineptitude at playing conventional rock music. In an article about the Shaggs, Matt McMahon from [[The Observer (Notre Dame)|The Observer]] states: "The band most inspiring this spiritual connection [to The Shaggs] is Girlpool, a stripped back punk duo with a penchant for raw instrumentation and emotive harmonies".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-09-24|title=Is it time to give The Shaggs another listen? // The Observer|url=https://ndsmcobserver.com/2015/09/time-give-shaggs-another-listen/|access-date=2021-11-20|website=The Observer|language=en}}</ref>
