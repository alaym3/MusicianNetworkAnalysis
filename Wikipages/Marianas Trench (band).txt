==History==
===''Marianas Trench'' & ''Fix Me'' (2001–2007)===
The band recorded and released a self-titled EP in 2001. It contained songs which would later be added onto their debut album, ''[[Fix Me]]''.

In 2006, the band released their debut full-length studio album entitled ''[[Fix Me]]''. It included the singles "Say Anything", "Decided to Break It", and the hit single "[[Shake Tramp]]". Before the album was released, a song named "Fix Me" was on it and was later taken out, because "Say Anything" supposedly sounded more like a single.

The album was engineered and mixed by Mike Fraser and the band performed concerts nationwide to promote the album, alongside [[Faber Drive]].
