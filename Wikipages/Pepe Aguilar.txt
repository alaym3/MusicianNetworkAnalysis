==Early life and career==
Pepe Aguilar was born to [[Antonio Aguilar]] and [[Flor Silvestre]] in [[San Antonio]], Texas, on August 7, 1968, while his parents were on [[Concert tour|tour]]. Although born in the United States, he was raised in Zacatecas, Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pepe Aguilar Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/pepe-aguilar-mn0000836103/biography |website=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[TiVo Corporation]] |access-date=May 26, 2019}}</ref> Aguilar made his debut as a singer at the age of three, when his father, Antonio, had a concert at the [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pepe Aguilar: Dejando Huellas en la Canción Mexicana|url=https://impactolatino.com/pepe-aguilar-dejando-huellas-en-la-cancion-mexicana/|access-date=October 28, 2017|work=Impacto Latino|date=May 12, 2012|language=es}}</ref> As a teenager, Aguilar was a rock music fan and had a band called "Equs". The band did not last long, but that led him to make his first album. Aguilar's musical influences were [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Who]], among other rock bands.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Castenada|first1=Roberto|title=Pepe Aguilar, un charro pogresivo|url=http://archivo.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/58183.html|access-date=October 28, 2017|work=El Universal|date=December 21, 2004|language=es}}</ref> Nevertheless, while leaving his teenage years behind, he turned to Mexican Regional music once again, mixing the traditional style with his modern pop influences and becoming a strong identity in the Latin scene, in addition to developing a successful acting career.

===1989–1990 album releases===
Aguilar began his career as a solo artist in 1989 with the launch of "Pepe Aguilar Con Tambora", and later released special editions. In 1992, Aguilar recorded his first [[mariachi]] album titled "Recuérdame Bonito", produced by Mexican singer-songwriter [[Joan Sebastian]]. He subsequently released "Que Bueno" and "Chiquilla Bonita" in 1993 and 1994.

After refusing to release an album due to legal disputes between Aguilar and his record label, in July 1998, he released "Por Mujeres Como Tú", which transformed him into a household name in Mexico and Latin America.

On February 9, 1999, the album "Por El Amor De Siempre" was released. This CD was composed of songs from the 1970s from singers like [[Camilo Sesto]], [[Napoleon]], Ricardo Cerato y [[José José]], and others. Pepe took a new spin on these old songs, and it was met with success. This was the album that solidified his career.

By October 19, 1999, millions of copies had been sold. Many singles were played on the radio. It was the first Grammy on the category of "Mejor Álbum Regional Mexicano."

===2000–2006 album releases===
[[File:PepeAguilarCharro.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pepe Aguilar Dress like a [[Charro]]]]
In the year 2000, he made a tribute to the great artists before him. Pepe did this CD as a thank to "las voces más representativas de la época de oro en el género ranchero," such as [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Javier Solis]], [[Miguel Aceves Mejía]], and [[Vicente Fernandez]].

It was the first CD to record "Lo Mejor De Nosotros," again with unedited songs and making teamwork with Fato. His song "Me Vas a Extrañar" occupies the first places in the territories where there was promotion.

On March 25, 2003, he produced "Y Tenerte Otra Vez," which became his first work with his own recording studio, "Equinoccio Records," and his licence with [[Univision]] includes songs like "Me Falta Valor," “Yo La Amo," and "A Pierna Suelta.”

In 2003, he made a special tribute to his parents with "Con Orgullo Por Herencia." It recognized songs of his parents Antonio Aguilar and Flor Silvestre. In 2004, he produced the official song for Big Brother México, "Miedo," which became a big production of Pepe's, who had not sung an original song in 15 years.<ref>Billboard – April 30, 2005 – Page 12 "FATO ("Miedo," performed by Pepe Aguilar and Palomo, and "El Autobus," performed by Aguilar) "Miedo" was inspired by my nephew Jorge de la Torre, a great singer and composer who died n months ago. He was in the process of accepting ..."</ref>

“No Soy De Nadie," a CD, was published on August 31, 2004. "El Autobús" was a hit song from this CD. This CD included work from great songwriters like [[Juan Gabriel]], Luís Demetrio, Jesús Monarrez, and it also included his own song writing.

In 2005, with the album "Historias De Mi Tierra," he made a tribute to El Corrido. Songs like "Dos Amigos," “El Federal De Caminos," and "El Corrido de Chihuahua" are included in this work. The CD gave Pepe another Latin Grammy for 'Mejor Álbum Ranchero' and gave him another American Grammy for 'Mejor Álbum Mexicano Americano'.

On August 15, 2006, the CD "Enamorado," the second part of "Por El Amor De Siempre" (1999) was released, and in it is the main song of the Novela "Destilando Amor," called "Por Amarte." The CD was given another Latin Grammy in the category of 'Mejor Álbum Ranchero' in 2007. In 2009, Pepe asked his fans to not buy his albums from the company Musart, as they were only copies and did not financially benefit him.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Aguilar received the 2,474th star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on July 26, 2012, located at 7060 Hollywood Blvd., which was placed next to the star of his father.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pepe Aguilar ya tiene estrella en Hollywood|url=http://peopleenespanol.com/article/pepe-aguilar-ya-tiene-estrella-en-hollywood/|access-date=October 28, 2017|work=[[People en Espanol]]|date=July 26, 2012|language=es}}</ref>

==As a businessman==
Like a businessman and artist who is independent, he has his own record label (Equinoccio Records) and studio with the highest technology in Latin America. He has also gone to the movement of fashion. In 2009 he took out his own fashion line called "Pepe Aguilar Línea de Calzado," which debuted for men and women. To celebrate this and share yet another aspect of his life with his fans, he launched his "Pepe Aguilar Signature Collection" through WSS [[Warehouse Shoe Sale]] retailer in the United States. In addition, his dream of helping his native Mexico in some way has given way to an eco-friendly agricultural project in which Aguilar will strengthen and promote the organic production of crops in communities in [[Zacatecas]], using traditional practices and technology that will have a positive impact on the environment.

==Personal life==
Pepe Aguilar was born into a musical family. His father, [[Antonio Aguilar]], was an iconic [[regional Mexican]] singer who sold over 25 million records and is credited with being one of the pioneers in bringing [[charro]] and [[mariachi]] culture to international audiences. His mother, [[Flor Silvestre]], is also an iconic regional Mexican singer and was one of the leading ladies in what is considered the golden era of Mexican cinema.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/mexico/articles/the-golden-age-of-mexican-cinema-a-short-history/|title = The Golden Age of Mexican Cinema: A Short History}}</ref> He is the nephew of singers [[La Prieta Linda]] and [[Mary Jiménez]], his mother's younger sisters. He has four siblings: [[Antonio Aguilar, hijo|Antonio Aguilar Jr.]], [[Dalia Inés]], Francisco Rubiales, and [[Marcela Rubiales]]. He married Aneliz Aguilar Alvarez, who at one point was kidnapped along with his brother and held for ransom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/pepe-aguilar-_n_3893529.html|title=WATCH: Mexican Singer Talks Wife's Kidnapping on Mario Lopez's New Show|date=September 9, 2013}}</ref>  He has four children: Emiliano Aguilar, Aneliz Aguilar, [[Leonardo Aguilar]], and [[Ángela Aguilar]].
