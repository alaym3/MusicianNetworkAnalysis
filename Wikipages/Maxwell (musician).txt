==Career==

===1990-1994: Beginnings===
After receiving a low-cost [[Casio keyboard]] from a friend, the Brooklyn, New York-native began composing music at age 17.<ref name="Huey"/><ref name="Brennan">Brennan (2002), pp.&nbsp;132–133.</ref> Already a fan of what he described as "[[jheri curl]] [[Soul music|soul]]", which was the trademark of early 1980s [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] acts such as [[Patrice Rushen]], [[The SOS Band|S.O.S. Band]] and [[Rose Royce]], Maxwell began to teach himself to play a variety of instruments.<ref name="Brennan"/> According to him, the R&B of the early 1980s contained "the perfect combination of computerized instrumentation with a live feel", and that the genre's dynamics later became lost due to the influence of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] on R&B.<ref name="Adams">Adams (1998), pp. 172–173.</ref> Despite facing ridicule from classmates for being shy and awkward, he progressed and continued to develop his musical abilities, and he also adopted the look of a more [[bohemian style]] outwardly in his clothing, growing long sideburns and letting his hair grow out wildly and combed in an extreme style, or sometimes putting his hair in long thin braids.<ref name="Huey"/>

Initially influenced by early-1980s urban R&B, Maxwell progressed rapidly, and by 1991 he was performing on the New York City club scene.  Maxwell was able to gain access to a [[Multitrack recording|24-track]] recording studio and started to record songs for a [[demo tape]], which he circulated among his friends.<ref name="Adams"/>  The demo engendered interest, and his official debut concert performance at Manhattan nightclub [[Nell's]] drew a crowd.<ref name="Adams"/> During the next two years, Maxwell wrote and recorded over three hundred songs and played frequently at small venues throughout New York City.<ref name="Brennan"/> Maxwell's performances continued to draw interest and increase the buzz about him, and he was called "the next [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]" by a writer from ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' magazine who attended one of his shows.<ref name="Adams"/> After earning a considerable reputation, Maxwell signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] in 1994. He adopted his middle name as a [[moniker]] out of respect for his family's privacy.<ref name="Huey"/>

===1994-1997: ''Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite''===
Maxwell began working with songwriter [[Leon Ware]] and noted guitarist [[Wah Wah Watson]] to record his debut ''[[Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite]]'' in the mid 1990s. Recording sessions for the album took place in 1994 and 1995 at [[Electric Lady Studios]], RPM Studios, Sorcerer Studios and [[Chung King Studios]] in New York City, and at [[Chicago Recording Company|CRC Studios]] in Chicago, Illinois.<ref name="Brennan"/><ref name=note>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080808222107/http://www.tower.com/maxwells-urban-hang-suite-maxwell-cd/wapi/106694214 Product Page: ''Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite''].

===1998-2002: ''Embrya'' and ''Now''===
Maxwell's second studio album, ''[[Embrya]]'', was released on June 30, 1998, and upon its release it was panned by contemporary [[music journalism|music critics]].<ref name="Hinds">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA108|access-date=May 5, 2013|title=Inner Vision|journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|location=New York|pages=104–10|date=April 2001|first=Sewlyn|last=Seyfu Hinds}}</ref> The album received mixed criticism for its more "indulgent sound."<ref name="Huey"/> With its internal focus and esoteric grooves, the album served as a departure for Maxwell, who did not regret risking his reputation with urban listeners for a more challenging record.<ref name="Hinds"/> The album experienced a critical backlash similar to that of other artists' work that broke their previous releases' successful formulas in favor of more compelling projects, now being termed "[[neo-soul]]."<ref name="Neal">Neal (2003), p. 117.</ref> In 1999, it won the [[Soul Train Music Award]] for Best Male Soul/R&B Album.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000917150200/http://www.allyourtv.com/awards/awardssoultrain14th.html 14th Annual Soul Train Award Winners] ''allyourtv.com/awards/''  March 6, 2000</ref> In a retrospective review for [[Allmusic]], [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that Maxwell "overstuffs his songs with ideas that lead nowhere" and called ''Embrya'' "a bit of a sophomore stumble, albeit one with promising moments." Arion Berger, writing in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004), found the songs monotonous and called the album "unfocused and pretentious ... full of overwrought, underwritten songs with obscure, fancy titles revolving around a sort of sexual [[gnosticism]]."{{sfn|Berger et al.|2004|p=521}}  Critics have since reappraised ''Embrya'' as a groundbreaking forerunner to later trends in [[Alternative R&B]], and Columbia Records reissued the album in 2018 on its 20th Anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.okayplayer.com/music/maxwell-interview-okayplayer.html |title=Maxwell Talks Social Media, Making Politically Charged Music & What The Legacy Of 'Embrya' Is 20 Years Later  |last1=Ani |first1=Ivie |date=June 2018 |website=[[Okayplayer]] |access-date=October 17, 2020}}</ref>

In commenting on the "new soul revival" in music, Maxwell told ''Entertainment Weekly'' in 1997 that "everything out there musically was inspired or influenced by something from the past. It's not about creating some super-fresh new thing. If it doesn't lend itself to your history, how is it going to extend to your future? That's what's really brilliant about looking into children's eyes—you can see their parents in them."<ref name="Adams"/> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called him "the Marvin Gaye of the '90s".<ref name="Harrington2"/> Its columnist wrote that ''Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite'' "heralded the arrival of a top-of-the-class graduate of the old school of soul, one who could sing about romantic aspiration and tribulation with heart-wrenching emotion. It was as if the aesthetic that Gaye ascribed to — 'music that has feeling, hope and meaning – all the things people are looking for' — had been rediscovered after a long, hedonistic interlude."<ref name="Harrington2">Harrington, Richard.

Maxwell's role in writing and producing the album exhibited a level of artistic control by an R&B artist that was uncommon in the recording industry at the time.<ref name="Brennan"/> On his emergence with ''Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite'', writer Carol Brennan cited him, along with the [[Fugees]], D'Angelo and [[Tony Rich]], as neo soul musicians that "exhibited the identifying characteristics of this new breed of R&B artists: lyrics that give voice to intense personal expression, creative control over the music, and a unexpectedly successful debut."<ref name="Brennan"/>
