'''Brand New''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Formed in 2000, the band consists of [[Jesse Lacey]] (vocals, guitar), Vincent Accardi (guitar, vocals), Garrett Tierney (bass guitar, vocals), and Brian Lane (drums, percussion); they were joined by Benjamin Homola (percussion) for their live performances.<ref name="bandbio">{{cite web |url = http://www.fightoffyourdemons.com/bio.html |title = Brand New Biography |access-date = 2006-02-18 |year = 2006 |publisher = Brand New – Official website|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060218082714/http://www.fightoffyourdemons.com/bio.html |archive-date = February 18, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> From 2005 to 2013, the band also included Derrick Sherman (guitar, backing vocals, keyboards).<ref name="streetinterview">{{cite web|last1=Tate|first1=Jason|title=Street Team Exclusive Interview|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showpost.php?p=4303747&postcount=41|website=absolutepunk.net|publisher=[[Absolute Punk]]|access-date=17 October 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130221042409/http://www.absolutepunk.net/showpost.php?p=4303747&postcount=41|archive-date=February 21, 2013 |date=19 September 2006}}</ref> The band is recognized as one of the most influential within the 2000s [[emo]] scene, celebrated for making artistic statements with their music.<ref name=":7" />

During the late 1990s in [[Levittown, New York]], [[Jesse Lacey]], Garrett Tierney and Brian Lane were all members of the band the Rookie Lot. They eventually split off from the other members of the group, and in 2000 formed Brand New in [[Merrick, New York]].<ref name="bandbio" /> The band signed to [[Triple Crown Records]] and in 2001 released their debut [[studio album]], ''[[Your Favorite Weapon]]''. Their second album, ''[[Deja Entendu]]'', was released in 2003 and marked a stylistic change for the band, one that garnered an extremely positive critical reception.<ref>{{Citation|title=Deja Entendu by Brand New|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/deja-entendu/brand-new|language=en|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref> The album's first two singles, "[[The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows]]" and "[[Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades]]", both received airplay on [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse TV]], entering the top 40 on the [[UK Singles Chart|United Kingdom Singles Chart]]. ''Deja Entendu'' was eventually certified gold in the [[Recording Industry Association of America|United States]].

Brand New moved to [[Interscope Records]] and released the critically acclaimed ''[[The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me]]'' in 2006. "Jesus Christ" became their highest charting single in the US, peaking at number 30 on the [[Alternative Songs]] chart. In March 2008, the band started their own record label, named [[Procrastinate! Music Traitors]]. Their fourth album, ''[[Daisy (Brand New album)|Daisy]]'', was released in 2009 and became their highest charting album in the US at the time, reaching number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band released two non-album singles following ''Daisy'', "[[Mene (Brand New song)|Mene]]" in April 2015 and "[[I Am a Nightmare]]" in May 2016. Brand New surprise-released their fifth and final album ''[[Science Fiction (Brand New album)|Science Fiction]]'' on August 17, 2017, two days after announcing its release on vinyl. Receiving both critical acclaim and commercial success, it became Brand New's first number-one album on the ''Billboard'' 200.

Frontman Jesse Lacey had stated that the band would disband in 2018, following t-shirt designs and lyric books which suggested that possibility.<ref name=":8">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/brand-new-breaking-up-2154078|title=Brand New reveal when they are breaking up - NME|date=2017-10-27|work=NME|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}</ref> 

==History==

===Formation and ''Your Favorite Weapon'' (2000–2002)===
Prior to Brand New's official formation, in the late 1990s, [[Jesse Lacey]], Garrett Tierney and Brian Lane were all members of the [[post-hardcore]] band the Rookie Lot, along with [[Brandon Reilly (musician)|Brandon Reilly]] and Alex Dunne of [[Crime in Stereo]]. The Rookie Lot split and did not play for a while until Lacey, Lane and Tierney started to rehearse again. After Reilly joined [[the Movielife]], they then recruited guitarist Vincent Accardi, who had been playing in a band called One Last Goodbye.<ref name="bandbio" /><ref name="Absinter">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=23568|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130221032400/http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=23568|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-21|title=Brand New interview – 08.14.03|website=[[AbsolutePunk]]|first=Jason|last=Tate|access-date=2009-07-23}}</ref>

All four members had backgrounds linking into their local Long Island [[Independent music|independent]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] [[Indie music scene|music scenes]], but with influences from an array of artists ranging from [[Buddy Rich]] to the [[Archers of Loaf]]. They eventually formed Brand New in 2000, in a basement in [[Merrick, New York]]. Their initial intention was always to "move outside of whatever notions they felt inclined to when they were making music as younger people."<ref name="bandbio" /> The band gained exposure in the local scene through playing shows with [[alternative rock]] contemporaries [[Midtown (band)|Midtown]] and [[post-hardcore]] bands like [[Glassjaw]], while also self-releasing a four-song demo.<ref name="Absinter"/><ref name="amgbio"/> They signed to [[Triple Crown Records]] just after their second-ever show.<ref name="News">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/ny-ffmus3431963aug31,0,12784.story?coll=ny-music-utility|title=Long Island Sounds|work=[[Newsday]]|access-date=2009-07-23|archive-date=October 10, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031010185551/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/ny-ffmus3431963aug31%2C0%2C12784.story?coll=ny-music-utility|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Brand New's debut [[studio album]] ''[[Your Favorite Weapon]]'' was produced by friend of the band [[Mike Sapone]].<ref name="bandbio" /><ref name="amgbio"/> The album has been described as being "bitter about ex-girlfriends", with an excessive concentration on "post-breakup angst". It received relatively positive reviews, with [[Allmusic]] awarding it three out of five and [[Popmatters]] also being favorable.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r554950|pure_url=yes}}|title=Your Favorite Weapon|website=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=2009-07-23}}</ref><ref name="Popm">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/brandnew-yourfavorite/|title=Brand New – Your Favorite Weapon|magazine=[[Popmatters]]|access-date=2009-07-23}}</ref> It became a moderate success, selling over 50,000 copies.<ref name="ChartA">{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/2006/11/21/brand-new/|title=Are Brand New Becoming A Prog-Rock Band?|work=[[Chart (magazine)|ChartAttack]]|access-date=2009-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222206/http://www.chartattack.com/news/2006/11/21/brand-new/|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Mara">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1475456/20030805/brand_new.jhtml|title=Brand New Singer Goes Long, Fears Turning Into Soccer Star Maradona|publisher=MTV|access-date=2009-07-22}}</ref> The record deal gave Brand New the opportunity to tour, playing alongside the likes of [[Taking Back Sunday]] and touring the UK in support of [[Finch (US band)|Finch]], to a "great response" from the crowds.<ref name="amgbio">{{cite web |url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p511016|pure_url=yes}} |title = Brand New: Biography |access-date = 2008-03-22 |author = Hopkin, Kenyon|website = [[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name="South">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/southampton/music/brandnew_iview.shtml |title=Brand New interview |publisher=BBC |access-date=2009-07-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828112044/http://www.bbc.co.uk/southampton/music/brandnew_iview.shtml |archive-date=August 28, 2007 }}</ref>

The only single released from ''Your Favorite Weapon'' was "Jude Law and a Semester Abroad". The song has been described by [[Allmusic]] as a "semi-hit"<ref name="amgbio"/> after it received airplay on both [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse TV|Fuse]].

===''Deja Entendu'' and acclaim (2003–2004)===
[[File:Brand New Dec 06 Toronto.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Jesse Lacey]] performing in Toronto during December 2006.]]

Brand New's second studio album was written in the "year and-a-half or two years" that they were touring the material off of ''Your Favorite Weapon''. According to drummer Brian Lane, "Jesse [Lacey] wrote a lot of the lyrics about different things than 'I just broke up with my girlfriend' for the new record,"<ref name="Billfeat1">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68926/brand-new|title=Brand New|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author=Barry A. Jeckell|date=September 29, 2003|access-date=2009-07-18}}</ref> as Lacey had written the songs on an [[acoustic guitar]] in his bedroom.<ref name="Already"/> Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists: "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first [album] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that has a lot to do with it." Unlike their first album, it was said that a lot of time and concentration went into making the album.<ref name="Billfeat"/>

The band released ''[[Deja Entendu]]'' through [[Razor & Tie]]/[[Triple Crown Records]] in June 2003, being issued in Europe and Australia in October 2003.<ref name="Bits"/> The album's title, ''Deja Entendu'', is [[French language|French]] for "already heard." It was explained as "very tongue-in-cheek" by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told [[MTV]], "No matter who you are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'" He reinforced, "We're not trying to break new ground in music. We're just trying to make good music."<ref name="Already">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472833/20030618/brand_new.jhtml|title=Already Heard of Underground Upstarts Brand New? Consider Yourself Lucky|publisher=MTV|first=Joe|last=D'Angelo|access-date=2009-07-24}}</ref> The album was described as a "stylistic leap" from ''Your Favorite Weapon'', with a "decidedly matured" sound.<ref name="amgbio"/> In an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Lacey said that although ''Deja Entendu'' does offer a different sound, the album "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that we had a lot of potential and there's a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there."<ref name="Bits">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69263/billboard-bits-brand-new-vida-blue-kristofferson|title=Billboard Bits: Brand New, Vida Blue, Kristofferson|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=2009-07-18}}</ref>

''Deja Entendu'' debuted at number 63 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="albumchart">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=brand new|chart=Billboard 200}}|title=Brand New Albums & Song Chart History – Billboard 200|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=2009-07-24}}</ref> After just seven weeks, the album's sales were at more than 51,000 copies, already closing in on the total figure of its predecessor, ''Your Favorite Weapon''.<ref name="Mara"/> In May 2007, four years after its release, it was certified [[List of music recording sales certifications|gold]] for surpassing 500,000 sales in the United States by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Brand%20New&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold & Platinum – Deja Entendu|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=2009-01-09|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151731/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Brand%20New&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archive-date=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''Deja Entendu'''s first single, "[[The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows]]", impacted radio airplay in July 2003, a month after the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." The song's [[music video]] chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change".<ref name="Already"/> They also made a music video for the second single, "[[Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades]]," where Lacey acts like a human [[voodoo doll]], discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," he said, "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where ''Your Favorite Weapon'' went "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding "constant" airplay on [[MTV]] and the band making its live television debut on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.<ref name="amgbio" /><ref name="Billfeat">{{cite magazine|last1=Jeckell|first1=Barry A|title=Brand New|url=https://www.billboard.com/|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=18 July 2009|format=Interview|date=29 September 2003}}</ref><ref name="Voodoo">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480306/20031110/brand_new.jhtml|title=Brand New Eschew Rocking For Voodoo – Frontman exhibits supernatural powers in new video.|first=Joe|last=D'Angelo|publisher=MTV|access-date=2009-07-18}}</ref> Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="UK">{{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_B.HTM|title=Chart Log UK: Brand New|publisher=Zobbel.de|access-date=2009-06-23}}</ref> whilst "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" peaked at number 37 on ''Billboard's'' [[Alternative Songs]] chart.<ref name="singleschart">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=brand new|chart=Alternative Songs}}|title=Brand New Albums & Song Chart History – Alternative Songs|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=2009-07-24}}</ref>

Three shows of the band's 24-date headlining US tour with [[Moneen]], [[Senses Fail]], and [[the Beautiful Mistake]] had sold out prior to even having released a single, with much of the buzz surrounding the band being produced by just [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], touring and Internet [[Internet forum|message boards]].<ref name="Already"/> ''Deja Entendu'''s success also earned them tours alongside [[New Found Glory]], [[Good Charlotte]], [[Dashboard Confessional]], and [[Blink-182]].<ref name="amgbio" /> The band went on to headline [[The Bamboozle]] festival with [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Alkaline Trio]], [[Thrice]], [[the Starting Line]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[the Bouncing Souls]], [[Straylight Run]] and [[Flogging Molly]].<ref name="My chem">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1496226/20050125/my_chemical_romance.jhtml|title=My Chemical Romance, Brand New, Thrice To Headline Bamboozle Fest On Jersey Shore|publisher=MTV|access-date=2009-07-25}}</ref> They also made their second trip to the UK in 2004, their first as the headline act, and the tour completely sold out.<ref name="South"/>

In the wake of ''Deja Entendu'', Brand New was pegged as an act to watch in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'''s annual "Hot Issue."<ref name="Billfeat"/> The band topped punk critics' year-end lists with the "genre-defying" ''Deja Entendu'',<ref name="Devilattack">{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/reviews/61038/brand-new|title=Brand New – The Devil And God Are Raging Inside Me|work=[[Chart (magazine)|ChartAttack]]|access-date=2009-07-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714092500/http://www.chartattack.com/reviews/61038/brand-new|archive-date=July 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and the album was described as a "landmark album of so-called 'emo-punk'."<ref name="Green">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609727/20090421/green_day.jhtml|title=Earth Day Albums: 10 Overlooked LPs That Deserve Recycling|publisher=MTV|access-date=2009-07-25}}</ref> As a result of both the album's success and the band's notable underground following, Brand New found itself in the middle of a bidding war from record labels.<ref name="amgbio" /><ref name="News"/><ref name="Bits"/> At the time, Lane disagreed with the usage of the phrase "bidding war", but conceded, "There's a few labels that are definitely interested.

Following their signing to Interscope, Brand New stopped touring to work on their third album and major label debut. In this time, little to no interviews or updates came from the band.<ref name="amgbio" /> In 2004, Jesse Lacey told ''[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]'' magazine that he had written a "few songs" for the next album, commenting that "the other guys love it already". He made mention of the pressure he felt with the "loads of anticipation building up on my shoulders," saying that he suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] because of this; "I'm getting depressed with all of the anxiety about the album and they say I write my best stuff when I'm in that state. Great, I'll spend the next six months all depressed and the rest of band will be excited, so that some good [material] might come out. And then I have to contend with how it's received." Lacey also said that the album would "move into new territory for Brand New".<ref name="ChartA"/>

In late 2005, Brand New started recording their highly anticipated third album in [[Oxford, Mississippi]] with producer [[Dennis Herring]], but later dropped him in favor of [[Mike Sapone]] with whom they had worked on their first album.<ref name="bandbio" />

But I was also worried that it would derail the process because the four of us had created a pretty safe place where the only critics were ourselves. As much as we tried to shield ourselves from letting the leak affect us, it definitely did. There was a feeling of being robbed, after keeping everything so close to ourselves and then having it heard before it was completed."

In January 2006, [[Leaked Demos 2006|nine tracks recorded for the album were leaked to the Internet]]. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated "I would say it did it in a good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I was under the impression that those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever."<ref name="Leadint">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showpost.php?p=4303747|title=Brand New Interview|website=[[AbsolutePunk]]|access-date=2009-07-28}}</ref>

In the following months, with Brand New doing their first tour dates in over 18 months, a few songs from the demos were performed with a full band, some were fleshed out and had new lyrics. New songs had their debut as well during the summer tour dates. Brand New began their first tour in years on June 20, 2006, where Lacey stated that the album had been completed the previous day.

''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' published a preliminary date of October 10, 2006, as the album's release date; this was later corrected on the band's official website, when it was announced that the new album would be released on November 21, 2006 in [[North America]], and the day before in Europe. Soon after, a track listing and cover art were revealed, as well as new information regarding the release of the first single – "[[Sowing Season]]". Having previously been leaked as a demo, the completed song began airing on radio on October 19, 2006, and appeared on their [[MySpace]] page a day later. According to Lacey in a radio interview from the UK ([[BBC Radio 1]] with [[Zane Lowe]]), the title ''[[The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me]]'' is taken from a conversation he had with his friend about the musician [[Daniel Johnston]], who has [[bipolar disorder]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Zane Lowe interview with Jesse Lacey |first = Zane |last = Lowe |publisher = [[BBC Radio 1]] }}</ref> ''The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me'' has since become Brand New's most critically acclaimed album and is considered one of the best albums of the 2000s.<ref name="NME">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/list/the-top-100-greatest-albums-of-the-decade/158049/page/3|title=The Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade <nowiki>|</nowiki> nme.com|work=[[NME|nme.com]]|access-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/blog/?p=1993|title=Sputnikmusic – Top 100 Albums of the Decade (30 – 11) « Staff Blog|date=June 10, 2010|work=[[Sputnikmusic]]|access-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref>

In late December 2006, an unusual video was released for the instrumental track "Untitled", also known as "-", which consists of a man [[Graffiti|spray painting]] a wall with "evil and good are raging inside me" and correcting it to give the album title.

From January to June 2007, the band toured the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia, including a headline slot on the UK's [[Give It A Name]] festival and playing the main stage at [[The Bamboozle]] festival. Despite the band's reluctance towards the press around the time of the release of the album, they were featured in ''Alternative Press'', a cover story for ''[[Rock Sound]]'', ''[[Kerrang!]]'', and ''[[NME]]''. The band went on tour for the fall of 2007, with openers [[Thrice]] and [[MewithoutYou]]. In early 2008, Brand New toured Australia and New Zealand on the [[Big Day Out]] festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/163743/Big-Day-Out-line-up-finalised|title=Big Day Out line-up finalised|website=Stuff|access-date=2017-07-29}}</ref>

In October 2007, the band announced via their official website that a new song, entitled "[[(Fork and Knife)]]", would be released online on October 23, 2007. "(Fork and Knife)", a rerecorded version of the track formerly known as "Untitled 7" from the leaked demos, was released as a non-album [[music download|digital download]].

In an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'', Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, "It's a pretty exhausting record. It's quite dense and I think some of the decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking a lot more about what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." He then questioned the future of the band, saying, "I think a lot of the record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on."<ref name="kerrang">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/34219|title=Brand New talks new album, future of the band|publisher=Punknews.org|access-date=2009-07-03}}</ref>

''Daisy'' debuted at number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US, selling 46,000 records in what was their first top 20 entrance on the chart after ''[[The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me]]'' had reached number 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267231/pearl-jam-scores-first-no-1-on-billboard-200-in-13-years|title=Pearl Jam Scores First No.&nbsp;1 On Billboard 200 in 13 Years|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Keith|last=Caulfield|access-date=2009-10-04}}</ref>

Brand New announced they would be bringing along [[Manchester Orchestra]], [[Thrice]], [[Glassjaw]], [[Sybris]], [[the Builders and the Butchers]], and [[Crime in Stereo]] on selected/rotating dates of their headlining Fall North American tour. On January 23, 2010, Brand New played their largest UK headline performance to date at London's Wembley Arena in front of 12,500 people. Support came from Glassjaw and Thrice.

When asked if rumors were true that ''Daisy'' would be the band's final release, Lacey replied "I don't think that will be true. It might be our last full-length record for a little while, but we've got a lot of things lined up that we want to record, so I think that will happen pretty soon."<ref name="dis">{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137854-i-like-talking-to-people---brand-news-jesse-lacey-chats-to-dis|title=I like talking to people.|work=[[Drowned in Sound]]|access-date=2009-09-17|archive-date=October 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012113752/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137854-i-like-talking-to-people---brand-news-jesse-lacey-chats-to-dis|url-status=dead}}</ref> In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record." Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches."<ref name="rocksound">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/features/article/brand-new-look-ahead-to-wembley1|title= Brand New Look Ahead To Wembley.| work=[[Rock Sound]]|access-date=2010-01-21}}</ref>
