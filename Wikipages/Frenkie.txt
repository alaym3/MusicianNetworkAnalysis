==Life and music career==
{{refimprove | section|date=March 2021}}
===Early life===
Adnan Hamidović was born in [[Bijeljina]] on 31 May 1982, where he has lived until 1992, when the [[Bosnian War]] started. After escaping the war, he settled with his family in [[Nuremberg|Nürnberg]], [[Germany]] until 1998. There he was first introduced to hip-hop culture, and he started to make hip-hop music and do graffiti. His first rap lyrics were in German. [[German hip-hop]] has influenced his style of rap throughout his career and he remains influenced by it. After returning to Bosnia, he went to [[Tuzla]] and continued with his graffiti, making him one of the first to make hip-hop related graffiti art after the war.

===Early career===
In 1999, with the beginning of the station ''[[Fmjam]]'' on [[Radio Kameleon]], he befriended DJ Soul and Erol, who started Fmjam and the first hip-hop demo singles. Frenkie, Koma, Ady started the group "Prljavi Anđeli" (Dirty Angels).

Then later that same year, "Disciplinska Komisija" (DK) was formed. At the time of the formation the members were: spearhead of the group [[Edo Maajka]], Frenkie, Hamaz, Mire, Koma and their DJ Soul. Edo Maajka released his popular album "[[Slusaj Mater]]" and started tours and concerts, during which he was joined by Frenkie. Frenkie is known for his fast rapping and energy. On Edo Maajka's second studio album "[[No Sikiriki]]", Frenkie is featured on two songs, establishing himself even more.

===Recent activity===
Frenkie's first album, ''[[Odličan CD]]'', was released in 2005. It included the singles "Bruce Lee Rap" with Baby Dooks and "Raise" with Defence. Frenkie's second album, ''[[DOSTA!]]'', featuring his beat maker King Mire from [[Brčko (city)|Brčko]], was released in June 2006 and was dedicated to the movement of the same name, which is gaining popularity in Bosnia. Singles from the album include "Rat Savezu" which was dedicated to the Bosnian Soccer Fans "BHFANATICOS" in their war against the corrupt Bosnian Football Federation; Frenkie has released a video clip for this hit song. He has also released a video for "Mr Policeman". In 2007, radio station 202 was fined 5,000 euros by the Bosnian organization RAK for Frenkie's song "Mr. Policeman", a song talking about corrupt police forces. After that fine, Frenkie released a song in response to RAK on FMJam called "Massiv", which criticizes and mocks this institution. The title track of his album, ''[[Povratak Cigana]]'' (2007), was released as its first single on FMJAM's website. It features Hamza, Frenkie's long time friend.

In addition to his solo work, Frenkie has featured on many Disciplinska Komisija songs such as "America 2" and "Ustaj", and on Edo Maajka's albums on "Ozezi", "Ne-Mo-Zes" and "Stvoren Za Rep".

In the summer of 2008, Frenkie's song 'Soundtrack' (from the album ''Odličan CD'') was used in the 2008 [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. The song was used in during a very rough cab driving scene featuring [[Edward Norton]] and [[Liv Tyler]].

Frenkie recorded a song with [[Masta Ace]] called ''Živili''. It was released on Frenkie's 2009 album ''[[Protuotrov]]''.

Frenkie is part of the Diversidad crew. Diversidad: A Unique European Urban Experience has a collective album gathering twenty rappers, beat-makers and DJs, which includes Frenkie.

After short tours, Frenkie released the EP #DNA with producer Billain in 2014. It was the first album in Bosnia that was released on vinyl.

To mark the 10 year anniversary of his debut album, Frenkie released the compilation album ''Reexperience'', which featured his greatest hits as well as new songs and remixed songs.

In September 2016, Frenkie, Kontra and producer Indigo released a collaborative album entitled ''Putanja''. The album was recorded in [[Red Bull Studios]] in Berlin and entirely produced by Indigo.
