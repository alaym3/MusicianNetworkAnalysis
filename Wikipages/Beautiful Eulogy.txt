Known for its experimental and eclectic sound, the group melds myriad styles of hip hop with genres such as [[folk music|folk]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[hymn tune]]s, and modern [[contemporary worship music|worship music]]. After contributing a song to the [[charity record|charity]] compilation ''King Kulture'' and making a guest appearance on [[Lecrae]]'s ''[[Church Clothes]]'', the band released its debut album, ''[[Satellite Kite]]'', on June 19, 2012. A second album, ''[[Instruments of Mercy]]'', came out on October 29, 2013. Called one of the most innovative hip hop groups in Portland, Beautiful Eulogy has met with critical acclaim, with particular praise directed at the group's creative, unconventional sound and deep theological lyrics.

==History==

Beautiful Eulogy formed during the recording sessions of rapper [[Braille (rapper)|Braille]]'s seventh studio album ''Native Lungs'' and Odd Thomas's planned second studio album ''Satellite Kite''. After Courtland Urbano agreed to produce Odd Thomas's planned album, the two traveled to [[Denver, Colorado]], to help produce Braille's album. The two wanted to form a production team, and during discussions over an interlude for ''Native Lungs'', they came up with the name "Beautiful Eulogy."<ref name="wade-o">{{Cite web |last=Daniels |first=David |date=October 29, 2013 |title=How Beautiful Eulogy United |url=http://wadeoradio.com/beautiful-eulogy-united/2/ |access-date=November 30, 2013 |website=Wade-O Radio |publisher=DJ Wade-O}}</ref> Thomas and Urbano returned to Portland and began working on the album art and production for ''Satellite Kite''.<ref name=wade-o /> At this juncture, Braille and Thomas, owners of the Humble Beast record label, realized that they could not run their label while working as separate artists in different parts of the country. This, combined with Braille's decision to not make an eighth solo studio album, led the three artists decided to combine their efforts, and Beautiful Eulogy was born.<ref name=wade-o />

Beautiful Eulogy first appeared on Christian hip hop website [[Rapzilla]]'s [[charity record|charity]] compilation ''King Kulture'', released January 31, 2012, on which the trio, along with fellow Humble Beast members Theory Hazit and Lee Green, performed the title track.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 19, 2012 |title=Beautiful Eulogy (Braille, Odd Thomas, Courtland Urbano) "King Kulture" feat.
