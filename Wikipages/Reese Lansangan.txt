== "Playing Pretend in the Interim" (EP), 2020 ==
Playing Pretend in the Interim<ref>{{Citation|title=Playing Pretend in the Interim|date=2020-10-30|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/4mndbQ78eezGpMt0lt9zy2|language=en|access-date=2021-05-04}}</ref>  is bold, playful, and the new Reese you never imagined. It is a five-track EP of songs completed during isolation. This is both a writing experiment and an examination of the self as a human living with and for others. She wrote these songs from different perspectives and characters (an encyclopedia salesman, a long-gone celebrity, a haunting ghost...) - seeing hyper-specific experiences with borrowed eyes. Itâ€™s a combination of research, imagination, secondhand stories, histories, and things she's heard and witnessed along the way. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lY6bIzAt96LKCk-fqnpyUpnV29LtbSkA0|date=2021-02-17|access-date=2021-05-04|language=en-US}}</ref> This EP is a way of escaping reality for a moment, allowing room for wonder and play.
