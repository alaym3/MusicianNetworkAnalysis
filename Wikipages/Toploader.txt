'''Toploader''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Eastbourne]], [[East Sussex]], formed in 1997,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010719224341/http://www.chartattack.com:80/damn/2001/07/1701.cfm "CD Reviews: The Beta Band, Default, Toploader and many more"]. ''Chart Attack'', 17 July 2001</ref> with over two million album sales and a few top 20 hits both home and abroad. Their debut album, ''[[Onka's Big Moka]]'', sold over one million units and peaked in the top 5 of the [[UK Albums Chart]], where it remained for six months. It earned them four nominations at the [[2001 Brit Awards]]. They are recognised most of all for their cover of [[King Harvest]]'s US hit "[[Dancing in the Moonlight]]" written by Sherman Kelly, which became a global hit for the band. Their second album, ''[[Magic Hotel]]'', reached number 3 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The band reunited in 2009; they continue to tour at various [[Gig (music)|gigs]] and record music.

== Career ==

=== Formation and early start (1997–1998) ===

Named after a joint-rolling technique, Toploader's live career began playing with [[Coldplay]] and [[Muse (band)|Muse]] in small venues across the UK. They later went on to support the likes of [[Paul Weller]], [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Robbie Williams]] and [[Simple Minds]]. On 20 July 2000 they backed [[Bon Jovi]] at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], becoming the last British band to play there before it was demolished and redeveloped.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/toploader-3-1397127|title=TOPLOADER KEEP GRIP ON CHARTS |website=Nme.com|date=19 July 2000|access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref>

=== Commercial success (1999–2001) ===
By 1998, Toploader were picked up by [[S2 Records]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Music]], and signed a six-album deal. On 7 May 1999, the band made their first live TV performance on [[TFI Friday]], hosted by [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b82b74942|title=Tfi Friday[07/05/99] (1999)|website=Bfi.org.uk|access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref> Later that same year their debut album, ''[[Onka's Big Moka]]'', was released on 11 November and became a huge hit. It was produced by [[Dave Eringa]], a long time collaborator of the [[Manic Street Preachers]]. It debuted at number five in the UK Albums Chart, until it settled at number four. "Dancing in the Moonlight" was the top single off the album, eventually reaching number seven in the [[UK Singles Chart]], while "Achilles Heel" managed to get to number eight. They gained four nominations at the [[Brit Awards]], despite never winning any of them. On 24 June 2000, Toploader attended the [[Glastonbury Festival]], as part of the Saturday line-up.

=== Break-up (2002–2003) ===
In 2002, they released a second album, ''[[Magic Hotel]]''. It was poorly received by critics and failed to match the success of the first.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2885811.stm|title=Pop band Toploader split|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=25 March 2003|access-date=8 August 2013}}</ref> They struggled with a backlash from the UK music press and their single, "Time of My Life", could only make it into the Top 20. Because of the negative reception and the album not meeting the same success as the first, they were dropped by S2. Not long after that, the band broke up in 2003.<ref name="BBC" /> Julian Deane retired as a musician and in 2007 he founded Raygun Music, a [[Brighton]] based management company, that serves both as a record label and publisher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smilefest.co.uk/julian-founder-of-raygun-guitarist-with-toploader/|title=Julian Deane (Raygun Management)|website=Smilefest.co.uk|date=1 March 2018|access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref>

=== Reforming and later work (2009–present) ===
[[File:Toploader Live Dundee Oct 2011.JPG|thumb|Toploader performing at The Doghouse in [[Dundee]] in 2011]]
Six years later, Toploader reformed and signed a one-album deal with Underdogs Music<ref>{{cite web|url=http://underdogsonline.com|title=Underdogs Music|publisher=Underdogsonline.com|access-date=27 April 2012}}</ref> for their third album, which was released in June 2011. The album's title was ''Only Human'', and the first single from it, "Never Stop Wondering", was released on 14 March 2011. Another single, "A Balance to All Things" (featuring a remix from [[Ash Howes]]), followed on 20 June 2011.

The present band line-up contains three of the five original members: Joseph Washbourn, [[Dan Hipgrave]] and Rob Green.

On 28 April 2012, they performed at the [[University of Gloucestershire]] Student Union Summerball. They also performed at Aberystwyth University's May Ball on 11 May 2012. In May 2012, they played at [[Lakefest]] festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lakefest.co.uk/line-up-2012 |title=Lakefest 2012: Line-up 2012 |publisher=Lakefest.co.uk |date=20 January 2012 |access-date=27 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419221052/http://lakefest.co.uk/line-up-2012 |archive-date=19 April 2012  }}</ref> They also played at the [[Tiree Music Festival]] in July 2012. During 2012 the band agreed to act as patrons for a UK-based children's charity called 'Time Is Precious'.<ref>[http://www.timeisprecious.org/Trust_Supporters/Patron_Trust.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102003759/http://www.timeisprecious.org/Trust_Supporters/Patron_Trust.htm|date=2 November 2012}}</ref>
In November 2012 they performed a gig in Frome, Somerset with all proceeds going to the charity, which helps ill children and their families.

In 2013, Toploader released a new single "Turn It Around", co-written with [[Eg White]] and produced by Andrew Green. The song is included on a four-song EP. In the summer of 2013 they headlined the [[LeeStock Music Festival]] in [[Suffolk]] and the AmpRocks Festival in [[Bedfordshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalsforall.com/article/leestock-2013-headliners-announced|title=LeeStock Headliners Announced|publisher=festivalsforall.com|access-date=15 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ampthillfestival.co.uk/amprocks/line-up-2013.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709100115/http://www.ampthillfestival.co.uk/amprocks/line-up-2013.html |archive-date=9 July 2013  }}</ref>

On 12 May 2017, Toploader's fourth album, ''Seeing Stars'' was released. Under a different music label, Big Lake Music, a sublabel of India Media Group. "Roll with the Punches" was chosen as the lead single. The album was crowdfunded using an online [[direct-to-fan]] music platform called [[PledgeMusic]]. One year before the album's release, Matt Knight left the band.

Jordan Smith from [[The Xcerts]] has occasionally performed live with Toploader, but is not a full time member.
