==Early life==
[[File:Lago de Chapultepec V.jpg|thumb|Thalía was born in Mexico City.]]
Thalía was born on 26 August 1971 in [[Mexico City]]. She is the youngest of five daughters of Yolanda Miranda Mange (d. 2011), a painter who was Thalía's manager from 1980 to 1999 and Ernesto Sodi Pallares (d. 1977), a scientist, doctor of [[pathology]], [[criminologist]] and writer. Her four sisters are [[Laura Zapata]] (daughter of Guillermo Zapata Pérez de Utrera), Federica, Gabriela and Ernestina Sodi.{{fact|date=May 2021}}

When she turned one, Thalía appeared in her first TV commercial in Mexico. At the age of four, she began taking ballet and piano classes at the [[Conservatorio Nacional de Música (Mexico)]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Por |last=Notimex |url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/celebrara-thalia-su-cumpleanos-40 |title=Celebrará Thalía su cumpleaños 40 [Thalía&#93; – 25/08/2011 {{pipe}} Periódico Zócalo |publisher=Zocalo.com.mx |date=25 August 2011 |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref> Her father suffered from [[diabetes]] and died in 1977 when Thalía was six years old.{{fact|date=May 2021}}

Years later, Thalía admitted publicly that her father's death had traumatized her drastically, since she had lost her voice for a whole year. This led to her being diagnosed with [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] (CDH), which belongs to a series of developmental disorders related to [[autism spectrum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casatelenovela.com/2008/04/la_cantante_y_actriz_thalia_fu.html|title=CasaTelenovela – Las Telenovelas al momento – el porque y el quién|access-date=31 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409164332/http://www.casatelenovela.com/2008/04/la_cantante_y_actriz_thalia_fu.html|archive-date=9 April 2008}}</ref> She has said that she had psychological therapy for a few years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.generaccion.com/noticia/127628/thalia-enmudecio-tras-muerte-su-padre |title=Thalia enmudeció tras la muerte de su padre |publisher=Generaccion.com |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvynovelas.com/noticias/356657/thalia-confiesa-estuvo-muda-ano|work=TVyNovelas.com|title=Revista TVyNovelas|publisher=Tvynovelas.com|access-date=5 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210224536/http://www.tvynovelas.com/noticias/356657/thalia-confiesa-estuvo-muda-ano|archive-date=10 December 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> She has reportedly mentioned that she was a victim of [[bullying]] as a child because of the loss of her father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/45148867/ns/today-today_books/t/growing-stronger-thalia-shares-her-story/ |title='Growing Stronger': Thalia shares her story – today > books |website=TODAY.com |access-date=27 August 2016}}</ref>

==Musical career==
===1981–1989: Career beginnings and the Timbiriche era===
In 1981, when Thalía was nine years old, she was incorporated as a vocalist in a children's group named Pac Man, which was formed to participate in a popular music festival known as ''Juguemos a cantar'' ("Let's play like we're singing"), a TV program by [[Televisa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mx.hola.com/biografias/thalia/biografia/ |title=Thalía. Noticias, fotos y biografía de Thalía |publisher=Mx.hola.com |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref> Later, Pac Man changed their band name to "Din-Din". Thalía performed various times along with Din-Din in occasional events and parties, touring all over Mexico. The band recorded a total of 4 studio albums between 1982 and 1983 (''En acción'', ''Recordando el Rock and Roll'', ''Somos alguien muy especial'' and ''Pitubailando''), and later it was disbanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=334256 |title=Thalia Din-Din En Accion Mexico vinyl LP album (LP record) (334256) |publisher=Eil.com |date=14 March 2002 |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=387057 |title=Thalia Pitubailando Mexico 12" vinyl single (12 inch record / Maxi-single) (387057) |publisher=Eil.com |date=14 March 2002 |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=387069 |title=Thalia Somos Alguien Muy Especial Mexico vinyl LP album (LP record) (387069) |publisher=Eil.com |date=14 March 2002 |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=387050 |title=Thalia Recordando El Rock And Roll Mexico 12" vinyl single (12 inch record / Maxi-single) (387050) |publisher=Eil.com |date=14 March 2002 |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref>

After Din-Din broke up in 1984, Thalía participated as a solo artist in two annual music festivals of ''Juguemos a cantar''. In 1984, she placed second there with her interpretation of "Moderna niña del rock" ("Modern rock girl"); this brought her the opportunity to participate in the chorus of the popular musical ''Vaselina'', a child version of the successful musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', in which the band [[Timbiriche]] was acting and singing. The line-up of the band consisted of Sasha Sökol, Benny Ibarra, Erik Rubín, Diego Schoening, Mariana Garza and [[Paulina Rubio]]. [[Timbiriche]] was highly promoted at the time by [[Televisa]], one of the most massive media enterprises globally and the most important in the Spanish-speaking world. Some time later, Thalía obtained the protagonist role of Sandy Dee in the musical, and she performed in 500 theater presentations of ''Vaselina'' along with [[Timbiriche]].

In 1986, after the departure of Sasha Sökol from Timbiriche, Thalía became a member of the band. By that time, Timbiriche had already recorded five albums. In the following year, Thalía was invited to participate in the [[telenovela]] ''Pobre señorita Limantour''; this production was actually Thalía's debut as a TV actress. However, she appeared in only one episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211843/fullcredits#cast|title=La pobre Señorita Limantour (TV Series 1983– )|work=IMDb|access-date=31 October 2014}}</ref> In the same year, she recorded with [[Timbiriche]] the principal theme of the [[young adult fiction|juvenile]] [[telenovela]] ''[[Quinceañera (telenovela)|Quinceañera]]'' ("Fifteen-year-old"), in which Thalía was the co-protagonist with the role of Beatriz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alma-latina.net/Quinceanera/Quinceanera.shtml |title=Quinceańera – telenovela |publisher=Alma-latina.net |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref> The TV series was awarded as the "Best telenovela" by "Premios TVyNovelas" in 1988 and Thalía was awarded as "the best new actress of 1988".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWQELqT9kGo |title=THALIA recibe premio tvnovelas por actriz revelacion en quinceañera |publisher=YouTube |date=13 February 2010 |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref>

With [[Timbiriche]], Thalía recorded four studio albums: ''[[Timbiriche VII]]'' (1987), the double album ''[[Timbiriche VIII & IX]]'' (1988) and ''Los clásicos de Timbiriche'' (1989). The last one is a compilation of the band's greatest hits, recorded originally in 1987, with new symphonic arrangements as it included the participation of Mexico's philharmonic orchestra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.esmas.com/ritmoson-latino/artistas/251843?page=1 |title=Ritmoson |publisher=.esmas.com |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref> In 1989, Thalía departed from Timbiriche.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eunice Martínez Arias |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/284817.vuelven-a-vivir-el-exito.html |title=Vuelven a vivir el éxito |publisher=Elsiglodetorreon.com.mx |date=6 July 2007 |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref> In that year, she also starred in another TV series, ''Luz y sombra'' ("Light and shadow"), which was her first protagonist role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211824/|title=Luz y sombra (TV Series 1989– )|work=IMDb|access-date=31 October 2014}}</ref> Some time later she visited Los Angeles to take English courses in the University of California. She also attended music, singing, acting and dancing classes before beginning her career as a solo artist.

===1990–1993: First albums as a solo artist===
In 1990, Thalía returned to Mexico and released her first studio album as a [[solo artist]], self-titled  ''[[Thalía (1990 album)|Thalía]]'', which was produced by Alfredo Díaz Ordaz, and published by [[Fonovisa Records|Fonovisa]], [[Televisa]]'s record label. From that album, she released a total of four singles that became radio hits: "Amarillo Azul", "[[Pienso en Ti]]", "[[Un Pacto Entre los Dos]]" and "[[Saliva (Thalía song)|Saliva]]". The last two tracks were co-written by her and Díaz Ordaz and they were considered as provocative at the time ("Un Pacto Entre Los Dos" was even labeled as a song with occult Satan-worship lyrics by various [[Far-right politics|far-right parties]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revista-contacto.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9622:thalia-precursora-de-lady-gaga&catid=117:ultimas-noticias&Itemid=596|title=revista-contacto.info|date=22 June 2013|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622215005/http://www.revista-contacto.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9622:thalia-precursora-de-lady-gaga&catid=117:ultimas-noticias&Itemid=596|archive-date=22 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://musica.univision.com/fotos/curiosas/slideshow/2011-08-25/thalia-40-anos-canciones-trayectoria-fotos-cumpleanos |title=Thalía. 40 años, 40 canciones – Univision Música |publisher=Musica.univision.com |access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref>

In September 1991, Thalía released her second studio album, ''[[Mundo de cristal]]'', which marks Thalía's last project in collaboration with Alfredo Díaz Ordaz. Four songs became radio singles from the album, and all of them had big radio impact in Mexico. Due to the success of the singles, the album was certified as double gold in Thalía's native country, Mexico. In the same year, Thalía was co-presenter of the late Spanish show ''VIP Noche'', along with Spanish presenter Emilio Aragón, produced by [[Telecinco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0321004/fullcredits#cast|title=VIP noche (TV Series 1990–1992)|work=IMDb|access-date=31 October 2014}}</ref>

In October 1992, she released her third studio album and her last under the same label, entitled ''[[Love (Thalía album)|Love]]'', which was recorded in Spain and was produced by Luis Carlos Esteban. The album spread six singles, that had huge radio impact: "[[Sangre (Thalía song)|Sangre]]", "[[Love (Thalía song)|Love]]", "[[Maria Mercedes (song)|María Mercedes]]" (official theme of the TV series), "No Trates de Engañarme", "Flor de Juventud", and "La Vida en Rosa" ([[La vie en rose]]), the last one being a Spanish-French cover of the classic French song originally performed by [[Edith Piaf]]. Thalía wrote the song "Sangre" inspired in Díaz Ordaz, with whom she had broken up her sentimental relation. The album was praised by the critics, as it was an artistic evolution for Thalía, who experimented for the first time in different [[music genres]], especially [[electronic music]]. The album reached number 15 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]] ''[[Latin Pop Albums]]'' in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/music/album/love-mw0000172049|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120702214934/http://www.allrovi.com/music/album/love-mw0000172049|url-status=dead|title=Listen to Love by Thalía – Album Reviews, Credits, and Awards – AllRo...|date=2 July 2012|archive-date=2 July 2012}}</ref> In Mexico, it sold over 200,000 copies in the first month upon its release and very soon it reached the platinum and gold certification, while it was a commercial success all over Latin America.

===1994–1999: International breakout===
In 1994, during the successful transmission of ''[[Marimar (Mexican telenovela)|Marimar]]'', Thalía signed a contract with the record label [[EMI]] to prepare her fourth studio album that was entitled ''[[En éxtasis]]''. The album was released in October 1995.

It must also be added that Thalía was more oriented to the [[latin pop]] music genre in that album, even though it was influenced by various music genres. Amandote became a number 1 hit in various radio stations in the Philippines in 1996, along with her phenomenal superstardom accompanied by her historic Manila tour. It was described by Philippine media as tantamount to that of Pope John Paul II's 1995 Manila visit.
{{check quotation}}The broadcast of the [[telenovelas]] ''[[María Mercedes (telenovela)|María Mercedes]]'', ''[[Marimar (Mexican telenovela)|Marimar]]'' and ''[[María la del barrio]]'' had already converted Thalía to a global television phenomenon by the end of 1996. In January 1997, she released her first compilation album entitled ''[[Nandito Ako (album)|Nandito Ako]]'', which contains four songs recorded in Filipino, five English versions from various tracks from the album [[En éxtasis]] and a Spanish remix of the song [[Amándote]]. The only single that was released from this album was ''Nandito Ako''. The album became a commercial success in the Philippines as a result of Thalía's growing popularity, reaching platinum status set by the [[Philippine Association of the Record Industry]]. [[En éxtasis]] was her first album that was released worldwide, reaching gold, platinum or multi-platinum status in more than 20 countries.

In July 1997, Thalía's fifth studio album was released, under the title ''[[Amor a la mexicana]]'', produced again by [[Emilio Estefan]], and including songs that became classic over the years like "[[Mujer Latina]]", "[[De dónde soy]]", "[[Por amor (Thalía song)|Por amor]]", "[[Noches sin luna]]" and "[[Amor a la Mexicana (song)|Amor a la mexicana]]". The album became a pure commercial success,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/amor-a-la-mexicana-r278142/charts-awards|title=Amor a la Mexicana – Thalía – Awards – AllMusic|work=AllMusic|access-date=31 October 2014}}</ref> while the first single of the album ("[[Amor a la Mexicana (song)|Amor a la mexicana]]") became a number one hit in 14 countries. With Amor a la mexicana, Thalía was able to bring her music and establish her projects in difficult markets like those of France, [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Turkey]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], Italy and all the Spanish-speaking countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anodis.com/galeria.asp?id=7 |title=Anodis.com |website=Anodis.com |access-date=27 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191500/http://anodis.com/galeria.asp?id=7 |archive-date=29 October 2013}}</ref>

After the success of ''Amor a la mexicana'', Thalía recorded the Spanish and Portuguese versions of the song "Journey to the Past", produced by [[Atlantic Records]], as a part of the soundtrack of the [[Fox Animation Studios]] movie ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997).

In the following year, she starred for the first time in a movie in English, named "Mambo Café", written and directed by Reuben González.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_Nov_16/ai_53220016/ |title=CBSi |website=FindArticles.com |access-date=27 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018143758/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_Nov_16/ai_53220016/ |archive-date=18 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27Mambo+Cafe%27+Wraps+Principle+Photography%3B+Kushner-Locke+to+Distribute...-a053625991|title='Mambo Cafe' Wraps Principle Photography; Kushner-Locke to Distribute Internationally.|access-date=31 October 2014}}</ref> ''Mambo Café'' premiered in January 2000 in Mexico, Greece and Russia, distributed by Kushner Locke Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=7847&tabla=espectaculos|title=El Universal|website=Eluniversal.com.mx|access-date=31 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022154837/http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=7847&tabla=espectaculos|archive-date=22 October 2012}}</ref>

In 1999, after ''Mambo Café'', Thalía returned in television with [[telenovela]] ''[[Rosalinda (telenovela)|Rosalinda]]''. "Rosalinda" was considered to be [[Televisa]]'s most expensive production ever by that time, as well as the most exported in foreign countries, as it was sold in over 180 countries. In an interview of that period Thalía had commented: "The telenovelas are the ones that opened the doors of the world for me, because the audience of telenovelas is much more passionate than the audience of cinema. What's more, television is free".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.com.mx/entretenimiento/articulo/15327/Thalia+llena+su+mundo.htm|title=Terra – Thalía llena su mundo – Famosos – Entretenimiento|website=Terra.com.mx|access-date=31 October 2014}}</ref>

===2000–2005: Crossover and first tour in the United States===
Emilio Estefan also produced Thalía's sixth studio album, ''[[Arrasando]]'', released on 25 April 2000, which was successful. It spawned the singles "[[Entre el mar y una estrella]]", "[[Regresa a mí (Thalía song)|Regresa a mí]]", "[[Arrasando (song)|Arrasando]]" and "[[Reencarnación]]". Thalía was nominated in the [[Latin Grammy]] category as the "Best Female Pop Vocal Album". The album received one Latin Grammy nomination and it won in its category as the "Best Sound Engineered Album of the year". The singles of this album were huge hits. In 2001 she was nominated for her record ''Arrasando'' and won a Lo Nuestro award in the category of People's Prize, and was the first artist to whom an innovative award from Billboard Awards for Latin Music was given, the "Star Award".

On 4 May 2001, the President of the United States, [[George W. Bush]], invited her to a party celebrating [[Cinco de mayo]] organized at the [[White House]], where she interpreted a medley of popular Mexican songs with a Mexican mariachi band.

On 28 August 2001, expressing her love for her country of birth, Mexico, she released her album ''[[Thalía con banda: Grandes éxitos|Con Banda: Grandes Éxitos]]'': a "greatest hits" album, but recorded with the typical Mexican "banda" sound. "Amor a la Mexicana" banda version was released as a single. The album was nominated for a Latin Grammy for "Best Banda Album" at the 3rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2002.

Her seventh studio album, self-titled ''[[Thalía (2002 album)|Thalía]]'', was released on 21 May 2002. It was largely written and produced by [[Estéfano]]. Buoyed by a pair of chart-topping singles ("[[Tú y Yo (Thalía song)|Tú y Yo]]" and "[[No me enseñaste]]") and a top-ten hit ("[[¿A quién le importa?]]") (cover of [[Alaska y Dinarama]]), this album hit number one for 6 consecutive weeks on the [[Top Latin Albums]] chart, reaching number eleven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and 2x Multi-Platinum status with sales in the U.S. of 200,000 copies. It was nominated in one [[Latin Grammy]] category – "[[Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, Female|Female Pop Vocal Album]]", and in four [[2003 Latin Billboard Music Awards|Latin Billboard]] categories – "Pop Track Female" and "Tropical Track Female" for "No Me Enseñaste", [[2003 Latin Billboard Music Awards#Your World Award (Premio Tu Mundo)|"Your World Award"]], and [[2003 Latin Billboard Music Awards#Female|"Female Pop Album"]], for ''Thalía'', winning the last two awards. "No Me Enseñaste" reached at No. 1 in Billboard's [[Hot Latin Tracks]] chart.

On 25 February 2003, she released her first remix album, ''[[Thalía's Hits Remixed]]''. This album contains some [[remix]]es of her ''EMI era'' hits, such as "Amor a la Mexicana", "Piel Morena", "No Me Enseñaste" and "Tú y Yo." It also contains the English version of "Arrasando", called "It's My Party". Furthermore, it includes the previously unreleased medley that Thalía had recorded especially for her 2001 Latin Grammy Awards performance, but was later cancelled, due to the [[September 11 attacks]].

[[File:Thalía in concert2.jpg|thumb|Thalía in the ''High Voltage Tour'' Los Angeles concert on 14 May 2004]]
On 8 July 2003, Thalía released her eighth studio album and the first one in English, the self-titled ''[[Thalía (English album)|Thalía]]'', featuring the rapper [[Fat Joe]] in "[[I Want You (Thalía song)|I Want You/Me Pones Sexy]]". "[[Baby, I'm in Love|Baby, I'm in Love/Alguien Real]]", "[[Don't Look Back (Thalía song)|Don't Look Back]]" and "[[Cerca de ti (song)|Cerca De Ti]]" were singles too. The album landed at No. 11 in The Billboard 200. The song "[[I Want You (Thalía song)|I Want You]]" entered the [[American Top 40]] with Casey Kasem and even reached the top 10 during that year. The song also entered the American [[Billboard Top 100]] Singles Charts that year.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Thalía Hits Billboard|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=thalía|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref> She won an [[Winter Music Conference|International Dance Music Award]] for her club-hit "[[Dance Dance (The Mexican)]]".

Her ninth studio album, ''[[El Sexto Sentido]]'', was released on 19 July 2005, and recorded mostly in Spanish, but with a few of the songs sung in English as well. It was reported to be the most expensive music album produced in Latin America in 2005. It had mild success, although the sound and the overall result make it one of her most integrated projects. "[[Amar sin ser amada]]" was the first single of the album and is considered as an infectious rock-edged [[tango music|tango]]-based song. "[[Un alma sentenciada]]", the second single of the album, is a feverish and, at points, hyperdramatic ballad. The explosive "[[Seducción (Thalía song)|Seducción]]" ("Seduction") and "Olvidame" were also releases as singles, gaining considerable success. The album was also certified gold in Argentina, Greece and Mexico and double platinum in the United States.

===2006–2008: ''The Conexión Thalía Radio Show'', Lyme disease and ''Lunada''===
In 2006, the album received a reloaded version, ''[[El Sexto Sentido#El Sexto Sentido: Re+Loaded|El Sexto Sentido: Re+Loaded]]''.

"El Sexto Sentido" was nominated for one Latin Grammy as "Best Female Pop Vocal Album", it was also nominated in one Latin Billboard category – "Pop Female Album" and in eight Premios Juventud categories.

In 2006, Thalía became a U.S. citizen at a swearing-in ceremony in New York, where she resides with her husband. Under Mexican law she is allowed to retain her Mexican citizenship. She also received an award by her then record company [[EMI]], for sales of more than 10 million copies with all her discography with the company.<ref name="emiaward">{{cite news|url=https://peopleenespanol.com/article/thalia-recibe-disco-de-diamante/|title=Thalía recibe Disco de Diamante|work=[[People en Español]]|date=12 July 2006|access-date=22 March 2017|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033252/http://peopleenespanol.com/article/thalia-recibe-disco-de-diamante/|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Acting career==
Thalia was cast in a supporting role in the 1986 [[telenovela]] ''[[Pobre señorita Limantour]]'' with which she began her collaboration with [[Televisa]], the largest mass media company in the Spanish-speaking world. In 1987, she went on to star in her first major role for Televisa in the 1987 teenage drama series ''[[Quinceañera (telenovela)|Quinceañera]]'', along with Mexican actress [[Adela Noriega]]. ''Quinceañera'' won the ''TV y Novelas'' award for Best Telenovela of the Year 1988. In 1989, she got her first lead role in ''Luz y Sombra'', which was less successful.

However, Thalía's explosion in popularity came in 1992, when she starred in ''[[María Mercedes (Mexican TV series)|María Mercedes]]'' for which she won a ''TV Y Novelas'' award as Best Young Actress in 1993. This series was the first of three telenovelas, named by the Mexican press as ''Las Tres Marias'' ("The Three Marías"), because the name of the heroine in all of these telenovelas was ''María''. The second telenovela of the trilogy was ''[[Marimar (Mexican telenovela)|Marimar]]'' in 1994, and the third and final was ''[[Maria la del Barrio]]'' in 1995. Among the trilogy, the third was the most successful of Thalía's career and it remains her most iconic role, while ''Marimar'' is considered the best Telenovela of all time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/ranking-the-5-best-telenovela-roles-of-thalia#36s5riv|title=Ranking The 5 Best Telenovela Roles Of Thalía|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|access-date=20 October 2014|date=15 January 2014|first=Brian|last=Galindo}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latinpost.com/articles/6284/20140123/latin-post-exclusive-6-telenovelas-cant-forget.htm|title=6 Best Telenovelas of All Time: Marimar, El Clon, and More|publisher=Latin Post|access-date=20 October 2014|date=23 January 2014|first=Solmarie|last=Santiago}}</ref> In 1999, Thalía starred in her last telenovela, "[[Rosalinda (telenovela)|Rosalinda]]". All four telenovelas were basically based on the same rags to riches character.<ref name="tevnovelas.blogspot.gr">{{cite web|url=http://tevnovelas.blogspot.gr/2011/07/thalia-legendary-telenovela-actresses.html|title=Thalia a Legendary Telenovela actresses|website=Tevnovelas.blogspot.gr|access-date=31 October 2014|archive-date=11 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411200946/http://tevnovelas.blogspot.gr/2011/07/thalia-legendary-telenovela-actresses.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>
With these telenovelas, Thalía became famous worldwide and was consolidated as a television phenomenon, because of the extremely high ratings her TV series achieved in more than 180 countries (especially the [[Philippines]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph//article/403886|title=What's the latest with Thalia?|last=Molbog-Mendoza|first=Jenny|date=9 November 2017|website=Sunstar|language=en|access-date=31 October 2019}}</ref>

Although Thalía's presence in television is legendary, her presence in [[Filmmaking|cinema]] is less important. She appeared for the first time in a movie when she was still a child in the 1979 film "La Guerra De los Pasteles" ("The War of the Cakes"). Furthermore, in 1999, she starred in ''"Mambo Café"'', a modest [[independent film|indie]] film production that had a poor reception from critics.

===Cultural impact of telenovelas===
Thalía has been labeled by various mass media companies as the "queen of soap operas",<ref name="delafont">{{cite web|url=http://delafont.com/music_acts/thalia.htm|title=THALIA booking – Latin Music Artists – Corporate Event Booking Agent|website=Delafont.com|access-date=31 October 2014}}</ref> because her presence in television during the decade of the '90s was phenomenal. She became one of the world's foremost and most enduring television personalities as she starred in Mexico's highest-rated telenovelas ever that were exported in over 180 countries and viewed by about 2&nbsp;billion people. It is stated by international media experts that at some point at the midst of the telenovela craze, Thalía's name even became synonymous with her native country, Mexico.

According to the newspaper ''Ivoir'Soir'': "At 7.30 sharp in the evening, when Marimar comes on, everything stops in Côte d'Ivoire". It is also mentioned that "Marimar" could attract more local fans than the 1998 World Cup, and that the program arrived in Africa after being a phenomenal rating hit in Indonesia and the Philippines, where in 1997 she was received in [[Manila]] like a foreign [[head of state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-54738757/soaps-with-a-latin-scent|title="Soaps with a Latin Scent" by Ortiz de Urbina, Araceli; Lopez, Asbel – UNESCO Courier, May 1999 – Online Research Library|website=Questia.com|access-date=31 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412032456/https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-54738757/soaps-with-a-latin-scent|archive-date=12 April 2013}}</ref>

Thalía stated in her autobiography regarding to the impact of her telenovelas: "Soap operas made a lot of history; just look at the report by UNESCO, where it was noted that "in the [[Ivory Coast]] in Africa and in Paris (France), people stopped the daily course of their lives just to watch a soap opera. I never expected that kind of success [...] Whenever I arrived anywhere, I was treated like royalty; even the press in some of these countries referred to me as the Aztec Queen, the Mexican Queen, or the ambassador of Mexico, and like a proud peacock, I always brought my country's flag with me wherever I went to represent my motherland. I was in the clouds at the pinnacle of my career [...] During my visit at the Philippines, the organizers informed me that the last time so many people gathered in the streets for a person was when [[Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul the Second]] came to visit on January fourteenth, 1995 [...] In the Philippines, the country that probably felt the greatest impact from Marimar, the show was more widely promoted than the 1998 World Cup and more highly rated than the Super Bowl or the Grammys. In fact while I was visiting the country, the people and the media were so enthralled to see [[Marimar (Mexican telenovela)|Marimar]] in the flesh that a historic peace treaty between the government and the querillas and the centennial celebrations of the [[Philippine Revolution]]s that were happening at the same time were pushed aside in the midst of Marimar fever. As a result, the archipelago was temporarily dubbed "República de MariMar."

The phenomenon of Thalía's telenovelas also became visible in countries like Brazil, [[Bulgaria]], [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], France, [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Indonesia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], Russia, [[Syria]], [[Turkey]] and the majority of Spanish-speaking countries around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/spotlight/looking-back/13166/The-Marimar-Craze|title=The "Marimar" Craze|first=Michael|last=Ancheta|date=19 July 2007|website=Pep.ph|access-date=31 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031024640/http://www.pep.ph/spotlight/looking-back/13166/The-Marimar-Craze|archive-date=31 October 2014}}</ref>
