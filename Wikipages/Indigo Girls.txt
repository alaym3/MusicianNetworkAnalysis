'''Indigo Girls''' are an American [[folk rock]] music [[duet (music)|duo]] from [[Atlanta]], Georgia, United States, consisting of [[Amy Ray]] and [[Emily Saliers]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=643}}</ref> The two met in elementary school and began performing together as high school students in [[Decatur, Georgia]], part of the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]. They started performing with the name Indigo Girls as students at [[Emory University]], performing weekly at The Dugout, a bar in [[Druid Hills, Georgia#Economy|Emory Village]].

They released a self-produced, full-length record album entitled ''[[Strange Fire]]'' in 1987, and contracted with a major record company in 1988.<ref name="Larkin"/> After releasing nine albums with major record labels from 1987 through 2007, they have now resumed self-producing albums with their own IG Recordings company.

Outside of working on Indigo Girls–related projects, Ray has released solo albums and founded a [[not-for-profit|non-profit]] [[recording label|organization]] that promotes independent musicians, while Saliers is an entrepreneur in the restaurant industry as well as a professional author; she also collaborates with her father, [[Don Saliers]], in performing for special groups and causes. Saliers and Ray are both [[lesbians]] and are active in political and environmental causes.

== Recording and touring ==
=== Early years ===
Amy Ray and Emily Saliers first met and got to know each other as students at [[DeKalb County School District|Laurel Ridge Elementary School]] in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]], just outside [[Decatur, Georgia]],<ref name=AtlMag80>{{cite journal| journal= Atlanta Magazine| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qOECAAAAMBAJ&q=Laurel+Ridge+Elementary+indigo&pg=PA72| title= From Brenda Lee to Ludacris: A Sonic Portrait of Our City| first= Rebecca | last= Burns| page= 80| date= June 2003|volume= 43| number= 2|issn= 0004-6701| publisher= Emmis Communications| access-date= December 2, 2016}}</ref> but were not close friends because Saliers was a grade older than Ray. While attending Shamrock High School (now [[Druid Hills Middle School]]), they became better acquainted, and started performing together, first as "The B-Band" and then as "Saliers and Ray".<ref name="Larkin"/>

Saliers graduated and began attending [[Tulane University]] in Louisiana. A year later, Ray graduated high school and began attending [[Vanderbilt University]] in Tennessee. Homesick, both returned to Georgia and transferred to [[Emory University]] in Atlanta (where Saliers' father was a professor).<ref name= sketch>{{cite web| title=  Biographical Sketch: Don E. Saliers |url= http://alumni.iws.edu/Saliers_Biographical_Sketch.htm| website=IWS.edu | publisher= The Robert E. Webber Institute for Worship Studies| access-date= December 5, 2016}}</ref> 
[[File:Emory Village.JPG|alt=|thumb|After forming their duo in college, the Indigo Girls played small clubs in the Emory Village district of [[Druid Hills, Georgia]].]]
By 1985, they had begun performing together again, this time as Indigo Girls.<ref name="Larkin"/> Saliers stated in a March 2007 [[National Public Radio]] ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'' interview, "we needed a name and we went through the dictionary looking for words that struck us and [[wikt:indigo|indigo]] was one."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Indigo%2520Girls |title=Indigo Girls |website=Everything2.com |date=August 6, 2001 |access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref>

Their first release in 1985 was a seven-inch single named "Crazy Game", with the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] "Everybody's Waiting (for Someone to Come Home)".<ref name="Larkin"/>
That same year, the Indigo Girls released a six-track [[Extended play]] album named ''Indigo Girls'', and in 1987 released their first full-length album, ''[[Strange Fire]]'', recorded at [[John Keane (record producer)|John Keane]] Studio in [[Athens, Georgia]], and including "Crazy Game".<ref name="Larkin"/> With this release, they secured the services of Russell Carter, who remains their manager to the present; they had first approached him when the [[Extended play|EP]] album was released, but he told them their songs were "immature" and they were not likely to get a record deal. ''Strange Fire'' apparently changed his opinion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2011/10/06/indigo-girls-latest/|title=Indigo Girls' latest album cliché, but still hanging on|date=October 6, 2011}}</ref>

===Epic Records (1988–2006)===
The success of [[10,000 Maniacs]], [[Tracy Chapman]], and [[Suzanne Vega]] encouraged [[Epic Records]] to enlist other folk-based female singer-songwriters; Epic signed the duo in 1988. Their first major-label release, also named ''[[Indigo Girls (album)|Indigo Girls]]'', which scored No. 22 on the album chart, included a new version of "Land of Canaan", which was also on their 1985 EP album and on ''Strange Fire''.<ref name="Larkin"/> Also on the self-titled release was their first hit "[[Closer to Fine]]" (a collaboration with Irish band [[Hothouse Flowers]]),<ref name="Larkin"/> which scored No. 52 on the popular music [[record chart|chart]] and No. 26 on the [[modern rock]] chart. They even managed one week on the mainstream rock [[album-oriented rock]] music chart at No. 48.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horizonmag.com/1/amy-ray.asp |title=horizonmag.com |publisher=horizonmag.com |access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> In 1990, they won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album|Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. They were also nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] (but lost to [[Milli Vanilli]] who eventually had their award revoked).

Their second album, ''[[Nomads Indians Saints]]'', went gold in December 1991 and included the hit song "Hammer and a Nail", a No. 12 modern rock music track; it was not as successful as their first, which was [[platinum certification|certified platinum]] at about the same time. The Indigo Girls followed it with the live ''[[Back on the Bus, Y'all]]'' and 1992's album ''[[Rites of Passage (Indigo Girls album)|Rites of Passage]]'', featuring the song "[[Galileo (song)|Galileo]]",<ref name="Larkin"/> the duo's first top 10 modern rock music track (#10). During the accompanying tour in December, they invited on a few dates [[Siouxsie Sioux]] of [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] as special guest to sing a couple of songs with them.<ref>Zarker, Karen.

December 9, 1992. Retrieved July 15, 2015</ref> They then recorded ''[[Swamp Ophelia]]'' in 1994,<ref name="Larkin"/> which went platinum in September 1996, and charted at No. 9 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album [[record chart|chart]].

In 1995, the Indigo Girls released a [[live album|live]], [[double album|double]] CD, ''[[1200 Curfews]]''. ''[[Shaming of the Sun]]'' was released in 1997 followed by ''[[Come on Now Social]]'' in 1999. ''Shaming of the Sun'' debuted at number seven on the Billboard charts, driven by the duo's contribution to the [[Lilith Fair]] music festival tour. The track "Shame on You" received more airplay on [[adult album alternative|adult alternative]], [[top 40]] and [[adult top 40]] radio stations than any of their previous singles, although this seemed to be a peak in their crossover success.

''Retrospective'', a [[compilation album]] with two new tracks, was released in 2000 and ''[[Become You]]'' followed two years later. Their last [[Epic Records|Epic]] studio album was ''[[All That We Let In]]'', released in 2004 with an accompanying tour. On June 14, 2005, they released ''Rarities'', a collection of B-sides and rare tracks partially decided by [[fan (person)|fans']] input, which fulfilled the album count obligation for their contract with Epic.

=== Hollywood Records (2006–07) ===
[[File:Indigo Girls 2005 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Indigo Girls performing in 2005.]]
After departing Epic, the Indigo Girls signed a five-record deal with [[Hollywood Records]]. Their first (and only) Hollywood album, ''[[Despite Our Differences]]'', produced by [[Mitchell Froom]], was released on September 19, 2006. John Metzger from ''MusicBox Online'' described ''Despite our Differences'' as "the most infectious, pop-infused set that the duo ever has managed to concoct.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In fact, its melodies, harmonies, and arrangements are so ingratiating that the album carries the weight of an instant classic." Thom Jurek from ''[[AllMusic]]'' wrote: "part of an emotional journey as complete as can be. More relevant than anyone dared expect. It's accessible and moving and true. It's their own brand of rock & roll, hewn from over the years, that bears a signature that is now indelible. A moving, and utterly poetic offering."{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

After releasing ''Despite Our Differences'', the Indigo Girls' contract was terminated by Hollywood Records during their 2007 tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://events.press-citizen.com/iowacity/events/indigo-girls-/E0-001-092160491-9|title=Indigo Girls with the Cincinnati Pops}}</ref>

=== Independent work (2007–present) ===
[[File:Indigo Girls Fillmore.jpg|thumb|right|Performing at [[The Fillmore#Locations|The Fillmore]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in 2018]]
Following their break with Hollywood Records, the Indigo Girls announced their next record would be released independently.  ''[[Poseidon and the Bitter Bug]]'' was released on March 24, 2009, from IG Recordings, the Indigo Girls' label, and distributed through [[Vanguard Records]]. This album is their first fully independent release since 1987's ''Strange Fire'', and their first two-CD set since 1995's live album ''1200 Curfews''; the first disc has the 10 tracks accompanied by a backing band, and the second includes the same 10 songs with only Ray and Saliers on vocals and acoustic guitars, and an additional track. On June 29, 2010 Indigo Girls' second full-length live album, ''Staring Down the Brilliant Dream'', was released on IG Recordings/Vanguard Records. This was followed on October 12, 2010 with their first holiday album ''Holly Happy Days''. Indigo Girls' thirteenth studio album, ''[[Beauty Queen Sister]]'', was released on October 4, 2011, and their fourteenth studio album, ''[[One Lost Day]]'', was released on June 2, 2015 (both on IG Recordings/Vanguard Records).

Beginning in 2017, the Indigo Girls have toured the United States performing their music arranged for symphony orchestra. After more than fifty performances, in 2018 they released a live double album entitled ''[[Indigo Girls Live with the University of Colorado Symphony Orchestra]]''. In 2020, they followed this with the studio album ''[[Look Long]]''.

=== Songwriting ===
{{section unsourced|date=May 2018}}
Ray and Saliers do not ordinarily collaborate in writing songs. They write separately and work out the arrangements together. There are a few exceptions, mostly unreleased songs from their early, pre-Epic days: "I Don't Know Your Name" and "If You Live Like That." "Blood Quantum", which appears on ''Honor: A Benefit for the [[Honor the Earth]] Campaign'' featured Ray's verses and chorus and Saliers's bridge. Finally, "I'll Give You My Skin", which appears both on ''[[Tame Yourself]]'' (a benefit album for [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]) and on the Indigo Girls release ''Rarities,'' is a collaborative work by Ray, Saliers, and [[Michael Stipe]] which is doubly rare, as Saliers and Ray usually write their songs without outside collaborators. In September 2020, the Indigo Girls released "Long Ride", the first song Ray and Saliers had written together in 30 years.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Indigo Girls' New Song Is About Patience And Fortitude In The COVID-19 Era|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/09/16/901831062/indigo-girls-new-song-is-about-patience-and-fortitude-in-the-covid-19-era|access-date=2021-03-09|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref>

=== Political activism ===
The Indigo Girls have been politically active, championing the causes of and held benefit concerts for [[environmentalism|the environment]], [[gay rights]], the rights of Native Americans, and the [[National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty]]. For many years they incorporated a recycling and public outreach program into their road tours by including [[Greenpeace]] representative Stephanie Fairbanks in their road crew. They helped [[Winona LaDuke]] establish [[Honor the Earth]], an organization dedicated to creating support and education for native environmental issues. After performing on the activist-oriented Spitfire Tour in 1999, Ray and Saliers joined forces with The Spitfire Agency to develop the Honor The Earth Tour, which visits colleges and Native communities, and raises money for their non-profit of the same name. Ray and Saliers have also appeared at the annual [[SOA Watch]] rallies, the [[March for Women's Lives]], and several other rallies and protests.

In 2006 the Indigo Girls were featured in artist [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s album ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'' in the song "[[Dear Mr. President (Pink song)|Dear Mr. President]]", which Pink says<ref>{{cite news |last=Haddon |first=Cole |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/Issues/2006-07-20/music/music.html |title=Simple Girl: Pink just wants to rock out — and rock the boat |work=Broward-Palm Beach New Times |date=July 20, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224021853/http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2006-07-20/music/simple-girl/ |archive-date=December 24, 2007 }}</ref> is a political confrontation with [[George W. Bush]] about war, poverty, LGBT rights, [[pro-choice|abortion rights]], and the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. Returning the favor, Pink performed on the Indigo Girls' "Rock and Roll Heaven's Gate," which is about, among other things, sexism and [[heterosexism]] in the music industry.

In June 2007 the Indigo Girls were part of the multi-artist [[True Colors Tour 2007]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.truecolorstour.com/ |title=Home |publisher=True Colors Tour |access-date=June 29, 2014}}</ref> on the tour's [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] stop which benefited the [[Human Rights Campaign]] and other organizations that provide support to the [[LGBT]] community. The Indigo Girls performed again on the [[True Colors Tour 2008]].

In April 2013, in response to criticism from transgender activists, the Indigo Girls issued a statement that they would play at the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]], but would protest the festival's "[[womyn-born womyn]]" policy from the stage.<ref>{{cite web|date=April 14, 2013|title=A Note from Amy and Emily|url=http://indigogirls.com/?p=2079|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002064542/http://indigogirls.com/?p=2079|archive-date=October 2, 2018|access-date=October 1, 2018|website=IndigoGirls.com|publisher=IndigoGirls.com}}</ref>

In November 2017, the Indigo Girls were nominated to ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine's "OUT100" for 2017 in recognition of their work and their visibility.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.out.com/out100-2017/2017/11/08/out100-2017#slide-41 |title=OUT100: The Indigo Girls, Singer-Songwriters |work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]] |date=November 8, 2017 |access-date=November 9, 2017 }}</ref>
