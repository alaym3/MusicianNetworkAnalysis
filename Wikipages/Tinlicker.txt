==History==
Tinlicker started as a solo project of Micha Heyboer (born 14 May 1979 in Utrecht, The Netherlands) on his own Zero Three Zero label, beginning with the release of the ''It's My First Time Here'' EP (7 December 2012) and the subsequent release of the ''Remember The Future'' album (8 April 2013).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dance.nl/nieuws/tinlicker-remember-the-future-album-release_3702.html|title=TINLICKER - REMEMBER THE FUTURE ALBUM RELEASE - Persberichten - Nieuws|website=Dance.nl}}</ref>

Through a mutual contact, Jordi van Achthoven (born 4 June 1983 in Gouda, The Netherlands) connected with Micha in 2014. Both artists were inspired by [[Paul Kalkbrenner]], [[Trentemøller]], and [[Moderat]]. They decided to continue as a duo and started working with Feed Me's Sotto Voce label. They released three EP's with Feed Me: ''Like No Other'' (1 December 2014), ''Into The Open'' (14 April 2015), and ''The Space In Between'' including "Oudegracht" (4 September 2015). The latter garnered significant online attention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.djtimes.com/2015/08/tinlicker-releases-the-space-in-between-on-feed-mes-sotto-voce-imprint/|title=Tinlicker Releases 'The Space In Between' on Feed Me's Sotto Voce Imprint|date=25 August 2015}}</ref>
