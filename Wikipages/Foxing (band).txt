'''Foxing''' is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. The band has released four studio albums and an EP, as well as a pair of split albums and a single.

==History==
Foxing began in 2011 following the end of the group Hunter Gatherer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hntrgthrr.bandcamp.com/|title=hunter gatherer|date=January 2, 2012|work=hunter gatherer|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}</ref> a [[post-rock]] band active from 2008 to 2010 that featured Josh Coll, Jon Hellwig and Matthew Piva. The initial lineup of the band shortly expanded to include Conor Murphy, who was then the bassist of the then active emo group Family Might and formerly the vocalist of the indie/post-rock band Torchlight Red. It also included guitarist Ben Helman of the melodic post-punk band Eagle Scout.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Your wikipedia page lists Thomas Pini - Guitar... {{!}} FOXING|url = http://foxingtheband.tumblr.com/post/132650297018/your-wikipedia-page-lists-thomas-pini-guitar|website = foxingtheband.tumblr.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024803/http://foxingtheband.tumblr.com/post/132650297018/your-wikipedia-page-lists-thomas-pini-guitar|archive-date = 2015-11-17|url-status = dead}}</ref> In late 2011, Helman left the group, and Jim Fitzpatrick of Falsetto Boy and Muscle Brain took his place. During their formation period, the band had briefly considered naming themselves She Hums in Swarms before permanently settling on the name Foxing in October 2011.

In January 2012, the band proceeded to record the ''Old Songs'' EP. Foxing's lineup changed again with the replacement of guitarists Piva and Fitzpatrick with Samuel Naumann of Torchlight Red in March 2012 and Ricky Sampson of the emo/math-rock group Badgerhunt in April.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Foxing - Ricky Sampson from the band Badgerhunt will be... {{!}} Facebook|url = https://www.facebook.com/FoxingTheBand/posts/355209987849537|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}</ref> Naumann soon departed the band in May 2012, and Thomas Pini, who was the lead vocalist and guitarist of Family Might, filled his place.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Foxing - Tommy Pini from the band Family Might will be... {{!}} Facebook|url = https://www.facebook.com/FoxingTheBand/posts/391233630913839|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}</ref> Foxing released the previously recorded "Old Songs" in August 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Old Songs, by Foxing|url = https://foxingtheband.bandcamp.com/album/old-songs|website = Foxing|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}</ref> In February 2013, Foxing released a split with Send Away Stranger on the Saint Louis-based DIY label Carucage Records and another split with [[Japanese Breakfast]].

On July 3, 2015 the band's trailer was stolen along with $30,000 worth of musical equipment after a show in [[Austin, Texas]]. In addition to the entirety of the band's equipment, the trailer also contained all of the band's merchandise, personal items and equipment belonging to the tour's opening band Lithuania. The band was forced to cancel several shows, but still managed to play select dates using borrowed equipment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wasoba |first1=Ryan |title=Foxing's Trailer Stolen in Austin, Texas with $30,000 Worth of Gear Inside |url=https://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2015/07/03/foxings-trailer-stolen-in-austin-texas-with-30000-worth-of-gear-inside |website=Riverfront Times |access-date=12 September 2021 |date=3 July 2015}}</ref> Afterward, Foxing headed on a co-headling tour that winter along with [[The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/the_world_is_a_beautiful_place_i_am_no_longer_afraid_to_die_foxing_announce/|title=The World Is A Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid To Die, Foxing announce co-headlining tour|website=Altpress.com|date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> The theft occurred despite a concerted effort by the band to prevent their equipment from being stolen. Coll said, {{quote|We have three top-of-the-line locks on our trailer [...] we broke a key inside of one of these locks a while ago, and it took us four days to find somebody who could get it open. We saw some of the rubber casings from those locks on the ground, so we know they tried to get in that way. We also have the trailer hard-locked to the hitch, and they popped that lock. They must have lifted it.. which is insane.. and moved it to their vehicle to drive it off.}}

In March and April 2016, the band went on a headline tour of the United States with support from [[Lymbyc Systym]], [[O'Brother]] & Tancred. Immediately afterward, they embarked on their first headlining tour of the UK and Europe with support from [[TTNG]]. This tour included dates in Copenhagen, Denmark and Reykjavik, Iceland (with 2016 Phonofile Nordic Music Prize nominee, Teitur Magnússon). Foxing toured with [[Balance & Composure]] in October and November 2016.

Foxing has made festival appearances at Shaky Knees, Bunbury, Wrecking Ball, Pygmalion among others.

On December 7, 2017, founding member and bass guitarist Josh Coll announced that he was leaving the band to pursue a career in filmmaking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2017/12/08/bassist-josh-coll-parts-ways-with-foxing|title=Bassist Josh Coll Parts Ways with Foxing|first=Daniel|last=Hill|website=Riverfronttimes.com|accessdate=2020-03-17}}</ref>

On June 18, 2018, Foxing announced their third studio album, ''Nearer My God'', which was released on August 10 through Triple Crown Records. They also released a music video for the lead single "Slapstick", directed by Coll.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2001885/foxing-nearer-my-god-interview/|title=Foxing Present The Apocalypse|last=Cohen|first=Ian|date=2018-06-19|work=Stereogum|access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref>

On September 30, 2020, guitarist Ricky Sampson announced that he was leaving the band.

Following the release of the two singles "Speak With the Dead" and "Go Down Together" on March 18, 2021 and April 15, 2021, respectively, on May 27, 2021 Foxing announced their fourth album ''Draw Down the Moon'', with the release of the single "Where the Lightning Strikes Twice".
