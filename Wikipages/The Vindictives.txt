'''The Vindictives''' are an American, [[Chicago]]-based [[punk rock]] group, founded by singer and songwriter Joey Vindictive in 1991, releasing 12 EPs and albums by July 1996.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name=jughead/>

==History==
They began their career in 1991, cutting their first 7" record later that year with the lineup of Joey Vindictive (vocals), Johnny Personality (bass), [[Ben Weasel]] (guitar), Dr. Bob (guitar), and Erik Elsewhere (drums).<ref name=allmusic/> Weasel was soon to be replaced by Billy Blastoff on guitar, and Elsewhere was soon to be replaced by P.J. Parti on drums.<ref name=punkUSA/>

The band broke up in 1996 due to Joey Vindictive's health issues.  They would re-form in 2000.<ref name=allmusic/>

Guitarist Robert "Dr. Bob" Nielsen died of a [[heroin]] [[overdose]] on February 22, 2003.<ref name=punknews/> After Dr. Bob's death, The Vindictives released a pair of records containing material previously unavailable on CD and two new re-recordings; ''Muzak for Robots'' which was quirky electronic instrumental versions of their songs and ''Unplugged'' soft and toned-down acoustic versions of their works. The [[Razorcake]] review read "This really is muzak. No, really".<ref name=razorcake/>

In 2004, Billy Blastoff left the Vindictives of his own accord took a year off music joined Lucky Savage in Chicago, Il as their drummer eventually forming the Gornys and switching over to bass in 2005<ref name=gornys/> eventually renamed the John Doh's in 2010 and currently on hiatus.

In 2006, Shot Baker and Vacation Bible School released a limited edition of 500 pressing Split 7" on Chicago's Underground Communique Records featuring The Vindictives' "Future Homemakers of America", "Glad to Be", "Assembly Line", and "Automoton".<ref name=interpunk/>

In 2006, Joey Vindictive and Johnny Personality started to demo material under Joey Vindictive & The Personality Crisis. The two performed under the name Faerie Wunderpuss, releasing a split 12" LP with Chicago's own Alla, an experimental heavy rock psychedelia band, and is said to be in the vein of Queens of the Stone Age. In addition to possible new material surfacing, Joey Vindictive launched a new theatre art program called The 1901 Gallery Theatre with wife, Jenny, and bandmate, Johnny Personality.<ref name=1901g/> In 2011, Billy Blastoff joined Magatha Trysty a culmination of power pop and punk rock sensibility as their bass player.<ref name=blastoff/>

On December 4, 2012, the Vindictives released their first new material in 13 years with an EP titled "Mono Flexi".<ref name=punknews2/><ref name=mono/>

In 2013, the Vindictives digitally released a Halloween EP entitled "Jerk-O-Lantern" which featured 13 songs recorded on Friday the 13th, 2013 and is a total of 13 minutes and 13 seconds in length.<ref name=punknews4/>
