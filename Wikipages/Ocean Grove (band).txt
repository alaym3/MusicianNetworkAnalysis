'''Ocean Grove''' are an Australian [[nu metal]] band formed in 2010. The band consists of vocalist Dale Tanner, drummer Sam Bassal and bassist Twiggy Hunter. Studio-only member Running Touch also provides synthesizers and production. 

As of 2021, the band has released two studio albums; ''[[The Rhapsody Tapes]]'' (2017) and ''[[Flip Phone Fantasy]]'' (2020), and two EP's; ''Outsider'' (2013) and ''Black Label'' (2016). Both EP's and The Rhapsody Tapes featured the original line-up with vocalist Luke Holmes and guitarist Jimmy Hall before their departure in 2018. 

==History==
===2010–2016: Formation and EPs===

Ocean Grove were formed in 2010 in Melbourne, Australia, originally as a post-hardcore band by Luke Holmes (lead vocals), Dale Tanner (vocals/bass), Running Touch, Jimmy Hall (guitar) and Matias Morales (drums/vocals). This line-up released a demo in 2010, followed by their debut extended play, ''Outsider'' in 2013, before Morales departed the band later that year and was replaced by Sam Bassal. A single was released in late 2013 called "The Dead Years". In 2014, Running Touch stopped touring with the band to focus on his solo project, while remaining as a studio member and Matt Henley was brought in as an additional guitarist. On 12 June 2015, the band released their second extended play, ''[[Black Label (Ocean Grove EP)|Black Label]]'', which peaked at No.&nbsp;50 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref name="AUS Charts">{{cite web | url = https://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Ocean+Grove | title = Discography Ocean Grove | website=australian-charts.com | access-date = 29 October 2018 }}</ref> It was followed by the Black Label Tour around Australia in July 2015 with support from [[DVSR|Devastator]] and [[Void of Vision]].<ref name="FB Events">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/392152957645679/|title=Ocean Grove 'Black Label' Tour w/ Void of Vision & Devastator|website=facebook.com}}</ref> The band was a supporting act, alongside [[Like Moths to Flames]], [[Buried in Verona]] and [[August Burns Red]] for [[Northlane]]'s headlining Australian tour in November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.speakertv.com/news/tours-events/northlane-announce-headline-tour-with-support-of-august-burns-red-ocean-grove-more/|title=Northlane announce headline tour with support of August Burns Red, Ocean Grove + more!|website=speakertv.com|access-date=29 July 2015}}</ref> In 2016, Ocean Grove supported both [[In Hearts Wake]] and [[Northlane]] on their "Equinox" dual-headlining tour.
