He began his career in 1990s as a member of the rap trio [[The Lox]], managed by [[Ruff Ryders]] and signed with [[Bad Boy Entertainment|Bad Boy]]. After leaving the label in 1999, they signed a joint venture deal between [[Interscope]] and Ruff Ryders. He is currently signed to [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] and D-Block.

Jadakiss' debut solo album, ''[[Kiss Tha Game Goodbye]]'', was released in 2001. He has released three more solo studio albums, another album with the Lox, and an album with fellow rapper [[Fabolous]]. In 2007, Jadakiss signed with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc-A-Fella]] and [[Def Jam]], which, with [[Ruff Ryders]], co-released his 2009 album ''[[The Last Kiss (album)|The Last Kiss]]''. Altogether, he has released five studio albums, most recently ''[[Ignatius (album)|Ignatius]]'' in 2020.

== Early life ==

Jadakiss was born on May 27, 1975, in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and had an interest in hip hop from an early age. At age 12, he began hustling after his parents asked him to earn his own money. He began [[freestyle rap]]ping for money after watching other people do it on the street corner. While freestyling, he eventually met longtime friends [[Sheek Louch]] and [[Styles P]].

==Career==
Phillips quickly developed a small underground fanbase and at the age of 12, entered himself into a freestyle competition in Florida where he attracted the attention of the owners of [[Ruff Ryders Entertainment]]. Along with Styles and Louch, he formed a group known as '''The Warlox''', and the trio began rapping together. They eventually met [[Mary J. Blige]], who, impressed with their lyrics, handed their demo to [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]], who signed the group to his label [[Bad Boy Entertainment]].<ref name="hiphopscriptures.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.hiphopscriptures.com/jadakiss/ |title= Jadakiss Biography|website=Hip Hop Scriptures|access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref>

===1994–2000: The Lox===
Upon signing with Bad Boy, Puff Daddy shortened the group's name from The Warlocks to simply The Lox. They made their first appearance on [[Main Source]]'s 1994 LP ''[[Fuck What You Think]]'' on the track "Set it Off."<ref name="hiphopscriptures.com"/> They immediately began writing and performing on hit songs with fellow Bad Boy artists, including Puff Daddy's "It's All About the Benjamins" and "I Got the Power", [[Mase|Mase's]] "24 Hrs. to Live", [[Mariah Carey|Mariah Carey's]] "Honey", [[Mary J. Blige|Mary J. Blige's]] "Can't Get You Off My Mind" and [[The Notorious B.I.G.|The Notorious B.I.G.'s]] "Last Day". The group developed a close relationship with B.I.G., during which time Jadakiss especially was taken under his wing. The Lox's first hit song was a tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. in the wake of his 1997 death, titled "We'll Always Love Big Poppa". The song was chosen as the [[B-side]] to [[Puff Daddy|Puff Daddy's]] smash hit B.I.G. tribute song "[[I'll Be Missing You]]", and received widespread commercial success, achieving [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] status from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The success and reception of the song opened the door for them to write more of their own songs, and in 1998, the Lox released their debut studio album, ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]''. The album was both a commercial and critical success, peaking at number 3 on the [[Billboard 200]]<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/The-LOX/chart-history/billboard-200|title=The Lox Chart History (Billboard 200)| work= billboard.com|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> and number 1 on the US [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]]<ref name="billboard.com1">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/The-LOX/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-albums| title= The Lox Chart History (R&B Hip-Hop Albums)|work= billboard.com |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> chart, and went on to achieve platinum status. Though the record was successful, The Lox grew unhappy with [[Bad Boy Records]] and [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]]'s glossy, radio friendly production, feeling it conflicted with their grimier street aesthetic. Following the release of their debut album, the group left the label to sign with [[Ruff Ryders Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theo2.co.uk/events/detail/the-loxd-block-jadakiss-style-p-sheek-louch-trinity-tour|title=The Lox/D-Block Jadakiss, Styles P & Sheek Louch Trinity Tour |website= theo2.co.uk|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> They released their second album, We Are The Streets in 2000, through Ruff Ryders. The album was once again a success, peaking at number 5 on the Billboard 200 and number 2 on the US Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.<ref name="billboard.com"/><ref name="billboard.com1"/> It featured production from [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[Timbaland]], and spawned one single, "[[Ryde or Die, Bitch|Ryde Or Die, Bitch]]", featuring fellow Ruff Ryders artist [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]].

===2001–2007: Solo career===
Jadakiss began embarking on a solo career in 2001 and his debut album, ''[[Kiss Tha Game Goodbye]]'', was released in August 2001 on the Ruff Ryders/[[Interscope Records|Interscope]] label. The album featured popular guests and producers such as [[DJ Premier]], [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], Eve, [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Nas]] and [[Swizz Beatz]] and was commercially successful, going on to be certified [[RIAA Certification|gold]] by the RIAA and selling over 200,000 copies during its first week of release. Despite commercial success, the album received negative reception from critics who criticised the album for being repetitive and uninspired.  Jadakiss has acknowledged the criticism as valid, saying the record was done less out of inspiration but rather out of contractual obligations to Bad Boy.<ref name="hiphopscriptures.com"/> The album produced three singles, "We Gonna Make It" featuring [[Styles P]], "Knock Yourself Out" and "Put Ya Hands Up". Jadakiss followed this album with ''[[Kiss of Death (Jadakiss album)|Kiss of Death]]'', released in June 2004. It features guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, [[Eminem]], The Lox, [[Kanye West]], [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Nate Dogg]], [[DJ Quik]] and more. His song [[Why (Jadakiss song)|"Why?"]], featuring [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]] and produced by [[Havoc (rapper)|Havoc]] of [[Mobb Deep]], became one of the year's biggest hits, spawning a remix featuring Styles P, [[Common (rapper)|Common]] and [[Nas]]. "Why?" remains Jadakiss' biggest hit, peaking at #11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song also garnered controversy for a line in which Jadakiss claims that he believes [[George W. Bush]] planned the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]]. Another single from the record, "[[U Make Me Wanna (Jadakiss song)|U Make Me Wanna]]," featuring [[Mariah Carey]] peaked at number 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. The album was both a commercial and critical success, receiving better reviews than his previous album and debuted at number 1 on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums charts. In late 2007, Jadakiss signed to Jay-Z's [[Roc-A-Fella Records]], a move Jay had been trying to arrange for a long time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5891/title.jay-z-news-bits-jadakiss-40-40-american-gangster|title=Jay-Z News Bits (Jadakiss, 40/40 & American Gangster)| website= hiphopdx.com|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5969/title.jadakiss-signs-with-roc-a-fella-records | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071117131456/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5969/title.jadakiss-signs-with-roc-a-fella-records| archive-date= 2007-11-17| date= 15 November 2007 |title=Jadakiss Signs With Roc-A-Fella Records |first= Jake |last= Paine | website= hiphopdx.com|access-date= 27 April 2020}}</ref> The move came on the heels of increased D-Block/Roc-a-Fella collaborations; in 2006, Jadakiss and former rival [[Beanie Sigel]] collaborated on [[DJ Khaled]]'s album ''[[Listennn... the Album]]'', and in 2007, on [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]]'s album ''[[Free at Last (Freeway album)|Free At Last]]''. Styles P appeared on a radio freestyle with Freeway and [[Beanie Sigel|Sigel]], and also appeared briefly in the video for Jay-Z's ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]'' single "[[Roc Boys]]," in which he throws up the famous Roc-a-Fella sign, "the Diamond."

=== 2009–2015: ''The Last Kiss'' and ''Top 5 Dead or Alive'' ===
[[File:Jadakiss 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Jadakiss in June 2011.]]
In 2009, Jadakiss released his much-delayed and anticipated third studio album, ''[[The Last Kiss (album)|The Last Kiss]]''. The first single, "[[By My Side (Jadakiss song)|By My Side]]" featuring [[Ne-Yo]] was released in October 2008. Two more singles, "Can't Stop Me" and "Death Wish" featuring Lil Wayne, were released in 2009. One more single, "Who's Real", featuring [[Swizz Beatz]] and [[OJ Da Juiceman]] released later that year.

On June 4, 2013, Jadakiss released the first single from his by then upcoming fourth studio album, ''[[Top 5, Dead or Alive]]'' titled "Big Boy Dialogue", featuring vocals from [[The-Dream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapdose.com/2013/05/30/jadakiss-big-boy-dialogue-feat-the-dream |title=Jadakiss – Big Boy Dialogue (Feat.

===Legal issues===
In July 5, 2004, Jadakiss was arrested in [[North Carolina]] on marijuana and illicit gun-possession charges.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jadakiss Busted For Celebrating Fourth Of July With A Bang| first= Shaheem| last= Reid|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489247/jadakiss-busted.jhtml|publisher=Mtv.com|date=Jul 7, 2004|access-date=2012-12-13}}</ref><ref name="24hourhiphop">{{cite web|title=Jadakiss Arrested In New York|url=http://24hourhiphop.com/hip+hop+News/Jadakiss+Arrested+In+New+York/1071/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201063922/http://24hourhiphop.com/hip+hop+News/Jadakiss+Arrested+In+New+York/1071/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-02-01|publisher=24hourhiphop.com|access-date=2012-12-13}}</ref> Several months later, he reached a plea agreement on misdemeanor charges and was ordered to pay a $900 fine.<ref name="24hourhiphop"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Jadakiss Can Avoid Gun And Drug Charges If He Behaves| first= Gil| last= Kaufman |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1499015/jadakiss-on-threemonth-probation.jhtml|publisher=Mtv.com|date=Mar 25, 2005|access-date=2012-12-13}}</ref>

On October 7, 2006, Jadakiss was once again arrested in his hometown of Yonkers, New York on gun and drug-possession charges.<ref name="24hourhiphop"/><ref name="MTV-Arrested">{{cite web|title=Jadakiss Arrested On Gun, Drug-Possession Charges|author=Shaheem Reid, with additional reporting by Jem Aswad|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1542616/jadakiss-arrested-on-gun-drugpossession-charges.jhtml|date=October 7, 2007 |work= MTV.com |access-date=2012-12-13}}</ref> A Yonkers Police Department spokesperson said Jadakiss was one of four men sitting in a 2006 Toyota Camry that was parked near the intersection of Nepperhan Avenue and Elm Street in Yonkers at around 5 a.m. Saturday. Officers said the vehicle's driver was behaving oddly and said they noticed a strong odor of marijuana while approaching the car. Inside the vehicle, police found a .38 caliber revolver that had been reported stolen. According to The Associated Press, the weapon was loaded.<ref name="24hourhiphop"/><ref name="MTV-Arrested"/> All occupants were charged with possession of a stolen firearm; Jadakiss was also charged with possession of marijuana (a small amount was found on his person).<ref name="24hourhiphop"/><ref name="MTV-Arrested"/> The driver, Darnell Frazier, was charged with driving under the influence. The other two men in the vehicle are listed as Benjamin Lockhart and Kristian Smith. All were remanded to Westchester County Jail and were held until at least Tuesday of the following week, when they were due in court.<ref name="MTV-Arrested"/>

===House raid===
Police arrested two men on multiple felony charges after they raided Jadakiss' Yonkers, New York apartment and found heroin (5 grams) and marijuana (6.5 pounds).<ref>{{cite web|last=Gittens |first=Hasani |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Cops-Find-Weed-Heroin-at-Jadakiss-House-54800457.html |title=Cops Find Weed, Heroin at Jadakiss' House |publisher=NBC New York |access-date=2012-12-13}}</ref> Jadakiss was neither present during the investigation, nor wanted by the law enforcement agencies. The incident took place on the morning of August 24, 2009, and started when an investigation revealed the presence of marijuana inside the vehicle driven by two men. Both men were reportedly in police custody and had been criminally charged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/latest-headlines/2009/08/jadakiss%E2%80%99s-home-raided-weed-heroin-found|title=Jadakiss's Home Raided, Weed & Heroin Found|work=XXL Mag}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===50 Cent===
In 2004, Jadakiss and [[Fat Joe]] were featured on a song by [[Ja Rule]] titled "[[New York (Ja Rule song)|New York]]". In this song, Ja Rule accuses [[50 Cent]] of being a snitch, and also takes shots at 50's [[G Unit]] group. In turn, 50 Cent released a song titled "[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]" in which he disses Fat Joe and Jadakiss among others for performing on the song.  This caused Jadakiss to release numerous 50 Cent diss tracks, including "Checkmate", "Problem Child", "Shots Fired" and "[[I'm Sorry Ms. Jackson]]". 50 Cent along with his G-Unit crew responded with songs such as "[[I Run New York]]", "[[Window Shopper]]", and "Death Wish" by [[Lloyd Banks]]. Jadakiss challenged 50 Cent to an onstage battle in Madison Square Garden for 1 million dollars, but 50 Cent declined. The feud was later resolved, with Jadakiss and G-Unit performing together at 50 Cent's ThisIs50 Festival on October 3, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622984/20091004/50_cent.jhtml| title = 50 Cent Unites NYC Hip-Hop At ThisIs50 Festival|publisher=Mtv.com|access-date=2012-12-13}}</ref>

===Bill O'Reilly===
Jadakiss attracted controversy and condemnation from political commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] in 2004, who labeled him a "smear merchant" due to lyrics in his hit song [[Why (Jadakiss song)|"Why?"]], in which Jadakiss lyrically implied [[George W. Bush]] coordinated the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], with the line "Why do niggas push pounds of [[cocaine|powder]]? Why did [[9/11 conspiracy theories|Bush knock down the towers]]?"<ref name=AP-2004>{{cite news| url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-07-16-jadakiss-bush_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Rapper Jadakiss blames Bush for Sept. 11 in new song | date=July 18, 2004 | access-date=May 5, 2010|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Jadakiss said the line was a metaphor for Bush administration not doing enough to stop the attacks.<ref name=AP-2004/>

In the music video for "Why?", a man holds up a picket sign reading "Buck Fush" (a [[spoonerism]] of "[[Fuck]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]]"). O'Reilly took the position that the President should be allowed to sue Jadakiss for [[slander]]. The track was eventually banned on some radio stations or played with the lyrics in question censored.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.counterbias.com/news007.html| date= May 22, 2004 | title= Rapper Jadakiss, in New Song Lyric, Suggests Bush Complicity in 9/11 Attacks| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514235803/http://www.counterbias.com/news007.html| archive-date= May 14, 2006| website= counterbias.com| access-date= April 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name=AP-2004/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,125675,00.html | work=Fox News | title=The Smearing of America Continues | first=Bill | last=O'Reilly | date=July 14, 2004}}</ref>
