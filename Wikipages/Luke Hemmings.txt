[...] I grew up in a small house in the middle of nowhere".<ref name=":022"/> When he was 10 years old, Hemmings' brothers taught him how to play guitar, later prompting him to take professional lessons and learning from [[YouTube]] tutorial videos to learn how to play the instrument.<ref name=":0" /> Eventually, Hemmings began [[busking]] throughout his tween years.<ref name=":22">{{cite web|title=5 Seconds Of Summer on their addiction to rally hot girls.

In [[Year Seven|Year 7]], Hemmings switched schools, attending Norwest Christian College, where he met future band-mates, [[Calum Hood]] and [[Michael Clifford (musician)|Michael Clifford]], later revealing that he initially disliked and was "enemies" with Clifford.<ref name=":12">{{cite web|title=5 Seconds of Summer Band Members Were Once Frenemies|url=https://people.com/celebrity/5-seconds-of-summer-band-members-were-once-frenemies/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515044235/http://people.com/celebrity/5-seconds-of-summer-band-members-were-once-frenemies/|archive-date=15 May 2017|access-date=2020-05-24|website=People}}</ref> Hemmings eventually befriended Hood after they performed a [[Secondhand Serenade]] cover at a school talent show, and later befriended Clifford after learning they had similar music taste.<ref name=":0" />
Following the band's rise to fame, Hemmings continued with his high school education, opting to switch to [[distance learning]].
