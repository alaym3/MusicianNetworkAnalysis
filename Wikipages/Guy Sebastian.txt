Artists like Otis Redding, [[Sam & Dave]] and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched in that sort of environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. Do what you want to do. Do what comes natural to you'. [...] From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyPY5gtqZyU Guy Sebastian Interview - Armageddon].
