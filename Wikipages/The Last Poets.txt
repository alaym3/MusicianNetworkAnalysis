'''The Last Poets''' are several groups of poets and musicians who arose from the late 1960s [[African-American]] civil rights movement's [[black nationalism]]. The name is taken from a poem by the [[South Africa]]n revolutionary poet [[Keorapetse Kgositsile]], who believed he was in the last era of poetry before guns would take over. The original users of that name were the trio of Abiodun Oyewole, [[Gylan Kain]], and [[David Nelson (poet)|David Nelson]].

The versions of the group led by [[Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin]] and [[Umar Bin Hassan]] had the largest impact on popular culture. The Last Poets were one of the earliest influences on [[hip-hop music]]. Critic Jason Ankeny wrote: "With their politically charged raps, taut rhythms, and dedication to raising African-American consciousness, the Last Poets almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for the emergence of hip-hop."<ref>Ankeny, Jason, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6947|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com profile of Last Poets]; accessed February 01, 2007.</ref> The [[United Kingdom|British]] music magazine ''[[NME]]'' stated, "Serious spokesmen like [[Gil Scott-Heron]], The Last Poets, and later [[Gary Byrd]], paved the way for the many socially committed Black [emcees] a decade later."<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

==History==

The [[Original Last Poets]] were formed on May 19, 1968 ([[Malcolm X]]'s birthday), at Mount Morris Park (now known as [[Marcus Garvey Park]]) in [[East Harlem]].  On October 24th 1968, the group performed on pioneering New York television program ''[[Soul!]]''.<ref>"{{cite web |url=http://www.thirteen.org/soul/soul-episode-guide-1968-1973/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401232551/http://www.thirteen.org/soul/soul-episode-guide-1968-1973/ |archive-date=2017-04-01 }}", SOUL! EPISODE LIST, 1968-1973, WNET, thirteen.org.</ref>

Luciano, Kain, Abiodune Oyewole and Nelson recorded separately as '''The Original Last Poets''', gaining some renown as the [[soundtrack]] artists (without Oyewole) of the 1971 film ''Right On!''

In 1972, they appeared on Black Forum Records album ''Black Spirits - Festival Of New Black Poets In America'' with "And See Her Image In The River" and "Song of Ditla, part II", recorded live at the Apollo Theatre, Harlem, New York.  A book of the same name was published by [[Random House]] (1972 - {{ISBN|9780394476209}}).

The original group actually consisted of Gylan Kain, David Nelson and Abiodun Oyewole. Following their get-together on May 19, 1968 ([[Malcolm X]]'s birthday), at [[Marcus Garvey Park]], the group coalesced via a 1969 [[Harlem]] writers' workshop known as East Wind. When Nelson left, he was replaced by Felipe Luciano, who would later leave to establish the Young Lords. When Kain and Nelson then began to pursue other interests (theater and ministry respectively), Abiodun Oyewole "recruited" Alafia Pudim (later known as Jalaluddin Mansur) and Umar bin Hassan in an attempt to replace the founding members of the group. Following the success of the newly refigured Last Poets first album, founding members Kain and Nelson got together with Luciano and recorded their only album ''Right On'' in 1970, the soundtrack to a documentary movie of the same name that finally saw release in 1971. <!--some sources list the film as a 1968 production--> (See also ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'' (1970 film featuring [[Mick Jagger]]) soundtrack song "Wake Up, Niggers".) Following a legal battle between the two groups concerning ownership of the band's name, The ''Right On'' album was released under the group name The Original Last Poets to simultaneously establish the founding members' primacy and distance themselves from the other group of the same name.<ref name="Lest We Forget: The true story of the Last Poets by Abiodun Oyewole">Article in ''Blues and Soul'' (April 1981)</ref> 

[[Jalal Mansur Nuriddin]] a.k.a. Alafia Pudim, [[Umar Bin Hassan]], and [[Abiodun Oyewole]], along with poet Sulaiman El-Hadi and percussionist [http://www.facebook.com/raymondmachurrey Nilaja Obabi (Raymond "Mac" Hurrey]), are generally considered the best-known members of the various lineups. Jalal, Umar, and Nilaja appeared on the group's 1970 self-titled debut LP and follow-up ''This Is Madness''. Nilija then left, and a third poet, Sulaiman El-Hadi, was added. This Jalal-Sulaiman version of the group made six albums together but recorded only sporadically without much promotion after 1977.

Having reached [[United States|US]] [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[record chart|chart]] success with its debut album, the Last Poets went on to release the follow-up, ''[[This Is Madness]]'', without then-incarcerated Abiodun Oyewole. The album featured more politically charged poetry that resulted in the group being listed under the [[counter-intelligence]] program [[COINTELPRO]] during the [[Richard Nixon]] administration. Hassan left the group following ''This Is Madness'' to be replaced by Sulaiman El-Hadi (now deceased)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandfatherofrap.com/prologue.htm |title=Grandfather of Rap R.A.P - Revolutionary Arts Proverbalization |website=Grandfatherofrap.com |date=1995-10-03 |access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref> in time for ''Chastisment'' (1972). The album introduced a sound the group called "jazzoetry", leaving behind the spare percussion of the previous albums in favor of a blending of [[jazz]] and [[funk]] instrumentation with [[poetry]]. The music further developed into free-jazz–poetry with Hassan's brief return on [[Blue Thumb Records|Blue Thumb]] album ''At Last'' (1973),<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=py0rDwAAQBAJ&q=blue+thumb+records++last+poets+1973&pg=PA20|title=Broadening the Contours in the Study of Black Politics: Citizenship and Popular Culture|last=Mitchell|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1-351-53062-0|pages=20|language=en}}</ref> as yet the only Last Poets release still unavailable on [[Compact disc|CD]].

The remainder of the 1970s saw a decline in the group's popularity in America, although they became quite popular in Europe. In the 1980s and beyond, however, the group gained renown with the rise of [[hip-hop music]], often being name-checked as grandfathers and founders of the new movement, often citing the Jalaluddin solo project ''Hustler's Convention'' (1973) as their inspiration. Because of this the band was also interviewed in the 1986 cult documentary ''[[Big Fun In The Big Town]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2323202|title=Big Fun in the Big Town (1986)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref> Nuriddin and El-Hadi worked on several projects under the Last Poets name, working with bassist and producer [[Bill Laswell]], including 1984's ''Oh My People'' and 1988's '' Freedom Express'', and recording the final El Hadi–Nuriddin collaboration, prominent Attorney Gregory J Reed reunited Original Poets in NY [ day of Nelson Mandela coincidentally is released from Prison,27 years] and recorded Poets live in Detroit's Orchestra Hall , and produced "The Return of the Original Last Poets Docudrama"  Kain,Lupe,Oyewole and Nelson after 20 years in 1990,''Scatterrap/Home'', in 1994.  The group, led by Hassan, also made a guest appearance in [[John Singleton]]'s 1993 film ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]''.

Sulaiman El-Hadi died in October 1995. Oyewole and Hassan began recording separately under the same name, releasing ''Holy Terror'' in 1995 (re-released on Innerhythmic in 2004) and ''Time Has Come'' in 1997. Meanwhile, Nuriddin released the solo CD's ''On The One'' (1996), ''The Fruits of Rap'' (1997) and ''Science Friction'' (2004) under the abbreviated name "Jalal." 

In 2005, the Last Poets found fame again refreshed through a collaboration where the trio (Umar Bin Hassan) was featured with hip-hop artist [[Common (rapper)|Common]] on the [[Kanye West]]-produced song "[[The Corner (song)|The Corner]]," as well as (Abiodun Oyewole) with the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]-affiliated political hip-hop group [[Black Market Militia]] on the song "The Final Call," stretching overseas to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on songs "Organic Liquorice (Natural Woman)", "Voodoocore", and "A Name" with Shaka Amazulu the 7th. The group is also featured on the [[Nas]] album ''[[Untitled (Nas album)|Untitled]]'', on the songs "You Can't Stop Us Now" and "Project Roach." Individual members of the group also collaborated with [[Grand Mixer DXT|DST]] on a remake of "Mean Machine", [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] on a remake of "White Man's Got A God Complex" and with  [[Bristol]]-based [[United Kingdom|British]] [[post-punk]] band [[the Pop Group]].

In 2010, Abiodun Oyowele was among the artists featured on [[the Welfare Poets]]' produced ''Cruel And Unusual Punishment'', a CD compilation that was made in protest of the [[death penalty]], which also featured some several current positive hip hop artists.

In 2004 [[Jalal Mansur Nuriddin]], a.k.a. Alafia Pudim, a.k.a. Lightning Rod (The Hustlers Convention 1973), collaborated with the UK-based poet [[Mark T. Watson]] (a.k.a. [[Malik Al Nasir]]) writing the foreword to Watson's debut poetry collection, ''Ordinary Guy'', published in December 2004 by the [[Liverpool]]-based publisher Fore-Word Press.<ref name="Fore"/> Jalal's foreword was written in rhyme, and was recorded for a collaborative album "Rhythms of the Diaspora (Vol. 1 & 2 - Unreleased) by [[Malik Al Nasir]]'s band, [[Malik & the O.G's]] featuring [[Gil Scott-Heron]], percussionist [[Larry McDonald (musician)|Larry McDonald]], drummers Rod Youngs and Swiss Chris, New York [[Dub poetry|dub poet]] Ras Tesfa, and a host of young rappers from New York and [[Washington, D.C.]] Produced by Malik Al Nasir, and Swiss Chris, the albums ''Rhythms of the Diaspora; Vol. 1 & 2'' are the first of their kind to unite these pioneers of poetry and hip hop with each other.<ref name="Fore">{{cite web|url=http://www.fore-word.com |title=fore-word press |website=Fore-word.com |access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref>

In 2011, The Last Poets [[Abiodun Oyewole]] and [[Umar Bin Hassan]] performed at [[The Jazz Cafe]] in London, in a tribute concert to the late [[Gil Scott-Heron]] and all the former Last Poets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getoutgigging.wordpress.com/2011/07/10/the-last-poets-jazz-cafe-london-sun-10th-july-2011/ |title=The Last Poets, Jazz Cafe, London.

In 2014, Last Poet [[Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin]] came to London and also performed at [[The Jazz Cafe]] with [[Jazz Warriors]] the first ever live performance in 40 years of the now iconic "Hustlers Convention". The event was produced by Fore-Word Press and featured Liverpool poet [[Malik Al Nasir]] with his band [[Malik & the O.G's]] featuring [[Cleveland Watkiss]], [[Orphy Robinson]] and [[Tony Remy]]. The event was filmed as part of a documentary on the "Hustlers Convention" by Manchester film maker Mike Todd and Riverhorse Communications. The executive producer was [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s [[Chuck D]]. As part of the event [[Charly Records]] re-issued a special limited edition of the vinyl version of Hustlers Convention to celebrate their 40th anniversary. The event was MC'd by poet [[Lemn Sissay]] and the DJ was [[Shiftless Shuffle]]'s [[Perry Louis]].

In 2016, ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/cka/Last-Poets-Christine-Otten/9462380376/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1482146367&sr=1-1&keywords=the+last+poets The Last Poets]'' (World Editions, UK), was published. The novel, written by Christine Otten, was originally published in Dutch in 2011, and has now been translated by Jonathan Reeder for English readers.

In May of 2018, The Last Poets released ''Understand What Black Is'', their first album since 1997. The album featured tributes to late artists [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]].<ref>{{cite web
