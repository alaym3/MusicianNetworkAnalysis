'''Frederick John Elgersma''' (born July 9, 1957), known by the stage name '''Fred Eaglesmith''', is a Canadian [[alternative country]] singer-songwriter.<ref name="Publishing2005">{{cite journal|author=Here Publishing|title=The Advocate|journal=The Advocate the National Gay & Lesbian Newsmagazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-GMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65|date=March 29, 2005|publisher=Here Publishing|pages=65–|issn=0001-8996}}</ref> He is known for writing songs about vehicles, rural life, down-and-out characters, lost love and quirky rural folk. His songwriting uses techniques of short story writing, including [[unreliable narrator]]s, surprise endings, and plot twists.  In 2016, Eaglesmith toured extensively with his band.<ref>[http://exclaim.ca/music/article/fred_eaglesmith_explains_his_creative_push_forward_with_tambourine " Fred Eaglesmith Explains His Creative Push Forward with 'Tambourine'"]. ''Exclaim!'', By Kerry Doole, January 29, 2014</ref>

==Early life==
Eaglesmith, one of nine children, was raised by a farming family near [[Guelph]] in rural [[Southern Ontario]].<ref name="Inc.1999">{{cite book|author=CMJ Network, Inc.|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sikEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA47|date=July 1999|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=47–|issn=1074-6978}}</ref> He began playing the guitar at age 12.<ref name="Inc.1997">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7wkEAAAAMBAJ|date=November 1, 1997|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7wkEAAAAMBAJ/page/n9 10]–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

==Career==

As a teenager Eaglesmith hopped a freight train to Western Canada and began writing songs and performing.

Eaglesmith founded a band known as the Smokin' Losers. He later formed a group called as both the Flying Squirrels<ref>{{cite book|title=No Depression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzNLAAAAYAAJ|year=2001|publisher=No Depression|page=121}}</ref> and the Flathead Noodlers, switching the name to represent different styles of music. The Flathead Noodlers play [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], while the Flying Squirrels play more folk and rock. His first self-titled album was released in 1980.<ref>[http://dakotastudent.com/8923/features/fred-eaglesmith-rocks-the-empire/ "Fred Eaglesmith rocks the Empire"]. ''Dakota Student'', October 4, 2016</ref>

Eaglesmith appeared in a 2001 television movie, ''The Gift''.

A typical Fred Eaglesmith show includes his music set between several lengthy between-song comic monologues by Eaglesmith. Topics in the past have included stories about crossing the U.S.–Canada border, Newfoundlanders, and some friends from an [[Indian reserve]]. His fans are known as "Fredheads", a nod to [[deadheads]], who followed the [[The Grateful Dead|Grateful Dead]]. He is known to tour extensively throughout Canada and the U.S.

When Eaglesmith appears in solo performances, he bills himself as Fred J. Eaglesmith. In addition to his own albums, he frequently collaborated with the late [[Willie P. Bennett]], a former member of Eaglesmith's band, who stepped down after a heart attack in early 2007.<ref name="Robertson2016">{{cite book|author=Ray Robertson|title=Lives of the Poets (with Guitars): Thirteen Outsiders Who Changed Modern Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BGEfDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA176|date=March 21, 2016|publisher=Biblioasis|isbn=978-1-77196-073-1|pages=176–}}</ref> Eaglesmith publishes his own records.

In 2010, Eaglesmith was featured on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' as the musical guest. He performed "Careless" from the album ''Cha Cha Cha''.

Starting 2012, performances were billed as the Fred Eaglesmith Travelling Steam Show and include opening songs performed by Bill Poss, [[The Fabulous Ginn Sisters|The Ginn Sisters]], and [[Tif Ginn]].<ref>[http://www.kamsacktimes.com/news/local-news/fred-eaglesmith-performed-in-concert-in-kamsack-1.2400247 "Fred Eaglesmith performed in concert in Kamsack"].

The backing band was disbanded in 2016 and they have been touring together as a duo since.<ref name="kawarthanow.com">https://kawarthanow.com/2019/03/30/fred-eaglesmith-tif-ginn-market-hall/</ref><ref name="chicagotribune.com">https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-fred-eaglesmith-ott-0303-20170228-story.html {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}</ref>
