=== 2010: Formation ===
Composed of [[Justin Hayward-Young]] (known professionally as Justin Young), Arni Arnason (bass), Pete Robertson (drums) and Freddie Cowan (guitar and younger brother of Tom Cowan from [[The Horrors]]), the band was initially formed by Young and Cowan in the summer of 2009.<ref name="Gourlay">{{cite web|title=DIS meets The Vaccines|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4141490-dis-meets-the-vaccines--the-band-don-t-create-media-interest-the-media-do|work=Drowned in Sound|publisher=DrownedinSound.com|access-date=9 March 2013|first=Dom|last=Gourlay|date=11 November 2010|archive-date=11 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111131920/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4141490-dis-meets-the-vaccines--the-band-don-t-create-media-interest-the-media-do|url-status=dead}}</ref> After months of attempting to perfect their sound, the band uploaded the demo "[[If You Wanna]]" to YouTube in August 2010.

In Autumn 2011, the band was forced to postpone tours of [[Japan]] and the US, in addition to shows across [[Europe]], after Young suffered from a recurring vocal issue that had led to three operations within a nine-month period.

The film was produced by PulseFilms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2013/oct/29/the-vaccines-premiere-film-i-dont-even-know-you|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030003859/http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2013/oct/29/the-vaccines-premiere-film-i-dont-even-know-you|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 October 2013|title=The Vaccines short film premiere: I Don't Even Know You – video |date=30 October 2013|access-date=2020-06-03}}</ref>

After taking time off from touring at the end of Summer 2013, members of the band were involved in various different projects, with Cowan travelling to Senegal to play alongside [[Baaba Maal]] and [[The Very Best (band)|the Very Best]] and Young performing in the US with members of [[JEFF The Brotherhood]] and [[Mumford & Sons]].

===2015: ''English Graffiti''===
In August 2014, The Vaccines confirmed that they would complete their third album by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-vaccines/72324 |title=NME News The Vaccines to make third album in the next 'eight or nine' months |work=NME|date=2013-08-28 |access-date=2015-05-30}}</ref> The producer [[Dave Fridmann]], who has worked on records for artists including [[The Flaming Lips|Flaming Lips]], [[MGMT]] and [[Tame Impala]] told NME that The Vaccines want to create a similar sound to [[Sleater-Kinney]]'s [[The Woods (album)|The Woods]],

In November 2014, after a long break The Vaccines played their first few gigs in India, Vietnam and Hong Kong. The band played new songs from their upcoming third album entitled "Handsome", "Want You So Bad" and "Dream Lover". For this tour, the band expanded to a five-piece, with Cathy Lucas of [[Fanfarlo]] and [[Vanishing Twin]] accompanying them on keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/the-vaccines-arni-arnason-picks-his-favourite-new-sounds-from-krautrock-psychsters-fufanu-to-space-p-18181|title= The Vaccines' Arni Arnason Picks His Favourite New Sounds, From Krautrock Psychsters Fufanu To Space-Popper Orlando|work=NME|date=2015-02-06|access-date=2015-04-19}}</ref> The band stated in an interview that they would like to put out a single in January 2015 with touring starting in March and an album coming in May.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUW-a7QuU-c |title=The Vaccines on their first live shows in over a year at Clockenflap Hong Kong (Part One) |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2014-11-28 |access-date=2015-05-30}}</ref>

On 19 January 2015, "Handsome", the first song to be revealed from the new album, was played on [[BBC Radio 1]] by [[Zane Lowe]]. When speaking to Lowe about the track, Young announced the forthcoming album would be titled ''[[English Graffiti]]''.

On 18 May 2015, English Graffiti was made BBC Radio 6's 'Album of the Day +' where previously unheard tracks were premiered throughout the show, with a live performance of "Dream Lover" and "(All Afternoon) In Love."

The Vaccines have claimed ''English Graffiti'' to be "genre defining".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-vaccines/82370 |title=NME News The Vaccines: 'We want our new album to sound terrible in 10 years' |work=NME|date=2015-01-21 |access-date=2015-05-30}}</ref>

In the summer of 2015, the band toured across America with [[Mumford and Sons]], as they had done on their previous album. They repeated this in Australia later in the year.

For the ''English Graffiti'' live shows, The Vaccines recruited a new touring keyboardist, Timothy Lanham. Formerly of Hunting, a band of childhood friends from Australia,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://cargocollective.com/DaisyDigital/Introducing-H-U-N-T-I-N-G|title= Introducing: Hunting|first=Hannah|last=Daisy|publisher=Cargo Collective|date=August 2013|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref> Lanham was a bowling alley employee<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nme.com/nme-big-read-vaccines|title=Fighting Fit|first=Larry|last=Bartleet|work=NME|date=30 March 2018|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref> when he met Cowan and Young at the wedding of [[Alan Pownall]] and [[Gabriella Wilde]] in Tuscany, Italy in September 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://violet-henderson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2014-12-Bands-of-Gold.pdf|title=Bands of Gold|first=Violet|last=Henderson|publisher=British Vogue|date=December 2014|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref> and they eventually invited him to join them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gigwise.com/features/3243755/lost-and-found--the-vaccines-on-recapturing-their-exuberant-spirit-on-combat-sports|title=Lost and Found: The Vaccines on recapturing their exuberant spirit on Combat Sports|publisher=Gigwise|date=13 April 2018|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref>

On 17 June 2016, The Vaccines announced Pete Robertson's amicable departure "to focus on other things", with their recent U.S. tour which had ended a month prior to the announcement being the drummer's last shows with the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/thevaccines/photos/a.152782574739018.30783.152782431405699/1371877672829496/?type=3&source=11 |title=Facebook |website=Facebook.com |access-date=2020-06-03}}</ref> To fulfill their upcoming live commitments, the band recruited Yoann Intonti of [[Spector (band)|Spector]] on drums.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=Spector|author=Spector|number=745017974369714177|date=20 June 2016|title=Yoann's our drummer but will also be playing with The Vaccines this summer (going undercover to steal their beats) x}}</ref>

On 26 and 28 August 2016, The Vaccines played at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]], some of their first British concerts with Intonti playing drums, before headliners [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Biffy Clyro]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/leeds-2016-five-things-we-learned-from-the-vaccines-show|title=NME, Blogs, Leeds 2016: Five Things We Learned From The Vaccines Show |work=NME|date=2016-08-26 |access-date=2016-08-29}}</ref> On the same day as their Reading performance, [[Justin Young (singer, born 1987)|Justin Young]] revealed details of their upcoming fourth studio album to [[DIY (magazine)|DIY]], saying that "we’ve got most of the record written, actually. We’ve got like twenty songs – I don't know how many of them are gonna end up being Vaccines songs. I think we’ll just record in the new year and see what happens!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2016/08/28/the-vaccines-interview-reading-festival-2016-justin-young|title=DIY Mag, News, Reading 2016: The Vaccines' Justin Young talks new beginnings, newer material and returning to the Main Stage at Reading 2016 |publisher=diymag.com |date=2016-08-26 |access-date=2016-08-30}}</ref>

===2018: ''Combat Sports''===
In January 2017, it was reported that The Vaccines' fourth album would contain songs "like polished '70s and '80s rock: [[Big Star]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Guided by Voices]] – that kind of stuff. Very smooth, like a super FM radio sound," stated Young. "Someone to Lose", "Out on the Street", and "Young American" were among the songs considered for the album, with the band looking for "a polished pop producer" to handle the recording sessions that were scheduled to take place in February.

After published photos taken of the remaining members in the wake of Robertson's departure gave the impression that The Vaccines would continue as a three-piece, Cowan stated that Intonti and ''English Graffiti'' touring keyboardist Timothy Lanham had officially joined the band. "After Pete left, we took some photos with just the three of us and it felt weird. And equally we had these guys that were really involved in making the record, so it felt like the right thing to do. You want to embrace the new chapter, not hold on to what was," said Cowan.<ref>''Q'', January 2017</ref>

In April 2017, The Vaccines played in Shanghai, China where they premiered three new songs: "Your Love Is My Favourite Band", "Surfing in the Sky" and "Rolling Stones".

They wrote and performed the theme tune for ''[[Dennis & Gnasher: Unleashed!]]'', which began on the BBC in November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/dennis/facts |title=Top Ten blam-tastic things you need to know about Dennis and his new series - Media Centre |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2017-10-06 |access-date=2020-06-03}}</ref>

In October 2017, the band announced ''[[Combat Sports (album)|Combat Sports]]'' would be the name of their fourth studio album. On 3 January 2018 "I Can't Quit", the first single to be taken from the new album, was released. It was BBC Radio 1's 'Hottest Record in the World'. ''[[Combat Sports (album)|Combat Sports]]'' charted at No. 4 in the UK upon release.

In April 2018 the band embarked on a UK tour to promote the album, culminating with a sold-out show at London's 10,200 capacity venue Alexandra Palace. This was followed by an extensive world tour that took in Europe, Central & North America and Asia. On 29 May 2018, during a summer of festivals, the band again opened for the Rolling Stones' - this time at their concert in Southampton.

In July 2018, the band played two new songs entitled 'All My Friends' and 'Let's Jump Off The Top'. From August they embarked on a European stadium tour with [[Imagine Dragons]]. With Arnason absent for personal reasons, the band were joined throughout the summer by Ru Jarvis of [[The Maccabees (band)|The Maccabees]] on bass.

In November 2018, they released the stand-alone single "[[All My Friends Are Falling in Love]]".

In January 2019, the band embarked on a tour of Australia performing at The Falls Festival. This was followed by more extensive touring in 2019.

In July 2019, it was announced that the band had recorded a duet with [[Kylie Minogue]] to accompany the trailer for the [[Aardman Animations]] Oscar nominated ''[[A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon|Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon]]''.

In late 2019, Young and Lanham unveiled their new band 'Halloweens'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2019/11/08/the-vaccines-justin-young-timothy-lanham-reveal-new-project-halloweens|title=The Vaccines' Justin Young & Timothy Lanham reveal new project, Halloweens|website=Diymag.com|access-date=2020-06-03}}</ref> Their debut album ''Morning Kiss at the Acropolis''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2020/02/28/halloweens-announce-debut-album-morning-kiss-at-the-acropolis|title=Halloweens announce debut album 'Morning Kiss at the Acropolis'|website=Diymag.com|access-date=2020-06-03}}</ref> was released in 2020 and included the singles "My Baby Looks Good With Another", "Hannah, You're Amazing" and "Rock Bottom Rock".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2020/01/15/interview-big-albums-of-2020-halloweens|title=Big Albums of 2020: Halloweens|website=Diymag.com|access-date=2020-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gm9t |title=BBC Radio 2 - Jo Whiley, 23/03/2020 |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2020-03-23 |access-date=2020-06-03}}</ref>

=== 2021: ''Back In Love City'' ===
In April 2020, the band released a new YouTube-only song, "I Never Go Out on Fridays". This was followed by another new song, "Internet Disco Ft. Agent Emotion", which was featured on the NHS fundraiser 'Songs for the National Health Service' alongside unreleased songs by other British acts such as [[Foals (band)|Foals]] and [[Wolf Alice]].

In February 2021, The Vaccines released a covers EP entitled ''Cosy Karaoke Vol. 1''. The EP consisted of cover versions of songs by [[Waxahatchee]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Queens Of The Stone Age]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], [[Wanda Jackson]] and [[The Tornadoes]]. This preceded the release of a limited edition 10 year anniversary version of ''What Did You Expect From The Vaccines?'' on pink vinyl. The band stated that the EP should act as a palette cleanser for what was to come next.

On May 13th 2021, the band released the first single from their, as yet, untitled fifth record called [[Headphones Baby]]. This was followed by singles [[Back in Love City]] and [[Alone Star]]. With touring still restricted by the Global Covid-19 pandemic, the band made just one festival appearance in 2021 as secret guests at [[Latitude Festival]]. 

On September 10th 2021, The Vaccines released their 5th studio album [[Back in Love City]]. Recorded at [[Sonic Ranch]] just outside of El Paso in Texas in December 2019, the album was produced by Daniel Ledinsky with additional production by [[Fryars]].

[[Back in Love City]] charted at No.5 in UK upon release, marking the band's fifth consecutive top 5 album, with ''[[NME]]'' citing a band 'still at their very best and still brimming with ideas and invention.' Following a tour of small venues around the UK for Music Venues Trust, The Vaccines announced an album tour for April 2022.
