'''Bauhaus''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Northampton]], England, in 1978. The group consists of [[Daniel Ash]] (guitar, saxophone), [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] (vocals, occasional instruments), [[Kevin Haskins]] (drums) and [[David J]] (bass). The band was originally named '''Bauhaus 1919''' in reference to the first operating year of the German art school [[Bauhaus]], although they shortened the name within a year of formation. One of the pioneers of [[gothic rock]], Bauhaus were known for their dark image and gloomy sound, although they mixed many genres, including [[dub reggae|dub]], [[glam rock]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], and [[funk]].<ref name="louderthanwar.com">{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/bauhaus-godfathers-of-goth-or-the-ultimate-post-punk-band-an-appreciation|title=Bauhaus: godfathers of Goth or the ultimate post punk band – an appreciation|website=Louderthanwar|access-date=1 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403100635/http://louderthanwar.com/bauhaus-godfathers-of-goth-or-the-ultimate-post-punk-band-an-appreciation/|archive-date=3 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Their 1979 debut single, "[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]" is considered one of the harbingers of gothic rock music and has been influential on contemporary goth culture.<ref name="Park 2008">{{cite book |last=Park |first=Jennifer |editor1-last=Steele |editor1-first=Valerie |editor1-link=Valerie Steele |editor2-last=Park |editor2-first=Jennifer |chapter=Melancholy and the Macabre: Gothic Rock and Fashion |title=Gothic: Dark Glamour |date=2008 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven, Connecticut |page=117 |isbn=978-0-300-13694-4 |lccn=2008024961 |oclc=216936076 |ol=891133W}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[In the Flat Field]]'', is regarded as one of the first gothic rock records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-flat-field-mw0000193854 |title=''In the Flat Field'' – Bauhaus |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=22 February 2013 |last=Raggett |first=Ned}}</ref> Their 1981 second album ''[[Mask (Bauhaus album)|Mask]]'' expanded their style by incorporating various instruments such as keyboards, saxophone and acoustic guitar along with funk rhythms based tracks like "[[Kick in the Eye]]".{{sfn|Shirley|1994|pp=63–64}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mask-mw0000651605 |title=''Mask'' – Bauhaus |last=Raggett |first=Ned |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=25 February 2013}}</ref> In 1982, Bauhaus achieved mainstream success in the [[United Kingdom]] with their third album, [[The Sky's Gone Out]] along with a cover of [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]" which peaked No. 4 and No. 15 respectively on the British charts and earned an appearance on [[Top of the Pops]]. They continued to maintain their success with one more hit single "[[She's in Parties]]" (from the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Burning from the Inside]]'') before breaking up in 1983. 

After Bauhaus' breakup in 1983, Murphy formed [[Dalis Car]] with [[Japan (band)|Japan]]'s bassist [[Mick Karn]] before beginning a solo career later on, while Ash and Haskins continued as [[Tones on Tail]] and, later, reunited with David J to form [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]]. Both enjoyed greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus had, but disappeared from the charts in their homeland. Bauhaus eventually reunited for a 1998 tour, again from 2005 to 2008, and once again in 2019.

==History==
[[File:Bauhaus-Signet.svg|thumb|right|The emblem of the German [[art school]] [[Bauhaus]], designed by [[Oskar Schlemmer]] in 1922: it was reused by the members of Bauhaus in the 1980s for promoting their music via posters and record sleeves]]
Daniel Ash, his friend David J. Haskins, and Haskins' younger brother Kevin, had played together in various bands since childhood. One of the longer-lived of these was a band called the Craze, which performed a few times around Northampton in 1978. However, The Craze still split up fairly quickly, and Ash once again tried to convince his old school friend Murphy to join him, simply because Ash thought he had the right look for a band.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=18}} Murphy, who was working in a printing factory, decided to give it a try, despite never having written any lyrics or music. During their first rehearsal, he co-wrote the song "In the Flat Field".{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=52}}

Ash's old bandmate Kevin Haskins joined as the drummer. Ash made a point of not inviting David J, the driving force in their previous bands, because he wanted a band he could control.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=19}} Instead, Chris Barber was brought in to play bass, and together the four musicians formed the band S.R. However, within a few weeks Ash relented, and replaced Barber with David J, who suggested the new name Bauhaus 1919. David J. had already agreed to tour American airbases with another band, but decided that joining his friends' group was "the right thing to do". With their lineup complete, the band played their first gig at the Cromwell pub in [[Wellingborough]] on New Year's Eve 1978.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=20}}

The band had chosen the name Bauhaus 1919, a reference to the German [[Bauhaus]] art movement of the 1920s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bauhaus/biography|title=Bauhaus Biography|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093010/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bauhaus/biography|archive-date=13 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> because of its "stylistic implications and associations", according to David J.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=21}} The band also chose the same [[typeface]] used on the Bauhaus college building in [[Dessau]], Germany, as well as the Bauhaus emblem, designed by [[Oskar Schlemmer]]. Bauhaus associate Graham Bentley said that the group was unlike any Northampton band of the time, most of which played predominantly [[cover songs]].{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=22}} Bentley videotaped a performance by the group, which was sent to several record labels, in the hope of obtaining a contract. This approach was hindered partly because many record companies at the time did not have home video equipment, so the group decided to record a demo.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|pp=23–24}}

==="Bela Lugosi's Dead" and 4AD===
After only six weeks as a band, Bauhaus entered the studio for the first time at Beck Studios in Wellingborough to record a demo.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|pp=25–26}} One of the five tracks recorded during the session, "[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]", more than nine minutes long, was released as the group's debut single in August 1979 on [[Small Wonder Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/14/bauhaus-invent-goth|title=Bauhaus invent goth|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=13 June 2011|website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228071259/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/14/bauhaus-invent-goth|archive-date=28 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The band was listed simply as Bauhaus, with the "1919" abandoned.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=59}}

The single received a positive review in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', and stayed on the [[UK Independent Singles and Albums Charts|British independent charts]] for two years. The song received crucial airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]] and DJ [[John Peel]]'s evening show, and Bauhaus were subsequently asked to record a session for Peel's show, which was broadcast on 3 January 1980.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=30}} Of the additional tracks, [[Classic Rock Magazine]] wrote that, "The rest of the material finds a band fumbling for direction, even touching on [[ska]]."<ref>{{cite journal |date= December 2018 |title=The Bela Session |journal=[[Classic Rock Magazine]] |page=93}}</ref>

One of Bauhaus' first US shows was in a venue called Space Place in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on September 1980, booked by Jim Nash and Dannie Flesher, the owners of the independent record label [[Wax Trax! Records]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Kelsey Chapstick |title=Ministry to NIN: 10 Things We Learned From Wax Trax!

Signing with the [[4AD]] label, the band released two more singles, "[[Dark Entries]]" in January 1980 and "[[Terror Couple Kill Colonel]]" in June 1980, before issuing their first album ''[[In the Flat Field]]'' in October 1980. ''[[NME]]''  described it as "Gothick-Romantick pseudo-decadence".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gill |first=Andy |date=8 November 1980 |title=Gothick As a Brick |journal=[[NME]] |page=32}}</ref> Despite negative reviews, ''In the Flat Field'' topped the indie charts, and made headway on the [[UK Albums Chart]], peaking for one week at No. 72.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=46}} In December 1980 Bauhaus released a cover of "[[Telegram Sam]]", a hit by [[glam rock]] pioneers [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], as a single.

===Beggars Banquet and breakup===
Bauhaus' growing success outstripped 4AD's resources, so the band moved to 4AD's parent label, [[Beggars Banquet Records]].{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=56}} Bauhaus released "[[Kick in the Eye]]" in March 1981 as its debut release on the label. The single reached No. 59 on the charts.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=57}} The following single, "[[The Passion of Lovers]]", peaked at No. 56 in July 1981.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=60}} Bauhaus released their second album, ''[[Mask (Bauhaus album)|Mask]]'', in October 1981. The band employed more keyboards, and a variety of other instruments, to add to the diversity of the record. In an unconventional move, the group shot a video for the album's title track as a promotional tool for the band as a whole, rather than any specific song from the record.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|pp=63–64}}

In July 1982 Bauhaus released the single "[[Spirit (Bauhaus song)|Spirit]]", produced by [[Hugh Jones (producer)|Hugh Jones]]. It was intended to break into the Top 30, but only reached No. 42. The band was displeased with the single, and re-recorded it later in 1982 for their third album ''[[The Sky's Gone Out]]''.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=115}} In the same year, Bauhaus scored their biggest hit with a cover of [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]", which was recorded during a BBC session. The song reached No. 15 on the British charts, and earned the band an appearance on the television show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. {{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=78}} Due to the success of the single, the album also became the band's biggest hit, peaking at No. 4.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=79}} That same year, Bauhaus made an appearance in the horror film ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', where they performed "Bela Lugosi's Dead" during the opening credits. The final cut of the scene focused on Murphy; this, coupled with the singer's modelling work in a popular ad campaign for [[Maxell]], caused resentment among the rest of the group.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|pp=91–93}}

Prior to the recording of their fourth album, ''[[Burning from the Inside]]'' (1983), Murphy was stricken with pneumonia, which prevented him from contributing much to the album. Ash and David J took the reins, becoming the driving forces behind the record and even performing lead vocals on several tracks.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|pp=96–97}} The album's lead single, "[[She's in Parties]]", reached No. 26 on the charts and earned Bauhaus their third and final ''Top of the Pops'' appearance.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=99}} Bauhaus then embarked on an international promotional tour for the album, with dates in Europe and the Far East.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=137}} David J recalled that the night before they were supposed to perform two shows at [[Hammersmith Palais]] in London, the group decided to disband.

The band played their farewell show on 5 July 1983 at the Hammersmith Palais; dedicated fans had been warned by the band's crew not to miss the show, without telling them it was the last. After a long [[encore (concert)|encore]], consisting of some of their early songs, David J left the stage with the words "rest in peace".{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=137}} ''Burning from the Inside'' was released a week later. The album received largely positive reviews and reached No. 13 on the charts.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=100}} Bauhaus released the single "Sanity Assassin" in limited quantities as a farewell gift for those who joined the group's fan club.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|p=102}}

=== Subsequent developments: reunions and a final album ===
Bauhaus reunited for the "Resurrection Tour" in 1998, their stage show opened with ''Double Dare'' and Pete Murphy singing to the audience via a TV screen set up centre-stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://link2wales.co.uk/1998/gigreviews/bauhaus-manchester-academy/|title=Bauhaus @ Manchester Academy |website=Link2wales.co.uk|access-date=17 June 2021}}</ref> The tour featured a new song, "The Dog's a Vapour", which was also included in the ''[[Heavy Metal 2000]]'' film soundtrack. A [[live album]] was recorded during the tour, ''[[Gotham (album)|Gotham]]'', which was released the following year. It included a studio recording of Bauhaus' cover of the [[Dead Can Dance]] song "Severance".<ref>{{cite web |title=Bauhaus Gotham |first=Matt |last=Mernagh |date=30 November 1999 |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/bauhaus-gotham |publisher=exclaim.ca |access-date=15 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302122606/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/bauhaus-gotham |archive-date=2 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Daniel Ash in London February 3 2006.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Daniel Ash in 2006]]
Bauhaus reunited again in 2005, playing that year's [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]] in [[Indio, California]]. They opened their set with Murphy being lowered upside-down to the stage, singing "Bela Lugosi's Dead". Following Murphy's 2005 tour, Bauhaus embarked on a full tour beginning in [[North America]] in autumn 2005, ending in [[Europe]] in February 2006. During the tour, Bauhaus covered [[Joy Division]]'s "[[Transmission (song)|Transmission]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSIKgvfkrfQ |title=Bauhaus – Transmission (Live in Berlin – Feb 06) |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=6 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606212358/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSIKgvfkrfQ |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The band also mentioned that they hoped to record new music. In May they performed as opening act for [[Nine Inch Nails]] on the summer leg of the latter's US tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526071/nine-inch-nails-tap-bauhaus-summer-tour.jhtml |title=Monsters of Goth: Nine Inch Nails, Bauhaus Uniting for Summer Tour |website=[[MTV]] |date=14 March 2006 |access-date=9 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213074938/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526071/nine-inch-nails-tap-bauhaus-summer-tour.jhtml |archive-date=13 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2008, Bauhaus released their first new studio album since 1983, ''[[Go Away White]]'' ([[Cooking Vinyl]]). It marked the band's end and the album had no promotional tour. In late 2007, Kevin Haskins said "We were getting along really well, but there was an incident that occurred," and added that as a result, "Some of us just felt that we didn't want to carry on as a working unit."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://billboard.com/articles/news/1047141/bauhaus-bowing-out-with-new-album |title=Bauhaus Bowing Out with New Album |last=Cohen |first=Jonathan |date=4 December 2007 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=7 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207013720/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047141/bauhaus-bowing-out-with-new-album |archive-date=7 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he "was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable", but in the end, "that rocky character worked and I think it was a bit right to finish it, really".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://Postwave.Gr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=794 |title=Peter Murphy (Bauhaus) Interview |date=25 February 2008 |language=el |last=Giannakopoulos |first=V. |website=Postwave.gr |access-date=7 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207150506/http://www.postwave.gr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=794 |archive-date=7 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The same year, David J commented on the breakup: "You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble. Pour in another chemical, and it starts to bubble a bit more. You pour in a fourth chemical, and it bubbles really violently, and then explodes. That's my answer".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://SuicideGirls.com/interviews/David+J+of+Bauhaus |title=Interviews > David J of Bauhaus |date=14 March 2008 |last=Hathaway |first=Jay |website=[[SuicideGirls]] |access-date=7 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505115219/http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/David+J+of+Bauhaus/ |archive-date=5 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In September 2019, after a 13-year hiatus, Bauhaus announced a show at the 5-000 seat [[Hollywood Palladium]] with all original members on 3 November. A second show was added for the following night, after the first show sold out quickly. A third date at the same venue was then confirmed for 1 December.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Kaye|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/09/original-lineup-bauhaus-reunite-concert/|title=Original Bauhaus lineup to reunite for first time in 13 years|publisher=Consequenceofsound.net|date=19 September 2019|access-date=26 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190926004239/https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/09/original-lineup-bauhaus-reunite-concert/|archive-date=26 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Post-Bauhaus careers ===
[[File:Peter Murphy London February 3 2006 looking up.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vocalist [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]]]]
After Bauhaus disbanded, the members of the band moved on to various solo work. Murphy worked briefly with bassist [[Mick Karn]] of [[Japan (band)|Japan]] in the band [[Dalis Car]], before going solo with such albums as 1986's ''[[Should the World Fail to Fall Apart]]'', 1988's ''[[Love Hysteria]]'' and 1989's ''[[Deep (Peter Murphy album)|Deep]]''. Ash had already started Tones on Tail with Bauhaus roadie Glen Campling as a side project in 1982; after Bauhaus broke up, Kevin Haskins joined the group, and the trio released an album and several EPs before breaking up after a 1984 American tour.<ref name="RS">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bauhaus/biography |title=Bauhaus |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=24 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810165028/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bauhaus/biography |archive-date=10 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During this time, David J released two solo albums and collaborated with other musicians, recording two albums with [[the Jazz Butcher]], and also with comics writer/spoken-word artist [[Alan Moore]] in the short-lived band the Sinister Ducks.{{fact|date=January 2021}}

During a discussion about the state of their projects at the time, Ash and David J began talking about reforming Bauhaus. All four band members arranged a rehearsal, but Murphy failed to show up on the scheduled day. The other three band members rehearsed regardless, and were inspired by the chemistry they had as a trio. As a result, Ash and the Haskins brothers formed [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]] in 1985.{{sfn|Shirley|1994|pp=113–14}} Love and Rockets scored a US hit four years later with "[[So Alive (Love and Rockets song)|So Alive]]". The band broke up in 1999 after seven albums. Both Ash and David J released solo albums during the Love and Rockets years; Murphy contributed backing vocals to David J's 1992 single "Candy on the Cross".{{fact|date=January 2021}}

In 2017, Ash and Kevin Haskins toured as [[Poptone]] with Haskins' daughter Diva Dompe on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.riffmagazine.com/qa/poptone-new-tale-to-tell/|title=Q&A: Poptone has a new tale to tell {{!}} RIFF Magazine|website=Riffmagazine.com|access-date=11 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112042352/http://www.riffmagazine.com/qa/poptone-new-tale-to-tell/|archive-date=12 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The group performed songs from Bauhaus, Tones on Tail, and Love and Rockets along with cover songs.

In 2018, Murphy and David J announced a tour of New Zealand, Australia and Europe to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Bauhaus, with the pair performing ''In the Flat Field'' in its entirety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/bauhaus-40-anniversary-tour-uk2361768-2361768#axiVogdgMPjSEl4P.99|title=Members of goth-rock outfit Bauhaus announce UK tour to celebrate band's 40th anniversary|website=Nme.com|access-date=4 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805083050/https://www.nme.com/news/music/bauhaus-40-anniversary-tour-uk2361768-2361768#axiVogdgMPjSEl4P.99|archive-date=5 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Musical style and influences ==
{{quote box
| quote = "Our influences were many. The obvious ones were glam rock and punk rock, but when we were recording, when we finished each day, we'd usually record in a residential studio so we would all stay together at night time. So when we'd wind down, we'd always play either dub reggae or late Beatles, like Sgt. Pepper. When I mention that to people they're kind of surprised.

Several months before The Sex Pistols gig I went to see Led Zeppelin at a Earls Court, a huge venue in London. They were in their prime, and it was a marvellous rock show. John Bonham played a blistering half hour drum solo. I left the show with a mixture of elation and depression. I knew that I could never be as technically good as Bonham, and a feeling of dejection enveloped me! Fast forward to the 100 Club. I had just left high school, dressed in flared denims and long hair, and immediately felt very out of place amongst the punks who consisted of Siouxsie, Sue Catwoman and Sid Vicious. The Clash took to the stage and it was like being hit by an express train! Their style and sound blew me away, and I instantly thought, "I can do this!" – such a cliche. The Pistols followed and I was converted. The next day I went to the barbers and had my long locks cut short and took my pyjamas in to the garage and splattered them with emulsion paint, Jackson Pollock style.

Peter and myself grew up in the same school, we knew each other from about twelve years old and were really crazy about those bands I just mentioned. Particularly Bowie and Roxy Music as well. That whole glam thing from the early 70s. There's a film called Velvet Goldmine which you’ve probably heard of. That pretty much summed up our youth at that school. I though that was pretty accurate, that film.  Before that, when I was really young, I used to see stuff about The Beatles and The Dave Clark Five. That was another one. I was fascinated by the drum sound that that guy would get in the Dave Clark Five because there was all this echo. A massive drum sound. Apparently my mum told me my face used to be about four inches away from the TV screen with the volume up full, listening to the Dave Clark Five's “Bits and Pieces.” So I suppose that was the first thing that really got me interested in music from about eight or so.}}</ref><ref name="Mister Moonlight">{{cite book |author1=David J.

When it comes to music, Palahniuk has said that 'the punk esthetic shaped my work: Start loud, run short, end abruptly.' 93 Punk, industrial rock, and other edgy, confrontational styles tend to be the major influences.... ....To get into the right mood to create his damaged and sometimes dangerous characters, Palahniuk will often listen to the same song on repeat while he is writing.
