==Personal life, views and other work==
Larsson has grown increasingly vocal with her views on other artists and industry workers with whom she works and admires. While she has high praise for performers such as Beyoncé,<ref name="harpers">{{cite web |title=Zara Larsson Sings Beyonce |url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/videos/a19084/zara-larsson-sings-beyonce/ |publisher=[[Harpers Bazaar]] |first=Erica |last=Gonzalez |date=29 November 2016 |quote=I listen to a lot of Beyoncé and a lot of male artists |access-date=4 December 2016}}</ref> she is equal in her opposing views of such artists as [[Dr. Luke]]<ref name=nme>{{cite web |title=Zara Larsson – The Full NME Cover Interview |url=https://www.nme.com/features/ive-always-just-wanted-people-to-look-at-me-brace-yourself-its-zara-larsson-757398 |work=NME |first=Emily |last=Mackay |date=21 September 2016 |access-date=4 December 2016}}</ref> and [[Chris Brown]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a808368/zara-larsson-chris-brown-feud-stinky-butt/ |title=Zara Larsson takes her feud with Chris Brown to the next level and his response was, erm, interesting |date=19 September 2016 |work=Digital Spy |access-date=21 June 2017}}</ref>

In January 2015, Larsson gained a lot of positive attention in Sweden and the United States after posting a picture on her [[Instagram]] showing a condom wrapped around her leg and foot to refute the idea that penises can be too big for condoms to fit around.<ref name="Condom news">{{Cite news |url=https://www.metro.se/artikel/nu-pratar-hela-usa-om-zara-larssons-kondom-p%C3%A5-benet-xr |title=Nu pratar hela USA om Zara Larssons kondom på benet |language=sv |date=9 January 2015 |work=[[Metro (Swedish newspaper)|Metro]] |access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref> She is currently{{when?|date=April 2021}} fronting a new campaign from [[Durex]] and [[AIDS]] organization (RED) promoting sexual health awareness and raising money for AIDS treatment in South Africa.<ref>{{Citation|title=Zara Larsson's sex education classes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdMQ_SUgi80&list=PLnwt1fUa-EVimsGngs_n1yO5qPaseAPxq&index=63|language=en|access-date=3 December 2019}}</ref>

In June 2015, she came into the spotlight in her home country for openly questioning whether the [[Bråvalla Festival]] had any gender perspective whatsoever, as its promotion and performance line-up were highly dominated by male artists. She also wondered why she wasn't presented among the main acts despite being the most popular artist on [[Spotify]] of the festival's acts.<ref name= "Bråvalla 1">{{cite news |url=https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/zara-larsson-gunther-och-bravalla-detta-har-hant/ |title="Zara Larsson, Günther och Bråvalla – Detta har hänt" |newspaper=Dagens Nyheter |language=sv |date=3 July 2015 |access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref> That same day, Swedish singer [[Günther (singer)|Günther]] wrote on his [[Facebook]] profile criticizing Larsson: "You are one of many [[teenybopper]] chicks who are world-famous in Sweden and maximally hyped but don't come with any hits, only a lot of fuss."<ref name="Bråvalla 1" /> During her performance at the festival she countered back saying: "Fuck Günther, fuck all woman haters".<ref name="Bråvalla 1" /> This led to the hashtag #backazara being created and popularised on social media platforms, where thousands of people, including famous Swedish people, showed their support for Larsson.<ref name="Bråvalla 1" />

In order to increase public understanding of incontinence, she has openly stated that she used a diaper for seven years.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://nyheter24.se/noje/797164-zara-larsson-jag-blev-full-forsta-gangen-nar-jag-var-13-ar |title=Zara Larsson svara ärligt på frågor om alkohol, feminism och när hon kissat på sig. |language=sv |date=7 May 2015 |work=[[Metro (Swedish newspaper)|Metro]] |access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref>

In 2015, Larsson got to plan and host a summer speech to be broadcast on [[Sveriges Radio]], as one of 58 celebrities that year.

In October 2019, Larsson spoke out against [[Demi Lovato]]'s stance on the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] on social media. Lovato commented on an Instagram post that they do not "have an opinion" and will not "choose a side" in relation to the issue. Larsson subtweeted saying that if you "don't care", you are "a part of the oppressive side". She later on added that it was not a post directed only to Lovato, but rather to "all the people who think their option to be disengaged in politics is anything but privilege".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.popbuzz.com/music/artists/demi-lovato/news/israel-palestine-apology-zara-larsson/ | title=Zara Larsson calls out Demi Lovato for not "choosing sides" in her Israel apology | work=PopBuzz | date=6 July 2020}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
===Radical feminism===
Larsson, a fan of [[Beyoncé]], identifies as a [[Feminism|feminist]] and models herself an "activist" after the singer.<ref name="harpers"/> She attributes her openness of opinion on social media and in interviews to her parents, claiming: "Both my parents are very educated when it comes to social issues and being [[woke]] about what's going on in the world, and they've been very supportive of me having a voice".<ref name=harpers/> Larsson says she "has received a lot of hate" for her feminist opinions, including being called a "[[misandry|man hater]]". She accepts the label and has added that she "doesn't care", because "it doesn't really hurt men if I hate them".<ref name=interview>{{cite web |url=http://www.fuse.tv/videos/2016/06/zara-larsson-feminism-fuse-first-interview |title=Zara Larsson Interview on Feminism: 'It Doesn't Hurt Men If I Hate Them' |last=Lipshutz |first=Jason |date=3 June 2016 |website=fuse.tv |access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref>
