He is best known for his breakthrough mixtapes ''Black Heart Revenge'', ''When Hell Falls'', ''Ethernet'' and ''Boy Who Cried Wolf''. He is signed to [[Todd Moscowitz|Alamo Records]] and [[Empire Distribution|Empire Records]] and was previously signed to [[Interscope Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/03/wifisfuneral-signs-interscopealamo-records/ |title=Wifisfuneral Signs to Interscope and Alamo Records – XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref> In early 2020, Wifisfuneral announced his retirement; however, this proved to be short-lived as he released his debut album, ''Pain?'', in that year.

== Early life ==
Isaiah Rivera was born in [[the Bronx]], New York City, to a [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] mother and a Jamaican father.<ref>{{Citation|last=Michael McCrudden|title=WIFISFUNERAL {{!}} Before They Were Famous {{!}} SoundCloud Rapper Bio|date=July 10, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf26m5oeAZs|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> Rivera was raised by his mother. His biological father, who was a freestyle battle rapper in The Bronx, left the family when Rivera was only 3 years old. When he turned 7, the family moved to [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. His mother and stepfather later broke up when Rivera was 12.

Rivera was originally known as '''Izzy Kill$''', but later chose to go under the name '''Wifisfuneral''', which he got from his close friend DJ Scheme. Rivera's interest in hip-hop began when he first watched [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]. tribute "[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]" music video with [[Puff Daddy]] and [[Ma$e]].<ref>{{Cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUhRKVIjJtw|title=The Notorious B.I.G. - "Mo Money Mo Problems"}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== ''Black Heart Revenge'', ''When Hell Falls'', & ''Boy Who Cried Wolf'' (2016–2017) ===
After dropping out of high school and being kicked out of his house during his sophomore year, Rivera began working on his dream of success in the hip hop industry. While recording music during this time, he battled with substance abuse problems, including [[Cocaine]], [[Xanax]] and [[Adderall]]. While working on ''Black Heart Revenge'', Rivera unintentionally overdosed on cocaine and adderall. After recovering, he resumed his work on the album while getting his addiction under control.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thehundreds.com/blogs/content/all-gas-no-breaks-wifisfuneral-interview|title=All Gas, No Breaks :: Catching Up with Palm Beach Rapper wifisfuneral|work=The Hundreds|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref>

Rivera released ''When Hell Falls'' on January 27, 2017. It was originally his suicide note, but he decided to turn it into an album instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lyricallemonade.com/wifisfuneral-qa/|title=Wifisfuneral Q&A – Lyrical LemonadeLyrical Lemonade|website=lyricallemonade.com|language=en-US|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref> The project took a total of two weeks to complete, and upon release, attracted the attention of [[Todd Moscowitz|Alamo Records]] and [[Interscope Records]], who he later signed with. His next mixtape, ''Boy Who Cried Wolf'', named after the popular fable by [[Aesop]], was released later in the year to positive reception.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/08/wifisfuneral-boy-who-cried-wolf-mixtape-interview/|title=Wifisfuneral Looks to Put His Stamp on the Game: 'I'm the Voice for the Voiceless' – XXL|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref>
He was also a member of [[Members Only (hip hop collective)|Members Only]], a group originally created by [[XXXTentacion]] and [[Ski Mask the Slump God]], from 2015 to 2017.

=== ''Ethernet'', ''Conn3ct3d'' and ''Pain?'' (2018{{endash}}present) ===
Ethernet was first slated for a May 2018 release date, but was later pushed back due to sample and feature clearance issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/06/wifisfuneral-ethernet-vol-1-mixtape/|title=Wifisfuneral Delivers 'Ethernet Vol. 1′ Mixtape Featuring Jay Critch, YBN Nahmir, and More|website=XXL Mag}}</ref> The album was officially released on June 8, 2018, delivering the recognizable song "Juveniles".

On June 12, 2018, Rivera was chosen as a member of the [[XXL (magazine)|XXL Freshman Class]] of 2018, along with other emerging rappers, such as Ski Mask the Slump God, [[Lil Pump]], and [[JID]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/06/2018-xxl-freshman-cover/|title=2018 XXL Freshman Class: We Got Clout}}</ref>

On January 11, 2019, Rivera released ''Conn3ct3d'', a joint project with frequent collaborator [[Robb Banks]]. ''Conn3ct3d'' was led by two official singles. "Movin Slow" was released on April 19, 2018, and "Can't Feel My Face" was released on January 9, 2019. Two songs on the album were prematurely leaked before release. "EA" was leaked on April 8, 2018, and "Neglect" was leaked on October 15, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/albums/Wifisfuneral-and-robb-bank/Conn3ct3d|title=CONN3CT3D}}</ref> The first song off the album to get a video release was the official single "Can't Feel My Face", which had debuted on February 5, 2019.

Despite previously announcing his intention to retire from music, Wifisfuneral released his debut studio album, ''Pain?'', on August 28, 2020. On the concept of the album, which documents his trials and tribulations, he stated: "I've been working on the album for a couple of years now. It's been a really big process going from the underground circuit to making records. I didn't want to make it a regular rap album, I wanted every song to capture the emotion for anyone who's listening.<ref name="Pain">{{cite web|url=https://www.inkedmag.com/.amp/original-news/wifisfuneral|title=Wifisfuneral Releases His Debut Album, 'Pain?'|work=[[Inked (magazine)|Inked]]|date=August 27, 2020|access-date=August 28, 2020|author=Preston, Devon}}</ref>
