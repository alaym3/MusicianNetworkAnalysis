'''Evans Blue''' is a Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Toronto]], founded in 2005. They have sold over one million albums worldwide,{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} including five studio albums and one live album.

== History ==

=== Origins (2005) ===
Evans Blue came together in early 2005. Five musicians, then in three separate bands, met through a local musician's message board. Lead singer [[Kevin Matisyn]] suggested the name, which refers to the dye that is injected into the bloodstream to measure blood volume. The band then caught the attention of producer Trevor Kustiak ([[Cool for August]]) and his partner Mari Dew, of The Pocket Studios. The original lead guitarist, Kevin Smith, left due to personal reasons before the group secured a record label.

They recorded three demo songs: "Black Hole",<ref>{{cite web |title=CA Blackhole - Evans Blue |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlhgX9-jsPo |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> "Saturnalia"<ref>{{cite web |title=Saturnalia - Evans Blue |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dt8iE2kcmk |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> and "Starlight",<ref>{{cite web |title=Starlight - Evans Blue |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzDT6B3L29g |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> all of which would appear on their first album.

=== ''The Melody and the Energetic Nature of Volume'' (2005–2007) ===
Evans Blue completed work on their debut album, ''[[The Melody and the Energetic Nature of Volume]]'', in November 2005.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Apar |first1=Corey |title=The Melody and the Energetic Nature of Volume Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-melody-and-the-energetic-nature-of-volume-mw0000486841 |website=allmusic.com |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> Their first single, "[[Cold (But I'm Still Here)]]" hit airwaves in December and was accompanied by a video.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cold (But I'm Still Here) from Evan{{!}}Blue |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oatd5Hrh3Pg |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> The album was released February 21, 2006 through The Pocket Recordings/[[Hollywood Records]]. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard [[Top Heatseekers]] chart, spent several weeks in the top 10 list and spawned a second single, "[[Over (Evans Blue song)|Over]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=Chart History Evans Blue |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/evans-blue/chart-history/TLN |website=billboard.com |publisher=Billboard |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref>

In March 2006, Evans Blue embarked upon their first U.S. tour alongside [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Evans Blue Hit the Road with Taproot |url=https://www.thegauntlet.com/article/254/3100/Evans-Blue-Hit-the-Road-with-Taproot.html |website=thegauntlet.com |publisher=The Gauntlet |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> They also played festivals, and several concerts with [[Breaking Benjamin]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Evans Blue Concert History |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/evans-blue?page=2#concert-table |website=concertarchives.org |publisher=Concert Archives |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> They have since played with bands such as [[Staind]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[10 Years (band)|10 Years]], [[Three Days Grace]], [[Flyleaf (band)|Flyleaf]] and former labelmates [[Breaking Benjamin]].

On April 1, 2006, drummer Darryl Brown left due to differences with bandmates' lifestyles. That night in Boston, drummer Danny D (formerly of the band Dogfight) was temporarily brought in.  The band played acoustic sets until he was up to speed, and he continued through the rest of the tour, which lasted until late October.

===''The Pursuit Begins When This Portrayal of Life Ends'' (2007–2009)===
After an eight-month stint touring around the United States, Evans Blue returned home and began work upon their second album, ''[[The Pursuit Begins When This Portrayal of Life Ends]]''. Danny D left the band and was replaced by Howard Davis.

Evans Blue was nominated for New Group of the Year at the [[Juno Awards of 2007]].

The first single from ''The Pursuit'' hit airwaves May 21, 2007 and was accompanied by a music video, directed by [[Jesse Ewles]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Evans Blue - The Pursuit |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azkGI6OFZJc |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> ''The Pursuit Begins When This Portrayal of Life Ends'' was released on July 24, 2007. 

In March 2007, Evans Blue recorded acoustic versions of each song from ''The Melody and the Energetic Nature of Volume''. For a limited time, this collection was included with each purchase of ''The Pursuit'' from [[Best Buy]], and contained commentary from Matisyn, as well as a making-of documentary for the second album. The FYE version of the album did not include the ''Unplugged Melody,'' but instead had two additional tracks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Evans Blue – The Pursuit Begins When This Portrayal Of Life Ends |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/8930310-Evans-Blue-The-Pursuit-Begins-When-This-Portrayal-Of-Life-Ends |website=discogs.com |publisher=Discogs |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref>

On July 10, 2007 in Toronto, Evans Blue kicked off their first headlining tour, Curbside Confession of a Catastrophe. The tour stopped across the western United States, with occasional performances in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. They were accompanied by [[Framing Hanley]], [[Fair to Midland]], and [[Submersed]] throughout September, then were joined by [[Saving Abel]] and Canadian rockers [[Neurosonic]]. This tour ended on December 31 in Houston, Texas, where they introduced a new song, "Good Enough",<ref>{{cite web |title=Good Enough Evans Blue |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMMsULwB-9c |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> a song which was later scrapped.

At this point, Kevin Matisyn was voted out of the band. Parker Lauzon stated: "We did not choose anyone over him; he was simply voted out, not only because of musical differences but business differences as well. He was not making good decisions for this band anymore, and we as a group have decided to move on." (In 2009, Matisyn founded the band [[Parabelle]].)

=== ''Evans Blue'' (2009–2010) ===
[[Dan Chandler]] was announced as the new singer for Evans Blue in February 2009, and the band went into the studio with producer Trevor Kustiak to record their third album.  The self-titled album was released through Sounds+Sights, exclusively via iTunes, on June 23, 2009.

The first song from the new album "Sick of It" was released on iTunes on March 31st.  The song went to No.&nbsp;1 in the research at SiriusXM Octane and was No.&nbsp;2 on the 2009 year-end Octane chart,<ref>{{cite web |title=Evans Blue Announce New Album |url=https://www.antimusic.com/news/10/may/05Evans_Blue_Announce_New_Album.shtml |website=antimusic.com |publisher=AntiMusic |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref>.  Based on this success, SiriusXM Octane added a second track, "Bulletproof," in October 2009.

In May 2010 Evans Blue and Sounds+Sights teamed up with indie label F.O.F. Entertainment/[[EMI]] for a physical release of their 2009 Evans Blue record in stores throughout the US and Canada.  The album was released on July 27, 2010, and included the bonus track "[[Erase My Scars]]," which was chosen as the new single.<ref>{{cite web |title=Evans Blue – Evans Blue |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/6750456-Evans-Blue-Evans-Blue |website=discogs.com |publisher=Discogs |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref>

"Erase My Scars" hit the US airwaves in May 2010, and the band hit the road in early July 2010 for the first leg of their Erase My Scars 2010 Tour with Kansas City band [[Red Line Chemistry]], covering 10,000 miles in 6 weeks.<ref>{{cite web |title=EVANS BLUE Announce Headlining Tour...June 2010 |url=https://bravewords.com/news/evans-blue-announce-headlining-tour-with-red-line-chemistry-lansdowne |website=bravewords.com |publisher=BraveWords |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref>  Evans Blue stopped in LA mid-tour to shoot the video for "Erase My Scars"<ref>{{cite web |title=EVANS BLUE Erase My Scars |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09y8THtoqJc |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> with Director [[Adrian Picardi]] and Producer [[Eric Ro]] of Northern Five Entertainment. (The video is dedicated to Dan Chandler's nephew Chase Franklin, who died of a rare brain cancer at age 8.) In November, the band went on the second leg of the tour, this time with Oklahoma natives Taddy Porter and EB's Sounds+Sights label mates [[Rains (band)|Rains]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Evans Blue Announce Tour With Taddy Porter, Oct 2010 |url=https://travisfaulk.com/evans-blue-announce-tour-taddy-porter |website=travisfaulk.com |publisher=Travis Faulk |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref>

=== ''Graveyard of Empires'' (2011–2012) ===
On the Erase My Scars tour, Evans Blue debuted songs from their next album ''[[Graveyard of Empires (album)|Graveyard of Empires]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Evans Blue – Graveyard Of Empires |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/556954-Evans-Blue-Graveyard-Of-Empires |website=discogs.com |publisher=Discogs |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Songs played by year: 2011 |url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/evans-blue-1bd6b92c.html?year=2011 |website=setlist.fm |publisher=SetList.fm |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> The band began recording the album in September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=Courtesy Photo |url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/flint/index.ssf/2011/05/evans_blue_thrilled_about_new.html |title=Rockers Evans Blue thrilled about new project |date=May 16, 2011 |publisher=MLive.com |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> On September 28, 2012, "This Time It's Different" made its worldwide debut on [[Sirius Radio]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=EvansBlueMusic|author=Evans|Blue|number=119181905475272705|date=September 28, 2011|title=What's up E|B Twitter Nation?

On November 8, 2011, Evans Blue announced, via Facebook, that drummer Howard "H-Bomb" Davis had left the band, posting "Musically, we were moving in different directions, so this is the best for everyone, and we wish him all the best." The departure was clearly amicable, with Davis posting "This change is for the best...There is no beef with any of the members of EB."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Riddle |first1=Tree |title=Evans Blue Part Ways With Drummer Howard ‘H-Bomb’ Davis, Nov 2011 |url=https://banana1015.com/evans-blue-part-ways-with-drummer-howard-h-bomb-davis/ |website=banana1015.com |publisher=Banana 1015 |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://therocktribune.com/2011/11/09/evans-blue-parts-ways-with-drummer-howard-davis-and-hits-the-studio-to-record-album-four/|title=EVANS BLUE PARTS WAYS WITH DRUMMER HOWARD DAVIS AND HITS THE STUDIO TO RECORD ALBUM FOUR|website=Therocktribune.com|date=November 9, 2011}}</ref> The band brought in session drummers [[Mike McClure]] and [[Jason Pierce (drummer)|Jason Pierce]] ([[Our Lady Peace]]), both for recording and touring; Davis is not credited on ''Graveyard of Empires''.

=== Hiatus and ''Letters From the Dead'' (2012–present) ===
In an interview, Chandler stated that Evans Blue would be taking a break, due to the fact that Parker Lauzon and Vlad Tanaskovic were becoming fathers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crypticrock.com/interview-dan-chandler-of-fight-or-flight/|title=Interview – Dan Chandler of Fight or Flight|website=Crypticrock.com|date=June 25, 2013}}</ref> Chandler joined a side project named [[Fight or Flight (band)|Fight or Flight]] with [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] members [[Dan Donegan]] and [[Mike Wengren]]. He also started a hip-hop project called A Strange Day of Calm, and a band called Switchthree.<ref>{{cite web |title=Switchthree |url=https://www.facebook.com/switchthreemusic/ |website=facebook.com |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> 

In August 2015, Evans Blue began recording their fifth album, ''Letters from the Dead''. The first single, "iGod", was released on January 8, 2016; with the album's release following shortly thereafter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/evans-blue-igod-exclusive-lyric-video-premiere/|title=Evans Blue, 'iGod' - Exclusive Lyric Video Premiere|first=Chad|last=Childers|website=Loudwire.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://evansblue1.tumblr.com/about|title=about &#124;|website=Evansblue1.tumblr.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hasitleaked.com/2016/evans-blue-letters-from-the-dead/|title=Evans Blue : Letters From The Dead album download |website=Hasitleaked.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=S |first1=Nat |title=Evans Blue Letters from the Dead |url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/73177/Evans-Blue-Letters-from-the-Dead/ |website=sputnikmusic.com |publisher=Sputnik Music |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref>
