'''Loudon Snowden Wainwright III''' (born September 5, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter and occasional actor. In addition to the 1970s novelty song "[[Dead Skunk|Dead Skunk (in the Middle of the Road)]]", he has released 24 studio albums, 4 live albums, and 6 compilations. He has played small roles in at least 18 television programs and feature films, including three episodes in the third season of the series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''.

Reflecting upon his career in 1999, he stated, "You could characterize the catalog as somewhat checkered, although I prefer to think of it as a tapestry."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lw3.com/news.php?section=articles&article=7 |title=Loudon Wainwright III |publisher=Lw3.com |date=June 20, 1999 |access-date=April 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727202441/http://www.lw3.com/news.php?section=articles&article=7 |archive-date=July 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2017, Wainwright released his autobiography, ''Liner Notes: On Parents & Children, Exes & Excess, Death & Decay, and a Few of My Other Favorite Things''. He is the brother of singer [[Sloan Wainwright]], and the father of musicians [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Martha Wainwright]], and [[Lucy Wainwright Roche]]. He was married to folk singer [[Kate McGarrigle]].

==Early life==
Wainwright was born in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], the son of Martha Taylor, a [[yoga]] teacher, and [[Loudon Wainwright Jr.]], a columnist and editor for [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/10/Loudon-Wainwright-III.html |title=Loudon Wainwright, III Biography (1946–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=2014-03-19}}</ref> His great-great-grandfather was the politician and diplomat [[A. Loudon Snowden]]. His father was not a professional musician, but he played the piano and wrote some songs, exposing his children to musicians such as [[Tom Lehrer]] and [[Stan Freberg]], whom Wainwright later cited as influences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Needles|first=Tim|title=Legendary Songwriter Loudon Wainwright III|url=http://www.shortandsweetnyc.com/2010/06/legendary-songwriter-loudon-wainwright-iii/|work=Short and Sweet NYC|access-date=January 19, 2012}}</ref> Wainwright grew up in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford, New York]], in [[Westchester County]]. Among his sisters is [[Sloan Wainwright]], also a singer. He graduated from [[St. Andrew's School (Delaware)|St. Andrew's School]] in [[Delaware]], where the movie ''[[Dead Poets Society]]'' was filmed.

==Career==
Wainwright's career began in the late 1960s. He had played the guitar while in school but later sold it for [[yoga]] lessons while living in San Francisco. Later, in [[Rhode Island]], Wainwright's grandmother got him a job working in a boatyard. An old lobsterman named Edgar inspired him to borrow a friend's guitar and write his first song, "Edgar". Wainwright soon bought his own guitar and in about a year wrote nearly twenty songs. He went to Boston and New York City to play in folk clubs and was eventually noticed by Milton Kramer, who became his manager. He signed a record deal with [[Atlantic Records]], which released his [[Loudon Wainwright III (album)|self-titled first album]] in 1970.

Wainwright is perhaps best known for the 1972 novelty song "[[Dead Skunk|Dead Skunk (in the Middle of the Road)]]" and for playing Captain Calvin Spalding (the "singing surgeon") on the American television show ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. His appearances spanned three episodes in its third season (1974–1975).<ref name=nm0906525>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906525/ imdb.com – Loudon Wainwright III] Retrieved October 6, 2008</ref>

Using a witty, self-mocking style, Wainwright has recorded over twenty albums on eleven different labels. Three of his albums have been nominated for [[Grammy Award]]s: ''[[I'm Alright (Loudon Wainwright III album)|I'm Alright]]'' (1985), ''[[More Love Songs]]'' (1986),<ref name="lw3bio">{{cite web

}}</ref> and ''[[High Wide & Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project]]'' (2009), for which he won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album in January 2010.

Wainwright has also appeared in a number of films, including small parts in ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', ''[[Big Fish]]'', ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'', ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', ''[[28 Days (film)|28 Days]]'', and ''[[Knocked Up]]'', and the television series ''[[Undeclared]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''.<ref name=nm0906525/> In the UK he recorded sessions for [[John Peel]] from 1971 onwards  and appeared on a simultaneous broadcast on BBC TV and on Radio 1 in February 1978 (known as Sight and Sound in Concert).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120128101747/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/471247 BFI Film & TV Database] Retrieved January 16, 2011</ref> However, it was in the late 1980s that he gained much wider popularity in Britain when he appeared as the resident singer with comedian [[Jasper Carrott]] in his UK show, ''Carrott Confidential'', and has remained popular in the UK ever since.

He appeared as a musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first season]]'s fifth episode, which was hosted by [[Robert Klein]] and broadcast on November 15, 1975. He performed "Bicentennial" and "Unrequited to the Nth Degree".

Wainwright has said that, like many of his contemporaries, he was inspired musically by seeing [[Bob Dylan]] at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] in 1963. He was one of many young folksingers tagged as the "new Dylan" in the early 1970s, a fact that he later ruefully satirized in his song, "Talking New Bob Dylan", from the album ''[[History (Loudon Wainwright III album)|History]]'' (1992).<ref name="lw3bio"/>

Wainwright was a judge for the 4th annual [[AIM Independent Music Awards|Independent Music Awards]].<ref>[http://independentmusicawards.com/past-ima-judges/ Independent Music Awards – Past Judges] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024722/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |date=July 13, 2011 }}.</ref>

Wainwright entered a period of deep depression following the death of his mother in 1997 and believed he could never write again. Retreating to his mother's cabin in the woods, he underwent therapy and gradually recovered, eventually recording the soul-baring ''[[Last Man on Earth (album)|Last Man on Earth]]'' in 2001. Since then, his recording career has mostly returned to its previous frequency.

Wainwright and musician [[Joe Henry]] composed the music for the 2007 [[Judd Apatow]] film ''[[Knocked Up]]''. In addition to composing the soundtrack, Wainwright appeared in the film in a supporting role as the protagonists' [[obstetrician]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478311/fullcredits#cast imdb.com – Knocked Up] Retrieved October 6, 2008</ref> He has also composed music for the new theatre production of [[Carl Hiaasen]]'s ''[[Lucky You (theatre adaptation)|Lucky You]]'', which premiered at the [[2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].<ref>{{cite web

As of 2020 Wainwright has continued to release new music.

==Personal life==
Wainwright's first marriage, to singer-songwriter [[Kate McGarrigle]], ended in divorce. During their marriage, they had two children: [[Rufus Wainwright|Rufus]] and [[Martha Wainwright|Martha]]. Rufus was the inspiration behind two of Wainwright's songs: "Rufus Is a Tit Man" (referring to his breastfeeding) and "A Father and a Son", a retrospective. Wainwright's songs inspired by Martha are "Pretty Little Martha" (also about her as an infant), "Five Years Old" (about missing her fifth birthday), the confessional "Hitting You", duet "Father/Daughter Dialogue", and comedy number, "I'd Rather Be Lonely."

Both Rufus and Martha are singer-songwriters. Rufus composed "Dinner at Eight", about his conflicted relationship with his father.<ref>{{ cite news |title=Rufus Wainwright Journeys to 'Gay Hell' and Back |first=Anthony |last=DeCurtis |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 31, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/31/arts/music-rufus-wainwright-journeys-to-gay-hell-and-back.html}}</ref> Martha composed the song "[[Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole]]," which according to her is about her father.<ref>{{ cite news |title=The Guardian profile: The Wainwrights |first=Richard |last=Jinman |newspaper=The Guardian |date=April 15, 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/apr/15/usa.popandrock}}</ref> They sang a duet on the song "Father Daughter Dialogue" (on Wainwright's 1995 album ''[[Grown Man (album)|Grown Man]]'') and collaborated on the song "You Never Phone" (on Wainwright's 2003 album ''[[So Damn Happy (Loudon Wainwright III album)|So Damn Happy]]'').

Wainwright had a relationship with the singer [[Suzzy Roche]], during which they had a daughter, [[Lucy Wainwright Roche]], who is also a singer. The relationship ended, although Wainwright and Suzzy Roche remain on good terms and occasionally appear onstage together, sometimes with Lucy.

Wainwright's second marriage, to Ritamarie Kelly, ended in divorce. They have a daughter, Alexandra (Lexie) Kelly Wainwright (born 1993). Since 2015, Wainwright has lived with Susan Morrison, an editor at ''The New Yorker''.<ref>{{ cite news |title=The Patriarch |first=John |last=Seabrook|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=September 21, 2009 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2009/09/21/090921ta_talk_seabrook}}</ref><ref>{{ cite news |title=Barking Up the Family Tree |first=Steve |last=Dollar |newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=May 15, 2012 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304371504577404912563994728}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wainwright & I|first=Lexie|last=Kelly|website=Ross School|access-date=25 March 2016|url=http://seniorproject.ross.org/archives/2010-2011/Kelly/essaysattachedarchiving/Wainwright%20and%20I%20Templete%20done.pdf}}</ref>
