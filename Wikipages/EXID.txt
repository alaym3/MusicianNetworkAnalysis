EXID debuted in February 2012, with the single "Whoz That Girl". Though the album gained some attention, it was not until 2014 that the group unexpectedly gained popularity with the single "[[Up & Down (song)|Up & Down]]", which reached number one on the [[Gaon Singles Chart]] four months after release due to a fan-recording of a live performance becoming a [[viral video]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/6473206/exid-up-down-lg-video-fancam|title=EXID Release New Version of Breakout Hit 'Up & Down' After Sexy Viral Video Success|magazine=Billboard|access-date=June 2, 2016|archive-date=June 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604215931/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/6473206/exid-up-down-lg-video-fancam|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

==History==

=== 2011–2013: Formation and debut, line-up changes and Dasoni unit ===
In May 2011, producer [[Shinsadong Tiger]] and AB Entertainment scouted several trainees from [[JYP Entertainment]] to form a new girl group. Trainee Yuji was the first to join the JYP girl group but failed to debut. Yuji contacted the trainees Hani, Haeryeong, and Jeonghwa to audition for AB, and all three were subsequently accepted into the agency. The group added a fifth member when Shinsadong Tiger discovered [[LE (rapper)|LE]], an underground rapper and songwriter who performed under the name Elly. Dami, who was already an AB trainee, was the sixth and last member added to the group.<ref>{{cite web|title=EXID와 베스티의 분리 과정 정리 The story behind the split between EXID and Bestie|url=http://pann.nate.com/talk/325486645|website=Nate Pann|access-date=March 21, 2015|archive-date=January 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116221714/http://pann.nate.com/talk/325486645|url-status=live}}</ref> Originally named "WT", an acronym for "Who's That", the group changed their name to EXID a few months before their debut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biz.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=20111021000795 |script-title=ko:신사동호랭이, 걸그룹 WT 제작자로 변신..내년 초 전격 데뷔 |date=October 21, 2011 |website=The Korea Herald |access-date=December 10, 2014 |language=ko |archive-date=August 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808113022/http://biz.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=20111021000795 |url-status=live }}</ref> In December 2011, LE was featured in [[Huh Gak]]'s single "Whenever You Play That Song", which appeared on Korean music charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://starin.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?SCD=EA21&newsid=01134886596476880&DCD=A10202 |script-title=ko:EXID LE, 허각과 함께 한 '그 노래를 틀때마다'로 1위 '감격' |last=Kim |first=Eun-gu |date=December 9, 2011 |website=Edaily |access-date=December 10, 2014 |language=ko |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230730/http://starin.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?SCD=EA21&newsid=01134886596476880&DCD=A10202 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/3556/exid-releases-debut-mv|title=Huh Gak Le releases 'Whenever You Play That Song'|date=December 9, 2011|website=[[MTV K]]|access-date=December 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705185917/http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/3556/exid-releases-debut-mv|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> EXID was scheduled to debut in January 2012, but their debut was delayed to February when LE sustained a leg injury during rehearsals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.korea.com/blog/enter/k-pop/shinsadong-horaengis-new-girl-group-exid-postpone-their-debut-to-february-why/ |title=Shinsadong Horaengi's new girl group EXID postpone their debut to February, Why? |date=January 23, 2012 |work=Starnews |publisher=Korea.com |access-date=December 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128141303/http://en.korea.com/blog/enter/k-pop/shinsadong-horaengis-new-girl-group-exid-postpone-their-debut-to-february-why/ |archive-date=January 28, 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> On February 3, AB Entertainment announced that EXID would debut with the single "Whoz That Girl".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20120204/43786426/4 |title=신사동호랭이 표 걸그룹 EXID, 티저포스터 공개 |last=Kim |first=Eun-gu |date=February 4, 2012 |website=Donga |access-date=December 10, 2014 |language=ko |archive-date=January 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128133149/http://news.donga.com/3/all/20120204/43786426/4 |url-status=live }}</ref> Video teasers featuring the members doing solo performances were subsequently released online.
