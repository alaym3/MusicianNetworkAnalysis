==History==

===Formation and ''While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets'' (2005–2007)===
Cobra Starship was formed in 2005 after [[Midtown (band)|Midtown]] bassist [[Gabe Saporta]] took a trip to the deserts of [[Arizona]]. During this time, Saporta went on a "vision quest", spending time with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes and smoking [[peyote]].<ref name="Alternative Press">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/portfolios/samples_files/88544_RM8g0Dgmnnq3yUID7N_FtiD7x.pdf|title=Fangs for the Memories|last=Manley|first=Brendan|date=2008-06-03|work=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc.|access-date=2010-10-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123191311/http://www.mediabistro.com/portfolios/samples_files/88544_RM8g0Dgmnnq3yUID7N_FtiD7x.pdf|archive-date=2011-11-23}}</ref> He began to create his vision for a new band, a melodic style of music heavily influenced by [[synthpop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]].<ref name="Alternative Press"/> Upon returning home, Saporta rented a house in the [[Catskill Mountains]] and began writing what would become the band's debut album, ''[[While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets]]''. He posted a parody response to [[Gwen Stefani]]'s "[[Hollaback Girl]]" titled "Hollaback Boy" on [[Myspace]]. The song gained Saporta notoriety on the internet and he eventually signed to [[DCD2 Records|Decaydance Records]], the label of his good friend and [[Fall Out Boy]]'s bassist [[Pete Wentz]].<ref name="TalkingSnake">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1537271/cobra-starship-owe-success-talking-snake.jhtml|title=Cobra Starship Owe Success To Talking Snake From The Future|last=Montgomery|first=James|publisher=MTV News|date=July 27, 2006|access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref>

Midtown's management company soon set Saporta up with an opportunity to record a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]''. Along with members of [[The Academy Is...]], [[Gym Class Heroes]], and [[The Sounds]], Saporta recorded "[[Snakes on a Plane (Bring It)]]", which became a minor hit.<ref name="Snakesonaplane">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1536196/snakes-on-plane-soundtrack-fob-panic.jhtml|title=Snakes On A Soundtrack — Samuel L.

===''Hot Mess'' (2009–2010)===
Following the success of [[Katy Perry]]'s "[[I Kissed a Girl]]", Cobra Starship recorded their own cover version, "I Kissed a Boy", in summer 2008. The song was released on August 25, 2008, on [[Fall Out Boy]]'s [[Fall Out Boy#Citizens for Our Betterment (2008)|Citizens For Our Betterment]] mixtape ''[[Welcome To The New Administration]]''.

In 2009, the band went to a cabin in Pennsylvania, in an attempt to produce new material. They broadcast live throughout their stay on the live camera feed site [[Stickam]], thus creating the Shelf Kids, the fans of Cobra Starship. After their stay, a new album was announced with a tentative release in the summer. The band worked with [[Kara DioGuardi]], [[Kevin Rudolf]], [[S*A*M and Sluggo]], and songwriters [[Benny Blanco]] and [[Patrick Stump]] on ''Hot Mess''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609302/20090415/cobra_starship.jhtml|title='American Idol' Judge Kara DioGuardi Working With Cobra Starship|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=2009-04-15|publisher=MTV|access-date=2009-04-26}}</ref> ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' star [[Leighton Meester]] is featured on the song "[[Good Girls Go Bad]]", which is produced by [[Kevin Rudolf]] and co-written by Rudolf and [[Kara DioGuardi]].<ref name="leighton">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609487/20090417/cobra_starship.jhtml|title=Cobra Starship, Leighton Meester Collaborating On New Song|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=2009-04-17|publisher=MTV|access-date=2009-04-26}}</ref> The song is the album's first single, and was added on [[iTunes]] on May 11 and available to listen to on the band's official [[MySpace]] page.
