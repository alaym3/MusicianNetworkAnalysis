==Biography==
Cage formed in 1992 with the original lineup being, Sean Peck (Vocals), David Garcia (Guitar), Eric Horton (Guitar), Mike Giordano (Bass), and Damian Arletto (Drums). Peck had previously been the leader of a band called Nomad, while Garcia and Giordano had performed with Crusher.<ref name="SDR">{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/bands/cage/|title=Cage|website=San Diego Reader|accessdate=November 4, 2021}}</ref> Garcia and Horton had also been a part of Nomad with Peck.<ref name="Metallum">{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/cage/417|title=Cage|website=Encyclopedia Metallum|accessdate=November 4, 2021}}</ref> Even though the band formed in 1992, the band did not release their first album, ''Unveiled'', until 1998, likely due to it being self-produced.<ref name="SDR"/>  By 1999, Arletto had exited the band  and was replaced by Mike Nielsen.

The band became known around the time of their second album, ''[[Astrology (album)|Astrology]]'', released in 2001, via Molten Metal.<ref name="Metal-Rules"/><ref name="NLTM">{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/cage.htm|title=Cage|website=No Life Til Metal|accessdate=November 4, 2021}}</ref> The album was Nielsen's debut with the band. Shortly after this period of time, Cage signed to [[Massacre Records]], then home to artists such as [[King Diamond]], [[Virgin Black]], and [[Mystic Circle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/labels/Massacre_Records/6#label_tabs_albums|title=Massacre Records - Albums|website=Encyclopedia Metallum|accessdate=November 4, 2021}}</ref> Following their signing, the band released their third album, ''Darker Than Black'', which came out in 2003.<ref name="DTB"/> By this time, Anthony McGinnis had joined as the band's new guitarist, replacing Horton.

In 2007, the band released their fourth full-length album, ''[[Hell Destroyer]]'', which came out through MTM Music, featuring artists such as [[Stryper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/labels/MTM_Music/266#label_tabs_albums|title=MTM Music - Albums|website=Encyclopedia Metallum|accessdate=November 4, 2021}}</ref> ''Hell Destroyer'' became the band's most commercial album to date following ta release, receiving several positive reviews from many different sites.<ref name="NRT">{{cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/albumdetail.php?album_id=4915&sortflag=2&page=1|title=Hell Destroyer by Cage|publisher=New Release Today|author=coreministry01|date=April 14, 2008|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Brave Words">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/albumdetail.php?album_id=4915&sortflag=2&page=1|title=CAGE – Hell Destroyer|publisher=[[Brave Words]]|first=Mark|last=Gromen|date=June 26, 2007|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Metallized">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metallized.it/recensione.php?id=1499|title=Cage – Hell Destroyer|publisher=Metallized|accessdate=December 27, 2016|language=it}}</ref><ref name="Metal Storm">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=4423|title=Cage – Hell Destroyer review|publisher=Metal Storm|author=Jeff|date=June 7, 2007|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}</ref> Mark Gromen of [[Brave Words]] praised the album saying "Easily my favourite Cage disc since ''Unveiled''!"<ref name="Brave Words"/> Scott Alisoglu of [[Blabbermouth.net]] stated "Heavy metal concept albums are hit or miss propositions.....There are very few albums that can claim to be as quintessentially heavy metal as ''Hell Destroyer''.<ref name="Blabbermouth.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/cdreviews/hell-destroyer/|title=CD Reviews – Hell Destroyer Cage|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|first=Scott|last=Alisoglu|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}</ref> In August 2007, Nielsen departed from the band, being replaced by former [[Psychotic Waltz]] drummer Norm Leggio.<ref name="SDR"/>

With this lineup, the band set out to write and record their fifth album, ''[[Science of Annihilation]]'', which was released through [[Pure Steel Records]].<ref name="SDR"/> Pure Steel was home to [[Mortician (band)|Mortician]] and [[Warrant (German band)|Warrant]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/labels/Pure_Steel_Records/234|title=Pure Steel Records|website=Encyclopedia Metallum|accessdate=November 4, 2021}}</ref> In early 2010, original bassist Mike Giordano and lead guitarist Anthony Wayne McGinnis exited the band. Giordano stated that he departed due to "medical issues", whereas McGinnis stepped down due to "family issues".<ref name="SDR"/> Later that year, the band recruited members; bassist Steve Brogden (guitarist/vocalist for the power/thrash metal band Howler) and former Brick Bath bassist Pete Stone.<ref name="SDR"/> 

The band released their sixth full-length album, ''Supremacy of Steel'', in 2011, with the lineup of Peck, Garcia, Brogden, Stone, and Leggio. The artwork for the album was designed by [[Marvel Comics]] illustrator Marc Sasso.<ref name="SDR"/> However, Brogden departed before the album was released, being replaced by Climhazzard member Garret Peters.<ref name="SDR"/> However, by 2013, the band essentially dissolved, with Stone, Peters, and Leggio departing from the band.<ref name="SDR"/> In 18-months time, Garcia wrote a solo album titled ''Hellscream'', working alongside former Imagika vocalist Norman Skinner.<ref name="SDR"/>

Upon reconvening the band in 2013, Peck and Garcia were tasked with creating a new lineup. The two hired on former Monument member Casey Trask, Nihilist drummer Sean Elg, and Dwight "Magic" Moy of Detonated on bass.<ref name="SDR"/> With the new band in place, the five entered the studio to record their seventh studio album, ''Ancient Evil'', a 19-track [[Concept album]].<ref name="SDR"/> Shortly after the recording of the album, however, Moy quit the band and was replaced by Alex Pickard of the Oceanside, California-based band Monarch.<ref name="SDR"/>

As of 2018, the band currently double as The Three Tremors, a collaborative effort of all current members of Cage, [[Jag Panzer]] vocalist Harry "The Tyrant" Conklin, and former [[Iced Earth]] and [[Judas Priest]] vocalist [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecosmickview.blogspot.com/2019/04/interview-with-three-tremors-vocalist.html?m=1|title=Interview with Three Tremors Vocalist Sean Peck (Cage, Death Dealers)|website=The Cosmick View|first=Mick|last=Michaels|date=April 19, 2019|accessdate=November 5, 2021}}</ref> The Three Tremors have put out three studio albums, ''The Three Tremors'', ''The Solo Versions'', and ''Guardians of the Void''.
