==Career==
===Early musical career===
Cross first played with a San Antonio-based cover band named Flash before signing a solo contract with [[Warner Bros.]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saboomie.com/txband/flash.jpg |title=Christopher Cross & Flash |access-date=2010-04-26 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715222114/http://www.saboomie.com/txband/flash.jpg |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref> Although best known for his vocals, Cross's guitar-playing is such that it once led to an unfulfilled invitation to play with [[Donald Fagen]] and [[Walter Becker]] of [[Steely Dan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mixonline.com/recording/classic-track-ride-wind-christopher-cross-425710|title=Classic Track: "Ride Like the Wind,"Christopher Cross|first=Robyn|last=Flans|website=Mixonline|date=September 25, 2015}}</ref> He also played guitar during a [[Deep Purple]] concert in 1970 when [[Ritchie Blackmore]] fell ill shortly before the show.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prato|first1=Greg|title=Interview: Christopher Cross, Songwriter|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/christopher_cross/#?1#?1#WebrootPlugIn#?1#?1#PhreshPhish#?1#?1#agtpwd|publisher=Songfacts, LLC|access-date=28 September 2014|year=2014}}</ref>

===The first album, and immediate success===
Cross released his self-titled debut album, ''[[Christopher Cross (album)|Christopher Cross]]'', in 1979. The [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top 20 hits from this album included "[[Ride Like the Wind]]" (featuring backing vocals by [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]]), "[[Sailing (Christopher Cross song)|Sailing]]", "[[Never Be the Same (Christopher Cross song)|Never Be the Same]]", and "Say You'll Be Mine" (featuring backing vocals by [[Nicolette Larson]]). "Ride Like the Wind" hit No. 2 on the U.S. Hot 100, while "Sailing" topped the chart. "Never Be The Same" went No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Owing to the almost immediate success and popularity gained by the album, Cross was nominated for several Grammy Awards, garnering five.  Cross was the first artist in Grammy history to win all four general field awards in a single ceremony, bringing home [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] ("[[Sailing (Christopher Cross song)|Sailing]]"), [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] (''[[Christopher Cross (album)|Christopher Cross]]''), [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] ("[[Sailing (Christopher Cross song)|Sailing]]"), and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] at the [[23rd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 1981; this was not replicated until [[Billie Eilish]] won all four awards at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2020.<ref name=EW2007>

===The second album===
Cross's second album, ''[[Another Page]]'' (1983), produced "[[All Right]]", "No Time for Talk", and "[[Think of Laura]]".  "All Right" was used by [[CBS Sports]] for its highlights montage following the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], while "Think of Laura" is used as a reference to [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|characters]] on the soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]''. Cross allowed [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to use his song in this context; however, he has stated that he wrote "Think of Laura" not in reference to the television characters, but to celebrate the life of [[Denison University]] college student Laura Carter who was killed when she was struck by a stray bullet. ''Another Page'' sold well, getting Gold Certification. He also co-wrote and sang the song "A Chance For Heaven" for the [[1984 Summer Olympics#Music|1984 Summer Olympic Games]].

===The curse of the MTV generation===
After 1984, Cross's star quickly dimmed. As music television channel [[MTV]] grew to dominate the mainstream music scene in the United States, Cross's style of music proved to be a bad fit for the network, and Cross's brand of [[adult contemporary music]] declined in popularity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/christopher-cross-has-his-first-of-two-1-hits-with-sailing |title=Christopher Cross has his first of two #1 hits with "Sailing" – History.com This Day in History – 8/30/1980|website=History.com|access-date=March 29, 2015}}</ref>

Cross's next two albums, 1985's ''[[Every Turn of the World]]'' and 1988's ''[[Back of My Mind]]'' did not produce any top 40 hits or reach Gold or Platinum status.

He did, however, place the song "Swept Away" in the TV show ''[[Growing Pains]]''. It was used during a video montage while [[Kirk Cameron]]'s character Mike fell in love with a local girl while vacationing with the family in Hawaii.

===The 1990s===
Cross made three more albums in the 1990s, and although some of his releases gained critical response, he was not able to attract the mass audience he once enjoyed. After his decline in fame in the mid-1980s, he toured and opened for various acts during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/ChristopherCrossInterview.html |title=Classicbands.com |website=Classicbands.com |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/10/entertainment/ca-48215 |title=Los Angeles Times |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=May 10, 1998 |access-date=October 11, 2011 |first=Marc |last=Weingarten}}</ref>

===The 2000s===
The year 2002 saw the release of ''Very Best of...'' album, and in 2007 he completed a Christmas album titled ''A Christopher Cross Christmas''. In 2008, Cross recorded a new acoustic album of his hits titled ''The Cafe Carlyle Sessions''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noted.blogs.com/westcoastmusic/2008/10/interview-with.html |title=Westcoastmusic |website=Noted.blogs.com |date=October 2, 2008 |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemusicast.com/musicasts/2009/5/4/christopher-cross.html |title=Insidemusicast.com |website=Insidemusicast.com |date=May 4, 2009 |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

===The 2010s===
In 2011, Cross released a new studio album titled ''Doctor Faith''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christophercross.com/ccDrFaith.html |title=Christopher Cross Website – Doctor Faith Release |website=Christophercross.com |access-date=October 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927041514/http://www.christophercross.com/ccDrFaith.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2013, he released ''A Night in Paris'', a 2-CD live album he recorded and filmed in April 2012 at the [[Le Trianon (theatre)|Theatre Le Trianon]] in Paris, France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ear-music.net/en/news/details/christopher-cross-returns-with-his-first-live-release-a-night-in-paris|title=Christopher Cross Returns with his First Live Release "A Night in Paris"|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713035946/http://www.ear-music.net/en/news/details/christopher-cross-returns-with-his-first-live-release-a-night-in-paris/|archive-date=July 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The song "Ride Like the Wind" was featured on the ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'' original movie soundtrack, released in 2013.

In September 2014, he released ''Secret Ladder'', followed in November 2017 by ''Take Me as I Am''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://christophercross.com/music.html|title=Christopher Cross Official Web Site|website=Christophercross.com}}</ref>

In 2017, he played a concert in his hometown, at the [[Tobin Center for the Performing Arts|Tobin Center]], San Antonio, Texas.<ref>David Hendricks [https://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/music-stage/article/Christopher-Cross-returns-to-San-Antonio-better-11194359.php#next"Christopher Cross returns to San Antonio better than ever"],''my SA'', June 5, 2017</ref>  In 2018, he joined with other musicians in Austin to form the band Freedonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christophercross.com/freedonia|title=Christopher Cross Official Web Site|website=Christophercross.com}}</ref>

In late 2019, Cross toured with [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Jason Scheff]], [[Micky Dolenz]] and [[Joey Molland]] of [[Badfinger]] in celebration of [[the Beatles]]' ''White Album'' on the "It Was Fifty Years Ago Today – A Tribute to the Beatles' White Album". Cross performed "[[Sailing (Christopher Cross song)|Sailing]]" and "[[Ride Like the Wind]]".<ref>[https://bestclassicbands.com/beatles-white-album-tribute-tour-9-30-19/ Dolenz, Rundgren, Molland Begins Beatles Tribute Tour|Best Classic Bands]</ref>

==Flamingo==
One common feature of Cross's album covers is the appearance of a [[flamingo]]. According to Cross, there is no meaning behind this, other than that the painting chosen for the first album cover featured the bird, which has been used as a motif ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christophercross.com/faqs.html|title=Christopher Cross Official Website - FAQs|website=Christophercross.com|access-date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>

==Personal life==
A self-described [[Military brat|"Army brat"]], Cross is the son of a U.S. Army pediatrician stationed at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Army Hospital]] in Washington, D.C., in the mid-1950s, acting as physician for [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s grandchildren.<ref>Christopher Cross. Comments during Concert at Wolf Trap Performing Arts Center, Vienna, Virginia. January 19, 2013.</ref> He attended Alamo Heights High School in San Antonio and graduated in 1969. He was involved in football and track and field.  
<ref>[https://www.classmates.com/blog/celebrity/christopher-cross/ classmates.com]</ref>
Cross was married to Roseanne Harrison from 1973 until the couple divorced in 1982. His 1988 marriage to Jan Bunch ended in a 2007 divorce.<ref>{{cite news |title=Christopher Cross files for divorce |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2007-04-27-3609417800_x.htm |newspaper=USA TODAY |access-date=December 18, 2011 |date=April 27, 2007}}</ref>

Cross has a son from his first marriage and two children from his second marriage, a son and daughter.

On April 3, 2020, Cross confirmed through his [[Facebook page]] that he had tested positive for the [[COVID-19]] virus, and was ill, but was recovering. Cross later reported on [[Twitter]] that he has lost the use of his legs, but his doctors have told him he should fully recover. Physicians told him his COVID-19 disease triggered an episode of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] that caused the nerves in his legs to stop functioning properly.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lisa Respers France |title=Christopher Cross says Covid-19 paralyzed him temporarily |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/16/entertainment/christopher-cross-coronavirus/index.html |access-date=2020-10-16 |website=CNN}}</ref> On October 18, 2020, during an interview with ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'', Cross described what COVID-19 is like for him, in his first public appearance since contracting the virus. The effects of COVID-19 still linger as Cross considers himself a "Long Haul" survivor. Cross advocated the [[Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic|wearing of masks]] and is eager to tour again.
 
In 2019 he prepared to go on tour in 2020 as a 40th year celebration of his successful debut album bearing his name.  He had dates booked at various venues in the United States beginning in early 2020, but the Covid pandemic rapidly became widespread.  Initially, his dates were rescheduled for later in the year, but then it became apparent that the time frame would be a lot longer.  Finally in September 2021 when restrictions were greatly softened, he began fulfilling those concert dates and once again performing live in front of packed venues nationwide.
