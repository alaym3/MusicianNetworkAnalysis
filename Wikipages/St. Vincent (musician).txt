'''Annie Erin Clark''' (born September 28, 1982), known professionally as '''St. Vincent''', is an American musician, singer, actress, songwriter and producer. She began her music career as a member of [[the Polyphonic Spree]]. She was also a member of [[Sufjan Stevens]]'s touring band before forming her own band in 2006.

It also made her the first solo female performer in 20 years to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Grammy for Best Alternative Album]] (her first [[Grammy Award]]). 

In 2018, two of her songs were included in [[NPR]]'s "200 Greatest songs by 21st Century Women":<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/627395449/turning-the-tables-the-200-greatest-songs-by-21st-century-women-part-1|title=The 200 Greatest Songs By 21st Century Women+|newspaper=NPR|date=July 30, 2018|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> "[[Digital Witness]]" (from ''St. Vincent''), placed at #181, and "Cruel" (from ''Strange Mercy''), at #38.

As a child, Clark was fond of [[Ritchie Valens]] and the movie [[La Bamba (film)|''La Bamba'']]. When she was five, her mother gave her a red plastic guitar from a [[Target Corporation|Target]] store for Christmas. She began playing her first real guitar at age 12 and worked some of her teenage years as a roadie for her aunt and uncle, the guitar-vocal jazz duo [[Tuck & Patti]].<ref name="Ryzik">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/arts/music/07vince.html|title=Friendly, and Just a Bit Creepy: St. Vincent Defies Categories|access-date=June 16, 2009 | work=The New York Times | first=Melena | last=Ryzik | date=May 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Dombal |date=February 17, 2014 |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9331-st-vincent-reckless-precision/ |title=St. Vincent: Reckless Precision |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |access-date=April 12, 2014}}</ref> In 2001, she graduated from [[Lake Highlands High School]], where she participated in theater and the school's jazz band, and was a classmate of actor [[Mark Salling]].<ref>{{cite interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOLRuD0F3wM|title=St Vincent Interview – Toro Magazine|interviewer=Marko Prelic|first=Annie|last=Clark|via=YouTube|access-date=February 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2007-07-05/music/sanctified/|title=Dallas Observer feature, July 5, 2007|date=July 5, 2007|access-date=June 16, 2009}}</ref>

She attended the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], studying with Professor Lauren Passarelli. She left after  three years, feeling that art institutions such as Berklee were sometimes focused more on the aesthetics of art than the product.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/05/as-st-vincent-annie-clark-conjures-magic.html|title=LA Times feature, May 27, 2009|access-date=June 16, 2009 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=May 27, 2009}}</ref> In retrospect, she said, "I think that with music school and art school, or school in any form, there has to be some system of grading and measurement.

While all that is good and has its place, at some point you have to learn all you can and then forget everything that you learned in order to actually start making music."<ref name="west"/>

===2003–2007: Career beginnings and ''Marry Me''===

In 2003, Clark released an EP with fellow Berklee students entitled ''[[Ratsliveonnoevilstar]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whokilledthemixtape.blogspot.com/2008/02/early-st-vincent-annie-clark-ep.html|title= Early St. Vincent EP at Who Killed the Mixtape?|access-date=February 24, 2008}}</ref> She also worked with Heavy Rotation Records, where "she revealed a much more private and intimate rendering of 'Count' for ''Dorm Sessions Vol. 1''"<ref>{{cite web|last=Mana|first=Toshio|title=Heavy Sessions|url=http://www.berklee.edu/news/2003/02/hrrdorm.html|access-date=August 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030319020002/http://www.berklee.edu/news/2003/02/hrrdorm.html|archive-date=March 19, 2003}}</ref> and studied with Professor of Guitar Lauren Passarelli.

During this period she recorded and released an EP entitled ''[[Paris Is Burning (EP)|Paris is Burning]]''.

[[File:Annieclark1.jpg|thumb|upright|Clark on stage in 2007]]
In 2006, she began recording a studio album under the stage name St. Vincent. In an interview on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', she said that she "took [her] moniker from a line in a [[Nick Cave]] song" that referred to the hospital where [[Dylan Thomas]] died: "And Dylan Thomas died drunk in / [[St. Vincent's Hospital (Manhattan)|St. Vincent's hospital]]" (from Cave's song "There She Goes my Beautiful World", from the album ''[[Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus]]''). The name is also a reference to her great-grandmother, whose middle name was St. Vincent.<ref>Chris Barrett, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091018015245/http://www.metropulse.com/news/2009/oct/07/annie-clark-discusses-her-band-st-vincent-and-art-/ "Annie Clark Discusses Her Band, St. Vincent, and the Art of Whole-Body Guitar"], ''[[Metro Pulse]]'', October 7, 2009. Accessed at the Internet Archive, October 2, 2015.</ref>

Clark released her debut album, ''[[Marry Me (album)|Marry Me]]'', on July 10, 2007 on [[Beggars Banquet Records]]. Named after a line from the television show ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/6680-st-vincent/|title=Pitchfork Guestlist Feature|work=Pitchfork|access-date=February 25, 2014}}</ref> it features appearances from drummer Brian Teasley ([[Man or Astro-man?]], the Polyphonic Spree), [[Mike Garson]] ([[David Bowie]]'s longtime pianist), and horn player Louis Schwadron (the Polyphonic Spree).

The album was well received by critics, who compared Clark to the likes of [[Kate Bush]] and David Bowie,<ref name="pf">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10457-marry-me/|work=Pitchfork|title=Marry Me review|date=July 27, 2007|author=Klein, Joshua}}</ref> and lauded the album for its arrangements, themes and style. In their review, ''The AV Club'' said: "There's a point where too much happiness turns into madness, and St. Vincent's multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark knows this place well".<ref name="av"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' said, "At every turn ''Marry Me'' takes the more challenging route of twisting already twisted structures and unusual instrumentation to make them sound perfectly natural and, most importantly, easy to listen to as she overdubs her thrillingly ''sui generis'' vision into vibrant life."<ref name="pf"/>

The songs on ''Marry Me'' were written largely when Clark was 18 and 19 years old, and, she says, "represented a more idealized version of what life was or what love was or anything in the eyes of someone who hadn't really experienced anything."<ref name="west"/> The album yielded one single, "Paris Is Burning", and a music video was produced for "Jesus Saves, I Spend".

===2008–2010: ''Actor'' and soundtracks===
In 2008, Clark was nominated for three [[PLUG Independent Music Awards]]: New Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and Music Video of the Year. On March 6, 2008, she won the PLUG Female Artist of the Year award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugawards.com/general_vote.php|title=2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards nominees|access-date=February 24, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221190502/http://www.plugawards.com/general_vote.php|archive-date=February 21, 2008}}</ref>

In 2008, after returning to New York from a lengthy tour, Clark began working on her second album. Her inspiration reportedly came from several films, including [[Disney]] movies: "Well, the truth is that I had come back from a pretty long — you know, about a year-and-a-half of touring, and so my brain was sort of all circuit boards that were a little bit fried", Clark said. "So I started watching films as sort of a way to get back into being human. And then it started to just really inform the entire record."<ref>{{cite interview|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104499182|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|title=All Things Considered: Annie Clark, shredding to The Wizard of Oz|year=2009|subject=St. Vincent}}</ref>

Clark, who did not have a studio at the time, began writing the album in her apartment on her computer using [[GarageBand]] and [[MIDI]], because she had gotten noise complaints from neighbors.<ref name="Popcorn Youth">{{cite web|url=http://www.ithacatimesartsblog.com/interview-with-gregg-gillis-of-girl-talk/st-vincent-and-her-mutant-sounds-an-interview-with-annie-clark/|title=St. Vincent and Her Mutant Sounds: An interview with Annie Clark|access-date=November 19, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023084918/http://www.ithacatimesartsblog.com/interview-with-gregg-gillis-of-girl-talk/st-vincent-and-her-mutant-sounds-an-interview-with-annie-clark|archive-date=October 23, 2010}}</ref> The songs were inspired largely by scenes from various children's films. Clark said she imagined soundtracks for certain scenes in films when writing the music and lyrics,<ref name="Popcorn Youth"/> including scenes in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' (1937) and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).

''Actor'' charted well for an independent release, peaking at No. 9 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Independent Albums Chart]], No. 5 on the Tastemaker Albums Chart,<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=st. vincent|chart=Alternative Albums}}|work=Billboard|title=St. Vincent Album & Song Chart History}}</ref> and No. 90 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Although it spawned no singles (except in the UK, where "Actor Out Of Work" was issued as a 7" vinyl single), music videos for "Marrow" and "Actor Out of Work" were released, and aired on several music channels. A promotional music video for "Laughing With a Mouth of Blood", featuring ''[[Portlandia (TV series)|Portlandia]]'''s [[Fred Armisen]] and [[Carrie Brownstein]] (then of ThunderAnt), was also filmed.

Two soundtracks for ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' have featured Clark's songs. "Roslyn", in collaboration with [[Bon Iver]], appeared on the 2009 soundtrack of ''[[The Twilight Saga: New Moon (soundtrack)|New Moon]]''; and "The Antidote" was written for and appeared on 2012's ''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (soundtrack)|Breaking Dawn – Part 2]]''.

In November 2010, Clark appeared with American rappers [[Kid Cudi]] and [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]] on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon|Late Night with Jimmy]] Fallon.'' They performed "Maniac" from Cudi's ''[[Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager]]'', which prominently samples "The Strangers", the opening song on ''Actor''.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Walter |last=Frazier |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/951744/kid-cudi-performs-with-st-vincent-cage-on-jimmy-fallon |title=Kid Cudi Performs With St. Vincent, Cage on 'Jimmy Fallon' |magazine=Billboard |date=November 4, 2010 |access-date=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

===2011–2012: ''Strange Mercy'' and collaborations===
[[File:St. Vincent in Dublin.JPG|thumb|St. Vincent performing at The Button Factory, Dublin in November 2011]]
Clark spent much of her time in [[Seattle]] writing her third album, ''[[Strange Mercy]]'', in October 2010. In an interview with [[Julie Klausner]] for [[Spin Magazine]], she recalled: "[Death Cab for Cutie drummer] [[Jason McGerr]] had an office that was closing. He offered me the space for a month, for all of October. I was alone. I stayed at the Ace Hotel downtown, in one of the rooms with a shared bathroom. I would just get up in the morning and caffeinate, and run, and go to the studio for 12 hours, come back, eat dinner alone with a book, have a glass of wine, and go to bed. And do it all over again."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.spin.com/articles/style-issue-st-vincent/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150118161140/http://m.spin.com/articles/style-issue-st-vincent/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 18, 2015 |title=The Style Issue: St. Vincent |work=Spin |date=August 14, 2011 |access-date=January 14, 2015 }}</ref>

[[David Byrne]], with whom she collaborated and toured, said of her: <blockquote>"Despite having toured with her for almost a year, I don't think I know her much better, at least not on a personal level... Mystery is not a bad thing for a beautiful, talented young woman (or man) to embrace.

When asked during a 2014 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' whether she identified as gay or straight, Clark responded: <blockquote>"I don't think about those words. I believe in gender fluidity and sexual fluidity. I don't really identify as anything. I think you can fall in love with anybody. I don't have anything to hide but I'd rather the emphasis be on music."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Dream World of St. Vincent |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-dream-world-of-st-vincent-20140623 |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=June 23, 2014 |access-date=2014-07-02}}</ref></blockquote>

Later that year, in an interview with the UK's ''[[Sunday Times]]'', she elaborated: <blockquote>"I'm not one for gender or sexual absolutism in the main; I fully support and engage in [[Human sexuality spectrum|the spectrum]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article1471087.ece |date=October 19, 2014 |newspaper=The Sunday Times |title=St. Vincent: Start making sense |first=Louis |last=Wise |access-date=2015-02-17}}</ref></blockquote>

David Gordon controlled and manipulated the stock of two [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] companies, Deep Rock Oil & Gas Inc. and Global Beverage Solutions Inc., and that of [[Glen Ellyn, Illinois]]-based National Storm Management Group Inc. The Justice Department said: "According to evidence presented at trial, Gordon and Clark executed the scheme by obtaining a majority of the free-trading shares of stock they intended to manipulate, using fraudulent and deceptive means to acquire the stock and/or remove the trading restrictions on the shares they obtained." On October 29, 2010 he was sentenced to 15 years, 8 months in prison.<ref name="auto"/> The album ''Daddy's Home'' was in part inspired by her father's eventual release.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last1=Ehrlich|first1=Brenna|date=2021-03-04|title=St. Vincent's Family Ties|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/st-vincent-daddys-home-interview-1136037/|access-date=2021-05-17|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>
