'''Joseph Fidler Walsh''' (born November 20, 1947)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joewalsh.com/about|title=about: Joe Walsh|website=JoeWalsh.com|access-date=March 5, 2016}}</ref> is an American [[rock music|rock]] guitarist, singer, and songwriter. In a career spanning more than 50 years, he has been a member of three successful rock bands: [[James Gang]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. Walsh was also part of the New Zealand band [[Herbs (band)|Herbs]]. In the 1990s, he was a member of the short-lived [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Best (band)|The Best]].

Walsh has also experienced success both as a solo artist and as a prolific [[session musician]], being featured on a wide array of other artists' recordings. In 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at the No. 54 spot on its list of "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".<ref name="100 greatest">{{citation |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/joe-walsh-20111122|title=100 Greatest Guitarists: Joe Walsh|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=January 15, 2013}}</ref>

In the mid-1960s, after attending [[Kent State University]], Walsh played with several local Ohio-based bands before reaching a national audience as a member of the [[James Gang]], whose hit song "[[Funk 49|Funk #49]]" highlighted his skill as both a guitarist and singer. Roger Abramson, a concert producer and artist manager, signed the James Gang to a management agreement with BPI in Cleveland. After leaving the James Gang in 1972, he formed [[Barnstorm (band)|Barnstorm]] with [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]], a college friend from Ohio, and [[Kenny Passarelli]], a bassist from Colorado, where Walsh had moved after leaving Ohio. While the band stayed together for three albums over three years, its works were marketed as Walsh solo projects. The last Barnstorm album, 1974's ''[[So What (Joe Walsh album)|So What]]'' contained significant guest contributions from several members of the Eagles, a group that had recently hired Walsh's producer, [[Bill Szymczyk]].

At Szymczyk's suggestion, Walsh joined the Eagles in 1975 as the band's guitarist and keyboardist following the departure of their founding member [[Bernie Leadon]], with ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' being his first album with the band.<ref>Felder, Don; Holden, Wendy (2008).

Besides his work with his several bands, he has released twelve solo [[studio album]]s, six [[compilation album]]s and two [[live album]]s. His solo hits include "[[Rocky Mountain Way (song)|Rocky Mountain Way]]", "[[Life's Been Good]]", "[[All Night Long (Joe Walsh song)|All Night Long]]", "[[A Life of Illusion]]" and "[[Ordinary Average Guy]]".

As a member of the Eagles, Walsh was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998, and into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2001. The Eagles are considered to be one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, and they remain one of the best-selling American bands in the history of popular music.<ref>{{citation |url=http://joewalsh.com/about|title=About Joe Walsh|publisher=JoeWalsh.com|access-date=May 1, 2014}}</ref> His creative contribution to music has received praise from many of the best rock guitarists, including [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[Jimmy Page]], who said, "He has a tremendous feel for the instrument.

==Early life and education==
Joseph Fidler Walsh was born on November 20, 1947, in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. His father, Lt. Robert Newton Fidler, was a flight instructor for the [[Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star]] in the [[United States Air Force]] and died in a plane crash in [[Okinawa]] on 22 July 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/50329006/robert-newton-fidler |title=Robert Newton Fidler |work=Find A Grave |access-date=7 February 2021}}</ref> Walsh's mother was a classically trained pianist of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Germans|German]] ancestry. Walsh was adopted by his stepfather at the age of five and given his stepfather's surname, but retained Fidler as his middle name. In the 1950s, it was common practice for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], school registration, and health records for children to take the name of their stepfather.<ref>{{cite interview |title=Joe Walsh|url=http://www.joewalshonline.com/downloads/multimediafunstuffaudio.htm|interviewer=Dahl, Steve|type=Interview: audio|work=Morning Show|year=2008}}</ref>

Walsh and his family lived in [[Columbus, Ohio]], for a number of years during his youth. When Walsh was twelve years old, his family moved to New York City. Later, Walsh moved to [[Montclair, New Jersey]], and he attended [[Montclair High School (New Jersey)|Montclair High School]], where he played [[oboe]] in the school band.

Walsh got his first guitar at the age of 10, and upon learning [[The Ventures]]' "[[Walk, Don't Run (instrumental)|Walk Don't Run]]", decided that he wanted to pursue a career as a guitarist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matera |first1=Joe |title=Joe Walsh: "You Have to Play in Front of People; Even if You Suck at It at First, You Have to Do It" |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gw-archive/joe-walsh-you-have-go-out-and-play-front-people-even-if-you-suck-it-first-you-have-do-it |website=Guitar World |access-date=4 April 2019 |language=en |date=20 November 2015}}</ref> Inspired by the success of [[the Beatles]], he replaced Bruce Hoffman as the bass player in the locally popular group, the Nomads in [[Madison, New Jersey]], beginning his career as a rock musician. After high school, Walsh attended [[Kent State University]], where he spent time in various bands playing around the [[Cleveland]] area, including the Measles. The Measles recorded for [[Super K Productions]]' [[Ohio Express]] the songs "I Find I Think of You", "And It's True", and "Maybe" (an instrumental version of "And It's True"). Walsh majored in English and minored in music; he was present during the [[Kent State massacre]] in 1970. Walsh commented in 2012: "Being at the shootings really affected me profoundly. I decided that maybe I don't need a degree that bad."<ref name="SDUT" >{{cite news|last1=Varga|first1=George|title=Fact or fiction?

==Musical career==

===1965–1967: The Measles (Joe Walsh years)===
The Measles, an Ohio garage bar band, were formed in 1965 by four [[Kent State University]] students, one of whom was Joe Walsh. Two tracks on the Ohio Express' ''Beg Borrow and Steal'' album, "I Find I Think Of You" and "And It's True" (both featuring Joe Walsh vocals) were actually recorded by the Measles, led by Walsh. Additionally, an instrumental version of "And It's True" was recorded by the Measles, re-titled "Maybe" and released as the B-side of the "Beg Borrow and Steal" single.

===1968–1971: James Gang===
{{Main|James Gang}}
[[File:James Gang.png|thumb|Walsh (left) with the James Gang, 1970]]
Around Christmas 1967, James Gang guitarist [[Glenn Schwartz]], who turned out to be [[AWOL]] from the army and was breaking up with his wife, decided to leave the band to move to California, where he ended up forming the band [[Pacific Gas & Electric (band)|Pacific Gas & Electric]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

Walsh was accepted and the band continued as a five piece for a short time until Phil Giallombardo, who was still in high school at the time, left. Bill Jeric and Walsh worked together on guitar parts, but Jeric left as well in the spring of 1968. He was replaced by a returning Ronnie Silverman, who had been discharged from the military.

In May 1968, the group played a concert in Detroit at the [[Grande Ballroom]], opening for [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. At the last minute, Silverman told the others that he would not join them at the show. The band, desperately in need of the money, took to the stage as a trio. They liked their sound as a threesome and decided to remain that way.

In 1968, the band signed with manager Mark Barger, who was handling the career of fellow Ohio outfit [[the Lemon Pipers]], who had just scored a big hit with "[[Green Tambourine]]." Barger put the Gang in touch with [[ABC Records]] staff producer [[Bill Szymczyk]], who signed them to ABC's new [[Bluesway Records]] subsidiary in January 1969.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

They released their debut album, ''[[Yer' Album]]'', in 1969. In November 1969, bassist Tom Kriss decided he was no longer into the music and left to be replaced by Dale Peters, who was brought in from a group called The Case of E.T. Hooley. The addition of Peters created the most successful incarnation of the James Gang. Walsh proved to be the band's star attraction, noted for his innovative rhythm playing and creative guitar riffs. In particular he was known for hot-wiring the pick-ups on his electric guitars to create his trademark "attack" sound.<ref>{{citation |author=Charlesworth, Chris|title=A-Z of Rock Guitarists|year=1982|page=92}}</ref> The James Gang had several minor hits and became an early [[album-oriented rock]] staple for the next two years. It was during 1969 that Walsh sold his Les Paul Guitar to [[Jimmy Page]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/forgotten-guitar-jimmy-page-offers-close-look-his-number-1-les-paul|title=Forgotten Guitar: Jimmy Page Offers an Up-Close Look at His "Number 1" Les Paul|author=Jonathan Graham|website=Guitarworld|access-date=September 27, 2019}}</ref> Later in 1969, the group's record producer, Szymczyk, arranged for the band to appear in the "electric Western" film ''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'', with two James Gang songs, "Laguna Salada" and "Country Fever," also being used. For the recording of these two songs, vocalist Kenny Weiss was brought in to allow Walsh to focus on his guitar playing; he was gone by the time the group arrived in Mexico to shoot their movie scenes. "Laguna Salada" and "Country Fever" later reappeared as bonus tracks on the 2000 re-release of ''The James Gang Greatest Hits''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/the-james-gang-greatest-hits/id316854721 |title=iTunes - Music - The James Gang Greatest Hits by James Gang |publisher=iTunes Store |date=May 2, 2000 |access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref>

Shortly before the release of their second album ''[[James Gang Rides Again]]'', the James Gang opened a show for [[the Who]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. Their guitarist [[Pete Townshend]] met with the James Gang before they left and was impressed enough to invite them on the Who's subsequent European tour. When Walsh was asked about this he said that, "Pete's a very melodic player and so am I. He told me that he appreciated my playing. I was flattered beyond belief because I didn't think I was that good."<ref name="www.theuncool.com"/>

The James Gang's next two albums, ''James Gang Rides Again'' (1970) and ''[[Thirds (album)|Thirds]]'' (1971), produced such classics as "Funk #49" and "Walk Away". The album ''James Gang Live at Carnegie Hall'' was Walsh's last album with them, as he became dissatisfied with the band's limitations.

The two remaining members, Peters and Fox, carried on with the lead vocalist [[Roy Kenner]] and guitarist [[Domenic Troiano]] (both ex-members of the Canadian band [[Bush (Canadian band)|Bush]]) for two albums, ''[[Straight Shooter (James Gang album)|Straight Shooter]]'' and ''[[Passin' Thru (James Gang album)|Passin' Thru]]'', both released in 1972. But in recent interviews, Fox stated that things did not work out musically with Troiano as hoped, so he left the band in 1973 and joined [[the Guess Who]].

===1971–1973: Barnstorm===
In December 1971, Walsh left the James Gang. [[Steve Marriott]], frontman guitarist of [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]], invited him to move to England and join his band, which [[Peter Frampton]] had left, but Walsh declined.<ref name="www.theuncool.com"/> Instead he moved to Colorado and formed a band called [[Barnstorm (band)|Barnstorm]], with drummer and multi-instrumentalist [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]], and bassist [[Kenny Passarelli]], although both of their albums credited Walsh as a solo artist. They started recording their debut album immediately after forming, but at the time there were only Walsh and Vitale on these sessions. [[Chuck Rainey]] did the first bass tracks on the album but these were soon replaced by Passarelli. Walsh and Barnstorm released their debut album, the eponymous ''[[Barnstorm (album)|Barnstorm]]'', in October 1972. After taking a cue from Townshend, Walsh utilized the [[ARP Odyssey]] [[synthesizer]] to great effect on such songs as "Mother Says" and "Here We Go". Walsh also experimented with [[acoustic guitar]], [[slide guitar]], [[effects pedals]], [[fuzzbox]], [[talk box]], and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] as well as running his guitar straight into a [[Leslie speaker]] 122 to get swirly, organ-like guitar tones. The album was a critical success, but had only moderate commercial success. The follow-up, ''[[The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get]]'', released in June 1973, was marketed under Walsh's name (although officially a Barnstorm album) and was their commercial breakthrough. It peaked at No. 6 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart. The first and leading single, "[[Rocky Mountain Way (song)|Rocky Mountain Way]]", received heavy airplay and reached No. 23 on the US Top 40 chart.<ref>{{cite web |title= Song: Rocky Mountain Way by Joe Walsh|url=http://www.songplaces.com/Rocky_Mountain_Way/Caribou_Ranch_Nederland_Colorado |publisher=Songplaces.com |access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> It featured new member, keyboardist Rocke Grace, and Walsh shared the vocals and songwriting with the other three members of the band. As a result, a variety of styles are explored on this album. There are elements of blues, jazz, folk, pop, and Caribbean music. In 1974, Barnstorm disbanded and Walsh continued as a solo artist.<ref>{{citation|url=http://cmhof.org/events/dan-fogelberg-joe-walsh-barnstorm-caribou-ranch|title=Dan Fogelberg, Joe Walsh & Barnstorm, Caribou Ranch|publisher=Colorado Music Hall of Fame|access-date=May 18, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518211730/http://cmhof.org/events/dan-fogelberg-joe-walsh-barnstorm-caribou-ranch|archive-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref>

In late 1974, Walsh played slide guitar on Vitale's debut solo album ''[[Roller Coaster Weekend]]''. Walsh was taught the slide technique by [[Duane Allman]], who played on [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Layla]] of [[Derek and the Dominos]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/lessons/joe-walsh-teaches-duane-allman-slide-method-he-learned-it-man-himself"| publisher=Guitar World|title=Joe Walsh learns slide guitar from Duane Allman}}</ref>

[[File:Joe Walsh 4 - 1975.jpg|thumb|250px|Walsh playing slide guitar with a [[Gibson Les Paul Special]], 1975]]

===1975–1980: Eagles===
In 1975, Walsh was invited to join [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]] as founding member [[Bernie Leadon]]'s replacement. There was some initial concern as to Walsh's ability to fit in with the band, as he was considered far too "wild" for The Eagles, especially by their drummer and co-lead vocalist, [[Don Henley]].<ref>{{citation |last1=Felder|first1=Don|last2=Holden|first2=Wendy|title=Heaven and Hell: My Life in The Eagles (1974–2001)|year=2009|page=153}}</ref>

Released on December 8, 1976, ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' was the band's fifth studio album and the first to feature Walsh. The album took a year and a half to complete, a process which, along with touring, drained the band.

The second single from the album was the eponymous [[Hotel California|title track]], which topped the charts in May 1977 and became one of the Eagles' signature songs next to "[[Take It Easy]]" and "[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]". It features Henley on lead vocals, with a guitar duet performed by Felder and Walsh.

The hard rock "[[Life in the Fast Lane]]", released on May 3, 1977, was based on a riff by Walsh. It reached No. 11 on the charts and helped establish Walsh's position in the band.

''Hotel California'' is the last album to feature founding member [[Randy Meisner]], who abruptly left the band after the 1977 tour. He was replaced by the same musician who had succeeded him in [[Poco]], [[Timothy B. Schmit]].{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=190}}

In 1977, the band, minus Don Felder, performed instrumental work and backing vocals for [[Randy Newman]]'s album ''[[Little Criminals]],'' including "[[Short People]]," which has backing vocals by Frey and Schmit.

The Eagles went into the recording studio in 1977 to begin work on their next album, ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]].'' The album took two years to complete. ''The Long Run'' was released on September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some music critics for failing to live up to ''Hotel California,'' it proved a huge commercial hit nonetheless; the album topped the charts and sold 7 million copies. In addition, it included three Top 10 singles—"[[Heartache Tonight]]", the [[The Long Run (song)|title track]] and "[[I Can't Tell You Why]]". "[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In The City]]" by Walsh also received considerable airplay. The band also recorded two Christmas songs during these sessions, "Funky New Year"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iloveclassicrock.com/its-not-a-party-til-the-eagles-come-knocking-with-the-ultra-fun-funky-new-year/|title=It's Not A Party Til The Eagles Come Knocking With The Ultra Fun "Funky New Year"|website=Iloveclassicrock.com|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref> and "[[Please Come Home for Christmas,#Eagles versin|Please Come Home for Christmas]]" which was released as a single in 1978 and reached No. 18 on the charts. In 1980, the band broke up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eagles-all-night-long-final-show-1980-split-1031861/|title=Flashback: The Eagles Play 'All Night Long' at Final Show Before 1980 Split|first=Andy|last=Greene|website=Rollingstone.com|date=July 21, 2020|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref>

===1973–2012: solo career===
[[File:JoeWalshSept06.jpg|thumb|left|Walsh performing live at [[Gulfstream Park]] in [[Hallandale Beach, Florida]], September 2006]]
Walsh has released twelve solo studio albums.

In December 1974, Walsh released his first solo album that was not considered a Barnstorm project, ''[[So What (Joe Walsh album)|So What]]'', which contained more introspective material such as "Help Me Through the Night" and "Song For Emma", a tribute to Walsh's daughter who had been killed in a car accident that April. On a few tracks, [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]] and [[Randy Meisner]] of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] contributed backing vocals.

In March 1976, Walsh released a live album, ''[[You Can't Argue with a Sick Mind]]'', which also featured the Eagles.

As the Eagles struggled to record their follow-up to ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'', Walsh re-ignited his solo career with the critically well-received album, ''[[But Seriously, Folks...]]'' in May 1978. It contained the single "[[Life's Been Good]]", his comedic depiction of rock stardom, which peaked at No. 12 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5785/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=Joe Walsh > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles |publisher=[[AllMusic]]  |access-date=January 29, 2010}}</ref> and remains to date his biggest solo hit. Walsh also contributed "[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In the City]]" to ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'' soundtrack in 1979, a song penned and sung by Walsh that was later rerecorded for the Eagles' studio album, ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1998 |page=348}}</ref>

Following the break up of the Eagles in July 1980, Walsh continued to release solo albums throughout the 1980s, but sales did not meet the same level of his earlier successes.<ref name=Gibson>{{citation |url=http://www.edroman.com/guitars/gibson/gibson%20guitar%20models/joe%20walsh.html|title=Gibson Joe Walsh Les Paul|publisher=Ed Roman Guitars|access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref>

''[[There Goes the Neighborhood (album)|There Goes the Neighborhood]]'' was Walsh's first album since the demise of the Eagles, and it peaked at No. 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The album only spawned one single, "A Life of Illusion", which became one of Walsh's most popular songs. The single also topped the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, in 1981.

"A Life of Illusion" was recorded in 1973 with Walsh's first solo band Barnstorm but was not completed. The overdubs and final mixes were completed during the ''There Goes the Neighborhood'' sessions and released on the album. The promotional video for the track shows the making of the album's cover. This song also appeared in the opening credits of ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' and appears as the first song on its soundtrack.

In May 1983, Walsh released ''[[You Bought It – You Name It]]''; the album was received negatively by the majority of music critics, while other reviewers noted good points to the album. It was also not as successful as Walsh's previous albums, peaking at No. 48 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Walsh found moderate success with the single "[[Space Age Whiz Kids (song)|Space Age Whiz Kids]]", about the pinnacle of the 1980s video arcade craze. The album contains hard rock songs such as "I Can Play That Rock & Roll" and a cover of the [[Dick Haymes]] track, "[[Love Letters (song)|Love Letters]]". It also contains more introspective material such as "Class of '65", and contains a song titled "I.L.B.T.s", an acronym for "I Like Big Tits".

Walsh's new girlfriend [[Stevie Nicks]] was involved in his next album, ''[[The Confessor (album)|The Confessor]]''. Her old friend [[Keith Olsen]] was hired to produce the album and the musicians were prolific [[Los Angeles|LA]] session musicians including: [[Jim Keltner]], [[Mike Porcaro]], [[Waddy Wachtel]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Alan Pasqua]] and many other musicians that Walsh had never worked with before.<ref name="nysse.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nysse.com/jw/anthology.html|title=Joe Walsh Pictures|publisher=The Not Official Joe Walsh Page}}</ref>

In 1987, Walsh released his final solo album of the 1980s, ''[[Got Any Gum?]]'', which was produced by [[Terry Manning]], and features vocal contributions from [[J. D. Souther]] and [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]]'s lead vocalist [[Jimi Jamison]], but the album was a commercial disappointment.

In 1991, ''[[Ordinary Average Guy]]'', his ninth solo studio album, and its title track single, were released on the [[Epic Records|Epic]] label. The album features [[Ringo Starr]], Jimi Jamison, and drummer Joe Vitale from Walsh's former band Barnstorm. Vitale also sings the lead vocals on the final track of the album, "School Days".

In 1992, Walsh released what appeared to be his final album (until 2012), ''[[Songs for a Dying Planet]]'', his tenth solo studio album. Like its predecessor, it was released on the Epic label. Keen to re-establish himself after receiving some poor reviews for his previous album, Walsh enlisted his former producer Bill Szymczyk. At the end of the track "Certain Situations" you can hear a Morse code message that says "Register and vote for me". His song "Vote for Me" was a minor success, peaking at No. 10 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.

Walsh's song "One Day at a Time" was released in 2012 and details his struggles with alcohol and drug abuse earlier in his career. The song appeared on Walsh's album ''[[Analog Man (album)|Analog Man]]'', which was released on June 5, 2012. The album was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]], with [[Tommy Lee James]] co-writing some of the album's tracks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/joe-walsh-to-release-analog-man-on-june-5/9972169 |title=Joe Walsh to release Analog Man on 5 June|publisher=Artist Direct|date=March 26, 2012 |access-date=May 1, 2014}}</ref>

===Eagles reunion===
[[File:Eagles (1).jpg|thumb|Walsh performing with the Eagles, 2008]]
An Eagles country tribute album titled ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]'' was released in 1993, thirteen years after the break up. [[Travis Tritt]] insisted on having the ''Long Run''-era Eagles in his video for "Take It Easy" and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The line-up comprised the five ''Long Run''-era members—Frey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit—supplemented by [[Scott F. Crago|Scott Crago]] (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), [[Timothy Drury]] (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals) and Al Garth (saxophone, violin) on stage.

"For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation," announced Frey at their first live performance in April 1994. The ensuing tour spawned a live album titled ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'' (named for Henley's recurring statement that the band would get back together "when hell freezes over"), which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart. It included four new studio songs, with "[[Get Over It (Eagles song)|Get Over It]]" and "[[Love Will Keep Us Alive]]" both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved as successful as the tour, selling 6 million copies in the U.S. The tour was interrupted in September 1994 because of Frey's serious recurrence of [[diverticulitis]], but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm|title=The Great Gastro-Intestinal Saga of Glenn Frey (1994–95)|access-date=November 2, 2014|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011185039/http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm|archive-date=October 11, 2007}}.

For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Leadon, Meisner, Felder, Walsh, and Schmit) played together for two songs, "Take It Easy" and "Hotel California". Several subsequent reunion tours followed (without Leadon or Meisner), notable for their record-setting ticket prices.<ref name="Fans">{{cite news|first=Lucy|last=Cockcroft|title=Eagles fans forced to pay £1,000 per ticket|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1565979/Eagles-fans-forced-to-pay-andpound1,000-per-ticket.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505051711/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1565979/Eagles-fans-forced-to-pay-andpound1,000-per-ticket.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 5, 2013|date=October 12, 2007|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=September 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Music/The-price-of-fame/2004/12/03/1101923322669.html|title=The price of fame|date=December 4, 2004|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=September 19, 2008}}</ref>

The Eagles performed at the [[Mandalay Bay Events Center]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]] on December 28 and 29, 1999, followed by a concert at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles on December 31. These concerts marked the last time Felder played with the band and these shows (including a planned video release) later formed a part of a lawsuit filed by Felder against his former band members.

The concert recordings were released on CD as part of the four-disc ''[[Selected Works: 1972–1999]]'' box set in November 2000. Along with the millennium concert, this set included the band's hit singles, album tracks and outtakes from ''The Long Run'' sessions. ''Selected Works'' received [[platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Eagles#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - Eagles|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref>

The band resumed touring in 2001, with a line-up consisting of Frey, Henley, Walsh and Schmit, along with [[Steuart Smith]] (guitars, mandolin, keyboards, backing vocals; essentially taking over Felder's role), Michael Thompson (keyboards, trombone), Will Hollis (keyboards, backing vocals), [[Scott F. Crago|Scott Crago]] (drums, percussion), Bill Armstrong (horns), Al Garth (saxophone, violin), Christian Mostert (saxophone) and Greg Smith (saxophone, percussion).

In 2003, the Eagles released a greatest hits album, ''[[The Very Best Of (Eagles album)|The Very Best Of]].''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-2003-mw0002114338 |first= Stephen Thomas |last= Erlewine |author-link= Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title= Eagles – The Very Best Of [2003] |publisher= AllMusic. All Media Network |access-date= August 14, 2014}}</ref> The two-disc compilation was the first that encompassed their entire career, from ''Eagles'' to ''Hell Freezes Over.'' It debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard charts and eventually gained triple platinum status. The album includes a new single, the [[September 11 attacks]]-themed "[[Hole in the World]]". Also in 2003, [[Warren Zevon]], a longtime Eagles friend, began work on his final album, ''[[The Wind (Warren Zevon album)|The Wind]],'' with the assistance of Henley, Walsh and Schmit.

On June 14, 2005, the Eagles released a new 2-DVD set titled ''[[Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne]],'' featuring two new songs: Frey's "No More Cloudy Days" and Walsh's "One Day at a Time". A special edition 2006 release exclusive to [[Walmart]] and affiliated stores includes a bonus audio CD with three new songs: a studio version of "No More Cloudy Days", "Fast Company" and "Do Something".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therockradio.com/2006/12/eagles-package-new-music-with.html|title=The Eagles package new music with Australian DVD|access-date=November 2, 2014|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721190300/http://www.therockradio.com/2006/12/eagles-package-new-music-with.html|archive-date=July 21, 2011}}.

In 2007, the Eagles consisted of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit. On August 20, 2007, "[[How Long (J. D. Souther song)|How Long]]", written by [[J. D. Souther]], was released as a single to radio with an accompanying online video at [[Yahoo! Music]]. It debuted on television on [[Country Music Television]] during the [[Top 20 Countdown]] on August 23, 2007. The band had performed the song as part of their live sets in the early to mid-1970s, but did not record it at the time because Souther wanted to reserve it for use on his first solo album. Souther had previously worked with the Eagles, co-writing some of their biggest hits, including "Best of My Love", "Victim of Love", "Heartache Tonight" and "New Kid in Town".

On October 30, 2007, the Eagles released ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]],'' their first album of all-new material since 1979. For the first year after the album's release, it was available in the U.S. only via the band's website, at Walmart and at Sam's Club stores.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/don-henley-talks-new-eagles-lp-20070813|title=Don Henley Talks New Eagles LP|work=Rolling Stone|date= August 13, 2007|access-date= July 14, 2014}}</ref> It was commercially available through traditional retail outlets in other countries.

On March 20, 2008, the Eagles launched their world tour in support of ''Long Road Out of Eden'' at [[The O2 Arena]] in London. The [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]] concluded the American portion of the tour at [[Rio Tinto Stadium]] in [[Sandy, Utah]] on May 9, 2009. It was the first concert ever held in the new soccer stadium. The tour traveled to Europe, with its final concert date on July 22, 2009, in [[Lisbon]]. The band spent the summer of 2010 touring North American stadiums with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Keith Urban]]. The tour expanded to England as the headline act of the [[Hop Farm Festival]] on July 1, 2011.

Asked in November 2010 whether the Eagles were planning a follow-up to ''Long Road Out of Eden,'' Schmit replied, "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity and you never know what's going to happen. It took a long time to do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again.

===Other bands===
In late 1984, Walsh was contacted by Australian musician [[Paul Christie (Australian musician)|Paul Christie]], the former bassist for [[Mondo Rock]]. Christie invited him to come to Australia to perform with [[the Party Boys]], an all-star band with a floating membership of well-known Australian rock musicians. These included the critically acclaimed guitarist [[Kevin Borich]], with whom Walsh became good friends. Walsh accepted and performed with the Party Boys on their late-1984–early-1985 Australian tour and appeared on their live album, ''[[You Need Professional Help]]''. He remained in Australia for some time after the tour, putting together the short-lived touring band "Creatures From America", with [[Waddy Wachtel]] (guitar), [[Rick Rosas]] (bass guitar) and Australian drummer [[Richard Harvey]] ([[Divinyls]], the Party Boys)<ref name=Gibson /> In 1987, Walsh returned to the United States to work on his album ''[[Got Any Gum?]]'', which was produced by [[Terry Manning]] and features vocal contributions from [[J. D. Souther]] and [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]]'s lead singer [[Jimi Jamison]]. After the album's commercial disappointment, Walsh decided to return to Australia in 1989 to tour with another incarnation of the Party Boys. Walsh also toured with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]] in 1989 and 1992, alternating a handful of his best-known songs with Starr's and tunes by other of the members of the All-Starr Band.<ref name=Starr>{{citation |url=http://wzlx.cbslocal.com/2012/07/27/joe-walsh-ringo-starr-bandmates-brothers-in-law|title=Joe Walsh & Ringo Starr: Bandmates, Brothers-In-Law|publisher=WZLX|date=July 27, 2012|access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> In 1989, Walsh recorded a ''[[MTV Unplugged (Joe Walsh)|MTV Unplugged]]'' with the [[R&B music]]ian [[Dr. John]].

Although he had left by the time of its 1990 release, he still appears as lead singer on two tracks, "Up All Night" and "It's Alright". The album includes the first recording of his "Ordinary Average Guys" (sung by late Herbs bassist [[Charlie Tumahai]]), which subsequently became a solo hit for Walsh as "[[Ordinary Average Guy]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glenmoffatt.com/herbs_history.htm |title=Herbs History |publisher=[[Glen Moffatt]] |access-date=September 15, 2011}}</ref>

In 1998, [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] wanted to use a classic rock song rock for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' that year, so they asked Walsh to rewrite the lyrics to "Rocky Mountain Way" for the quarterback [[John Elway]] of the [[Denver Broncos]]. "Rocky Mountain Elway" was the new title of the song and Walsh appeared in a video that ABC showed on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''.

===2000s and 2010s===

Walsh had often joked about running for office, announcing a mock presidential campaign in 1980 and a vice presidential campaign in 1992. Walsh ran for President of the United States in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], promising to make "[[Life's Been Good]]" the new national anthem if he won, and ran on a platform of "Free [[Gasoline|Gas]] For Everyone".<ref>{{citation|title=Joe Walsh: Featured Artist|url=http://www.lastfm.com.br/group/Classic+Rock/forum/14969/_/458069|publisher=last.fm|access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref> Though Walsh was only 32 at the time of the election and thus would not have met the 35-year-old requirement to actually assume office, he said that he wanted to raise public awareness of the election.<ref>{{citation|title=Artistfacts for Joe Walsh|url=http://www.songfacts.com/facts-joe_walsh.php|publisher=Songfacts|access-date=November 5, 2014}}</ref> In 1992 Walsh ran for vice president with Rev.

In an interview to promote his album ''[[Analog Man (album)|Analog Man]]'' in 2012, Walsh revealed he was considering a serious bid for political office. "I think I would run seriously, and I think I would run for Congress," Walsh told [[WASH (FM)|WASH]] in Washington, D.C. "The root of the problem is that Congress is so dysfunctional. We're dead in the water until Congress gets to work and passes some new legislation to change things."<ref name="Congress" />

In 2017, Walsh contacted others in the music industry, including the [[Zac Brown Band]], [[Gary Clark Jr.]], and [[Keith Urban]], to try to organize and perform what became VetsAid<ref>{{citation|title=Joe Walsh's VetsAid Concert|url=http://www.vetsaid.org|access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref> – a concert series along the lines of the [[Farm Aid]] program spearheaded by country entertainer [[Willie Nelson]].

Walsh's eldest daughter, Emma Kristen, was born in 1971 and died in 1974 at 3 years of age as a result of injuries suffered in an automobile accident on her way to nursery school. Her story inspired the track "Song for Emma" on Walsh's solo album ''[[So What (Joe Walsh album)|So What]]'' released later that year. In her memory, he had a fountain and memorial plaque placed in a park in which she played: North Boulder Park in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. He has said that the album name ''So What'' was a result of Emma's death: that nothing else seemed meaningful or important in the months that followed. The strain eventually contributed to Walsh's divorce from his second wife Stefany.<ref name="Joe Walsh Biography"/><ref>{{citation|author=Taylor, Carol|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/features/ci_16348612| title=Emma's fountain lives long after rock 'n' roll tragedy|date=October 24, 2010|work=Daily Camera|location=Boulder, Colorado|access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> While touring with singer [[Stevie Nicks]] in 1984, Walsh took Nicks to the park's fountain; Nicks subsequently immortalized this story in her song "[[Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?]]" on her 1985 album ''[[Rock A Little]]''. Nicks told the UK's ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2007 that Walsh had been "the great love of my life".<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html|title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story|work=The Telegraph|access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> "Joe and I broke up because of the [[Cocaine|coke]]," she elaborated to ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''.
