==Career==
The Longest Johns formed in June 2012 after first singing together at a friend's barbecue.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/sea-shanty-tiktok-wellerman-story-4898364 |title=Bristol band behind viral phenomenon Sea Shanty TikTok |last=Cork |first=Tristan |date=2021-01-18 |website=BristolLive |access-date=2021-03-08 }}</ref> The original line up consisted of Josh Bowker, Andy Yates, Jonathan Darley and Dave Robinson. About a week later, they posted their first video on [[YouTube]], singing "Haul Away Joe."

The band recorded their first [[Extended play|EP]], ''Bones in the Ocean'' in 2013, which was wholly original music. It was released on May 27, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bones in the Ocean, by The Longest Johns|url=https://thelongestjohns.bandcamp.com/album/bones-in-the-ocean|access-date=2021-03-08|website=The Longest Johns}}</ref> The band released their second EP, ''Christmas at Sea'', later that same year, on December 2, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Christmas at Sea, by The Longest Johns|url=https://thelongestjohns.bandcamp.com/album/christmas-at-sea|access-date=2021-03-08|website=The Longest Johns}}</ref>

In 2015, Bowker was forced away from the band for the birth of his daughter, causing him to miss the 2015 Falmouth International Sea Shanty Festival. Robbie Sattin joined the band as a replacement, and the band later announced that he would be officially joining the band.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

The band released their first full-length album, ''Written in Salt'', on June 18, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Written in Salt, by The Longest Johns|url=https://thelongestjohns.bandcamp.com/album/written-in-salt|access-date=2021-03-08|website=The Longest Johns}}</ref> Following this release, and amid the band's heightening popularity, Bowker left the band to focus on running his business.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

In November 2017, the band announced via [[Facebook]] that Anna Cornish would become the first female member of the band, having been singing with them for several months prior.

In April 2016, the band began recording their second studio album. The title of the album was later announced to be ''Between Wind and Water'', and was released on June 19, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Between Wind and Water, by The Longest Johns|url=https://thelongestjohns.bandcamp.com/album/between-wind-and-water|access-date=2021-03-08|website=The Longest Johns}}</ref>

In October 2019, the band announced that Cornish would be leaving the band to focus on her other band, The Norfolk Broads.

On June 10, 2020, the band released their third studio album, ''Cures What Ails Ya.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cures What Ails Ya, by The Longest Johns|url=https://thelongestjohns.bandcamp.com/album/cures-what-ails-ya|access-date=2021-03-08|website=The Longest Johns}}</ref>

== Recordings ==
The band has self-released three albums and several EPs: EP ''Bones in the Ocean'' (2013), ''Written in Salt'' (2016), ''Between Wind and Water'' (2018), and ''Cures What Ails Ya'' (2020).<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Longest Johns|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/6478747-The-Longest-Johns|access-date=2021-01-17|website=Discogs|language=en}}</ref>

The album includes 15 tracks with traditional songs and original compositions.

''Cures What Ails Ya'' was released in 2020 by the band and includes a mix of traditional tunes and their band's own compositions. In a review Mike Davies stated the band takes a "irreverent and playful approach to the tradition." Tunes such as "Got No Beard" and "Hoist up the Thing" are humorous in nature.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Davies|first=Mike|date=2020-06-12|title=THE LONGEST JOHNS – Cures What Ails Ya (own label)|url=https://folking.com/the-longest-johns-cures-what-ails-ya-own-label/|access-date=2021-01-17|website=Folking.com|language=en-GB}}</ref> Their original tune "Fire and Flame" tells the story of [[Halifax Explosion]], a 1917 maritime disaster which took place in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Davies|first=Mike|date=2020-06-12|title=THE LONGEST JOHNS – Cures What Ails Ya (own label)|url=https://folking.com/the-longest-johns-cures-what-ails-ya-own-label/|access-date=2021-01-17|website=Folking.com|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 2021, the band released ''Land Shanties'' as a partnership with [[Suzuki]] which was described as, "the genre-defining ''Land Shanties'' album—the soundtrack to the [[Suzuki Vitara]]. Capturing all the fun and adventure of the high seas on the highways, ''Land Shanties'' is a concept album following one hero’s quest to buy almond milk for his sweetheart."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Vitara Land Shanties {{!}} Suzuki Australia|url=https://www.suzuki.com.au/vitara/landshanties|access-date=2021-10-08|website=www.suzuki.com.au}}</ref>

The band collaborated with shanty punk band [[Skinny Lister]] on their 2021 single "Damn the Amsterdam".

== TikTok viral trend ==
The Longest Johns found a surge in fame after a sea shanty video went viral on [[TikTok]]. The trend started back in August 2019 when The Longest Johns released a YouTube video of them singing the song "[[Soon May the Wellerman Come|Wellerman]]" as the first episode of their Sea of Thieves series, Open Crewsing. This video was shared around on many online platforms including Reddit, iFunny and Tumblr amassing many millions of views. The song then found a strong following on TikTok, with many users creating memes and popularising the song on the platform. A lot of the success of the song has been attributed to Scottish musician and TikTok user [[Nathan Evans (Scottish musician)|Nathan Evans]] who uploaded a video of himself singing the maritime song, which quickly went viral with the help of other users adding their own contributions through the duet feature on the app.

However, the spark that ignited the worldwide phenomenon happened when two brothers released a TikTok of them listening to The Longest Johns version of the song in a car. This video goes through the emotion of initially not liking the song, but slowly becoming enraptured by it and wanting to join in with the singing. The trend sparked a huge interest in sea shanties, with millions of people discovering The Longest Johns' recording of Wellerman, originally released on their 2018 album ''Between Wind and Water''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bristol band The Longest Johns steer sea shanty craze|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-bristol-55720279|access-date=2021-01-21|website=BBC News|language=en}}</ref> The song has been streamed on [[Spotify]] over 41 million times (as of October 21, 2021).
