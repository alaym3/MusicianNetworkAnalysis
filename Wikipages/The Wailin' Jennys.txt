==History==
The group was founded in 2002, when a [[Winnipeg]] guitar shop called Sled Dog Music brought [[Ruth Moody]], [[Nicky Mehta]] and [[Cara Luft]] together for a joint performance. The show was well received and the owner, John Sharples, scheduled a follow-up performance<ref name="Sled Dog Music">{{cite web|url=http://www.sleddogmusic.com/ |title=Sled Dog Music |publisher=Sled Dog Music |access-date=2011-07-27}}</ref> and suggested they "go on tour and call themselves the Wailin' Jennys."<ref name="A Prairie Home Companion">[http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2005/05/21/guests.shtml Notes the 2005-05-21 episode] of ''A Prairie Home Companion'', viewed 2006-10-10</ref> The group's name is a  [[pun]] on the name of country singer [[Waylon Jennings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewailinjennys.com/article-reviews/2002/08/wailin-jennys-overcome-name-confusion |title=Wailin' Jennys overcome name confusion &#124; The Wailinâ€™ Jennys &#124; Singers / Songwriters |website=Thewailinjennys.com |date=2002-08-14 |access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref>

The band released a self-titled EP and an album, ''40 Days'', in 2004;<ref>[https://www.straight.com/article/folk-fest-wailin-jennys-cara-luft-breaks-folk-fashion-rules "Folk Fest - Wailin' Jennys' Cara Luft Breaks Folk-Fashion Rules"]. ''Georgia Straight'', by Shawn Conner on July 15, 2004</ref>

The group now consists of soprano [[Ruth Moody]], mezzo [[Nicky Mehta]] and alto [[Heather Masse]]. In previous years, the Jennys have also toured with [[fiddler]] and [[mandolinist]] Jeremy Penner, who is from Ruth's former band, [[Scruj MacDuhk]]. Other band members have included [[Annabelle Chvostek]], a singer/songwriter from [[Montreal]], and Ruth Moody's brother Richard on viola and mandolin.  Both Penner and Moody have appeared on The Wailin' Jennys' albums. In 2007, Chvostek left the group and was replaced by [[Heather Masse]], a [[Maine]]-born singer and member of the band Heather & the Barbarians.

The Wailin' Jennys have won two [[Juno Award]]s for [[Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year - Group|Roots and Traditional Album of the Year (Group)]]: in [[Juno Awards of 2005|2005]] for ''[[40 Days]]'' and in [[Juno Awards of 2012|2012]] for ''Bright Morning Stars''.
