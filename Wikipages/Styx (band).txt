'''Styx''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|ɪ|k|s}}) is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from Chicago that formed in 1972 and is best known for melding [[hard rock]] guitar balanced with acoustic guitar, synthesizers mixed with acoustic piano, upbeat tracks with power ballads, and incorporating elements of international musical theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://styxworld.com/|title=Home - Styx World|work=Styx World}}</ref> The band established itself with a [[progressive rock]] sound in the 1970s, and began to incorporate [[pop rock]] and [[soft rock]] elements in the 1980s.

Beginning with ''[[Styx (album)|Styx]]'' in 1972, the band usually released an album every year throughout the 1970s. ''[[Styx II]]'' (1973) had the sleeper hit "[[Lady (Styx song)|Lady]]", a [[power ballad]] which reached No. 6 in the US, helping the album make the top 20. "Lady" was also a top 20 hit in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. ''[[Equinox (Styx album)|Equinox]]'' (1975) and ''[[Crystal Ball (Styx album)|Crystal Ball]]'' (1976) reached the US top 70 with the first featuring "[[Lorelei (Styx song)|Lorelei]]", a No. 6 hit in Canada, while the second marked the addition of Tommy Shaw to the band.

Styx's commercial breakthrough in North America came with ''[[The Grand Illusion (album)|The Grand Illusion]]'' (1977), which peaked at No. 6 in both the US and Canada, and became the first of four straight triple-platinum albums in the US for Styx. It featured the single "[[Come Sail Away]]", a top 10 hit in both countries. The band's follow-up, ''[[Pieces of Eight]]'' (1978), was another No. 6 hit in the US, but peaked higher in Canada due to the top 10 hits "[[Renegade (Styx song)|Renegade]]" and "[[Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)]]". In 1979, Styx's ''[[Cornerstone (Styx album)|Cornerstone]]'' went to No. 2 in both countries on the strength of the cross-border No. 1 hit ballad "[[Babe (Styx song)|Babe]]". The album became their breakthrough album in Australia and New Zealand, reaching the top 20, with "Babe" peaking at No. 3. "Babe" was a No. 6 hit in the UK, their first and only top 40 hit there, leading ''Cornerstone'' to be their first album to chart there (at No. 36).{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

In 1981, Styx's ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theatre]]'' was a No. 1 album in the US and Canada, while also reaching the top 10 in Scandinavia and the UK (their biggest album there) and the top 30 in Australia and New Zealand. "[[The Best of Times (song)|The Best of Times]]" off the album reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the US, and the top 30 in several other countries, while "[[Too Much Time on My Hands]]" was also a top 10 hit in North America. ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'' (1983) was Styx's last major hit album, reaching the top 3 in North America and the top 10 in Scandinavia, although it was less successful elsewhere. Its lead single, "[[Mr. Roboto]]", became Styx's third chart-topper in Canada, was a No. 3 hit in the US, and was their biggest hit in Germany (No. 8). After a seven-year break, Styx returned with ''[[Edge of the Century]]'' (1990), which reached No. 63 in the US with its single, "[[Show Me the Way (Styx song)|Show Me the Way]]", becoming a top 3 hit in North America in early 1991.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Overall, Styx had eight songs that hit the top 10 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as 16 top 40 singles. Seven of their eight top 10 singles were written and sung by founding member and lead singer [[Dennis DeYoung]], who has not been part of the band since 1999. Styx sold over 20 million records for A&M between their signing in 1976 and 1984. <ref>[https://www.onamrecords.com/artists/styx]</ref>

==History==
===Band formation and the Wooden Nickel Years (1961–1974)===
In August 1961, at 12 years of age, twin brothers [[Chuck Panozzo|Chuck]] (bass) and [[John Panozzo]] (drums) first played music together with their 14-year-old neighbor [[Dennis DeYoung]] who played accordion and sang, while living in the [[Roseland, Chicago]] area,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad4rMlonMuY&t=2m44s Dennis DeYoung interview on 'Behind the Vinyl'] (boom 97.3 Toronto, uploaded Jun 7, 2016)</ref> eventually using the band name The Tradewinds. Chuck left to attend [[seminary]] for a year but returned to the group by 1964. Tom Nardini had been brought in to replace Chuck Panozzo on guitar, so he decided to play bass guitar when he returned to the band. John Panozzo was the drummer, while DeYoung had switched from accordion to keyboards. In 1965, the Tradewinds name was changed to TW4 (There Were 4)<ref name=clark /> after another band, [[the Trade Winds]], achieved fame nationally. By 1966, the Panozzo brothers had joined DeYoung at [[Chicago State College]] and kept the group together by performing at high schools and fraternity parties while studying to be teachers. In 1969 they added a college friend folk guitarist, [[John Curulewski]], after Nardini departed. Hard rocker guitarist [[James Young (American musician)|James "J.Y." Young]] came aboard in 1970, making TW4 a quintet.<ref name=clark /><ref>{{cite book|last=Panozzo|first=Chuck|title=The Grand Illusion: Love, Lies, and My Life With Styx|url=https://archive.org/details/grandillusionlov00pano|url-access=limited|year=2007|publisher= AMACOM| isbn=978-0814409169|page=[https://archive.org/details/grandillusionlov00pano/page/n67 57]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Whitaker|first= Sterling|title=The Grand Delusion: The Unauthorized True Story of Styx|year=2007|publisher=BookSurge Publishing|isbn= 978-1419653537|page=16}}</ref><ref name= mayne>{{cite news|last=Mayne|first=Mya|title=His band breaks up temporarily, but James Young 'Styx' to music career|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cm9eAAAAIBAJ&pg=1834,2852076&dq=styx+james+young&hl=en|access-date=14 July 2013|newspaper= Observer-Reporter|date=April 22, 1986}}</ref>

In 1972 the band members decided to choose a new name when they signed to [[Wooden Nickel Records]] after being spotted by a talent scout at a concert at St. John of the Cross Parish in [[Western Springs, Illinois]] (James "JY" Young's hometown). Several suggestions were made and, according to DeYoung, the name Styx was chosen because it was "the only one that none of us hated."<ref>{{cite journal|title=In Sickness and in health, Styx take no prisoners on their romp to the top.|journal= Circus|date=December 11, 1979|issue=50|url=http://forums.melodicrock.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=94642&sid=f4d559e6f0836e0461ce1e0784a8aa7d}}</ref>

The band released four albums: ''[[Styx (album)|Styx I]]'' (1972), ''[[Styx II]]'' (1973), ''[[The Serpent Is Rising]]'' (1973), and ''[[Man of Miracles]]'' (1974). These albums contained straight-ahead rockers mixed with prog rock flourish with a lot of guitars, drums, keyboards, percussion, and vocals solos. They established a fan base in the [[Chicago]] area, but were unable to break into the mainstream, though the song "Best Thing" from ''Styx'' charted on September 16, 1972, and stayed on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart for 6 weeks, peaking at No. 82.<ref name=clark /> Then, the [[power ballad]] "[[Lady (Styx song)|Lady]]" (from ''Styx II''), began to earn some radio time, first on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in Chicago in 1974<ref>{{cite book |last=Childers |first=Scott |date=2008 |title=Chicago's WLS Radio (Images of America: Illinois) |location=Charleston, SC |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |page=87 |isbn=9780738561943}}</ref> and then nationwide. In the spring of 1975, nearly two years after the album had been released, "Lady" hit No.&nbsp;6 in the US, and ''Styx II'' went gold soon after. "Lady" is considered by many classic rock critics as being the first power ballad with Dennis DeYoung being referred to as the "father of the power ballad."<ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2pnyduhfjM|title= Dennis DeYoung on Story of Styx 70s Hit Lady {{!}} Revelations {{!}} Professor of Rock|author = Professor of Rock|via=YouTube}} </ref> With the success of "Lady," a follow up single on Styx II, "You Need Love," was re-released, but only barely cracked the hot 100. For Styx to achieve mainstream success, they would need to sign with a national record company.

===Early A&M Years and addition of Tommy Shaw (1975–1978)===
On the heels of its belated hit single, Styx signed with [[A&M Records]] and released ''[[Equinox (Styx album)|Equinox]]'' (1975), which sold well and yielded a minor hit in "[[Lorelei (Styx song)|Lorelei]]," which reached No. 27 in the U.S. More importantly, it contained the rock anthem "[[Suite Madame Blue]]," which gained the band considerable recognition and airplay on [[FM radio]] in the relatively new [[Album-oriented rock|Album Oriented Rock]] (AOR) format. Following the move to A&M, guitarist [[John Curulewski]] suddenly left the band as they were to embark on a nationwide tour in December 1975, due to his desire to spend time with his family. After a frantic last-minute search, the band brought in guitarist [[Tommy Shaw]] as Curulewski's replacement.<ref name=clark />

''[[Crystal Ball (Styx album)|Crystal Ball]]'' (1976), the first album to feature Shaw, was moderately successful, but was overall a disappointment, failing to achieve the sales of its predecessor. The album showcased the band's newest member, as Shaw's "[[Mademoiselle (song)|Mademoiselle]]" was another minor hit, reaching No. 36, and the album's title track, also written and sung by Shaw became another minor AOR hit.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Styx's seventh album, ''[[The Grand Illusion (album)|The Grand Illusion]]'', was released on July 7, 1977, and became their breakthrough album, reaching [[gold album|Triple Platinum]] [[RIAA certification|certification]]. It spawned a top-ten hit and AOR radio staple in the [[Dennis DeYoung|DeYoung]]-written "[[Come Sail Away]]," which reached No. 8 in 1978. Shaw's "[[Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)]]" was a second radio hit and reached No. 29 the same year. The title track also received significant airplay.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, the band enjoyed its greatest success. Their 1978 album ''[[Pieces of Eight (album)|Pieces of Eight]]'' found the group moving in a more straight-ahead hard-rock direction and spawned three Shaw sung hit singles "[[Renegade (Styx song)|Renegade]]" (No. 16 in the US) and "[[Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)]]" (No. 21 in the US), plus a minor hit "[[Sing for the Day]]" that stopped just short of the Top Forty at No. 41.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

=== 1980s and Superstardom ===
Their 1979 album ''[[Cornerstone (Styx album)|Cornerstone]]'' yielded their first No. 1 hit, the DeYoung ballad "[[Babe (Styx song)|Babe]]." By early 1980, "Babe" had become the band's biggest international hit and first million-selling single, reaching No. 6 in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The album also included the No. 26 DeYoung hits upbeat "[[Why Me (Styx song)|Why Me]]" and the rocker "[[Borrowed Time (Styx song)|Borrowed Time]]," which was co-written with Shaw, plus Shaw's folksy "[[Boat on the River]]" (1980), which was a hit in much of Europe and Japan. The popularity of the album (No. 2 ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'') helped win the band a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for Best New Song in 1980. At the [[22nd Grammy Awards]], Styx was a nominee for [[Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]] and ''Cornerstone'''s engineers [[Gary Loizzo]] and Rob Kingsland were nominated for a Grammy for Best Engineered Recording. The band was also named the most popular rock band in the U.S. in the 1980 year end Gallup Poll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2008-05-18-0805160516-story.html|title=From Styx to stage|author=Chris Jones|website=Chicagotribune.com}}</ref>

With the success of "Babe," DeYoung's push for a more mainstream direction gained momentum, while Shaw and Young favored a more rock oriented approach. This arguing over musical direction led to ongoing tension in early 1980 after Shaw objected to the ballad "First Time" being released as the second single from ''Cornerstone''. Although the song was generating substantial airplay in some major markets, A&M pulled the plug on the single's official release, replacing it with "Why Me." The argument resulted in DeYoung being briefly fired. However, things were quickly smoothed over.<ref>VHI Behind the Music Remastered</ref> While “First Time” did not chart in the U.S. (because it wasn't released), it became a huge hit single in the Philippines in 1981. In January 1981, Styx released ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theatre]]'', a [[concept album]] that became their biggest hit, reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' pop albums chart and yielding five singles, including the top ten hits "[[The Best of Times (song)|The Best of Times]]" by DeYoung (No. 3 Billboard, No. 1 Radio & Records) and "[[Too Much Time on My Hands]]" by Shaw (No. 9), his only top 10 single as a member of the band. ''Paradise Theatre'' became the band's fourth consecutive [[multi-platinum]] album. Based on yet another Dennis DeYoung concept, the Paradise Theatre was a historic Chicago theatre that had been built in the 20s only to fall on hard times and close a mere 30 years after it opened. DeYoung used the Paradise as a metaphor for the United States in the late 1970s/early 80s.

An ambitious year long world tour commenced in 1981 in support of the album and was one of the top grossing tours of the year. The tour had numerous Broadway and movie infused elements, including a dramatic opening featuring a theatre sweep and DeYoung by himself next to a player piano and the show ending with traditional movie credits. Throughout the tour and throughout the 1980s and beyond, the band would open their shows with "[[Rockin' the Paradise]]," the opening track from ''Paradise Theatre'' which charted at No. 8 on the Top Rocks Track Chart and whose music video would be among the first to air on the [[MTV]] cable channel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The band was accused by a [[California]] religious group and later the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] of [[backmasking]] [[Satanism|Satanic]] messages in their anti-[[cocaine]] anthem, "[[Snowblind (Styx song)|Snowblind]]."<ref name=clark>{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Dick|title=Styx and stones...|newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]]|date=March 29, 1983}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.wazzontv.com/2011/03/09/styx_snowblind_81_live/|title=wazzontv.com|date=January 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110022905/http://theatre.wazzontv.com/2011/03/09/styx_snowblind_81_live/|archive-date=January 10, 2016}}</ref> [[James Young (American musician)|James "JY" Young]] has denied this charge during his introduction for "Snowblind" when played live. [[Dennis DeYoung]] has denied the accusation as well, joking on the ''[[In the Studio with Redbeard]]'' program "we had enough trouble to make the music sound right forward." Also, Young quotes, "If we were going to put some message in our songs, we would have put it so it was in the song forward. Not so you would have to buy some $400 tape recorder to hear it."

===''Kilroy Was Here'' and first disbandment (1983–1984)===
The band continues to follow DeYoung's lead with their next project, ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'' (1983), another more fully realized concept album, embracing the [[rock opera]] form. It is set in a future where performing and playing rock music has been outlawed due to the efforts of a charismatic evangelist, Dr. Everett Righteous, played by James "JY" Young. ''Kilroy Was Here'' featured DeYoung in the part of Kilroy, an unjustly imprisoned rock star. Tommy Shaw played the part of Jonathan Chance, a younger rocker who fights for Kilroy's freedom and the lifting of the ban on rock music. This future society is served by robots. Called Robotos, these automatons perform many jobs, and several serve as Kilroy's prison guards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Part of the impetus for the Kilroy story was the band's reaction to the [[backmasking]] accusation.<ref name=clark /> The album included Young's song "[[Heavy Metal Poisoning]]," which includes lyrics sarcastically mocking the allegations against the group. Its introduction intentionally included a backward message, the Latin phrases, "annuit coeptis" and "novus ordo seclorum," from the reverse side of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. Referring to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, these are translated, "''[[Annuit cœptis]]'' - He (God) favors our undertakings, and ''[[Novus ordo seclorum]]'' - A new order of the ages."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyfactory.gov/document.cfm/18/2233|title=The Great Seal of the United States on Paper Currency

The album ''Kilroy Was Here'' went [[Platinum certification|Platinum]] in 1983, boasting two Top Ten hits written and sung by DeYoung, the [[synthesizer]]-based "[[Mr. Roboto]]" (No. 3 US) and power ballad "[[Don't Let It End]]" (No. 6 US). The album earned a nomination as Best Engineered Recording for engineer and long-time friend [[Gary Loizzo]] and fellow engineers on the album Will Rascati and Rob Kingsland, for the 26th Grammy Awards (1983).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://theenvelope.latimes.com/search/env-past-winners-search,0,1243372,results.formprofile?Query=Styx&selectsearch=pastwinners&target=article&Lib=turbine_cdb_lib%3Aresult_doc_id+result_doc_rank+document_id+cdb_num+cdb_01_txt+cdb_02_txt+cdb_03_txt+cdb_04_txt+cdb_01_num&SortBy=COMPOSITE_RANK+desc&PageSize=10&Page=1&MinCoarseRank=500&QueryType=CONCEPT&x=10&y=11.

In 1983, the band mounted an ambitious stage show in support of ''Kilroy Was Here''<ref name=clark /> featuring theatrical presentations of three songs utilizing instrumental backing tracks, including "Mr. Roboto," which featured DeYoung singing live while disguised as a Roboto, "Heavy Metal Poisoning" with Young as the evangelist Dr. Righteous singing while the Panozzo brothers acted as his henchmen on stage, and "Haven't We Been Here Before" with Shaw as Jonathan Chance and DeYoung (as Kilroy in Roboto costume) duetting. The elaborate show was expensive to produce and was not as profitable as previous tours.

''Kilroy Was Here'' brought the creative and competitive tensions within the band beyond the breaking point. Shaw departed the band for a solo career at the conclusion of the tour. In 1984, the band released its first live album, ''[[Caught in the Act (Styx album)|Caught in the Act]]''. The project featured one studio track, "[[Music Time (song)|Music Time]]," which became a Top 40 hit. The concert was also filmed and released on VHS under the same title (and on DVD in 2007). By the time of the album's release, the band had already parted ways.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

===Reformation, ''Edge of the Century'', second disbandment and reformation (1990–1996)===
Styx reformed in 1990, bringing in [[Glen Burtnik]] as a new guitarist, as Shaw was by then committed to [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Styx Newcomer Burtnik Feels He Fits Right in|newspaper=Worcester Telegram Gazette|date=May 26, 1991}}</ref>

The new line-up released one album, ''[[Edge of the Century]]'', featuring the Dennis DeYoung ballad "[[Show Me the Way (Styx song)|Show Me the Way]]," which received an additional boost just prior to the first [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. Some radio stations edited the Top Three hit to include the voices of children, whose parents were deployed in Saudi Arabia between 1990 and 1991. The song went all the way to No. 3 on both the [[Hot 100]] and at [[Adult Contemporary]] radio and notably remained in the top 40 for 23 weeks and AC for 31 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1991-03-16/hot-100|title=Music: Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> With the huge success of the song "Show Me the Way," Styx joined a handful of musical acts to have top 10 singles in three different decades and under four different presidential administrations.

A follow-up single, “[[Love At First Sight (Styx song)|Love At First Sight]]," peaked at No. 25 on the [[Hot 100]] and No. 13 on the [[Adult Contemporary]] chart.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Styx toured across the US in the spring and summer of 1991, but their success was short-lived, as they were dropped after A&M Records was purchased by [[PolyGram Records]], ending an over-fifteen-year relationship. The popularity of [[Grunge]] was a major factor in PolyGram letting the band go.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

A set of demos titled ''Son of Edge'' were completed and shown to other record labels. But with [[grunge]] now dominating the rock press, video channels, and airwaves, and with singles from pop/rock bands being phased out, there was little interest from major record companies, and by fall 1991, Styx disbanded once again.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The band reunited once again in 1995, with guitarist Tommy Shaw returning to the fold, to re-record "Lady" for ''[[Styx Greatest Hits]]''. Session drummer Todd Sucherman filled in for John Panozzo, who was unable to participate due to liver problems caused by years of excessive [[alcohol (drug)|drinking]], which eventually claimed his life the following year on July 16.<ref name=obit>{{cite news|title=John Panozzo - Styx Drummer|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=July 16, 1996}}</ref>

The 1996 "Return to Paradise" tour, with Sucherman as a full member, was successful. The reunion tour was documented with a two-disc live set, 1997's ''[[Return to Paradise (Styx album)|Return to Paradise]]'', which featured three new studio tracks: "On My Way," "Paradise" (a soft rock ballad that also appears in another version on Dennis DeYoung's 1998 ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Dennis DeYoung album)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' album), and "Dear John," a tribute to the late Panozzo that has become a cult favorite among Styx fans. And later on it was documented on DVD. The ''Return to Paradise'' album was a surprise success in 1997, achieving gold status and the single “Paradise” briefly charting on the Adult Contemporary chart at No. 27. Following the release of the album, Styx embarked on another tour, this one to mark the 20th anniversary of [[The Grand Illusion (album)|''The Grand Illusion'']].{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

=== ''Brave New World'' and departure of DeYoung (1999–2000) ===
Two years later, in 1999, the band released its first new studio album in almost a decade: ''[[Brave New World (Styx album)|Brave New World]]''. The album received a lukewarm reception and sold very slowly, and the single, "Everything Is Cool," failed to chart.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Once again, during work on the album, personality conflicts drove the band members apart. While Tommy Shaw's material attempted to bring the band into the next century and JY's songs attempted to convey a hard rock vein, Dennis DeYoung's more pop and Broadway-style leanings led to divergent sounds on ''Brave New World''. According to DeYoung, another crucial difference was that he was not the overall producer on this album, as he had been on the others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Arguments over which songs to release as singles, the album's artwork, the track sequencing, the slow album sales, and the omission of DeYoung's vocals and keyboards from many of the Shaw-Young tracks fueled the fire.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The band was further hindered by a viral illness contracted by DeYoung, which temporarily made his eyes sensitive to light. DeYoung asked his bandmates to delay touring, but they refused and decided to go forward without him. DeYoung was replaced by [[Lawrence Gowan]], a classically trained pianist, who had achieved platinum success as a solo act on [[Sony Canada]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Ray|title=Touring like never before|journal=Billboard|date=August 4, 2001|volume=113|issue=31|page=S8}}</ref> Gowan's song "[[A Criminal Mind]]" was incorporated into their tour [[set list]], and was still performed into the 2010s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/07/10/styx-singer-lawrence-gowan-is-still-a-strange-animal/ |title=Styx singer Lawrence Gowan is still a strange animal |last=Go |first=Justin |newspaper=[[National Post]] |date=10 July 2012 |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141005003432/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/07/10/styx-singer-lawrence-gowan-is-still-a-strange-animal/ |archive-date=October 5, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Bassist Chuck Panozzo was sidelined in 1999 due to health problems related to his battle with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. His public "coming out" occurred in 2001 at the annual [[Human Rights Campaign]] banquet, with James "JY" Young in attendance for support.<ref>Panozzo, Chuck (2007). The Grand Illusion: Love, Lies, and My Life With Styx. AMACOM,2007, p. 185.</ref>

On June 6, 1999, the group reunited briefly to perform for the [[Children's Miracle Network Hospitals|Children's Miracle Network]] Telethon as DeYoung's final performance with the band. Glen Burtnik filled in for Chuck Panozzo on bass.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

On June 9, 2000, Styx made an appearance with [[REO Speedwagon]] at the [[Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre (Maryland Heights, Missouri)|Riverport Amphitheatre]]. A 2-CD recording of the concert was released as ''[[Arch Allies: Live at Riverport]]'', with one disc of each band's set, and both discs concluding with performances of the two bands collaborating on jam versions of Styx's "Blue Collar Man" and REO's "[[Roll with the Changes]]."  Each band also released their set as a separate album, with additional tracks; Styx's version was ''[[At the River's Edge: Live in St. Louis]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

With Chuck Panozzo concentrating on his health problems, Glen Burtnik returned to Styx in 1999 to fill in for him on bass, with Panozzo participating on a part-time basis, sitting in as his health permitted.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

[[File:Styx 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Styx performing in 2009]]
Styx's new lineup released several live albums and released the studio album ''[[Cyclorama (album)|Cyclorama]]'' in February 2003, which reached No.&nbsp;127 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts. A single "Waiting for Our Time" hit No.&nbsp;37 on the ''Billboard'' mainstream rock chart for 1 week. Styx toured extensively during this period and released additional live albums. Styx also was part of the Super Bowl pre game entertainment in San Diego prior to the Oakland Raiders vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They played a short set in the parking lot, as well as on the field right before the game, playing [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[We Are the Champions]]."{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Burtnik left Styx in September 2003, to spend time with his family and to pursue a solo career and release the album ''Welcome to Hollywood''. He was replaced by [[Ricky Phillips]], formerly of [[the Babys]] and [[Bad English]]. Panozzo continues to play bass for some shows with Phillips on rhythm guitar, while Phillips continues as a stand in bassist for Panozzo during shows without him. Burtnik would go on to join up with DeYoung for numerous tour dates over the next several years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

On June 5, 2004, Styx participated in Eric Clapton's [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] covering songs by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[B.B. King]], and [[Slim Harpo]] with [[Jeff Baxter]] as a special guest.<ref>{{cite web

In 2005, Styx released an album of cover tunes, ''[[Big Bang Theory (Styx album)|Big Bang Theory]]'', which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 50 on the album charts, their highest charting album since 1990. Their version of [[the Beatles]] song "[[I Am the Walrus]]" received some radio play, and a video was made for the song, which was subsequently featured in their live shows. Still, the album had a short life on the charts and failed to make much of a dent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

As of April 21, 2006, according to the [[RIAA]], which awards artists and groups gold/platinum status, Styx ranks number 127 with 17.5&nbsp;million records sold within the United States.<ref>{{cite web

A longstanding, oft-repeated claim in the music industry and the mainstream press is that Styx were the first band to release four consecutive ''Triple''-Platinum albums, signifying at least 3&nbsp;million units sold.<ref name="styxworld1"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.times-news.com/entertainment/local_story_188091223.html?keyword=topstory |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130204125110/http://www.times-news.com/entertainment/local_story_188091223.html?keyword=topstory |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |title=Cumberland Times-News - Styx, Kansas Concert, August&nbsp;11|website=Times-news.com|access-date=April 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tbnweekly.com/content_articles/090806_leconcert-04.txt |title=Styx, Foreigner and Foghat coming to Ford Amphitheatre|work=Tampa Bay Newspapers|date=September 7, 2006|access-date=April 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51408/episode.jhtml |title=Behind The Music : Styx &#124; VSPOT Video Clips, Photos, Episodes and Online Message Boards from the Reality TV Show|publisher=VH1|access-date=April 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist,8683.sm |title=Styx (USA) |last=Sharpe-Young |first=Garry |website=Rock Detector |date=March 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220635/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist,8683.sm |archive-date=April 30, 2008 |access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.livedaily.com/interviews/liveDaily_Interview_Tommy_Shaw_of_Styx-3264.html?t=6 liveDaily Interview: Tommy Shaw of Styx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007103422/http://www.livedaily.com/interviews/liveDaily_Interview_Tommy_Shaw_of_Styx-3264.html?t=6 |date=October 7, 2008 }}</ref>  During the period when these albums charted, the RIAA's only certifications were for Gold (500,000 units sold) and Platinum (1&nbsp;million). Multi-Platinum awards were introduced in late October 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=historyx |title=Gold & Platinum - August&nbsp;08, 2008 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701162808/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=historyx |archive-date=July 1, 2007}}</ref> Following this development, record companies submitted their most popular artists' sales records to accountants in order to achieve the new thresholds.
Styx did score three Triple-Platinum albums—''The Grand Illusion'' (1977), ''Pieces of Eight'' (1978) and ''Paradise Theatre'' (1981)—and one Double-Platinum album—''Cornerstone'' (1979)—on the same date, November 14, 1984. Complete and detailed historical sales figures for record albums are not readily available to the public, but the certifications, which can be found at the RIAA site, show that the feat the band actually achieved was being the first group to be awarded four consecutive Multi-Platinum albums with three of those ranking better than Double Platinum. Styx achieved another Double-Platinum album—''Greatest Hits (Volume I)''—on August 23, 2005.
