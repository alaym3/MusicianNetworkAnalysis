==Early life==
Twain was born Eilleen Regina Edwards in [[Windsor, Ontario]], on August 28, 1965,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shaniatwain.com/bio|title=Shania Twain – About|access-date=August 17, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820032156/http://www.shaniatwain.com/bio|archive-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref> to Sharon (''née'' Morrison) and Clarence Edwards. She has two sisters, Jill and Carrie Ann. Her parents divorced when she was two and her mother moved to [[Timmins, Ontario]], with her daughters. Sharon married Jerry Twain, an [[Ojibwa]] from the nearby [[Mattagami First Nation]], and they had son Mark together. Jerry adopted the girls and legally changed their surname to Twain. When Mark was a toddler, Jerry and Sharon adopted Jerry's baby nephew Darryl when his mother died. Because of Twain's connection to Jerry, the media have incorrectly reported that she is of Ojibwe descent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shania Twain : Biography|work=Rolling Stone Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/shaniatwain/biography|access-date=October 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123143156/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/shaniatwain/biography|archive-date=November 23, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> When questioned as to why she chose not to publicly acknowledge Edwards as her father for years, Twain stated: <blockquote>My father (Jerry) went out of his way to raise three daughters that weren't even his. For me to acknowledge another man as my father, a man who was never there for me as a father, who wasn't the one who struggled everyday to put food on our table, would have hurt him terribly. We were a family. Step-father, step-brothers, we never used that vocabulary in our home. To have referred to him as my step-father would have been the worst slap across the face to him.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://ammsa.com/publications/windspeaker/native-ancestry-called-question|title=Native ancestry called into question|website=Ammsa.com|access-date=2019-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713201204/https://ammsa.com/publications/windspeaker/native-ancestry-called-question|archive-date=July 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>Shania currently holds a status card and is on the official band membership list of the [[Temagami First Nation]]. In 1991, the singer was offered a recording contract in Nashville and applied for immigration status into the United States. At that time, by virtue of her stepfather Jerry Twain being a full-blooded Ojibwe and the rights guaranteed to Native Americans in the [[Jay Treaty]] (1795), Shania became legally registered as having 50 percent Native American blood.<ref name=":0" />

Twain has said that as a child she was told by her mother that her biological father was part Cree, a claim his family denies.<ref name=":0" /> Her confirmed ancestry includes English, French, and Irish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/edwards.html|title=Ancestry of Shania Twain|publisher=Wargs.com|access-date=August 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602155658/http://www.wargs.com/other/edwards.html|archive-date=June 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/blog/look-whos-related-taylor-swift-and-reba-mcentire-373829.html|title=Look Who's Related: Taylor Swift and Reba McEntire|publisher=Geni.com|access-date=August 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510181144/http://www.geni.com/blog/look-whos-related-taylor-swift-and-reba-mcentire-373829.html|archive-date=May 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Through a maternal great-grandmother, she is a descendant of French carpenter [[Zacharie Cloutier]].<ref name="Ref_d">{{cite web|url=http://www.perche-quebec.com/files/loiseauHTML/menu/home_en.htm|title=Genealogies of Madonna, Celine Dion, Hillary Clinton and Camilla, Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall – All cousins!|publisher=Perche-quebec.com|access-date=February 23, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220215928/http://www.perche-quebec.com/files/loiseauHTML/menu/home_en.htm|archive-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref> Her Irish maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated from [[Newbridge, County Kildare]].<ref>Twain, Shania.

Twain has said she had a difficult childhood. Her parents earned little money, and food was often scarce in their household. Twain did not confide her situation to school authorities, fearing they might break up the family. Her mother and stepfather's marriage was stormy at times, and from a young age she witnessed violence between them. Her mother also struggled with bouts of depression.<ref name="Ref_f">Shania's interview in the January 2005 [[Reader's Digest]].</ref> Sharon returned to Jerry with the children in 1981. In Timmins, Twain started singing at bars at the age of eight to try to help pay her family's bills; she often earned [[Canadian dollar|$]]20 between midnight and 1 a.m. performing for remaining customers after the bar had finished serving alcohol. Although she expressed a dislike for singing in those bars, Twain believes that this was her own kind of performing-arts school on the road.<ref name="Ref_h">[http://www.shaniaforums.com/archive/index.php/t-34295.html Shania Twain Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112051039/http://www.shaniaforums.com/archive/index.php/t-34295.html|date=November 12, 2007}}. [[Today with Des and Mel]]. ITV Productions</ref> She has said of the ordeal, "My deepest passion was music and it helped. There were moments when I thought, 'I hate this.'

At age 13, Twain was invited to perform on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''[[Tommy Hunter]] Show''. While attending [[Timmins High and Vocational School]], she was also the singer for a local band called Longshot, which covered Top 40 music.<ref>{{cite web|author=KymSarah says|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/shania-twain|title=Shania Twain &#124; Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=Walkoffame.com|access-date=October 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328011316/http://www.walkoffame.com/shania-twain|archive-date=March 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In the early 1980s, Twain spent some time working with her father's [[reforestation]] business in northern Ontario, which employed some 75 Ojibwe and Cree workers. Although the work was demanding and the pay low, Twain said, "I loved the feeling of being stranded. I'm not afraid of being in my own environment, being physical, working hard. I was very strong, I walked miles and miles every day and carried heavy loads of trees. You can't shampoo, use soap or deodorant, or makeup, nothing with any scent; you have to bathe and rinse your clothes in the lake. It was a very rugged existence, but I was very creative and I would sit alone in the forest with my dog and a guitar and would just write songs."<ref name="Ref_j">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005a|p=62}}</ref>

She performed [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]" and [[Hank Williams]]' "[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]".

Several years later, when Twain's siblings moved out on their own, she assembled a demo tape of her songs and her Huntsville manager set up a showcase for her to present her material to record executives. She caught the attention of a few labels, including [[Mercury Nashville Records]], who signed her within a few months.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=SHANIA|title=Shania Twain Biography|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 15, 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> During this time, she changed her name to Shania, which was said{{by whom|date=March 2021}} to be an [[Ojibwa]] word which means "on my way." However, Twain's biographer, Robin Eggar, writes: "There is a continuing confusion about what 'Shania' means and if indeed it is an Ojibwe word or phrase at all. There is no mispronounced or misheard phrase in either Ojibwe or Cree that comes close to meaning 'on my way.' Yet the legend of her name continues to be repeated in the media to this day."<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=145">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005a|p=145}}</ref> Eggar was mistaken about there being no Ojibwe phrase that "comes close", as "Ani aya'aa", pronounced "Ah-nih Eye-uh-ah", means "someone on the way" in Ojibwe. It is therefore possible that someone with an imperfect knowledge of the Ojibwe language created Shania with the incorrect idea it would mean "she's on the way".<ref name="Evans 2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.omaha.com/go/music/evans-fan-of-shania-twain-here-s-the-story-behind/article_dc704ea5-cc92-5511-a56c-99ff63799427.html|title=Evans: Fan of Shania Twain?

Twain's [[Shania Twain (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on April 20, 1993, in North America and garnered her audiences outside Canada. Shortly before its release, she sang backing vocals for other Mercury artists, including on [[Jeff Chance]]'s album ''Walk Softly on the Bridges'' (1992)<ref>Hager, p. 90</ref> and [[Sammy Kershaw]]'s album ''[[Haunted Heart (Sammy Kershaw album)|Haunted Heart]]'' (1993).<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Haunted Heart|others=Sammy Kershaw|year=1993|type=cassette|publisher=Mercury Records|id=514332}}</ref> While ''Shania Twain'' only reached No. 67 on the US Country Albums Chart, it gained positive reviews from critics. The album failed to sell significant copies upon release, but Twain's future success generated enough interest for the album to be certified platinum in 1999 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], denoting sales of over 1 million copies. The album yielded two minor hit singles in the United States with "[[What Made You Say That]]" and "[[Dance with the One That Brought You]]". The third and final single, "[[You Lay a Whole Lot of Love on Me]]", failed to chart. All three singles had accompanying music videos. The album was more successful in Europe, where Twain won Country Music Television Europe's "Rising Video Star of the Year" award.<ref name="allmusic"/> In her 2011 autobiography ''From This Moment On'', Twain expressed displeasure with her debut studio album, revealing that she had very little creative control and was frustrated with being unable to showcase her songwriting abilities. She did, however, co-write one song, "God Ain't Gonna Getcha for That", for the album.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Twain|first1=Shania|title=From This Moment On|date=May 3, 2011|publisher=[[Atria Publishing Group]]|location=New York|isbn=9781451620740}}</ref>

===1995–1996: ''The Woman in Me'' and commercial success===
When rock producer [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]] heard Twain's original songs and singing from her debut album, he offered to produce and write songs with her. After many telephone conversations, they met at [[CMA Music Festival|Nashville's Fan Fair]] in June 1993. Twain and Lange became very close within just weeks, culminating in their wedding on December 28, 1993. Lange and Twain either wrote or co-wrote the songs that would form her second studio album, ''[[The Woman in Me (album)|The Woman in Me]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{Citation|editor=Jann S.

''The Woman in Me'' was released on February 7, 1995. Of the 12 tracks on the album, 8 were released as singles. The album's first single, "[[Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?]]" went to No. 11 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country Chart]]. This was followed by her first Country Top 10 and No.1 hit single, "[[Any Man of Mine]]", which also cracked the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Twain had further hits from the album, including the [[The Woman in Me (Needs the Man in You)|title track]] which peaked at No.14 and three additional No.1 hits: "[[(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!]]", "[[You Win My Love]]", and "[[No One Needs to Know]]", which was selected for the original soundtrack for the 1996 film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', a first for Twain. Plus minor country hit "[[Home Ain't Where His Heart Is (Anymore)]]" and a re-recorded gospel version of the album track "[[God Bless the Child (Shania Twain song)|God Bless the Child]]" with new lyrics.<ref name="allmusic"/> Meanwhile, in Australia, five of these singles: "The Woman in Me", "I'm Outta Here!", "You Win My Love", "No One Needs to Know" and "God Bless the Child", were remixed for the Australian pop market, with "I'm Outta Here!" becoming Twain's breakthrough hit there, reaching No.5 on the ARIA charts.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===1997–2001: ''Come On Over'', international pop breakthrough, cancelled Christmas album and Limelight Sessions===

In 1997, Twain released her follow-up album, ''[[Come On Over]]''. It established her as a successful crossover singer. Of the 16 tracks on the album, 12 were released as singles. Following the release of lead singles "[[Love Gets Me Every Time]]" and "[[Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)]]", which allowed Twain to make more appearances in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, the album started selling. With the release of third single, "[[You're Still the One]]", sales skyrocketed. "[[From This Moment On (Shania Twain song)|From This Moment On]]", "[[When (Shania Twain song)|When]]", "[[Honey, I'm Home]]", "[[That Don't Impress Me Much]]", "[[Man! I Feel Like a Woman!]]", "[[You've Got a Way]]", the [[Come On Over (Shania Twain song)|title track]], "[[Rock This Country!]]", and "[[I'm Holdin' On to Love (To Save My Life)]]" are the other nine songs that eventually saw release as singles. With the exception of "I'm Holdin' On to Love", all of the singles had accompanying music videos. "From This Moment On" is a duet with singer [[Bryan White]] and there was a re-recorded solo pop version, which was used for its music video.<ref>"Year-to-Date Songwriters Charts."

In 1998, following the pop release of "You're Still the One", the ''Come On Over'' album was released in a remixed format for the European market as a pop album with less country instrumentation, and actually gave her the big breakthrough in Europe she and her producer husband Robert John "Mutt" Lange were looking for. ''Come On Over'' went to No. 1 on the UK album charts for 11 weeks. It became the biggest selling album of the year in the UK and a bestseller in other big European markets as well, selling more than one million copies in Germany and nearly 4&nbsp;million in the UK alone. Although "You're Still The One" and the pop version of "From This Moment On" cracked the Top 10 of the UK charts and "When" had success in the Top 20, the songs that finally drew European attention to the album were the pop remixed singles of "That Don't Impress Me Much", which reached number 3 in the UK and cracked the Top 10 in Germany, and "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!", which peaked at number 3 in both the UK and France. Additionally, "You've Got a Way" was remixed specifically for inclusion on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]''. Subsequently, a reissue of the international version of the album was released worldwide, including the US and Europe, containing three of these new remixes. Additionally, the album set the record for the longest ever stay in the Top 20 of the ''Billboard'' 200, remaining there for 99 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1999/country-albums|title=1999 Archive|website=Billboard|access-date=August 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814041847/https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1999/country-albums|archive-date=August 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Billboard'' magazine declared Shania Twain the most played adult contemporary artist on US radio in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/Billboard-Airplay/1999/BBAM-1999-12-24.pdf |title=Shania Twain Helps Island/Def Jam Music Claim AC Supremacy |work=Airplay Monitor |page=46 |date=December 24, 1999 |access-date=July 23, 2021 }}</ref>

In 1998, Twain launched her first major concert tour, aided by her manager [[Jon Landau]], a veteran of many large-scale tours with [[Bruce Springsteen]].

''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'' was released on November 19, 2002. On January 26, 2003, Twain performed in the [[Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show]]. About a year later, Twain kicked off the [[Up! Tour]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Ontario, Canada on September 25, 2003. ''Up!'' was released with three different discs – country/acoustic (green CD), pop/rock (red CD), and world/dance (blue CD). ''Up!'' was given four out of five stars by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, and debuted at No.1 on the ''Billboard'' albums chart, selling 874,000 in the first week alone. It remained at the top of the charts for five weeks. Twain's crossover appeal in the country, pop and dance genres, led ''Up!'' to reach 1 in Germany, 2 in Australia and the Top Five in the UK and France. In Germany, ''Up!'' was certified 4x platinum and stayed in the Top 100 for a year and a half. The international music disc was remixed with Indian-style orchestral and percussion parts recorded in [[Mumbai]], India. The new versions were produced by Simon and [[Diamond Duggal]], brothers from [[Birmingham]], England. They were originally invited to contribute parts to the pop version of "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!" which retained the Indian influence.<ref name="Ref_p">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/communities/masti/2003/03/16/diamond_duggal.shtml|title=Shania's 'Asian inspiration' talks it 'Up!'|publisher=BBC|access-date=October 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927072602/http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/communities/masti/2003/03/16/diamond_duggal.shtml|archive-date=September 27, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

Eight of the tracks were released as singles in various markets. The first single from the album, "[[I'm Gonna Getcha Good!]]" became a top 10 country hit in the US, after debuting at No.&nbsp;24 after only five days of airplay; but only made the Top 40 on the pop charts. It was a much bigger hit on the other side of the Atlantic, released in a pop version, the single hit 4 in the UK. In Australia, Germany and France, the song reached the Top 15 in each case. The follow-up single was the title track, which reached the Top 15 in the US country charts but only reached 63 on the pop charts. The second European single, and third single overall, became the mid-tempo song "[[Ka-Ching!]]" (which was never released as a single in North America) with lyrics where Twain was criticizing unchecked consumerism. The song eventually became another smash hit in the important European markets, reaching 1 in Germany and [[Austria]] and other European countries, the UK Top 10 and the Top 15 in France. "Ka-Ching!" remains one of Twain's most-successful singles internationally.

The fourth single from the album would be the most successful in the US, the romantic ballad "[[Forever and for Always]]". It was released in April 2003 and peaked at 4 on the country chart, 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart and 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Again, success was even bigger on the other side of the Atlantic with "Forever and For Always" again reaching the Top 10 in both, the UK and Germany. The other four singles from the album were "[[Thank You Baby! (For Makin' Someday Come So Soon)]]", "[[She's Not Just a Pretty Face]]", "[[When You Kiss Me]]" and "[[It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing]]". All eight singles had accompanying music videos. The title track "Up!", and "When You Kiss Me" saw release in limited edition to European countries, such as Germany, in early 2004. By January 2008, ''Up!'' had sold 5.5&nbsp;million copies in the US and was certified as 11x platinum (Diamond) by the [[RIAA]].<ref name = RIAA/> This made Twain the only female artist in history to have three consecutive albums [[RIAA certification|certified Diamond]] by the [[RIAA]].

== Public image and reception ==
Despite her success, Twain has been a divisive figure within country music among purists who initially did not take kindly to her "genre-blending".<ref name=":4" /> According to biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, most critics accused her of "diluting country with bland, anthemic hard rock techniques and shamelessly selling her records with sexy videos."<ref name=":11" /> Similar to [[Garth Brooks]] before her, Twain was initially branded an interloper whose modern production, presentation and songwriting "disrupt[ed] the genre's status quo".<ref name=":13" /> During the 1990s, Twain often received backlash for her unconventionally liberated appearance as a country music singer.<ref name=":52" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=Koo|first=Sarah|date=November 6, 2013|title=Shania Twain Weighs In On What's 'Too Sexy'|url=https://etcanada.com/news/9440/shania-twain-weighs-in-on-whats-too-sexy/|url-status=live|access-date=September 2, 2021|website=[[Entertainment Tonight Canada]]}}</ref> Despite the breakthrough success of ''The Woman in Me'', early detractors did not take her seriously as an artist, with several music journalists questioning her lyrics, the "[[Overproduction (music)|manufactured]]" production of her albums, and her singing ability.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|last=Bell|first=Sonya|date=June 4, 2015|title=Thank you, Shania Twain|work=[[Maclean's]]|url=https://www.macleans.ca/culture/arts/thank-you-shania-twain/|access-date=September 2, 2021}}</ref> Such critics concurred that Twain had little to offer apart from her sex appeal and music videos,<ref name=":3" /> often focusing on her physical appearance instead of her music.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Miller|first=Madison|date=July 27, 2021|title=Shania Twain Speaks Out on Being Called ‘America’s Best Paid Lap Dancer’ in Early Nashville Days|url=https://outsider.com/news/country-music/shania-twain-speaks-out-being-called-americas-best-paid-lap-dancer-early-nashville-days/|url-status=live|access-date=September 9, 2021|website=Outsider}}</ref> Early in her career, Twain found herself at-odds with the conservative opinions of the country music industry at the time due to her assertive personality and proclivity for wearing revealing outfits that exposed her [[midriff]].<ref name=":43" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":8">{{Cite web|last=Nash|first=Alanna|date=February 3, 2020|title=Shania Twain's Career Comeback|url=https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/celebrities/info-2020/shania-twain-regains-her-voice.html|url-status=live|access-date=September 2, 2021|website=[[AARP]]|quote=the midriff that once put Nashville traditionalists in a dither.}}</ref> Twain was constantly deprecated for baring her midriff to the point where critics nicknamed it "The most famous midriff in Nashville",<ref name=":4" /> while [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] banned the music video for her debut single "What Made You Say That".<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=October 16, 2013|title=10 things you didn't know about Shania Twain|url=https://ca.hellomagazine.com/music/gallery/0201310162384/10-things-you-didn-t-know-about-shania-twain/4/#:~:text=Back%20to%20story%20October%2016,because%20she%20showed%20her%20midriff.|url-status=live|access-date=September 2, 2021|website=[[Hello!

Hall of the [[Associated Press]], since the singer had not yet begun touring, Twain used music videos to broaden her audience.<ref name=":10" /> Similarly, Erlewine considers Twain to be "the first country artist to fully exploit MTV's style" by cultivating "a sexy, video-oriented image ... that appealed" to both country and pop audiences, largely without touring.<ref name=":11" />

Twain's record label cautioned her that both men and women would dislike her independence and sexual expressiveness, respectively, but she did not believe them.<ref name=":43" /> Record executives warned her that women would feel threatened by her "dressing too sexy".<ref name=":52" /> Refusing "to conform to a single archetype of femininity", Twain recalled that she used music to communicate with like-minded women by alternating between heartbroken, comedic, vengeful, empowered, self-deprecating and lustful personas "all on the same record."<ref name=":43" /> Country rock musician [[Steve Earle]] famously labeled Twain "the world's highest-paid [[Lap dance|lap-dancer]]."<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Wheeler|first=Brad|date=April 5, 2003|title=Shania a snobby star?

And then it’s up to the viewer whether they like it or not.”<ref name=":6" />

At one point, Twain was considered to be among the biggest music stars in the world.<ref name=":2" /> Journalist Brian D. Johnson wrote that, despite her [[girl next door]] image, the singer "has the sort of star power that people expect from royalty", which he attributes to her Cinderella-esque life story.<ref name=":1" /> ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki/>'s [[Simon Hattenstone]] described Twain as "sexy, empowering and funny. This was a woman who knew what she wanted – men, action, dancing, control."<ref name=":15" /> Calling her equally country, pop and rock star, Hattenstone went on to write that the singer is "fancied by the straight boys, admired by the straight girls, adored by gay men as a camp icon and loved by lesbians who read what they wanted into Man! I Feel Like a Woman!."<ref name=":15" /> Claiming Twain's stint hosting the 2003 Juno Awards was noticeably void of diva behavior despite persistent rumors of outrageous antics and demands at the time, Brad Wheeler of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' described Twain as "an international icon and Canada's sweetheart", a sentiment with which Juno Awards producer John Brunton agreed.<ref name=":2" /> Instead the singer relied on her own security, band, production team and assistants.<ref name=":2" />
