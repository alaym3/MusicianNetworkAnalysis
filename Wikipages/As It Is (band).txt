==History==

===Formation and ''Never Happy, Ever After'' (2012–2016)===
As It Is was formed in spring 2012<ref name=Biddulph36>Biddulph 2015, p. 36</ref> by Minnesota-born Patty Walters, who posted an advertisement stating that he was looking for musicians to be in a pop-punk band using the online service Join My Band.<ref>{{cite web|title=As It Is - DSCVR Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hNy9vlleDk|website=YouTube.com|publisher=DSCVR|access-date=17 June 2015|date=12 February 2015}}</ref> Andy Westhead and Patrick Foley replied to the advertisement and were accepted into the band<ref>{{cite web|title=5 Things You Never Knew About... As It Is|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1au-Bg1GEB0|website=YouTube.com|publisher=[[Rock Sound]]|access-date=5 July 2015|date=29 March 2015}}</ref> along with Benjamin Langford-Biss, who Walters knew from university. The band's name comes from a lyric in a song by the American straight edge hardcore band [[Have Heart]].

Walters began his own career by posting song covers on his personal YouTube channel. After the band's formation, the band as a whole worked on a cover of Fat Lip by [[Sum 41]]. As the band's career started to gain more traction, he posted less often until he finally announced in the video, titled "A New Chapter", that he would go on an undetermined hiatus for the channel and would be focusing his efforts on As It Is. He has since made clear that he has no intention of returning to YouTube.

The band played local shows for the first couple of years before their first few tours shortly after releasing their fourth EP ''This Mind of Mine'', touring the UK and Europe. The band received a large response from these tours and signed to Fearless Records in October 2014, becoming the first UK band to sign to the label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/as-it-is-have-become-the-first-uk-band-to-sign-to-fearless-records.-like-ev|title=As It Is Have Become The First UK Band To Sign To Fearless Records.

The band's debut full-length, ''[[Never Happy, Ever After]]'' was released on 20 April 2015 in Europe and the following day in the United States under [[Fearless Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Never Happy, Ever After on Amazon|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Never-Happy-Ever-After-As/dp/B00U8EDSF2|website=Amazon.co.uk|publisher=Amazon|access-date=5 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629150915/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Never-Happy-Ever-After-As/dp/B00U8EDSF2|archive-date=29 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="Alternative Press Concrete Article">{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Tyler|title=As It Is stream "Concrete" from new album, 'Never Happy, Ever After'|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/as_it_is_stream_concrete_from_new_album_never_happy_ever_after|website=AltPress.com|publisher=Alternative Press|access-date=5 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626153448/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/as_it_is_stream_concrete_from_new_album_never_happy_ever_after|archive-date=26 June 2015|date=3 March 2015}}</ref> Three singles were released from the album, "Dial Tones",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Emily|title=As It Is Debut New Single and Video For Dial Tones|url=http://www.kerrang.com/27297/debut-new-single-video-dial-tones/|website=Kerrang.com|publisher=Kerrang!|access-date=5 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627070821/http://www.kerrang.com/27297/debut-new-single-video-dial-tones/|archive-date=27 June 2015|date=20 January 2015}}</ref> "Concrete"<ref name="Alternative Press Concrete Article" /> and "Cheap Shots & Setbacks".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Emily|title=As It Is Unveil New Song, Cheap Shots & Set Backs|url=http://www.kerrang.com/30270/unveil-new-song-cheap-shots-set-backs/|website=Kerrang.com|publisher=Kerrang!|access-date=5 July 2015|archive-date=27 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627070828/http://www.kerrang.com/30270/unveil-new-song-cheap-shots-set-backs/|date=14 April 2015}}</ref>

===''okay.'', line-up changes, and ''The Great Depression'' (2017–2020)===
Their second album, ''[[Okay (album)|okay.]]'', was released on 20 January 2017.

In October 2017, Westhead departed from the band due to "feelings and differences [that] had been building up."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/as_it_is_part_ways_with_guitarist_andy_westhead|title=As It Is part ways with guitarist Andy Westhead - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref>

The band recorded their third record in Texas in January 2018, and started teasing new music in May with cryptic messages on their social media accounts.

They released their third album, ''The Great Depression'', on 10 August 2018, which included the singles "The Wounded World", "The Stigma (Boys Don't Cry)", and "The Reaper".

They were approached by [[Hopeless Records]] to be a part of the label's new annual compilation series of albums entitled "Songs That Saved My Life", a compilation in which bands cover a song that had a significant impact on them as a whole or individually. The song that As It Is chose was [[Such Great Heights]], which was originally made famous by the indie rock band [[The Postal Service]]. The album was released on 9 November 2018. Lead singer Patty Walters was also interviewed by Hopeless Records as a part of a campaign to get kids and teens to seek out help if they are going through personal struggles, which was also the overall message of the album.

At their show at the 02 Forum Kentish Town in [[London]] on 1 December 2018, the unofficial world record for the most crowd surfers during an hour-long was set. Over 300 people crowd surfed during the band's set, and over 600 crowd surfed across the sets of all four bands on the bill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/as-it-is-london-show-over-the-weekend-broke-a-record|title=As It Is' London Show Over The Weekend Broke A Record - News|website=Rocksound.tv}}</ref>
