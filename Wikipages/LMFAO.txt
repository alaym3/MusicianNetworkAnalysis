==History==

===2006–2010: Early years and ''Party Rock''===
{{main|Party Rock}}
LMFAO began their career in 2006 as part of the [[electro house]] club scene in Los Angeles, which at the time featured DJ/producers like [[Steve Aoki]] and [[Adam Goldstein]].<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JacobsonN.html |title=Interview with Neil Jacobson (part 1) |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=18 June 2012 |access-date=26 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314152509/http://hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_jacobsonn.html |archive-date=March 14, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The duo started building a local buzz through its shows and radio play.<ref name="hitquarters"/> Once it had recorded some demos, Redfoo's best friend [[will.i.am]] introduced them to [[Interscope]] head [[Jimmy Iovine]] who gave the green light for them to be signed to Interscope/will.i.am Music.<ref name="hitquarters"/> Interscope A&R and will.i.am manager Neil Jacobson told [[HitQuarters]] that the demos sounded like "finished records" and that so little artist development work was needed it was essentially a "[[turnkey]] operation" for the label.<ref name="hitquarters"/> According to LMFAO they were originally going to call themselves ''Sexy Dudes'', but changed their name to LMFAO after telling SkyBlu's grandmother.

LMFAO released ''[[Party Rock|Party Rock EP]]'' on the [[iTunes]] music store on July 1, 2008 and released its full album on July 7, 2009. The album charted at number 33 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number two on the U.S. Dance Chart. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described ''Party Rock'' as "14 virtually interchangeable odes to night life."<ref name="interscopelatimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.interscope.com/artist/news/default.aspx?nid=22083&aid=1116 |title=LMFAO df Los Angeles Times Review |publisher=Interscope.com |access-date=April 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623083634/http://www.interscope.com/artist/news/default.aspx?nid=22083&aid=1116 |archive-date=June 23, 2012 }}</ref> Its first single was "[[I'm in Miami Bitch]]", which was released in December 2008, and peaked at number 51 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 37 in Canada. In early 2009, a little known DJ/producer 'DJ Inphinity' created a bootleg using the Silvio Ecomo remix of [[Chuckie (DJ)|DJ Chuckie]]'s 2008 hit "Let the Bass Kick" and the [[a cappella]] of LMFAO, creating "[[Let the Bass Kick in Miami Bitch|Bass Kick in Miami]]". The bootleg was spread across the internet and became a massive success at the Miami [[Winter Music Conference]] 2009. Weeks later the song became the theme song for the [[E!]] television show ''[[Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami]]'' and "[[Get Crazy (song)|Get Crazy]]" was used for the television show ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' in 2009. LMFAO were a featured storyline on MTV's ''[[The Real World: Cancun]]'' in August 2009, which covered the group's appearance in [[Cancun]] during 2009 [[Spring break]]. That same year, LMFAO was featured in [[The Crystal Method]]'s song "[[Sine Language]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecrystalmethod.com/index.php/news/sine_language_music_video_contest/ |title=The Crystal Method |publisher=The Crystal Method |date=2010-06-03 |access-date=2012-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422002102/http://thecrystalmethod.com/index.php/news/sine_language_music_video_contest/ |archive-date=2012-04-22 }}</ref>

===2010–2012: International breakthrough, ''Sorry for Party Rocking'', and ''Rockin' Eve''===
{{main|Sorry for Party Rocking}}
In 2010, LMFAO was featured in [[David Guetta]]'s song "[[Gettin' Over You]]", which was an international hit, peaking in the top ten in eleven countries and at number one in three of them, including in the United Kingdom. It also peaked at number 31 on the U.S. Hot 100 and at number 12 in Canada.

In March 2011, LMFAO released their official music video "Party Rock Anthem" featuring Lauren Bennett and GoonRock, which has over 2 billion views on YouTube.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records|year=2014|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/198 198]|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/198}}</ref>

The duo then recorded their second album, ''[[Sorry for Party Rocking]]'' late in 2010 and released it on June 17, 2011, in the U.S. The first single taken from the album, "[[Party Rock Anthem]]", was released on January 25, 2011. It features British singer [[Lauren Bennett]] formerly of the girl pop group [[Paradiso Girls]] and producer [[GoonRock]], and showcases the [[Melbourne Shuffle]] dance style in its popular video. The song is so far the most successful of their career, peaking at number one in the United States,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/469349/lmfao-brings-the-party-to-top-of-hot-100|title=LMFAO Brings the 'Farty' to Top of Hot 100|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|first=Gary|last=Trust|date=2011-07-06|access-date=2011-07-06}}</ref> Canada, the UK, and over ten other countries, as well being in the top ten in many others.

They performed in [[Singapore]], [[Manila]], [[Taipei]], and [[Kuala Lumpur]], among other cities.<ref name="asiantour">{{cite web |url=http://mistazam.blogspot.com/2011/01/lmfao-live-in-malaysia-philippines.html  |title=LMFAO Live in Malaysia, Philippines & Singapore|publisher=mistazam.com |access-date=April 22, 2011}}</ref> On June 30, 2011, LMFAO performed a set on the [[Isle of MTV]] 2011 Malta Special on the Fosos (Granaries) in [[Floriana]], [[Malta]], in front of a crowd of 50,000, together with [[Far East Movement]] and [[Snoop Dogg]].<ref name="isleofmtv2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110630/local/spectacular-isle-of-mtv-on-the-granaries.373247  |title=Spectacular Isle of MTV on the Granaries|publisher=timesofmalta.com |access-date=July 2, 2011}}</ref>

Furthermore, the group LMFAO focused on growing its Party Rock clothing line and was one of the opening acts for American singer [[Kesha]]'s [[Get Sleazy Tour]], along with Spank Rock and Natalia Kills, for the third and fifth legs of the tour in 2011. On August 13, 2011, it opened for [[Kesha]] at the St-Jean-sur-Richelieu [[hot air balloon festival]] in Quebec, Canada, attracting close to 100,000 fans.

On August 29, 2011, LMFAO filmed a video for its new single "Sexy and I Know It" in Venice Beach, California.<ref>[http://www.yovenice.com/2011/08/30/lmfoa-sexy-and-i-know-it-video-and-interview/ LMFAO "Sexy and I Know it" Video and Interview].

Actors [[Simon Rex]] and [[Wilmer Valderrama]], Andrew Furr (as Shufflebot) and mixed martial artist [[Alistair Overeem]] also make cameo appearances. The song achieved success similar to that of "Party Rock Anthem", topping charts all over the world. "Sexy and I Know It" became the duo's second number one in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The group guested on the first elimination show of the 13th series of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' on September 20, 2011, which was broadcast live.

In October 2011, LMFAO's song "Party Rock Anthem" was used in a [[Halloween]] house light show when a Southern California man timed lights to the popular song. After the YouTube video of the house went viral, even receiving news coverage, the duo visited the house and recorded a Kia commercial featuring the house.<ref name="kiasoulshuffle2011">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPgr18n6MJA |title=The Kia Soul Shuffle Slam with LMFAO at Halloween House |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref> In December 2011, the group played "Party Rock Anthem" on live national television broadcast of "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve".

On February 5, 2012, the group appeared with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] at [[Super Bowl XLVI]] during the [[List of Super Bowl halftime shows|Bridgestone Halftime Show]]. It performed during her song "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]", which contained a mash-up with "[[Party Rock Anthem]]" and "[[Sexy and I Know It]]".

On September 21, 2012, the duo released a statement announcing their hiatus.

SkyBlu said, "Well, you know, first of all, we're not breaking up. I know that for sure. We're family and stuff, so it's always love ...
