'''Wristmeetrazor''' is an American [[metalcore]] band that originally started as a solo project in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 2017. Members are now located in Louisville, KY, Las Vegas, NV, Springfield, VA, and Newark, DE.

==History==
The band started out as a project by guitarist Jonah Thorne, taking its name from a [[Usurp Synapse]] song.<ref name="rev">{{cite web |last1=Pessaro |first1=Fred |title=5 Artists You Need to Know: October 2018 |url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/5-artists-you-need-know-october-2018 |website=revolvermag.com |publisher=Revolver Magazine |accessdate=January 15, 2019}}</ref> With the release of a demo, Thorne would recruit bassist Justin Fornof and drummer Zach Wilbourn.<ref name="idioteq">{{cite web |last1=Kaminski |first1=Karol |title=A Vessel for Suffering: Virigina's Metalcore Screamo Pack WristMeetRazor Premiere an Excellent Debut LP! |url=https://idioteq.com/vessel-suffering-virginias-screamo-metalcore-pack-wristmeetrazor-premiere-excellent-debut-lp-talk-godbut-sky-empty/ |website=idioteq.com |publisher=Idioteq |accessdate=January 15, 2019}}</ref> Taking heavy influence from the early-2000s hardcore scene, the trio would then issue two extended plays ''I Talk to God...'' and ''...But the Sky is Empty'' digitally through their bandcamp page and on various physical formats through a variety of labels. As a result of the members living in different states in the country, each member of the band had to record their parts at separate locations, emailing them to each other in order for them to be mixed.<ref name="cvlt"/>

After recruiting new drummer Bryan Prosser, the band signed onto [[Prosthetic Records]] in 2018 for the release of their debut full-length ''Misery Never Forgets''.<ref name="LG">{{cite web |last1=n/a |title=Wristmeetrazor sign with Prosthetic Records, debut new song |url=https://lambgoat.com/news/30670/Wristmeetrazor-sign-with-Prosthetic-Records-debut-new-song |website=lambgoat.com |publisher=Lamb Goat |accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref> Featuring artwork from [[Pg.99]] vocalist Chris Taylor,<ref name="cvlt">{{cite web |last1=Yoe |first1=Adam |title=Let It Bleed: Cutting Deeply with Wristmeetrazor |url=https://www.cvltnation.com/let-bleed-cutting-deeply-wristmeetrazor/ |website=cvltnation.com |publisher=Cvlt Nation |accessdate=January 15, 2019}}</ref> the album was released digitally on January 18, 2019, with physical releases being issued on CD and LP formats.
