Originally, drummer [[Alicia Warrington]] had been {{Proper name|Uh Huh Her}}'s third member; however, she separated from the group early on.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/performer-profile-on-uh-huh-her-59484|title=Performer profile on Uh Huh Her|website=Axs.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref>

The band has mentioned several times changing their name to UHH (pronunciation "U-H-H"), as opposed to the full "Uh Huh Her", believing the original name looks good in written form, but is awkward to pronounce.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkVImzIS9Hg|title=Uh Huh Her - Radio Interview - 2013 part 1/3|last=Niki Lipova|date=April 24, 2013|access-date=August 5, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> It is unclear at this time if the name change will be made official at any point.<ref name="autostraddle.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/uh-huh-her-camila-grey-adam-lambert-nocturnes-interview-112668/|title=Uh Huh Her's Camila Grey: The Autostraddle Interview|date=October 3, 2011|website=Autostraddle.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref>

==Biography==
=== 2006&ndash;2009: ''I See Red'' and ''Common Reaction'' ===
The band formed in 2006, when Camilia Grey and Leisha Hailey met at a paint ball game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.gopride.com/news/interview.cfm/articleid/300681|title=Uh Huh Her: I'm a night owl. I tend to come alive at night and that is where I am the most creative. I am a very nocturnal person.|first=Jerry|last=Nunn|website=Chicago.gopride.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref>  The band recorded their first project ''I See Red'' EP, released on July 24, 2007,<ref name="discogs.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Uh-Huh-Her-I-See-Red/release/5414408|title=Uh Huh Her - I See Red|website=Discogs|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref> in Camila Grey's house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/277595/uh-huh-her/biography|title=Uh Huh Her - Biography - Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref>

''I See Red'' includes a version of the song "Say So", the first song the band wrote together, in which Hailey sang lead vocals (the later release of the song had Grey singing lead).<ref name="discogs.com"/><ref name="msopr080708"/> ''I See Red'' was initially released digitally with limited amounts of hard copies, with a bonus track available on hard copies and on iTunes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/19473-introducing-uh-huh-her|title=Introducing Uh Huh Her|date=July 23, 2007|website=Afterelln.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref>

{{Proper name|Uh Huh Her}}'s debut album ''Common Reaction'' was released on August 19, 2008, after a delay.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Raftery|first=Elizabeth|date=August 1, 2008|title=Uh Huh Her: Opposites Attract|url=https://blastmagazine.com/2008/08/01/uh-huh-her-opposites-attract/|magazine=Blast magazine|access-date=November 15, 2020}}</ref> Both "Explode" and "Say So" were released for a second time on the full-length album as both members felt the songs deserved to be more polished.

''Common Reaction'', which was recorded in Westside Pacific Studio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/common-reaction-mw0000785456/user-reviews|title=Common Reaction - Uh Huh Her - User Reviews - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref> charted at number 9 on the [[Billboard Top Heatseekers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/277595/uh-huh-her/chart|title=Uh Huh Her - Chart history - Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref>

Uh Huh Her was dropped from Nettwerk in 2009, with Camilia Grey stating that they still owe them money.<ref name="chicagonow.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-at-night/2014/05/interview-uh-huh-her-camila-grey-lincoln-hall-chicago/|title=A Q&A Interview With Camila Grey - An Uh Huh Her Concert Preview (Tuesday, May 6 at Lincoln Hall)|website=Chicagonow.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref>

===2010&ndash;2012: label change, new music, and touring===

Since making the switch to an independent label, a lack of funding (and Grey's tour with Adam Lambert)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/camila-grey-adam-lambert-35031/|title=Adam Lambert Snags UHH's Camila Grey for Magical Gay Mystery Tour|date=February 28, 2010|website=Autostraddle.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref> put a halt on the immediate release of the second full-length album. To fill the gap between albums, the band released their second EP, ''Black and Blue'' on April 19, 2011. The release fell just prior to the band's second major tour,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/more/82617-camila-grey-talks-touring-with-adam-lambert-and-whats-up-for-uh-huh-her-in-2011|title=Camila Grey talks touring with Adam Lambert and what's up for Uh Huh Her in 2011 - AfterEllen|date=December 20, 2010|website=Afterellen.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref> so that they would have new material for fans to purchase.  They also headlined at the SXSW Music Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msopr.com/press-releases/uh-huh-her-electro-indie-duo-release-black-and-blue-ep-sxsw-and-u-s-tour-underway-never-the-same-premieres-on-nylonmag/|title=UH HUH HER: ELECTRO-INDIE DUO RELEASE 'BLACK AND BLUE' EP; SXSW, AND U.S. TOUR UNDERWAY; "NEVER THE SAME" PREMIERES ON NYLONMAG. - Mitch Schneider Organization|website=Msopr.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref> The entire six-track EP was recorded and produced in under two weeks.<ref name="autostraddle.com"/>

Nocturnes, {{Proper name|Uh Huh Her}}'s second studio album, was eventually released on October 11, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Uh-Huh-Her-Nocturnes/release/4130695|title=Uh Huh Her - Nocturnes|website=Discogs|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref> Grey wrote "Human Nature", "Wake To Sleep" and "Darkness Is" independently ("Darkness Is" was originally titled "Never Absolute") while Hailey wrote "Debris" on her own,<ref name="autostraddle.com"/> and she has said on several occasions that the song is about phone sex. "Wake To Sleep" was written about the process of making the album, and refers to the differing sleeping habits of the band members.<ref name="autostraddle.com"/> "Criminal" was written about the band's experience splitting with their former record label and managers.  Uh Huh Her made their first TV appearance when they appeared on Jimmy Kimmel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msopr.com/press-releases/uh-huh-her-watch-the-electro-pop-group-perform-%E2%80%9Cmarstorm%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cdisdain%E2%80%9D-on-abc-tv%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cjimmy-kimmel-live%E2%80%9D/|title=UH HUH HER: Watch The Electro-Pop Group Perform "Marstorm" and "Disdain" On ABC-TV's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" - Mitch Schneider Organization|website=Msopr.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref>

The third EP was released on December 11, 2012, and as a cdr exclusively sold through Amazon,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/EP3-Uh-Huh-Her/dp/B00AFDBYHU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1501623187&sr=8-1&keywords=uh+huh+her+ep3|title=EP3|website=Amazon.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref> and features reworked, acoustic versions of "Debris", "I See Red", "Black and Blue", "Not a Love Song", "Common Reaction", and "Philosophy," with Camila Grey stating ".....The EP is different because it was recorded with the intention of being acoustic.  We essentially took old songs and revamped them and recorded some live, some with a full band, and some with just a piano and vocal.  Its unique because we're known for being really electro, and in this case it's the opposite, very organic and pared down."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amusicblogyea.com/2012/11/12/gimme-your-answers-an-interview-w-uh-huh-her/|title=Gimme Your Answers: An Interview w/ Uh Huh Her – AMBY|website=amusicblogyea.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref> In this version of "Debris", Grey sings lead vocals (as opposed to Hailey, who wrote the song).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uhhuhher.com/ep3-ep-2012/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821045731/http://www.uhhuhher.com/ep3-ep-2012/ |archive-date=August 21, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===2016&ndash;present===
In 2016, Camilia Grey and Leisha Hailey decided to take a break from Uh Huh Her, stating ".....We decided after our "Future Souls" tour to take time off to pursue other endeavors. You could officially say we are on a "hiatus" of sorts. We feel like we needed to take this break to bring some new magic into our music and give our other loves some attention...Leisha has been back to acting, Camila has joined another indie band called "Summer Moon" and is working on many solo side projects and DJing and Josh is currently a Zen Buddha Yogi Master teaching others the art of meditation and mindfulness in addition to being the best drummer ever......"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/music/527687-leisha-hailey-camila-grey-take-break-uhh|title=Leisha Hailey and Camila Grey Take a Break from UHH|date=December 21, 2016|website=Afterellen.com|access-date=August 5, 2018}}</ref>
