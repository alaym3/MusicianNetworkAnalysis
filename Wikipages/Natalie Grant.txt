She received the [[Gospel Music Association]]'s [[GMA Dove Awards|Dove Award]] for [[GMA Dove Award for Vocalist of the Year|Female Vocalist of the Year]] four consecutive years (2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009), and again in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gospelmusic.org/newsmedia/pressRoom_detail.aspx?iid=42151&tid=33|title= Gospel Music Association Announces Initial Hosts and Performers for 41st Annual Dove Awards, To Be Held on April 21, 2010 at Nashville's Famed Grand Ole Opry House|access-date= January 8, 2010|date= December 23, 2009|publisher= gospelmusic.org|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100125055912/http://www.gospelmusic.org/newsmedia/pressRoom_detail.aspx?iid=42151&tid=33|archive-date= January 25, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> She has also been nominated for eight [[Grammy Awards]] (2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020).

== Early life ==

Grant was born December 21, 1971 in Seattle, Washington.<ref name="Star"/> She enrolled at [[Northwest University (United States)|Northwest College]] (Now Northwest University) in Kirkland, Washington, studying to be a schoolteacher.<ref name="PEAG">{{cite web|title=Living the Dream|url=http://www.pe.ag.org/conversations2004/4714_grant.cfm|work=Assemblies of God USA|publisher=Pentecostal Evangel|access-date=August 29, 2012}}</ref> She reportedly figured that her musical gifts were merely for sharing with her local church until she learned how to find God's true calling for her life, and so switched directions and began a career in Christian music.<ref name="PEAG" />

== Career ==

Grant first started in contemporary Christian music when she auditioned for the traveling music group [[Truth (American band)|Truth]].<ref name="PEAG"/> Later she moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue her solo career.<ref name="Star">{{cite web|title=Natalie Grant Biography|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Grant,_Natalie/Biography/|publisher=Starpulse.com|access-date=August 29, 2012}}</ref>  There she signed with [[Benson Records]] in 1997 and began working on her self-titled debut which was released in 1999. She left Benson for [[Pamplin Music]] soon after and released the album ''[[Stronger (Natalie Grant album)|Stronger]]'' in 2001. She then ended up at [[Curb Records]] after Pamplin folded, where she has made five solo albums as of 2012, starting with ''[[Deeper Life]]'' in 2003. ''[[Awaken (Natalie Grant album)|Awaken]]'' was her breakthrough success, in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://nataliegrant.com/about/|publisher=NatalieGrant.com|access-date=August 23, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110222085733/http%3A//nataliegrant.com/about/|archive-date=February 22, 2011}}</ref> It was [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified]] gold. It was followed by ''[[Love Revolution (Natalie Grant album)|Love Revolution]]'' on August 24, 2010<ref>[http://nataliegrant.com/2010/06/17/new-project-and-nationwide-love-revolution/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013245/http://nataliegrant.com/2010/06/17/new-project-and-nationwide-love-revolution/ |date=June 22, 2010 }}</ref> and ''[[Hurricane (Natalie Grant album)|Hurricane]]'' on October 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=Natalie Grant |url=http://nataliegrant.com/2013/07/17/hurricane-set-to-release-october-15th/ |title='Hurricane' Set To Release October 15th |publisher=Natalie Grant |access-date=May 13, 2014}}</ref>

Grant released three albums between 1999 and 2003, although the majority of her hits came later in her career. She has since reported being unhappy with the way she was imaged by her early record label which marketed her partly on her looks, and says of her first record, "It wasn't me at all either."<ref name="beliefnet">{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/wholenotes/2011/12/a-conversation-with-four-time-gma-female-vocalist-of-the-year-natalie-grant.html#|title=A conversation with four-time GMA Female Vocalist of the Year Natalie Grant|last=Bonham|first=Chad|publisher=beliefnet|access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref> However, she credits her early albums with having been necessary to her progressing and growing into an artist that takes control of such decisions, starting with her first widely successful album, ''Awaken''.<ref name="beliefnet" />

Another factor that was essential to her later successes was a life-altering trip to India in 2004. Not only did this trip inspire her charitable pursuits, "but it brought a new passion and direction to her music." Instead of focusing only on what song might be a hit, Grant reports that she now focuses on songs that will inspire, give hope, and motivate others to make their lives matter.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Natalie Grant Interview|url=http://www.shurenotes.com/how18/nataliegrant.html|work=Notes for Houses of Worship|publisher=Shure|access-date=August 23, 2012|date=October 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117055346/http://www.shurenotes.com/how18/nataliegrant.html|archive-date=January 17, 2008}}</ref>

There have been other noteworthy events along the way. She wrote a book entitled ''The Real Me'' in 2005.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Real Me [Paperback]|isbn = 0849908825|last1 = Grant|first1 = Natalie|year = 2005}}</ref>  She toured on the Speaking Louder Than Before tour with [[Bebo Norman]] and [[Jeremy Camp]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.951shinefm.com/Dynamic/DynCon.aspx?cid=52&lpk=262|title=Shine FM::Events|access-date=January 8, 2010|date=January 8, 2010|publisher=951shinefm.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707071040/http://www.951shinefm.com/Dynamic/DynCon.aspx?cid=52&lpk=262|archive-date=July 7, 2011}}</ref> She contributed the song "Breathe On Me" to [[Crystal Aikin]]'s [[Crystal Aikin (album)|self-titled debut album]]. She was a speaker and performer on the Revolve Tour, a conference for teen girls from Women of Faith. She toured with award-winning, multi-platinum selling Billboard magazine's Artist of The Decade [[MercyMe]] in April 2011. Also, in October 2011 she starred in the Gospel Music Channel (GMC) made-for-television movie ''Decision''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bonham|first=Chad|title=Dove-award winning artist Natalie Grant makes film debut on Gospel Music Channel Sunday night|url=http://blog.beliefnet.com/wholenotes/2011/10/dove-award-winning-artist-natalie-grant-makes-film-debut-on-gospel-music-channel-sunday-night.html|publisher=Beliefnet|access-date=August 23, 2012|date=October 2011}}</ref>

== Personal life ==

In pursuing her music career, Grant moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she now lives with her Canadian producer husband, [[Bernie Herms]], and their three daughters; Grace and Isabella (born 2007)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/Twins_For_Natalie/26341/p1/|title= Twins for Natalie|access-date= September 14, 2008|date= March 1, 2007|publisher= crossRhythms.co.uk}}</ref> and Sadie (born 2010)<ref>{{cite web|author=Natalie Grant |url=http://nataliegrant.com/2010/12/17/natalie-grant-bernie-herms-welcome-newborn-baby-girl-sadie-rose-herms/ |title=& Bernie Herms Welcome Newborn Baby Girl- Sadie Rose Herms |publisher=Natalie Grant |date=December 17, 2010 |access-date=May 13, 2014}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The 700 Club]]'', Natalie revealed that she suffered from [[bulimia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/700club/Guests/bios/Natalie_Grant042408.aspx |title=Natalie Grant: Her Heart Revealed |publisher=Cbn.com |access-date=July 11, 2013}}</ref> She says God helped her get over her eating disorder. She later wrote a book in 2005 titled ''The Real Me: Being the Girl God Sees'', about her struggle and how she overcame it.

== Philanthropy ==

Grant is involved in campaigning against [[human trafficking]]. She was affected by an episode of ''[[Law & Order]]'' that dealt with the topic, and began to do research. Her studies led her and her husband to travel to India to witness the [[red-light districts]] and what is being done to stop them. That experience changed the trajectory of Natalie's life and reportedly changed the way she approaches her music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/Artists/Grant_Natalie.aspx |title=CBNmusic&nbsp;â€“ Natalie Grant |publisher=Cbn.com |access-date=July 11, 2013}}</ref>

In 2005 Grant founded The Home Foundation, which has since evolved into Abolition International, an international organization with the aim of eradicating sex trafficking through aftercare accreditation, advocacy, and education and provision of restoration homes for victims of sex trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://abolitioninternational.org/who-we-are/|work=Abolition International: A Home Foundation Initiative|access-date=February 1, 2014}}</ref>

On October 23, 2012, Grant received the 2012 Bishop Ketteler Award for Social Justice from the Sisters of Divine Providence, who honored her for her work against human trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdpsisters.org/ketteler-award/2012-natalie-grant |title=2012: Natalie Grant &#124; Sisters of Divine Providence |publisher=Cdpsisters.org |date=October 23, 2012 |access-date=June 20, 2014}}</ref>
