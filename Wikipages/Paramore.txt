'''Paramore''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Franklin, Tennessee]], formed in 2004. The band currently consists of lead vocalist [[Hayley Williams]], guitarist [[Taylor York]] and drummer [[Zac Farro]]. Williams and Farro are founding members of the group, while York, a high school friend of the original lineup, joined in 2007. The band are signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]], a subsidiary of [[Atlantic Records]], both owned by [[Warner Music Group]]. Williams is separately signed to Atlantic as she was scouted when she was a teenager, and they were the only label to let her stay in the band instead of going solo, but Atlantic said the rest of the band had to sign to FBR. She is also the only member to appear on all five of Paramore's studio albums.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frank |first=Alex |url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/06/29/paramore-hayley-williams-cover-story-interview |title=Adult Emotions |publisher=[[FADER]] |date=June 29, 2017 |access-date=October 16, 2021}}</ref>

The group released its debut album ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'' in 2005, with the album reaching number four on the [[UK Rock Chart]] in 2009 and number thirty on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Chart]] in 2006.

The band's second album, ''[[Riot!]]'', was released in 2007. Thanks to the success of the singles "[[Misery Business]]", "[[Crushcrushcrush]]", and "[[That's What You Get]]", ''Riot!'' was a mainstream success and was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] in the United States. Paramore then received a [[Best New Artist]] nomination at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards|2008 Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/paramore|title=Paramore|date=2014-03-17|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> Their 2009 follow-up, ''[[Brand New Eyes]]'', is the band's second-highest charting album to date, landing at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 175,000 first week sales. It produced the top-forty single "[[The Only Exception]]" and went platinum in Ireland and the UK, as well as gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caulfield |first=Keith |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/barbra-streisand-ninth-no-1-89775 |title=Barbra Streisand has ninth No.&nbsp;1 album |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=October 7, 2009 |access-date=August 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024090309/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/barbra-streisand-ninth-no-1-89775 |archive-date=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>

Following the departure of [[Josh Farro|Josh]] and Zac Farro in 2010, the band released their [[Paramore (album)|self-titled fourth album]] in 2013. It gave the band their first number one on the US ''Billboard'' 200 and was also the number one album in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fueledbyramen.com/news/paramore-album-debuts-1-85151|title=Paramore Album Debuts At #1 |publisher=FueledByRamen.com |date=April 17, 2013 |access-date=April 26, 2013}}</ref> It included the singles "[[Still Into You]]" and "[[Ain't It Fun (Paramore song)|Ain't It Fun]]", with the latter winning the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] for Williams and York as songwriters, making it Paramore's first [[Grammy Award]] win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/hayley-williams|title=Hayley Williams|date=2014-03-17|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> The band's lineup changed once again after this album cycle with bassist [[Jeremy Davis]] leaving the band near the end of 2015 and former drummer Zac Farro rejoining the band in 2017. Their fifth studio album, ''[[After Laughter]]'', was released later that year.

==History==
===2002–2004: Formation and early years===
In 2002, at age 13, vocalist [[Hayley Williams]] moved from her hometown [[Meridian, Mississippi]] to [[Franklin, Tennessee]], where she met brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro at a weekly supplemental program for home-schooled students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |title=Interview with Jeff Hanson |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=September 20, 2010 |access-date=March 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103105151/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |archive-date=November 3, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="AMG">{{cite web|last=Leahey| first=Andrew| title= Biography| website= [[Allmusic]]| url= {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p729547|pure_url=yes}} | access-date= August 16, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-08-30-paramore_N.htm | title =Pop-punkers Paramore find a niche | author =[[Brian Mansfield]] | newspaper =[[USA Today]] | date =August 20, 2007}}</ref> Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with [[Brett Manning]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Products by Brett Manning|url=http://justforsingers.com/products-by-brett-manning/|publisher=JustForSingers.com|access-date=January 20, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Ten Things About...

Williams was originally signed to Atlantic Records as a solo artist in 2003. She had been introduced to Atlantic A&R Tom Storms by Kent Marcus and Jim Zumwalt, lawyers of managers Dave Steunebrink and Richard Williams, and then eventually signed to Atlantic by [[Jason Flom]]. Steunebrink and Richard Williams had originally discovered and signed her to a production deal that was later bought out by Atlantic. The original plan of the label was to turn her into a pop singer, but Williams resisted, saying that she wanted to play alternative rock music with a band.<ref name="hitquarters"/> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]] the band's A&R at Atlantic, Steve Robertson, said, "She wanted to make sure that we didn't look at her as some straight to Top 40 pop princess. She wanted to make sure that she and her band got the chance to show what they can do as a rock band writing their own songs."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Steve_Robertson_Interview.html |title=Interview With Steve Robertson |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=November 9, 2009 |access-date=May 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416082717/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Steve_Robertson_Interview.html |archive-date=April 16, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Label president Julie Greenwald and the label staff decided to go with her wishes. The original management team for the band was Dave Steunebrink, [[Creed (band)|Creed]] manager [[Jeff Hanson]], and Hanson's assistant Mark Mercado.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |title=Interview with Jeff Hanson |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=September 20, 2010 |access-date=October 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103105151/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |archive-date=November 3, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band was officially formed by [[Josh Farro]] ([[lead guitar]]/[[backing vocals]]), [[Zac Farro]] ([[drums]]), Davis ([[bass guitar]]) and Williams ([[lead vocals]]) in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paramore.net/about#band_history|title=History|publisher=paramore.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510222857/http://www.paramore.net/about#band_history|archive-date=May 10, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=December 31, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum ([[rhythm guitar]]).<ref name="AP 08" /> When Davis showed up, he was stunned to find out the drummer was only twelve years old. He admitted "I had very, very, very, little faith in everyone in the band because of their age. I remember thinking, 'This is not going to work because this kid is way too young,' but that first day of practice was amazing. I knew we were on to something."<ref name="Biography Today" /> According to Williams, the name "Paramore" came from the maiden name of the mother of one of their first bass players.<ref name="Ten Things About... Paramore" /> Once the group learned the meaning of the homophone "[[wikt:paramour|paramour]]" ("secret lover"), they decided to adopt the name, using the ''Paramore'' spelling.<ref name="Euro" />

Paramore was originally supposed to release their music on Atlantic Records, but the label's marketing department decided it would be better for the image of the band to not have them attached to a major label. Instead, they released their music through the niche label [[Fueled by Ramen]].<ref name="hitquarters"/> [[Lyor Cohen]], the head of [[Warner Music Group]], had already identified Fueled by Ramen as a label they should partner with. It was decided the rock label would make an ideal match for Paramore.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> According to Robertson, when the band was presented to Fueled by Ramen's CEO John Janick, "he got the vision of the band immediately."<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Janick went to a [[Taste of Chaos]] performance in [[Orlando, Florida]] to see the band perform live. In April 2005, after a smaller private performance at a warehouse, the band was signed to Atlantic Records and Fueled By Ramen.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/><ref name="Trades">{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| subject2= Josh Farro| interviewer= Tony Pascarella| title= Interview: Hayley Williams and Josh Farro of Paramore| date= August 8, 2005| url= http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440| access-date= August 16, 2007| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070213011120/http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440| archive-date= February 13, 2007| df= mdy-all}}</ref>

The band's first song written together was "Conspiracy", which was later used on their debut album. At this time, they were touring the southeast, usually being driven by Williams' parents. She commented that "Back then, I guess we were all thinking, after school, we'll go to the house and practice. It was what we loved to do for fun, and still do! I don't think any of us really knew this would turn out to be what it's become."<ref name="Biography Today"/>

===2005–2006: ''All We Know Is Falling''===

Paramore traveled back to Orlando, Florida, but shortly after arriving, Jeremy Davis left the band, citing personal reasons. The remaining four members of Paramore continued with the album, writing "[[All We Know (Paramore song)|All We Know]]" about his departure, and later deciding to base ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'' around the concept.<ref name="contact-bio" /> The album artwork also reflected Paramore's grief as Hayley Williams explains, "The couch on the cover of ''All We Know is Falling'' with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space."<ref name="Trades"/>

Before touring, the band added John Hembree ([[bass guitar|bass]]) to their lineup to replace Davis.<ref>{{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| interviewer= Jason Schleweis of Crush Music Mag| title= Paramore Interview| date= July 14, 2005| url= http://www.crushmusicmag.com/joomla/interviews/48-paramore-interview-07142005| access-date= October 12, 2007| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719191710/http://www.crushmusicmag.com/joomla/interviews/48-paramore-interview-07142005| archive-date= July 19, 2011| df= mdy-all}}</ref> During that summer, Paramore was featured on the Shira Girl stage of the 2005 [[Warped Tour]].<ref name="Trades"/> After being asked by the band, Jeremy Davis returned to Paramore after five months apart, replacing Hembree.<ref name="altpress.com">{{cite magazine|last1=Karan|first1=Tim|title=Josh Farro "finally tells the truth" about Paramore|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/josh_and_zac_farro_finally_tell_the_truth_about_paramore/|magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=August 7, 2016|date=December 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520052644/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/josh_and_zac_farro_finally_tell_the_truth_about_paramore|archive-date=May 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''All We Know Is Falling'' was released on July 24, 2005, and reached No.&nbsp;30 on the Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. Paramore released "[[Pressure (Paramore song)|Pressure]]" as its first single, with a video directed by [[Shane Drake]], but the song failed to chart. The video featured the band performing in a warehouse, eventually getting sprayed with water sprinklers as the storyline of a conflicted couple occurs. In July, "[[Emergency (Paramore song)|Emergency]]" was released as the second single, the video again reuniting the band with director Shane Drake and featuring Hunter Lamb ([[rhythm guitar]]), who replaced Jason Bynum in December 2005.<ref name="AMG"/> The video for "Emergency" showcased Paramore in another performance, this time fixing the members' bloody costumes. The third single, "All We Know", was released with limited airtime, with the video consisting of a collection of live performances and backstage footage.

During the summer of 2006, Paramore played a portion of Warped Tour, primarily on the [[Volcom]] and [[Hurley International|Hurley]] Stages, and their first night on the Main Stage was at a date in their hometown of Nashville.

In 2007, Lamb left the group to get married, and Paramore continued onward as a quartet.<ref name="AMG"/> Paramore was then named by British magazine ''[[NME]]'' as one of ten bands to watch out for in their "New Noise 2007" feature.<ref name="FBR"/> Paramore was featured in ''Kerrang!'' magazine once more, however, Hayley Williams believed the article was an untrue portrayal of the band, particularly because it focused on her as the main component.

Before work began on the band's next album, Davis was expelled from the band due to "his lack of work ethic and participation in things that Zac, Hayley and I didn’t agree with," according to Josh Farro.

===2009–2011: ''Brand New Eyes'', departure of the Farros, and ''Singles Club''===
In January 2009, Josh Farro spoke about the band's next studio album. Talking to ''Kerrang!'', Farro said: "We're gonna try to [record] it in Nashville. I think writing the album there will inspire us, and then if we record there too it'll be a lot easier since we can sleep in our beds at night rather than in hotels like the other 300 days out of the year! We're not sure who's going to produce the record yet. We did "Decode" with [producer] [[Rob Cavallo]], which was a good experience, but we're looking around and don't want to make any decisions until we have a lot of songs and we know what we're looking for. We really enjoy our live sound and we want a producer who can really capture that."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://paramoreguy.blogspot.com/2009/01/josh-spoke-to-kerrang-about-new-album.html|title=Josh Farro speaks to Kerrang! about 3rd studio album}}</ref> Paramore wrote and completed their third album ''[[Brand New Eyes]]'' in early 2009.

A song called "[[Renegade (Paramore song)|Renegade]]", premiered the day of the announcement, with "Hello Cold World" following on November 7 and "[[In the Mourning]]" on December 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/paramore_to_release_three_new_singles.html |title=Paramore To Release Three New Singles &#124; News |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/473639/paramore-previews-new-song-in-the-mourning|title=Paramore Previews New Song, 'In the Mourning'|work=Billboard|access-date=May 20, 2017}}</ref> In 2011, former member, Josh Farro, formed [[Novel American]].
