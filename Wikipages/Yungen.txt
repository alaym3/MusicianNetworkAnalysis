==Early life==
Clive James Brooks was born on 1 February 1992 and was raised in Herne Hill Estate.<ref name= "EveningStandard"/> Although his lyrics expose the darker side of his childhood, he often expresses gratitude in regards to his upbringing. In an interview with the [[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]], Yungen stated that, "Growing up on an estate was everything to me."<ref name= "EveningStandard"/> Brooks’ friends on the estate nicknamed him ‘Yungen’, which later gave him the inspiration for his stage name.<ref name= "Pause">{{cite web |last1= Gold |first1= Johnson |title= Exclusive Interview: PAUSE Meets Yungen |url= http://pausemag.co.uk/2016/05/exclusive-interview-pause-meets-yungen/ |website= pausemag.co.uk |access-date= February 23, 2018 |date= May 13, 2016}}</ref> From the age of 13 Brooks was inspired by an older cousin to try MC’ing, but his shyness prevented him from seeing it as a potential career.<ref name= "Pause"/> Growing up, Brooks listened to a diverse range of genres, enabling him to draw on a variety of influences in his songs.<ref name="NME Bestie" /> Combining his older sister Charlotte's influence of RnB who can be found on tiktok as Char Fuller and artists such as Jagged Edge, with his father's background as [[Hip hop]] DJ, meant there was a diverse range of music genres inside his house.<ref name="Dazed Digital">{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/35749/1/yungen-the-south-london-rapper-ticking-all-the-boxes|title=The south London rapper ticking all the boxes|last1=Kane|first1=Ashleigh|date=April 28, 2017|website=[[Dazed]]|access-date=February 24, 2017}}</ref> In 2008, at the age of 16, the death of his friend  caused Brooks to change his behaviours and become more mature and responsible, thus, he decided to pursue music as a career.<ref name= "Pause"/> Artists such Wretch 32 and Giggs<ref name="NME Bestie" /> also inspired Yungen to pursue a music career as he could relate to and connect with these artists. Yungen is also an avid supporter of [[Liverpool F.C.]]<ref name= "Liverpool F.C.">{{cite news |last=Raynor|first=Dominic|title=Rapper Yungen constructs his Ultimate Red |url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/features/320913-yungen-reveals-his-ultimate-red|website=Liverpool F.C. |date=October 16, 2018 |access-date=March 5, 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
===2009–2014===
In 2010, Yungen released his first video on [[YouTube]] named 'Hometown'. However, due to its popularity, the video was taken down by the organization. In 2011, the video was re-uploaded on Yungen's original Youtube channel named Yungen TV. The video received interest from [[SB.TV]], founder Jamal Edwards, which led to Yungen's F64 Freestyle video on the channel in 2011.<ref name= "Dazed Digital"/> Yungen has since stated that his shyness as a child prevented him from showcasing his music sooner; before making his first music video he had previously avoided all cameras.<ref name= "Pause"/>

Yungen joined Play Dirty in 2012, and released his mixtape ''Topic of Discussion'' in April 2013.<ref name= "YungenWrapUp">{{cite web |last1= Jama |first1= Maya |title= Maya Jama meets Yungen The Wrap Up |url= http://www.mtv.co.uk/yungen/news/maya-meets-yungen-the-wrap-up |website= [[MTV|mtv.co.uk]] |access-date= March 15, 2018 |date= October 27, 2014}}</ref><ref name= "MixtapeMadness">{{cite web |title= Yungen - Topic of Discussion |url= http://www.mixtapemadness.com/mixtape/yungen/topic-of-discussion |website= mixtapemadness.com}}</ref> He then went on to support Naughty Boy throughout his 2014 worldwide tour, performing across Europe, as well as in the UAE and Australia.<ref name= "CapitalFMNaughtyBoy">{{cite web |title= 10 Interesting Facts You Never Knew About #CapitalJBB Star Yungen |url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/yungen/news/things-you-didnt-know-about-yungen/ |website= www.capitalfm.com |access-date=  March 16, 2018 |date= November 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name= "TheLinkUp Yungen/NaughtyBoy">{{cite web |author= The Link Up Admin |title= Naught Boy Tour Dates |url= http://thelinkup.com/naughty-boy-announces-uk-tournaughtyboymusic/ |website= thelinkup.com |access-date= February 24, 2018 |date= November 9, 2013}}</ref><ref name= "GigSlutz Yungen">{{cite web |last1= Tarr |first1= Matt |title= Interview: Yungen |url= http://www.gigslutz.co.uk/interview-yungen/ |website= gigslutz.co.uk |access-date= February 24, 2018}}</ref> At the same time, Yungen established his clothing line, Forever Yung.<ref name= "The Independent Forever Yung">{{cite web |title= One to watch: Yungen, rapper, 21 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/one-to-watch-yungen-rapper-21-8764275.html |website= [[The Independent]] |access-date= February 24, 2018 |date= August 16, 2013}}</ref> He later independently launched a two part project named ‘Project Black and Red’ in 2014, which featured artists [[Stormzy]], [[Wretch 32]], and [[Krept and Konan]].<ref name= "M Magazine">{{cite web |title= 30 Seconds Interview: Yungen |url= https://www.m-magazine.co.uk/newmusic/30seconds/30-seconds-interview-yungen/ |website= m-magazine.co.uk |access-date= February 23, 2018 |date= January 4, 2014}}</ref>

In 2016, Yungen also gained greater publicity over a verbal disagreement with the rapper [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]] (formerly known as Chipmunk). The argument began when Chip commented on Yungen's MOBO Award nomination, which escalated when each artist wrote and released tracks about the other.
