== Biography ==

=== Pseudonym ===
Hardwell's pseudonym comes from an idea of his father, who translated his surname into Latin and English; "Cor" meaning "heart" and "Put" meaning "well". However, he changed the "heart" to "hard", to make it sound more appealing.<ref name="festicket">Luke Nightingale: [https://www.festicket.com/de/magazine/features/facts-hardwell/ ''8 Facts You Never Knew About Hardwell''] on "Festickets"</ref>

=== Early life and musical beginnings===
Robbert van de Corput was born on 7 January 1988 in Breda, to Anneke and Cor van de Corput. At the age of four, he began taking piano lessons and attended a music school.<ref>[http://edm.com/articles/2016/2/6/22-edm-stars-before-they-became-famous ''A Look at 22 EDM Stars Before They Became Famous''] on "EDM.com"</ref> At the age of twelve, he produced his first songs in the field of electro, while performing as a [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] DJ.<ref>Tristan Landy: [http://stoneyroads.com/2014/07/hardwell-from-too-underground-to-global-spotlight ''Hardwell – From 'Too Underground' To Global Spotlight''] on "Stoney Roads"</ref> At a young age, he was also active in various areas of martial arts, including [[judo]].

Through his participation in various competitions, he became known in Breda's DJ scene. He was influenced by the DJ and producer [[Tiësto]], who is also from Breda.<ref name="timeout">Nisha Shuyi: [https://www.timeout.com/singapore/nightlife/interview-hardwell ''Nisha Shuyi speaks to Hardwell about his music journey and future plans''] on "Timeout"</ref>

As hip-hop became an underground scene, Hardwell changed his genre to commercial electronic dance music. He started producing remixes and uploaded them on several platforms on the Internet. At the age of 14 in 2002,<ref>{{cite tweet |user=Hardwell |number=1060577693488447488 |date=8 November 2018 |title="Bubbling Beats Vol.1" was the first release in 2002 following my Digidance record deal.

[[File:RevealedRecordingsLogo.jpg|140px|thumb|The logo for Hardwell's record label, Revealed Recordings]]

At the end of 2007 Hardwell released the song "Never Knew Love", which was produced as a collaboration with Greatski; the song placed on the official German single-charts.<ref>[https://www.top40.nl/hardwell-greatski/hardwell-greatski-never-knew-love-20184 ''Never Knew Love''] at Top40.nl</ref> Remixes for Gregor Salto's and [[Chuckie (DJ)|Chuckie]]'s "Toys Are" together with Dutch DJ and producer [[R3hab]] as well as a mix of "You Do Not Love Me" by [[Sidney Samson]] and Skitzofrenix in 2008 remained at the top of the dance charts for weeks. Also in 2008, he produced a mash-up of the tracks "Be" by [[Steve Angello]] and [[Laidback Luke]], and "[[Show Me Love (Robin S. song)|Show Me Love]]" by [[Robin S.]].

Hardwell's bootleg with the title "Show Me Love" was played by many DJs and was praised by Laidback Luke and Steve Angello.<ref>[https://dancevalley.com/line-up/hardwell Hardwell] on "Dancevalley"</ref> In December 2008 the two producers released the track as an official cover version of "Show Me Love".

In 2009, Tiësto invited Hardwell to one of his performances. They performed together on the stage, and this exposure in the Netherlands led to gigs on media events, including the Dancevalley Festival, whose official anthem was produced by him under the title of "Twilight Zone".

In 2010 Hardwell founded his own record label, [[Revealed Recordings]], or just Revealed, for the purpose of releasing electronic dance music by young talents.<ref>[http://www.cloud9music.nl/news/2010/hardwell-kicks-off-his-own-imprint-revealed-recordings/ ''Hardwell kicks off his own imprint Revealed Recordings''] on "Cloud9"</ref> He contracted with [[Electronic Dance Music|EDM]] artists, including the duo [[W&W]] as well as his personal friends [[Dannic]] and [[Dyro]]. Each year, Revealed releases a compilation called "Hardwell Presents Revealed", containing tracks released by the label together with Hardwell's own new songs. On the fifth anniversary, a sampler was released containing the 100 most popular tracks, chosen by a vote through Revealed's website.<ref>[http://www.revealedrecordings.com/2015/02/25/vote-your-revealed-top-100-win/ ''Vote Your Revealed Top-100 & Win''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202093800/http://www.revealedrecordings.com/2015/02/25/vote-your-revealed-top-100-win/ |date=2 December 2016}} on "Revealed Recordings"</ref> The top three were "[[Spaceman (Hardwell song)|Spaceman]]" by Hardwell, "Burn" by [[KSHMR]] and [[DallasK]], and "Left Behind" by Paris Blohm and Taylr Renee.<ref>[http://revealedrecordings.com/revealed5years/ "Revealed 5 Years"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306140424/http://revealedrecordings.com/revealed5years/ |date=6 March 2017}} on "Revealed Recordings"</ref>

== Musical style ==
{{Original research|section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Hardwell 2013.jpg|thumb|Hardwell in 2013]]
Hardwell's style can be classified into different subgenres of electro-house music. He describes his starting style as influenced by the hip-hop underground scene. Between 2005 and 2006, he developed his style more commercially and over time his productions were increasingly based on a mix of tech house and dirty Dutch. Around the year 2008, his songs became slower and more commercial. In parallel, he experimented with elements from other genres. During that time, he came up already with build-ups, which were very similar to the big-room genre that had emerged years later. With the release of the single "Feel So High" in 2009, he published a tech-house song that corresponded to the classical progressive house, which was dying out, especially at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.beatport.com/track/feel-so-high-feat-i-fan-extended-mix/968961 |title= Feel So High feat. I-Fan by Hardwell on Beatport |website= [[Beatport]] |access-date= 25 April 2018 }}</ref>

At the beginning of 2010, he joined the growing EDM genre and increased his talent in the area of production with singles like "Move It 2 the Drum" and "Asteroid". In 2011, his first successful singles in the field of electro house appeared with "Zero 76" and "Encoded". With "[[Spaceman (Hardwell song)|Spaceman]]", he co-founded the [[Big room house|big-room]] scene in 2012 and established himself permanently in the subgenre.<ref>Tim Tabens: [http://www.dance-charts.de/201508095842/top-10-die-besten-bigroom-tracks-der-letzten-5-jahre/Seite-2 ''Top-10 der besten Big-Room-Tracks''] on "Dance-Charts"</ref> One year later, his singles "Apollo" and "Never Say Goodbye" gave him a place in the modern progressive house style.{{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Ref needed to clarify track genres}}

On his debut studio album, ''[[United We Are]]'', he used trance music synths for the first time for his track "[[Echo (Hardwell song)|Echo]]" as well as deep house sounds for "Birds Fly".{{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Ref needed to clarify track genres}} In addition, "Chameleon" is based on the jungle-terror genre, which was similar with the W&W single "Get Down". For the first time since "Don't Stop the Madness", "Hollywood" embodies a track corresponded to the dirty-German-music.

Starting from 2015, his songs were increasingly oriented on hardstyle samples. His [[Headhunterz]] collaboration "Nothing Can Hold Us Down" was created almost solely on hardstyle-based sounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} His solo productions "Run Wild" and "What We Need" contain features of this genre too.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He also presented the song "Wake Up Call" at the Biggest Guestlist Festival in Mumbai, which was initially suspected as the collaboration with hardstyle producer [[Atmozfears]], but later was confirmed by Hardwell as a solo production.<ref>[http://www.iaatm.de/hardwell-wiwek-chameleon/ ''Chameleon''] on "iaatm.de"</ref>

His 2016 single "[[No Holding Back (song)|No Holding Back]]" represents his first movement into the UK garage.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The track represents elements of deep and tech house scene as well for the first time since his [[Funkerman]] collaboration "Where Is Here Now".

On 7 January 2017, he released the song "Party Till the Daylight", which was Hardwell's debut bass house production.<ref>Jens Ophälders: [http://www.dance-charts.de/201701098182/hardwell-party-till-the-daylight-free-download ''Geschenk an seine Fans: Hardwell – Party Till The Daylight » &#x5B;Free Download&#x5D;''] on "Dance-Charts"</ref> At the Ultra Music Festival, he premiered his first [[future bass]] single, "[[Creatures of the Night (Hardwell and Austin Mahone song)|Creatures of the Night]]".<ref>Timo Büschleb: [http://www.dance-charts.de/201703278459/hardwell-austin-mahone-creatures-of-the-night ''Hardwell goes Future-Pop: Hardwell & Austin Mahone – Creatures of the Night''] on "Dance-Charts"</ref>
