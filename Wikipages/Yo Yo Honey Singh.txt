Singh's song "Party All Night" in [[Akshay Kumar]]'s film ''[[Boss (2013 Hindi film)|Boss]]'' was at the centre of a controversy. Producers of the movie had to submit a petition in [[Delhi High Court]] claiming that they had 'muted' an alleged vulgar word in Singh's song. The court  heard a petition filed by lawyer Sanjay Bhatnagar seeking a stay on the film, contending that without the censor board's approval, the song could not be released with such a vulgar word. The petitioner had sought a stay on the release of the film until either the word or the song was deleted from the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Muted word from Honey Singh's song is not vulgar : Akshay Kumar|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/muted-word-from-honey-singh-s-song-is-not-vulgar-akshay-kumar/article1-1135401.aspx|access-date=15 October 2013|newspaper=Hindustan Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018064953/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Muted-word-from-Honey-Singh-s-song-is-not-vulgar-Akshay-Kumar/Article1-1135401.aspx|archive-date=18 October 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
