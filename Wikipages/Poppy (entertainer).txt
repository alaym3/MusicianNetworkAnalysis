'''Moriah Rose Pereira''' (born January 1, 1995), known professionally as '''Poppy''' and formerly '''That Poppy''', is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and YouTuber. In 2014, she gained [[viral video|viral]] fame by starring in [[performance art]] videos as an [[uncanny valley]]-like [[Android (robot)|android]] entity who commented on and satirised [[internet culture]] and modern society. She signed a recording contract with [[Island Records]] in 2015, and released her debut EP ''[[Bubblebath (EP)|Bubblebath]]'' in 2016.

In 2017, Poppy signed a deal with [[Mad Decent]] and released her debut studio album ''[[Poppy.Computer]]'', which consisted of [[art pop]] and [[bubblegum pop]] songs. To promote the album, she embarked on the [[Poppy.Computer Tour]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/slideshows/poppy-at-slims-oct-27-2017/|title=Poppy at Slim's Oct. 26, 2017 – By geoffrey-smith-ii – October 30, 2017 – SF Weekly|date=October 30, 2017|work=SF Weekly|access-date=November 12, 2017|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185300/http://www.sfweekly.com/slideshows/poppy-at-slims-oct-27-2017/|archive-date=November 12, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, she released the pilot for the proposed [[surreal comedy]] online series ''[[I'm Poppy]]'' on [[YouTube Premium]]. She also released her second studio album ''[[Am I a Girl?]]'' In stark contrast to her previous style, the second half of ''Am I a Girl?'' began to show a heavy [[nu metal]] influence.

In 2020, Poppy signed to [[Sumerian Records]] and released her third studio album ''[[I Disagree]]'', incorporating [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[industrial rock]]. ''I Disagree'' featured visuals in her music videos which some critics described as "increasingly disturbing", "violent", and "macabre",<ref>{{Cite web|last=Inc|first=Discotech|title=Best Poppy Songs of All Time – Top 10 Tracks|url=https://app.discotech.me/articles/best-poppy-songs-of-all-time-top-tracks|access-date=2021-03-10|website=Discotech|language=en}}</ref> continuing the shift in her music videos that started with her second album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/poppy_goes_metal_with_new_album_i_disagree|title=Poppy Goes Metal with New Album 'I Disagree|last=Thiessen|first=Brock|date=October 4, 2019|website=[[Exclaim!|exclaim.ca]]|language=en|quote=The album is due out on January 10 via Sumerian Records, and it promises to be quite the departure for Poppy.}}</ref>

In 2021, Poppy's song "Bloodmoney" received a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]. That same year, she continued her long-time collaboration with professional wrestling promotion [[NXT (WWE brand)|WWE NXT]] by releasing the [[metalcore]] soundtrack EP ''[[Eat (NXT Soundtrack)]]''. Her fourth studio album, ''[[Flux (Poppy album)|Flux]]'', was released three months later to critical acclaim, featuring a less harsh and more stripped-down sound than ''I Disagree'' and ''Eat''.

There they could fill out a profile, create an avatar, and pledge their allegiance to them.

On August 23, room invites were sent out to members of the Church who were showing "Faith, Dedication, and Loyalty". There are 100,000 rooms, with 1,000 halls connecting to the corresponding 100 rooms in that hall. (For example, Hall No. 1 has rooms 1–100, Hall No. 2 has rooms 101–200, and so on.) Members of the Church can visit each other's rooms, leave comments on their walls, and access provided social media.

Poppy's identity was initially kept guarded. She explained, "I don't want people to talk about how old I am; I want them to talk about what I'm making.

===Reception===
Critics have both praised the catchiness of Poppy's music and described her persona as distant from reality. ''Racked'' called her "sweet, but alien" and "brightly addictive".<ref name="racked" /> PopularTV said of her music: "Paralleling [[Gwen Stefani]] in the [[No Doubt]] era, That Poppy mixes [[punk rock|punk]] with [[ska]]-pop and makes you want to get up and dance." The UQ Music Blog described her as "[[Electra Heart]] meets [[Princess Peach]]".<ref name="uq">{{cite web |url=http://uqmusicblog.com/2016/02/that-poppy-bubblebath-ep/ |title=That Poppy – Bubblebath EP |date=February 12, 2016 |website=UQ Music Blog |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422080751/http://uqmusicblog.com/2016/02/that-poppy-bubblebath-ep/ |archive-date=April 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |last=Peterson |first=Tyler |access-date=March 14, 2017 }}</ref> David Mogendorff, who works in artist content and services for YouTube and Google Play Music, said she has "a strong J- and K-pop influence".<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|last=Gibsone |first=Harriet |title=Global grime, political struggle and a Chinese pop explosion – what will be 2017's music trends? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/05/global-grime-political-struggle-and-a-chinese-pop-explosion-what-will-be-2017s-music-trends |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=May 6, 2017 |date=January 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317231047/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/05/global-grime-political-struggle-and-a-chinese-pop-explosion-what-will-be-2017s-music-trends |archive-date=March 17, 2017}}</ref>

Poppy's YouTube channel is often regarded as a commentary on social media. ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' described the tone of the channel, saying, "If you have the patience to work your way through all the videos on this channel, certain trends start to emerge. The most obvious is Poppy's fixation with the internet and social media culture, which she claims to love. But far more interesting is the general tone of the videos, which have gotten progressively darker over the last two years."<ref name="vice">{{cite web|last=Oberhaus |first=David |title=This Is Not an Interview with Poppy |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/this-is-not-an-interview-with-poppy |website=Motherboard VICE |access-date=May 6, 2017|date=January 9, 2017 }}</ref> Gita Jackson of ''[[Kotaku]]'' suggested the videos are a commentary on the experience of being online, writing, "In a way, she's made every YouTube video, ever. Her channel is an index of every insincere apology, desperate bid for views and assurance that they couldn't do it without her fans you'll ever see. That Poppy is not only skewering the absurdity of people who make a living as public figures on the internet—she has it out for the entire experience of being online." Mogendorff said the videos are "like social commentary... touch[ing] on the anxieties of modern life" and "a really interesting way of communicating, personal but strange".<ref name="guardian" />

''[[V (American magazine)|V Magazine]]'' listed Poppy as part of the new generation of music, saying that "her hatched-from-an-egg, [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch]] vibes have inspired labels from 'human [[ASMR]]' to a one-woman 'digital rabbit hole', none of which seem to stick".<ref name="vmag">{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Samuel |title=The New Generation in Music|url=https://vmagazine.com/article/new-generation-music/ |website=V Magazine|access-date=January 23, 2019|date=January 17, 2019 }}</ref> ''[[Paper Magazine|Paper]]'' magazine also listed Poppy as one of the 100 women revolutionizing pop music, noting that "no matter what Poppy does, we can learn to expect the unexpected".<ref name="papermag">{{cite web|last=Love Michael |first=Michael |title=100 Women Revolutionizing Pop|url=http://www.papermag.com/100-women-in-pop-2587872427.html?rebelltitem=65 |website=Paper Magazine|access-date=January 23, 2019|date=July 20, 2018 }}</ref> ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' cited Poppy in their list of 20 artists who defined the sound of nu-metal.<ref name="altpressmag">{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Ali|title=20 artists who defined the sound of nu-metal from past to present|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/bands-who-influenced-nu-metal/|website=Alternative Press|access-date=July 21, 2021|date=July 21, 2021}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Poppy's [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|gender questioning]] influenced the themes of ''[[Am I a Girl?]]'' In a 2019 interview, she stated that she identified as a woman, and said that she thinks "everyone should be able to identify with whatever they choose".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flaunt.com/content/poppy|title=Poppy &#124; If Identity Is Currency, Let's Bet The Whole Damned Farm|website=Flaunt Magazine}}</ref>

She also claimed that the same ex-boyfriend was leaking her unreleased videos, photographs of her without make-up, and "very personal demos that only he has" such as a cover of the [[Pokémon Theme|''Pokémon'' theme song]].
