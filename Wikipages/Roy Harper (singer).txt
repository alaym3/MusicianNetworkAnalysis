He has released 32 albums (including 10 live albums) across his 50-year career. As a musician, Harper is known for his distinctive [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerstyle]] playing and lengthy, lyrical, complex compositions, reflecting his love of jazz and the poet [[John Keats]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/13/roy-harper-songs-of-love-and-loss?INTCMP=SRCH 2011 Roy Harper interview] Guardian.co.uk Retrieved 9 December 2011</ref>

His influence has been acknowledged by [[Jimmy Page]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Pink Floyd]], and [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], who said Harper was his "...primary influence as an acoustic guitarist and songwriter."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/uncategorized/roy_harper_by_ian_anderson/ |title=Roy Harper Ian Anderson's primary musical influence |website=Classicrockmagazine.com |access-date=21 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917000113/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/uncategorized/roy_harper_by_ian_anderson/ |archive-date=17 September 2012}}</ref> [[Neil McCormick]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described him as "one of Britain's most complex and eloquent lyricists and genuinely original songwriters... much admired by his peers".<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturevideo/musicvideo/10443920/Roy-Harper-Im-inspired-to-carry-on.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131113013521/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturevideo/musicvideo/10443920/Roy-Harper-Im-inspired-to-carry-on.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= 13 November 2013 | title= Roy Harper: 'I'm inspired to carry on' | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | first=Neil | last=McCormick | date=12 November 2013 | access-date=15 November 2013}}</ref> Across the Atlantic his influence has been acknowledged by [[Seattle]]-based acoustic band [[Fleet Foxes]], American musician and producer [[Jonathan Wilson (musician)|Jonathan Wilson]] and Californian [[harpist]] [[Joanna Newsom]], with whom he has also [[Concert tour|toured]].

In 2005, Harper was awarded the [[MOJO Awards|MOJO]] [[2005 MOJO Awards|Hero Award]], and in 2013 a Lifetime Achievement Award at the [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]]. His most recent album, ''[[Man and Myth]]'', was released in 2013. In 2016, Harper celebrated his 75th birthday by performing concerts in Clonakilty, Birmingham, Manchester, London, and Edinburgh.

==Early life==
Harper was born in 1941 in [[Rusholme]], a suburb of [[Manchester]]. His mother, Muriel, died three weeks after he was born. From the age of 6, he lived in [[Lytham St Annes|St Annes-on-Sea]], a place he described as being "like a cemetery with bus stops".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/uncut/roy-harper-i-was-an-absolute-rebel-i-once-painted-the-local-town-hall-with-swastikas-and-hamme |title=Roy Harper: I was an absolute rebel... |access-date=24 November 2013 |author=Jones, Allen |date=July 2011 |publisher=UNCUT magazine }}</ref> He was brought up by his father and stepmother, with whom he became disillusioned because of her religious beliefs, although they reconciled in 1980, just before her death. His [[Antireligion|anti-religious]] views would later become a familiar theme within his music.<ref name=popmatters>{{cite web|url= http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/64093/hats-off-an-interview-with-roy-harper/|title=Hats Off: An Interview with Roy Harper |access-date=20 October 2008 |author=Kelly, Jennifer |date=20 October 2008 |publisher=Pop Matters}}</ref>

Harper began writing poems when he was 12. At the age of 13 he began playing [[skiffle]] music with his younger brother David ("Davey" on the album ''[[Flat Baroque and Berserk]]''), as well as becoming influenced by [[blues]] music. At 14 he formed his first group (''De Boys'') with his brothers David and Harry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrascope.co.uk/MyBackPages/harper.html |title=1994 Harper interview |website=Terrascope.co.uk |access-date=21 February 2013}}</ref> Harper was educated at [[King Edward VII and Queen Mary School|King Edward VII School]], [[Lytham St Annes]], then a grammar school, and left at the age of 15 (1956) to join the [[Royal Air Force]] to follow an ambition to be a pilot. After two years Harper rejected the rigid discipline and feigned madness to obtain a [[military discharge]], as a result receiving an [[electroconvulsive therapy]] treatment at [[RAF Halton|Princess Mary's RAF Hospital]], Wendover. After being discharged from there, he spent one day inside the former Lancaster Moor Mental Institute before escaping. These experiences would be recalled in "Committed", a song on Harper's debut album, ''[[Sophisticated Beggar]]''. From around 1961 he [[busking|busked]] around North Africa, Europe and London for a few years.

Musically, Harper's earliest influences were American [[blues]] musician [[Lead Belly]] and [[folk music|folk singer]] [[Woody Guthrie]]<ref name="dl94">[http://www.dirtylinen.com/feature/50harper.html 1994 Roy Harper Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021215750/http://www.dirtylinen.com/feature/50harper.html |date=21 October 2007 }}. Dirtylinen.com (8 April 2011). Retrieved on 5 August 2011.</ref> and, in his teens, jazz musician [[Miles Davis]]. Of the blues musicians Lead Belly, [[Big Bill Broonzy]] and [[Josh White]], Harper said they made music which "...seemed to be from a different planet ...We'd never heard anything like it. It changed our world overnight, a sledge hammer of a cultural change ...an equivalent would be to suddenly hear music from outer space".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/14749067.Singer_songwriter_Roy_Harper_returns_for_Scottish_gig/?ref=fbshr|title=Singer-songwriter Roy Harper returns for Scottish gig|website=HeraldScotland}}</ref> Harper was also exposed to classical music in his childhood and has pointed to the influence of [[Jean Sibelius]]'s ''[[Karelia Suite]]''. Lyrical influences include the 19th century [[Romantic poetry|Romantics]], especially [[Percy Bysshe Shelly|Shelley]], and Keats's poem "[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]". Harper has also cited the [[Beat Generation|Beat poets]] as being highly influential, particularly [[Jack Kerouac]].<ref>[http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/naked-flame-roy-harper 2011 Roy Harper Interview].

Retrieved on 6 December 2011</ref> Harper played his first paid performance at a poetry reading in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in 1960.

Returning to the UK in 1963 or 1964, Harper started to write more songs than poetry. He obtained a [[Residency show|residency]] at London's famous [[Soho]] folk music club [[Les Cousins (music club)|Les Cousins]] in 1965, having been introduced to it by [[Peter Bellamy]] of [[The Young Tradition]].<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |url=http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2011/10/bert_jansch_a_tribute.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008204732/http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2011/10/bert_jansch_a_tribute.html |archive-date=8 October 2011}} Roy Harper's tribute to Bert Jansch</ref> Harper's first advertised performance was on 5 October 1965. Within his first week Harper saw [[John Renbourn]], [[Alexis Korner]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Alex Campbell (singer)|Alex Campbell]] and [[Bert Jansch]] play,<ref name=autogenerated2 /> and he would play and associate with other artists later, including [[John Martyn]], [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Nick Drake]].

==Musical career==
===1966–69: The first record deals===
Harper's first album, ''[[Sophisticated Beggar]]'', was recorded in 1966 after he was spotted at Les Cousins and signed to Strike Records. The album consisted of Harper's songs and poetry backed by [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], recorded with a [[Revox]] [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape machine]] by [[Pierre Tubbs]] and with contributions from English guitarist [[Paul Brett]].  [[Columbia Records]] recognised Harper's potential and hired American producer [[Shel Talmy]] to produce Harper's second album, ''[[Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith]]'', which was released in 1968. The 11-minute track "Circle", "a soundscape of Harper's difficult youth",<ref name="2011 Roy Harper Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/uncut/roy-harper-i-was-an-absolute-rebel-i-once-painted-the-local-town-hall-with-swastikas-and-hamme |title=2011 Roy Harper Interview |website=Uncut.co.uk|date=July 2011 |access-date=24 November 2013}}</ref> was notable for marking a widening of his musical style away from the more traditional side of contemporary [[folk music]] heard at the time. Harper had an interest in [[Folk music|traditional folk]] but did not consider himself a bona fide member of the folk scene. He later explained:{{quote| I was too much of a modernist, really. Just too modern for what was going on in the folk clubs. I wanted to modernise music, but more than that to completely modernise people's attitudes towards life in general. I was involved in trying to bring (more) meat to the (contemporary) folk music...(of the time).<ref name="2008 Roy Harper interview">[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/hats-off-an-interview-with-roy-harper/ 2008 Roy Harper interview]. PopMatters.com. Retrieved on 9 December 2011.</ref>}} Harper's record company had different expectations. "They wanted me to write commercial pop songs and when they heard the album I made for them, they didn't have a clue. They wanted hits. And I gave them "Circle"".<ref name="2011 Roy Harper Interview"/> [[Bert Jansch]] contributed [[Liner notes|sleeve notes]] for the album and Harper paid tribute to Jansch with the song "Pretty Baby"; the B-Side non-album track of his first single (released in March 1966). During this period, Harper was managed by American music entrepreneur [[Jo Lustig]], manager of [[Pentangle (band)|The Pentangle]] and former agent to [[Julie Felix]].

In June 1968, Harper performed at the first free concert ever held at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], acting as compere and sharing the bill with [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]]. At the time, he spoke of co-writing a rock opera with Pink Floyd. No opera resulted, but it was the beginning of a musical relationship. Harper began to attract a following of fans from the [[Underground (British subculture)|underground]] music scene<ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=73188 British Pathe news reel footage of 1968 Hyde Park concert]. Britishpathe.com. Retrieved on 5 August 2011.</ref> and tour the UK, performing at numerous venues such as the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Ballroom]], [[Klooks Kleek]] and [[Mothers (music venue)|Mothers]]; venues that would gradually gain recognition for the variety and quality of their musical acts. Mothers in [[Birmingham]] was one such venue, and one to which Harper would frequently return.<ref name="Mabbett">{{cite journal|last=Mabbett|first=Andy|date=January–February 1995|title=Just Like Starting Over|journal=Brum Beat|location=Birmingham, England|issue=168|page=17|url=http://musicnaut.iki.fi/musicnaut/royharper/articles/brum_beat.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130213071511/http://musicnaut.iki.fi/musicnaut/royharper/articles/brum_beat.html|archive-date=13 February 2013}}</ref> Harper later told [[Brum Beat]] magazine:
{{quote|That was the first club outside London that meant anything at all and that's why there's been this long association with Birmingham. I played there about six times between 1968 and 1970. I have always enjoyed playing here.<ref name="Mabbett" />}}

A track from ''Come Out Fighting Ghengis Smith'', "Nobody's Got Any Money in the Summer" also appeared on the first bargain-priced [[sampler album]], ''[[The Rock Machine Turns You On]]''. The album was released in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and a number of other European countries as part of an international marketing campaign by [[Columbia Records]] (known in Europe as CBS).

In 1969 Harper undertook a short 6-venue tour with [[Ron Geesin]] and [[Ralph McTell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musicnaut.iki.fi/musicnaut/royharper/live0.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716110207/http://musicnaut.iki.fi/musicnaut/royharper/live0.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 July 2012 |title=Live performances 1965–1969 |website=Musicnaut.iki.fi |access-date=21 February 2013 }}</ref> The tour programme contained the introductory paragraph: {{quote|Roy Harper isn't an example of any category, the epitome of any movement or a rung on anybody's ladder; he built himself alone, piece by piece and his defiant character stands proud as if chiselled from belligerent granite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrascope.co.uk/MyBackPages/harper.html |title=1994 Roy Harper Interview |website=Terrascope.co.uk |access-date=21 February 2013}}</ref>}}

That same year, Harper released his third album ''[[Folkjokeopus]]'' again produced by Shel Talmy, and released by [[Liberty Records]]. Side two included an extended 17-minute track, titled "McGoohan's Blues", which Harper referred to as the "main statement" within the album. Of his non-conformance to radio-friendly, standard, three-minute songs, Harper claimed it to be a revolt, and that he regarded the three-minute pop song as an anathema, a [[jingle]] to sell a band.<ref name="2008 Roy Harper interview"/> (The title for "McGoohan's Blues" was a reference to actor [[Patrick McGoohan]], who had starred in the UK TV series ''[[The Prisoner]]'' two years earlier). The track "Sergeant Sunshine" would also appear on ''[[Son of Gutbucket]]'', a 1969 sampler album released to promote artists on the [[Liberty Records]] label.

During this period Harper also visited the [[Dolphin Club (Norway)|Dolphin Club]] in Oslo, Norway, where he became acquainted with folk singer [[Lillebjørn Nilsen]]. Nilsen learned one of Harper's songs, "On the First Day of April", which he translated to "Ravn Ferd" and recorded for his debut solo album ''Tilbake'' in 1971. Harper and Nilsen along with [[Finn Kalvik]] performed together on 23 January 1970 at a concert held in the [[University of Oslo]]. Harper's visit coincided with the emergence of the Norwegian 'folk music wave' ([[Swedish ballad tradition|Visebølgen]]) and the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation ([[NRK]]) recorded Harper on the occasion of the concert. Kalvik would later go on to record Norwegian versions of two Harper songs; "I Hate the White Man" ("Den hvite mann") and "Don't You Grieve" ("Kjære ikke gråt").

===1970–80: The Harvest years===
With Harper's reputation growing, [[Pink Floyd]]'s manager [[Peter Jenner]] signed him to a long-term (and at times confrontational) deal with [[EMI]]'s 'underground' subsidiary, [[Harvest Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folkblues.co.uk/artistsharper.html|title=Roy Harper – Folk Blues & Beyond<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Folkblues.co.uk}}</ref> Over a ten-year period, Harper recorded eight albums at the [[Abbey Road Studios]] for the Harvest label<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royharper.co.uk/magento/biography |title=Artist Biographies |website=Royharper.co.uk |access-date=21 February 2013}}</ref> and for much of this period was [[Talent manager|managed]] and produced by Jenner, initially acting for [[Blackhill Enterprises]]. According to Jenner, 
{{quote|Harper is a terrific songwriter, but a bit crazy, like all the best people. The great problem for him was seeing all these people who'd nicked his licks doing so much better than he did. People like Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin and, to some extent, Roger Waters.<ref>[http://www.folkblues.co.uk/artistsharper.html Peter Jenner Quote]. Folkblues.co.uk. Retrieved on 8 August 2021.</ref>}}

Harper's first tour of the United States followed the release of his fourth studio album, ''[[Flat Baroque and Berserk]]''. The album included the track "[[Another Day (Roy Harper song)|Another Day]]", a song destined to be performed live by Harper for many years to come, and covered by several other artists including [[This Mortal Coil]] (featuring [[Elizabeth Frazer]] on vocals) and [[Kate Bush]]. The album also featured [[the Nice]] on the track "Hell's Angels"; its ethereal sound achieved by a [[wah-wah pedal]] attached to Harper's [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]].

After the [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] Festival of 1970, [[Led Zeppelin]] paid tribute to Harper with their version of the traditional song "[[Shake 'Em on Down]]". Retitled "[[Hats Off to (Roy) Harper]]", it appeared on the album ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]''. According to [[Jimmy Page]], the band admired the way Harper stood by his principles and did not sell out to commercial pressures. In mutual appreciation of their work, Harper would often attend live performances by Led Zeppelin over the subsequent decade and contributed sleeve photography to the album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''.

Harper's critically acclaimed 1971 album was a four-song epic, ''[[Stormcock (album)|Stormcock]]''. The album featured [[Jimmy Page]] on guitar (credited as "S. Flavius Mercurius" for contractual reasons) and [[David Bedford]]'s orchestral arrangements (Bedford would also collaborate on some of Harper's future releases). Harper felt the album to be not particularly well promoted by his record label at the time and later stated: {{quote|They hated Stormcock. No singles. No way of promoting it on the radio. They said there wasn't any money to market it. Stormcock dribbled out.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alexis Petridis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/13/roy-harper-songs-of-love-and-loss?INTCMP=SRCH |title=2011 Roy Harper interview |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 13 October 2011|access-date=21 February 2013 |location=London}}</ref>}} Nevertheless, ''Stormcock'' would remain a favourite album of Harper's fans and influence musicians for decades to come. Thirty-five years later (in 2006) fellow [[List of people from Manchester|Mancunian]] [[Johnny Marr]] of English [[alternative rock]] band [[the Smiths]] said: {{quote|If ever there was a secret weapon of a record it would be Stormcock... It's intense and beautiful and clever: [[David Bowie|Bowie's]] [[Hunky Dory]]'s big, badder brother.<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1888537,00.html Music's secret weapons]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved on 5 August 2011.</ref>}} [[Joanna Newsom]] cited ''Stormcock'' as an influence upon her 2006 release [[Ys (Joanna Newsom album)|Ys]] and in 2011, [[Robin Pecknold]] of [[Seattle]], Washington-based [[Folk music|folk]] band [[Fleet Foxes]] stated that he took inspiration from ''Stormcock'' when recording Fleet Foxes second album ''[[Helplessness Blues]]''.

In 1972, Harper made his acting debut playing Mike Preston alongside [[Carol White]] in the [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]] film ''[[Made (1972 film)|Made]]''. The film was chosen (along with ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'') to represent Britain at the [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref name="Hats off to Harper">{{cite web|url=http://www.terrascope.co.uk/MyBackPages/harper.html |title=Hats off to Harper |publisher=Dave Burnham |date= August 1994 |access-date=25 November 2013}}</ref> Harper also recorded the soundtrack for the film, released the following year as ''[[Lifemask]]'', again with contributions from Jimmy Page. At the time, ''Lifemask'' was created as Harper's [[Curtain call|final bow]], as he had been diagnosed with the (then) little-known genetic condition [[Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia|HHT]], which caused [[polycythemia]], incapacitating him. The cover art shows Harper's life mask, as opposed to the '[[death mask]]' it might have been.

After recovering (treatment involved frequent [[venesection]]), his next album (''[[Valentine (Roy Harper album)|Valentine]]'') was released on [[Valentine's Day]], 14 February 1974, and featured contributions from Jimmy Page. A concert to mark its release was held on the same day at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], with Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, [[Robert Plant]], and [[John Bonham]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Roy Harper Jam – Valentine's Day Concert|url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/event/february-14-1974|website=Led Zeppelin.com|access-date=15 October 2017}}</ref> David Bedford, [[Max Middleton]], [[Ronnie Lane]], and [[Keith Moon]] performing alongside Harper. His first live album ''[[Flashes from the Archives of Oblivion]]'', featuring two tracks recorded at that concert, soon followed.

[[Pink Floyd]]'s 1975 release ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' saw Harper sing lead vocals on the song "[[Have a Cigar]]". [[Roger Waters]] intended to record the part himself, but had strained his voice while recording "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]" and [[David Gilmour]] declined to sing. Harper was recording his album ''[[HQ (album)|HQ]]'' in Studio 2 of Abbey Road at the same time as Pink Floyd were working in Studio 3; learning of the band's dilemma, Harper offered to sing the lead. The song is one of only two songs by Pink Floyd not sung by one of their permanent members (the other one being "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]"). David Gilmour returned the favour by appearing on ''HQ'', along with Harper's occasional backing band, 'Trigger' ([[Chris Spedding]], Dave Cochran, [[Bill Bruford]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]). The single "[[When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease]]", taken from ''HQ'', is one of Harper's best known songs. Harper also co-wrote the song "Short and Sweet" with Gilmour for Gilmour's first solo record, ''[[David Gilmour (album)|David Gilmour]]'' (released in 1978), and subsequently appeared on his own album ''[[The Unknown Soldier (album)|The Unknown Soldier]]'' (released in 1980).

Controversy followed the release of 1977's ''[[Bullinamingvase]]''. The owners of [[Watford Gap service station]] objected to criticism of their food – "''Watford Gap, Watford Gap/A plate of grease and a load of crap...''" – in the lyrics of the song "Watford Gap",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/137421/Did-Watford-Gap-inspire-Brown-Sugar|title=Did Watford Gap inspire Brown Sugar|work=express.co.uk|author=Danny Buckland|date=1 November 2009}}</ref> as did an [[EMI]] board member who was also a [[non-executive director]] of Blue Boar (the owners of the service station). Harper was forced to drop it from future UK copies of the album, though it remained on the US LP and reappeared on a later CD reissues.<ref name="delisle">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/aug/25/popandrock|title=In search of a British Route 66|first=Tim|last=de Lisle|work=The Guardian|date=25 August 2006|access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref> The album also featured the song "One of Those Days in England", with backing vocals by [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Linda McCartney|Linda]]; the single from the album went to number 42 in the UK charts. During this period, Harper's band were renamed 'Chips' and included [[Andy Roberts (musician)|Andy Roberts]], Dave Lawson, Henry McCullough, John Halsey and Dave Cochran. In April 1978, Harper began writing lyrics for the next [[Led Zeppelin]] album with [[Jimmy Page]], but the project was shelved when lead singer [[Robert Plant]] returned from a break after the death of his son, Karac Pendragon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ledzepnews.com/2018/03/06/robert-plant-talked-about-the-death-of-his-son-karac-in-a-clip-from-the-big-interview-dan-rather/|title=Robert Plant talked about the death of his son Karac in a clip from his upcoming TV interview|website=Ledzepnews.com|date=6 March 2018|accessdate=9 February 2021}}</ref>

Following the success of ''Bullinamingvase'', Harper was asked "to write another record quickly". Demo recordings with Harper's newly formed backing band 'Black Sheep' (Andy Roberts, Dave Lawson, Henry McCullough, John Halsey and Dave Cochran, a.k.a. Dave C. Drill)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andyrobertsmusic.com/music_royharper.html |title=Andy Roberts recollects working with Roy Harper |website=Andyrobertsmusic.com |access-date=21 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aylesburyfriars.co.uk/royharper77.html |title=Black Sheep – Roy Harper's band |website=Aylesburyfriars.co.uk |access-date=21 February 2013}}</ref> were made, but Harper felt them to be rushed. The record company, who "were in the first stages of a collapse in sales",<ref name="royharper.co.uk">{{cite web |author=Loony on the Bus (Download) |url=http://www.royharper.co.uk/magento/roy-harper-shop/loony-on-the-bus.html |title=How ''Commercial Breaks'' came to remain unreleased |website=Royharper.co.uk |access-date=21 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422160407/http://www.royharper.co.uk/magento/roy-harper-shop/loony-on-the-bus.html |archive-date=22 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> were not interested in the recordings, nor were they prepared to provide studio time when requested, telling Harper to come back in six months. As a result, Harper withheld the [[publishing rights]] to that which had been recorded; an album provisionally entitled ''Commercial Breaks (doesn't it?)'' and was (in his own words) "outlawed"<ref name="royharper.co.uk"/> by the record company.

From 1975 to 1980 Harper worked with English musician and 'Black Sheep' member [[Andy Roberts (musician)|Andy Roberts]] sometimes performing as a duo. During this period, Harper spent considerable time in the United States and signed with the US division of [[Chrysalis Records]], who released ''HQ'' under a different title – ''When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease'' – and with alternative artwork. Chrysalis considered the original [[Hipgnosis]]-designed album cover of Harper [[Jesus' walk on water|walking on water]] to be too offensive for an American release. Harper disagreed, but was given no choice by the label. Chrysalis also changed the title of Harper's next album, ''[[Bullinamingvase]]'', to ''One of Those Days in England''. In 1978, US Chrysalis reissued Harper's first five [[Harvest Records|Harvest]] albums, only one of which (''Flat, Baroque and Berserk'') had been previously released in America.

On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the ''Kate Bush Christmas Special''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1427061/fullcredits#cast "Kate Bush Christmas Special"] Cast and Crew at IMDb</ref> As well as playing songs from her first two albums, Bush and her guest, [[Peter Gabriel]], performed Harper's "[[Another Day (Roy Harper song)|Another Day]]".<ref name="BBC Christmas Special 1979">{{cite web| title = Kate Bush – BBC Christmas Special 1979|url =http://gaffa.org/passing/v79_dec.html|website=Gaffa.org| access-date =6 June 2008 }}</ref> Their duet was discussed for release as a single, but never appeared.

Harper returned to the studio a few years after his dispute with EMI to record and prepare his next album ''The Unknown Soldier''. At the time, Harper knew it would be his last release on the label and it was these demos that ''"...were destined to gather dust on a shelf labelled 'Commercial Breaks'..."''.<ref name="royharper.co.uk"/> (It was not until Harper's 1988 release ''[[Loony on the Bus]]'' that some of these songs became officially available, and another six years until the album was finally released as ''[[Commercial Breaks (album)|Commercial Breaks]] (1994)).

In 1980 Harper released ''The Unknown Soldier'', which was indeed his final [[Harvest Records|Harvest]] release. The album features David Gilmour both on guitar and as co-writer of half of its tracks. On one of those tracks, "You", Harper [[duet]]s with [[Kate Bush]]. Harper later reciprocated by singing backing vocals on "[[Breathing (Kate Bush song)|Breathing]]" on Bush's album ''[[Never For Ever]]''; Bush's first no.&nbsp;1 album, the first ever album by a British female solo artist to top the UK album chart, and the first album by any female solo artist to enter the chart at no.&nbsp;1. Bush thanked Harper on the album's cover for "holding onto the poet in his music".<ref name="Hats off to Harper"/> During a BBC Radio interview by [[Paul Gambaccini]], Bush praised Harper, stating: {{quote|Roy is one of the greatest English songwriters we've had, and people just don't realise it. And I really think that when they do we're going to have another top songwriter up there. He's brilliant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musicnaut.iki.fi/musicnaut/royharper/quotes.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713053352/http://musicnaut.iki.fi/musicnaut/royharper/quotes.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 July 2012 |title=Kate Bush radio interview 1980 (praise for Harper) |website=Musicnaut.iki.fi |access-date=21 February 2013 }}</ref>}} Of Bush, Harper later said, {{quote|Kate is a fantastic musician and very professional as well.

===1981–89: Recession and repossession===
Harper's 1982 album ''[[Work of Heart]]'' was released on Public Records, a newly formed record label Harper created with Mark Thompson (son of English historian, socialist and peace campaigner [[E.P. Thompson]]). During this period Harper toured with a band consisting of [[Tony Franklin (musician)|Tony Franklin]] on Bass, Bob Wilson of [[Steve Gibbons (musician)|the Steve Gibbons Band]], George Jackson on drums and Dave Morris on keyboards. The album was chosen by [[Derek Jewell]] of ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' as "Album of the Year" in 1982, but it did not sell well and the short-lived label went under.

During this period Harper lost his home, a farm in the village of [[Marden, Herefordshire]], to the bank. Of this period Harper stated: {{quote|...I can proudly say that I was one of the first casualties of the eighties [[Early 1980s recession|recession]]!... It was a chaotic period and one that I don't care to remember that often... There is no doubt in my own mind that the early eighties were the [[nadir]] of my life in music"''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Born in Captivity/Work of Heart (CD) |url=http://www.royharper.co.uk/magento/born-in-captivity-work-of-heart.html |title=Roy Harper Official Site |website=Royharper.co.uk |access-date=21 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513094707/http://www.royharper.co.uk/magento/born-in-captivity-work-of-heart.html |archive-date=13 May 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

The original demo version of ''Work of Heart'' was later released (in 1984) on a [[limited edition]] (830 copies) [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] release entitled ''[[Born in Captivity]]''.

Throughout 1984, Harper toured the United Kingdom with [[Jimmy Page]] performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors, and Themselves. In 1985, ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' was released. The album caused a resurgence of interest in Harper and his music. ([[Tony Franklin (musician)|Tony Franklin]], bass player in Harper's group at this time, later joined [[Jimmy Page|Page]] in [[The Firm (rock band)|the Firm]]). In April 1984, Harper and Gilmour performed "Short and Sweet" (a song they co-wrote) during Gilmour's three-night run at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]]. This version later appeared on the ''[[David Gilmour Live 1984]]'' concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmour's newly released album, ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]''.

On 20 June 1984 Harper performed at the last [[Stonehenge Free Festival]], sharing the bill with [[Hawkwind]] and [[the Enid]]. The concert was videoed and released as [[Hawkwind videography#Stonehenge 84|Stonehenge 84]].

As a result of his continual touring and the popularity of ''Whatever Happened to Jugula?'', Harper re-signed to [[EMI]] and in 1986 released a live album, ''[[In Between Every Line]]'' (containing recordings from his performances at the [[Cambridge Folk Festival]]), and in 1988 the studio album, ''[[Descendants of Smith]]''. The renewed relationship between Harper and EMI did not last and from 1985 more of his earlier albums were becoming available on the newly formed [[Awareness Records]] label.

1988 also saw the release of ''[[Loony on the Bus]]'', a collection of tracks recorded a decade earlier and intended for release in 1977 as [[Commercial Breaks (album)|''Commercial Breaks'']] (with the sub-title, 'doesn't it?'). The original release having been held back because of disputes over funding and content between Harper and EMI. Sales of ''Loony on the Bus'' would fund Harper's 1990 release; ''[[Once (Roy Harper album)|Once]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Loony on the Bus (Download) |url=http://www.royharper.co.uk/magento/roy-harper-shop/loony-on-the-bus.html |title=Commercial Breaks / Loony on the Bus Release details from artists website |website=Royharper.co.uk |access-date=21 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422160407/http://www.royharper.co.uk/magento/roy-harper-shop/loony-on-the-bus.html |archive-date=22 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===1990–99: Science Friction===
In 1993<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folkblues.co.uk/artistsharper.html |title=Date of Establishment |website=Folkblues.co.uk |access-date=21 February 2013}}</ref> Harper established his own record label Science Friction and obtained the rights to all his previously released albums. As a result, from 1994 much of Harper's back catalogue became available on CD once more.

Harper was very productive during the decade, releasing five studio albums: ''Once'' (1990), ''[[Death or Glory? (album)|Death or Glory?]]'' (1992), ''[[Commercial Breaks (album)|Commercial Breaks]]'' (1994), ''[[The Dream Society]]'' (1998), a collection of poetry and [[spoken word]] tracks ''[[Poems, Speeches, Thoughts and Doodles]]'' (1997); two live albums: ''[[Unhinged (album)|Unhinged]]'' (1993) and ''[[Live at Les Cousins]]'' (1996; recorded in 1969) and six individual CDs of live concerts and [[recording session|sessions]] recorded by the [[BBC]] (1997). Two official [[Compact Cassette|C90 cassette tapes]] of concerts at the Red Lion in Birmingham (1984 & 1985) were made available from Harper's agency (Acorn Entertainments).

In addition, Harper released a live [[video cassette|video]], ''[[Once (Roy Harper album)#Video|Once]]'' (1990), an [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Burn the World]]'' (1990), a 4-track CD single ''Death or Glory?'' (1992), a [[limited edition]] [[live album|live]] [[Compact cassette|cassette]] ''[[Born in Captivity II]]'' (1992) (featuring cricketer [[Graeme Fowler]] and a cricket poem written by Harper: "[[Three Hundred Words]]"), a [[compilation album]] ''[[An Introduction to .....]]'' (1994), and a [[reissue]] of ''[[Descendants of Smith]]'' (his 1988 release) renamed ''[[Garden of Uranium]]'' (1994).

Once again Harper collaborated with [[David Gilmour]] and [[Kate Bush]] on his 1990 release, ''Once''. The album also featured contributions from [[Nigel Mazlyn Jones]], [[Mark Feltham (musician)|Mark Feltham]] and [[Tony Franklin (musician)|Tony Franklin]]. One of the album tracks, "The Black Cloud of Islam" a song written about Colonel Gaddafi, [[Pan Am Flight 103|the Lockerbie bombing]], and a despairing castigation of [[Islamic fundamentalism|radical Islam]], provoked criticism from some of Harper's fans at the time. Whilst religion, Harper's "first and only enemy"<ref name="Cloudy Days">{{cite web|author=Cloudy Days |url=http://www.royharper.co.uk/blog/?p=127 |title=Roy Harper Official Site |website=Royharper.co.uk |access-date=31 January 2015}}</ref> has always been a recurring theme in his music,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/8764469/Roy-Harper-When-an-old-cricketer-returns-to-the-crease.html |title=Roy Harper: When an old cricketer returns to the crease |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=31 January 2015}}</ref> he was '[[Penalty card|red-carded]] by a lot of his 1990 following... who left in substantial numbers'.<ref name="Cloudy Days"/>

In 1992, his second marriage ended and Harper released ''Death or Glory?'' an album that (upon its original release) contained a number of songs and [[spoken word]] pieces referencing his loss and pain. "She ran off with someone else" said Harper, "a violin player ([[Nigel Kennedy]]) I’d been working on an adaptation of [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Brahms's Violin Concerto]] with. I was really traumatised by that. Anybody who's been suddenly left like that will know it's very, very traumatic. I managed to come out of it, but it took about five years. It was like a death, a loss, like being told your child's been killed in a war. There's no other way to describe it. When you go through that, it changes your life forever, there's no point in not admitting it. I withdrew, retreated, became an exile".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/uncut/roy-harper-i-was-an-absolute-rebel-i-once-painted-the-local-town-hall-with-swastikas-and-hamme |title=2011 Roy Harper Interview |website=Uncut.co.uk|date=July 2011 |access-date=25 November 2013}}</ref>

Throughout the decade, Harper's musical influence began to be recognised by a younger generation of musicians, some of whom [[cover version|covered]] his songs or invited him to make guest appearances on their albums. In 1995 Harper contributed [[spoken word]]s on [[the Tea Party]]'s 1995 album ''[[The Edges of Twilight]]'', and appeared on stage for their New Year concert in Montreal. In 1996 Roy recited "Bad Speech" from his album ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' on [[Anathema (band)|Anathema's]] album ''[[Eternity (Anathema album)|Eternity]]'' (the album also contains a [[cover version]] of "Hope" from the same album). The track "Time" from The Tea Party's 1996 [[multimedia]] CD, ''[[Alhambra (album)|Alhambra]]'', was sung and co-written by Harper.

Harper contributed his version of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull's]] song, "Up the 'Pool" (from ''[[Living in the Past (album)|Living in the Past]]'') for the 1996 [[tribute album]], ''[[To Cry You a Song – A Collection of Tull Tales]]'', a version Anderson liked so much he began to perform the ''"forgotten piece"'' again in concert<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/uncategorized/roy_harper_by_ian_anderson/ |title=2006 Interview with Ian Anderson |website=Classicrockmagazine.com |access-date=21 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917000113/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/uncategorized/roy_harper_by_ian_anderson/ |archive-date=17 September 2012}}</ref> and later described it as his favourite Jethro Tull cover song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/ian_anderson_on_jethro_tull_the_string_quartets/ |title=2017 Interview with Ian Anderson |website=Songfacts.com |access-date=23 March 2017}}</ref>

===2000–10: Into the new millennium===
In 2000, Harper released an almost entirely acoustic album, ''[[The Green Man (album)|The Green Man]]'', accompanied by [[The Tea Party]]'s [[Jeff Martin (Canadian musician)|Jeff Martin]] on guitar, [[hurdy-gurdy]] and numerous other instruments. The following year (2001) Harper celebrated his 60th birthday with a concert performance at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]] and was joined by numerous guest artists including; [[David Bedford]], [[Nick Harper]], [[Jeff Martin (Canadian musician)|Jeff Martin]] and [[John Renbourn]]. The concert was recorded and released shortly after as a double CD, ''[[Royal Festival Hall Live – 10 June 2001]]''.

In 2003, Harper published ''[[The Passions of Great Fortune]]'', a large format book containing all the lyrics to his albums (and singles) to date, it also contained a wealth of photographs and commentary on his songs.

Harper released his second CD single in April 2005; "[[The Death of God (song)|The Death of God]]". The 13-minute song, a critique of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war in Iraq]], featured guest guitarist Matt Churchill (who also performed live with Harper during this period). A video of the track, intermixing animation with a live performance, is {{YouTube|x6j0IJvD8bQ|available in four parts}}. 2003 also saw the release of ''[[Counter Culture (album)|Counter Culture]]'', a [[double album|double]] [[compilation album]] featuring songs from Harper's 35-year songwriting period. ''Counter Culture'' received a five-star review from ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine.

In September 2007, Harper supported Californian harpist [[Joanna Newsom]] at her [[Royal Albert Hall]] performance. Newsom, impressed by Harper's 1971 album ''Stormcock'' found it served as an inspiration for her similarly expansive second album, ''[[Ys (Joanna Newsom album)|Ys]]''.<ref name=popmatters/> During his Royal Albert Hall appearance with Newsom, Harper played ''Stormcock'' in its entirety. At the time, Harper made an announcement on his website that he was ''"...taking a break from the live scene... retired from gigging..."'' and just wanted ''"...the time and space to write..."''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/daveandsue.burnham1/royharperphotos.html |title=Roy Harper Fan Site |website=Homepage.ntlworld.com |access-date=21 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418024436/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/daveandsue.burnham1/royharperphotos.html |archive-date=18 April 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During this period, Harper dedicated his time to collecting and compiling his life's work in various formats. One of the intended projects was to be the making of a documentary DVD to round off this process. However, as of 2016 this remains unreleased.<ref name="biog"/>

In 2008, plans were announced for a Roy Harper [[tribute album]].

==Personal life==
One of Harper's sons, [[Nick Harper]], is a singer-songwriter. He has occasionally toured and recorded with his father and appeared as a guitarist on a number of his albums since 1985. Another son, Ben Harper (by English actress Verna Harvey), lives in the US.

Harper is an [[atheist]].<ref>"Standouts in the first half included "Frozen Moment" and a recent, vehemently anti-war and anti-religion, epic, "The Death of God". This he prefaced with an atheist polemic that drew cheers from some but resolute silence from others. He also did the notorious ditty "Watford Gap", a much more focused attack, this time on 1970s motorway food." Simon Hardeman reviewing a Harper performance at London's 100 Club, ''The Independent'' (London), 24 January 2006, Features, p. 43.</ref>

Following police interviews in February 2013, Harper was charged in November 2013 with ten counts of alleged historic child sexual abuse over a period of several years with two under-age females.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-30907325|title=Folk rock musician Roy Harper sex abuse trial begins|website=BBC.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagevinylnews.com/2013/11/roy-harper-charged-with-child-sex.html|title=Roy Harper Charged With Child Sex Offenses, Denies Charges|website=Vintagevinylnews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/roy-harper-charged-with-child-sex-offences/|title=''Classic Rock Magazine'', "Roy Harper vigorously denies charges"|date=16 November 2013|website=Web.archive.org}}</ref> After a two-week trial in early 2015, he was unanimously acquitted by a jury of two of the charges with no verdicts on the remaining five,<ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-30907325 | title=Folk rock musician Roy Harper sex abuse trial begins | date = 20 January 2015 | work= BBC News }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url =http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Folk-rock-singer-songwriter-Roy-Harper-cleared/story-25980802-detail/story.html| title =Harper cleared of indecent assault| date =5 February 2015| publisher =Western Morning News| url-status =bot: unknown| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150205161837/http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Folk-rock-singer-songwriter-Roy-Harper-cleared/story-25980802-detail/story.html| archive-date =5 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/11774558.Jury_find_folk_singer_not_guilty_of_indecent_assault_charge/ | title=Harper cleared by Jury | date = 5 February 2015 | newspaper=[[Worcester News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url =http://www.redditchadvertiser.co.uk/news/11778015.Folk_singer_could_have_to_face_re_trial/ | title=Jury fails to deliver verdict in Harper trail | date = 6 February 2015 | newspaper=Redditch Advertiser}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-31170479 | title=Harper cleared of indecent assault | date = 6 February 2015 | work= BBC News}}</ref> then in November 2015, following a review by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]], [[Alison Saunders]], the remaining charges were dropped.<ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/folk-singer-roy-harper-cleared-6800880 | title=Roy Harper cleared of charges and attacks decision to prosecute | date = 9 November 2015 | newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =http://home.bt.com/news/uk-news/musician-roy-harper-slams-prosecutors-after-being-cleared-of-abuse-claims-11364015620236 | title=Harper slams prosecutors after abuse allegations dropped | date = 9 November 2015 | website=Bt.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11985089/Roy-Harper-criticises-CPS-for-taking-so-long-to-acquit-him-over-sex-abuse-allegations.html | title=Roy Harper criticises CPS for taking 'so long' to acquit him  | date = 9 November 2015 | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/09/roy-harper-cleared-historical-sexual-abuse-angry-court-battle | title=Abuse allegations dropped by prosecution | date = 9 November 2015 | newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/13973707.Singer_Roy_Harper_tells_of_three_year__quot_nightmare_quot__after_court_battle/ | title=Roy Harper tells of three-year "nightmare" after court battle | date = 9 November 2015 | newspaper=[[Worcester News]]}}</ref>
