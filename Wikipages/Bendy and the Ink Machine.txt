The game was also released for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] on November 20, 2018, being published by Rooster Teeth Games, and for IOS and Android on December 21, 2018.

Inspired by the [[BioShock (series)|''BioShock'' game series]], the game is set in the fictional Joey Drew Studios. The player controls Henry Stein, a retired animator who receives a letter inviting him 
back to his old workplace. Stein discovers a series of strange paranormal activities caused by the titular Ink Machine. In the game, players navigate through a first person perspective and need to complete certain tasks to proceed, such as combat, collecting objects or solving puzzles. Players can also find audio logs recorded by the studio's employees in order to understand the game's history.

''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' was well-received upon its initial release. Praise centered on its vintage aesthetic and story, although its puzzles and combat mechanics were less popular. In the months following its release, the game quickly gained a large following from exposure on platforms like [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and eventually was approved through [[Steam Greenlight]] in mid-2017. Merchandise, as well as a mobile spin-off, was later introduced to further promote the game. Mike Mood, the game's programmer and co-creator, described the game as an "accidental success".<ref>{{cite web|last=McAuley Valier|first=Tyler|date=July 11, 2017|title=The Co-Creator of Bendy and the Ink Machine Talks Accidental Success|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TylerMcAuleyVallier/20170711/301391/The_CoCreater_of_Bendy_and_the_Ink_Machine_Talks_Accidental_Success.php|website=Gamasutra}}</ref> ''Bendy and the Dark Revival'', the next game in the series, is scheduled for released in 2021.

==Gameplay==
''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' is a first person survival horror that resembles several cartoons in the late 1930s to 1940s. The player plays as Henry Stein, a retired animator who returns to his old workplace, Joey Drew Studios, and discovers that a machine has corrupted the entire studio and brought certain cartoon characters to life. The game mixes combat with puzzle mechanics.<ref name="TheXboxHub">{{Cite web|last=Tyler|date=December 3, 2018|title=Bendy and the Ink Machine Review|url=https://www.thexboxhub.com/bendy-and-the-ink-machine-review/|access-date=February 23, 2021|website=TheXboxHub}}</ref> Players explore through a first-person view and have limited physical actions such as running and jumping.<ref>{{Cite web|date=December 6, 2018|title=Bendy and the Ink Machine Review (Nintendo Switch)|url=https://thegww.com/bendy-and-the-ink-machine-review-nintendo-switch/|access-date=March 19, 2021|website=GWW}}</ref> Different items can be collected, some of which are required to perform various tasks before proceeding.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sax|first=Eugene|date=December 18, 2018|title=Bendy And The Ink Machine Review|url=https://gamecritics.com/eugene-sax/bendy-and-the-ink-machine-review/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516060929/https://gamecritics.com/eugene-sax/bendy-and-the-ink-machine-review/|archive-date=March 6, 2019|access-date=March 11, 2021|website=GameCritics}}</ref> Cans of [[bacon soup]] can also be collected for achievements and to restore Henry's [[Health (gaming)|health]] if he is injured.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bendy and the Ink Machine Trophies for PlayStation 4|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/241288-bendy-and-the-ink-machine/trophies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203202823/https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/241288-bendy-and-the-ink-machine/trophies|archive-date=February 3, 2019|access-date=March 11, 2021|website=GameFAQs}}</ref>

== Plot ==

=== Chapter 1: Moving Pictures ===
In August 1966, retired [[animator]] Henry Stein receives a letter from his former friend and employer, Joey Drew, asking him to return to their [[animation studio]] and see something important. He finds the studio abandoned, but discovers an "ink machine", installed sometime after Henry's departure 30 years earlier. He finds a tape recording by [[janitor]] Wally Franks that suggests Joey engaged in bizarre occult practices while making the machine, as well as a mutilated real-life analogue of Boris the Wolf, one of the studio's cartoon characters. Once Henry fixes and starts the machine, he is [[Jumpscare|attacked]] by a creature known as "Ink Bendy", or "The Ink Demon" whose appearance is vastly different than the original version of studio mascot Bendy. Bendy appears as a cheerful, mischievous, short, and rather chubby cartoon devil. The Ink Demon is tall, and skinny, almost skeletal. His limbs are out of proportion with one another, and melted ink drips over his visage. The only similarities between Bendy and the Ink Demon are their enormous grins and pointed heads. As the studio begins to fill with ink, Henry flees toward the exit, only for the floor to collapse and drop him into the studio's lower levels. Draining the ink from this area, he finds a chamber whose floor is marked with strange diagrams. He hallucinates seeing the ink machine, a wheelchair, and then the Ink Demon before blacking out. The meaning of these hallucinations is largely ambiguous.

=== Chapter 2: The Old Song ===
Henry wakes up and begins to search for a way out, eventually reaching the music department. Henry finds a stairwell leading to the exit, but the entrance is flooded with ink. After pulling a power switch at the top of the flooded stairwell, he is attacked by ink creatures known as the Searchers; once they are defeated, a large metal door which previously blocked the next area opens. Henry traverses the area and reaches the office of Sammy Lawrence, the studio's musical director. He notices an Ink Pump inside the office, which should drain the stairwell. After completing several tasks spanning several locations to drain the ink, Henry hurries toward the exit but is attacked by Sammy Lawrence. Sammy's entire body has been transformed into Ink. He wears faded, damaged coveralls similar to Boris the Wolf's and over his absent face hangs a threadbare mask of the titular character Bendy, with a hole over the mouth to breath from. Sammy intends to sacrifice Henry to Ink Bendy in order to flee the studio, but before he can do so, he is dragged away by Ink Bendy and killed. Henry frees himself and flees through the studio, pursued by Ink Bendy. Barricading himself behind a door, he waits until Ink Bendy has left and then meets a living, intact Boris, called Buddy Boris.

=== Chapter 3: Rise and Fall ===
Henry befriends Buddy Boris, and the two leave the latter's [[safehouse]] to continue searching for an exit. In the toy department, they find another ink creature called Twisted Alice who is a distorted version of [[actress]] Susie Campbell and the character Alice Angel. Twisted Alice leads them to her lair and reveals that she has been harvesting the ink of other characters in order to make herself beautiful. Alice also reveals some interesting tidbits of information during this meeting, such as the fact that Ink creatures who are killed in the studio often don't stay down for long, being reborn out of the Ink Machine again and again in a process known as "The Cycle." Henry must perform several tasks for Twisted Alice in order for her to let him and Buddy Boris go free, learning from tape recordings that Susie became distressed when Joey suddenly replaced her with another actress, Allison Pendle. Angry and bitter over her dismissal, Susie allowed the ink to transform her into Twisted Alice. As Henry carries out Twisted Alice's tasks, he must hide from both Ink Bendy and the Projectionist, an entity of projector operator Norman Polk. The Projectionist is a lanky ink figure, though not as lanky as the Ink Demon, with a speaker protruding from his chest, and wires from out of his back which lead to his head, a projector. Henry must also avoid and defeat the reanimated versions of the cartoon's minor antagonists, the Butcher Gang. Henry completes the tasks and boards a lift to escape with Buddy Boris, but Twisted Alice double-crosses them and forces it to crash to the bottom of its shaft. Henry wakes up to Buddy Boris desperately shaking him awake, as Twisted Alice approaches from behind him, humming. Henry can only watch as Twisted Alice seizes Buddy Boris, pulling him into the darkness.

=== Chapter 4: Colossal Wonders ===
Climbing out of the crashed lift, Henry ventures deeper into the cavernous studio in search of Buddy Boris and finds a lounge filled with the Lost Ones, ink creatures who show no hostility. He also discovers that Joey had been planning to open a Bendy-themed [[amusement park]] called Bendy Land with the help of famed ride designer Bertrum Piedmont. In order to reach Buddy Boris, Henry must restore power to the haunted house attraction by finding and flipping a series of switches hidden throughout a warehouse filled with rides, games, and props from the planned park. He must overcome a series of challenges in the process, one of which requires him to destroy a ride containing Bertrum's still-living, ink-corrupted head. Another forces him to evade the Projectionist in an encounter that culminates in a fight between the Projectionist and the Ink Demon. The two trade blows until The Ink Demon, tiring of the exchange, grabs the Projectionist and rips his projector off. Entering the haunted house, Henry discovers that Twisted Alice has turned Boris into a deformed, hulking beast called Brute Boris and ordered him to kill Henry. The two fight, with Henry ultimately killing Brute Boris and freeing Buddy Boris' spirit. Twisted Alice tries to kill Henry herself, but is suddenly impaled through the back with a sword by Allison Angel, a physically intact and sane duplicate of Alice who is accompanied by a wolf character named Tom. Allison and Tom are the ink versions of Allison Pendle and Thomas Connor, the studio's resident mechanic, respectively.

=== Chapter 5: The Last Reel ===
Allison and Tom keep Henry captured, but he eventually gains Allison's trust. She eventually gives him a "seeing tool" that allows him to see hidden messages on the walls. After Tom inadvertently reveals the location of their hideout to Bendy, he and Allison abandon Henry and flee. Henry escapes on his own and crosses a river of ink on a paddleboat while avoiding a giant Bendy hand, reaching a shantytown built by the Lost Ones. There, Henry is attacked by Sammy, shown to still be alive and blinded by rage, thinking Henry is the Ink Demon. Unmasked by Henry, Sammy tries to kill him but is instead killed by Tom. After Tom gains Henry's trust, Tom and Allison aid him in fighting off the Searchers and Lost Ones, who had been kept at bay by Sammy, and Henry falls into the Administrative Lobby. After repairing a set of pipes and killing the recurring Butcher Gang, he finds Tom and Allison. Henry learns that the Ink Demon has stolen something important from the film vault and enters his lair â€” a much vaster version of the Ink Machine â€” to retrieve it. Allison and Tom remain behind, fearing that the ink will absorb and corrupt them. Inside, Henry finds one last tape recording by Joey, expressing his regret for everything that has happened and asking Henry to destroy the Ink Demon. Henry finds the stolen item, a [[film reel]] marked "The End." The reel contains the end of all cartoons, and the Ink Demon chases him throughout the machine while transforming into a giant monster, Beast Bendy, the final boss of the game. Henry eventually plays the reel, projecting a "The End" title card on every available screen and causing Beast Bendy to dissolve into ink when he sees it.

The game suddenly changes to a flashback in the inside of Joey's home, with a bulletin board covered with letters from Allison Pendle, now married to Thomas Connor, and Wally Franks, now living in Florida, as well as sketches such as Bendy Land. Entering the kitchen, Henry finds Joey waiting to talk to him about the paths they took in their lives. After Joey tells Henry to visit the studio, Henry opens a door in the house and finds the warehouse directly behind it, repeating his opening lines from Chapter 1. It is presumed that Henry, Joey, and all of the studio's employees may be trapped in a [[time loop]] of unknown origin.

In a [[post-credits scene]], the camera focuses on a framed portrait of Bendy, Boris and Alice, which was a gift from Henry to congratulate Joey for his success (alongside a rusty ink machine sitting in one corner of the room). Just then, a little girl's voice asks "Uncle Joey" to tell her another story, suggesting that the entire game may have been a story or [[metaphor]] for the fall of Joey Drew Studios that Joey was telling to his niece.

The ending is left ambiguous, and the true nature of the studio is never directly confirmed.

As he started developing the idea, he realized that it felt "creepy" and needed a monster that inhabited it. Bendy was created to be that monster, but did not have a name.

The game's stoyline and setting were mostly praised. Most reviewers noted that the game's art style resembles the "[[Steamboat Willie]]" era of Disney's cartoons,<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|last=Warhurst|first=Sean|date=December 8, 2018|title=Bendy and the Ink Machine PS4 Review|url=http://www.impulsegamer.com/bendy-and-the-ink-machine-ps4-review/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929023611/http://www.impulsegamer.com/bendy-and-the-ink-machine-ps4-review/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|access-date=March 11, 2021|website=Impulse Gamer}}</ref> with ''PlayStation LifeStyle'' considering Bendy as an "obvious parallel" between other cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse or Betty Boop.<ref>{{Cite web|last=White|first=Lucas|date=November 27, 2018|title=Bendy and the Ink Machine Review â€“ Walt 'Literally Satan' Disney (PS4)|url=https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/11/27/bendy-and-the-ink-machine-review/#/slide/1|access-date=March 12, 2021|website=PlayStation LifeStyle}}</ref> Liam Martin of ''Express'' considered that the game's theme to be that "classic cartoons are more sinister than we remember".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Martin|first=Liam|date=January 1, 2019|title=PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch games: BEST indie titles, hidden gems, overlooked classics|url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/1064337/Hitman-2-Below-What-Remains-of-Edith-Finch-PS4-Xbox-One-Switch-hidden-gems-best-indie-game|access-date=March 12, 2021|website=Express}}</ref> Sean Warhurst of ''ImpulseGamer'' also considered the game's visuals as the game's "biggest strength" and that its graphics engine "complements the artistic direction".<ref name=":7" /> This was also considered by Barry Stevens of Entertainment Focus, considering that "the game has a really unique art style and really pulls off the old animation studio feel with everything being drawn in a 30s style".<ref name="entertainment focus">{{Cite web|first1 = Barry|last1=Stevens|date=November 27, 2018|title=Bendy And The Ink Machine Review|url=https://entertainment-focus.com/2018/11/27/bendy-and-the-ink-machine-review/|access-date=February 23, 2021|website=Entertainment Focus}}</ref>

Most websites considered the game's gameplay mechanics repetitive. ''TheXboxHub'' considered the game's combat mechanics "frustrating", as most of its enemies die in only one hit.<ref name="TheXboxHub" /> ''VGCultureHQ'' considered that if would have some range weapons in the second chapter, such as a gun or a slingshot, "would help make lengthy combat sequences feel more fair and less of a risk". However, it also stated that the boss battles in the game feel "intense".<ref name="VGCultureHQ" /> The puzzles, according to ''The Digital Fix'', were considered repetitive, saying that "It's something we've done a million times before".<ref name="The Digital Fix">{{Cite web|first1 = Colin|last1=Polonowski|date=December 4, 2018|title=Bendy And The Ink Machine Review|url=https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/review/bendy-and-the-ink-machine/|access-date=February 23, 2021|website=The Digital Fix}}</ref>

''VGCultureHQ'' considered the game's chapter lengths "too short" and without a "fair balance", considering that it could be completed in four hours, considering that the first and final chapters could be "finished in just under a half-hour", while the other three chapters "may take longer".<ref name="VGCultureHQ" /> According to ''Hely on Horror'', the first chapter serves as a "tutorial", as guides the player to "interact with the environment and solve simple puzzles", the second chapter is where combat is introduced, but it considered that the third chapter is where players are thrown into the action.<ref name=":3" /> Steven Asarch of ''Player.One'' considered the third chapter's task list as a "lazy attempt for developers to pad the game without adding any additional content", and that if future chapters could focus more on the characters development, "they could've truly be masterpieces".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Asarch|first=Steven|date=September 30, 2017|title=Bendy And The Ink Machine Chapter 3 Review: Alice Is Here|url=https://www.player.one/bendy-and-ink-machine-chapter-3-review-120462|access-date=March 11, 2021|website=Player.One}}</ref>

The game has been frequently compared with ''[[BioShock]]'', due to, according to ''PlayStation LifeStyle'', the game having an "antique style".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Keri|first=Honea|date=November 19, 2018|title=Release of the Week for 11/19-11/25 â€“ Bendy and the Ink Machine|url=https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/11/19/bendy-and-the-ink-machine-release-of-the-week/|access-date=March 12, 2021|website=PlayStation LifeStyle}}</ref> ''Nintendo Life'' also considered the motives of having a ''BioShock'' vibe in the game due to "the revelations that are made of Henry's past to the retro aesthetic that clings to every corner of the game's dilapidated setting". However, it also compared it to ''[[Resident Evil]]'', and ''[[Outlast]]'', considering it a "fusion".<ref name="NitendoLife" /> The game was also compared with ''[[Cuphead]]'' and ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', for their homages to "rubber hose" animation and the style of 20th-century cartoons.<ref name=":6" /><ref name="NitendoLife" /><ref name="The Digital Fix" />
