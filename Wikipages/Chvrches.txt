==History==

===Origins and formation===
In 2003, musicians [[Iain Cook]] and [[Martin Doherty]] met as students at the [[University of Strathclyde]] in Glasgow. Doherty was a member of the rock band Julia Thirteen, and asked Cook to produce some of the band's music. Although Julia Thirteen never recorded any further material, the experience proved vital, as Cook and Doherty formed a mutual partnership through music. A few years later, Doherty joined Cook as a member of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Aereogramme]], but the two quit in 2007 when they became frustrated with the band's sound and lack of exposure. Doherty was then offered a role as a touring member of [[The Twilight Sad]], but quit in 2012 after growing tired of playing someone else's music. The two had become jaded with alternative rock, and decided to start their own music project.<ref name="COS">{{cite web |last=Arroyo |first=Steven |url= https://consequenceofsound.net/2013/09/cover-story-chvrches/2/|title=Chvrches: Catching the Light |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |page=2 |date=22 September 2013 |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref>

A few years after Cook left [[Aereogramme (band)|Aereogramme]], he began listening to the American electronic music band [[Emeralds (band)|Emeralds]]. Inspired, Cook bought a [[Minimoog Voyager]] and began "playing around with soundscapes and stuff like that...kind of with a view of doing stuff from the '80s".<ref name="Tribune">{{cite web |last=Knopper |first=Steve |url= https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-chvrches-interview-ott-1023-20151019-story.html |title=Chvrches slows down a bit to gain perspective |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date= 22 October 2015 |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref> In September 2011, he produced an [[extended play]] for the band Blue Sky Archives, and asked vocalist and drummer [[Lauren Mayberry]] if she would be interested in singing backing vocals for an electronic music project he and Doherty were working on. Mayberry was intrigued by the offer, as neither of them had any background in electronic music. "For me it was nice to write over different instruments and not have to try to sing and scream over live drums and a Marshall bass stack," said Mayberry.<ref name="Under the Radar">{{cite web|last=Fink|first=Matt|url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/chvrches_-_the_under_the_radar_cover_story/|title=Chvrches - The Under the Radar Cover Story|work=[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]|date=19 November 2015|access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref>

The three musicians quickly bonded, and spent the next few months writing and recording songs in a basement studio.<ref name="Under the Radar"/><ref name="Newsweek">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2013/07/10/chvrches-most-addicting-band-summer-237696.html|title=Chvrches Is the Most Addicting Band of the Summer|last=Stern|first=Marlow|date=10 July 2013|access-date=28 August 2017|work=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref> During these sessions, Mayberry wrote the lyrics and [[hook (music)|hook]]s, Doherty provided melodic ideas, and Cook produced the songs.<ref name="Under the Radar"/> Once the sessions had concluded, the three decided that they worked well enough together to try and perform the songs as a band.<ref name="Paste"/> The initial plan was to have Doherty sing lead vocals, while Mayberry would sing backing vocals. Mayberry was eventually promoted to lead vocalist after Cook and Doherty heard her singing abilities.<ref name="Paste">{{cite web|last=Cosores|first=Phillip|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/12/chvrches-the-best-of-whats-next-1.html|title=Chvrches: The Best of What's Next|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=6 December 2013|access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref> In addition to her new role, Mayberry became the band's frontwoman, and gave the other members a reading list about the inner workings of the music industry.<ref name="The Guardian Chvrches">{{cite web|last=Wolfson|first=Sam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/13/chvrches-music-for-the-masses|title=Chvrches: Music for the masses?|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 June 2013|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref>

The band members settled on the name Chvrches (stylized as CHVRCHΞS), which uses the [[Latin alphabet|Roman letter]] "v" instead of a "u". This spelling was chosen to differentiate themselves from actual churches in online search results.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|last=Savage|first=Mark|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-20780332|title=BBC Sound of 2013: Chvrches|work=[[BBC News]]|date=31 December 2012|access-date=31 December 2012}}</ref> There was no conscious decision to have a name with religious connotations; instead, the band members felt that the name gave "a strong vibe that could be interpreted in many different ways".<ref name="Newsweek"/> Mayberry also noted that the v is a subtle nod to band names from the influential [[Witch house (genre)|witch house]] genre of music, including bands such as [[Salem (American band)|SALEM]] and [[Ritualz]]. "We did consider putting upside down crosses at either side of our name, but that would have dated us, I think" said Mayberry.<ref name="The Skinny">{{cite web|last=Gieben|first=Bram H.|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/interviews/chvrches-were-not-in-the-business-of-writing-chirpy-pop-songs|title=Chvrches: 'We're not in the business of writing chirpy pop songs'|work=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]|date=11 September 2013|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref>

=== 2012–2014: Breakthrough success, and ''The Bones of What You Believe'' ===
[[File:Chvrches - Live at HMV Forum (2012).jpg|thumb|Chvrches performing in 2012]]
Doherty noted how Chvrches began as a studio only project, saying: "There wasn't really any goal other than to put a song out on the internet and see what kind of response we got".<ref name="Time Out">{{cite web|last=Ken|first=Wong Boon|url=https://www.timeout.com/kuala-lumpur/music/chvrches-interview|title=Chvrches interview|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref> On 11 May 2012, Chvrches posted its debut song "Lies" on the [[Neon Gold Records]] blog. Instead of a picture of the band members, the song was accompanied by a picture of [[nun]]s in masks, which added to the perceived religiosity of the Chvrches name.<ref name="theguardian">{{cite web|last=Lester|first=Paul|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/26/new-band-churches|title=New Band of the Day – No 1,295: Churches|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 June 2012|access-date=3 October 2017}}</ref> The response was almost immediate; "[[Lies (Chvrches song)|Lies]]" reached number one on the [[MP3]] aggregate blog The Hype Machine, and similarly received constant airplay on [[SoundCloud]] and [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref name="Under the Radar"/> The band members were amazed by the reaction to "Lies". "It was unbelievable, way beyond what we expected," said Doherty.<ref name="Time Out"/>

Despite the popularity of "Lies", Chvrches had yet to perform a live show.<ref name="Paste"/> There was a growing expectation that the band would eventually perform live, although the band members were anxious at the prospect.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barker|first=Emily|url=https://www.nme.com/photos/35-massive-bands-recall-the-story-of-their-first-ever-gig-1406580|title=35 Massive Bands Recall The Story Of Their First Ever Gig|work=[[NME]]|date=11 November 2014|access-date=3 October 2017}}</ref> To curtail this fear, Chvrches played its first two live shows under the name Shark Week, before making its official debut at the [[Glasgow School of Art]] in July.<ref name="Under the Radar"/> When Chvrches began to attract [[Artists and repertoire|A&R representatives]], Mayberry was dismayed that most of them wanted to make her the central figure of the band; one representative called her the next [[Pixie Lott]].<ref name="The Guardian Chvrches"/> From the beginning, the band's goal was to give equal treatment to all three members, and to not have any one person become the focal point. As Doherty stated: "We could have sold 200,000 more albums if we'd hidden Iain and I from view and put Lauren on the cover of every magazine. We ended up doing it in an indie band style. We broke through via [[word of mouth]]. It was about doing it in an honest, right way."<ref name="Guardian 200,000">{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Rebecca|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/20/chvrches-we-could-have-sold-200000-more-records-if-we-hid-the-boys-out-of-view|title=Chvrches: 'We could have sold 200,000 more records if we hid us boys out of view'|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 August 2015|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> This mentality meant that the band had to decline early offers for photo shoots and interviews that excluded Cook and Doherty.<ref name="Guardian 200,000"/>

To promote Chvrches, managers McNeil and Danny Rogers launched a nonstop touring schedule which included several international performances.
