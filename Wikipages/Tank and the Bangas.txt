==Style==
Writing in ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]'', Heather Rudow described the group's work as "lively fusion of [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[spoken word]]."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rudow|first1=Heather|title=Things to Do in DC This Week January 11–13: Do Yoga and Dance to EDM at 6AM|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/01/11/things-to-do-in-dc-this-weekend-january-11-13/|access-date=28 February 2017|work=[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]|date=11 January 2016}}</ref> Speaking to the ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', the musicians in the group mentioned a variety of genres they identify with, including rock, folk, [[gospel music|gospel]] and Anjelika "Jelly" Joseph's invention "Soulful [[Disney]]".

==Reception==

In ''[[The Village Voice]]'', Rajul Punjabi described the group's debut album ''ThinkTank'' as "sincere and eclectic. Ball’s vocals are strong and versatile—evidence of her childhood in church—and she coasts through sweet melodies and wide-ranging vocal undulations reminiscent of [[Nicki Minaj]]’s character voices. She throws gentle shade when reminded of this — 'I’ve been doing that before she came out,' she says."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Punjabi|first1=Rajul|title=Tank and the Bangas Bring New Orleans Soul to New York City|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/tank-and-the-bangas-bring-new-orleans-soul-to-new-york-city-8713127|access-date=28 February 2017|work=Village Voice|date=8 June 2016}}</ref>

It all felt so organic and on-the-spot."<ref name=":0" /> Juror [[Trey Anastasio]] of [[Phish]] said, "I immediately loved this...Tank is a force of nature, just full of joy—and her band is killing in the background."<ref name=":0" /> The story of the evolution of Tank's voice was covered in an episode of NPR's World Cafe show for essential and emerging artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2019/07/09/739859405/the-evolution-of-tank-and-the-bangas-unique-voice|title=The Evolution Of Tank And The Bangas' Unique Voice|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>
