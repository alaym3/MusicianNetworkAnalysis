'''Xeno & Oaklander''' is an American [[electronic music]] group formed in 2004, consisting of musicians Sean McBride and Liz Wendelbo. Originating from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the band is considered to be among the [[cold wave (music)|cold wave]] revival scene of the 2000s and 2010s.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

==History==
[[Maryland]]-native Sean McBride and French-Norwegian conceptual artist Liz Wendelbo met in 2003; the former was involved in solo projects such as Moravagine and Martial Canterel, which were based on [[modular synthesizer]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. The duo started recording music in an abandoned factory building near the [[East River]]; its debut album, ''Vigils'', recorded in a single take, was released in 2006. The band then signed to [[Wierd Records]], which released 2009's ''Sentinelle''. Following its 2011 record ''Sets & Lights'', which was also released on Wierd and showcased elements from [[darkwave]], [[Italo disco]] and [[techno]], the duo issued the single "Sheen" for Electric Voice and collaborated with Fabian Marti, composing a soundtrack for the Swiss artist.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

Xeno & Oaklander signed to [[Ghostly International]] for 2014's ''Par Avion'', which featured [[Serge synthesizer]] and was inspired by [[synesthesia]].<ref name="allmusic-bio"/><ref name="exclaim-ghostly"/> Sessions for ''Par Avion'' produced 2015's ''Movements'', a 35-piece commissioned by National Center for the Arts, Grenoble and Ecole du Magasin.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> Following 2016's ''Topiary'' on Ghostly International, the duo released ''Movements II'', which was only available on their tour that May; in October, the bossa nova-tinged single "Moonlight" appeared on a split 7" released by the UK magazine Electronic Sound.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> Shortly thereafter the duo signed to [[Dais Records]], which issued the album ''Hypnos'' in 2019.<ref name="fact-dais"/>

==Musical style==
Labeled as a [[minimal wave|minimal synth]],<ref name="exclaim-sheen"/> [[synth-pop]]<ref name="allmusic-bio"/><ref name="fact-dais"/> and [[darkwave]] act,<ref name="essaiepas-guardian-newband"/> Xeno & Oaklander is considered to be among the key acts that revive and update the sounds of 70s and 80s' [[cold wave (music)|cold wave]] and [[minimal wave|minimal electronic]] bands, combining "crisp [[Analog synthesizer|analog synths]] with poetic songwriting and vocals."<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] critic Larry Fitzmaurice has described the band's cold wave-inspired music as "deadpan [[Do it yourself|D.I.Y.]] [[post-punk]] filtered through brutal drum machines and synth lines so brittle and thin you could practically snap them over your knee."<ref name="p4k-set-lights"/> Preferring to use analog gear and no post-processing,<ref name="tmt-interview"/> the band used [[Monophony|monophonic]] synthesizers during the ''Topiary'' era, while ''Hypnos'' signalled the reintroduction of [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] synthesizers and Wendelbo taking on sole vocal duties.<ref name="allmusic-hypnos"/><ref name="quietus-hypnos"/>
