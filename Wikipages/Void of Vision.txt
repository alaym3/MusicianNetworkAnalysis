==Musical style==
Void of Vision has been described as taking their musical and lyrical influences from bands such as [[Parkway Drive]], [[Architects (British band)|Architects]], [[System of a Down]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and others. Their genre has been described as metalcore, heavy metal, and [[djent]].<ref name="Mushroom" /> Their live performances have been described as being aggressive and erratic.<ref>[https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/void-vision Void of Vision]. [[Triple J Unearthed]]. Retrieved 12 December 2018.</ref>

== Controversy ==
On 4 February 2019, ''Wall of Sound'' released an article about US based [[metalcore]] band Glass Crown allegedly plagiarising Void of Vision's song "Ghost in the Machine". The song in question, titled "Lucid", featured similar guitar riffs almost identical to that in Void of Vision's song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2019/02/04/ummm-have-us-band-glass-crown-been-caught-out-blatantly-ripping-off-void-of-vision/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204231034/https://wallofsoundau.com/2019/02/04/ummm-have-us-band-glass-crown-been-caught-out-blatantly-ripping-off-void-of-vision/|title=Ummm, have US band Glass Crown been caught out blatantly ripping off Void of Vision?|last=brownypaul|archive-date=4 February 2019|date=4 February 2019|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=4 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://killyourstereo.com/news/1105888/the-brave-release-new-single-technicolor-set-new-album-aura-for-april/|title=The Brave release new single 'Technicolor', set new album 'Aura' for April|first=Alex|last=Sievers|publisher=KillYourStereo|date=8 February 2019|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref><ref name="spotify">{{cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/episode/0embyJWS3ZNbdNpfALrcdk?si=UH_AVlV6STKZy39E_4S-bg|title=Ocean Grove 'Ask for an Anthem' + Dealer Drop Heat {{!}} 10/2/19|author=The Backbone Sunday Sessions|medium=Podcast|date=10 February 2019|access-date=20 February 2019|via=Spotify}}</ref> A day later, Glass Crown frontman and songwriter Danny DiBella reached out to ''Wall of Sound'', responding to the accusations. He refuted that he was not aware of "Ghost in the Machine" before writing "Lucid", and if he had known they sounded so similar "Lucid" would not exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2019/02/05/exclusive-glass-crowns-danny-dibella-issues-statement-to-wall-of-sound-regarding-void-of-vision-plagiarism-accusations/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207020343/https://wallofsoundau.com/2019/02/05/exclusive-glass-crowns-danny-dibella-issues-statement-to-wall-of-sound-regarding-void-of-vision-plagiarism-accusations/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Glass Crown's Danny DiBella issues statement to Wall of Sound regarding Void of Vision plagiarism accusations|last=brownypaul|date=5 February 2019|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US|archive-date=7 February 2019|access-date=5 February 2019}}</ref> The track has since been removed online.
