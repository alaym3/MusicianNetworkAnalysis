'''Clifford Smith''' (born 29 September 1974), better known as '''Mr. Vegas''', is a [[Jamaica]]n [[dancehall]] musician.

==Biography==
Clifford Smith was born in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] in 1974.<ref name="Barrow">Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) "The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn.", Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-329-4}}, p.345</ref> The [[moniker]] "Mr. Vegas" was given to Smith by his schoolyard [[association football|football]]-mates, who thought that he kicked the ball like a [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] dancer. In his early years as a [[singjay]], Vegas sang covers of Jamaican hits at local parties and shows, and acquired a reputation as a troublemaker for his lyrics. During a scuffle over stolen master [[magnetic tape|tape]]s, Vegas was hit in the face with a [[crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] and had his [[oral surgery|jaw wired shut]] for six weeks. Vegas claims that, after hearing [[Beenie Man]]'s hit "Who Am I", he immediately demanded that his still-healing jaw be unwired, changing his speech pattern but allowing him to practice [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]].

He found fame in 1998 with hits such as "Yu Sure", "Jack It Up", and "Latest News".<ref name="Barrow" /> For his first major hit, Vegas versioned the wildly popular "Playground" Riddim ([[Sean Paul]]'s "Infiltrate" among others) to create "Nike Air", which became a huge hit in Jamaica. The next single, "Heads High", with an anti-[[oral sex]] lyric,<ref>Campbell, Curtis (2013) "[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130901/ent/ent3.html Oral Sex No Longer Taboo – Globalisation Changes Dancehall Into A More Tolerant Genre]", ''[[Jamaica Gleaner]]'', 1 September 2013. Retrieved 1 September 2013</ref> followed its success in Jamaica with a chart run in the UK and a No. 69 peak on the U.S. R&B chart, and Vegas became increasingly in demand as a guest artist by acts such as [[Sean Paul]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In 1998, his debut album, ''Heads High'' was released, which hit No. 5 on the US Reggae chart. Vegas won a [[MOBO]] for Best Reggae Artist for the ''Heads High'' album as well. 2000's single "Hot Gal Today" was a minor hit on the US R&B chart, peaking at No. 66. In 2001, he issued ''Damn Right'', featuring guest appearances from [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] and Big Yard; this album went to No. 2 on the US Reggae chart. 2004 saw the release of the ''Pull Up'' LP on Delicious Vinyl Records, and the title track scraped the bottom of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top 200]], peaking at No. 98 (as well as No. 68 on the R&B chart). In 2006, he did a [[Soca music|soca]] collaboration with [[Machel Montano]], "Dance with You" on Montano's [[B.O.D.Y. (album)|''B.O.D.Y.'']] album. His latest, 2007's ''Hot It Up'', featured the Jamaican hits "Hot Wuk", "Taxi Fare" and "Tek Weh Yuhself". In 2008, Mr. Vegas also recorded "On the Floor" with [[Trinidadian]] artist [[Destra Garcia]] on her album, ''Soca or Die''.

==Retirement==
In September 2008, Smith announced that he was retiring from the [[music industry]], citing unhappiness with his work and a desire to spend more time with his children and be "closer to God Almighty". Although he had been suffering from ill-health for some time, he denied that this was a factor in his retirement.<ref>Brooks, Sadeke (2008) "[http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20080925/ent/ent5.html Mr 'di do' Vegas quits music – Turns to God and kids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224051949/http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20080925/ent/ent5.html |date=24 December 2008 }}", ''Jamaica Star'', October 2008</ref> However, in 2009 and 2010 he made new songs such as "Man a Gallis", "Can't Stop Now" ([[Major Lazer]]), "Mix Up Peggy", "Wanna See You Move" (DJ GQ) and "Fi Get Rich".
