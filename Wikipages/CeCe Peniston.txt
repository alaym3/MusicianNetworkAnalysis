==Biography==

===1970–90: Early life===
Peniston was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in [[United States]], but spent the majority of her formative years in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where she was raised from the age of nine. She is the third of four siblings. The daughter of a former military father, Ronald Peniston (born 1934, married Barbara Anne in 1960), she started singing at church<ref name="chicagodefender">

===1990–91: ''Female Preacher''===
{{Quote box|width=300px|align=right|quote=''You know what's so funny is I was always the one that came in and slowed it down. That's what's so ironic about me putting out "Finally", because I was always the R&B person, the balladeer when I came in and did everything. Back then, there was a female rapper [Overweight Pooch] who was on A&M, and I was asked to do some background vocals. I came over, did the background vocals for her and the label heard it. They were like "We really like your flow, why don't you get your own single together?" Well at the time, I was writing poetry. So I took one of the poems, "Finally". I was thinking about dating in college, and how I hadn't found that Mr. Right. We went to the studio, finished it up, sent it off to the label and they loved it. And that's how everything got started. I came up with the melody and the lyrics to "Finally" and then R.K. [Jackson] and Felipe [Delgado], the guys I was working with at the time, put the music to it.''<ref name="5Mag"/>  |source=—said by Peniston interviewed by ''5 Chicago'' in 2006}}

Her music career began in January 1991, when [[Felipe Delgado (record producer)|Felipe "DJ Wax Dawg" Delgado]], her friend and a record producer based also in Phoenix, asked Peniston to record back-up vocals for [[Tonya Davis]], a black female rapper known as [[Overweight Pooch]] after her childhood nickname.<ref name="deseretnews"/><ref name="penistonbio"/><ref name="Phoenix New Times">
{{cite news|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1992-07-08/music/hip-hop-homegirls/|title=Hip-Hop Home Girls: A Trio of Women Puts the Valley on the Music Map|last=Koen|first=David|date=1992-07-08|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|publisher=[[Village Voice Media]]|access-date=2010-09-23}}</ref>

Davis, headed in a direction of a "new" [[Monie Love]], was searching for a singer to add vocals to the title track of her album ''[[Female Preacher]]'', which was to be released on [[A&M Records]] that summer. At a talent show she met a woman named [[Malaika (singer)|Malaika LeRae Sallard]], but when it came time to get Sallard into the studio, the rapper found she'd lost her future label-mate's number. When Delgado, who'd preferred Peniston instead, brought his favorite in to do background parts, the response from everyone was immediate, but did not move the Pooch to invite Peniston back for more vocals – unless she was successful in locating Sallard.<ref name="Phoenix New Times"/>

Later, as it became clear that Peniston was leaping from the Overweight Pooch's album to the top of the charts, rumor had it the Pooch was stewing over Peniston's using ''Female Preacher'' as her springboard. Tonya Davis, pregnant at the time of recording her album, swore she harbored no jealousy towards Peniston. "There's no jealousy, because she has a voice. I gave her the chance, but I didn't give her a voice,"<ref name="Phoenix New Times"/> the rapper insisted for ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' in July 1992, and Peniston, interviewed by the same newspaper in the meantime, reacted by her own words. ''"I feel like anything's possible and I know one thing. If I wasn't at this spot, I still would be achieving to get to this spot."''<ref name="Phoenix New Times"/> Ironically enough, Sallard eventually threw in a few back-up vocals for Peniston on a song with a significant title, "You Win, I Win, We Lose", while Peniston, who in return played an agent to get a record deal also for Malaika (whose album ''Sugar Time'' scored in 1993 two Top 5 hits on the [[US Dance]] chart, including the No. 1 single "[[Gotta Know (Your Name)]]") mentioned the Pooch's name on her own debut album in addition, leaving Davis a note saying ''"thanks for letting me be a part of Female Preacher"''.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Finally (Liner Notes)|title-link=Finally (CeCe Peniston album)|others=CeCe Peniston|year=1992|first=CeCe|last=Peniston|author-link=CeCe Peniston|type=Compact Disc|publisher=[[A&M Records]]|location=USA}}</ref>

Besides the Peniston's vocal performance on three tracks in total, of which "[[I Like It (Overweight Pooch song)|I Like It]]" was released as a single with a moderate success (at #16 in US Dance<ref>

But the Overweight Pooch's album flopped on the market, and A&M was the first major label for Delgado himself, who was facing contractual disputes with the record company. After [[Manny Lehman (disc jockey)|Manny Lehman]] (a [[Deejay|DJ]], then A&M [[Art Director]] and one of the [[executive producer]]s of ''Female Preacher'') also noticed the powerful voice of a still back-up vocalist, he offered Delgado a second chance, and commissioned him to produce a track for Peniston herself as a solo artist.<ref name="penistonbio"/> Not looking to lose his major deal connections, Delgado called on a hometown friend and music producer too, [[Rodney K. Jackson]] (they two met through mutual friends in Arizona), who was brought then to A&M family to help co-produce the Peniston's single, which was soon to be recognized as “[[Finally (CeCe Peniston song)|Finally]]”.<ref>

Despite an initial label's resistance to sign Peniston to more than a one-off single deal, the “Finally” session resulted in recording her own debut album after the final approval of A&M's [[Vice President]], Mark Mazzetti.<ref>

{{Quote box|width=217px|align=right|quote=''I was sitting in a Chicago pizza parlor in October and I heard over the radio 'Finally by CeCe Peniston'. I just started looking around going 'That's me! That's me!"''<ref name="closeup"/> |source=—Peniston recalled for ''[[Entertainment Weekly|EW]]'' magazine in 1992. (Almost 20 years later, when asked by [[KAJM|Mega 104.3]], she denied saying it, during her interview broadcast live on April 5, 2011.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p0qhpCUUAI|title=CeCe Peniston – Radio Interview – Mega 104.3|date=2011-04-05|work=[[KAJM]]|at=youtube.com|publisher=[[Camp Verde, Arizona]]|access-date=2011-06-30}}</ref>}}
Peniston was 21 years old when her debut single "[[Finally (CeCe Peniston song)|Finally]]" was released. The song burst on to the US club scene in the fall of 1991, where it became an instant dance anthem peaking, in October,<ref name="billboard"/> at the top of the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] for two weeks, while achieving a respectful starting position (at No. 29)<ref name="chartstats"/> overseas.

After her first song climbed the international charts, Peniston was headed into the studio to record a full-length album. However, she "had two months to pull the whole album together" and "didn’t realize the impact the record was having until it reached the top five". She also described how difficult it was to begin her career at such an extreme pace, but <ref name="penistonbio"/> the result was a solidly produced ten track collection titled ''[[Finally (CeCe Peniston album)|Finally]]'', issued in January of the following year.

Both the single and album entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Hot 100]], as well as the [[UK Top 75]] chart (at No. 5<ref name="billboard"/> and No. 2 for single,<ref name="chartstats"/> respectively at No. 70<ref name="billboard"/> and at No. 10 for album release<ref name="chartstats"/>), and ultimately earned Peniston a gold or silver certification in both countries. By the end of 1992 her debut (in Europe re-released in 1997 with a bonus remix "[[Finally '97]]") sold over 540,000 in United States.<ref name="finally LP sale">

"[[We Got a Love Thang]]", the second single (co-written by [[Chantay Savage]]), with a video clip in heavy rotation on TV music channels, went to No. 1 in the US Dance chart in February (No. 20 in the Hot 100),<ref name="billboard"/> and in England (where "Finally" skipped to No. 2 eventually<ref name="chartstats"/>) "We Got a Love Thang" peaked at No. 6.<ref name="chartstats"/> Who provided backing vocals on the album remains a source of contention. While on her album ''Finally'' [[Donell Rush|Darnnel Rush]] was credited, on its single release, the name of [[Kym Sims]] (who was a co-writer of "[[Keep On Walkin' (song)|Keep On Walkin']]") appeared as one of back-up vocalists.<ref>

With another hit record on the charts, Peniston began a year of touring clubs and small theaters in the US in support of her album. Her travels started with a series of shows in the Philippines, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy, and after her return to the US, Peniston continued with such R&B acts as [[Joe Public (band)|Joe Public]], the [[Cover Girls]], [[R. Kelly]] and [[LeVert|Levert]].<ref name="penistonbio"/>
While on tour, "Keep On Walkin'", a hip hop swinging composition, joined the list of Peniston's three consecutively running hits, bringing Peniston in June her third No. 1 in the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart (No. 15 in the Hot 100),<ref name="allmusic">

On October 17, ''Billboard'' magazine announced that Peniston was the leading nominee in the Billboard Music Awards, being nominated in four categories: three times in the dance category with "Finally" (Best New Artist, Best Female Artist and Best Director), and one in the R&B/Rap category (Best Female Artist) for her urban hit "Keep On Walkin'".<ref>

In the UK, Peniston was listed as the 20th of Top Selling Singles Artists in 1992.

Additional songs taken from album ''Finally'' achieved the [[Top 40]] status at least in the hip hop/R&B field. The grieving lyrics of her ballad "[[Inside That I Cried]]", co-written by Peniston's then-husband, Malik Byrd (who appeared also in its video), and produced in conjunction with [[Anita Baker]]'s cohort, Steve Lindsey, peaked at No. 10 in the US R&B (No. 94 in the Hot 100<ref name="billboard"/> and No. 42 in UK Top 75<ref name="chartstats"/>). The fifth single, a midtempo, "[[Crazy Love (CeCe Peniston song)|Crazy Love]]", climbed to No. 31 (No. 97 in the Hot 100<ref name="billboard"/> and No. 44 in UK<ref name="chartstats"/>).

By the end of the year, Peniston received several awards for her achievements in the music industry for 1992. Among them, one [[Billboard Music Award]] (as Best New Artist – Dance, the second went to the video director Claude Borenzweig), three [[ASCAP Awards]] (for Song of The Year, Most Performed Song of The Year, and Pop Songwriter of The Year), another three awards (as Best New Dance Artist, Best Dance Solo Artist, and for Best 12" Dance Record) at the [[Winter Music Conference|Annual Winter Music Conference]], and the [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI Urban Award of Achievement]].<ref name="firstclassent"/> The album itself was nominated on a [[1993 Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award '93]] in the [[Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Album, Female|Best R&B/Soul Album – Female]] category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsandwinners.com/category/soul-train-music-awards/1993/|title=1993 Soul Train Music Awards - Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Album, Female|date=1993-03-09|work=[[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train]]|at=awardsandwinners.com|publisher=[[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Holdings]]|access-date=2015-02-05}}</ref>

===1993–95: ''Thought 'Ya Knew''===
Within a year, Peniston was back in the studios to record her sophomore release, and the particular challenge for the vocalist was to avoid getting pigeonholed into the dance genre. For that reason, several ballads were arranged to appear on the final set (in the front with "Forever In My Heart", produced by [[Brian McKnight]]), of which, however, none was chosen for a single release. This time around, Peniston co-authored three of thirteen tracks ("Whatever It Is", "Give What I’m Givin" and "Maybe It's The Way",<ref name="penistonbio"/> a ballad about her father<ref name="saywhatnews.com"/>), and along with Manny Lehman and Damon Jones, who later became Peniston's manager, she was also credited as an executive producer of her scheduled album release, ''[[Thought 'Ya Knew]]''. Apart from others, also fellow Ohio-born singer [[Norma Jean Wright]] joined the session.<ref>

After a certain level of hesitation over the first single, "[[I'm in the Mood (CeCe Peniston song)|I'm in the Mood]]" (originally produced by [[Soulshock and Karlin]]) was picked to be the final leader—though as support for "[[Searchin' (CeCe Peniston song)|Searchin']]", which would be separately delivered on vinyl only to DJs. "I'm in the Mood" did well by itself, and with a video accompanied by a hip-hop remix from [[M-Doc]] & Jere M.C. (better known as In Da Soul) the title was on singles reproduced by [[David Morales]] for the dance floor. The song spawned Peniston's fourth No. 1<ref name="billboard"/> (dethroning from the top of the US Dance chart [[Aretha Franklin]]'s "A Deeper Love") and peaked at No. 16 in UK<ref name="chartstats"/> (#32 in the Hot 100<ref name="billboard"/>).
{{Quote box|width=234px|align=right|quote=''I guess the title tells you where I'm coming from with the new album. It's like I ''Thought 'Ya Knew'' I could do it, that I was coming right backatcha, real and honest.''<ref name="penistonbio"/> |source= —Peniston stated in her A&M biography}}
On January 25, 1994, the album ''Thought 'Ya Knew'', which was to represent Peniston's musical zenith at that time, arrived on all available formats, including [[digital compact cassette]]s. However, as the record promptly entered the music charts, it was soon to be evident ''Thought 'Ya Knew'' was not enjoying the high-profile success of her previous set ''Finally''. After its progress had stalled in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at No. 96,<ref name="billboard"/> ''Thought 'Ya Knew'' climbed to No. 31 in the UK,<ref name="chartstats"/> but the album charted for only two weeks in the UK.

Not certain about the second single either, "[[Keep Givin' Me Your Love]]" was accepted to become the British follow-up. But the track, remixed by [[Eddie Gordon]]'s West End production team, had no supporting music video, and after peaking at No. 36 in April in the United Kingdom,<ref name="chartstats"/> an alternative title ("[[I'm Not Over You]]") was chosen for the US market as the second cut from the ''Thought 'Ya Knew'' album.

"I'm Not Over You" (written by [[Steve Hurley]], [[Jamie Principle]], and M-Doc) might have missed the highest position of the US Dance chart, but only by about one point (at No. 2),<ref name="billboard"/> and the single was later classified in the overall ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart as the ninth most successful track of 1994 (leaving "[[I'm in the Mood (CeCe Peniston song)|I'm in the Mood]]" far behind, at #44). However, although the song had sealed the Top 10 of the US R&B chart, it did not succeed in the Hot 100 that much, failing to crack Top 40 (No. 41).<ref name="The Year in Music">
{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAgEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22i%27m+in+the+mood%22+peniston&pg=RA1-PA48|date=1994-12-24|title=The Year in Music 1994 &gt; Dance (pg. YE-74)|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|access-date=2010-09-23}}</ref> Considering that expectations of A&M Records company must have been bigger than a club play sale of Peniston's singles, "I'm Not Over You" was released in UK only on [[B-side]] of the "[[Hit by Love]]" release.

"Hit by Love" was to be the third song taken from the album. As with her previous releases, the song (with additional remixes by David Morales) became Peniston's next US Dance hit in a line of her No. 1s, but while on the top of the chart "Hit by Love" stayed for another week, the single stuck at No. 33 in the UK Top 75,<ref name="chartstats"/> as well as on the bottom positions of the American Hot 100 chart (at No. 90).<ref name="billboard"/>

Along with "Hit by Love" in the charts, A&M issued a rare compilation, ''[[Remix Collection (CeCe Peniston album)|Remix Collection]]'', in Japan with nine alternate versions of her songs previously available only on vinyl, which tracked Peniston's music career since the "Keep On Walkin'" release. A similar remix collection, however, consisting of only two singles ("Finally" and "We Got a Love Thang"), was earlier issued in Japan as an [[Extended play|EP]] under the title ''[[Finally / We Got a Love Thang: Remix Collection]]'' featuring overall eight remixed versions.

At the end of the year Peniston was named the No. 1 ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play Artist,<ref name="The Year in Music"/> summarizing all her songs released in 1994 ("I'm Not Over You" #9, "Hit by Love" #24, and I'm in the Mood" #44). While A&M was listed as the sixth best dance label in the ''Billboard'' Year-End chart, Peniston was also rated as the 5th Top R&B Singles Female Artist (behind [[Janet Jackson]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Mariah Carey]]).<ref>

In addition, a remix of "Keep Givin' Me Your Love" was popularized on the original motion picture soundtrack of the ''[[Prêt-à-Porter (film)|Prêt-à-Porter (Ready To Wear)]]'' film, and released in the U.S. after a one-year delay, scoring No. 4 in the US Dance charts in March 1995. "Keep Givin' Me Your Love" became Peniston's first song not to enter the Hot 100 chart (No. 101),<ref name="billboard"/> possibly as the result of appearing as a B-side on her previous release, and sharing its sales with the single "Hit by Love".

Between releases, Peniston made a jazzy cameo "Don't Forget the Love" with words and music by a [[Grammy Award]]-nominated composer, [[Jeff Lorber]], and [[Eric Benét]] (also a later Grammy Award nominee) for his album ''[[West Side Stories]]''. The title of the Lorber's album was his response to residing the [[West Los Angeles|West Side of L.A.]] (not an adaptation of songs from the musical ''[[West Side Story]]''), and after its issue in November 1994, the studio record peaked at No. 5 in the ''Billboard's'' list of [[Top Contemporary Jazz]] albums.<ref>

As a member of the gospel quintet called [[Sisters of Glory|The Sisters of Glory]], which included [[Thelma Houston]], [[Phoebe Snow]], Lois Walden, [[Albertina Walker]], and herself, Peniston also recorded a spiritual album, ''[[Good News in Hard Times]]'', that featured two solo traditionals ("[[How I Got Over]]" and "[[Precious Memories (hymn)|Precious Memories]]") performed by Peniston, four standards with her solo part ("Rough Side of the Mountain", "[[He's Got the Whole World in His Hands]]", "I Won't Be Back No More" and "[[Oh Happy Day]]"), as well as her chorus vocals on additional nine tracks. ''Good News in Hard Times'' (produced by Jennifer Cohen and Lois Walden) was released in August 1995 on [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros]], and the album brought Peniston an entry also in the ''Billboard'' [[Top Gospel Albums]] list, where it reached in October No. 29, remaining in the chart for 6 weeks.<ref>

===1996–98: ''I'm Movin' On'' and ''The Best Of'' album===
In February 1996, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' posted information that singer was putting the finishing touches to her new studio album, ''[[I'm Movin' On (CeCe Peniston album)|I'm Movin' On]]'', slated for its release in May. Judging from the magazine's earlier preview of several cuts, ''Billboard'' published that Peniston was about to explore more mature jeep-soul fare a la [[Faith Evans]], and that she has never sounded so assured and convincingly soulful.<ref>
{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_w4EAAAAMBAJ&q=billboard+%22movin%27+on%22+peniston&pg=PA36|last=Flick|first=Larry|date=1996-02-03|title=Artists & Music &gt; Dance Trax (pg. 36)|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|access-date=2010-09-23}}</ref> Though ''I'm Movin' On'' with a noticeably slimmed-down Peniston adorning its cover was not released until September, a similarly sleek sound marked its title single delivered to the radio stations on July 17, while hitting music stores one week later.

"[[Movin' On (CeCe Peniston song)|Movin' On]]", the song considered as the strongest track to reach core R&B listeners with potential across several genres, was produced by [[Dave Hall (record producer)|Dave "Jam" Hall]], the hit maker behind [[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]", whose earlier work included also [[Madonna]]'s ''[[Bedtime Stories (Madonna album)|Bedtime Stories]]'' album. The song cracked the Top 40 on the US R&B/Hip Hop at No. 29, but failed to show up in the UK chart, while scoring at weak No. 83 in the Hot 100.<ref name="billboard"/>

On September 9, ''I'm Movin' On'', the record with evident absence of her ever-dependable club workouts finally arrived. Peniston contributed to the set with three songs she co-wrote (except the title track, the ballad "The Last To Know" and a club potential, "Don't Know What To Do", that was not promoted). After peaking at No. 48 on the US R&B,<ref name="billboard"/> the album passed by the ''Billboard'' Top 200 Albums chart, and soon largely fell victim to mismarketing.
{{Quote box|width=220px|align=right|quote=

Despite insistence from the Peniston's management to release "[[Somebody Else's Guy#CeCe Peniston version|Somebody Else's Guy]]" as a follow-up, A&M label preferred an alternate composition, "[[Before I Lay (You Drive Me Crazy)]]", which featured Peniston's then-beau [[JoJo Hailey]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1996-08-18/entertainment/18020780_1_cece-peniston-movin-bits-and-pieces|title=The New Look of Cece Peniston|first=Denene|last=Millner|date=1996-08-18|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]|page=1|access-date=2011-07-20|quote=One of the songs is actually an R&B duet with her new boyfriend, Jodeci's JoJo Hailey}}</ref> (of [[K-Ci & JoJo]]) who was supposed to help establish Peniston as an R&B artist. But the duet reached its top in the US R&B already at No. 52,<ref name="billboard"/> with no entry in the Hot 100 chart (No. 121) or in England.

However, Peniston herself seemed to be not worried about losing her audience, when interviewed at the time of ''I'm Movin' On'' release by ''Billboard: "When you're first coming out as an artist, many times label executives have their own vision for you. But as you move forward, it's only fair that you begin determining your own direction. People will make the change with you as long as you’re honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that you’re doing,"''<ref>

After only two singles released from her R&B set, A&M did not decide to select a song that would cater to another music format, and capitulated to progress with ''I'm Movin' On'' album that Peniston promoted also during [[Bill Clinton]]'s election campaign, on which she performed several track from the set.<ref name="camp lo">

In September, A&M re-released the single "Finally" that re-entered the [[UK Top 75]] (No. 26<ref name="chartstats"/>), and also her debut album on CD enhanced with the new remix, [[Finally '97|Finally (Classic Funk Radio Mix)]], both re-issued only in the overseas.

In February 1998, a David Morales remix of "Somebody Else's Guy", originally popularized by [[Jocelyn Brown]] and recorded for the album ''I'm Movin' On'', became a hit in Europe, where it reached No. 13 in the UK Top 75 (as her last entry to date in England),<ref name="chartstats"/> as well as in April No. 26 in Japan, after being picked to promote Peniston's import greatest-hits collection simply titled ''[[The Best Of (CeCe Peniston album)|The Best Of]]''. The black and white photographs for its booklet were done by Daniela Federici, whose art work was noticed already on ''I'm Movin' On'' release, and later also on album and single covers of other female recording artists, such as [[Céline Dion]], [[Toni Braxton]], or [[Pink (singer)|Pink]].

After her departure from A&M Peniston contributed with two songs to the [[M.C. Magic]]'s compilation of various Phoenix-based artists called ''[[Desert Funk!]]'' that was issued on Nastyboy Records. The first title, "[[I Know You Want Me (Nastyboy Klick and CeCe Peniston song)|I Know You Want Me]]", was a hip-hop duet recorded in common with [[Nastyboy Klick]] (#109 on the US R&B<ref>

While looking for alternative options for the cancelled production of her album, Peniston decided to make a step back and record a cover version of "[[Lifetime to Love]]", written by Steven Nikolas and Brendon Sibley, for her ex-major label producer and the Manny Lehman's compilation ''[[Circuit Sessions 00.1 (Manny Lehman compilation)|Circuit Sessions 00.1]]''. The composition almost revived her No. 1 status in February 2001, returning her into the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play list, and delivering her a Top 3 entry also in the millennium (No. 2).<ref name="billboard"/> Although the song was at the end of the year classified as the 30th most successful US Dance track of 2001,<ref>

Timing prevented the deal's follow-through, unfortunately, and singer left 4 Play label afterwards.

===="Reminiscin"====
Following the millennium Peniston, no longer part of the mainstream that brought her success in the early '90s, spent the first decade supporting numerous recording artists of various musical styles and influences who would keep her in the music industry and in the public eye mostly as a guest, but prominent vocalist.
<br />In 2001, she collaborated with [[Ella Mae Saison]], a singer from Philippines, on a common track. The duet partially mixed in France, and partially in N.Y.C., was sponsored by a multiple world-champion boxer, [[Evander Holyfield]], and released on [[Holyfield's Real Deal Records|his record label]] in April. After its slow start, while being classified as the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Breakout No. 1 for [[Hot Dance Singles Sales|Maxi-Singles Sales]] category,<ref>

Peniston later commented on her recording with Saison, "I had the pleasure of working with a very talented and inspiring artist by the name of Saison. Last January 2001, we collaborated on a duet, Reminiscin. I was fortunate to witness the warmth of a beautiful personality and the great talent of a rising star. I hope the world will be allowed to share in this experience too."<ref>

===="For My Baby" and ''Colour of My Soul''====
Accompanied by a line-up of seven other female vocalists coming from both sides of the Atlantic, she joined Rob Derbyshire and Paul 'Solomon' Mullings, the [[Birmingham]]'s R&B production duo known as [[Full Flava]], to record lead vocals for their album ''[[Colour of My Soul]]''. The modern soul set was to be made in England, released on [[Dôme Records]] in 2003, and one of the compositions performed by Peniston, "[[For My Baby]]", was later given also a treatment for the dance floor with stand-out house mixes from [[The Str8jackets|Dave "Leggz" Longmore]] and Sam Junior Bromfield known as Ruff ’N’ Tumble, and duo KT & C.<ref>

"For My Baby" did not succeed on the music charts, however Ruf N Tumble's dance remixes of the song were based on a sample of the [[Delegation (band)|Delegation]] hit single "Heartache No. 9" (that scored at number fifty-seven in US Dance in 1980<ref>

Her second solo number on the Full Flava's compilation ''Colour of My Soul'' was titled "I Think about Him", and it was a mid-tempo that Peniston co-wrote with Derbyshire and Mullings.

===="Eternal Lover"====
Her next steps afterwards led to Better Days Studios in Paris where, for a change, singer was supposed to work with a French producer, Fréderic Tharreau alias BIBI, on exclusively import single "[[Eternal Lover]]". In addition to being released in France on RLPMix Records, the song was also issued in Australia and New Zealand on the domestic premier dance label, Vinyl Pusher Records, in 2004.<ref>

====''Gimme the Mike!'' and ''Hit Me, Baby, One More Time''====
Back to the States on 2 June 2005, Peniston appeared on the [[NBC]] network as a contestant of the summer's [[reality television|reality TV]] ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)#U.S. version|Hit Me, Baby, One More Time]]''.<ref>
{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0602065/|title=CeCe Peniston &gt; Self &gt; Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|date=2005-06-02|work=[[IMDb]]|publisher=([[Amazon.com]])|access-date=2010-09-23}}</ref>
During each program five former pop stars would sing their biggest hit plus a cover version of one contemporary hit, and every week the winner, picked by the studio audience, would get a donation of $20,000 in their name to a charity of free choice. Peniston competed on the show performing “Finally” plus a [[Faith Hill]]'s song, "[[There You'll Be]]", in favor of a hip-hop group, [[Arrested Development (band)|Arrested Development]] (the final winner of the program that night). When two years later asked, while being interviewed by the ''Say What News'' online magazine, Peniston would not confirm to record "There You'll Be" also in the studio.<ref name="saywhatnews.com"/>

====''Pastor Jones'' and ''Don't Touch if You Ain't Prayed''====
In the first half of 2005, Peniston wrapped up shooting an independent film called ''[http://www.maverickentertainment.cc/movies/158/don-t-touch-if-you-ain-t-prayed Don't Touch if You Ain't Prayed]''. Her character was a forty-year-old Christian woman saving herself for marriage, and the film featured gospel music performed by herself. In addition, Peniston took a small part in another urban Gospel film appealing to Christian market, ''[http://www.maverickentertainment.cc/movies/154/pastor-jones Pastor Jones]''.

On September 19, 2005, Peniston was invited to appear at [[Manhattan Center]], Grand Ballroom, NYC, to be present at the 2nd Annual [[Dance Music Hall of Fame]] Induction Ceremony, along with [[Wanda Dee]] (of KLF), [[Nile Rodgers]], [[Freddie Jackson]], and [[Kathy Sledge]].<ref>

An awards ceremony announcing the inductees in the event was to take place annually at a formal dinner event in New York, but due to financial differences among the Board members, the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceased operations after its second ceremony (in 2005).

===="Deeper Love"====
Peniston's following music project was a common duet with [[David Longoria]], a songwriter and trumpet player whose work was previously noticed on records of for example [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[George Michael]]. The union became successful when a composition combining jazz and dance music, "[[Deeper Love]]", written and produced by Longoria, after six weeks on the chart climbed to No. 14 in the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play (on November 19),<ref>

The single was released with the copyright owned by [[Del Oro Music]], and included eleven remixes from [[Junior Vasquez]], Ryan Humphries, L.E.X., and Richard Earnshaw. According to David Longoria's official web site, the newest radio version of "[[Deeper Love#Deeper Love 2018|Deeper Love 2018]]" is directed at Rhythmic Radio and to be issued in the Summer of 2018.<ref>

Her cover version was attached to Full Flava's retro album, ''[[Music Is Our Way of Life]]'', which reconstructed eleven dancefloor classics in total, and the compilation was released on Dôme. The Peniston's track was remixed by a Japanese producer, DJ Hasebe, to be featured in his disco medley named after the song, and for the purpose of a limited-edition single available only in Japan on vinyl.

===="I'm Feelin' U"====
In 2007, Peniston teamed up with US house DJ [[Ron Carroll]] for a funky bomb, "[[I'm Feelin' U]]", which was released in May on the [[Soulfuric Recordings]] label. The song caught an attention in the European clubland (No. 2 in the DJ House chart)<ref>

===="Shame Shame Shame"====
Her following promotional single, "[[Shame Shame Shame (Soulshaker and CeCe Peniston song)|Shame Shame Shame]]", released in UK in June 2007, was co-written by [[Soulshaker|Matt]], [[Soulshaker|Warren Meyers]] and [[Soulshaker|Kelly Mueller]], better recognized as [[Soulshaker]] (alias The Soul Shakers). The British music producers' team produced for Peniston a composition, which by the end of the year achieved several No. 1 statuses within specialized UK magazine charts (including No. 1 Music Week Pop Tip Chart, No. 1 Music Week Club Chart, and No. 1 DJ Mag Hype Chart<ref>

While in England Shame Shame Shame" was issued on the [[All Around the World (record label)|AATW]] label, in the States the title was released on Trackworks Records in several promo editions.

On August 26, 2007, one year after her interview for ''5 Chicago Mag'', Peniston mentioned again her plans regarding a new album project also for ''Say What News'', however she did not go further this time. When asked, with whom from the industry she would like to once collaborate, she named the winner of twenty-two Grammy Awards, [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref name="saywhatnews.com"/>

===="Still I"====
[[File:Penistondelgado2007crop.JPG|thumb|left|Also with Delgado after their reunion in 2007 at Chaton Studios]]
Originally, the potential release of an [[R&B]] song after a lengthy absence, "[[Still I]]", was to be cancelled, but the final record actually leaked out after one of the producers, allowed the Adrenaline Music company to distribute the song.
<br />Behind the song's production were recognized Peniston's former folks from Arizona, [[Felipe Delgado (record producer)|Felipe Delgado]] and Jackson (both in charge of her initial hit, “Finally”, from 1991) who reunited in 2005 to form a new production crew, collectively known as SandWorx, altogether with Nick "Cello" Valentine (which joined them in the spring of the following year). Though Peniston herself, who supported the trio by performing live in the Next In club in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], did not consider the record as strong enough to be offered for sale, "Still I" was eventually released as a four-track virtual single in September 2007, and the session that was supposed to rejoin the former producers with Peniston ended up with an apparent contradiction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=23117&cat=16|title=New Singles Releases by CeCe Peniston and Krieg Nation on iTunes|first=Lautel|last=Okhio|date=2007-09-18|work=TransWorldNews.com|publisher=TransWorldNews|access-date=2010-09-23 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120229182646/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=23117&cat=16 |archive-date = February 29, 2012 |url-status     = dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The rest of to date unreleased recordings are songs titled "Wonder Woman", "Next to Me" and "[https://www.myspace.com/waxmuseum01 Right Here]".<ref>

===="Above Horizons"====
However, the year of 2008 also passed with no significant news regarding her new solo studio project, the following June Peniston released "[[Above Horizons]]", a national [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] anthem as a tribute to the families, teachers and communities who help children reach their dreams through the PTA, Parent Teacher Association, which resulted from her role being a National Ambassador of the US largest volunteer child advocacy organization. The ballad was written by Byron V. Garrett, Peniston, Erric Carrington, Essej and Marcus L. Barnum, and the CD promo release, issued on [[National PTA Recordings]], included overall four versions. Among others, also two mixes from a Detroit house music producer and DJ, [[Aaron-Carl Ragland]], who listed one of Peniston's compositions ("Nobody Else" from 1998) as one of his musical influences.<ref>

On June 17, 2009, ''Chicago Defender'' interviewed the artist, who declared that after over a decade she was about to finish recording her comeback album. Although she did not concrete its release date, Peniston revealed that she was working with such likes as Track Kingz West, Vudu, Status ("Above Horizons"), David Givens, [[Montell Jordan]] (on their common duet "He Say, She Say"), [[Mateo (singer)|Mateo]] (on "Piece of That"), Isalene Elliot, and Ragland. ''“Once I reach an agreement and sign with a record company, the album will drop,”''<ref name="chicagodefender"/> she added. One month later, Peniston confirmed information regarding her new studio album live as a guest of the [[Wendy Williams (media personality)|Wendy Williams]] birthday show, during which she performed "Finally". Subsequently, the diva allowed to prelisten a few of her new recordings to her community via her [[myspace.com]] page. Among them, the song "[[Runway (CeCe Peniston song)|Runway]]" met with instant positive feedback due to its hip-hop/dance sound comparable to [[Timbaland]]'s production. After a New York correspondent, Kenya Thomas, questioned Peniston for ''Skinny'', she wished to subtitle the album ''[[CeCe (album)|CeCe]]''.<ref>

==Personal life==
In 1992, subsequent to the release of the debut album ''Finally'', Peniston was briefly married<ref name="penistonbio"/> to Malik Byrd, who co-wrote "Inside That I Cried" and appeared by her side also in its video.<ref>

This relationship ended soon after the series ended.

While Peniston's late mother, Barbara Anne Quick Peniston (born August 25, 1938 in [[Brooklyn, New York]]), was also her manager,<ref name="camp lo"/> one of Peniston's brothers, Gregory, now manages Cece. She previously had a financial struggle with a former account manager, Alvin Grubman, of Grubman and Associates out of New York City. Grubman and Associates created a tax debt for Peniston.

==Controversies==
===Plastic surgery===
With the exception of her formative years when she was crowned a beauty queen, Peniston was struggling with her weight, constantly. "When I first got in this business, People were actually erupting in fits of laughter when I introduced myself, but I was comfortable with who I was, but that was an issue for the record company,"<ref name="5Mag"/> she disclosed in 2006. "But see in this day and age where I'm at, it wouldn't be a problem for the record company, I'm going to make sure that it's not. But for somebody who's getting into the business, realize that you're a commodity, and if the record company's investing in you, make sure that you invest in yourself. Look is important because people see the physical first,"<ref name="5Mag"/> she was advising up-comers in the ''5 Magazine'' interview.

However, three years later, in November 2009, Peniston herself was spotted in [[Culver City, California]] posing for ''[[Inside Edition]]'' (produced daily at the [[CBS Broadcast Center]] in N.Y.C.), which first revealed details about her radical physical makeover and tumescent liposuction she, reportedly, got recommended by her new record executives.<ref name="surgery">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_tvdg/release?id=23400|title=CBS Television Distribution Releases &gt; Popstar CeCe Peniston Goes Under the Knife and Invites Inside Edition Along on Her Journey|date=2009-11-19|work=[[Inside Edition]]|at=[[CBS Television Distribution|CBSexpress.com]]|publisher=([[CBS Broadcasting, Inc.|CBS Broadcasting]])|access-date=2010-09-23}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
In addition, she was featured in several national celebrity news and fashion magazines, including the national ''[[Us Weekly]]'',<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.infiniskin.com/US_Weekly_Magazine.html|title=News &gt; Medical: Plastic Surgery &gt; Dr. Hall: Featured on US Weekly Magazine: CeCe Peniston's Plastic Surgery Makeover|date=March 2009|work=[[Us Weekly]]|at=InfiniSkin.com|publisher=([[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media LLC]])|access-date=2010-09-23|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806125248/http://www.infiniskin.com/US_Weekly_Magazine.html|archive-date=August 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> which tracked her progress as she sought to lose weight through plastic surgery. The surgery was a “hit” for Peniston, who then claimed to ''"feel great"''<ref name="surgery"/> after having liposuction, fat removed from her neck.

===Misunderstanding with Monica===
American R&B singer [[Monica (singer)|Monica]], whose first two singles made her the youngest recording act to ever have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Top R&B Singles chart in 1995 was interviewed by a gossip blog in 2008. The younger singer outspokenly talked about her professional life, upcoming wedding as well as her past relationships. During the interview she recalled her manager-cousin Melinda asking CeCe Peniston, "who was huge at that time", if Monica could sing for her. Monica remembered Peniston being "rude" and doing "everything she possibly could while I sang", and that she was "devastated" by the experience.<ref name="monica">
{{cite web|url=http://necolebitchie.com/2009/03/15/woman-to-woman-monica-and-cece-peniston-talk-it-out|title=Categories &gt; Celebrities &gt; Woman to Woman: Monica and CeCe Peniston Talk It Out|first=Necole|last=Bitchie|date=2009-03-15|work=NecoleBitchie.com|publisher=(Necole Bitchie)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320081241/http://necolebitchie.com/2009/03/15/woman-to-woman-monica-and-cece-peniston-talk-it-out|archive-date=2009-03-20|access-date=2010-09-23}}</ref>

A friend of Peniston had brought the article to her attention later, and she responded to Monica via the social networking website [[MySpace.com]], saying that she did not recall the event but wanted to apologize for it, saying she had always encouraged and supported children and speculating that she may have been distracted by her staff at the time. Peniston said "At that time I was young and still pretty new to the industry myself, and so I hadn't learned how to balance everything just yet. It really hurts me that I made you feel like that."<ref name="monica"/> Monica thanked her for the apology, and for caring "after all the years have passed".<ref name="monica"/>

==Charity work==
===LOTS alias CeCe Peniston Youth Foundation===
{{Quote box|width=280px|align=right|quote= ''"Have a good foundation of people around you who will tell you the truth no matter what, continue to love what you do and be willing to grow and make changes within yourself. You should also have a good spiritual foundation, accept the good and the bad and analyze it. Once you know the peaks and valleys are going to be there, then you accept it a whole lot better."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exceptionalmag.com/people/peoplebriefs8.html|title=Extraordinary Profiles &gt; CeCe Peniston – A Soulful and Captivating Diva (pg. 8)|work=Exceptional Mag|publisher=(Atela Productions)|access-date=2010-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921213225/http://www.exceptionalmag.com/people/peoplebriefs8.html|archive-date=September 21, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> |source= —Peniston's thoughts on longevity for ''Exceptional Mag''.

Originally in 1997, singer, along with her friend Heather, founded the CeCe Peniston Youth Foundation to help raise funds for many other organizations, particularly those concerned with HIV/AIDS, women and children in need, hunger and the equality of mankind.<ref name="saywhatnews.com"/> After the [[September 11, 2001]] tragedy, [[Michael Jackson]] requested her presence for his "United We Stand" concert to benefit the families of [[9/11]]. She has also blazed two tracks ("[[The Christmas Song]]" and "[[What a Wonderful World]]) on the albums ''[[Merry Arizona Two: Desert Stars Shine at Christmas|Merry Arizona II]]'' and ''[[Merry Arizona 97: Desert Stars Shine at Christmas|Merry Arizona 97]]'', with proceeds going to [[multiple sclerosis]]. She had been requested to perform for U.S. troops on the U.S.S. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1993, and has continued to travel to entertain the U.S. troops overseas since.<ref name="firstclassent"/>

Later in 2006, the foundation was to be re-named as the LOTS Foundation (Lifting Others To Succeed), after her statement in the interview for ''5 Mag'' in June the same year, and she was planning doing a benefit for cancer research, because of her father, a cancer survivor.<ref name="5Mag"/>

===National PTA Ambassador===
In October 2008, singer was along with [[Dara Torres]] named a [[Ambassador|National Ambassador]] for the [[Parent Teacher Association]], which is the largest volunteer child advocacy organization with more than 5 million members. In her new role, she visited with hundreds of children across the country to reinforce the importance of an arts education and pursuing their dreams. She also joined parents and educators to work toward improving the lives of children, as well as urging families to be more involved.<ref>
