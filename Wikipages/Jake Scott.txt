'''Jacob E. Scott III''' (July 20, 1945 – November 19, 2020) was an American professional [[American football|football]] player who was a [[Safety (American football position)|free safety]] and [[punt returner]] from [[1970 in sports|1970]] to [[1978 in sports|1978]] for the [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Washington Redskins]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL).  Scott went to the [[Pro Bowl]] five consecutive times between 1971 and 1975.  He recorded 35 [[interception]]s in his six seasons as a Dolphin, and another 14 in his three years with the Redskins.  He was also a five-time [[All-Pro]] and was the MVP of Super Bowl VII.

Scott wore number 13 throughout his career, which was later made famous in Miami by [[Dan Marino]], and has since been retired in Marino's honor.

==College career==
After growing up in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], but playing high school football in [[Arlington, Virginia]] at [[Washington-Lee High School]], Scott played [[college football]] at the [[University of Georgia]], where he led Georgia in [[interception]]s in 1967 with six interceptions and 1968 with ten interceptions.  In 1967, Scott was named first-team All-[[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] [[defensive back]] by the [[Associated Press]], and in 1968 again in both the AP and the [[UPI]]. The ten interceptions in a season is now second-most in Georgia history behind [[Terry Hoage]]’s 12 in 1982.  Scott's 175 return yards on interceptions in 1968 is also second all-time for Georgia.

Scott's college career total of 315 interception return yards is the most in school history. He also holds the current Georgia record for career interceptions.

Scott was inducted into the [[Georgia Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1986 and the Athens (GA) Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.

It was announced on May 17, 2011 that Scott had been selected for induction into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weiszer |first1=Marc |title=Reclusive Jake Scott going into College Football Hall of Fame |url=https://www.savannahnow.com/article/20110518/sports/305189806 |website=savannahnow.com |publisher=GateHouse Media, LLC |access-date=4 August 2019}}</ref>

Scott left the University of Georgia after his Junior year to go to Canada and play professional football  in the [[CFL]]. Based on his July 20 birth date, Scott's military draft lottery number of record was 187. The highest administrative draft number called for Scott's year group was 195, suggesting that Scott could  have been, but was not, drafted for military service during the [[Vietnam War]] as he had previously served in the [[U.S. Marines]].

==Professional career==
Scott began his professional career in 1969 in the [[Canadian Football League]] as a flanker and kick returner with the [[BC Lions]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jake Scott Stats|url=https://www.profootballarchives.com/players/scot03600.html|website=profootballarchives.com|access-date=6 November 2020}}</ref> He was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the Miami Dolphins in seventh round of the [[1970 NFL Draft]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1970/draft.htm|title=1970 NFL Draft|publisher=Football References|access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> where in his rookie year, he recorded five interceptions and returned one punt return for touchdown.  The following year, he recorded seven interceptions and 318 punt return yards, helping the team reach [[Super Bowl VI]], which they lost 24-3 to the [[Dallas Cowboys]].  Scott recorded a 21-yard punt return in the game.

Scott was a key member of the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins undefeated season]], and was named [[Super Bowl MVP]] of [[Super Bowl VII]], recording two interceptions in the Dolphins' 14-7 win over the [[Washington Redskins]] including one in the fourth quarter.{{ref|MVP}}  He helped the Dolphins in their 24-7 [[Super Bowl VIII]] win, recording two fumble recoveries, 20 punt return yards, and 47 kickoff return yards in that game. He established 2 Super Bowl Records. Scott set a record by being the first player to recover 2 [[fumbles]] in one game. He also first established the record for most career fumble recoveries in Super Bowls at two, a record now shared by 12 others. Scott is still the only player to have recovered one of his own team's fumbles and one of his opponent's fumbles in a single Super Bowl game.{{ref|Super}}

Overall, Scott finished his nine seasons with 49 interceptions. He made 35 interceptions playing 6 seasons for Miami, making him the Dolphins' all-time leader in that category.{{ref|AllTime}} Scott had 13 fumble recoveries in his career.  On special teams, he gained 1,357 yards and a touchdown returning punts, and 137 yards on six kickoff returns. Scott played for the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] the final 3 years of his career.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jake Scott: Career Stats |url=https://www.nfl.com/players/jake-scott-2/stats/ |website=nfl.com |publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>

He was inducted into the Georgia-Florida Hall of Fame in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hall of Fame Past Inductees |url=http://www.coj.net/departments/jacksonville-economic-development-commission/sports-and-entertainment/hall-of-fame-past-inductees.aspx |website=coj.net |publisher=Official City of Jacksonville and Duval County Government Website |access-date=4 August 2019}}</ref> The [[Professional Football Researchers Association]] named Scott to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2007 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.com/hall-of-very-good-2007.htm |title=Hall of Very Good Class of 2007 |access-date=November 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707030855/http://www.profootballresearchers.com/hall-of-very-good-2007.htm |archive-date=July 7, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
