==Career==
Paulsen first voice acting role came in 1983 with the mini-series ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'', where he played [[Snow Job (G.I. Joe)|Snow Job]] and [[Tripwire (G.I. Joe)|Tripwire]]. A few years later, his career launched into more roles such as Cobra Slavemaster and reprising Snow Job and "Tripwire" on ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'', Corky on ''[[Snorks|The Snorks]]'', Marco Smurf on the later seasons of ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', "Boober" on the animated version of ''[[Fraggle Rock: The Animated Series|Fraggle Rock]]'', [[Hadji (character)|Hadji]] in ''[[The New Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'' and the title character Saber Rider and the villain Jesse Blue on ''[[Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs]]''.

During the 1980s, Paulsen also explored the field of live action films. His first movie was ''[[Eyes of Fire (film)|Eyes of Fire]]'' in 1983. He played supporting roles in ''[[Body Double]]'', ''[[Stewardess School]]'', ''[[Warlock (1989 film)|Warlock]]'', and ''Mutant on the Bounty''. He appeared in television shows during this time as well, such as ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''. He mentioned in an interview, regarding his role in ''Body Double'', that he would not want his child (who was very young at the time of the interview) to see the movie, so he could not really be proud of his work.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Paulsen became more prevalent in the world of advertising as well. In the 1980s, he had been the announcer for the [[sitcom]] ''[[Cheers]]'' and continued to secure roles as an announcer. He appeared as the voice of [[Mr. Opportunity]], spokesman of [[Honda]] commercials on TV and radio,<ref name="USA Today"/> the announcer for ''Buffalo Dick's Radio Ranch'', and the spokesman for [[Lucky Stores]], a West Coast grocery store chain, before it was acquired by [[Albertsons]] in 1998. He provided the voice of Dog in the [[Taco Bell]] kids meal commercials from 1996 to mid-1997, with [[Eddie Deezen]] as the voice of Nacho the cat.

However, Paulsen's most famous advertising role was in the original commercial of the now ubiquitous [[Got Milk?]] campaign. The famous commercial, ''Who shot [[Alexander Hamilton]] in that famous duel?'', aired in 1993, and launched the ''Got Milk?'' campaign into a monstrously successful enterprise. Paulsen continues to be one of the most sought-after commercial voice actors in the industry. He can be currently heard as the voice of singing Mr. Mini-Wheat in the [[Frosted Mini-Wheats|Mini-Wheats]] commercials in Canada.

From 1987 to 1995, Paulsen voiced [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] and various supporting characters in the original 1987 ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' series. Originally starting as a five-part miniseries, the series continued for ten seasons and 193 episodes. It was a great success and became an instant pop culture symbol. Paulsen has said that Raphael's voice is very similar to his natural voice.

He returned to the franchise as [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] for the 2012 ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' series on [[Nickelodeon]], which ran for five seasons and 124 episodes from September 29, 2012 until November 12, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williamson |first=Anna |date=September 28, 2012 |title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' – preview |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a408997/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-returns-preview.html |access-date=March 10, 2019 |website=Digital Spy}}</ref> He also reprised his role as 1987 Raphael in the multiple 1987/2012 crossover episodes.
