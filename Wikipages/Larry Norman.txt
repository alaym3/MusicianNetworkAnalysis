Cook, 1996):21.</ref> In the 1980s, he complained that Christian music generally meant "sloppy thinking, dishonest metaphors and bad poetry," and that he had "never been able to get over the shock of how bad the lyrics are."<ref name=twoln1984-2>{{cite web |url=http://twoln.clutteredsoul.com/intvw84.html |last=Norman |first=Larry |title=Strait Interview 1984 |website=Cluttered Soul: The Words of Larry Norman |access-date=August 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212125931/http://twoln.clutteredsoul.com/intvw84.html |archive-date=December 12, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Word Records signalled they planned to end their relationship with Solid Rock due to poor sales performances of a few of the albums and the infrequent nature of releases being delivered by the label and this news led to a breakdown in the working and personal relationship between Larry Norman and Philip Mangano in May 1980. Some discussions had already begun about certain artists being released from their contracts prior to the meeting on June 17, 1980, which was called to "clear up the relationship between Solid Rock and Street Level Artists Agency, and to deal with Daniel Amos' request to have all their contracts back from Solid Rock — management, recording, tapes, publishing, and so on" and which ended two hours later in stalemate and acrimony rather than resolution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thornbury |first=Gregory Alan |year=2018 |title=Why Should The Devil Have All The Good Music: Larry Norman & The Perils of Christian Rock |publisher=Convergent Books |pages=180–202}}</ref>
