'''Clyde Jackson Browne''' (born October 9, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who has sold over 18 million albums in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database#|publisher=RIAA|access-date=February 21, 2013|quote=Use advanced search for Artist Name = Browne, Jackson}}</ref>

Emerging as a precocious teenage songwriter in mid-1960s Los Angeles, he had his first successes writing songs for others, writing "[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]" as a 16-year-old; the song became a minor hit for the German singer and [[Andy Warhol]] protégé [[Nico]] in 1967. He also wrote several songs for fellow Southern California bands [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] (with whom he was briefly a member in 1966) and the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], the latter of whom had their first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']] Top 40 hit in 1972 with the Browne co-written song "[[Take It Easy]]".

Encouraged by his successes writing songs for others, Browne released his [[Jackson Browne (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1972, which spawned two Top 40 hits of his own, "[[Doctor, My Eyes]]" and "[[Rock Me on the Water]]". For his debut album, as well as for the next several albums and concert tours, Browne started working closely with [[The Section]], a prolific session band that also worked with a number of other prominent singer-songwriters of the era. His second album, ''[[For Everyman]]'', was released in 1973, and while it lacked an enduring single, has been retrospectively assessed as some of his best work, appearing highly on several "Best Album of All Time" lists. His third album, ''[[Late for the Sky]]'', was his most successful to that point, peaking at number 14 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, and earning Browne his first [[Grammy]] nomination for Album of the Year. His fourth album, ''[[The Pretender (album)|The Pretender]]'', continued the pattern of each album topping the previous by peaking at number 5 on the album chart, and spawned the hit singles "[[Here Come Those Tears Again]]" and "[[The Pretender (Jackson Browne song)|The Pretender]]".

It would be the 1977 album ''[[Running on Empty (album)|Running on Empty]]'', however, that would be his signature work, peaking at number 3 on the album chart, and remaining there for over a year. Both a [[live album]] and a [[concept album]], the songs on the album explore the themes of life as a touring musician, and the album was recorded both on stage, and in places touring musicians spend time when not playing, such as hotel rooms, backstage, and in one case on a moving [[tour bus]]. The album produced two Top 40 singles, "[[Running on Empty (song)|Running on Empty]]" and "[[The Load-Out]]/[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]", and many of the other tracks became popular radio hits on the [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] format.

Successful albums continued through the 1980s, including the 1980 album ''[[Hold Out]]'', his only number 1 album, the non-album single "[[Somebody's Baby]]", which was used in the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', and 1983's ''[[Lawyers in Love]]'', which included the hit single "[[Tender Is the Night (song)|Tender Is the Night]]". In 1986, he released ''[[Lives in the Balance]]'', which had several radio hits and included the introspective "[[In the Shape of a Heart]]", which was inspired by the suicide of his first wife a decade prior. His string of hit albums came to an end at that point, as his next several albums failed to produce a gold or platinum [[RIAA]] rating.

He released two compilation albums, ''[[The Next Voice You Hear: The Best of Jackson Browne]]'' in 1997, and ''[[The Very Best of Jackson Browne]]'', released in conjunction with his [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction in 2004. His most recent studio album is 2021's ''[[Downhill from Everywhere]]'', the follow-up to 2014's ''[[Standing in the Breach]]'', which included the first fully realized version of his song "[[The Birds of St. Marks]]", a song he had written at age 18. In 2015, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked him as 37th in its list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]]".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-songwriters|title=100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=March 28, 2018}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Browne was born October 9, 1948, in [[Heidelberg]], Germany, where his father Clyde Jack Browne, an American serviceman, was stationed for his job assignment with the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' newspaper.

He attended [[Sunny Hills High School]] in [[Fullerton, California]], graduating in 1966.

===Songwriter for others===
After graduating in 1966, Browne joined the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], performing at the [[Golden Bear (nightclub)|Golden Bear]] ([[Huntington Beach, California]]) where they opened for [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]. The band later recorded a number of Browne's songs, including "These Days", "Holding", and "Shadow Dream Song".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jackson-browne/biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113213909/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jackson-browne/biography |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 13, 2013 |title=Jackson Browne Biography |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=February 17, 2016}}</ref> He also spent a short time in his friend [[Pamela Polland]]'s band, Gentle Soul. Browne left the Dirt Band after a few months and moved to [[Greenwich Village]], New York, where he became a staff writer for [[Elektra Records]]' publishing company, Nina Music, before his eighteenth birthday. He reported on musical events in New York City with his friends Greg Copeland and Adam Saylor. He spent the remainder of 1967 and 1968 in Greenwich Village, where he backed [[Tim Buckley]] and singer [[Nico]] of the [[Velvet Underground]]. In 1967, Browne and Nico were romantically linked and he became a significant contributor to her debut album, ''[[Chelsea Girl (album)|Chelsea Girl]]'', writing and playing guitar on several of the songs (including "[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]"). In 1968, following his breakup with Nico, Browne returned to Los Angeles, where he formed a folk band with [[Ned Doheny]] and Jack Wilce, and first met [[Glenn Frey]].

Browne's first songs, such as "Shadow Dream Song" and "These Days", were recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, [[Tom Rush]], Nico, Steve Noonan, [[Gregg Allman]], [[Joan Baez]], the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[the Byrds]], [[Iain Matthews]], and others. Browne did not release his own versions of these early songs until years later. Soon after this, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' mentioned Browne as a "new face to look for" and praised his "mind-boggling melodies".<ref>{{cite web |title= Folk You|first=John J. |last=Rock |url=http://archive.rollingstone.com/Desktop?s=196804063#/19680406/8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412123403/http://archive.rollingstone.com/Desktop?s=196804063#/19680406/8 |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 12, 2013 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 8, 2012}}</ref>

===Classic period===
[[File:JacksonBrowne 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Browne during a 1976 concert in [[Hamburg]], Germany]]
In 1971, Browne signed with his manager [[David Geffen]]'s [[Asylum Records]] and released ''[[Jackson Browne (album)|Jackson Browne]]'' (1972)<!-- Please note this album is not called "Saturate Before Using", which is a misapplication of the cover art. See album's page for more information. --> produced and engineered by Richard Orshoff, which included the piano-driven "[[Doctor My Eyes]]", which entered the Top Ten in the [[Billboard Hot 100|US singles chart]]. "[[Rock Me on the Water]]", from the same album, also gained considerable [[FM broadcasting|radio airplay]], while "[[Jamaica Say You Will (song)|Jamaica Say You Will]]" and "[[Song for Adam]]" (written about his friend Adam Saylor's death) helped establish Browne's reputation. Touring to promote the album, he shared the bill with [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Joni Mitchell]].

His next album, ''[[For Everyman]]'' (1973)—while considered of high quality—was less successful than his debut album, although it still sold a million copies.<ref name="TS">{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/x7vrb3.htm |title=Album artist 238 – Jackson Browne |website=Tsort.info |access-date=January 17, 2014}}</ref> The upbeat "[[Take It Easy]]", cowritten with Eagles' Glenn Frey, had already been a major success for that group, while his own recording of "These Days" reflected a sound representing Browne's angst.

''[[Late for the Sky]]'' (1974) consolidated Browne's fan base, and the album peaked at No. 14 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Billboard 200|album chart]], the 84th-best-selling album of 1974.<ref name="TS"/><ref>Paris, Russ. [http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/lfts.html Jackson Browne Discography ''Late for the Sky''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420232833/http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/lfts.html |date=April 20, 2012}}</ref> Browne's work began to demonstrate a reputation for memorable melody, insightful, often very personal lyrics, and a talent for his arrangements in composition.
It featured a [[Magritte]]-inspired cover.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Taylor, Fred  |author2=Wiseman, Rich |url=http://website.lineone.net/~fred.taylor/lfts.htm |title=Jackson Browne's ''Late for the Sky:'' The Design of a Classic Album Cover |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010082949/http://website.lineone.net/~fred.taylor/lfts.htm|archive-date=October 10, 2012}}</ref> Highlights included the title song, the [[Elegy|elegiac]] "For a Dancer", "Before the Deluge", and "[[Fountain of Sorrow]]". The arrangements featured the violin and guitar of [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], Jai Winding's piano, and the harmonies of Rosemary Butler and Doug Haywood. The title track was also featured in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[Taxi Driver]]''. During this period, Browne began his fractious but lifelong professional relationship with singer-songwriter [[Warren Zevon]], mentoring Zevon's first two Asylum albums through the studio as a producer (working closely with [[Waddy Wachtel]] and [[Jorge Calderón]]).
[[File:Jackson Browne-1980.jpg|thumb|upright|Browne in 1980]]
When touring in 1975, Browne was accompanied by his wife Phyllis and one-year-old son Ethan. Browne also added keyboardist [[Wayne Cook]] to the tour. They toured in a converted Greyhound Bus.{{sfn|Bego|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TSoOOD-MidAC&pg=PA88 88]}} In the autumn of 1975, Browne performed shows with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Toots and the Maytals]].<ref>{{cite web |title=A Jackson Browne Concert Chronology |website=The Road & The Sky |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712034127/http://www.ghostsontheroad.co.uk/JB/1975.html |url=http://www.ghostsontheroad.co.uk/JB/1975.html |archive-date=2011-07-12}}</ref>

Browne's character was even more apparent in his next album, ''[[The Pretender (album)|The Pretender]]''. It was released during 1976, after the suicide of his first wife, Phyllis Major, and features production by [[Jon Landau]] and a mixture of styles, ranging from the [[mariachi]]-inspired "Linda Paloma" to the [[country music|country]]-driven "Your Bright Baby Blues" and the downbeat "Sleep's Dark and Silent Gate".

A year after the untimely death of Major, "[[Here Come Those Tears Again]]"—which he co-wrote with Nancy Farnsworth, the mother of his deceased wife—peaked at No. 23 on the Hot 100.

''[[Running on Empty (album)|Running on Empty]]'' (1977), recorded entirely on tour, became his biggest commercial success. Breaking the usual conventions for a live album, Browne used only new material and combined live concert performances with recordings made on buses, in hotel rooms, and back stage.<ref>{{cite web|first=William |last=Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/running-on-empty-mw0000193103 |title=Running on Empty – Jackson Browne &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=February 17, 2016}}</ref> ''Running on Empty'' contains some of his most popular songs, such as [[Running on Empty (song)|the title track]], "Rosie", and "[[The Load-Out]]/[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]", Browne's send-off to his concert audiences and tribute to his roadies.

===Activism and music===
In spring of 1978, Browne appeared at the site of the Barnwell, South Carolina, nuclear reprocessing plant to perform a free concert the night before a civil disobedience action; he did not participate in the action. In June 1978 he performed on the grounds of the [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]] construction site in New Hampshire for 20,000 opponents of the reactor.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wasserman |first=Harvey |url=http://www.nukefree.org/news/jacksonbrowneoncolbert |title=Jackson Browne Nails Nuke Power on Colbert |website=NukeFree.org |year=2008 |access-date=February 17, 2016}}</ref>

Soon after the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], during March 1979, Browne joined with several musician friends to found the [[anti-nuclear|antinuclear]] organization [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]].<ref name="aol"/> He was arrested protesting against the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] near [[San Luis Obispo]]. His next album, ''[[Hold Out]]'' (1980), was commercially successful and his only number 1 record on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. pop albums chart]]. The album generated "[[Boulevard (song)|Boulevard]]". In 1982, he released the single "[[Somebody's Baby]]" from the ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' soundtrack, which became his biggest hit, peaking at number 7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The 1983 ''[[Lawyers in Love]]'' followed, signaling a discernible change from the personal to the political in his lyrics. In 1985, he sang a duet with [[Clarence Clemons]] in a song called "[[You're a Friend of Mine]]".

[[Political protest]] came to the fore in Browne's music in the 1986 album, ''[[Lives in the Balance]]'', an explicit condemnation of U.S. policy in Central America. Flavored with new instrumental textures, it was a huge success with many Browne fans, though not with mainstream audiences. The title track, "[[Lives in the Balance (song)|Lives in the Balance]]", with its [[Andean music|Andean]] [[pan flute|pan pipes]]—and lines like, "There's a shadow on the faces / Of the men who fan the flames / Of the wars that are fought in places / Where we can't even say the names"—was an outcry against U.S.-backed wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The song was used at several points in the award-winning 1987 [[PBS]] documentary, ''The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis,'' by journalist [[Bill Moyers]], and was part of the soundtrack of ''Stone's War'', a 1986 ''[[Miami Vice]]'' episode focusing on American involvement in Central America.

During the 1980s, Browne performed frequently at benefit concerts for causes he supported, including [[Farm Aid]], [[Amnesty International]] (making several appearances on the 1986 [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour), post-[[Somoza]] revolutionary Nicaragua, and the [[Christic Institute]]. The album ''[[World in Motion (album)|World in Motion]]'', released in 1989, contains a cover of [[Steven Van Zandt]]'s "I am a Patriot", a song which he has performed at numerous concerts.

Browne also performed alongside [[Roy Orbison]] in ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' in 1988 along with [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[k.d. lang]], and many others. The special originally aired on [[Cinemax]].

===1990s===
Browne wrote and recorded the song "The Rebel Jesus" with [[the Chieftains]], which appeared on their 1991 Christmas album ''[[The Bells of Dublin]]''. In 1993, four years after his previous album, Browne returned with ''[[I'm Alive (Jackson Browne album)|I'm Alive]]'', a critically acclaimed album with a more personal style that did not have any successful singles but still sold respectably—indeed, the ninth track from the album, "[[Sky Blue and Black]]", was used during the pilot episode of the sitcom ''[[Friends]]''. In 1994, Browne collaborated with [[Kathy Mattea]] to contribute "[[Rock Me on the Water]]" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].<ref name="jrp-graphics.com">{{cite web|first=Russell |last=Paris |url=http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/jbbio.html |title=Jackson Browne – Biography |website=Jrp-graphics.com |access-date=October 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102144332/http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/jbbio.html |archive-date=November 2, 2011 }}</ref>

During 1995, he performed in ''[[The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True]]'', a musical performance of the popular story at Lincoln Center to benefit the [[Children's Defense Fund]]. The performance was originally broadcast on Turner Network Television, and issued on CD and video in 1996. He sang a duet with [[Jann Arden]], "Unloved", on her 1995 album ''[[Living Under June]]''. Browne's own album, ''[[Looking East]]'' (1996), was released soon after, but was not as successful commercially.<ref name="jrp-graphics.com"/>

===2000–present===
Browne released his first album in six years, ''[[The Naked Ride Home]]'' in 2002, with a performance on ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', featuring the recording with older familiar songs.

During 2003, Browne guest-starred as himself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Brake My Wife, Please]]", performing a parody of his song "[[Rosie (Jackson Browne song)|Rosie]]" with lyrics altered to reference the plot involving Homer and Marge.

In 2004, Browne was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. [[Bruce Springsteen]] gave the induction speech, commenting to Browne that although the Eagles were inducted first, he said, "You wrote the songs they wished they had written".<ref>Paris, Russ. [http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/rarhof.html Text of Jackson Browne Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Speech by Bruce Springsteen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914010741/http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/rarhof.html |date=September 14, 2010 }} March 2004.</ref> Browne had written quite a few hit songs that many artists, including the Eagles, had recorded over the span of his career. The previous year, three of Browne's albums—''[[For Everyman]]'', ''[[Late for the Sky]]'', and ''[[The Pretender (album)|The Pretender]]''—had been selected by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine as among its choices for the 500 best albums of all time.

[[Image:JacksonBrowne3.jpg|thumb|Browne campaigning for presidential candidate [[John Edwards]] at a fundraising event in 2008]]
A liberal Democrat, Browne appeared in several rallies for presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in 2000, singing "I Am a Patriot" and other songs. He participated in the [[Vote for Change]] tour during October 2004, playing a series of concerts in American [[swing states]]. These concerts were organized by [[MoveOn.org]] to mobilize people to vote for [[John Kerry]] in the [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Browne appeared with [[Bonnie Raitt]] and [[Keb' Mo']], and once with [[Bruce Springsteen]]. During late 2006, Browne performed with [[Michael Stanley]] and [[J. D.
