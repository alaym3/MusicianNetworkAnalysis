==Early life==
Paul Joseph Brady was born in [[Belfast]] and raised in the small town of [[Strabane]] in [[County Tyrone]], Northern Ireland, on the border with [[County Donegal]], [[Republic of Ireland]]. His father Seán Brady was a music teacher who taught flute. Brady was educated at Sion Mills Primary School, [[St Columb's College|St. Columb's College]], Derry and [[University College Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/im-another-thing-on-stage-1253236.html|title='I'm another thing on stage'|author=Barry Egan|date=23 December 2007|access-date=20 March 2010|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|archive-date=5 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200505190322/https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/im-another-thing-on-stage-1253236.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He is prominently featured in the documentary film ''The Boys of St. Columb's''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

He began learning piano around age six and by the age of eleven he had begun to play guitar, spending hours of his [[school holiday]]s learning every song that [[the Shadows]] and [[the Ventures]] had recorded. He was also strongly influenced by [[Chuck Berry]].

In 1963, Brady began performing as a piano player in a hotel in [[Bundoran]], Donegal. In October 1964, he attended [[University College Dublin]] and performed with a string of [[Rhythm and blues|RnB]] groups, covering songs by the likes of [[Ray Charles]] and [[James Brown]]. The first of these was the Inmates (late 1964–about April 1965), which evolved into the Kult (about April–December 1965), featuring Brady, Jackie McAuley (ex-[[Them (band)#Post-Morrison|Them]], and future Belfast Gypsies and [[Trader Horne (band)|Trader Horne]]), Brendan Bonass, and Dave Pennefather. Brady can be seen in the documentary film [[Charlie Is My Darling (film)|''Charlie Is My Darling'']] waiting outside Dublin's [[Adelphi Theatre]] for [[the Rolling Stones]]' concert of 3 September 1965. He next joined Rootzgroup (late 1965–May 1966) and Rockhouse (about May–December 1966).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishrock.org/irodb/bands/kult.html|title=Irish Rock Discography: The Inmates / The Kult|website=Irishrock.org|access-date=16 October 2019|archive-date=30 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030002144/http://www.irishrock.org/irodb/bands/kult.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Musical career==
===1960s and 1970s===
During his time at college in [[Dublin]], the country saw a huge rise in interest in [[traditional Irish music]]. Brady joined the popular Irish band [[The Johnstons]] when Michael Johnston left in May 1967.<ref name="Larkin"/> They moved to London, England, in 1969 and subsequently to New York City in 1972 to expand their audience. Despite some success, Brady returned to Ireland in 1974 to join the Irish group [[Planxty]],<ref name="Larkin"/> the band that would subsequently launch the solo careers of [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]], [[Liam O'Flynn]], [[Dónal Lunny]], and [[Christy Moore]].

When [[Planxty]] disbanded in late 1975, Brady formed a duo with Irvine from 1976 to 1978, a partnership that produced the successful album, ''[[Andy Irvine/Paul Brady]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> The next few years saw him establish his popularity and reputation as one of Ireland's best interpreters of traditional songs. His versions of ballads like "[[Arthur McBride]]" and "[[The Lakes of Pontchartrain]]" were considered definitive and are still popular at concerts today. In 1975 in New York he recorded three albums for [[Shanachie Records]] as guitar accompanist to resident Irish fiddlers Andy McGann, Paddy Reynolds and John Vesey. He also recorded a 1976 album, ''The High Part of the Road'', for the same label with Irish fiddler [[Tommy Peoples]].<ref name="Mathieson">Kenny Mathieson. 2001. Celtic music. Hal Leonard Corporation. p. 14</ref>

===Solo career===
In 1978, Brady released his first solo album, ''[[Welcome Here Kind Stranger]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0320/1224266688914.html|title='I've never been fashionable'|date=20 March 2010|access-date=20 March 2010|author=Arminta Wallace|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|archive-date=20 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220220807/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0320/1224266688914.html|url-status=live}}</ref> which won him critical acclaim and was awarded the Melody Maker Folk Album of the Year. However, it would prove to be Brady's last album covering traditional material. He decided to delve into pop and rock music, and released his first album of this genre in 1981, ''[[Hard Station]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Brady released a number of successful solo albums throughout the 1980s: ''[[True for You]]'' (1983), ''[[Back to the Centre]]'' (1985), and ''[[Primitive Dance]]'' (1987). By the end of the decade, Brady was recognised and accepted as a respected performer and songwriter.<ref name="Larkin"/> His songs were being covered by a number of other artists, including [[Santana (band)|Santana]] and [[Dave Edmunds]]. 

When [[Tina Turner]] heard a demo of his song "[[Paradise Is Here]]", she recorded it for her ''[[Break Every Rule]]'' album of 1986.<ref name="Larkin"/> By now, he was a favourite songwriter among such artists as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]], who would do a duet with Brady on his 1991 album, ''[[Trick or Treat (Paul Brady album)|Trick or Treat]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> A couple of Brady songs soon appeared on Raitt's album ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'', including the title track.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Dylan was sufficiently impressed by Brady's work to name-check him in the booklet of his 1985 box set, ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]''. The actual quote was "(...) people get too famous too fast these days and it destroys them. Some guys got it down-Leonard Cohen, Paul Brady, Lou Reed, secret heroes, John Prine, David Allen Coe, Tom Waits. I listen more to that kind of stuff than whatever is popular at the moment. They're not just witchdoctoring up the planet, they don't set up barriers (...)".

Since his ''[[Hard Station]]'' album (1981), Brady was on various major labels until he created his own label, PeeBee Music, in the late 1990s. He released three albums in the 1990s: ''[[Trick or Treat (Paul Brady album)|Trick or Treat]]'', ''[[Songs & Crazy Dreams]]'' (a remixed compilation of earlier songs) and ''[[Spirits Colliding]]'', which were met with critical acclaim.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} ''Trick or Treat'' was on [[Fontana Records|Fontana]]/[[Mercury Records]] and received a lot of promotion. As a result, some critics considered it his debut album and noted that the record benefited from the expertise of experienced studio musicians, as well as producer [[Gary Katz]], who worked with the rock group [[Steely Dan]]. [[Rolling Stone]], after praising Brady's earlier but less-known solo records, called ''Trick or Treat'' Brady's "most compelling collection."{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Brady has gone on to record several other albums (15 in total since he went solo in 1978) and collaborated with a number of other established musicians including [[Bonnie Raitt]] and [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] (a complete list of his many collaborations is given at his website). In 2006, he collaborated with [[Cara Dillon]] on the track "The Streets of Derry" from her album ''[[After the Morning (Cara Dillon album)|After the Morning]]''. He has also worked with [[Fiachra Trench]].

He performed [[Irish language|Gaelic]] songs as a character in the 2002 [[Matthew Barney]] film ''[[The Cremaster Cycle#Cremaster 3|Cremaster 3]]''. He also played tin whistle on the single "One" by Greg Pearle in 2008, from the album ''[[Beautiful You (album)|Beautiful You]]'', a collaboration between Greg Pearle and [[John Illsley]]; this song featured in the 2008 film ''Anton'', directed by Graham Cantwell.

Brady's fifteenth studio album, ''Hooba Dooba'', was released in March 2010<ref name="Advertiser">{{Cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/23593|publisher=Galway Advertiser|title=Paul Brady's crazy dreams and the luck of the draw|author=Kevin Mcguire|date=18 March 2010|access-date=20 March 2010|archive-date=13 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813230229/http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/23593|url-status=live}}</ref> and was widely acclaimed as one of his finest.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

As of 2017, a friendship was struck with Theo Katzman (vulfpeck) and Brady has since been touring as half of this unlikely duo. They have been touring with Joe Dart, also of vulfpeck, upcoming Northern Irish guitarist Jack McGoldrick, Louis Cato and Lee Pardini.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Brady continues to tour, record and collaborate in a variety of creative projects around the globe.  In 2019 Jimmy Buffett began performing a cover of Brady's hit, The World is What you Make It. In September 2019 Brady joined Jimmy Buffett on his tour stops in both Dublin and London.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Awards==
In 2009 Brady received an honorary degree of [[Doctor of Letters]] from the [[Ulster University|University of Ulster]] in recognition of his services to traditional Irish music and songwriting.<ref>[http://www.ulster.ac.uk/summergraduation2009/News/5news6thJulypm.htm Honour for musician Paul Brady] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612104344/http://www.ulster.ac.uk/summergraduation2009/News/5news6thJulypm.htm |date=12 June 2011 }} University of Ulster</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ulster.ac.uk/summergraduation2009/pressreleases.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231152645/http://www.ulster.ac.uk/summergraduation2009/pressreleases.html|url-status=dead|title=University of Ulster Graduation Ceremonies Summer 2009|archive-date=31 December 2009}}</ref>
