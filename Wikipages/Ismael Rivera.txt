'''Ismael Rivera''' a.k.a. '''"Maelo"''' (October 5, 1931 – May 13, 1987),<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://thebiography.us/en/rivera-ismael|title=Biography of Ismael Rivera (1931-1987)|website=Thebiography.us|access-date=October 7, 2021}}</ref> was a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] composer and [[Salsa music|salsa]] singer.

==Early life==
[[File:Escuela Pedro G. Goyco 01.jpg|thumb|left|Rivera went to Pedro G. Goyco Elementary School in San Juan.]]
Rivera was born in [[Santurce, Puerto Rico]], a sector of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  He was the first of five children born to Luis and Margarita Rivera. His father, Luis, was a carpenter and his mother a housewife. As a child, Rivera was always singing and banging on cans with sticks. He received his primary education at the Pedro G. Goyco Elementary School and then went on to learn carpentry at a vocational school. He also shined shoes to help his family financially and when he was 16 years old, he worked as a carpenter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ismael Rivera |url=http://www.fania.com/content/ismael-rivera |publisher=Fania |access-date=April 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122105242/http://www.fania.com/content/ismael-rivera |archive-date=January 22, 2012 }}</ref> During his free time he would hang around the corner with his best friend [[Rafael Cortijo]] and sing songs. In 1948, Rivera and Cortijo joined El Conjunto Monterrey, where Rivera played the [[conga]] and Cortijo the [[Bongo drum|bongos]]. Rivera was unable to work full-time as a musician because of his work as a carpenter.

==Musical career==
In 1952, Rivera joined the U.S. Army but was quickly discharged, because he did not speak English. When he returned to [[Puerto Rico]], he went to work as a lead singer with Orquesta Panamericana, thanks to the recommendation of his friend Cortijo. With Orquesta Panamericana, Rivera recorded and scored his first hits with the songs "El charlatán", "Ya yo sé", "La vieja en camisa" and "La sazón de Abuela". However, an incident between Rivera and another band member, over a girl, led to his departure from the popular band. In 1954, he joined Cortijo's Combo and recorded the following songs, which soon became hits in the American Latin community:<ref name="PRM">{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/ismael_rivera/|title=Artists - Rivera, Ismael - Music of Puerto Rico|website=Musicofpuertorico.com|access-date=October 7, 2021}}</ref>{{ external media

==El Sonero Mayor==
Cortijo's Combo continued to gain fame and so did Rivera's reputation as a lead singer. Rivera was named ''sonero mayor'' by Cuban producer Ángel Maceda, owner of club Bronx Casino in New York; this is based in an interview done with Ismael.

The band went to New York City and played in the famed Palladium Ballroom, where the orchestras of [[Tito Rodríguez]], [[Tito Puente]] and [[Charlie Palmieri]] also played.<ref name="Fundacion">[http://www.ismaelrivera.org/] {{dead link|date=October 2021}}</ref>

Rivera married Virginia Fuente in 1951. He also had relationships with other women like Gladis Serrano, who was the wife of [[Daniel Santos (singer)|Daniel Santos]]. Rivera had five children: Ismael, Jr., Carlos, Margarita, Caridad, and Orquídea. In 1959, Rivera, together with Cortijo and his Combo, participated in the European produced movie titled ''Calipso'', starring [[Harry Belafonte]]. He traveled with Cortijo's Combo, which also included [[Rafael Ithier]] and [[Roberto Roena]], to Europe, Central and South America.

Rivera was arrested for drug possession after a trip to [[Panama]] with the Cortijo combo. According to later reports, various band members regularly concealed illegal drug shipments, but this time the Customs inspectors were waiting for them. Rivera took the fall, sparing other members. But this event led to the break-up of Cortijo's Combo. Shortly after, Rafael Ithier regrouped some of the former members and formed [[El Gran Combo]] de Puerto Rico.<ref name="PRM"/>

Upon his release from jail, Rivera formed his own band called ''Ismael Rivera and his Cachimbos''. This successful band lasted for eight years. Rivera reunited with Cortijo and recorded "Juntos otra vez". Later, Rivera went solo and did well with the recordings of "El Sonero Mayor" and "Volare". He scored his greatest hit with "Las caras lindas (de mi gente negra)" written by [[Tite Curet Alonso]]. On May 14, 1974, Rivera participated in a concert at the [[Carnegie Hall]] which was recorded live. Rivera sang a song from [[Bobby Capó]] called "Dormir contigo". One of his last public performances was in Paris, as an opener for [[Bob Marley]] in 1978.

==Later years==
Rivera was a faithful pilgrim of the Black Christ procession in [[Portobelo]], [[Panama]], from 1975 to 1985, and even wrote a song about the Black Christ, known affectionately as "El Nazareno".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salsadecuba.hu/ismaelriveraelnazareno.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230124321/http://www.salsadecuba.hu/ismaelriveraelnazareno.htm|url-status=dead|title=Ismael Rivera Nazareno|archive-date=December 30, 2007|access-date=October 7, 2021}}</ref> Rivera was nicknamed "El Brujo de Borinquen" in Panama.

The death of his childhood friend, Rafael Cortijo in 1982, affected him emotionally to the point that he could not sing in the tribute to Cortijo celebrated at the [[Roberto Clemente]] Coliseum. Rivera was actively involved in the creation of a historical museum, which depicts the contributions made to the cultural life of Puerto Rico by black Puerto Ricans.

Ismael Rivera died on May 13, 1987, in the arms of his mother Margarita, from a heart attack.<ref name="auto"/> Rivera is buried in the San José Cemetery in Villa Palmeras in Santurce.<ref>{{cite web | title=Peregrinación salsera en el cementerio de Villa Palmeras (galería) | website=NotiCel | date=October 3, 2015| url=https://www.noticel.com/vida/20151031/peregrinacion-salsera-en-el-cementerio-de-villa-palmeras-galeria/ | language=es | access-date=August 9, 2020}}</ref>

==Legacy==
On October 5, 2008, Puerto Rico's governor [[Aníbal Acevedo Vilá]] signed a proclamation stating that every anniversary of Rivera's birth will be celebrated as "Día Conmemorativo del Natalicio de Ismael Rivera".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/musica/espectaculosasi/recuerdan_natalicio_del_sonero_mayor_ismael_rivera/236086 |title=Recuerdan natalicio del sonero mayor Ismael Rivera |newspaper=Primera Hora |language=es |date=October 5, 2008 |access-date=October 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208004255/http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/musica/espectaculosasi/recuerdan_natalicio_del_sonero_mayor_ismael_rivera/236086 |archive-date=December 8, 2008 }}</ref>

On September 27, 2001, the Puerto Rican Senate approved the law No. 134 declaring October 5 as "Ismael Rivera Day". In Villa Palmeras, [[Santurce, Puerto Rico]], there is a plaza named "Plaza de los Salseros" which has a statue and plaque dedicated to Ismael.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salsajazz.com/salsa/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=715|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230214642/http://www.salsajazz.com/salsa/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=715|url-status=dead|title=PROCLAMAN EN PUERTO RICO EL DÍA DE ISMAEL RIVERA|archive-date=December 30, 2007|access-date=October 7, 2021}}</ref> [[Celia Cruz]] recorded a tribute to Ismael Rivera and so did Dario y su ComboRican.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FXV/is_3_17/ai_n19053525 |title=Tribute |access-date=October 25, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219162552/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FXV/is_3_17/ai_n19053525 |archive-date=December 19, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rivera was posthumously inducted into the [[International Latin Music Hall of Fame]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=International Latin Music Hall of Fame Announces Year 2000 Inductees|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-latin-music-hall-of-fame-announces-year-2000-inductees-72842402.html|access-date=October 31, 2015|date=March 1, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306081458/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-latin-music-hall-of-fame-announces-year-2000-inductees-72842402.html|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
