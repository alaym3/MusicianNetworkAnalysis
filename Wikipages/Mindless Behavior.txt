===Member adjustments===
The group experienced a lot of adjustments since their formation in 2008 that included original members Prodigy, Princeton, Ray Ray and Roc Royal.

In November 2013, it was announced that lead singer Prodigy left the group to pursue a solo career, which he proved to be untrue. He left the group because of bullying and mistreatment received from the camp.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcLI_rADtlk</ref> This left Princeton, Ray Ray and Roc Royal as a trio.

In April 2014, the group announced that EJ would replace Prodigy as the group's new lead singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2014/04/04/mindless-behavior-announces-new-member/|title=Mindless Behavior Announces New Member - Rap-Up - Rap-Up|website=www.rap-up.com|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref>

In December 2014, Roc Royal was fired from the group due to his ill-mannered behavior. This included beating up a drug addict over money, having a baby at an early age and accusations of him stealing a producer's car.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spitfirehiphop.com/santo-august-amazing/music.70726.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231083041/http://www.spitfirehiphop.com/santo-august-amazing/music.70726.php |archive-date=December 31, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This in turn prompted Prodigy to return to the group to replace Roc Royal, who served a two-year sentence in prison for battery and robbery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thacelebritea.com/former-mindless-behavior-member-roc-royal-sentenced-to-2-years-in-prison/|title=thacelebritea.com|website=Go Daddy|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theshaderoom.com/tsrexclusive-former-mindless-behavior-member-roc-royal-sentenced-to-two-years-in-jail/|title=TSRExclusive: Former Mindless Behavior Member Roc Royal Sentenced To Two Years In Jail - The Shade Room|website=theshaderoom.com|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.allaccess.com/an-interview-with-mindless-behavior-about-their-soon-to-be-released-album/|title=An Interview With MINDLESS BEHAVIOR About Their Soon-To-Be Released Album! - All Access Music|website=music.allaccess.com|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref>

In June 2015, Prodigy left the group again, and it turned out that Prodigy was only a placeholder in the group to keep it a quartet. He left when Mike (who was the actual replacement of Roc Royal) joined the group.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In September 2015, Ray Ray decided to leave the group to pursue a solo career. This left EJ, Mike and Princeton (who was the only original member of the group left) as a trio until the disbandment of the group in February 2017.
