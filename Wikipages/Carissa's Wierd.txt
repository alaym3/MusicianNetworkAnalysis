==History==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cnich2007.jpg|frame|right|Carissa, for whom the band is named]] -->

Carissa's Wierd was formed in Tucson, Arizona in 1995 by Brooke and Champion when they were teenagers, practicing on rudimentary cheap guitars and amplifiers. Originally sharing bills with hardcore bands in the Tucson scene, Carissa's Wierd made a name for themselves and the pair toured behind [[Modest Mouse]], using fake IDs to gain their ways into clubs and riding in U-Hauls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hardlyart.com/artists/carissas_wierd|title=Carissa's Wierd}}</ref> As the band grew, Brooke and Champion found themselves filling out the band with [[Sera Cahoone]] and [[Ben Bridwell]], plus a rotating cast of other musicians. Relocating to the Pacific Northwest, the band's debut album, ''Ugly But Honest'', was released in 1999 on Bridwell's own label, Brown Records. The band was later signed to Sad Robot Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/carissas-wierd-mn0000172604/biography|title=Carissa's Wierd Biography, Songs, & Albums|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

The band played their final shows at the [[Crocodile Cafe]] in Seattle in November 2003.<ref>[http://www.threeimaginarygirls.com/imaginaryboycarissawierd.asp "My Love Affair with Carissa's Wierd"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718010659/http://www.threeimaginarygirls.com/imaginaryboycarissawierd.asp |date=July 18, 2010 }} ''Three Imaginary Girls'' - November 16, 2003</ref>

Following the band's breakup, Jenn Champion and [[Sera Cahoone]] started solo projects, Champion's under the name "[[Jenn Champion#S|S.]]" Mat Brooke and [[Ben Bridwell]] formed [[Band of Horses]], which Brooke later left to form the band [[Grand Archives]].

On July 13, 2010, [[Hardly Art]] released a "best of" compilation titled ''They'll Only Miss You When You Leave: Songs 1996-2003''.<ref>Rebecca Raber, [http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14422-theyll-only-miss-you-when-you-leave-songs-1996-2003/ "Review: Carissa's Wierd - They'll Only Miss You When You Leave: Songs 1996 - 2003"] ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' - July 14, 2010</ref> The release was preceded by a one-off reunion show on July 9, 2010 at Seattle's Showbox at the Market, which featured Brooke, Champion, Cahoone, Robin Peringer, Sarah Standard and Jeff Hellis.<ref>Jonathan Zwickel, [https://www.spin.com/2010/07/carissas-wierd-play-one-reunion-show/ "Carissa's Wierd Play One-Off Reunion Show"] ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' - July 12, 2010.</ref>

In July 2010, Brooke revealed that he and Champion had recently bought back all rights to Carissa's Wierd's back catalogue, which was previously owned by Sad Robot Records. He said, "Me and Jenn have been working for a while to buy back the rights to all of our records and we finally were able to get them all back." This should allow all of Carissa's Wierd's albums to be re-released soon.<ref>Zach Stoloff, [http://www.goodtimessantacruz.com/santa-cruz-area-music/music-features-reviews-interviews/1455-sleepless-in-seattle.html "Sleepless in Seattle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717100142/http://www.goodtimessantacruz.com/santa-cruz-area-music/music-features-reviews-interviews/1455-sleepless-in-seattle.html |date=2010-07-17 }} ''[[Good Times (newspaper)|Good Times]]'' - July 13, 2010</ref>
