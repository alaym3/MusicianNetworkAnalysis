==Musical career==

===Early career===

De la Rocha met [[Tim Commerford]] in elementary school, and in junior high school, they both played guitar in a band called Juvenile Expression. De la Rocha's interest in [[punk rock]] bands like [[The Clash]], [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], [[Sex Pistols]], and [[Bad Religion]] turned into an appreciation for other bands like [[Minor Threat]], [[Bad Brains]], and [[The Teen Idles]]. In 1987, he joined the [[straight edge]] band Hard Stance. In 2018, Indecision Records officially released Hard Stance's entire discography.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indecision To Release HARD STANCE Discography LP |url=http://restassuredzine.com/news/6222-indecision-to-release-hard-stance-discography-lp |access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref>

===Inside Out===
{{main|Inside Out (band)}}
By 1988, Ernst had departed from Hard Stance, leading to Rocha taking on the role of lead vocals. Now lacking a guitarist, the remaining members contacted [[Vic DiCara]], whom some knew from a previous band they were in that never made it past rehearsals. This act, now named Inside Out, began writing music heavily inspired by acts like Minor Threat and the Bad Brains,<ref name="Know Your Enemy">{{cite book |last1=McIver |first1=Joel |title=Know Your Enemy: The Story of Rage Against the Machine}}</ref> and soon were associated with the [[youth crew]] movement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schreurs |first1=Jason |title=THE WARRIORS – SEE HOW YOU ARE |url=https://www.altpress.com/reviews/the_warriors_-_see_how_you_are/ |website=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] |access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref> Their sole release was the 1990 EP [[No Spiritual Surrender]], issued through [[Revelation Records]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dude |first1=Mike |title=Inside Out No Spiritual Surrender (1990) |url=https://www.punknews.org/review/7550/inside-out-no-spiritual-surrender |access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref>

Towards the end of the band's lifetime, DiCara and Rocha's writing styles began to fracture. Rocha wished to push the groups into a more political and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-inspired direction, particularly influenced by [[Run-DMC]], whereas DiCara wished for the band to write more music inspired by [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]]. While Rocha's influence was prevalent on performed yet unreleased Inside Out tracks like ''Darkness of Greed'' and ''Rage Against the Machine'', the band broke up because of this conflict in 1991.<ref name="Know Your Enemy" /> De la Rocha later said that the band was "about completely detaching ourselves from society to see ourselves as ... as spirits, and not bowing down to a system that sees you as just another pebble on a beach. I channeled all my anger out through that band."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static-void.com/vault/InsideOut.htm |title=Inside Out |publisher=Static-Void |access-date=March 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revelationrecords.com/bands/show/119 |title=Inside Out |publisher=Revelation Records |access-date=March 23, 2011}}</ref>

The band had a brief reunion in 1993, performing in a number of locations including multiple in [[Salt Lake City]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ramirez |first1=Carlos |title=Sunny Singh (Founder, Hate5Six.com) |url=https://www.noecho.net/interviews/sunny-singh-director-and-founder-hate5sixcom |access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref>

===Rage Against the Machine===
{{main|Rage Against the Machine}}
[[File:Zack De La Rocha CIW Rally.jpg|thumb|De la Rocha performing live]]

Following the dissolution of Inside Out in 1991, de la Rocha embraced [[hip hop]] and began [[freestyling]] at local clubs, at one of which he was approached by former [[Lock Up (American band)|Lock Up]] guitarist [[Tom Morello]], who was impressed by de la Rocha's lyrics, and convinced him to form a band. Morello recruited former [[Greta (band)|Greta]] drummer [[Brad Wilk]]–who had previously auditioned for Lock Up before that band's dissolution earlier that same year–and de la Rocha recruited his former Juvenile Expression bandmate, Tim Commerford, to play bass. The band was named after an unreleased Inside Out record, ''Rage Against the Machine''.

Rage Against the Machine released their [[Rage Against the Machine (album)|debut album]] in 1992 to critical and commercial success. The band was on the main stage at [[Lollapalooza]] by 1993 and was one of the most politically charged bands ever to receive extensive airplay from radio and [[MTV]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. Rage's [[Evil Empire (album)|second]] and [[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|third]] albums peaked at number one in the United States, but did not result in the political action de la Rocha had hoped for. He became increasingly restless and undertook collaborations with artists such as [[KRS-One]], [[Chuck D]], and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]. He left Rage Against the Machine in October 2000, citing "creative differences," at which time he issued a statement saying: "it was necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed",<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ratm.net/articles_rollingstonejan01.html |title=Rage Against the Machine: Articles<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=February 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510190320/http://www.ratm.net/articles_rollingstonejan01.html |archive-date=May 10, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in reference to the disagreement over the release of ''Renegades''. The other members of the band sought out separate management and secured the immediate release of ''Renegades''. After searching for a replacement for de la Rocha, the other members of Rage joined [[Chris Cornell]] of [[Soundgarden]] to form [[Audioslave]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=Rage Against the Machine&nbsp;– Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p23206/biography|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|year=2004|access-date=September 8, 2008}}</ref>

===Solo career===
[[File:Go At it Now!.jpg|thumb|left|Zack de la Rocha on stage with [[Rage Against the Machine]] in 2007]]

Following the disbandment of Rage Against the Machine, de la Rocha worked on a solo album he had been recording since before the band's dissolution, working with [[DJ Shadow]], [[El-P]], [[Muggs]], [[Dan The Automator]], [[Roni Size]], [[DJ Premier]] and [[Questlove]] with production partner [[James Poyser]].<ref name="zackquit">{{cite web |last=Armstrong |first=Mark |date=October 18, 2000 |title=Zack de la Rocha Leaves Rage Against the Machine |work=[[MTV News]] |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=460baa38-4bb2-4eab-9395-22a301d24afb&entry=index |access-date=February 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210182204/http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=460baa38-4bb2-4eab-9395-22a301d24afb&entry=index |archive-date=February 10, 2008  }}</ref> The album never came to fruition, and de la Rocha started a new collaboration with [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]], in which around 20 tracks were produced.<ref name="reznor">{{cite web | last = Moss | first = Corey | title = Reznor Says Collabos With De La Rocha, Keenan May Never Surface | work = [[MTV News]] | date = May 10, 2005 | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1501617/20050510/reznor_trent.jhtml | access-date = February 17, 2007}}</ref> Reznor thought the work was "excellent",<ref name="reznor"/> but said the songs will likely never be released as de la Rocha was not "ready to make a record" at that time.<ref>{{cite web | last = Gargano | first = Paul | title = Nine Inch Nails (interview) | work = Maximum Ink Music Magazine |date=October 2005 | url = http://www.maximumink.com/articles.php?articleId=845 | access-date = February 17, 2007}}</ref>
On working with DJ Shadow and Reznor, de la Rocha admitted in a 2008 interview that:

{{quote|When I left Rage ... first off, I was very heartbroken, and secondly, I became obsessed with completely reinventing my wheel. In an unhealthy way, to a degree. I kind of forgot that old way of allowing yourself to just be a conduit. When I was working with Trent and Shadow, I felt that I was going through the motions. Not that what was produced wasn't great, but I feel now that I've maybe reinvented the base sounds that emanate from the songs.<ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/soundboard/2008/08/these-days-the.html |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Zack de la Rocha talks to Ann Powers |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722171831/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/soundboard/2008/08/these-days-the.html |archive-date=July 22, 2010 }}</ref>}}

In 2000, de la Rocha appeared on the song "Centre of the Storm", from the [[Roni Size]]/[[Reprazent]] album ''In The Mode'',<ref>{{cite web | last = Phillips | first = Liam | title = ''In The Mode'' review | work = The Manitoban | date = October 17, 2001 | url = http://themanitoban.com/2001-2002/1017/music.shtml | access-date = February 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030321/http://themanitoban.com/2001-2002/1017/music.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = September 27, 2007}}</ref> while in 2002, he appeared in a minor role in the first part of the [[Blackalicious]] song "Release" on the album ''[[Blazing Arrow]]''.<ref>{{cite web | last = Moss | first = Corey | title = Zack De La Rocha Joining Blackalicious on Blazing Arrow | work = [[MTV News]] | date = March 1, 2002 | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452688/20020301/blackalicious.jhtml | access-date = February 17, 2007}}</ref> A new collaboration between de la Rocha and [[DJ Shadow]], the song "March of Death" was released for free online in 2003 in protest against the imminent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].  As part of the collaboration de la Rocha released a statement which included the following:

{{quote|Lies, sanctions, and cruise missiles have never created a free and just society. Only everyday people can do that, which is why I'm joining the millions world wide who have stood up to oppose the Bush administration's attempt to expand the U.S. empire at the expense of human rights at home and abroad. In this spirit I'm releasing this song for anyone who is willing to listen. I hope it not only makes us think, but also inspires us to act and raise our voices.<ref>[http://www.zackdelarocha.com/ Zack de la Rocha.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225135819/http://www.zackdelarocha.com/ |date=February 25, 2007 }}, official website promoting "March of Death".

The 2004 soundtrack ''[[Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' included one of the collaborations with Reznor, "[[We Want It All]]".<ref name="reznor"/> This album also contained "No One Left", the debut recording by former Rage Against the Machine guitarist [[Tom Morello]] as [[The Nightwatchman]]. On October 7, 2005, de la Rocha returned to the stage with new material, performing with [[Son Jarocho]] band Son de Madera. He later spoke as MC and again performed with Son de Madera at the November 22 Concert at the Farm, a benefit concert for the [[South Central Farm]]ers. He sang and played the [[Jarana jarocha|jarana]] with the band, and performed his own new original material, including the song "Sea of Dead Hands".<ref>Spin Magazine, February 2006</ref>
On September 8, 2016, it was reported that de la Rocha's first solo album was complete and would be released in early 2017. The news came with a new song, produced by [[El-P]], called "Digging for Windows" that was released on YouTube and BitTorrent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2016/09/08/493137235/listen-rage-against-the-machines-zack-de-la-rocha-finally-goes-solo|title=Listen: Rage Against The Machine's Zack De La Rocha Finally Goes Solo|website=NPR.org|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref> However, to date, the album remains unreleased with no further announcements made.

===Rage Against the Machine reunion===
[[File:RATM at Coachella.jpg|thumb|right|De la Rocha performing with Rage Against the Machine at Coachella 2007]]
Rumors that Rage Against the Machine could reunite at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] were circulating in mid-January 2007 and were confirmed on January 22.<ref>{{cite news |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |title=Rage Against the Machine will reunite for Coachella |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 22, 2007 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-coachella22jan22,1,6747076.story?coll=la-headlines-entnews&ctrack=1&cset=true |access-date=January 22, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124114207/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-coachella22jan22,1,6747076.story?coll=la-headlines-entnews&ctrack=1&cset=true <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=January 24, 2007}}</ref> The band was confirmed to be headlining the final day of Coachella 2007. Rage Against the Machine, as a full band, headlined the final day of the 2007 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] on April 29. The band played in front of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival. The performance was initially thought to be a one-off, but this turned out not to be the case. The band played 7 more shows in the United States in 2007, and in January 2008, they played their first shows outside the US as part of the [[Big Day Out]] Festival in Australia and New Zealand. The band continued to tour around the world, headlining many large festivals in Europe and the United States, including [[Lollapalooza]] in Chicago and the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]. In a 2008 interview, de la Rocha said this of the relationship between him, Commerford, Wilk and Morello:

{{quote|So much has changed. When you get older, you look back on tensions and grievances and have another perspective on it. I think our relationship now is better than it's ever been. I would even describe it as great. We're going to keep playing shows&nbsp;– we have a couple of big ones happening in front of both conventions. As far as us recording music in the future, I don't know where we all fit with that. We've all embraced each other's projects and support them, and that's great.<ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com"/>}}

Later in 2011, de la Rocha and the rest of Rage Against the Machine reunited for one final show, headlining, LA Rising July 30, 2011. The show filled the [[LA Coliseum]].

A second reunion tour was announced for the spring of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vividseats.com/blog/rage-against-the-machine-tour-dates |title=Rage Against The Machine Announce 2020 Reunion Tour: Dates, Tickets |date=November 1, 2019 |website=[[Vivid Seats]]}}</ref> The band was scheduled to perform 52 shows (39 in the United States, 5 in Canada, and 8 in Europe) from March 26 to September 12<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tour.ratm.com/ |title="Public Service Announcement" tour Rage Against The Machine w/ Run The Jewels |date=February 26, 2020 |website=[[RATM]]}}</ref> but were forced to postpone the tour until 2022 amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rage-against-the-machine-reschedule-reunion-tour-2021-993233/ |title=Rage Against the Machine Reschedule Reunion Tour for 2021 |date=May 2, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>

===One Day as a Lion===
{{main|One Day as a Lion}}
In 2008, de la Rocha and former [[The Mars Volta|Mars Volta]] drummer [[Jon Theodore]] formed [[One Day as a Lion]]. They later added [[Joey Karam]] of [[The Locust]] on keyboards for their live shows. The group combines rock drumming, electro keyboards, and hip-hop vocals. De la Rocha played keyboards as well as providing vocals, with Theodore on the drums for their self-titled EP. The band's name derives from a black and white graffiti photograph taken by Chicano photographer George Rodriguez in 1970 with a caption reading: "It's better to live one day as a lion, than a thousand years as a lamb".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onedayasalion.org/ |title=About |access-date=July 7, 2008 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |work=One Day as a Lion |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828031417/http://www.onedayasalion.org/ |archive-date=August 28, 2008}}</ref> This comes from a [[wikt:minatory|minatory]] slogan popular during the 1930s in [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], "Better one day as a lion than a hundred days as a sheep."<ref>{{cite book |title=Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World |last=Cassels |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Cassels |year=1996 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-11926-X |page=159 |quote=Now the time had come, in Mussolini's words, for 'reaching out to the people', the only ideological ''raison d'être'' he had to fall back on was militant nationalism.

===Other projects===
For a brief period in 1988, Rocha played drums for hardcore punk band [[No For An Answer]], even playing on their debut EP ''You Laugh''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Book |first1=Ryan |title=7 Highest Priced Records on eBay Right Now: The Beatles, Robert Johnson and The Stooges Included |url=https://www.musictimes.com/articles/34336/20150403/7-highest-priced-records-ebay-right-now-beatles-robert-johnson-stooges-included.htm |access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref>

In 1989, Rocha formed [[Farside (band)|Farside]], playing guitar in the group until 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=Farside |url=https://trouserpress.com/reviews/farside/ |access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref>

In 1991, Rocha formed a band with [[John Porcelly]] based at the [[Revelation Records]] headquarters in [[Huntington Beach, California]], in which Rocha was the vocalist and Porcelly played guitar. Although the group never officially had a name, at one point in time, Rocha proposed the name "Rage Against the Machine", however Porcelly believed the name to be too long, leading to Rocha using it as the name for his other band at the time. The band's music merged elements of hardcore punk and hip hop.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Porcell  |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YVYYRMFXGY|series= NYHC Chronicles |access-date= 31 May 2020 |date=22 May 2020 |number=21 |time=1h30m}}</ref>

==Activism==
De la Rocha advocates in favor of [[Leonard Peltier]], [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] (EZLN) movement in Mexico. He spoke on the floor of the UN, testifying against the United States and its treatment of Abu-Jamal. De la Rocha has been particularly outspoken on the cause of the EZLN. De la Rocha and Rage Against The Machine hosted a benefit show in January 1999 alongside the [[Beastie Boys]] to raise attention towards Abu-Jamal's case. The concert was marred in controversy as New Jersey Governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]] denounced the show and encouraged people not to attend; the show ultimately sold out.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mumia Abu-Jamal: The story of the Jan 28th 1999 concert|url=http://www.urban75.org/archive/news044.html|access-date=2021-07-30|website=www.urban75.org}}</ref>
 
Zack's Chicano identity informed his band's commitment to what they view as the struggles of immigrants, people of color, and the Zapatistas. He renamed the People's Resource Center in Highland Park to the "Centro de Regeneracion".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-11-14|title=Regeneración: Public Resource Center|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/departures/regeneracion-public-resource-center|access-date=2021-02-02|website=KCET|language=en}}</ref> There, many of the same artists and activists who had participated in the struggle over the Peace and Justice Center maintained their commitment to providing youth a space for cultural expression and training. Along with music workshops and the development of Radio Clandestina, Centro members also organized graffiti workshops and youth film festivals. The Centro lasted only two years; within that timespan it was viewed by its members and staff as an important space in the ongoing institutionalization of the community politics, cultural practices, and social networks of the Eastside scene in the nineties.
 
The EZLN and de la Rocha's experiences with them inspired the songs "People of the Sun", "Wind Below" and "[[Without a Face]]" from ''[[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]]'',<ref name="chiapas">"[http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/chiapas.htm Interview with Zack from Chiapas]" (July 19, 1998), ''Accion Zapatista de Austin''.

On his post-Rage political music, de la Rocha admitted that it was near impossible for him to draw the line between politics and music.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}
 
On April 14, 2007, Morello and de la Rocha reunited on-stage early to perform a brief acoustic set at [[House of Blues]] in Chicago at the rally for fair food with the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]] (CIW). Morello described the event as "very exciting for everybody in the room, myself included". At Rage's first reunion show, de la Rocha made a speech during "[[Wake Up (Rage Against the Machine song)|Wake Up]]" in which de la Rocha called numerous American presidents [[War crime|war criminals]], citing a statement by [[Noam Chomsky]] regarding the [[Nuremberg Principles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chomsky.info/1996summer/|title=On Democracy, Noam Chomsky interviewed by Tom Morello|website=chomsky.info|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref>

Like bandmate Tom Morello, Zack de la Rocha is [[vegetarian]]. In an interview, he stated "I think vegetarianism is really great, and I stand really strongly behind it. I think that an animal goes through a lot of pain in the whole cycle of death in the slaughterhouse; just living to be killed. I just don’t think it’s worth eating that animal. There’s so much other food out there that doesn’t have to involve you in that cycle of pain and death."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dolm |first1=JJ |title=Did You Know These Heavy Metal Rockers Were Powered by Plants? |url=https://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/meet-the-veg-heavy-metal-masters-who-power-their-chords-with-plants/ |website=One Green Planet |access-date=3 October 2020}}</ref>
