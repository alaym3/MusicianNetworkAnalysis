== Early life ==

Their father, who died from a gunshot wound before their birth, was [[African American]] and their mother is [[Cherokee|Native American Cherokee]].<ref name="lamont1">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/21/angel-haze-interview-my-mum-knew-i-would-tell-everything|title=Angel Haze: 'My mum knew I was going to tell everything'|last=Lamont|first=Tom|date=February 22, 2014|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> When Wilson was a young child their mother met a preacher in the [[Apostolic Faith Church|Greater Apostolic Faith]] and the two moved into his home with his wife and children, into what Wilson describes as a cult.<ref name="lamont1"/> Growing up in the church, Wilson witnessed [[domestic violence]] and manipulation at a very young age.<ref name="youtube1">{{Citation|last=Sway's Universe|title=Angel Haze Elaborates on Their Experience in Cult Life and Performs "New York"|date=December 20, 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLxjBTzVqCg|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref><ref name="complex1">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/09/who-is-angel-haze/her-relationship-with-religion|title=Who is Angel Haze?

You weren't allowed to talk to anyone outside of that, you weren't allowed to wear jewelry, listen to music, to eat certain things, to date people … you weren't allowed to do pretty much anything."<ref name="macphersonguardian2013">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/31/rapper-angel-haze-religion-rape-survival|title=Rapper Angel Haze on religion, rape, and survival|last=Macpherson|first=Alex|date=January 31, 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=June 13, 2013|location=London}}</ref>

Wilson's family moved around frequently, mainly due to their mother running away from the church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/09/who-is-angel-haze/growing-up|title=Who is Angel Haze?Growing Up in Multiple Cities|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> At one point the family was living in a shelter and Wilson was teased at school for it.<ref name="complex2">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/09/who-is-angel-haze/her-obsession-with-neurology-other-interests|title=Who is Angel Haze?

== Artistry ==

=== Influences ===
After Wilson moved to New York and began listening to [[secular]] music, they became inspired by artists such as [[Eminem]], [[Kanye West]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[Lil Wayne]].<ref name="youtube1" /> "The artists that I identify [with] mostly are the ones who are so uncompromisingly themselves," Wilson said in a 2014 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview. "Like, 'Fuck you. I don't care what you think about it. This is who I am. And I can either force-feed you this shit, or you can take it as you will.'"<ref name="rollingstone1" />

=== Public image ===
Wilson raps about themes such as [[homophobia]], [[rape culture]] and [[racism]]. They use their personal experiences to condemn a culture that breeds the self-harm of queer youth.<ref name="buzzfeed1"/> Wilson has also been open about their experience with [[mental illnesses]] such as [[addiction]], [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/09/17/angel-haze-back-to-the-woods-interview|title=How Angel Haze Turned Tragedy Into Triumph On Back To The Woods|work=The FADER|access-date=April 19, 2018|language=en}}</ref> in their music and in interviews and social media.

Wilson sees their goal as an artist to reach out to people who are similar to them or going through difficult experiences.<ref name="buzzfeed1"/> They said, "It's not about the Bible. It's not about going to church. It's not about anything other than that we are all energies connected with a force that's greater than us. It's an energy that's omniscient, it covers the whole world, and everybody here is created for a reason. Mine happens to be to make the music and inspire the people who are stuck in dark places."<ref name="billboard1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7777007/angel-haze-resurrection-video-premiere-interview|title=Angel Haze's 'Resurrection' Video Premiere: The 'Spiritual' Rapper Talks Upcoming Album and Sampling John Mayer|work=Billboard|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref>

In a 2014 ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'' column, Wilson discussed [[cultural appropriation]] and white artists making hip hop, saying "There seems to be this hypocrisy because people want to appropriate black culture but only when it's cool or beneficial to them … And that's the reason that people don't have a right, to some extent, to use black music to their own gains."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/rzeekj/angel-haze-on-hip-hop-and-cultural-appropriation-2015|title=Angel Haze: "It Feels Like a Punch To The Gut When Someone Takes Our Culture and Runs With It"|date=January 20, 2015|work=Noisey|access-date=April 19, 2018|language=en-uk}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Wilson stated that, "Love is boundary-less. If you can make me feel, if you can make me laugh—and that's hard to do—then I can be with you."<ref name="hermionehobytheguardian2012" /> In 2014, Haze was in a relationship with model [[Ireland Baldwin]].<ref>Cavan Sieczkowski, "Angel Haze On Relationship With Ireland Baldwin: ‘We F**k And Friends Don’t F**k’," [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/angel-haze-ireland-baldwin_n_5537001.html HuffPost], June 27, 2014.</ref> The two broke up a year later.<ref>Gabrielle Korn, "did angel haze and ireland baldwin just break up?"

Wilson recorded a cover of [[Macklemore & Ryan Lewis|Macklemore's]] "[[Same Love]],"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/angel-haze-on-dirty-gold-and-her-hippie-aspirations-20131118|title=Angel Haze Wants to Be a Hippie|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> which chronicled their own personal experiences. They opened up about their struggles with family over sexuality and growing up LGBTQ. In a 2017 ''Billboard'' interview they stated, "When I was young … I didn't understand what was going on. I didn't understand that I could be attracted to men and women at the same time."<ref name="billboard1"/>

In 2015, Wilson began working on a body image project titled "The Naked Eye" incorporating nude photographs and interviews of people with [[body dysmorphia]].<ref name="buzzfeed1"/> The project aims to create a conversation about conventional and mainstream beauty standards.

Wilson is self-taught in the [[Cherokee language]] and celebrates their multiracial heritage.<ref name="buzzfeed1"/>
