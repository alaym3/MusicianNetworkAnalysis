[[File:Nicole Kidman 2003.jpg|thumb|upright|Kidman attending the premiere of ''[[Dogville]]'' at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]]]]

In 2002, Kidman garnered critical acclaim for her portrayal of [[Virginia Woolf]] in [[Stephen Daldry]]'s ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'', co-starring alongside [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Julianne Moore]]. Kidman famously wore prosthetics, which were applied to her nose, in order to portray the author during 1920s England, making her look almost unrecognisable. The film was a critical success, earning several awards and nominations, including a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. ''The New York Times'' wrote that "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE6DE113CF934A15751C1A9649C8B63|title= Film Review; Who's Afraid Like Virginia Woolf?|newspaper=The New York Times|url-access=limited|first=Stephen|last=Holden|date=27 December 2002}}</ref> Kidman won numerous critic and industry awards for her performance, including her first BAFTA Award, third [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Golden Globe Award]], and the Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Australian actress to win the award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/nicole-kidman-5-things-you-803890/|title=Nicole Kidman: 5 Things You Didn't Know About the Actress|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Natalie|last=Stone|date=20 June 2015|access-date=27 May 2021}}</ref> During her Oscar's acceptance speech, she referenced the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] which was occurring at the time when speaking about the importance of art saying, "Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil?

Following her Oscar win, Kidman appeared in three very different films in 2003. The first of those, a leading role in director [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[Dogville]]'', was an [[experimental film]] set on a bare [[soundstage]]. Though the film divided critics in the United States, Kidman still earned praise for her performance. Peter Travers of ''Rolling Stone'' stated, "Kidman gives the most emotionally bruising performance of her career in Dogville, a movie that never met a cliche it didn't stomp on."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/dogville-20040326 |title=Dogville |last=Travers |first=Peter |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=23 March 2004 |access-date=12 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014061545/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/dogville-20040326 |archive-date=14 October 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> The second film was an adaptation of [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Human Stain (film)|The Human Stain]]'', opposite [[Anthony Hopkins]].
