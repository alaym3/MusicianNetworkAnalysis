Southside gained recognition in the hip hop industry for producing songs for prominent artists across the American hip hop sphere. In 2010, Southside and fellow 1017 label-mate [[Lex Luger (record producer)|Lex Luger]], established their production and songwriting team [[808 Mafia]], where Southside currently is at the helm of the group.<ref name="EMMANUEL C.M">{{cite web | url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2015/08/southside-future-808-mafia-interview/ | title=Southside Explains How Future's New Album Came Together | publisher=XXL | access-date=26 August 2015 | author=EMMANUEL C.M.}}</ref> The basis of his stage name is the place where Luellen grew up, Southside, in Atlanta, GA.<ref name="auto">{{cite web | url=http://respect-mag.com/2011/08/the-illest-motherfucker-alive-an-interview-with-southside/ | title="THE ILLEST MOTHERFUCKER ALIVE" – AN INTERVIEW WITH SOUTHSIDE | publisher=Respect | date=August 30, 2011 | access-date=6 August 2015 | author=Marrack, Peter}}</ref>

==Early life==
Southside grew up in the Southside region of Atlanta, Georgia.<ref name="ref1" /> Growing up, he played [[Little League Baseball]] but gave up the sport after suffering a concussion when he was hit in the head with a ball.<ref name="pigeonsandplanes.com">{{cite web|title=Interview: Southside On Future, Fatherhood, and Making Beats in Six Minutes|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/08/interview-southside-on-future-fatherhood-and-making-beats-in-six-minutes|url-status=live|work=Complex}}</ref> He started making beats when he was 14 years old, when he got his first computer with his uncle.<ref name="ref2">[http://www.igetmuzik.com/portfolio/item/interview-southside-producer/ Interview with Southside] IGetMusic.com</ref>

== Career ==
It was around his mid-teenage years that Southside decided to start taking music production as a serious career path.<ref name="auto1">[http://www.thewhatitdo.com/2011/07/01/southside-music-will-make-us-sizzle/ Southside music will make us sizzle] TheWhatItDo.com</ref> He was later discovered by then unknown rapper [[Waka Flocka Flame]] when he was 17 and through Waka's network, [[Gucci Mane]] eventually signed him to his label 1017 Brick Squad Records.<ref name="auto1" /><ref name="auto2">{{cite web | url=http://hiphopdx.com/dxnext/id.216/title.dxnext-south-side | title=DXnext: South Side | publisher=HipHopDX | date=August 19, 2011 | access-date=7 August 2015 | author=Graham, Nadine}}</ref> At Bricksquad Records, Luellen met [[Lex Luger (musician)|Lex Luger]], who was another producer for Waka Flocka, and the two started working together to lay the production groundwork for Waka Flocka's debut album.

Southside's first major release was the song "Fuck the Club Up," which appeared on Waka Flocka's debut album ''[[Flockaveli]]''. In 2011, Southside co-produced the track "Illest Motherfucker Alive", from [[Kanye West]] & [[Jay-Z]]’s critically acclaimed album ''[[Watch the Throne]]''.<ref>[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.16714/title.southside-talks-producing-for-jay-z-kanye-wests-watch-the-throne Southside Talks Producing For Jay-Z & Kanye West's "Watch The Throne"] HipHopDX</ref> This helped to boost his career and bring him into the mainstream hip hop scene. He has since worked with artists such as [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]], [[B.o.B]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], [[Meek Mill]], [[Lil Scrappy]], [[MGK]]<ref name="ref2" /> among others.

Southside was the main producer of Gucci Mane & Waka Flocka's collaboration album ''[[Ferrari Boyz]]'' and on Flocka's sophomore album ''[[Triple F Life: Friends, Fans & Family]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15739-ferrari-boyz/|title=Gucci Mane / Waka Flocka Flame: Ferrari Boyz Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}</ref>

In January 2013, Southside produced "Millions" - the lead single from [[Pusha T]]'s mixtape ''Wrath of Caine''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pusha T - Millions|url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/tracks/review/pusha-t-millions|publisher=DJ Booth|access-date=2013-02-11}}</ref> The music video for the song was released on February 10. The song sparked controversy when producer [[Rico Beats]] was asked to modify Southside's instrumental for the final version of the song. Southside wasn't notified of the changes, which led to the two producers exchanging threats over [[Twitter]].<ref name="mtv1">{{cite web|title=Southside Calls Out Rico Beats Over Production Credit On Pusha T's "Millions"|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2013/01/14/southside-calls-out-rico-beats-on-twitter-over-millions-co-production-credit/|publisher=[[MTV]]|access-date=2013-02-11}}</ref> In ''Wrath of Caine''{{'s}} official track list, Kanye West is credited as co-producer, instead of Rico Beats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pusha T - Wrath of Caine|url=http://www.datpiff.com/Pusha-T-Wrath-Of-Caine-mixtape.443448.html|publisher=DatPiff|access-date=2013-02-11}}</ref> Also in 2013, Southside & TM88 produced the song "[[Tapout (song)|Tapout]]" by [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] for his album ''[[Rich Gang: Flashy Lifestyle]]''. The song peaked at number 44 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified Gold By The RIAA.

Throughout the early 2010s, Southside's productions have been featured on numerous mixtapes. Along with 808 Mafia's TM88, the single "Danny Glover" became a breakout in early 2014 for Gucci Mane's protégé [[Young Thug]], produced by Southside. By late 2014, Southside's production continue to catapult into Atlanta's hip hop mainstream when Future's mixtape ''[[Monster (Future album)|Monster]]'' went on to become one of the most well acclaimed rap releases during that year as Southside handled a quarter of the mixtape's entire production. The well received project has seen more than a million combined streams and downloads via the online mixtape site [[DatPiff]]. ''Monster '' standout "[[Fuck Up Some Commas|Commas]]" was released as an official commercial single in March 2015 and spent 20 weeks on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 55, simultaneity earning an RIAA gold certification further cementing Southside's career boost.<ref name="Gary Suarez">{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2015/11/04/southside-future-interview/#714288361665 | title=Southside: The Atlanta Producer Behind Future's Hip-Hop Takeover | magazine=Forbes | date=4 November 2015 | access-date=24 February 2016 | first=Gary | last=Suarez}}</ref>

In 2015, Southside continued to push his trap sound in the hip hop industry ubiquitously, especially on various songs produced by him and his 808 Mafia collective. Luellen was responsible for producing a significant portion of [[Future (rapper)|Future]]'s album, ''[[Dirty Sprite 2|DS2]]'', as well as being responsible for producing nine of the ten tracks of Future's mixtape, ''[[56 Nights]]'', in which Southside made the entire project's worth of beats in only one night.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/news/entry/2015-09-03-southside-video-interview | title=SOUTHSIDE ON MAKING "56 NIGHTS," LIVING WITH TRAVI$ SCOTT & MORE (VIDEO INTERVIEW) | publisher=DJBooth | date=September 3, 2015 | access-date=5 October 2015 | author=Brendan Varan.}}</ref> In addition, Southside also contributed to the production of three tracks on the collaborative mixtape  ''[[What a Time to Be Alive]]''  by Future and [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]].

==Artistry==
Southside uses the digital audio workstation, [[FL Studio]] along with custom installed [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] plugins to compose his beats. Luellen's distinct signature [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]] sound is gritty, grimy, and thunderous hip hop street sound which is similar to that of his collaborators, Lex Luger and his group [[808 Mafia]]. Despite such similarities, Luellen's sound is distinctly known to be more gangster, bombastic, gritty, rambunctious, and menacing compared to that of his collaborators. Luellen is known for his dark, belligerent, and menacing hip hop sound coupled with hard hitting [[Roland TR-808|808]] kicks, crisp snare drums, fast hi-hats, frantic synthesizers, sinister lead instruments, and colorfully layered ominous orchestration of synthesized brass, [[Orchestra hit|hits]], stringed, woodwind, and keyboard instruments.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arkatechbeatz.com/brick-squad-producer-southside-interview/ | title=Brick Squad Producer Southside Interview | publisher=Arkatech Beats | date=Nov 15, 2010 | access-date=6 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.complexmag.ca/music/2014/02/meet-tm88-and-southside-of-808-mafia | title=What's Young Thug Like In the Studio?

His main tag is a pitched-up voice saying his name. He also uses his team tag, 808 Mafia and more recently, a sample of the [[Ironside (1967 TV series)]] theme song produced by [[Quincy Jones]].<ref name="ref1" /> Back in the beginning of his career, Southside claimed to complete a single beat in 15 to 30 minutes, but as of 2015, he claims to be able to make a single beat in less than 6 minutes and with no sound.<ref name="pigeonsandplanes.com"/> He cites [[Lil Jon]] as his favorite producer and enjoys the production work made by [[Pharrell]], [[Shawty Redd]], and [[Drumma Boy]].<ref>[http://respect-mag.com/the-illest-motherfucker-alive-an-interview-with-southside/ "The Illest Motherfucker Alive" – an interview with Southside] Respect-Mag.com</ref> He is also influenced by the production works of [[Kanye West]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Timbaland]] and [[Swizz Beatz]].<ref>[http://respect-mag.com/video-lex-luger-southside-talk-producers-software-and-creativity/ Lex Luger & Southside talk producers, software, and creativity] Respect-Mag.com</ref>

Southside also credits modern technology and internet, particularly through the monetization of music through streaming sites such as [[SoundCloud]], [[YouTube]], [[Spotify]], and [[Apple Music]] that help him make a living off of his passion for hip hop music and well as making his own production career possible.<ref name="Gary Suarez"/> Inside the studio, Southside is known for his strong work ethic and strategic marketing acumen when producing beats for artists and getting the finalized track towards the mixtape circuit or for radio play.<ref name="auto2" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ca.complex.com/music/2014/02/meet-tm88-and-southside-of-808-mafia | title=What's Young Thug Like In the Studio? We Interviewed "Danny Glover" Producers 808 Mafia | publisher=Complex | date=28 February 2014 | access-date=7 August 2015 | author=Drake, David}}</ref> Since 2013, Southside began to focus on his career as a producer from an entrepreneurial perspective, cultivating talent while learning the ins and outs of the legality in the music production business as well as negotiating deals and making the financial decisions on every track he is responsible for producing.<ref name="EMMANUEL C.M" />
