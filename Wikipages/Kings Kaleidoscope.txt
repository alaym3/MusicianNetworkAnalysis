'''Kings Kaleidoscope''' is an American alternative rock band based in [[Seattle]], led by producer, singer and songwriter Chad Gardner. Their music features an eclectic range of electronic, woodwind, string and brass instruments, with a musical style described as indie rock meets hip hop production with a sprinkle of Disney. Kings Kaleidoscope has recorded five [[Extended play|EPs]] and four [[LP album|LP]]s.

== Background ==

Based out of [[Seattle]], Washington, Kings Kaleidoscope formed in 2010 at a [[Mars Hill Church]] plant on the campus of the [[University of Washington]], where Gardner was a worship leader.<ref>{{Cite web|last=February 2nd|first=Tess Delbridge {{!}}|last2=Comment|first2=2017 05:03 PM {{!}} Add a|title=Recovering from a really bad church (Mars Hill) - Eternity News|url=https://www.eternitynews.com.au/in-depth/recovering-from-a-really-bad-church-mars-hill/,%20https://www.eternitynews.com.au/in-depth/recovering-from-a-really-bad-church-mars-hill/|access-date=2021-07-28|website=www.eternitynews.com.au|language=en-AU}}</ref> Drawing on a variety of influences from math rock and hip-hop to the dense sound of Canadian indie outfit Broken Social Scene, they recorded their first live EP, ''Sin'', at a [[Good Friday]] service in 2011.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} A year later, they released the studio EP, ''Asaph's Arrows'', followed by a Christmas EP, ''Joy Has Dawned''.

In late 2013, Gardner and the band announced they were leaving Mars Hill,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ranger|first=The|title=Christian band ‘Kings Kaleidoscope’ drops F-bomb in latest album – The Ranger|url=https://acranger.com/2016/10/11/christian-band-kings-kaleidoscope-drops-f-bomb-in-latest-album/|access-date=2021-07-21|language=en-US}}</ref>  where they had served as worship leaders and artists on the church's label. Their fourth EP, 2014's ''Live in Color'', was released by [[BadChristian Music]]. Working with BadChristian Music and well-established indie label [[Tooth & Nail Records]], they released their debut LP, ''[[Becoming Who We Are]]'', on October 27, 2014. Their second studio album ''[[Beyond Control]]'' was released June 24, 2016, and was the band's most commercially successful release to date.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

On August 17, 2017, the band released a mixtape, ''The Beauty Between'', that includes several collaborations with hip-hop artists and producers, including [[Propaganda (musician)|Propaganda]], [[Andy Mineo]], Beautiful Eulogy, [[Derek Minor]], Beleaf and DSTL. Their third studio album, ''Zeal'', was released on April 5, 2019.
