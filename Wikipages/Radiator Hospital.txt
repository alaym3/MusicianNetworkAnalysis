'''Radiator Hospital''' is an American [[indie rock]] band. Though songwriter Sam Cook-Parrott (vocals/guitar) is from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], they are now based in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="propertyofzack">{{cite web|last1=Zarrillo|first1=Zack|title=POZ Showcase: Radiator Hospital|url=http://propertyofzack.com/post/63302579818/poz-showcase-radiator-hospital|publisher=Property of Zack|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="funeralsounds">{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Charles|title=INTERVIEW: Sam Cook-Parrott, Radiator Hospital|url=http://funeralsounds.com/uncategorized/interview-sam-cook-parrott-radiator-hospital/|publisher=Funeral Sounds|accessdate=24 January 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202022026/http://funeralsounds.com/uncategorized/interview-sam-cook-parrott-radiator-hospital/|archivedate=2 February 2017}}</ref> The rest of the current lineup is Cynthia Schemmer (guitar/vocals), Jon Rybicki (bass), and [[Swearin'|Jeff Bolt]] (drums). They have released six albums; two out of print [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] [[compact cassette|cassettes]], and four proper [[LP records|LP]]s put out by [[Salinas Records]].

==History==
After Sam Cook-Parrott's high school band ended, he started recording solo material with a four-track tape recorder.<ref name="funeralsounds" /> He named the project after an [[auto body shop]] in Grand Rapids.<ref name="funeralsounds" /><ref name="propertyofzack"/> Radiator Hospital released their first full-length album in 2010 titled ''My Most Imaginary Friend''.<ref name="radiatorhospital">{{cite web|title=My Most Imaginary Friend|url=https://radiatorhospital.bandcamp.com/album/my-most-imaginary-friend|publisher=Radiator Hospital|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref>

In September 2012, after a few years of regional shows and some minimal touring, Cook-Parrott relocated to Philadelphia, moving into a house with members of [[Swearin']] and other punk bands. This is where the current full band Radiator Hospital lineup settled, also featuring guitarist/vocalist Cynthia Schemmer, bassist Jon Rybicki, and drummer Jeff Bolt.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/>

Their first official full-length, ''Something Wild'', was released in the summer of 2013 on [[Salinas Records]]. It was recorded partially in the same lo-fi manner as earlier cassettes, but added a more studio honed production sound (provided by [[Swearin']] guitarist/vocalist Kyle Gilbride) on the more energetic full-band songs.<ref name="Allmusic Bio">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/radiator-hospital-mn0002798463/biography|title=Radiator Hospital Biography|last=Thomas|first=Fred|website=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=18 April 2018}}</ref>

Their next album ''Torch Song'', also recorded with Gilbride, was released in 2014. In 2017 Radiator Hospital released ''Play the Songs You Like'', which had been recorded by [[Jeff Zeigler]].<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/>

Latest release ''Sings 'Music For Daydreaming''' came out in early 2019. It was also recorded with Zeigler and is the first full length album credited to Radiator Hospital to be performed entirely by Cook-Parrott since 2011.<ref name="Allmusic Daydreaming">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sings-music-for-daydreaming-mw0003268223|title=Radiator Hospital Sings Music for Daydreaming|last=Donelson|first=Marcy|website=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>

Radiator Hospital's recorded output often features collaborations with other vocalists, such as [[Allison Crutchfield|Allison]] and [[Katie Crutchfield]], [[Yowler|Maryn Jones]], and [[Crying (band)|Elaiza Santos]].<ref name="pitchfork2"/> Likewise Cook-Parrott has contributed to recordings by [[Waxahatchee]], [[Japanese Breakfast]] and [[Allison Crutchfield]].<ref name="pitchfork2"/>
