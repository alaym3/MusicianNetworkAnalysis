'''Freddie King''' (September 3, 1934{{snd}}December 28, 1976) was an American [[blues]] guitarist, singer and songwriter. He is considered one of the "Three Kings of the Blues Guitar" (along with [[Albert King]] and [[B.B. King]], none of whom are blood related).<ref name="hal">{{cite web | url=http://www.halleonard.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=393017| title=Three Kings of Blues| last=Trovato| first=Steve| publisher=[[Hal Leonard]]| access-date=March 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name="gibson">{{cite web | url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/3-kings-of-the-blues-1029-2012.aspx| title=3 Kings of the Blues| last=Leonard| first=Michael| publisher=[[Gibson]]| access-date=March 12, 2013}}</ref> Mostly known for his soulful and powerful voice and distinctive guitar playing, King had a major influence on [[electric blues]] music and on many later blues guitarists.

Born in [[Gilmer, Texas|Gilmer]], Texas, King became acquainted with the guitar at the age of six. He started learning the guitar from his mother and his uncle. King moved to [[Chicago]] when he was a teenager; there he formed his first band the Every Hour Blues Boys with guitarist [[Jimmie Lee Robinson]] and drummer Frank "Sonny" Scott. As he was repeatedly being rejected by [[Chess Records]], he got signed to [[Federal Records]], and got his break with single "[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]" and instrumental "[[Hide Away (instrumental)|Hide Away]]", which reached number five on the ''Billboard'' magazine's rhythm and blues chart in 1961. It later became a blues standard. King based his guitar style on [[Texas blues]] and [[Chicago blues]] influences. The album ''[[Freddy King Sings]]'' showcased his singing talents and included the record chart hits "[[You've Got to Love Her with a Feeling]]" and "I'm Tore Down".<ref name="O'Neal">

==Biography==
===1934–1952: Early life===
According to his birth certificate he was named Fred King, and his parents were Ella Mae King and J.&nbsp;T. Christian.<ref name="Estate">{{cite web |url=https://www.freddiekingsite.com/bio|title=Freddie King – Bio |website=freddiekingsite.com (Estate & Foundation) |access-date=March 24, 2019}}</ref> When Freddie was six years old, his mother and his uncle began teaching him to play the guitar. In autumn 1949, he and his family moved from Dallas to the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of Chicago.<ref name="Estate"/>

In 1952 King started working in a steel mill. In the same year he married another Texas native, Jessie Burnett. They had seven children.<ref name="Estate"/>

===1952–1959: Move to Chicago and early works===
Almost as soon as he had moved to Chicago, King started sneaking into South Side nightclubs, where he heard blues performed by [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[T-Bone Walker]], [[Elmore James]], and [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]]. King formed his first band, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with the guitarist [[Jimmie Lee Robinson]] and the drummer Frank "Sonny" Scott. In 1952, while employed at a steel mill, the eighteen-year-old King occasionally worked as a [[sideman]] with such bands as the Little Sonny Cooper Band and Earl Payton's Blues Cats. In 1953 he recorded with the latter for Parrot Records, but these recordings were never released. As the 1950s progressed, King played with several of Muddy Waters's sidemen and other Chicago mainstays, including the guitarists [[Jimmy Rogers]], [[Robert Lockwood Jr.]], [[Eddie Taylor]], and [[Hound Dog Taylor]]; the bassist [[Willie Dixon]]; the pianist [[Memphis Slim]]; and the harmonicist [[Little Walter]].

In 1956 he cut his first record as a leader, for El-Bee Records. The A-side was "Country Boy", a [[duet (music)|duet]] with Margaret Whitfield.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Voice of the Blues: Classic Interviews from Living Blues Magazine|author1=O'Neal, Jim |author2=Van Singel, Amy |publisher=Routledge| page=359}}</ref> The B-side was a King vocal. Both tracks feature the guitar of Robert Lockwood, Jr., who during these years was also adding rhythm backing and fills to Little Walter's records.<ref name="Estate"/>

King was repeatedly rejected in auditions for the South Side's [[Chess Records]], the premier blues label, which was the home of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter. The complaint was that King sang too much like [[B.B. King]]. A newer blues scene, lively with nightclubs and upstart record companies, was burgeoning on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]], though. The bassist and producer [[Willie Dixon]], during a period of estrangement from Chess in the late 1950s, asked King to come to [[Cobra Records]] for a session, but the results have never been heard. Meanwhile, King established himself as perhaps the biggest musical force on the West Side. He played along with [[Magic Sam]] and reputedly played backing guitar, uncredited, on some of Sam's tracks for [[Mel London]]'s [[Chief Records|Chief and Age]] labels,<ref name="Estate"/> though King does not stand out on them.

===1959–1962: Federal Records===
In 1959 King got to know [[Sonny Thompson]], a pianist, producer, and A&R man for Cincinnati's [[King Records (USA)|King Records]]. King Records' owner, [[Syd Nathan]], signed King to the subsidiary [[Federal Records]] in 1960. King recorded his debut single for the label on August 26, 1960: "[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]" backed with "[[You've Got to Love Her with a Feeling]]" (again credited as "Freddy" King). From the same recording session at the King Studios in Cincinnati, Ohio, King cut the instrumental "[[Hide Away (instrumental)|Hide Away]]", which the next year reached number five on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]] and number 29 on the [[Pop Singles Chart|Pop chart]], an unprecedented accomplishment for a blues instrumental at a time when the genre was still largely unknown to white audiences. It was originally released as the B-side of "I Love the Woman". "Hide Away" was King's melange of a theme by [[Hound Dog Taylor]] and parts by others, such as "The Walk", by [[Jimmy McCracklin]], and "Peter Gunn", as credited by King. The title of the tune refers to Mel's Hide Away Lounge, a popular blues club on the West Side of Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t874621|pure_url=yes}}|title=Hideaway| author=Dahl, Bill|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 14, 2009}}</ref> [[Willie Dixon]] later claimed that he had recorded King performing "Hide Away" for [[Cobra Records]] in the late 1950s, but such a version has never surfaced.<ref>{{cite book|title=I Am the Blues: The Willie Dixon Story|url=https://archive.org/details/iamblueswilliedi00dixo|url-access=registration|author1=Dixon, Willie |author2=Snowden, Don |publisher=Da Capo}}</ref> "Hide Away" became a [[blues standard]].

After their success with "Hide Away," King and Thompson recorded thirty instrumentals, including "[[The Stumble]]," "Just Pickin'," "Sen-Sa-Shun," "Side Tracked," "San-Ho-Zay," "High Rise," and "The Sad Nite Owl".<ref>{{cite book|title=Chicago Soul|author= Pruter, Robert|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=236}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p406|pure_url=yes}}| title=Freddie King: Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 14, 2009}}</ref> They recorded vocal tracks throughout this period but often released the tunes as instrumentals on albums.

During the Federal period, King toured with many notable R&B artists of the day, including [[Sam Cooke]], [[Jackie Wilson]], and [[James Brown]].

===1966–1974: Cotillion, Shelter, RSO Records===
[[File:FreddieKing1973.jpg|{{largethumb}}|King in Amsterdam, 1973]]
King's contract with Federal expired in 1966, and his first overseas tour followed in 1967. His availability was noticed by the producer and saxophonist [[King Curtis]], who had recorded a cover of "Hide Away", with Cornell Dupree on guitar, in 1962. Curtis signed King to [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] in 1968, which resulted in two [[LP record|LPs]], ''Freddie King Is a Blues Master'' (1969) and ''My Feeling for the Blues'' (1970), produced by Curtis for the Atlantic subsidiary [[Cotillion Records]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Texas Music|author=Hardy, Laing, Barnard and Perretta| publisher=Schirmer Books|page=251}}</ref>

In 1969 King hired Jack Calmes as his manager, who secured him an appearance at the 1969 Texas Pop Festival, alongside [[Led Zeppelin]] and others,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.texaspopfestival.com|author=Hayner, Richard.C|title=The Texas Pop Festival|publisher=texaspopfestival.com|access-date=May 14, 2009}}</ref> and this led to King's signing a recording contract with [[Shelter Records]], a new label established by the rock pianist [[Leon Russell]] and the record producer [[Denny Cordell]] and recorded at their studio, [[The Church Studio]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma.]] The company treated King as an important artist, flying him to Chicago to the former [[Chess Records|Chess studios]] to record the album ''Getting Ready'' and providing a lineup of top session musicians, including Russell.<ref>{{cite web| url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r572199|pure_url=yes}}|title=Freddie King, ''Getting Ready&nbsp;...'': Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 14, 2009}}</ref> Three albums were made during this period, including blues classics and new songs, such as "Going Down", written by [[Don Nix]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Texas Music|author=Kosta, Rick|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=187}}</ref>

King performed alongside the big rock acts of the day, such as [[Eric Clapton]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pattofan.com/MikePatto/nme8-7-76.htm|title=Crystal Palace Bowl Concert|author=Tony Stewart, NME|publisher=pattofan.com| access-date=January 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Grand Funk Railroad]] (whose song "[[We're an American Band (song)|We're an American Band]]" mentions King in its lyrics), and for a young, mainly white audience, along with the white tour drummer Gary Carnes, for three years, before signing with [[RSO Records]]. In 1974 he recorded ''Burglar'', for which [[Tom Dowd]] produced the track "Sugar Sweet" at Criteria Studios in Miami, with the guitarists Clapton and [[George Terry (musician)|George Terry]], the drummer [[Jamie Oldaker]] and the bassist [[Carl Radle]]. [[Mike Vernon (producer)|Mike Vernon]] produced the other tracks.<ref>

===Death===
Nearly constant touring took its toll on King—he was on the road almost 300 days out of the year. In 1976 he began suffering from [[stomach ulcer]]s. His health quickly deteriorated, and he died on December 28 of complications from this illness and acute [[pancreatitis]], at the age of 42.

According to those who knew him, King's untimely death was due to stress, a legendary "hard-partying lifestyle",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/12/150496715/freddie-king-rock-hall-inductee-patriarch-of-blues-rock|title=Freddie King: Patriarch of Blues Rock|website=[[NPR.org]]|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref> and a poor diet of consuming [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]]s because as he told a journalist, "they've got food in them."<ref>{{cite web | title=Freddie King And The Harsh 'Business' Of The Blues | website=NPR.org | date=2010-07-14 | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128496104 | access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref>

==Musical style==
King had an intuitive style, often creating guitar parts with vocal nuances.<ref>{{cite book|title=All Over the Map: True Heroes of Texas Music|url=https://archive.org/details/allovermaptruehe00corc|url-access=limited|author=Corcoran, Michael| date=2005|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/allovermaptruehe00corc/page/n224 54]}}</ref> He achieved this by using the open-string sound associated with Texas blues and the raw, screaming tones of [[West Side, Chicago]] blues. King's combination of the Texas and Chicago sounds gave his music a more contemporary feel than that of many Chicago bands who were still performing 1950s-style music, and he befriended the younger generation of blues musicians. In his early career he played a solid-body gold-top [[Gibson Les Paul]] with [[P-90]] pickups.<ref name="Gress">

==Legacy==
By proclamation of the governor of Texas, [[Ann Richards]], September 3, 1993, was declared Freddie King Day, an honor reserved for Texas legends, such as [[Bob Wills]] and [[Buddy Holly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fkimt|author=Van Beveren, Amy|title=Freddie King|publisher=tshaonline.org}}</ref>  He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/freddie-king|title=Freddie King|publisher=[[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]]|access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref> and placed 15th in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.<ref name="rs100"/>

Several of King's early 1960s instrumentals found their way into the repertoire of [[Instrumental surf|surf music]] bands:<ref name="Dahl">

According to music critic [[Cub Koda]], King has influenced guitarists such as [[Eric Clapton]], [[Mick Taylor]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and [[Lonnie Mack]].<ref name="Koda"/> In Michael Corcoran's words, King "merged the most vibrant characteristics of both [Chicago and Texas] regional styles and became the biggest guitar hero of the mid-sixties British blues revivalists, who included Eric Clapton, [[Savoy Brown]], Chicken Shack, and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]-era [[Fleetwood Mac]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Corcoran|first=Michael|page=[https://archive.org/details/allovermaptruehe00corc/page/n224 51]|title=All Over the Map: True Heroes of Texas Music|url=https://archive.org/details/allovermaptruehe00corc|url-access=limited|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0292709552}}</ref> Clapton said in 1985 that King's 1961 song "I Love the Woman" was "the first time I heard that electric lead-guitar style, with the bent notes ... [it] started me on my path." He later added in an interview with Dan Forte of ''[[Guitar World]]'' that King's guitar playing on his rendition of "[[I Got a Woman]]": "That just sent me into a complete kind of ecstasy, and it scared the shit of me.  I'd never heard anything like it, and I thought I'd never get anywhere near it.  And I know now that I never will, but it was what immediately made me want to carry on."{{Quote without source|date=June 2021}}  As ''Rolling Stone'' later wrote, "Clapton shared his love of King with fellow British guitar heroes Peter Green, [[Jeff Beck]] and Mick Taylor, all of whom were profoundly influenced by King's sharpened-treble tone and curt melodic hooks on iconic singles such as 'The Stumble,' 'I'm Tore Down' and 'Someday, After Awhile.'"<ref name="rs100">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/freddy-king-19691231|title=100 Greatest Guitarists.

King was among many pioneering African-American blues musicians to embrace the British blues scene and tour its club circuit in the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Roberta Freund|year=2013|title=How Britain Got the Blues: The Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=978-1409493761|page=220}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] credited King's embrace of Britain with creating his renown as a pioneer of electric blues guitar.<ref name="CG"/> In [[Gary Graff]]'s ''[[MusicHound|MusicHound Rock]]'' (1996), the entry on King states: "Although his reputation rests with his guitar, King also sang with an underrated, powerful style. His lasting influence has insured Freddie King's recognition as one of the great postwar blues masters."<ref name="MH">{{cite book|editor-last=Graff|editor1-first=Gary|year=1996|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=[[Visible Ink Press]]|isbn=0787610372|url=https://archive.org/details/musichoundrockes0000unse}}</ref>

=== Appraisal of recording work ===
Recommending what albums of King's music to hear, ''MusicHound Rock'' cited the 1993 [[Rhino Records|Rhino]] compilation ''The Best of Freddie King'', for focusing on "the fruitful abundance" of his recordings for King Records (1961–66), and the 1995 [[Black Top Records|Black Top]] CD ''Live at the Electric Ballroom, 1974'', for its "blasting, ripping concert" recording along with "a rare pair of acoustic" performances; ''Freddie King Is a Blues Master'' (1969) and ''My Feeling for the Blues'' (1970) were named records to avoid, as they "both suffer from thin accompaniment, too little guitar and reedy vocals".<ref name="MH"/> John Swenson, writing in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Guide]]'' (1999), also recommended the Electric Ballroom recording, along with "Home Cooking's ''Live at the Texas Opry House'' (documenting a 1976 show in Houston)", saying they are "the best antidotes to King's lackluster studio work from these years".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide|last=Swenson|first=John|year=1999|chapter=Freddie King|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-679-76873-4|url=https://archive.org/details/rollingstonejazz00swens}}</ref>

In his only review of a King album, ''The Best of Freddie King'' (1975) by [[Shelter Records]], Christgau wrote in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981) that the 1971–73 recordings are "a bunch of [[Leon Russell]] and [[Don Nix]] boogies, [King's] voice blurred, his guitar all fake and roll." He added that, while the guitarist had recorded some "acute R&B" singles early in his career, he later "coast[ed] for years".<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: K|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=K&bk=70|access-date=February 28, 2019|website=Robertchristgau.com}}</ref> However, in a review of King's 1974 album ''Burglar'' for [[AllMusic]], Joe Viglione called it "entertaining and concise" and believed the album "stands as a solid representation of an important musician which is as enjoyable as it is historic".<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.allmusic.com/album/burglar-mw0000651697| last = Viglione| first = Joe| title = Freddie King: ''Burglar'' – Album Review| website = [[AllMusic]]| access-date = May 6, 2019}}</ref>
