'''Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros''' is an American [[folk rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 2007. The group is led by singer [[Alex Ebert]]. The band's name is based on a story Ebert wrote in his youth, about a messianic figure named Edward Sharpe.  Drawing from [[roots rock]], [[folk rock|folk]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[psychedelic music]], the band's image and sound evoke the [[hippie movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s. The group's first show was played July 18, 2007, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood, California]]. Their first studio album, ''[[Up from Below]]'', was released on July 7, 2009, on Community Records and featured the popular single "[[Home (Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros song)|Home]]". The group released their second full-length album, ''[[Here (Edward Sharpe album)|Here]]'', on May 29, 2012, and third album, ''[[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros (album)|Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]]'', on July 23, 2013. Their fourth studio album, ''[[PersonA]]'', was released in April 2016.

Since its founding, the band has undergone several alterations. Most notably, singer Jade Castrinos left the band in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |date=4 June 2014 |author= Joe Youorski |title=Jade Castrinos Booted from Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/06/jade-castrinos-kicked-out-of-edward-sharpe-and-the.html |website= [[Paste Magazine]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= Joe Youorski |title= Edward Sharpe And The Magnetic Zeros: Jade Quit, We Didn't Kick Her Out |url= https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/edward-sharpe-the-magnetic-zeros-jade-quit-we-didnt-kick-her-out/#/slide/1 |website= Musicfeeds.com.au |date= 25 March 2015 |quote= We asked her to take off one tour.

==History==

===Origin and first studio album (Up From Below) ===
[[File:Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.JPG|thumb|left|The group performing in a park in 2009]]
After years of the [[Los Angeles]] party life and subsequent drug addiction, [[Ima Robot]] frontman [[Alex Ebert]] broke up with his girlfriend, moved out of his house, and spent time in [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].<ref name=paste0909>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/09/edward-sharpe-and-the-magnetic-zeros-cmon-get-happ.html |title=Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros: C'Mon Get Happy! :: Music :: Features :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date=September 28, 2009 |access-date=August 23, 2010}}</ref> During this time, Ebert began to write a book about a [[Messiah|messianic figure]] named Edward Sharpe who was "sent down to Earth to kinda heal and save mankind, but he kept getting distracted by girls and falling in love." Ebert adopted the Sharpe persona as his [[alter ego]]. He said, "I don't want to put too much weight on it, because in some ways it's just a name that I came up with. But I guess if I look deeper, I do feel like I had lost my [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in general. I really didn't know what was going on or who I was anymore. Adopting another name helped me open up an avenue to get back."<ref>{{cite web|last=McDonald |first=Scott |url=http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2009-11-06/concerts-music-clubs/edward-sharpe-aka-alex-ebert-finds-himself-with-the-magnetic-zeros#ixzz0rss1BuRA |title=Edward Sharpe, aka Alex Ebert, finds himself with The Magnetic Zeros |publisher=Sdnn.com |date=November 6, 2009 |access-date=August 23, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100831180906/http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2009-11-06/concerts-music-clubs/edward-sharpe-aka-alex-ebert-finds-himself-with-the-magnetic-zeros| archive-date= August 31, 2010 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

Ebert began initial writing and recording completely alone, doing "the horn lines with [his] mouth or a kazoo on the demos" and "all the background vocals layering&nbsp;... pretending that there were people there."<ref name="transversomedia1">[http://www.transversomedia.com/articles/edward-sharpe-and-the-magnetic-zeros-alex-ebert-new-interview-persona Edward Sharpe Is Dead: Alex Ebert on The Magnetic Zeros' Pursuit of Failure, Identity, and Unrealism — TRANSVERSO].

In mid-2009, Ebert, Castrinos, and a group of musicians toured the country by bus as Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros. The first show they played in 2009 was at the [[Marfa Film Festival]] in [[Marfa, Texas]].<ref name="paste0909"/> The band recorded their debut album, ''[[Up from Below]]'', in Laurel Canyon. Produced by Nicolo Aglietti and Aaron Older, it was released on July 14, 2009. ''Up from Below'' is also the name of one of the songs in this album, in which Alex states "I was only five/when my dad told me I'd die/I cried as he said son/ was nothing could be done". Says Alexander, "My dad would be doing therapy in his office upstairs and I'd hear screamings, because they'd be role-playing and he'd be acting as his patient's father and they'd get upset and hit him and all this stuff. When he wasn't working, I'd go up there to draw and one day the music he was playing, Beethoven I think, delivered to me the idea of life and death. The information was bequeathed to me by the music. It was sonic and emotional. I tapped my dad on the shoulder and asked him if I was going to die and he said, 'Yeah.'" <ref name="MyUser_The_Independent_June_5_2020c">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/second-coming-how-alexander-ebert-reinvented-himself-as-a-messianic-figure-called-edward-sharpe-2257504.html |title=Second coming: How Alexander Ebert reinvented himself as a messianic figure called Edward Sharpe |newspaper=The Independent |access-date= June 5, 2020}}</ref>

===''Big Easy Express'' and second studio album (Here) ===
In April 2011, the band joined [[Mumford & Sons]] and [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] on the [[Railroad Revival Tour]]. According to ''[[American Songwriter]]'', the tour stopped in six cities, playing alternative venues such as an Austin, Texas high school where Mumford & Sons taught the marching band how to play their hit "The Cave". The tour was also the subject of Grammy-nominated director [[The Malloys|Emmett Malloy]]'s latest documentary ''Big Easy Express'', which strove to capture "the pure joy of music" through Americana folk imagery.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Moss|first=Marissa|title=Mumford & Co.

In 2011, Railroad Revival Tour bands Mumford & Sons, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Old Crow Medicine Show together closed their shows at every stop with "This Train".

The group's second album, ''[[Here (Edward Sharpe album)|Here]]'', was released on May 29, 2012.

===Third studio album (Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros) ===
The band's self-titled third studio album, ''[[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros (album)|Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]]'', was released in 2013. This was followed by tours of North America, UK, Europe, and Australia which included headlining concert dates as well as major festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edwardsharpeandthemagneticzeros.com/news/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204844/http://edwardsharpeandthemagneticzeros.com/news/ |archive-date=August 12, 2014 }}</ref> The band became known for taking people onstage with them, including a former patient they had previously met in a hospital performance, and a disabled man in a wheelchair.<ref name="transversomedia1"/>

===Fourth studio album (PersonA) ===
The band's fourth studio album, ''[[PersonA]]'', was released April 15, 2016 through Community Music. Recording the music almost entirely in one room together in [[New Orleans]], their approach was a far cry from their ramshackle, come-one-come-all production audible on recordings of their previous albums.

In an in-depth interview with [[Transverso Media]], Ebert explained his desire to evolve on ''PersonA'', stating, "In a lot of ways this album does things that are missing." He went on to discuss why the name Edward Sharpe is crossed out on the cover, saying, "There was no character to begin with, so why not kill him? He never really was there. If anything, and at most, Edward Sharpe was a vehicle for me to get to slough off whatever I had become up until that point, and to get back to or sort of allow my pure self to come forth into sort of a clean slate."<ref name="transversomedia1"/>
