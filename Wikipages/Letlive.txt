Letlive was formed in Los Angeles in 2002 by vocalist [[Jason Aalon Butler]], drummer Alex Haythorn, guitarist Ben Sharp and bassist Christian Johansen.<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web | last = Heaney | first = Gregory | title = Letlive - Music Biography, Credits and Discography : AllMusic | work = [[AllMusic]] | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/letlive-p664075 | access-date = April 15, 2011}}</ref> In 2003, the band's debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''Exhaustion, Salt Water, and Everything in Between'' was released on at One Records.
