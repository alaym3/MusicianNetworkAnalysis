'''Porter''' is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[indie rock]] [[rock band|band]] based in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], Mexico.<ref>Peña, Patricia (June 16, 2007). "[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/06/16/index.php?section=espectaculos&article=a10n1esp Porter: somos la generación del escepticismo; todo nos deprime]", ''[[La Jornada]]''. Retrieved on 2009-07-18.</ref><ref>Peña, Patricia (June 15, 2007). "[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/06/15/index.php?section=opinion&article=a11o1esp Liquits, Porter, fiesta Diablito]", ''[[La Jornada]]''. Retrieved on 2009-07-18.</ref>

Despite their uncommon sound the band got decent radio airplay on important broadcasting stations, their videos: "Espiral", "Daphne" and "Host of a Ghost" had a good reception in music video channels.<ref>Armenta, Francisco (September 7, 2007). "Entrevista: Juan Son: Abraza la natu", ''[[Mural (Guadalajara)|Mural]]'', p. 31.</ref> "Daphne" was placed in the [[Telehit]]'s Top Ten videos and, more recently, "Host of a Ghost". (October 2007). The band has overall acceptance among critics & the audience, which often labels their sound as weird, interesting and vanguardish.

== History ==
===Formation, ''Donde los ponys pastan'', and ''Atemahawke''===
Porter was formed in May 2004. At the beginning they were an instrumental band, until [[Juan Son]] joined the band that same year. They then recorded the EP ''[[Donde los ponys pastan]]'', with [[3er piso records]], a Mexican indie record label. This EP was produced by [[Alejandro Pérez (musician)|Alejandro Pérez]] ''Orco'' (member of [[Azul Violeta]]) and includes seven songs, among which are: "No te encuentro" ("I can't find you"), "Girl", "Daphne", "Bipolar" and their most popular song "Espiral". There are also two instrumental songs in this EP called "Interlude" and "Interlude Complicado". Later that year, Porter made it to the semi-finals of an indie rock band contest called ''0-music'', with the song "I can't find you".

On September 3, 2006, they served as the opening act for [[The Strokes]] at the [[Arena VFG]] in Guadalajara.

Porter performed on the 2007 [[Vive Latino]] festival, where the first copies of their debut album, ''[[Atemahawke]]'' were available. The album went on sale on May 15, 2007.

Porter also performed for the first time outside of Mexico in Hollywood, California at Al Borde's Rock N' Bliss concert on October 12, 2007, and, in 2008, at the [[Coachella Festival]]<ref>Magaña, Omar (April 27, 2008). "Imponen británicos su estilo en Coachella", ''[[Reforma]]'', p. 15.</ref> where [[Natalia Lafourcade]] joined them on stage during the performance of "Host of a Ghost".

Their music has been classified as [[Alternative rock|alternative]], [[Indie (music)|indie]], and [[Experimental rock|experimental]]. However, lyrics often explore [[Surrealist music|surrealist]] and [[space rock]] themes combining English and Spanish languages. As an example, the 2007 track "Xoloitzcuintle Chicloso" contains Spanish words from [[Nahuatl]] (the title comes from ''xoloitzcuintli'', a kind of dog, and ''tzictli'', gum, gummy dog); the whole story relies on a cat-alike dressed kid (Vega) and a talking dog (Chicloso). On the other hand, "Host of a Ghost" and "Girl" were written completely in English.

===Break-up===
After a hiatus and various rumors of disbanding, they dissolved after playing the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in [[Indio, California]] in 2008.

[[Juan Son]], former vocalist for Porter went on to focus on a solo project, releasing the critically praised ''[[Mermaid Sashimi]]'' in February 2009. Victor "Villor" Valverde (former Porter member) joined Juan Son's band for a time before working on his architecture career. The first new single from ''Mermaid Sashimi'' is titled "Nada". A music video was recorded for the song. Juan Son and his newly formed band recently opened for [[Sigur Rós]] in Mexico City and took part in the Rock N' Exa concert in 2009. The song "Goldfish" was released as the second single from ''Mermaid Sashimi'', as with some of Porter's previous music it is entirely in English.

[[Juan Son]] has mentioned in interviews that the last few months as a member of Porter were no longer inspiring to him. He admitted to being very lazy and playing with little or no enthusiasm. He said he got along great with the guys and still does to this day but he saw himself doing something else. His solo album has less guitars and live drums and more samples and a mixture of different genres.

The other members of the band focused on finishing their education and their own solo project, most notably, Fernando de la Huerta in the band Vansen Tiger and Diego Bacter with his group Holger and solo work.

===Reunion and ''Moctezuma''===
On December 4, 2012, during the announcement of the Vive Latino 2013 music festival lineup, it was confirmed that Porter would meet to perform at the festival. In 2013, several days before their performance, they released their first new single since getting back together, "Kiosco". A few months later on June 8, Porter performed again at the first annual Loudblue festival presented by Ballantine's. Two days prior, the band announced on their Facebook page that Juan Son would not be joining them on stage, instead the musician David Velasco would be filling in. There were no specific reasons cited for Juan Son's absence.

July 17, the band announced: "We would like to inform you all that Juan Carlos [Juan Son] will not be participating with Porter for an indefinite period of time. We spent 5 years hoping to meet again, but now we are only four on the journey. We are writing new music which in September we will share. Soon we will announce new dates. We appreciate the unconditional support. Porter forever."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 2015 they released a new album, ''[[Moctezuma (album)|Moctezuma]]'', and toured to promote it during 2015 and 2016. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' considered this one of the top ten latin albums of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|author=Andrew Casillas, Suzy Exposito, and Isabela Raygoza|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/10-best-latin-albums-of-the-year-20151230/porter-moctezuma-20151222|title=10 Best Latin Albums of the Year|date=December 30, 2015}}</ref>

===''Las Batallas''===
On November 28, 2018, the band released the EP ''Las Batallas del Tiempo'', a teaser for the band's then upcoming third studio album.<ref>{{cite web|website=El Ukelele|last=Domínguez|first=José|url=https://elukelele.com/noticias/porter-las-batallas-del-tiempo/|title=Porter presenta el EP Las Batallas del Tiempo|date=November 28, 2018|accessdate=August 16, 2021|language=Spanish}}</ref> ''Las Batallas'', the band's third album, was released on May 24, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|url=https://music.apple.com/mx/album/las-batallas/1465997332?l=en|title=Las Batallas by Porter|accessdate=August 16, 2021}}</ref>

===Fourth studio album===
On May 5, 2021, the band released a new song and music video, "Sonámbulo". The song is set to appear on the band's currently untitled fourth studio album.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Rolling Stone]] Mexico|last=García|first=Liliana|url=https://rollingstone.com.mx/sonambulo-nuevo-sencillo-porter/|title=Escucha "Sonámbulo", el nuevo sencillo de Porter|date=May 5, 2021|accessdate=August 16, 2021|language=Spanish}}</ref> The album's second single, "Sol@", was released on August 13.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Apple Music]]|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/sol-single/1579758254|title=Sol@ - Single by Porter|accessdate=August 16, 2021}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
Their sound consists of a mixture of electronic and acoustic beats, rock guitars, sound loops and Juan Son's distinctive [[tenor]] voice and high pitch vocals. The band had cited artists such [[Air (French band)|Air]], [[Sigur Rós]], [[Caifanes]], [[Zurdok]], [[Röyksopp]], [[Café Tacvba]], [[The Cure]] and [[Mecano]]<ref name=alborde>{{cite web|url=http://alborde.com/content/view/1843/71 |title=Porter ¿La Salvación del Rock Mexicano? |author=Jesus Olvera |year=2006 |language=Spanish |publisher=alborde.com |accessdate=22 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314101328/http://alborde.com/content/view/1843/71 |archivedate=March 14, 2010 }}</ref> as influences. In fact, portions of songs from several of these influences and others have been included in live performances of their songs.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
