'''Odd Nordstoga''' (born 10 December 1972) is a folk singer, musician, actor and [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|editor]] from [[Vinje]] in [[Telemark]], Norway. In 2004, he went from relative obscurity to becoming the country's biggest selling recording artist, with the phenomenal success of his first solo album proper, ''"Luring"''. The album, a fusion of pop and [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[folk music]], has sold more than 160,000 copies in Norway to date and earned him several [[Spellemannsprisen]] awards. For the album ''Strålande Jul'', released together with [[Sissel Kyrkjebø]], he won an unprecedented 11 Norwegian platinum trophies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kjendis.no/2010/04/20/kjendis/odd_nordstoga/sissel_kyrkjeb/musikk/platinaplate/11360382/ |title=11 platinaplater til superduo - kjendis - Dagbladet.no |publisher=Kjendis.no |date=2010-04-20 |access-date=2010-12-14}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Nordstoga grew up at [[Plassen]] in [[Vinje]], [[Telemark]], the [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] of author [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]]. He hails from a hugely cultural family. His mother, [[Ellen Bojer Nordstoga]] is a [[folk singer]]. His father, [[Olav Nordstoga]] is a folk singer, former politician and the chairman of the Vinje Literary Days. In addition, brother [[Aasmund Nordstoga]] has made a name for himself as a singer, dancer, actor and radio and TV presenter. Organist [[Kåre Nordstoga]] is his second cousin.

Nordstoga resides in [[Lambertseter]], a [[borough]] of [[Oslo]], together with his wife and three children.

==Early career==
His career as a recording artist spans 8 years. He made his debut as a recording artist in 1997 with the band Something Odd and their self-titled debut. This album earned them a record deal with BMG Norway and they swiftly released the follow-up ''Solreven'' in 1998. Two minor radio-hits, the [[folk rock]] inspired "Fuggel i Karmen" and the haunting ballad "Ingen eg kjenner", came out of this album, but the album sold poorly and the band was dropped from their label. In 2000, Odd Nordstoga changed the name of Something Odd to simply [[Nordstoga]], signed to the Norwegian label Grappa and released a more [[pop music]] oriented self-titled album. A couple of minor radio hits, "Dag" and "Bie på deg", ensued. Nordstoga won Norway's prestigious [[Edvardprisen Award]] for "Bie på Deg". However, soon afterwards they disbanded.

Between 2001–2003, Odd Nordstoga concentrated most of his efforts towards the more traditional folk music of Telemark. With his other band [[Blåmann Blåmann]] (named after the poem by [[Aasmund O. Vinje]]), consisting of Nordstoga and his friends from Vinje, guitarist [[Asgaut H. Bakken]], flute player [[Silje Hegg]] and harding fiddle virtuoso [[Lars Underdal]], he released a self-titled album to great reviews in 2001, and scored a radio hit in "Tippe Tippe Tuve". In 2002 he teamed up with highly respected Norwegian folk musician [[Øyonn Groven Myhren]] (amongst other things known from the folk ensemble [[Dvergmål]]) to write, perform and release the album ''Nivelkinn'', based on poems by Telemark poet [[Aslaug Vaa]]. This collaboration scored a couple of minor radio hits in "Uppi Måneskin" and "Guten og Folen", and earned them the Spellemannprisen award (Norwegian equivalent of the Grammy) in 2003 for best folk music album. Nordstoga was also involved in a book release in 2002, namely the song book ''Song for deg og meg'' (''Song for you and me'') which he edited, consisting of children songs written in [[Nynorsk]], one of Norway's two written standards. In 2014 he received the [[Nynorsk User of the Year]] award.

==Breakthrough==
[[File:Odd Nordstoga Stavernfestivalen (161603).jpg|thumb|Nordstoga at [[Stavernfestivalen]] in Norway in 2016]]
It was also in 2003 that the mainstream opened its eyes to Nordstoga as he teamed up with famous singer/actress/writer [[Herborg Kråkevik]] to write and perform the title track from her [[Édith Piaf]]-cabaret, entitled ''Eg & Edith''. The cabaret and its soundtrack, although greatly anticipated, was a minor flop in terms of album sales and tickets sold, whereas the title track proved to be a nice radio hit for the duo. Nordstoga, together with lyricist [[Stein Versto]] (another Vinje native), also contributed with the track "Rosevev" on this album.

Nordstoga had previously worked with Kråkevik in the film ''Det Rare'', based on a short story by famous Norwegian writer [[Tarjei Vesaas]].

In 2004, Nordstoga signed for [[Universal Records]] and made his definitive breakthrough with the album ''[[Luring (album)|Luring]]'', selling 150.000 copies and spending 14 weeks on top of the Norwegian album charts. The lead single from the album, about a howling pig entitled "Kveldssong for deg og meg", is already a Norwegian evergreen and one of the most played songs on Norwegian radio in 2004. "Texas", "Lause Ting", "Hallo Hallo" and "Farvel til deg" from the same album also became massive radio hits for Nordstoga.

The tour in the wake of the album, the so-called ''Luringtur'' tour, which Nordstoga played together with his backing band [[Daz Nordstogaz Allstars]], played to a 60.000 strong crowd. At the Spellemannprisen Awards in February 2005, Nordstoga won two awards as he was named best male artist and Artist of the Year. In the summer of 2005, Nordstoga once again took to the road for the ''"Luringtur" MK II'' tour.

Nordstoga has also been involved in TV productions. In 2004 he did the music for the Norwegian children's series ''Linus i Svingen'' that was broadcast on NRK 1, Norway's public broadcaster. The theme song, "Svingensongen", is being released in 2005 on the compilation album ''Tidenes beste barneplate 2''. He has also been involved with the music for Norway's vastly popular UHU! series.

In June 2005, Nordstoga teamed up with some of Norway's finest jazz musicians and performed the piece "Pilegrim" to great acclaim at Festspillene i Bergen (Bergen Music Festival). the lyrics were written by lyricists [[Stein Versto]] and [[Ragnar Hovland]], both previously involved in the ''Luring'' production. In August 2005, he made a cameo appearance with Norwegian rap-collective [[Klovner i Kamp]], singing the chorus to their single "Syng".

Odd Nordstoga has also done projects for 'The Salvation Army' and folk music projects with different people, amongst other things, renditions of the famous Telemark piece "Storegut" with brother Aasmund and [[Lars Underdal]], and guest appearances with the band Fake It or Leave It who play Beatles songs Norwegian folk music style.

Nordstoga released his follow-up to ''Luring'' in October 2006. Entitled ''Heim Te Mor'', the album received a great deal of airplay and acclaim from critics all over Norway. The radio single and title track "Heim Te Mor" became a radio hit upon release in September 2006, marking another milestone for Nordstoga as this release marks his first [[music video]] as a solo artist, an animated video based on a Nordstoga concert in his local community made by the Animidas film maker crew. With radio single number two "Frøken Franzen" coinciding with the album's release, Odd Nordstoga looks set for another album success. He is also responsible for the soundtrack to the forthcoming Christmas children series ''Jul i Svingen'' on Norway's NRK TV channel, which is the follow-up to ''Linus i Svingen''.

Nordstoga released the songbook ''Songfuggel i Karmen'' in 2007, containing his greatest hits and his personal favourites. In 2008 the album ''Pilegrim'' was released to great acclaim, securing the third bestseller in a row for the artist. In the autumn of the same year Nordstoga, together with his brother [[Aasmund Nordstoga]] and fiddler [[Per Anders Buen Garnås]], toured Norway with a revamped version of the [[Storegut]] performance.

==''Strålande Jul'' and sales record==
On November 9, 2009 Nordstoga released the album ''Strålande Jul'' together with Norwegian soprano [[Sissel Kyrkjebø]]. The album is a collection of Norwegian, Swedish and Danish Christmas songs. The album was issued under the moniker ''Sissel & Odd'' and accompanied by a series of concerts in Scandinavia. In an attempt to sell more records in the age of [[downloading]] the album was partly released through the grocery store chain [[Coop Norge]] whereby its members could buy the album at a reduced price. The gimmick paid off, securing a sale of over 100.000 copies in its first week of release alone, of which 60.000 were sold in Coop stores.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://e24.no/eksklusiv/livsstil/article3382766.ece |title=Monstersalg for Sissel og Odd ( E24 Eksklusiv , Livsstil ) |publisher=E24.no |access-date=2010-12-14}}</ref> With the album selling well in both Norway and Sweden, it was released in Denmark on December 1, 2009. It was revealed by the end of 2009 that this album was the best selling album of the 2000s in Norway, selling 400,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/article459368.ece |title=Mannen med gullplatene : Dagsavisen |publisher=Dagsavisen.no |access-date=2010-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902053201/http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/article459368.ece |archive-date=2010-09-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Controversy==
In the autumn of 2006, Odd Nordstoga was the cause of a controversy between the Norwegian national broadcaster NRK, his management, Universal Records and the producers and cast of Norwegian-Swedish folk music adaptation of the [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] piece ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (''Tryllefløyten''). Nordstoga, having played [[Papageno]] in the piece in the spring of 2006, withdrew from the plans to show the stage adaptation on NRK TV during Christmas 2006. According to Nordstoga's management and label, a screening of the play at this time would collide with Nordstoga's two album releases of 2006 and overexpose him. The result was a massive outburst from some of his contemporaries in the Norwegian folk music scene, most prominently the folk singer [[Kirsten Bråten Berg]]. In the media, Nordstoga was portrayed as the villain, letting his personal career interfere with the ensemble of which he was part. In later interviews, Nordstoga claims to have been very sad about the situation and felt trapped by his obligations toward his recording company.

==Crossover==
Odd Nordstoga has showed remarkable [[crossover (music)|crossover]] potential in his career. He has collaborated with leading Norwegian artists and musicians from a wide variety of genres including [[folk music]], [[jazz]], [[electronica]], [[chanson]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[classical music]] and [[pop music|pop]]. In addition to this, Nordstoga has shown that he is a "[[jack of all trades, master of none|jack-of-all-trades]]" within the cultural field having performed in and helped writing [[cabaret]]s, [[opera]], edited books and acted in a film.

==International career==
Nordstoga is for the most part famous within Norway. However, together with [[Rikskonsertene]], he carried out a tour of China in 2008. In concurrence with the release of the Christmas album ''Strålande Jul'' he toured Sweden as well as appearing on Norwegian-Swedish talkshow ''[[Skavlan]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCw068hiR4g |title=Sissel Kyrkjebø og Odd Nordstoga - Upp gläd er alla (Skavlan, 2009) |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2010-12-14}}</ref> The album peaked at #17 in the Swedish Charts.<ref name="swedishcharts1">{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://www.swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sissel+og+Odd&titel=Str%E5lande+jul&cat=a |title=Sissel og Odd - Strålande jul |publisher=swedishcharts.com |access-date=2010-12-14}}</ref> The album will also be released in Denmark.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

==Dialect==
Being from Vinje in the traditional district of [[Vest-Telemark]], Nordstoga writes and performs most of his original work in his native [[Telemark dialect]]. He also speaks the dialect privately and in the media. This has become a [[trademark]] for him and gained him respect from language organizations, as well as parodies and, to a small extent, ridicule from parts of the population without a distinct dialect. He was awarded the Telemark County Travel Industry Award for 2010 for using his dialect to promote the county of Telemark in a positive way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ta.no/pulsen/article5084408.ece |title=Dialektambassadør fikk reiselivsprisen |language=nb |publisher=www.ta.no |date=2010-05-24 |access-date=2010-12-14}}</ref>
