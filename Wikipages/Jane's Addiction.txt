'''Jane's Addiction''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from Los Angeles, formed in 1985. The band consists of vocalist [[Perry Farrell]], guitarist [[Dave Navarro]], drummer [[Stephen Perkins]] and bassist [[Chris Chaney]].

Founded by Farrell and original bass guitarist [[Eric Avery]] following the disintegration of Farrell's previous band [[Psi Com]], Jane's Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s [[alternative rock]] movement to gain both mainstream media attention and commercial success in the United States. Jane's Addiction's first release was a [[Jane's Addiction (album)|self-titled live album]] in 1987 and quickly caught the attention of [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The band's first two studio albums, ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' (1988) and ''[[Ritual de lo Habitual]]'' (1990), were released to widespread critical acclaim, and an increasing [[cult following|cult]] fanbase. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the "Alternative Nation".<ref>di Perna, Alan. "Brave Noise–The History of Alternative Rock Guitar". ''Guitar World''. December 1995.</ref> The band's initial farewell tour, in 1991, launched the first [[Lollapalooza]], which has since become a perennial alternative rock festival.

The band briefly reunited in 1997, with [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] replacing Avery on bass guitar. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with [[Martyn LeNoble]]—and later Chris Chaney—occupying the role of bass guitarist. In 2003, the band released its third studio album, ''[[Strays (Jane's Addiction album)|Strays]]'', before dissolving again the following year.

In 2008, the band's original line-up reunited and embarked on a world tour. Eric Avery, however, subsequently left the band in early 2010 as the group began working on new material. The band released its fourth studio album ''[[The Great Escape Artist]]'' in 2011, with Chaney returning to the band for its recording and subsequent tour, and featured the [[TV on the Radio]]'s multi-instrumentalist [[Dave Sitek]]. In 2016, Jane's Addiction were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==History==
===Formation and ''Jane's Addiction'' (1985–1987)===
Jane's Addiction formed from the remains of frontman [[Perry Farrell]]'s previous band, [[Psi Com]]. In mid-1985, Farrell was searching for a bassist to replace Kelly Wheeler in the faltering Psi-com. He was introduced to [[Eric Avery]] by [[Carla Bozulich]] (later of [[The Geraldine Fibbers]]), and the pair bonded over a mutual appreciation of [[Joy Division]] and [[The Velvet Underground]]. They began to practice together, although Avery never became a full-fledged member of Farrell's disintegrating group.<ref>Mullen, Brendan. ''Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane's Jaddiction''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2005. {{ISBN|0-306-81347-5}}, p. 48</ref>

The new band was dubbed "Jane's Addiction" in honor of Farrell's housemate, Jane Bainter, who was their [[muse]] and inspiration.<ref name='Mullen'>{{cite book | last1 = Mullen | first1 = Brendan | author-link1 = Brendan Mullen | title = Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane's Jaddiction | chapter = Jane Bainter, First Lady of Wilton House | publisher = Da Capo Press | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LT9JVbq8L_4C&q=jane+bainter&pg=PA26 | access-date = September 28, 2012 | isbn = 0306814781 | year = 2006}}</ref> "My girlfiend ''[Casey Niccoli]'' and I were sitting in the car…" Farrell recalled, "and we started to think about band names. She threw in Jane's Heroin Experience. I thought it wasn't vague enough. If you want to invite people in, you don't want to put heroin on your door."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= James |last= Halbert |title= Nasty habits |magazine= [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue= 30 |date= August 2001 |page= 54}}</ref>

In its formative incarnation, Jane's Addiction went through four guitarists and featured Matt Chaikin, formerly of [[Kommunity FK]], on drums.<ref>Mullen, p. 54</ref>

After Chaikin failed to show up for rehearsals, Farrell sought a new drummer. Avery's younger sister Rebecca suggested her boyfriend [[Stephen Perkins]]. Avery was uncertain because of their differing tastes in music, but eventually relented.<ref>Mullen, p. 75–76</ref> After Perkins was hired, the drummer and Rebecca promised to get their friend [[Dave Navarro]] into the group. Based on Perkins' recommendation, the band auditioned and hired Navarro.<ref>Mullen, p. 77–78</ref>

Jane's Addiction became a sensation on the Los Angeles club scene, primarily headlining at [[Scream (music club)|Scream]], and won interest from a variety of record labels. While the group decided to sign with [[Warner Bros. Records]], they insisted on releasing their debut on [[independent record label]] [[Triple X Records]] first.<ref>Mullen, p. 113–15</ref> The band's manager negotiated the largest advance up to that point, with Warner Bros. signing the band for between $250,000 to $300,000.<ref>Mullen, p. 118</ref> In January 1987, the band recorded its debut ''[[Jane's Addiction (album)|Jane's Addiction]]'' during a performance at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]], at a cost of $4,000.<ref>Mullen, p. 119–21</ref> Before the album's release, Jane's Addiction supported British band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]] on a two-month tour in late 1987.<ref>Mullen, p. 158</ref> In late 1987, the band opened for former Bauhaus vocalist [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] at the now demolished Fender's Ballroom in Long Beach.

===''Nothing's Shocking'' (1988–1989)===
In January 1988, Jane's Addiction went into the studio to record its major label debut and follow-up to ''Jane's Addiction'', ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]''. Warner Bros. gave Jane's Addiction a list of producers to choose from, but the group chose [[Dave Jerden]].<ref>Mullen, p. 165</ref>

''Nothing's Shocking'' was released in 1988. "Mountain Song" was released as a single; MTV refused to air the song's music video because of a scene containing full frontal nudity.<ref>Mullen, p. 179</ref> Farrell then decided to release the music video commercially with added live footage to create the ''Soul Kiss'' home video.<ref>Mullen, p. 180</ref> Because of lack of airplay on MTV and [[modern rock]] radio, the album only sold 200,000 to 250,000 copies in its first year of release.<ref>Mullen, p. 190</ref>

After the album's release, the band went on tour, opening for [[Iggy Pop]] and The [[Ramones]]. By the end of the tour, Jane's Addiction was headlining clubs and theaters.

During the recording sessions, Farrell stated he wanted 50% of the band's publishing royalties for writing the lyrics, plus a quarter of the remaining half for writing music, adding up to 62.5%. Bassist [[Eric Avery]] said he and the other members – guitarist [[Dave Navarro]] and drummer [[Stephen Perkins]] – were stunned by these demands.<ref>Mullen, p. 166</ref> Farrell refused to compromise. One day Jerden drove to the studio to find Farrell, Navarro, and Perkins leaving; Farrell told him the band had broken up and there would be no record. Warner Bros. called an emergency meeting to resolve the situation. Farrell received the percentage he sought, and the other members received 12.5 percent each. Avery said the incident had a profound effect on the band, creating an internal fracture.<ref>Mullen, p. 168</ref>

Not long after the royalties dispute, Farrell and Avery – who had cofounded the band – had a falling-out. This was the result of Avery's newfound sobriety as well as an incident in which Farrell believed Avery had drunkenly tried to pick up his girlfriend. "Unfortunately," Farrell recalled, "the tensions between Eric and I affected the whole family. Some people were asked to take sides, and others just moped about because they didn't know what was going on."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= James |last= Halbert |title= Nasy habits |magazine= [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue= 30 |date= August 2001 |page= 58}}</ref> Perkins, however, is reported to have got along with Navarro, Avery and Farrell.<ref>Mullen, p. 169–71</ref>

===''Ritual de lo Habitual'' and first breakup (1989–1991)===
Jane's Addiction was scheduled to begin recording its next album in mid-1989. Navarro later stated he had almost no recollection of working on the album due to his addiction to heroin.<ref>Mullen, p. 201–02</ref> ''[[Ritual de lo Habitual]]'' was released in 1990. To support it, the band embarked on a lengthy tour. Farrell recalled, "That thirteen-month tour behind ''Ritual'' was half the reason we wound up unable to stand one another. The other half is that I am an intolerable narcissist who can't get along with anyone."<ref>Mullen, p. 218</ref>

Part of the tour included headlining the first [[Lollapalooza]] festival, which traveled across North America in mid-1991. The festival, created by Farrell and Marc Geiger, was to become a farewell for Jane's Addiction, but also a showcase for other cult artists: [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], the [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Living Colour]], [[The Rollins Band]], [[The Violent Femmes]], and [[Ice-T]]'s [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]]. The headliners began to get more exposure than ever before: "[[Been Caught Stealing]]" and "[[Stop! (Jane's Addiction song)|Stop!]]" became hits and earned rotation on MTV. During the very first Lollapalooza show, Farrell and Navarro got into a fight onstage<ref>{{cite web|url=http://janesaddiction.org/tour/show/janes-addiction/1991-07-18/194/ |title=Tour Info: Jane's Addiction - July 18, 1991 - Compton Terrace Amphitheatre, Tempe, AZ |website=Janesaddiction.org |date=1991-07-18 |access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> after violently bumping each other mid-song. The band walked off, but came back to play an [[encore (concert)|encore]]; however, the fight continued and Navarro eventually threw his guitar into the crowd. Regardless, the band continued the tour and played about 25 more Lollapalooza shows, frequently covering [[Sly and the Family Stone]]'s "[[Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey]]" with Ice-T and Body Count.

Differences between the members on the issue of drug use on the "Ritual" tour led to a schism: Farrell and Perkins regularly partook, while Avery and Navarro abstained. According to ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' (1991, Vol. 7 Num. 3), between shows, Avery and Navarro sought to avoid temptation by retiring to a section of the tour bus set aside for them. After shows, Avery and Navarro (and Navarro's wife at the time, Tanya) would retire to their hotel. "They have," said ''Spin'', "simply learned that they cannot use drugs of any kind anymore without becoming slaves to them, and that slavery is death."

In late 1991, Avery told Navarro that he planned to leave. Navarro quickly agreed to do the same. The two told their management, who in turn tried to convince them to play in Japan, but Avery and Navarro only wanted to play as much as was contractually obligated. The band played its last shows in Australia and Hawaii before disbanding.<ref>Mullen, p. 239–40</ref> "It's weird to be at the end of a cycle like that," remarked Avery, "having run the gamut of the usual 'rock story' from beginning to end: you get signed, get strung out, break up."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= James |last= Halbert |title= Nasy habits |magazine= [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue= 30 |date= August 2001 |page= 60}}</ref>

===First reunion and ''Kettle Whistle'' (1997)===
Dave Navarro joined the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] in 1993 (he would be fired in 1998) and during a hiatus for the band, Navarro along with Chili Peppers's [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] joined Porno for Pyros to record "Hard Charger" in 1997 for Howard Stern's movie, ''Private Parts'' soundtrack. This led to a brief Jane's Addiction Relapse tour, with Flea replacing Avery who declined an invitation to rejoin the band. They produced a compilation album titled ''[[Kettle Whistle]]'' featuring two new songs with Flea on bass. In 2010, Perkins stated that "Flea, to me, was a great match in '97. As a drummer, he was very exciting for me to work with."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/janes-addictions-stephen-perkins-on-duff-mckagan-band-future-243049/2|title=Jane's Addiction's Stephen Perkins on Duff McKagan, band future|author=Joe Bosso|publisher=MusicRadar}}</ref>

===''Strays'' (2001–2004)===
"I got a phone call from a promoter who asked me if I would be interested in re-forming the band for the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella festival]] in LA," said Farrell in 2001, "and taking the band on tour after that... This comes at a time when this record ''[his solo album'' [[Song Yet to Be Sung]]'']'' is about to be plucked. Steve ''[Perkins]'' played on three of the songs, and Dave ''[Navarro]'' played with Steve on the single. So there are plans for Jane's' summer tour."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Chris |last= Ingham |title= Breaking the habit |magazine= [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue= 30 |date= August 2001 |page= 62}}</ref>

The consequent 2001 [[Jubilee 2000|Jubilee]] Tour featured largely the classics, alongside "Hungry" from Navarro's ''[[Trust No One (Dave Navarro album)|Trust No One]]'' and "Happy Birthday Jubilee" from ''Song Yet to Be Sung''. Fans were told to expect a "Sexual Psycho Circus... half-naked, penny rafters, guitar solos, and tribal drums..." Indeed, during '[[Classic Girl]]', scantily clad stage dancers filled the arenas. Avery declined to be involved. Since Flea was busy with the Chili Peppers, Porno for Pyros bassist [[Martyn LeNoble]] was enlisted. (Fellow Pyros member [[Peter DiStefano]] guested at one show, to play "[[Pets (song)|Pets]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://janesaddiction.org/tour/show/janes-addiction/2001-10-27/54/|title=Jane's Addiction - October 27, 2001 - Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA|website=Janesaddiction.org|access-date=June 19, 2021}}</ref>)

Following the success of this tour, the band decided to record a follow-up album to ''Ritual De Lo Habitual'' and tapped [[Chris Chaney]] to replace LeNoble on bass. They entered the studio with producer [[Bob Ezrin]] in 2001, recording as a band for the first time in over 10 years. The result was a fourth album, ''[[Strays (Jane's Addiction album)|Strays]].'' Some of the songs (or parts of songs) dated far back in the band's history, while others were new. Reaction was generally favorable,<ref>

The band spent 2003 on an extensive worldwide tour in support of ''Strays'', including a summer headliner slot in a reincarnated Lollapalooza U.S. tour. Following this homecoming of sorts, Jane's Addiction once again broke up towards the end of 2003 after canceling several dates. Although details surrounding the band's demise are sparse, Navarro claimed on his website,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.6767.com|title=6767|access-date=July 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804083014/http://6767.com/|archive-date=August 4, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> in June 2004, that the reasons were essentially the same as they were in 1991. Perkins later stated, "We always break up if it's not real. We really can't fake it… We can make a million dollars for three months touring but we would fucking hate each other, which isn't good. Even with the nostalgia, it's not worth it if it doesn't sound good, or look good. One of the things with Jane's is that we have never been good at faking it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stereogum.com/812261/progress-report-janes-addiction/franchises/progress-report/ |title=Progress Report: Jane's Addiction |website=Stereogum |date=September 15, 2011 |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

A hits album – ''[[Up from the Catacombs – The Best of Jane's Addiction]]'' – was released on September 19, 2006.

===Return of Eric Avery and NIN/JA Tour (2008–2010)===

Jane's Addiction performed at the first-ever [[NME Awards]] USA on April 23, 2008, with the reunited core line-up of Perry Farrell, Dave Navarro, Eric Avery, and Stephen Perkins. This was the first performance with bassist Eric Avery since 1991, taking place after their acceptance speech for the "Godlike Genius Award". To follow this up, the original line up performed their first full set in 17 years in Los Angeles on October 23, 2008 at La Cita Bar, and played two further club gigs at the El Cid in Los Angeles on November 20.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vanessa |url=http://www.janesaddiction.com/ |title=Janesaddiction.com |access-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref> and the Echoplex on February 16, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webinfront.net/?p=1808 |title=Concert Review: Jane's Addiction @ the Echoplex (2.16.09) |publisher=Webinfront.net |access-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref> On April 11, 2009 they had a birthday bash for Perry that included members of Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros on the same stage; the bash was nicknamed Perrypalooza.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkz2BO9847Y perrypalooza 'cool crowd singing happy b-day to perry' April 11, 2009] – YouTube</ref>

Around this time, photos of Farrell, Navarro, Avery and Perkins, taken by [[Trent Reznor]], appeared on [[Nine Inch Nails]]' official web site, leading to speculation that Reznor could be helping Jane's Addiction record new material.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vanessa |url=http://www.janesaddiction.com |title=Janes Addiction – "The Great Escape Artist" The new album coming August 2011 |publisher=Janesaddiction.com |access-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref> "He did his best to be both producer and psychologist," Farrell said, in a ''Billboard'' report about tension between himself and Avery. "He was very respectful, trying to get out of the way and not overproduce. I wish honestly he would've produced a little more, but he was a little gun-shy after seeing us explode on each other in the studio. He became the referee for a day and after that day I think he was done."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268858/janes-addiction-reunion-marred-by-feuds|title=Jane's Addiction Reunion Marred By Feuds|website=Billboard}}</ref> Nonetheless, Reznor subsequently posted a blog entry announcing that Jane's Addiction would accompany Nine Inch Nails on their summer 2009 tour, which kicked off on May 8 in West Palm Beach, Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nin.com/?%3F |title=the official nine inch nails website |publisher=Nin.com |access-date=May 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606101543/http://www.nin.com/?%3F |archive-date=June 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

To accompany the tour, newly recorded versions of "Trip Away" and "Whores" were released for free via the official tour website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninja2009.com/ |title=nin.com [the official nine inch site website |publisher=Ninja2009.com |access-date=May 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65INDh3Wf?url=http://ninja2009.com/ |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Farrell explained: "To get some creative juice flowing, we went into the studio for about two weeks. We had the idea to re-record two tunes, just because they'd never been done officially in the studio. And we had some fun writing some new things. A handful that are close to finished, but not quite done. But there's no rush to put anything out at this point."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269166/janes-addiction-drops-two-free-new-trent-reznor-produced-tracks|title=Jane's Addiction Drops Two Free New Trent Reznor-Produced Tracks|work=Billboard }}</ref> Navarro blogged: "We wanted to give our longtime listeners something to celebrate the tour and 'Whores' has always been one of the tracks that defined Jane's early on."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.6767.com/ |title=Dave Navarro, ''A Couple PH Questions Answered'' |access-date=July 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804083014/http://6767.com/ |archive-date=August 4, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A retrospective box set, ''[[A Cabinet of Curiosities]]'', was released to coincide with the NIN/JA tour in April 2009.

In July 2009, Jane's Addiction was scheduled to play the [[Splendour in the Grass]] festival in Australia when a health issue forced a last-minute cancellation.<ref name="Jane's Addiction cancel Australian show/s">{{cite web|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/rumour-janes-addiction-to-cancel-australian-tour-due-to-arm-infection|title=Jane's Addiction cancel Splendour appearance, possibly entire Australian tour|date=July 23, 2009|publisher=MusicFeeds}}</ref> [[Music Feeds]] reports that an arm infection, probably that of drummer Stephen Perkins, is the cause of the cancellation.

Talking about ''[[Ritual de lo habitual]]'', [[Alice Cooper]] remarked, "I can spot traces of other people on this album, [[Alice Cooper (band)|us]] included, but that's all they are: traces. They were a really original band. This is their peak album, where they really went out on a limb. Sometimes I get so caught up in these songs, I can actually feel the band pushing themselves to their limits. Sometimes I can't believe how strong it is. I wonder if this will have the same effect on some kid as [[Chuck Berry]] had on me&nbsp;..."<ref>''[[Melody Maker]]'', June 18, 1994</ref>

"''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' influenced me a lot, especially with what Eric Avery proposed from the bass," says [[Nick Oliveri]], of [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[Kyuss]] and [[Mondo Generator]]. "Eric had written the music on his own, the guitars and the drums came later. So he inspired me on that side, it is very possible that they were the first really alternative band."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.periodismo.com/2019/03/07/el-ritual-de-janes-addiction-de-fabrizio-pedrotti/|title=Adelanto de "El ritual de Jane's Addiction", de Fabrizio Pedrotti|website=Periodismo.com|date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>

Not all their contemporaries were impressed, however. "People can't be looking at things like Jane's Addiction as some sort of alternative," complained [[Sugar (American band)|Sugar]] bassist [[David Barbe]]. "It's just corporate dick rock. It's [[Van Halen]] with different makeup artists."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=David|last=Cavanagh|title=Sidewalking|magazine=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|date=July 1993|page=72}}</ref>

==Side projects==
=== Porno for Pyros ===
The band members pursued other projects in the 1990s. Farrell and Perkins formed another band, [[Porno for Pyros]], and had some success with their two albums, ''[[Porno for Pyros (album)|Porno for Pyros]]'' (1993) and ''[[Good God's Urge]]'' (1996); meanwhile, Avery and Navarro formed [[Deconstruction (band)|Deconstruction]] and put out a self-titled one-off album in 1994. [[Dave Navarro]] joined the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] in 1993 and in the same year [[New York Electric Piano|Stephen Perkins]] started a band named [[Banyan (band)|Banyan]], with core members [[Nels Cline]], [[Mike Watt]], and [[Willie Waldman]] (with revolving studio guests). Banyan have released three albums as of 2008, their self titled-debut, ''[[Any Time at All]]'' and ''Live at Perkins Place''.

=== Others ===
During their second major split, the band were involved in a number of other projects. Navarro, Perkins, and Chaney formed a new band, [[The Panic Channel]], with singer [[Steve Isaacs]], who together released one album, titled ''[[(ONe)]]'', in 2006. Perry Farrell, together with his wife Etty Lau Farrell and [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] guitarist [[Nuno Bettencourt]], formed [[Satellite Party]]. The band signed with [[Columbia Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[Ultra Payloaded]]'' in 2007. [[Eric Avery]] signed with [[Dangerbird Records]] for the release of his solo album ''[[Help Wanted (Eric Avery album)|Help Wanted]]'' in 2008.
