With the release of her debut Japanese studio album, ''[[Listen to My Heart (BoA album)|Listen to My Heart]]'' (2002), BoA became the first South Korean pop star to break through in Japan following the fall of barriers that had restricted the import and export of entertainment between the countries since the end of [[World War II]].<ref name="JPTIMES"/> She is the only foreign artist to have three albums sell more than one million copies in Japan and is one of only three female artists to have six consecutive number-one studio albums on the [[Oricon]] charts since her debut, with the others being J-pop singers [[Ayumi Hamasaki]] and [[Utada Hikaru]] respectively.

==Career==
=== 2000–2003: Debut and commercial success in South Korea and Japan ===
At age eleven, BoA accompanied her older brother to an SM Entertainment talent search. Though her brother was the one who auditioned as a break-dancer,<ref name="JPTIMES" /> SM [[talent scouts]] instead took notice of BoA and offered her a contract on the same night as the auditions.<ref name="JPTIMES" /> Her parents initially opposed the notion of BoA leaving school to enter the entertainment business but eventually consented at her older brothers' persuasion.<ref name="CNNinterview" /> She has said that her early influence as a singer was [[Seo Taiji]].<ref name="JPTIMES" />

BoA underwent two years of training (involving vocal, dance, English, and Japanese lessons), and at the age of thirteen released her debut album ''[[ID; Peace B]]'' in South Korea on August 25, 2000. The album was moderately successful; it entered the Top 10 of the South Korean charts and sold around 156,000 units.<ref name="MTVK">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvk.com/news/story.jhtml?id=1535149|title=The first video on MTV K: BoA "My Name"|date=June 26, 2006|publisher=[[MTV K]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705043754/http://www.mtvk.com/news/story.jhtml?id=1535149|archive-date=July 5, 2006|access-date=September 29, 2008}}</ref> Meanwhile, her Korean record label, SM Entertainment, made arrangements with Japanese label [[Avex Trax]] to launch her music career in Japan.

==Impact==

Dubbed the "Queen of [[K-pop]]", BoA is considered one of this century's top artists in East Asia; her popularity in the latter is attributed to her linguistic skills (she speaks and records in Japanese, Korean, and English) and a Japanese [[Korean Wave|interest in Korean pop culture]] started in the early 2000s when the two countries began promoting cultural exchanges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20040407a1.html|title=Korean love story heats up Japan|author=Setsuko Kamiya|date=April 7, 2004|work=[[The Japan Times]]|publisher=The Japan Times Ltd.|access-date=August 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20020419b9.html|title=Language, music point way to stronger relations|author=Hiroshi Matsubara|date=April 19, 2002|work=[[The Japan Times]]|publisher=The Japan Times Ltd.|access-date=August 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20010411a1.html|title=K-pop, ya don't stop|author=Mauymi Saito|date=April 11, 2001|work=[[The Japan Times]]|publisher=The Japan Times Ltd.|access-date=August 13, 2008}}</ref> BoA's popularity extends throughout [[East Asia]]; she has fans in [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]]. She had expressed plans to enter a global market; in June 2006, the music video of her Korean song "My Name" became the first music video ever shown on [[MTV K]], an [[MTV]] music channel directed at [[Korean American]]s.<ref name="MTVK" />

Though her earlier releases were marked by a "cute" and "youthful" style, BoA began to present a more "mature" image starting from the album ''My Name''. In a ''[[Talk Asia]]'' interview, [[Anjali Rao]] noted that some felt that ''My Name'' marked the beginning of BoA's decline in popularity and asked if the public would always see the singer as "Little Baby BoA"; BoA replied, "So while I apologize to those people who still want the baby BoA, in fact, what can I do? I just keep growing up! I can't stop that from happening."<ref name="CNNinterview" />
