'''Caetano Emanuel Viana Telles Veloso''' ({{IPA-pt|kaeˈtɐ̃nu emɐnuˈɛw viˈɐ̃nɐ ˈtɛliz veˈlozu}}; born August 7, 1942) is a [[Brazil]]ian composer, singer, guitarist, writer, and political activist. Veloso first became known for his participation in the Brazilian musical movement [[Tropicália|Tropicalismo]], which encompassed theatre, poetry and music in the 1960s, at the beginning of the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|Brazilian military dictatorship]] that [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|took power]] in 1964. He has remained a constant creative influence and best-selling performing artist and composer ever since. Veloso has won nine [[Latin Grammy Awards]] and two [[Grammy Awards]]. On November 14, [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2012|2012]], Veloso was honored as the [[Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year]].<ref name="grammy.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204701/http://www.grammy.com/news/caetano-veloso-named-latin-recording-academy-person-of-the-year

Veloso was one of seven children born into the family of José Telles Velloso (commonly known as ''Seu Zeca''), a government official, and [[Dona Canô|Claudionor Viana Telles Veloso]] (known as ''Dona Canô'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iurirubim.blog.terra.com.br/2009/03/20/ba-aos-101-anos-d-cano-velloso-publica-livro-de-memorias/|title=BA: Aos 101 anos, D.

Soon after that, Veloso won a music contest and was signed to his first label. He became one of the founders of [[Tropicália|Tropicalismo]] with a group of several other musicians and artists—including his sister [[Maria Bethânia]]—in the same period. However the Brazilian military dictatorship viewed Veloso's music and political action as threatening, and he was arrested, along with fellow musician [[Gilberto Gil]], in 1969. The two eventually were exiled from Brazil and went to London where they lived for two years. In 1972, Veloso moved back to his home country and once again began recording and performing. He later became popular outside Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Biography ==
{{listen|filename=O Leãozinho.ogg|title="O Leãozinho"|description=A 19-second sample of "O Leãozinho", a song recorded relatively early in Veloso's career.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Veloso was born in [[Santo Amaro, Bahia|Santo Amaro da Purificação]], Bahia, Brazil, the fifth of seven children of José Teles Veloso (1901–1983) and Claudionor Viana Teles Veloso (1907–2012). His childhood was influenced greatly by artistic endeavors: he was interested in both literature and filmmaking as a child, but focused mainly on music. The musical style of [[bossa nova]] and [[João Gilberto]], one of its most prominent exponents, were major influences on Veloso's music as he grew up.<ref name=manning>{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Manning |title=The Life of Caetano Veloso |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/veloso/biography.html |work=[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|Online NewsHour]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |access-date=March 22, 2008 }}</ref> Veloso was 17&nbsp;years old when he first heard Gilberto, whom he describes as his "supreme master".<ref name=gross>{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Gross |author-link=Terry Gross |author2=Veloso, Caetano |title=Brazilian Songwriter Caetano Veloso |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=873042 |format=radio |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=December 10, 2002 |access-date=May 16, 2008 }}</ref> He recognizes Gilberto's contribution to Brazilian music as new—"illuminating" the tradition of Brazilian music and paving the way for future innovation.<ref name=gross/> Veloso moved to the Bahian port city of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] as a teenager, the city in which Gilberto lived, and a center of [[Afro-Brazilian]] culture and music.<ref>Wald (2007), p. 118.</ref>

In 1965, Veloso moved again to [[Rio de Janeiro]], with his sister [[Maria Bethânia]], also a musician. Shortly after the move, Veloso won a [[lyrics]] contest for his composition "Um Dia" and was signed to [[Philips Records]].<ref name=amg/> On October 21, 1967, Veloso won fourth prize and gained a standing ovation at the third annual Brazil Popular Music Festival with his song "Alegria, Alegria". on which he was backed by [[São Paulo]] group Beat Boys; along with the performance of his friend [[Gilberto Gil]], who was backed by psychedelic band [[Os Mutantes]], this marked the first time that rock bands had performed at the festival. During this period, Veloso, Bethânia, [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Tom Zé]], and [[Os Mutantes]] developed "[[Tropicalia|Tropicalismo]]", which fused Brazilian pop with [[rock and roll]] and [[avant-garde]] music. Veloso describes the movement as a wish to be different - not "defensive" like the right-wing [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|Brazilian military government]], which vehemently opposed the movement. Although Gil and Veloso's performances at the 1967 MBP Festival were rapturously received, within a year, Tropicalismo had become a deeply divisive issue among Brazil's youth audience, with Marxist-influenced college students of the Brazilian left wing condemning Tropicalismo, because they believed it commercialized Brazilian traditional music by incorporating musical influence from other cultures, specifically the United States.<ref name=gross/>

The musical manifesto of the Tropicalist movement was the landmark collaborative LP ''[[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis]]'' ("Tropicalia: or Bread and Circuses"), issued in mid-1968, which brought together the talents of Veloso, [[Os Mutantes]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Tom Zé]] and [[Gal Costa]], with arrangements by avant-garde composer-arranger [[Rogerio Duprat]] (who had studied with [[Pierre Boulez]]) and lyrical contributions from poet [[Torquato Neto]]. The album's group cover photograph depicted the collective holding a variety of objects and images, in a deliberate reference to the cover of The Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.
[[File:Caetano Veloso no III Festival da Música Popular.tif|thumb|Caetano Veloso at the III Popular Music Festival, 1967. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil]].]]
The tensions between the ''Tropicalistas'' and the student left peaked in September 1968 with Veloso's now-legendary performances at the third annual International Song Festival, held at the Catholic University in Rio, where the audience included a large contingent of students who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalistas. When Veloso (backed by Os Mutantes) performed in the first round of the Festival's song competition on September 12, he was initially greeted with enthusiastic applause, but the situation soon turned ugly. Dressed in a shiny green plastic suit, festooned with electrical wires and necklaces strung with animal teeth, Veloso provoked the students with his lurid costume, his sensual body movements and his startling new psychedelic music, and the performers were soon being bombarded with loud insults, jeers and boos from the students, who became even more incensed when American pop singer John Dandurand made a surprise appearance on stage during the song.

The ideological conflict climaxed three days later on September 15 when Veloso returned for the second round of the competition, performing a specially-written new song entitled "É Proibido Proibir" ("It is Forbidden to Forbid"). The leftist students began hissing and booing as soon as Veloso's name was announced, and when he began his performance, his overtly sexual stage moves and the experimental music of Os Mutantes again provoked a wild reaction – the students began booing so loudly that the performers could barely be heard, and a section of the crowd then stood up and turned their backs to the stage, prompting Os Mutantes to turn their backs on the audience. As the performance continued, the students pelted the stage with fruit, vegetables, eggs, paper balls and anything else that came to hand. Veloso then stopped singing and launched into an impassioned monologue, in which he excoriated the students for their conservatism. After being joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support, Veloso finished his diatribe by telling the students "...if you are the same in politics as you are in aesthetics, we’re done for!" and declaring he would no longer compete in music festivals. He then deliberately finished the song out of tune, angrily shouted "Enough!" and walked off arm-in-arm with Gil and Os Mutantes. A studio version of the song was later released as a single, and the closing section of the tumultuous live performance featuring Veloso's speech, was issued as the single's B-side.<ref>Victoria Langland, "Il est Interdit d’Interdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil", ''Estudios Interdisciplinarios de América Latina y el Caribe'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006).</ref> [103] Even though Tropicalismo was controversial among traditional critics, it introduced to [[Música popular brasileira]] new elements for making music with an eclectic style.<ref name=schnabel>{{cite book |last=Schnabel |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Schnabel |title=Rhythm Planet: The Great World Music Makers |url=https://archive.org/details/rhythmplanetgrea00schn |url-access=registration |year=1998 |publisher=Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-7893-0238-1}}</ref>

Veloso studied philosophy at the [[Universidade Federal da Bahia]],<ref name=manning/> which influenced both his artistic expression and viewpoint on life. Two of his favorite philosophers were [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref name=schnabel/> Veloso's leftist political stance earned him the enmity of Brazil's military dictatorship which ruled until 1985; his songs were frequently censored and some banned.  Veloso and Gil were both arrested in February 1969 and held in prison for three months, followed by a further four months under house arrest; they were eventually released on condition that they leave the country, and spent the next few years in [[exile]]. He said that "they didn't imprison us for any song or any particular thing that we said," ascribing the government's reaction to its unfamiliarity with the cultural phenomenon of Tropicália—they seemed to say "We might as well put them in prison."<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Pareles |author-link=Jon Pareles |title=At Lunch with Caetano Veloso; Lots of Rebellion and a Little Hot Sauce For the Spirited Bob Dylan of Brazil |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF113FF93AA3575AC0A964958260 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 9, 1992 |access-date=May 16, 2008 }}</ref> The federal police detained the two and flew them to an unknown destination. Finally, Veloso and Gil lived out their exile in London, England. When Caetano was asked about his experience there he says, "London felt dark, and I felt far away from myself." Nevertheless, the two improved their music there and were asked to make a musical production with the producer Ralph Mace.<ref name=schnabel/>

Veloso's work upon his return in 1972 was often characterized by frequent merging not only of international styles but of Brazilian folkloric styles and rhythms as well. His popularity grew outside Brazil in the 1980s, especially in Greece, Portugal, France, and Africa. His records released in the United States, such as ''[[Estrangeiro]]'', helped gain him a larger audience.

To celebrate 25&nbsp;years of [[Tropicalismo]], Veloso and [[Gilberto Gil]] released a CD called ''Tropicalia 2'' in 1993.<ref name=behague>{{cite journal |last1=Béhague, Gerard |date=Spring–Summer 2006 |title=Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985–95) |journal=Latin American Music Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=79–90 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/latin_american_music_review/v027/27.1behague08.html |doi=10.1353/lat.2006.0021 |first1=Gerard. |s2cid=191430137 |author1-link=Béhague, Gerard }}</ref> One song, "Haiti", attracted people's attention during the time, especially because it included powerful statements about sociopolitical issues present in [[Haiti]] and also in Brazil.

In 2002 Veloso published an account of his early years and the Tropicalismo movement, ''Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil''.<ref>Veloso, ''Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2003.</ref>

His first all-English CD was ''A Foreign Sound'' (2004), which covers [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[Come As You Are (Nirvana song)|Come as You Are]]" and compositions from the [[Great American Songbook]] such as "[[Carioca (1933 song)|Carioca]]" (music by [[Vincent Youmans]] and lyrics by [[Edward Eliscu]] and [[Gus Kahn]]), "[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]" (music and lyrics by [[Irving Berlin]]), "[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]" (music by [[Richard Rodgers]] and lyrics by [[Lorenz Hart]]), "[[Love for Sale (song)|Love for Sale]]" (music and lyrics by [[Cole Porter]]), and "[[Something Good (Richard Rodgers song)|Something Good]]" (music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers). Six of the seven songs on his third [[eponym]]ous album, released in 1971, were also in English.

Veloso has contributed songs to two AIDS benefit compilation albums produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]: ''[[Red Hot + Rio]]'' (1996) and ''[[Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon]]'' (1998).

In 2011, he again contributed two songs to the Red Hot Organization's most recent compilation album, ''[[Red Hot + Rio 2]]''. The two tracks include a remix of "Terra" by [[Prefuse 73]] ("3 Mellotrons in a Quiet Room Version") and "Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses”, in collaboration with [[David Byrne]].

His September 2006 album, ''[[Cê]]'', was released by [[Nonesuch Records]] in the United States.

With a total of nine [[Latin Grammy Awards]] and two [[Grammy Awards]], Veloso has received more than any other Brazilian performer. On November 14, [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2012|2012]], Veloso was also honored as the [[Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year]].<ref name="grammy.com"/>

In January 2016, Caetano Veloso was a featured artist at the convention of the [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA), in [[Austin, Texas]]. Before a SRO crowd, he was interviewed on stage by two luminaries in the field of poetry and poetics, Marjorie Perloff (emerita Stanford) and Roland Greene (Stanford, President of MLA at the time). Most of the discussion concerned music, from rock 'n' roll and samba to experimental composition. Videos of the event should be posted at MLA's site and the Stanford Arcade site. He also performed "Isto aqui, o que é?" at the [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] along with singers [[Anitta (singer)|Anitta]] and [[Gilberto Gil]] after the parade of delegations in August 2016.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flores|first=Griselda|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7460998/anitta-rio-olympics-opening-ceremony-interview|title=Anitta 'Never Imagined' She'd Be Performing at Rio Olympics Opening Ceremony|date=August 3, 2016|access-date=August 6, 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Veloso married fellow Baiana and actress Andrea Gadelha (or Dedé) on November 21, 1967, in a ceremony that reflected the air of the counterculture era. Their son [[Moreno Veloso|Moreno]] was born on November 22, 1972. On January 7, 1979, their daughter Júlia was born 3 months premature; she died 11 days later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jornalggn.com.br/musica/em-1979-a-morte-de-julinha-filha-de-caetano-e-dede/|title=Em 1979, a morte de Julinha, filha de Caetano e Dedé|first=Luis|last=Nassif|website=Jornalggn.com|date=January 9, 2013}}</ref> Veloso's father died on December 13, 1983.

Veloso is one of the few public [[Atheism|atheist]] celebrities in Brazil. He was brought up in a religious [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family but left the faith early on. In an interview Veloso stated that he did not like to "lie to his own intelligence" by believing in God.<ref name=paulopes/> In a separate interview Veloso generated controversy when he said that Brazil would be better off if most people in the country were to become irreligious or atheist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Caetano Veloso sobre o ateísmo|publisher=Diário de uns ateus|url=http://www.diariodeunsateus.net/2009/12/13/caetano-veloso-sobre-o-ateismo/|date=13 December 2009|access-date=7 March 2019|language=pt}}</ref> Despite this, two of Veloso's sons have become members of the neo-Pentecostal [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], with Veloso attending his children's baptism, stating that "what is good for them is good for me."<ref name=paulopes>{{Cite web|title=Caetano Veloso, ateu famoso|url=https://www.paulopes.com.br/2012/01/caetano-veloso-ateu-famoso.html#.XIFox7gnYdU|date=5 January 2012|access-date=7 March 2019|language=pt|website=Paulopes.com.br}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Veloso's home, Bahia, has had a decisive role in his music. He praises Bahia for its importance in Brazil's colonial period—when the Portuguese first came—as well as for Bahia's contribution to Brazilian music.  He has cited among his musical influences [[Amália Rodrigues]], [[Cole Porter]], the [[Rolling Stones]] 1969 tour, and above all, [[João Gilberto]].

Veloso says that he is unable to make a comparison between his musical style in the 1960s, at the height of Tropicália, and his current work. He does note, however, that he has been able to accomplish music of a higher quality later in his career; that he is "better at everything."<ref name=gross/>
