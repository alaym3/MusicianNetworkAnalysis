'''Thursday''' is an American [[post-hardcore]] band, formed in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], in 1997. The band consists of [[Geoff Rickly]] (lead vocals), Tom Keeley (lead guitar, backing vocals), Steve Pedulla (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Tim Payne (bass), Andrew Everding (keyboards, backing vocals), and Tucker Rule (drums).

Thursday released their debut album, ''[[Waiting (Thursday album)|Waiting]]'', in late 1999 with original guitarist Bill Henderson, who left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Steve Pedulla. The band gained popularity with the release of their second album, ''[[Full Collapse]]'', in 2001, and released their third album and major label debut, ''[[War All the Time (Thursday album)|War All the Time]]'', in 2003, which reached number seven on the US [[Top 200 Albums|''Billboard'' Top 200 Albums]] chart. Thursday released their fourth album, ''[[A City by the Light Divided]]'', in 2006, and two further albums, ''[[Common Existence]]'' (2009) and ''[[No Devolución]]'' (2011), before announcing an indefinite hiatus in 2011. In a January 2013 interview, Geoff Rickly confirmed that the band had officially disbanded.<ref name="rochestercitynewspaper.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/rochester/music-interview-geoff-rickly/Content?oid=2182525|title=MUSIC INTERVIEW: Geoff Rickly|first=Frank De|last=Blase|website=City Newspaper}}</ref> However, the band announced a reunion in 2016 and performed a series of shows within the next few years.

==History==
===Formation and ''Waiting'' (1997–2000)===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Thursday was formed in 1997 by vocalist [[Geoff Rickly]], guitarist [[Tom Keeley]], guitarist Bill Henderson, bassist [[Tim Payne (musician)|Tim Payne]], and drummer [[Tucker Rule]]. The band began playing basement shows in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] and the surrounding New Jersey and New York areas, playing their first official show on December 31, 1998 in Rickly's basement alongside [[Midtown (band)|Midtown]], [[Saves the Day]] and [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]].

The band recorded [[Demo (music)|demo]]s to hand out at shows, and in the summer of 1999, teamed up with [[MP3.com]] for their first official release, the ''1999 Summer Tour EP'', which featured demos of songs that would soon be found on their debut album, ''[[Waiting (Thursday album)|Waiting]]''. The album was released on December 6, 1999 on northern New Jersey-based [[Eyeball Records]] without any singles or support from television or radio.

===''Full Collapse'' (2001–2002)===
In 2001, Thursday signed to independent label [[Victory Records]].<ref name=AMbio/> After signing, they were warned by their friends that they "gotten ourselves into a situation that we would regret".<ref name=PNstatement/> The group were unsure what they meant, but thought things would turn out fine due to their contract with the label. They initially thought that part of the contract meant they could sign with a different label would they want to. However, they realized the deal had in fact stated they could only leave Victory if it was to join a major label, which they thought was "a far-fetched idea to say the least."<ref name=PNstatement/> Later in the year, they released their second album ''[[Full Collapse]]'' through the label, eventually reaching number 178 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=AMbio/> Before appearing on [[Warped Tour]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://warpedtour.launch.com:80/artists_athletes.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010405004858/http://warpedtour.launch.com/artists_athletes.asp|title=Warped Tour 2001 Artists|work=Launch|publisher=Launch Media|archive-date=April 5, 2001|access-date=February 5, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> the group visited Victory's offices and learned about Thursday-branded [[whoopee cushions]] that the label was planning to sell at the tour. Vocalist [[Geoff Rickly]] discussed this matter with Victory founder Tony Brummel, and according to the band, responded that Victory "was a big company and that they didn't have time to run everything by the band."<ref name=PNstatement>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/3601/thursday-exposes-victory-officially-announces-island-signing|title=Thursday exposes Victory / officially announces Island signing!|work=Punknews.org|publisher=Aubin Paul|author=Heisel, Scott|date=May 22, 2002|access-date=February 5, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803215453/https://www.punknews.org/article/3601/thursday-exposes-victory-officially-announces-island-signing|archive-date=August 3, 2017}}</ref>

On a number of occasions, the group attempted to have better communication with the label in regards to promotion. On one occasion, Brummel informed them they were not living up to his expectations. Sometime afterwards, the group were touring with [[Saves the Day]]. Brummel became more positive in his interactions, frequently calling the band "just to say hello, or to ask how record sales at shows were going."<ref name=PNstatement/> The group were disappointed that his positivity "wasn't there from the beginning. ... Instead of Tony's relationship with us being based on a love for music, it was based entirely on numbers."<ref name=PNstatement/> The band's new-found popularity and disgust with the label led to internal problems, which almost led the band to disband. The situation caused the creation of the ''[[Five Stories Falling EP]]'', a release the band used to fulfill contractual obligations with Victory Records. At live shows, the band routinely told fans not to purchase the [[Extended play|EP]], but instead to download "Jet Black New Year", the only new studio recording found on the EP, with the rest consisting of live performances of four ''Full Collapse'' songs.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://angryape.com/interviews/2007/04/thursday| title=Thursday| access-date=May 26, 2008| publisher=AngryApe.com| date=March 2, 2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194803/http://angryape.com/interviews/2007/04/thursday| archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> While all the interactions with the label were occurring, the group were being contacted by major labels. The group, who "didn't understand [anything] about major labels", pondered about other independent labels they would join.<ref name=PNstatement/> However, due to their contract they wouldn't be allowed to move to another independent label. Throughout 2001, people from major label [[Island Records]] had been to the band's shows since they became a full-time touring act. Soon after, the label expressed interest in signing the band.<ref name=PNstatement/>

===''War All the Time'' (2003–2005)===
In late May 2002, the group announced they had signed to Island Records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kludgemagazine.com/news_archive.php?year=2002&month=05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305070736/http://kludgemagazine.com/news_archive.php?year=2002&month=05|title=Thursday to Island/Def Jam|work=Kludge|date=May 29, 2002|archive-date=March 5, 2008|access-date=February 4, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> following a bidding war between other major labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/features/music2002/n_7754/index3.html|title=They Will Rock You|work=New York|publisher=New York Media, LLC|date=2002|access-date=February 4, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528160711/http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/features/music2002/n_7754/index3.html|archive-date=May 28, 2008}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|In April 2002, it was reported that [[MCA Records]] acquired a 25% stake in Victory Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/3307/mca-acquires-25-of-victory-records|title=MCA acquires 25% of Victory Records|work=Punknews.org|publisher=Aubin Paul|author=White, Adam|date=April 17, 2002|access-date=February 4, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108175910/https://www.punknews.org/article/3307/mca-acquires-25-of-victory-records|archive-date=January 8, 2018}}</ref> In October of the same year, it was announced that the deal had fallen apart<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/4492/mca-victory-deal-falls-apart|title=MCA / Victory deal falls apart|work=Punknews.org|publisher=Aubin Paul|author=White, Adam|date=October 22, 2002|access-date=February 4, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403041542/http://www.punknews.org/article/4492/mca-victory-deal-falls-apart|archive-date=April 3, 2015}}</ref> when Thursday revealed they had signed to Island Records.<ref name=Billrages>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68866/thursdays-war-rages-on-island|title=Thursday's 'War' Rages On Island|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=October 1, 2003|access-date=February 4, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031003740/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68866/thursdays-war-rages-on-island|archive-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Up to this point, ''Full Collapse'' had sold 111,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75607/update-thursday-inks-with-island-def-jam|title=Update: Thursday Inks With Island Def Jam|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=May 30, 2002|access-date=February 5, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920173814/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75607/update-thursday-inks-with-island-def-jam|archive-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> On September 9, the group's signing to Island Records was made official following negotiations of an [[Termination of employment|exit agreement]] with Victory Records.

With expectation building for their follow-up album, Rickly wanted their next album to be "really aggressive and progressive ... and have all these boundary pushing ideas".<ref name=RYR/> In September and October, the group went on the Plea for Peace Tour,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/3914/tours-plea-for-peace-take-action-dates-with-bands|title=Plea For Peace / Take Action dates with bands!|work=Punknews.org|publisher=Aubin Paul|author=White, Adam|date=July 22, 2002|access-date=February 5, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825100450/http://www.punknews.org/article/3914/tours-plea-for-peace-take-action-dates-with-bands|archive-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> and were planning to work on their next album following its conclusion. They said they had accumulated a lot of ideas but were unable to work on them due to touring. In mid-November, the group began writing new material.<ref name=FCNews>{{cite web|url=http://fullcollapse.com:80/displaynews.asp?TimeStamp=C|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307232654/http://www.fullcollapse.com/displaynews.asp?TimeStamp=C|title=News|publisher=Thursday|date=2002|archive-date=March 7, 2005|access-date=February 5, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After an entire writing and recording process that took only six months, the band issued their third album and [[major label]] debut, ''[[War All the Time (Thursday album)|War All the Time]]'', on September 16, 2003 to critical acclaim and strong commercial performance. ''War All the Time'' was the first release to feature [[Andrew Everding]] on keyboards, though he would not become an official member of the band until December  2004, when he was officially welcomed into the band at a Christmas holiday show held at the [[Starland Ballroom]] in [[Sayreville, New Jersey]]. The album's title, coupled with it being released approximately two years after the [[terrorist]] attacks of September 11, 2001, led many critics to believe it was a political album; however, Rickly has denied this on many accounts, instead claiming that he is speaking about [[love]] being a [[war]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://media.www.whartonjournal.com/media/storage/paper201/news/2003/10/06/Insider/Thursday.Declares.War.All.The.Time-519284.shtml| title=Thursday declares War All the Time| access-date=May 26, 2008| publisher=Wharton Journal| date=October 6, 2003| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225193847/http://media.www.whartonjournal.com/media/storage/paper201/news/2003/10/06/Insider/Thursday.Declares.War.All.The.Time-519284.shtml| archive-date=February 25, 2008}}</ref> The album spawned two singles: "[[Signals Over the Air]]" and "War All the Time", though the latter received considerably less attention due to [[MTV]] banning the video for controversial material involving a fake [[news]] feed that appeared to be real and teenagers being weapon targets.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.filteringcraig.com/2004/03/16/war-all-the-time-too-disturbing/| title=War all the Time too Disturbing?| access-date=May 26, 2008| publisher=FilteringCraig| date=March 16, 2004}}</ref>

Thursday toured extensively to support ''War All the Time'', featuring dates with acts such as [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Thrice]], and [[Coheed and Cambria]]. On these tours, Thursday performed many in-store [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] sessions at various [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]] stores and other record stores. The band also recorded a live acoustic session for Y100 Sonic Sessions, a radio program on the now defunct [[Philadelphia]]-based radio station, [[Y-Rock On XPN|Y100]]. The live acoustic version of single "Signals Over the Air" was used on Y100 Sonic Sessions Volume 8. The band released two EPs: the first was ''Live from the SoHo & Santa Monica Stores Split EP'' and sold exclusively on [[iTunes]], and the second was a promotion found in [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]], called the ''[[Live in Detroit EP]]''.

The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2004, citing label pressure, extensive touring, and health problems as the reasons. However, Thursday returned for a charitable performance to save [[New York City]]'s [[CBGB]], on August 25, 2005, which was streamed live through the CBGB's website.

===''A City by the Light Divided'' and Envy split release (2006–2008)===
In fall 2005, five Thursday demo songs were stolen from the [[iPod]] of the tour manager for [[My American Heart]], a band Rickly had recently collaborated with for their song "We Are the Fabrication". The band issued a statement on their official website stating that they were disappointed the unfinished products leaked, but that they were glad that people take that much interest in their music. The band confirmed the title of one demo, "At This Velocity" and promised it would make their upcoming album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1510427/thursday-frontman-says-he-doesnt-want-to-exploit-my-chemical-romance-but/|title=Thursday Frontman Says He Doesn't Want To Exploit My Chemical Romance, But ...|website=Mtv.com|access-date=July 28, 2018}}</ref> Three other songs ("The Other Side of the Crash/Over and Out (Of Control)", "Telegraph Avenue Kiss", and "Autumn Leaves Revisited") would also make the album, while the remaining demo would later become the song "Last Call" on their fifth studio album, ''Common Existence''. Thursday had originally toyed with the idea of a [[double album]] to follow up ''War All the Time'' but the idea was scrapped, reporting on their website that they believed "not even [[The Beatles]] could properly fill two discs with enough worthy material".

Thursday released their fourth album and second major label release, ''[[A City by the Light Divided]]'', on May 2, 2006, on Island Records in the US and [[Hassle Records]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The album was produced by [[Dave Fridmann]], becoming Thursday's first full-length album not produced by [[Sal Villanueva]]. The title was created by Geoff Rickly by combining two lines from the poem ''Sunstone'' by [[Octavio Paz]]. The album was available for preview on the band's [[MySpace]] page on April 18, 2006, two weeks before it was officially released. ''A City by the Light Divided'' was generally received well by critics, spawning two singles: "[[Counting 5-4-3-2-1]]" and "[[At This Velocity]]", though the latter received considerably less attention. The band left Island Records in early 2007.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=224371| title=Thursday and Island Part Ways| access-date=May 26, 2008| website=[[AbsolutePunk]]| date=March 27, 2007}}</ref>

At their 2007 [[New Year's Eve]] show at the [[Starland Ballroom]], the band announced that they will be writing and recording new material in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=287247| title=Thursday and the New Year| access-date=May 26, 2008| publisher=absolutepunk.net| date=January 3, 2008}}</ref> During a private show they performed on May 3, 2007 in [[New York City]], long-time friend and artist manager, David "Rev" Ciancio proposed to his [[fiancée]] on stage. Thursday also held a performance on May 5 at [[The Bamboozle]] under the fake name Bearfort. Thursday cancelled all tour plans until their fall tour with [[Circle Takes the Square]] and [[Portugal. The Man]] in support of ''[[Kill the House Lights]]'', a DVD/CD [[compilation album]] and [[live album]]. featuring demos, unreleased songs, footage of live performances, and a documentary about the band. The album was released on October 30, 2007 by their former label Victory Records.

Thursday announced on April 2, 2008, via a [[MySpace]] bulletin and their official website, a new [[split album]] with Japanese [[post-hardcore]] band [[Envy (band)|Envy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thursday.net/thursday/news.asp?xid=3771&id=1437782 |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 10, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423080940/http://thursday.net/thursday/news.asp?xid=3771&id=1437782 |archive-date=April 23, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band debuted a song from the album live during their show in [[Poughkeepsie]] on April 24, 2008, and the album, ''[[Thursday / Envy]]'', was released on [[Temporary Residence Limited]] on November 4, 2008.<ref name="newsong">{{cite web|url=http://intunemusic.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/thursday-envy-on-the-coast-innerpartysystem-god-fires-man-poughkeepsie-424/|title=Live Review 4/24|access-date=April 28, 2008|publisher=inTuneMusic}}</ref>

===''Common Existence'' (2009–2010)===
The band announced on September 30, 2008 that they had signed with [[Epitaph Records]], regarding their new label the band stated: "It's a great feeling to have a label encourage you to be more socially conscious and politically active."<ref>[http://www.punknews.org/article/30651 "Thursday sign to Epitaph."]  punknews.org.  September 30, 2008.</ref> Thursday released their fifth full-length album,''[[Common Existence]]'', on February 17, 2009 on Epitaph Records. In a March 2009 interview, Rickly explained the album's title refers to humanity's shared experience, and that many of the songs were influenced by the words of his favorite poets and authors: "Almost every song on the record is connected to a different writer. The first song, "Resuscitation of a Dead Man" is influenced by [[Denis Johnson]]'s ''Resuscitation of a Hanged Man''. Another song is based on a book [ [[Martin Amis]]'] [[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]. The whole record also has a lot of themes from [[Roberto Bolano]], a poet who wrote ''[[The Savage Detectives]]'' and a few other things.

===''No Devolución'' and disbandment (2011–2015)===
Thursday began recording their next album in July 2010, at Tarbox Road Studios in [[Fredonia, New York]] with Dave Fridmann, who had also produced the group's two previous albums.<ref name="PN-July2010">{{cite web| last = Paul| first = Aubin| title = Thursday begin recording album No.&nbsp;6| publisher = punknews.org| date = July 6, 2010| url = http://www.punknews.org/article/38937| access-date = July 6, 2010}}</ref> Their sixth album and second release for Epitaph Records, ''[[No Devolución]]'', was released on April 12, 2011.<ref name="spin1">{{cite web| last = Gaston| first = Peter| title = Hear Music: Thursday Reveal Edgy New Album| work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]| date = February 1, 2011| url = https://www.spin.com/2011/02/hear-music-thursday-reveal-edgy-new-album/| access-date = February 1, 2011}}</ref> Vocalist Geoff Rickly commented on the style of the new album, stating, "In style, this record feels like a radical departure from our earlier records but in substance it feels like a return. The songs are more vulnerable than they've been in a long time.

On November 22, 2011, Thursday posted a statement on their official website and their [[Twitter]] account reading "Thanks & Love", expressing their intention to stop producing music together. However, the statement about the status of band was ambiguous, not stating explicitly in the article whether they were breaking up or on an indefinite hiatus.<ref name= Thursday.net>{{cite web|url=http://thursday.net/thank-you |title=Thank You |publisher=thursday.net |date=November 22, 2011 |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref><ref name="twitter">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/thursdayband/status/139072867026477056|title=Thanks & Love|publisher=twitter.com|access-date=September 2, 2012}}</ref> The following is excerpted from the article:

{{quote|Despite the fantastic year that the band has enjoyed, creatively, things haven't been as easy for us on a personal level.  Without diving into detail, it's fair to say that this year has been an endless series of personal difficulties.  We haven't had any falling out and are all still close.  I'm sure that we will continue to create, in some capacity, together.  We've talked about turning Thursday into something else: a non-profit, a band that only records sporadically, a collection of other projects… Underneath it all, the personal circumstances involved make it impossible to continue Thursday in the spirit that has made it special.  So, we stop.  For now, at least.<ref name="Thursday.net"/>}}

In January 2013, Geoff Rickly stated during an interview that Thursday had in fact disbanded, and that the term "hiatus" was misleading as it had only been used in case the band did ever decided to play a show again. He did, however, indicate that there was a possibility for the band to play shows in the future, but no new material would ever be produced.<ref name="rochestercitynewspaper.com"/>

Since their disbandment, Rickly formed the band [[No Devotion]] in 2014 with former members of the band [[Lostprophets]], and has continued his side-project [[United Nations (band)|United Nations]]. Tucker Rule became the touring drummer for the British Boy Band [[The Wanted]], the pop-punk band [[Yellowcard]] and works as a hired musician as well as studio drummer.<ref>{{cite web| last = Crane| first = Matt| title = Ex-Thursday drummer joins Yellowcard on tour| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = August 29, 2014| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/ex_thursday_drummer_joins_yellowcard_on_tour| access-date = August 29, 2014}}</ref>

===Reunion and second breakup (2016–2019)===
In January 2016, former members of Thursday posted a picture of themselves hanging out to Rickly's Twitter account. This sparked rumors that the band would soon be reuniting, however Rickly quickly dispelled these rumors saying that their communication was minimal in the five years since disbanding and they were "just finally mending some fences and healing some old wounds."<ref>{{cite web| last = Sharp| first = Tyler| title = Original Thursday members reunited over the weekend| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = January 18, 2016| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/original_thursday_members_reunited_over_the_weekend| access-date = March 24, 2016}}</ref> Thursday's former booking agent began encouraging them to reunite the band with the freedom to do whatever they wanted and without the pressure of having to write a new album.<ref name="rocksound-2016reunion">{{cite web| last = Doyle| first = Tomas| title = Geoff Rickly Talks Thursday's Comeback And 'Rewinding To What We Had'| work = [[Rock Sound]]| date = March 24, 2016| url = http://www.rocksound.tv/features/read/geoff-rickly-talks-thursdays-comeback-and-rewinding-to-what-we-had| access-date = March 24, 2016}}</ref>

Two months later, Thursday announced they would reunite for Atlanta, Georgia's Wrecking Ball music festival in August 2016.<ref name="pitchfork-reunite">{{cite web| last = Camp| first = Zoe| title = Thursday Reunite| work = [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]| date = March 22, 2016| url = http://pitchfork.com/news/64320-thursday-reunite/| access-date = March 22, 2016}}</ref> In a statement about the reunion show, Rickly said: "Five years ago, we found it necessary to end Thursday for reasons beyond our control. Earlier this year, we were able to reconcile all of our differences and spend time together. This is a vital component to what we loved about being in Thursday and we're happy to say that we'll be playing this show as the same line-up that began touring together on ''Full Collapse'' and jointly worked on every record since."<ref name="pitchfork-reunite"/> Thursday agreed to perform at Wrecking Ball only two days before publicly announcing their participation, and the decision was made after its organizers allowed the band to perform "in our own way, including involving a charity" and after hearing about the strong lineup of bands on the festival.<ref name="rocksound-2016reunion"/> The band had no intention to reunite before this decision.<ref>{{cite web| last = Ryken| first = Atreyue| title = Thursday frontman opens up on live reunion: 'we couldn't say no'| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = March 22, 2016| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/thursday_frontman_opens_up_on_live_reunion_we_couldnt_say_no| access-date = March 22, 2016}}</ref> Two months later, it was announced that the band would be playing both Denver and Chicago dates of [[Riot Fest]] in September, causing speculation that the band may play more shows later on in the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/riot-fest-reveals-2016-lineup-and-its-batshit-crazy/|title=Riot Fest reveals 2016 lineup, and it's batshit crazy|date=May 18, 2016|website=Consequenceofsound.net|access-date=July 28, 2018}}</ref>

On June 15, the band's official Instagram posted a picture of a show bill announcing a 'homecoming' on December 30 at Starland Ballroom. The caption on the Instagram post read, "NJ-you won't believe the homecoming we have planned. The lineup and SETLIST are going to be insane." On November 6, the band played the inaugural Sound on Sound fest just outside of Austin, TX.

On January 31, 2017, the band announced a 24 date tour to take place in March and April 2017. Aside from the tour, Thursday headlined the 2017 [[Northside Festival]] in Brooklyn, New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/northside-presents-thursday-pup-the-hotelier-jeff-rosenstock-tony-molina-tickets-32889684933|title=Northside Presents: Thursday {{!}} PUP {{!}}  The Hotelier {{!}} Jeff Rosenstock {{!}} Tony Molina|website=Eventbrite|language=en-US|access-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref>

The band announced in October 2018 that they would be ending their reunion the following year while stating "when we stopped playing last time, it wasn't on the best of terms. This time, we get to put down touring on the very highest of notes: in each other's lives and able to pick up and play together behind closed doors whenever we want. If we are ever able to do Thursday again, it will be a new, separate chapter. Thank you all for your time, attention and friendship.".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/thursday-full-collapse-war-all-the-time-2019-tour-end-reunion/|title=Thursday to Revisit Big Albums on 2019 Tour, Then End Reunion|last=Childers|first=Chad|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> The band's final show took place on March 17, 2019 at [[Saint Vitus (venue)|Saint Vitus]] in [[Brooklyn, NY]].<ref name="brooklynvegan.com"/>

In May 2019, due to mounting pressure from their international fanbase, who did not get an opportunity to see the reunion tour, the band announced that they would play Germany and released the following statement: "We are so excited and surprised to be able to announce Family First Festival in Cologne. After our last show, we began conversations about all the places that we hadn't been able to play on our reunion. It seemed impossible that we would all be available at the same time to play shows again, especially in any sustained way. But when our old friends in boysetsfire asked us to play this festival with them, we saw that we had a rare opportunity to accomplish two things at once: visit a country that's always been kind to Thursday and play, once more, with a band that we've admired since before we were a band, a band that took us on one of our first tours ever. After much discussion among ourselves, we decided that there were certain cities around the globe that we had unfinished business in and if we find that, at some point in the future, we're in a position to play them, then we will. We hope to see you there."

They then proceeded to announce a show in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, and two UK shows to be held at London's [[Electric Ballroom]], due to play ''Full Collapse'' on night one followed by ''War All the Time'' on night two, which took place in December 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2019/06/21/news/thursday-announce-uk-netherlands-shows/|title=Thursday Announce UK & Netherlands Shows|website=theprp.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref> Following this they appeared at The Shrine in Los Angeles on December 20, opening for the reunited [[My Chemical Romance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2019/11/08/news/thursday-to-open-my-chemical-romances-los-angeles-reunion-show/|title=Thursday To Open My Chemical Romance's Los Angeles Reunion Show|website=theprp.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref>

===Second return (2020–present)===
Despite the band's previous statement that their reunion would come to an end, it was announced in June 2020 that Thursday would play their first show in nearly two years at [[Riot Fest]] in September 2021.<ref name=riotfest/> They also played a series of live shows that same month in the East Coast and Midwest with [[Taking Back Sunday]] and [[Piebald (band)|Piebald]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Taking Back Sunday & Thursday Announce September Shows|url=https://www.theprp.com/2021/06/16/news/taking-back-sunday-thursday-announce-september-shows/|website=theprp.com|date=June 16, 2021|access-date=October 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Thursday & Piebald Announce Two September Shows|url=https://www.theprp.com/2021/06/23/news/thursday-piebald-announce-two-september-shows/|website=theprp.com|date=June 23, 2021|access-date=October 7, 2021}}</ref>

==Logo==
[[Image:Thursdaylogo.png|thumb|right|The Thursday dove logo]]
Thursday used a [[dove]] logo which is featured on much of the band's artwork and merchandise. The dove is believed to have been conceived by guitarist Tom Keeley on a [[tour bus]] sometime before ''[[Full Collapse]]'' was recorded. Lyrics from the song "[[Cross Out the Eyes]]" on the album reference a dove twice, but it is unknown if these lyrics were inspired by the dove art or vice versa.  The logo debuted on the cover art for ''[[War All the Time (Thursday album)|War All the Time]]'' in 2003, appearing on the artwork for all of Thursday's album and [[Single (music)|single]] artwork until 2011, where it was notably absent on the cover art for their sixth and final album ''[[No Devolución]]''.

The band also used a second logo, a red [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]] with a small [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] below it. This logo first appeared on the cover art for ''[[A City by the Light Divided]]'' in 2006, and featured on merchandise related to the album. It can also be seen faded in the background of the cover for ''[[Kill the House Lights]]''.

Additionally, [[Shepard Fairey]] (Creator of [[Obey (clothing)|Obey]]) created artwork for the band with a new dove logo, which has been used on other works by Fairey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merchdirect.com/Thursday/Tshirts/ShepardFairyDoveonKellyGreen/?productid=3227|title=Thursday|website=Thursday}}</ref>
