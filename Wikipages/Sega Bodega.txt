Sega Bodega first began gaining traction through various remixes, from which he gained widespread attention from, and DJ gigs, supporting [[Lil B]] in Glasgow and playing the [[Field Day (festival)|London Field Day]] festival in 2012.

In February 2013, Sega Bodega released his debut EP ''Song Dynasty'', a collection of tracks recorded as far back as 2010, but refined and polished after developing a better understanding of the technicalities to music production.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ferocious Perfectionist: Sega Bodega Interviewed|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/features/ferocious-perfectionist-sega-bodega-interviewed|access-date=2020-11-19|website=Clash Magazine|language=en}}</ref> The EP was released via the London-based label, Week of Wonders. This was followed by his ''34'' EP, released in May 2013, also via the Week of Wonders label.

In May 2014, Sega Bodega was a part of the lineup for [[BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend|BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend]] festival, where he played his re-released single "Stay Nervous", and "Maryland", which would later appear on his 2018 EP ''self*care'', among other tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=2014|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ep3g9r/artists/by/a-z|access-date=2020-11-19|website=BBC Music Events|language=en}}</ref> He also relocated to London in 2014.

In June 2016, London rapper [[Shygirl]] released her debut single, "Want More", produced by Sega Bodega. The single marked the first release of collective and label NUXXE, co-founded by Sega Bodega, Shygirl and French producer and performer [[Coucou Chloe]], formed from a desire to create music and art with an easy-going, free-flowing and fun attitude, separate from other pre-establishing labels, and to introduce a sound that no one had heard before to the world.<ref name=":2" /> The single would also appear in a [[Fenty Beauty]] commercial later in 2019.<ref name=":1" /> The release of "Want More" was followed by a collaborative single in October 2016 from Sega Bodega and Coucou Chloe titled "SPIT INTENT", under the moniker Y1640.
