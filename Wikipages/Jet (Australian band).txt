==History==

===Formation and ''Dirty Sweet'' (2001–2003)===
Brothers [[Nic Cester]] and [[Chris Cester]] grew up in [[Dingley Village]], a south-eastern suburb of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and attended [[St Bede's College Mentone]], listening to their father's [[classic rock]] records from the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hOdHbs95go | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/6hOdHbs95go| archive-date=2021-11-18 | url-status=live|title=Jet, the early years |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-01 |access-date=2012-04-13}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

However, according to Nic, it was Australian band [[You Am I]] who had the biggest influence on Jet's developing musical tastes:<blockquote>"''[[Hi Fi Way]]'' was the most important album of my generation. ... I think everyone our age, who played guitar, played You Am I songs for the first time in front of their school assembly. ... That was the record that made you realise you could be in an Australian band, you didn't have to be a grunge band and you didn't have to be influenced by American bands. It changed everything."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/sunday-magazine/wizards-of-oz/story-e6frf039-1111112857646 |title=Wizards of Oz |author=Tiffany Baker |date=21 January 2007 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=16 November 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

The brothers decided to form a band with [[Cameron Muncey]], Nic's friend and previous bandmate, and with bassist Doug Armstrong whom Nic and Chris met while working together at their father's spice factory. During 2001 an old high school friend of Chris' joined the band on keyboard, and it was at this time that the band took their current name.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} They wanted a short name so when it showed up on festival advertisements, it would be large and bold in print.{{original research inline|date=November 2010}}{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} "Radio Song", from their album ''[[Get Born]]'', was written about the troubles that the band had getting recognition at this time.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Jet got their big break when seminal Melbourne Punk rock band [[The Specimens]] took Jet under their wing and put them on as an opening act at The Duke of Windsor. This is where Dave Powell first saw the band perform and went on to sign them to his management firm Majorbox.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The new band met [[Mark Wilson (musician)|Mark Wilson]] one night in 2002 at a concert and, despite already having a bass player, asked him to play with them. Wilson was then the bassist in a band called The CA$inos, so he initially declined. However, a few days later he called the band and said he would like to join them instead.

In 2002 the band released the ''[[Dirty Sweet]]'' EP, whose initial 1000 copies quickly sold out.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} ''[[NME]]'' obtained a copy of the single from ''Dirty Sweet'', "Take It or Leave It", and praised it.{{vague|date=November 2010}} [[Elektra Records]] offered the band a contract{{when|date=November 2010}} and re-released ''Dirty Sweet'' in 2003.

===''Get Born'' (2003–2005)===
{{Main|Get Born}}
Jet entered the [[Sunset Sound Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]] with [[Dave Sardy]] to produce their debut album ''[[Get Born]]''. Sardy had previously produced records for [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] and [[The Dandy Warhols]]. They also enlisted the services of keyboard maestro [[Billy Preston]] for two of the songs. The album derived its name from the blockbuster action movie, ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'', starring [[Matt Damon]] as [[Jason Bourne]]. Halfway through recording, the band received a call from [[The Rolling Stones]] offering them a support slot on the Australian leg of their 2003 tour.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} Jet played more than 200 shows in 2003.<ref name="high">{{cite news|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=8 April 2004|title=Jet's High Times|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jet/articles/story/5939242/jets_high_times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022200307/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jet/articles/story/5939242/jets_high_times|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 October 2006|first=Jenny|last=Eliscu}}</ref>

Their singles "[[Are You Gonna Be My Girl]]" and "[[Rollover DJ]]" were voted number one and number nineteen respectively on the 2003 [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2003|Triple J Hottest 100]]. "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" appeared on the [[soundtrack]]s for the video games ''[[Madden NFL 2004]]'', ''Guitar Hero: On Tour'' and ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'', on ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' and the 2006 animated film ''[[Flushed Away]]'', and the films ''[[Eurotrip]]'' and ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]''. It was also part of two major worldwide advertising campaigns for [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iPod]] and [[iMac]] and for [[Vodafone]]. "[[Rollover DJ]]" features on the soundtrack to [[PlayStation 2]] game [[Gran Turismo 4]]. ''Get Born'' also includes the song "Timothy", dedicated to deceased brother of vocalist/guitarist Cameron Muncey, who died before Cameron was born. Due to the sensitive nature of the song, the band rarely plays "Timothy" live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmusicwetrust.com/articles/65h04.html |title=INTERVIEW: Jet: Australian Rock Imports |publisher=In Music We Trust |date=April–May 2004|access-date=2012-04-13}}</ref>

In early 2004, Jet teamed up with [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]] and [[The Living End]] on "the Aussie invasion" tour of US cities. A new Jet song not included on ''Get Born'', called "Hold On", was featured on the [[Spider-Man 2 (soundtrack)|''Spider-Man 2'' soundtrack]] that year. TV/film producer [[J. J. Abrams]] – whose credits include ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' – contacted Jet to record a song for the Season 4 premiere to his show ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]''. "[[Cold Hard Bitch]]" from ''Get Born'' was used, and became the soundtrack to a frenetic scene of two [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents sprinting down a [[Hong Kong]] street, giving Jet further US exposure.

Later the same year, Jet received nominations for the annual [[Radio Music Awards]], including 'Artist of the Year: Rock Radio', 'Artist of the Year: Rock Alternative Radio', and 'Song of the Year: Rock Radio' (for "Cold Hard Bitch"). Still in the U.S. Jet received the [[American Music Awards of 2004|32nd Annual American Music Awards]] nomination as 'Favorite Artist – Alternative Music', as well as three nominations for the [[2004 MTV Video Music Awards]], held in Miami in August. "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" was nominated for [[Best Rock Video]], [[Best New Artist]] and Best Editing in a video. Jet performed "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" live at the ceremony and picked up the award for [[Best Rock Video]], dedicating the award to Chris and Nic's late father John Cester. Following their success in Miami, back home in Australia the band was nominated in seven categories at the 2004 [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] (Australian Record Industry Association) [[ARIA Music Awards|Music Awards]], receiving nominations in a stunning seven categories; 'Album of the Year', 'Single of the Year' (for "Are You Gonna Be My Girl"), 'Best Group', 'Best Rock Album', 'Breakthrough Artist – Album', 'Breakthrough Artist – Single' (for "Are You Gonna Be My Girl"), and 'Highest Selling Album'. At the awards ceremony on 17 October 2004, Jet dominated the ceremony receiving six awards out of the seven nominations. Nic Cester also performed as part of supergroup [[The Wrights (Australian band)|The Wrights]], featuring members of other Australian rock bands [[Spiderbait]] (Kram, drums), [[The Living End]] (Chris Cheney, guitar), [[Dallas Crane]] (Pat Bourke, bass) and [[You Am I]]/The Pictures (Davey Lane, guitar).

During a show at the [[MCG]] in October 2005, founder Nic Cester declared loudly between songs that he considered Jet to be 'up there with the greatests, with f**king [[John Lennon|Lennon]] and the [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]]'. This caused considerable controversy but was soon settled when Australian music magazines began publishing articles comparing Jet albums with those of famous 60s and 70s bands.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schuler |first=Rachel |date=3 November 2014 |title=Where Are They Now: Jet |url=http://www.infectiousmagazine.com/where-are-they-now-jet/ |newspaper=Infectious Magazine |location=Australia |access-date=25 June 2016 }}</ref>

===''Shine On'' (2006–2008)===
The debut single from the band's second album ''[[Shine On (Jet album)|Shine On]]'', titled "[[Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is (Jet Song)|Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is]]", was released to radio on 7 August 2006. ''Shine On'' was released on 30 September 2006 (2 October in the UK, 3 October in the US) with a final track listing of 15 songs, but with an extra sixteenth track, titled "Coming Home Soon", available only on the ITunes Store. It debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the Australian charts. Critical reaction to the album was mixed with British music magazine ''NME'' calling the record "another joyfully old-fashioned rock'n'roll album immersed in the classics."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/jet/8037 |title=''NME'' review |website=NME|date=29 September 2006 |access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref> but influential American music blog [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] gave the album 0 out of 10 stars, posting a video of a chimpanzee urinating in its own mouth in place of a review.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9464-shine-on/ |title=Jet: Shine On|website=Pitchfork.com}}</ref> The song also appeared on ''NME''{{'}}s compilation CD, ''NME: The Essential Bands – Festival Edition''.

"[[Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is (Jet Song)|Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is]]" appeared on the "[[Chuck (TV series)]]" pilot episode; Season 1 Episode 1 "[[Chuck Versus the Intersect]]".

Jet played at the [[MTV Europe]] Awards in [[Copenhagen]].{{when|date=November 2010}} It was their first live performance since Nic Cester's [[laryngitis]] halted their World Tour.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In November 2006 Jet flew back to Australia to perform at the [[Make Poverty History Concert]] in Melbourne at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]]; upon their return they also held a secret show on a barge floating on the [[Yarra River]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The second singles from the album, "[[Bring It on Back]]" (in the UK) and "[[Rip It Up (Jet song)|Rip It Up]]" (in Australia) were released in November 2006. The album also spawned an EP, the ''[[Shine On (EP)|Shine On]]'' EP released December 2006.

The title track, "[[Shine On (Jet song)|Shine On]]", was released on various dates in March 2007 around the world as the third single (second single in some countries). The song is a tribute to Nic and Chris Cester's father, who died from cancer in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/17/1097951560187.html |title=Jet dominate the ARIAs |work=The Age |date=18 October 2004|access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref> It was written by Nic Cester from the perspective of his father encouraging those who survive him to "shine on". Many songs on the album ("Come On Come On", "Bring It on Back", "Stand Up", "Holiday", "All You Have to Do") are primarily about overcoming adversity and challenge.

Jet co-headlined a series of shows during the 2007 [[Big Day Out]] festival in Australia and New Zealand, with acts [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[The Killers]], and [[My Chemical Romance]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/aust/28762/Big_Day_Out_lineup_announced_for_real |title=Big Day Out 2007 Lineup |publisher=Inthemix.com.au |date=3 October 2006|access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref> The band played their Rip It Up Oz tour in late May and June 2007, which was supported by [[Channel V]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Also in 2007, they released a new song for the [[Spider-Man 3 (soundtrack)|''Spider-Man 3'' soundtrack]] titled "Falling Star".{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In addition, their song "Rip It Up" appeared on the ''[[TMNT (film)|TMNT]]'' soundtrack.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} It also became the official theme for the wrestling show ''[[WWE]]'' ''[[SummerSlam|Summerslam]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In August, the band was again asked to support [[The Rolling Stones]] on the European leg of their [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|World Tour]].

In October 2007, the band returned to Australia to perform at the [[AFL Grand Final]] and to finish the rest of their world tour. They announced on their website that they would begin production on their third studio album, due for a 2008 release. However, in November, the band announced they would take "some time off". They stated that after touring for ''Shine On'' they needed some "down time".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelondonpaper.typepad.com/thelondonblog/2007/10/jet-split-for-n.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027065431/http://thelondonpaper.typepad.com/thelondonblog/2007/10/jet-split-for-n.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 October 2007 |title=Jet split... for now |work=The London Blog }}</ref> On 24 October Chris and Mark produced a song, under the name "The Vice Lords" for the [[Japan]]ese former duo [[Superfly (band)|Superfly]] titled "[[I Spy I Spy]]".

===''Shaka Rock'' and disbandment (2009–2012)===
In a video on their website, the band talked about writing and recording songs at Atlantic Sound Studios in New York City. [[Chris Cester]] cheated: "We've got to stop writing; we got too many songs." They also collaborated with [[Iggy Pop]] to release a cover of the [[Johnny O'Keefe]] single "[[Wild One (Johnny O'Keefe song)|Wild One]]". Jet returned to Australia to play a secret show in Melbourne on 17 December to debut new material, including new songs titled "Goodbye Hollywood", "Walk", "Start The Show", "Black Hearts", "She's a Genius", "Seventeen", and "Beat On Repeat". Guitarist Cameron Muncey particularly expressed that he "really, really loves the song 'Seventeen'." Said Cameron of the song, "I think is sort of a step forward for us songwriting-wise. It's sorta got everything wrapped into one, a storyline, and sad to say melancholy. It's rock and roll, it's rocking, it's got all these other albums to it, you know, so I find it really interesting."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200908/20018356.html |title=Jet: Shaking Up the Airwaves with Shaka Rock |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827123732/http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200908/20018356.html |archive-date=2009-08-27}}</ref>

==Activism==

===The Fred Hollows Foundation===
In May 2008, Jet released a video clip on [[YouTube]] paying tribute to the work of the late [[Fred Hollows]] and The Fred Hollows Foundation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hollows.org |title=The Fred Hollows Foundation|website=Hollows.org}}</ref> Lead singer Nic Cester says he wanted to highlight that Professor Hollow's work to restore sight to the cataract blind in developing countries was ongoing 15 years after his death. "Fred Hollows was such a big figure in Australia and he had a huge impact, but he passed away when there was still work to do," Cester said in a statement. "This clip is a bit of a reminder, hopefully it encourages people to make a donation to keep Fred's work going."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=569559 |title=Jet releasing Fred Hollows tribute clip (NINEMSN) |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |access-date=2011-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112091123/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=569559 |archive-date=2009-01-12}}</ref> The video tribute features Jet's song "[[Shine On (Jet song)|Shine On]]" along with images compiled by [[The Fred Hollows Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://optuszoo.news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=569559 |title=Jet releasing Fred Hollows tribute clip (NINEMSN) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112083805/http://optuszoo.news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=569559 |archive-date=2009-01-12}}</ref>
