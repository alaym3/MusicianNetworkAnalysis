=== Post-Naked Raygun ===
In 1989, John Haggerty left Naked Raygun to form [[Pegboy]] with his younger brother Joe (formerly of Bloodsport and [[The Effigies]]) and Steve Saylors and Larry Damore of the [[Bhopal Stiffs]] (Pierre Kezdy would later replace Steve Saylors).<ref>{{Allmusic | class = artist | id = p13922 | tab = biography | label = Pegboy Biography by Steve Huey}}</ref>

Jeff Pezzati is also the lead singer of [[The Bomb (band)|The Bomb]], which is a different and later band than the San Francisco group, known as "Bomb".<ref>{{Allmusic | class = artist | id = p464156 | tab = biography | label = The Bomb Biography by Andy Kellman}}</ref>
