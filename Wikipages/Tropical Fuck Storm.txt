== Biography ==
===2016–2018: The Drones hiatus and ''A Laughing Death in Meatspace''===
Looking to reboot creatively, The Drones went on hiatus at the end of their tour supporting ''[[Feelin Kinda Free|Feelin' Kinda Free]]'' in December 2016. The following year, Drones founder Gareth Liddiard and longtime bandmate Fiona Kitschin started writing material for a new project under the name for the record label they'd coined to self-release the last Drones album. They recruited Erica Dunn and Lauren Hammel during the summer of 2017, before embarking on an American tour. According to Dunn, "They just rang me up. Gareth and Fi were on loudspeaker like excited children. The pitch was 'Do you want to play guitar? We're just going to do some weird shit.' And I was like 'Okay, sure.' Then Gareth said 'We might go to America in the next month, are you free? And we have to write some songs.' Sure I'll clear my schedule. Hammer [Lauren Hammel] was a bit different though, because [Gareth] didn't know her and he had to take her to the pub."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/xw7bbk/tropical-fuck-storm-album-stream-premiere-interview-gareth-liddiard-2018|title=Tropical Fuck Storm Have the Best Band Name (and An Even Better Album)|date=2018-05-02|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ep138: Gareth "Gaz" Liddiard (Tropical Fuck Storm, The Drones) |url=https://www.protonicreversal.com/2019/09/06/ep138-gareth-gaz-liddiard-tropical-fuck-storm-the-drones/ |website=protonicreversal.com |accessdate=15 June 2020}}</ref>

They released a series of 7-inch singles later that autumn while on tour with [[Band of Horses]] and [[King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard]] in the US. Their debut album, ''[[A Laughing Death in Meatspace]]'', dropped in March 2018 and the band signed with [[Joyful Noise Recordings]] shortly thereafter. "The album title links "meatspace" – as Silicon Valley engineers derogatorily refer to the physical realm – with a neurodegenerative disorder called kuru, once found in the [[Fore people]] of Papua New Guinea. Men would eat the muscles of the deceased, while women and children ate the brains, thereby inheriting [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] and pot-holing their own grey matter to such an extent that they lost control of their emotions and laughed themselves to death."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/02/gareth-liddiard-on-the-wreckage-of-the-web-if-i-could-go-back-to-1999-i-would|title=Gareth Liddiard on the wreckage of the web: 'If I could go back to 1999, I would'|last=Valentish|first=Jenny|date=2018-05-02|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> Videos for the songs "You Let My Tyres Down", "Rubber Bullies", "Soft Power" & "The Future Of History" were released over 2017 & 2018.

The album – which saw the band utilize a range of obscure digital guitar effects, [[synthesizers]], [[drum machines]], and [[Digital audio workstation|DAW]] software such as [[ProTools]] – received positive reviews for both its raw and unusual style as well as its lyricism.<ref name="mc">{{cite web|title=A Laughing Death in Meatspace by Tropical Fuck Storm|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/a-laughing-death-in-meatspace/tropical-fuck-storm|access-date=27 September 2020|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> [[Greil Marcus]] wrote that the album makes "as fierce a band as" [[The Drones (Australian band)|The Drones]] "seem austere" in comparison, writing that "the explosions in "Two Afternoons," "A Laughing Death," and "Rubber Bullies" are glorious and frightening, so big they don't feel quite real, but there's a story trying to climb out of the noise, carried by Liddiard's weariness, his uncynical fatalism, but shaped by the counter-vocals of Kitschin and Dunn". He concluded by saying that "you can feel as if this is what history sounds like as it's being written."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/08/22/real-life-rock-top-10-memories-of-aretha/|title=Real Life Rock Top 10: Memories of Aretha|website=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=30 August 2018}}</ref> 

Contemporaries such as [[Thalia Zedek]] and [[Conan Neutron & the Secret Friends|Conan Neutron]] named it their favorite album of the year, with the latter calling it "[a]bsolutely powerful stuff.

''Treble'' magazine, in a review published on 12 August 2019, named ''Braindrops'' their "Album of the Week" praising the track "Paradise" as "a sickly mirage of an oasis—you can practically see the disspiating heat haze over Liddiard's trickling guitar riffs. It slowly escalates its way toward a furious climax, turning into one of the most explosive break-up songs in recent memory". The review concludes: "Tropical Fuck Storm invite the chaos, orchestrating it, manipulating it, delivering a piece of mangled and bruised art that sounds magnificent at its most frayed and fragmented. It's a weirdness that feels strangely assuring, even necessary."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Album of the Week: Tropical Fuck Storm - Braindrops|url=https://www.treblezine.com/reviews/tropical-fuck-storm-braindrops-review-album-of-the-week/|last=Terich|first=Jeff}}</ref> ''NARC Magazine'' gave the album a perfect score, writing that it "pretty much cements the Australians as one of the most vital acts on the planet right now." ''[[Exclaim!]]'' called it "a [[psychedelic rock]] opera occasionally dipping its toes in the stream of [[Electro punk|electro-punk]].

"We all started it at breakfast one morning. But at about 11am I took a shower and the concept came to me.
