==Musical career==
After settling in Greece, Roussos participated in a series of musical groups beginning with the Idols when he was 17, where he met Evángelos Papathanassíou (later known as [[Vangelis]]) and [[Loukas Sideras]], his future bandmates in [[Aphrodite's Child]].<ref name=reuters>{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-roussos-idUSKBN0KZ1X620150126 |title=Greek singer Demis Roussos dead at 68 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=26 January 2015 |access-date=30 November 2017}}</ref> After this, he joined the [[Athens]]-based band We Five, another cover band which had limited success in Greece.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/26/demis-roussos |title=Demis Roussos obituary |first=Dave |last=Laing |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 January 2015 |access-date=30 November 2017}}</ref>

Roussos came to a wider audience in 1967 when he joined [[progressive rock]] band Aphrodite's Child, with Vangelis and Sideras, initially as a singer but later also playing bass guitar, achieving commercial success in France and other parts of Europe from 1968 to 1972. They set off for London to break into the international music scene but were turned back at [[Dover]] due to visa problems. They retreated to Paris where they decided to stay, signing a record deal there with [[Philips Records]]. Their first recording sessions were delayed by the [[May 1968 events in France|general strike of May 1968]] but later the same year the song "[[Rain and Tears]]" was issued across Europe. The song appeared on the album ''[[End of the World (album)|End of the World]]'' in October. Composed by Vangelis and the French lyricist Boris Bergman, the song featured Roussos's unusual [[tenor|high tenor]]. The song was only a minor hit in Britain but was successful in many other countries.<ref name=guardian /> Roussos's operatic vocal style helped propel the band to international success, notably on their final album ''[[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]]'', based on passages from the [[Book of Revelation]], which became a [[progressive rock]] cult classic.<ref name=guardian/>

After Aphrodite's Child disbanded, Roussos continued to record sporadically with his former bandmate Vangelis. In 1970, the two released the [[Soundtrack album|film score album]] ''Sex Power'' (the album has also been credited to Aphrodite's Child), and later recorded the 1977 album ''Magic'' together. Their most successful collaboration was "Race to the End" (also sung in Spanish as "Tu Libertad"), a vocal adaptation of the musical theme from the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (scored by Vangelis). Roussos also guested on Vangelis's soundtrack to ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982),<ref name="Greek Reporter Jan. 26">{{cite web |url= http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/01/26/famous-greek-singer-demis-roussos-dies-dead/ |title=Famous Greek Singer Demis Roussos Dies at 68 |work=Greek Reporter |date=26 January 2015 |access-date=26 January 2015 |last=Zikakou |first=Ioanna}}</ref> on the tracks "Tales of the Future", "Damask Rose", "Taffey's Snake Pit Bar", and "On the Trail of Nexus 6" (several only available in non-[[Bootleg (music)|bootleg]] form on the 29th Anniversary Limited Edition CD set released in 2011).

==Solo career==
Roussos also began a solo career with the song "[[We Shall Dance]]" in 1971, which was a top ten hit in both the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. Initially unsuccessful, he toured around Europe and became a leading artist. His solo career peaked in the mid 1970s with several hit albums.<ref name="Greek Reporter Jan. 26"/> His single "[[Forever and Ever (Demis Roussos song)|Forever and Ever]]" topped the charts in several countries in 1973.

[[Philips Records]] released a [[The Roussos Phenomenon|four-song record of the same name]], which was the first [[extended play]] to top the UK singles chart.<ref name="Guardian Jan. 26, #2">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/26/demis-roussos | title=Demis Roussos obituary | work=The Guardian | date=26 January 2015 | access-date=27 January 2015 | author=Laing, Dave}}</ref> He was equally successful across Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Japan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wwno.org/post/prog-rock-pioneer-kitsch-king-remembering-demis-roussos | title=From Prog-Rock Pioneer To Kitsch King: Remembering Demis Roussos | publisher=WWNO | date=26 January 2015 | access-date=27 January 2015 | author=Tsioulcas, Anastasia}}</ref>

Roussos' run of hits was maintained in the 1980s mainly in France with a number two "[[Quand je t'aime]]" in 1988 and "[[On écrit sur les murs]]" in 1989, along with golden records for the albums ''[[Le Grec (album)|Le Grec]]'' and ''Voice and Vision''.

Roussos is the subject of an argument between two main characters in the TV adaptation of [[Mike Leigh]]'s 1977 play ''[[Abigail's Party]]''. On the day of Roussos' death, actress [[Alison Steadman]] was interviewed by [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[PM (BBC Radio 4)|PM]]'' and discussed the significance of the music in the play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05061zd|title=BBC Radio 4 – PM, 26/01/2015|publisher=BBC|access-date=26 January 2015}}</ref>

The [[Bollywood]] song "Mehbooba Mehbooba" from the film ''[[Sholay]]'' is based on Roussos "Say You Love Me". In an interview, its director [[Ramesh Sippy]] related attending a Roussos concert in London. His wife asked him to incorporate this song into ''Sholay'''s music track. The character singing the song on screen (played by Jalal Aga) used empty bottles as a part of the music in this version of the song.<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview with Ramesh Sippy|place=India|publisher=[[Lehren]] retro}}</ref>
