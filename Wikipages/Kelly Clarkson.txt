'''Kelly Brianne Clarkson''' (born April 24, 1982) is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. She rose to fame for winning the [[American Idol (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2002, which earned her a record deal with [[RCA Records|RCA]]. Her debut single, "[[A Moment Like This]]", topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became the country's best selling single of 2002. It was included on her debut album, ''[[Thankful (Kelly Clarkson album)|Thankful]]'' (2003), which debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Trying to reinvent her image, Clarkson parted ways with ''Idol'' management and shifted to [[pop rock]] for her second studio album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]'' (2004). Supported by four US top-ten singles: "[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]", "[[Since U Been Gone]]", "[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]", and "[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]", ''Breakaway'' sold over 12 million copies worldwide and won two [[Grammy Award]]s.

Clarkson took further creative control for her third studio album, ''[[My December]]'' (2007), by co-writing all of its tracks and becoming its executive producer. However, her label was dissatisfied with the album's darker [[rock music]] and promoted it reluctantly.<ref name="Rolling Stone 1">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/kelly-clarkson/biography |title=Kelly Clarkson Biography |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Media LLC |access-date=September 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709081245/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/kelly-clarkson/biography |archive-date=July 9, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Clarkson's fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[All I Ever Wanted (album)|All I Ever Wanted]]'' (2009) and ''[[Stronger (Kelly Clarkson album)|Stronger]]'' (2011), returned to a lighter tone and pop rock sound, with the former becoming her second US number-one album, and the latter making her the first artist to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]] twice. Both albums spawned a Hot 100 number-one single as well: "[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]", which holds the record for the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Biggest jump to number one|biggest jump to number one]] in the charts history, and "[[Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)]]", which became her best-selling single worldwide. Clarkson then became the first American female artist to release the [[List of best-selling Christmas/holiday albums in the United States|best-selling holiday album of the year]] with ''[[Wrapped in Red]]'' (2013). Her seventh studio album, ''[[Piece by Piece (Kelly Clarkson album)|Piece by Piece]]'' (2015), debuted at number-one in the US, while its [[Piece by Piece (song)|title track]] reached the top ten. After leaving RCA and signing with [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] in 2016, Clarkson released her [[Soul music|soul]]-influenced eighth album, ''[[Meaning of Life (album)|Meaning of Life]]'' (2017), which was promoted by her [[Meaning of Life Tour|highest-grossing tour]] to date. She went on to release her ninth studio album and second Christmas album, ''[[When Christmas Comes Around...]]'' (2021).

Clarkson has sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide. She has 11 top-ten singles in the US, and nine top-ten singles in the UK, Canada, and Australia. She became the first artist in history to top each of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Pop Songs|pop]], [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|adult contemporary]], [[Adult Top 40|adult pop]], [[Country music|country]], and [[Dance Club Songs|dance]] charts. Clarkson has served as a coach on ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]'' since its [[The Voice (American season 14)|fourteenth season]], and since 2019, has hosted her own talk show, ''[[The Kelly Clarkson Show]]''. Among her [[List of awards and nominations received by Kelly Clarkson|numerous accolades]], Clarkson has received three [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, four [[American Music Award]]s, two [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], and three [[Daytime Emmy Awards]]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' has hailed Clarkson as "one of pop music's greatest singers",<ref name="greatest" /> and honored her with the [[Billboard Women in Music|Powerhouse Award]] for her vocals, while [[VH1]] ranked her nineteenth on their list of the [[The Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest Women in Music]].

You've got to sing. You're destined to sing." Clarkson continued singing and soon started classical training, hoping music would be her ticket to a college scholarship. Upon graduating from high school, Clarkson was offered full scholarships to the [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[University of North Texas]], and [[Berklee College of Music]], but she declined them, explaining: "I've already written so much music and wanted to try a career on my own" adding, "you're never too old to go to college."<ref name="MTV Romania" />

After graduation, Clarkson worked several jobs to finance a demo, recording material and trying to market it to record labels, but she received little response. Clarkson turned down two recording contracts from [[Jive Records]] and [[Interscope Records]], saying, "They would have completely pigeonholed me as a bubblegum act.<ref name="FOX News Biography" /> I was confident enough that something better would come along."<ref name="People 1" /> In 2001, she traveled to Los Angeles, trying to pursue a career in music.

Upon returning to Burleson, Clarkson was encouraged by her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series ''[[American Idol|American Idol: The Search for a Superstar]]'' in May 2002. Despite receiving a "golden ticket", a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred to the inaugural season as "ghetto", explaining: "On our season we were like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever changing every day. They did one season of ''[[Pop Idol]]'' in the UK, but America is a very different market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'. I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess?

Immediately after winning ''American Idol'', Clarkson was signed to a record deal with [[RCA Records]], [[19 Recordings]], and [[S Records]] by talent manager [[Simon Fuller]], who created ''American Idol'', and music mogul [[Clive Davis]], who was slated to executive-produce her debut album. On September 17, 2002, her debut double-A-side single, "[[Before Your Love]]"/"[[A Moment Like This]]", was released. Both songs were performed by Clarkson during the season finale of ''American Idol''. After debuting at number 60 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, the single climbed to number 52 the following week, and subsequently ascended to number one.

[[File:Kelly Clarkson in Canberra, 2005 (3).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Clarkson during her Hazel Eyes concert tour on November 15, 2005, [[Canberra]], Australia]]
Trying to distance herself from her ''American Idol'' image, Clarkson decided to part ways with Fuller and [[19 Entertainment|19 Management]] and hired the services of talent manager [[Jeff Kwatinetz]] of [[The Firm, Inc.|The Firm]]. She reinvented her musical direction by developing a more rock-oriented sound with her second studio album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]''. Davis served as the executive producer for the record, while Clarkson co-wrote six of the tracks with pop and rock songwriters such as former [[Evanescence]] band members [[Ben Moody]] and [[David Hodges]], [[Kara DioGuardi]], [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Max Martin]]. ''Breakaway'' received critical acclaim, with Erlewine of ''AllMusic'' remarking: "What gives ''Breakaway'' its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off, and they are the tracks that illustrate Clarkson is a rare thing in the 2000s: a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream."<ref name="AllMusic – Breakaway">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/breakaway-mw0000633392 |title=Breakaway — Kelly Clarkson : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |work=AllMusic |publisher=Rovi Corporation |access-date=September 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008052506/http://www.allmusic.com/album/breakaway-mw0000633392 |archive-date=October 8, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>
