'''Sunset Rollercoaster''' ({{zh|c=落日飛車}} ''Luòrì fēichē'') is a 5-piece [[jazz]]-influenced [[synth-pop]] band from [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] consisting of Kuo-Hung Tseng (vocals, guitar), Hung-Li Chen (bass), Shao-Hsuan Wang (keyboard), Tsun-Lung Lo (drums), Hao-Ting Huang (saxophone), and former member Shih-Wei Huang (percussion). The name originated from a [[Photo Booth]] picture the group had taken for their [[MySpace]] profile in the 2009, which had a rollercoaster in front of a sunset as the background.<ref name="db">{{cite news|url=https://dbknews.com/2019/10/14/sunset-rollercoaster-taiwan-soul-funk-taipei-washington-dc-concert-review|title=Review: Sunset Rollercoaster’s Pie Shop concert was out of this world|last=Vukmanovic|first=Iris|work=[[The Diamondback]]|date=October 14, 2019|access-date=May 25, 2020}}</ref><ref name="db2">{{cite web|url=https://dbknews.com/2019/10/03/sunset-rollercoaster-taiwanese-washington-dc-sold-out-show-preview/|title=Preview: Taiwanese Sunset Rollercoaster performing to sold-out show in D.C.|date=October 3, 2019|last=Vukmanovic|first=Iris|access-date=May 26, 2020|work=[[The Diamondback]]}}</ref> The band mostly sings in English, despite being based in a Mandarin-speaking country, which, according to lead singer Kuo Kuo, is to allow them to speak indirectly and allow audiences to discern their own meaning.<ref name="herald" />

The idea for the band was inspired by [[Velvet Underground]] videos that lead singer Kuo found on the internet. The band formed in 2009 as a trio composed of Tseng Kuo Hung, Kevin Lee and Lo Zun Long, released their debut album ''Bossa Nova'' in 2011, but then disbanded shortly afterward.
