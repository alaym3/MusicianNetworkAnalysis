'''Bring Me the Horizon''' (often abbreviated as '''BMTH''') are <!-- Per WP:ENGVAR, British English treats collective nouns plural. Please don't change this to "is" without discussion on the talk page (click "talk" tab at top of page). --> a British [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Sheffield]] in 2004. The group consists of lead vocalist [[Oliver Sykes]], guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt Kean, drummer Matt Nicholls and keyboardist Jordan Fish. They are signed to [[RCA Records]] globally and [[Columbia Records]] exclusively in the United States.

The band released their debut album ''[[Count Your Blessings (Bring Me the Horizon album)|Count Your Blessings]]'' in 2006. Upon release, the album's sound polarised listeners, and was met with critical disdain. The band began to break away from their controversial sound with ''[[Suicide Season]]'' (2008), which was a creative, critical and commercial turning point for the band. Bring Me the Horizon released their third album, ''[[There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let's Keep It a Secret.]]'', in 2010, propelling them to greater international fame, whilst incorporating influences from [[classical music]], [[electronica]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Their major label debut, ''[[Sempiternal (album)|Sempiternal]]'' (2013) achieved Gold certification in Australia (35,000) and Silver in the United Kingdom (60,000). ''[[That's the Spirit]]'' (2015) debuted at number two in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/stereophonics-bag-sixth-number-1-album-with-keep-the-village-alive-thank-you-all-__10769/|title=Stereophonics bag sixth Number 1 album: "Thank you all"|work=Official Charts Company|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918161819/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/stereophonics-bag-sixth-number-1-album-with-keep-the-village-alive-thank-you-all-__10769/|archive-date=18 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BRING ME THE HORIZON's 'That's The Spirit' Lands At No. 2 On The Billboard 200 Chart|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizons-thats-the-spirit-lands-at-no-2-on-the-billboard-200-chart/|work=Blabbermouth|date=1 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630211854/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizons-thats-the-spirit-lands-at-no-2-on-the-billboard-200-chart/|archive-date=30 June 2017}}</ref> Their sixth studio album ''[[Amo (Bring Me the Horizon album)|Amo]]'' (2019) became their first UK chart topper.

Awards]], including two for Best British Band and one for Best Live Band, and have been nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s.

The style of their early work, including their debut album ''Count Your Blessings'', has been described primarily as [[deathcore]], but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of [[metalcore]] on later albums. Furthermore, ''That's the Spirit'' marked a shift in their sound to less aggressive rock music styles.<ref name="BLABBERMOUTH.NET">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-to-release-thats-the-spirit-album/|title=Bring Me The Horizon To Release 'That's The Spirit' Album In September|work=Blabbermouth.net|date=21 July 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722211957/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-to-release-thats-the-spirit-album/|archive-date=22 July 2015}}</ref> ''Amo'' saw a shift into different genres, such as [[electronica]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/bring_me_the_horizon-amo|title=Bring Me the Horizon amo|work=Exclaim!|last=Wojcicki|first=Lukas|date=24 January 2019|access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref><ref name="loudwire">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/why-did-bring-me-the-horizon-go-pop/|title=Why Did Bring Me the Horizon Go Pop?|website=Loudwire|access-date=25 January 2019}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and early releases (2002–2006)===
<!-- The use of 2002 instead of 2004 in the title is to point out any information about the members prior to the formation of the band. Example article: The Clash -->
{{Main|This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For}}
Bring Me the Horizon's founding members came from diverse musical backgrounds within metal and rock. Matt Nicholls and [[Oliver Sykes]] had a common interest in American [[metalcore]] such as [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]] and [[Skycamefalling]], and used to attend local [[hardcore punk]] shows. They later met Lee Malia, who spoke with them about [[thrash metal]] and [[melodic death metal]] bands like [[Metallica]] and [[At the Gates]]; Malia had also been part of a Metallica tribute band before meeting the pair.{{sfn|Patterson|2011|p=45}} Bring Me the Horizon officially formed in March 2004, when the members were aged 15 to 17.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=50}} Curtis Ward, who also lived in the [[Rotherham]] area, joined Sykes, Malia and Nicholls on drums. Bassist Matt Kean, who was in other local bands, completed the line-up.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} Their name is paraphrased from a line of dialogue spoken by [[Captain Jack Sparrow]] in the 2003 film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''.<ref name="spin nov2010">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.spin.com/2010/11/why-theyre-called-bring-me-horizon/|title=Why They're Called...

In the months following their formation, Bring Me the Horizon created a demo album titled ''Bedroom Sessions''. They followed this by releasing their first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For]]'', in September 2004 through local UK label Thirty Days of Night Records.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} Bring Me the Horizon were the label's first signing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/directory/labels/Thirty_Days_Of_Night_Records|title=Thirty Days Of Night Records|work=[[Drowned in Sound]]|access-date=6 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214223/http://drownedinsound.com/directory/labels/Thirty_Days_Of_Night_Records|archive-date=4 October 2013}}</ref> It was recorded at Pristine Studios in Nottingham over the course of two weekends, with drums and bass guitar laid down over the first weekend, and guitars and vocals completed a week later.<ref name="rockfreaks 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockfreaks.net/interviews/225|title=Bring Me the Horizon Bassist Discusses Guitarist's Departure|access-date=2 January 2012|date=11 February 2011|first=Aleksi|last=Pertola|publisher=RockFreaks.net|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406201617/http://www.rockfreaks.net/interviews/225|archive-date=6 April 2012}}</ref>

UK label [[Visible Noise]] noticed the band after the release of their EP,{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} and signed them for a four-album deal, in addition to re-releasing the EP in January 2005.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} The re-release gained the band significant attention, eventually peaking at No. 41 on the UK album charts.<ref name="zobbel.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_B.HTM|title=Chart Log UK Darren B – David Byrne|author=Darren B, David Byrne|access-date=30 June 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226170502/http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_B.HTM|archive-date=26 December 2009}}</ref> The band was later awarded Best British Newcomer at the [[Kerrang!

The band's first tour was supporting [[The Red Chord]] across the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} As with other early tours, they were able to get this slot by tricking venue promoters. Kean and Oliver's mother Carol Sykes were the de facto managers of the band at this time, a role they continued to occupy until 2008.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} For The Red Chord support, Kean emailed promoters and pretended they were opening on all the dates, when they were supposed to play only at their local show. This led them to being booked for the whole tour. In another case, Sykes created an e-mail account in the name of [[Johnny Truant]] vocalist Oliver Mitchell, which he used to contact a promoter requesting Bring Me the Horizon on their tour.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} Alcohol consumption fuelled their live performances in their early history when the band would get so drunk they vomited on stage and damaged their equipment.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}}

===''Count Your Blessings'' (2006–2007)===
{{Main|Count Your Blessings (Bring Me the Horizon album)|l1=Count Your Blessings}}
[[File:Bring-Me-The-Horizon.jpg|thumb|right|Bring Me the Horizon in Vienna]]
The band released their debut album ''[[Count Your Blessings (Bring Me the Horizon album)|Count Your Blessings]]'' in October 2006 in the United Kingdom and in August 2007 in the United States. They rented a house in the country to write songs, but easily became distracted. They then recorded the album in inner-city Birmingham, a process which was infamous for their excessive and dangerous drinking. During this period drummer Nicholls summarised it saying "we were out every night, just being regular 18-year-olds".{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=67}} Critics panned the album adding to the strongly polarised responses the band were already seeing from the public.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=50}}

They supported ''Count Your Blessings'' by going on a lengthy headline tour of the UK in November,<ref name="Dis-party music">{{cite web | url = http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/1263353 | title = Bring Me The Horizon: "It's just party music" | author = Raziq Rauf | publisher = [[Drowned In Sound]] | date = 6 November 2006 | access-date = 7 August 2014 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014072647/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/1263353 | archive-date = 14 October 2013 }}</ref> and immediately followed this joining [[Lostprophets]] and [[The Blackout (band)|The Blackout]] on a UK tour<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gigwise.com/article.php?contentid=25949 |title=Saturday 09/12/06 Lostprophets, Bring Me The Horizon, The Blackout @ Hammersmith Apollo, London |publisher=[[Gig Wise]] |author=Caroline Jones |date=13 December 2006 |access-date=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609025336/http://www.gigwise.com/article.php?contentid=25949 |archive-date=9 June 2011  }}</ref> through late November and December 2006.

In January 2007, Bring Me the Horizon were able to set their sights beyond the UK, when they replaced [[Bury Your Dead]] on [[Killswitch Engage]]'s European headline tour. The slot became available after Bury Your Dead were forced to withdraw by the departure from the band of their vocalist, Mat Bruso.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=64899|title=Bring Me the Horizon Replaces Bury Your Dead On Killswitch Engage's European Tour|publisher=Road Runner|date=7 January 2007|access-date=29 October 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606175154/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=64899|archive-date=6 June 2011}}</ref> Bring Me the Horizon's presence on the tour was poorly received by fans of Killswitch Engage, with concert attendees regularly [[Bottling (concert abuse)|throwing bottles]] at the band before they even started playing their set.{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=54}}

===''Suicide Season'' and Ward's departure (2008–2009)===
{{Main|Suicide Season}}
Bring Me the Horizon recorded their second studio album, ''[[Suicide Season]]'', in Sweden with producer [[Fredrik Nordström]]. He was unimpressed with their first album and was initially absent from the recording sessions unless he needed to be there. Nordström later heard the new sound they were experimenting with during a recording session and became very involved in the record.{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=56}} It was promoted virally in the weeks before its release with the promotional tag line "September is Suicide Season."<ref name="September is Suicide Season">{{cite web|url=http://news.mibba.com/Music/1232/September-Is-Suicide-Season|title=September Is 'Suicide Season'|access-date=18 July 2011|date=28 July 2008|publisher=mibba|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007050808/http://news.mibba.com/Music/1232/September-Is-Suicide-Season|archive-date=7 October 2011}}</ref> To promote ''Suicide Season'' the band embarked on their first headline tour of the United States, as well as appearing at the 2008 [[Warped Tour]].

In April 2011, Bring Me the Horizon embarked on a European tour, starting in the United Kingdom. They toured with [[Parkway Drive]] and [[Architects (British band)|Architects]] as main support bands, with [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]] as the opening support for the UK and dubstep group Tek-One. The tour, however, was not without its hindrances. On 28 April, Nicholls broke his arm whilst playing football with members of Bring Me the Horizon, Parkway Drive and Architects. Instead of cancelling the tour, Architects' drummer Dan Searle filled in as drummer, but this meant that Bring Me the Horizon's setlist was halved in length.<ref name="mattbreaks arm">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/bring-me-the-horizon-drummer-breaks-arm/|title=Bring Me The Horizon Drummer Breaks Arm|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|first=James|last=Gill|date=28 April 2008|access-date=16 July 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706000649/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/bring-me-the-horizon-drummer-breaks-arm/|archive-date=6 July 2011}}</ref> The tour was extended with a North American leg from 13 August to 4 October, retaining Parkway Drive and Architects and adding [[Deez Nuts (band)|Deez Nuts]] to the line up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2011/07/bring-me-horizon-us-tour-w-parkway.html|title=Alter the Press!: Bring Me The Horizon US Tour w/ Parkway Drive|first=Jon|last=Ableson|publisher=Alter The Press!|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004235253/http://www.alterthepress.com/2011/07/bring-me-horizon-us-tour-w-parkway.html|archive-date=4 October 2013}}</ref> On 23 August they released the fourth music video and single, "Visions",<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/top-posts/new-bring-me-the-horizon-video-online/|title=Metal Hammer – Blog Archive – New Bring Me The Horizon Video Online|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|first=James|last=Gill|date=24 August 2011|access-date=24 August 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925072443/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/top-posts/new-bring-me-the-horizon-video-online/|archive-date=25 September 2012}}</ref> and on 31 October the music video for the song "Alligator Blood" was released.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://50.97.158.82/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=165433 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223806/http://50.97.158.82/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=165433 |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 October 2013 |title=Bring Me the Horizon: 'Alligator Blood' Video Released |work=[[Blabbermouth]] |date=31 October 2011 }}</ref>

===Songwriting and recording process===
In all the band's album notes, all of Bring Me the Horizon's lyrics are said to be written by lead vocalist [[Oliver Sykes]] while all five members—as a band—were credited with writing the music. With the exception of ''Count Your Blessings'', the band has always written in a secluded location to avoid being distracted.<ref name="UG-Lee Guitar interview" /> Oliver Sykes' lyrics have a strong feeling of [[catharsis]] for him. He mainly draws from personal experience and has described the band's live performances as [[therapeutic]].<ref name="CANOE-horizons broadened" /> In 2006, when asked about the lyrics of ''Count Your Blessings'', as they had been criticised for their content solely fixated on [[broken heart|heartbreak]] and other themes that were called "shallow and meaningless", he responded "My life's never been that bad so I've not got that much to talk about."<ref name="Dis-party music"/>
Band members have described how the debut album was written in inner-city areas of [[Birmingham]] while being pressured to write and record songs to the deadlines given.<ref name="rockfreaks 1"/> This resulted in the band being unimpressed with the final product. However, for the writing process of ''Suicide Season'', the band realised that they much preferred picking areas with less human contact in order to focus on the music; they wrote their second album in the Swedish countryside.<ref name="CANOE-expands horizons" /> During the writing of ''Suicide Season'', former and founding rhythm guitarist Curtis Ward wrote only two riffs of his rhythm parts of the album, mostly relying on Lee Malia to write all of the guitar sections of the album.<ref name="rockfreaks 1"/>

Lee Malia has stated that the typical writing process involves Oliver Sykes writing the main structure of the songs, followed by Malia writing the main riff. From this they would collaborate with each other to structure their work better and then later include the rest of the band in writing the rest of the song.<ref name="UG-Lee Guitar interview" /> The writing dynamic of ''Sempiternal'', typically featured Sykes, Malia and newly introduced member Jordan Fish. Malia felt that with Fish's influence on the record he was pushed to create more inspired guitar riffs.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As they all took a break before writing their fourth album, they felt less of a need for an isolated writing environment.<ref name="Guardian-2013 interview">{{cite web | url = http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/02/22/bring-me-the-horizon-this-album-needs-to-be-the-one-that-lasts-forever/ | title = Bring Me The Horizon: This album needs to be the one that lasts forever | first = Ed | last = Cooper | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = ([[Guardian Media Group]]) | date = 22 February 2013 | access-date = 26 February 2013 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151023041236/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/02/22/bring-me-the-horizon-this-album-needs-to-be-the-one-that-lasts-forever/ | archive-date = 23 October 2015 }}</ref>

The band's image fit into what was called [[scene (subculture)|scene fashion]].{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=54}}<ref name="Kerrang 1501"/> The effect of their fashion aesthetics showed people, in show promoter Iain Scott's perspective, that "you don't have to look like a diabolical metalhead to be into metal or play in a metal band".{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=54}} However, their fashion conscious appearance earned them a "style over substance" label.{{sfn|Patterson|2011|p=45}}

Many controversies that occurred in their early years greatly affected public perceptions of the band, particularly an incident in 2007 at [[Nottingham]]'s [[Rock City (club)|Rock City]] venue, when a female fan claimed that Oliver Sykes had urinated on her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=70554|title=BRING ME THE HORIZON Vocalist Accused Of Urinating On Fan|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828052238/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=70554|archive-date=28 August 2007}}</ref> The charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence from CCTV footage in the area.{{sfn|Patterson|2011|p=47}} There were several documented examples of violence against the band during their live shows, including Sykes being [[pepper spray]]ed on stage;<ref name="RS-classic BFMV"/> and people getting onstage to assault the band.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/bring_me_the_horizon_trade_blows_with_audience_members_in_salt_lake_city | title = Bring Me The Horizon trade blows with audience members in Salt Lake City | first = Scott | last = Heisel | work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] | date = 4 October 2011 | access-date = 5 March 2012 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111209131017/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/bring_me_the_horizon_trade_blows_with_audience_members_in_salt_lake_city | archive-date = 9 December 2011 }}</ref>

Their third album (2010's ''There Is a Hell...'') was seen as a significant turning point in altering public perception of the band.{{sfn|Patterson|2011|p=47}}{{why?|date=February 2018}}

Despite the controversy over their image, various journalists have credited the band as being one of the most forward-thinking heavy bands in the UK.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=52}} In 2012, just four years after the release of ''Suicide Season'', the album was inducted into [[Rock Sound]]'s ''Hall of Fame'', credited as a significant influence on the works of [[Asking Alexandria]], The Ghost Inside and [[While She Sleeps]]. It was credited as an influence on metalcore contemporaries Architects on ''[[Hollow Crown]]'' with their incorporation of keyboards and programming, and The Devil Wears Prada's ''[[Dead Throne]]'' for its more experimental and opinion-dividing sound.{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=56}}

The band caused further controversy in February 2016 when Oliver Sykes trashed [[Coldplay]]'s table at the 2016 [[NME Awards]] during a live performance of Bring Me the Horizon's track "Happy Song".<ref name=":0">{{cite magazine|title = Bring Me the Horizon: Destroying Coldplay's NME Table Wasn't 'Protest'|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bring-me-the-horizon-destroying-coldplays-nme-table-wasnt-protest-20160219|magazine = Rolling Stone|access-date = 20 February 2016|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160220091036/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bring-me-the-horizon-destroying-coldplays-nme-table-wasnt-protest-20160219|archive-date = 20 February 2016}}</ref> Although some people{{who|date=February 2019}} thought the table trashing was because of a prior feud between the two bands relating to similar album artwork, Sykes later stated that the act was not an act of "dirty protest", and suggested that it was "pure coincidence" that Coldplay were sitting at the table he trampled.<ref name=":0" /> Coldplay frontman [[Chris Martin]] admitted that he had never even heard of Bring Me the Horizon before the incident and he laughed it off, stating that "it was great, very 'rock and roll'".<ref>{{cite web|title = Watch This Metal Band Trash Coldplay's Table At The 2016 NME Awards|url = http://uproxx.com/music/coldplay-bring-me-the-horizon-nme-awards-trashing-table/|website = UPROXX|access-date = 20 February 2016|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160219101937/http://uproxx.com/music/coldplay-bring-me-the-horizon-nme-awards-trashing-table/|archive-date = 19 February 2016}}</ref>
