==History==

=== 2013–2014: Career beginnings, ''Depth Chart'' and ''Cooler Colors'' ===

Injury Reserve was formed in 2013 by producer Parker Corey and rappers Stepa J. Groggs, and Ritchie with a T after Groggs was featured on Ritchie's mixtape produced by Corey. Ritchie first met Corey through a mutual friend in high school after looking for producers, and met Groggs in middle school when Groggs was working at a [[Foot Locker]] store in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].

In 2013, the group released ''Depth Chart'', their 15-track debut concept mixtape. There was a music video released for "Harvey Dent" to promote the project.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stechnij|first=Tanner|date=30 March 2018|title=The Rise of Injury Reserve|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/injury-reserve-10270503|url-status=live|access-date=2 October 2021|website=Phoenix New Times}}</ref> Most tracks were based on the premise of a basketball player being drafted. It was released through digital platforms such as [[Audiomack]], but was delisted after the subsequent media attention from 2015's ''Live from the Dentist Office''. It was a relatively unknown release with very little press or media attention, garnering them not much of an audience.

In 2014, the group released ''Cooler Colors'', a 7-track EP, led by singles, "Black Sheep", "Groundhog Day", and "How Bout You".<ref name=":0" /> It was released through digital platforms such as Audiomack, but was delisted in the same fashion as ''Depth Chart''. The group doesn't refer to these projects as their debuts, and instead refers to ''Live from the Dentist Office'' as their debut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thedailytexan.com/2016/03/11/qa-rap-trio-injury-reserve-discusses-how-they-found-their-sound-and-separate-themselves/|title = Q&A: Rap trio Injury Reserve discusses how they found their sound and separate themselves from the pack|date = 18 September 2021}}</ref>

{{Quote box 
| quote = Cooler Colors was mostly us trying to replicate our favorite artists, and we found that really corny. When me and Parker critique people, we’ll say “Oh that guy sounds like this guy” and then we were realized we’re total hypocrites. ''Live from the Dentist'' was us finding our own sound, and that’s why we call that the first actual Injury Reserve project, because the music’s original and it gets at our personalities.

In an interview with ''[[Huck (magazine)|Huck Magazine]]'', interviewer Thomas Hobbs asked Ritchie with a T if the group could continue without Stepa J.

We're still figuring it out... We've not had an explicit conversation about continuing the group, but me and Parker will continue to create together [in some capacity]."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-15|title=‘He was the heart of the band’: Injury Reserve on a future without Groggs|url=https://www.huckmag.com/art-and-culture/music-2/injury-reserve-on-a-future-without-groggs/|access-date=2021-09-19|website=Huck Magazine}}</ref>
