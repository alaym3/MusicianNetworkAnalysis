'''Vio-lence''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band formed in 1985 in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Throughout its existence, they released [[demo (music)|demo]] tapes, one [[Extended play|EP]] and three [[studio album]]s. Vio-lence is best-known for their association with the 1980s [[Bay Area thrash metal]] scene, and often credited as one of the leading lights of the second wave of the genre, along with [[Pantera]], [[Sepultura]], [[Sacred Reich]], [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]] and [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]] as well as their Bay Area counterparts [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Death Angel]] and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/thrash-metal-book-due-in-september/|title='Thrash Metal' Book Due In September|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=June 24, 2007|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostcultmag.com/news-thrash-legend-sean-killian-of-vio-lence-has-stage-4-liver-disease/|title=Thrash Metal Legend Sean Killian of Vio-lence Diagnosed With Stage 4 Liver Disease|website=Ghostcultmag.com|date=June 27, 2017|access-date=September 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/01/19/thrash-metal-greats-unite-for-a-good-cause/|title=Thrash-Metal Greats Unite For A Good Cause|website=[[KPIX-TV|Sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com]]|date=January 20, 2018|access-date=September 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/israel/music/testament|title=Testament - Music in Israel|website=Timeout.com|date=March 4, 2018|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockencadena.home.blog/2019/06/05/programa-no8|title=Programa Nº8 – Rock en Cadena|website=rockencadena.home.blog|access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref> The band has also been referred to as one of the so-called "Big Six of Bay Area thrash metal", alongside [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], Testament, Death Angel, [[Lååz Rockit]] and Forbidden.<ref>https://metaladdicts.com/is-a-big-6-of-bay-area-thrash-metal-tour-in-the-works-never-say-never-says-vio-lence-guitarist/</ref><ref>https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/community_feed/the_big_6_of_bay_area_thrash_metal_tour_or_show_might_happen_one_day.html</ref>

Vio-lence's most stable line-up was [[Phil Demmel]] and [[Robb Flynn]] on guitars, Deen Dell on bass, Perry Strickland on drums and Sean Killian on vocals; this lineup recorded all their studio albums. After breaking up in 1994 and reforming for occasional live performances from 2001 to 2003, the members of Vio-Lence reunited in January 2018 for a benefit of Killian, who was battling with liver [[cirrhosis]].<ref name="killian benefit">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/testament-exodus-death-angel-members-and-others-to-perform-at-benefit-concert-for-vio-lences-sean-killian/|title=TESTAMENT, EXODUS, DEATH ANGEL Members And Others To Perform At Benefit Concert For VIO-LENCE's SEAN KILLIAN|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=November 6, 2017|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref> The band announced their third reunion in January 2019.<ref name="oakland show">{{cite web|title=VIO-LENCE To Reunite For One Show In Oakland; 'Eternal Nightmare' To Be Performed In Its Entirety |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vio-lence-to-reunite-for-one-show-in-oakland-eternal-nightmare-to-be-performed-in-its-entirety/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=January 8, 2019|date=January 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name="alcatraz show">{{cite web|title=Reunited VIO-LENCE To Play Exclusive European Show At Belgium's ALCATRAZ HARD ROCK & METAL FESTIVAL|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/reunited-vio-lence-to-play-exclusive-european-show-at-belgiums-alcatraz-hard-rock-metal-festival/|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=February 16, 2019|date=February 16, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
===Early days===
Vio-lence, then-called Death Penalty, was formed in 1985 with the line-up of Jerry Birr (vocals), Phil Demmel (guitar), Troy Fua (guitar), Eddie Billy (bass – brother of musicians Andy and [[Chuck Billy (vocalist)|Chuck Billy]]) and Perry Strickland (drums).<ref name="vio-lence timeline">{{cite web|title=VIO-LENCE - OFFICIAL WEBSITE|url=http://vio-lence.com:80/band_timeline.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811192527/http://vio-lence.com:80/band_timeline.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 11, 2013|website=Vio-lence.com|access-date=August 9, 2018}}</ref> Not long after playing their first gig, which reportedly took place at a [[house party]], Death Penalty changed their name to Violence and eventually then to Vio-lence, as the former was taken by another band. After recording two demos in 1986, they parted ways with Birr, Fua and Billy, who were replaced by Sean Killian, Robb Flynn (formerly of Forbidden Evil) and Deen Dell respectively. Their live success at local clubs in Northern California – opening for bands like [[D.R.I. (band)|D.R.I.]], [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], [[Kreator]], [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]] and the [[Mentors (band)|Mentors]], as well as their [[Bay Area thrash metal]] peers Testament, [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Death Angel]], [[Lȧȧz Rockit]] and [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]] – allowed Vio-lence to record another demo, this time for major labels, including [[MCA Records]]' sister label Mechanic, who offered them a recording contract.{{r|vio-lence timeline}}<ref name="vio-lence bio">{{cite web|title=VIO-LENCE - OFFICIAL WEBSITE|url=http://www.vio-lence.com:80/band.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809043407/http://www.vio-lence.com:80/band.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 9, 2013|website=Vio-lence.com|access-date=August 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web|title=Vio-Lence|url=http://metallipromo.com/vio.html|website=Metallipromo.com|access-date=August 9, 2018}}</ref>

From February to April 1988, Vio-lence recorded their debut album, ''[[Eternal Nightmare (Vio-lence album)|Eternal Nightmare]]'', at two studios: The Music Grinder in Los Angeles and [[Alpha & Omega Recording|Alpha & Omega]] in San Francisco. The album received mostly positive reviews upon its release in the summer of 1988, and peaked at number 154 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], becoming the band's only album to enter that chart;<ref>[[Joel Whitburn]], ''The Billboard Albums''. 6th edn, p. 1105.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/violence/chart-history|title=Violence Chart History|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]]|access-date=August 9, 2018}}</ref> this can be attributed to the album selling over 30,000 copies.{{r|vio-lence timeline}} Vio-lence toured throughout 1988 and 1989 in support of ''Eternal Nightmare'', with bands such as Testament, Voivod, [[Death Angel]], [[Sanctuary (band)|Sanctuary]], [[Nuclear Assault]], [[D.R.I. (band)|D.R.I.]], [[M.O.D.]] and the [[Cro-Mags]].{{r|vio-lence timeline|vio-lence bio|metallipromo}} The underground success of the album also caught the attention of several labels, including [[Megaforce Records]] (then-home to bands such as Testament, M.O.D., [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]]), who eventually signed the band.{{r|vio-lence timeline|vio-lence bio}}

In December 1989, Vio-lence entered the studio to record what would be their second album and only release on Megaforce (distributed by [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]) ''[[Oppressing the Masses]]''; however, the album faced multiple delays until its release in the summer of 1990.{{r|vio-lence timeline|vio-lence bio|metallipromo}} Although the album's success did not match that of ''Eternal Nightmare'', it received some positive reviews and a video for the song "World in a World" was released. ''Oppressing the Masses'' also generated some controversy, when the original album (which reportedly sold only 20,000 copies) was destroyed because of Atlantic's objection to the lyrical content of "Torture Tactics";{{r|vio-lence timeline|vio-lence bio}} as a result, the album was reprinted without this track. Vio-lence toured in support of the album for about a year, with bands such as Overkill, Exodus, Forbidden, Flotsam and Jetsam, [[Prong (band)|Prong]], [[Defiance (metal band)|Defiance]] and [[Rigor Mortis (band)|Rigor Mortis]].{{r|metallipromo}}

In 1991, after being dropped from Atlantic/Megaforce, Vio-lence released an EP ''[[Torture Tactics]]'', which included three studio songs (recorded in 1989 during the sessions of ''Oppressing the Masses'') and one "live" track from 1988. Internal conflicts in 1992 resulted in the departure of Robb Flynn who would move on to form [[groove metal]] band [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]].{{r|vio-lence timeline}} A year later, Vio-lence released their third and final album, ''[[Nothing to Gain]]'', which was actually recorded in 1990. They never toured in support of that album, and Strickland left the band after its release.{{r|vio-lence timeline}}

===Breakup===
After an attempt to make a fourth album, and performing what would be their final show for eight years on December 18, 1993, with a new lineup in San Francisco, Vio-lence split up.{{r|vio-lence timeline|vio-lence bio|metallipromo}}

Phil Demmel, Deen Dell, Ray Vegas and Mark Hernandez formed a groove/thrash metal band called [[Torque (band)|Torque]] which disbanded after releasing a studio album and playing several live shows. Demmel then went to form Technocracy.

Robb Flynn has been the guitarist and singer of Machine Head since its inception in 1991. Demmel joined Machine Head in 2003, first as a session guitarist and later becoming a full-time member of the band; he would stay in Machine Head until his departure in 2018.<ref name="final tour">{{cite web|title=MACHINE HEAD's PHIL DEMMEL And DAVE MCCLAIN To Leave Band After One Final U.S. Tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/machine-heads-phil-demmel-and-dave-mcclain-to-leave-band-after-one-final-u-s-tour/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 28, 2018|access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref>

===Reunion===
Initially planning only a few shows as part of the tribute to Testament frontman Chuck Billy during the ''[[Thrash of the Titans]]'' benefit in 2001, the band decided to reunite with early guitarist Ray Vegas replacing Robb Flynn.

In addition to their 2005 re-release of ''[[Eternal Nightmare (Vio-lence album)|Eternal Nightmare]]'', the band released a 7-inch [[vinyl record]] containing two [[demo (music)|demo]] tracks from their original 1986 [[demo tape]] as well as one previously unreleased track. Only 1000 copies were produced and pressed by Bone Crusher Records.  The 7&nbsp;inch collectible was well marketed and advertised, but due to disagreements between the band and the Bone Crusher record producers, only Vio-lence was allowed to distribute and sell the 500 given to them by the producers. A deal was made to distribute a small quantity (about 100) through a [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] record store, the only known store to stock the item for sale to the public.

A [[DVD]] entitled ''Blood and Dirt'' was produced by Jerry Allen (Tales From The Pit video magazine) and released on August 8, 2006, through [[Megaforce Records|Megaforce]].

On November 6, 2017, it was announced that the members of Vio-Lence would reunite for a performance at "Killian on Command: An Evening of Vio-Lence", a benefit for the band's singer Sean Killian, who was diagnosed with stage four liver cirrhosis earlier that summer.{{r|killian benefit}} The benefit took place at The Midway in San Francisco, California on January 20, 2018, and included performances by the members of Vio-Lence and their [[Bay Area thrash metal]] peers Testament, Exodus, Death Angel, Forbidden and [[Mordred (band)|Mordred]].{{r|killian benefit}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/benefit-concert-for-vio-lences-sean-killian-moves-to-larger-venue/|title=Benefit Concert For VIO-LENCE's SEAN KILLIAN Moves To Larger Venue|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 9, 2018|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> The show concluded with a performance of "World in a World" featuring four-fifths of the ''Eternal Nightmare'' and ''Oppressing the Masses'' lineup; vocals were provided by Flynn instead of Killian, who did not perform due to his health condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/reunited-vio-lence-plus-members-of-testament-exodus-death-angel-forbidden-perform-at-killian-on-command-benefit-concert-video/|title=Reunited VIO-LENCE Plus Members Of TESTAMENT, EXODUS, DEATH ANGEL, FORBIDDEN Perform At 'Killian On Command' Benefit Concert (Video)|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 21, 2018|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> On November 11, 2018, Killian's wife Dana posted a photo on her personal Facebook page, cryptically confirming that her husband has recovered from his illness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10216033812390497&id=1604479193|title=Dana Rivero Killian|website=M.facebook.com|access-date=November 26, 2019}}</ref>

The possibility of a Vio-lence reunion was renewed in September 2018 when Flynn announced that guitarist Phil Demmel was leaving Machine Head after a farewell tour with then-current lineup of Flynn, Demmel, [[Jared MacEachern]] and [[Dave McClain (musician)|Dave McClain]];{{r|final tour}} at first it was speculated that Machine Head was actually breaking up, but Flynn announced shortly thereafter that he was going to continue the band with a new lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/longtime_members_phil_demmel__dave_mcclain_are_leaving_machine_head_after_one_final_tour.html|title=Longtime Members Phil Demmel & Dave McClain Are Leaving Machine Head After One Final Tour|website=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate-Guitar.com]]|date=September 29, 2018|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref>

Musical outlets reported in November 2018 that, following Demmel's departure from Machine Head, there were rumors Vio-lence would reform "in the not-too-distant future" for shows and possibly new music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/community_feed/vio-lence_will_there_be_a_reunion_now_that_phil_demmel_has_left_machine_head.html|title=Vio-Lence: Will There Be a Reunion Now That Phil Demmel Has Left Machine Head?|website=Ultimate-guitar.com|access-date=November 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metaladdicts.com/site/vio-lence-reunion-in-the-works/|title=VIO-LENCE Reunion In The Works?|date=November 26, 2018|website=Metaladdicts.com|access-date=November 26, 2019}}</ref>

On August 9, 2019, [[Bloodstock Open Air]] announced that Vio-lence would be playing their first ever and only UK show at the festival in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodstock.uk.com/news/bloodstock-announces-first-bands-for-2020|title=BLOODSTOCK announces first bands for 2020! - Bloodstock metal news|website=Bloodstock.uk.com|access-date=November 26, 2019}}</ref>

The members of Vio-lence have expressed their desire to write the follow-up to 1993's ''[[Nothing to Gain]]''. In an August 2019 interview with Australia's ''Heavy'' magazine, Demmel said, "Sean's itching to write some new music. I'm not itching as hard. I've got a lot on my plate. Vio-lence is definitely a priority, but that's just a step I haven't... It's hard, because you have this comeback, and then you play the songs, and you want to be good. I don't want to put out something that isn't as good as ''Eternal Nightmare'' or some of the songs from ''[[Oppressing the Masses|Oppressing]]''. I want to have something that's quality."<ref>{{cite web|title=PHIL DEMMEL Says VIO-LENCE Is Taking 'Delicate' Approach To Reunion: 'We're Still Kind Of Feeling Each Other Out'|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/phil-demmel-says-vio-lence-is-taking-delicate-approach-to-reunion-were-still-kind-of-feeling-each-other-out/|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=August 4, 2019|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> In an interview with Exodus frontman [[Steve Souza|Steve "Zetro" Souza]] on his "Toxic Vault" video channel, Killian stated, "Phil and I have talked a couple of times.

Killian also said that the other members of Vio-lence are interested in writing a new album; however, he concluded that "it's Phil and I that need to connect."<ref>{{cite web|title=SEAN KILLIAN Says He Would 'Love' To Write A New VIO-LENCE Album|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sean-killian-says-he-would-love-to-write-a-new-vio-lence-album/|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=September 10, 2019|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>
