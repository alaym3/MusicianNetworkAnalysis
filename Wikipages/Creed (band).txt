'''Creed''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Tallahassee, Florida]], formed in 1994. For most of its existence, the band consisted of lead vocalist [[Scott Stapp]], guitarist and vocalist [[Mark Tremonti]], bassist [[Brian Marshall]], and drummer [[Scott Phillips (musician)|Scott Phillips]]. Creed released two [[studio album]]s, ''[[My Own Prison]]'' in 1997 and ''[[Human Clay]]'' in 1999, before Marshall left the band in 2000. The band's third album, ''[[Weathered]]'', was released in 2001, with Tremonti on bass guitar. Creed disbanded in 2004; Stapp pursued a solo career while Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips founded the band [[Alter Bridge]] with [[Myles Kennedy]].

In 2009, Creed reunited for a fourth album, ''[[Full Circle (Creed album)|Full Circle]]'', then toured until 2012. Since then, Creed has been on hiatus while the instrumental members have remained active with Alter Bridge; Stapp has continued his solo career and joined the band [[Art of Anarchy]] in 2016. Tremonti also formed his own band, [[Tremonti (band)|Tremonti]], in 2011.

Creed is one of the prominent acts of the [[post-grunge]] movement that began in the mid-1990s. Becoming popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Creed released three consecutive [[music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]] albums, with their album ''Human Clay'' being [[RIAA certification|certified]] diamond. Creed has sold over 28 million records in the United States,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE4B08WX20081201 |work=Reuters |title=Rock act Creed in talks to reunite |date=December 1, 2008 |first=Jonathan|last=Cohen}}</ref> has sold over 53 million albums worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2014/2/11/269389/Creed-s-Scott-Stapp-From-Ruin-To-Redemption.aspx|title=Creed's Scott Stapp: From Ruin To Redemption|work=chattanoogan.com}}</ref> and was the ninth best-selling artist of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-extra-the-top-20-album-sellers-of-the-2000s.html |title=Yahoo Top 20 sellers of the 2000s |publisher=YahooMusic |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115034358/http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-extra-the-top-20-album-sellers-of-the-2000s.html |archive-date=January 15, 2012 }}</ref> However, Creed has been negatively received by some critics and listeners; readers of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked the band the worst artist of the 1990s.<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-ten-worst-bands-of-the-nineties-20130509/1-creed-0736783|title=Readers' Poll: The Ten Worst Bands of the Nineties|access-date=June 8, 2016|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

==History==

===Early years (1994–1996)===
[[file:Scott Stapp.jpg|thumb|upright|Founding member, vocalist [[Scott Stapp]]]]
Creed began in 1994 in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].<ref name="Stapp 2012">{{cite book |first=Scott |last=Stapp |title=Sinner's Creed |date=2012 |pages=97–98 |publisher=Tyndale House |isbn=9781414377216 |quote='What if we just call ourselves Creed?' I asked... At the time it was 1994, my sophomore year.}}</ref> Founding members vocalist [[Scott Stapp]] and guitarist [[Mark Tremonti]] had been classmates in high school and friends at [[Florida State University]].<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/creed-p278625/biography |title=Creed |website=[[AllMusic]] |first=Steve|last=Huey}}</ref> Stapp and Tremonti realized that they had a mutual love of writing music and performing. After multiple discussions and times spent writing songs, several of which addressed themes of [[Christianity|Christian theology]] and spirituality due to Stapp's religious background as the stepson of a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] minister, the duo held auditions that led to the recruitment of bassist [[Brian Marshall]], drummer [[Scott Phillips (musician)|Scott Phillips]], and rhythm guitarist Brian Brasher to complete the quintet. This five-piece line-up lasted through 1994, and Brasher left the band in 1995. Creed  decided to remain as a four-piece band. The four musicians had already written and collaborated on four of the songs that would go on to become tracks on Creed's chart-topping debut album, ''[[My Own Prison]]''. The band found local success and started to play shows in bars and small venues throughout Tallahassee. Stapp wrote in 2012 that Creed first performed as "Naked Toddler" at Yianni's in Tallahassee; the name was picked up by Tremonti from a headline in that day's newspaper, but the reaction that night to the name was negative. The group was trying to find inspiration for a better name when Marshall said he had been in a band called Mattox Creed. Stapp latched onto the Creed part, and the band agreed.<ref name="Stapp 2012"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTO2orJs3I| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211103/GNTO2orJs3I| archive-date=2021-11-03 | url-status=live|title=Creed's Scott Stapp - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|date=February 3, 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===''My Own Prison'' and rise to fame (1997–1998)===
Wanting "a real show at a club", they managed to persuade the owner of a bar in Tallahassee to book them by claiming that they could guarantee an audience of 200 people.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Joel_Mark_Interview.html |title=Interview With Joel Mark |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=October 9, 2000 |access-date=October 19, 2011}}</ref> Owner and manager [[Jeff Hanson (music executive)|Jeff Hanson]] later told [[HitQuarters]] that the band had played mostly cover versions, but two original songs stood out and impressed the manager so much that he promptly signed them to his management and promotions company and set about developing their act.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Jeff_Hanson_Interview.html |title=Interview With Jeff Hanson |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=September 13, 2010 |access-date=October 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904051946/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Jeff_Hanson_Interview.html |archive-date=September 4, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For their first recordings he matched the band up with [[John Kurzweg]], a producer and friend of Hanson's who he felt was an appropriate fit. Together they recorded their debut album for $6,000, which was funded by Hanson.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> The album, titled ''[[My Own Prison]]'', was initially self-released on their own label, Blue Collar Records, selling 6,000 copies throughout the state of Florida.

''My Own Prison'' had been circulating around the music industry for a while when, in May 1997, [[Diana Meltzer]] from [[Wind-Up Records]] heard the album for the first time and decided almost immediately that she wanted to sign them to the label,<ref name="hitquarters3">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Diana_Meltzer_int.html |title=Interview With Diana Meltzer |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=July 7, 2003 |access-date=October 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908185725/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Diana_Meltzer_int.html |archive-date=September 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which had recently dropped [[Baboon (band)|Baboon]] over the latter's reluctance to alter their image and sound to suit the label's demands. Meltzer later said that she heard "an arena band".<ref name="hitquarters3" /> Within the same week, Meltzer, together with Wind-up president Steve Lerner, CEO [[Alan Meltzer]], and [[artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative Joel Mark, flew to Tallahassee to see Creed perform live and decide for certain whether to offer them a contract. "Seeing the energy in the room when Scott Stapp stepped up to the mic, and hearing his powerful voice fill the room, alongside Mark Tremonti's now legendary guitar riffs and that big Creed anthemic rock sound, was all I needed," she told HitQuarters.<ref name="hitquarters3" /> According to Tremonti in his "Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction" video, Creed had been rejected by Arctic and Cherry Universal Records before Wind-Up flew down to sign them. The band has been signed with Wind-Up records ever since. Stapp and Marshall originally signed the contract in blood; causing it to need to be reprinted.<ref name="hitquarters.com" />{{Failed verification|date=July 2021}}
[[file:Brian Marshall from Creed.jpg|thumb|upright|Bassist Brian Marshall]]
''My Own Prison'' was remixed, given a more radio-friendly sound, and re-released by Wind-up Records in 1997. Four singles were released from the album: "[[My Own Prison (song)|My Own Prison]]", "Torn", "[[What's This Life For]]", and "[[One (Creed song)|One]]". Each of these songs reached No.&nbsp;1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, making Creed the first band to accomplish such a feat with a debut album.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> With little [[MTV]] exposure, media coverage, or label support, ''My Own Prison'' sold extremely well, moving over six million copies and going six times [[RIAA certification|platinum]]. Creed continued to top year-end charts and was recognized as the Rock Artist of the Year at the 1998 [[Billboard Music Award]]s. ''My Own Prison'' was also the highest-selling heavy music record of 1998 on [[Nielsen SoundScan]]'s Hard Music chart.<ref name="creedfeed">{{cite web |url=http://www.creedfeed.com/band/ |title=Creed Bio |publisher=CreedFeed}}</ref> The band's hit song "My Own Prison" was also featured as a live performance on the charity album ''[[Live in the X Lounge]]'' in 1998. The band covered [[Alice Cooper]]'s song "[[I'm Eighteen]]" for ''[[The Faculty]]'' soundtrack in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/songs/creed/646500 |title=Creed @ ARTISTDIRECT |publisher=[[Artistdirect]]}}</ref> Critical reception toward ''My Own Prison'' was mostly favorable. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] gave it four out of five stars and said that Creed "work well within their chicken tender dinner" despite "basically [falling] into the category of post-Seattle bands who temper their grunge with a dose of [[Live (band)|Live]] earnestness."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/my-own-prison-r307727 |title=My Own Prison&nbsp;– Creed  |website=[[AllMusic]] |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> The album lyrically deals with themes of questioning and struggling with faith and [[spirituality]].

===''Human Clay'' and Marshall's departure (1999–2000)===
With money made from ''My Own Prison'', the band started to write for their second album, ''[[Human Clay]]''. The album's first single, "[[Higher (Creed song)|Higher]]", spent a record-breaking 17 weeks on the top of the rock radio charts.<ref name="allmusic.com" /><ref name="higher">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4642080-1.html |title=Creed Goes "higher' In The Record Books |first=Mark |last=Marone |magazine=Billboard |date=January 21, 2000}}</ref> In 2009, "Higher" was ranked as the 95th greatest hard rock song of all time by [[VH1]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stereogum.com/43591/vh1s_100_greatest_hard_rock_songs/list/ |title=VH1's 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs |date=January 5, 2009 |publisher=Stereogum}}</ref> The album was released in 1999, when ''My Own Prison'' was still doing reasonably well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/creed/biography/ |title=Creed Biography&nbsp;– Yahoo! Music |first=Steve |last=Huey |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The first three of those topped radio charts, giving Creed a total of seven chart-topping singles.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> The band would later go on to win their first, and to date only, [[Grammy Award]] for "With Arms Wide Open" for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] in 2001.<ref name="grammy">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/news_feature_grammy01/grammy01frame.html |title=MTV News: 2001 Grammy Winners |publisher=MTV}}</ref>

Reviews for ''Human Clay'' were largely positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from [[AllMusic]] said that the record "does make it clear that there is an audience for post-grunge hard rock, as long as it's delivered without pretension and as long as it meets the audience's desire for straight-ahead, hard-hitting music."<ref name="AM">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/human-clay-r429719/review |title=Human Clay&nbsp;– Creed |website=[[AllMusic]] |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> The lyrical content of ''Human Clay'' is a slight departure from that of ''My Own Prison'', touching on subjects such as fatherhood ("With Arms Wide Open") and [[lucid dream]]ing ("Higher"), as well as darker, more violent themes such as [[sexual abuse]] ("Wash Away Those Years") and [[hostility]] ("What If").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.passionbreedsfollowers.com/media/print/areviews/gtm.shtml |title=Creed&nbsp;– Human Clay |publisher=Passion Breeds Followers |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715050840/http://www.passionbreedsfollowers.com/media/print/areviews/gtm.shtml |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref>

During the summer of 2000, bassist Brian Marshall began a spiral into alcoholism. The band had a meeting with management to discuss Marshall's future. Stapp and Tremonti supported the idea of Marshall going to rehab and attempted to talk Marshall into going, but he refused. Initially, the public thought Marshall was let go because he criticized [[Pearl Jam]] frontman [[Eddie Vedder]] in a radio interview with [[KNDD]] in June 2000, claiming that Scott Stapp is a better songwriter, and criticized Pearl Jam's recent albums for "having songs without [[Hook (music)|hooks]]."<ref>{{cite web|first1=David|last1=Basham|title=Creed Bassist Disses Pearl Jam in Radio Interview|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1427593/creed-bassist-disses-pearl-jam-in-radio-interview/|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=June 19, 2000}}</ref> Stapp later distanced the rest of the band from Marshall's comments and stated, "Yes, we get tired of the PJ question, but there is no excuse for the arrogance and stupidity [of Marshall]. I ask you all not to judge Creed as a band, because the statements made were not the band's feelings, they were Brian's. I'm sorry if Brian offended anyone, and he has already apologized for his comments."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302212304/http://uk.real.com/music/genre/Christian_Rock/articles/375445/-related-articles-page-5/|title=Christian Rock - Christian/Gospel - Music|date=March 2, 2010|website=Web.archive.org|access-date=August 21, 2021}}</ref> Although it was reported that Marshall left Creed "on friendly terms", he did not. Tremonti and Stapp were concerned for Marshall and their collective friendships, but soon after the controversy, Marshall formed a new band called Grand Luxx with his old Mattox Creed bandmates.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> Stapp stated that Marshall's leaving was his choice and was unrelated to the Pearl Jam comments.<ref name="scott stapp interview mtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/stapp_scott/news_feature_080904/index2.jhtml |title=Scott Stapp Breaks His Silence |first=Joe |last=D'Angelo |publisher=MTV |date=August 9, 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814024301/http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/stapp_scott/news_feature_080904/index2.jhtml |archive-date=August 14, 2004 }}</ref> [[Brett Hestla]], from the band [[Virgos Merlot]], replaced Marshall.

===''Weathered'' and break-up (2001–2004)===
[[file:Creed (band) in 2002.jpg|thumb|280px|Creed in 2002]]
Creed worked on their third album for most of 2001, with Tremonti choosing to play bass on the record to "[preserve] the band's initial core," although Hestla remained in Creed's touring lineup. ''[[Weathered]]'' was released on November 20, 2001. Six singles were released from the album: "[[My Sacrifice]]" (which earned the band a nomination for a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] in 2003), "[[Bullets (Creed song)|Bullets]]", "[[One Last Breath (Creed song)|One Last Breath]]", "[[Hide (Creed song)|Hide]]", "[[Don't Stop Dancing]]", and "[[Weathered (song)|Weathered]]". The album was a commercial bestseller<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rock.about.com/od/creed/p/creed.htm |title=Creed Biography&nbsp;– Profile of Rock Band Creed |first=Tim |last=Grierson |publisher=[[About.com]]}}</ref> and was certified platinum six times over and debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200. It remained at that spot for eight weeks, a record which Creed notably shares with [[The Beatles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/creed_3_/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd |title=Creed&nbsp;– Full Biography |publisher=MTV}}</ref> The tour to promote ''Weathered'' was met with considerable controversy; it was delayed in April 2002 when Stapp suffered a concussion and vertebrae damage after being involved in a [[car crash]]. As a result, in addition to his growing addiction to alcohol, he became addicted to pain medication.
This, along with other events, led to a considerably controversial concert on December 29, 2002, at the [[Allstate Arena]] in [[Rosemont, Illinois]], which ultimately led to the band's disunion. Four disappointed concertgoers filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that Scott Stapp "was so intoxicated and/or medicated that he was unable to sing the lyrics of a single Creed song."<ref name="suntimes">{{cite news |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2009/08/creed_they_heard_we_missed_em.html |title=Creed: They heard we missed 'em, now they're back |date=August 25, 2009 |first=Jim |last=DeRogatis |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528224809/http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2009/08/creed_they_heard_we_missed_em.html |archive-date=May 28, 2011 }}</ref> Creed later issued an apology on Stapp's behalf,<ref name="yahoo music">{{cite web |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/creed/news/creed-apologizes-to-fans-for-chicago-show--12063497 |title=Creed Apologizes To Fans For Chicago Show |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Ultimately, the case was dismissed.<ref name="suntimes" /> Stapp later confirmed that he was intoxicated during the concert, but asserted that he was not incoherent.<ref name="scott stapp interview mtv" />

After remaining inactive for over a year, it was announced in June 2004 that Creed had disbanded. Tremonti cited tensions between Stapp and the rest of the band as the reasoning. He said that the relationship with Stapp had become so strained that the creative juices were no longer flowing. The reality was that Stapp was in Maui battling his addiction to alcohol and drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488149/creed-have-been-split-up-months.jhtml |title=Creed Break Up: Mark Tremonti blames tensions between band, singer Scott Stapp. |publisher=MTV |first=Joe |last=D'Angelo |date=June 4, 2004}}</ref> Almost simultaneous with the announcement of Creed's break-up, Stapp opted for a solo career. On November 22, 2004, Wind-up Records released Creed's ''[[Greatest Hits (Creed album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album. Stapp released his debut solo album ''[[The Great Divide (Scott Stapp album)|The Great Divide]]'' in 2005.

In June 2015, while promoting his second solo album ''[[Cauterize (album)|Cauterize]]'', Mark Tremonti claimed in an interview with ''Kerrang'' that he "[hasn't] been a close friend of Scott's in 9 years". The other members did not speak to Stapp throughout the South American Tour in 2012 and plans for their fifth studio album were shelved, and they continued to work with Myles Kennedy in Alter Bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/32287/havent-close-friend-scotts-9-years-mark-tremonti/|title="I Haven't Been A Close Friend Of Scott's For 9 Years" - Mark Tremonti - Kerrang!|date=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623013909/http://www.kerrang.com/32287/havent-close-friend-scotts-9-years-mark-tremonti/|archive-date=June 23, 2015}}</ref>

In September 2015, Stapp appeared on the ''[[Dr. Oz Show]]''. When asked about a Creed reunion, Stapp replied: "I can tell you what, I sure hope so.

In September 2015, Stapp announced that Creed would be releasing a new "retrospective" album that November. It would be three discs, one with hits, one with rarities, and the last with acoustic versions of hits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/6707847/scott-stapp-bipolar-disorder-recovery-creed-reunion|title=Scott Stapp|work=Billboard}}</ref> The album--''[[With Arms Wide Open: A Retrospective]]''—was released as a [[Walmart]]-exclusive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blindedbysound.com/reviews/cd-review-creed---with-arms-wide-open-a-retrospective/|title=CD Review: Creed - With Arms Wide Open: A Retrospective - Blinded by Sound|website=blindedbysound.com}}</ref> In 2016, Stapp joined [[Art of Anarchy]]. His first album with the band was released in March 2017, and is titled ''[[The Madness (Art of Anarchy album)|The Madness]]''. Alter Bridge continues to tour and record, while Mark Tremonti released, with his solo metal band [[Tremonti (band)|Tremonti]], his third album ''[[Dust (Tremonti album)|Dust]]'' in April 2016, and his fourth album, ''[[A Dying Machine (album)|A Dying Machine]],'' in April 2018. Scott Phillips has drummed in the supergroup project [[Projected]], releasing the first album ''[[Human (Projected album)|Human]]'' (2012) and the second effort the double album ''[[Ignite My Insanity]]'' (2017). Due to the different members' band projects, touring so far is put aside, focusing more on releasing original music. Scott Stapp has since bridged away from [[Art of Anarchy]], having released his third solo album, ''[[The Space Between the Shadows]]'', on July 19, 2019.

In November 2020, drummer Scott Phillips announced that a reunion was a possibility.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ex-Creed Drummer Scott Phillips Says There's Reunion Talk in the Band|url=https://www.tmz.com/2020/11/05/ex-creed-drummer-scott-phillips-some-dialogue-band-reunion/|access-date=November 6, 2020|website=TMZ|language=en}}</ref>

According to a 1999 piece in ''[[The Washington Post]]'':<blockquote>The biblical imagery of singer Scott Stapp's lyrics got Creed typed as Christian rock by early listeners, and the band's denial of any religious objective has unsettled some of its more fervent fans.
