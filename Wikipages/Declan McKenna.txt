He initially gained recognition for winning the [[Glastonbury Festival]]'s Emerging Talent Competition in 2015. McKenna self-released the song "[[Brazil (Declan McKenna song)|Brazil]]", a protest song criticising [[FIFA]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] held in Brazil, as his debut single in December 2014. The song reached number one on [[Sirius XM Radio]]'s [[Alt Nation]] Alt 18 Countdown for 23 January 2016 and held that spot for three weeks. The song also reached number 16 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs]] chart. He released his debut studio album, ''[[What Do You Think About the Car?]],'' on 21 July 2017. McKenna released his second studio album, [[Zeros (Declan McKenna album)|''Zeros'']], on 4 September 2020, after multiple delays due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Damian |title=Declan McKenna shares new track 'Be An Astronaut' and delays forthcoming album |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/declan-mckenna-shares-new-track-be-an-astronaut-and-delays-forthcoming-album-2721871 |website=NME |publisher=NME |access-date=13 August 2020 |archive-date=5 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805163557/https://www.nme.com/news/music/declan-mckenna-shares-new-track-be-an-astronaut-and-delays-forthcoming-album-2721871 |url-status=live }}</ref>

McKenna wrote an extensive number of demo songs prior to releasing his first breakout single.

(Ironically, McKenna's single "Isombard" appeared on the soundtrack for the 2016 [[Association football|football]] video game ''[[FIFA 17]]''.)

In November 2015, following the success of "Brazil" and his shows in London, McKenna self-released his second single, "Paracetamol". The five-and-a-half minute song discussed how [[transgender]] teenagers are misrepresented in the media.<ref name="welch" /> In an interview with Sound of Boston, McKenna explained that the title of the song came from "the idea of using the lyric [[paracetamol]] was a way of comparing the belief that someone can be cured from who they are, via therapy, to an everyday painkiller."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bedian|first1=Knar|title=Interview: Declan McKenna|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-declan-mckenna/|website=Sound of Boston|access-date=22 October 2016|archive-date=23 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023133127/http://soundofboston.com/interview-declan-mckenna/|url-status=live}}</ref> Matt Wilkinson of ''NME'' called "Paracetamol" McKenna's second break-out hit. Although it was not likely to receive radio airplay or top out the charts, Wilkinson argued, the song showed that McKenna was not just another "UK indie troubadour, a little bit oikish and with a nifty talent for mainstream melody", but rather a solid and accomplished songwriter who can deliver "bruised and vulnerable" vocals.<ref name=wilkinson/> Jon Lyons of the music Web site ThisNewBand.com said the song showed a maturity that clearly indicated McKenna was not "just a teen dream or a one hit wonder."<ref name=lyons /> ''Billboard'' said in early 2016 that McKenna was "making inroads in America" with "Brazil", which charted on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s Alternative Songs chart (for the week ending 27 February 2016) at number 32, rising to number 26 on the 5 March 2016 chart.<ref name="caulfield">{{cite news|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|title=Tomorrow's Hits: She Is We, Declan McKenna & Colours|work=Billboard|date=4 March 2016|access-date=9 March 2016|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6897346/tomorrows-hits-she-is-we-declan-mckenna-colours|archive-date=6 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306190956/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6897346/tomorrows-hits-she-is-we-declan-mckenna-colours|url-status=live}}</ref>

McKenna appeared on [[BBC Music]]'s "Sound of 2017" list at the end of 2016, after releasing the two EPs ''Stains'' and ''Liar'' that year.<ref name="smythz" /> The EPs had similar tracklists, with "Brazil" and "Paracetamol" appearing on both. McKenna would release two more singles, "The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home" and "Humongous", before releasing his debut album, titled ''[[What Do You Think About the Car?]]'' English musician, record producer and composer [[James Ford (musician)|James Ford]], who had produced albums by [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Depeche Mode]], and [[Florence and the Machine]], produced the album, which was recorded at a [[Kensal Green]] recording studio.

===''Zeros'' (2019–present)===
On 19 August 2019, McKenna released the song "[[British Bombs]]", which criticises UK foreign policy. He stated that it is specifically about "the hypocrisy of the British arms trade and the weapons convention in London". He wrote it as a result of wanting to write a song directly addressing war.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/declan-mc-kenna-opens-up-politically-charged-new-single-british-bombs-2539718 |title=Exclusive – Declan McKenna opens up about his politically charged new single 'British Bombs' |last=Aubrey |first=Elizabeth |date=19 August 2019 |website=[[NME]] |access-date=19 December 2019 |archive-date=19 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219185924/https://www.nme.com/news/music/declan-mc-kenna-opens-up-politically-charged-new-single-british-bombs-2539718 |url-status=live }}</ref> McKenna later announced via [[Twitter]] on 18 December that his upcoming second studio album was mastered and ready for release.

==Critical response==
[[File:Declan McKenna, Patterns, Brighton (Great Escape 2018) (40780741260) (cropped).jpg|thumb|McKenna at [[The Great Escape Festival]] in 2018]]
McKenna writes his own songs, but is supported by a band on tour currently consisting of Isabel Torres (guitar), Nathan Cox (keyboards), William Bishop (bass) and Gabrielle Marie King (drums),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHocldC9C8g&ab_channel=DeclanUpdated |title=Declan McKenna Live @ The Future is Here – Extinction Rebellion in London (October 7th) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2019-10-07 |access-date=2020-05-11 |archive-date=4 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204220139/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHocldC9C8g&ab_channel=DeclanUpdated |url-status=live }}</ref>  although he has previously played all of his own instruments.<ref name=brinsford /> In terms of the development of his musical style, he has said he would most like to emulate [[David Bowie]]'s career.<ref name=savage />

[[BBC News]] called "Brazil" an extraordinarily mature song for a 16-year-old songwriter.<ref name=bbc /> Matt Wilkinson at ''NME'' called it "one of the best songs" of 2015, and had high praise for McKenna's second single, "Paracetamol", as well.<ref name=wilkinson/> Jon Lyons of ThisNewBand.com called "Brazil" "a catchy song no doubt", and also noted that it was "a sharp critique on sports, money and power."<ref name=lyons>{{cite web|url=http://thisnewband.com/837/meet-16-year-old-declan-mckenna-and-his-incredible-song-brazil/|last=Lyons|first=Jon|title=Meet 16-Year-Old Declan McKenna and His Incredible Song "Brazil"|website=ThisNewBand.com|date=23 November 2015|access-date=8 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107100125/http://thisnewband.com/837/meet-16-year-old-declan-mckenna-and-his-incredible-song-brazil/|archive-date=7 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Some music critics have tempered their praise of McKenna. Matt Wilkinson called McKenna's London gigs surprisingly good, if "rough around the edges".<ref name=wilkinson/> Jon Lyons has observed that as of November 2015, McKenna's songs seemed to indicate an artist still experimenting with bands and styles of music which have influenced him. He felt McKenna was still "searching for his own sound right in front of the crowd. An artist is being born note by note."<ref name=lyons /> Andy Welch, music critic for the ''[[Bristol Post]]'', said McKenna was "one to watch", displaying "lots of early, ragged promise".<ref name="welch" />

Andre Paine of the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' was less impressed with McKenna's live show, commenting that although his performance "had plenty of energy ... [he] didn't quite live up to his reputation as the voice of a generation", going on to call McKenna's performance "messy".<ref name=Paine>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/declan-mckenna-tour-review-not-quite-the-voice-of-a-generation-a3547376.html|last=Paine|first=Andre|title=Declan McKenna, tour review: Not quite the voice of a generation|website=Standard.co.uk|date=24 May 2017|access-date=23 June 2017|archive-date=25 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625152244/http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/declan-mckenna-tour-review-not-quite-the-voice-of-a-generation-a3547376.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Personal life==

McKenna says he feels very good about being a role model.<ref name=smithinterviewed /> At first, he said he also struggled to understand both the criticism and praise he received, but has been able to be more mature and more analytical about both.<ref name=norris /> He is a [[Veganism|vegan]] and supports [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2020/september/declan-mckenna-to-appear-on-n17-live-on-sunday/ |title=Declan McKenna to appear on N17 Live on Sunday |work=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |date=9 September 2020 |access-date=30 January 2021 |archive-date=24 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924183421/https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2020/september/declan-mckenna-to-appear-on-n17-live-on-sunday/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Sexual orientation===
After adopting a somewhat [[glam rock]] visual style for his live performances (which included use of eye makeup and [[glitter]]),<ref name=savage /> McKenna addressed questions about his sexuality with ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'' magazine by declining to label himself, saying, "I'm young. I'm here to be experimented with" and that he was "learning about a lot of things".<ref>{{cite news|title=Singer Declan McKenna On Ditching Labels: 'I'm Here to Be Experimented With'|work=Attitude|date=3 July 2017|access-date=9 October 2018|url=https://attitude.co.uk/article/singer-declan-mckenna-on-ditching-labels-im-here-to-be-experimented-with/15173/|archive-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010095358/https://attitude.co.uk/article/singer-declan-mckenna-on-ditching-labels-im-here-to-be-experimented-with/15173/|url-status=live}}</ref> In a second interview with ''Attitude'' in May 2020, McKenna said of his sexuality he "couldn't put a label on it" but that [[pansexuality|pansexual]] may come close, stating "I would never have really said my sexuality is restricted to any gender or anything ... I might call it pansexual, depending on who I’m talking to. I struggle to imagine it in any other way."<ref>{{cite news|title=Declan McKenna can't put a label on his sexuality – but pansexual might come close|work=Attitude|date=21 May 2020|access-date=21 May 2020|url=https://attitude.co.uk/article/declan-mckenna-cant-put-a-label-on-his-sexuality-but-pansexual-might-come-close/23323/|archive-date=31 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200531051448/https://attitude.co.uk/article/declan-mckenna-cant-put-a-label-on-his-sexuality-but-pansexual-might-come-close/23323/|url-status=live}}</ref> He has a girlfriend, who is the topic of his 2021 single "My House".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Desk|first=TV News|title=Declan McKenna Debuts New Single 'My House'|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Declan-McKenna-Debuts-New-Single-My-House-20210709|access-date=2021-07-10|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en}}</ref>

===Political views===
McKenna acknowledges that he is seen as a "political" or "protest" singer. He does not see himself as someone "leading the conversation" but rather as a person singing about things his peers are already talking about.<ref name=smithinterviewed /> For much of his initial work, McKenna said he tried to find inspiration for lyrics and topics in his private life. He felt his own life to be so uneventful, however, that he turned to political and social issues which he felt needed to be discussed.<ref name=savage /> For his second album, however, McKenna feels that he has had so much happen that he can draw on more personal experiences for his lyrics.<ref name=norris>{{cite news|last=Norris|first=John|title=With Politics, Eye Makeup and That Album Cover, Declan McKenna Goes Bold|work=Billboard|date=15 August 2017|access-date=9 October 2018|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7905012/declan-mckenna-politics-interview|archive-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010105724/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7905012/declan-mckenna-politics-interview|url-status=live}}</ref>
