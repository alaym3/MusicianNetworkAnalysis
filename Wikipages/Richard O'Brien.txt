==Early life==
O'Brien was born Richard Smith in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]]. He emigrated with his family to [[Tauranga]], [[New Zealand]], at the age of 10, where his accountant father had purchased a sheep farm. He went to [[Tauranga Boys' College]]. He returned to England in 1964, after having learned how to ride horses (a skill which provided him with his break into the film industry as a [[stunt double|stuntman]] in ''[[Carry On Cowboy]]'')<ref name="Guardian2020">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/05/richard-obrien-interview-rocky-horror-trans-crack-stroke-70s |title=Rocky Horror's Richard O'Brien: I should be dead.

He launched his acting career using his maternal grandmother's name,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} as there was already an actor named Richard Smith.

He says that his time in New Zealand instilled him with a sense of egalitarianism and gave him "a great sense of freedom".<ref name="nzherald.co.nz">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11814401 |title=From Rocky Horror to Katikati - Richard O'Brien speaks |date=14 March 2017 |via=www.nzherald.co.nz |newspaper=NZ Herald |access-date=17 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017201933/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11814401 |archive-date=17 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Career==
To improve his acting skills, O'Brien took [[method acting]] classes, and then joined several stage productions as an actor. In 1970, he went into the touring production of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' for nine months, and spent another nine months in the London production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockyhorror.com/history/castcrewlist_obrien.php |title=Richard O'Brien |access-date=10 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311042104/http://www.rockyhorror.com/history/castcrewlist_obrien.php |archive-date=11 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the summer of 1972, he met director [[Jim Sharman]] who cast him as an Apostle and Leper in the London production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. Sharman then cast O'Brien as Willie, the alien in his March 1973 production of [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''The Unseen Hand'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] Upstairs.<ref>{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ-8rdzvABgC&q=o%27brien+the+unseen+hand&pg=PA87 |title=Sam Shepard |author=Shewey, Don |page=87 |date=1997 |publisher=Da Capo |access-date=10 March 2016 |isbn=9780306807701}}</ref>

Sharman also helped make O'Brien's draft of a [[Gothic fiction|gothic]]-themed, schlock-horror comic-book fantasy romp into a reality. Sharman suggested changing the working title from ''They Came from Denton High'', and ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' opened at the Theatre Upstairs in June 1973.<ref>{{cite book |author=Harding, James |date=1987 |title=The Rocky Horror Show Book |publisher=Sidgwick & Jackson |pages=22–23}}</ref> Within weeks it had become a box-office hit, moving from the Royal Court to the Pheasantry, a nearby venue in the [[King's Road]], then to the Classic Cinema and eventually into the [[West End theatre|West End]] at the [[Comedy Theatre]].

After seeing the second night's performance of ''The Rocky Horror Show'' in the Theatre Upstairs, [[Jonathan King]] produced the original cast soundtrack in just over 48 hours during an off-stage weekend, and rushed it out on his [[UK Records]] label. He also became a 20% backer with producer [[Michael White (producer)|Michael White]], who put up the remaining 80%.<ref name=Independent2012>{{cite news |title=Jonathan King: 'The only apology I have is to say that I was good at seduction' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/jonathan-king-the-only-apology-i-have-is-to-say-that-i-was-good-at-seduction-7658249.html |newspaper=The Independent on Sunday |location=London, UK |date=22 April 2012 |author=Chalmers, Robert |access-date=3 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204063106/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/jonathan-king-the-only-apology-i-have-is-to-say-that-i-was-good-at-seduction-7658249.html |archive-date=4 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During this period, O'Brien and his wife Kimi Wong recorded and released pop singles under the name [[Kimi and Ritz]].<ref name="andy">{{citation |author=O'Bonzo, Andrew |title=A Talk with Richard O'Brien's music publisher, Andy Leighton |publisher=Crazed Imaginations |number=57 |date=May 2000 |pages=12–15}}</ref>

Zee'' (1976), ''Disaster'' (1978), ''The Stripper'' (1982 – based on the [[Carter Brown]] novel and produced in [[Australia]]), and ''Top People'' (1984). O'Brien and Hartley also provided three songs for the film ''[[The Return of Captain Invincible]]'' (1983), starring [[Alan Arkin]].

Additionally he guest starred in five episodes in the third series of the [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] dramatisation of ''[[Robin of Sherwood]]'', as the corrupt [[druid]] Gulnar. A music CD of the songs from ''Disgracefully Yours'' entitled ''Absolute O'Brien'' was released in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymusic.org/album/absolute-obrien.php|title=Absolute O'Brien CD by Richard O'Brien (1999)|access-date=10 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318021452/http://www.rockymusic.org/album/absolute-obrien.php|archive-date=18 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

He became the presenter of UK [[Channel 4]]'s game show ''[[The Crystal Maze]]'' in 1990,<ref name=moss>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/playwrights/richard-o-brien|title=Richard O'Brien interview: 'There's a lot of male in me – and a lot of girl as well'|author=Stadlin, Matthew|date=14 September 2015|access-date=10 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405164911/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/playwrights/richard-o-brien/|archive-date=5 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> specialising in sardonic put-downs, occasional eccentricities and playing his [[harmonica]] at random intervals. The show ran from 1990 to 1995, with O'Brien presenting the first four series. It was regularly Channel 4's highest-rated programme, reaching a peak of 7&nbsp;million viewers for the 1993 Christmas special. O'Brien left ''The Crystal Maze'' in 1993 after the fourth series; the show was then taken over by [[Edward Tudor-Pole]]. After two series without O'Brien, the show was cancelled.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In other roles O'Brien has conceptualised and played the role of the [[Child Catcher]] in the West End theatre production of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (musical)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''.<ref name=moss/> He also occasionally performs [[cabaret]]-style music and comedy on stages around the world, singing songs from ''Rocky Horror'' among others. In 1995, he performed a select number of shows as the devilish charmer Mephistopheles Smith in a musical/comedy show he wrote entitled ''Disgracefully Yours'', to which he later gave permission to be adapted into a musical, first by Eubank Productions for the Kansas City Fringe Fest in 2006, and more recently by Janus Theatre Company for the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] 2007, simply entitled ''Mephistopheles Smith''. In late 2005, he appeared (as the spirit of the mirror) in the pantomime version of ''[[Snow White]]'', which played at the [[Milton Keynes Theatre]]. In the summer of 2006, he played the Child Catcher in the Queen's 80th birthday celebrations at [[Buckingham Palace]].

A script for another rumoured sequel entitled ''[[Revenge of the Old Queen]]'' of ''Rocky Horror'', has been circulated on the web and reproduced on various fan sites, although it has been officially denied as O'Brien's work by his representatives.

In a 2009 interview, O'Brien spoke about an ongoing struggle to reconcile cultural [[gender role]]s and described himself as [[transgender]] or "of a [[third gender]]".<ref name="Guardian2020" /> O'Brien stated, "There is a continuum between male and female.

In June 2010, the media reported that O'Brien had been denied [[New Zealand citizenship]] owing to his being too old under the country's immigration criteria.
