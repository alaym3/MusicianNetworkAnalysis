'''''I Am King''''' is the second studio album by American [[hardcore punk]] band [[Code Orange (band)|Code Orange]] and first to be released under this moniker after previously being referred to as "Code Orange Kids". The [[Kurt Ballou]]-produced album was released on September 2, 2014 through [[Deathwish Inc.]]<ref name="altpress2"/> To promote the album, Code Orange released music videos for the tracks "I Am King" and "Dreams in Inertia", in addition to an online stream for "My World".

== Writing and recording ==
Code Orange entered the studio with [[Kurt Ballou]] in February 2014.<ref name="idobi"/> Ballou is the guitarist of [[Converge (band)|Converge]] and previously recorded Code Orange's 2012 debut album ''[[Love Is Love/Return to Dust]]''. Code Orange drummer Jami Morgan described ''I Am King'' as a "different" album that will mark "a very new era for our band", and also elaborated: "A lot of the heavier parts are heavier and sometimes more obvious. A lot of the odd parts are weirder and a little more anti-social. Things are a lot more blended together."<ref name="idobi"/> After the band wrote the "skeletons" of the songs for ''I Am King'', Code Orange revisited the tracks to look for moments where they could, "incorporate these little sonic nuggets that excited us or intrigued us."<ref name="decibel1"/> The songs were also influenced by metal acts such as the [[groove metal]] band [[Sepultura]], [[metalcore]] band [[Prayer for Cleansing]] and [[grunge]] band [[Alice in Chains]].<ref name="cos1"/>

== Promotion and marketing ==
[[File:Code Orange -- King 2014.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Code Orange's panther-head logo used to tease and promote ''I Am King'']]
Code Orange (then known as Code Orange Kids) began teasing the release of its sophomore album 7 months in advance in February 2014 by posting an image of a green panther with a black backdrop accompanied by the phrase "King 2014" on its social media sites.<ref name="underthegun"/><ref name="mindequalsblown"/> The following month, Code Orange launched a mysterious [[viral marketing]] campaign and website dubbed "Thinners of the Herd", which asked for fans' names and home addresses.<ref name="mindequalsblown2"/><ref name="monolith"/>

In June 2014, Code Orange released a music video for the title track, "I Am King", directed by Max Moore.<ref name="altpress1"/><ref name="exclaim1"/> Writing for ''[[Exclaim!]]'', Gregory Adams said "I Am King" is "a little gory" and also said, "While the black and white video strings together savage shots of the group ripping through fast and punchy hardcore licks and a monster of a mosh section from inside a straw-strewn barn, there's even more menacing footage mixed into the clip's runtime."<ref name="exclaim1"/> In July 2014, Code Orange released an online stream of the song "My World",<ref name="altpress3"/> followed by a music video for "Dreams in Inertia" in August 2014, again directed by Max Moore.<ref name="altpress4"/><ref name="exclaim2"/> Writing for ''[[Fangoria]]'', Samuel Zimmerman described the "Dreams in Inertia" video, stating: "Admittedly mellower (for a spell), the video for 'Dreams in Inertia' is full of [[occult]] vibes and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] creep."<ref name="fangoria"/> Adams also discussed the video, commenting: "While we see the band delivering the tune throughout the video, we also get a glimpse of a guy's bathtub purification and a dour crew's march through a forest filled with nooses. Code Orange meet up with the other faction late in the video to offer a few sips of Kool-Aid, which may not be a gesture of good faith."<ref name="exclaim2"/> ''I Am King'' was made available for online streaming in its entirety a week ahead of its release on August 26.<ref name="cos1"/>

For supporting tours, Code Orange performed sets of almost entirely new material from ''I Am King''. In an interview about an upcoming show in Portland, Oregon, drummer Jami Morgan explained, "We're gonna play one song off [''Love Is Love/Return to Dust''] and that's it. Nothing else matters. To me, when you make a record that [makes you] feel like how we feel about this record, the other records don't matter. They're obsolete. They were on a path to get to this record."<ref name="portlandmercury1"/> Code Orange's first tour in support of ''I Am King'' was a brief stint opening for [[Killswitch Engage]] and [[Ringworm (band)|Ringworm]] surrounding its participation in the This Is Hardcore festival on July 24, 2014.<ref name="bv1"/><ref name="punknews1"/> This was followed by a Septemberâ€“October 2014 co-headlining tour with Twitching Tongues.<ref name="altpress5"/>

Upon its release, ''I Am King'' received positive reviews from music critics. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album received an average score of 87, which indicates "universal acclaim", based on four reviews.<ref name="metacritic"/>

Writing for [[Consequence of Sound]] Ryan Bray stated: "Guttural metalcore still reigns loudly over any dreamy, [[indie rock]] ambitions that Code Orange entertain on ''I Am King''. ... But they're trying, and in a genre that adheres so closely to formula like hardcore, metal, and the spaces in between, that in and of itself means something."<ref name="cos-review"/> Andy Biddulph of ''[[Rock Sound]]'' described the album as "breathtaking" and wrote: "With its heady mix of head-caving [[Drone music|drone]], battering hardcore and classic [[Rock music|rock]] riffery, ''I Am King'' is a record unlike any other."<ref name="rocksound1"/> Bradley Zorgdrager of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' praised for its "crushing cacophony", stating "it's the moments of calm before (and during) the storm here that makes I Am King worthy of its crown."<ref name="exclaim3"/>

Terry Bezer of ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' complimented the band's progression from their debut album stating, "for all the change, Code Orange's progression in sound doesn't feel unnatural off the back of Love Is Love // Return To Dust and marks a different but no less enthralling (or heavy) experience."<ref name="Metal Hammer"/> Punknews.org called the album "heavy and full of rage" and considered it "[to be] in line with what the band has always done best."<ref name="punknews2"/>

===Commercial performance===
The album debuted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at 96,<ref name="allmusic1"/> making ''I Am King'' the first Code Orange album to appear on a national chart.
