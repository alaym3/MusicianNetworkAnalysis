== Influences ==
Mereba cites Stevie Wonder as her "fairy Godfather" after meeting him in 2016 and becoming his mentee through the last stretch of finishing of her debut album, ''The Jungle is the Only Way Out''. Wonder specifically encouraged Mereba to continue to produce her own music, comparing her passion for production to his own passion for songwriting early in his career. Both passions were initially discouraged by the people who worked with both Mereba and Wonder. Mereba performed alongside Wonder at Soho House in Malibu in 2017, where he co-signed and personally introduced her to an intimate audience of listeners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marianmereba.bandcamp.com/album/room-for-living-ep|title=An Evening with Stevie Wonder & Mereba|website=|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>
