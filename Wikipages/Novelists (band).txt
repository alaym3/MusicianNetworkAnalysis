==History==
Novelists was founded in 2013 by brothers Amael and Florestan Durand. Shortly after, Matteo Gelsomino, Nicolas Delestrade, and Charles-Henri Teule joined.<ref name="Souvenirs">{{cite web | url=https://metal-heads.de/reviews/novelists-souvenirs-album-review-voe-13-11-2015/ | title=Novelists - Souvenirs - Album Review | work=Metal-heads.de | date=23 November 2015 | accessdate=14 September 2019 | language=de}}</ref> In April 2014, they released a demo with 6 songs. In July 2015, they signed with the [[record label]] [[Arising Empire]], and in November they released their debut [[studio album]], ''Souvenirs''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.stormbringer.at/reviews/12614/novelists-souvenirs.html | title=Novelists-Souvenirs | work=Stormbringer.com | date=18 January 2016 | accessdate=14 September 2019 | language=de | author=Staub, Pascal}}</ref> In June 2017, the band released the single "The Light, the Fire". After this, they toured with [[While She Sleeps]] and [[Northlane]]. A month later, they signed with [[SharpTone Records]], and released their second studio album, ''Noir'', in September 2017.

Novelists released their third studio album, titled ''C'est La Vie'', in January 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Novelists FR release 'Head Rush' and announce new album 'C'est La Vie' |url=http://sharptonerecords.co/novelists-fr-release-head-rush-and-announce-new-album-cest-la-vie/ |website=sharptonerecords.co |date=11 October 2019 |accessdate=23 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Le groupe de metal francais Novelists FR annonce son nouvel album C'est La Vie & publie le single Head Rush |url=https://www.metalzone.fr/news/91763-le-groupe-de-metal-francais-novelists-annonce-son-nouvel-album-cest-la-vie-publie-le-single-head-rush/ |website=metalzone.fr |date=11 October 2019 |accessdate=23 October 2019 |language=fr |trans-title=French metal band Novelists FR announce new album 'C'est La Vie' and release single 'Head Rush'}}</ref>

In April 2020, the band parted ways with Gelsomino as vocalist and started an online audition process to find a new singer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Duffour |first=Adrien |date=2020-04-07 |title=Novelists FR et le chanteur Mattéo Gelsomino se séparent |url=https://www.metalzone.fr/news/130894-novelists-fr-matteo-gelsomino-separation/ |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=2020-09-23 |website=MetalZone |language=fr-FR}}</ref>

On October 27, 2020, Novelists announced that Tobias Rische, formerly of Alazka, will be replacing Gelsomino as their new vocalist.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1321093319334760451|user=novelists_fr|title=NOVELISTS2020 welcome Tobias Rische'Lost Cause' out November 27th.<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.

A month later, the band signed with Out of Line Music, a record label based in Berlin, and released the single "Lost Cause".<ref>{{cite web|title=Novelists FR - Lost Cause (Official Music Video) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn_HqE5wDYE |website=youtube.com |date=27 November 2020 |accessdate=1 December 2020}}</ref>

==Musical style==
The band's sound has been described as [[metalcore]], with guitar styles heavily inspired by [[progressive metal]] and [[djent]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metal-hammer.de/reviews/novelists-souvenirs/ | title=Novelists Souvenirs Review | work=[[Metal Hammer]] | date=3 November 2015 | accessdate=14 September 2019 | language=de | author=Grundke, Vincent}}</ref> They have been noted for primarily relying on clean vocals rather than screamed vocals, an uncommon practice in metalcore.
