== Career ==
=== 2011–16: Emergence and EPs ===
Under the stage names Looney and Loonz, Tracey's music can be found online dating back to June 2011. An early [[SoundCloud]] account, Looney Tell 'Em, contains eleven tracks, each with free downloads enabled. These include four songs from the scrapped grime EP ''The Dungeon'' (featuring non-exclusive beats from Spooky and Rude Kid) and two songs from ''Didn't Make the Cut'', originally slated for release on the scrapped hip hop mixtape ''Fuck a Fairytale''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/looneytellem|title=Looney Tell 'Em|website=SoundCloud|access-date=14 July 2018|archive-date=16 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116223400/http://soundcloud.com/looneytellem|url-status=live}}</ref> His debut mixtape, ''Didn't Make the Cut'', was released 13 September 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ToonzInTheLab/status/246255592451211264|title=Toonz MTP on Twitter|access-date=14 January 2017|archive-date=26 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926022729/https://twitter.com/ToonzInTheLab/status/246255592451211264|url-status=live}}</ref> and comprises 21 [[British hip hop|UK rap]] and [[Grime (music)|grime]] songs and freestyles which, in his own words, are "the tracks that didn't make it onto my actual mixtape". The project was initially to be titled ''Scirocco Musik'' and its artwork still reflects this title. In August 2013, his collective, My Team Paid, announced that they were to release a joint mixtape entitled ''My Team Paid''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLh08oLgBYY|title=MTP – Clouded Skies|last=My Team Paid|date=11 August 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=14 January 2017|archive-date=8 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408102931/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLh08oLgBYY&gl=US&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> One single, "Clouded Skies", emerged, but the project was ultimately scrapped. Tracey's second mixtape, ''No More Looney'', was released through [[DatPiff]] on 30 August 2014. The project includes thirty-three tracks, many of which feature fellow My Team Paid members [[Big Zuu]], Jay Amo, Wax and Sketch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/AJ-Tracey-No-More-Looney-mixtape.643211.html|title=AJ Tracey – No More Looney|website=DatPiff.com|access-date=14 January 2017|archive-date=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118091349/http://www.datpiff.com/AJ-Tracey-No-More-Looney-mixtape.643211.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 2017, Tracey endorsed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in the [[2017 UK general election]]. In a Labour Party campaign video he said: "The Labour Party strongly support the youth in following their dreams and giving people a chance." He added: "In my opinion we need a Labour government to give young people a hope, a chance for their future and I genuinely believe that Corbyn is the man to do it."<ref name="nme">{{cite magazine|last=Britton|first=Luke Morgan|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/aj-tracey-jeremy-corbyn-labour-2080648|title=Watch AJ Tracey explain why he's backing Jeremy Corbyn and Labour in UK election|magazine=[[NME]]|date=29 May 2017|access-date=11 June 2017|archive-date=7 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607112806/http://www.nme.com/news/music/aj-tracey-jeremy-corbyn-labour-2080648|url-status=live}}</ref>

Later that month, following the [[Grenfell Tower fire]], he was asked for his thoughts on the disaster by ''[[The Guardian]]''. His brother Mickey told the cameras: "The central government response has been shambolic. [[Theresa May]], you have a lot of questions to answer, genuinely." Tracey added: "She needs to resign, to be honest [...]. She came with heavy security, no one was allowed to approach her. And then Corbyn comes down, do you get me? No security, chats to the mandem. This is why everyone loves him [...]. It seems like he genuinely cares."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2017/jun/19/grime-aj-tracey-on-grenfell-tower-fire-weve-seen-no-government-response-video-grime-|title=AJ Tracey on the Grenfell Tower fire: 'We've seen no government response' – video|first1=Iman|last1=Amrani|first2=Mat|last2=Heywood|first3=Adam|last3=Sich|last4=theguardian.com|date=19 June 2017|website=Theguardian.com|access-date=18 June 2018|archive-date=17 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717222220/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2017/jun/19/grime-aj-tracey-on-grenfell-tower-fire-weve-seen-no-government-response-video-grime-|url-status=live}}</ref>
