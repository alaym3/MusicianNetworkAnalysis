'''Olga Vitalevna Yakovleva''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Ольга Витальевна Яковлева}}, October 12, 1970 – January 17, 2015), better known as '''Origa''', was a Russian-Japanese singer who rose to prominence for her musical collaborations in Japan.

==History==
Origa was born in the small urban village of Kochenyovo, 50 kilometres west of [[Novosibirsk]].
After graduating from music school in 1990, she took an opportunity to visit Japan in 1991 and finally contracted with the ROAD&SKY Organization in 1993. She later participated in several projects with various artists in addition to the Radio Japan Series and being part of the chorus for the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe earthquake]] disaster charity single. She released eight solo albums, three mini-albums, two compilation albums and 3 singles. She gained popularity outside Japan with the release of ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' and the subsequent original soundtracks, ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex O.S.T.]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex O.S.T. 2]]''. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

These were written by long-time friend and composer [[Yoko Kanno]], and both the first season's theme song, ''[[Inner Universe]]'' (featuring boy soprano Ben Del Maestro) and the [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|second season's]] theme song, ''[[Rise (Origa vocal)|Rise]]'', used Origa's vocals. Origa first performed with Kanno for ''[[∀ Gundam]]'', singing "Moon" in concerts (on the CD "Moon" is performed by Kanno under the pseudonym of Gabriela Robin; Kanno did not perform this song live until a surprise performance in 2009). In 2005, Origa performed songs for the anime series ''[[Fantastic Children]]'', most notably the ending theme "Mizu no Madoromi". {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 2006, Origa was involved in the lyrics and vocal performance for the opening song "Player" and the ending theme "date of rebirth" from the movie ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society]]''. In 2007, Origa performed with Yoko Kanno for the Ragnarok 2 Concert. There, she performed all three ''Ghost in the Shell'' opening themes; "Player" from ''Solid State Society'', "Inner Universe" from the first season, and "Rise" from  ''2nd GIG'', and substituted for [[Ilaria Graziano]] on "Yoru_Vo", [[Pierre Bensusan]] on "ELM", and [[Gabriela Robin]] on "Torukia".
