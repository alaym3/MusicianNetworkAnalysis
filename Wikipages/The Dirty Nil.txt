==Musical style==
Music critics commonly label the band under the [[punk rock]] genre. The band mixes the swaggering riffs of [[hard rock]] with the attitude and energy of punk. Despite these classifications, the band defines themselves as just a rock band.<ref name="noisey">[https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/the-dirty-nil-no-weaknesses-video "The Dirty Nil Is Not a Punk Band"]. ''[[Noisey]]'', November 17, 2015.</ref>
