'''Destroyer''' is a Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Vancouver]], British Columbia fronted by singer-songwriter [[Dan Bejar]]<ref>[https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/a-completely-biased-ranking-of-the-60-best-canadian-indie-rock-songs-of-the-00s-part-ii "A Completely Biased Ranking of the 60 Best Canadian Indie Rock Songs of the 00s Part II"]. ''Vice'', Cam Lindsay April 10, 2017,</ref> and formed in 1995.<ref name="auto"/> The band's discography draws on a variety of musical influences, resulting in albums that can sound markedly distinct from one another; in Bejar's words, "That's kind of my goal: to start from scratch every time."<ref name="diymag1">{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Danny |url=http://diymag.com/2015/05/26/destroyer-ive-always-suffered-from-delusions-of-grandeur |title=Destroyer: "I didn't want to stare at a computer for 18 months" &#124; DIY |publisher=Diymag.com |date=May 26, 2015 |access-date=August 28, 2015}}</ref>

== Career ==

===1996–2001===
''[[We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge]]'', Destroyer's 1996 debut, is made up of sixteen [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] home-recordings. One reviewer suggested that the album combines Bejar's "gift for melodies" with "a concerted effort to make the recording downright inconsumable; the guitars are always out of tune, and the vocals of [[Fisher-Price]] quality. 'Static means punk / tuning is junk,' Bejar moans on one track."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/3246|title=Destroyer – We'll Build Them A Golden Bridge|publisher=Dusted Reviews}}</ref> ''[[Ideas for Songs]]'', released on cassette in 1997, features songs akin to those on his first album. The cassette stemmed from a request to contribute songs for a compilation album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15484-ideas-for-songs/|title=Destroyer: Ideas For Songs (Album Review) |publisher= Pitchfork}}</ref>

As Bejar gained popularity in Vancouver's music scene, he was joined by producer [[John Collins (Canadian musician)|John Collins]] for 1998's ''[[City of Daughters]]'', which was recorded at a proper studio. [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] noted that the songs still sounded "homespun", also noting "[t]he wordiness that would become something of a trademark is in full effect", but that "unlike much of what came later, not every line is worthy of examination."<ref name=pitc1>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14141-city-of-daughters-thief-streethawk-a-seduction/|title=Destroyer: City of Daughters / Thief / Streethawk: A Seduction (Albums Review) | publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref>

''[[Thief (Destroyer album)|Thief]]'' (2000) embodied "Bejar's first stab at matching his grandiose, idiosyncratic vision to a showier sound"; it was the first to feature a backing band on every track.<ref name=pitc3>{{cite web|author=Matt LeMay|date=July 1, 2001|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/5822-destroyer/|title=Interviews: Destroyer |publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref> The record's "anthemic yet understated"<ref>{{allMusic| class=album|id=thief-mw0001147229|label=Thief}}</ref> piano-driven ballads have characteristically enigmatic lyrics, though some reviewers interpreted them as critiques of the music industry.<ref>{{cite web|author=James Keast|url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/OnTheCover/writer_thinker_creator_destroyer/Page/2|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140529102401/http://exclaim.ca/Features/OnTheCover/writer_thinker_creator_destroyer/Page/2|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 29, 2014|title=Writer, Thinker, Creator, Destroyer|website=Exclaim.ca|date=March 1, 2006}}</ref><ref name=styl>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/destroyer/this-night.htm|title=Destroyer – This Night – Review|publisher=Stylus Magazine}}</ref>

''[[Streethawk: A Seduction]]'' (2001) realized the sonic refinement started with ''[[City of Daughters]]''. Bejar put it this way: "I don't think it gives credence to any kind of conceptualization of the records, but I hope that City of Daughters, Thief, and Streethawk will pop into some kind of a progression that ends with Streethawk."<ref name=pitc2/> A critical success, the album retrospectively received a rating of 9.1/10 from Pitchfork.<ref name=pitc1/>

===2002–2007===
The 2002 rock album ''[[This Night (album)|This Night]]'' was a dramatic change in style. The looser, less rehearsed style was criticized as "messy [and] haphazard without purpose",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2291-this-night/|title=Destroyer: This Night (Album Review) |publisher= Pitchfork}}</ref> though other critics praised the "beautiful mess of sounds" as "challenging... [and] a powerful, cohesive whole."<ref name=styl/> In a 2006 interview (after the release of ''[[Your Blues]]'' and ''[[Destroyer's Rubies]]''), Bejar said the album "came together pretty quickly – we probably could have used more than four or five days to mix the whole thing, but that's all hindsight. It's still my favorite Destroyer record."<ref name=pitc2>{{cite web|author=Matt LeMay|date=June 12, 2006|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6357-destroyer/|title=Interviews: Destroyer | publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref>

''[[Your Blues]]'' (2004) saw Destroyer take another unexpected turn, using [[MIDI]] instrumentation for almost all the backing music. Bejar coined the term "European blues" to describe its unique, theatrical sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://betterpropaganda.com/content.aspx?id=388|title=Destroyer: Interview|publisher=betterPropaganda|access-date=May 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529203907/http://betterpropaganda.com/content.aspx?id=388|archive-date=May 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> One reviewer pointed out that "Bejar's unusual voice sounds more confident, and higher up" in the synth-rich arrangements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/destroyer/your-blues.htm|title=Destroyer – Your Blues – Review|publisher=Stylus Magazine}}</ref> In another twist, the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Notorious Lightning & Other Works]]'' reworked six tracks from the record with a live band, the very thing the [[LP record|LP]] had forsaken (the band was [[Frog Eyes]], who toured with Destroyer in support of ''Your Blues'').

Bejar returned with a live band for 2006's ''[[Destroyer's Rubies]]'', delivering his most confident record up to that point. The backing band took new-found prominence and, according to Bejar, "[t]he production seems... warm and lush and pretty focused on just making the band sound good and having everything sit well together."<ref name=pitc2/> [[Now (newspaper)|''Now'' magazine]] observed, "[w]hile the sheer density of Bejar's writing can be overwhelming, ''Destroyer's Rubies'' is, on a musical level, the most 'accessible' disc he's released."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=151953|title=Destroyer|publisher=NOW Toronto Magazine}}</ref>

===2008–2013===
For ''[[Trouble in Dreams]]'' (2008), "there was a scary lack of ideas coming into the record", Bejar admitted.<ref name=self1>{{cite web|url=http://www.self-titledmag.com/2008/02/17/qa-with-destroyer-interview-by-michael-tedder/|title=THE SELF-TITLED INTERVIEW: Destroyer|publisher=The S/T Interview|date=February 17, 2008}}</ref> Destroyer's piano player Ted Bois took it upon himself, as an alternative to keyboard and piano accompaniment, to create all string and synth arrangements for the songs.<ref name=self1/> At the time, Bejar said it was the "hardest record" to make.<ref name=self1/>

After the 2009 EP ''[[Bay of Pigs (EP)|Bay of Pigs]]'' came 2011's full-length album, ''[[Kaputt (album)|Kaputt]]'' (featuring a slightly modified "Bay of Pigs" track). Bejar cited influences such as [[Miles Davis]] and [[Roxy Music]] for his new jazz-infused, [[lounge music]]-inspired, [[sophisti-pop]] direction. In multiple interviews, Bejar variously stressed that he "sang in a completely different manner, almost unconscious of even singing, more like speaking into a vacuum, and was really happy with the results."<ref>{{cite web|author=Daniel Kolitz |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/destroyer/interview/47369/|title=Destroyer: Interview:|date=January 19, 2011 | publisher=Prefix}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Ryan Dombal|date=January 10, 2011|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7914-destroyer/|title=Interviews: Destroyer | publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref> The record entailed a number of firsts for Destroyer: first national television performance (on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''); first official music video; first female backing vocals; and the first time Bejar performed without an instrument on tour – his concentration placed solely on his singing. ''[[Kaputt (album)|Kaputt]]'' was short listed for the [[2011 Polaris Music Prize]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polarismusicprize.ca/2011/|title=Polaris Music Prize|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225044030/http://www.polarismusicprize.ca/2011|archive-date=December 25, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> and was Pitchfork's second best album of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/8727-the-top-50-albums-of-2011/5/|title=Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2011 | publisher= Pitchfork}}</ref>

Smaller in scale, Destroyer's fourth EP ''[[Five Spanish Songs]]'' is sung entirely in Spanish, Bejar covered songs by [[Sr. Chinarro]] ([[:es:Sr. Chinarro|es]]). Bejar's own tongue-in-cheek press release announcing the new songs began: "It was 2013. The English language seemed spent, despicable, not easily singable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/52270-destroyer-announces-spanish-language-ep/|title=Destroyer Announces Spanish Language EP | publisher=Pitchfork|author=Jenn Pelly
|date=  September 12, 2013}}</ref>

===2014–present===
Bejar released ''[[Poison Season]]'' on August 28, 2015. Bejar notes that the album's sound grew from "just really getting into what we were sounding like playing live [following ''Kaputt'']."<ref name="diymag1"/> Bejar added that he would not have been able to make such an ambitious album if ''Kaputt'' had not been successful.<ref name="dummymag1">{{cite web|last=Stanley |first=Sean |url=http://www.dummymag.com/features/destroyer-dan-bejar-poison-season-interview |title=Destroyer interview: "Grand, flawed gestures and colossal failures." |publisher=DummyMag.com |access-date=August 28, 2015}}</ref> Recorded with a live band and a pronounced string section, the album's "grand cinematic set of songs"<ref name="dummymag1"/> feature Bejar singing with a broader range than before: "This is the first record that I've ever done that comes close to my idea of myself as a singer", Bejar said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9651-accidental-pop-a-conversation-with-destroyers-dan-bejar/ |title=Accidental Pop: A Conversation With Destroyer's Dan Bejar |publisher=Pitchfork |date=May 25, 2015 |access-date=August 28, 2015}}</ref>

In 2017, Bejar released ''[[Ken (album)|ken]]'', an album produced by Destroyer drummer Joshua Wells (who was also a member of [[Black Mountain (band)|Black Mountain]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mergerecords.com/ken|title=ken|website=Merge Records|access-date=May 17, 2019}}</ref>

Destroyer's twelfth studio album, ''[[Have We Met]]'', was released on January 31, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/have-we-met/1481871751 |title=Have We Met by Destroyer |website=[[Apple Music]] |access-date=October 22, 2019}}</ref>

== Band name ==
In 2002, Bejar said about the band name, "I kind of wanted to go for a rock 'n' roll name. In our own special way we're tearing shit apart, you just have to listen very carefully. Musically I knew it was never going to be a metal band, but I thought lyrically there were fangs to the music."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://freewilliamsburg.com/november_2002/destoyer.html|title=An Interview with Destroyer's Dan Bejar|journal=Free Williamsburg|date=November 2002}}</ref> Bejar added in 2008, "I was actually so out of it I didn't know that there was a [[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Kiss record]] called Destroyer because I didn't know anything about [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. I still don't know anything about them. I just thought it was a cool rock-and-roll name, and I was kind of blown away that it hadn't been taken already. I was like, 'I have to use this because it's so weird that no one's used it before.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2008/03/destroyers_dan_bejar_on_the_pa.html|title=Destroyer's Dan Bejar on the Part of His New Album That Everyone Hates |publisher= Vulture|date=March 19, 2008}}</ref>

== Collaborators ==
The ever-evolving band lineup can give the impression that Destroyer is a solo project. However, Bejar has insisted "[t]he music is always collaborative and I think that gets lost in the weird cult of personality shit that seems to get whipped up around me."<ref name=lare>{{cite web|url=http://larecord.com/interviews/2008/05/16/destroyer-the-organizer-of-the-party|title=DESTROYER: THE ORGANIZER OF THE PARTY | publisher=L.A. RECORD}}</ref> Although Bejar had claimed that the lineup from certain recording sessions would be permanent, later recording sessions and tours added and dropped musicians. Several band members have the commonality of being from the production team of JC/DC ([[John Collins (Canadian musician)|John Collins]] and [[David Carswell]]).

Some songs recorded for ''Your Blues'' originated from Bejar's musical contribution to [[Sheila Heti]]'s play ''All Our Happy Days Are Stupid''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Carly Maga|url=http://torontoist.com/events/event/all-our-happy-days-are-stupid-and-weird-and-touching/|title=All Our Happy Days Are Stupid and Weird and Touching}}</ref>

On the EP ''[[Archer on the Beach]]'' (2010), Bejar worked with ambient-music composer [[Tim Hecker]] for the title track. Bejar wrote in the press release: "The reason why this has to be seen as a collaboration, rather than strictly a Destroyer release, is that, for the first time, I'm not responsible for any of the music ... aside from the vocals, the general chord progression."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/Destroyer_Teams_Up_with_Tim_Hecker_Loscil_for_New_Collaborative_Twelve-Inch|title=Destroyer Teams Up with Tim Hecker and Loscil for New Collaborative Twelve-Inch|author=Alex Hudson|date= August 23, 2010|publisher=Exclaim!}}</ref> On the B-side, the [[spoken word]] song "Grief Point", [[Loscil]] provided the music. Loscil also composed an extra track, "Loscil's Rubies", on the vinyl version of ''Destroyer's Rubies''.

American visual artist [[Kara Walker]] contributed to the lyrics for ''[[Kaputt (album)|Kaputt]]''{{'}}s "Suicide Demo (For Kara Walker)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/dan-bejar-of-destroyer-50559|title=Dan Bejar of Destroyer (Interview) |publisher=The A.V. Club}}</ref> Organized by [[Merge Records|Merge]], Walker sent cue cards with bits of text to Bejar in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.blouinartinfo.com/contemporary-arts/article/36747-walker-on-the-wild-side-dan-bejar-on-his-musical-collaboration-with-artist-kara-walker|title=Walker on the Wild Side: Dan Bejar on His Musical Collaboration With Artist Kara Walker | publisher=BLOUIN ARTINFO|author=Noel Murray|date= January 25, 2011}}</ref>

Vancouver artist and [[Hello, Blue Roses]] partner, Sydney Hermant has provided the cover art for multiple Destroyer albums, including ''We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge'', ''This Night'', ''Your Blues'' and ''Trouble in Dreams''.
