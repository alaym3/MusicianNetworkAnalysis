==Career==
===2004–13: Career beginnings and ''Spitfire''===
Entirely self-taught, Robinson began producing at the age of 12. While posting his early music on online forums he met future collaborator [[Madeon]], who was using the aliases "Daemon" and "Wayne Mont". From 2005 to 2010, under the alias "Ekowraith", he released "hands up" music via YAWA Recordings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://raverrafting.com/8-records-that-porter-robinson-released-as-ekowraith/2013/06/05/|title=8 Records That Porter Robinson Released As Ekowraith |website=raverrafting.com|date=June 5, 2013 |language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-01|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819021907/http://raverrafting.com/8-records-that-porter-robinson-released-as-ekowraith/2013/06/05/|archive-date=August 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Robinson then began producing music that he called "[[complextro]]", adding classically inspired melodies and complicated fills to his music.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/music/article/13043794/electro-wunderkind-and-selfdescribed-complextro-porter-robinson-recognizes-no-technological-constraints|title=Electro wunderkind and self-described 'complextro' Porter Robinson recognizes no technological constraints|work=Nashville Scene|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517222352/http://www.nashvillescene.com/music/article/13043794/electro-wunderkind-and-selfdescribed-complextro-porter-robinson-recognizes-no-technological-constraints|archive-date=May 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Starting to release music under his own name in 2010, Robinson released a variety of original singles on Glamara Records and Big Fish Recordings.

===2014–19: ''Worlds'' and Virtual Self===
[[File:Porter Robinson DJ.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Robinson performing on his 2013 Language Tour]]
Porter's debut studio album ''[[Worlds (Porter Robinson album)|Worlds]]'' was released through [[Astralwerks]] and [[Virgin EMI Records|Virgin EMI]] on August 12, 2014.
