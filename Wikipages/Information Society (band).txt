'''Information Society''' (also known as '''InSoc''') is an American band from [[Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota]], initially active from 1982 to 1997, primarily consisting of [[Kurt Harland|Kurt Harland Larson]], [[Paul Robb]], and [[James Cassidy (musician)|James Cassidy]]; the latter two reconvened the band in 2006, initially with [[Christopher Anton]] as lead [[vocalist]], then with Harland rejoining them as lead vocalist by 2008.

The group's breakout single was 1988's "[[What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)]]", a [[synth-pop]] song, which spent 39 weeks on the dance chart, going straight to number one and would also peak at number three on the Hot 100 pop chart. The track included a vocal [[sampling (music)|sample]] of [[Mr. Spock]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) from ''[[Star Trek]]'', saying "pure energy".

==History==
===Founding and initial albums: (1982-1992)===
[[File:AmandaKramer(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Amanda Kramer]] – Keyboardist from 1986 to 1988]]
The band was formed in Harland's dorm room in Dupre Hall at [[Macalester College]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], in 1982,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/collections/mplsmusic/band_histories.php|title=Minnesota Historical Society &#124; Minneapolis Music Collection &#124; Band Histories|website=Mnhs.org|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref> and they performed [[avant-garde]] [[electronic music]] with flourishes of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Dub music|dub]], and [[electro music|electro]]. The name was chosen partly after [[Ingsoc]], the [[newspeak]] term for English socialism in the dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insoc.org/OldDays.HTML|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708175007/http://www.insoc.org/OldDays.HTML|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2007|title=The Official Information Society (InSoc) site|date=July 8, 2007|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref> In 1983, they independently released two albums, ''[[The InSoc EP]]'' and ''[[Creatures of Influence]]''.

Two years later it released "[[Running (Information Society song)|Running]]", the group's first single, which became a hit popular in [[New York City]] [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] [[dance music|dance]] clubs and put them on the map. The song, a 7-minute excursion into [[Freestyle music|electro-freestyle]], was written and sung by Murat Konar, who left the band soon afterward. It was released on the Twin Cities-based label Twin-Tone Records, which was known for rock music rather than dance music. Its growing success led the group to move from its native [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]] to [[New York City|NYC]], and the ensuing revenues and contacts, as well as the addition of [[Amanda Kramer]] to the lineup, led the group to record its proper debut album for [[Tommy Boy Records]], which bought out the group's Twin-Tone contract because of its expertise in street-oriented music. Kramer left the band shortly after the second single "[[Walking Away (Information Society song)|Walking Away]]" was released.

InSoc was the only Tommy Boy act to have all of its albums released through major-label distribution channels rather than independent distribution, since the label, a former subsidiary of [[Warner Bros. Records]], had that option available to it throughout its years as a Warner subsidiary. In this case, Warner sub-label [[Reprise Records]] was the distributor. The group's 12-inch vinyl singles, however, were distributed through independent channels.

In addition to "What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)", the group's [[self-titled]] major release debut ''[[Information Society (album)|Information Society]]'' (1988) also produced another Top 10 ''Billboard'' entry in "[[Walking Away (Information Society song)|Walking Away]]" which reached number five on the dance chart and number nine on the Hot 100 chart. A third single, the ballad "[[Repetition (Information Society song)|Repetition]]" managed to reach number 76 on the Hot 100 also. The fourth single from the album was a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[ABBA]]'s "[[Lay All Your Love on Me]]" which reached number 23 on the dance chart and number 83 on the Hot 100.

The [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] [[Sampling (music)|samples]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'' were authorized for use on the album partially thanks to the efforts of [[Adam Nimoy]], fan of the band and son of ''Star Trek's'' [[Leonard Nimoy]]. The album sold out its initial [[record press|pressing]] in the United States in two weeks. ''Information Society'' peaked at number 25 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was certified gold within five months of its release in the US. The disc was one of the few to use [[CD+G]], which included digital graphics on the [[compact disc]] version in addition to the music.  The graphics for the CD+G portion can be seen on the Information Society Web site along with computer-based information which has been included on other releases. The songs "What's On Your Mind (Pure Energy)" and "Walking Away" were used in a sampler disc bundled with the [[Sega CD]] to showcase the console's CD+G capability, using the same graphics as the album.

During this time the band released an anonymous single (composed of two tracks from their forthcoming second album) under the name Think Tank. Years later, Robb would release tracks under the name Think Tank through the formerly-fictional record label [[Hakatak]].

They also had a song – the instrumental track "Hit Me" – placed on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]''. By 1989 Information Society joined the "[[Club MTV]] Tour" which also included [[Paula Abdul]], [[Milli Vanilli]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Was (Not Was)]] and [[Lisa Lisa]].

The second release, ''[[Hack (album)|Hack]]'' (1990), was not as successful, but had a top 40 entry with "[[Think (Information Society song)|Think]]", which also went to number five on the Dance Club/Play Songs list.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/song/information-society/how-long/421963#/song/information-society/think/3252925] {{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> "How Long" went to number 20 on the Dance Club/Play Songs list.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/song/information-society/how-long/421963#/song/information-society/how-long/421963] {{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> The album managed to sell quite well in late 1990, staying on the ''Billboard'' charts for 14 weeks, peaking at number 77.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/song/information-society/how-long/421963#/album/information-society/hack/8995] {{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> Music videos were produced for those two tracks, but only "Think" got video [[Airplay (radio)|airplay]]; the [[Adam Ant]]-directed spot for "How Long" was put aside as nobody involved was happy with it.  A third single, "Now That I Have You", was remixed and sent out to DJs but was never released. In January 1991 the band performed at the Rock In Rio II festival in front of 190,000 fans at the Maracana Stadium. In 2006 the video for "How Long" resurfaced on MTV.com, where it is still viewable as of 2010.

The group's third release, ''[[Peace and Love, Inc.]]'' (1992), proved to be more powerful and critically acclaimed, although its label failed to do much to promote it despite featuring production by [[Karl Bartos]] of German electronic music band [[Kraftwerk]]. The first single, "Peace & Love Inc.", reached number 10 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Dance Chart. A [[music video]] was produced for the track, but [[MTV]] declined to play it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} The [[album]] is also notable for being perhaps the first album ever produced to contain a track of [[modem]] tones, which, when played into a telephone connected to a computer, resulted in a bonus message from the band. To promote the album, Information Society embarked on a club tour in fall 1992 with [[Cause and Effect (band)|Cause and Effect]], but the tour was canceled when Cause and Effect frontman [[Sean Rowley (singer)|Sean Rowley]] died of complications from an asthma attack during their soundcheck in Minneapolis on November 8, 1992.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sean Rowley |url=https://variety.com/1992/scene/people-news/sean-rowley-100013/ |website=Variety.com |access-date=13 September 2019 |language=en |date=17 November 1992}}</ref>

===''Don't Be Afraid'' and Cleopatra Records: (1992-1999)===
In 1997 the band released a fourth album, ''[[Don't Be Afraid (album)|Don't Be Afraid]]'' (1997). Written and performed by [[Kurt Harland]] alone and produced by [[Steven Seibold]], DBA was more [[industrial (music)|industrial]]-driven than previous [[albums]] and reflected more of what Harland wanted to do during most of his tenure with InSoc. [[Cleopatra Records]] released the album, but — like Tommy Boy Records — did little to promote it.  Harland's love of computer-related materials continued to be evident, as the album included a [[CD-ROM]] filled with bonus material, not yet a common occurrence in 1997. The disc included a selection of [[Digital data|digital]] samples used in the [[album]]'s production, miscellaneous works of art by InSoc fans,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.music.info-society/0Dgdupg1wZA/BkaVudcRUH4J|title=Google Groups|website=Groups.google.com|access-date=2017-12-03}}</ref> a program to generate the distinctive border [[graphics]] used on the [[Album cover|album's cover]], and the [[music video]] of "Peace & Love, Inc."

There was also a carefully orchestrated digital [[scavenger hunt]] culminating in the discovery of a bonus track called "[[White Roses]]". The scavenger hunt began with decoding a modem's signal recorded at the end of the audio CD, resulting in a text message from Harland which pointed the way to a [[Web site]] where the search began. There is also a cover included of [[Gary Numan]]'s "[[Are 'Friends' Electric?]]". Also included is "Ozar Midrashim", later used as the main theme for the videogame ''[[Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver|Soul Reaver]]''.  The album eventually went out of print, but it had a second release in a remastered version in 2008, this time with "[[White Roses]]" included as an audio track.

A [[remix]] album, ''[[InSoc Recombinant]]'' (1999), was produced, featuring vocals to the band's earlier hits remixed by various artists. The vocals to songs pre-''Don't Be Afraid'' were not the originals, they were new versions re-recorded by Harland alone specifically for the remixers' use.  Included on a bonus, unadvertised CD-ROM were digital copies of most of the band's officially-produced promotional videos, including a copy of the "Peace and Love Inc." video of higher quality than that distributed with ''Don't Be Afraid.'' This CD-ROM, however, did not feature the "How Long" video.

===Compilations and ''Bands Reunited'': (1999-2005)===
In 2001, ''[[strange haircuts // cardboard guitars // and computer samples]]'' was released including all the hits from 1988 to 1992.

In 2004, [[Cleopatra Records]] released a compilation titled ''[[Pure Energy (Information Society album)|Pure Energy]]''. The release consisted of tracks from ''Don't Be Afraid'' and ''InSoc Recombinant,'' supplemented with a slightly altered mix of "Are Friends Electric?" and two new remixes of "What's On Your Mind", one by [[Effcee]], and one unattributed mix labeled "What's On Your Mind (Pure Energy)" which attempted to emulate the original Tommy Boy version of the track. Robb called the album "an insult to both the band and the fans". Harland, despite being credited as producer in the [[liner notes]], had nothing to do with the release; and while declining to either "endorse or un-endorse" the album, he did take particular issue with the cover art, both for its low quality and for its portrayal of him holding a gun. [http://community.livejournal.com/insoc/16324.html?thread=49604#t49604]

The group was featured in an episode of [[VH1]]'s ''[[Bands Reunited]]'' in November 2004.  As broadcast, it appeared that [[Aamer Haleem]] (host of the show) got every member to agree to reuniting.  However, Kurt had declined to appear in the planned concert, for reasons he later detailed in [https://web.archive.org/web/20071230112756/http://insoc.org/texts/BandReunion.HTML a post on the band's official website].  The post also details his experiences behind the scenes of the production, and how they differ from the portrayals in the episode as broadcast.

The VH1 show was followed by a period of relative quiet, although Harland, Cassidy, and Robb gave two performances at a weekend music festival in [[New York City]] on August 20–21, 2005.

===''Oscillator'', ''Synthesizer'', and ''Modulator'' releases: (2005-2009)===
In 2006, it was announced that [[Paul Robb]] and [[James Cassidy (musician)|James Cassidy]] had decided to reconvene Information Society without [[Kurt Harland]]'s full participation in the recording process. [http://community.livejournal.com/insoc/53340.html] Harland's absence in the studio line-up was cited as being due to family and work obligations. Harland ultimately contributed lead vocals to one track, "Seeds of Pain".

The new lineup included [[Christopher Anton]] as lead vocalist on ''Oscillator'' and ''Synthesizer'' and co-wrote several tracks on each including the title track of the latter.  They were also joined by Sonja Myers who played additional keyboards and provided a return to female background vocals.

[[Christopher Anton]] performed live as the lead singer for Information Society throughout 2006–2008, including shows in California, Oregon, New York, New Jersey, and São Paulo, Brazil.  By mid-2007, the band began to return to its original lineup of Harland, Cassidy, and Robb, who performed on July 21, 2007 at the Freestyle Reunion 2 Concert at Madison Square Garden. After the release of ''[[Synthesizer (album)|Synthesizer]]'', the trio performed a series of concerts in [[Philadelphia]], [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Austin]]. The concert in Philadelphia was filmed for a forthcoming DVD.

On 19 March 2007, Information Society self-released an [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Oscillator (EP)|Oscillator]]'', first as an Internet-only release – their first commercial release in over six years. This EP was later released in CD format with an extra audio track and a bonus CD-ROM video track. It includes remixes by the Brazilian duo Kain & Arvy for "I Like The Way You Werk It" (only on CD version) and "Back In The Day" (on both releases). This was followed by a new album, ''[[Synthesizer (album)|Synthesizer]]'' which was released on October 9 in North America and October 5 in Europe on [[Dancing Ferret Discs]].  The album was released digitally in North America and Europe on September 4, 2007. Several live shows in the US followed the album's release.

Information Society commissioned chiptune/micromusic artist [[8 Bit Weapon]] to remix "I Like the Way You Werk It". 8 Bit Weapon remixed the song using both a [[Commodore 64]] computer and a [[Game Boy]] Classic handheld console. The remix was titled "I Like the Way You Werk It – 8 Bit Weapon Remix".  "I Like the Way You Werk It" was also remixed by LA-based indie promoter and electronica artist Jon Hershfield.  The remix is titled "Werk It V.2."  Both Robb and Anton have been guests on Hershfield's internet radio program Isgoodmusic.com.

''[[Modulator (EP)|Modulator]]'', an EP of remixes from ''[[Synthesizer (album)|Synthesizer]]'', was released in digital-only format in September 2009. It was also included in its entirety on the "25 Years of Information Society" DVD released later that year.  Notable remixers on the ''Modulator'' EP included Dave Aude and Tommie Sunshine.  ''Modulator'' also included a live version of "Wrongful Death" and a brand new song, "Don't Touch The Devil" with Kurt on vocals.

===Reformation of classic lineup and subsequent material: (2009-present)===
In September 2014, Information Society released their first album of new material featuring the old Harland/Cassidy/Robb line-up since 1992. Robb and Harland worked on this album throughout 2013 and the first half of 2014, as well as another project, still unannounced as of October 1, 2014.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Information Society released their next album on March 11, 2016, again featuring the old Harland/Cassidy/Robb line-up. The album features numerous covers, including "Dominion" by [[The Sisters of Mercy]], "Beautiful World" by [[Devo]], and "Don't You Want Me" by [[Human League]]. Guest artists include [[Vitamin C (singer)|Vitamin C]], [[Ayria]], [[Leila Mack]], and [[Gerald V. Casale]].

The single "Nothing Prevails" was released on the Tommy Boy Records label on June 29, 2018. Two versions were made available: one with vocals in English, and one with vocals in German. A video was also released, featuring mostly still art but with some slight animation.

The singles "World Enough" and "Bennington" were released on the Tommy Boy Records label on January 11 and May 17, 2019 respectively.

In August 2021 the band released ''[[Oddfellows (Information Society album)|ODDfellows]]'', their eight album, in both a standard mix and in THX Spatial Audio, optimized for headphones.<ref name="PopMatters2021">{{cite web | title=Information Society's ''Oddfellows'' is a creative marvel | website=PopMatters | url=https://www.popmatters.com/information-society-oddfellows-album-review | access-date=2021-09-30}}</ref>

===Side projects===
Information Society's members [[Kurt Harland]] and Murat Konar's brother Mithat collaborated under the name A.K.A. They recorded two songs ("Cruel Lovin'" sung by Mithat, and "All You Ever Told Were Lies" sung by Harland) that were produced by Harland. They released a few [[12" single]]s in 1988, and one CD in 1991.
