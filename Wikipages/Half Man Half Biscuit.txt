'''Half Man Half Biscuit''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in 1984 in [[Birkenhead]], [[Merseyside]]. Known for their [[satirical]], [[sardonic]], and sometimes surreal songs, the band comprises lead singer and guitarist Nigel Blackwell, bassist and singer Neil Crossley, drummer Carl Henry, and guitarist Karl Benson.

== History ==
Half Man Half Biscuit were formed by two friends from [[Birkenhead]], Neil Crossley and singer, guitarist and songwriter Nigel Blackwell who was (in his own words) at the time "still robbing cars and playing football like normal people do".<ref name="brief"/> In 1979, Blackwell was editing a football fanzine (''Left For [[Wakeley Gage]]''); he met Crossley when he went to see the latter's band play.<ref name="Kendal">Kendal, Mark (2004) "Britain's Greatest Living Rock And Roll Satirist", ''[[The Word (magazine)|The Word]]'', Unknown Issue, p. 42-46</ref> In 1984, when Half Man Half Biscuit were formed, Crossley moved to [[bass guitar|bass]] and the two were joined by Nigel's brother Simon Blackwell (lead [[guitar]]) and his friend Paul Wright ([[drum kit|drums]]), both previously with a group called Attempted Moustache.<ref name="Strong">Strong, Martin C. (1999) ''The Great Alternative & Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|0-86241-913-1}}</ref> The quartet started to rehearse in the [[Liverpool]]-based Vulcan Studios, where they soon turned a five-piece, with David Lloyd now on [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]].<ref name="brief">{{cite web

Their debut album, 1985's ''[[Back in the DHSS]]'', topped the [[UK Indie Chart]] and reached number 60 in the [[UK Album Chart]].<ref name="Strong" /><ref name="Lazell">Lazell, Barry (1997) ''Indie Hits 1980–1989'', Cherry Red Books, {{ISBN|0-9517206-9-4}}</ref> Its title was a play on [[The Beatles]]' "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]" and also a reference to the [[DHSS]], the government department that dealt with the unemployed, Nigel Blackwell having been on [[unemployment benefits]] since 1979.<ref name="McCready">McCready, John (1985) "Tough Cookies", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 14 December 1985, p. 11</ref> The band's first single, "The [[Trumpton]] Riots", topped the British independent chart in 1986, and they went on to perform at [[Glastonbury Festival]].<ref name="Lazell" /> The second single, "Dickie Davies Eyes", also topped the indie chart.<ref name="Lazell" /> In late 1986, the band split up, giving as reason "musical similarities".<ref>{{cite web |URL=https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2014/nov/13/split-decisions |title=Split decisions |website=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=Hooper |publication-date=13 November 2014 |access-date=24 November 2014}}</ref> The album ''Back Again in the DHSS'', containing previously issued, unreleased and live tracks, followed.

The band reformed in 1990, with a performance at the [[Reading Festival]] following, and a new single, "Let's Not", issued before the year was out, followed in 1991 by a collaboration with [[Margi Clarke]] on a version of [[Edith Piaf]]'s "[[Non, je ne regrette rien|No Regrets]]". The third album was ''McIntyre, Treadmore And Davitt'', released in October 1991. By the time ''This Leaden Pall'' was released in 1993, Wright and Lloyd had left the band, with Carl Alty joining on drums. Simon Blackwell left the following year, with Ian S Jackson joining. Jackson (who later joined [[Rooney (UK band)|Rooney]]) and Alty (who joined [[Joyrider (band)|Joyrider]]) departed in 1996, to be replaced by Ken Hancock (guitar) and Carl Henry (drums). Since reforming, the band have produced an album every two or three years.

Half Man Half Biscuit were championed by DJ [[John Peel]],<ref>{{cite AV media|last=Ellen|first=Mark|author-link=Mark Ellen|title=The Old Grey Whistle Test Vol. 3|type=DVD|publisher=BBC Video|year=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/h/halfmanhalfbiscu/ |website=BBC Radio 1 |title= Keeping It Peel – Half Man Half Biscuit |access-date=14 December 2014 }}</ref><ref name="JPA">{{youtube |id=dgavqR-OwT8 |title=H is for...

Half Man Half Biscuit turned down the chance to appear on ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'', as [[Tranmere Rovers]] were playing that night, even though [[Channel Four]] offered to fly them by [[helicopter]] to the game. Blackwell has been a fan of the team since "sometime after the [[Coventry City]] cup win in 1968".<ref>[http://cobweb.businesscollaborator.com/hmhb/news/extra/0901_guar.htm Give Us An ‘R’ interview]. – Tranmere Rovers fanzine issue 52.</ref>

The band's styles parody popular genres, while their lyrics allude to UK [[popular culture]] and [[geography]]. Blackwell often refers to [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] and to North [[Wales]], often in the context of [[hillwalking]] in [[Snowdonia]]; he also appears fond of [[Shropshire]], [[East Anglia]], [[The West Country]], and [[Oxfordshire]]. British or international [[soccer|football]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Thomas Hardy]], and the [[Bible]] are referenced in his lyrics.

As the 1990s progressed, Blackwell's love of blues and folk became more apparent. Bassist Crossley's tastes include late 1970s and early 1980s [[New wave music|new wave]] or [[post-punk]] bands, and during live sets HMHB have performed [[cover version|covers]] of acts as diverse as [[Joy Division]], [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], [[Tim Buckley]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Tommy James and the Shondells]], and [[Ike and Tina Turner]].

In 2001, Blackwell provided the [[voiceover]] for a [[BP]] television advert.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,524084,00.html |title= Taking the Biscuit |date=21 July 2001 |access-date=2007-06-20 |newspaper= The Guardian | location=London | first=Kevin | last=Sampson}}</ref>

In April 2010, the band's song "Joy Division Oven Gloves" from their 2005 album ''Achtung Bono'' was the subject of a [[Facebook]] campaign to get it to No.&nbsp;6 on the chart for 12 April 2010, in response to the rumoured closure of the [[Independent music|indie]]-supporting radio station [[BBC 6 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|first=John |last=Plunkett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/07/6-music-half-man-biscuit |title=Campaign to save 6 Music takes the Biscuit |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 7 April 2010|access-date=2010-04-23 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/23/6-music-campaigners-aim-to-get-half-man-half-biscuit-in-the-char/ |title=6 Music Campaigners Aim to Get Half Man Half Biscuit in the Charts |publisher=Spinner |date=23 March 2010 |access-date=2010-04-23}}</ref> The song reached No.&nbsp;56<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/singles-chart/ |title=Singles Top 40 from the Official UK Charts Company |publisher=Theofficialcharts.com |access-date=2010-04-23}}</ref> on 11 April 2010: this was their first [[UK Singles Chart]] appearance. It also reached No.&nbsp;3 in the Official Independent Singles chart the same week, and was No.&nbsp;1 in the HMV UK Digital Downloads Top 40 Tracks on 16 April, knocking [[Ultravox]]'s song "[[Vienna (Ultravox song)|Vienna]]"  off the top spot – itself part of a separate Facebook campaign the previous week.

Victoria Loop has played live several times with the band on [[tenor horn]], [[cornet]], and bass guitar. She is affectionately known as 'The 5th Biscuit'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cobweb.businesscollaborator.com/hmhb/guest/index.htm|title=Half Man Half Biscuit : The Guest List 2017|website=Cobweb.businesscollaborator.com|access-date=1 September 2017}}</ref>

Ken Hancock played his last gig with the band in summer 2017, and was replaced at the end of the year by Karl Benson.

== Reception ==
[[Andy Kershaw]] has described Half Man Half Biscuit as "England's greatest folk band"<ref>Wade's World. [http://mikewadejournalist.blogspot.com/search/label/Dean%20Friedman "Dean Friedman bites the Biscuits"].</ref> and "the most authentic British folk band since [[The Clash]]". James Dodd on ''Bido Lito!'' praised (as many others did) Blackwell's "uncanny way of chronicling two of his greatest passions in life: television and small-town England".<ref name="bidolito">Dodd, James. [http://issuu.com/bidolito/docs/february2011 Half Man Half Biscuit]. ''Bidi Lito!''. Issue No.&nbsp;8.  February 2011. p. 14.</ref> [[Eliza Carthy]] praised the band for their "pathos disguised with wit and sarcasm", describing Blackwell as a "genius".<ref name="uncut">{{cite web |last=Hughes |first=Rob |date=June 2008 |url=http://cobweb.businesscollaborator.com/hmhb/news/extra/0806uncut.pdf |title=The Stars That Fame Forgot. Half Man Half Biscuit| work  = Uncut | page = 22| access-date= 2011-01-01}}</ref> Journalist [[Ben Myers]] has described Blackwell's lyrics as "the antithesis of most rock songs, and iconoclastic in their total avoidance of cliche".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jul/23/half-man-half-biscuit |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |title=Why Half Man Half Biscuit are wholly terrific |first=Ben |last=Myers |author-link=Ben Myers |date=23 July 2009 |access-date=27 February 2016 }}</ref>

Geoff Davies of Probe Plus recalled that after hearing a test pressing of ''Back in the D.H.S.S'', John Peel said "Geoff, what's this, I've just played the first side of this, what is it, tell me, it's just fantastic and all".<ref name="JPA"/> Other famous Peel quotes about the band include "I've said it before, a national treasure, there's no question about it. When I die, I want them to be buried with me." (14 August 1996) and "In a decently ordered society, members of Half Man Half Biscuit would be routinely carried shoulder high through the streets of every city they visited" (10 July 1997).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.probe-plus.co.uk/index.php/probe-plus-bands |website=Probe Plus |title=Probe Plus Bands – Half Man Half Biscuit |access-date=14 December 2014 }}</ref>

According to music writer [[Paul Du Noyer]]:
:"The genius of Half Man Half Biscuit is that they took just enough of Scouse culture to give themselves an edge, but kept their distance too. From their Wirral bastion they issue occasional dispatches of wry hilarity and downbeat, satirical bite. The songs of their leader, Nigel Blackwell, suggest a very real world of people too educated to be on the dole but too luckless or lazy to be anywhere else. They take a witty revenge on the drivel of popular culture, without denying their fascination with it. They seem flintily incorruptible, and scan the London music media with a mocking eye for cant."<ref>{{cite book |title=Liverpool – Wondrous Place: From the Cavern to the Capital of Culture |last=Du Noyer |first=Paul |page=204 |date=8 November 2007 |orig-year=2002 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0753512692 }}</ref>

English writer [[Julie Burchill]] has praised their "supremely clever and funny lyrics", and described the band as "punk with a sense of humour and a sense of perspective".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2016/03/how-half-man-half-biscuit-have-forged-career-mocking-middle-class |title=How Half Man Half Biscuit have forged a career mocking middle-class idiocy |first=Julie |last=Burchill |author-link=Julie Burchill |journal=[[New Statesman]] |date=3 March 2016 |access-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>

References to Half Man Half Biscuit can be found on episodes of ''[[EastEnders]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Half Man Half Biscuit namecheck on Britain's favourite soap |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRbMwvb73Ts |website=YouTube |access-date=10 August 2018}}</ref> ''[[Brookside (television programme)|Brookside]]'', ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' and ''[[Byker Grove]]'', as well as an episode of ''[[Football Focus]]'' and the BBC serial ''Elidor''. The cricket commentator [[David Lloyd (cricketer, born 1947)|David 'Bumble' Lloyd]] often makes reference to songs and lyrics in commentaries, often completely lost on other commentators working with him.
