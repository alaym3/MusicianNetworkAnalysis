'''The Tiger Lillies''' are a cult British musical trio formed in 1989 by singer-songwriter [[Martyn Jacques]]. Described as the forefathers of Brechtian Punk Cabaret,<ref>{{cite web|last=Meads|first=Glenn|title=Tiger Lillies play Queer Contact Date: 21 December 2011|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/blackpool-theatre/news/12-2011/tiger-lillies-play-queer-contact_5887.html|work=What's on Stage|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the Tiger Lillies are well known for their unique sound and style which merges "the macabre magic of pre-war Berlin with the savage edge of punk".<ref>{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Tom|title=The Tiger Lillies – 20 years of deviant theatrics|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/19268/The-Tiger-Lillies--20-years-of-deviant-theatrics|work=Faster Louder|accessdate=5 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307021532/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/19268/The-Tiger-Lillies--20-years-of-deviant-theatrics|archive-date=7 March 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==History==
The band's name is rumoured to have been inspired by a murdered Soho sex worker called Lillie who used to dress up in animal print.<ref>{{cite news|last=McCall|first=Chris|title=Music Beyond The Edge: The Tiger Lillies|url=http://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/99729-music_beyond_edge_tiger_lillies|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=Fest|date=15 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407034230/https://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/99729-music_beyond_edge_tiger_lillies|archive-date=7 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite news|last=Goldsmith|first=Kenneth|title=Criminal Castrati: The Tiger Lillies|url=http://wfmu.org/~kennyg/popular/articles/tigerlillies.html|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=New York Press|date=13 May 1998}}</ref> Jacques, however, has stated that he named the band after a painting he had on his wall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: The Tiger Lillies|url=https://www.tigerlillies.com/news/deviant-nationcom-interview|work=Deviant Nation|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref> The band formed in 1989 when Martyn Jacques placed an ad on [[Loot (magazine)|Loot]] looking for a drummer and a bass player for a new band.

In Spring 2012 Adrian Huge decided to take a leave of absence and was replaced by drummer Mike Pickering who toured with the Tiger Lillies from 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tigerlillies.com/450596/news/mister-huge.|title=Mister Huge.|date=April 3, 2012|website = www.tigerlillies.com|publisher=The Tiger Lillies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425102722/http://www.tigerlillies.com/450596/news/mister-huge.|archivedate=April 25, 2012}}</ref> In early 2015 Pickering was in turn replaced by the band's current drummer, Jonas Golland.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Jonas Golland {{!}} Band {{!}} The Tiger Lillies|url = https://www.tigerlillies.com/band/jonas-golland|website = www.tigerlillies.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}</ref>

==Musical style==
''[[The Independent]]'' has described The Tiger Lillies as "a provocative and avant-garde three-piece band that combines cabaret, vaudeville, music-hall and street theatre",<ref>{{cite news|last=Cripps|first=Charlotte|title=Dark Tales of the Unexpected|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/dark-tales-of-the-unexpected-77750.html|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=The Independent|date=11 November 2003}}</ref> while Tim Arthur of [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] has given a more evocative description: "Imagine Kurt Weill conjuring up images of prewar Berlin while a falsetto vocalist screams, squeaks and squawks his way through every number like some rambling madman, and you've got the picture".<ref>{{cite news|last=Arthur|first=Tim|title=Time Out Review|url=https://www.tigerlillies.com/music/the-brothel-to-the-cemetary#roll-up|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=Time Out London|date=9 November 1996|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706121242/https://www.tigerlillies.com/music/the-brothel-to-the-cemetary#roll-up|archivedate=6 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Notorious for singing controversial songs involving bestiality, prostitution, blasphemy and all other vice imaginable, The Tiger Lillies are undoubtedly not for the easily offended.<ref>{{cite web|last=D.|first=Keith|title=FRINGE REVIEW – The Tiger Lillies Live in Concert (Pleasance)|url=http://www.edinburghspotlight.com/2010/08/review-the-tiger-lillies-live-in-concert-pleasance/|work=Edinburgh Spotlight|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Cobley|first=Mike|title=The Tiger Lillies: Stories Full Of Eccentricity, Blasphemy & Weirdness!|url=http://magazine.brighton.co.uk/?SEC_ID=1&CAT_ID=21&ART_ID=2406|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=Brighton Magazine|date= 4 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Music review: The Tiger Lillies|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/music-review-the-tiger-lillies-1-766400|accessdate=5 July 2015|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=23 August 2009}}</ref>  Their musical style is mainly influenced by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]]'s masterpiece [[The Threepenny Opera]] and pre-war Berlin cabaret but other influences such as gypsy and circus music, French chanson and British music hall tunes are also evident.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fractal|first=Suicide|title=Interviews: Martyn Jacques of The Tiger Lillies|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Martyn+Jacques+of+The+Tiger+Lillies/|work=Suicide Girls|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>
