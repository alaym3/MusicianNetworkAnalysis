'''Idoli''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Идоли}}; trans. The Idols) were a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[New wave music|new wave]] band from [[Belgrade]]. They are considered to be one of the most notable acts of the [[SFR Yugoslav pop and rock scene|Yugoslav rock scene]], and their 1982 album ''[[Odbrana i poslednji dani]]'' was on several occasions voted by the music critics as the greatest Yugoslav rock album.<ref>{{cite book |title=YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike |last1=Antonić |first1=Duško |last2=Štrbac |first2=Danilo |year=1998 |publisher=YU Rock Press |location=Belgrade |page=5}}</ref><ref name="rollingstone7">{{cite journal|title=Rolling Stone - Specijalno izdanje: 100 najboljih albuma 1955 - 2015|journal=Rolling Stone|publisher=S3 Mediji|location=Zagreb|issue=Special editidon|page=7|language=hr}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Merlin and Zvuk Ulice ===
The roots of Idoli can be found in a band called Merlin (not to be confused with the [[Dino Merlin|Sarajevo pop rock band of the same name]]) and then Zvuk Ulice consisting of [[Vladimir Divljan|Vlada Divljan]] on guitar and vocals, bassist [[Zdenko Kolar]], keyboard player Dragan Mitrić, drummer [[Kokan Popović]], Bora Antić on saxophone and Dragana Milković on piano and vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hellomagazin.rs/2018/03/04/tri-godine-bez-vlade-divljana/|title=Tri godine bez Vlade Divljana|date=4 March 2018|publisher=Hello Magazin|language=sh}}</ref> The band played a combination of jazz and pop rock. Besides performing cover versions of notable foreign bands from the sixties, the band wrote their own songs. In 1978, the band performed at the [[Novi Sad]] [[BOOM Festival]] and at the [[Zaječar]] [[Gitarijada]] feastival.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://barikada.com/zvuk-ulice-kao-zacaran/|title=Zvuk Ulice Kao Začaran|date=3 November 2018}}</ref> Even though the band had several recording sessions in [[Radio Belgrade]], none of the material was released. Mitrić went to [[Bulevar (band)|Bulevar]] and Popović went to [[Slađana Milošević]]'s band.

=== VIS Dečaci and formation of the band ===
The first ideas of forming Idoli came up in 1979 when a youth magazine published photos of a band called Dečaci which were actually photos of the first Idoli lineup. The photos featured witty remarks like, for example on March 8, 1979, a photo signed "Dečaci emancipuju žene" ("The Boys emancipate women"). At the same time [[Belgrade]] walls were ornamented with graffiti announcing the formation of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nedeljnik.rs/knjiga-o-milutinu-pobedila-je-nasu-odbranu-srdan-saper-za-novi-nedeljnik-povodom-40-godina-novog-talasa/|title="Knjiga o Milutinu" pobedila je našu "Odbranu": Srđan Šaper za novi Nedeljnik povodom 40 godina novog talasa|date=3 November 2020|first=Branko|last=Rosić|publisher=Nedeljnik|language=sh}}</ref> "Margita je dečak" ("Margita is a boy", the first ever graffiti in Belgrade dedicated to [[Margita Stefanović]] who later became [[Ekaterina Velika|Katarina II]] keyboardist), "Dečaci ne plaču" ("Boys Don't Cry") or "Srđane budi čovek" ("Srđan, be a man") are only a few examples.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiosarajevo.ba/magazin/tech/margita-je-decak-danas-bi-magi-stefanovic-imala-57-godina/221247|title=Margita je dečak: Danas bi Magi Stefanović imala 57 godina|date=1 April 2016|publisher=Radio Sarajevo|language=sh}}</ref> Having created a media campaign and gained the public's attention, the band had to prove their existence and start playing.

VIS Idoli was officially formed on March 1, 1980 when the band had their first rehearsal. The first lineup consisted of primary school friends [[Vlada Divljan]] (guitar, vocals), Zdenko Kolar (bass), Boža Jovanović (drums) and [[Vlada Divljan|Divljan]]'s high school friends [[Srđan Šaper]] (percussion, vocals) and [[Nebojša Krstić]] (percussion). At that time the band collaborated with [[Dragan Papić]] who was a kind of media activist. The band manipulated the media very well. For example, they were to announce a change to the band's name on several occasions and the new names would be "Apoloni 5" (Appolos 5) or "Idoli plus bradonje" ("The Idols plus the bearded") because of Kolar and Jovanović's wearing beards.

In June 1980, the band made their first live appearance at Belgrade's SKC (Student's Cultural Center) with the leading [[Serbia]]n [[New wave music|new wave]] acts. After a month of existence, the band released their first single with a magazine called "Vidici" and it consisted of two tracks, "Pomoć, pomoć" ("Help, help") and "Retko te viđam sa devojkama" ("I Rarely See You With Girls"), a song with a gay-hint.<ref name="blic_08">{{cite web|url=https://www.blic.rs/komentar/duh-osamdesetih/idoli-jedna-karijera/xqdykvh|title="Idoli" - jedna karijera|date=17 June 2008|publisher=blic.rs|language=sh}}</ref> Already parting ways with Papić, the band recorded another version of the track as a B-side of Maljčiki single, but this time in [[Zagreb]] with the producer [[Goran Bregović]]. At the 1980 [[Festival Omladina]], which had been delayed from May to the autumn due to [[Josep Broz Tito|Tito]]'s passing, new wave bands from [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]] met for the first time. Idoli appeared with the track "Zašto su danas devojke ljute?" ("Why Are The Girls Angry Today?") and won one of the prizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=148511|title=Niko kao ja|date=3 May 2001|publisher=Vreme|language=sh|first=Petar|last=Janjatović}}</ref>

Idoli, with [[Električni Orgazam]] and [[Šarlo akrobata|Šarlo Akrobata]] participated in the project called ''[[Paket aranžman]]'' with four tracks, "Schwule Über Europa" (German for "Gays Over Europe", a parody on the attitude towards Germans) "Plastika" ("Plastic"), "[[Maljčiki]]" (Russian for "Boys", a parody on Social-Realist art and propaganda) and "Amerika" ("America"). The promotional video for "[[Maljčiki]]" was banned on national television and some radio stations after the Soviet embassy responded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prva.rs/zivot/zivotne-price/120959/vlada-divljan-decak-koji-je-imao-stav-i-smelost-.html|title=Vlada Divljan, dečak koji je imao stav i smelost|date=2 September 2017|publisher=Prva.rs}}</ref>

===Commercial success===
The band had its first independent concert on June 25 at the garden of [[Belgrade]]'s SKC. The scalpers sold the tickets four times the original price. The opening acts were [[Bezobrazno Zeleno]], [[VIA Talas]], [[Marko Brecelj]] and Feo Volarić.

The next release was a [[VIS Idoli (EP)|self-titled EP]] or mini LP as it was called in former [[Yugoslavia]], featuring six tracks including a cover version of [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]" ("Hajde") and [[Darko Kraljić]]'s "Devojko mala", with two different music videos. [[Film (band)|Film]] members Mladen Juričić (also known as Max Wilson) playing harmonica and Jurij Novoselić (also known as Kuzma Videosex) who played organ made guest appearances. The record was produced by another [[Film (band)|Film]] member, Ivan Stančić Piko. The cover of the album is the Red Nude by [[Amedeo Modigliani]]. [[Jugoton]] later re-released the EP with [[Film (band)|Film]]'s live EP in [[Kulušić]] as a compilation album ''Zajedno''. A tour with [[Film (band)|Film]] came in 1981 when they traveled in a boat and played in sea side resorts. In the summer of 1981, a new drummer became [[Kokan Popović]] who previously played with Divljan and Kolar in Merlin and Zvuk Ulice.

The band started recording their first album in autumn 1981 with [[Goran Vejvoda]] and Dušan Mihajlović Spira who ought to have been the assistant producer as they wanted to produce the record by themselves. After a short period Mihajlović left and the only assistance was Mile Miletić Pile. The recording of the album took more than four hundred hours which was a record in former Yugoslavia still to be broken. Guests on the album were [[Bebi Dol]] who did backing vocals on "Odbrana" ("Defence"), and Vuk Vujačić, Goran Grbić and Slobodan Grozdanović were a brass section on "Senke su drugačije" ("The Shadows Are Different"). ''[[Odbrana i poslednji dani]]'' came out in early 1982. It got the name from a [[Borislav Pekić]] book with the same title on which the whole album is based. It is a complex concept album dealing with an anthropological approach towards orthodoxy. The track "Poslednji dani" ("The Last Days") originally entitled "Maršal" ("Marshall"), dedicated to former Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito]], did not include the last verse due to the record company disapproval. A detail from a cloth on a [[Saint Nicholas]] icon was used as the cover and the font used on the record was a [[Cyrillic]] font similar to the one used in the [[Miroslav's Gospel]]. The band won the best album and the best cover award in 1982. In 1986 Yugoslav rock critics voted ''[[Odbrana i poslednji dani]]'' the best [[Yugoslav rock]] album of the 20th century.

In July 1982, [[Zdenko Kolar]] went to serve in the army and his replacement was [[Bulevar (band)|Bulevar]] bassist [[Branko Isaković]]. The band started recording a new album in [[London]] with producer Bob Painter. Even though they changed their style to pop/rock, ''[[Čokolada (album)|Čokolada]]'' went platinum and the title track became their greatest commercial hit. There was a slight scandal about the track being composed by Dušan Gerzić for the band Via Talas and Šaper presenting it as an Idoli track. However, Gerzić was credited co-author on "[[Bambina (Idoli song)|Bambina]]" which was released as a single. For this record Divljan wrote only "Radostan dan", "Vetar i zastave" and "Ja sam tu" (for which Divljan added a verse from [[Mišo Kovač]] track "Plakat će zora" written by Drago Britvić) because he was about to graduate mining and geology at the [[University of Belgrade]]. At the same time Šaper graduated from his studies in movie directing. Guest appearances on the album were reporter Vivien Goldman who was a guest vocalist and producer Bob Painter who played the keyboards. The original idea was to release a double EP called "U gradu bez sna", but [[Jugoton]] refused and released it as a long play album.

=== Breakup and post-breakup ===
After performing in [[Ljubljana]], in March 1984, due to conflicts between the members, the band ceased to exist. The last Idoli release was a soundtrack for the movie ''Šest dana juna'' directed by Dinko Tucaković. Most of the soundtrack was written by Divljan, while other members took part in the recording process. Šaper did the vocals, Kolar and Isaković did the bass, Piko Stančić and Boban Đorđević did the drums, keyboards were recorded by Đorđe Petrović and Dragan Ilić and guitars by [[Ekaterina Velika|Katarina II]] member [[Dragomir Mihajlović|Dragomir Mihajlović "Gagi"]] and saxophone by Vuk Vujačić. Guest vocalists were [[Mišo Kovač]] on "Da je duži moj dan" ("If my day was longer") and folk singer Jahija Gračanlić (also known as the Cosmic Bosnian) on "Ja je zovem meni da se vrate" ("I Am Calling Her To Come Back") appearing instead of a Divljan's gay-themed folk song "Zaljubljen sam u svog jarana" ("I am in love with my buddy") that remains unreleased to this day.

Following the breakup, [[Nebojša Krstić|Krstić]] and Šaper wrote music for the singer [[Bilja Krstić|Biljana Krstić]], they also recorded an album called ''Poslednja mladost u Jugoslaviji'' with the band Unutrašnja Imperija (consisting of [[Dragomir Mihajlović|Dragomir Mihajlović "Gagi"]] (guitar), Branko Isaković (bass) and Dragoljub Đuričić (drums)). In 1995 the two recorded one more album this time forming a band Dobrovoljno Pevačko Društvo with [[Kiki Lesendrić|Zoran Kiki Lesendrić]] from [[Piloti (band)|Piloti]]. The [[CD]] was called "Nedelja Na Duhove and was released through [[Eastfield Music]]. The album was recorded in [[Budapest]] and produced and arranged by [[Kiki Lesendrić]]. As studio musicians appeared Nenad Stefanović Japanac (bass and guitar), Milan Đurđević (keyboards), Istvan Alapi (guitar) and Zoltan Hetenyi (drums). Backing vocals were done by Aleksandra and Kristina Kovač.

After the album release, the two quit their musical careers. Šaper started a marketing business with his firm "Idols & Friends", worked as a creative director in "Saatchi & Saatchi" and "Ogilvy & Mather" and lately is the head of "McErricson". He acted and wrote the theme for "Davitelj protiv davitelja" and directed music videos and worked on TV and movie soundtracks. He is also active in politics and is head of the [[Serbia]]n [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]]. [[Nebojša Krstić|Krstić]] became a physician, working at the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] and then at the Hyatt Regency hotel in [[Belgrade]]. He also acted in the film ''Šest dana juna''. After his medical career he took up marketing until he became president [[Boris Tadić]]'s advisor. He is also a member of the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]].

Kokan Popović and Dragan Mitrić (who played keyboards in Zvuk Ulice, but was not a member of Idoli) were also in a band called [[Propaganda (Serbian band)|Propaganda]] which released only one album in 1982, partially featuring material from the Zvuk Ulice period. Popović now lives in [[Johannesburg]] and in 2006 he presented to the [[Belgrade]] audience with his band Kokan and the Traitors which consists of [[Serbs|Serbian]] musicians living in [[Johannesburg]].
