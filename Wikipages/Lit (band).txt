==History==
===Pre-Lit (1986–1995)===
Guitarist Jeremy Popoff and bassist Kevin Baldes met in 1986, and soon after, began playing music together. In 1987, Popoff (guitar), Jerry Neel (bass), Dave Barber (drums) and Derek Johnson (vocals) formed the band Strate Lace and performed three live shows together: The Troubador in Hollywood, The Waters Club in San Pedro, and a back-to-school party in a friend's backyard. Neel quit the band early on to pursue a career in the mortgage industry and Johnson would go on to attend the Trebas Institute of Recording Arts in Hollywood, California, where he learned to produce and engineer. On February 20, 2003, Derek Johnson was among the 100 killed in [[The Station nightclub fire|the nightclub fire]] while attending a Great White concert at [[The Station nightclub fire|The Station]] in West Warwick, Rhode Island.<ref>[http://archive.boston.com/news/local/specials/station_nightclub_fire/victims/derek_johnson/ Portraits of people who died in the R.I. nightclub fire – Boston.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Meanwhile, around 1988, high school friends Baldes (15 or 16 at the time) and Jeremy Popoff's brother, A. Jay, (14 at the time) formed the pop metal band Razzle. The lineup being Kevin Baldes (lead vocals, bass), A. Jay Popoff (drums), and Sean Holland (guitar). They performed their first show on June 26, 1988, at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]]. In 1989, A. Jay switched from drums to lead vocals, and the band added guitarist Jeremy Popoff and drummer [[Allen Shellenberger]]. Things began to come together in 1990, when the group released a demo tape (engineered by Derek Johnson, the singer of Strate Lace) and an EP entitled ''New Vibe Revolution'' in 1993. Razzle dissolved in 1993 and became Stain in 1994, which had a much harder and heavier sound. They released a demo tape in 1995 and eventually signed with Malicious Vinyl in 1995. After finding out the name "Stain" was already owned, the band changed their name to Lit.

===''Tripping the Light Fantastic'' (1996–1997)===
On April 1, 1997, the group released ''[[Tripping the Light Fantastic (album)|Tripping the Light Fantastic]]'' on the Malicious Vinyl record label.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Lit continued to grow their local and national fan base playing locally and touring with alternative bands such as Radish (Ben Kweller), Lifter and Reel Big Fish. Malicious Vinyl (owned by Hip Hop label Delicious Vinyl) lost its national distribution shortly after''Tripping the Light Fantastic'' was released, which allowed the band to get out of their recording contract. They spent the next few months writing songs and showcasing for various major record labels. Lit signed with [[RCA Records]] in 1998.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===The RCA years and mainstream success (1998–2002)===
Lit gained world wide popularity with their second album ''[[A Place in the Sun (Lit album)|A Place in the Sun]]'', released in February 1999. ''A Place in the Sun'' yielded the massive hit single "[[My Own Worst Enemy (song)|My Own Worst Enemy]]", topping the [[Alternative Airplay|Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart for a total of 11 weeks and receiving a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Music Award for the biggest modern rock song of 1999. It was followed by "[[Zip-Lock (song)|Zip-Lock]]" (which featured [[Blink-182]] in the video) and "[[Miserable (song)|Miserable]]", the latter of which was among the top ten most played songs of 2000 and featured [[Pamela Anderson]] in the video, as a [[giantess]] who lets the band walk on different parts her body before eventually betraying and [[Vorarephilia|devouring]] them all. Shortly after, the album was certified [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the US and [[music recording sales certification|gold]] in Canada, becoming the band's best selling album. The band performed over 286 shows and toured worldwide in support of ''A Place in the Sun''. In addition to the [[Vans Warped Tour]] and a slot on [[Woodstock 1999]], the band toured with [[The Offspring]], [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], and [[No Doubt]]. The band's tracks also appeared in soundtracks of ''[[Ready to Rumble]]'' and ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]],'' and appeared in the movie ''Replicate'' and the TV series ''[[V.I.P. (American TV series)|V.I.P.]]'' starring [[Pamela Anderson]]. The band became staples on late night television shows The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with Conan O'Brien, Later with Craig Kilborn and appeared regularly on MTV TRL, Spring Break and guitarist Jeremy Popoff appeared in an episode of MTV Cribs.

Lit followed up ''A Place in the Sun'' with the 2001 release of ''[[Atomic (Lit album)|Atomic]]''. The band's highest charting single was "[[Lipstick and Bruises]]" which reached top 10 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Lit toured to support ''Atomic,'' which began with a headlining US tour that scheduled to begin on September 11, 2001 in New Jersey, the same day as the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. The band continued to tour, appear on television and movies, and also released two albums from Handsome Devil and The Color Red who the band signed to their Dirty Martini label, distributed by RCA.

===Self-titled album and death of Allen Shellenberger (2003–2009)===
Lit continued to tour the states, including several festivals, before the release of their self-titled ''Lit'' on the [[DRT Entertainment]] label on June 24, 2004. The single "Looks Like They Were Right" made it on the Top 40 charts. That year the group also put out its first long-form [[DVD]], ''All Access'', on November 16, 2004.

On May 5, 2008, Lit announced that drummer Allen Shellenberger was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Shellenberger immediately underwent clinical trials, chemotherapy and radiation at the Cedars-Sinai Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute. It was discovered that the tumor was [[malignant glioma]] and was incurable. His treatments were documented in a piece on ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' that aired in the same month. Lit canceled their scheduled tour dates with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] due to Shellenberger's diagnosis. On July 26, 2008, Lit held a benefit concert for him at the [[House of Blues]] in Anaheim, California. A number of bands performed including [[Sugar Ray]] and [[Handsome Devil (band)|Handsome Devil]]. [[No Doubt]] drummer [[Adrian Young]] filled in for Shellenberger for a couple of songs. Both drummers also played at the same time for a few songs. Shellenberger's last show with the band was September 28, 2008 at [[Paramount Studios]] for Paramount Rocks. He died from the cancer on August 13, 2009, at the age of 39.<ref name="consequenceofsound.net">{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2009/08/14/lit-drummer-allen-shellenberger-dead-at-39/|title=Lit drummer Allen Shellenberger dead at 39|access-date=August 14, 2009|publisher=Consequenceofsound.net}}</ref>
