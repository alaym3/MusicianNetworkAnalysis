'''Danger Doom''' (stylized as '''DANGERDOOM''') was a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] project consisting of [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]] and [[MF DOOM]]. Their first album, ''[[The Mouse and the Mask]]'', was released in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mouse-Mask-Danger-Doom/dp/B000B9EYDY |title=Mouse & The Mask (Dig): Danger Doom: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |access-date=2011-01-06}}</ref> and followed by the ''[[Occult Hymn]]'' EP in 2006.

==Background==
Danger Mouse and MF DOOM had previously collaborated on "Social Distortion" from [[Prince Po]]'s ''[[The Slickness]]'', Danger Mouse's remix of [[Zero 7]]'s "Somersault", and the track "November Has Come" from [[Gorillaz]]' second studio album, ''[[Demon Days]]''.

MF DOOM had stated that he hoped there would be a second DANGERDOOM album in which he would "rap from the perspective of the cartoons and in their voices, rather than simply create stories around them".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61003/danger-doom-hopes-to-make-second-cd |title=Danger Doom Hopes To Make Second CD |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=2011-01-06}}</ref> Danger Mouse was also slated to reunite with MF DOOM in 2008,<ref name="burntoj">[http://burntorangejuice.wordpress.com/2008/03/11/danger-mouse-beck-dangerbeck/ Danger Mouse + Beck = DangerBeck]</ref> though this never occurred.

Much of DANGERDOOM's music has been filled with material from and endorsed by [[Adult Swim]], a block of animated television shows airing on cable's [[Cartoon Network]]. 

[[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]], [[Meatwad]], [[Carl Brutananadilewski]], [[Ignignokt]], and [[Mooninites|Err]] from the Adult Swim television show [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]] all make appearances on ''The Mouse and the Mask''. References to other Adult Swim shows are found in the song "El Chupa Nibre", in which the voices of [[Brak (character)|Brak]] (from ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' and ''[[The Brak Show]]'') and [[Lois Griffin]] (from ''[[Family Guy]]'') are heard. Both the song's title and its lines "Chew an MC like El Chupa Nibre/Digest a group and sell the poop on eBay" reference the show [[Futurama]]. Two songs, "Perfect Hair" and "A.T.H.F.",  are direct references on the shows from which they derive their names, "[[Perfect Hair Forever]]" and "[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]".  The song Basket Case also has [[Harvey Birdman]], Mentok the Mind taker, and other characters in the show [[Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law]], another show on Adult Swim. The song "Sofa King" is also an Aqua Teen Hunger Force reference.  It features the Aqua Teen Hunger Force cast and BillyWitchDoctor.com from the episode "[[Video Ouija]]." DANGERDOOM's music has also been played on Adult Swim; one of these songs is "Space Ho's".

DANGERDOOM was awarded Best Hip-Hop album of the year by PLUG Independent Music Awards for their album, ''[[The Mouse and the Mask]]''.
