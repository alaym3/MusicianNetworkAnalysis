The '''Poxy Boggards''' are an [[United States|American]] [[folk music|folk]] band based in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. The band was founded in 1994 by Stuart Venable and [[Bill Roper (video game producer)|Bill Roper]], and first performed that year at the [[Renaissance Fair|Southern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire]]. Since that time, they have achieved success in the re-burgeoning [[Music of Ireland|Irish]]-folk movement, playing with bands such as [[The Fenians]]. The 13 members of the band are all singers and instrumentalists. Their music has been described as a mix of tight, right harmonies, rocking instrumentation with traditional folk instruments and an irreverent, often shocking sense of humor and lack of decorum.

The Boggards have played at numerous venues throughout Southern California, including the [[Galaxy Theatre]], the [[House of Blues]] in [[Anaheim]], the [[El Rey Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]], and the [[Musicians Institute]] in Hollywood.

At the 2006 Just Plain Folks Music Awards, they received Best Celtic Album for ''Liver Let Die'' and Live Act of the Year for their 2004 performance at the awards show.

On Sunday, February 7, 2010, one of the Poxy Boggards' songs (''I Wear No Pants'' from their CD ''Liver Let Die'') was featured in a commercial for Levi-Strauss/Dockers, which aired during [[Super Bowl XLIV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/dockersreg-debuts-ldquomen-without-pantsrdquo,1133095.shtml|title=Earth Times|website=Earthtimes.org|accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref> The song was also featured in the Shazam app's combined promotion with Dockers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/121125/shazam-to-tag-dockers-super-bowl-ad.html|title=MediaPost|website=mediapost.com|accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref>

In October of 2016, the band appeared on [[Hell's Kitchen (American season 16)]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hell's Kitchen (U.S.) Uncensored - Season 16, Episode 5 - Full Episode |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P56FmrRX-1Y |website=YouTube}}</ref>

== Video games ==
During Roper's tenure at the gaming company [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]], the music of the Poxy Boggards was featured in the game ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]''.
Roper was also the CEO of [[Flagship Studios]], makers of [[Hellgate: London]] and [[Mythos (video game)|Mythos]], where several members of the band did voice-over work for Mythos.

The Song "Bring Us More Beer" was re-recorded by Stu Venable, Bill Roper, Heather Green, and Elspeth Golden as an instrumental track re-titled "Bring Us More" for the Pirates of the Caribbean play set in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]''.

== Hidden tracks and guest artists ==
Early in their career, the [[hidden track]] from their first CD was played on the [[Dr. Demento]] show. ''Inbred Local'' was a thematic departure from their [[Renaissance]]-inspired music and set a trend for including a hidden track at the end of many of their albums released under the [[Angry Folk]] label.

On their fourth album, ''Liver, Let Die'', guest artists are listed as "Proxy Boggards".
