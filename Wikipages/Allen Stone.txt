== Early life ==

Allen did not discover soul music until he was a teenager, and started collecting classic albums from the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name="A Brief History" /> He was 15 when he heard [[Stevie Wonder]]'s 1973 album ''[[Innervisions]]''.<ref name="SF Gate" />

When [[Stacie Orrico]], a close friend of Allen's as a teen, became successful in music, Stone decided to become serious about his musical career.<ref name=Billboard /> Orrico released a record and had become successful. "She was traveling, singing everywhere, and recording," Stone related. "She was just a year older than me and I was like, 'Man that would be so much fun to do, sing and actually have people listen.'"<ref name=Billboard />

When Stone was 18, he moved to Spokane, where he attended community college for a semester followed by a year at Moody Bible Institute in Spokane.<ref name="SF Gate" /> After that year, Stone had an epiphany. He stated in an interview with SF Gate, "I learned the history of the church and the conception of the Bible and learned about the religion and really just, like, didn't believe it... I got to the point where it was like, 'I don't believe this is the truth.'"<ref name="SF Gate" /> Not long after, he moved to [[Seattle]] to pursue his musical career.

==Social commentary in music==
On Allen Stone's self-titled album, a few songs discuss social and political issues, such as "Unaware", "Contact High", and "What I've Seen".

A live music video of "Unaware – Allen Stone – Live From His Mother's Living Room" on Stone's YouTube account has been viewed over 13,000,000 times. Stone wanted to have a different and weird setting for this video, so they recorded it on a set that looked like a living room.
