==Career==
By the age of 20, Cray had seen his heroes [[Albert Collins]], [[Freddie King]] and [[Muddy Waters]] in concert and decided to form his own band; they began playing college towns on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In the late 1970s he lived in [[Eugene, Oregon]], where he formed the Robert Cray Band and collaborated with [[Curtis Salgado]] in the Cray-Hawks. In the 1978 film ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', Cray was the uncredited bassist in the house party band [[Otis Day and the Knights]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===1980s===

Cray released the album ''[[Who's Been Talkin']]'' on [[Tomato Records]] in 1980. Two albums on [[HighTone Records]] in the mid-1980s, ''[[Bad Influence (Robert Cray album)|Bad Influence]]'' and ''[[False Accusations]]'', were moderately successful in the United States and in Europe, where he was building a reputation as a live artist.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In 1985, he released the album ''Showdown!'' with his hero Albert Collins and [[Johnny Copeland]].

Cray was signed to [[Mercury Records]] and in 1986 released his fourth album, ''[[Strong Persuader]]'', produced by Dennis Walker, which received a [[Grammy Award]], while the [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] [[single (music)|single]] "Smoking Gun" gave him wider appeal and name recognition.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Under the pseudonym "Night Train Clemons", he recorded with [[Ted Hawkins]] in 1986.<ref name="bare"/> He was invited by [[Keith Richards]] to join the backing band for [[Chuck Berry]] in the 1987 film, ''Chuck Berry: [[Hail!

By now, Cray was an opening act for such major stars as [[Eric Clapton]] and sold out larger venues as a solo artist.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Cray has generally played Fender guitars ([[Telecaster]]s and [[Stratocaster]]s) and there are two signature Robert Cray Stratocasters models available from Fender. The Robert Cray Custom Shop Stratocaster is made in the U.S. in the Fender custom shop and is identical to the guitars that Cray currently plays, while the [[Robert Cray Standard Stratocaster]] is a less-expensive model made in Fender's [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], [[Mexico]] plant.

===1990s===

Cray had the opportunity to play alongside [[John Lee Hooker]] on his album ''Boom Boom'', playing the guitar solo in the song "Same Old Blues Again". He is also featured on the Hooker album, ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]''; he plays a guitar solo on the song "Baby Lee". The entire Robert Cray Band backs Hooker on the title track of his 1992 album ''Mr. Lucky'', where Cray plays lead guitar, sings, and banters with Hooker throughout the song.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The band also appears on two songs off [[B.B. King]]'s 1993 duet album ''[[Blues Summit]]'': the duet between King and Cray, which was written by Cray and Dennis Walker specifically for the project and called "Playin' With My Friends", and the duet between King and John Lee Hooker ("You Shook Me").<ref>{{Citation|last=King|first=B.B.|title=Blues summit : classic blues, classic artists, classic duets|date=1993|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/178683365|publisher=MCA|oclc=178683365|access-date=2021-06-05}}</ref>

In August 1990, Cray played with Eric Clapton, [[Buddy Guy]], [[Jimmie Vaughan]], and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] at the [[Alpine Valley Music Theatre]] in [[East Troy (town), Wisconsin|East Troy, Wisconsin]], performing "[[Sweet Home Chicago]]". This was Stevie Ray Vaughan's final performance before [[Death of Stevie Ray Vaughan|he died in a helicopter accident later that night]].

Cray was invited to play at the "Guitar Legends" concerts in [[Seville]], Spain at the 1992 [[Seville Expo '92|Expo]], where he played a signature track, "Phone Booth".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> [[Albert Collins]] was also on the bill on this blues night of the "Legends" gigs.

===2000–present===
In 2005, Cray was inducted into [[Guitar Center#Hollywood's RockWalk|Hollywood's RockWalk]] at [[Guitar Center]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 7, 2005|title=RockWalk Honors BMI Blues Legends|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20050408rockwalk_rockwalk_honors_bmi_blues_legends|access-date=2020-11-17|website=BMI|language=en}}</ref>

Cray continues to record and tour. He appeared at the [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]], and supported Eric Clapton on his 2006-2007 world tour.
