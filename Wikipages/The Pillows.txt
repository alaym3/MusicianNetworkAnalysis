==History==

===Formation and early years (1989–1994)===
In 1989 [[Kenji Ueda]], bassist for Kenzi & The Trips, left the band with former Kenzi's drummer [[Shinichiro Sato]] and invited The Coin Locker Babies vocalist [[Sawao Yamanaka]] to form a new band. Since Yamanaka was not able to play the guitar well yet, [[Yoshiaki Manabe]], the guitarist of the hair metal band Persia, joined them. The Pillows were formed on September 16, 1989. The story as to where the band's name came about is that allegedly Sawao Yamanaka was hanging out at Yoshiaki Manabe's place and an English post-punk compilation record entitled ''[[Pillows & Prayers]]'' hanging on Manabe's wall inspired him.

Ueda and Yamanaka were the main songwriters and The Pillows released their first EPs, ''[[Pantomime (EP)|Pantomime]]'' and ''[[90's My Life]]'' in 1990 under Captain Records.

In 1991 they contracted with major label [[Pony Canyon]] and released their debut single, "Ame ni Utaeba" in May and their first full-length record ''[[Moon Gold]]'' in June.

In 1992 The Pillows visited England to record their second full-length album, ''[[White Incarnation]]'', and filmed the promotional video for their second single, "Kanojo wa Shisuta". Shortly after the release of ''White Incarnation'', Ueda left The Pillows due to disagreements with other members and musical differences.

After a year with no activity or leadership, Sawao Yamanaka took over Ueda's leadership role and recruited Tatsuya Kashima as a replacement on bass, restarting the band. Out of respect for Ueda, Kashima was labeled as a guest musician on releases on which he performed and Ueda's bassist post has never been officially replaced.<ref name="asianweek_storm"/> The extremely rare ''[[The Pillows Presents Special CD]]'', released only to The Pillows fanclub, contained their first recordings with Kashima.

In 1994 The Pillows changed to [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] and the band wildly experimented between varying genres. In July The Pillows released their first album as a trio, [[Kool Spice]], and one month later the single "[[Daydream Wonder]]" was released.

===Breakthrough and ''FLCL'' (1995–2000)===
[[File:Sawao Yamanaka - Delicious Bump Tour in USA 08.jpg|thumb|upright|Yamanaka performing in Seattle during the Delicious Bump Tour, 2008.]]
In March 1995 The Pillows released their fourth album, ''[[Living Field]]''. Their subsequent single, "[[Girlfriend (The Pillows song)|Girlfriend]]", was used in the romance movie ''[[Love Letter (1995 film)|Love Letter]]''.

In the following year, after the release of their fifth single "Tiny Boat", The Pillows would release a series of singles such as "[[Strange Chameleon]]", "[[Swanky Street]]", and "Trip Dancer" that were featured on their breakthrough and acclaimed album ''[[Please Mr. Lostman]]''.

In March of the same year, due to the success of ''Please Mr. Lostman'' The Pillows released one of the album's tracks, "[[Kanojo wa Kyou]]" as a single. Later that year, two new singles were released, "[[One Life (The Pillows song)|One Life]]" in June and "[[Hybrid Rainbow]]" in November, which became one of The Pillows' most recognizable songs, being largely featured on concert set lists.

In January 1998, The Pillows released their twelfth single "[[Another Morning (The Pillows song)|Another Morning]]" and their first concert DVD "[[Hello, Welcome to Bubbletown's Happy Zoo]]". The last three singles were featured on their sixth album ''[[Little Busters]]'', which came out in February and became one of their most well known and commercial records. Two more singles followed, "Instant Music" and "[[No Self Control (The Pillows song)|No Self Control]]" would both be used on their 1999 album ''[[Runners High]]''.

The year of 1999 started with the release of ''Runners High'' and to celebrate their 10th anniversary, The Pillows released their first video clips compilation DVD, "[[We Have a Theme Song]]", followed by two new singles ("[[Carnival (The Pillows song)|Carnival]]" and "[[Rush (The Pillows song)|Rush]]"), both featured on the second studio album release of that year, ''[[Happy Bivouac]]''. This record pays tribute to the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] in songs such as "Back Seat Dog" and "Kim Deal" and it is the first album to feature support bassist Jun Suzuki as a replacement for Kashima.

In the same year, The Pillows were approached by the [[anime]] studio [[Gainax]], which licensed The Pillows' three previous albums for the soundtrack of the [[original video animation]] ''[[FLCL]]''. The Pillows also composed two new songs for the show, "Ride on Shooting Star" and "I Think I Can", which were later included on their greatest hits compilation album ''[[Fool on the Planet]]''.<ref name="asianweek_storm" />

Due to their participation in ''FLCL'''s soundtrack, The Pillows enjoyed a popularity increase, making their western fan base grow. This allowed them to release their "Ride on Shooting Star" single in the [[United States]] in 2000 and later tour that country.

===Early 2000s, 15th anniversary and US debut (2001–2006)===
[[File:The Pillows Shibuya Club Quattro 2003.jpg|thumb|The Pillows performing at [[Shibuya]] Club Quattro in 2003.]]
After their participation on FLCL's soundtrack, The Pillows released their first greatest-hits compilation album ''[[Fool on the Planet]]'' in 2001 and also a live DVD called ''[[Busters on the Planet]]'' and a new album, ''[[Smile (The Pillows album)|Smile]]''.

In 2002, the FLCL anime became available in the United States, giving the band more notoriety outside of their native country. In October of the same year ''[[Thank You, My Twilight]]'', The Pillows' tenth studio album, was released alongside a double-CD collection of B-sides entitled ''[[Another Morning, Another Pillows]]'', following the promotional single "[[White Summer and Green Bicycle, Red Hair with Black Guitar]]".

In 2003, The Pillows released their second video clips DVD ''[[Dead Stock Paradise]]'', one single, "Terminal Heaven's Rock" and one more studio album, ''[[Penalty Life]]'', which was later released in the US by Geneon in 2005.

To commemorate the band's 15th anniversary, The Pillows re-released their ''[[90's My Life]]'' EP with additional tracks and released a string of new material, including a new EP with re-recorded tracks previously published between 1990 and 1996, ''[[Turn Back (The Pillows album)|Turn Back]]'', one document DVD, ''Walkin' on The Spiral'', one new studio album, ''[[Good Dreams]]'', a new single, "[[Sono Mirai wa Ima]]"  and finally a tribute album, ''[[Synchronized Rockers]]'', including covers of The Pillows played by artists such as [[Mr. Children]], [[Straightener (band)|Straightener]] and [[Noodles (band)|Noodles]].

[[File:The Pillows J!-ENT Live 2005.jpg|thumb|The Pillows in 2005. From left to right: Manabe, Sato, Yamanaka.]]
In January 2005 The Pillows released the live DVD ''916'' which features footage of their 15th anniversary concert of 2004.

In March 2005, The Pillows played their first show in the United States at [[South by Southwest]] in [[Austin, Texas]],<ref name="sxsw_2005_pillows">

Still in 2008, legendary English rock band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] extended an offer for The Pillows to play as the opening act at their concert in Japan, but frontman Sawao Yamanaka refused their offer.

In 2009, in order to celebrate their upcoming 20th anniversary, The Pillows issued a series of releases called "Late Bloomer Series". It includes two DVDs: ''Pied Piper Go to Yesterday'' and ''Blue Song With Blue Poppies'', two best-of compilation albums, ''[[Rock Stock & Too Smoking the Pillows]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in the Pillows]]'', a single "[[Ameagari ni mita Maboroshi]]" (featured on their 16th studio album ''[[OOPArts (album)|OOPArts (Out of Place Artifacts)]]'') and later the DVD of their anniversary concert, ''[[Lostman Go to Budokan]]'', released in the following year.

On September 16, The Pillows gave their first concert in the legendary [[Nippon Budokan]] arena commemorating their 20th anniversary. The footage of the concert was later released in 2010 as their ninth live DVD, ''Lostman Go to Budokan'', which came out in both regular and limited edition formats. The limited edition included the concert, a documentary DVD and a special 60-page photo album of the band.

In 2010, The Pillows recorded Rodeo Star Mate, their 30th single and opening theme song for the series, ''[[Stitch!|Stitch - Itazura Alien no Daibouken]]''.

In June, The Pillows released their 10th live DVD, "Parts of OOParts" including footage of their 2010 OOParts tour. Then in December, the single, "[[Movement (The Pillows song)|Movement]]", was released.

In January 2011 The Pillows released their 17th studio album ''[[Horn Again]]'' with previously released singles included. In February The Pillows released their first single of the year, "[[Tabasco Disco]]", which was only available for purchase to concert audiences.

In June of the same year, The Pillows recorded "Comic Sonic" as the ending theme for the anime adaptation of the [[manga]] "[[Sket Dance]]".

In September The Pillows and fellow band Noodles toured America for the second time together in the NAP Tour. They performed in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Austin, Texas.

In October they released a live DVD, Born Again, containing footage of their 2011 Horn Again Tour, and in December they released the single, "[[Energia]]".

On January 18, 2012 The Pillows released their album, ''[[Trial (The Pillows album)|Trial]]'' and, on the same day, a live DVD entitled ''We Are Friends'', which included footage of their 2011 NAP Tour in America with Noodles. In June, following their Trial tour, the band released the DVD ''Real Trial'' containing the last live performance of the tour at Zepp Tokyo.

In a similar fashion to the "Late Bloomer Series" celebrating the band's 20th anniversary, The Pillows issued a string of releases over 2013 and 2014 in honor of their 25th anniversary. Entitled "Never Ending Story", this series of releases comprised a new tribute album, DVDs and Blu-ray's (including a nine disc Blu-ray box set), three new singles ("Future", "Happy Birthday" and "About a Rock'n'Roll Band") and finally, The Pillows' 19th studio album ''[[Moondust (album)|Moondust]]''. The band also performed three shows in 2014 representing each era ("movement") of their sound: their period with original bassist Kenji Ueda, their experimentation with jazz as heard on the ''[[Kool Spice]]'' and ''[[Living Field]]'' albums, and their current style from ''[[Please Mr. Lostman]]'' onward. These shows saw the band playing old songs for the first time in decades, with Ueda being invited to play bass at a single show where The Pillows performed songs from his time with the band. On October 4, 2014 the band concluded the "Never Ending Story" campaign with the "Don't Forget Today" show at [[Tokyo Dome City Hall]] and, on the same date, released ''Bootleg the Pillows 1992-1993'', a compilation featuring various previously unreleased recordings. Around this time, The Pillows also began issuing merchandise that featured the slogan "4th Movement is coming",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pillows.jp/p/information/goods-info|title=GOODS « the pillows official web site|website=pillows.jp|access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref> potentially signalling a new "era" for the band.

===FLCL new seasons and 30th Anniversary (2015–present)===
Following the end of the "Never Ending Story" campaign, The Pillows began the ''Moondust Light for You'' tour at the beginning of 2015 in support of the ''Moondust'' album. In May 2015, the band announced that longtime bassist Jun Suzuki had been fired from the band due to "bad conduct" that had been going on for some time. In this announcement, Yamanaka also discussed the possibility of continuing on without a "fixed" bass player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://natalie.mu/music/news/147795|title=the pillowsのサポートベーシスト鈴木淳がバンド離脱 - 音楽ナタリー|first=Natasha|last=Inc.|website=natalie.mu|access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref> In place of Suzuki, who went on to form the band SABAH,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/sabahjapan2016/|title=Security Check Required|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref> The Pillows played with various different bassists for their remaining 2015 live shows.

The pillows released their 22nd studio album, ''Rebroadcast'', under King Records and Delicious label on September 19, 2018. The limited edition includes a DVD with footage from the "Mono Me You Sun Tour" in USA.

In March 2019, The pillows announced their participation on the tribute album for UNISON SQUARE GARDEN's 15th anniversary as a band, covering the song “Shoegazer Speaker”. It was released on July 24.

In May 2019, it was announced that The pillows’ new song “Happy Go Ducky!” will be used as the opening theme for the anime series [[Ahiru no Sora]] premiering in October.

To celebrate the band's 30th anniversary, a feature film entitled Ousama ni Nare ("Become the King") with music and original story by Sawao Yamanaka was released in Japan in the Fall season of 2019. Shûji Okui is responsible for the script and direction. The film stars actor Amane Okayama as Yuusuke, a young man who works in a ramen shop frequented by numerous Japanese rock bands. Yuusuke dreams of being a photographer, and he decides to follow his dreams by becoming a cameraman for live concert events. Ousama ni Nare also features appearances by numerous musicians, including: Teru and Jiro of [[GLAY]]; Atsushi Horie, Hidekazu Hinata and Shinpei Nakayama of  [[Straightener (band)|Straightener]]; Hirotaka Takahashi of [[The Predators (Japanese band)|The Predators]]; Ryosuke Sasaki, Tomoya Tabuchi, Hiroaki Arai and Hiroyuki Suzuki of THE KEBABS; Yoko and Shinya Kusube of Casablanca; Hirata Panda, Beat Ryo, Hoshikawa Don't Let Me Down, Honma Domino and Chiba O'Reilly of THE BOHEMIANS; Eiichi Miyamoto of syurispeiloff; [[Ena Fujita]], Asako Miyazaki, Aya Matsuoka and Misaki Yoshikawa of [[SHISHAMO]].<ref>{{cite web |title=J-Rock Band The Pillows Celebrates 30 Years with Feature Film Drama|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/pt-br/anime-news/2019/04/30-1/j-rock-band-the-pillows-celebrates-30-years-with-feature-film-drama}}</ref>

To celebrate 30 years of the pillows' existence, the band also held their own temporary museum. Titled "the pillows museum: Buster's Diner" the event took the form of a vintage american diner filled with memorabilia related to the band. The shop also sold FLCL themed collaboration goods. The museum ran from August 30, 2019, to September 8, 2019, at Shibuya Tower Records, followed by a run from September 13–22, 2019 in Osaka.<ref>{{cite web |title=Celebrate the Music of FLCL with an Exhibition by the pillows|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/pt-br/anime-news/2019/08/06-1/celebrate-the-music-of-flcl-with-an-exhibition-by-the-pillows}}</ref>

[[File:Buster-kun.jpg|upright=0.5|thumb|Buster-kun]]
Buster-[[Japanese honorifics#Kun|kun]] has been The Pillows' mascot since about 1998, when on a visit to [[London]], the band saw a doll of a "grotesque and creepy-looking teddy bear" in a shop window. Since then it has been constantly used in promotional videos, album artwork and goods such as T-shirts and bracelets. Buster-kun was named after the ''Little Busters'' album and the group also uses the term "little busters" for its fans.
The original doll can be seen in the promotional video for the song "[[Hybrid Rainbow]]" and on the DVD video and artwork cover of the ''[[Hello, Welcome to Bubbletown's Happy Zoo|Hello, Welcome to Bubbletown's Happy Zoo (Instant Show)]]'' DVD.

In an interview, Sawao commented on the reason why they adopted Buster-kun and what it represents to the band's music: 
"The original doll was made out of really dirty old leather and had a real-looking eye and tongue, but one of the eyes was a button and it was displayed in a window, shaking like it was being electrocuted.
We still don't know what it was and why it was there, because it wasn't in a store display window and it didn't look like it was for commercial purposes, but it just seemed like someone's idea of a prank or some artist's work that we thought was interesting. So we used it in our jacket booklet and while we were on tour, we thought of placing that bear image on T-shirts, so we sent the picture to a designer to arrange it. At first it looks cute, but once you get up close, it has sharp teeth like it's ready to bite any minute. So that kind-of-cute but kind-of-scary look fits right in with The Pillows music perfectly.".<ref name="ann_interview_buster">
