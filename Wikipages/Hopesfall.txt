==History==

===''The Frailty of Words'' and ''No Wings to Speak Of EP'' (1998–2001)===
Hopesfall (stylized as ''.hopesfall.'') began as a [[Christian hardcore]] band in 1998.<ref name="Christian hardcore">{{cite web|url= http://lambgoat.com/albums/2412/Hopesfall-Magnetic-North|title=Hopesfall - ''Magnetic North''|publisher=Lambgoat|author=Cory|date=June 8, 2007|access-date=March 5, 2016}}</ref> They recorded their first album, ''[[The Frailty of Words]]'', that same year,<ref name="ryan_parrish">{{cite web|url=http://darksatellite.tumblr.com/post/19236153853/we-wrote-the-songs-that-would-become-the-frailty|title=Dark Satellite|first=Ryan|last=Parrish|date=March 13, 2012|access-date=June 11, 2012}}</ref> and it was released in November 1999 on Christian hardcore/punk label DTS Records.  Following the release of ''The Frailty of Words'', founding bassist Christopher Kincaid left the band, to be replaced by Pat Aldrich.  In 2001, the band released the EP, ''[[No Wings to Speak Of]]'' on Takehold Records. Ryan Parrish was at the helm of songwriting during time, creating what would become known as the signature ''.hopesfall.'' sound in the [[melodic hardcore]] genre.

===''The Satellite Years'' and exit of Ryan Parrish (2002–2004)===
2002's ''[[The Satellite Years]]'' saw the band signed to [[Trustkill Records]]<ref name="trustkill">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/2765|title=Hopesfall Signs to Trustkill|date=February 11, 2002|access-date=June 11, 2012|publisher=Punknews}}</ref> for a 3-album deal. This marked the departure of founding vocalist Doug Venable, and bassist Pat Aldrich.<ref name="aldrichdeparture">{{cite web|url=http://www.hopesfall.com |title=.hopesfall. |first=Ryan |last=Parrish |date=January 14, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020119172221/http://hopesfall.com/ |archive-date=January 19, 2002 |url-status=dead |quote=as some of you already know, our bassist pat aldrich left the band a few months ago.&nbsp;... }}</ref>  Jay Forrest replaced Venable on vocals.

This resulted in contention with the rest of the band who sided with the label, forgoing the previous vision of ''.hopesfall.'' The exit of Ryan Parrish would mark the end of the band's trademark melodic hardcore sound, Christian message, as Ryan was the primary songwriter and spokesperson along with Venable, the two were regarded as the Christians in the band.<ref name="asthestorygrows.com"/> The Satellite Years was released post Parrish's exit, despite him having been the primary songwriter for album<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/1458/Lineup-changes-continue-for-Hopesfall|title=Lineup changes continue for Hopesfall|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref><ref name="asthestorygrows.com"/><ref>{{cite web|first=Zach|last=Baird|title=HM Magazine|issue=99|p=18–19|publisher=[[HM Magazine]]|date=February 2003|access-date=March 10, 2016|url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/downloads/HMissue99.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030423205517/http://www.hmmagazine.com/downloads/HMissue99.pdf |archive-date=April 23, 2003}}</ref> [[The Satellite Years]] was recorded at Great Western Record Recorders studio by Matt Talbott from [[Hum (band)|HUM]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hopesfall - An Interview - openingbands.com|url = http://www.openingbands.com/printerfriendly.race?ID=329|website = www.openingbands.com|access-date = 2015-10-20}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Hum Frontman Matt Talbott’s Great Western Recording Studio|url = http://innocentwords.com/at-the-great-western-crossing-matt-talbotts-recording-studio/|website = Innocent Words|access-date = 2015-10-20|language = en|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160502141740/http://innocentwords.com/at-the-great-western-crossing-matt-talbotts-recording-studio/|archive-date = 2016-05-02|url-status = dead}}</ref> The band confirmed via a Facebook story that Chad Waldrup beat Matt Talbott in the [[Nintendo 64]] game "[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye]]" which resulted in Talbott having to make good on a bet to sing vocals on, "Escape Pods for Intangibles."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/hum/comments/cumcp5/small_fun_piece_of_lore/|title=r/hum - Small, fun piece of lore|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref>

Ryan Parrish went on to join Nashville [[indie rock]] band Celebrity,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ryanedwardparrish.com/celebrity/|title=Celebrity — Ryan Parrish|website=Ryan Parrish|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref> and is currently the lead guitarist in shoegaze band In Parallel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ryanedwardparrish.com/inparallel/|title=In Parallel — Ryan Parrish|website=Ryan Parrish|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ryanedwardparrish.com/|title=Ryan Parrish|website=Ryan Parrish|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref>

Mike Tyson played bass for the band on the ''Satellite Years'' tour, later joining the band as a permanent member.  Chad Waldrup departed the band shortly after taking over live guitar duties, and was replaced by Dustin Nadler.

===''A Types'' (2004–2007)===
The band followed ''The Satellite Years'' with 2004's ''[[A Types]]'', which had a more [[alternative rock]] sound and was a drastic stylistic departure from ''The Satellite Years'' – notably, Forrest's vocals were almost exclusively clean singing.  By the time of ''A Types''' release, Joshua Brigham was the only remaining founding member of Hopesfall, and along with Jay Forrest, the only other remaining member from the lineup that appeared on ''The Satellite Years'', with drummer Adam Morgan having departed weeks before recording.  Morgan was replaced by Adam Baker, who departed the band during the ''A Types'' tour to be replaced by Morgan again.  Morgan left the band for good prior to the recording of the band's next album, ''[[Magnetic North (Hopesfall album)|Magnetic North]]'', and was replaced by Jason Trabue.

===''Magnetic North'' and breakup (2007–2008)===
''Magnetic North'' was released on May 15, 2007.  The album saw the band strike a balance between the contrasting styles found on ''The Satellite Years'' and ''A Types''.  They toured little in support of ''Magnetic North'', and in July of that year they announced further lineup changes,<ref name="magnorth_lineup">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/24768|title=Hopesfall undergo lineup changes|date=July 24, 2007|access-date=June 11, 2012|publisher=Punknews}}</ref> with Joshua Brigham, Mike Tyson, Dustin Nadler, and Jason Trabue all leaving the band.  Cory Seals, Robert DeLauro, Paul Cadena, and Joey Manzione filled the vacancies, and, along with Jay Forrest, continued the US leg of the ''Magnetic North'' tour.

In September 2007, the band announced plans to change their name, thus ending the Hopesfall era; however, these plans never came to fruition. In January 2009, rumors circulated of Forrest's intentions to record vocals for several unfinished Hopesfall songs,<ref name="recording">{{cite web|url=http://killyourstereo.com/news/967225/hopesfall-to-release-new-songs|title=Hopesfall to release new songs|date=January 19, 2009|access-date=September 2, 2014|publisher=[[Killyourstereo]]}}</ref> though no further updates were reported.  Following the ''Magnetic North'' tour, the replacement members left the band, and in January 2008, Hopesfall finally announced their breakup.<ref name="breakup">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/27137|title=Hopesfall (1998-2007)|date=January 3, 2008|access-date=June 11, 2012|publisher=Punknews}}</ref>

The band reunited in 2016 and signed to [[Equal Vision Records]], who re-issued their last 3 albums on vinyl.<ref name="IVM">{{cite web|url=http://www.indievisionmusic.com/news/hopesfall-sign-to-equal-vision-reissue-last-3-albums-to-vinyl/|title=Hopesfall Sign to Equal Vision, Reissue Last 3 Albums to Vinyl|publisher=Indie Vision Music|first=Brandon|last=Jones|date=November 14, 2016|access-date=November 15, 2016}}</ref> The band announced their intent to release a new album in 2017.<ref name="IVM"/> The lineup for this new album comprises long-serving vocalist Jay Forrest, founding guitarist Josh Brigham and ''A-Types'' and ''Magnetic North'' guitarist Dustin Nadler, ''Satellite Years'' bassist Chad Waldrup, and founding drummer Adam Morgan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/hopesfall_reunite_for_new_album_label_vinyl_releases|title=Hopesfall reunite for new album, label, vinyl releases - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|access-date=2016-11-15}}</ref> Hopesfall released "H.A.

On February 24, 2020, the band released a new song titled "Hall of the Sky" that was available on streaming services the following day. In addition to the band's atmospheric post-hardcore sound, the song also features elements of [[progressive rock]] and [[post-rock]].<ref name="Hall of the Sky">{{cite web|publisher=Brooklyn Vegan|last=Sacher|first=Andrew|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/hopesfall-return-with-new-nine-minute-single-hall-of-the-sky-watch-the-video/|title=Hopesfall return with new nine minute single "Hall of the Sky"|date=February 24, 2020|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> The song is the first Hopesfall recording with Parrish since 2002's ''The Satellite Years''.

In March 2020, the band had planned to embark on a tour across Japan with Taken. The tour was supposed to begin on March 25 in [[Tokyo]], but it was later announced that the tour would be postponed due to concerns over the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=AntiMusic|url=https://www.antimusic.com/news/20/March/11Hopesfall_Postpone_Tour_Due_To_Coronavirus.shtml|title=Hopesfall Postpone Tour Due To Coronavirus|date=March 11, 2020|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref>
