'''Groove Armada''' are an English [[electronic music duo]], composed of [[Andy Cato]] and Tom Findlay.<ref>{{cite web|title=Groove Armada Bio, Music, News & Shows|url=http://djz.com/featured_djs/groove-armada/|publisher=DJZ.com|access-date=7 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329065147/http://djz.com/featured_djs/groove-armada/|archive-date=29 March 2013}}</ref> They achieved chart success with their singles "[[I See You Baby]]" and "[[Superstylin']]". The group has released eight studio albums, four of which have charted in the [[UK Albums Chart]] top 50.

== History ==
Groove Armada first formed after Cato and Findlay had been introduced by a mutual friend and soon started their own club night in London, called Captain Sensual at the Helm of the Groove Armada,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/20/groove-armada-how-we-made-at-the-river-tom-findlay-andy-cato |title=Groove Armada: how we made at the River |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=20 November 2018 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref> after a 1970s discothèque.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

By 1997 they had released a few singles, including "4 Tune Cookie" and the song that first brought them minor fame, "[[At the River]]", which sampled "[[Old Cape Cod]]" by [[Patti Page]] (used in the film ''[[Die Hard 2]]''). The song went on to be one of Groove Armada's best-known tracks and has been found on numerous [[chillout music|chill out]] compilations.

Their first album, ''[[Northern Star (Groove Armada album)|Northern Star]]'', was released in 1998 on [[Tummy Touch Records]], and was followed by a second, ''[[Vertigo (Groove Armada album)|Vertigo]]'', in 1999, which had a more mainstream and 'polished' sound, thus making the UK Album Chart's upper 20 and being certified silver in the UK.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} It also included "At the River" which was re-released as a full-fledged single. An album of remixed tracks from ''Vertigo'' entitled ''The Remixes'' followed in 2000, along with their contribution to the ''[[Back to Mine]]'' [[mix album]] series.

The next studio album ''[[Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)]]'' was released in 2001 and, as its title suggests, marked a departure from their trip-hop roots to more upbeat music – as demonstrated on the [[Grammy]]-nominated single "[[Superstylin']]". Another mix album followed, this time for the ''[[Another Late Night]]'' series, and in 2002, less than a year after ''Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)'', Groove Armada produced ''[[Lovebox (Groove Armada album)|Lovebox]]'', which included a variety of genres including [[Rock music|rock]], such as "Madder" and "[[Purple Haze (Groove Armada song)|Purple Haze]]",{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} while others were closer to the band's traditional [[house music|house]] & [[trip hop]] roots,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} such as the title track "Lovebox", and "Remember", with the latter containing vocals made up entirely of samples of [[Sandy Denny]]'s vocals for [[Fairport Convention]]. An additional bonus track was later released on their website entitled "Fairport".{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Lovebox also contained a song called "Hands of Time" which was subsequently used in the movie [[Collateral (film)|Collateral]], Starring Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Mark Ruffalo in 2004.

The song "Madder" was used in the 2003 video game ''[[Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc]]''. The song "Purple Haze" was used in the 2004 movie ''[[The Girl Next Door (2004 film)|The Girl Next Door]]''.

A [[greatest hits album]], entitled ''[[The Best of Groove Armada]]'', released in 2004 – the last of their releases with Pepper Records – before their studio album ''[[Soundboy Rock]]'' was released in 2007. The album marked a notable departure from the multi-genre-influenced previous album, featuring tracks such as "Get Down" and "Groove Extracts", which followed the contemporary [[house music]] trend, tracks with [[rock music|rock]] elements, and "Song 4 Mutya (Out of Control)" featuring the vocals of ex-[[Sugababes]] singer [[Mutya Buena]], hailed by online music guide [[Popjustice]] as one of the best songs of 2007.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Following the successful ''Soundboy Rock'' singles, an updated best-of set titled ''Greatest Hits'' was released in October 2007. This was accompanied by ''GA10: 10 Year Story'', a 2CD rarities collection released in November 2007 to celebrate their tenth anniversary as a band. The band has spoken in-depth about the compilation, and cited it as an "emotional experience", with both members selecting their personal favourite songs and mixes from their history.<ref>[http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms:/out/music/video_interviews/groove_armada_10_year_interview ''Groove Armada: 10 Year Story'' video interview] with [[stv.tv]]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131235020/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms%3A%2Fout%2Fmusic%2Fvideo_interviews%2Fgroove_armada_10_year_interview |date=31 January 2009 }}</ref>

Groove Armada also released a collaboration{{which|date=September 2011}} with [[The Japanese Popstars]] through [[Strictly Rhythm]], via [[Beatport]], in April 2008.

In the same year, Groove Armada engaged in a deal with [[Bacardi]] to distribute their new 4-track [[Extended play|EP]] using a [[file sharing]] platform called B-Live Share.

During 2009, Findlay and Cato repeatedly confirmed the existence of a pending new album. While on the Bacardi Express tour in Australia, Findlay said it will be called ''Black Light'' and "is going to be the darker side of Groove Armada, which is finally coming out after 12 years."<ref name="Groove Armada - Music Feeds">{{cite web |url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/features/groove-armada/ |title=Groove Armada |author=Buck Johnson |work=Music Feeds |access-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> The first single, released on 23 November 2009, was "I Won't Kneel", featuring Groove Armada's new vocalist, [[Saint Saviour (musician)|Saint Saviour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=17792 |title=I Won't Kneel by Groove Armada |work=Songfacts |access-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> The album's second single, "Paper Romance", was released on 22 February 2010, and the album was released in Europe on 28 February.

In October 2010, Groove Armada released a remix album, ''[[White Light (Groove Armada album)|White Light]]'', which contained recent studio re-recordings<ref>{{cite web|title=Groove Armada Announce Release of New Album "White Light"|url=http://www.queeried.co.uk/groove-armada-announce-release-of-new-album-white-light/|publisher=Queeried.co.uk|access-date=15 August 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330182720/http://www.queeried.co.uk/groove-armada-announce-release-of-new-album-white-light/|archive-date=30 March 2012}}</ref> of alternative live versions of many songs from ''Black Light'' as well as other classic Groove Armada songs. Andy Cato stated on the official Groove Armada blog that "Ideas were flowing. Go, Not Forgotten, Look Me in the Eye Sister, Superstylin got even larger."{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Groove Armada headlined Uber Cool festival at [[Jersey Live]] on 3 September. The duo embarked on a series of secretive "living room" sets, performing intimately across the country for audiences of close friends. Little information was given about these private performances, but the tour kicked off in [[Brighton]] in late January, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Groove Armada on dance music's new live age|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/04/groove-armada-friendly-fires|last=Hann|first=Michael|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2010-03-04|access-date=14 April 2014}}</ref>

In 2015, Groove Armada released their eighth studio album, ''Little Black Book''. The album has been described as "somewhere between [an] album, mix CD, and compilation".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=29527|title=Groove Armada next up on Little Black Book series|website=Resident Advisor|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> The first disc features their own original music and remixes, while the second disc features remixes of their music by other artists.
