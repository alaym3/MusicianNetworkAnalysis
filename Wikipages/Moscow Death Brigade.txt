'''Moscow Death Brigade''' (short MDB, Russian: ''Московская Бригада Смерти (МДБ)'') is a band from [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] that plays a mix of [[hip-hop]], [[punk rock]] and [[electronic music]]. The band's music and masked appearance emphasize its stance against [[racism]], [[sexism]] and [[homophobia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rebel-sound.com/moscow-death-birgade|title=Moscow Death Birgade|website=rebel-sound-records|language=en|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> The band does not consider itself a political band and claims that their views are just "human".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.magazine.awayfromlife.com/no-prejudice-just-being-human-with-moscow-death-brigade-hc-punk-attitude-2/|title='No Prejudice – Just Being Human' with MOSCOW DEATH BRIGADE (HC-Punk-Attitude #2)|date=2019-02-25|website=Away From Life|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref>

==History==
The band was founded in 2007 under the name '''Hoods Up 495'''. The members come from the [[hardcore punk]] scene and have worked with among others, the [[streetpunk]] band Razor Bois and the crossover band Siberian Meat Grinder. Common to all members is a fondness for the hip-hop of the 1980s / 1990s like the [[Beastie Boys]], [[Cypress Hill]], or the [[Transplants (band)|Transplants]] and an [[anti-fascist]] attitude. After renaming they changed to their current style to connect aggressive [[Rapping|rap]] with guitar-heavy hardcore beats, followed a year later by releasing a second self-titled demo tape with three songs.

In 2014 the group released their first [[Extended play|EP]] called ''Hoods Up'', a reference to the former band name, on the German label [[Fire and Flames Music]]. The EP attracted the attention of Europe's punk scene and ensured that the band became known outside Russia's borders.

After extensive tours through Eastern and Central Europe, including among others with [[Feine Sahne Fischfilet]], a split EP with the fellow Russian [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] hardcore band What We Feel called ''Here to Stay'' was released, followed by another split release on [[Audiolith Records]] with the bands Feine Sahne Fischfilet, [[Los Fastidios]] and What We Feel. The latter was a benefit EP whose proceeds benefited the families of murdered Russian antifascists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audiolith.net/de/2015/10/united-worldwide-benefit-splitsingle/|title=United World Wide Benefit Splitsingle|author=Audiolith Records|author-link=Audiolith Records|date=August 23, 2017|language=de}}</ref>

On February 15, 2015, an article on [[Indymedia]] in the run-up to a performance in [[Berlin]] claimed that the anti-fascist attitudes of the band were only lip service for marketing. The article instead stated that the band was sexist, homophobic, [[chauvinism|chauvinistic]], and advocated for strong [[Russian nationalism]]. Four days later the band published a statement strongly rejecting the allegations. They expressed themselves, together with the band What We Feel that was also named in the article, that they are "anti-fascists against nationalists and racists of all stripes".<ref name="Ox">{{cite magazine|title=MOSCOW DEATH BRIGADE: Freundschaft, Unity, Respekt|author=Henning v.

In May 2017, the band released the single ''Brother & Sisterhood'' and announced both a new album and the continuation of their European tour in the fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awayfromlife.com/moscow-death-brigade-brother-sisterhood/|title=MOSCOW DEATH BRIGADE – neues Musikvideo 'Brother & Sisterhood'|work=Away from Life|date=May 11, 2017|language=de}}</ref>

In February 2018, Moscow Death Brigade released their first full-length album ''Boltcutter'' on Fire and Flames Music. Expanding their musical style further the band produced an entirely electronic record combining styles like [[Drum and bass|Drum’n’Bass]], [[Electronic dance music|EDM]], [[Hardstyle]], [[Dub music|Dub]] and more. The two MC's and DJ continued rapping on every track with lyrics about unity, touring, [[graffiti]], street activism and struggle against discrimination. Following the release of ''Boltcutter'' the band embarked on a two-part Euro tour playing more than 40 headlining shows across the continent and in the UK, as well as appearing at various [[Do it yourself|DIY]] and commercial festivals like [[Boomtown (festival)|Boomtown]] (UK) and [[With Full Force]] (Germany). The band also opened several shows for Feine Sahne Fischfillet in this year.

In 2019 Moscow Death Brigade was signed to German booking agency Destiny Tourbooking and went to play another Euro tour, returning to Boomtown, playing at Xtreme Fest (France) and opening for [[Madball]] in Spain.

On April 10, 2020 the album ''Bad Accent Anthems'' was released. With it the band continued experimenting with electronic sounds, but also returned to more punk rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] inspired beats, as well as implemented electric guitars in some of the rave songs.

The album release tour for ''Bad Accent Anthems'' was to be the biggest tour for MDB yet, with more than 70 shows and festivals planned for Europe, UK and the band's first tour in the US. The band was supposed to perform at famous music festivals such as [[Punkrock Bowling]] (Las Vegas), [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] (Denmark) and [[Exit (festival)|Exit fest]] (Serbia). However, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] the entire tour and all the festivals were cancelled with most of the shows moving to 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rozendaal|first=Robert|title=IN DEPTH: MOSCOW DEATH BRIGADE – BAD ACCENT ANTHEMS {{!}} DISCOVERED MAGAZINE|url=https://www.discoveredmagazine.com/2020/04/in-depth-moscow-death-brigade-bad-accent-anthems/|access-date=2020-11-19|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Imagery==
The group appears masked with balaclavas. The identities of the two rappers and the DJ are still kept secret.<ref name="Plastic">{{Cite web |url=http://plastic-bomb.eu/index.php/artikelkolumnen/interviews/4866-moscow-death-brigade-im-interview |title=Moscow Death Brigade im Interview |access-date=February 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502111912/http://plastic-bomb.eu/index.php/artikelkolumnen/interviews/4866-moscow-death-brigade-im-interview |archive-date=May 2, 2017 |url-status=dead |work=[[Plastic Bomb]] |date=April 23, 2014}}</ref> The band members explain the choice of balaclavas the following way: “Our masks represent our roots and background, where we are coming from and what inspired our band’s views and philosophy. These things include graffiti underground scene and DIY progressive social movements. Usually in those circles people would avoid having their faces posted all over the internet for many reasons. We also have always loved the idea of masked artists – from [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] to MF Doom. Wearing a mask allows us to become one with our music and adds an element of mystery to the legend of the band.”<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cundle|first=Tim|date=2018-01-26|title=Moscow Death Brigade|url=http://massmovement.co.uk/moscow-death-brigade/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=Mass Movement|language=en-GB}}</ref>

The band itself refers to their music as "Circle Pit hip-hop" or "[[hardcore hip-hop]]". In their music videos, the group often shows themselves spraying graffiti on trains or houses. The Russian and English lyrics deal with anti-fascism and are socio-critical. Topics include "police brutality, violence, mass media propaganda, social prejudice and conscription".<ref name="Plastic" /> The band sees itself as a collective to artist friends, including sprayer, concert organizers and political activists.<ref name="Ox" /><ref name="Plastic" />

== Charity Work ==
Moscow Death Brigade is known for their non-profit activity. In 2015 the band took part in a benefit compilation with the bands Feine Sahne Fischfilet, Los Fastidios and What We Feel, whose proceeds benefited the families of murdered Russian antifascists.<ref>{{Cite web|title=V/A – United Worldwide! EP › Fire and Flames Music and Clothing|url=https://www.fireandflames.com/en/product/va-united-worldwide-ep-2/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=www.fireandflames.com}}</ref>

Throughout 2018-2020 the band worked with [[Sisters foundation]], a Russian independent non-profit organization that helps victims of domestic and [[sexual violence]]. The band raised more than €4000 through their campaign ''No Means No'', selling T-shirts depicting a crocodile biting off a hand (presumably of an abuser).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Moscow Death Brigade "No Means No" T-Shirt › Fire and Flames Music and Clothing|url=https://www.fireandflames.com/en/product/moscow-death-brigade-no-means-no-t-shirt/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=www.fireandflames.com}}</ref>

In 2019 Moscow Death Brigade teamed up with True Rebel Store (Germany/Switzerland) for a campaign called “All for One”, raising funds for the German non-profit organization “Women in Exile” that helps [[refugee]] women suffering from abuse and discrimination.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2020|title=True Rebel Store|url=https://true-rebel.ch/Moscow-Death-Brigade-True-Rebel-Ladies-Shirt-All-For-One-Black|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=www.true-rebel.ch}}</ref>

After releasing ''Bad Accent Anthems'' the band doubled down on charity work, taking part in numerous non-profit campaigns throughout 2020. In May 2020 the band released a new track ''Put Your Mask On'' - recorded and produced in COVID-19 quarantine - with all profits going to a Russian organization helping elderly in need.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-17|title=Moscow Death Brigade release benefit song ‘Put Your Mask On’|url=https://rocknloadmag.com/news/moscow-death-brigade-release-benefit-song-put-your-mask-on/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=R   o   c   k    'N'    L   o   a  d|language=en-GB}}</ref> The band teamed up with True Rebel once again to sell protective face masks and according to True Rebel website and the band's social media accounts all profits were going to a Russian non-profit organization [[Enjoyable Ageing Foundation]] that helps disabled and elderly people; and for each mask sold one was given out to [[Homelessness|homeless]] in Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2020|title=True Rebel Store|url=https://true-rebel-store.com/Moscow-Death-Brigade-True-Rebel-Face-Mask-Black|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=www.true-rebel.de}}</ref>

MDB also appeared on Destiny Tourbooking's limited edition T-shirt “I was not there tour 2020” alongside bands like [[NOFX]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] and [[Bad Religion]]. According to Destiny Tourbooking 50% of the profits from sales went to [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Destiny Soli-T-Shirt|url=https://tickets.destiny-tourbooking.com/produkte/25887-destiny-soli-t-shirt|access-date=2020-11-19|website=tickets.destiny-tourbooking.com|language=de}}</ref>

On May 31, 2020 MDB took part in a digital festival “Stay Home and Stay Antiracist” hosted by Kulturinitiative Mittel-Holstein with the festival's main goal of raising funds for various [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] initiatives in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2020|title=Moscow Death Brigade @ Stay at home - But stay antiracist Festival|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfCUq0Tio54|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>
