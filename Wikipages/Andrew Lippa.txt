==Early life==
Lippa was born in [[Leeds]], [[England]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=28 October 2003|title=Leeds Songwriter in ''Notes from New York''|url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/news/lippa.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919175058/http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/news/lippa.htm|archive-date=19 September 2010|website=The British Theatre Guide}}</ref> to English parents. He emigrated to the United States in October 1967 and grew up in [[Oak Park, Michigan]], a suburb of Detroit. Lippa attended [[Oak Park High School (Michigan)|Oak Park High School]] and later the [[University of Michigan]], where he studied vocal performance but eventually transferred into music education and received his bachelor's degree in music education. After graduating from college,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|date=20 July 2008|title=Andrew Lippa and David Bloch|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/fashion/weddings/20lippa.html|url-status=live|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Lippa moved to New York City in 1987 and became a middle school music teacher at Columbia Grammar and Prep School (CGPS) on the Upper West Side. He was promoted his second year at CGPS to dean of 7th and 8th grade students – an assistant principal position – and held that post, in addition to teaching music, until June 1991. 
In 1988 Lippa was accepted into the celebrated [[BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop]] as a composer. There he met his future collaborator Tom Greenwald (''[[John & Jen]]''). He later pursued a career in musical composition.

==Musical theatre career==
Lippa began his professional theatrical career at the [[Goodspeed Opera House]] in East Haddam, Connecticut. He was hired in early 1992 to be the pianist for a production of ''[[It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman|It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman]]'' but quickly rose to become the dance arranger and assistant music director. He then stayed on for the remainder of the season in that capacity. Following the Goodspeed, Lippa worked at various theatres as music director and/or pianist in addition to being an increasingly in-demand arranger.

The Goodspeed produced Lippa’s first musical, ''[[John & Jen]]'' (book by Tom Greenwald), in 1993 at the [[The Norma Terris Theatre|Norma Terris Theatre]] in Chester, Connecticut. That production was followed by a workshop production the following year at the [[Berkshire Theatre Festival]] and, ultimately, a nearly 6-month run at [[Lamb's Theatre]] in New York City. The show was produced by [[Carolyn Rossi Copeland]].

Lippa then went on to write the book, music, and lyrics for ''[[The Wild Party (Lippa musical)|The Wild Party]]''. He began work in 1996, and the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] presented a reading of the first act later that year. [[Julia Murney]], who later played the lead role of Queenie, was in the ensemble of that reading. ''The Wild Party'' had a two-week development at the [[The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center|Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in Connecticut in the summer of 1997. Following that period, producers [[Jeffrey Seller]] and [[Kevin McCollum]] optioned the play and, with the Manhattan Theater Club, made plans for production. ''The Wild Party'' was given its world premiere in 2000 at the Off-Broadway Manhattan Theatre Club in New York City. ''The Wild Party'' won the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for best Off-Broadway musical of the season,<ref>{{Cite web|title=1999-2000 Awards|url=https://outercritics.org/awards/1999-2000/|access-date=2 September 2020|website=Outer Critics Circle}}</ref> and Lippa won the 2000 [[Drama Desk Award]] for best music. The show was nominated for 13 Drama Desk Awards — the most of any show that year — including best new musical.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Siegel|first=Barbara|last2=Siegel|first2=Scott|date=15 May 2000|title=2000 Drama Desk Award Winners|url=https://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/news/2000-drama-desk-award-winners_669.html|access-date=2 September 2020|website=TheaterMania|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1999, Lippa contributed three new songs to the Broadway version of ''[[You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown]]'' and created all new arrangements. The three songs were "My New Philosophy" (to be sung by [[Kristin Chenoweth]]), “Beethoven Day”, and the new version of the title song. Lippa also produced the original cast recording and was honored with a [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album|Grammy Award]] nomination for his work on that recording.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Andrew Lippa|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/andrew-lippa/15087|access-date=2 September 2020|website=Grammy Awards|language=en}}</ref>

In 2001, Lippa joined Brian Crawley to create [[A Little Princess (Lippa musical)|a musical adaptation]] of ''[[A Little Princess]]''. The show premiered in the summer of 2004 at [[TheatreWorks (Silicon Valley)|TheatreWorks]] in Palo Alto, California. The recording was released on September 13, 2011, on [[Ghostlight Records]]. [[Texas State University–San Marcos|Texas State University]]'s musical theatre department, under the direction of actress [[Kaitlin Hopkins]], presented a revised version of the show in concert with Lippa conducting October 16–19.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blaschke|first=Jayme|date=7 September 2011|title=Lippa, Crawley to premiere ‘A Little Princess’ at Texas State|url=https://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2011/September-2011/LittlePrincess090711.html|access-date=3 September 2020|website=www.txstate.edu|language=en}}</ref> Following that production, [[Music Theatre International]] made the title available for license to theatres all over the world.

In 2006, the musical ''Asphalt Beach'', with music and lyrics by Lippa and the book by T. C. Smith and [[Peter Spears]], premiered at the [[American Music Theatre Project]] at [[Northwestern University]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Moore|first=Judy|date=19 October 2006|title=AMTP premieres rock musical ‘Asphalt Beach’ Oct. 27|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/observer/issues/2006/10/20/amtp.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223051355/http://www.northwestern.edu/observer/issues/2006/10/20/amtp.html|archive-date=23 December 2012|access-date=10 August 2013|website=www.northwestern.edu|language=en-US}}</ref> After producing ''Asphalt Beach'', Stuart Oken asked Lippa to write the music and lyrics for ''[[The Addams Family (musical)|The Addams Family]]'' (book by [[Marshall Brickman]] and [[Rick Elice]]).

==Additional work==
In 1998, Lippa was commissioned by the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver to create an anthem for a concert celebrating Israel's 50th birthday, to be sung by 350 singers and conducted by [[Sergiu Comissiona]] of the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]].

As a singer, Lippa has performed at [[Carnegie Hall]], [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]], [[The Rainbow Room]], and The Supper Club.

For Halloween weekend, 2011, the [[Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra]] under the baton of Stuart Malina premiered ''The Addams Family Casket of Orchestral Grotesqueries'', a symphonic suite from Lippa's musical ''The Addams Family'', arranged by Lippa and [[Larry Hochman]] and orchestrated by Hochman.

A show called ''Jerry Christmas'', with music and lyrics by Lippa and book by Daniel Goldfarb, was produced by [[New York Stage and Film]] in 2007 but has since been shelved.

Lippa wrote the music and lyrics for ''The Man in the Ceiling'', a musical based on [[Jules Feiffer]]'s children's book of the same name, with book by Feiffer. The show, originally developed by [[Disney Theatrical]] and [[Thomas Schumacher|Tom Schumacher]], had two readings in 2008 but didn't have its first full production until 2017, when it opened at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, New York.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jacobson|first=Aileen|date=18 May 2017|title=Jules Feiffer and a ‘Hamilton’ Producer Color Outside the Lines for a New Musical|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/theater/jules-feiffer-and-a-hamilton-producer-color-outside-the-lines-for-a-new-musical.html|access-date=3 September 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Ghostlight Records released the cast recording, featuring [[Gavin Creel]] and [[Kate Baldwin]], on April 18, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lippa|first=Andrew|date=29 August 2019|title=Andrew Lippa Breaks Down His Score for The Man in the Ceiling|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/andrew-lippa-breaks-down-his-score-for-the-man-in-the-ceiling|access-date=3 September 2020|website=Playbill|language=en}}</ref>

In 2012, the [[San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus]] and several other gay men's choruses commissioned Lippa to write a musical tribute to the life and legacy of [[Harvey Milk]]. The resulting 60-minute oratorio, entitled ''I Am Harvey Milk'' and starring Lippa as Harvey Milk, premiered at San Francisco's [[Nourse Theater]] on June 26, 2013—the same day on which the U.S. Supreme Court declared Section 3 of DOMA and California Proposition 8 unconstitutional.

In November 2013, Lippa made his London debut with two concert performances at the [[St. James Theatre, London|St. James Theatre]], London.
