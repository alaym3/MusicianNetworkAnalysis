'''The Yellow Monkey''', sometimes abbreviated as {{nihongo|Yemon|イエモン|Iemon|lead=yes}}, is a Japanese [[rock music|rock]] band originally active from 1988 to 2001, before officially disbanding in 2004. They announced their reformation in 2016.

The band's name was derived from the [[ethnic slur]] that [[Japanese people]] look like monkeys,<ref name="hmv_japan_top100">{{cite web| title = Top 100 Japanese pops Artists - No.81| url = http://www.hmv.co.jp/news/newsDetail.asp?newsnum=308260017| work = [[HMV Group]]| language = Japanese| accessdate = 2012-08-30}}</ref> and that Asian people are said to be "yellow" in skin color. The Yellow Monkey is considered an important [[Japanese rock]] group, having achieved major success selling 10 million records,<ref name="10million">{{cite web| title = THE YELLOW MONKEY、15年ぶりに集結。5月から全国アリーナツアー開催| url = http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000123021| work = Barks.jp| language = Japanese| date = 2016-01-08| accessdate = 2016-02-28}}</ref> including 6.2 million singles.<ref>{{cite web| title = THE YELLOW MONKEY、解散以来初の４人のコメントを公開| url = http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000036523| work = Barks.jp| language = Japanese| date = 2007-12-18| accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> The group has had three consecutive number one albums, 18 top ten singles and in 2003 were ranked number 81 on [[HMV Group|HMV Japan]]'s list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts.<ref name="hmv_japan_top100"/> Outside Japan the band is best known for their song "[[Jam/Tactics|Tactics]]", one of the many ending themes of the [[Rurouni Kenshin (TV series)|''Rurouni Kenshin'' anime]].

== History ==

=== 1988–1994: The Beginning ===
The group has its roots in 1988, formed by [[Kazuya Yoshii]] when his previous band Urgh Police disbanded. He, originally playing bass, switched to guitar when he recruited Yoichi Hirose (ex-Murbas), Eiji Kikuchi (ex-Killer May) and several other members and they began to play in the live houses of Tokyo. When the vocalist left, Yoshii took over that position and recruited Eiji's brother [[Hideaki Kikuchi|Hideaki]] as guitarist.

The Yellow Monkey started to play in the underground circuit, being well known for not only their latent songwriting quality, but also because of their live performances, which would soon become the main characteristics of the group. A December 28, 1989 show at Shibuya La Mama is regarded as the first with these four members.<ref name="hmv_japan_top100"/> The fans of the band grew vertiginously, preparing the band for their first studio work.

In 1991, the band finally launched their first album, ''Bunched Birth'', which had seven original songs. It was an independently released album with raw sonority, with many influences from hard rock, and containing well-shaped but peculiar lyrics (all of them written by Yoshii). The work was very well received by the public, opening the doors for their major label debut album, ''The Night Snails and Plastic Boogie'', of 1992 on Triad/[[Nippon Columbia]]. The new album brought eleven songs more elaborate than the first work. The band had a considerable increase in popularity, which added to single "Romantist Taste" and to the [[ballad]] "Pearl Light of Revolution", that already gave samples of the potential of Kazuya in composing powerful ballads.

In 1993, the band launched their second major album, ''Experience Movie''. The songs had a better production and care with the sonority. The songs of the album were very strong and with high emotional text.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The band also started to be admired for their live performances, due to the band's charisma and Kazuya's extreme performances. However, the band had not yet become a large public success in Japan.

In 1994, they released the album ''Jaguar Hard Pain'', a conceptual album which tells the saga of Jaguar, a [[World War II]] soldier who dies in combat and comes back to life trying to find his love, Mary. This was the last album from the first period of the band, when their songs did not have as much popular sound appeal.

=== 1995–2000: The Success ===
By the year 1995, The Yellow Monkey had already become successful in Japan, playing their first show at the [[Nippon Budokan]] on April 11. They released the album ''Smile'', which was another critical and public success, and the band released the single "Love Communication". Other songs that became classics of the band are "Fantasy" (Nagekunari Waga Yoru no Fantasy), "Scorching Night" (Nettaiya), the powerful ballad "Hard Rain" and "Venus's Flower" (Venus no Hana). The tour for this album in Japan booked more than 40 major shows.

When it seemed that the band would rest, at the end of that same year, they released the album ''Four Seasons'', which was recorded in London. The album reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Oricon charts. The album had more-accessible songs, and reached a warm reception by the fans. There were also fans of anime because the song "[[Jam/Tactics|Tactics]]" was used as the first ending theme of the [[Rurouni Kenshin (TV series)|''Rurouni Kenshin'' anime]], becoming their most successful single up until that point. Many other classics were already identified, such as "The Sun Is Burning" (Taiyō ga Moeteiru), the good rock-and-roll track "I Love You Baby" and songs such as "Father", "Remembering a Mermaid" (Tsuioku no Mermaid) and "The Moon Song" (Tsuki no Uta). Despite the thundering success of the record, the Yellow Monkey continued being a cult band, since the lyrics and live performances remained consistent. On May 5, 1996, The Yellow Monkey performed in London with [[The Spiders from Mars]].

After two back-to-back record releases, the band decided to take a break for one year. The decision was aided by Kazuya's stress from the constant and exhausting work of the two previous albums. The compilation album ''Triad Years Act 1'' was released and was certified by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan|RIAJ]] for sales of a million copies.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www18.ocn.ne.jp/~hbr/jp1mal_e.htm| title = RIAJ CERTIFIED MILLION SELLER ALBUMS| publisher = ocn.ne.jp| accessdate = 2015-02-19| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120805230217/http://www18.ocn.ne.jp/~hbr/jp1mal_e.htm| archivedate = 2012-08-05}}</ref> They also changed record labels to [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Funhouse]]/[[Ariola Japan]] and put on a special show, Mekara Uroko 7, at the end of the year. It was a concert for the oldest fans of the band, in which they had played older songs from before the ''Smile'' album. Many of these old fans considered those songs to be mainstream and [[pop music|pop]] in excess. An unforgettable part of this concert was the moment where they played "Pearl Light of Revolution" with an orchestral arrangement. This according to Kazuya, was one of the best moments in his career.

In 1997, The Yellow Monkey came back with the album that is considered their [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Sicks''. This album brought a different sonority compared to the two previous works. It was a mix of their current sound combined with that of their first albums. Bringing more complex and mature songs, ''Sicks'', was an amazing critical success and repeated the sales of the previous album. The main characteristic of the record is the concern of the band with the arrangements, which becomes more evident already in the first track, "Rainbow Man". The only single of the album was "Rakuen", which was successful and is still one of their best known songs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Despite being a concise album, whose songs are all equivalent in quality, there are three songs that made the album legendary. The first one is the already cited "Rakuen", with a strong chorus. "Rakuen" ("Paradise") was covered by [[Eric Martin (musician)|Eric Martin]], known as [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]] vocalist, in his album ''Mr. Rock Vocalist'' released in 2012. The second is the ballad "End of Life (for Grandmother)" (Jinsei no Owari  (for Grandmother)), considered by many as the best ballad by The Yellow Monkey. The third song is the long eight-minute epic, "Trip in Heaven" (Tengoku Ryokou), again considered among the best songs of the group.

The band released the commercially successful album ''Punch Drunkard'' in 1998, although not to the extent of their previous album it was named one of the top albums from 1989-1998 in a 2004 issue of the music magazine ''Band Yarouze''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 44 Albums from 1989 - 1998|url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-5-top-44-albums-from-1989-1998.html|work=jame-world.com|date=2004-05-09|accessdate=2015-02-19}}</ref> The songs "Kyūkon" ("Bulb"), "Burn", and "Love Love Show" easily became hits. Although containing accessible songs, such as the ones cited in this article, the album used the song-writing method of the previous album, ''Sicks''. The success of the album made it possible for the band to begin a great tour with 113 live concerts, the most of their career.<ref name="Drunkard movie">{{cite web | title = THE YELLOW MONKEY Reveals Documentary Video | work = Barks.jp| url = http://www.en.barks.jp/sp/news/?id=1000002773| accessdate = 2013-08-18}}</ref> They also did a small tour in the [[United Kingdom]].

After the exhausting succession of concerts and tours, the group took a one-year break. Coming back in 2000, the Yellow Monkey released their last studio album, ''8''. They released many singles such as "Holy Sea and Sunshine" (Seinaru Umi to Sunshine), "Pearl", "Rosy Days" (Barairo no Hibi) and "Shock Hearts", all of them achieving great success. The album is considered the most occidental of the band, which was common for all Japanese bands at that time. Despite the success of the album, the group did not stage many concerts that year, already showing that the end was coming.

=== 2001–2004: The End and post-activities===
On January 8, 2001 the group held their last concert at the Tokyo Dome, beginning a hiatus for an indefinite amount of time and released their last single "Primal." at the end of the month, which was produced by [[Tony Visconti]].<ref>{{cite web| title = 内的苦悩と新次元に到達するための試み| url = http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=52219191| work = Barks.jp| language = Japanese| date = 2001-01-19| accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> The compilation album ''Golden Years Singles 1996–2001'' followed in June. The members released many solo albums, with Kazuya reaching more success and adopting the stage name of Yoshii Lovinson, which he abandoned some years later. Hirose also obtained relative success with his band, Heesey with Dudes. Annie teamed up with Anchang ([[Sex Machineguns]]) and Natchin ([[Siam Shade]]) to form the trio Big Bites.<ref>{{cite web| title = BIG BITES、これぞまさしくロック界の日本代表"侍ジャパン"| url = http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000047954| work = Barks.jp| language = Japanese| date = 2009-03-18| accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> [[Hideaki Kikuchi|Hideaki]] formed the loose musical collaboration project brainchild's.<ref>{{cite web| title = 元イエモン菊地英昭率いるbrainchild'sが東阪公演決定 | url = http://www.billboard-japan.com/d_news/detail/27875/2| work = [[Billboard Japan]]| language = Japanese| date = 2015-04-28| accessdate = 2015-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201235200/http://www.billboard-japan.com/d_news/detail/27875/2 |archive-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref>

In 2004, the band released a large compilation ''Mother of All the Best'', which included three discs with some singles, all b-sides, some demo-version songs and live performances. The Yellow Monkey officially announced their disbandment on July 7, 2004.<ref>{{cite web| title = THE YELLOW MONKEYの解散発表でファンの反応は？| url = http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000001826| work = Barks.jp| language = Japanese| date = 2004-08-03| accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> However, the four members got together one last time for the final day of The Exhibition and Video Festival of The Yellow Monkey Mekara Uroko 15 held at the Tokyo Dome on December 26, 2004 and performed "[[Jam/Tactics|Jam]]".<ref>{{cite web | title = Petticoat Lane PRESENTS THE EXHIBITION AND VIDEO FESTIVAL OF THE YELLOW MONKEY 『メカラ ウロコ・15』 2004.12.26（SUN）東京ドームにて。| url = http://www.hotexpress.co.jp/live_report/theyellowmonkey2/| work = Hot Express| language = Japanese| accessdate = 2021-05-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108013056/http://www.hotexpress.co.jp/live_report/theyellowmonkey2/|archivedate=2010-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = 【紅白】イエモンが歌う名曲「JAM」とは!?| url = https://thetv.jp/news/detail/97026/| work = [[Kadokawa Corporation]]| language = Japanese| date = 2016-12-29| accessdate = 2021-05-15}}</ref>

===2016–present: The Reformation===
[[Image:Kokuritsu Yoyogi Kyōgijō 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Yellow Monkey performed their first concert in 15 years at [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]].]]
Rumors began circulating about the band reforming after the appearance of a mysterious website with a picture of a cocoon and a timer counting down to January 8, 2016. Various clues on the page led to the notion of the band reuniting, including [[GPS]] coordinates of the venue where they held their first concert. It was confirmed on January 8 that The Yellow Monkey would reform for a twenty-date arena tour, beginning with their first concert in fifteen years on May 11 at the [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]].<ref name="10million"/><ref>{{cite news|title=イエモン、"サル年"に15年ぶり復活 5月からアリーナツアー20公演|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2065015/|publisher=[[Oricon]]|accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> It was Yoshii who initiated the reunion when he emailed the other members about it after seeing [[The Rolling Stones]] perform in London in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guest Room Back Number 2016年10月23日|url=https://www.j-wave.co.jp/original/tokiohot100/guest_past/past_20161023.htm|work=Tokio Hot 100|publisher=[[J-Wave]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=2021-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ogura|first=Ēji|title=かつてと異なる斬新グルーヴ感！ THE YELLOW MONKEY、19年ぶり ニュー・アルバム |url=https://dot.asahi.com/wa/2019050900063.html?page=1|work=AERA dot.|publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|language=Japanese|date= 2019-05-10|accessdate=2021-05-18}}</ref> Their first new song, "Alright", debuted on the radio on February 10, 2016.<ref>{{cite web| title = THE YELLOW MONKEY、待望の新曲は「ALRIGHT」。2月10日にラジオで一斉解禁| url = http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000123993| work = Barks.jp| language = Japanese| date = 2016-02-05| accessdate = 2016-02-28}}</ref> "Alright" is included as the B-side on their first single since reuniting, "Tower of Sand" ("Suna no Tō"), which was released on October 19, 2016.<ref>{{cite web| title = New Single from THE YELLOW MONKEY| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/news-122770-new-single-from-the-yellow-monkey.html| work = jame-world.com| date = 2016-09-10| accessdate = 2016-09-10}}</ref> The year saw them perform 42 concerts to over 360,000 people.<ref name="NewBest">{{cite web| title = THE YELLOW MONKEY、新曲「ロザーナ」ティザー映像＋新録ベスト＋東京ドーム公演日程発表| url = https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000139702| work = Barks.jp| language = Japanese| date = 2017-03-17| accessdate = 2017-09-25}}</ref> The band was honored with a Special Award at the [[58th Japan Record Awards]] in 2016, and the Best Respect Artist award at the 2017 [[Space Shower Music Awards]] for their influence and achievements in music.<ref name="58Jap">{{cite web| title = 『第58回輝く！日本レコード大賞』、各賞受賞者が発表に| url = https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000135203| work = Barks.jp| language = Japanese| date = 2016-11-18| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref><ref name="RespectAward">{{cite web | title = スペシャ「MUSIC AWARDS」最優秀アーティストはRADWIMPS！ アレキ、星野らも受賞 | url = https://rockinon.com/news/detail/157377| work = [[Rockin'On Japan]]| language = Japanese| date = 2017-03-08| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>
