'''Timbuktu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɪ|m|b|ʌ|k|ˈ|t|uː}} {{respell|TIM|buk|TOO}}; {{lang-fr|Tombouctou}}; {{lang-tmh|label=[[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]|script=Tfng|ⵜⵏⴱⴾⵜ|Tin Buqt}}; [[Koyra Chiini]]: {{lang|khq|Tumbutu}}) is a city in [[Mali]], situated {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the [[Niger River]]. The town is the capital of the [[Tombouctou Region]], one of the eight [[Regions of Mali|administrative regions of Mali]]. It had a population of 54,453 in the 2009 census.

Timbuktu started out as a seasonal settlement and became a permanent settlement early in the 12th century. After a shift in trading routes, particularly after the visit by [[Mansa Musa]] around 1325, Timbuktu flourished from the trade in salt, gold, ivory, and slaves. It became part of the [[Mali Empire]] early in the 14th century. In the first half of the 15th century, the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] tribes took control of the city for a short period until the expanding [[Songhai Empire]] absorbed the city in 1468. A [[Saadi dynasty|Moroccan]] army [[Saadian invasion of the Songhai Empire|defeated the Songhai in 1591]] and made Timbuktu, rather than [[Gao]], their capital. The invaders established a new ruling class, the [[Arma people|Arma]], who after 1612 became virtually independent of Morocco. However, the golden age of the city, when it was a major learning and cultural centre of the Mali Empire, was over, and it entered a long period of decline. Different tribes governed until the [[French Sudan|French took over in 1893]], a situation that lasted until it became part of the current [[Republic of Mali]] in 1960. Presently, Timbuktu is impoverished and suffers from [[desertification]].

In its Golden Age, the town's numerous [[Islamic scholar]]s and extensive trading network supported an important book trade: together with the campuses of the [[Sankore Madrasah]], an [[Madrasa|Islamic university]], this established Timbuktu as a scholarly centre in Africa. Several notable historic writers, such as Shabeni and [[Leo Africanus]], wrote about the city. These stories fuelled speculation in Europe, where the city's reputation shifted from being extremely rich to being mysterious.

==Toponymy==
[[File:Caillie 1830 Timbuktu view.jpg|thumb|Timbuktu looking west, [[René Caillié]] (1830)]]
[[File:Barth 1858 Timbuktu from terrace.jpg|thumb|View of Timbuktu, [[Heinrich Barth]] (1858)]]
Over the centuries, the spelling of Timbuktu has varied a great deal: from ''Tenbuch'' on the [[Catalan Atlas]] (1375), to traveller [[Antonio Malfante]]'s ''Thambet'', used in a letter he wrote in 1447 and also adopted by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in his ''Voyages of Cadamosto'', to [[Heinrich Barth]]'s ''Timbúktu'' and ''Timbu'ktu''. French spelling often appears in international reference as "Tombouctou".The German spelling 'Timbuktu,' and its variant 'Timbucktu' have passed into English and the former has become widely used in recent years. Major English-language works have employed the spelling 'Timbuctoo', and this is considered the correct English form by scholars; 'Timbuctou' and 'Timbuctu' are sometimes used as well. The French continue to use the spelling 'Tombouctou', as they have for over a century; variants include 'Temboctou' (used by explorer René Caillié) and 'Tombouktou', but they are seldom seen. Variant spellings exist for other places as well, such as Jenne (Djenné) and Segu (Ségou).<ref name="Stamm">{{cite book | last1 = Stamm | first1 = Andrea L. | last2 = Bastian | first2 = Dawn E. | last3 = Myers | first3 = Robert A. | title = Mali, The World Bibliographical Series | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 1998 | volume = 207 | pages = 30}}</ref>  As well as its spelling, Timbuktu's [[toponymy]] is still open to discussion.{{efn|"Timbuktu" – regardless of spelling, has long been used as a metaphor for "out in the middle of nowhere". E.g. "From here to Timbuktu and back."<ref name="Pelizzo">{{Cite journal|last=Pelizzo |first=Riccardo |title=Timbuktu: A Lesson in Underdevelopment |journal=Journal of World-Systems Research |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=265–283 |year=2001 |doi=10.5195/JWSR.2001.166|doi-access=free }}</ref>}} At least four possible origins of the name of Timbuktu have been described:
*Songhay origin: both [[Leo Africanus]] and Heinrich Barth believed the name was derived from two [[Songhay languages|Songhay words]]:<ref name=" Pelizzo" /> Leo Africanus writes the Kingdom of Tombuto was named after a town of the same name, founded in 1213 or 1214 by ''[[Mansa (title)|Mansa]]'' [[Suleyman]].{{sfn|Leo Africanus|1896|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historyanddescr02porygoog#page/n140/mode/1up 824 Vol. 3]}} The word itself consisted of two parts: ''tin'' (wall) and ''butu'' (Wall of Butu). Africanus did not explain the meaning of this ''Butu''.<ref name="Pelizzo" /> Heinrich Barth wrote: "The town was probably so called, because it was built originally in a hollow or cavity in the sand-hills. Tùmbutu means hole or womb in the Songhay language: if it were a Temáshight ([[Tamashek]]) word, it would be written Timbuktu. The name is generally interpreted by Europeans as ''well'' of Buktu (also same word in [[Persian language|Persian]] is bâkhtàr باختر = where the sun sets, West), but ''tin'' has nothing to do with ''well''."{{sfn|Barth|1857|p=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Yy1ufHcjtIQC/page/n285 284 footnote Vol. 3]}}
*Berber origin: Malian historian Sekene Cissoko proposes a different [[etymology]]: the Tuareg founders of the city gave it a [[Berber languages|Berber name]], a word composed of two parts: ''tim'', the feminine form of ''in'' (place of) and ''bouctou'', a small dune. Hence, Timbuktu would mean "place covered by small dunes".<ref>{{cite book |last=Cissoko |first=S.M |year=1996 |title=l'Empire Songhai |place=Paris |publisher=L'Harmattan |language=fr |isbn=978-2-7384-4384-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFXJZboYT30C}}</ref>
*Abd al-Sadi offers a third explanation in his 17th-century ''[[Tarikh al-Sudan]]'': "The Tuareg made it a depot for their belongings and provisions, and it grew into a crossroads for travelers coming and going. Looking after their belongings was a slave woman of theirs called Timbuktu, which in their language means [the one having a] 'lump'. The blessed spot where she encamped was named after her."{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p=29}}
*The French [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[René Basset]] forwarded another theory: the name derives from the [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] root ''b-k-t'', meaning "to be distant" or "hidden", and the feminine possessive particle ''tin''. The meaning "hidden" could point to the city's location in a slight hollow.{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p=29 note 4}}

The validity of these theories depends on the identity of the original founders of the city: as recently as 2000, [[Archaeology|archaeological research]] has not found remains dating from the 11th/12th century within the limits of the modern city given the difficulty of excavating through [[desertification|metres of sand]] that have buried the remains over the past centuries.{{sfn|Insoll|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Insoll|2004}} Without [[consensus]], the etymology of Timbuktu remains unclear.

==Prehistory==
Like other important Medieval West African towns such as [[Djenné]] ([[Jenné-Jeno]]), [[Gao]], and [[Dia, Mali|Dia]], [[Iron Age]] settlements have been discovered near Timbuktu that predate the traditional foundation date of the town. Although the accumulation of thick layers of sand has thwarted archaeological excavations in the town itself,{{sfn|Insoll|2002}}{{sfn|Insoll|2004}} some of the surrounding landscape is deflating and exposing pottery shards on the surface. A survey of the area by Susan and Roderick McIntosh in 1984 identified several Iron Age sites along the el-Ahmar, an ancient wadi system that passes a few kilometers to the east of the modern town.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McIntosh |first1=Susan Keech |last2=McIntosh |first2=Roderick J. |year=1986 |title=Archaeological reconnaissance in the region of Timbuktu |journal=National Geographic Research |volume=2 |pages=302–319 |url-access=registration |url=https://www.academia.edu/7328675}}</ref>

An Iron Age [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] complex located {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of the Timbuktu near the Wadi el-Ahmar was excavated between 2008 and 2010 by archaeologists from [[Yale University]] and the Mission Culturelle de Tombouctou. The results suggest that the site was first occupied during the 5th century BC, thrived throughout the second half of the 1st millennium AD and eventually collapsed sometime during the late 10th or early 11th-century AD.{{sfn|Park|2010}}{{sfn|Park|2011}}<!--Ph.D. thesis - a poor ref – and needs page numbers-->

==History==
{{main|History of Timbuktu}}
{{Summarize|from|History of Timbuktu|section=y|better=y|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Tombouctou-La Place du Marché (AOF).jpg|thumb|View of Timbuktu, [[French Sudan]]]]
Timbuktu was a regional trade center in medieval times, where caravans met to exchange salt from the Sahara Desert for gold, ivory, and slaves from the Sahel, which could be reached via the nearby Niger River. The population (2018 population 32,460) swelled from 10,000 in the 13th century to about 50,000 in the 16th century after the establishment of a major Islamic university ([[University of Timbuktu]]), which attracted scholars from throughout the Muslim world. 

The [[Saadian invasion of the Songhai Empire|Moroccans invaded the Songhai Empire ]] in 1590 and, after the 1591 [[Battle of Tondibi]], occupied Timbuktu. In 1593 most of the University faculty was executed or exiled for disloyalty to the new rulers, and this, along with a decline in trade caused by increased competition from newly available trans-Atlantic sailing routes, caused the city to decline. The first European to reach Timbuktu, [[Alexander Gordon Laing]], did not arrive until 1826, and it was not until the 1890s that Timbuktu was formally incorporated into the French colony of Mali. Today, the city is still inhabited; however, the city is not as geopolitically relevant as it once was.

==Geography==
[[File:A camel ride in the Sahara Desert.jpg|thumb|A camel ride in the [[Sahara]] desert, outside Timbuktu]]
Timbuktu is located on the southern edge of the [[Sahara]] {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the main channel of the River Niger. The town is surrounded by sand dunes and the streets are covered in sand. The port of [[Kabara, Mali|Kabara]] is {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south of the town and is connected to an arm of the river by a {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} canal. The canal had become heavily silted but in 2007 it was dredged as part of a Libyan financed project.<ref name="retour" />

The annual flood of the Niger River is a result of the heavy rainfall in the headwaters of the Niger and [[Bani River|Bani]] rivers in [[Guinea]] and northern [[Ivory Coast]]. The rainfall in these areas peaks in August but the floodwater takes time to pass down the river system and through the [[Inner Niger Delta]]. At [[Koulikoro]], {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} downstream from [[Bamako]], the flood peaks in September,<ref>{{citation|title=Composite Runoff Fields V 1.0: Koulikoro |url=http://www.compositerunoff.sr.unh.edu/html/Polygons/P1134100.html | publisher=University of New Hampshire/Global Runoff Data Center | access-date=30 January 2011}}</ref> while in Timbuktu the flood lasts longer and usually reaches a maximum at the end of December.<ref>{{citation|title=Composite Runoff Fields V 1.0: Diré | url=http://www.compositerunoff.sr.unh.edu/html/Polygons/P1134700.html | publisher=University of New Hampshire/Global Runoff Data Center | access-date=30 January 2011}}. Diré is the nearest hydrometric station on the River Niger, {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} upstream of Timbuktu.</ref>

In the past, the area flooded by the river was more extensive and in years with high rainfall, floodwater would reach the western outskirts of Timbuktu itself.{{sfn |Hacquard|1900| p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103743p/f19.image 12]}} A small navigable creek to the west of the town is shown on the maps published by [[Heinrich Barth]] in 1857{{sfn |Barth| 1857 | loc=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Yy1ufHcjtIQC/page/n285 <!-- pg=284 --> Vol. 3, p. 324]}} and [[Félix Dubois]] in 1896.{{sfn|Dubois|1896|p=[https://archive.org/stream/timbuctoomysteri00duborich#page/196/mode/1up 196]}} Between 1917 and 1921, during the colonial period, the French used slave labour to dig a narrow canal linking Timbuktu with Kabara.<ref>{{citation |last=Jones |first=Jim |year=1999 |title=Rapports Économiques du Cercle de Tombouctou, 1922–1945: Archives Nationales du Mali, Fonds Recents (Series 1Q362) |url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/jones/his311/archives/anm/1q362fr.htm |publisher=West Chester University, Pennsylvania |access-date=26 March 2011 }}</ref> Over the following decades this became silted and filled with sand, but in 2007 as part of the dredging project, the canal was re-excavated so that now when the River Niger floods, Timbuktu is again connected to Kabara.<ref name="retour">{{citation | title=Développement régional: le fleuve est de rétour à Tombouctou | url=http://www.koulouba.pr.ml/spip.php?article1236 | publisher=Présidence de la République du Mali | date=3 December 2007 | access-date=19 March 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001095603/http://www.koulouba.pr.ml/spip.php?article1236 | archive-date=1 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="lancement">{{citation | title= Lancement des travaux du Canal de Tombouctou : la mamelle nourricière redonne vie et espoir à la 'Cité mystérieuse' |date=14 August 2006 |url=http://www.afribone.com/spip.php?article4208 | publisher=Afribone }}</ref> The Malian government has promised to address problems with the design of the canal as it currently lacks footbridges and the steep, unstable banks make access to the water difficult.<ref>{{citation |last=Coulibaly |first=Be |date=12 January 2011 |title=Canal de Daye à Tombouctou: la sécurité des riverains |publisher=Primature: République du Mali |access-date=26 March 2011 |url=http://www.primature.gov.ml/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6021:canal-de-daye-a-tombouctou-la-securite-des-riverains&catid=12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200627/http://www.primature.gov.ml/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6021:canal-de-daye-a-tombouctou-la-securite-des-riverains&catid=12 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Kabara can only function as a port in December to January when the river is in full flood. When the water levels are lower, boats dock at Korioumé which is linked to Timbuktu by {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} of paved road.

===Climate===
Timbuktu features a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh'') according to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]]. The weather is extremely hot and dry throughout much of the year, with most of the city’s rainfall occurring between June and September, due to the influence of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ). The degree of [[diurnal temperature variation]] is higher in the dry season than the wet season. Average daily maximum temperatures in the hottest months of the year – April, May and June – exceed {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Lowest temperatures occur during the mildest months of the year – December, January and February. However, average maximum temperatures do not drop below {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}}. These winter months are characterized by a dry, dusty [[trade wind]] blowing from the Saharan [[Tibesti Region]] southward to the [[Gulf of Guinea]]: picking up dust particles on their way, these winds limit visibility in what has been dubbed the '[[Harmattan]] Haze'.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Adefolalu |first=D.O. |title=On bioclimatological aspects of Harmattan dust haze in Nigeria |journal=Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=387–404 |date=25 December 1984 |doi=10.1007/BF02274004 |bibcode=1984AMGBB..33..387A |s2cid=118906504 }}</ref> Additionally, when the dust settles in the city, sand builds up and desertification looms.<ref name="benjaminsen" />

==Economy==
===Salt trade===
[[File:Bilma-Salzkarawane1.jpg|thumb|Azalai salt caravan, mid-December 1985.]]
The wealth and very existence of Timbuktu depended on its position as the southern terminus of an important trans-Saharan trade route; nowadays, the only goods that are routinely transported across the desert are slabs of rock salt brought from the [[Taoudenni]] mining centre in the central Sahara {{convert|664|km|abbr=on}} north of Timbuktu. Until the second half of the 20th century most of the slabs were transported by large salt caravans or [[azalai]], one leaving Timbuktu in early November and the other in late March.{{sfn|Miner|1953|p=68 n27}}

The caravans of several thousand camels took three weeks each way, transporting food to the miners and returning with each camel loaded with four or five {{convert|30|kg|0|abbr=on}} slabs of salt. The salt transport was largely controlled by the desert nomads of the Arabic-speaking Berabich (or Barabish) tribe.<ref>{{citation |last=Meunier |first=D. |year=1980 |title=Le commerce du sel de Taoudeni |journal=Journal des Africanistes |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=133–144 |doi=10.3406/jafr.1980.2010 |language=fr }}</ref> Although there are no roads, the slabs of salt are now usually transported from Taoudenni by truck.<ref>{{citation |last=Harding |first=Andrew |date=3 December 2009 |title=Timbuktu's ancient salt caravans under threat |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8393442.stm |access-date=6 March 2011}}</ref> From Timbuktu the salt is transported by boat to other towns in Mali.

Between the 12th and 14th centuries, Timbuktu's population grew immensely due to an influx of [[Bono people|Bono]], [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]], [[Fula people|Fulanis]], and [[Songhai people|Songhais]] seeking trade, security, or to study. By 1300, the population increased to 10,000 and continued increasing until it reached about 50,000 in the 1500s.{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p={{pn|date=January 2021}}}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maynes |first1=Mary Jo |last2=Waltner |first2=Ann |title=The Family: A World History |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc |location=New York |isbn=9780195338140 |page=45}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
[[File:Women pounding grain.jpg|thumb|Women pounding grain]]
There is insufficient rainfall in the Timbuktu region for purely rain-fed agriculture and crops are therefore irrigated using water from the River Niger. The main agricultural crop is rice. African floating rice (''[[Oryza glaberrima]]'') has traditionally been grown in regions near the river that are inundated during the annual flood. Seed is sown at the beginning of the rainy season (June–July) so that when the flood water arrives plants are already {{convert|30|to|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height.<ref>{{citation |last1=Thom |first1=Derrick J. |last2=Wells |first2=John C. |year=1987 |title=Farming Systems in the Niger Inland Delta, Mali |journal=Geographical Review |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=328–342 |jstor=214124 |doi=10.2307/214124}}</ref>

The plants grow up to {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} in height as the water level rises. The rice is harvested by canoe in December. The procedure is very precarious and the yields are low but the method has the advantage that little capital investment is required. A successful crop depends critically on the amount and timing of the rain in the wet season and the height of the flood. To a limited extent the arrival of the flood water can be controlled by the construction of small mud dikes that become submerged as the water rises.

Although floating rice is still cultivated in the [[Timbuktu Cercle]], most of the rice is now grown in three relatively large irrigated areas that lie to the south of the town: Daye (392&nbsp;ha), Koriomé (550&nbsp;ha) and Hamadja (623&nbsp;ha).<ref name="schema">{{citation |title=Schéma Directeur d'Urbanisme de la Ville de Tombouctou et Environs |year=2006 |url=http://www.logements.gouv.ml/documentation/schema_directeur_tombouctou.pdf |publisher=Ministère de l'Habitat et de l'Urbanisme, République du Mali |place=Bamako, Mali |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428074053/http://www.logements.gouv.ml/documentation/schema_directeur_tombouctou.pdf |archive-date=28 April 2011}}</ref> Water is pumped from the river using ten large [[Archimedes' screw]]s which were first installed in the 1990s.

===Tourism===
Most tourists visit Timbuktu between November and February when the air temperature is lower. In the 1980s, accommodation for tourists was provided by Hendrina Khan Hotel<ref>{{cite web |title=Hotel Hendrina Khan |website=Tripadvisor |url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304007-d599260-Reviews-Hotel_Hendrina_Khan-Timbuktu_Tombouctou_Region.html}}</ref> and two other small hotels: Hotel Bouctou and Hotel Azalaï.<ref name="desherence">{{citation |last=Sayah |first=Moulaye |title=Tombouctou : le tourisme en desherence |url=http://www.essor.ml/regions/article/tombouctou-le-tourisme-en |publisher=L'Essor |date=3 October 2011 |access-date=28 November 2011 |language=fr}}</ref> Over the following decades the tourist numbers increased so that by 2006 there were seven small hotels and guest houses.<ref name="schema" /> The town benefited by the revenue from the CFA&nbsp;5000 tourist tax,<ref name="schema" /> by the sale of handicrafts and by the employment for the guides.

On 30 March 2013, jihadist rebels [[2nd Battle of Timbuktu|infiltrated]] into Timbuktu nine days before a [[Battle of Timbuktu|suicide bombing]] on a Malian army checkpoint at the international airport, killing a soldier. Fighting lasted until 1 April, when French warplanes helped Malian ground forces chase the remaining rebels out of the city center.

==Early accounts in the West==
Tales of Timbuktu's fabulous wealth helped prompt European exploration of the west coast of Africa. Among the most famous descriptions of Timbuktu are those of [[Leo Africanus]] and Shabeni.

===Leo Africanus===

Perhaps most famous among the accounts written about Timbuktu is that by [[Leo Africanus]]. Born El Hasan ben Muhammed el- Wazzan-ez-Zayyati in [[Granada]] in 1485, his family was among the thousands of Muslims expelled by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabel after their [[Granada War|reconquest of Spain]] in 1492. They settled in [[Morocco]], where he studied in [[Fes]] and accompanied his uncle on diplomatic missions throughout North Africa. During these travels, he visited Timbuktu. As a young man he was captured by pirates and presented as an exceptionally learned slave to [[Pope Leo X]], who freed him, [[baptism|baptized]] him under the name "Johannis Leo de Medici", and commissioned him to write, in Italian, a detailed survey of Africa. His accounts provided most of what Europeans [[European exploration of Africa|knew about the continent]] for the next several centuries.{{sfn|Leo Africanus|1896}} Describing Timbuktu when the [[Songhai Empire]] was at its height, the English edition of his book includes the description:
{{Quote|quote = The rich king of Tombuto hath many plates and sceptres of gold, some whereof weigh 1300 pounds. ... He hath always 3000 horsemen ... (and) a great store of doctors, judges, priests, and other learned men, that are bountifully maintained at the king's cost and charges. |source = [[Leo Africanus]], ''[[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Descrittione dell' Africa]]''{{sfn|Leo Africanus|1896|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historyanddescr02porygoog#page/n140/mode/1up 824 Vol. 3]}}}}

According to Leo Africanus, there were abundant supplies of locally produced corn, cattle, milk and butter, though there were neither gardens nor orchards surrounding the city.<ref name=brians>{{cite book |last=Brians |first=Paul |title=Reading About the World |publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishing |year=1998 |location=Fort Worth, TX |volume=II |url=http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/leo_africanus.html }}</ref> In another passage dedicated to describing the wealth of both the environment and the king, Africanus touches upon the rarity of one of Timbuktu's trade commodities: salt.
{{Quote|quote = The inhabitants are very rich, especially the strangers who have settled in the country [..] But salt is in very short supply because it is carried here from [[Tegaza]], some {{convert|500|mi|0|abbr=out}} from Timbuktu. I happened to be in this city at a time when a load of salt sold for eighty [[ducats]]. The king has a rich treasure of coins and [[ingot|gold ingots]]. |source = [[Leo Africanus]], ''[[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Descrittione dell' Africa]]'' in Paul Brians' ''Reading About the World'', Volume 2<ref name=brians/>}}

These descriptions and passages alike caught the attention of European explorers. Africanus also described the more mundane aspects of the city, such as the "cottages built of [[chalk]], and covered with [[thatch]]" – although these went largely unheeded.{{sfn|Insoll|2004}}

===Shabeni===
{{Quote box |quote = The natives of the town of Timbuctoo may be computed at 40,000, exclusive of slaves and foreigners ... The natives are all blacks: almost every stranger marries a female of the town, who are so beautiful that travellers often fall in love with them at first sight.|source = – Shabeni in {{Ill|James Grey Jackson|fr|lt=James Grey Jackson's}} ''An Account of Timbuctoo and Hausa'', 1820{{sfn|Jackson|1820|p=[https://archive.org/details/anaccounttimbuc00jackgoog/page/n43 10]}} |width = 30% |align = right }}
Roughly 250 years after Leo Africanus' visit to Timbuktu, the city had seen many rulers. The end of the 18th century saw the grip of the Moroccan rulers on the city wane, resulting in a period of unstable government by quickly changing tribes. During the rule of one of those tribes, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], a 14-year-old child named Shabeni (or Shabeeny) from [[Tetuan]] on the north coast of Morocco accompanied his father on a visit to Timbuktu.{{sfn|Jackson|1820}}

Shabeni stayed in Timbuktu for three years before moving to a major city called [[Housa]]{{efn|A paper from 1995 says this was "apparently one of the [[Maraka]] towns".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lovejoy |first1=P. |last2=Richardson |first2=D. |date=1995 |title=Competing Markets for Male and Female Slaves: Prices in the Interior of West Africa, 1780-1850 |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=261–293 |doi=10.2307/221615 |jstor=221615}}</ref> A book of letters to [[Thomas Jefferson]] mentions in connexion to a letter of 1798 that explorer [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] had tried unsuccessfully to find Housa and Timbuktu (1795–7).

After being attacked many times by Africans he drowned in the river.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Oberg |editor-first=Barbara B. |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |title=The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Volume 30: 1 January 1798 to 31 January 1799 |page=154 |isbn=978-0-691-09498-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_5ZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA154}}</ref>}} several days' journey to the southeast. Two years later, he returned to Timbuktu to live there for another seven years – one of a population that was, even centuries after its peak and excluding slaves, double the size of the 21st-century town.

By the time Shabeni was 27, he was an established merchant in his hometown of Tetuan. He made a two-year pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and thus became a [[hajji]], Asseed El Hage Abd Salam Shabeeny. Returning from a trading voyage to [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg]], he was captured by a ship manned by Englishmen but sailing under a Russian flag, whose captain claimed that his Imperial mistress ([[Catherine the Great]]) was "at war with all Muselmen" (see [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)]]). He and the ship he had been sailing in were brought to [[Ostend]] in Belgium in December 1789 but the British consul managed to get him and the ship released. He set off again in the same ship, but the captain, who claimed to be afraid of his ship being captured again, set him ashore in [[Dover]]. In England his story was recorded. Shabeeni gave an indication of the size of the city in the second half of the 18th century. In an earlier passage, he described an environment that was characterized by forest, as opposed to the modern arid surroundings.

===Cultural events===
The best-known cultural event is the [[Festival au Désert]].<ref name=reiser/> When the Tuareg rebellion ended in 1996 under the Konaré administration, 3,000 weapons were burned in a ceremony dubbed the Flame of Peace on 29 March 2007 – to commemorate the ceremony, a monument was built.{{sfn|Jeppie|2008}} The [[Festival au Désert]], to celebrate the [[peace treaty]], was held every January in the desert, 75&nbsp;km from the city until 2010.<ref name=reiser>{{Cite book |last=Reiser |first=Melissa Diane |title=Festival au Desert, Essakane, Mali: a postcolonial, postwar Tuareg experiment |publisher=University of Wisconsin – Madison |year=2007 |location=Madison |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47FfAAAAMAAJ }}</ref>

The week-long festival of Mawloud is held every January, and celebrates the birthday of the Prophet Muhammed; the city's "most cherished manuscripts" are read publicly, and are a central part of this celebration.{{sfn|Hammer|2016 |p=133}} It was originally a Shi'ite festival from Persia and arriving in Timbuktu around 1600. The "most joyful occasion on Timbuktu's calendar," it combines "rituals of Sufi Islam with celebrating Timbuktu's rich literary traditions."{{sfn|Hammer|2016|p=228}} It is a "period of feasting, singing, and dancing...It culminated with an evening gathering of thousands of people in the large sandy square in front of the Sankor [[Festival au Désert|é]] Mosque and a public reading of some of the city's most treasured manuscripts."{{sfn|Hammer|2016|p=228}}

===World Heritage Site===
[[File:Timbuktu-107971.jpg|thumb|upright|The mausoleums, erected in the 15th and 16th centuries, are being restored by local workers]]
During its twelfth session, in December 1988, the [[World Heritage Committee]] (WHC) selected parts of Timbuktu's historic centre for inscription on its [[List of World Heritage Sites in Africa|World Heritage list]].<ref name=whsselection>{{Citation  | contribution = Report of the World Heritage Committee Twelfth Session   | contribution-url = https://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom88.htm#119  |title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage | year = 1988 | place = Brasilia | publisher=UNESCO | url = https://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom88.htm  }}</ref> The selection was based on three [[World Heritage Site#Cultural criteria|criteria]]:<ref name=ICOMOS/>

===Centre of learning===
[[File:Timbuktu-manuscripts-astronomy-mathematics.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Timbuktu Manuscripts]] showing both [[mathematics]] and a heritage of [[astronomy in medieval Islam]].]]
Timbuktu was a world centre of Islamic learning from the 13th to the 17th century, especially under the Mali Empire and Askia Mohammad I's rule. The Malian government and NGOs have been working to catalog and restore the remnants of this scholarly legacy: Timbuktu's manuscripts.<ref name=Huddleston>{{Cite journal |last=Huddleston |first=Alexandra |title=Divine Learning: The Traditional Islamic Scholarship of Timbuktu |journal=Fourth Genre: Explorations in Non-Fiction |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=129–135 |date=1 September 2009 |issn=1522-3868 |doi=10.1353/fge.0.0080|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Timbuktu's rapid economic growth in the 13th and 14th centuries drew many scholars from nearby [[Walata]] (today in [[Mauritania]]),{{sfn|Cleaveland|2008}} leading up to the city's golden age in the 15th and 16th centuries that proved fertile ground for scholarship of religions, arts and sciences. To the people of Timbuktu, literacy and books were symbols of wealth, power, and blessings and the acquisition of books became a primary concern for scholars.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Singleton|first1=Brent D.|title=African Bibliophiles: Books and Libraries in Medieval Timbuktu|journal=Libraries & Culture |date=2004 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |jstor=25549150 |s2cid=161645561 |doi=10.1353/lac.2004.0019 |url=https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/library-publications/21}}</ref> An active trade in books between Timbuktu and other parts of the [[Muslim history|Islamic world]] and emperor [[Askia Mohammed]]'s strong support led to the writing of thousands of [[manuscript]]s.{{sfn|Medupe|Warner|Jeppie|Sanogo|2008|p=179}}

Knowledge was gathered in a manner similar to the early, informal [[Medieval university|European Medieval university]] model.{{sfn|Cleaveland|2008}} Lecturing was presented through a range of informal institutions called [[madrasahs]].<ref name="Makdisi Scholasticism">{{citation |last=Makdisi |first=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |date=April–June 1989 |pages=175–182 [176] |doi=10.2307/604423 |jstor=604423 }}</ref> Nowadays known as the [[University of Timbuktu]], three ''madrasahs'' facilitated 25,000 students: [[Djinguereber Mosque|Djinguereber]], [[Sidi Yahya Mosque|Sidi Yahya]] and [[Sankore Madrasah|Sankore]].<ref>{{cite web |title=University of Timbuktu |publisher=Timbuktu Educational Foundation |url=http://www.timbuktufoundation.org/university.html |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924080621/http://www.timbuktufoundation.org/university.html |archive-date=24 September 2012}}</ref>

These institutions were explicitly religious, as opposed to the more secular curricula of modern European universities and more similar to the medieval Europe model. However, where universities in the European sense started as associations of students and teachers, West-African education was [[patronage|patronized]] by families or lineages, with the Aqit and Bunu al-Qadi al-Hajj families being two of the most prominent in Timbuktu – these families also facilitated students is set-aside rooms in their housings.{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|pp=lvii}}  Although the basis of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and its teaching were brought to Timbuktu from North Africa with the spread of Islam, Western African scholarship developed: [[Ahmad Baba al Massufi]] is regarded as the city's greatest scholar.<ref name="baba_the_greatest">{{cite news |first=Lydia |last=Polgreen |title=Timbuktu Hopes Ancient Texts Spark a Revival |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/world/africa/07mali.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 August 2007 |access-date=4 March 2011}}</ref>

Timbuktu served in this process as a distribution centre of scholars and scholarship. Its reliance on trade meant intensive movement of scholars between the city and its extensive network of trade partners. In 1468–1469 though, many scholars left for Walata when [[Sunni Ali]]'s Songhay Empire absorbed Timbuktu.{{sfn|Cleaveland|2008}} Then, in the 1591 Moroccan invasion of Timbuktu, scholars had to flee once more, or faced imprisonment or murder.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Singleton |first1=Brent D. |title=African Bibliophiles: Books and Libraries in Medieval Timbuktu |journal=Libraries & Culture |date=Winter 2004 |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=2|doi=10.1353/lac.2004.0019 |url=https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/library-publications/21 }}</ref> 

This system of education survived until the late 19th century, while the 18th century saw the institution of itinerant Quranic school as a form of universal education, where scholars would travel throughout the region with their students, begging for food part of the day.<ref name=Huddleston/>
Islamic education came under pressure after the French occupation, droughts in the 70s and 80s and by [[Tuareg Rebellion (1990–1995)|Mali's civil war]] in the early 90s.<ref name=Huddleston/>

===Manuscripts and libraries===
{{Main|Timbuktu Manuscripts}}

Hundreds of thousands of manuscripts were collected in Timbuktu over the course of centuries: some were written in the town itself, others – including exclusive copies of the [[Quran]] for wealthy families – imported through the lively booktrade.

Hidden in cellars or buried, hid between the mosque's mud walls and safeguarded by their patrons, many of these manuscripts survived the city's decline. They now form the collection of several libraries in Timbuktu, holding up to 700,000 manuscripts:<ref name=ng>{{cite web |last=Rainier |first=Chris |title=Reclaiming the Ancient Manuscripts of Timbuktu |work=National Geographic News |date=27 May 2003 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/05/0522_030527_timbuktu.html |access-date=13 July 2010}}</ref> In late January 2013 it was reported that rebel forces destroyed many of the manuscripts before leaving the city.<ref>{{citation |last=Harding |first=Luke |date=28 January 2013 |title=Timbuktu mayor: Mali rebels torched library of historic manuscripts |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/28/mali-timbuktu-library-ancient-manuscripts |work=The Guardian |access-date=27 February 2013 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Diarra |first=Adama |date=28 January 2013 |title=French, Malians retake Timbuktu, rebels torch library |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mali-rebels-idUKBRE90P0A120130128 |publisher=Reuters |access-date=27 February 2013}}</ref> "On Friday morning, January 25, 2013, fifteen jihadis entered the restoration and conservation rooms on the ground floor of the [[Ahmed Baba Institute]] in Sankoré...The men swept 4,202 manuscripts off lab tables and shelves, and carried them into the tiled courtyard...They doused the manuscripts in gasoline...and tossed in a lit match.

These libraries are the largest among up to 60 private or public libraries that are estimated to exist in Timbuktu today, although some comprise little more than a row of books on a shelf or a bookchest.<ref>{{Citation |last=Grant |first=Simon |title=Beyond the Saharan Fringe |work=The Guardian |date=8 February 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/feb/08/beyondthesaharanfringe |access-date=19 July 2010 |location=London}}</ref> Under these circumstances, the manuscripts are vulnerable to damage and theft, as well as long term climate damage, despite Timbuktu's arid climate. Two [[Timbuktu Manuscripts Project]]s funded by independent universities have aimed to preserve them.

During the occupation by Islamic extremists the citizens of the city embarked on a drive to save the "best written accounts of African History."  Interviewed by the Times, the local residents claimed to have safeguarded the three hundred thousand manuscripts for generations. Many of these documents are still in the safe-keeping of the local residents, who are reluctant to give them over to the government-run Ahmed Baba Institute housed in a modern digitalization building built by the South African government in 2009. The institute houses only 10% of the manuscripts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2013/02/04/timbuktus-ancient-libraries-saved-by-locals-endangered-by-a-government/|title=Timbuktu's Ancient Libraries: Saved by Locals, Endangered by a Government|last=Walt|first=Vivienne|work=Time|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> It was later confirmed by Jean-Michel Djian to the New Yorker that "the great majority of the manuscripts, about fifty thousand, are actually housed in the thirty-two family libraries of the 'City of 333 Saints{{'"}}. He added, "Those are to this day protected."

Haidara purchased metal footlockers in which up to 300 manuscripts could be securely stored. Nearly 2,500 of these lockers were distributed to safe houses across the city. Many were later moved to Dreazen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Commisso|first=Corrie|date=2015-05-01|title=The Literary Refugees of Timbuktu: How a Group of Unlikely Allies Thwarted Al Qaeda and Organized One of the Most Brazen Cultural Heritage Evacuations Ever Attempted|journal=Preservation, Digital Technology & Culture|volume=44|issue=2|pages=69–77|doi=10.1515/pdtc-2015-0012|s2cid=133065754}}</ref>

==Language==
Although French is Mali's [[official language]], today the large majority of Timbuktu's inhabitants speaks [[Koyra Chiini language|Koyra Chiini]], a [[Songhay language]] that also functions as the [[lingua franca]]. Before the 1990–1994 [[Tuareg Rebellion (1990-1995)|Tuareg rebellion]], both [[Hassaniya]] Arabic and [[Tuareg languages|Tamashek]] were represented by 10% each to an 80% dominance of the Koyra Chiini language. With Tamashek spoken by both [[Ikelan]] and ethnic Tuaregs, its use declined with the expulsion of many Tuaregs following the rebellion, increasing the dominance of Koyra Chiini.{{sfn|Heath|1999|pp=4–5}}

[[Arabic language|Arabic]], introduced together with Islam during the 11th century, has mainly been the language of scholars and religion, comparable to [[Latin]] in [[Western Christianity]].<ref name="timeslibraries">{{Cite news |last=Forma |first=Aminatta |title=The Lost Libraries of Timbuktu |newspaper=The Sunday Times |location=London |date=7 February 2009 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5675598.ece |access-date=15 February 2011}}</ref> Although [[Bambara language|Bambara]] is spoken by the most numerous ethnic group in Mali, the [[Bambara people]], it is mainly confined to the south of the country. With an improving infrastructure granting Timbuktu access to larger cities in Mali's South, use of Bambara was increasing in the city at least until Azawad independence.{{sfn|Heath|1999|pp=4–5}} 

==Infrastructure==
With no railroads in Mali except for the [[Dakar-Niger Railway]] up to [[Koulikoro]], access to Timbuktu is by road, boat or, since 1961, aircraft.<ref>{{citation |last=Rosberg |first=Carl Gustav |title=Political Parties and National Integration in Tropical Africa |publisher=University of California Press |year=1964 |location=Berkeley, CA |page=222 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JpNYxFmTjC4C&pg=PA222 |isbn=9780520002531 }}</ref> With high water levels in the Niger from August to December, Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV) passenger ferries operate a leg between Koulikoro and downstream [[Gao]] on a roughly weekly basis. Also requiring high water are ''pinasses'' (large motorized [[pirogues]]), either [[charter]]ed or public, that travel up and down the river.<ref name=lpafrica>{{Cite book |last=Pitcher |first=Gemma |title=Africa |publisher=Lonely Planet Guides |year=2007 |location=Melbourne |pages=[https://archive.org/details/africaafri00pitc/page/403 403]–418 |url=https://archive.org/details/africaafri00pitc |url-access=registration |quote=timbuktu lonely planet. |isbn=9781741044829 }}</ref>

Both ferries and ''pinasses'' arrive at Korioumé, Timbuktu's port, which is linked to the city centre by an {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} paved road running through Kabara. In 2007, access to Timbuktu's traditional port, Kabara, was restored by a [[Libya]]n funded project that dredged the {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} silted canal connecting Kabara to an arm of the Niger River. COMANAV ferries and ''pinasses'' are now able to reach the port when the river is in full flood.<ref name="retour"/><ref name=autogenerated1>{{citation | title= Lancement des travaux du Canal de Tombouctou : la mamelle nourricière redonne vie et espoir à la 'Cité mystérieuse' |date=14 August 2006 | url=http://www.afribone.com/spip.php?article4208 | publisher=Afribone }}</ref>

Timbuktu is poorly connected to the Malian road network with only dirt roads to the neighbouring towns. Although the Niger River can be crossed by ferry at Korioumé, the roads south of the river are no better. However, a new paved road is under construction between [[Niono]] and Timbuktu running to the north of the [[Inland Niger Delta]].

==In popular culture==
From the perception of many Europeans and North Americans, Timbuktu is a place that bears with it a sense of mystery: a 2006 survey of 150 young [[British people|Britons]] found 34% did not believe the town existed, while the other 66% considered it "a mythical place", which means none of the sample believed it was real.<ref name=BBC_twin>{{citation | title = Search on for Timbuktu's twin | work =BBC News | date = 18 October 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6062360.stm | access-date =22 November 2010}}</ref> This sense has been acknowledged in literature describing African history and African-European relations. In popular Western culture, Timbuktu is also often considered a faraway place.<ref name="Pelizzo"/>{{sfn|Saad|1983}}<ref name=Prescott>{{Cite book |last=Barrows |first=David Prescott |title=Berbers and Blacks: Impressions of Morocco, Timbuktu and the Western Sudan |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location=Whitefish, Montana |year=1927 |page=10 }}</ref>

The origin of this mystification lies in the excitement brought to Europe by the legendary tales, especially those by [[Leo Africanus]] in his ''Description of Africa'': Arabic sources focused mainly on more affluent cities in the Timbuktu region, such as [[Gao]] and [[Walata]].{{sfn|Insoll|2004}} In West Africa the city holds an image that has been compared to Europe's view on [[Athens]].{{sfn|Saad|1983}} As such, the picture of the city as the [[epitome]] of distance and mystery is a European one.<ref name="Pelizzo"/>

Down-to-earth-aspects in Africanus' descriptions were largely ignored and stories of great riches served as a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] for travellers to visit the inaccessible city – with prominent French explorer [[René Caillié]] characterising Timbuktu as "a mass of ill-looking [[Adobe|houses built of earth]]".{{sfn|Caillié|1830| p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=u7xjAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA49 49 Vol. 2]}} Now opened up, many travellers acknowledged the unfitting description of an "African [[El Dorado]]".<ref name=benjaminsen>{{Cite journal |last1=Benjaminsen |first1=Tor A |last2=Berge |first2=Gunnvor  |title=Myths of Timbuktu: From African El Dorado to Desertification |journal=International Journal of Political Economy |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=31–59 |year=2004 |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/mesijpoec/v_3a34_3ay_3a2004_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a31-59.htm |access-date=14 September 2010|doi=10.1080/08911916.2004.11042915 |s2cid=152301812 }}</ref> This development shifted the city's reputation – from being fabled because of its gold to fabled because of its location and mystery. Being used in this sense since at least 1863, English dictionaries now cite Timbuktu as a [[metaphor]] for any faraway place.<ref>{{cite web | title = Entry on 'Timbuktu'| work=Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher=Douglas Harper| year = 2002 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=timbuktu&searchmode=none| access-date =17 September 2010 }}</ref>
