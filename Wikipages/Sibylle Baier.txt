'''Sibylle Baier''' (born 25 February 1955) is a German folk singer and actress, whose musical abilities achieved belated recognition with the 2006 release of the album ''[[Colour Green]]'', compiled from songs she had recorded in the early 1970s.

==Background==
Having played the guitar and piano as a young girl, she was moved to write her first song, "Remember The Day", after taking a road trip with a friend across [[Alps|the Alps]] to [[Genoa]], via [[Strasbourg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orangetwin.com/sibylle.html|title=Orange twin|website=Orangetwin.com|accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref>

She appeared in [[Wim Wenders]]'s 1973 film ''[[Alice in the Cities]]'', and her music is also featured in ''Umarmungen und andere Sachen'' (1975) and in Wenders'  ''[[Palermo Shooting]]'' (2008). Baier opted not to pursue an acting or singing career, and eventually moved to the United States, where she concentrated on bringing up a family.

The songs that made up her album ''Colour Green'' were home [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recordings]] Baier had made in Germany between 1970 and 1973.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sibylle Baier, "Colour Green" |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33301812/sibylle_baier/ |accessdate=27 June 2019 |work=The Boston Globe |date=17 December 2006 |location=Massachusetts, Boston |page=N 7|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> Some 30 years later, her son Robby compiled a CD from these recordings to give to family members as presents. He also gave a copy to [[Dinosaur Jr]]'s [[J Mascis]], who in turn passed it along to the [[Orange Twin Records|Orange Twin]] label. Orange Twin released the album in February 2006.

In April 2008, it was revealed through her official website that Baier was going into a recording studio and had written two new songs. The first of these, "Let Us Know", was released in September 2008 for the film ''[[Palermo Shooting]]''.
