'''The X-Ecutioners''' are a group of American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] [[DJ]]s/[[turntablism|turntablist]]s from [[New York City]], New York.<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|pages=434/5}}</ref> The group formed in 1989 and currently consists of three DJs, including Total Eclipse, DJ Boogie Blind, DJ Precision. Original members of the group included Mista Sinista, [[Rob Swift]], and [[Roc Raida]] (who died in September 2009).

==History==
the X-Ecutioners formed as a DJ crew in 1989<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/419458/x-ecutioners/biography|title=The X-ecutioners - Biography {{!}} Billboard|website=Billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-23}}</ref> that originally included 11 members. The group's original name was the X-Men named after the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero team]] which was chosen partly because of their rivalry between [[DJ Clark Kent]]'s crew of DJs, known as the Supermen, and after the [[DC Comics]]' [[Superman]]. They later changed their name for trademark reasons.<ref name="Larkin90"/>

After the group's name changed, the crew was later reduced to members [[Rob Swift]], [[Roc Raida]], [[DJ Total Eclipse|Total Eclipse]], and Mista Sinista (named after the X-Men villain [[Mister Sinister]]) before releasing their debut studio album, ''[[X-Pressions]]'' in 1997.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Sinista later left the group shortly after the release of their second studio album ''[[Built from Scratch]]'' in 2001.

the X-Ecutioners have worked with many famous artists on their albums ''Built from Scratch'' and ''[[Revolutions (The X-Ecutioners album)|Revolutions]]'' and are highly respected in hip hop for their turntable skills, being famous for the technique known as [[beat juggling]].<ref name="Larkin90"/> They have been known to do numerous collaborations, ranging from [[Kool G Rap]] to [[Cypress Hill]], [[Mike Shinoda]] and [[Joe Hahn]] of rock band [[Linkin Park]], and co-released a collaboration album with [[Mike Patton]] called ''[[General Patton vs. The X-Ecutioners]]''. The X-Ecutioners contributed a remix of [[Run-DMC]]'s "[[King of Rock]]" on the [[Harmonix]] game ''[[Amplitude (game)|Amplitude]]'', and the song "Like This" was featured in the [[video game]] ''[[SSX 3]]''. Their Music and themselves were also featured in the game, ''[[NFL Street]]''. As of 2007, Rob Swift, Total Eclipse and Precision have formed a new group called Ill Insanity. Their latest studio album release, ''[[Ground Xero]]'' contains 14 tracks featuring the likes of [[DJ QBert]], DJ Excess, and Grand Master Roc Raida. Ill Insanity has posted a blog on their Myspace regarding a reunion tour in Australia in October 2008. The group commented in their blog

"Undeniably one of the greatest turntablist crews of all time, New York's legends The X-Ecutioners are reuniting exclusively to tour Australia for the very first time. The supremely talented turntablists, Grandmaster Roc Raida, Rob Swift, Boogie Blind, Total Eclipse and Precision have exclusively come together for this tour and across 10 turntables will leave you speechless with their unbelievable turntable skills of cutting, mixing, scratching and beat juggling."

The group announced at 2008 the tour dates on both the X-Ecutioners' and Ill Insanity's Myspace Reunion Tour Blog.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=216285871&blogID=425876365 |title='&#39;Myspace Reunion Tour Blog'&#39; |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=2012-02-15 |access-date=2014-05-20 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215123754/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=216285871&blogID=425876365 |archive-date=2012-02-15 }}</ref> In a recent interview with E.Zee Radio,<ref>[http://www.blogtalkradio.com/E-ZEERADIO/2009/09/27/E-ZEE-RADIO-SHOW.mp3?localembed=download] {{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref> Mista Sinista says (2008) that the "current X-Men are Mista Sinista, Total Eclipse, Boogie Blind, Steve D, [[Sean C]], Johnny Cash, Diamond J, Exotic E and Roc Raida who will always be there."

Roc Raida died on September 19, 2009 from complications of a stroke from training in [[Krav Maga]].
