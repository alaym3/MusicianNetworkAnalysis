==Early life==
Yvette Marie Stevens was born on March 23, 1953 into an artistic, [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] household in [[Chicago]], Illinois. The eldest of five children born to Charles Stevens and Sandra Coleman, she has described her father as a [[beatnik]] and her mother as "able to do anything." She was raised in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] area, "an island in the middle of the madness" of Chicago's rough [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] [[Public housing in the United States|housing projects]].<ref name="BBC Gilles Peterson interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04jrlw7 |access-date=September 27, 2014|title = Words and Music with Chaka Khan|date = September 27, 2014|website = BBC 6 Music (Interview)|last = Peterson|first = Gilles}}</ref> Her sister Yvonne later became a successful musician in her own right under the name [[Taka Boom]]. Her only brother, Mark, who formed the funk group The [[Jamaica Boys]] and was a member of Aurra, also became a successful musician. She has two other sisters, Zaheva Stevens and Tammy McCrary.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451193/bio |title=Chaka Khan (I) |access-date=August 24, 2010|website = IMDb.com}}</ref>

Khan was raised as a [[Catholic]]. She attended the elementary school of Saint Thomas the Apostle Church<ref name="STA">{{cite web |url=https://stapostleparish.org/ |title=St. Thomas the Apostle Church |access-date=December 8, 2019|website = stapostleparish.org/}}</ref> in Hyde Park. She attributed her love of music to her grandmother, who introduced her to [[jazz]] as a child. Khan became a fan of [[rhythm and blues]] music as a [[preteen]] and at eleven formed a [[girl group]], the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several [[civil rights]] rallies with her father's second wife, Connie, a strong supporter of the movement, and joined the [[Black Panther Party]] after befriending a fellow member, activist and Chicago native [[Fred Hampton]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/chaka-khan.html |title=Chaka Khan – Biography on Bio |publisher=Thebiographychannel.co.uk |access-date=July 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303234445/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/chaka-khan.html |archive-date=March 3, 2012 }}</ref> Though many think that she was given the name Chaka while in the Panthers, she has made it clear that her name '''Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi''' was given to her at age 13 by a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] [[Babalawo|Baba]]. In 1969, she left the Panthers and dropped out of high school, having attended [[Calumet High School (Chicago)|Calumet High School]] and Kenwood High School (now [[Kenwood Academy]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsalumni.org/school/kenwood-academy-high-school |title=Kenwood Academy High School |publisher=CPSalumni.org |access-date=February 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210927/http://www.cpsalumni.org/school/kenwood-academy-high-school |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with [[Cash McCall (musician)|Cash McCall]]'s group Lyfe, which included her then-boyfriend Hassan Khan. Chaka and Hassan married in 1970.

She was asked to replace [[Baby Huey (singer)|Baby Huey]] of [[Baby Huey & the Babysitters]] after Huey's death in 1970. The group disbanded a year later. While performing in local bands in 1972, Khan was spotted by two members of a new group called [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] and soon won her position in the group (replacing [[rock n roll]] singer Paulette McWilliams). The group caught the attention of musician [[Ike Turner]] who flew them out to [[Los Angeles]] to record at his studio [[Bolic Sound]] in [[Inglewood, California]]. Turner wanted Khan to become an [[The Ikettes|Ikette]]; she declined stating she was "really happy with Rufus. But Ike's attention was certainly a boost."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Chaka!

==Career==

===1973–1978: Early career with Rufus===
{{main|Rufus (band)}}
In 1973, Rufus signed with [[ABC Records]] and released their [[Rufus (1973 album)|eponymous debut album]]. Despite their fiery rendition of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "Maybe Your Baby" from Wonder's acclaimed ''[[Talking Book]]'' and the modest success of the Chaka-led ballad "Whoever's Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)", the album failed to gain attention. That changed when Wonder himself collaborated with the group on a song he had written for Khan. That song, "[[Tell Me Something Good]]", became the group's breakthrough hit, reaching No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1974, later winning the group their first [[Grammy Award]]. The single's success and the subsequent follow-up, "[[You Got the Love (Rufus song)|You Got the Love]]", which peaked at No. 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and No. 1 on the R&B chart, helped their second parent album, ''[[Rags to Rufus]]'', go platinum, selling over a million copies. From 1974 to 1979, Rufus released six [[RIAA|platinum-selling]] albums including ''[[Rufusized]]'', ''[[Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan (album)|Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan]]'', ''[[Ask Rufus]]'', ''[[Street Player]]'' and ''[[Masterjam]]''. Hits the group scored during this time included "[[Once You Get Started]]," "[[Sweet Thing (Chaka Khan song)|Sweet Thing]]," "Hollywood," "[[At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)]]," and "[[Do You Love What You Feel]]."

The band gained a reputation as a live performing act, with Khan becoming the star attraction, thanks to her powerful vocals and stage [[attire]]—which sometimes included [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] garb and showing her midriff. Most of the band's material was written and produced by the band itself with few exceptions. Khan has also been noted for being an instrumentalist playing drums and bass; she also provided percussion during her tenure with Rufus. Most of her compositions were collaborations with guitarist Tony Maiden. Relations between Khan and the group, particularly between her and drummer Andre Fischer,{{Who|date=January 2018}} became stormy. Several members left with nearly every release. While Khan remained in the group, she signed a solo contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1978. While Khan was busy at work on solo material, Rufus released three albums without her participation including 1979's ''[[Numbers (Rufus album)|Numbers]]'', 1980's ''[[Party 'Til You're Broke]]'', and 1983's ''[[Seal in Red]]''.

===1978–1983: Early solo career and final years with Rufus===
In 1978, [[Warner Bros. Records]] released Khan's solo [[Chaka (1978 album)|debut album]], which featured the [[Crossover music|crossover]] [[disco]] hit, "[[I'm Every Woman]]", written for her by singers-songwriters [[Ashford & Simpson]]. The success of the single helped the album go platinum, selling over a million copies. Khan also featured on [[Quincy Jones]]'s hit "[[Stuff Like That]]," also released in 1978, which also featured Ashford & Simpson as co-writers, along with Jones and several others. Ashford & Simpson performed with Khan on the song.

In 1979, Khan reunited with Rufus to collaborate on the Jones-produced ''[[Masterjam]]'', which featured their hit "[[Do You Love What You Feel]]", which Khan sang with Tony Maiden. Despite her sometimes-acrimonious relationship with some of her bandmates, Khan and Maiden have maintained a friendship over the years. In 1979. she also [[duet]]ed with [[Ry Cooder]] on his album ''[[Bop Till You Drop]]''. That year, she spent time working on her producing and writing skills at Ike Turner's Bolic Sound studio. They had planned to record together.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|date=August 30, 1979|title=Chaka, Hubby Split; Not Talking Divorce|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEIDAAAAMBAJ&q=chaka+khan+ike+1979&pg=PA53|journal=Jet|pages=53}}</ref> In 1980, while Rufus released ''Party 'Til You're Broke'', again without Khan, she released her second solo album, ''[[Naughty (Chaka Khan album)|Naughty]]'', which featured her on the cover with her six-year-old daughter Milini. The album yielded the disco hit "Clouds" and the R&B [[ballad]] "Papillon".

Also in 1980, Khan had a [[cameo appearance]] as a [[church choir]] soloist in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' starring [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Khan released two albums in 1981, the Rufus release, ''[[Camouflage (Rufus album)|Camouflage]]'' and the solo album ''[[What Cha' Gonna Do for Me]]''. The latter album went gold. The same year, Khan appeared on three tracks on [[Rick Wakeman]]'s concept album ''[[1984 (Rick Wakeman album)|1984]]''. In 1982, Khan issued two more solo albums, the jazz-oriented ''[[Echoes of an Era]]'' and a more [[funk]]/pop-oriented self-titled album ''[[Chaka Khan (1982 album)|Chaka Khan]]''. The latter album's track, the jazz-inflected "Be Bop Medley", won Khan a Grammy and earned praise from jazz singer [[Betty Carter]] who loved Khan's vocal [[scatting]] in the song.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r10811|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Chaka Khan : Overview )))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1983, following the release of Rufus's final studio album, ''Seal in Red'', which did not feature Khan, the singer returned with Rufus on a live album, ''[[Stompin' at the Savoy - Live]]'', which featured the studio single, "[[Ain't Nobody]]", which became the group's final charting success reaching No. 22 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number-one on the Hot R&B chart, while also reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom. Following this release, Rufus separated for good.

===1984–1996: Solo success===
In 1984, Khan released her sixth studio album, ''[[I Feel for You (album)|I Feel for You]]''. The [[I Feel for You|title track]], the first single released, was originally written and recorded by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in 1979 and had also been recorded by [[The Pointer Sisters]] and [[Rebbie Jackson]]. Khan's version featured a harmonica solo by [[Stevie Wonder]] and an introductory [[rap]] by [[Grandmaster Melle Mel]]. It became a million-selling smash in the U.S. and United Kingdom and helped to relaunch Khan's career. "[[I Feel for You]]" topped not only the U.S. R&B and dance charts, but achieved great success on the U.S. pop chart and reached No. 1 in the U.K. The song reached No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in December 1984 and remained on that chart for 26 weeks, well into 1985. Additionally, it hit No. 1 on the [[Cash Box]] chart. It was listed as ''Billboard''′s No. 5 song for 1985 and netted Prince the 1985 [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song]]. In addition to the song's successful [[radio airplay]] and sales, a music video of Khan with [[breakdancer]]s in an inner-city setting enjoyed [[heavy rotation]] on television and helped to solidify Khan's notoriety in popular culture.

Other singles that helped the ''I Feel For You'' album go [[RIAA|platinum]] included "[[I Feel for You (album)|This is My Night]]" and the ballad "[[Through the Fire (song)|Through the Fire]]", the latter of which was also successful on the [[adult contemporary]] chart. Khan was featured in [[Steve Winwood]]'s 1986 number-one hit, "[[Higher Love]]". That same year, a [[duet]] was planned with [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] for the song "[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted To Love]]". However, her manager declined to release the duet, citing the desire not to have too much product from her in the marketplace at one time. She was still credited for the vocal arrangements in the album's [[liner notes]], and the song became an international hit.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wolf |first=Buck |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101024#.TrfT7LKwXAg |title=Robert Palmer Never Meant to Turn Us On – ABC News |work=ABC News |access-date=February 18, 2012}}</ref> Khan followed up the success of the ''I Feel For You'' album with 1986's ''[[Destiny (Chaka Khan album)|Destiny]]'' and 1988's ''[[CK (album)|CK]]''. Khan found more success in the late 1980s with a [[remix album]], ''[[Life Is a Dance: The Remix Project]]'', which reached the top ten on the British albums chart. As a result, she performed regularly in the U.K., where she maintained a strong [[fan base]].

In 1990, she was a featured performer on another major hit when she collaborated with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Quincy Jones]] on a [[new jack swing]] cover of [[The Brothers Johnson]]'s "[[I'll Be Good to You]]", which was featured on Jones's ''[[Back on the Block]]''. The song reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&B chart, later winning her and Ray Charles a Grammy for Best R&B Vocal Performance By a Duo or Group. Khan returned with her first studio album in four years in 1992 with the release of ''[[The Woman I Am]]'', which was a success due to the R&B songs "[[Love You All My Lifetime]]" and "You Can Make the Story Right".

Khan also contributed to soundtracks and worked on a follow-up to ''The Woman I Am'' she titled ''Dare You to Love Me'', which was eventually shelved. In 1995, she and rapper [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] had a hit with the duet "Watch What You Say", in the U.K. That same year, she provided a [[contemporary R&B]] cover of the classic [[Standard (music)|standard]], "[[My Funny Valentine]]", for the ''[[Waiting to Exhale (soundtrack)|Waiting to Exhale]]'' soundtrack. In 1996, following the release of her [[greatest-hits album]], ''[[Epiphany: The Best of Chaka Khan, Vol. 1]]'', Khan abruptly left Warner Bros. after stating the label had neglected her and failed to release ''Dare You to Love Me''.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/301491|title=Interview, thestar.com February 9, 2008|work=thestar.com|access-date=October 8, 2014|date=February 9, 2008}}</ref> 
[[File:Chaka Kahn 1996.jpg|thumb|upright|Chaka Khan in 1997]]

===1998–2016===

In 1998, Khan signed a contract with Prince's [[NPG Records]] label and issued ''[[Come 2 My House]]'', followed by the single "[[Don't Talk 2 Strangers]]", a cover of a 1996 [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] song. She later went on a [[Tour (music)|tour]] with Prince as a co-headlining act. In 2000, Khan departed NPG and she released her autobiography ''Chaka! Through The Fire'' in 2003.<ref name=":0" /> The following year she released her first jazz [[Cover (music)|cover]]s album in twenty-two years with 2004's ''[[ClassiKhan]]''. She also covered "[[Little Wing]]" with Kenny Olson on the album ''[[Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''. Three years later, after signing with [[Burgundy Records]], Khan released what many critics called a "comeback album" with ''[[Funk This]]'', produced by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] & Big Jim Wright. The album featured the hit, "Angel", and the [[Mary J. Blige]] duet, "Disrespectful". The latter track went to No. 1 on the U.S. dance singles chart, winning the singers a Grammy Award, while ''Funk This'' also won a Grammy for [[Best R&B Album]]. The album was also notable for Khan's covers of [[Dee Dee Warwick]]'s "Foolish Fool" and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[Sign o' the Times (song)|Sign o' the Times]]". In 2008, Khan participated in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] adaptation of ''[[The Color Purple (musical)|The Color Purple]]'' playing Ms. Sofia to [[Fantasia Barrino]]'s Celie.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/theater/30mcge.html?ex=1215061200&en=660d853e43d071cd&ei=5087&WT.mc_id=TH-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M010-ROS-0108-HDR&WT.mc_ev=click&mkt=TH-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M010-ROS-0108-HDR |title=The Many Shades of Chaka Khan, Now in 'Purple' |work=The New York Times |author=McGee, Celia |date=December 30, 2007 |access-date=January 9, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Chaka Khan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Khan performing in 2006]]
In a 2008 interview Khan said that she, unlike other artists, felt very optimistic about the current changes in the recording industry, including [[music downloading]]. "I'm glad things are shifting and artists – not labels – are having more control over their art. My previous big record company (Warner Bros.) has vaults of my recordings that haven't seen the light of day that people need to hear. This includes [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]'s original recording of '[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]' – which they took my vocals off of! We are working on getting it (and other tracks) all back now."<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 2009, Khan hit the road with singers [[Anastacia]] and [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] for [[Here Come the Girls (concert tour)|Here Come the Girls]].

In 2009, Khan was guest singer with the song "Alive"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKg-ZpXxwvc&feature=fvwrel | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/rKg-ZpXxwvc| archive-date=2021-10-30|title=CHAKA KHAN – BILLY COBHAM – GINO VANNELLI I – Drum 'n' voice vol.3 (produced by Nicolosi / Novecento) |access-date=June 4, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref> on jazz drummer [[Billy Cobham]]'s album ''Drum ' n voice 3''. In 2010, she contributed to vocals for [[Beverley Knight]]'s "[[Soul Survivor (Beverley Knight song)|Soul Survivor]]", collaborated with [[Clay Aiken]] on a song for the kids show ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', and appeared as a featured artist on "One More Try" and a cover of her song "[[Through the Fire (song)|Through the Fire]]" on Japanese-American singer-songwriter [[Ai (singer)|Ai]]'s eighth studio album ''[[The Last Ai]].'' Khan continues to perform to packed audiences both in her native United States and overseas.

On May 19, 2011, Khan was given the 2,440th [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star plaque on a section of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. Her family was present when the singer accepted the honor, as was [[Stevie Wonder]], who had written her breakout hit "[[Tell Me Something Good]]". On September 27, 2011, the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] committee announced that Khan and her former band [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] were jointly nominated for induction to the hall. It was the collective's first nomination 13 years after they were first eligible. The group were nominated partly due to Khan's own storied reputation, including her own solo career in conjunction with her years with Rufus. Recently, Khan rerecorded her song, "Super Life", under the title "Super Life: Fear Kills, Love Heals" with [[Eric Benet]], [[Kelly Price]], and [[Luke James (singer)|Luke James]] in tribute to [[Trayvon Martin]], a teenager who was killed on February 26. A number of celebrities also joined in the recording including [[Loretta Devine]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Eva Pigford]], and reporter [[Kevin Frazier]].

On December 6, 2012, Khan performed at a benefit for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

==Personal life==
Khan has been married twice and is the mother of two, daughter Indira Milini and son Damien Holland. Her first marriage was to Hassan Khan, in 1970, when she was 17, which ended in divorce a short time later. Milini's birth was the result of a relationship between Khan and Rahsaan Morris.<ref name="imdb" /> Khan married her second husband, Richard Holland, in 1976.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=September 2, 1976|title=Chaka Khan, Mexican Mate Marry In Quiet Ceremony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEIDAAAAMBAJ&q=chaka+khan+divorce+1976&pg=PA47|journal=Jet|pages=47}}</ref> The marriage reportedly caused a rift between Khan and several members of Rufus, in particular, Andre Fischer. Holland wanted her to tone down her sexy stage image, but she refused. Following their split in 1979, Khan spent time in the studio with [[Ike Turner]] who she said was a "real inspiration and a catalyst emotionally and in other ways as well" during that difficult time.<ref name=":1" /> Holland filed for divorce in 1980, citing "irreconcilable differences."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=February 21, 1980|title=Chaka's Husband Files For Divorce In L.

Following their separation, Khan moved to Europe, first settling in London, later buying a residence in Germany. She lived in Germany for a while "in a little village in the Rhine Valley" and also in [[Mannheim]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chaka Khan's Travelling Life|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/celebrity-interviews/Chaka-Khans-Travelling-Life/|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=April 23, 2016|date=July 3, 2015|last1=Kim|first1=Soo}}</ref>

In 2006, her son Damien Holland was accused of murder after 17-year-old Christopher Bailey was shot dead. Khan testified on her son's behalf. Holland claimed the shooting was an accident. He was acquitted in the criminal trial and found liable in the civil suit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/jerseyurbanmusic/2008/04/singer_chaka_khan_and_her.html|title=Chaka Khan, son ordered to pay $1.3 million in wrongful death lawsuit|first=Robert|last=Williams|date=April 29, 2008|website=Nj.com|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref> Though she sang at both the [[2000 Democratic National Convention|2000 Democratic]] and [[2000 Republican National Convention|Republican convention]]s, Khan says that she is more of a "Democratic-minded person".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046343|title=Chaka Khan Siding with the Democratic Ticket|date=November 6, 2006|author=Rosen, Craig}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
