She says that religious and witchcraft magic aesthetics are a huge part of her life saying "I feel like queer people are so drawn to [[Wicca]] and witchcraft because it's always been the alternative religion, it puts the power in yourself, and it's not historically been a religion that doesn't like queer people."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/zolita-solidifies-her-status-as-the-reigning-queen-of-witch-pop-with-her-debut-album/|title=Zolita solidifies her status as the reigning queen of witch-pop with her debut album|work=[[Gay Times]]|first=Sam|last=Damshenas|date=December 4, 2020|access-date=December 8, 2020}}</ref> She also cites [[Lady Gaga]] as her biggest influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/zolita-on-the-importance-of-being-a-feminist-lesbian-in-the-music-industry/|title=Zolita on the importance of being a "feminist lesbian" in the music industry|work=[[Gay Times]]|first=Sam|last=Damshenas|access-date=December 8, 2020}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Zolita is an open [[lesbian]], and she identifies herself as a [[feminist]]. She came out at an early age. In a 2017 interview she expressed how lucky she was for growing in a liberal family surrounded by open-minded friends. In her school days, she was afraid to come out to her female friends, saying "I was also worried that my female friends would no longer want to have girls' nights or sleepovers for fear that I might be attracted to them. So, I decided to keep my newfound queerness a secret."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/10/11/zolita-coming-out-owning-her-queerness-music|title=Zolita on Coming Out & Owning Her Queerness in Music|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|date=October 11, 2017|access-date=May 24, 2018}}</ref> She also identifies herself as a witch, she explains this in videos on her [[YouTube]] channel, but also in her music videos where witchcraft is incorporated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/118627/zolita-on-why-she-incorporates-witchcraft-into-her-music/|title=Zolita on why she incorporates witchcraft into her music|work=[[Gay Times]]|first=Sam|last=Damshenas|date=February 18, 2019|access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>
