(a line sampled from an episode of ''[[The Jamie Foxx Show]]''),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/05/pierre-bourne-producer-tag/|title=This Is Where Pierre Bourne's Producer Tag Comes From – XXL|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=March 25, 2018}}</ref> became a [[viral phenomenon]] and an [[internet meme]] leading the tag to become widely known and Bourne to break out as a producer.

== Early life ==
Jenks was born in [[Fort Riley, Kansas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://audiblwav.com/who-is-the-generational-sound-shaker-pierre-bourne/|title=Who is The Generational Sound Shaker Pi'erre Bourne|date=June 3, 2019|publisher=audiblwav}}</ref> but grew up in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] to a military family from [[Queens]], New York City. Growing up, he would spend his summers with his grandmother in Queens, which led to his interest in [[East Coast hip hop]] artists such as [[The Diplomats|Dipset]] and [[G-Unit]]. He is related to Mobile Malachi, a [[Belizean Creole|Belizean Kriol]] Reggae artist and musician.<ref name="fader" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/9437|title=Mobile Malachi|website=Channel5Belize}}</ref> He is also a cousin of [[Papoose (rapper)|Papoose]], who is of Liberian descent.<ref name="Vice">{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d37ajw/yo-pierre-bourne-is-out-of-here|title=Vice Interview|website=Vice}}</ref> Inspired by his uncle Dwight who was a rapper and graphic artist, Jenks first began making beats when he was in elementary school, using [[FL Studio]] on his uncle's computer.<ref name="Pierre" />

== Career ==
Jenks went to school for graphic design for a year before dropping out. At 18, his uncle encouraged him to pursue his career in music and Jenks moved to [[Atlanta]] to study sound engineering at the [[SAE Institute]].<ref name=fader /> While in school, he met and began collaborating with [[DJ Burn One]], who encouraged him to create his own instrumentals and not rely on samples. After graduating school, the studio where the two worked hired him as a full-time engineer. In 2015, Jenks began working for [[Epic Records]] as a sound engineer, leaving a year later to focus on his own career.

Jenks began producing for [[Young Nudy]] and [[Trippie Redd]] in 2016.<ref name="Vice" /> He met Playboi Carti in February 2017, collaborating on the track "[[Woke Up Like This]]" and produced most tracks on his debut project.<ref name=vice /> Their song "[[Magnolia (song)|Magnolia]]" peaked at 29 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This kickstarted Jenks' producing career, producing songs for [[21 Savage]], [[Trippie Redd]], [[Rich the Kid]], [[Lil Yachty]], [[Famous Dex]], [[Nav (rapper)|Nav]], [[Young Thug]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. Jenks has also released a series of mixtapes called ''The Life of Pi'erre'' and has his own imprint, SossHouse, at Interscope Records.<ref name=massappeal>{{cite web|url=https://massappeal.com/pierre-bourne-took-over-sound-2017-interview/|title=Mass Appeal|website=Mass Appeal}}</ref>
He produced Travis Scott's single "[[Watch (Travis Scott song)|Watch]]" which features [[Kanye West]] and Lil Uzi Vert. He also produced Playboi Carti's album ''[[Die Lit]]''. He also helped produce for Kanye West's albums [[Ye (album)|''Ye'']] and ''[[Jesus Is King]]''.

On May 8, 2019, Pi'erre Bourne and close collaborator [[Young Nudy]] released their collaborative mixtape titled ''[[Sli'merre]]''. The project, which consists of 12 songs, featured then-rising hip-hop stars [[DaBaby]] and [[Megan Thee Stallion]], along with Nudy's cousin and multi-platinum rapper [[21 Savage]], as well as fellow multi-platinum recording artist [[Lil Uzi Vert]]. All songs on the mixtape were produced by Pi'erre, and hit number 1 on [[Apple Music]]'s US All Genres chart, and debuted at number 167 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], later peaking at number 63 in the following week. On March 25, 2020, Jenks debuted at No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100 Producers chart, thanks to four production credits on the deluxe edition of [[Lil Uzi Vert]]'s second album, ''[[Eternal Atake]]''.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9342872/pierre-bourne-tops-hot-100-producers-chart-lil-uzi-vert-eternal-atake|title=Pi'erre Bourne Tops Hot 100 Producers Chart, Powered by Lil Uzi Vert's 'Eternal Atake'|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

with the song "[[Pain 1993]]", featuring Jenks' frequent collaborator Playboi Carti. The song would debut and peak in the top ten (at number 7) on the Hot 100 on May 16, 2020.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Drake – Chart History|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Drake/chart-history/HSI|url-status=live|access-date=June 10, 2021|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> On June 11, 2021, Jenks's second studio album, ''[[The Life of Pi'erre 5]]'', was released on [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] and SossHouse.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Life of Pi'erre 5 by Pi'erre Bourne|url=https://genius.com/albums/Pierre-bourne/The-life-of-pierre-5|access-date=June 18, 2021|website=Genius|language=en}}</ref>

== Artistry ==
Jenks is influenced by [[Wiz Khalifa]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Gucci Mane]], [[J Dilla]], [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Timbaland]] and [[Kanye West]].<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/06/30/pierre-bourne-beat-construction-interview-magnolia|title=Meet Pi'erre Bourne, The "Magnolia" Producer Who Always Trusts His Gut'|publisher=FADER}}</ref> Like West, Jenks wants to continue to work as a producer, while pursuing his own rap career.<ref name=fader /> Alphonse Pierre of ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' described Bourne's productions as "beats that pair airy video-game melodies with classic trap drums".<ref name="Pitch">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/pierre-bournes-10-best-beats/amp/|title=Pi'erre Bourne's 10 Best Beats|work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|last=Pierre|first=Alphonse|date=April 27, 2020|access-date=June 20, 2020}}</ref> His beats typically feature [[synth pads]] and [[flute]] sounds alternating between 2 or 3 chords.
