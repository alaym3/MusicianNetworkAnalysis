==Biography==
Loewe was born in [[Berlin]], Germany, to [[Vienna|Viennese]] parents Edmund and Rosa Loewe. His father was a noted [[Jewish]] [[operetta]] star who performed throughout Europe and in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]; he starred as Count Danilo in the 1906 Berlin production of ''[[The Merry Widow]]''.<ref name="Lees2005-12">{{cite book|last=Lees|first=Gene|author-link=Gene Lees|title=The Musical Worlds of Lerner and Loewe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EujKPSbVOooC&pg=PA13|access-date=June 3, 2012|date=July 1, 2005|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-8040-3|pages=12–13}}</ref>

Loewe grew up in Berlin and attended a [[Prussia]]n cadet school from the age of five until he was thirteen. At an early age Loewe learned to play piano by ear and helped his father rehearse, and he began composing songs at age seven. He eventually attended a music conservatory in Berlin, one year behind virtuoso [[Claudio Arrau]], and studied with [[Ferruccio Busoni]] and [[Eugene d'Albert]]. He won the coveted Hollander Medal awarded by the school and gave performances as a concert pianist while still in Germany. At 13, he was the youngest piano soloist ever to appear with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].

In 1924, his father received an offer to appear in [[New York City]], and Loewe traveled there with him, determined to write for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This proved to be difficult, and he took other odd jobs, including cattle punching, gold mining and prize fighting.<ref name=Guardianobit>Green, Benny. "Frederick Loewe, a prince of musical comedy", ''The Guardian'', February 16, 1988, p. 33</ref> He eventually found work playing piano in German clubs in [[Yorkville, Manhattan|Yorkville]] and in movie theaters as the accompanist for silent films. In 1931, he married Ernestine Zerline. Childless, they divorced in 1957.<ref>{{cite news |title='Camelot' And 'My Fair Lady' Composer Frederick Loewe Dies At 86 |url=https://www.apnews.com/cc6eb9c406e314763ce27498d8559edf |access-date=December 2, 2018 |work=Associated Press |date=February 15, 1988}}</ref>

Loewe began to visit the [[Lambs Club]], a hangout for theater performers, producers, managers, and directors.

In 1956, Lerner and Loewe's ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' was produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Their adaptation of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', with the leads, Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, being played originally by [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Julie Andrews]], was a huge hit on Broadway and in [[London]]. The musical won the [[Tony Award for Best Musical]].<ref name=master/> [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] took notice and commissioned them to write the film musical ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958), which won nine [[Academy Award]]s, including Best Picture.<ref name=master/>

Their next Broadway musical was ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' in 1960.
