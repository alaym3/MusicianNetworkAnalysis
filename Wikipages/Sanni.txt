The '''Sanni''' ({{lang-ka|სანები}})  are mentioned by [[Strabo]] (1st century BC/1st century AD), [[Pliny the Elder]] (1st century AD) and [[Arrian]] (2nd century AD) as a people settling  near [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] (in today's [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Black Sea Region]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Pliny the Elder|title=Natural History|pages=Book VI, section IV|url=http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm|archivedate=2017-01-01}}</ref> 
In the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, their territory extended to the north-east until the river [[River Ophis|Ophis]], and covered both the littoral and the mountainous hinterland. Pliny grouped together the Sanni who lived in the region of Trebizond and the [[Heniochi]] as one single nation. 
He also mentions other Sanni, living further on the [[Colchis]] littoral, past the mouth of the [[Rioni River|Rioni]].

According to [[Theodoret|Theodoret of Cyrrus]] (5th century AD), the Sanni and [[Laz people|Lazi]] were two different tribes. In the first centuries AD, Sanni people living in the region of Trebizond  were paying tribute to the [[Roman Empire]]. However, they tried to avoid heavy direct taxation and later left the coastal areas for the  mountains. In the 6th century, Procopius still mentions them as living near the source of the Boasi (today the Chorokhi, or [[Çoruh River]]).

There have been various interpretations of the ethnonym in Georgian literature; 
some scholars, such as [[Simon Kaukhchishvili]], suggest that it is related to the name "chan" or its variants, long present in Greek mythological narratives about Colchis; others, among them [[Arnold Chikobava]], see it as derived from the name still given to [[Mingrelian people]] in the [[Svan language]] ''Zan'' (see also [[Zan language]]). 
In the opinion of S. Dzhanashia, ''San'' was indeed an endonym of ancient [[Colchians]], which later evolved into the forms ''Zan'' in the north of Colchis ([[Mingrelia]]) and ''Chan'' in the southern part (which would become [[Lazistan]]). 
The form ''Τζάνοι'' (''Chani'') can be found in Byzantine authors such as [[Procopius]], but ''Sanni'' can be found as recently as the 12th century. 
Today, ''Chani'' is still used as an ethnonym for the [[Laz people]].
