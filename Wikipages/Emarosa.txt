The band currently consists of founding member and lead guitarist ER White, as well as bass guitarist Robert Joffred, rhythm guitarist Matthew Marcellus and lead vocalist Bradley Walden.

Upon the band's formation, they released one [[extended play]] (EP) in 2007, titled ''This Is Your Way Out'', and shortly after, the group underwent significant line-up and sound changes, dropping their [[metalcore]] influence and leaning towards a more [[Rock music|rock]] sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/5850 |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202051515/http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/5850 |archive-date=December 2, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Birchmeier |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/emarosa-mn0001000177/biography |title=Emarosa &#124; Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=March 31, 2016}}</ref> The band released their debut studio album, ''[[Relativity (Emarosa album)|Relativity]]'' (2008), which featured vocalist [[Jonny Craig]] and rhythm guitarist Jonas Ladekjaer. Their eponymous [[Emarosa (album)|second studio album]] was released in June 2010, to critical acclaim, and was Craig's final album with the group.

Following Craig's departure, he was replaced by vocalist Bradley Walden. They released their third studio album, ''[[Versus (Emarosa album)|Versus]]'', on September 9, 2014, which peaked at No. 61 in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band signed to [[Hopeless Records]] and released their fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[131 (album)|131]]'' (2016) and ''[[Peach Club]]'' (2019). The group has undergone several line-up changes throughout its career, with lead guitarist ER White being the sole remaining founding member, and has gravitated towards a more [[pop rock]] sound, departing from their original [[post-hardcore]] and [[alternative rock]] sound.

==History==
===2006–07: Formation and ''This Is Your Way Out''===
Emarosa began with keyboardist Jordan Stewart, drummer Lukas Koszewski and guitarist ER White having the decision of either attending college, or staying in their hometown of Lexington, Kentucky to start a new band. Stewart stated that "There's too much of an itch to do this," regarding the band he helped start in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altpress.com/lowprofiles/196.htm |title=Home - Alternative Press |website=Altpress.com |date=April 25, 2006 |access-date=March 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818103413/http://www.altpress.com/lowprofiles/196.htm |archive-date=August 18, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The band origins date back to early high school, which was said by keyboardist Jordan Stewart on Indiestar.tv. Stewart states some of the members had been playing in high school before "taking it serious", referring to four of the original members on the current line-up (ER White, Will Sowers, Lukas Koszweski, Jordan Stewart).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiestar.tv |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118234841/http://indiestar.tv/ |archive-date=January 18, 2009 }}</ref> Emarosa, formed in 2006 as Corsets Are Cages, recorded a three-song demo during with vocalist Chris Roberts and rhythm guitarist Mike Bryant, however they left the band. The band recruited Chris Roetter and Madison Stolzer as replacements for the lost members and changed their name to Emarosa. They were signed to [[StandBy Records]] to record their 7 track EP ''This Is Your Way Out'', which included a re-recording of the demo of "Utah, But I'm Taller", renamed just "Utah". It was released on May 1, 2007, by StandBy Records through [[Rise Records]] because StandBy had no distribution at the time.

Shortly after the release of their debut EP, Chris Roetter and Madison Stolzer left the band. On November 19, 2007, [[Jonny Craig]], former [[Dance Gavin Dance]] vocalist, was officially announced as the new vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=279180 |title=Message |website=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=March 31, 2016}}</ref> Jordan Stewart (keyboardist) and Lukas Koszewski (drummer) were interviewed in which they referred to the problems regarding Jonny Craig and the transitions: "In the beginning it was pretty intense. We would receive rather nasty comments and messages on Myspace asking what happened to Chris and why Jonny was no longer with Dance Gavin Dance. Sometimes when we play, kids will think it is funny to throw in remarks about the change and how they liked the old stuff better. The time between us realizing Chris wasn't working out to the time Jonny joined was extremely short. But even with Chris in the band, it was already decided that our full-length wouldn't have as much screaming. We just kept writing the way we had been before parting ways with Chris."<ref name="Somethingpunk.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.somethingpunk.com/interviews.php?iID=61 |title=Somethingpunk.com |website=Somethingpunk.com |access-date=March 31, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410054155/http://www.somethingpunk.com/interviews.php?iID=61 |archive-date=April 10, 2016 }}</ref> Jonas Ladekjaer also joined the band as their new rhythm guitarist, forming their first solid line-up.

===2008–09: ''Relativity''===

{{Main article|Relativity (Emarosa album)}}

On January 26, 2008, Emarosa posted their first official song with Jonny Craig titled, "New Demo" (now known to be "Set It Off Like Napalm"). Two weeks later, the demo of "Pretend. Release. The Close." was put on their player. On May 3, three new post-production songs were added to the MySpace player and the name of the album, ''[[Relativity (Emarosa album)|Relativity]]'', was revealed. The album was released on July 8, 2008, and received high praise from critics and fans alike. The band embarked on a tour across Canada and the United States with [[Arise and Ruin]] and [[Dead and Divine]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Julien|first=Alexandre|date=September 19, 2009|title=The Zyphoid Process & Great White North|url=http://www.abridgedpause.com/thezyphoidprocess-greatwhitenorth|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229215625/http://www.abridgedpause.com/thezyphoidprocess-greatwhitenorth|archive-date=December 29, 2019|access-date=September 6, 2020|website=Abridged Pause Blog|language=en-US}}</ref>

In Emarosa's latest and first video interview with Indiestar, Craig stated that "Set It Off Like Napalm" and "Pretend Release the Close" were "about the life [Craig] was having, [his departure from] Dance Gavin Dance, and how much better [he] was feeling about being in this band [Emarosa]." They were written in one practice session and played live 2 days later. He also said that "Even Bad Men Love Their Mothers" was co-sang by his mother. [[Boyz II Men]] was also said to be one of Jonny Craig's main musical influences. Craig states that most of the instrumentals were already completed prior to joining Emarosa, in which Jordan Stewart (keyboardist) says five were completed, to be exact. [[Jerry Roush]], formerly of [[Sky Eats Airplane]] and [[Of Mice & Men (band)|Of Mice & Men]], makes an appearance stating he's the new screamer for Emarosa but is joking the entire interview.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiestar.tv/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118234841/http://indiestar.tv/ |archive-date=January 18, 2009 }}<</ref>

===2010–12: Self-titled second album and departure of Jonny Craig===

{{Main article|Emarosa (album)}}

Emarosa informed fans that they had begun recording material for their new album via their [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/EmarosaTV |title=Emarosa Isaband |publisher=YouTube |access-date=November 30, 2013}}</ref> On January 2, 2010, the band entered the studio to record their second studio album working with producer [[Brian McTernan]] who had contacted Emarosa previously with plans to record their second album. While recording the band posted updates for fans from the studio which can be seen on their Tumblr blog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emarosaband.tumblr.com/ |title=Emarosa |publisher=Emarosaband.tumblr.com |access-date=November 30, 2013}}</ref>

The album was released on June 29, 2010 through Rise Records and received a good amount of praise. In an interview with Punktastic, the band spoke about the overall sound of this album. "I remember during the recording process, ER and I talked a lot about wanting to do more folk/indie stuff for the next record. Really bare bones, mellow and raw." Shrednews said "Emarosa have taken this album to a higher level, with more complex and animated guitar riffs, and pounding drum beats that you will make you headbang without even realizing it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shrednews.com/emarosa-cd-rev/ |title=Emarosa – Self-Titled CD Review &#124; |publisher=Shrednews.com |date=July 7, 2010 |access-date=November 30, 2013}}</ref>

Craig stated that the band would be traveling to Portland after his solo tour to record a B-side for the self-titled album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge3tyB4vxKk |title=Emarosa Interview @ Warped Tour 2010 for MindEqualsBlown.net |publisher=YouTube |date=August 13, 2010 |access-date=November 30, 2013}}</ref>  He also stated that a version of "The Game Played Right" featuring Modsun would be released in.

While on tour, the band is known to occasionally play "Casablanca" with a guest vocalist. So far Cody Anderson (formerly of [[In Fear and Faith]]), Chris Roetter (of [[Like Moths to Flames]], formerly Emarosa and Agraceful, who actually wrote the song), [[Austin Carlile]], Jon Mess (of [[Dance Gavin Dance]]), Kyle Tamosaitis (formerly of [[Burden of a Day]]), Chris Moore, and [[Jerry Roush]] have performed this song alongside the band.

During the summer of 2010, Jonny Craig and Jon Mess both rejoined Dance Gavin Dance (of which they were original members). Although Craig had not announced his plans for his relationship with Emarosa, he concentrated on his work with Dance Gavin Dance whose new album ''[[Downtown Battle Mountain II]]'' was released March 8, 2011. In Craig's absence Emarosa picked up former [[Tides of Man]] touring vocalist, [[Tilian Pearson]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Karan|first=Tim|title=Exclusive: Jonny Craig checks into detox, scam victims to be reimbursed|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_jonny_craig_checks_into_detox_scam_victims_to_be_reimbursed/|publisher=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=March 12, 2011|date=February 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502052648/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_jonny_craig_checks_into_detox_scam_victims_to_be_reimbursed/|archive-date=May 2, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Huntington|first=Kyle|title=Emarosa Happenings|url=http://absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?s=e24f0e74d4c814fd15e9d25128fef63c&t=2193602|publisher=[[AbsolutePunk]]|access-date=March 12, 2011|date=February 27, 2011}}</ref>  On February 27, 2011, ''Alternative Press'' broke the news that Craig had turned himself into detox, stemming from reports of Twitter scams and from a longtime addiction.

On April 11, ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' announced that Craig had been kicked out of Emarosa. The band stated that "as of today, Jonny Craig is no longer a member of Emarosa. This decision has been a hard one to make, but we feel it is in the best interest for the band going forward." Tilian Pearson, formerly of Tides of Man, filled in for Craig for 2011 tour dates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Karan|first=Tim|title=Exclusive: Jonny Craig no longer in Emarosa|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_jonny_craig_no_longer_in_emarosa/|publisher=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=April 14, 2011|date=April 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414134431/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_jonny_craig_no_longer_in_emarosa/|archive-date=April 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ilvonen|first=Keagan|title=Is Anyone Surprised?|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2251811|publisher=[[AbsolutePunk]]|access-date=April 14, 2011|date=April 11, 2011}}</ref> According to an ''Alternative Press'' interview with the band, their ideal vocalist would not be like Craig tone wise.
