'''You, Me, and Everyone We Know''' is a rock band from Washington, D.C.<ref name="APR">{{cite web|url=http://altpress.com/apr/51.htm|last=Karan|first=Tim|title=You, Me, And Everyone We Know|work=Alternative Press|access-date=September 11, 2008}}</ref>  After a decade-plus of lineup changes and hiatuses, the moniker has become a vehicle for singer-songwriter Ben Liebsch.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Interview with You, Me, and Everyone We Know- 3/14/15|url=https://circlesandsoundwaves.com/post/115788000250/interview-with-you-me-and-everyone-we-know|access-date=2021-02-14|website=Circles & Soundwaves|language=en}}</ref>  The band has released eight EPs, one full-length album, and a live album.

==History==

The band formed in 2006 consisting of lead singer Ben Liebsch, guitarists Ryan Sherrill and Noel Milford, bassist Dan Lee, and drummer Paul Martinez.  You, Me, and Everyone We Know recorded their debut EP, ''[[Party for the Grown and Sexy]]'' with Trevor Simpson.  The album received mostly positive reviews, with ''The Daily Chorus'' calling the work "a beacon that proves there are still bands that really enjoy the music they create" and gave the album an 8/10. ''Die Shellsuit, Die!'' gave the album a 9/10 and called the band "one of the funniest, most cheery, cheekily upbeat, smile inducing, rock-out-tastic fun poppy melodic pop-punk bands out there right now. Ever."<ref name="TDC">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailychorus.com/rev.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1205948880&archive=&start_from=&ucat=6&|last=Taintor|first=David|title=You Me And Everyone We Know – ''Party for the Grown and Sexy''|work=The Daily Chorus|date=March 1, 2008|access-date=September 11, 2008}}</ref><ref name="DSD">{{cite web|url=http://www.dieshellsuit.co.uk/article_detail.asp?rID=1149|last=Davison|first=James|title=You Me And Everyone We Know – ''Party for the Grown and Sexy''|work=Die Shellsuit, Die!|access-date=September 11, 2008}}</ref>

While on tour with The Dear Hunter and Lydia,<ref name=":0" /> during August 2008, the band's van caught fire in South Carolina, along Route 85. With most of the band's possessions destroyed, Aaron Stern recalled the conversation prior to the fire, "We were actually mid-argument about releasing new music on our own when the tire initially blew. After we watched the van burn up, we kind of took it as a sign to get our tails in the studio."<ref name=":1" />

The resulting effort was the EP ''So Young, So Insane'' produced by [[Motion City Soundtrack]]'s Joshua Cain.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joshua Cain|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/438800-Joshua-Cain|access-date=2021-02-14|website=Discogs|language=en}}</ref>  Shortly before the record was recorded, guitarist Ryan Sherrill and bassist Mike O'Rouke left the band.<ref>{{Cite web|title=You, Me, And Everyone We Know - So Young, So Insane FLAC album|url=https://havanas.ee/You-Me/So-Young-Insane/53832|access-date=2021-02-14|website=FLAC albums download - havanas.ee|language=en-us}}</ref>  The record was very well received, and marked the band's first collaboration with [[Max Bemis]], who provided additional vocals on ''I Can Get Back Up Now''.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Reid|first=Sean|title=Album Review: You, Me and Everyone We Know - Some Things Just Don't Wash Out|url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2010/10/album-review-you-me-and-everyone-we.html|access-date=2021-02-14}}</ref>  In support of the new EP, You, Me, and Everyone We Know toured with Sing It Loud and Take Cover, finishing the year on a full US tour with I Set My Friends On Fire.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-09-25|title=MySpace|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925005009/http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=bandprofile.listAllShows&friendid=59703803&n=you,+me,+and+everyone+we+know|access-date=2021-02-14|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>

You, Me, And Everyone We Know suffered a nearly fatal mass exodus, leaving only Liebsch in early 2009. Liebsch and Vigil later recruited guitarist Augustine Rampolla to join the band, along with a varying cast of guitarists, bassists and drummers over the next two years.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Express|title=Against the Odds: You, Me & Everyone We Know, 'Some Things Don't Wash Out,' at Jammin Java|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2010/12/06/you-me-everyone-we-know-jammin-java/|access-date=2021-02-14|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>  The rest of 2009 brought tours with Valencia and Houston Calls, a supporting slot on Forgive Durden's Razia's Shadow Tour, and another stint on Warped Tour.<ref>{{Cite web|last=AltPress|date=2009-03-20|title=Forgive Durden / You, Me, And Everyone We Know / Anarbor to tour|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/archive_6320/|access-date=2021-02-14|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=2009-06-01|title=you, me, and everyone we know on MySpace Music - Free Streaming MP3s, Pictures & Music Downloads|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601035306/http://www.myspace.com/youmeandeveryoneweknow|access-date=2021-02-14|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  They were also given a place on Alternative Press' 100 Bands You Need To Know In 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mckinstry|first=Lee|date=2015-03-30|title=300 Bands We Told You So—The best of AP’s "100 Bands You Need To Know" special|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/300_bands_we_told_you_sothe_best_of_aps_100_bands_you_need_to_know_special/|access-date=2021-02-14|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

After a spring headlining tour in 2010 with Breathe Carolina, We Are The In Crowd, and Stay, the band released their first single, ''Some Things Don't Wash Out,'' from their upcoming debut full-length of the same title in June.<ref name="deadpress.co.uk">{{Cite web|date=2010-10-15|title=ALBUM: You, Me And Everyone We Know - Some Things Don't Wash Out|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/album-you-me-and-everyone-we-know-some-things-dont-wash-out/|access-date=2021-02-14|website=DEAD PRESS! {{!}} It's more than "just music" to us|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Concert Archives - Breathe Carolina|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/breathe-electric?page=3|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> Dates with Hit The Lights, Cartel,<ref name=":2" /> The Bigger Lights, and The Graduate followed.<ref name=":0" />  In September, You, Me, And Everyone We Know headlined the Can We Do Laundry At Your House Tour with Take Cover and Queens Club.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Queens Club touring with You, Me + Everyone We Know|url=https://hmmagazine.com/queens-club-touring-with-you-me-everyone-we-know/|access-date=2021-02-14|website=HM Magazine|language=en}}</ref>

After nearly three years of writing, on October 12, 2010, Some Things Don't Wash Out was released by Doghouse Records, now the band's label, to overwhelmingly positive reviews.<ref name=":3" />  Dead Press gave it 7/10 stars, and Alternative Press gave it 3.5/5 stars calling 'the disk diverse: One minute the group are awash in big-band swing, the next they're entrenched in bursting pop-punk."<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Amazon - Some Things Don't Wash Out|url=https://www.amazon.com/Some-Things-Dont-Wash-Out/dp/B003VC8TZ2|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref><ref name="deadpress.co.uk"/>  In support of the album, the band played dates with acts such as Man Overboard, Sparks the Rescue, I Can Make A Mess Like Nobody's Business, and Hellogoodbye.<ref name=":2" />

On April 20th, 2011 You Me, and Everyone We Know announced they would be breaking up in a post by all members of the band, save Liebsch, saying "that it recently came to light that Ben had made some decisions that directly affected us as people and to the band as an entity throughout its existence, and we just felt these issues coming to light were irreparable for us, making it a situation where we couldn’t imagine getting back in the van or writing a song with him.”<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Heisel|first=Scott|date=2011-04-20|title=You, Me, And Everyone We Know break up|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/you_me_and_everyone_we_know_break_up/|access-date=2021-02-15|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

This press release was followed by a statement from Liebsch, in which he apologies to “everyone I’ve let down with my actions that led to this news.” He also implies alcoholism as a reason for the band’s splits saying, “I’m going to focus on staying sober and getting some help fixing the parts of me that make such bad decisions."<ref name=":4" />

In a follow up post via Tumblr, Liebsch admits that “[f]or almost 4 years I’ve used the band’s money to enable my drinking.” Controversy ensued after former guitarist Augustine Rampolla responded with a post of his own claiming Liebsch “was NOT an alcoholic and did NOT have a drinking problem," that he was a "pathological liar," and that Liebsch had stolen money from the band on a much larger scale than he admitted.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-04-27|title=Alt Press {{!}} News {{!}} You, Me, And Everyone We Know guitarist calls frontman "a pathological liar"|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427215104/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/ben_liebsch_releases_statement_about_you_me_and_everyone_we_know|access-date=2021-02-15|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=maddo|title=You, Me, And Everyone We Know members comment on break up {{!}} News|url=https://killyourstereo.com/news/981299/you-me-and-everyone-we-know-members-comment-on-break-up/|access-date=2021-02-15|website=Killyourstereo.com|language=en-AU}}</ref>

In November 2012, Liebsch, continuing as You, Me, and Everyone We Know, released a new EP, ''A'' ''Great Big Hole,''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kraus|first=Brian|date=2012-11-27|title=You, Me, And Everyone We Know stream new EP, 'A Great Big Hole'|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/you_me_and_everyone_we_know_stream_new_ep_a_great_big_hole/|access-date=2021-02-15|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref> leading to a headlining tour in the spring of 2013 supported by Squid the Whale and The Orphan, The Poet, where Liebsch played guitar and sang without a full band behind him.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kraus|first=Brian|date=2013-04-12|title=You, Me, And Everyone We Know, Squid The Whale, The Orphan, The Poet announce tour|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/you_me_and_everyone_we_know_squid_the_whale_the_orphan_the_poet_announce_to/|access-date=2021-02-15|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>  Another solo EP, ''I Wish More People Gave A Shit'', was released days before the tour was scheduled to begin.

In support of the record the band would embark on tour with Have Mercy and Weatherbox, followed by the Rather Be Dead Than Cool Tour with Forever Came Calling, and Like Pacific, among others.<ref name=":2" />

In March 2016, Ben Liebsch announced: “After a decade of ups and downs, I have decided to put this band to rest,” along with announcement of a goodbye show in Philadelphia at Creep Records.<ref>{{Cite web|last=AltPress|date=2016-03-10|title=You, Me And Everyone We Know announce breakup|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/you_me_and_everyone_we_know_announce_breakup/|access-date=2021-02-15|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2019, Liebsch released a new song, ''(Still) Basically A God'', marking the band’s return from their 2016 hiatus.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Smith-Engelhardt|first=Joe|date=2019-11-07|title=You, Me, And Everyone We Know drop first new music since 2016 breakup|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/you-me-and-everyone-we-know-new-music-2019/|access-date=2021-02-15|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

In an Alternative Press interview in November 2019, Liebsch opened up about his mental health issues caused by childhood trauma, and how stress and unhealthy living lead to the band’s 2016 hiatus. He also detailed a new approach to You, Me, and Everyone We Know including avoiding touring “unless someone comes to the band with an offer [that] replaces all of our incomes. The music industry has been historically unwilling to do that for any band, let alone my little enterprise here.” He added “I’m opening to all things except for becoming unwell mentally again.”<ref>{{Cite web|last=Shotwell|first=James|date=2019-11-21|title=You, Me, And Everyone We Know open up on their unlikely return|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/you-me-and-everyone-we-know-reunite-interview/|access-date=2021-02-15|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2020, coming up on ten years of sobriety, during another AltPress interview, Liebsch announced the release of the new single F.I.N.E. while discussing the band’s future: “The general idea has been figuring out how to do this sustainably and in a way that creates a little more freedom for us and me. We’re working on one or two songs at a time and releasing them on a quarterly basis.
