As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], he represented the United States at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], winning a silver medal in the light middleweight division after one of the most controversial decisions in boxing history.<ref name="times" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000593825&danrak_no=&clss_cd=&top_menu_cd=0000000808|title=Olympic Triumph!|access-date=5 May 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125045144/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000593825&danrak_no=&clss_cd=&top_menu_cd=0000000808|archive-date=25 January 2008}}</ref>

Jones is considered by many to be one of the best boxers of all time, [[pound for pound]], and left his mark in the sport's history when he won the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] heavyweight title in 2003, becoming the first former middleweight champion to win a heavyweight title in 106 years. In 1999 he became the [[Undisputed championship (boxing)|undisputed]] light heavyweight champion by unifying the WBA, [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] titles. During his prime, Jones was known for possessing exceptional hand speed, athleticism, movement and reflexes.

As of February 2018, Jones holds the record for the [[unified champion|most wins in unified light heavyweight title bouts]] in boxing history, at twelve. He is ranked by [[BoxRec]] as the 17th greatest [[pound-for-pound]] fighter of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxrec.com/en/ratings?r%5Brole%5D=proboxer&r%5Bsex%5D=M&r%5Bdivision%5D=&r%5Bcountry%5D=&r%5Bstance%5D=&r%5Bstatus%5D=&r_go=|title=BoxRec ratings: world, pound-for-pound, active and inactive|access-date=13 July 2020|publisher=BoxRec}}</ref> ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine named Jones the [[The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year|Fighter of the Year]] in 1994, and the World Boxing Hall of Fame named him the Fighter of the Year for 2003. He is also a three-time winner of the [[Best Boxer ESPY Award]] (1996, 2000, and 2003). The [[Boxing Writers Association of America]] named him as the [[Sugar Ray Robinson Award|Fighter of the Decade]] for the 1990s.

==Early years==
Roy Jones Jr. was born to a family with a boxing tradition. His father, Roy Jones Sr., a [[Vietnam War|Vietnam war]] veteran who was awarded a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for valor after he rescued another soldier, was also a [[middleweight]] boxer. Roy Jones Sr. fought [[Marvin Hagler]] on June 10, 1977<ref>{{cite book|first=Patrick|last=Myler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSDwAAAAMAAJ&q=Roy+Senior+fought+Marvin+Hagler|title=A Century of Boxing Greats: Inside the Ring with the Hundred Best Boxers|year=1998|page=182|isbn=9781861051349}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtWqMbialzYC&q=Sr+facing+Marvin+Hagler|title=Boxing|year=1997|page=194|isbn=9780789301062|last1=Delcourt|first1=Christian|last2=Aujard|first2=Richard}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Michael A.|last=Paré|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFJGqPL8AeEC&q=Hagler|title=Sports Stars|year=1996|volume=1|series=2|page=202|isbn=9780787608682}}</ref> (which happened to be Hagler's 36th pro fight,) on the undercard of the [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] vs. Vinnie DeBarros fight. Hagler knocked Jones Sr. out in the third round and received $1,500 to Leonard's $50,000.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/141078491/ Ringside Seat Costs $700 For Hagler-Leonard Bout], ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', April 5, 1987, 12H.</ref>

Jones did not lose a single round en route to the final. His quarterfinal match-up with Soviet boxer Yevgeni Zaytsev was the first U.S.–Soviet Olympic bout in 12 years (because each country had boycotted one Summer Olympics during that period). The final was met with controversy when Jones lost a 2–3 decision to South Korean fighter [[Park Si-Hun]] despite pummeling Park for three rounds, landing 86 punches to Park's 32.<ref name="query.nytimes.com"/> Reportedly, Park himself apologized to Jones afterward and the Italian referee Aldo Leoni, while raising Park's hand, told Jones that he was dumbstruck by the judges' decision, murmuring: "I can't believe they're doing this to you."<ref name="times">{{cite news |last=Vecsey |first=George |title=Nice Gesture Substitutes For Justice |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-nice-gesture-substitutes-for-justice.html |access-date=2020-08-15 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 26, 1997 |page=C1}}</ref> One judge shortly thereafter admitted the decision was a mistake and all three judges voting against Jones were eventually suspended. [[Marv Albert]], calling the bout on American television for NBC, reported that two judges from Communist countries, [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and the [[Soviet Union]], scored the bout in favor of Jones, while those from [[Morocco]] and [[Uruguay]] favored Park. The fifth judge, from [[Uganda]], scored the bout as a draw, leaving the outcome to be decided on other criteria.

An official [[IOC]] investigation ending in 1997 found that, although the offending judges had been wined and dined by South Korean organisers, there was no evidence of corruption in the boxing events in Seoul.<ref name="www.theguardian.com">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/feb/15/olympic-moments-roy-jones-jr | work=The Guardian | title=50 stunning Olympic moments No14: Roy Jones Jr cheated out of gold | first=John | last=Ashdown | date=2012-02-15}}</ref> Jones was awarded the [[Val Barker trophy]] as the best stylistic boxer of the 1988 games, which was only the third and to this day the last time in the competition's history when the award did not go to one of the gold medal winners.

==Professional career==

===Early years===
On turning professional, he had already sparred with many professional boxers, including [[North American Boxing Federation|NABF]] Champion Ronnie Essett, [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Champion [[Lindell Holmes]] and [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. Jones began as a professional on May 6, 1989, knocking out Ricky Randall in two rounds in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] at the Bayfront Auditorium. For his next fight, he faced the more experienced Stephan Johnson in [[Atlantic City]], beating him by a [[knockout]] in round eight.

Jones built a record of 15–0 with 15 knockouts before stepping up in class to meet former World [[Welterweight]] Champion [[Jorge Vaca]] in a [[Pay Per View]] fight on January 10, 1992. He knocked Vaca out in round one to reach 16 knockout wins in a row. After one more KO, Jones went the distance for the first time against future world champion [[Jorge Castro (boxer)|Jorge Castro]], winning a 10-round decision in front of a [[USA Network]] national audience.

===Middleweight champion===

====Roy Jones vs. Bernard Hopkins====
Jones made his first attempt at a world title on May 22, 1993. He beat future Undisputed [[middleweight]] champion [[Bernard Hopkins]] by unanimous decision in Washington, D.C. to capture the [[List of IBF world champions|IBF middleweight championship]]. Jones was ahead on all three judges' scorecards (116-112 three times). Jones landed 206 of 594 punches (35%) and Hopkins connected on 153 of 670 (23%).<ref>{{Citation|last=TheProdigy|title=Bernard Hopkins Vs Roy Jones Jr. I full fight|date=2014-06-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE3t6BBgVpE|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref> Jones claimed he had entered the bout with a broken right hand, but still managed to outpoint Hopkins and secure a unanimous decision win. Jones reminded the world of this claim on his hit single "Ya'll Must've Forgot" later in his career.

For his next fight, he fought another future world champion, [[Thulani Malinga|Thulane "Sugar Boy" Malinga]], in a non-title affair. Jones beat Malinga by knockout in six rounds. Jones finished the year with another win, beating Fermin Chirino by decision. In 1994, Jones beat Danny "Popeye" Garcia by knockout in six, then retained his IBF title against [[Thomas Tate (boxer)|Thomas Tate]] in two rounds at [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on May 27.

===Super middleweight champion===

====Roy Jones vs. James Toney====
{{Main|James Toney vs. Roy Jones Jr.|Roy Jones Jr. vs. Vinny Pazienza}}
On November 18, 1994, Jones was set to face undefeated IBF [[Super Middleweight|super middleweight]] Champion [[James Toney]], who was ranked highly in the "pound for pound" rankings. Toney was undefeated after 46 bouts and was rated the best in the world at 168&nbsp;lbs. Billed as "The Uncivil War", Toney vs. Jones was heavily hyped and on PPV. Jones, for the first time in his career, was the underdog.

Over the course of the 12-round unanimous decision, Jones demonstrated his greatness. He danced circles around Toney, utilizing his speed and athleticism to dictate the action, and landing quick combinations whenever Toney pressured him. Jones scored a flash knockdown in the third round with a leaping left hook after goading Toney by imitating a fighting cock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/12/boxing-sportinterviews|title=Jones goes off the script|website=guardian.com|date=11 October 2008|access-date=2016-10-20}}</ref> Ring magazine called Jones' performance the most dominant of any big fight in 20 years. Jones landed 285 of 614 punches (46%) and Toney connected on 157 of 451 (35%). Jones was ahead on all three judges scorecards (117-110, 119-108 & 118-109). The fight generated 300,000 pay-per-view buys.<ref>{{Citation|last=SeeCaBoxing|title=Roy Jones Jr vs James Toney (Full Fight)|date=2013-02-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WFNxRhldoQ|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/on-this-day-roy-jones-dominates-james-toney-in-super-middleweight-masterclass/|title=On This Day: Roy Jones dominates James Toney in super-middleweight masterclass - Boxing News|date=2016-11-18|newspaper=Boxing News|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-US}}</ref>

====Miscellaneous defenses====
In 1995, Jones defended his super middleweight title successfully multiple times. He began the year by knocking out IBF #1 Antoine Byrd in round one. This was the first time a championship fight took place at Pensacola. In a fight billed as '''The Devil & Mr Jones''<nowiki/>', he faced former IBF [[lightweight]] Champion [[Vinny Pazienza]] and defeated him in round six, after knocking down Pazienza three times. In the fourth round, Jones became the first fighter in CompuBox history to go an entire round without being hit by his opponent. Pazienza was credited with throwing five punches and landing zero. Pazienza was guaranteed $1.35 million, while Jones, who worked off percentages of the gate and the pay-per-view revenue, was guaranteed at least $2 million.<ref>{{Citation|last=Ritchie .T A|title=Roy Jones Junior vs Vinny Pazienza - IBF Super Middleweight Title Fight|date=2013-08-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLcYb3o6buE|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fightsaga.com/Fights/item/933-Jones-vs-Pazienza|title=Jones vs Pazienza|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2007/10/26/91435/864|title=Bad Left Hook Retro: Roy Jones, Jr. v.

In 1996, Jones maintained his winning ways, defeating Merqui Sosa by knockout in two and future world champion [[Eric Lucas]] in round 11.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://basementgymboxing.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/merqui-sosa-attacks-referee-while-roy.html|title=Merqui Sosa Attacks Referee While Roy Jones Junior Celebrates: GIF Spotlight|website=basementgymboxing.blogspot.co.uk|date=4 June 2014|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref> When he boxed Lucas, he became the first athlete to participate in two paid sports events on the same day. He had played a basketball game in the morning and defended his boxing title in Jacksonville, Florida that evening. He also held a press conference in the ring just before his 3rd bout of the year, taking questions from a chair in the middle of the ring and defending his choice of Bryant Brannon as his opponent instead of [[Frankie Liles]], his nemesis from the amateurs. He then defeated Bryant Brannon in a round two TKO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-khWAAAAIBAJ&pg=5685,4407931&dq=roy+jones+eric+lucas&hl=en|title=Eugene Register-Guard - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=LIFEBOXINGNETvideos|title=1996 06 15 Roy Jones Jr vs Eric Lucas|date=2013-02-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sty4TVaYJVw|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fightsaga.com/boxing-videos/item/3202-Roy-Jones-Jr-vs-Bryant-Brannon-(1996)-Facts,-Stats-Highlights|title=Roy Jones Jr vs Bryant Brannon (1996) {{!}} Facts, Stats & Highlights|last=zpmgifqson|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-gb}}</ref>

===Light heavyweight champion===

====Roy Jones vs Mike McCallum====
{{Main|Roy Jones Jr. vs. Mike McCallum}}
In November 1996 at [[Ice Palace (Tampa arena)|Ice Palace]], [[Tampa, Florida]], Jones defeated 40-year-old former three-weight world champion [[Mike McCallum]] via a shutout decision (120-107, 3 times) before a crowd of 12,000, to win the vacant [[Interim champion|Interim]] [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[Light Heavyweight]] title. Jones scored a knockdown just before the bell at the end of round 10. Jones landed 254 of 535 punches (47%) throughout the 12 rounds and McCallum connected on 209 of 651 (32%) Jones was soon upgraded to full champion by the WBC when former titlist [[Fabrice Tiozzo]] moved up to cruiserweight. Jones made $2.8 million from the fight and McCallum got $750,000.<ref>{{Citation|last=FameKillusion|title=Roy Jones Jr vs Mike McCallum 34th of 60+|date=2012-01-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoNFacF-x8s|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxing.com/roy_jones_jr_vs_mike_mccallum.html|title=Roy Jones Jr. vs. Mike McCallum - Boxing.com|website=www.boxing.com|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/23/sports/jones-jr-wins-wbc-title.html|title=Jones Jr. Wins W.B.C.

====Roy Jones vs. Montell Griffin I & II====
{{Main|Roy Jones Jr. vs. Montell Griffin|Montell Griffin vs. Roy Jones Jr. II}}
In 1997 Jones had his first professional loss, a disqualification against [[Montell Griffin]] (26-0, 18 KOs) at the Taj Majal Hotel & Casino in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Griffin was trained by the legendary [[Eddie Futch]], who had taught him how to take advantage of Jones technical mistakes and lack of basic boxing fundamentals. Griffin jumped out to an early lead on Jones but by round 9 Jones was ahead on the scorecards by a point and had Griffin on the canvas early in round nine. But as Griffin took a knee on the canvas to avoid further punishment, Jones hit him twice. Subsequently, Jones was disqualified and lost his title. At the time of disqualification, Jones was ahead on two of the judges scorecards (75-76, 77-75, 76-75).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/jones-dq-title-griffin-article-1.764629|title=JONES DQ GIVES TITLE TO GRIFFIN|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://roundbyroundboxing.com/flashback-friday-roy-jones-jr-vs-montell-griffin-could-lightning-strike-twice/|title=Flashback Friday: Roy Jones Jr. vs. Montell Griffin – Could Lightning Strike Twice?|website=roundbyroundboxing.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

Jones sought an immediate rematch five months later at [[Foxwoods Resort Casino|Foxwoods Resort]], [[Connecticut]], USA and regained the World Light Heavyweight title easily, knocking Griffin down within the first 20 seconds of the fight, then ending the fight by knocking Griffin out 2 minutes and 31 seconds in with a leaping left hand shot. The fight took place in a bingo hall before a sellout crowd of 4,500. Both Jones and Griffin earned a $1.5 million purse.<ref>{{Citation|last=DSINsomnia|title=1997 Roy Jones Jr vs Montell Griffin 2|date=2010-08-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCr_igXBWRk|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=27k8AAAAIBAJ&pg=3640,4701277&dq=roy+jones+montell+griffin&hl=en|title=Reading Eagle - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dRRJAAAAIBAJ&pg=1810,1011123&dq=roy+jones+montell+griffin&hl=en|title=The Hour - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

Jones began 1999 by knocking out the WBC number one ranked contender at the time, Rick Frazier. On June 5 of that year, Jones beat IBF champion [[Reggie Johnson (boxer)|Reggie Johnson]] by a lopsided 12-round decision to become the [[Undisputed championship (boxing)|undisputed]] light heavyweight champion, as well as the first to unify the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles at that weight since [[Michael Spinks]] in 1983. Jones dropped Johnson in the first round and hard in the third round, but backed off and allowed Reggie to finish the fight.

The year 2000 began with Jones easily beating the hard-punching David Telesco via a 12-round decision on January 15, at [[Radio City Music Hall]] to retain his titles. Jones reportedly fractured his wrist a few weeks before this fight and fought almost exclusively one-handed. He entered the ring surrounded by the famous group of dancers, [[The Rockettes]]. His next fight was also a first time boxing event for a venue, as he traveled to [[Indianapolis]] and retained his title with an 11-round technical knockout over [[Richard Hall (boxer)|Richard Hall]] at the [[Conseco Fieldhouse]]. Jones ended 2000 with a 10-round stoppage of undefeated [[Eric Harding]] in New Orleans.<ref>{{Citation|last=FameKillusion|title=Roy Jones Jr vs Eric Harding 44th of 60+|date=2015-11-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd5wwSLG1vA|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

In 2001, Jones released ''[[Round One: The Album]]'', a [[hip hop music|rap]] CD. That year he retained the title against [[Derrick Harmon]] by a knockout in ten and against future world champion [[Julio César González]] of [[Mexico]] by a 12-round unanimous decision before a crowd of 20,409. The three judges scored it (119-106, 118-107, 119-106) all for Jones. Jones knocked Gonzalez down in rounds one, five and twelve and earned a $1.5 million purse. Jones landed 192 of 375 punches (51%) whilst Gonzalez connected on a very low 91 of 609 (15%).<ref>{{Citation|last=FameKillusion|title=Roy Jones Jr vs Julio Cesar Gonzalez 46th of 60+|date=2015-11-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCFTMp8pGio|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

In 2002, Jones retained his title by knocking out Australian boxer [[Glen Kelly (boxer)|Glen Kelly]] in seven rounds via knockout. Jones put both hands behind his back. As Kelly moved in behind a jab, Jones went over the jab with a right to the head. Kelly went down and was counted out. Jones landed 124 of 249 punches (50%) and Kelly connected on 42 of 171 (25%). Before this bout, Jones was controversially awarded [[List of The Ring world champions|''The Ring'']] Championship belt, despite [[Dariusz Michalczewski]] still being regarded as the [[Lineal championship|Lineal]] champion in the same weight class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lheavy.htm|title=The Cyber Boxing Zone|website=Cyberboxingzone.com|access-date=2015-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=HDBoxingKnockouts|title=Roy Jones Jr vs Glen Kelly 02.02.2002 HD|date=2015-06-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3ljICMuCP4|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

Jones then defeated future world champion, WBC #1 [[Clinton Woods]] by [[technical knockout]] before a crowd of 16,229. He performed a song from his CD during his ring entrance. The bout was stopped in round 6 after Woods' corner threw in the towel. Jones landed 140 of 300 punches (47%) and Woods connected on 39 of 166 (23%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxing.com/roy_jones_jr_vs_clinton_woods.html|title=Roy Jones Jr. vs. Clinton Woods - Boxing.com|website=www.boxing.com|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref><ref name="boxing247.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxing247.com/news/JonesvsWoods.php|title=Roy Jones Jr vs Clinton Woods: The "Majestic" Roy Jones Jr. / Roy Jones Jr. A Legend In His Own Mind|website=www.boxing247.com|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

====Roy Jones vs. Antonio Tarver III====
{{Main|Antonio Tarver vs. Roy Jones Jr. III}}
After almost a year away from the ring, focusing on training and working as an analyst for HBO Boxing, Jones scheduled a third fight with Antonio Tarver, on October 1, 2005, a sellout crowd of 20,895 at the [[St. Pete Times Forum]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], which aired on HBO PPV. For only the second time in his career, Jones was considered an underdog going into the fight.

Tarver won by unanimous decision (117–111, 116–112, 116–112) and had Jones out on his feet in the 12th round. Tarver landed 158 of 620 punches (25%) and Jones connected on 85 of 320 (27%). Despite being clearly behind from early in the contest, there was little urgency in either Jones' corner or his performance as he seemed content to make it to the end of the fight following his back-to-back knockout losses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/10/02/Sports/Tarver_stakes_his_cla.shtml|title=Tarver beats Jones again|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210210348/http://www.sptimes.com/2005/10/02/Sports/Tarver_stakes_his_cla.shtml|archive-date=2005-12-10|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2006-07-26-fathers-sons-trainers_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Fathers, sons take fighting beyond the ring|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

In the post-fight interview with ESPN's [[Brian Kenny (sportscaster)|Brian Kenny]], Jones said that he would like to fight again. He would welcome a fourth bout with Tarver or another duel with Johnson. The fighters earned in excess of $4 million apiece plus a share of pay-per-view revenues, with the fight generating 440,000 pay-per-view buys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2178473|title=Rafael: Tarver beats Jones again|date=2005-10-28|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref>

====Fallout with HBO====
[[File:Roy Jones, Jr. & Jim Lampley.jpg|thumb|Jones with co-commentator [[Jim Lampley]], 2010]]
After the loss in the third Tarver bout, Jones resumed his duties as a commentator for ''[[HBO World Championship Boxing]]'', calling the [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]]&ndash;[[Sharmba Mitchell]] fight on November 19, 2005, and the [[Jermain Taylor]]&ndash;[[Bernard Hopkins]] rematch on December 3, 2005. His return to the network was short-lived, as Jones was let go from his ringside analyst role in January 2006. HBO cited his reported lack of commitment to attending the network's production meetings.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

After [[Joe Calzaghe]]'s split from promoter [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]], it was officially announced that Roy Jones Jr. and Joe Calzaghe had reached an agreement to fight for ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' Light Heavyweight Championship in New York City at Madison Square Garden on September 20, 2008 on [[HBO|HBO PPV]]. However, Calzaghe claimed injury to his right hand in training, so the fight had to be postponed a couple of weeks, with November 8 being set as the new date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3500129|title=Calzaghe injures right wrist, calls off Jones fight|date=2008-07-22|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>

In the first round, Jones caught Calzaghe with an uppercut and knocked him down, as well as cutting the Welshman on the bridge of the nose. However, Jones failed to capitalize on the knock down. In the 2nd round Calzaghe began to control the action and dominated Jones throughout the remainder of the fight. As the fight progressed Jones absorbed more and more punishment and suffered a cut over his left eye. Jones' corner, who had never seen Roy cut before, didn't know how to properly handle the situation and blood covered the left side of his face. Ultimately, Jones lost by unanimous decision, winning only one round (10-8 in the first) on the 3 official judges cards. There was a crowd of 14,152.

Lacy had tried to pin Jones on the ropes throughout the fight, but Jones was unaffected by the tactic and seemed more worried about playing to the crowd than about Lacy's punches. There was a discussion in Lacy's corner after the ninth round about stopping it, but Lacy, convinced his team to give him another round. Jones landed 249 of 500 punches (50%) while Lacy connected on 104 of 429 (24%). Jones was ahead on all three judges scorecards at the time of stoppage (99-91, 100-89, 98-92).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=4402151|title=Jones cuts through Lacy in 10 rounds|date=2009-08-16|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/16/roy-jones-jeff-lacy-boxing|title=Roy Jones Jr sees off Jeff Lacy to retain light heavyweighttitle|date=2009-08-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

====Roy Jones vs. Danny Green====
{{Main|Danny Green vs. Roy Jones Jr.}}In December 2009, Roy Jones was set to face Australian boxer [[Danny Green (boxer)|Danny Green]] in [[Sydney, Australia]].

Jones was initially gracious in his humbling defeat, stating that "We don't make excuses, it was a great performance by Danny."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-12-02/green-stops-jones-jr-in-first-round/1167186 Green stops Jones Jr in first round], ABC article, 2009-12-03, Retrieved on 2014-03-15</ref> However, less than a month later, Jones would launch a formal complaint, accusing Green of using illegal hand wraps and demanding his loss be overturned, though the decision was upheld.<ref>[http://www.watoday.com.au/sport/jones-lodges-formal-complaint-against-danny-green-20091226-lfe3.html Jones lodges formal complaint against Danny Green], WA Today article, 2009-12-25, Retrieved on 2014-03-15</ref> Though Jones' rematch with Hopkins looked to be in trouble following Jones' loss, the two sides would officially come to an agreement in February 2010 for an April 3 bout.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=4878372 Jones, Hopkins to face off April 3], ESPN article, 2010-02-01, Retrieved on 2014-03-15</ref>

In February 2011, Vladimir Hryunov confirmed that negotiations were taking place for [[Denis Lebedev]] (21-1, 16 KOs) to fight Jones in Moscow.

Lebedev knocked Jones out with 2 seconds left in their 10-round bout. After round 9, the scorecards read (87–84, 85–86, 90–81). The controversy arose when Lebedev punched Jones, when it was, to some, clear that Jones was not responsive and was out on his feet. The final punch put Jones out cold on the canvas and he did not regain his senses for more than 5 minutes amid active medical help.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisis50.com/profiles/blog/show?id=784568%3ABlogPost%3A25073456&xg_source=activity&page=6|title=Roy Jones Jr Gets Brutally Knocked Out By Denis Lebedev In Russia|date=2011-05-21|publisher=ThisIs50.com|access-date=2014-04-26}}</ref> After the bout, Lebedev said that he had nothing to be sorry about.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lenta.ru/articles/2011/10/09/lebedev/|title=Спорт: Тренировочный день|publisher=Lenta.ru|access-date=2014-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/denis-lebedev-with-brutal-ko-roy-jones-tenth--39425|title=Denis Lebedev With Brutal KO of Roy Jones in The Tenth|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/photos-denis-lebedev-with-crushing-ko-roy-jones-jr--39430|title=Photos: Denis Lebedev With Crushing KO of Roy Jones Jr.|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-us}}</ref> Referee Steve Smoger was also accused of incompetence because he did not stop the fight even though Jones could no longer defend himself which led to Jones taking unnecessary damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2011/05/23/smoger/|title=Спорт: Рефери рассказал о нокауте Роя Джонса|publisher=Lenta.ru|access-date=2014-04-26}}</ref> In a statement following the fight, Smoger said, "I didn't stop the fight because there were only a matter of seconds remaining in the fight and it seemed that Roy was pretending, trying to trick his opponent.

==Personal life==
Jones was born in [[Pensacola, Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotboxingnews.com/biography/biojonesjr.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723003031/http://www.hotboxingnews.com/biography/biojonesjr.htm |archive-date=July 23, 2009 }}</ref> His mother, Carol, was warm and easy-going, whereas his father, Roy Sr., was much like a Marine Drill Instructor with respect to his son. A decorated Vietnam veteran, ex-club fighter and retired aircraft engineer who had taken up hog farming, Roy Sr. was harsh on his son from early on, taunting the child, "sparring" with him, enraging on him, yelling at him and abusing him, often for 20 minutes at a time. Roy Jr. lived in constant fear of his father's verbal and physical violence against him.<ref name=SI_1995>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Gary |date=1995-06-26 |title=One Tough Bird Roy Jones Jr., The Best Boxer Pound For Pound, Was Raised Under The Rules Of Cockfighting: Win Or Die |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/06/26/204194/one-tough-bird-roy-jones-jr-the-best-boxer-pound-for-pound-was-raised-under-the-rules-of-cockfighting-win-or-die# |journal=Sports Illustrated |location= New York|publisher= Time Inc.|access-date= 2015-04-05}}</ref>

Jones described his childhood in ''Sports Illustrated'': "After a while I didn't care about gettin' hurt or dyin' anymore. I was in pain all day, every day, I was so scared of my father. He'd pull up in his truck and start lookin' for something I'd done wrong. There was no escape, no excuse, no way out of nothin'. ... Getting' hurt or dyin' might've been better than the life I was livin'. ... Used to think about killin' myself anyway."<ref name="SI_1995" />

Roy Sr. ran his own boxing gym, to which he devoted all his available time and financial resources. He offered direction to numerous youths and steered many of them away from trouble. Roy Sr. did everything possible to expand the program and help more kids. But towards his own son he was merciless, driving Roy Jr. to the brink of exhaustion, screaming at him in front of all the other fighters and assaulting him."<ref name="SI_1995" />

Using his birds as an image for his own predicament, Jones said in the same ''Sports Illustrated'' piece: "I spent all my life in my dad's cage. I could never be 100 percent of who I am until I left it. But because of him, nothing bothers me. I'll never face anything stronger and harder than what I already have."<ref name="SI_1995" />

On August 19, 2015, Roy Jones Jr. met with [[Vladimir Putin]] in [[Sevastopol]], [[Crimea]], to ask for dual Russian-American citizenship. Jones stated that he often visited Russia for business activity, and a passport would avoid inconvenient rides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/50157|title=Meeting with Roy Jones|publisher=Kremlin.ru|date=August 19, 2015|access-date=August 22, 2015}}</ref> Jones was granted Russian citizenship on September 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kremlin.ru/acts/news/50271|script-title=ru:Подписан Указ о приёме в гражданство Российской Федерации|publisher=Kremlin.ru|date=September 12, 2015|access-date=September 12, 2015|language=ru}}</ref> For this, he was banned from entering [[Ukraine]].<ref>[http://www.unian.info/society/1608241-sbu-issues-entry-ban-against-140-russian-artists.html SBU issues entry ban against 140 Russian artists], [[UNIAN]] (5 November 2016)<br />[http://tass.com/world/910576 Ukraine's State Security Service bans 140 Russian cultural figures from entering country], [[TASS news agency]] (5 November 2016)</ref>

==Fighting style==
Jones was known for his unique and unorthodox fighting style that defied many of boxing's oldest traditions. His style relied heavily on his great hand speed, quickness, reflexes, ring IQ and knockout power which were often the deciding factors in most of his fights during his prime. He had such hand speed that he could often throw hooks in rapid succession. He was nicknamed "Captain Hook", because he would deliver four or five hooks in a row from different angles. But he would also mix it up with a variety of punches to keep his opponents guessing.

Jones' style often saw him with his hands down and relying on head movement to evade his opponent's punches. He used his cat-like reflexes to bob and weave, slip and counter his opponent. Jones was a master at this sort of style, and used this to his advantage by sticking his chin out to bait his opponents into hitting him, only to pull back and counter the off-balance opponent with his own punches.

He also rarely led with the jab and instead was known for leading with leaping left hooks or the right cross. Immediately after his second fight with Montell Griffin, Former [[heavyweight]] champion [[George Foreman]] remarked that Jones did not need a jab to setup his punches due to his extraordinary quickness and that he is probably the only boxer in history he could say that about. He also been quoted as saying that Jones, "hits like a heavyweight and moves like a [[lightweight]]."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Jones is also said to have integrated cockfighting into his boxing style, often using exaggerated feints to catch his opponents off-balance. He also had the ability to land punches from odd angles that his opponents failed to see and his unusual style was very difficult to adjust to for most opponents who often struggled to find sparring partners that could mimic his unique style. Boxer Montell Griffin, who faced Jones twice at 175&nbsp;lbs and sparred with [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] at 140&nbsp;lbs said, "Floyd was no comparison as far as speed. Roy was much faster."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1996, High Frequency Boxing's John DiMaio wrote "The early evidence points toward the real possibility that Jones is the greatest talent this sport has ever seen. His skill so dwarfs that of his nearest ranked opposition ... that providing competitive opponents is a more challenging dilemma than the fights themselves." The expert opinion of Boxing magazine's editor, Bert Sugar, is provided on Jones' website: "He possesses the fastest hands in boxing with lightning fast moves and explosive power in both hands." After Mike MacCallum lost the World Boxing Council light heavyweight crown to Roy Jones in a 1996 unanimous decision, he called Jones "the greatest fighter of all time."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
