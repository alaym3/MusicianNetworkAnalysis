''' Victory ''' is a German [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Hard rock music|hard rock]] [[Band (music)|band]] from [[Hanover]], most successful in the 1980s. With extensive tours and radio airplay, the band also made a breakthrough in [[North America]].

== History ==
===Emergence===
Victory was formed in 1984 from the remnants of the band Fargo. Bassist Peter Knorn, the two guitarists Tommy Newton and John Lockton and drummer Bernie Van de Graaf had all previously worked together in that band.  After originally working with singer Pedro Schemm, former [[Gary Moore]]- and [[Ted Nugent]]-singer [[Charlie Huhn]] became the band's singer. Recommended by [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]' guitarist Rudolph Schenker, the band sign a management deal with David Krebs (who managed, among others, [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] and [[Aerosmith]]).

===Taking Place===
A self-titled album appeared in 1985 on CBS Records to mild controversy because of the cover art: a scantily-dressed woman lying on her back with her legs spread, forming a V. The hype worked and the album made the charts. But before the first US tour, drummer Van de Graaf was replaced by Fritz Randow (ex-[[Eloy (band)|Eloy]]). Apart from playing 60 concerts, the band was also in the two largest festivals of the country, ''Day On The Green'' in [[Oakland]] before 60,000 and the ''Texxas Jam'' in front of over 80,000 spectators. After his return to Germany, John Lockton was replaced by the former [[Accept (band)|Accept]] guitarist, Herman Frank.

With their second album ''Don't Get Mad... Get Even'' the band again toured through Europe and America and the single ''Check's In The Mail'' gave them a radio hit in the USA. The third album ''Hungry Hearts'' came out in 1987 leading to yet more European and North American live work. A concert in Hamburg was recorded for a live album, which appeared in 1988 under the title ''That's Live''. After its release, Huhn left the band, in order to join [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]. For his replacement the band auditioned, among others, later [[Thunderhead (band)|Thunderhead]]-frontman Ted Bullet, but eventually decided for a 22-year-old Swiss, Fernando Garcia.

The fourth album ''Culture Killed The Native'' (released 23.01.1989 in Europe and at the end of February 1989 in the USA) achieved #19 in the German charts and also entered the charts in the USA again. A Europe tour as support for [[Gary Moore]] followed, before Victory started their first headline tour through America, as well as their first concert in Canada. Both Singles ''Never Satisfied'' and ''Don't Tell No Lies'' again received airplay on Radio and [[MTV]]. By 1990 a second studio album with Garcia was released: ''Temples Of Gold'' appeared in the top 20 in Germany and the first edition of it added a six song live EP, of recordings made in Los Angeles. An additional US-Tour followed, before the 1992  Album ''You Bought It You Name It'' was released.

Victory now ranked alongside [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Accept (band)|Accept]] and [[Helloween]] as the most successful German band but announced their split in 1994 with the double live album ''Liveline''. Two years later, they returned with the new album ''Voiceprint''. Frank was replaced by the new, then Los Angeles–based guitarist Jake Paland (who has also worked with PFL, Timo Maas and Jimmy Somerville amongst others), and Randow by Matthias Liebetruth (who some years later would play for [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]]). The album's release was accompanied by an extensive tour and the single releases ''Deep Inside The World'' and ''Cyberia'', of which the latter again received airplay on all major music-TV channels. Varying personal interests among the band members though led to the final dissolution for the band.

===Later Years===
Newton made a name as a producer (he worked on [[Helloween]]'s ''[[Keeper of the seven keys]]''), Knorn became manager of [[Uli Jon Roth]], [[Glenn Hughes (British musician)|Glenn Hughes]] and [[Michael Schenker]]. Huhn joined (in 2000) Foghat and Garcia (from 2004) sang for Swiss metal band Godiva. Randow in the meantime played for [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]], Liebetruth became drummer for [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and Paland continued working as a studio guitarist and focusing on his own projects.

===Reunion===
In 2002, rumours of a reunion of Victory started. Garcia declined to participate, which made it all the more surprising that in 2003, the album ''Instinct'' appeared with the almost original lineup of [[Charlie Huhn|Huhn]], Newton, Frank, Knorn and Randow. Victory played some concerts in [[Russia]] and [[Bulgaria]] as well as [[Wacken Open Air]] - a festival in northern Germany. Since Huhn was living in America, tour activities were difficult and he was again replaced, now with Jioti Parcharidis, the singer of [[Human Fortress]].

With Parcharidis, the band released the album ''Fuel To The Fire'', containing re-recordings of their best-known songs in January 2006. Thereafter yet another line-up change followed. Randow left Victory and was replaced by former [[Sanvoisen]] drummer Achim Keller. Appearances followed at [[Bang Your Head!!!]] and [[Sweden Rock]]-festival as well as a European tour in support of [[Metal Church]] in May and June 2007. Four years later the band released ''Don't Talk Science'' in what they were calling their final album. The album was recorded in 2009 and was released in May 2011 on Label Golden Core/ZYX music.
