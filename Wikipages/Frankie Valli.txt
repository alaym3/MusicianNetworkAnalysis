Valli's birth year has been called into question.

Other sources, such as the Bear Family Records release, titled "The Four Lovers" (BCD 15424), as well as a 1965 [[mug shot]], available through [[The Smoking Gun]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/celebrity/music/frankie-valli |title = Frankie Valli mug shot |website = [[The Smoking Gun]] |access-date = October 6, 2013 }}</ref> all identify his year of birth as 1934.

== Music career ==
{{See also|The Four Seasons (group)#History|l1=The Four Seasons § History}}

=== 1950s–1960s ===
Valli began his singing career in the early 1950s with the Variety Trio (Nickie DeVito, [[Tommy DeVito (musician)|Tommy DeVito]], and [[Nick Massi|Nick Macioci]]). Valli's desire to sing in public was initially granted when – having heard Valli sing – the group offered him a guest spot when the group performed. In late 1952, the Variety Trio disbanded and Valli, along with Tommy DeVito, became part of the house band at The Strand in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. For his part, Valli played bass and sang.

He cut his first single, "My Mother's Eyes" (a cover of the 1929 [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] song from ''[[Lucky Boy]]''), in 1953 as "Frankie Valley", a variation on a name he adopted from "Texas" Jean Valli, a female hillbilly singer. As discussed in a 2014 article, "Frankie said in 2010 that Jean took him to meet music publishers Paul and Dave Kapp, telling them he was her brother. As a result, his first single was listed under 'Frankie Valley', and the name stuck—though he eventually changed it to the same spelling ... [as Texas Jean was using]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/06/jersey_boys_frankie_valli_name_syracuse_singer_jean_valli.html |title=Long before 'Jersey Boys,' Frankie Valli stole his name from a Syracuse hillbilly singer |last=Herbert |first=Geoff |date=June 20, 2014 |website=Syracuse.com |publisher=Syracuse Media Group. |access-date=January 2, 2016}}</ref>

Around this time, Valli and Tommy DeVito left the house band at The Strand and formed The Variatones with Hank Majewski, Frank Cottone, and Billy Thompson. In 1956, as part of an audition backing a female singer, the group impressed New York record man Peter Paul, who had them auditioning at [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] a week later.

Renamed [[the Four Lovers]], the group recorded several singles and one album's worth of tracks. They had a minor hit with "[[You're the Apple of My Eye]]" in 1956. Nickie DeVito and Hank Majewski left in 1958 to be replaced by Nick Macioci (now Nick Massi) and Hugh Garrity. Massi was in and out of the group, and, occasionally [[Charles Calello]] joined on accordion. The group continued to perform until 1959, when [[Bob Gaudio]] became a member. After a few more changes, the group was renamed "The Four Seasons" in 1960 after a bowling alley in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union, New Jersey]], in which they auditioned at its cocktail lounge.<ref>Gollender, Walter (December 1972).

As the lead singer of the Four Seasons, Valli had a string of hits beginning with the number-one hit "[[Sherry (song)|Sherry]]" in 1962. During this period of his career with The Four Seasons, the group's bassist and vocal arranger Nick Massi was replaced in 1965 by Charlie Calello, the group's instrumental arranger, and, then shortly thereafter, Calello was replaced by Joseph LaBracio, who went by the pseudonym [[Joe Long]].

During the 1960s, Gaudio and his then-songwriting partner, producer [[Bob Crewe]], worked with Valli to craft solo recordings with varying degrees of success. This concept of a major recording artist performing solo in opposition to his or her own group performances was rare in the rock/pop world ([[Buddy Holly]] and [[the Crickets]] were an exception) and may have given tacit approval to other groups and members of other groups to pursue such a path. The potential to dominate the charts with group and solo recordings was great, and Valli, Gaudio and Crewe occasionally rose to the occasion with both great performances and commercial hits. Valli was the original artist to record the Gaudio-Crewe composition "[[The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)]]", a performance that was copied nearly note for note when recorded by [[the Walker Brothers]], an American group based in England. The Walker Brothers version was a huge success. Valli continued to record solo performances and finally reached major success with the release of "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]", which reached number two in the charts and was widely recorded by many other artists.

Valli's debut solo album was a gathering together of various single releases and a few new recordings. Before the release of Valli's second solo album, a single was released in July 1967 with the A-side "I Make a Fool of Myself", a record that reached number 18. ''Timeless'', Valli's second solo album release was more coherent and Valli took more time in recording it. ''Timeless'' contains one Top 40 hit, "To Give (The Reason I Live)".

Valli ended the 1960s with a string of recordings that were included in the Valli/Four Seasons album ''Half & Half'' or released as various singles. The only hit to emerge at this time was the recording of "The Girl I'll Never Know (Angels Never Fly This Low)", reaching number 52.

=== 1970s–1990s ===
"You're Ready Now", a Valli solo recording from 1966, became part of the [[Northern soul]] scene and reached number eleven on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in December 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/frankie%20valli/ |title = UK Charts – Frankie Valli |website=Officialcharts.com |access-date = November 14, 2013 }}</ref>

In 1975, his single "[[My Eyes Adored You]]" hit number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 and reached number 5 in the UK chart. In the same year, he also had a number six ''Billboard'' hit with the disco-laden "[[Swearin' to God]]" reaching number 31 in the UK chart, while further UK chart success came with "[[Fallen Angel (Rogue song)|Fallen Angel]]", written by [[Guy Fletcher (songwriter)|Guy Fletcher]] and [[Doug Flett]]. Valli was in the UK charts, reaching number 11, with this at the same time as the Four Seasons enjoyed a UK hit with "[[Silver Star (The Four Seasons song)|Silver Star]]" on which Valli did not appear as lead.

In 1976, Valli covered [[the Beatles]] song "[[A Day in the Life]]" for the ephemeral musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''.

In 1978, he sang the [[Grease (song)|theme song]] for the film version of the stage play [[Grease (film)|''Grease'']], a song written by [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]], which became a number one hit. He had two further chart successes the following year, "Save Me, Save Me" in November 1978, which entered the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Easy Listening chart]]; and "Fancy Dancer" in January 1979, which entered the pop charts.<ref name="amgbio"/>

Valli began suffering from [[otosclerosis]] in 1967, forcing him to "sing from memory" in the latter part of the 1970s. Surgery performed by Los Angeles ear specialist Victor Goodhill restored most of his hearing by 1980.<ref>Bronson, Fred (1992). ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits'' (3rd edition).

=== Since 2000 ===

In 2005, the musical ''[[Jersey Boys]]'' opened on Broadway. Besides performances of many of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons hit recordings, it features a biographical narrative, told as four separate points of view by each of the members of the Four Seasons (Tommy DeVito, Frankie Valli, Nick Massi and Bob Gaudio), with Valli himself portrayed by [[John Lloyd Young]] in the original production. The musical dramatizes several real-life incidents from Valli's life, including his estrangement from daughter Francine, who died in 1980. The show has been widely acclaimed, financially successful, and was nominated for eight [[Tony Awards]], winning four, notably Best Musical, Actor, and Supporting Actor. The musical has touring companies around the world, as well as a version at [[Paris Las Vegas]]. This musical was adapted into a 2014 [[Jersey Boys (film)|film of the same name]] directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], with Young again appearing as Valli.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In October 2007, Valli released ''Romancing the '60s'', an album containing covers of his favorite songs from the 1960s, two of which—"Sunny" and "Any Day Now"—he had previously recorded.<ref name="officialbio" /> This was Valli's first solo album in nearly twenty-seven years since 1980's ''Heaven Above Me''.

In October 2012, Valli made his Broadway debut with a week-long concert engagement at the [[The Broadway Theatre|Broadway Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]] starting October 19.<ref name="NPR" /><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/03/26/frankie-valli-four-seasons-broadway/1645157/ |title = 50 years on, a Jersey Boy arrives on Broadway |work = [[USA Today]] |date = October 19, 2012 |first = Elysa |last = Gardner |access-date = May 17, 2013 }}</ref>

From March 2016 to January 2017, "Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons" were touring the US, scheduled to play small-to-mid-size venues such as the Silver Legacy Casino in Reno, Nevada, the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona and the County Fair in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.frankievallifourseasons.com/shows.html |title =Frankie Valli Shows |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date = 2016 |website = Frankie Valli |publisher = Frankie Valli |access-date = June 21, 2016 }}</ref> In October 2016, Valli released his first solo album in nine years, '''Tis the Seasons'', which features some of Valli covering some of his favorite [[Christmas]] songs.

Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons would continue touring in 2018 and 2019, with a new lineup after his lineup since 2003 spun off as its own act, The Modern Gentlemen. However, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], all touring plans were cancelled. Touring would resume in the summer of 2021 with dates scheduled until July 2022. In June 2021, Valli released his twelfth studio album, his first in five years, ''Touch of Jazz'', which features a collection of [[Jazz]] cover songs.

== Acting career ==
Valli has appeared as an actor in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (as Mafia boss Frank Doss), ''[[Full House]]'', the 1998 TV movie ''[[Witness to the Mob]]'' (as [[Frank LoCascio]] of the [[Gambino crime family]]), ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (as mobster [[Rusty Millio]], once referred to as "The Mayor of Munchkin Land"), and the 2014 film ''[[And So It Goes (film)|And So It Goes]]''.<ref name="imdbfilm">{{cite web |url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0885110/?nmdp=1&ref_=nm_ql_5 |title = Frankie Valli filmography |website = [[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date = September 26, 2016 }}</ref>

On the November 21, 2014, episode of ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' entitled "Ka Hana malu (Inside Job)", Valli played mysterious lawyer Leonard Cassano who was engaged to [[Carol Burnett]]'s character, Aunt Deb.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.etonline.com/tv/154244_hawaii_five0_sneak_peek_legends_carol_burnett_and_frankie_valli_are_getting_married/ |title = 'Hawaii Five-0' Sneak Peek: Legends Carol Burnett and Frankie Valli are Getting Married! |work = [[Entertainment Tonight]] |date = November 21, 2014 |access-date = November 23, 2014 }}</ref>

In 2015, Valli did interviews as himself on the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[The Making of the Mob: New York]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/06/22/ray-liotta-narrates-amcs-the-making-of-the-mob-new-york/28521017/ |title = 'Making of the Mob' brings out the big guns |work = [[USA Today]] |first = Bill |last = Keveney |date = June 22, 2015 |access-date = September 26, 2016 }}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Valli has been married three times. He married his first wife, Mary, who already had a two-year-old daughter, when he was in his early twenties. They raised two daughters together and divorced 13 years later in 1971. He married MaryAnn Hannagan in 1974, and that marriage lasted eight years. He then married Randy Clohessy in 1984; they had three sons and separated in 2004. In 1980, his stepdaughter, Celia, was killed when she fell off a fire escape, and six months later his youngest daughter, Francine, from his marriage to Mary reportedly died from a drug overdose.<ref name="Robins" /><ref name="people" /><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/06/20/jersey_boys_accuracy_fact_checking_clint_eastwood_s_four_seasons_biopic.html |title = Jersey Boys accuracy: Fact-checking Clint Eastwood's Four Seasons biopic |work = BrowBeat |publisher = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date = June 20, 2014 |first = Dee |last = Lockett |access-date = December 20, 2014 }}</ref>

One issue in Valli's third divorce went up on appeal to the [[Supreme Court of California]]: whether a life-insurance policy purchased in 2003 was [[community property]]. On May 15, 2014, the state supreme court unanimously affirmed the trial court's ruling that the policy was community property (and not Randy's separate property), in an opinion signed by Associate Justice [[Joyce Kennard]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Egelko |first1=Bob |title=Frankie Valli wins divorce case in California Supreme Court |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Frankie-Valli-wins-divorce-case-in-California-5482177.php |access-date=January 28, 2019 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=May 16, 2014 |location=San Francisco}}</ref><ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10108674076779658767 In re Marriage of Valli]'', 58 Cal.4th 1396, 171 Cal.Rptr.3d 454, 324 P.3d 274 (2014).</ref>
