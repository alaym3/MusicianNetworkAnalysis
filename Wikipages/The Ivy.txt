==History==
===1917–1989===
The original restaurant was opened by Abel Giandolini in 1917 as an unlicensed Italian café in a building on the same site.  Legend has it that the name itself originated from a chance remark by the actress [[Alice Delysia]], who overheard Giandolini apologise to a customer for the inconvenience caused by building works. When he said that it was because of his intention to create a restaurant of the highest class, she interjected "Don't worry – we will always come and see you. 'We will cling together like the ivy'", a line from the then-popular song,<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/04/ivy-restaurant-celebrity|title=The Ivy: dine with the stars|author=Matthew Fort|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> 1902's "Just Like the Ivy I'll Cling to You", written by AJ Mills and [[Harry Castling]].
The restaurant expanded into the current premises in 1929 run by Giandolini, with his longstanding Maitre d' Mario Gallati as host.

In part due to its proximity to the West End theatres, exclusivity and late closing time (it is still open until close to midnight), the restaurant quickly became a theatrical institution, with [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Lilian Braithwaite]], [[Terence Rattigan]], [[Binkie Beaumont]] and [[Noël Coward]] being habitués, having their regular 2-seater tables along the walls. According to the actor [[Donald Sinden]] in his [[Sky Arts]] television documentary series ''[[Great West End Theatres]]'', The Ivy became so famous as a theatrical-celebrities haunt that in the 1943 [[revue]] ''Sweet and Low'' which ran for almost six years at the neighbouring [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]], there was a satirical sketch included, updated regularly, entitled ''Poison Ivy'', where the show's star [[Hermione Gingold]] "would exchange wicked and salacious celebrity gossip".<ref>''[[Great West End Theatres]]'' episode 5. St Martins Theatre</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Morley|first= Sheridan|year= 1986|title= The Great Stage Stars|location= London|publisher= Angus & Robertson|isbn= 0816014019|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/greatstagestarsd0000morl}}</ref>

In 1950 Giandolini sold The Ivy to Bernard Walsh and the restaurant became part of his Wheeler's group of fish restaurants. Subsequent owners were [[Lew Grade|Lady Grade]] and the [[Forte Group|Forte Foundation]]. It then closed in 1989 and Jeremy King and Chris Corbin, who owned [[Le Caprice]], bought it.

===1990–present===
Under its new owners, the restaurant was totally renovated to a design by American architect [[MJ Long]] incorporating specially-commissioned artworks by Sir [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], Sir [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], Sir [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]], [[Joe Tilson (artist)|Joe Tilson]], [[Patrick Caulfield]], [[Michael Craig-Martin]] and [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]]. The restaurant opened in June 1990 and became a sensation. The restaurant seats 100 guests and there is also a private dining room on the first floor of the restaurant, seating up to 60 guests. Mobile phones and cameras are forbidden anywhere in the restaurant or adjoining club and there is a [[dress code]], where smart casual attire is required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-ivy.co.uk/dress-code/|title=Dress Code|website=The Ivy|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref>

A recipe book, ''The Ivy: The Restaurant and its Recipes'', written by the restaurant critic [[A. A. Gill]] was published in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hodder.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9780340693124|title=The Ivy: The Restaurant and its Recipes|author=A A Gill|publisher=Hodder.co.uk|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

[[The Restaurant Inspector|Fernando Peire]] was appointed Senior [[Maître d']], eventually leaving in December 1998, three months after the restaurant was sold to [[Belgo]] PLC as part of Caprice Holdings Ltd; Corbin and King departed two years later (whereupon they established their own Rex Restaurants, later Corbin & King).

In 2000, the restaurant was awarded the [[Moët & Chandon]] London Restaurant Award for excellence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londoneats.com/search/dosearch.asp|title=The Ivy|publisher=Londoneats.com|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

In 2005 the entrepreneur [[Richard Caring]] bought The Ivy and the Caprice Holdings group (which owns Le Caprice in the [[St James's]] area of London, J. Sheekey near [[Leicester Square]], [[Scott's Oyster Bar|Scotts in Mount Street]] and 34 in [[Grosvenor Square]]).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 2007 Fernando Peire returned to The Ivy as Director of The Ivy and The Club at The Ivy. Gary Lee, who had previously been in charge of private functions at The Ivy, returned as Head Chef and was appointed Executive Chef in 2008. Executive Chef Director of Caprice Holdings restaurants (now Caprice Group) is Tim Hughes.{{when|date=December 2020}}

==The Club at The Ivy==
In September 2008, '''The Club at The Ivy''', a private members' club with a hidden entrance via an adjacent flower-shop, was opened on the three floors above the restaurant, with membership (drawn primarily from [[creative industries#Definitions of the creative industries|creative industries]] and the arts) "as hard to get as a table at The Ivy itself" according to the author [[A. A. Gill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-ivyclub.co.uk/|title=The Club at the Ivy|publisher=The-ivyclub.co.uk|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/columnists/dylan-jones/talk-of-the-town-the-ivy-clubs-entrance-is-so-white-that-it-feels-as-if-youre-walking-into-a-huge-ipod-955314.html|title=Talk of the town: The Ivy Club's entrance is so white that it feels as if you're walking into a huge iPod|work=The Independent|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

It boasts a Piano Lounge; a dining room ("The Drawing Room"), open for breakfast, lunch and supper; a wood-panelled library "of books that reflect many of our members’ interests in art, literature, film, theatre, architecture and design"; a [[film screening]]-room and entertainment space known as the Loft; a further private dining-room seating up to 14 people and a cigar-terrace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbds.com/interiors/private-clubs/club-ivy|title=The Club at the Ivy London – Private Club Interiors – Martin Brudnizki|publisher=Mbds.com|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

Its director is Fernando Peire, the former senior [[Maître d']] (star of the [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] [[Reality television|TV]] series ''[[The Restaurant Inspector]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/the-restaurant-inspector|title=The Restaurant Inspector|work=Five|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>
