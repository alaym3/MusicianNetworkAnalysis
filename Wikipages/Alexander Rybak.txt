'''Alexander Igorevich Rybak'''  ({{lang-ru|Александр Игоревич Рыбак}}) or '''Alyaxandr Iharavich Rybak''' ({{lang-be|Аляксандр Ігаравіч Рыбак}}; born 13 May 1986) is a Belarusian-Norwegian singer-composer, violinist, pianist and actor.<ref name="øp">{{cite web|url=http://www.op.no/kultur/article4317559.ece|title=Rybaks ukjente fortid i Larvik |last=Hansen|first=Kjeld-Willy|date=9 May 2009|publisher=[[Østlands-Posten]]|language=no|access-date=12 July 2009}}</ref>

Though based in [[Oslo]], Rybak extensively worked on television programmes and on tours in [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Sweden]] throughout the early 2010s. Singing in mainly [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], Rybak, in his early twenties, held on to a [[teen idol]] status in [[Scandinavia]], [[Eastern Europe]], and to a certain extent in [[Western Asia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Where can I get...? |url=https://www.alexanderrybaknews.com/site/music/wherecaniget/page/2/ |website=Alexander Rybak News}}</ref> His debut album, ''[[Fairytales (Alexander Rybak album)|Fairytales]]'', charted in the top 20 in nine European countries, including a top position in Norway and Russia. After two pop albums in 2009 and 2010, Rybak desired to be more of a family-orientated artist, focusing on children's and classical music alongside and frequently performed with youth orchestras throughout the world.<ref name="eurostory.nl">{{Cite web|url=https://eurostory.nl/alexander-rybak-kinderboekenschrijver/|title=Alexander Rybak: kinderboekenschrijver|date=2016-02-10|website=Eurostory|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

Rybak is known for his extensive involvement in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Representing Norway in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 contest]] in Moscow, Russia, he won the competition with 387 points—the highest tally any country has achieved in the history of Eurovision under the then voting system—with "[[Fairytale (Alexander Rybak song)|Fairytale]]", a song he wrote and composed. Winning at the age of 23, Rybak remains the youngest solo male winner of the contest and the only Belarusian-born winner. His win was celebrated all across Europe for crushing stereotypes about the contest, such as needing an over-the-top performance or the negative influence of [[Eurovision Song Contest#Political and geographical voting|neighbour voting]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Евровидение-2020: лучшие выступления Норвегии на конкурсе |url=https://eurovision.stb.ua/ru/2020/05/18/evrovidenie-2020-luchshie-vystupleniya-norvegii-na-konkurse/ |website=STB.ua |access-date=22 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sprookje komt uit voor Noorse winnaar |url=http://radio.nl/63425/sprookje-komt-uit-voor-noorse-winnaar |website=Radio.nl}}</ref>

Since then Rybak has been involved several times in the contest. He represented Norway again in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], with the song "[[That's How You Write a Song]]", winning the second semi-final and finishing in 15th place in the Grand Final. He provided as an opening act to the Grand Final in 2010 and as an interval act in 2012 and 2016. Rybak has frequently provided commentary on the contest, working as a journalist in 2011, as once-off judge on the Belgian preselection in 2016 and as commentator on his personal social media.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV2EfAbePig | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/UV2EfAbePig| archive-date=2021-11-02 | url-status=live|website=YouTube |publisher=Eurovision Song Contest}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hadise en Alexander Rybak adviseren Eurosongkandidaten |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2015/12/17/hadise_en_alexanderrybakadvisereneurosongkandidaten-1-2525944/ |website=VRT|date=17 December 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rybak |first1=Alexander |title=Login • Instagram |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BFegwPsmFiP/ |website=Instagram}}</ref>

In early 2015, Rybak took part in the Russian television show ''[[Odin v Odin!]]'', in which the participants impersonated legendary artists. The premier episode was broadcast on 8 February in which he impersonated [[Elvis Presley]]. Despite initially refusing to portray female artists, Rybak impersonated [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[Conchita Wurst]] and Russian folk singer [[Lyudmila Ryumina]], for which he received top marks from the jury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alexanderrybaknews.com/alexander-rybak-dress-debuts-on-womens-day/45950/|title=Alexander Rybak "dress debuts" on Women's day|last=tessala|date=2015-03-08|website=International Fansite – Alexander Rybak News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://russia.tv/video/show/brand_id/58992/episode_id/1189492/video_id/1160204/|title=Один в один.

While announcing his desire to stay a children's musical in 2013, Rybak could not find the funds and support for this project. Instead, he decided to create a children's book with a CD with songs and an audio book attached to it. Rybak initially struggled to find a publisher for this, as most publishers were only interested in the physical book. Eventually, Rybak released ''Trolle og den magiske fela'' through [[Cappelen Damm]].<ref name="alexanderrybak.com"/> Quickly after that, the Danish rights were secured<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://agency.cappelendamm.no/_trolle-og-den-magiske-fela-alexander-rybak-9788202490218|title=Trolle og den magiske fela|last1=Sentrum|first1=Agency {{!}} Postal address: Postboks 1900|last2=Rights|first2=0055 Oslo {{!}} Visiting address: Akersgata 47/49 {{!}} Tel : +47 21 61 65 00 © Cappelen Damm AS-|date=2015|website=Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13|last3=regulations}}</ref> and the book was also complimented by [[Edward van de Vendel]], who proof translated the book's first chapters into [[Dutch language|Dutch]].<ref name="eurostory.nl"/> On 12 June, a new Norwegian song "{{lang|no|Blant Fjell}}" (Among Mountains) was released.

[[File:ESC2016 Grand Final Interval Act 09 (crop).jpg|thumb|Rybak performing in the interval act of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]]]]

Shortly after that, he released his lead single "I Came To Love You", which music video was shot in Greece.

In 2016, Rybak marked his ten-year's anniversary as an artist with re-releasing former singles such as his debut single "Foolin'" and "5 To 7 Years". Next to that, he held several concert shows under the title "Entertainer".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexanderrybak.com/2016/04/05/alexander-rybak-presents-summer-show-entertainer/|title=Alexander Rybak presents the Summer-show "Entertainer"|date=2016-04-05|website=Alexander Rybak|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

During the Eurovision 2017, Rybak publicly supported Portuguese singer [[Salvador Sobral]] to win the contest. Sobral eventually won Eurovision with "[[Amar pelos dois]]", breaking Rybak's 2009 record. Rybak released his own version of the song, including self-written English lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2017/05/15/listen-alexander-rybak-covers-salvadors-amar-pelos-dois/189624/|title=Listen: Alexander Rybak covers Salvador's "Amar Pelos Dois"|date=2017-05-15|website=wiwibloggs|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> This version was later covered by others including Eurovision 2018 contestants [[Sennek]] and [[Ari Olafsson]].

=== Eurovision 2018 ===
[[File:Alexander Rybak Melodi Grand Prix 2018.jpg|thumb|Rybak performing "That's How You Write A Song" at the final of Melodi Grand Prix 2018.]]
In January 2018, it was revealed that Rybak would be taking part in the Norwegian national selection ''[[Melodi Grand Prix 2018]]'', to represent [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], with the song "[[That's How You Write a Song]]". The song initially received very mixed reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2018/03/10/melodi-grand-prix-2018-aleksander-walmann-is-our-favourite-to-win-in-oslo/219377/|title=Melodi Grand Prix 2018: Aleksander Walmann is our favourite to win in Norway|date=2018-03-10|website=wiwibloggs|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> Rybak stated that he wanted to take part mostly for pleasure, rather than wanting to win the competition, stating that Norwegian singer [[Jahn Teigen]], who participated fourteen times in the Norwegian selection and won three times, was his inspiration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/alexander-rybak-kan-bruke-flere-timer-pa-a-kjope-et-brod-1.14029302|title=Alexander Rybak kan bruke flere timer på å kjøpe et brød|last=Tolfsen|first=Caroline|date=2018-05-01|website=NRK|language=nb-NO|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

Rybak was not the bookmakers and experts' favourite to win the selection,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurovisionworld.com/odds/norway-mgp-2018|title=Odds Norway Melodi Grand Prix 2018|website=Eurovisionworld|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> but topped several public polls ahead of the competition.

Rybak proceeded to the last four, where he first beat [[Aleksander Wallman]] in a duel and then proceeded to the final duel with singer [[Rebecca (Norwegian singer)|Rebecca]], which he also won.

After the show, several news outlets claimed that Norwegian broadcaster NRK had favourised Rybak, putting him last in the running order.<ref name="dagbladet.no">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/a/69602175|title=NRK slår tilbake mot kritikken:-Dette er en svært drøy påstand|last=Grindem|first=Karianne|date=2018-03-13|website=Dagbladet.no|language=no|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> NRK denied this, pointing to the voting statistics that showed that Rybak had won with a large margin.<ref name="dagbladet.no"/> He won his first duel with 94.3% of the votes and his final duel by 71% of the votes, receiving a total of 306,393 votes, the third-highest number of votes an entry ever reached in ''Melodi Grand Prix'' history.

Rybak was drawn to perform first in second semi-final on 10 May and finished first overall, becoming the first ever Eurovision performer to win two semi-finals after he also won the second semi-final in 2009. In the final, on 12 May 2018, Rybak performed seventh in the running order and finished in fifteenth place, receiving a top jury score from Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovisionworld.com/eurovision/2018|title=Eurovision 2018 Results: Voting & Points|publisher=eurovisionworld.com|access-date=13 May 2018}}</ref>

===2019–present===
In 2019, Rybak's children's musical ''Trolle og den magiske fela'' premiered in [[Kristiansand]] and received wide critical acclaim by reviewers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/anmeldelser/anmeldelse_-_trolle-og-den-magiske-fela__-kilden-teater-1.14800946|title="Leverer showet publikum vil ha"|last=Nystøyl|first=Karen Frøsland|date=2019-11-29|website=NRK|language=nb-NO|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> The show sold over 10,000 tickets and had to schedule extra performances to curb the demand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/KildenKrs/posts/2732117110179079|title=Kilden teater og konserthus|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

In 2020, Rybak co-wrote an entry for Melodi Grand Prix 2020 together with [[JOWST]] for singer [[Magnus Bokn]] called "Over the Sea". The song won the fourth-semi final of the selection show and proceeded to the final, where it eventually lost out to [[Ulrikke Brandstorp]]'s "Attention".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/mgp-bidragene-fra-vest-kjemper-om-finaleplass-1.14885916|title=MGP-bidragene fra Vest kjemper om finaleplass|last=Eliassen|first=Heather Ørbeck|date=2020-02-01|website=NRK|language=nb-NO|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

Rybak then said: "I never raised my voice before, and that's why I did what I did. I'm just a human being—and perhaps not the glossy image many believe.
