==Career==
===2011–2012: Early years and EPs===
All four members of The Jungle Giants attended [[Mansfield State High School]] in [[Mansfield, Queensland|Mansfield]], Brisbane. {{Cn|date=November 2021}} Singer-Songwriter-Guitarist, Sam Hales and Cesira Aitken (Lead Guitarist) played in one band and, bassist, Andrew Dooris and Keelan Bijker (Drummer) in another. 

After completing school in 2009, Hales worked two jobs to fund a debut self-titled EP, which was recorded with local producer, Yanto Browning at Airlock Studios in January 2011. {{Cn|date=November 2021}} Hales contributed drums, as well as vocals and guitar on the EP, with Aitken on guitar and Dooris on bass, before recruiting Bijker to complete the band. The EP was released independently in March 2011. The Jungle Giants EP contained lead single "Mr. Polite", which was picked up by Triple J Unearthed and led to widespread national touring in support of established Australian bands Ball Park Music, Boy and Bear and Last Dinosaurs. 

The band's follow-up EP, ''[[She's a Riot]]'', was released via Create/Control on 27 July 2012, drawing on life experiences and telling stories of friendships and relationships in Hales' life. In late 2012, The Jungle Giants supported [[Last Dinosaurs]]' national Satellites tour with Twinsy. This was followed by an early 2013 tour with [[Two Door Cinema Club]], playing a series of concerts throughout Australia along with [[The Vaccines]]. On 26 January 2013, single "She's a Riot" ranked 83rd on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2012]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Triple J's Hottest 100|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/12/countdown/100-81.htm/}}</ref>
