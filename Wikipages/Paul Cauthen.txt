== Early life ==
Cauthen was born in [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]] in [[East Texas]].<ref name=TylerTelegraph-PATHBenefit-2017>{{cite news|last1=Maynard|first1=Calvin|title=Concert-raffle event at Stanley's to benefit PATH|url=https://tylerpaper.com/concert-raffle-event-at-stanley-s-to-benefit-path/article_a5a989da-8889-5d57-9a26-498cf2aac093.html|work=[[Tyler Morning Telegraph]]|date=22 December 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Cauthen grew up in a religious household. His father was a song leader in the conservative Christian [[Church of Christ]],<ref name=BuildingOurOwnNashville-MyGospel-2017>{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Chaz|title=Interview: Paul Cauthen talks influences, musical upbringing, touring, not getting married, his latest album, Cadillacs, God and timpani drums|url=https://buildingourownnashville.com/2017/07/18/interview-paul-cauthen-talks-influences-musical-upbringing-touring-not-getting-married-his-latest-album-cadillacs-god-and-timpani-drums/|work=Building Our Own Nashville|date=18 July 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=VICE-MyGospel-2016>{{cite news|last1=Domenighini|first1=Annalise|title=The Gospel According to Paul Cauthen|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9bkkda/the-gospel-according-to-paul-cauthen|work=[[Vice (magazine)|VICE]]|date=10 October 2016|language=en}}</ref> and his father's twin brother was the preacher there. Cauthen's father and uncle sang as a musical duo in church.<ref name=NPR-AllThingsConsidered-Room41-2019 /> Cauthen has said that the church he grew up in did not allow instruments, so the focus was on [[a capella]] singing of what he called "heavenly highway hymns, the old hymnals",<ref name=BuildingOurOwnNashville-MyGospel-2017 /> but that if he was active in the church, he would be a fifth-generation song leader/preacher.<ref name=NPR-AllThingsConsidered-Room41-2019 />

Cauthen has said that his family is from Texas on both sides. His grandmother's family was from West Texas as well as part of New Mexico because her father sold drill bits for oil wells. Cauthen's father is a fifth-generation Texan via [[Montgomery, Alabama]], where Cauthen's paternal grandfather went to school with [[Hank Williams]].<ref name=BluegrassSituation-Room41-2019>{{cite news|last1=Lupetin|first1=Z.|last2=Cauthen|first2=Paul|title=Episode 42: The Show on the Road – Paul Cauthen|url=https://thebluegrasssituation.com/read/the-show-on-the-road-paul-cauthen/|work=The Bluegrass Situation|date=18 September 2019|format=Audio podcast interview}}</ref>

Although his maternal grandfather Jim Paul Cauthen died when he was 10 years old, Cauthen was deeply influenced by his grandfather, who gave him a guitar and was a songwriter himself. Cauthen was his only male grandchild.<ref name=BluegrassSituation-Room41-2019 /> Cauthen's grandfather also taught him – and his two sisters – how to sing harmonies at a very young age.<ref name=BuildingOurOwnNashville-MyGospel-2017 /> Cauthen's grandmother taught him piano.<ref name=DallasObserver-MyGospel-2016>{{cite news|last1=Mollotova|first1=Molly|title=Paul Cauthen Cuts Out the Fat and Finds His Own Brand of Gospel|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/paul-cauthen-cuts-out-the-fat-and-finds-his-own-brand-of-gospel-8803619|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|date=14 October 2016}}</ref> Jim Paul Cauthen had spent time in the 1950s with [[Buddy Holly]] and [[The Crickets]] and was good friends with Holly's bandmate [[Sonny Curtis]], who later fronted The Crickets.<ref name=RollingStone-HaveMercy-2018>{{cite news|last1=Gage|first1=Jeff|title=Why Texas Troubadour Paul Cauthen Is Country Music's Wildman Preacher|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/why-texas-troubadour-paul-cauthen-is-country-musics-wildman-preacher-666081/|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=19 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=AmericanSongwriter-Room41-2019>{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Rick|title=Portraits: Paul Cauthen, Walking Through the Fire|url=https://shorefire.com/images/uploads/client/PAULCAUTHEN_AmericanSongwriter_Sept.jpg|work=[[American Songwriter]]|date=September 2019}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== Sons of Fathers ===
Cauthen got his start playing in an Americana/indie folk rock band singer-songwriter duo with musician David Beck. Cauthen met Beck, whose father was Bill Whitbeck, long-time [[Robert Earl Keen]] bass player, in [[San Marcos, Texas]] in 2009.<ref name=AustinChron-BurningDays-2013>{{cite news|last1=Haupt|first1=Melanie|title='Burning Days' and nights with Sons of Fathers|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2013-03-29/the-prodigy-and-the-prodigal/|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=29 March 2013}}</ref> They got to know each other at a regular local songwriter's night series at Cheatham Street Warehouse.<ref name=DallasObserver-Interview-2013>{{cite news|last1=Smyers|first1=Darryl|title=David Beck and Paul Cauthen of Sons of Fathers: "We've Had Some Crazy Experiences in Dallas"|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/david-beck-and-paul-cauthen-of-sons-of-fathers-weve-had-some-crazy-experiences-in-dallas-7073364|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|date=25 November 2013}}</ref>  Beck gave deejay Jessie Scott their demo, who gave their demo to manager Marty Schwartz, who came out of retirement to manage the duo.<ref name=AustinChron-BurningDays-2013 /> The band was initially called Beck & Cauthen but they later changed the name of the band to be Sons of Fathers when musician [[Beck]] sent a cease and desist letter.<ref name=DallasObserver-Interview-2013 /> Sons of Fathers featured Beck on the upright bass and Cauthen on guitar, with both singing vocals.<ref name=SteamMagazine-Feature-2013>{{cite news|last1=Mills|first1=Rachel|title=Sons of Fathers|url=https://www.steammagazine.net/sons-of-fathers|work=Steam Magazine|date=December 2013|language=en}}</ref>

''Burning Days'' featured Regan Schmidt on lap steel/electric guitar, Dees Stribling on drums, Bryan Mammel on keyboards/accordion, Tony Browne on guitar/mandolin. The record also features Maines on pedal steel and Corby Schaub on guitar.

The duo also had a studio called Fast Horse Studios where they produced records by local bands like Canvas People, Carson McHone, Luke Bell, Pake Rossi, and others.<ref name=AustinChron-MohawkResidency-2014>{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=William Harries|title=Sons of Fathers Residency|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/music/2014-01-14/sons-of-fathers-residency/|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=14 January 2014}}</ref>

In 2018, Cauthen released the EP, ''Have Mercy''.<ref name=RollingStone-HaveMercy-2018 /> The EP, recorded live at Modern Electric in Dallas, was produced by Beau Bedford, whose band the Texas Gentlemen appears on the record.

In 2019, Cauthen released his second solo record called ''Room 41''. At one point Cauthen considered calling the record ''Holy Ghost Fire'' after that track on the album, but eventually settled on ''Room 41''.<ref name=TheBoot-Room41-2019 /> The title of the record is in honor of the room number where Cauthen lived at the Belmont Hotel in [[West Dallas]], Texas, for almost two years while he wrote the record.<ref name=NPR-AllThingsConsidered-Room41-2019 />

''Room 41'' was the culmination of a dark period in Cauthen's life, prompted by the end of a long-term relationship in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]. Cauthen relocated to Dallas and while writing prolifically, went through a period of alcohol and drug abuse.<ref name=TheBoot-Room41-2019 />

The second video from ''Room 41'' was for the track "Prayed for Rain", which is about the struggles of sharecroppers from the bleak period of 1930s [[Dust Bowl]].

The video was shot at Tate Farms in [[Rockwall, Texas]].<ref name=DallasObserver-PrayedForRain-2019>{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=David|title=Exclusive Premiere: Paul Cauthen's Video 'Prayed for Rain' Is an Ode to Hardscrabble Existence|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/watch-the-premiere-of-paul-cauthens-new-music-video-prayed-for-rain-11744352|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|date=30 August 2019}}</ref>
