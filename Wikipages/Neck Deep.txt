'''Neck Deep''' are<!-- This article is written in British English, which commonly treats collective nouns as plural. Please do NOT change "Are" to "Is" Thank you. --> a Welsh [[pop punk]] band from [[Wrexham]], Wales formed in 2012. Founded after vocalist Ben Barlow met former lead guitarist Lloyd Roberts, the pair posted a song ("What Did You Expect?") online under the name Neck Deep. The song soon gained attention online, resulting in the addition of rhythm guitarist Matt West, drummer Dani Washington/Abasi, and bassist Fil Thorpe-Evans. They released a pair of EPs, ''[[Rain in July]]'' (2012) and ''[[A History of Bad Decisions]]'' (2013), both recorded by Barlow's older brother, before signing with [[Hopeless Records|Hopeless]] in August 2013.

Following the release of their debut album ''[[Wishful Thinking (Neck Deep album)|Wishful Thinking]]'' in January 2014, the band became a full-time project, with the band members leaving their jobs and/or dropping out of university courses. Shortly after the release of their second album ''[[Life's Not out to Get You]]'' in August 2015, Roberts left the band due to allegations of sexual misconduct (which he was subsequently found to have [[No case to answer|no case to answer]]{{cn|date=August 2021}}),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Tyler|title=Neck Deep Respond to Allegations|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/neck_deep_respond_to_allegations|website=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine|access-date=11 July 2017}}</ref> and Sam Bowden (formerly of Climates and Blood Youth) joined in his place. The group's third album ''[[The Peace and the Panic]]'' was then released in August 2017, and debuted #4 both UK and United States. In September 2018, Thorpe-Evans left the band to pursue a solo career as a producer. In 2019, the band embarked in a summer tour with [[Blink-182]] as the opening act. By February 2020, the band added longtime collaborator and bassist Seb Barlow as an official member, plus later that month revealed an app with all sorts of multimedia regarding the announcement of their fourth album, titled ''[[All Distortions Are Intentional]]'', released 24 July.

On 27 June 2016, the band began writing new material for the band's third album. They began working on the album in the studio eight months after writing the band's new music on 21 February 2017. On 15 January 2017, the band's vocalist, Ben Barlow, stated that a band should always show progression in its music and they are certainly aware that is what they want to do in the band's third album. In an interview with the lead singer, Barlow explains how his father's passing influenced his motivation for writing Neck Deep's most recent album. Ben connects his father's death and the album by stating, "It's definitely opened my mind up creatively, it's gonna be a little ball of inspiration that I can kind of pick at, I guess."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Dani|title=Interview with BEN BARLOW of NECK DEEP|url=http://amnplify.com.au/portfolio-items/interview-with-ben-barlow-of-neck-deep/|website=Amnplify|access-date=26 July 2017}}</ref> On 5 April 2017, the band finished the album and was set to release it on 18 August of the same year.

It was also announced the band worked with Neal Avron and Mike Green on their new album. The band's lead singer, Ben Barlow was quoted saying to Alternative Press "The Peace and the Panic is about how we’ve grown up and experienced life in the last couple of years.". He also commented on two of the new tracks on the album, including the track "Happy Judgement Day" of which Barlow commented, ". .is on the panic side, and really, that song is a comment on the current social and political climate.". He also stated "Where Do We Go When We Go" is the last track on the record, and we feel it summarises our mood well. Very directly, the message is: "Fuck all this shit, fuck all the noise, let’s just make something of ourselves before our time is up."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/neck_deep_ben_barlow_interview|title=Neck Deep drop two new songs from upcoming album 'The Peace and the Panic' - Features - Alternative Press|last=Kelham|first=Andrew|website=Alternative Press|language=en|access-date=26 July 2017}}</ref>
