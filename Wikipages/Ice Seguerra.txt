'''Cariza "Ice" Yamson Seguerra''' (born September 17, 1983), formerly and still known professionally as '''Aiza Seguerra''', is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] actor, singer-songwriter and guitarist. Initially coming out as a [[lesbian]] in 2007, Seguerra now identifies himself as a [[Trans man|transgender man]].

On August 12, 2016, Seguerra was appointed by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] as Chairperson of the [[National Youth Commission (Philippines)|National Youth Commission]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/142806-aiza-seguerra-chairperson-national-youth-commission |title=Duterte appoints Aiza Seguerra as new NYC chairperson |work=[[Rappler]] |date=August 12, 2016 |access-date=August 12, 2016}}</ref>

==Career==
Seguerra first appeared as a three-year-old contestant of ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'''s "[[List of Eat Bulaga! segments#LittleMissPhilippines|Little Miss Philippines]]". He subsequently became part of the show from 1987 to 1997.<ref name="celebritiesph.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.celebritiesph.com/actresses/filipino-actresses/aiza-seguerra.html|title=Aiza Seguerra|publisher=Wow! Celebrities}}</ref>

As a child star, Seguerra appeared in more than 30 movies and TV shows to date. He often portrayed the role of actor and fellow ''Eat Bulaga!'' host [[Vic Sotto]]’s daughter in numerous films. He portrayed the role of Aiza Kabisote, daughter of Enteng Kabisote in ''[[Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!]]'' from 1987 to 1997.<ref name="celebritiesph.com"/> He only appeared in six films for [[Regal Films]]. At age 14, he competed in [[Bong Revilla]]'s Invitational Shootfest '98, and has won several awards in the sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carouselpinoy.com/aizacaroustar.html|title=Caroustar of the Month: September – Aiza Seguerra|publisher=Carousel Pinoy Entertainment}}</ref>

During his late teens, Seguerra began pursuing a career in music; singing and playing the guitar. His single "Pagdating ng Panahon" became a major hit in 2001 which enabled him to start a music career.

Seguerra won [[The Singing Bee (Philippine game show)|''The Singing Bee'']] on July 8, 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=124456|title=Seguerra reigned supreme on 'The Singing Bee'|publisher=ABS-CBN News}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> after [[Rachel Alejandro]] gave up her throne as defending champion due to other engagements. He defeated his co-contestant singer [[Bituin Escalante]]. Seguerra won ₱1,040,000 for a second time on July 10, raising his total winnings to ₱2,080,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=124835|title=Aiza rakes in P2.08M at 'The Singing Bee'|publisher=ABS-CBN News}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Seguerra also performed in Singapore for the [[Singapore Repertory Theatre]] presentation of the [[stage play]] ''Avenue Q''.

On January 7, 2013, Seguerra entered the [[Himig Handog P-Pop Love Songs]] contest as the interpreter for the song entry called "Anong Nangyari Sa Ating Dalawa", written by Jovinor Tan. He performed the song in the grand finals on February 24 at the [[SM Mall of Asia Arena]]. The song eventually finished in first place for Best P-pop Love Song thus rewarding the writer of the song with one million [[Philippine peso|pesos]] in cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://entertainment.inquirer.net/82603/director-composer-wins-himig-handog|title=Director-composer wins Himig Handog|first=Allan|last=Policarpio|website=entertainment.inquirer.net|date=February 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://myxph.com/features/4934/anong-nangyari-sa-ating-dalawa-is-himig-handogs-best-p-pop-love-song/ |title=Manong nangyari sa ating dalawa is himig handogs best p pop love song |website=myxph.com |date=August 2, 2019}}</ref>

In 2015, he returned to [[GMA Network]] after three years to star in [[Princess in the Palace]], which became a hit.

==Personal life==
Seguerra is the only child of Decoroso "Dick" Seguerra (of Calauag, Quezon) and Caridad "Caring" Yamson-Seguerra (of Bicol Region).

He studied in Operation Brotherhood Montessori Center and later enrolled at the [[University of Santo Tomas College of Fine Arts and Design|College of Fine Arts and Design]] of the [[University of Santo Tomas]] and acquired a college degree.<ref name="school">{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2002/06/22/life/aiza.goes.back.to.school.html |title=Aiza goes back to School |publisher=Sun Star }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

On August 18, 2007, Seguerra [[came out]] publicly as a lesbian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/articles/13546/Aiza-Seguerra-defends-her-girlfriend-against-detractors|title=Aiza Seguerra defends his girlfriend against detractors|author=Archie de Calma|date=August 18, 2007|language=tl|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal}}</ref> However, in August 2014, he came out as a transgender man.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2014/08/15/1357901/aiza-seguerra-im-transgender|title=Aiza Seguerra: 'I'm a transgender'|website=philstar.com}}</ref>

In 2013, Seguerra, along with other local celebrities, came together to join the [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] campaign 'Free Mali', a campaign aimed to release Mali, an [[Asian elephant]] currently living at the [[Manila Zoological and Botanical Garden|Manila Zoo]] and the only captive elephant in the Philippines, due to the poor facilities and keepers to care for him. Seguerra spoke up saying that "Mali has been sentenced to a life of loneliness, misery and neglect. When people all around the world are calling for Mali to be freed, in light of the suffering he has endured at the hands of the Manila Zoo, the proposal to bring in more elephants to the zoo is outrageous. They would have to endure the same cramped, concrete conditions, lack of exercise and improper veterinary care as Mali has for the past 36 years."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/08/16/13/charice-aiza-join-call-release-mali|title=Charice, Aiza join call to release Mali|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News|date=August 16, 2013}}</ref>

On December 8, 2014, Seguerra married model and actress [[Liza Diño]] in California.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aiza weds Liza in California|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/12/09/14/aiza-weds-liza-california|access-date=December 9, 2014|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]]|date=December 9, 2014|location=[[Manila]], [[Philippines]]}}</ref>
