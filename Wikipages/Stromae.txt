==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2018}}

===2000–07: Early career===
In 2000, he appeared as a rapper called Opmaestro, though he later changed his stage name to "Stromae", which is "[[Maestro]]" with the syllables reversed following the [[French slang]] practice, [[verlan]].<ref name="Sayare"/>

At the age of 18, he founded a rap group called "Suspicion", along with rapper "J.E.D.I." in Eichhof. They produced the song and music video "Faut que t'arrête le Rap..." before J.E.D.I. decided to leave the rap duo. To finance his private school education, Van Haver worked part-time in the hospitality industry, but his academic performance wasn't up to standard.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was only later, when he registered at the Institut national de radioélectricité et cinématographie, that he released his first EP "Juste un cerveau, un flow, un fond et un mic...".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===2007–08: Debut EP and record career===
In 2007, during his studies at the film school of Brussels, Stromae decided to concentrate fully on his musical career. This resulted in his debut-EP "Juste un cerveau, un flow, un fond et un mic…". In 2008 he signed a 4-year record deal with "Becock Music" and 'Kilomaître'.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===2008–2012: Breakthrough and international success===
[[File:Stromae.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Stromae]]
In 2008, Stromae worked as a young trainee at the music radio station NRJ in Brussels. Vincent Verbelen, Music Manager, was impressed by the talent he perceived in Stromae's first single "Alors on danse" and decided to air it for the first time on NRJ. The response from listeners (including influential personalities ranging from [[Anna Wintour]] and [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], to the then-president of France [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]){{citation needed|date=March 2015}} was one of extreme enthusiasm and Stromae came to wider public attention. In a few weeks from that point, sales of the song established it as number one in Belgium.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Vertigo Records]], a label of [[Mercury Records]] France ([[Universal Music Group]]), signed him for a worldwide licensing deal soon after this.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

By May 2010 the track "Alors on danse" had reached number one in Belgium, France, Sweden, Greece, Germany, Austria, Turkey, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, Romania, and the Czech Republic.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

On 2 September, Stromae collaborated with [[Kanye West]] and [[Gilbere Forte]] in a remix of his hit "Alors on danse".<ref>{{YouTube|-QTGh9SeNxs|Stromae feat. Kanye West – Alors on danse}} (2 September 2010). Retrieved on 2012-02-22.</ref> In 2010, he was nominated for Best Dutch and Belgian Act at the [[2010 MTV Europe Music Awards|MTV Europe Music Awards]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Of his music and influences, he has said: "I was in a little group doing rap music. I thought that rather than copying the French sound, I'd focus on a more American style but give it a European spin. And then I rediscovered the 90s [[Eurodance]]. For a long time we were ashamed of that sound but in fact, there's a lot to discover. It has its roots in everything from house to salsa. I also really admire [[Jacques Brel]] – he has been a huge influence on me – but also all sorts of other stuff, Cuban [[Son (music)|son]], and the [[Congolese rumba]], that I heard as a child; that music rocked the whole of Africa." Also, Stromae insists he wanted to collaborate with up and coming rap group Swag+5 featuring rapper T-Jay. In the end, the collaboration did not take place, but Stromae is a big fan of the America-based group.<ref>The Observer, 5 September 2010</ref> The critic Molloy Woodcraft: "He combines 90s electro synths and beats with a laidback delivery to the mesmeric effect".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

He is one of the ten winners of the [[European Border Breakers Award]] 2011. On 9 February 2011, his debut album ''Cheese'' (including the hit single "Alors on danse") won the award for Best Dance Album at the ''[[Victoires de la musique]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

On 23 May 2011, during the recording of the French TV show [[Taratata]], Stromae did a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of "[[Alors on danse]]" and "[[Don't Stop the Party (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Don't Stop the Party]]" with the [[Black Eyed Peas]]. Stromae also announced he would perform as the opening support act for the first of two concerts by the band in [[Paris]] on 24 and 25 June 2011 at [[Stade De France]].<ref>[http://arabia.msn.com/Entertainment/Music/InternationalNews/ATC/2011/May/5778482.aspx?ref=hptab Black Eyed Peas at Stade De France | MSN Arabia Entertainment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008161113/http://arabia.msn.com/Entertainment/Music/InternationalNews/ATC/2011/May/5778482.aspx?ref=hptab |date=8 October 2011 }}.

Stromae had previously met [[will.i.am]] at the [[NRJ Music Awards]] in January. will.i.am told him that he liked "Alors on danse" and said he wanted to collaborate with Stromae.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2011, he received one nomination for Best Belgian Act at the [[2011 MTV Europe Music Awards|MTV Europe Music Awards]].<ref>[http://be.mtvema.com/artiesten/stromae MTV EMA 2011 :: 06.11.2011 :: Belfast :: Stromae]. Be.mtvema.com (6 November 2011). Retrieved on 2012-02-22.</ref>

===2013–2017: ''Racine carrée''===
The first single "[[Papaoutai]]" from his second album ''[[Racine carrée]]'' ({{Lang-en|[[Square root]]}}) was digitally released on 13 May 2013. It went on to chart number 1 in Belgium and France, number 2 in the Netherlands, as well as number 7 in Germany and Switzerland.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

On 22 May 2013, amateur-looking videos appeared on YouTube showing Stromae, apparently drunk and wandering at the [[Avenue Louise|Louiza tram station in Brussels]] at dawn.<ref>{{YouTube|4iyNRBEbvTM|Stromae bourré à Bruxelles}} (23 May 2013)</ref> The videos went viral. A few days later, it was revealed that this was linked with the filming of a professional music video. This was confirmed during an appearance by Stromae on the French TV show ''Ce soir ou jamais'' in which he discussed and also performed his new single "[[Formidable (song)|Formidable]]", which is about the story of a drunk man just separated from his girlfriend. The music video was made from edited hidden-camera footage taken on 22 May. It also shows people taking pictures with their cellphones, people who are clearly irritated by his drunk actions, people helping him stand up, and three policemen asking if the artist was okay or if he needed some help.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_xH7noaqTA|title=Stromae - Formidable (ceci n'est pas une leçon)|date=27 May 2013|access-date=13 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/video-formidable-hips-le-nouveau-clip-de-stromae_1252239.html|title=VIDEO.

===Fashion===
Stromae is known for his distinctive physique and clothing style. He has used this image in launching a limited fashion line, Mosaert (an anagram of his stage name). The collection features bright colors and geometric patterns, and has been described as "hipster" and "retro kitsch". Stromae has said that he wanted to "create a bridge between British style and African aesthetic".<ref>{{cite web|title=Stromae: the eclectic musician|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/uomo-vogue/people-stars/2014/02/stromae#sthash.Z6ENENK6.dpuf|website=Vogue Italia|publisher=Vogue Magazine|access-date=30 October 2014}}</ref>
