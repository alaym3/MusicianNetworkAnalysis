''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' critic Josh Crowe described the record as something that "could pass as a mixtape, traversing through a medley of sounds, eras and genres", stating that "the one thing consistent throughout are the standout vocals of Minsky-Sergeant."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Working Men's Club - Working Men's Club|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/working-mens-club-working-mens-club|access-date=2021-05-27|website=Clash Magazine|language=en}}</ref> Dave Simpson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote: "The West Yorkshire band take the stark electronics of the post-punk scene and warm them with Detroit techno and Italian house – while addressing Andrew Neil with mischievous one-liners."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-02|title=Working Men's Club review|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/02/working-mens-club-review-synthpop-of-every-stripe-on-outstanding-debut|access-date=2021-05-27|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

Ali Shutler of ''[[NME]]'' was positive about the album, writing, "a world away from their early work, the Todmorden group find chaos in the every day on their superb debut."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-02|title=Working Men's Club - 'Working Men's Club' review: pulsating rave anthems on attention-demanding debut|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/working-mens-club-working-mens-club-review-radar-2767974|access-date=2021-05-27|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Tim Russell of ''[[God Is in the TV]]'' was also positive, calling ''Working Men's Club'' "a very special record, inspired by a fairly specific past but managing to sound fresh, contemporary and original, due in no small part to the precocious talent and charisma of singer Syd Minsky-Sergeant, a true star in the making."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-08|title=Working Men’s Club - Working Men’s Club (Heavenly)|url=https://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2020/10/08/working-mens-club-working-mens-club-heavenly/|access-date=2021-05-27|website=God Is In The TV|language=en-US}}</ref>
