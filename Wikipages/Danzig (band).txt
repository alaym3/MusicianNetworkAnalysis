'''Danzig''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band led by former [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] and [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] singer [[Glenn Danzig]]. Formed in 1987 in [[Lodi, New Jersey]], the group early on became a unique voice in the [[Rock music|rock]] scene, playing a [[blues rock|bluesy]], [[Doom metal|doom]]-laden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danzig-verotik.com/danzig/danzig_bio.html|title=DANZIG Bio|last=Popoff|first=Martin|author-link=Martin Popoff|publisher=Danzig-Verotik.com|access-date=2020-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalforcesmagazine.com/site/album-review-danzig-black-laden-crown/|title=Danzig Black Laden Crown|last=Arnold|first=Neil|date=2017|publisher=[[Metal Forces]]|access-date=2020-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/hop-on-board-with-danzig-for-their-new-video-last-ride-122722|title=Hop on board with Danzig for their new video, "Last Ride"|last=Adams|first=Will|date=6 September 2017|publisher=[[AXS TV]]|access-date=2020-06-13}}</ref> metal with Glenn Danzig [[Crooner|crooning]] in the style of [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. Danzig's openly [[satan]]ic lyrics and image stirred a degree of controversy.

==History==
===Beginnings (1986–1987)===
On July 14, 1986, [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] performed at [[Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in [[New York City|New York]] in what was to be their final show. In attendance was [[Rick Rubin]], who was scouting for potential bands to sign to his record label, [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Rubin initially wished to only sign Danzig himself, with the intent of making him the vocalist for a hard rock [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] that Rubin envisioned. However, Danzig refused to sign to Rubin's label without including Samhain's bassist [[Eerie Von]]. In 1987, he added [[John Christ]] on guitar and [[Chuck Biscuits]] (ex-[[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]) on drums.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

==="Classic" era (1988–1993)===
In 1988, Danzig released its [[Danzig (album)|self-titled debut album]] on Def American (later renamed to [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]]).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The band toured worldwide in support of the album throughout 1988 and 1989; they opened for [[Slayer]] on their ''[[South of Heaven]]'' tour in North America and [[Metallica]] on their ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' [[Damaged Justice|tour]] in Europe,<ref name="misfitscentral dates">{{cite web|title=Danzig Tour Dates|url=http://www.misfitscentral.com/danzig/tourdates.php|publisher=misfitscentral.com|access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SLAYER|url=http://metallipromo.com/slay.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref> and subsequently headlined their own tour, which included support from bands such as [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], [[Mudhoney]], [[Accept (band)|Accept]], [[Armored Saint]], [[Circus of Power]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Sick of It All]] and [[Carnivore (band)|Carnivore]].<ref name="misfitscentral dates" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Armored Saint|url=http://www.metallipromo.com/armored.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref> ''Danzig'' is the band's best-selling album, having been certified gold in the U.S. in 1994,<ref name="Kerrang!">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=darticle&f=kerrang.94|title=Black Gold!|last=Chirazi|first=Steffan|date=Spring 1994|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=December 29, 2011}}</ref> and eventually going platinum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unratedmagazine.com/bios/danzig.cfm|title=DANZIG Interview|last=Farr|first=Sara|date=August 2005|publisher=Unrated Magazine|access-date=October 21, 2013}}</ref>

In 1990, Danzig released its second album, ''[[Danzig II: Lucifuge]]''. By 1992, Rubin's involvement with the band had waned. Danzig himself took credit for co-producing the third album, ''[[Danzig III: How the Gods Kill]]''. In the following year, the band released the ''[[Thrall: Demonsweatlive]]'' EP, which contained several live tracks from the band's 1992 Halloween show as well as three new studio tracks. The live version of "[[Mother (Danzig song)|Mother]]", a song from the first album, became popular on [[Album-oriented rock|album-oriented radio stations]] while its music video received considerable attention on [[MTV]]-programmed shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=darticle&f=enter.94|title=Sympathy for the Devil|last=Hajari|first=Nisid|date=October 14, 1994|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|access-date=July 18, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Headbangers Ball- The Unofficial Tribute Site - Episode Database|url=https://www.headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com/episode-database|work=headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com|access-date=July 18, 2021}}</ref> and ''[[120 Minutes]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Danzig Media Apperances [sic&#93;|url=https://www.misfitscentral.com/danzig/media.php|work=misfitscentral.com|access-date=July 18, 2021}}</ref> The band were eventually awarded in the fall of 1994 with two [[RIAA certification|gold album]]s for the exceptional sales of their first record and ''Thrall: Demonsweatlive''.<ref name=Billboard1994>Flick 1994, p. 18.</ref> The renewed popularity of "Mother" not only helped raise Danzig's profile in the music industry, but also saw the band starting to perform at larger venues such as arenas and amphitheaters, which included headlining US tours with bands like [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Kyuss]], [[Type O Negative]], [[Godflesh]] and then-emerging acts [[Korn]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], as well as opening for Metallica and [[Black Sabbath]].<ref name="misfitscentral dates" />

=== "Industrial" era (1994–1999) ===
On October 4, 1994, ''[[Danzig 4]]'' was released. The album sold well, but did not contain a hit on par with the "Mother" single. The album's second single, "Cantspeak", was also a staple in MTV's rotation, but unlike "Mother" failed to appear on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. "Cantspeak" is the band's only single other than "Mother" to chart on Billboard. Amid accusations of unpaid royalties and broken promises, Danzig's relationship with Rubin deteriorated and the band left the record label.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Around this time, the band's lineup began to dissolve as well. First, Chuck Biscuits left the band in the summer of 1994 due to royalty disagreements. According to a special issue of ''[[Kerrang!]]'', former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] turned down an approach by the band. Biscuits was replaced by [[Joey Castillo]], who made his first public appearance as a member of Danzig at an in-store signing the day of the fourth album's release. Coincidentally, Castillo would later replace Grohl in [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. Although the band had toured successfully with its new drummer during the fall and winter of 1994–95, by the spring of 1995 Danzig was actively seeking a new guitarist, with [[Pepper Keenan]] and [[Dez Cadena]] considered possible replacements.<ref name="Seconds">{{cite web|url=http://misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=marticle&f=seconds.97|title=Glenn Danzig|first1=Steven |last1=Blush |author-link1=Steven Blush|date=October 1997|publisher=[[Seconds (magazine)|Seconds]]|access-date=October 3, 2009}}</ref> John Christ and Eerie Von resigned on July 5, 1995.

In October 1996, ''Danzig 5: [[Blackacidevil]]'' was released. The album was mostly a solo effort by Danzig, although [[Jerry Cantrell]] of [[Alice in Chains]] played lead guitar on three of the album's tracks. [[Joey Castillo]] played drums, the sole member still in the band from the 4p Tour. Castillo would record on two more Danzig albums, making him the longest-standing member outside of the original lineup.

For the next few years, Danzig was tied up in a legal battle with Rubin over the rights to unreleased material the band recorded for American Recordings. In November 1999, Danzig ''[[6:66 Satan's Child]]'' was released. A long-planned Samhain box set was also released, followed by a Samhain reunion tour. Samhain opened for Danzig for six weeks during the tour and consisted of Steve Zing and London May switching between bass and drums.

===Return to form (2000–2011)===
[[File:Danzig swedenrock1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Danzig performing in 2010]]

By 2000, Danzig's lineup had stabilized with the addition of guitarist [[Todd Youth]] and bassist [[Howie Pyro]], both veterans of the New York City punk scene. In 2002, this lineup released the album ''Danzig 777: [[I Luciferi]]''. In 2004, Danzig released their eighth studio album, ''[[Circle of Snakes]]'', with the line up featuring [[Tommy Victor]] of [[Prong (band)|Prong]] on guitar, who had toured as a member of Danzig years earlier.

Soon after the album's release, Danzig undertook the Blackest of the Black tour across the United States, replacing ''Circle of Snakes'' drummer Bevan Davies with [[Johnny Kelly]] (of [[Type O Negative]]).

Throughout 2006, Glenn Danzig stated in several interviews that he had grown tired of the touring cycle and did not expect to partake in any more large-scale tours. Instead, Danzig would go on small, localized tours, such as the 10 west coast dates they played for the 2006 Blackest of the Black tour. This tour debuted [[Kenny Hickey]] (of [[Type O Negative]]) as the band's new guitarist, while the East Coast dates saw the addition of former [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] member, [[Steve Zing]] on bass.

In October 2006, Glenn Danzig released ''[[Black Aria II]]'', the follow-up to his solo classical album, ''[[Black Aria]]''. ''Black Aria'' was re-released by Evilive in May 2007. He spent the rest of the year completing the production and packaging of ''[[The Lost Tracks of Danzig]]'', a double CD containing 26 unreleased songs that span the entire Danzig catalog, which was released on July 10, 2007. Danzig has also stated that he plans to record a dark blues album with either [[Jerry Cantrell]] or [[Hank Williams III]].<ref name="ultimate-guitar.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/glenn_danzig_talks_20th_anniversary_tour_future_plans.html |title=Glenn Danzig Talks 20th Anniversary Tour, Future Plans &#124; News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

In August 2008, Glenn Danzig announced that Danzig (the band) would do a 20th-anniversary tour, celebrating the release of their self-titled debut album. This was the band's first full US tour in three years, which also included stops in Canada and Mexico. Also asked in August 2008 if the ninth Danzig album was planned, Glenn Danzig replied:

On December 26, 2009, Danzig performed at the Starland Ballroom in New Jersey. The show was notable for featuring a special appearance by [[Michale Graves]] who, along with [[Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein|Doyle]] and [[Dr. Chud]], performed several songs by the [[Misfits (band)#1996–2000: Reformation and new lineup|reformed version of the Misfits]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crushermagazine.com/features1_10/featdanziglive.htm|title=DANZIG GORGEOUS FRANKENSTEIN WITH MICHALE GRAVES|last=Evans|first=Morgan|publisher=Crusher Magazine|access-date=January 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220145350/http://www.crushermagazine.com/features1_10/featdanziglive.htm|archive-date=February 20, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On March 10, 2010, a Danzig lyric book was released, titled ''Hidden Lyrics of the Left Hand''.<ref name="Danzig lyric book">{{cite web|url=http://www.danzig-verotik.com/danzig/danzig_news.html|title=DANZIG Lyric Book Available Now|publisher=danzig-verotik.com|access-date=March 9, 2010}}</ref> The book contains unreleased song lyrics combined with illustrations by [[Simon Bisley]].<ref name="Danzig lyric book" />

In 2009, movie director [[Todd Phillips]] chose Danzig's song "Thirteen" to open his film ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]''. Danzig later recorded a new song, "Black Hell", to appear in the 2011 sequel, ''[[The Hangover: Part II]]''.

In January 2011, Danzig was announced for the 2011 [[Download 2011|Download Festival]] at Donington Park, England, alongside bands including [[Rob Zombie]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[System of a Down]]. On the first day of the festival, Danzig headlined the Pepsi Max stage. On June 12, 2011, Danzig played at the [[Nova Rock Festival]].

On October 25, 2011, a [[greatest hits]] album entitled ''The Essential Danzig'' was to be released through [[Sony BMG]].<ref>{{cite web |date=August 30, 2011 |title=Danzig to release 'The Essential Danzig'|work=Punknews.org |publisher=Punknews.org |url=http://www.punknews.org/releasedetail/5276 |access-date=August 30, 2011}}</ref> However, as of 2017, this has yet to happen, nor have details of the release been given.

October 2011 also saw a rare string of reunion shows called the "Danzig Legacy" tour. The shows consisted of a Danzig mini-set, followed by a Samhain mini-set, a set of Danzig and Doyle performing Misfits songs, and then ending with three Danzig songs and the performance of "Skulls".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danzig-verotik.com/danzig/tour.html |title=Official Danzig Website |publisher=Danzig-verotik.com |access-date=February 10, 2013}}</ref>

=== Recent activity (2012–present) ===
In May 2012, Danzig released the song "Devil's Angels", the theme from [[Devil's Angels|the 1967 film]] of the same name, from ''[[Skeletons (Danzig album)|Skeletons]]''. "I've wanted to record this song since 1979 and this is exactly the same arrangement I had for it back then, so it pretty much sounds like that late 70s style of mine. I'm really happy with the way it turned out, it actually came out much better than I had hoped it would.
