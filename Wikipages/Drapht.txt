==Biography==
===1982–2002: Early life===
Drapht grew up in [[North Perth, Western Australia]], a suburb of Perth. His father, Gary Ridge, a jazz drummer<ref name="3rd degree">{{Cite web | url = http://3degree.ecu.edu.au/articles/1764 | title = Drapht dominates with debut | publisher = [[Edith Cowan University]] | work = 3rd Degree |date = 22 August 2008 | last = Richardson |first = Fiona | access-date =28 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jazz.org.au/index.php?option=com_mtree&task=viewlink&link_id=176&Itemid=84 |publisher=Jazz Australia | title = Roz Pearson |access-date=28 March 2011}}</ref> introduced Drapht to music from a very young age—he first experienced hip hop at the age of eight. The name "Drapht" is based on a Western Australian [[Swan Brewery]] beer, Swan Draught; the company's logo was written on a watch that his father brought home when Drapht was 13 or 14.<ref name="Riley">{{Cite web|url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-features/artists/2011/03/29/the-life-of-drapht/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324144357/http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-features/artists/2011/03/29/the-life-of-drapht/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 March 2012 |title=Life of Drapht |publisher=The Music Network |last=Greco |first=Nell |date=29 March 2011 |access-date=12 April 2011}}</ref>

Drapht became a vital part of Perth's hip hop crew, Syllabolix, at the age of 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3degree.ecu.edu.au/articles/1764 |title=Drapht dominates with debut|publisher=[[Edith Cowan University]] |last=Richardson|first=Fiona|date=22 August 2008|access-date=16 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedaily.com.au/news/2008/oct/01/rhymes-n-rhythm/ |title=Rhymes 'n' rhythm|publisher=Sunshine Coast Daily|date=1 October 2008|access-date=16 October 2008}}</ref><blockquote>"I was extremely fortunate. Right place, right time. I was right in the middle of it all, I had access to one of the best producers at the time Dazastah, freestyle sessions at [[Hunter (rapper)|Hunter's]] and constant schooling from the rest of the MC's within the crew. So I was very blessed with it all."<small> — Drapht</small>{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}</blockquote>

This involvement resulted in his first contributions being recorded and included on [[Hunter (rapper)|Hunter]] and [[Dazastah]]'s 2000 debut album, ''Done DL'', only months after he had started seriously writing.<ref name="Scribe"/>

===2003–2004: ''Pale Rider'' ===
Drapht's first track, "Misunderstood", was released as part of the ''Culture of Kings – Volume 3'' release in 2003 with Drapht saying "It was a song I wrote in a span of a day or so, and it was just lying around. So I had the opportunity to put it on ''Culture of Kings''.  And then it ended up being the opening track for the release, which was awesome. That definitely helped in the early days of my career."<ref name="Drum">{{cite web|url=http://www.drumperth.com.au|title=Third Time's The Charma|publisher=[[Drum Media]]|last=Schlechte|first=Ted|date=21 August 2008|access-date=31 August 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829034533/http://drumperth.com.au/|archive-date=29 August 2008}}</ref>}}

Aggression was one thing I wanted to rid myself of though, at that time in my life it was my venting process. An angry teen mad a society, and myself. But we live to grow through that."|Drapht (2008)<ref name="Drum"/>}}

===2005–2007: ''Who Am I''===
The follow-up, 2005's ''[[Who Am I (Drapht album)|Who Am I]]'', was co-produced by Dazastah ([[Downsyde]]) and Fdel, and co-mixed by Drapht with Dazastah.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drapht – Who Am I|url=http://www.discogs.com/Drapht-Who-Am-I/release/1790730|publisher=discogs|access-date=14 September 2012|year=2012}}</ref> The songs touch on topics including politics, sex, and addiction to drunken antics.
