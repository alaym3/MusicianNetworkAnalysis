'''Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers''' were a Jamaican-American [[reggae]] family group whose line-up consisted of the children of musicians, [[Bob Marley]] and [[Rita Marley]], which includes lead singer [[Ziggy Marley]] with [[Sharon Marley]], [[Cedella Marley]], and [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]]. Formed in 1979 in [[Brooklyn]], New York, Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers members began their musical endeavors in their pre-teens under the name '''the Melody Makers'''.

Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling fourth album, ''[[Conscious Party]]'', which contained the hit single "Tomorrow People" and the number-one single "Tumblin' Down".<ref name="allmusic2">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ziggy-marley-p101986/charts-awards/billboard-singles Ziggy Marley Billboard Singles]. All Music Guide. Retrieved on 6 January 2012</ref> Their fifth album, ''[[One Bright Day]]'', which contains themes of optimism and self-empowerment, was released in 1989. In 2000, they toured worldwide for the release of their live DVD, ''Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers Live'' (2001). In 1996 they sang the theme song for the animated children's TV series ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]''.

==Recording history==

===1979–1983: Early beginnings and Children Playing in the Streets===
Originally formed at the request of their father, [[Bob Marley]], it was only after his death that the Melody Makers came into their own.<ref name="allmusic">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ziggy-marley-the-melody-makers-p198596/biography Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers]. All Music Guide. Retrieved on 6 January 2012</ref> Their vision, however, is similar to their father's desire to bring people together through music and the Melody Makers' pop-reggae sound has certainly done that. The band is comprised by four of Bob Marley's ten children, vocalist/guitarist [[Ziggy Marley|Ziggy]], vocalist/guitarist/drummer [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen]], vocalist [[Cedella Marley|Cedella]], and vocalist [[Sharon Marley|Sharon]]. As the eldest male, Ziggy is viewed by the press as the group's leader, with Stephen often sharing in the songwriting and lead vocals.<ref name="allmusic"/>

The four siblings initially came together as a musical unit in 1979 to record "Children Playing in the Streets".<ref name="allmusic"/> Bob Marley had composed the song four years earlier for his children and wanted to share this gift with children around the world. All royalties from the single were pledged to the United Nations, to aid its efforts during the International Year of the Child. Ziggy and Stephen performed together at their father's funeral on 21 May 1981, dancing alongside the I-Threes and the Wailers, during their brief homage to the great artist. Later that year, the Melody Makers released their second single, "What a Plot," which, like their debut, appeared on their late father's own [[Tuff Gong]] label.<ref name="allmusic"/> In 1983, the group performed at Reggae Sunsplash, a festival that Ziggy and Stephen were already veterans of, having appeared on-stage there back in 1979 during the Wailers' own set.

===1984–1987: Play the Game Right, name change and subsequent releases===
In 1984, the Melody Makers began a recording session with English producer [[Steve Levine]] that released a single, "Lying in Bed". In 1985, the group released their first album, [[Play the Game Right]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Although accompanied by the Barrett brothers, who were the solid rhythm section for the Wailers, the group's record bore little resemblance to their father's music.

In 1986, Hey World was released and credited to Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers.<ref name="allmusic"/> This album laid the groundwork for the group's fast maturing sound. A phenomenal mix of upbeat pop and heavier roots, cemented by hip electro-production, it was evident that the Melody Makers were no longer in the thrall of their father's music, but had found their own voice. In support of the album, Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers embarked on their first tour, a veritable Tuff Gong roadshow with [[Nadine Sutherland]] and the [[I-Threes]] along as opening acts. The group was well received at the yearly [[Reggae Sunsplash]] in 1986 and 1987.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===1988–1990: Conscious Party, career breakthrough and subsequent releases===
In 1988, the band's popularity was at such a height that they were signed to the international major label [[Virgin Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Later that year, they went into the studio with [[Tina Weymouth]] and [[Chris Franz]] of [[Talking Heads]] to record their third album, ''[[Conscious Party]]''. The album charted at no. 23 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard 200]] and at no. 26 on the [[Billboard charts|R&B Albums]] chart.<ref name="allmusic1">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ziggy-marley-p101986/charts-awards/billboard-albums Ziggy Marley Billboard Albums]. All Music Guide. Retrieved on 6 January 2012</ref> The album spawned the successful single "Tomorrow People", which charted at no. 16 on the [[Billboard charts|Mainstream Rock]] chart and no. 39 on the [[Billboard charts|Hot 100]].<ref name="allmusic2"/> The second single "Tumblin' Down" was also well received charting at no. 1 on [[Billboard charts|Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]] chart and at no. 28 on the [[Billboard charts|Dance Music/Club Play Singles]] charts.<ref name="allmusic2"/> The album received a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy award]] for "Best Reggae Album".

The Melody Makers' follow-up album ''[[One Bright Day]]'', released in 1989. The album charted at no. 26 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard 200]] and at no. 43 on the [[Billboard charts|R&B Albums]] chart.<ref name="allmusic1"/> The single "Look Who's Dancin'" received positive feedback and charted at no. 41 on [[Billboard charts|Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]] chart and at no. 23 on the [[Billboard charts|Dance Music/Club Play Singles]] charts.<ref name="allmusic2"/> The album also spawned the singles "Black My Story (Not History)", "One Bright Day", "Justice", and "When the Lights Gone Out". The album received a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy award]] for "Best Reggae Album".

===1991–1992: Jahmekya===
In 1991, the group released their sixth album, ''[[Jahmekya]]''. Although it brought the Melody Makers their most glowing reviews, the record itself did not begin to equal the sales of their last albums, and their single, "Good Time", barely scraped into the bottom reaches of the charts. The single "Good Time" only charted no. 85 on [[Billboard charts|Hot 100]] charts.<ref name="allmusic2"/> The album charted at no. 3 on the [[Billboard charts|Top World Music Albums]] and at no. 63 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard 200]].<ref name="allmusic1"/> The album also spawned the singles "Rainbow Country", "Kozmic", and "Small People". The album received a Grammy nomination.

===1993–1997: Joy and Blues, Ghetto Youths United, leaving Virgin Records and subsequent releases===
In 1993, the group released their seventh album "[[Joy and Blues]]". The album charted at no. 5 on the [[Billboard charts|Top World Music Albums]] chart, no. 75 on the [[Billboard charts|R&B Albums]] chart, no. 178 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard 200]] chart, and no. 11 on the [[Billboard charts|Top Reggae Albums]] chart.<ref name="allmusic1"/> Returning to their roots with a vengeance, and accompanied by former Wailers' bassist [[Aston Barrett]], the album was their final one for Virgin.

In 1995, the group signed a record deal with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and released "[[Free Like We Want 2 B]]" accompanied by the group's own recording label "Ghetto Youths United". The album charted at no. 170 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard 200]] chart and no. 3 on the [[Billboard charts|Top Reggae Albums]] chart.<ref name="allmusic1"/> The single "Power to Move Ya" charted no. 13 on the [[Billboard charts|Dance Music/Club Play Singles]].<ref name="allmusic2"/>

In 1996 Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers released a song called "Love Power" for the Jim Henson soundtrack movie ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' with the composers Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil [http://www.allmusic.com/album/muppet-treasure-island-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000183957] In that same year, the group performed the theme song to the [[PBS Kids]] series, ''[[Arthur (TV Series)|Arthur]]''.

In early 1997, the group performed at the tribute concert "Marley Magic Live" in [[Central Park]], New York on the Summerstage. They also released their second [[best-of]] album "[[The Best of (1988-1993)]]". Later that year, the group released ninth album "[[Fallen Is Babylon]]". The album only charted no. 3 on the [[Billboard charts|Top Reggae Albums]] chart.<ref name="allmusic1"/> In 1998, the second single "Everyone Wants to Be" charted at no. 16 on the [[Dance Music/Club Play Singles]] chart. The album earned the group their third Grammy award.

===1999–2002: Spirit of Music and final releases===
In 1999, the group released their tenth studio album, "[[Spirit of Music]]". The album peaked at no. 1 on the [[Billboard charts|Top Reggae Albums]] chart.<ref name="allmusic1"/> The album spawned the singles "Higher Vibration", "Jah Will Be Done", and "One Good Spliff". Later that year, the group reunited to perform at the "One Love All-Star Tribute Concert". The concert was recorded and released in the same year and features other performances from [[Rita Marley]], [[Julian Marley]], [[Erykah Badu]], and other artists.

In 2000, the group released their live album "[[Live Vol. 1 (Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers album)|Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers Live, Vol. 1]]", which charted at no. 5 on the [[Billboard charts|Top Reggae Albums]] chart.<ref name="allmusic1"/> In May 2001, the group released a concert DVD "Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers Live".

Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers were often compared to their father's group [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]], a Jamaican reggae group. Jo-Ann Greene of All Music Guide stated, "The Melody Makers had a breezy pop style, and while it was impossible not to hear Bob in Ziggy's vocals, this only emphasized the incredible emotional qualities of his own voice."<ref name="allmusic"/>
