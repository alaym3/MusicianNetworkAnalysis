==Music career==

===2007–2008: Formation as UFO {{anchor|ufo}}===
[[Oritsé Williams]] decided to get into the music business mainly because his mother has [[Multiple sclerosis]] and he wanted to raise money to help find a cure. He was originally scouted for a number of boy bands but did not feel they were right and believed that a group should have a "real" connection with each other, like his heroes [[Four Tops]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Williams decided to form his own boy band and, through friends, met [[Marvin Humes]] who had experience in R&B and pop music, being a part of [[VS (band)|VS]] in 2004.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Next to join was [[Aston Merrygold]], who was once cast in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] children's programme ''[[Fun Song Factory]]'', because of his athletic ability.<ref name=retford>[http://www.thisisretford.co.uk/news/Family-cheer-X-Factor-star/article-569530-detail/article.html Family cheer on X Factor star] Retford Times, 24 December 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713054606/http://www.thisisretford.co.uk/news/Family-cheer-X-Factor-star/article-569530-detail/article.html |date=13 July 2010 }}</ref> Last to join the group was [[#JB Gill|JB Gill]], for his "musical ear" and harmonies.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} They bonded, became friends and together they were called '''UFO''' (an initialism of '''Unique Famous Outrageous'''). They signed to [[Tracklacers]] developing a sound they then called "Jack the Lad Swing", combining the phrase "Jack the lad" and the urban music of [[new jack swing]]. While working their way into the music business, UFO instantly signed to [[Epic Records]], before winning their first award in late 2007 at the [[Urban Music Awards]] for Best Unsigned Act thanks to their [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] of "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]" by [[Ben E. King]] and "[[Beautiful Girls (Sean Kingston song)|Beautiful Girls]]" by [[Sean Kingston]]. Shortly thereafter, they released their second single, "Slap Ya Elbow".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbmPexKjpWg | title = UFO / JLS Stand By Me Beautiful Girl Music Video By Kimberley Sterling Dec 2007 – YouTube| website = [[YouTube]]}}</ref> The group give credit to 'DJ Triz' who produced one of UFO's first songs and helped them write it.

===2008–2009: ''The X Factor'' and new name===
In 2008, UFO auditioned for the [[The X Factor (British series 5)|fifth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'', but had to change their name because it was already being used by [[UFO (band)|another group]], so they decided to go with the name '''JLS''' (an initialism of Jack the Lad Swing, the style created with Tracklacers some months back). Following the elimination of girl groups [[Bad Lashes]] and [[Girlband (English band)|Girlband]] in weeks one and two respectively, JLS were [[Louis Walsh]]'s last remaining act in the competition, but throughout the live shows the judges called them the best band to come out of ''The X Factor''. In week 7, JLS were in the bottom two along with [[Rachel Hylton]]. However, they survived thanks to votes from Walsh, [[Cheryl Cole]] and [[Simon Cowell]]. Cowell stated when deliberating that JLS did not deserve to be in the bottom two.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://xfactor.itv.com/2008/stories/story-detail/item_100434.html | title = Rachel is Out! | publisher = ITV | date = 22 November 2008 | access-date = 5 October 2009}}</ref> In the quarter-final, JLS performed "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]" and received negative comments from two of the four judges, with Cowell saying "at the moment you're out", but after their second performance, "[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]", Cowell commented that they were "back in the race" and that they could "have a hit record" with the performance.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://xfactor.itv.com/2008/stories/story-detail/item_100471.html | title = JLS get rocky reviews | publisher = ITV | date = 29 November 2008 | access-date = 5 October 2009}}</ref>

In the semi-final, JLS performed "[[Umbrella (song)|Umbrella]]" and "[[I'm Already There]]". Cowell then predicted they would win the competition.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://xfactor.itv.com/2008/stories/story-detail/item_100514.html | title = Simon says JLS could win the whole show! | publisher = ITV | date = 6 December 2008 | access-date = 5 October 2009}}</ref> They made it to the final and performed their own version of the winner's song, "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]", which the other finalist [[Alexandra Burke]] also performed. The public voted for the second time that night and Burke won the competition, JLS coming second. They were the fourth band to make the final. JLS's manager thought the band would be well suited to [[Epic Records]], with whom they signed a record contract in January 2009.<ref name="hitq">{{cite web | url = http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JoCharrington_int.html | title = Interview with Jo Charrington | publisher = [[HitQuarters]] | date = 29 November 2010 | access-date = 2 December 2010}}</ref>

===2009–2010: ''JLS''===
As soon as the contract was signed, Epic A&Rs [[Nick Raphael]] and [[Jo Charrington]] began album preparation by contacting the pop songwriters and producers who they thought to be the best in the industry. These included [[Steve Mac]], [[Wayne Hector]], [[J.R. Rotem]] and [[DEEKAY]].<ref name="hitq"/> When they went to see Mac he played them "[[Beat Again]]", a song he had written with Hector, and the pair enthusiastically agreed that it was perfect for JLS. Charrington said: "Once you've got that special song everything else seems to fall into place."<ref name="hitq"/> The song was released as the debut single in July, only six months after the band had signed with the label. It reached No. 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 19 July 2009.<ref name="bbcbeatagain" /> On 9 November 2009 JLS released their eponymously titled debut album, ''[[JLS (album)|JLS]]''.<ref name="Digital Spy">{{cite web | url = http://www.jlsofficial.com/newsdiary/post/aston-gets-excited-single-is-out-now/ | title = Aston Gets Excited Single is Out Now | access-date = 6 November 2009 | date = 2 November 2009 | work = [[Digital Spy]] | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100522181832/http://www.jlsofficial.com/newsdiary/post/aston-gets-excited-single-is-out-now | archive-date = 22 May 2010 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> The album debuted at No. 1 on the UK Album Chart, selling over 1 million copies and named the sixth best selling album in the UK during 2009, only being released for 8 weeks before the list was compiled.

Due to the success of their album, the group went on their first headline tour, with twenty-five dates around the UK and Ireland. The group also became the first ''The X Factor'' contestants to win a BRIT Award in 2010, winning the British Breakthrough and Best British Single for "Beat Again". [[Jay-Z]] predicted that they would become as big as [['N Sync]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a203875/jay-z-jls-will-be-as-big-as-n-sync.html | title = Jay-Z: 'JLS will be as big as N Sync' | access-date = 28 October 2010 | date = 18 February 2010 | publisher = M&G Online}}</ref>

==Other ventures==
===Television appearances===
As well as appearing on numerous TV programmes for promotion of their albums/singles, JLS have had two special TV shows of their own broadcast. The first was an hour-long documentary for [[ITV2]], titled ''JLS Revealed'', which first aired on 7 November 2009. The documentary followed them in the year after they had finished second in ''The X Factor'', capturing them as they toured with [[Lemar]], released their singles and attended the [[MOBO Awards]] amongst other highlights. The second show was an hour-long entertainment show for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] titled ''This Is JLS'', which first aired on 11 December 2010 before the first show of that year's ''[[The X Factor (UK series 7)|X Factor]]'' final. Filmed before a live studio audience, the band performed all of their hits, tracks from the ''[[Outta This World]]'' album and a special duet with [[Kylie Minogue]] on her hit song "[[All the Lovers]]", as well as partaking in surprise hidden camera stunts for lucky fans who had been invited to be in the audience for the show.

The group have also released their own documentary film titled ''JLS: Eyes Wide Open 3D'', making them the first British music act to release a 3D film. Filmed at [[The O2 Arena]] during the tour for their second album ''[[Outta This World]]'' in December 2010/January 2011, and incorporated with documentary footage shot by Ben Winston and [[Andy Morahan]], it was shown exclusively for three days only from 3 June 2011 in over 300 UK cinemas. Due to many cinemas selling out tickets for the initial weekend, additional screenings were made in cinemas for the following weekend from 10 June 2011, thus, more tickets were available to buy online or on the day of screening. It opened at number 5 in the UK Box Office chart, raking in £463,914 from three June weekend screenings alone. A DVD of the film was released on 5 December 2011. JLS also created a one-off Christmas special TV programme called ''A Very JLS Christmas'', in which various celebrities appeared such as [[Alesha Dixon]].

On 28 June 2013, JLS appeared on ''[[The Million Pound Drop]]'', playing for charity.

He also attended Larmenier Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School and Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Williams dreamed of being a solo artist from a very young age. He was recruited for many boy bands but believed that a good boy band had to have a good bond between the members. He decided to put together his own boy band, UFO, who later changed their name to JLS (there was another British rock band already called UFO). He also wrote the song "[[Wow Oh Wow]]" for [[Jedward]].

On 28 September 2013, Williams won the first series of the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] dancing show ''[[Stepping Out (UK TV series)|Stepping Out]]'', hosted by [[Davina McCall]].

Williams released his debut single "Waterline" featuring [[Pusha T]] in June 2015.

'''Jonathan Benjamin "JB" Gill''' (born 7 December 1986) is the son of Cynthia and Keith Gill, and has one brother called Neequaye. Gill spent the first five years of his life living in [[Antigua]], discovering his musical talent at a very early age. After completing his exams at university, he decided to audition for ''The X Factor'' in 2008. It was at this point that he came into contact with the other members of JLS. Gill grew up, mostly, in [[Croydon]] and began making music at the age of seven when he played the recorder, piano, flute and guitar. At the age of nine, he joined the choir and went on to perform at the local church. Gill concentrated on his music and began studying at The [[Centre for Young Musicians]] (CYM).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jlsofficial.com/gb/biography/jls/ | title = JLS - All the latest official news - JLS | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120513120339/http://www.jlsofficial.com/gb/biography/jls/ | archive-date = 13 May 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref>

After leaving the CYM, Gill stayed involved with the school music scene. He was involved with the choir at school. He continued this until he was 15 but had to give it up due to the pressures from the school to concentrate on his rugby career; he was involved with [[London Irish]] rugby club until he was 18. Gill eventually decided that he wanted to sing rather than play rugby and melon took up [[vocal coach]]ing during a year out before attending university. During this period, Gill was contacted by Oritse to try out for the band because of his musical ear and attention to harmonies. He studied theology at [[King's College London]], staying in halls in Russell Square, before dropping out to pursue a music career.

In December 2012, he won [[Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Specials#2012|the Christmas Special edition]] of the BBC program ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', performing the Jive with [[Ola Jordan]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = Christmas Special 2012, Series 10, Strictly Come Dancing - BBC One | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pkjn5 | publisher = BBC | access-date = 21 December 2015 | date = 25 December 2012}}</ref> Gill is now an owner of a farm in Scotland and he will take a pause from music and start a different life as a farmer.<ref>{{cite news | title = 'JLS' JB Gill To Focus on Farming in the Wake of Band's Split Announcement' | url = http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/jls/news/jb-gill-farming-break-up/ | access-date = 17 November 2013 | newspaper = Capital FM | date = 25 April 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, JB collaborated with DJ and music producer [[Charlie Hedges]] to release his debut solo single "Best Night of My Life",<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-04-17|title=Charlie Hedges Spotlight - Interview WIth The Kiss FM Presenter and DJ|url=https://theldndiaries.com/interview-charlie-hedges/|access-date=2021-04-02|website=The LDN Diaries|language=en-GB}}</ref> making him the first member of JLS to release solo material.

In late 2008, Gill began dating backing dancer Chloe Tangney. In January 2014, the couple announced their engagement and married on 3 May 2014. On 19 September 2014, the couple welcomed a baby boy, Ace Jeremiah Gill. In July 2018, their daughter Chiara Sapphire Gill was born.

He now presents a television show on children's channel CBeebies, called 'Down on the Farm'.

===Aston Merrygold===
{{Main|Aston Merrygold}}
'''Aston Iain Merrygold''' (born 13 February 1988 in [[Peterborough]], England) was born to a Jamaican father and an Anglo-Irish mother. He is one of seven children; he has five brothers and one sister.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} He was born and raised in Peterborough, where he attended [[Jack Hunt School]].<ref>Briggs, Stephen [https://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/features/39I-always-knew-Aston-had.4813299.jp I always knew Aston had the X Factor] Peterborough Evening Telegraph, 22 December 2008</ref> In 2002, Merrygold entered ''[[Stars in Their Eyes]]'' where he appeared as [[Michael Jackson]], singing "[[Rockin' Robin (song)|Rockin' Robin]]" and finished in second place. He came in second yet again with JLS on ''The X Factor'' at age 20. Aston performed in school productions and, after leaving school in 2004, was cast in a new [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme, ''[[Fun Song Factory]]'' alongside children's TV presenter [[Laura Hamilton]]. In the show, Merrygold played the character "Cookie".<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.thisisretford.co.uk/news/Family-cheer-X-Factor-star/article-569530-detail/article.html Family cheer on X Factor star] Retfordo Times, 24 December 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713054606/http://www.thisisretford.co.uk/news/Family-cheer-X-Factor-star/article-569530-detail/article.html |date=13 July 2010 }}</ref> Whilst still attending secondary school, he played [[Association football|football]] on behalf of England in the European Youth Games.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} His initial aspiration was to play football professionally. However, after developing a nerve problem in his left foot, he tried singing and acting instead. Through acting, he met Humes. As a result, he received a call from Williams (an acquaintance of Humes) about joining a boy band.

Aston worked on his debut solo album Showstopper for a planned mid-2016 release, but it remains unreleased. The lead single of the album, "Get Stupid" was released on 24 July 2015.

In August 2017, Merrygold was announced as a contestant for the fifteenth series of [[Strictly Come Dancing]]. Merrygold was eliminated on 5 November 2017, coming in tenth place.

In December 2018, Aston reunited with dance partner Janette Manrara for Strictly's Christmas Special. The pair went on to perform the Jive to Cee Lo Green's What Christmas Means to Me. Merrygold scored a perfect score of 40 and the pair won the TV special.

He is engaged to dancer Sarah Lou Richards and their son, Grayson Jax Merrygold was born on 30 January 2018.
