'''Ivo Livi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈiːvo ˈliːvi}}), better known as '''Yves Montand''' ({{IPA-fr|iv mɔ̃tɑ̃|lang}}; 13 October 1921 – 9 November 1991), was an Italian-French actor and singer.

==Early life==
Montand was born Ivo Livi in [[Monsummano Terme]], Italy, to Giovanni Livi, a broom manufacturer,<ref name="bookref1"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20111346,00.html|journal=People|date=25 November 1991|volume=36|issue=20|title=Adieu, Yves|author=Rosen, Marjorie}}</ref> and Giuseppina Simoni, a devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], while her husband held strong [[Communism|Communist]] beliefs.<ref name="bookref1">{{cite book|last=Montand|first=Yves|author2=Hervé Hamon|author3=Patrick Rotman|title=You see, I haven't forgotten|publisher=Knopf|year=1992|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780679410126/page/4 4–30]|isbn=0679410120|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780679410126/page/4}}</ref> Montand's family left for France in 1923 because of Italy's Fascist regime.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/05/arts/yves-montand-from-the-music-hall-to-the-met.html?&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|title=Yves Montand – From The Music Hall to the Met|first=Moira|last=Hodgson|date=5 September 1982}}</ref> He grew up in [[Marseille]], where, as a young man, he worked in his sister's beauty salon (Salon de Coiffure), and later on the docks. He began a career in show business as a [[music-hall]] singer. In 1944, he was discovered by [[Édith Piaf]] in Paris and she made him part of her act.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Career==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}
Montand achieved international recognition as a singer and actor, starring in many films. His recognizably [[crooner]] songs, especially those about Paris, became instant classics. He was one of the best known performers at [[Bruno Coquatrix]]'s [[Paris Olympia]] music hall, and toured with musicians including [[Didi Duprat]]. In October 1947, he sang "[[What Can I Do? (Édith Piaf song)|Mais qu'est-ce que j'ai ?]]" (music by [[Henri Betti]] and lyrics by [[Édith Piaf]]) at the Théâtre de l'Étoile. Betti also asked him to sing "[[C'est si bon]]" but Montand refused. Following the success of the recording of this song by the Sœurs Étienne in 1948, he decided to record it. Montand was also very popular in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where he did a concert tour in 1956-57.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Oiva|first=Mila|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-69048-9|title=Yves Montand in the USSR: Cultural Diplomacy and Mixed Messages|last2=Salmi|first2=Hannu|last3=Johnson|first3=Bruce|date=2021|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-030-69047-2|location=Cham|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-69048-9}}</ref>

During his career, Montand acted in American motion pictures as well as on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. He was nominated for a [[César Award]] for Best Actor in 1980 for ''I comme Icare'' and again in 1984 for ''Garçon!'' In 1986, after his international box-office draw power had fallen off considerably, the 65-year-old Montand gave one of his best remembered performances, as the scheming uncle in ''[[Jean de Florette]]'', co-starring [[Gérard Depardieu]], and ''[[Manon des Sources (1986 film)|Manon des Sources]]'' (both 1986), co-starring [[Emmanuelle Béart]]. The film was a worldwide critical hit and revived Montand's profile in the US, where he made an appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Late Night with David Letterman (a Guest Stars & Air Dates Guide)|url=http://epguides.com/LateNightwithDavidLetterman/|access-date=14 May 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1951, he married [[Simone Signoret]], and they co-starred in several films throughout their careers. The marriage was, by all accounts, fairly harmonious, lasting until her death in 1985, although Montand had a number of well-publicized affairs, notably with [[Marilyn Monroe]], with whom he starred in one of her last films, ''[[Let's Make Love]]''. He was the stepfather to Signoret's daughter from her prior marriage, [[Catherine Allégret]].

Montand's only child, Valentin, his son by his second wife, Carole Amiel, was born in 1988. In a paternity suit that rocked France, another woman accused Montand of being the father of her daughter and went to court to obtain a [[DNA]] sample from him. Montand refused, but the woman persisted even after his death. In a court ruling that made international headlines, the woman won the right to have Montand exhumed and a sample taken.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/12/news/mn-28204 |title=Body of Entertainer Montand Exhumed|work=Los Angeles Times |date=12 March 1998|access-date=20 August 2012}}</ref> The results indicated that he was probably not the girl's biological father.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1VqqZE79PoC&pg=PT272|title=Contested Paternity: Constructing Families in Modern France |page=272  |author=Rachel G. Fuchs|publisher=JHU Press|year= 2008|isbn=978-0801898167 }}</ref>

He supported left-wing causes during the 1950s and 1960s, and attended [[Communist]] festivals and meetings. In later life he supported right-wing causes.<ref>{{cite web | title=French Actress Simone Signoret Dies at 64 | website=Los Angeles Times | date=1985-10-01 | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-10-01-mn-19173-story.html | access-date=2021-11-17}}</ref>

Signoret and Montand had a home in [[Autheuil-Authouillet]], Normandy, where the main village street is named after him.

In his later years he maintained a home in [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]], Provence, until his death from a heart attack in November 1991.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0598971/bio Yves Montand]. Internet Movie Database</ref> In an interview, [[Jean-Jacques Beineix]] said, "[H]e died on the set [of ''IP5: The Island of Pachyderms'']... On the very last day, after his very last shot. It was the very last night and we were doing retakes. He finished what he was doing and then he just died. And the film tells the story of an old man who dies from a heart attack, which is the same thing that happened!"<ref>[http://www.videobusiness.com/blog/1740000174/post/370045237.html "The Return of Jean-Jacques Beineix, Pt. II"], ''Video Business'', 5 June 2009. Retrieved 17 June 2009.</ref> Montand is interred next to his first wife, [[Simone Signoret]], in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.

In 2004, Catherine Allégret, Signoret's daughter from her first marriage to director [[Yves Allégret]], alleged in her autobiography ''Un monde a l'envers'' (''A World Upside Down'') that she had been sexually abused by her stepfather from the age of five; his behaviour apparently continuing for many years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bremne|first=Charles|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/actress-says-cinema-idol-stepfather-abused-her-25900219.html|title=Actress says cinema idol stepfather abused her|work=[[Irish Independent]]|agency=The Times (London)|date=30 September 2004|access-date=20 November 2013}}</ref> and that he had a "more than equivocal attitude to her" as she got older.<ref>[http://o.nouvelobs.com/people/20040929.OBS8018/catherine-allegret-detaille-ses-relations-avec-montand.html Catherine Allegret details her relations with Montand] ''L'Obs'', 1 October 2004 ('''French'''); retrieved 19 October 2017</ref> However she also claimed to have been reconciled to him in the latter years of his life.<ref>[http://www.psychologies.com/Moi/Epreuves/Deuil/Articles-et-Dossiers/Catherine-Allegret-Cette-verite-c-est-a-moi-de-la-dire Interview with Catherin Allegret] ''Psychologie'', October 2004 ('''French'''); retrieved 19 October 2017</ref>
