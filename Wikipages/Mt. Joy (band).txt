== History ==
=== 2016–2017: Origins ===
Having first met in high school in Philadelphia, PA, Matt Quinn and Sam Cooper reunited in Los Angeles in 2016 and began working on music. Says Quinn, "It was just one of those cool, serendipitous life moments where a person that I’d been making music with in high school ended up in the same city as me, and I didn’t really know anybody else ... Just because we love music we were getting together and writing together."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vaildaily.com/entertainment/mt-joy-talks-quick-assention-to-indie-folk-popularity-ahead-of-belly-up-show/|title=Mt.

Joy's Matt Quinn and Sam Cooper just 'normal people and good folks'|date=March 28, 2018}}</ref> The two recorded the single "Astrovan" with the help of future bandmate bassist Michael Byrnes, who they met on [[Craigslist]], and Byrnes' then-roommate producer Caleb Nelson, in April of that year and released the song in September.<ref name="Success" />

The single's rapid streaming success, as well as the success of their second single "Sheep", drew the three to add drummer Sotiris Eliopoulos and keyboardist Jackie Miclau to the group, together playing [[Bonnaroo]], [[Newport Folk Festival]], and [[Lollapalooza]], as well as opening for bands such as [[The Head and the Heart]], [[The Shins]], [[Whitney (band)|Whitney]], and [[The Revivalists]]. In 2017, Mt. Joy signed to Dualtone Records.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Rau|first=Nate|title=Dualtone: The scrappy label that discovered The Lumineers strikes gold again with Mt.

Leading up to the release of their sophomore album, ''Rearrange Us'', life became increasingly different with the spread of COVID-19. In a social media post,<ref name=":1" /> Mt. Joy shared that their original hopes were that "music could create a welcome distraction from reality ... " However, just a few weeks before the release of the album, the [[murder of George Floyd]] took place in Minneapolis on May 25. With [[George Floyd protests|nationwide protests]] demanding justice against police brutality and racial inequality, Mt. Joy reminded followers to "listen to and amplify black voices, learn, protest peacefully, and put your money where your mouth is." Concluding the post, Mt. Joy announced that "100% of album profits from the first week will be donated to Campaign Zero, a nonprofit dedicated to ending police violence."

Additionally, Mt. Joy serves as an ambassador for nonpartisan voter registration organisation, HeadCount. On October 30, 2020, the band released their single "New President" before the November 3rd, 2020, election encouraging fans to vote for Joe Biden.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-30|title=Today's Song: Mt.
