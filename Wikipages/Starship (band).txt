'''Starship''' is an American [[Band (rock and pop)|rock band]] from [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Initially a continuation of [[Jefferson Starship]], it underwent a change in musical direction, the subsequent loss of personnel, and a lawsuit settlement that led to a name change. Starship's 1985 album, ''[[Knee Deep in the Hoopla]]'', was certified [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[RIAA]], and included two singles that went to number one on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] chart: "[[We Built This City]]" and "[[Sara (Starship song)|Sara]]".<ref name="AllMusicStarshipBio"/> Their follow up album, ''[[No Protection (Starship album)|No Protection]]'', released in 1987, was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and featured the band's third number one single, "[[Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now]]".<ref name="AllMusicStarshipBio"/> After a short hiatus in the early 1990s, the band was revived in 1992 as ''Starship featuring Mickey Thomas''.

===1984–1988: Origins, ''Knee Deep in the Hoopla'', and ''No Protection''===
[[File:Grace and Mickey Onstage '80s (Dave Cackowski).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Grace Slick and Mickey Thomas onstage in 1985]]
In June 1984, [[Paul Kantner]], the last remaining founding member of [[Jefferson Airplane]], left [[Jefferson Starship]]. In October 1984, Kantner took legal action over the Jefferson Starship name against his former bandmates. In March 1985, Kantner settled out of court and signed an agreement that neither party would use the names "Jefferson" or "Airplane" unless all members of Jefferson Airplane Inc. ([[Bill Thompson (manager)|Bill Thompson]], Paul Kantner, [[Grace Slick]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], and [[Jack Casady]]) agreed. Jefferson Starship briefly performed as "Starship Jefferson" while legal proceedings occurred, before settling on the shortened name "Starship".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tamarkin|first=Jeff|year=2003|title=Got a Revolution!: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster#Adult publishing|Atria]]|location=[[New York City]]|page=330|isbn=0-671-03403-0|ref=Tamarkin}}</ref>

[[David Freiberg]] stayed with the band after the lawsuit and attended the first studio sessions for the next album, ''[[Knee Deep in the Hoopla]]''. He became frustrated with the sessions because all the keyboard work in the studio was being done by [[Peter Wolf (producer)|Peter Wolf]] (who had played on the sessions for ''[[Nuclear Furniture]]'' and briefly joined the band on the road for the follow-up tour) and that was the instrument Freiberg was supposed to be playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penncen.com/quicksilver/freiberg/interview.html |title=David Freiberg Interview |last=Barthel |first=John |date=September 4, 1997|quote=Well, because they want me in, and I didn't want to be there because they were doing 'We Built This City' and all.

The first was "[[We Built This City]]", written by [[Bernie Taupin]], [[Martin Page]], Dennis Lambert, and [[Peter Wolf (producer)|Peter Wolf]] and was engineered by Grammy-winning producer [[Bill Bottrell]] and arranged by Bottrell and [[Jasun Martz]]; the second was "[[Sara (Starship song)|Sara]]". The album itself reached No. 7, went platinum, and spawned two more singles: "Tomorrow Doesn't Matter Tonight" (#26), and "Before I Go" (#68). The band had not had a number-one hit record since previous incarnation Jefferson Starship released ''[[Red Octopus]]'' in 1975.

In 1986, the group recorded "Cut You Down to Size" for the film ''[[Youngblood (1986 film)|Youngblood]]''. By the time the 1987 sessions for ''[[No Protection (Starship album)|No Protection]]'' began, bassist [[Pete Sears]] had left the band.<ref name="Ultimate Classic Rock"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/PROFILE-Pete-Sears-Starship-veteran-back-on-2871115.php|title=Profile-Pete Sears-Starship Veteran Back on Course-Keyboardist's New CD Features All-star Support|first=Joel|last=Selvin|date=October 8, 2001|website=[[SFGate.com]]|access-date=November 23, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210214041231/https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/PROFILE-Pete-Sears-Starship-veteran-back-on-2871115.php|archive-date=February 14, 2021|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Sears went on to play keyboards with former Jefferson Airplane members Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady in [[Hot Tuna]] for ten years. In early 1987, "[[Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now]]", recorded while Sears was still with the band, appeared in the film ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' and hit No. 1. At that time, the song made Slick the oldest female vocalist to sing on a number-one [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit, at the age of 47 (she held this record until [[Cher]] broke it at the age of 52, in 1999 with "[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]"). ''No Protection'' was released in 1987, and also featured the singles "It's Not Over ('Til It's Over)" (#9), and "Beat Patrol" (#46). The last song on the album, "Set the Night to Music", would later become a hit in 1991, re-recorded as a duet by [[Roberta Flack]] and [[Maxi Priest]]. Following the completion of the album sessions in 1987, Brett Bloomfield was brought in to replace Sears and [[Mark Morgan (composer)|Mark Morgan]] joined the band on keyboards.

Slick left Starship in February 1988, going on to join the reformed Jefferson Airplane for [[Jefferson Airplane (album)|an album]] and tour in 1989, before retiring from music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution!: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster#Adult publishing|Atria]]|location=[[New York City]]|page=339|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref><ref name="AllMusic-GraceSlick">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/grace-slick-mn0000194743/biography|title=Grace Slick Artist Biography|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 23, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412221434/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/grace-slick-mn0000194743/biography|archive-date=April 12, 2020|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="H-Courant">{{cite news |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1995-02-16-9502160034-story.html |title=Starship's Enterprises |last=Catlin |first=Roger |newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]] |location=Hartford, CT|date=February 16, 1995 |access-date=November 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210708073841/https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1995-02-16-9502160034-story.html |archive-date=July 8, 2021 |url-status=live |language=en-US |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As Kantner, Sears and Freiberg had left the band, all the new and remaining members were more than a decade younger than she was.

===1988–1992: ''Love Among the Cannibals'' and inactivity===
With Thomas the sole lead singer, the revamped lineup recorded ''[[Love Among the Cannibals]]'' from 1988 to 1989, and it was released in August 1989. The song "It's Not Enough" peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.<ref name="Cannibals-AllMusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/love-among-the-cannibals-mw0000653742 |title=Love Among the Cannibals - Starship &#124; AllMusic |first=Joe |last=Viglione |work=AllMusic |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920061836/http://www.allmusic.com/album/love-among-the-cannibals-mw0000653742 |archive-date=September 20, 2013 |url-status=live |language=en-US |df=mdy-all }}</ref> "Wild Again" (which reached No. 73 on the ''Billboard'' singles chart) was also used in the film ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''. The band went on another tour to support the album; recruiting backing singers Christina Marie Saxton and Melisa Kary to fill the gap left by Slick's departure. On September 24, 1989, while the band was in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] for a show, Baldwin and Thomas got into a violent altercation during which Thomas was seriously injured and required [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|facial surgery]], and three titanium plates implanted in his skull.<ref name="AllMusicStarshipBio"/><ref name="UCR-StarshipFight">{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/starship-mickey-thomas-fight/|title=How a Brutal Fight Changed Starship Forever|first=Nick|last=Deriso|date=September 24, 2015|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|publisher=Loudwire|access-date=February 19, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210219062929/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/starship-mickey-thomas-fight/|archive-date=February 19, 2021|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Baldwin resigned from the band immediately afterward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinij.com/article/zz/20120518/NEWS/120518623|title=Lib at Large: Mickey Thomas and the mutinous Jefferson Starship|last=Liberatore|first=Paul|work=[[Marin Independent Journal]]|publisher=MediaNews Group|date=May 18, 2013|access-date=April 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910015432/https://www.marinij.com/2012/05/18/lib-at-large-mickey-thomas-and-the-mutinous-jefferson-starship/|archive-date=September 10, 2018|url-status=dead|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The remainder of the tour was postponed until Thomas had recovered and was able to tour again.

After Thomas was well enough to tour, the band continued to tour in support of ''Cannibals''.

In May 1991, RCA assembled a compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (Ten Years and Change 1979–1991)]]''. The collection also included two new tracks, "[[Don't Lose Any Sleep]]" with Thomas and Chaquico (recorded before Chaquico had left) and "Good Heart" (#81) with Thomas, Wolf, and session musicians. A third track originally recorded during this time period, "Keys to the City", was released in October 2012 on the album ''Playlist: The Very Best of Starship''. Shortly after the release of the 1991 greatest hits album, manager Bill Thompson decided to fire the group and told RCA that the band was done making records.<ref name="AllMusicGreatestHitsTYAC">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-ten-years-and-change-1979-1991-mw0000690419|title=AllMusic Starship Greatest Hits: Ten Years and Change 1979-1991|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824145145/http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-ten-years-and-change-1979-1991-mw0000690419|archive-date=August 24, 2017|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Tamarakin 2003"/> The band was let go by RCA,<ref name="Tamarakin 2003"/> and Starship became inactive.<ref name="AllMusicStarshipBio"/>
