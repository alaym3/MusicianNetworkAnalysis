'''Anjunabeats''' {{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|dʒ|uː|n|ə|b|iː|t|s}} is a British record label started by producers Jonathan "Jono" Grant and Paavo Siljamäki of [[Above & Beyond (band)|Above & Beyond]] in 2000. Initially exclusively a [[trance music]] label, around 2011 Anjunabeats started releasing primarily trance-edged [[house music|house]].<ref>Kate Wilson (27 April 2017).

==History==
In 2000, Anjunabeats released its first 12" record, titled Volume One, which was released under Grant and Siljamäki's alias ''Anjunabeats''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://open.spotify.com/album/2SFhPSu0wyGWptonmsC08g |title=Volume One by Anjunabeats on Spotify |website=Apple Music |access-date=11 May 2020 |archive-date=12 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812193030/https://open.spotify.com/album/2SFhPSu0wyGWptonmsC08g |url-status=live }}</ref> As the label got the name Anjunabeats, they decided to produce under different aliases, such as Free State and Dirt Devils. They were soon joined by [[Tony McGuinness (English musician)|Tony McGuinness]] in 2000 after he was asked to collaborate on a remix of [[Chakra (trance duo)]] ‘Home’ and formed [[Above & Beyond (band)|Above & Beyond]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-07-19|title=Above & Beyond|url=https://www.arizonafoothillsmagazine.com/aznightlife/above-beyond/|access-date=2021-04-18|website=Nightlife|language=en-US|archive-date=18 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418212613/https://www.arizonafoothillsmagazine.com/aznightlife/above-beyond/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2005, Above & Beyond launched the sub-label Anjunadeep aimed at releases that don't fit under the main label's trance focus, allowing more diversity within Anjunabeats.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anjunadeep: The Tastemaking Dance Label With 'Down to Earth' Fans|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8549685/anjunadeep-dance-label-interview-james-grant|date=6 February 2020|website=Billboard|access-date=26 May 2020|archive-date=14 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200214114434/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8549685/anjunadeep-dance-label-interview-james-grant|url-status=live}}</ref> The trio also launched 2 other sub-labels, ''Anjunadigital'' that deals with special remixes and releases of Anjunabeats and Anjunadeep tracks, and ''Hard On Recordings'' that was active from 2000 to 2004 and focused on [[hard trance]] and [[hard house]].<ref>discogs.com: [https://www.discogs.com/label/7834-Hard-On-Recordings Hard On Recordings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115224224/https://www.discogs.com/label/7834-Hard-On-Recordings |date=15 November 2016 }} on [[Discogs]].
