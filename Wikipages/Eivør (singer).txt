'''Eivør Pálsdóttir''' (pronounced {{IPA-fo|ˈaivœɹ ˈpɔlsˌdœʰtəɹ|}}; born 21 July 1983), known mononymously as '''Eivør''', is a [[Faroese people|Faroese]] singer-songwriter and actress. Born and raised in [[Syðrugøta]], she had her first televised performance  at the age of 13. Over the course of her decades-long career, her musical output has spanned a wide range of genres such as [[Folk music|folk]], [[art pop]], [[jazz]], [[folk rock]], [[Classical music|classical]] and [[electronica]].

==Career==
In 1999, at the age of 15, she became the lead singer in Clickhaze. The following year, she released her first self-titled album, ''Eivør Pálsdóttir''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eivor.com/index.php?id=4|title=EIVOR.COM discography|access-date=16 December 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68HOh4zfG?url=http://eivor.sweetgiggles.net/?id=4|archive-date=9 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2001, Clickhaze won the Prix Føroyar song contest. She moved to [[Reykjavík]] in 2002 to study music, releasing an album with the music ensemble [[Yggdrasil (band)|Yggdrasil]] the same year.

After her second solo album, ''Krákan'', was released in 2003, she was nomiated in three categories at the [[Icelandic Music Award]]s, winning ''Best Singer'' and ''Best Performer'' – normally only won by Icelandic artists.

In 2003, she participated in [[Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003|Söngvakeppni Sjónvarpsins]] with the song ''"Í Nótt"''.

In 2004, Eivør was named ''Arsins Føroyingur'' (Faroe Islander of the Year).

In 2005, the [[DR Big Band]] released its 40th anniversary album, with all songs written and sung by Eivør. The same year, she was awarded the Icelandic ''Gríma'' award for composing and performing the piece ''Úlfhamssaga'', based on the [[Norse sagas]].

In 2007, Eivør's 5th album ''Mannabarn'' was released. Produced by [[Dónal Lunny]], an English-language version was released simultaneously under the name ''Human Child.'' The album was recorded throughout 2006 and early 2007 in [[Dublin]], and reached #39 on the Danish [[Tracklisten]].<ref>[https://danishcharts.dk/showitem.asp?interpret=Eiv%F8r+P%E1lsd%F3ttir&titel=Human+Child&cat=a danishcharts.dk Eivör Pálsdóttir – ''Human Child'' album page]</ref>

In 2008, Eivør collaborated with English composer Gavin Bryars on ''Tróndur i Gøtu'' – based on the chieftain of the same name – duetting with bass singer Rúni Brattaberg. It was performed in [[Gøtugjógv]] on 12 July 2008. 

In 2010, she released the album ''Larva'', marking a stark departure away from her folk sound, moving towards a more experimental and electronic musical style.

In 2012 she married the Faroese composer [[Tróndur Bogason]]; the same year, they collaborated on the album ''Room'',<ref>[http://www.lydtapet.net/2012/09/anmeldelse-eivor-room-2/ Lydtapet.net, Anmeldelse: EIVØR – ROOM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108022532/http://www.lydtapet.net/2012/09/anmeldelse-eivor-room-2/ |date=8 January 2014 }} (''in Danish'')</ref> which won three awards at the [[Faroese Music Awards]]: ''Best Female Singer,'' ''Best Artist'' and ''Best Album of the Year''. The following year, she covered "[[Den vilda]]" by [[One More Time (band)|One More Time]] in Icelandic, which charted on [[Tónlist TV]].<ref>[http://www.tonlist.is/Music/Chartlist/595/ Tonlist: Netlistinn viku 46, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215133344/http://www.tonlist.is/Music/Chartlist/595/ |date=15 December 2013 }} (in Icelandic)</ref>

She collaborated with the DR Big Band once again in 2016, releasing the orchestral album ''At the Heart of a Selkie.''

In 2017, Eivør released two companion albums, ''Bridges'' and ''Slør'', sung in English and Faroese respectively. Describing the writing process in an interview with Stacja Islandia, she said that ''"[it] kept coming to me in such a manner that I would write a lyric in English and straight afterwards a lyric in Faroese would arrive – a kind of mirror image or reflection. Most of the songs were written together in pairs. The albums are therefore two different works yet also a unity. This has been my dream project for over 2 years now."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stacjaislandia.pl/aktualnosci/english/interviews/eivor-music-means-the-world-to-me-interview/|title=Eivør – Music means the world to me (interview)|first=Marcin|last=Kozicki}}</ref> The same year, she collaborated with [[John Lunn]] on the soundtrack to [[The Last Kingdom (TV series)|The Last Kingdom]].

The following year, she collaborated with [[Bear McCreary]] on the soundtrack for [[God of War (2018 video game)|God of War]], performing it with a live orchestra at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016|E3 2016 Sony press conference]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjxfk7JNNDI|title=Sony Press Conference Orchestra - Live at E3 2016|last=GameSpot|date=13 June 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>

In 2020, she released the album ''Segl''.

She received the 2021 Nordic Council Music Prize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/news/eivor-palsdottir-wins-2021-nordic-council-music-prize|title=Eivør Pálsdóttir wins the 2021 Nordic Council Music Prize &#124; Nordic cooperation}}</ref>
