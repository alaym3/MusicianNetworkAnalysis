==Music career==
With the exception of his first released album, Collins uses his stage name, Greydon Square, for all his musical projects and other aspects of his professional life. He cites as his influences [[Rakim]], [[Phil Collins]], [[DJ Quik]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Stanley Clarke]], [[Cedric Williams]], and [[The Bee Gees]].<ref name=SbN/><ref name=Skept/>

===Musical beginnings: 2004–2006===
In 2004, under the name Apocalypse, Square released his first album, ''Absolute''. The album was self-published and has since been discontinued. In 2015, Square re-released two songs from the album, ''Absolute'' and ''Reality''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Heaney |first1=Conor |title=Greydon Square – The Kardashev Scale |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219055740/panicdots.com/2010/08/greydon-square-%E2%80%93-the-kardashev-scale/ |website=Panic Dots |access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Subscriber Exclusive Content |url=https://greydonsquare.bandcamp.com/album/subscriber-exclusive-content |website=Bandcamp |access-date=24 July 2021}}</ref>

===''The Compton Effect'' and ''The C.P.T. Theorem'': 2007–2009===
Square's first major album—as well as his first album under the name Greydon Square—was named ''[[The Compton Effect (album)|The Compton Effect]]'' and was released in 2007. The title refers to both the [[Compton scattering|physical phenomenon of the same name]] and the city in which he grew up, [[Compton, California|Compton]]. He created his own company to distribute the record, declining offers from several [[record label]]s.<ref name=SbN/> The following year he released ''The C.P.T. Theorem'', named after the [[CPT symmetry|CPT theorem]], another concept in the field of [[physics]].

His music deals with philosophical and political issues, the war in Iraq and his experiences as a soldier, and his childhood spent in [[orphanage|group homes]]. His atheistic views are dominant in his albums of this period.<ref name=RtR/>

===The Kardashev Scale Trilogy: 2010–2015===
In 2010, he released the first of a trilogy of albums, ''Type I : The Kardashev Scale'', named after the method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement. The ''Type I'' prefix refers to [[Kardashev scale|the scale]]{{'s}} classification of civilizations roughly equal to Earth's, and it is also used to identify the album as the first of the trilogy. The album featured the song "War Porn", performed by Square along with hip-hop artist [[Canibus]].<ref>Piel, Chris (February 27, 2011).
[http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2011/02/canibus_at_club_red_last_night.php "Canibus at Club Red Last Night"]. ''Phoenix New Times''.</ref>

The second album of the trilogy, ''Type II : The Mandelbrot Set'', was released in 2012. In addition to continuing the "Type" naming of the trilogy, the album title references the [[Mandelbrot set]], which is a set of [[complex numbers]] used to create [[fractals]]. Square completed the trilogy in 2015 with the album ''Omniverse : Type 3 : Aum niverse''. The [[Multiverse|omniverse]] is the collection of this universe and all other hypothetical "alternate" or "parallel universes".<ref>{{cite web|title=Greydon Square: Music |url=https://greydonsquare.bandcamp.com/music |website=Bandcamp |access-date=11 August 2017}}</ref>

Also during this period, Square collaborated with Pakistani rapper [[Adil Omar]] on the [[extended play|EP]] ''Serpents of Eden'' as well as Omar's debut solo album ''[[The Mushroom Cloud Effect]]'', where he appear as a guest alongside [[Kool G Rap]] on the song "Summertime".<ref>{{citation |title=Angry Atheist: An interview with Greydon Square| date= January 5, 2010 |work=Angry Atheist}}</ref>

===''Compton Scattering'': 2017–present===
On November 5, 2017, he released the album ''Compton Scattering'', named after a more general version of the Compton effect.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greydon Square: Music |url=https://greydonsquare.bandcamp.com/album/compton-scattering |website=Bandcamp |access-date=13 December 2017}}</ref> The album, which more closely reflects his earlier works, discusses topics such as politics, cryptocurrency, and anti-natalism.{{citation needed |date=July 2021}}

Square was also a featured artist on the album ''LTGU'', released on August 8, 2017, by the [[Phoenix, Arizona]]-based group Low Technology, which Square co-founded in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=LTGU by Low Technology|url=https://lowtechnology.bandcamp.com/releases|website=Bandcamp |access-date=11 August 2017}}</ref>

In 2013, he appeared in the documentary film ''Contradiction'', about [[Religion of black Americans|Christianity in the black community]].<ref>{{cite web|title=IMDb: Contradiction (2013)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3246052/|website=Internet movie database|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=9 August 2017}}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Conflict with Brian Sapient===
Once an active member of the [[Rational Response Squad]], Square was put on probation in 2008 after he punched leader Brian Sapient at a public event in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=Skept/> The incident was allegedly sparked by a disagreement over CD sales.<ref name=Cizmar/> During an interview with [[Phoenix New Times]] the following year, Square said, "It never ceases to amaze me that when people join a group, they just accept the group position on everything. And I did that, with the Rational Response Squad. I accepted their methods and I accepted their beefs."<ref name=Cizmar/>
