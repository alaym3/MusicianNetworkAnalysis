'''Nordman''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] duo founded in 1993, that mixes folk music with rock and pop. This genre is called [[etnorock]] or [[folk rock]] in Swedish. The group consists of Håkan Hemlin, as singer and frontman, and Mats Wester, who plays the [[nyckelharpa]], as well as serving as the main songwriter.

The group's biggest hits were "Förlist" (Shipwrecked) and "Vandraren" (The Wanderer). The group split up in 1998 because of the lead singer's drug problem, but reunited in 2004. They made a comeback in the Swedish [[Melodifestivalen]] with the song "Ödet var min väg" (Fate was my way) and released a comeback album called ''Anno 2005'' in 2005. In 2008, they competed once again in [[Melodifestivalen 2008|Melodifestivalen]] with the song "[[I lågornas sken]]" and finished in sixth place behind winner [[Charlotte Perrelli]]. Nordman's song "Vandraren" was covered by [[Blackmore's Night]] on their 2010 album ''[[Autumn Sky]]'' and by [[Ensiferum]] on their 2009 album ''[[From Afar (album)|From Afar]]''.

== History ==

=== 1991–1993 ===
Hemlin and [[Mats Wester|Wester]] met in a studio in Hjorthagen in 1991. Hemlin was there with his rock band [[Bye Bye (band)|Bye Bye]] to record a demo to a promo-CD. Wester had for some years been experimenting with blending folk and pop and searched for a vocalist to the project. He asked Hemlin if he was interested to try some, and he was. Experiments began after a few hits came the [[embryo]] of what would become the song "Förlist" (wrecked). Gradually added another demos and autumn of 1993 it was time to check if any record company wanted to do an album with the new, completely unknown group Nordman.<ref name="Biografi">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nordman.nu/biografi|title=Nordman Tidslinjen|website=Nordman.se|publisher=Folkpop.se|url-status=live|access-date=29 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803200407/http://www.nordman.nu/biografi/|archive-date=3 August 2019}}</ref>
