'''Obituary''' is an American [[death metal]] band formed in [[Tampa, Florida]] in 1984. They were a fundamental act in the development of death metal music,<ref>{{cite web |last=Birchmeier |first=Jason |date=<!--none given--> |title=Obituary &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/obituary-mn0000465562/biography |access-date=April 4, 2015}}</ref> and are one of the most successful death metal bands of all time.<ref name="blabbermouth_cc">{{cite news |author=<!--none given--> |date=November 17, 2003 |title=It's Official: CANNIBAL CORPSE Are The Top-Selling Death Metal Band Of The SoundScan Era |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-cannibal-corpse-are-the-top-selling-death-metal-band-of-the-soundscan-era/ |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> To date, Obituary has released ten studio albums, and with the exception of their 1997–2003 split, they continue to perform live around the world.

Initially called Executioner, the band changed its name to Xecutioner in 1986 to avoid confusion with the thrash metal band [[Executioner (band)|Executioner]] from Boston, and then changed its name once again to Obituary in 1988. Obituary has gone through several lineup changes, with the Tardy brothers and Peres being the only constant members. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist John Tardy, drummer Donald Tardy, rhythm guitarist [[Trevor Peres]], bassist [[Terry Butler]], and lead guitarist Ken Andrews. Their music is based around heavily [[Groove (music)|groove]]-based [[riff]]s and drumming along with John Tardy's [[growling vocals]], which create their signature brand of death metal.

==History==
===Early career (1984–1990)===
Founded as Executioner in [[Seffner, Florida|Seffner]], [[Florida]] in 1984, they soon dropped the "E" from their name after discovering another band of the same name, becoming Xecutioner. The band's first lineup was composed of John Tardy (lead vocals), Donald Tardy (drums), Trevor Peres (rhythm guitar), Jerome Grable (bass) and Jerry Tidwell (lead guitar). The band was inspired by [[Savatage]] and bands in the burgeoning [[Florida death metal]] scene: [[Nasty Savage]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], and [[Morbid Angel]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Arielle|date=October 22, 2009|title=The way the music died: The earliest days of Tampa Death Metal|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/music/the-way-the-music-died-the-earliest-days-of-tampa-death-metal/1046088|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027025354/https://www.tampabay.com/features/music/the-way-the-music-died-the-earliest-days-of-tampa-death-metal/1046088/|archive-date=October 23, 2009|website=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}</ref> The band released demos in 1985, 1986, and 1987, (the 1985 demo as Executioner and the 1986 and 1987 demos as Xecutioner). They made their vinyl debut in 1987 with two tracks ("Find the Arise" and "Like the Dead") on the ''Raging Death'' compilation.

Not long after the release of the compilation, bassist Grable was replaced by Daniel Tucker and guitarist Tidwell was replaced by [[Allen West (musician)|Allen West]]. The following year, shortly before the release of the band's first album ''[[Slowly We Rot]]'', they changed their name to Obituary. Right after the release of ''Slowly We Rot'', however, Tucker and West quit the band and were respectively replaced by [[Frank Watkins (musician)|Frank Watkins]] and then-[[Death (metal band)|Death]] guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]]. This new lineup recorded the band's second album ''[[Cause of Death (album)|Cause of Death]]'', which was released in September 1990,<ref name="metallipromo">{{cite news |title=Obituary |work=metallipromo.com |url=http://metallipromo.com/obituary.html |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> and is often considered to be one of the most important death metal albums of all time.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |date=November 1, 2018 |title=11 Florida Death Metal Albums You Need |work=[[Loudwire|Loudwire.com]] |url=https://loudwire.com/11-florida-death-metal-albums-you-need/ |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Yardley |first=Miranda |date=August 24, 2012 |title=The Terrorizer Friday Death Metal Top 15 |work=[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer.com]] |url=http://www.terrorizer.com/news/features-2/the-terrorizer-friday-death-metal-top-15/ |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> Obituary supported ''Cause of Death'' with its first world tour, first the US with [[Sacred Reich]] and [[Forced Entry (band)|Forced Entry]], Europe with [[Demolition Hammer]] and [[Morgoth (band)|Morgoth]] and then back to the US with [[Sepultura]] and [[Sadus]].<ref name="metallipromo"/>

===Rise to success (1991–1996)===
In 1991, just prior to the writing and recording sessions of their third album, Murphy left Obituary to join [[Cancer (band)|Cancer]] and was replaced by a returning Allen West. The lineup of Peres, Watkins, West and the Tardy brothers recorded the band's next three albums, starting with ''[[The End Complete]]'' (1992). ''The End Complete'' was a moderate success for Obituary, having sold more than a hundred thousand copies,<ref name="blabbermouth_cc"/> and it was the band's first album to chart in the US and Europe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Heatseekers Albums Chart |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] |url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/Heatseekers-albums/1992-05-16 |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref><ref name="UK-chart">{{cite web |title=OBITUARY &#124; Official Charts Company |publisher=Officialcharts.com |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/obituary/ |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref><ref name="GER-chart">{{cite web |title=Die ganze Musik im Internet: Charts |publisher=Musicline.de |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Obituary/longplay |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref><ref name="NLD-chart">{{cite web |title=Dutch Charts |publisher=Dutchcharts.nl |url=http://dutchcharts.nl/search.asp?search=obituary&cat=a |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> This success also resulted in the release of Obituary's first-ever music video "The End Complete", which received significant airplay on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'',<ref name="hbb">{{cite news |title=Headbangers Ball- The Unofficial Tribute Site - Episode Database |work=headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com |url=http://www.headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com/episode-database |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> and the band toured behind the album in over year, going from playing clubs to theaters and arenas.<ref name="metallipromo"/>

Obituary's fourth studio album, ''[[World Demise]]'', was released in September 1994.<ref name="metallipromo"/> Although the album did not sell as well as ''The End Complete'', it still managed to reach the top 100 in several territories, including the United States,<ref>{{cite web |title=Heatseekers Albums Chart |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] |url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/Heatseekers-albums/1994-09-24 |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> United Kingdom,<ref name="UK-chart"/> Germany,<ref name="GER-chart"/> Switzerland<ref>{{cite web |title=Die Offizielle Schweizer Hitparade und Music Community |publisher=Hitparade.ch |url=http://hitparade.ch/search.asp?search=obituary&cat=a |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> and the Netherlands,<ref name="NLD-chart"/> and a video for "Don't Care" was shot.<ref name="hbb"/> In support of ''World Demise'', the band toured the US with [[Napalm Death]] and a then-unknown [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], and Europe with [[Pitchshifter]] and [[Eyehategod]].<ref name="metallipromo"/>

===Break up and comeback (1997–2014)===
After the release of their fifth album ''[[Back from the Dead (Obituary album)|Back from the Dead]]'' (1997), the band had grown tired of touring, which led to the group disbanding. During this time period, Donald Tardy played in [[Andrew W.K.]]'s touring band (during W.K.'s appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' Tardy wore an Obituary shirt). Allen West focused on his two projects, Lowbrow and [[Six Feet Under (band)|Six Feet Under]]. [[Trevor Peres]] formed Catastrophic in 2001, which released one album, ''The Cleansing'', in that same year. Obituary reformed in 2003 and Catastrophic continued to exist alongside the reformed Obituary. A reunion album, ''[[Frozen in Time]]'', was released in 2005. The band's first live DVD, ''[[Frozen Alive]]'', was released in January 2007.

Obituary was signed with [[Candlelight Records]] for its next three releases, ''[[Xecutioner's Return]]'' (2007), ''[[Darkest Day]]'' (2009), and the EP ''[[Left to Die]]'' (2008). A concert DVD release was also announced for January 2010.<ref name="newDVD">{{cite news |title=OBITUARY: 'Live Xecution' DVD Trailer Available - Dec. 4, 2009 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=131427 |access-date=March 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228105546/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=131427 |archive-date=February 28, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since 2012, the band have been highly involved with the promotion of a new social networking site called Unation, as well as Donald Tardy beginning a Cat Sanctuary organization called Metal Meowlisha, an organization practicing "trap-neuter-vaccinate-return", and caring for 25 cat colonies (200 cats).<ref>{{cite web |last=Oliveira |first=Victoria |date=September 23, 2014 |title=INTERVIEW: OBITUARY' |publisher=RockRevolt Magazine |url=http://rockrevoltmagazine.com/interview-obituary/}}</ref>

The goal was met on August 3. When interviewed by metal webzine ''All About the Rock'', [[John Tardy]] said of the Kickstarter campaign, "This campaign has been awesome and just confirms again what we already know and that is that we have the greatest fans in the world. We are using Kickstarter to raise enough money to release an album on our own. This is not a bash against record companies, it is just what we want to do.
