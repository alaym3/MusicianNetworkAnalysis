'''Impending Doom''' is an American Christian [[deathcore]] band from [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], [[California]]. The group has released six full-length studio albums and are currently a five piece with lead vocalist Brook Reeves as one of the two original remaining members along with Manny Contreras who left the band in 2010 but returned in 2012. The band refers to their style of music as "gorship" - a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[Graphic violence|gore]] and [[worship]].

== History ==
Guitarist Manny Contreras and vocalist Brook Reeves started Impending Doom together on October 31, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/impendingdoom/about/?ref=page_internal|title=Impending Doom — About|publisher=[[Facebook]]|access-date=August 14, 2017}}</ref> The band practiced with their sound before writing enough songs to record their demo, ''The Sin and Doom of Godless Men''. After this release, Greg Pewthers joined as a third guitarist after also leaving Oblige. Later that year, bassist Jon Alfaro left the band and David Sittig was added to the line-up in his replacement. Chris Forno also left and was never replaced. Andy Hegg later took the place of Bueno and the band recorded the album ''[[Nailed. Dead. Risen.]]'' after getting signed to [[Facedown Records]]. Due to drummer Andy Hegg's dedication to his soccer scholarship, Impending Doom was forced to employ substitute drummers for the tours that supported the album. Since then touring drummer Chad Blackwell became the official drummer for the band, during which Greg Pewthers returned to Oblige (a band later known as The Devastated), and was replaced by Cory Johnson, formerly of [[Sleeping Giant (band)|Sleeping Giant]].

The group signed to Facedown Records in January 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.today/20130201105721/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=65797|title=Christian Death Metallers IMPENDING DOOM Sign With FACEDOWN RECORDS - Jan. 23, 2007|website=Archive.today|access-date=9 October 2020}}</ref> and their debut release for the label, ''Nailed.

The group then embarked on a tour of the United States to support the album in autumn 2007,<ref>[http://www.skratchmagazine.com/interviews/interviews.php?id=294 Impending Doom interview].

Metal Underground, December 4, 2007. Accessed December 19, 2007.</ref> In 2009 the band released their second album, ''[[The Serpent Servant]]''. Sometime after the release, drummer Chad Blackwell, a native of Pensacola, Florida, left the band to attend the Atlanta Institute of Music, to which Impending Doom asked former member Isaac Bueno to rejoin.

Impending Doom released their second album, ''The Serpent Servant'', on March 31, 2009 which has hit number 3 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers]] chart.<ref name="Billboard Chart Positions"/> Their third album, ''[[There Will Be Violence]]'', was released on July 20, 2010. Sometime during the recording of the new album, both Manny Contreras and Isaac Bueno left the band for unknown reasons. Since then the band brought Brandon Trahan (formerly of Mirror of Dead Faces, [[xDEATHSTARx]]) into the line-up but have yet to find another permanent guitarist. The band has been on the Thrash and Burn tour 2010 with [[Through the Eyes of the Dead]], [[Kittie (band)|Kittie]], [[Born of Osiris]], [[Asking Alexandria]] and more. They've toured with [[MyChildren MyBride]], [[The Crimson Armada]], [[Chimaira]], and other bands.

The band also created their own symbol called the "Repentagram" combining the words repent and [[pentagram]]. The band explained the Repentagram with the following:
<blockquote>We’ve gotten a lot of mail questioning the Repentagram Logo, I would like to take time right now to explain it to you all. First off we are a Christian band and a real one at that, we would never put something out that had satanic meaning or anything negative. We thought up the word "REPENTAGRAM" basically putting two words together. 1. REPENT (meaning: to feel such sorrow for sin or fault as to be disposed to change one’s life for the better; be penitent.) 2. PENTAGRAM (which in the dark metal world is a satanic symbol.) Since we are a Christian death metal band we wanted to think up something clever; thus the Repentagram came into thought. It is not the same amount of sides as a pentagram, we are going for making a Christian death metal symbol. Just like we created the word "GORSHIP" (which as you all should know, does NOT mean worship gore, it means worshiping God through our Gore sounding music) the Repentagram is just the new word. Please pass this information along to anyone you may know that thinks anything more than it really is.<ref>Impending Doom, MySpace, Sunday, May 11, 2008</ref></blockquote>

''[[Baptized in Filth]]'' was produced by Andreas Magnusson who produced [[Oh, Sleeper]]'s album ''[[Children of Fire]]'' and was mixed by Machine. The album is focused in [[God]], [[Satan]] and [[Number of the beast|the Number of the Beast; 666]]. The first single is "For the Wicked" and the first video is "Murderer". A few months after the release of "Baptized in Filth", Cory Johnson was fired from the band and was replaced by former founding member Manny Contreras, who had become a member of Oblige (later known as The Devastated) during his time off from Impending Doom. Johnson soon after being fired join fellow [[Christian metal]] band, [[Mychildren Mybride]].

Lead vocalist, Brook Reeves, was one of the many vocalists that performed at the Mitch Lucker Memorial Show on December 21, 2012 with [[Suicide Silence]] in honor of their deceased vocalist, Mitch Lucker, who died on November 1, 2012. Reeves performed the song "Ending Is the Beginning", off the 2005 ''[[Suicide Silence EP]]''. On February 26, 2013, Brook Reeves was also featured on the single track "Efforts to Outcomes" by Demise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/DemiseBandOfficial |title=Demise |publisher=Facebook |date=April 26, 2013 |access-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdlpzsrbh8g |title=Demise - Efforts To Outcomes ft.
