Between his commitments as a member of BTS, Agust D took advantage of time on the plane and in hotel rooms after concerts to continuously produce and compose music.<ref name="marie claire">{{cite magazine|date=August 27, 2016|title=꿈꾸는 슈가|url=http://www.marieclairekorea.com/2016/08/celebrity/%EA%BF%88%EA%BE%B8%EB%8A%94-%EC%8A%88%EA%B0%80/|magazine=[[Marie Claire|Marie Claire Korea]]|language=ko|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> In an interview for ''[[Grazia|Grazia Korea]]'', Agust D expressed a desire to release the music he wanted to do without having to consider popular appeal or music ranking. He intended to release his music for free in the form of a mixtape to avoid such considerations, commenting that an album "has a feeling of being trapped in some sort of framework" due to the need for company involvement in promotion and advertising. Developing ''Agust D'' musically on the base of [[hip hop]], much of Agust D's inspiration for the lyrics came from his own stories of dream, youth, and reality.<ref name="grazia"/>

In order to differentiate his work from that of his work as Suga, he developed the [[alter ego]] "Agust D", which is derived from the initials DT, short for his birthplace, [[Daegu]] Town, and "Suga" spelled backwards.<ref name="grazia" /> Steadily accumulating songs in his career, Agust D utilized a number of songs composed as early as 2011 to as late as a month before release to create his mixtape.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=https://m.star.naver.com/bts/news/end?id=8096001&langCode=en|last=Kim|first=Ji Ho|date=August 17, 2016|publisher=Starcast|title="My name is, AgustD"... ‘SUGA’ to rap about the real Min Yoon-ki|access-date=August 16, 2016}}</ref> The release of ''Agust D'' followed RM's self-titled mixtape ''[[RM (mixtape)|RM]]'' (2015) and the success of BTS' first compilation album ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]'' (2016) and [[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life On Stage Tour#Epilogue extension|The Most Beautiful Moment in Life On Stage: Epilogue Tour]].<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" />

== Music and lyrics ==
The final cut of ''Agust D'' comprises ten tracks on SoundCloud and eight tracks on streaming and download services.<ref name=":1" /> Critics viewed ''Agust D'' as a major departure from his previous catalog as a member of BTS with a [[Hardcore hip hop|hardcore rap]] style highlighting his [[Underground hip hop|underground]] influences.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fuse.tv/2016/08/bts-suga-agust-d-mixtape-why-you-should-listen|title=Suga takes the spotliht with 'Agust D' mixtape: why you should know the BTS rapper's alter ego|last=Benjamin|first=Jeff|date=August 16, 2016|website=[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7476080/bts-suga-agust-d-mixtape|title=BTS' Suga Addresses Depression & Cost of Fame on 'Agust D' Mixtape|last=Herman|first=Tamar|date=August 16, 2016|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]'' complimented the album's divergence from his contemporaries in K-pop with its vulnerability and Agust D's self-production.<ref name=":5" /><ref name="fuse 20">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fuse.tv/2016/12/best-mixtapes-of-2016-hip-hop|title=The 20 Best Mixtapes of 2016: #16 Agust D, 'Agust D'|last=Benjamin|first=Jeff|date=December 16, 2016|website=[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>

In ''Agust D'', Agust D exposed his inner thoughts on his beginnings to his rise to stardom. "Intro ; Dt sugA", showcasing the style of classic [[turntablism]] hip hop, preceded the self-introduction track "Agust D" which utilized fast and precise rap techniques over "deep and intense bass" to underscore his confidence and self-identity.<ref name=":3" /> "Give It to Me" launched into "full-on disses" towards his detractors and the subsequent "Skit" explored the duality of Agust D and Suga "as a human being and as a musician".<ref name=":3" /> While "724148" reflected on the meaning of "success" and Agust D's beginnings in his hometown of Daegu, the track "140503 at Dawn", composed of minimal beats, reflected on his underlying vulnerability in the early morning before transitioning into the track "The Last" which utilized dramatic beats and rap techniques<ref name=":3" /> to portray his soul consumed by depression, obsession, and self-hatred following the pursuit of his dream in Seoul.<ref name=":5" /> In "Tony Montana", Agust D took on the character of [[Tony Montana]] from the 1983 film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' to ruminate on the nature of success, ambition, and envy. The lyrics of "Interlude: Dream, Reality" consisted of only the word "dream", leading into the final track "So Far Away" which reflected on the essence of the word "dream"<ref name=":3" /> while urging his listeners to continue dreaming.<ref name=":5" />
