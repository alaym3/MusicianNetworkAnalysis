Lambert auditioned for the [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' in [[San Francisco, California]] by singing "[[Rock with You]]" and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]".<ref name="LATimes3" /> Advancing to Hollywood week, he performed "[[What's Up? (4 Non Blondes song)|What's Up]]"  and "[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]" solo, and "[[Some Kind of Wonderful (Soul Brothers Six song)|Some Kind of Wonderful]]" in the group effort.<ref name="LATimes4">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/americanidoltracker/2009/08/adam-lambert-the-ultimate-interview-part-four.html |title=Adam Lambert: The ultimate interview, Part Four |last= Bronson| first= Fred |access-date=December 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003131338/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/americanidoltracker/2009/08/adam-lambert-the-ultimate-interview-part-four.html |archive-date=October 3, 2009 }}</ref> [[Simon Cowell]] voiced some concern about his theatricality, but [[Randy Jackson]] found it "current".<ref name="LATimes3" /> He advanced easily to the top 36 performing "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]".<ref name="LATimes4" />

In the first week of live shows, his rendition of [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Black or White]]" was praised by all four judges.<ref name="aijourney">{{cite web |url=http://www.broadway.com/shows/wicked/buzz/5987/wicked-good-adam-lamberts-american-idol-journey/|title=Wicked Good: Adam Lambert's ''American Idol'' Journey |last= Kay |first= Kimberly|date=March 11, 2009|access-date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> For [[Country music|Country]] week, he sang a sitar-infused version of "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]". His [[Motown]] night acoustic version of [[The Miracles]]' "[[The Tracks of My Tears]]" drew praise from judges and a standing ovation from [[Smokey Robinson]], the week's mentor. Advancing to the top 8, he sang the 2001 [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]] and [[Gary Jules]] arrangement of "[[Mad World (song)|Mad World]]". Because the show exceeded its time slot, only Cowell gave a critique, which he did by giving Lambert a standing ovation, the only one he bestowed during his decade-long run as an ''American Idol'' judge. After Lambert sang "[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]", delivering what DioGuardi called his "most memorable performance", Cowell described his vocals as "immaculate". For the top 3 show, he performed "[[One (U2 song)|One]]" before Cowell declared, "If you are not in the final next week, it will be one of the biggest upsets"; and continued with "[[Cryin' (Aerosmith song)|Cryin']]" before Abdul affirmed, "we'll be seeing you next week and many years after that".<ref name=aijourney />

Lambert performed three solos in the finale, a reprise of "Mad World", followed by the 1960s civil rights anthem "[[A Change Is Gonna Come (song)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]", to tremendously positive judge reaction. After his performance of the mandatory winner's single, "[[No Boundaries (song)|No Boundaries]]" Cowell summed up Lambert's journey: "Over the entire season, you've been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show. The hope and whole idea of a show like this is to find a worldwide star, and I truly believe we've found that in you".<ref name=aijourney /> Lambert was announced as the runner-up for the eighth season of ''American Idol''. Upon winning, [[Kris Allen]] stated: "Adam deserved this", later explaining he thought Lambert deserved to win as much as he did, and that Lambert "was the most consistent person all year. He was seriously one of the most gifted performers that I've ever met".<ref name="deservedthis">{{cite web|title=Kris Allen Still Thinks Adam Lambert Deserved "American Idol" Crown|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kris-allen-still-thinks-adam-lambert-deserved-american-idol-crown-20090522|last= Harris| first=Chris|date=May 22, 2009|access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref> Lambert's version of the winner's single was released alongside Allen's.

=== Influences ===

Lambert was inspired when his father gave him access to his large record collection of [[1970s in music|1970s music]]. He was attracted to theatrical rock from artists like [[Madonna]], [[David Bowie]], [[Michael Jackson]], Queen, [[Aerosmith]], and Led Zeppelin.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://people.com/tv/adam-lambert-starstruck-by-meeting-madonna/|title=§Adam Lambert Starstruck by Meeting Madonna|date=June 16, 2009|access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref> Lambert referred to Michael Jackson and Madonna as "King and Queen" because they creatively merged music with makeup, fashion and cinematic video.<ref name="out">{{cite web |url=http://www.out.com/out-exclusives/out100/2011/11/07/adam-revisited?page=0%2c1|author=Hicklin, Aaron|title=Adam Revisited |date=December 7, 2011|access-date=February 24, 2012}}</ref> Among his strongest influences are British singers such as Freddie Mercury, David Bowie and [[Robert Plant]]: "Those are the people I really gravitate towards".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a204144/adam-lambert-inspired-by-british-acts.html|author=Balls, David|title=Adam Lambert 'inspired by British acts'|date=February 19, 2010|access-date=February 24, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2013, Lambert wrote an article for ''Out'' magazine's tribute to David Bowie, who was about to release a new album. In it, he explained how Bowie helped inform the expression of his own sexuality and gender in his work: "A light bulb went off—I wasn't into drag, I didn't want to dress like a woman, but I wanted to express my gender and artistic identity differently than the mainstream. Bowie was a key inspiration. It was about the androgyny of mixing it up, and that was what was so incredible about his concepts—he was one of the first rock stars to really push the idea that sexuality was not black and white but an exploration".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/music/2013/03/12/my-bowie-adam-lambert|author=Lambert, Adam|title=My Bowie:Adam Lambert|date=March 12, 2013|access-date=March 14, 2013}}</ref>

Lambert's own music has been influenced by numerous genres including [[classic rock]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[electronic music]]; and his performance style draws heavily from his stage experience.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-new-issue-of-rolling-stone-the-liberation-of-adam-lambert-20090609|title=The New Issue of Rolling Stone: The Liberation of Adam Lambert |date=June 9, 2009 |access-date=February 14, 2012}}</ref> Lambert envisions himself as the type of artist "that creates from the ground up, not only an amazing song, but one with a beat, and a story, and a look, and a theme".<ref name=out /> For his second album, he used inspiration from classic [[disco]], 1990s [[electronica]], [[funk]] and [[dubstep]] music.<ref name="rollingstone.com2" />
