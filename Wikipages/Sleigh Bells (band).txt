==History==

===Background and formation===
The two members of Sleigh Bells—Derek Miller and [[Alexis Krauss]]—had previous experience performing and touring in a musical ensemble.<ref name="nyt-sweetpains">{{cite news |last=Ryzik |first=Melena |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/arts/music/the-indie-band-sleigh-bells-new-album-reign-of-terror.html |title=Enjoying the Sweet Pains of Success |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 14, 2012 |access-date=March 29, 2012}}</ref> From age 17 to 22, Miller was a guitarist in the [[post-hardcore]] band [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]]. He played on the band's first three albums, but left in 2004, citing creative differences with the other band members as a key factor for his departure.<ref name="spin-marapr2012">{{cite magazine |last=Marchese |first=David |date=March–April 2012 |url=https://www.spin.com/2012/02/sleigh-bells-bringin-heartbreak/ |title=Bringin' on the Heartbreak |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=54–61, 108 |issn=0886-3032 |access-date=October 24, 2017}}</ref> Krauss meanwhile has a background in theater and television.

In March 2008, Miller moved to [[New York City]] expressly to find a female vocalist for some song [[Demo (music)|demo]]s he was working on. "I'm just obsessed with female vocalists. I don't want to say I was really determined, but I was really determined," said Miller.<ref name="nyt-sweetpains"/> He began working at a Brazilian bistro in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], and in July, Krauss and her mother dined at the restaurant. Miller expressed his interest in finding a female vocalist for his new project and Krauss was volunteered by her mother. The two met in a park, where she listened to Miller's demos.<ref name="spin-marapr2012"/> In a 2012 interview, Krauss recalled her first impressions, saying: "Derek's music sounded like a really interesting challenge, but I wasn't thinking he was somebody I wanted to develop a creative relationship with."<ref name="spin-marapr2012"/> Krauss was pursuing a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] at the time, but decided to pair up with Miller instead.<ref name="nyt-sweetpains"/> The band name Sleigh Bells comes from the phrase Miller used to delineate [[CD-R]]s with demos he had worked on.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chisholm|first=Alexander|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/features/big-day-out-2013-interviews-sleigh-bells/|title=Sleigh Bells – Big Day Out 2013 Interviews|work=[[Music Feeds]]|date=January 7, 2013|access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref>

===2009-11: ''Sleigh Bells EP'' and ''Treats''===
From the beginning, Miller and Krauss set high expectations for themselves, with the goal to make a living off of their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/2012/03/27/five-questions-with-alexis-krauss-of-sleigh-bells/|title=Five Questions with Alexis Krauss of Sleigh Bells|work=[[Chart Attack]]|date=March 27, 2012|access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref> Krauss noted that when the two began recording together for the first time, Miller wanted to be in control. "It was like a really interesting [[Session musician|session gig]] for me...I always knew it was Derek's thing — he was producing and writing the songs. He had very specific ideas about what the vocals should be like."<ref name="spin-marapr2012"/>

The duo performed at the [[CMJ Music Marathon]] in October 2009.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dombal |first=Ryan |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/36906-cmj-friday-the-xx-sleigh-bells/ |title=CMJ: Friday [The xx, Sleigh Bells] |work=Pitchfork |date=October 24, 2009 |access-date=May 16, 2010}}</ref> They signed to [[M.I.A.

Sleigh Bells began tracking songs for their second studio album in June 2011. Describing the sound of the new album, Krauss said, "It sounds really huge, so there's going to still be tons of volume."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Helton |first1=Eric |last2=Murphy |first2=Matthew |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/sleigh-bells-reveal-details-of-their-next-album-20110513 |title=Sleigh Bells: Reveal details of their next album |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=May 13, 2011 |access-date=January 17, 2015}}</ref>

On December 7, 2011, the band announced via press release both the date of the album's release and the track listing.
