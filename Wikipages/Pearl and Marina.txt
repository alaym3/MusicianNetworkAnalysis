==Concept and creation==
Marina's surname is revealed by her and Pearl's chat log in the [[Octo Expansion]] to be Ida, making her full name Marina Ida (Japanese: イイダ, ''Iida''). Pearl's English surname is currently unknown, but is assumed to be Houzuki (Japanese: ヒメ, ''Hime'').<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/pearl-and-marina-s-hip-hop-getups-are-your-splatoon-2-amiibo-rewards-511527.phtml|title=Pearl and Marina's hip-hop getups are your Splatoon 2 amiibo rewards|work=[[Destructoid]]|last=Moyse|first=Chris|date=July 6, 2018|accessdate=May 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708104310/https://www.destructoid.com/pearl-and-marina-s-hip-hop-getups-are-your-splatoon-2-amiibo-rewards-511527.phtml|archive-date=July 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Pearl, an [[Inkling (Splatoon)|Inkling]], is 21 while Marina, an Octoling, is 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/12/nintendo_reveals_the_ages_of_pearl_and_marina|title=Nintendo Reveals the Ages of Pearl and Marina|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|last=Vogel|first=Mitch|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=March 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322234111/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/12/nintendo_reveals_the_ages_of_pearl_and_marina|archive-date=March 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Before the duo's final designs were created, Pearl was originally designed as an Octoling,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nintendowire.com/news/2017/12/01/splatoon-2-art-book-shows-off-hooks-pearl-octoling/|title=Splatoon 2 art book shows Off the Hook's Pearl as an Octoling - and more!|date=2017-12-01|website=Nintendo Wire|access-date=2020-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301030509/https://nintendowire.com/news/2017/12/01/splatoon-2-art-book-shows-off-hooks-pearl-octoling/|archive-date=2020-03-01|url-status=live}}</ref> which gives off more of a similarity to [[Squid Sisters|Callie and Marie of the Squid Sisters]]. She was later redesigned as an Inkling and was made shorter to contrast said similarities.

They were designed by Nintendo artist Rina Honda.<ref name="designer">{{Cite web|url=https://a.tamabi.ac.jp/mag/archives/20190706033544.htm|title=シリーズ累計販売約1000万本突破、『スプラトゥーン』の世界観全体のデザインを担う}}</ref>

==History==
===''Splatoon 2''===
{{Main|Splatoon 2}}
According to the game's lore, Pearl and Marina both had separate lives until sometime between the events of the first ''[[Splatoon (video game)|Splatoon]]'' and ''[[Splatoon 2]]''. Pearl was born from a rich family and had a strong interest in music at a young age. Similar to Callie and Marie, she took part of the Inkopolis Youth-folk Singing Contest, however she caused damage to the venue through the power of her voice. Later on her life, Pearl would start up her music career, with her first genre being death metal, helping her garner a small fan base.

Marina, also at a prodigious age, was assigned as combat engineer for the Octarian race, under the direction of DJ Octavio and soon became a high-ranking member of her society. During the events of the final boss in the original Splatoon, Marina was an observer of Agent 3's battle against DJ Octavio. She soon deserted her race after hearing the Squid Sisters' song, Calamari Inkantation, saying: "This changes everything."

Marina and Pearl both met each other on Mt. Nantai, with Marina having no knowledge of the Inkling culture and language, which Pearl helped her to learn. The next time they met, Marina showed Pearl her musical abilities by letting her listen to an early demo of a song she had made, Ebb and Flow. Pearl was instantly convinced and they both formed Off the Hook. By their fourth single, the duo became so popular that they soon hosted Inkopolis News after the Squid Sisters.

===''Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion''===
{{Main|Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion}}
Despite having no major involvement in the single player campaign of the base game, Pearl and Marina would appear in the ''[[Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion|Octo Expansion]]'' in a major story role, where they communicate with the player-character Agent 8, an amnesiac Octoling. Players are able to read text chats between Pearl, Marina and the character Cap'n Cuttlefish. Pearl and Marina aid Agent 8 in getting to the surface area and assist in the final battle against the Telephone, who wishes to destroy the Inkling and Octoling species.

==Reception==

The relationship between Pearl and Marina has been subject to debate, with some people claiming that they are in a romantic relationship while others feel it's just a friendship.
