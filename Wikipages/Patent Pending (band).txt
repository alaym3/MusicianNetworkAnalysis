'''Patent Pending''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Mount Sinai, New York]]. in 2001.<ref>(June 7, 2006). "Pop-punk humor is patently contagious", ''[[Newsday]]'', p. B5.</ref>

Consisting of Joe Ragosta (vocals), Anthony Mingoia (drums), Robert Ragosta (guitar), Rob Felicetti (guitar, vocals), and Corey DeVincenzo (bass), the band had self-released various [[Extended play|EPs]] before releasing its debut album, ''[[Save Each Other, the Whales Are Doing Fine]]'', in 2006 with original vocalist Michael Ragosta, and bassist Drew Buffardi on We Put Out Records. In 2009 Patent Pending released an EP, ''[[Attack of the Awesome!!!]]'', with Joe Ragosta and Michael Ragosta switching on lead vocals, and Jay Beiner on bass guitar. Michael Ragosta left the band shortly after the EP's release, with lead vocal duties permanently replaced by Joe Ragosta. Joshua Dicker, long time collaborating songwriter with the band, would appear as a live guitarist consistently during Joe Ragosta's switch to lead singer until former [[The Ataris]] guitarist Rob Felicetti replaced Dicker as a touring replacement before joining the band full-time while on tour in 2010.

Patent Pending released an EP, ''[[I'm Not Alone (EP)|I'm Not Alone]]'', in 2010, and the group's second album, ''[[Second Family]]'', in 2011, and performed the single "Dance Til We Die" live at the [[2012 Billboard Music Awards]], hosted at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

The band released its third album, ''Brighter'', in 2013. The band announced its signing with independent record label [[Rude Records]] for the release of ''Armageddon'' EP, due to release in August 2015.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In November 2015 the band released their first LP of their Rude Records contract, ''Riot Hearts Rebellion''.

The band is notable for its upbeat demeanor, diverse song subjects, close relationship with its fans, and energetic live shows.  Since the group's formation, Patent Pending has released three [[Full Length LP|full-length albums]], ten extended plays, and ten [[Single (music)|singles]] to date.

==History==

===Formation (2001)===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
Patent Pending was formed in 2001 by Joe Ragosta and Drew Buffardi while the two were attending Mount Sinai High School in [[Mount Sinai, New York]]. The band was started hastily in order to perform at a local open mic night Ragosta and Buffardi had heard about, recruiting Joe's younger brother Michael on lead vocals, and approaching Anthony Mingoia as he was the only drummer they knew of in their school. Patent Pending began to play shows around [[Long Island]], gaining a consistent following in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], while the band hailed from adjacent [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]]. The group began recording demo CDs with some songs that would go on to be re-recorded and re-released on the band's future albums.

===Early releases and ''Save Each Other, the Whales Are Doing Fine'' (2001–2006)===
The band release its debut EP, ''Meet the Fat Kids'', in 2001, which was self-released and contained only 2 songs. The same year the band release the full-length EP, ''The Pirate House'', which featured both songs from the group's previous EP on it. The name of the EP is a reference to a house decorated like a pirate ship in the band members' home town. Patent Pending released two more EPs in 2002, ''Air Drew'' and ''Drive By'', and second full-length EP, ''Don't Quit Your Day Job''.

Later in 2004 the band released the EP, ''...Is Your Biological Father'', filming the group's first music video for the song "The June Spirit". In 2005 Patent Pending signed to the record label, We Put Out Records, under the [[East West Records|East/West Record Group]].<ref>Apar, Corey. "[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/patent-pending-p790462/biography Patent Pending]", [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved August 24, 2011.</ref><ref>(June 30, 2005). "With the band, Hard work gets patented", ''[[Newsday]]'', p. B3.</ref> The following year the group released its debut full-length album, ''Save Each Other, the Whales Are Doing Fine'', on We Put Out Records, and produced by Joseph A. Pedulla.  The album's original title, "Save The Children, The Whales Are Doing Fine", spawned legal issues pursued by the [[Save the Children Foundation]], causing the album to be retitled and the original release date of May 9, 2006, was changed to June 6, 2006. The album achieved moderate commercial success, selling over 10,000 copies due to the band's inclusion on the entire 2006 [[Vans Warped Tour]], and supporting [[Gym Class Heroes]] and [[Cobra Starship]] on a tour immediately following.<ref>Gamboa, Glenn (March 20, 2011). "The Long Island sound: Patent Pending gets inventive", ''Newsday'', p. C11.</ref> Upon completing the record, the band invited long-time friend Marc Kantor to join as an additional guitarist.

===''Attack of the Awesome!!!'', ''I'm Not Alone'', and switching singers (2007–2010)===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
Bassist and founding member Drew Buffardi left the band in 2007, and was replaced by Jay Beiner who joined as a full-time replacement. The band performed at the 2007 [[Bamboozle Festival]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], as well as select dates on the 2007 [[Vans Warped Tour]], in addition to touring smaller clubs and venues throughout the United States. On April 16, 2007, guitarist Marc Kantor began riding his [[bicycle]] from [[Levittown, New York]] to [[San Diego, California]] in an effort to help raise money and awareness for the [[American Heart Association]], with a portion of the proceeds also being donated to the Rhiannon Chloe Foundation, and was successfully completed on June 7, 2007.  In 2008, Patent Pending went back into the studio with Joseph A. Pedulla to record ''[[Attack of the Awesome!!!]]'', an eight-song EP featuring Joe Ragosta and Michael Ragosta switching lead vocal duties, and was released July 14, 2009. The band supported the EP on separate tours with [[Catch 22 (band)|Catch 22]], [[Just Surrender]], and [[Suburban Legends]] throughout the first half of the year.

After a performance at the Crazy Donkey in [[Farmingdale, New York]] on July 25, 2009, Michael Ragosta announced his departure from the band via a [[YouTube]] video of he and Joe offering an explanation for his leaving the band. Joe Ragosta, originally a guitarist and backing vocalist, became the band's permanent lead vocalist.  Long time songwriter and collaborator with the band, Joshua Dicker, took over Joe Ragosta's guitar duties for live performances during this time.  Dicker and Ragosta began writing for a new EP, asking long time friend and former [[The Ataris]] guitarist Rob Felicetti to come track guitar for the record.  In March 2010, the band went to record with producer [[Jordan Schmidt]], who had worked with other [[pop rock]] artists such [[Motion City Soundtrack]] and [[All Time Low]], at Melmac Studio in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].  The recordings produced the EP/DVD, ''[[I'm Not Alone (EP)|I'm Not Alone]]'', which was released August 17, 2010, featuring a double disc set featuring a 6-song EP, and a DVD featuring live performance footage, tour stories, and a band biography. Felicetti became Dicker's touring replacement, and eventually joined the band as a full-time replacement during the group's 2010 summer tour.  Patent Pending began writing for another record throughout the fall and winter of 2010, following the departure of bassist Jay Beiner, and the inclusion of fill-in bass player Travis McGee.

===''Second Family'' and 2012 Billboard Music Awards performance (2011–2012)===
In February 2011, the band joined back up with producer Jordan Schmidt to begin pre-production for a new full-length record. They started recording at StadiumRed in [[Harlem, New York]] during March, and finished up the recording process at Schmidt's Melmac Studio in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. Patent Pending self-released its second full-length album, ''[[Second Family]]'', on July 12, 2011. While in the studio, the band released two music videos for singles from the EP ''I'm Not Alone'': one for "One Less Heart to Break" which reached number one under every category on [[MTV|mtv.com]] and put into rotation on [[MTV2]]), and "Dance Til We Die" which reached the twelfth highest rated and most viewed music video on mtv.com.

In May, the band was asked to support a US tour with [[Bowling for Soup]] and [[the Dollyrots]], and spent the summer on the [[Vans Warped Tour]] following McGee joining the band as a full-time bassist.<ref>Massimo, Rick (July 15, 2011). "Warped grows from its punk roots: Music review", ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', p. A2.</ref> In October, the band filmed a music video for the single "Douchebag" with producer/director [[Jaret Reddick]] of Bowling For Soup's music video production company [[Jaret Reddick|Built by Ninjas]], which was released December 6, 2011.

Patent Pending was originally scheduled to play on May 20 at [[The 2012 Bamboozle Festival]] in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]] following a spring touring schedule supporting Bowling For Soup, however on May 18 the band was named [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]{{'}}s "Dreamseaker Artist of the Year" after winning a [[battle of the bands]] competition at the Joint at the [[Hard Rock Hotel & Casino]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], securing a live performance slot at the [[2012 Billboard Music Awards]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The band was replaced by [[This Good Robot]] for its May 20 performance at Bamboozle Festival. Patent Pending played select dates on the 2012 [[Vans Warped Tour]] over the summer on the Ourstage.com Stage from July 6–12 and July 21, as well as supporting on a subsequent tour with [[the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vanswarpedtour.com/blog/id/1845479 |title=Ourstage.com Stage Announces Warped 2012 Line-up |date=May 14, 2012 |publisher=Vans [[Warped Tour]] |access-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520193452/http://vanswarpedtour.com/blog/id/1845479 |archive-date=May 20, 2012 }}</ref> The band was also included on the Crappy Records compilation Have a Crappy Summer, on which they released a new song, "These Pools Were Made for Hopping".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crappyrecords.com/have-a-crappy-summer-lineup-announced/ |title=Have a Crappy Summer Lineup Announced! |date=April 12, 2012 |publisher=Crappy Records |access-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505070710/http://crappyrecords.com/have-a-crappy-summer-lineup-announced/ |archive-date=May 5, 2012 }}</ref>

In addition to the tour, Bowling for Soup released a [[split album]] with the supporting acts of the group, Patent Pending and The Dollyrots, on the band's "One Big Happy Tour."  The split was called ''One Big Happy'', with each releasing a new original song and a cover of a song by the other bands on the album. The band's new original song on the split was "Psycho In Love", and the band covered Bowling for Soup's "Shut Up and Smile" and The Dollyrots' "Hyperactive."
