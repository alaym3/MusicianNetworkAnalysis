'''Yves René Marie Simon''' (March 14, 1903 – May 11, 1961) was a French [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[political philosopher]].

==Life==
Simon studied under [[Jacques Maritain]] at the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]].<ref>There are three readily available sources for biographical information on Simon.  The first is the [http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/inspires/simon.shtml biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111085025/http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/inspires/simon.shtml |date=November 11, 2009 }} at the [http://ethicscenter.nd.edu/ Center for Ethics and Culture] of the [[University of Notre Dame]].  The second is a [http://www.thomasinternational.org/conferences/20040718palermo/simon_paper.htm biographical address] given by Anthony O. Simon at the 2004 conference of [http://www.thomasinternational.org/contact/contact.htm Thomas International] The third is in French, see : http://transatlantica.revues.org/6842.{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  He taught at the Institut Catholique de Lille from 1930 to 1938.  In 1938, he came to the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]], as a visiting professor.  He was unable to return to France because of [[World War II]], and after the war he remained as a professor at Notre Dame until 1948.  He then joined the [[Committee on Social Thought]], at the [[University of Chicago]].  He remained at the University of Chicago until retiring in 1958 due to illness.  He died of [[cancer]] in South Bend, Indiana on May 11, 1961.<ref>McMorrow, G. J. "Yves Rene Marie Simon." New Catholic Encyclopedia, Gale, 2003.

Simon left many materials unfinished at his death, and many of his publications have only appeared after his death.  His son, Anthony O. Simon, has taken on the role of director of the Yves R. Simon Institute, which contributes to the effort to publish such materials.  Simon's papers are at the University of Notre Dame.<ref>{{cite web

==Scholarship==
Simon trained to work in the realm of [[Thomism]] or [[scholastic philosophy]].   According to John Dawson's biography of Gödel, Simon attended Kurt Gödel's logic lectures at Notre Dame in the late 1930s (as would be expected of a mind near the center of the [[Thomism#Neo-Scholastic_Thomism|Cracow Circle]]). Thus, in 1955, he was one of several contributors to the translating of [[John of St. Thomas]] into English.<ref>''The Material Logic of John of St. Thomas: Basic Treatises'', trans. Yves R. Simon, [[John J. Glanville]] and [[G. Donald Hollenhorst]] (University of Chicago Press 1955).</ref>

However, he is better known for his work in moral and political philosophy.  There, he defended the traditional Thomistic account of moral action and the virtues.  He was an ardent defender of the proposition that this traditional account was compatible with liberal democracy in the West, arguing that French Catholics had erred in holding that the Catholic faith supported their adherence to monarchy, ''à la'' [[Action Française]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
