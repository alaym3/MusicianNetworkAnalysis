==History==
===2000 - 2008: Formation and early success===
Muse started his musical aspirations as part of the [[East Texas]] [[Indie Music|indie music]] boom with his participation in several projects at the time, which included Uncle Andrew, Neckpunch, [[The Lonely Hearts]] and a short stint as bass fill-in for [[Eisley]].<ref name=chron1>{{cite web |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2012-02-17/preaching-to-the-choir/ |title=Preaching to the Choir: Quiet Company sets its monster free |last=Solomon |first=Dan |date=2012-02-17 |website=austinchronicle.com |publisher=Austin Chronicle |access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> A key contributor in the songwriting process for Eisley's debut album for [[Warner Bros. Records]], Muse also gave the band a new name that, if only in part, would stick, MossEisley.{{According to whom|date=January 2020}}

After an unsuccessful year with the Connotations in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Muse returned to Austin to begin writing and recording what would become the band's first full-length release ''Shine Honesty'' under the name Quiet Company.<ref name=chron1></ref> The record was quickly picked up for online distribution by the boutique Christian label [[Northern Records]].<ref name=chron1></ref> Recording ''Shine Honesty'' mostly by himself,<ref name=paste1></ref><ref name=pgaudio>{{cite web |url=https://puregrainaudio.com/interviews/interview-with-quiet-company-vocalist-taylor-muse |title=Interview with Quiet Company vocalist Taylor Muse |last=Willschick |first=Aaron |date=2011-11-09 |website=puregrainaudio.com |publisher=PureGrainAudio |access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref> Muse was in need of band mates to play live shows, providing the pretext for Quiet Company's first permanent addition, Tommy Blank, via a [[Craigslist]] ad,<ref name=paste1></ref><ref name=lantern1>{{cite web |url=https://www.thelantern.com/2012/10/quiet-company-looking-to-get-loud-in-columbus/ |title=Quiet Company Looking to Get Loud in Columbus |last=Harasyn |first=Pam |date=2012-10-21 |website=thelantern.com |publisher=The Lantern |access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> in 2005. The band embarked on a number of small national tours in the subsequent the years. Shortly after, the band left their label in order to exert more self control over their content.<ref name=lantern1></ref>

The band's next offerings were decidedly more festive, with 2007 bringing a recording of "[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]" as part of ''Peace on Earth: A Holiday Album'', in which proceeds from sales went to the [[Toys for Tots]] charity, as well as their own release ''A Merry Little Christmas EP''.

===2009 - Present: New additions and continued success===
In 2009, the band recorded and self-released<ref name=westword>{{cite web |url=https://www.westword.com/music/sound-bites-quiet-company-death-cab-for-cutie-peter-doherty-the-fratellis-the-life-and-times-and-the-view-5678352 |title=Sound Bites: Quiet Company, Death Cab for Cutie, Peter Doherty, the Fratellis, the Life and Times and the View |last=Callaway |first=Chris |date=2009-04-30 |website=westword.com |publisher=Denver Westword |access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> their second full-length album, ''Everyone You Love Will Be Happy Soon'',<ref name=chron2>{{cite web |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2011-10-07/quiet-company-we-are-all-where-we-belong/ |title=Quiet Company: We Are All Where We Belong Album Review |last=Moser |first=Margaret |date=2011-10-07 |website=austinchronicle.com |publisher=Austin Chronicle |access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> with local producers Charlie Vela and Louie Lino of [[Nada Surf]] fame,{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} and mixed by Tim Palmer, who had worked previously with [[U2 (band)|U2]] and [[Pearl Jam]].<ref name=chron2></ref> Following the release, Jeff Weathers (drums) and Matthew Parmenter (bass guitar) joined the group as permanent members, with Parmenter's addition to the group the result of another Craigslist ad.<ref name=paste1></ref><ref name=chron1></ref> While filming their music video for the single, "On Modern Men", the band added their fifth member, Cody Ackors on trombone.<ref name=texan>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/life-and-arts/2014/01/26/after-a-tour-with-quiet-company-cody-ackors-returns-to-ut-with-a-new |title=After a tour with Quiet Company, Cody Ackors returns to UT with a new direction |last=Grasso |first=Samantha |date=2014-01-26 |website=thedailytexan.com |publisher=The Daily Texan |access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>

In 2010, Quiet Company released ''Songs for Staying In'', a 6-song EP, produced by Quiet Company and recorded by bass player Matt Parmenter in his apartment studio, Ice Cream Factory Studios.<ref name=cincy>{{cite web |url=https://cincymusic.com/blog/2015/05/quiet-company-are-powerful-indie-rock |title=Quiet Company are Powerful Indie Rock |last=Bowers |first=Jared |date=2015-05-17 |website=cincymusic.com |publisher=CincyMusic |access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>

Continuing to be recognized, 2011 began with the band being nominated for the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards under the Pop/Rock Song category for "It’s Better To Spend Money Like There’s No Tomorrow Than Spend Tonight Like There’s No Money".<ref name=hm>{{cite web |url=https://hmmagazine.com/indepent-music-awards-nominees-announced/ |title=Indepent [sic] Music Awards Nominees announced |last=Van Pelt |first=Doug |date=2011-03-01 |website=hmmagazine.com |publisher=HM Magazine |access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> By mid-2011, Quiet Company joined forces via an Artist Development deal with the former music-streaming service [[Grooveshark]].<ref name=prnewswire1></ref> The band's partnership with the service helped to encourage a global audience by increasing exposure on platforms like [[Facebook]] and increasing overall listenership on the steaming site, making the band's offerings available to a wider audience.<ref name=bw1>{{cite web |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/artist/Quiet-Company |title=Quiet Company Bio |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=broadwayworld.com |publisher=Broadway World |access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>

In a dominant showing, Quiet Company and its members won a total of ten awards at the [[Austin Chronicle]]'s 30th Annual Austin Music Awards in 2012, including Best Band and Album of the Year, with Muse receiving Musician of the Year honors.<ref name=chron3>{{cite web |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/austin-music-awards/year:2011/category:best-of-the-year/ |title=Austin Music Awards, 2011-2012, Best of the year |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=austinchronicle.com |publisher=The Austin Chronicle |access-date=2012-10-03}}</ref>

2016 proved to be a year of transitions for the group – with existing members exiting the group and new ones taking their places.<ref name=ktsw>{{cite web |url=https://ktswblog.net/2019/03/28/quiet-company-on-corners-shapes-ep-review/ |title=Quiet Company: On Corners & Shapes EP Review |last=Willenborg |first=Shane |date=2019-03-28 |website=ktswblog.net |publisher=KTSW 89.9 |access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref> The following years have proceeded with three EP-length releases by Quiet Company with themes centering around Muse’s divorce from his wife, which took place after the release of ''Transgressor''.<ref name=bc>{{cite web |url= https://blogcritics.org/sxsw-music-festival-2019-begins/ |title= SXSW Music Festival 2019 Begins |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2019-03-13 |website= blogcritics.org |publisher=*blogcritics |access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>

===Religious influences, criticism===
Though Muse's Quiet Company was initially signed to a Christian label [[Northern Records]],<ref name=chron1></ref> played the Christian rock oriented [[Cornerstone Festival]] and Muse himself repeatedly drawing heavy religious comparisons in his lyrics, he has stated that he is no longer a Christian<ref name=chron1></ref> and has posited that Quiet Company has never been a Christian band: "I've always fallen back on religious imagery as a songwriting tool, just because it was familiar to me and I liked the aesthetic of it," says Muse in a recent interview with the Austin Chronicle.<ref name=chron1></ref>

Early efforts by the band include heavy use of Christian themes and iconography, but have shifted over time, with the meaning behind the metaphor's usage evoking something much different than it did previously for the band. Speaking specifically about the 2011 release ''We Are All Where We Belong'', Muse states, "It's easily the most personal thing I've ever written. It is, essentially, a break up record, only the romance that's ending was between myself and religion."<ref name=chron1></ref>

The album left most of the band's pre-existing Christian fan base confused. Muse says he receives e-mails frequently from fans who "love the record" but are "concerned" about his departure from religion.<ref name=chron1></ref>

===Exposure and touring===
Quiet Company's music has been and continues to be featured by various Austin rock-oriented radio stations such as [[KUTX]],<ref name=kutx>{{cite web |url=https://kutx.org/my-kutx/my-kutx-quiet-company |title=My KUTX: Quiet Company |last=Levy |first=Art |website=kutx.org |publisher=UT Moody College of Communication |access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref> [[KSGR]], [[KROX-FM|KROX]],<ref name =blueindian>{{cite web |url=http://www.theblueindian.com/features/deluna-festival-quiet-company/ |title=Deluna Festival: Quiet Company |last=Pritchard |first=Sean |date=2011-10-10 |website=theblueindian.com |publisher=The Blue Indian |access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref> [[KUT]], [[KOOP (FM)|KOOP]] and [[KLBJ-FM|KLBJ]].<ref name=bw1></ref>

Expanding exposure outside the local scene, a sampling of the band's songs have been used in television shows such as [[E!]]'s [[Keeping Up With the Kardashians]],<ref name=pgaudio></ref> [[MTV]]'s [[The Real World (TV series)|The Real World:]] [[The Real World: New Orleans (2010 season)|New Orleans]],<ref name=lantern1></ref> [[The CW]]’s [[Hart of Dixie]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]’s [[My Generation (TV series)|My Generation]], [[USA Network|USA]]’s [[Royal Pains]] and in [[The Sims 3: Showtime]] expansion pack for [[The Sims 3]].<ref name=aronline>{{cite web |url=https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2013/sep/19/quiet-company-they-arent-20130919/|title=Quiet Company they aren’t |last=Hill |first=Jack W. |date=2013-09-19 |website=arkansasonline.com |publisher=Arkansas Democrat Gazette |access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>
