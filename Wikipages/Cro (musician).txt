Apart from his music, Cro also works as a designer.<ref>{{cite news|year=2011|title=Cro|language=German|work=cromusik.info|url=http://cromusik.info/info/|url-status=dead|access-date=27 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717061425/http://cromusik.info/info/|archive-date=17 July 2012}}</ref> In 2010, he founded his own fashion label called VioVio.

=== Artist ===
After the release of his last studio album ''[[tru.]]'', Cro started showing more of his art in general. On 8 September 2017, he had his first vernissage at the Circle Culture Gallery in Berlin, where he showed several pieces of art, including masks that he colored and self-made paintings.

=== Directing ===
In 2016, Cro made his first movie titled ''Unsere Zeit ist jetzt'' ("Our Time Is Now"), where he was working together with German actor [[Til Schweiger]]. The movie started on 6 October 2016 in German cinemas.

== Panda mask ==
Cro wears a panda mask whenever he is on stage or doing something media related. His first mask was a cut version made out of latex. He once said that the main reason for his wearing it is to protect his privacy. In 2014, he wore an alternate mask made of cotton. Since the premiere of the video to "Unendlichkeit", Cro wore a more minimalistic mask that is made of plastic and is fully white.

Since August 13 2020, Cro changed his mask with nearly every new single he released for his album, trip. Currently he has been releasing promotional photos using a “futuristic space mask”, which very vaguely resembles the panda mask he used to wear.
