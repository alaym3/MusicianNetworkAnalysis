'''Wayne Shorter''' (born August 25, 1933) is an American [[jazz]] saxophonist and composer.<ref name="Larkin"/> Shorter came to wide prominence in the late 1950s as a member of, and eventually primary composer for, [[Art Blakey]]'s [[Jazz Messengers]]. In the 1960s, he went on to join [[Miles Davis]]'s [[Miles Davis Quintet#Second Great Quintet|Second Great Quintet]], and from there he co-founded the [[jazz fusion]] band [[Weather Report]]. He has recorded over 20 albums as a bandleader.

Many of Shorter's compositions have become jazz standards, and his output has earned worldwide recognition, critical praise and various commendations. Shorter won 11 [[Grammy Awards]].<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22Wayne+Shorter%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All Past Winners Search for Wayne Shorter].

===Early life and career===
Wayne Shorter was born in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], New Jersey,<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1081/2}}</ref> and attended [[Newark Arts High School]],<ref>[http://www.nps.k12.nj.us/arts/a_brief_history.htm A Brief History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419035207/http://www.nps.k12.nj.us/arts/a_brief_history.htm |date=April 19, 2008 }}, Newark Arts High School.

Accessed August 14, 2018. "Shorter, a graduate of Newark Arts High School, began his professional career more than six decades ago and shows no sign of slowing down."</ref> from which he graduated in 1952. He loved music, being encouraged by his father to take up the clarinet as a teenager; his older brother [[Alan Shorter|Alan]] played [[alto saxophone]] before switching to the [[trumpet]] in college. While in high school Wayne also performed with the Nat Phipps Band in Newark. After graduating from [[New York University]] with a degree in [[music education]] in 1956, Shorter spent two years in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], during which time he played briefly with [[Horace Silver]]. After his discharge, he played with [[Maynard Ferguson]]. In his youth Shorter had acquired the nickname "Mr. Gone", which later became an album title for Weather Report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigtakeover.com/recordings/weather-report-forecast-tomorrow-columbia-legacy|title=Weather Report - Forecast: Tomorrow (Columbia Legacy)|website=BigTakeOver.com|access-date=October 22, 2018}}</ref>

His early influences include [[Sonny Rollins]], [[John Coltrane]] and [[Coleman Hawkins]]. In 1959, Shorter joined [[Art Blakey]]'s Jazz Messengers where he stayed for four years, and eventually became the band's [[Music director|musical director]]. Together they toured the US, Japan and Europe, recorded several recognized albums and he also composed pieces for the band. During this time Shorter "established himself as one of the most gifted of the young saxophonists" and received international acknowledgment.<ref name="Rough Guide to Jazz">{{cite book | last1=Carr | first1=Ian | last2=Fairweather | first2=Digby | last3=Priestley | first3=Brian | title=The Rough Guide to Jazz - The Essential Companion to Artists and Albums | publisher=Rough Guides Ltd. | date=1995 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/jazzroughguide00carr/page/584 584–585] | isbn=1-85828-137-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/jazzroughguide00carr/page/584 }}</ref>

===With Miles Davis (1964–70)===
[[Herbie Hancock]] said of Shorter's tenure in Davis's [[Miles Davis Quintet#Second Great Quintet|Second Great Quintet]]: "The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter. He still is a master. Wayne was one of the few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed."<ref name=Lyons>{{cite book|title=The Great Jazz Pianists: Speaking Of Their Lives And Music|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=%22The+master+writer%22+%22didn't+get+changed%22+intitle:The+intitle:Great+intitle:Jazz+intitle:Pianists|year=1989|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0306803437|author=Len Lyons|page=274|chapter=Herbie Hancock}}</ref> Davis said, "Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, writes the parts for everybody just as he wants them to sound. ... Wayne also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn't work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend them to your own satisfaction and taste."<ref>{{cite book |title=Miles: The Autobiography |last=Davis |first=Miles |author-link=Miles Davis |author2=Troupe, Quincy |author2-link=Quincy Troupe |year=1990 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-671-72582-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/milesautobiograp0000davi/page/274 274] |chapter=Chapter 13 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/milesautobiograp0000davi/page/274 }}</ref>

[[Ian Carr]], musician and [[Rough Guides|Rough Guide]] author, states that with Davis, Shorter found his own voice as a player and composer. "Blakey's hard-driving, straight-ahead rhythms had brought out the muscularity in Shorter's tenor playing, but the greater freedom of the Davis rhythm-section allowed him to explore new emotional and technical dimensions."<ref name="Rough Guide to Jazz"/>

Shorter remained in Davis's band after the breakup of the quintet in 1968, playing on early [[jazz fusion]] recordings including ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (both 1969). His last live dates and studio recordings with Davis were in 1970.

Until 1968, he played [[tenor saxophone]] exclusively. The final album on which he played tenor in the regular sequence of Davis albums was ''[[Filles de Kilimanjaro]]''. In 1969, he played the [[soprano saxophone]] on the Davis album ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and on his own ''[[Super Nova (Wayne Shorter album)|Super Nova]]'' (recorded with then-current Davis sidemen [[Chick Corea]] and [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]). When performing live with Davis, and on recordings from summer 1969 to early spring 1970, he played both soprano and tenor saxophones; by the early 1970s, however, he chiefly played soprano.

====Solo Blue Note recordings====
Simultaneous with his time in the Davis quintet, Shorter recorded several albums for [[Blue Note Records]], featuring almost exclusively his own compositions, with a variety of line-ups, quartets and larger groups, including Blue Note favourites such as trumpeter [[Freddie Hubbard]]. His first Blue Note album (of 11 in total recorded from 1964 to 1970) was ''[[Night Dreamer]]'', recorded at [[Rudy Van Gelder]]'s studio in 1964 with [[Lee Morgan]] (trumpet), [[McCoy Tyner]] (piano), [[Reggie Workman]] (bass) and [[Elvin Jones]] (drums). Two more albums were recorded in 1964, ''[[JuJu (album)|JuJu]]'' and ''[[Speak No Evil]]''.

Of the three Blue Note albums Shorter recorded in 1965, ''[[The All Seeing Eye]]'' (rec. 1965, rel. 1966) was a workout with a larger group, while ''[[Adam's Apple (album)|Adam's Apple]]'' (rec. 1966, rel. 1967) was back to carefully constructed melodies by Shorter leading a quartet. Then a sextet again in the following year for ''[[Schizophrenia (Wayne Shorter album)|Schizophrenia]]'' (rec. 1967, rel. 1969) with Herbie Hancock, bassist [[Ron Carter]], trombonist [[Curtis Fuller]], alto saxophonist/flautist [[James Spaulding]] and strong rhythms by drummer [[Joe Chambers]].

Shorter also recorded occasionally as a [[sideman]] (again, mainly for Blue Note) with trumpeter [[Donald Byrd]], McCoy Tyner, trombonist [[Grachan Moncur III]], Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, and bandmates Herbie Hancock and drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].

===Weather Report (1971–1986)===
[[File:Wayne-Shorter in Amsterdam, 1980.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Shorter with [[Weather Report]] in Amsterdam, in 1980]]
Following the release of ''[[Odyssey of Iska]]'' in 1970, Shorter formed the fusion group [[Weather Report]] with Davis veteran keyboardist [[Joe Zawinul]] and bassist [[Miroslav Vitous]]. The other original members were percussionist [[Airto Moreira]], and drummer [[Alphonse Mouzon]]. After Vitous' departure in 1973, Shorter and Zawinul co-led the group until the band's break-up in late 1985. A variety of musicians would make up Weather Report over the years (most notably the revolutionary bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]]) helping the band produce many high quality recordings in diverse styles, with funk, [[bebop]], [[Latin jazz]], ethnic music, and [[futurism]] being the most prevalent denominators.

====Solo and side projects====
Shorter also recorded critically acclaimed albums as a bandleader, notably 1974's ''[[Native Dancer (album)|Native Dancer]]'', which featured Hancock and Brazilian composer and vocalist [[Milton Nascimento]].

[[File:Wayne Shorter Berkeley 1980.jpg|thumb|Wayne Shorter at the UC Berkeley Jazz Festival 5/25/80]]
In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, he toured in the [[V.S.O.P. (group)|V.S.O.P. quintet]]. This group was a revival of the 1960s Davis quintet, except that Freddie Hubbard filled the trumpet chair. Shorter appeared with the same former Davis bandmates on the [[Carlos Santana]] double LP ''[[The Swing of Delight]]'' (1980), for which he also composed a number of pieces.

From 1977 through 2002, he appeared on 10 [[Joni Mitchell]] studio albums, gaining him a wider audience. He played an extended solo on [[Aja (song)|the title track]] of [[Steely Dan]]'s 1977 album ''[[Aja (album)|Aja]]''.

===Later career===
After leaving Weather Report in 1986, Shorter continued to record and lead groups in [[jazz fusion]] styles, including touring in 1988 with guitarist [[Carlos Santana]], who appeared on ''[[This is This!]]'' (1986), the last Weather Report disc. There is a concert video recorded at the [[Lugano]] Jazz Festival in 1987, with [[Jim Beard]] (keyboards), Carl James (bass), [[Terri Lyne Carrington]] (drums), and [[Marilyn Mazur]] (percussion). In 1989, he contributed to a hit on the rock charts, playing the sax solo on [[Don Henley]]'s song "[[The End of the Innocence (song)|The End of the Innocence]]" and also produced the album ''Pilar'' by the Portuguese singer-songwriter [[Pilar Homem de Melo]]. He has also maintained an occasional working relationship with Herbie Hancock, including [[A Tribute to Miles|a tribute album]] recorded shortly after Miles Davis's death with Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Tony Williams and [[Wallace Roney]]. He continued to appear on Mitchell's records in the 1990s and can be heard on the soundtrack of the [[Harrison Ford]] film ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (1993).

In 1995, Shorter released the album ''[[High Life (Wayne Shorter album)|High Life]]'', his first solo recording for seven years. It was also his debut as a leader for [[Verve Records]]. Shorter composed all the compositions on the album and co-produced it with the bassist [[Marcus Miller]]. ''High Life'' received the [[Grammy Award]] for best Contemporary Jazz Album in 1997.

Shorter worked with Herbie Hancock once again in 1997, on the much acclaimed and heralded album ''[[1+1 (Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter album)|1+1]]''. The song "Aung San Suu Kyi" (named for the [[Myanmar|Burmese]] pro-democracy [[Aung San Suu Kyi|activist]]) won both Hancock and Shorter a Grammy Award.

In 2009, he was announced as one of the headline acts at the [[Gnaoua World Music Festival]] in Essaouira, Morocco. His 2013 live album ''[[Without a Net (Wayne Shorter album)|Without a Net]]'' (rec. 2010) is his first with Blue Note Records since ''[[Odyssey of Iska]]'' (rec. 1970, rel. 1971).

====Quartet====
[[File:Wayne Shorter quartet.jpg|300px|thumb|The Wayne Shorter Quartet at the Teatro degli Arcimboldi, Milan, 2010]]
In 2000, Shorter formed the first permanent acoustic group under his name, a quartet with pianist [[Danilo Perez]], bassist [[John Patitucci]], and drummer [[Brian Blade]], playing his own compositions, many of them reworkings of tunes going back to the 1960s. Four albums of live recordings have been released: ''[[Footprints Live!]]'' (rec. live 2001, rel. 2002); ''[[Beyond the Sound Barrier]]'' (rec. live 2002–2004, rel. 2005); ''[[Without a Net (Wayne Shorter album)|Without a Net]]'' (rec. live 2010, rel. 2013); and ''[[Emanon (Wayne Shorter album)|Emanon]]'' (2018), with the latter, in addition to live material, including Shorter’s quartet in a studio session with the 34-piece [[Orpheus Chamber Orchestra]]. The quartet has received great acclaim from fans and critics, especially for the strength of Shorter's tenor saxophone playing. The biography ''Footprints: The Life and Work of Wayne Shorter'' by journalist Michelle Mercer examines the working life of the musicians as well as Shorter's thoughts and Buddhist beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=15937|title=''Footprints: The Life and Work of Wayne Shorter'' |website=[[All About Jazz|AllAboutJazz.com]]|access-date=November 19, 2010}}</ref> ''Beyond the Sound Barrier'' received the 2006 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Instrumental Jazz Album.

Shorter's 2003 album ''[[Alegría (Wayne Shorter album)|Alegría]]'' (his first studio album for 10 years, since ''High Life'') received the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Album; it features the quartet with a host of other musicians, including pianist [[Brad Mehldau]], drummer Terri Lynn Carrington and former Weather Report percussionist [[Alex Acuña]]. Shorter's compositions, some new, some reworked from his Miles Davis period, feature the complex Latin rhythms that he specialised in during his Weather Report days.

===Lifetime achievement recognition===

===Health===
Shorter’s health has forced him to retire from his near 70-year performing career.
