==History==

===Origins===

[[File:Tommy James and the Shondells.png|thumb|right|250px|Tommy James and the Shondells in 1967. Left to right: Ron Rosman, Peter Lucia, Tommy James, Mike Vale and Eddie Gray]]
The band The Echoes formed in 1959 in [[Niles, Michigan]], then evolved into Tom and the Tornadoes, with 12-year-old [[Tommy James]] (then known as Tommy Jackson) as lead singer.  While attending [[Niles High School]] in Niles, Michigan, the group released its first single, "Long Pony Tail", in 1962.<ref name="Shondells 2006">Tommy James and the Shondells.''40 Years:  The Complete Singles Collection (1966–2006)''. CD booklet. Aura Records, 2008.</ref>

In 1964, James renamed the band the Shondells because the name "sounded good" and in honor of nearby [[Fort Wayne]]'s own [[Troy Shondell]], famous for his 1961 release "[[This_Time_(Thomas_Wayne_song)|This Time]]." At this time, the band included Tommy James (vocals and guitar), Larry Coverdale (lead guitar), Larry Wright (bass), Craig Villeneuve (keyboards), and Jim Payne (drums). In February 1964, the band recorded the [[Jeff Barry]]–[[Ellie Greenwich]] song "[[Hanky Panky (Tommy James and the Shondells song)|Hanky Panky]]" (originally a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] by [[the Raindrops]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/hanky-panky-mt0030108954 |title=Hanky Panky: The Raindrops &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=2008-08-25 |access-date=2015-08-19}}</ref>). As James could often be found playing at Niles High School events, his popularity locally continued to grow.  James' version of "Hanky Panky" sold respectably in Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois, but Snap Records, the label under which "Hanky Panky" was originally released, had no national distribution. The band toured the eastern Midwest, but no other market took to the song. The single failed to [[record chart|chart]] nationally, and the Shondells disbanded in 1965 after its members graduated from high school.

After first considering taking a job outside of music, James decided to form a new band, the Koachmen, with Shondells guitarist Larry Coverdale and members of a rival group called the Spinners (not [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the hit-making group from Detroit]]). The Koachmen played a circuit of clubs in the Midwest through the summer and fall of 1965, but returned to Niles in February 1966, after the gigs dried up, to plot their next move.

===Hanky Panky===

Meanwhile, in 1965, [[Pittsburgh]] dance promoter Bob Mack had unearthed the forgotten single "Hanky Panky", playing it at various dance parties, and radio stations there touted it as an "exclusive". Listener response encouraged regular play, and demand soared. Bootleggers responded by printing 80,000 black market copies of the recording, which were sold in Pennsylvania stores.

James first learned of all this activity in April 1966 after getting a telephone call from Pittsburgh disc jockey "Mad Mike" Metro asking him to come and perform the song. James attempted to contact other members of the Shondells, but they had all moved away, joined the service, or gotten married and left the music business altogether.

In April 1966, James went by himself to make promotional appearances for WZUM Pittsburgh in nightclubs and on local television. He recruited a quintet that was playing at the Thunderbird Lounge in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]] called the Raconteurs -- Joe Kessler (guitar), Ron Rosman (keyboards), George Magura (saxophone), Mike Vale (bass), and Johnnie Hogg (drums) – as the new Shondells.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> "I had no group, and I had to put one together really fast," recalled James. "I was in a Greensburg, PA club one night, and I walked up to a group that was playing that I thought was pretty good and asked them if they wanted to be the Shondells. They said yes, and off we went."<ref>{{cite book | last = Bronson | first = Fred | author-link = Fred_Bronson | title = The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, Fifth Edition | page = 203 | publisher = Billboard Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0823076776 | oclc = 52727714}}</ref>

With a touring group to promote the single, James went to New York City, where he sold the [[master recording|master]] of "Hanky Panky" to [[Roulette Records]], at which time he changed his last name to James. With national promotion, the single became a No. 1 hit in July 1966. In 1972, Kessler and Hogg were forced to leave after a dispute when planned monies were not remitted to them by Roulette, a label closely associated with organized crime, and whose head, [[Morris Levy]], was the inspiration for the [[Herman "Hesh" Rabkin]] character on ''[[The Sopranos]]''. They were replaced by Eddie Gray (guitar) and Peter Lucia (drums); Magura departed as well.<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web|author=Bruce Eder |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tommy-james-the-shondells-mn0000520975/biography |title=Tommy James & the Shondells &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1947-04-20 |access-date=2015-08-19}}</ref>

===Tommy James and the Shondells===
At first, Tommy James and "his" Shondells played straightforward rock and roll, but they soon became associated with the budding [[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum music]] genre. James disputes this, saying that "bubblegum" producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz approached his record company (run by Morris Levy) looking for songwriting jobs. Levy spurned Kasenetz and Katz, so they went elsewhere and became successful with such bands as the 1910 Fruitgum Company. [[Bubblegum music|Bubblegum]] is generally traced to the success of the 1968 Fruitgum Company hit "Simon Says". Tommy rejects the "bubblegum" label for his music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BORYPYU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1|title=Me, the Mob, and the Music: One Helluva Ride with Tommy James & The Shondells|first=Tommy|last=James|date=16 February 2010|access-date=12 June 2021|website=Amazon.com}}</ref> In early 1967 songwriter [[Ritchie Cordell]] gave them the No. 4 hit "[[I Think We're Alone Now]]" and the No. 10 hit "[[Mirage (Tommy James and the Shondells song)|Mirage]]". In 1968, James had a No. 3 hit with "[[Mony Mony]]". Co-written by James, Cordell, Cordell's writing partner Bo Gentry, and [[Bobby Bloom]], "Mony Mony" reached No. 3 in the US and was a British No. 1 in 1968. The title was inspired by a flashing sign for '''M'''utual '''O'''f '''N'''ew '''Y'''ork visible from James's apartment balcony in New York.<ref name="Shondells 2006"/> He followed it with "[[Do Something to Me]]". However, James was labeled as a [[bubblegum pop]] artist, which he hated. Therefore, he changed his style to [[psychedelic rock]].

From late 1968, the group began writing their own songs, with James and Lucia penning the psychedelic-tinged classic "[[Crimson and Clover]]", which was recorded and mixed by Bruce Staple, with James tackling vocal duties and playing many of the instruments himself, and featured the creative use of studio effects such as delay and tremolo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun10/articles/classictracks_0610.htm |title=Tommy James & The Shondells ‘Crimson & Clover’ - Classic Tracks |last=Buskin |first=Richard |publisher=SOS Publications Group |date=June 2010 |website=Sound On Sound |access-date=7 July 2015}}</ref> The group toured with Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] during his presidential campaign, for which Humphrey showed his appreciation by writing the liner notes for the ''[[Crimson & Clover (album)|Crimson & Clover]]'' album.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tommyjames.com/biography.php|title=Tommy James & the Shondells Official Website|publisher=Tommyjames.com|access-date=October 28, 2009}}</ref>

Further hits included "[[Sweet Cherry Wine]]", "[[Crystal Blue Persuasion]]", and "[[Ball of Fire (song)|Ball of Fire]]", all from 1969. They also produced "Sugar on Sunday", later covered by [[The Clique (Texas band)|the Clique]]. As the band embraced the sounds of psychedelia, they were invited to perform at [[Woodstock]], but declined. [[Image:Tommy James and the Shondells 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 2000s edition of Tommy James and the Shondells play a 2010 free outdoor concert in [[Manalapan Township, New Jersey]]]]

The group continued until 1970.<ref>{{cite book

=== Hog Heaven ===
At a concert in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] in March of that year, an exhausted James collapsed after coming off stage from a reaction to drugs and was pronounced dead. He recovered and decided to move to the country to rest and recuperate, and left the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://djallyn.org/archives/437 |title=Djallyn.org |publisher=Djallyn.org |access-date=2011-03-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122003321/http://djallyn.org/archives/437 |archive-date=2010-11-22 }}</ref> His four bandmates carried on for a short while under the name ''Hog Heaven'', recording two albums (one "self-titled" on Roulette Records in March 1971 and the second recorded in 1971, but unreleased until 2008), and landing one Hot 100 hit, "[[Happy (Hog Heaven song)|Happy]]," at number 98, but disbanded soon afterwards.

In a 1970 side project, James wrote and produced the No. 7 hit single "Tighter, Tighter" for the group [[Alive N Kickin']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/tighter-tighter-mt0003155463 |title=Tighter, Tighter - Alive 'N Kickin' &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2015-08-19}}</ref>  James launched a solo career in 1970 that yielded two notable hits over a 10-year span, "[[Draggin' the Line]]" (1971) and "Three Times in Love" (1980).

===Covers by other artists===
During the 1980s, the group's songbook produced major hits for three other artists:  [[Joan Jett & The Blackhearts]]' version of "Crimson And Clover" (No. 7 in 1982), [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany's]] "I Think We're Alone Now" and [[Billy Idol]]'s "Mony Mony" (back-to-back No. 1 singles in November 1987).  Other Shondells covers have been performed by acts as disparate as psychobilly ravers [[the Cramps]], [[New wave music|new wave]] singer [[Lene Lovich]], country music veteran [[Dolly Parton]], and the [[Boston Pops]] orchestra.

===1980s and later===
In the mid-1980s, Tommy James began touring in oldies packages with other acts from the 1960s sometimes billed as Tommy James & the Shondells, although he is the group's only original member. A [[Greenwich Village]] nightclub appearance was filmed and released as ''Tommy James & the Shondells: Live! At [[The Bitter End]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/211726/Tommy-James-the-Shondells-Live-At-the-Bitter-End/overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226220826/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/211726/Tommy-James-the-Shondells-Live-At-the-Bitter-End/overview |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 26, 2009 |title=Tommy James & the Shondells: Live!

Lucia Jr. died of a heart attack while playing golf at the age of 39.

In 2008, Tommy James and The Shondells were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref name="michiganrockandrolllegends.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/90-tommy-james-and-the-shondells|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends - TOMMY JAMES AND THE SHONDELLS|website=Michiganrockandrolllegends.com|access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 2009, James and the surviving Shondells, Gray, Vale and Rosman, reunited to record music for a soundtrack of a proposed film based on James' autobiography, ''Me, the Mob, and the Music'', released in February 2010. The group still gets together from time to time for special video/TV events and nostalgia shows.

In March 2011, the Tommy James song "I'm Alive" (co-written with Peter Lucia) became a Top 20 hit in the Netherlands for UK singer [[Don Fardon]] after his version had been used in a [[Vodafone]] commercial. The song originally appeared on the ''[[Crimson & Clover (album)|Crimson & Clover]]'' LP.

In 2012, "Crystal Blue Persuasion" was used in the eighth episode of Season 5 of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', "[[Gliding Over All]]", during a montage depicting the process involved to bring main character [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]]'s methamphetamine operation and its signature blue crystal meth to an international level.

In 2015, Gray, Vale, and Rosman decided to reunite and form their new group, The Crystal Blue Band. They recruited their longtime friend and drummer Mike Wilps to replace the late Peter Lucia.
