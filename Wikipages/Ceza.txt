'''Bilgin Özçalkan''' ({{IPA-tr|bilˈɟin ˈœstʃaɫkan}}; born 31 December 1976), also known by his stage name '''Ceza''' ({{IPA-tr|dʒeˈzaː|pron}}, Turkish for 'punishment'), is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[rapper]] and songwriter.

==Early works==

In 1995, Özçalkan started a group called U.C.S, and performed with this group until about 1998. His group Nefret got signed under Hammer Music in 2000, and the album ''Meclis Ala – İstanbul'' was released. In 2001, Özçalkan proceeded to release the album ''Anahtar''. The title track on this album that holds the same name as the album itself was the first one that came with a music video. The album was a great success, and Özçalkan performed at many concerts from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mailce.com/ceza-kimdir-ne-zaman-dogdu-muzik-hayati-cezanin-album-isimleri.html|title=Ceza kimdir ne zaman doğdu müzik hayatı ceza\'nın albümleri nelerdir|date=22 June 2008|website=Mailce.com|access-date=22 June 2019}}</ref>

However, Özçalkan's big breakthrough came in 2004. He was invited to one of the biggest rock festivals in Turkey, namely RockIstanbul, and was asked to perform on stage there. He was able to showcase his rap music in an environment that held the largest Turkish popular music acts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mynet.com/ceza-rock-istanbul-canli-performans-2999804-myvideo|title=Ceza Rock İstanbul Canlı Performans|last=Mynet|website=Mynet Video|access-date=22 June 2019}}</ref>

In 2005, at the Turkish rock music festival [[Rock'n Coke|Rock 'n Coke]], Ceza let out a profanity-laden freestyle rap directed at the singer [[Tufan Kıraç|Kıraç]], who had made comments about rap not being real music.<ref>Ceza's freestyle verse at the 2005 Rock 'n Coke. {{Citation|last=ultraslan39|title=ceza – kıraç|date=14 January 2007|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdueIhU2z7U|access-date=8 May 2017}}</ref>

After these two projects, Özçalkan had a featuring with artist Mercan Dede, in his album ''Su'' ("Water").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Mercan-Dede-Su/release/1319640|title=Mercan Dede – Su|website=Discogs|access-date=22 June 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==

Özçalkan was born on 31 December 1976 in [[Üsküdar]], [[Istanbul]], but he was registered on 1 January 1977 in his birth certification. He worked for 8 years as an electrician before he started rapping. He is the first and only Turkish singer who won a [[MTV Music Award]] in 2007. Again in 2007, he created his own clothing brand called Evin Delisi.<ref> ED BRAND https://www.evindelisi.com.tr/ Retrieved 24 November 2019.</ref>
