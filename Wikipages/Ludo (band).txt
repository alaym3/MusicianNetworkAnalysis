'''Ludo''' is an [[alternative rock]] band from [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The band consists of  lead vocalist/guitarist Andrew Volpe, lead guitarist/back up vocalist Tim Ferrell, moog/synth and back up vocalist Tim Convy, and drummer/back up vocalist Matt Palermo.
Although on hiatus since 2012, Ludo announced on their Facebook page on July 16, 2018, that they would be performing in St. Louis in October.
Ludo would go on to follow up in 2019 with another announcement for a two part show titled HalLUDOween 2019 slated for November 1, 2019 and November 2, 2019 with a late show on November 2, 2019 being added due to popular demand, again being played at the Pageant in St. Louis. A planned 2020 concert in Chicago, IL was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

==History==

===Early years===
Ludo's origins can be traced to songs written while Andrew Volpe was attending [[John Burroughs School]] in [[Ladue, Missouri]].  While sitting in his car in the local [[Schnucks]] supermarket parking lot after class, Volpe penned songs that would become some of Ludo's first, including their local breakout radio hit "Hum Along."<ref name="rftstl.com">{{cite web|author=Kathleen McLaughlin |url=http://www.rftstl.com/2008-02-20/news/land-of-ludo/2 |title=Ludo is fired up and ready to play on the national stage - Page 2 - News - St. Louis - Riverfront Times |publisher=Rftstl.com |date=2008-02-20 |access-date=2011-12-08}}</ref> After his sophomore year at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], Volpe formed a band with fellow John Burroughs graduate Dave Heltibrand. Lead guitarist Tim Ferrell joined the band while home on break from the [[University of Notre Dame]].<ref name="rftstl.com"/>  The three adopted the name Ludo after a character in the film ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starrymag.com/content.asp?ID=3702&CATEGORY=Music&PAGE=1 |title=Starry Constellation Magazine Interview with Ludo |publisher=Starrymag.com |access-date=2011-12-08}}</ref>

Heltibrand soon left the band, but lead Volpe and Ferrell continued to play occasionally around St. Louis as an acoustic duo. In 2002, the pair moved to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], after Ferrell graduated from Notre Dame and Volpe dropped out of Washington University's music program.  Tim Convy, one of Ferrell's friends from St. Louis, was added to the band after Volpe watched him sing with an 80s cover band in [[Columbia, Missouri]].  The three men performed together through early 2003, telling audiences they would return in the fall with a rhythm section and an album.

===Solid line-up and ''Ludo''===
Ludo posted an ad: "Bassist/drummer needed to help take over world." Bassist Marshall Fanciullo drove down to Tulsa from [[Omaha, Nebraska]], to audition in summer 2003, and Matt Palermo left community college in [[Spring, Texas]], to join the band on drums.

After playing together for only three weeks, Ludo recorded and released their [[Ludo (Ludo album)|self-titled debut album]] in August 2003 on their own indie label, [[Redbird Records]]. The album included several songs written and performed by Volpe's former band, Karate Lunchbox. Ludo's first show as a full band was at a bar in Indianapolis on August 8, 2003.  For the next few years, the band toured extensively with other Midwestern bands, including [[The Dog and Everything]], [[Anything But Joey]], [[Pomeroy (band)|Pomeroy]] and The Primetime Heroes.  This exposure brought them moderate indie success.

===''Broken Bride''===
As Ludo continued touring, they gained a reputation as an exciting live band. They began hosting regular themed concerts at [[The Pageant]] in St. Louis, and [[The Blue Note (Missouri)|The Blue Note]] in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]]. These include ''HalLUDOween'', ''A Very Ludo Christmas'', and ''Cinco de Mustache''.

In 2005, the band returned to the studio to record the [[Extended Play|EP]] ''[[Broken Bride]],'' a [[rock opera]] about a man who travels backward and forward through time in an attempt to save his wife from dying in a car accident in 1989. The opening track, "Broken Bride: Part 1," was a song that originally stood alone before evolving into the full opera. On the subsequent tour, Ludo would perform Broken Bride in its entirety. The opera proved to be so popular that several stage adaptations have been produced by various colleges and schools.

With increasing popularity, and major label interest, Ludo began touring with larger bands such as [[Relient K]], [[Motion City Soundtrack]], [[This Providence]], [[House of Heroes]], [[Sing It Loud]], [[The Spill Canvas]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]].

===Island Records===
In October 2006, Ludo signed a five-album deal with [[Island Records]] that turned Redbird Records into an Island imprint. Under the deal, the band may release noncommercial material such as Christmas albums or rock operas on the Redbird imprint. In spring 2007, Ludo headed to southern California to record their major label debut with [[Maroon 5]] producer [[Matt Wallace]].

On February 26, 2008, they released their album, ''[[You're Awful, I Love You]].''  The album's lead single was "Love Me Dead," a song written in 2004. Love Me Dead had been a fan favorite for years and the band made two music videos for it. The first video was made with fan participation through their website. The second was professionally made. The single received increased exposure when, on July 11, Ludo performed it live on [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]. "Love Me Dead" was also adapted into a commercial teaser for the show [[House (TV series)|House]],<ref name="house">{{cite web | title = Check Out Ludo's "Love Me Dead" in the Season 5 Teaser of FOX's "House" | publisher = Universal Music Group | date = 2008-07-21| url = http://www.universalmusic.com/artist-news/check-out-ludos-love-me-dead-in-the-season-5-teaser-of-foxs-house | access-date = 2008-11-21}}</ref> and was No.&nbsp;10 on the No.&nbsp;1 Alternative Countdown on [[Fuse TV|Fuse]] the week of August 18, 2008.

However, in November 2008, while on tour in Chicago bassist Marshall Fanciullo was relieved of his duties in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ludo.noboxcreative.com/index.php?board=2;action=display;threadid=8870;start=105#msg218226 |title=Post No.&nbsp;115 by Tim Convy confirming Marshall's departure |publisher=Ludo.noboxcreative.com |date=2008-11-15 |access-date=2011-12-08}}</ref> No official reason was given for his departure, and Ludo did not hire a permanent bass player to replace him. Several people have filled the bassist slot for tours, including Tommy Cantillon of [[Tommy and the High Pilots]].

In 2009, the band announced that their first two releases, ''[[Ludo (Ludo album)|Ludo]]'' and ''[[Broken Bride]]'', would be re-released through Island.<ref name="Ludo12">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=3021298&blogId=505916222 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707101718/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=3021298&blogId=505916222 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-07 |title=Our 1st and 2nd Albums are Coming Out Again |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=2009-08-17 |access-date=2011-12-08 }}</ref> Ludo also undertook a short tour to promote the re-release of "Broken Bride" by again playing the EP in its entirety.<ref name="Ludo12"/>  On the tour's off-dates, members Tim Ferrell, Tim Convy, and Matt Palermo along Adam Brooks toured as a side project, "[[The New Heathers]]."<ref>(2010-08-20) [http://www.bostonmusicspotlight.com/news-ludo-make-plans-for-fall-tour-boston-show-september-2010/ Ludo make plans for fall tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722114724/http://www.bostonmusicspotlight.com/news-ludo-make-plans-for-fall-tour-boston-show-september-2010/ |date=2011-07-22 }} Bostonmusic.com.

As of January 2012, Ludo had been removed from [[Island Records]] artists section, and the  [[Island Records]] imprint was removed from Ludo's official website, [http://www.ludorock.com ludorock.com], leading to speculation that the label had ended their relationship with Ludo.  There has been no official statement from Ludo regarding this matter.

On October 27, 2018, Ludo reunited for a special one night only concert celebrating 15 years of the band and the 10 year anniversary of [[You're Awful, I Love You]].

===HalLUDOween===
Andrew Volpe and several other band members are currently working on a side band called Hot Problems. They created an album, titled 'Relax, It's Just a Pop Album', out of a PledgeMusic.com project.<ref>[http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/hotproblems/ Hot Problems: Debut Album! on PledgeMusic]</ref>

On Oct, 27th 2018, Ludo performed two shows at The Pageant in St. Louis, MO. The show was called ''HalLUDOween'' which had an enormous turnout. The band expressed their shock in how many people bought tickets, stating they didn't know people still cared about the Ludo. Initially, only one show was to happen. Tickets were sold out in under 20 minutes and a late show was added which sold out almost as quickly.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LudoRock|title=Ludo (@LudoRock) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

On July 15, 2019 the band posted an announcement that they would be performing two shows on November 1, 2019 and November 2, 2019, titled HalLUDOween 2019. This announcement came with information that the shows would have separate themes. The November 1st show would be titled All Shadow's Eve and the November 2nd show would be titled Quiet Pines Senior Prom. Tickets went on sale July 15, 2019 and both shows sold out within an hour. Ludo once again expressed their sincere thanks for the support of their fans across various social media platforms. On July 21, 2019 Ludo announced a third show, which would take place on November 2, 2019 after the first show that evening finished, and would be titled Rumble in Transylvania.

HalLUDOween was canceled in 2020. to make up for this, Ludo released their first new piece of music in ten years, Scare Me<ref name=":0" />
