In 1995, they changed their name to Inkubus Sukkubus, citing [[numerology|numerological reasons]], and signed to Resurrection Records.

The band have played many of the major European dark alternative festivals including [[Amphi Festival|Amphi]], [[M'era Luna Festival|M'era Luna]], and the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] at Leipzig.

In June 2017, the band hosted a weekend event<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.evensi.uk/tales-of-witchcraft-amp-wonder-2017-st-briavels-castle/194349386|title=Tales of Witchcraft and Wonder 2017 - 23 June 2017|last=Sukkubus|first=Inkubus|website=Evensi|access-date=2017-06-27}}</ref> at [[St Briavels Castle]] in the [[Forest of Dean]] &ndash; a celebration of midsummer with [[storytelling]], [[history]], Egyptian dancing, and a [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]] ceremony.
