Speaking as much to western European and North American audiences as to Russian audiences, Pussy Riot anticipated [[Donald Trump]]'s victory two weeks before the outcome of the [[2016 United States presidential election]] was declared and released "Make America Great Again", depicting a dystopian world where President Trump enforces his values through beatings, shaming, and branding by stormtroopers. In describing the video, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine noted that "jaunty, carefree music contrasts with the brutal events depicted on screen."<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite news|last1=Leight|first1=Elias|title=Pussy Riot Slam Trump in 'Make America Great Again' Video|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pussy-riot-slam-trump-in-make-america-great-again-video-w447003|access-date=January 28, 2017|work=Rolling Stone|date=October 27, 2016}}</ref>

The group consisted of around a dozen performers and about 15 people who handled the technical work of shooting and editing videos that were posted on the Internet.

Tolokonnikova, her husband, [[Pyotr Verzilov]], and Samutsevich were members of the [[Anarchism and art|anarchist art]] collective "[[Voina]]" from the group's early days in 2007, until an acrimonious split in 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blog-pussy-riots-idUSBRE87F0PW20120816|title=Photographer's blog: Witness to Pussy Riot's activist beginnings|date=2012-08-16|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-01-25|language=en}}</ref> Following the split, they formed a separate Moscow-based group, also named "Voina", saying that they had as much right to use this name as Voina founder Oleg Vorotnikov.<ref name="Thomas Peter">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blog-pussy-riots-idUSBRE87F0PW20120816 |title=Witness to Pussy Riot's activist beginnings |author=Thomas Peter |work=Reuters |date=August 16, 2012 |access-date=October 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bj0c6UNh?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/16/us-blog-pussy-riots-idUSBRE87F0PW20120816 |archive-date=October 27, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Following release Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina said they were no longer members of the group, although they appeared at various events around the world using the name Pussy Riot. Other members tried to distance themselves from the two saying that although they were glad for their release they were anti-capitalistic and did not support them using Pussy Riot to make money from songs and tours. After failing to prevent them using the Pussy Riot name they declared the group dead.<ref name=":3" />

==Musical and performance style ==
In an interview with [[Gazeta.ru]], a band member described their two-minute concerts as [[performance art]], creating images of "pure protest, saying: super heroes in balaclavas and acid bright tights seize public space in Moscow." Another band member, who went by the pseudonym Garadzha, told the [[Moskovskiye Novosti]] newspaper that the group was open to women recruits with limited musical talents. She said: "You don't have to sing very well. It's punk.

During interviews they used [[pseudonym|nicknames]] such as "Balaclava", "Cat", "Seraph", "Terminator", and "Blondie".<ref name=NPR>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/02/08/146581790/in-russia-punk-rock-riot-girls-rage-against-putin |title=In Russia, Punk-Rock Riot Girls Rage Against Putin |date=February 8, 2012 |author=Corey Flintoff |website=npr.org |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=February 10, 2012 |archive-date=October 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BizjOWeH?url=http://www.npr.org/2012/02/08/146581790/in-russia-punk-rock-riot-girls-rage-against-putin |url-status=live  |author-link=Corey Flintoff }}</ref>

== Ideology ==

===Civil society===
In an email interview with ''[[The St. Petersburg Times]]'', the group explained their political positions further, saying that members' perspectives ranged from [[anarchism|anarchist]] to [[social liberalism|liberal left]], but that all were united by feminism, [[anti-authoritarianism]] and opposition to Putin, whom members regard as continuing the "aggressive imperial politics" of the [[Soviet Union]]. Group concerns include education, [[health care]], and the centralization of power, and the group supports regional autonomy and grass-roots organizing. Members regard unsanctioned rallies as a core principle, saying that authorities do not see rallies that they have sanctioned as a threat and simply ignore them. For this reason, all of Pussy Riot's performances were illegal and used co-opted public space.<ref name=FemaleFury /> Interviewed by the BBC during rehearsals the day before the Cathedral of Christ the Savior performance, band members argued that only vivid, illegal actions brought media attention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/multimedia/2012/02/120222_pussy_riot_interview.shtml |title=Феминист-панки Pussy Riot: о чем и зачем? |website=BBC |date=February 22, 2012}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in the spring of 2018 during the band's first North American tour, Tolokonnikova stated that [[economic inequality]] "is a big issue for Pussy Riot", highlighting that such inequality was a notable feature of both Russian and American society, and that discussion of inequality was absent from mainstream political discourse in both the US and Europe.<ref name=slate>{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/pussy-riots-nadezhda-tolokonnikova-on-trans-rights-trump-and-the-activist-messiah-complex.html |title=I Think Trump Could Be Useful |last=Cauterucci |first=Christina |date=May 25, 2018 |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date=May 25, 2018}}</ref>

===Feminism===
The group was organized in part due to anger over what members saw as government policies that discriminated against women, citing [[Abortion in Russia#Current law|legislation]] that "placed restrictions on legal abortions".<ref name=NPR /> According to Tolokonnikova, Pussy Riot was "part of the global anti-capitalist movement, which consists of anarchists, [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], feminists and autonomists."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-interview-with-pussy-riot-activist-nadezhda-tolokonnikova-a-853546.html |title=Interview with Pussy Riot Leader: I Love Russia, But I Hate Putin |work=Der Spiegel |date=September 3, 2012 |access-date=October 27, 2012 |archive-date=October 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bj0lPOiB?url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-interview-with-pussy-riot-activist-nadezhda-tolokonnikova-a-853546.html |url-status=live  }}</ref>
In a February 2012 interview with ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine, Pussy Riot member "Serafima" named her major feminist influences as [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], [[Shulamith Firestone]], [[Kate Millett]], [[Rosi Braidotti]] and [[Judith Butler]].<ref name=vice />

Pussy Riot saw themselves as feminist artists who were influenced by the [[riot grrrl]] movement and musical groups such as [[Bikini Kill]], [[Oi!]], [[Cockney Rejects]] and by writers, activists and artists like [[Alexandra Kollontai]], Judith Butler, [[Karen Finley]], Simone de Beauvoir and [[Vladimir Bukovsky]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Remnick|first=David|title=Pussy Riot Heads For Brooklyn|url=https://newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/02/pussy-riot-heads-for-brooklyn.html |magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=April 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Penny|first=Laurie|title=Pussy Riot: "People fear us because we're feminists"|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/06/pussy-riot-people-fear-us-because-were-feminists|work=New Statesman|access-date=April 25, 2014}}</ref> The media tended to overlook the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it was vastly different from that of Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the ''American Reader,'' Pussy Riot's feminism focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life.<ref name="theamericanreader1">{{cite web|last=Kan|first=Elianna|title=Pussy Riot: What Was Lost (and Ignored) in Translation|url=http://theamericanreader.com/pussy-riot-what-was-lost-and-ignored-in-translation/|work=The American Reader |access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref> Pussy Riot strove to make it clear that [[feminism in Russia]] was still an issue and that [[post-feminism]] had not been achieved.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moeschen|first=Sheila|title=Pussy Riot Proves We Are Not Having a Post-Feminist Moment|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/sheila-moeschen/pussy-riot-proves-we-are-not-having-a-post-feminist-moment_b_4832117.html|work=Huffington Post|date=February 21, 2014|access-date=April 27, 2014}}</ref>
The Russian cultural context had to be acknowledged and its feminist notions had to be seen differently from those of Western feminism because in places such as the United States, feminism evolved to general "women's issues", whereas in Russia that was not the case.<ref name="theamericanreader1" />
In Russia feminism was seen as something "that could destroy Russia," as said by Kirill, the head of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Elder|first=Miriam|title=Feminism could destroy Russia, Russian Orthodox patriarch claims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/09/feminism-destroy-russia-patriarch-kirill?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|work=The Guardian|date=April 9, 2013|access-date=April 25, 2014}}</ref>

We are always saying that anybody can be in Pussy Riot, and we really mean it".<ref name=slate />

== Songs and videos ==

Pussy Riot released seven songs and five videos. An [[Associated Press]] reporter described them as "badly recorded, based on simple riffs and scream-like singing" and stated that critics had dismissed them as "amateur, provocative and obscene".<ref name=oeuvre>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytribune.com/article/20120818/NEWS05/120819465/a-guide-to-pussy-riot-s-oeuvre |title=A guide to Pussy Riot's oeuvre |author=Mansur Mirovalev |date=August 20, 2012 |work=Daily Tribune |agency=Associated Press |archive-date=August 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6A3SCwM7H?url=http://www.dailytribune.com/article/20120818/NEWS05/120819465/a-guide-to-pussy-riot-s-oeuvre |access-date=August 20, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> ''[[The A.V.

=== "Kill the Sexist" ===
On October 1, 2011, Tolokonnikova and Samutsevich gave a lecture on "punk feminism" as members of Voina. They played a recording of the song "Ubey seksista" ("Kill the Sexist"), billing the performers as "a new Russian punk band called Pussy Riot".<ref name=artprotest>{{cite web |url=http://artprotest.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4412&chtoto=2012-05-05-10-56-18&catid=1&catpresledru=&ordering2=1&Itemid=4 |script-title=ru:Пусси Райот, панк-группа |trans-title=Pussy Riot, a punk band |date=October 1, 2011 |author=Anna Brazhkina |website=artprotest.org |access-date=September 18, 2012 |archive-date=October 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bj0gtooQ?url=http://artprotest.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4412&chtoto=2012-05-05-10-56-18&catid=1&catpresledru=&ordering2=1&Itemid=4 |url-status=live |language=ru  }}</ref> This track featured extensive [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of the [[Cockney Rejects]]' 1979 recording "I'm Not a Fool".<ref name=louderthanwar />

=== "Release the Cobblestones" ===
Their first public performance as members of Pussy Riot was in November 2011. Several masked women performed "Osvobodi Bruschatku" ("Release the Cobblestones") atop a scaffold in a Moscow subway and from the top of trolley cars, while tearing apart [[Down feathers|down feather pillows]], showering feathers onto the train platform below. The song recommended that Russians protest upcoming parliamentary elections by throwing cobblestones during street clashes.

The song, which they described as a punk ''[[moleben]]'' (supplicatory prayer), borrowed its opening melody and refrain from [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s "''Bogoroditse Devo, Raduisya''" ([[Hail Mary#Slavonic versions|Ave Maria]]), from the [[All-Night Vigil (Rachmaninoff)|All Night Vigil]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/6572/prmID/1610 |title=Pussy Riot's punk moleben – Virgin Mary Put Putin Away |date=May 24, 2012 |work=PEN |publisher=[[PEN American Center]] |location=New York City |access-date=November 9, 2012 |archive-date=November 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6C3Bxlm5u?url=http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/6572/prmID/1610 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In the song, they invoked the name of the [[Virgin Mary]], urging her to get rid of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and to "become a feminist", claiming that she would support them in their protests. They alluded to close ties between the church and the [[KGB]] ("Black robes, golden epaulettes"), criticized the subservience of many Russians to the church ("Parishioners crawl bowing") and attacked the church's traditionalist views on women ("So as not to offend His Holiness, women must bear children and love"). They used the crude epithet "''Sran Gospodnya''", which has been used to translate "holy shit" in Hollywood movies, but is rarely used in idiomatic Russian; it literally translates as "shit of the Lord". They later explained "It is an idiomatic expression, related to the previous verse – about the fusion of Moscow patriarchy and the government. 'Holy shit' is our evaluation of the situation in the country." They referred to Russian Orthodox Patriarch [[Kirill I of Moscow|Kirill I]], as a "''suka''" (bitch) and accused him of believing more in Putin than in God.<ref name=RS87 /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/20/pussy-riot-punk-prayer-lyrics |title=Pussy Riot's Punk Prayer is pure protest poetry |author=Carol Rumen |work=The Guardian |date=August 20, 2012 |access-date=October 27, 2012 |archive-date=October 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bj3svyAP?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/20/pussy-riot-punk-prayer-lyrics |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/11/what-pussy-riots-punk-prayer-really-said/264562 |title=What Pussy Riot's 'Punk Prayer' Really Said |date=November 8, 2012 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=November 9, 2012 |archive-date=November 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6C3BusnYL?url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/11/what-pussy-riots-punk-prayer-really-said/264562/ |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Growing ties between church and state in Russia were a target of criticism and protest. The [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia|Russian Patriarch]] Kirill had openly supported Putin's 2012 re-election, calling Putin a "miracle from God", who had "rectified the crooked path of history". After the cathedral performance, members of Pussy Riot said the church was a "weapon in a dirty election campaign" and called Putin "a man who is as far as can be from God's truth".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120327/172417090.html |title=Pussy Riot Hit Back at Church Criticism |date=March 27, 2012 |agency=RIA Novosti |archive-date=October 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bj40WP9A?url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120327/172417090.html |access-date=October 27, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This performance led to the arrest and prosecution of three of their members.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Pussy Riot released their first song and video in English in February 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Simon|title=Pussy Riot Releases Its First Song in English|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/02/21/387985147/pussy-riot-releases-its-first-song-in-english|access-date=January 28, 2017|date=February 18, 2015}}</ref> "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXctA2BqF9A I Can't Breathe]" is named for the last words that [[Eric Garner]] said as [[New York City Police]] held him to the ground in a chokehold. In their music video for this song, band members wear Russian riot police uniforms and are slowly buried alive as they sing. They wear these specific uniforms because they are worn by Russian police during clashes between police and protesters for change, and to make the statement that illegal violence not only kills the oppressed, but slowly kills the oppressors. According to Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova, "Policemen, soldiers, agents, they become hostages and are buried with those they kill, both figuratively and literally".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ohlheiser|first1=Abby|title='I Can't Breathe': Pussy Riot's first song in English is about Eric Garner|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/02/18/i-cant-breathe-pussy-riots-first-song-in-english-is-about-eric-garner/|access-date=January 28, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=February 18, 2015}}</ref> The symbolism behind the "Russian Spring" brand cigarettes in the video is that the brand name is the same phrase used by supporters of Russian invasion of the Ukraine. Pussy Riot was responsible for concept and production of the video, while vocals and lyrics were performed by two other Russian bands, [[Jack Wood (band)|Jack Wood]] and [[Scofferlane]]. With this song, Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova begin to show the parallels between police brutality and state oppression in Russia and the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Scott|title=Pussy Riot Releases Its First Song in English|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/02/21/387985147/pussy-riot-releases-its-first-song-in-english|access-date=January 28, 2017|work=National Public Radio|date=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

=== "Make America Great Again" ===
In response to [[Donald Trump]]'s candidacy, Pussy Riot released the song and video "Make America Great Again" in October 2016.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> The video depicts a dystopian world where Trump, played by one of the band members, is the president. Trump enforces his values through beatings, shaming, and branding of victims delivered by stormtroopers. As the thugs torture their victims, Pussy Riot sings the following lyrics: "Let other people in/ Listen to your women/ Stop killing black children/ Make America great again".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Light|first1=Elias|title=Pussy Riot Slam Donald Trump in 'Make America Great Again' Video|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pussy-riot-slam-trump-in-make-america-great-again-video-w447003|access-date=January 28, 2017|work=Rolling Stone|date=October 27, 2016}}</ref> [[Jonas Akerlund]] directed this video.

==="My Agenda"===
In October 2020, Pussy Riot, along with the [[Village People]], made guest appearances on the [[Dorian Electra]] single "My Agenda."

Defense attorney Nikolai Polozov said that both Tolokonnikova and Samutsevich were also members of the [[Voina]] group, and both had previously staged disruptive protests in the Tagansky Court building, where they would be judged. He argued that their two previous attempts to disrupt proceedings would bias the judge, and preclude a fair outcome at that location.

=== Appeal to the Moscow City Court ===
On October 1, 2012, an appellate hearing was postponed in the Moscow City Court (a [[Judiciary of Russia#Regional courts|regional court]], similar to the supreme court of a republic) after Samutsevich informed a panel of three judges that she wished to terminate the representation of her defense attorneys as "My position in the criminal case does not coincide with their position."<ref name="Herszenhorn" />

In an interview for his 60th birthday broadcast on October 7, shortly before the appeal was heard, Putin said that Pussy Riot had "undermined the moral foundations" of the country and that they "got what they asked for".<ref name=InterfaxReligion>{{cite news |url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=9971 |title=Putin deems fair Pussy Riot sentence |work=Interfax Religion |date=October 8, 2012 |access-date=November 3, 2012}}</ref> In response, Pussy Riot lawyer Violetta Volkova accused Putin of putting pressure on the court.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.interfax.ru/society/txt.asp?id=269721 |title=Адвокаты Pussy Riot жалуются |date=October 8, 2012 |website=interfax.ru |location=Moscow |language=ru |trans-title=Pussy Riot lawyers complain |access-date=November 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=36329 |title=Chernov's Choice |author=Sergey Chernov |work=St Petersburg Times |date=October 10, 2012 |access-date=November 3, 2012 |archive-date=November 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BtfrwkAo?url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=36329 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

On October 10, Samutsevich's new lawyer, Irina Khrunova, argued that her client had not in fact committed the acts of hooliganism in the church as she was prevented from accessing the soleas by church security. The court appeared to accept this argument, and released Samutsevich on two years' probation. However, the judges rejected the appeals of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, upholding their convictions and sentences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/russian-court-releases-pussy-riot-member/1523761.html |title=Russia Frees One Punk Rocker, Keeps Two in Jail |author=James Brooke |date=October 10, 2012 |website=voanews.com |publisher=Voice of America |access-date=November 1, 2012 |archive-date=November 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bqwf27Ar?url=http://www.voanews.com/content/russian-court-releases-pussy-riot-member/1523761.html |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.gazeta.ru/news/2012/10/10/a_4807253.shtml |title=One of three Pussy Riot band members freed |date=October 10, 2012 |website=gazeta.ru |access-date=November 1, 2012 |archive-date=November 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BqxMFK1f?url=http://en.gazeta.ru/news/2012/10/10/a_4807253.shtml |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Writing for ''[[The New Republic]]'', Russian-American journalist [[Julia Ioffe]] commented that by arguing that Samutsevich was innocent because she had not participated, Khrunova's defense had implied that Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina had in fact committed a crime, and had cut off "the one path to redemption that the group actually had: ignoring the court's proceedings and denying its legitimacy".

In response to questions posed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' and handed to the band through their lawyer, Pussy Riot accused Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church of orchestrating the case.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/pussy-riot-interview-yekaterina-samutsevich?newsfeed=true |title=Pussy Riot: 'we still burn with desire to take Putin's monopoly on power' |author=Miriam Elder |date=August 27, 2012 |work=The Guardian |archive-date=October 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BniEYtzF?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/27/pussy-riot-interview-yekaterina-samutsevich?newsfeed=true |access-date=October 29, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Samutsevich said in December 2012 that "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated.

They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken to the courtroom, and not go in at all and everything would've gone the same way.

On June 30, 2013, Vladimir Putin signed a bill imposing jail terms and fines for insulting people's religious feelings, which some have seen as a response to the "punk prayer" performed by the Pussy Riot in a Moscow cathedral.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10151790/Vladimir-Putin-signs-anti-gay-propaganda-bill.html |title=Vladimir Putin signs anti-gay propaganda bill |date=June 30, 2013 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> In a "Live TV" (Russian: "Прямой Эфир") show aired on September 30, 2013, by [[Rossiya 1]] TV channel, Maria Alyokhina pledged to do no more shows at churches. "We've paid attention to the fact that, as it turns out, since 2013 this has been a criminal offense, and we've repeatedly heard opinions from people whom we take seriously.

Though they were due for release in March 2014, on December 19, 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina would be freed under a general amnesty.

The connection between Pussy Riot and the political performance art group [[Voina]] was highlighted by some of the group's critics, who  called it an "aggravating moral circumstance" in the eyes of the conservative public (which constitutes about 60 per cent of Russians).<ref name=newsru>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/17aug2012/tolokno.html |title=Перед приговором секс-символ Pussy Riot в письме сторонникам заявила о победе: "Трудно поверить, что это не сон" ("Before verdict, Pussy Riot sex symbol says to supporters in letter 'It is hard to believe this is not a dream'") |date=August 17, 2012 |website=newsru.com |access-date=November 2, 2012 |archive-date=November 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BsMBQL5K?url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/17aug2012/tolokno.html |url-status=live  }}</ref> Pussy Riot members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich were members of Voina from 2007 until the group split in 2009, and participated in a number of Voina's provocative art performances.<ref name="Thomas Peter" />

Some critics made little or no distinction between Pussy Riot and Voina, incorrectly attributing past actions of Voina to Pussy Riot. In particular, [[Voina#How to Snatch a Chicken|a notorious performance]] by Voina in St. Petersburg, in which a woman stole a chicken from a supermarket by stuffing it in her [[vagina]], is sometimes cited by detractors of Pussy Riot.

=== Extremist videos decision ===
In early November 2012 prosecutors applied under anti-extremism legislation to Zamoskvoretsky District Court to ban several Pussy Riot videos, including the video of the group's performance in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.

The ruling restricted access to the videos and to Pussy Riot's [[LiveJournal]] blog and other websites.

[[Damir Gainutdinov]] of the [[Agora (organization)|Agora]] human rights group argued that the anti-extremism laws were being applied inappropriately, saying "Everyone says that the [Cathedral of Christ the Savior] video hurt the feelings of religious people, but it didn't contain any calls for extremist actions, so it cannot be extremist". Yekaterina Samutsevich called the ruling a "direct recognition of artistic censorship" in Russia.<ref name=A1130>{{cite news |title=Russian court issues Pussy Riot video ban |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/russian-court-issues-pussy-riot-video-ban/story-e6frg6so-1226527589707 |agency=Agence France-Presse |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |location=Sydney |date=November 30, 2012 |access-date=December 1, 2012 |archive-date=December 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CbG0RB4J?url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/russian-court-issues-pussy-riot-video-ban/story-e6frg6so-1226527589707 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

=== Requests for sentence deferment ===
In the case of mothers of young children, Russian law allows for deferment of a prison sentence until the child reaches the age of 14. Such a request was controversially granted in 2011 to Anna Shavenkova, who had been sentenced to two years and six months prison for [[vehicular manslaughter]]. It was alleged that her request was granted because of her family connections.<ref>{{cite news |title=United Russia party member wins right not to start sentence until 2024 |author=Andrew Osborn |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8499021/United-Russia-party-member-wins-right-not-to-start-sentence-until-2024.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=[[London]] |date=May 6, 2011 |access-date=April 30, 2013}}</ref>

On October 19, 2012, the Khamovniki District Court in Moscow rejected an appeal for deferment of sentence filed by Violetta Volkova on behalf of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, on the grounds that the case did not fall within its jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pussy Riot motion for sentencing delay rejected |url=http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20121019/265056203.html |newspaper=RAPSI News |date=October 19, 2012 |access-date=April 30, 2013}}</ref> Tolokonnikova subsequently filed an appeal with the Zubovo-Polyansky District Court in Mordovia, where she was imprisoned, and Alyokhina with the Berezniki District Court in Perm. Alyokhina's appeal was rejected on January 16, 2013, the judge stating that the presence of her child was already taken into account during her original sentence.

On July 24, 2013, a Russian court turned down an appeal by Maria Alyokhina against a previous court ruling that denied her an early release on parole.<ref>{{cite news |title=Russian Court Rejects Pussy Riot Member Parole Bid |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/russian-court-rejects-pussy-riot-member-parole-bid |agency=Associated Press |access-date=July 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014102022/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/russian-court-rejects-pussy-riot-member-parole-bid |archive-date=October 14, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Release from prison ===
On December 19, 2013, the state Duma approved a general amnesty for various prisoners; among those who qualified for amnesty were those in prison for non-violent offences and mothers of young children. It was expected that Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina would be among those who were released.<ref>Korina Lopez, ''USA Today'' (December 19, 2013).

Following her release, Alyokhina went to meet with human rights activists.
"We didn't ask for any pardon. I would have sat here until the end of my sentence because I don't need mercy from Putin," Maria Alyokhina told ''The New York Times'' after her release.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/world/europe/member-of-russian-punk-band-freed-under-amnesty-law.html?hp&_r=1& Released Punk Rockers Keep Up Criticism of Putin].

The two said that they would not be performing in shows but were starting an organization to work for better conditions for prison inmates and that they still wanted Putin removed from government. Both said that Soviet dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] is their role model, a man whom Tolokonnikova said is a "human rights champion undeterred by fear."<ref name="cbc1">{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/nadezhda-tolokonnikova-released-pussy-riot-member-slams-putin-1.2476931 | title=Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, released Pussy Riot member, slams Putin: Tolokonnikova says her release was pre-Olympics PR move |work=CBC News | publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | date=December 27, 2013 | access-date=January 1, 2014}}</ref>

=== Amnesty International concert and membership controversy ===
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova (Nadia) and Maria Alyokhina (Masha) participated in the February 6, 2014 [[Amnesty International]] concert in [[Barclays Center]], [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. They were invited to the stage by [[Madonna]].

<blockquote>
We are all—female separatist collective—no man can represent us either on a poster or in reality.

We belong to leftist anti-capitalist ideology—we charge no fees for viewing our artwork, all our videos are distributed freely on the web, the spectators to our performances are always spontaneous passers by, and we never sell tickets to our "shows."

Our performances are always 'illegal,' staged only in unpredictable locations and public places not designed for traditional entertainment. The distribution of our clips is always through free and unrestricted media channels.

We are anonymous, because we act against any personality cult, against hierarchies implied by appearance, age and other visible social attributes. We cover our heads, because we oppose the very idea of using female face as a trademark for promoting any sort of goods or services.

The mixing of the rebel feminist punk image with the image of institutionalized defenders of prisoners' rights, is harmful for us as collective, as well as it is harmful for the new role that Nadia and Masha have taken on.

In response Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina stated that:<ref>{{cite news|last=Kedmey|first=Dan|title=Those Two Pussy Riot Women?

=== Presence at the Sochi Winter Olympics ===
Tolokonnikova, Alyokhina, and three unidentified women planned to perform a song called "Putin Will Teach You to Love the Motherland" as Pussy Riot during the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]].
