==Personal life==

===Background and early life===
Trevor Hall grew up in [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]].  He grew up surrounded by music due in part to his father who was a drummer and musician.<ref name="ecowatch.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.ecowatch.com/trevor-hall-2456909926.html|title=Trevor Hall: Awakening Your Spiritual Consciousness ... a Powerful Form of Activism|date=July 27, 2017|website=Ecowatch.com|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref> After dabbling with multiple instruments including trombone and bass, he decided to learn guitar in hopes of becoming a singer-songwriter one day.<ref name="ecowatch.com"/> At age 16 he recorded his first album.<ref name="virb.com">{{cite web|url=http://trevorhall.virb.com/bio|title=Bio -|website=Trevorhall.virb.com|accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Shortly after, Hall left South Carolina for Los Angeles where he enrolled and studied classical guitar at Idyllwild Arts Academy.<ref name="virb.com"/> During his time, he was introduced to yoga and meditation practices and spirituality, which made a major impact on him and has since influenced his life and music. He stated that one of the most important weekends of his life was when he went to a Hindu temple for a weekend while at Idyllwild. At the temple, he learned about the Hindu goddess Kali and was happily surprised to find out people worship God as a woman. After he graduated, he attended a Kali Mandir (Hindu temple) and eventually accepted Hindu Swami Bhajanananda Saraswati as his guru. He has stated that he tries to treat his music as karma yoga, where he wants to create music that will help other people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/yoga-trends/musical-youth/|title=How Trevor Hall's Practice Inspires His Music|date=3 October 2008|website=Yoga Journal|access-date=5 April 2021}}</ref>  During his senior year at Idyllwild Arts Academy, Hall was signed to Geffen Records,<ref name="virb.com"/> which signaled the formal start of his career.
