==History==

===2012–2013: Formation===
Lead singer Amelia Meath, who was at the time involved with her trio, [[Mountain Man (band)|Mountain Man]], created the vocals to the song called "[[Play It Right]]". She later met electronic music producer Nick Sanborn (who played bass in band [[Megafaun]]) in Milwaukee at the Cactus Club,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.indyweek.com/music/archives/2013/07/17/interview-sylvan-esso-talks-debut-single-bright-future|title = Interview: Sylvan Esso talks debut single, bright future|date = July 17, 2013|access-date = April 18, 2015|website = Indy Week|last = Lawrence|first = Jordan}}</ref> performing at the time solo as ''Made of Oak'',<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/2014/05/10/311276182/the-music-of-oak-and-forest-sprite-blend-in-sylvan-esso|title = The Music Of Oak And Forest Sprite Blend In Sylvan Esso|date = May 10, 2014|access-date = March 27, 2015|website = NPR|publisher = NPR|last = Simon|first = Scott}}</ref> and asked him to make a rendering of her single, Play It Right, in his own way. From 2012 to 2013, the band slowly formed. Meath had returned from a year-and-a-half tour with [[Feist (singer)|Feist]] and was looking for an affordable place to live, thus landing in Durham with Sanborn<ref name=":0" /> and began making their album, with all of their songs being recorded in Sanborn's apartment bedroom. The band named itself after a character in an early [[iOS]] game titled "Swords and Sworcery".<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/2yotcl/ama_hi_were_sylvan_esso_ask_us_anything/|title = Sylvan Esso AMA|date = March 11, 2015|access-date = July 31, 2019|website = Reddit}}</ref>

In explaining Free Love, Sanborn said, “Free Love is the first realization of a thing we've been shooting at for a long time, which is for Sylvan Esso to not feel like two people. [We wanted] it to feel like it was one expression. All of the walls that used to exist between us and divide our roles just slowly came down through the maturity of communication. It's something that you can't have with somebody that you haven't worked with for this long.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/music/sylvan-esso-free-love-interview/|title=Sylvan Esso look inward|date=2020-09-23|website=stereogum.com|access-date=2021-02-12}}</ref>

The Thursday before the album was released, the band hosted a multimedia art project on their website called Opening Night. The project included a video[3] with a 20 minute improvised modular set by Nick (sampling from the album), interviews with music video directors, various art pieces by Nathaniel Russell, an improvised dance by [[Emma Portner]] to "Numb", a song dedicated to the band by [[Jeff Tweedy]] and a DJ set by [[Merrill Garbus]] of [[Tune-Yards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2082085/sylvan-esso-with-concert-film/news/|title=Free Love|date=2020-09-22|website=stereogum.com|access-date=2021-02-12}}</ref>

Free Love was released September 25, 2020 via Loma Vista Recordings to positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly described the album as “​...somehow prescient and nostalgic in the same breath. It traffics in intimacy and self-preservation in the face of opening oneself up to love.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/music/sylvan-esso-free-love-interview/|title=Sylvan Esso look inward|date=2020-09-22|website=ew.com|access-date=2021-02-12}}</ref> UPROXX said the songs on Free Love were “more intimate and cohesive than ever before.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/indie/sylvan-esso-interview-free-love/|title=Sylvan Esso’s Small Arguments Become Musical Bliss On The Upcoming ‘Free Love’|date=2020-09-03|website=uproxx.com|access-date=2021-02-12}}</ref> The Line of Best Fit described the album as “ten irregular yet exquisite pearls of synth-pop” and gave the album a 9 out of 10,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/sylvan-esso-free-love-album-review|title=Free Love is Sylvan Esso at their most cohesive|date=2020-09-21|website=thelineofbestfit.com|access-date=2021-02-12}}</ref> while Bob Boilen of NPR Music included it on his list of 10 favorite albums of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2020/12/29/949274547/bob-boilens-top-10-albums-of-2020|title=Bob Boilen's Top 10 Albums Of 2020|date=2020-12-29|website=npr.org|access-date=2021-02-12}}</ref>

==Artistry==
Sanborn has cited being inspired by The Books and [[Boards of Canada]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/sylvan-esso-all-you-need-is-love/|title=Sylvan Esso: All You Need Is Love|date=2020-12-07|website=relix.com|access-date=2021-02-12}}</ref> while Meath has said, “We always make records about how the world is dying. They're sad songs that sound really happy.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.them.us/story/sylvan-esso-amelia-meath-interview|title=Sylvan Esso’s Amelia Meath Is Stepping Out Into the World, Again|date=2020-08-24|website=them.us|access-date=2021-02-12}}</ref> 

Of the duo’s singular style, The New York Times explained, “Sylvan Esso evades the booming, repetitive overkill of typical electronic dance music. Instead, the tracks stay fragile and keep coming deliberately unsprung, defying mechanical regularity.” <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/arts/music/sylvan-esso-what-now-interview.html|title=Sylvan Esso Keeps Electronic Pop Human|date=2017-04-26|website=nytimes.com|access-date=2021-02-12}}</ref>
